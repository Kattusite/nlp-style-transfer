0	But he has got no conversation.
0	The sculptor gladly surrenders imitative colour, and the painter the actual dimensions of form, because by such renunciations they are able to avoid too definite a presentation of the Real, which would be mere imitation, and too definite a realisation of the Ideal, which would be too purely intellectual.

0	The sea wanders within them and the moon comes never to trouble the blue of their waves.
0	“Quack, quack, quack,” she said.
0	With a wheel I can draw the Moon from heaven, and in a crystal I can show thee Death.

0	A mother’s love means devotion, unselfishness, sacrifice.

0	And besides, if a woman really repents, she has to go to a bad dressmaker, otherwise no one believes in her.
0	No married man is ever attractive except to his wife.
0	Art is Individualism, and Individualism is a disturbing and disintegrating force.
0	This man is for ever vomiting insults against me.
0	I pay the dancers well.
0	I am sorry I told you now.
0	It was simply the expression that had altered.
0	Lord Goring merely rang that you should show me out.
0	Our fathers used to like that sort of piece, I believe.
0	What was it, he wondered.
0	There were tears in his eyes as he went downstairs.
0	He was dominated by the carelessness of happiness, by the high indifference of joy.
0	His lordship’s directions on the subject were very precise.
0	[_Enter_ LADY HUNSTANTON, _followed by Footman with shawls and a cushion_.]
0	It is a great fault.
0	It is a question whether we have ever seen the full expression of a personality, except on the imaginative plane of art.
0	It fills one with the terror of eternity.
0	Pray let me introduce myself to you.
0	Why shouldn't I look at it?"
0	But even admitting this strange imitative instinct in Life and Nature, surely you would acknowledge that Art expresses the temper of its age, the spirit of its time, the moral and social conditions that surround it, and under whose influence it is produced.
0	One of those utterly tedious amusements one only finds at an English country house on an English country Sunday.
0	It is a most joyful occasion, and when I soar up into the air I intend to tell the stars all about it.
0	In fact, it was just such weather as he loved.
0	What do you mean, Algy, by Cecily!
0	He seems to have expressed a desire to be buried in Paris.

0	Is that what you want to talk to me about to-night?
0	"She is still _decolletee_," he answered, taking an olive in his long fingers; "and when she is in a very smart gown she looks like an _edition de luxe_ of a bad French novel.
0	Lady Agatha shook her head, but could not help being amused.
0	As he was sitting at breakfast next morning, Basil Hallward was shown into the room.
0	I have something very particular to say to Mr. Worthing.
0	But after all, as Lord Illingworth says, it is impossible to live in such a place as Wrockley.
0	Mrs. Erlynne has a future before her.
0	“I am afraid you don’t quite see the moral of the story,” remarked the Linnet.

0	If he is dead, I don't want to think about him.
0	From the point of view of style, a healthy work of art is one whose style recognises the beauty of the material it employs, be that material one of words or of bronze, of colour or of ivory, and uses that beauty as a factor in producing the æsthetic effect.
0	However, it is always nice to be expected, and not to arrive.
0	And Lord Henry flung himself down on the divan and opened his cigarette-case.

0	The arena was then cleared amidst much applause, and the dead hobby-horses dragged solemnly away by two Moorish pages in yellow and black liveries, and after a short interlude, during which a French posture-master performed upon the tightrope, some Italian puppets appeared in the semi-classical tragedy of _Sophonisba_ on the stage of a small theatre that had been built up for the purpose.

0	But do you really think, dear Caroline, that legislation would improve matters in any way?
0	We are the laurels to hide their baldness.
0	Surely Love is a wonderful thing.
0	I am too much concentrated on myself.
0	It is sufficient to note that it exists, and that there is in us a beauty-sense, separate from the other senses and above them, separate from the reason and of nobler import, separate from the soul and of equal value—a sense that leads some to create, and others, the finer spirits as I think, to contemplate merely.
0	That is an improvement certainly.

0	She left the room, wreathed in smiles.
0	Harry, what shall I do?
0	Why should you do him the wrong Mrs. Cheveley tried to do and failed?
0	Nobody can possibly care for Delobelle with his “Il faut lutter pour l’art,” or for Valmajour with his eternal refrain about the nightingale, or for the poet in _Jack_ with his “mots cruels,” now that we have learned from _Vingt Ans de ma Vie littéraire_ that these characters were taken directly from life.
0	Who is he, the Son of Man?
0	That at least one can see.
0	It is upon lines of intellect that a man’s life progresses.
0	His will be the perfect life, and his only.
0	Well, not till to-day, old boy, I admit.
0	For goodness' sake don't play that ghastly tune, Algy.
0	[_Glances instinctively at_ LORD WINDERMERE _while he speaks_.]
0	I certainly never know one from the other.
0	I did not think you would remember me, Mrs. Cheveley.
0	But I love her, Arthur.
0	There is this to be said in favour of the despot, that he, being an individual, may have culture, while the mob, being a monster, has none.
0	"I don't desire to change anything in England except the weather," he answered.
0	I don’t want dinner, in fact.
0	But don’t bring Mr. Trafford.

0	Though the moment does not make the man, the moment certainly makes the Impressionist, and for the moment in art, and the ‘moment’s monument,’ as Rossetti phrased it, what may not be said?
0	In these days God doth not show Himself.
0	What a charming house you have, Lady Chiltern!
0	They would defile it and make it shameful.
0	The apple-blossoms kept tumbling down on her hair, and she was laughing.
0	But, Gertrude, listen to me.
0	At five o'clock he rang his bell for his servant and gave him orders to pack his things for the night-express to town, and to have the brougham at the door by eight-thirty.
0	"My own darling, thank God you are found; you must never leave my side again," murmured Mrs. Otis, as she kissed the trembling child, and smoothed the tangled gold of her hair.
0	That must not be said.
0	Thy mother hath filled the earth with the wine of her iniquities, and the cry of her sins hath come up to the ears of God.
0	Why, my dear Arthur, I have very much more money than you have, and quite as much as Robert Chiltern has got hold of.
0	The old Canterville look came into his eyes; he ground his toothless gums together; and, raising his withered hands high above his head, swore according to the picturesque phraseology of the antique school, that, when Chanticleer had sounded twice his merry horn, deeds of blood would be wrought, and murder walk abroad with silent feet.
0	‘I said with John Woodvil,’ he cries, ‘it were a life of gods to dwell in such an element,’ to see and hear and write brave things:—     ‘These high and gusty relishes of life     Have no allayings of mortality.’ It is impossible not to feel that in this passage we have the utterance of a man who had a true passion for letters.
0	The sky above was like a faded rose.

0	Dear mother, how can you say so?

0	Makes it quite cosmopolitan, doesn't it?
0	You left her, abandoned her when she was but a child in the cradle, abandoned her for your lover, who abandoned you in turn.
0	Now as the State is not to govern, it may be asked what the State is to do.
0	It will be what the Greeks sought for, but could not, except in Thought, realise completely, because they had slaves, and fed them; it will be what the Renaissance sought for, but could not realise completely except in Art, because they had slaves, and starved them.
0	"Don't pay any attention to him, Dorian," said the painter.

0	You’ll play, of course, Tuppy?
0	Of course, the public are very reckless in their use of the word.
0	Then came that dreadful night--was it really only last night?--when she played so badly, and my heart almost broke.
0	With white claws of foam the sea grabbled at the shore.
0	she hissed out, putting haggard face quite close to his.
0	It is possible that De Quincey exaggerated his critical powers, and I cannot help saying again that there is much in his published works that is too familiar, too common, too journalistic, in the bad sense of that bad word.

0	I shall leave it here for you by the bedroom candles, and will be happy to supply you with more, should you require it."
0	I have said of myself that I was one who stood in symbolic relations to the art and culture of my age.

0	I must accept it as a punishment, and if one is ashamed of having been punished, one might just as well never have been punished at all.
0	He waited impatiently for him to go.
0	It should be more widely known.
0	I could not give it here.
0	In the present instance, you are quite astray.
0	The fact is that our Society is terribly over-populated.
0	I never can believe a word you say!
0	Individualism will also be unselfish and unaffected.
0	Being of course very much frightened and a little hurt, it began to scream, and in a few seconds the whole street was full of rough people who came pouring out of the houses like ants.
0	The curious objects that were being constantly brought to light by excavations were not left to moulder in a museum, for the contemplation of a callous curator, and the _ennui_ of a policeman bored by the absence of crime.

0	Then came the United States Minister and his wife, then Washington and the three boys, and in the last carriage was Mrs. Umney.
0	Nay, more, I would say that the highest Criticism, being the purest form of personal impression, is in its way more creative than creation, as it has least reference to any standard external to itself, and is, in fact, its own reason for existing, and, as the Greeks would put it, in itself, and to itself, an end.
0	I should like to see that day of which he speaks, when the moon shall become like blood, and when the stars shall fall upon the earth like ripe figs.
0	Gertrude, Gertrude, you are to me the white image of all good things, and sin can never touch you.
0	When wisdom has been profitless to me, philosophy barren, and the proverbs and phrases of those who have sought to give me consolation as dust and ashes in my mouth, the memory of that little, lovely, silent act of love has unsealed for me all the wells of pity: made the desert blossom like a rose, and brought me out of the bitterness of lonely exile into harmony with the wounded, broken, and great heart of the world.
0	The correctness of the French was, of course, impugned, although the scrip had been passed by a distinguished French writer, to whom I have heard the whole work attributed.
0	Can’t you love me a little in return?
0	He felt ready to leap upon him and fling him to the ground if he dared to lift the gorgeous hanging that concealed the secret of his life.
0	I should like so much to know her.
0	It is all wrong, all wrong.
0	But there are other journalists, I feel certain, men of education and cultivation, who really dislike publishing these things, who know that it is wrong to do so, and only do it because the unhealthy conditions under which their occupation is carried on oblige them to supply the public with what the public wants, and to compete with other journalists in making that supply as full and satisfying to the gross popular appetite as possible.
0	"And yet," continued Lord Henry, in his low, musical voice, and with that graceful wave of the hand that was always so characteristic of him, and that he had even in his Eton days, "I believe that if one man were to live out his life fully and completely, were to give form to every feeling, expression to every thought, reality to every dream--I believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we would forget all the maladies of mediaevalism, and return to the Hellenic ideal--to something finer, richer than the Hellenic ideal, it may be.

0	He then ordered his horse to be brought round, and, after insisting on his wife and the three boys sitting down to dinner, rode off down the Ascot road with a groom.
0	No one could see it.
0	Suddenly she felt the need to speak.

0	Here was Philip Herbert, described by Francis Osborne, in his Memoires on the Reigns of Queen Elizabeth and King James, as one who was "caressed by the Court for his handsome face, which kept him not long company."
0	I don't know what my guardians will say.
0	It sounds vain, but you understand what I mean.
0	Up to the present, man has been, to a certain extent, the slave of machinery, and there is something tragic in the fact that as soon as man had invented a machine to do his work he began to starve.
0	After all, Gerald, you couldn’t be expected to pass all your life in such a hole as Wrockley, could you?
0	As George Harford I had everything I wanted.
0	He and I are closer than friends.
0	But nothing must be done in a hurry.
0	And yet while it will not meddle with others, it will help all, as a beautiful thing helps us, by being what it is.
0	Indeed, I took the chair at a meeting some time ago, and we passed resolutions condemning everything that we did not like.
0	"My dear fellow, as if I cared!
0	The emotions of man are stirred more quickly than man’s intelligence; and, as I pointed out some time ago in an article on the function of criticism, it is much more easy to have sympathy with suffering than it is to have sympathy with thought.

0	And now, simply because it turns out that I am the boy’s own father and he my own son, you propose practically to ruin his career.

0	But the artist, who accepts the facts of life, and yet transforms them into shapes of beauty, and makes them vehicles of pity or of awe, and shows their colour-element, and their wonder, and their true ethical import also, and builds out of them a world more real than reality itself, and of loftier and more noble import—who shall set limits to him?

0	It was Romeo and Juliet.
0	No artist desires to prove anything.
0	By its means he can both reveal and conceal himself, and give form to every fancy, and reality to every mood.
0	My dear boy, if I didn’t like you I wouldn’t have made you the offer.
0	By the way, Lady Chiltern, there is no list of your guests in _The Morning Post_ of to-day.
0	I must speak of it.
0	For out of ourselves we can never pass, nor can there be in creation what in the creator was not.
0	There was no trace of the murdered man anywhere.
0	Have this letter sent at once to Claridge’s Hotel.

0	As it was, our bonnets were so unbecoming, and the mills were so occupied in trying to raise the wind, that I never had even a flirtation with anybody.
0	I told him your lordship was here.
0	He beat out the gold into roses, and strung them together for necklace or armlet.
0	That it will do so, however, I feel as certain as that we shall require from our dramatic critics in the future higher qualification than that they can remember Macready or have seen Benjamin Webster; we shall require of them, indeed, that they cultivate a sense of beauty.
0	But he thrust her back frowning, and said to her, ‘If thou keepest not the promise that thou madest to me I will slay thee for a false witch.’ She grew grey as a blossom of the Judas tree, and shuddered.

0	Gerald, to save you from the world’s sneers and taunts I have lied to the world.
0	Well, we might trot round to the Empire at ten?
0	I am not sure about that, but it has at least the minor merit of being true.

0	In two or three minutes there was another knock, and Mr. Hubbard himself, the celebrated frame-maker of South Audley Street, came in with a somewhat rough-looking young assistant.
0	Finally, after vainly trying to force the door, they got on the roof and dropped down on to the balcony.

0	I feel bound to tell you that you are not down on my list of eligible young men, although I have the same list as the dear Duchess of Bolton has.
0	Will you ask them to call my carriage, please?
0	The note of the perfect personality is not rebellion, but peace.
0	With a stifled sob the lad leaped from the couch, and, rushing over to Hallward, tore the knife out of his hand, and flung it to the end of the studio.
0	“You are a very irritating person,” said the Rocket, “and very ill-bred.

0	Over and over again Dorian used to read this fantastic chapter, and the two chapters immediately following, in which, as in some curious tapestries or cunningly wrought enamels, were pictured the awful and beautiful forms of those whom vice and blood and weariness had made monstrous or mad:  Filippo, Duke of Milan, who slew his wife and painted her lips with a scarlet poison that her lover might suck death from the dead thing he fondled; Pietro Barbi, the Venetian, known as Paul the Second, who sought in his vanity to assume the title of Formosus, and whose tiara, valued at two hundred thousand florins, was bought at the price of a terrible sin; Gian Maria Visconti, who used hounds to chase living men and whose murdered body was covered with roses by a harlot who had loved him; the Borgia on his white horse, with Fratricide riding beside him and his mantle stained with the blood of Perotto; Pietro Riario, the young Cardinal Archbishop of Florence, child and minion of Sixtus IV, whose beauty was equalled only by his debauchery, and who received Leonora of Aragon in a pavilion of white and crimson silk, filled with nymphs and centaurs, and gilded a boy that he might serve at the feast as Ganymede or Hylas; Ezzelin, whose melancholy could be cured only by the spectacle of death, and who had a passion for red blood, as other men have for red wine--the son of the Fiend, as was reported, and one who had cheated his father at dice when gambling with him for his own soul; Giambattista Cibo, who in mockery took the name of Innocent and into whose torpid veins the blood of three lads was infused by a Jewish doctor; Sigismondo Malatesta, the lover of Isotta and the lord of Rimini, whose effigy was burned at Rome as the enemy of God and man, who strangled Polyssena with a napkin, and gave poison to Ginevra d'Este in a cup of emerald, and in honour of a shameful passion built a pagan church for Christian worship; Charles VI, who had so wildly adored his brother's wife that a leper had warned him of the insanity that was coming on him, and who, when his brain had sickened and grown strange, could only be soothed by Saracen cards painted with the images of love and death and madness; and, in his trimmed jerkin and jewelled cap and acanthuslike curls, Grifonetto Baglioni, who slew Astorre with his bride, and Simonetto with his page, and whose comeliness was such that, as he lay dying in the yellow piazza of Perugia, those who had hated him could not choose but weep, and Atalanta, who had cursed him, blessed him.

0	Some day, when you are old and wrinkled and ugly, when thought has seared your forehead with its lines, and passion branded your lips with its hideous fires, you will feel it, you will feel it terribly.
0	Mabel, I have told you that I love you.
0	I had thrown her some flowers, and she had looked at me--at least I fancied that she had.
0	His body was found the next day by some goatherds, floating in a great pool of water, and was brought back by them to the cottage.
0	Life suddenly became fiery-coloured to him.
0	I see the people coming up from supper, and Englishmen always get romantic after a meal, and that bores me dreadfully.
0	He turned them out and, having thrown his hat and cape on the table, passed through the library towards the door of his bedroom, a large octagonal chamber on the ground floor that, in his new-born feeling for luxury, he had just had decorated for himself and hung with some curious Renaissance tapestries that had been discovered stored in a disused attic at Selby Royal.
0	From the point of view of form, the type of all the arts is the art of the musician.
0	Could she mock the eye, as she mocked the voice?
0	The only thing that at all consoled him in the whole affair was the fact that he had not brought his head with him, for, had he done so, the consequences might have been very serious.
0	The lad flushed up and, going to the window, looked out for a few moments on the green, flickering, sun-lashed garden.
0	To have been well brought up is a great drawback nowadays.
0	I'm sorry for that, for your sake.
0	I think you will tire first, all the same.
0	They are horrible, and they don't mean anything."
0	The Duke rose and kissed his wife lovingly.
0	I think to elope is cowardly.
0	"You gallop with a loose rein."
0	Indeed I am not sure that I quite know what Pessimism really means.
0	Yes, it is my will.
0	The whole thing is a second Panama, and with not a quarter of the chance of success that miserable affair ever had.
0	Steep yourself in the Language of grief, learn its utterance from Prince Hamlet and Queen Constance, and you will find that mere expression is a mode of consolation, and that Form, which is the birth of passion, is also the death of pain.
0	Gerald, I withdraw all my objections.
0	Of course she is not always to be relied upon.
0	I have put Mr. Ernest's things in the room next to yours, sir.
0	You are not going to be invited .
0	"You have not yet told me what your good action was.
0	They are like black caverns where dragons dwell.
0	‘After a few moments the captain of the guard dismissed the soldiers.
0	It is not in you, Dorian, to commit a murder.
0	It is too easy, because the requirements of the public as far as plot, style, psychology, treatment of life, and treatment of literature are concerned are within the reach of the very meanest capacity and the most uncultivated mind.
0	You will do this thing for me, Narraboth.
0	Three more months go over and my mother dies.
0	The only thing that one really knows about human nature is that it changes.
0	Its symbols must be of my own creating.
0	I shall probably go back to Court, for I know that I am destined to make a sensation in the world.” “I had thoughts of entering public life once myself,” remarked the Duck; “there are so many things that need reforming.

0	"I don't know how we could manage without him," answered the elder woman querulously.
0	Who would not be flippant when he is gravely told that the Greeks had no art-critics?
0	Our countrymen never recognize a description."
0	Wealth has given me enormous power.
0	Jim insisted that she should do so.
0	That is the one thing the modern woman never understands.
0	it is so easy to convert others.
0	So I am afraid I must leave you.
0	Then they sniffed up the air with their nostrils, and trotted off in the opposite direction.
0	Even those who hold that Art is representative of time and place and people cannot help admitting that the more imitative an art is, the less it represents to us the spirit of its age.
0	The English mind is always in a rage.
0	Strange were they to look at, and of curious beauty, and their beauty troubled him, and their odour was sweet in his nostrils.
0	I am very much gratified at Gerald Arbuthnot’s good fortune.
0	I usually am when Lord Illingworth says anything.
0	The seasons come and go in glad or saddening pageant, and with winged or leaden feet the years pass by before them.
0	Wherever he went the Sparrows chirruped, and said to each other, “What a distinguished stranger!” so he enjoyed himself very much.
0	That is their clumsy vanity.
0	But youth smiles without any reason.
0	Send me not away from thee now, for what evil have I done thee?’ And the young Fisherman laughed.
0	He was conscious also of the shallowness and vanity of his mother's nature, and in that saw infinite peril for Sibyl and Sibyl's happiness.
0	And yet, to bear you I had to look on death.
0	Indeed the most violent attack that was made on Shakespeare in his time was for his supposed caricature of Lord Cobham.
0	Don't flatter yourself, Basil:  you are not in the least like him."
0	You’ll come to lunch, of course, James.
0	And as I have mentioned the word labour, I cannot help saying that a great deal of nonsense is being written and talked nowadays about the dignity of manual labour.
0	Right in front of him he saw, in the wan moonlight, an old man of terrible aspect.
0	The prophet has prophesied it.
0	Women are a decorative sex.
0	It forgives everything except genius.
0	Do ye not see it?
0	I'm sure the programme will be delightful, after a few expurgations.
0	As a wicked man I am a complete failure.
0	It’s perfectly scandalous the amount of bachelors who are going about society.
0	We are clowns whose hearts are broken.
0	"Well, what night shall we go?"
0	We can talk over anything you like.
0	As long as I live, the personality of Dorian Gray will dominate me.
0	He is hard—he is hard.
0	‘Love is better than Riches,’ he cried, ‘and the little Mermaid loves me.’ ‘Nay, but there is nothing better than Riches,’ said the Soul.
0	Let us talk of some one else."
0	It has made gain not growth its aim.
0	My sermon on the meaning of the manna in the wilderness can be adapted to almost any occasion, joyful, or, as in the present case, distressing.
0	Therefore take thy half of the treasure and go from my city.” ‘“Nay,” I answered, “but I will take nought but that leaden ring, for I know what is written within it, and for what purpose.” ‘And the Emperor trembled, and besought me and said, “Take all the treasure and go from my city.
0	One should sympathise with the entirety of life, not with life’s sores and maladies merely, but with life’s joy and beauty and energy and health and freedom.
0	She was staying at Langton last autumn, when we were there.
0	"I am too shabby," he answered, frowning.
0	Those lovely links with humanity are broken.
0	I had no idea there were any flowers in the country.
0	Standing on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed in black silk, with a white cap and apron.
0	As a man sows so let him reap.
0	And his Soul mocked him and said, ‘Surely thou hast but little joy out of thy love.
0	A temperament capable of receiving, through an imaginative medium, and under imaginative conditions, new and beautiful impressions, is the only temperament that can appreciate a work of art.
0	It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances.
0	I should so much like to know her.
0	You spoke a little while ago of that fine spirit of choice and delicate instinct of selection by which the artist realises life for us, and gives to it a momentary perfection.
0	The world would have worshipped you, and you would have borne my name.
0	It is to the critical instinct that we owe each new school that springs up, each new mould that art finds ready to its hand.
0	It seemed to crush him.
0	Every year--every month, almost--men were strangled in England for what he had done.
0	Mallam, Maxbohm, Magley, what ghastly names they have--Markby, Migsby, Mobbs, Moncrieff!
0	Ah yes, he usually likes to spend his Sunday in London.
0	For twenty years, as you say, I have lived childless,—I want to live childless still.
0	He picked up crumbs outside the baker’s door when the baker was not looking and tried to keep himself warm by flapping his wings.
0	Wilt thou take the leper for thy bedfellow, and set the beggar at thy board?
0	They are forced to have more than one life.
0	I have known several Jacks, and they all, without exception, were more than usually plain.
0	For I have a new ideal, Harry.
0	Before him lay his shadow, which was the body of his soul, and behind him hung the moon in the honey-coloured air.
0	It was a lovely night, so warm that he threw his coat over his arm and did not even put his silk scarf round his throat.
0	I use the word in the sense of lost or mislaid.
0	Those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril.
0	In a very ugly and sensible age, the arts borrow, not from life, but from each other.
0	He told you, in my presence, when we were in Paris, that it was your duty to marry me.
0	I have been waiting for you there for an hour and three-quarters.
0	I know why I love him.
0	In Dorian's there was infinite pity.
0	I have jewels hidden in this place--jewels that your mother even has never seen; jewels that are marvellous.
0	That is a very different thing.
0	Come, dear, [Gwendolen rises] we have already missed five, if not six, trains.
0	But a man can’t stay always with his mother.
0	He did not belong to the Olympians, and had all the incompleteness of the Titan.
0	Tommy is a silly little ass.
0	I am a Liberal Unionist.
0	The sweet planet of Venus is full of lovers.
0	I am far too young.
0	_Suddenly voices are heard from the smoking-room_.
0	If he came to you himself and asked you to be his wife you would give him a different answer.
0	As soon as he was alone, he lit a cigarette and began sketching upon a piece of paper, drawing first flowers and bits of architecture, and then human faces.
0	But I have heard it said that Jokanaan himself is your prophet Elias.
0	Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little girl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom in her large blue eyes.
0	[_R.C._]  Mrs. Erlynne is coming here, and if you in any way annoy or wound her, you will bring shame and sorrow on us both.
0	The pain of Leopardi crying out against life becomes our pain.
0	But it is his love for you.
0	But here we have the room of a sweet saint.
0	"I am jealous of everything whose beauty does not die.
0	You haven’t told me her name yet!
0	For the time, we must think of nothing else, can think of nothing else, indeed.
0	They got restless, and began to talk loudly and to whistle.
0	The worship of the senses has often, and with much justice, been decried, men feeling a natural instinct of terror about passions and sensations that seem stronger than themselves, and that they are conscious of sharing with the less highly organized forms of existence.
0	They must never meet or touch again.
0	How little we have of this temper in England, and how much we need it!
0	Vileness is a terrible word, Lady Windermere.
0	"When an old woman like myself blushes, it is a very bad sign.
0	If he had lived, he would have made provision for us.
0	[LORD CAVERSHAM _goes out into the conservatory_.
0	I shall be late for lunch, if I stop any longer.
0	He remembered that the night before he had forgotten, for the first time in his life, to hide the fatal canvas, and was about to rush forward, when he drew back with a shudder.
0	I forget; but it is what Dorian Gray has been to me.
0	And her only child, too!
0	He always breaks his own.
0	No; there is no wind.
0	He may commit a sin against society, and yet realise through that sin his true perfection.
0	"We are very proud to-night," she sneered.
0	They have gone down into the depths.
0	she repeated, "and you must be happy, too!"
0	Extraordinary thing about the lower classes in England—they are always losing their relations.
0	What they call their loyalty, and their fidelity, I call either the lethargy of custom or their lack of imagination.
0	It won’t occur again, if I can help it.
0	Last night ’twas on my arm; I kissed it;     I hope it be not gone to tell my lord     That I kiss aught but he, says Imogen, jesting on the loss of the bracelet which was already on its way to Rome to rob her of her husband’s faith; the little Prince passing to the Tower plays with the dagger in his uncle’s girdle; Duncan sends a ring to Lady Macbeth on the night of his own murder, and the ring of Portia turns the tragedy of the merchant into a wife’s comedy.
0	He stopped and gave a peculiar knock.
0	And if they’re not married?
0	It was to tell him that he was engaged to be married to Sibyl Vane.
0	"Where shall we put it, sir?"
0	That is why he is so fascinating to artists.
0	Words have not merely music as sweet as that of viol and lute, colour as rich and vivid as any that makes lovely for us the canvas of the Venetian or the Spaniard, and plastic form no less sure and certain than that which reveals itself in marble or in bronze, but thought and passion and spirituality are theirs also, are theirs indeed alone.
0	"How horribly unjust of you!"
0	That scheme could never have my husband’s support.
0	And when the old Bishop saw him coming in his goatherd’s dress, he rose up in wonder from his throne, and went to meet him, and said to him, ‘My son, is this a king’s apparel?
0	What are you going to do?
0	But a truly great artist cannot conceive of life being shown, or beauty fashioned, under any conditions other than those that he has selected.
0	I wrote always three times a week, and sometimes oftener.
0	And yet it was a fact.
0	What has it to do with me?
0	Art, breaking from the prison-house of realism, will run to greet him, and will kiss his false, beautiful lips, knowing that he alone is in possession of the great secret of all her manifestations, the secret that Truth is entirely and absolutely a matter of style; while Life—poor, probable, uninteresting human life—tired of repeating herself for the benefit of Mr. Herbert Spencer, scientific historians, and the compilers of statistics in general, will follow meekly after him, and try to reproduce, in her own simple and untutored way, some of the marvels of which he talks.
0	It seems terrible to me now that they should ever be found together.
0	Yes, I felt it instinctively, but I couldn't wait all that time.
0	You filled me with a wild desire to know everything about life.
0	Then why do you let your son go with him?
0	She was familiar with the atmosphere.
0	The first is for the moment being done for us by Mr. Rudyard Kipling.
0	I can only afford them when I’m in debt.
0	I followed behind, and the negroes hurried their steps and scowled.
0	The drawback of stealing a thing, Mrs. Cheveley, is that one never knows how wonderful the thing that one steals is.
0	Of course, nations and individuals, with that healthy natural vanity which is the secret of existence, are always under the impression that it is of them that the Muses are talking, always trying to find in the calm dignity of imaginative art some mirror of their own turbid passions, always forgetting that the singer of life is not Apollo but Marsyas.
0	It is Literature that shows us the body in its swiftness and the soul in its unrest.
0	It is like a tomb.... [_To the soldiers._] Did you not hear me?
0	Yes, Ernest: the contemplative life, the life that has for its aim not _doing_ but _being_, and not _being_ merely, but _becoming_—that is what the critical spirit can give us.
0	Yes, they have a wonderful language.

0	It seemed to him that it was unchanged, and yet his loathing of it was intensified.
0	You fill me with horror.
0	So she comes first, you are worthy.
0	While I was in Wandsworth prison I longed to die.
0	"Oh, don't be so serious, Jim.
0	Weeks and weeks went on, and I grew more and more absorbed in you.
0	And if his work is incomprehensible, an explanation is wicked.
0	"Is it the real Dorian?"
0	"Yes," answered Lord Henry dreamily, "the costume of the nineteenth century is detestable.
0	Mr. Isaacs has been most considerate."
0	It is the cause of the terrible words that the prophet has spoken.
0	It used to remind me of those curious lines in some play--Hamlet, I think--how do they run?--     "Like the painting of a sorrow,      A face without a heart."
0	Mind, Harry, I trust you."
0	Crime in England is rarely the result of sin.
0	If he abandoned you, your place is with your child.

0	It was said that a stout Burgo-master, who had come to deliver a florid oratorical address on behalf of the citizens of the town, had caught sight of him kneeling in real adoration before a great picture that had just been brought from Venice, and that seemed to herald the worship of some new gods.
0	How horrible it was!--more horrible, it seemed to him for the moment, than the silent thing that he knew was stretched across the table, the thing whose grotesque misshapen shadow on the spotted carpet showed him that it had not stirred, but was still there, as he had left it.
0	It is not a very pleasant position for a young girl suddenly to find herself in.
0	I sent it to Lady Jedburgh’s with a note.
0	He heard Sir Geoffrey ask if the man was really dead, and the affirmative answer of the keeper.
0	It was a blow so appalling that I did not know what to do, so I flung myself on my knees, and bowed my head, and wept, and said, 'The body of a child is as the body of the Lord: I am not worthy of either.'
0	French songs I cannot possibly allow.
0	The sullen murmur of the bees shouldering their way through the long unmown grass, or circling with monotonous insistence round the dusty gilt horns of the straggling woodbine, seemed to make the stillness more oppressive.
0	Believe me, my dear Cyril, modernity of form and modernity of subject-matter are entirely and absolutely wrong.
0	In my time we girls saw them, of course, running about the place like rabbits.
0	Lord Henry's casual questioning had made him lose his nerve for the moment, and he wanted his nerve still.
0	She’s a very dangerous woman.
0	I am very fond of you, Cecily; I have liked you ever since I met you!
0	Will you not dance for me, Salomé?
0	Oh, that is nonsense; you are always talking nonsense.
0	Yes, she is a virgin.
0	Finally he succeeded, and nothing could exceed his disappointment.
0	And so that is your little boy!
0	You are remarkably modern, Mabel.
0	It is redder than the feet of him who cometh from a forest where he hath slain a lion, and seen gilded tigers.
0	But I will give them all to you.
0	Yes; I am always astonishing myself.
0	You don't really mind, Basil, do you?
0	“Romance is dead, Romance is dead, Romance is dead,” she murmured.
0	I wrote to my friend that evening about my views on John Bellini, and the admirable ices at Florian’s, and the artistic value of gondolas, but added a postscript to the effect that her double in the story had behaved in a very silly manner.
0	It was to Paris that Basil had gone, and by the midnight train, as he had intended.
0	"I am so sorry, Harry," he cried, "but really it is entirely your fault.
0	We have chains, though no eye beholds them; and are slaves, though men call us free.’ ‘Is it so with all?’ he asked, ‘It is so with all,’ answered the weaver, ‘with the young as well as with the old, with the women as well as with the men, with the little children as well as with those who are stricken in years.
0	Time is jealous of you, and wars against your lilies and your roses.
0	I believe I am usually right.
0	They were probably attired like Robin Hood’s men, to whom, indeed, they are compared in the course of the play.
0	In Falstaff there is something of Hamlet, in Hamlet there is not a little of Falstaff.
0	But there is no disgrace upon her.
0	The only way to behave to a woman is to make love to her, if she is pretty, and to some one else, if she is plain.
0	what a lot of harm you must have done, Robert!
0	But I know that as I worked at it, every flake and film of colour seemed to me to reveal my secret.
0	With your personality there is nothing you could not do.
0	I love not thy hair....
0	Virginia knelt down beside the skeleton, and, folding her little hands together, began to pray silently, while the rest of the party looked on in wonder at the terrible tragedy whose secret was now disclosed to them.
0	He came close to him and put his hand upon his shoulder.
0	I must say that it was high time, for all authority is quite degrading.
0	I have promised to look in at the Hartlocks’.
0	I dislike her more than I can say.
0	Is there a Mr. Erlynne—or is he a myth?
0	There is a soul in each one of us.
0	His primary desire was not to reform people, any more than his primary desire was to a relieve suffering.
0	[_Moves up C._] DUCHESS OF BERWICK.
0	I felt that I had fought the century with its own weapons, and won.
0	And his Soul said to him, ‘Take that silver cup and hide it.’ So he took the cup and hid it in the fold of his tunic, and they went hurriedly out of the city.
0	I have onyxes like the eyeballs of a dead woman.
0	You worshipped yourself too much.
0	Oh, do let me read them, Cecily?
0	Of course I won't look at it if you don't want me to," he said, rather coldly, turning on his heel and going over towards the window.
0	He swooped past the match-girl, and slipped the jewel into the palm of her hand.
0	The last time I saw her—twenty years ago, she was a fright in flannel.
0	And with Mrs. Allonby too!
0	[_Looks at_ MR. DUMBY _and exit_.]
0	that is well said, my daughter.
0	You see, it is simply a very young girl's record of her own thoughts and impressions, and consequently meant for publication.
0	History was entirely re-written, and there was hardly one of the dramatists who did not recognise that the object of Art is not simple truth but complex beauty.
0	‘Inside it is even as a bazaar.
0	It is well for our vanity that we slay the criminal, for if we suffered him to live he might show us what we had gained by his crime.
0	It is through its very incompleteness that art becomes complete in beauty, and so addresses itself, not to the faculty of recognition nor to the faculty of reason, but to the æsthetic sense alone, which, while accepting both reason and recognition as stages of apprehension, subordinates them both to a pure synthetic impression of the work of art as a whole, and, taking whatever alien emotional elements the work may possess, uses their very complexity as a means by which a richer unity may be added to the ultimate impression itself.
0	The bias of personal friendship precludes me from praising or defending "Salomé," even if it were necessary to do so.
0	Then the Swallow flew back to the Happy Prince, and told him what he had done.
0	She lives with her mother, a faded tired woman who played Lady Capulet in a sort of magenta dressing-wrapper on the first night, and looks as if she had seen better days."
0	If we wish to understand a nation by means of its art, let us look at its architecture or its music.
0	If we lived long enough to see the results of our actions it may be that those who call themselves good would be sickened with a dull remorse, and those whom the world calls evil stirred by a noble joy.
0	Why have you not told me about him?
0	Mr. Arbuthnot has a beautiful nature!
0	I have a country house with some land, of course, attached to it, about fifteen hundred acres, I believe; but I don't depend on that for my real income.
0	It was an unpleasant surprise.
0	Lady Chiltern, why are you playing Mrs. Cheveley’s cards?
0	I am not one of them.
0	The Critical Spirit and the World-Spirit are one.
0	They are open to your inspection, Lady Bracknell.
0	Wherefore did I give my oath?
0	He understood Christ, and so he became like him.
0	On the feast of the New Moon the young Emperor came forth from his palace and went into the mosque to pray.
0	We live, I regret to say, in an age of surfaces.
0	He held them up as examples to their elders, which I myself have always thought the chief use of children, if what is perfect should have a use.
0	If the country doesn’t go to the dogs or the Radicals, we shall have you Prime Minister, some day.
0	People say that the schoolmaster is abroad.
0	Well, what use is it to her?
0	Every serious Bunburyist knows that.
0	They move to their terrible end as automatons move.
0	All night long you must sing to me, and the thorn must pierce your heart, and your life-blood must flow into my veins, and become mine.” “Death is a great price to pay for a red rose,” cried the Nightingale, “and Life is very dear to all.
0	Mrs. Cheveley, you cannot be serious in making me such a proposition!
0	And those who saw Mr. Irving in the last act of _Richard the Third_ have not, I am sure, forgotten how much the agony and terror of his dream was intensified, by contrast, through the calm and quiet that preceded it, and the delivery of such lines as     What, is my beaver easier than it was?
0	I have always done so.
0	And when he came quite close his face grew red with anger, and he said, “Who hath dared to wound thee?”  For on the palms of the child’s hands were the prints of two nails, and the prints of two nails were on the little feet.
0	Besides, Lord Illingworth may marry any day.
0	I am a very remarkable Rocket, and come of remarkable parents.
0	It must be very unhealthy.
0	On the usual subject, Lady Stutfield.
0	I think myself, it is very much to be regretted.
0	Your influence would be bad.
0	You know you are lying.
0	The word _doctrinaire_--word full of terror to the British mind--reappeared from time to time between his explosions.
