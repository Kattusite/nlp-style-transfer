Some of them struck the sea and ricochetted , losing themselves in the distance .
" And that year , like every other year , ought to be divided into twelve months. " " Yes , certainly , if you wish it , " said the captain , acquiescing .
On the 7th of February he approaches King <NAME> 's <NAME> and runs to the east , where he soon sights the Cape of <NAME> of <NAME> , and the island named after that navigator .
