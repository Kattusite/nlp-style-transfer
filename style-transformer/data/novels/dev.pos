That part of the subject ( I reminded her ) involved matters which could form no part of my explanation , for they were the weighty secrets of another .
' <NAME> , my dear sir -- nobody ' s fat or old in <NAME> -- ath .
<NAME> <NAME> had brought it about , by aspiring to the high state and condition of being matrimonially engaged , without good grounds for so doing ; <NAME> had brought it about , by indulging in three motives of action : first , a desire to punish her friend for laying claim to a rivalship in dignity , having no good title : secondly , the gratification of her own vanity , in receiving the compliments of a smart young man : and thirdly , a wish to convince the corn-factor of the great danger he ran , in deferring the celebration of their expected nuptials ; while <NAME> had brought it about , by half an hour ' s gaiety and thoughtlessness , and a very sincere desire to avoid the imputation of inclining at all to <NAME> .
Yet when the night comes , <NAME> bursts out , father ! ' she answered , turning quickly .
' Why , I do declare , ' said <NAME> , standing opposite the door so as to get the earliest glimpse of the visitor , as he came upstairs , ' it ' s <NAME> !
The girl threw herself into a chair , with her back towards him : and wrung her hands ; but made no reply .
The <NAME> remained on his post for a few minutes , but , finding that there was no pause in the conversation inside , crept back again unheard , and stood , listening over the stair-rail , for a full hour .
Allowing a fellow that ' s found out , to discharge himself , is one thing ; discharging him for insolence and presumption , and likewise for designs upon his master ' s money , is another .
Now , my dear madam , I think you spoke of some clever personage .
' " No , there is not , " rejoined the guard coolly .
I seldom found that the places to which they belonged were locked , or that they were of any use except as a plaything for Jip -- but <NAME> was pleased , and that pleased me .
That you will never speak of it to <NAME> , whose chief happiness in this act of restitution is to do it secretly , unknown , and unapproved of : that only a very small part of the inheritance may be reserved to us , until Mr Dombey shall have possessed the interest of the rest for the remainder of his life ; that you will keep our secret , faithfully -- but that I am sure you will ; and that , from this time , it may seldom be whispered , even between you and me , but may live in my thoughts only as a new reason for thankfulness to <NAME> , and joy and pride in my brother. ' Such a look of exultation there may be on <NAME> ' faces when the one repentant sinner enters <NAME> , among ninety-nine just men .
' I am grieved to hear it .
<NAME> ! ' Such a cheer arose as the walls of <NAME> had never echoed before , and were destined never to respond to again .
" Now , <NAME> , " says <NAME> , urging a sensible view of the case upon him with his fat forefinger , " duty , as you know very well , is one thing , and conversation is another .
<NAME> ! ' A musical little voice answered , from somewhere upstairs , ' I am coming , grandfather ! ' and a pretty little girl with long , flaxen , curling hair , soon came running into the shop .
' I mean , are all these yours ? ' ' <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> , ' it is a true bill. ' ' And that eldest young gentleman , now , ' said my aunt , musing , ' what has he been brought up to ? ' ' It was my hope when I came here , ' said <NAME> , ' to have got <NAME> into the Church : or perhaps I shall express my meaning more strictly , if I say the Choir .
' -- and that his talent , combined with disappointment , ' Mrs <NAME> went on , ' has led him into a pursuit which -- ah dear me !
' Would you wish to commence with an <NAME> , sir -- from the Register ? ' ' <NAME> , ' said Mr Boffin , ' no , Wegg. ' With that , producing a little book from his breast-pocket , he handed it with great care to the literary gentlemen , and inquired , ' What do you call that , <NAME> ? ' ' This , sir , ' replied <NAME> , adjusting his spectacles , and referring to the title-page , ' is <NAME> ' s Lives and <NAME> of <NAME> .
After that day , a day rarely passed without her drawing the hammer on her slate , and without <NAME> 's slouching in and standing doggedly before her , as if he knew no more than I did what to make of it .
I should tell you that first. ' ' Then all I have to say about that is , ' interposed <NAME> , ' that I don ' t envy you your taste ; and that sitting in the same room with his very boots , would put me out of humour for a fortnight. ' ' In the main , ' said <NAME> , ' there may be no great difference of opinion between you and me , so far ; but you will understand , that I desire to confront him , to justify myself , and to cast his duplicity and malice in his throat. ' ' That ' s quite another matter , ' rejoined <NAME> .
Behold the vessels coming into port !
<NAME> is shyer than before .
Day was dawning when they again emerged .
<NAME> Leicester is quite well .
These sufficing , however , to inform the visitor that <NAME> and her birds are domiciled with a Mrs. Blinder , in <NAME> , he repairs to that neighbouring place , where <NAME> ( who rises early that she may be punctual at the divan of justice held by her excellent friend the Chancellor ) comes running downstairs with tears of welcome and with open arms .
This is what I meant when I brought him. ' ' Whereby , ' proceeded the voice , ' why not ?
Over against a <NAME> house , a corner house not far from <NAME> , a man with a wooden leg had sat for some years , with his remaining foot in a basket in cold weather , picking up a living on this wise : -- Every morning at eight o ' clock , he stumped to the corner , carrying a chair , a clothes-horse , a pair of trestles , a board , a basket , and an umbrella , all strapped together .
<NAME> <NAME> walked into the corner with much importance , and some wonder , and was honoured with a short whispering conference with the doctor , on the termination of which , he made a great many bows , and retired with steps of unusual stateliness .
I was a young boy , and she exasperated me , and I threw a hammer at her .

' " Ye were merry , daughters , " said the monk .
I mean to complain to your husband .
' <NAME> left a widow .
' <NAME> ' t deny it , <NAME> , in your obstinacy ; you know you might. ' Old <NAME> laughed , and said that she would take the letter and be thankful .
<NAME> ' t be alarmed , <NAME> my dear .
' No harm will come , no harm shall come , to its own darling , ' rejoined <NAME> .
I am as grateful to <NAME> , and as fond of <NAME> , as it ' s possible for any human being to be .
Try to hold me in your mind , at some quiet times , as ardent and sincere in this one thing .
Conscious of his elfin power and submitting to his dread experience , <NAME> consults him in the choice of that day 's banquet , turning an appealing look towards him as the waitress repeats the catalogue of viands and saying " What do YOU take , <NAME> ? "
Such a staircase , with its accessories , in the older and more crowded parts of <NAME> , would be bad enough now ; but , at that time , it was vile indeed to unaccustomed and unhardened senses .
<NAME> remained , pale and almost breathless , listening with quivering lip to the very audible expressions of scorn , of which the chaste housemaids were very prolific ; and of which they became still more so , when the man returned , and said the young woman was to walk upstairs .
The evening glided swiftly away , in these cheerful recreations ; and when the substantial though homely supper had been despatched , and the little party formed a social circle round the fire , <NAME> thought he had never felt so happy in his life , and at no time so much disposed to enjoy , and make the most of , the passing moment .
Still there was no reply , and still <NAME> stared about him , as did the greater part of the boys , who were by this time roused .
' Morals strictly attended to , though. ' ' Strictly , ' said <NAME> .
Mrs. <NAME> , my dear , will you sort the counters ? ' Mrs. <NAME> , with the assistance of <NAME> , ( who , as he performed sundry little acts of kindness for the children , at all times and seasons , was humoured in his request to be taken no notice of , and was merely spoken about , in a whisper , as the decayed gentleman ) , did as he was desired ; and the greater part of the guests sat down to speculation , while <NAME> himself , Mrs. <NAME> , and <NAME> of the <NAME> , looked after the supper-table .
<NAME> was close after him , caught him up in a few paces , and walked at his side .
He took up another that was lying by him , and asked what it was .
' She is ill , then ! ' said <NAME> .
Afterwards , when we were fairly at our work , I found <NAME> ' s efforts more troublesome to me than I had expected , as he had not confined himself to making numerous mistakes , but had sketched so many soldiers , and ladies ' heads , over the <NAME> ' s manuscript , that I often became involved in labyrinths of obscurity .
' Give us your hand , ' said <NAME> , advancing ; ' I should like to know you .
This gentleman is Mr Twemlow. ' The Jew turned to him and bowed .
They sat thus , until it grew late .
We have little doubt that we should have been enabled to present it to our readers , but for a most unfortunate occurrence .
' I shall be here in the morning to see you fairly off , ' said <NAME> .
<NAME> ' t I deserve even gratitude in return ? ' ' You ' re a deyvlish good fellow , ' said the poor young lord , taking his friend ' s arm .
' Well done , father , ' said <NAME> , ' take care , old fellow , or you ' ll have a touch of your old complaint , the gout. ' ' I ' ve found a sov ' rin ' cure for that , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , setting down the glass .
He can make all the letters separately , and he knows most of them separately when he sees them ; he has got on that much , under me ; but he ca n't put them together .
Ambitious projects trouble him no more .
I picture myself with my books shut up , still listening to the doleful performance of <NAME> , and listening through it to what used to be at home , and to the blowing of the wind on <NAME> flats , and feeling very sad and solitary .
' I must submit to you , <NAME> -- ' said <NAME> .
And so _he_ goes up the postern stair .

If I could have put the case more pleasantly I would ; but I hope I haven ' t put it very unpleasantly ; at all events I haven ' t meant to .
Fie upon you , you nasty creature ! ' ' Gracious ! ' cried <NAME> , almost paralysed by the violence with which the adjective had been jerked out from between <NAME> ' s closed teeth ; ' have I offended you ? ' ' <NAME> offended me ! ' retorted <NAME> , ' YOU !
Is it far from here ? "
At the <NAME> , the clerks discuss the great disaster in all its lights and shades , but chiefly wonder who will get Mr <NAME> ' s place .
<NAME> ' s mother ' s family had been very much offended with her for being poor , and broke with her for becoming comparatively rich .
Am I to lie here all my life , my father ? ' ' What do I know ! ' cried the jailer , turning upon him with southern quickness , and gesticulating with both his hands and all his fingers , as if he were threatening to tear him to pieces .
You don ' t believe -- I hope you don ' t really believe -- that I deserve to be cast off as I have been ; do you , miss ? ' ' I must believe it , ' returned the child .
' An accident going to the <NAME> ? ' he asked an old man beside him , who stood shaking his head , inviting conversation .
In remembrance of our long companionship ! ' He was silent ' Now , let me tell you , dear , ' quietly sitting by his side , ' I have , as you have , expected this ; and when I have been thinking of it , and fearing that it would happen , and preparing myself for it , as well as I could , I have resolved to tell you , if it should be so , that I have kept a secret from you , and that we have a friend. ' ' What ' s our friend ' s name , <NAME> ? ' he answered with a sorrowful smile .
<NAME> and myself , sir -- ' ' Nor to me , if you please , ' said I. <NAME> , without being at all discomposed , signified by a slight obeisance , that anything that was most agreeable to us was most agreeable to him ; and began again .
' Now , what would you give him ? ' inquired my aunt .
" Not so very long , <NAME> .
This time , you see , she will have the person and the property before her together , and will be able to make her choice with her eyes open .
It is a eye I never knew to fail with paupers .
Many a time of an evening , when I sat alone looking at the fire , I thought , after all there was no fire like the forge fire and the kitchen fire at home .
' I know of his brother , <NAME> , ' said the old woman , stretching out her neck with a leer of malice absolutely frightful , ' who might have been where you have been -- for stealing money -- and who lives with his sister , over yonder , by the north road out of London. ' ' Where ? ' ' By the north road out of <NAME> , deary .
For all his waywardness , he took great credit to himself as being determined to be in earnest " this time . "
<NAME> , it is closing in. ' Mr Flintwinch replied by directing a look of red vengeance at his wife , and then , as if to pinion himself from falling upon her , screwed his crossed arms into the breast of his waistcoat , and with his chin very near one of his elbows stood in a corner , watching <NAME> in the oddest attitude .
' There ' s a Church in <NAME> ; I may as well take that .
He had been enriching his medical attendant in the most lavish manner .
' Well , upon that understanding I ' ll tell you , ' replied the traveller .
' Now , there ' s an Enquiry in <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
It makes me shake from head to foot , to hear him give it her .
Every day. ' ' Ah , but you mean here , at your own home ? ' ' <NAME> couldn ' t spare me to go anywhere else , ' she answered , smiling and shaking her head .
' Shave you directly , <NAME> , ' said the visitor , drawing one of them back from the bed ' s head .
My house ain ' t much for to see , sir , but it ' s hearty at your service if ever you should come along with <NAME> ' r <NAME> to see it .
Who , if this were death , would be roused again to all the struggles and turmoils of life ; to all its cares for the present ; its anxieties for the future ; more than all , its weary recollections of the past !
<NAME> was more cheerful than intelligible .

Yer as good as there , ' said the long-legged tramper , pointing out before him .
But it is no. ' ' Is no short time necessary for reflection ; no weeks or days ? ' he asked , in the same half-suffocated way .
I had seen <NAME> bringing in papers and arranging them for <NAME> ; and he had seen me and made me a forlorn bow , which rendered me desirous to get out of the court .
Mrs. Bagnet , you 'll take care of my mother , I know ? "
And you know already that I have many extra expenses to meet just now .
" Oh , <NAME> , dear <NAME> ! " cried <NAME> , clapping her hands again .
But when little <NAME> saw his brother , and , thrusting his arms between the rails to hug him , found that he came no nearer , but still stood afar off with his head resting on the arm by which he held to one of the bars , he began to cry most piteously ; whereupon , <NAME> ' s mother and <NAME> ' s mother , who had restrained themselves as much as possible , burst out sobbing and weeping afresh .
As little Miss <NAME> was afraid of sleeping alone in the dark , <NAME> always made a point of driving her upstairs herself , like a sheep ; and it was cheerful to hear <NAME> moaning long afterwards , in the least eligible chamber , and <NAME> now and then going in to shake her .
<NAME> 's Narrative I had gone to bed and fallen asleep when my guardian knocked at the door of my room and begged me to get up directly .

Therefore I say , ' urged <NAME> , ' Go in and win ! ' ' But what of Go in and lose ? ' said <NAME> .
An evil star occasioned <NAME> to advert to her relations ; I reasoned with her on that subject , and remonstrated on the want of duty and devotion manifested in her allowing herself to be influenced by their jealous animosity towards her husband .
There were many classes of people here , from the labouring man in his fustian jacket , to the broken-down spendthrift in his shawl dressing-gown , most appropriately out at elbows ; but there was the same air about them all -- a kind of listless , jail-bird , careless swagger , a vagabondish who ' s-afraid sort of bearing , which is wholly indescribable in words , but which any man can understand in one moment if he wish , by setting foot in the nearest debtors ' prison , and looking at the very first group of people he sees there , with the same interest as <NAME> did .
I came here to-day to maintain it , and I ' ll come here again fifty times with the same object and always with the same success .
The <NAME> assisted in the conversation , like a regular member of the establishment .
He looked closer at the writing , looked at the man , took his hat from its peg , put the key of his door in his pocket , and they hurried away together .
" Do n't I know you , <NAME> !

I own to the weakness of objecting to occupy a ludicrous position , and therefore I transfer the position to the scouts. ' ' I wish , <NAME> , you would speak a little more soberly and plainly , if it were only out of consideration for my feeling less at ease than you do. ' ' Then soberly and plainly , <NAME> , I goad the schoolmaster to madness .
His few common tools and various scraps of leather were at his feet and on his bench .
<NAME> , I 'll put on my considering-cap , and I think all you want to do may be done by degrees .

And when , at last , in the pump-and-tub scene , <NAME> lighted the blue fire , and all the unemployed members of the company came in , and tumbled down in various directions -- not because that had anything to do with the plot , but in order to finish off with a tableau -- the audience ( who had by this time increased considerably ) gave vent to such a shout of enthusiasm as had not been heard in those walls for many and many a day .
' It may be , dear Little Dorrit. ' ' No .
After pausing for a few moments , with his hand upon the lock , he entered <NAME> ' s room , and confronted <NAME> .

The <NAME> customer paid for what he had had , perplexedly counted his change , and asked , as a stranger , to be directed towards the <NAME> .

' Now you know ; and that ' s all I have got to say. ' With which words she hurried into the house , as if to shake off the responsibility of my appearance ; and left me standing at the garden-gate , looking disconsolately over the top of it towards the parlour window , where a muslin curtain partly undrawn in the middle , a large round green screen or fan fastened on to the windowsill , a small table , and a great chair , suggested to me that my aunt might be at that moment seated in awful state .

They were very gay and careless .
' I think I had better say goodbye , at once. ' ' Not stop and -- rest ? ' said <NAME> , who seldom offered refreshments unless something was to be got by it .
I have judged for myself now , and am more than satisfied .
<NAME> <NAME> was not by any means the awful creature one might have expected , but a large , mild , smooth-faced man of sixty , who took so much snuff that there was a tradition in the <NAME> that he lived principally on that stimulant , having little room in his system for any other article of diet .
Then , indeed , does she captivate all hearts by her condescension , by her girlish vivacity , and by her skipping about as in the days when the hideous old general with the mouth too full of teeth had not cut one of them at two guineas each .
And you know what _their_ improvidence is , ma ' am .
<NAME> <NAME> took the opportunity of giving <NAME> a summary of the distresses of <NAME> and his sister ; the opportunity was quite long enough , as the hat happened to require a little extra fitting on .

" " Better , " I could not help saying , " to have left her a natural heart , even to be bruised or broken. " With that , <NAME> looked distractedly at me for a while , and then burst out again , What had she done !
It had such a prescriptive , stiff-necked , long-established , solemn , elderly air .

<NAME> , indeed , I am bound to do <NAME> the justice of saying , however inconsistent it may seem with her subsequent conduct ( which remains unchanged ) , that on my expressing my disapprobation and determination to her , with some severity , on the occasion to which I have referred , my admonition appeared to produce a very powerful effect.

So , he pushed open the door with the weak rattle in its throat , stumbled down the two steps , got past the two ancient cashiers , and shouldered himself into the musty back closet where <NAME> sat at great books ruled for figures , with perpendicular iron bars to his window as if that were ruled for figures too , and everything under the clouds were a sum .

While they were gone , <NAME> sat upon the table , holding Florence by the hand , and glancing timidly from the Doctor round and round the room , while the <NAME> , leaning back in his chair , with his hand in his breast as usual , held a book from him at arm ' s length , and read .
In the pale moonlight , which lent a wanness of its own to the delicate face where thoughtful care already mingled with the winning grace and loveliness of youth , the too bright eye , the spiritual head , the lips that pressed each other with such high resolve and courage of the heart , the slight figure firm in its bearing and yet so very weak , told their silent tale ; but told it only to the wind that rustled by , which , taking up its burden , carried , perhaps to some mother ' s pillow , faint dreams of childhood fading in its bloom , and resting in the sleep that knows no waking .

We have ever been far from wishing to obtrude ourselves on anyone .

When the pony-chaise stopped at the door , and my eyes were intent upon the house , I saw a cadaverous face appear at a small window on the ground floor ( in a little round tower that formed one side of the house ) , and quickly disappear .
You will excuse my wearing my hat , but the palace is damp , and the marble floor is -- if I may be allowed the expression -- sloppy. ' As a precaution against this latter inconvenience , Mr <NAME> had been sitting for some time with his feet on the hob , in which attitude he now gave utterance to these apologetic observations , and slowly sipped the last choice drops of nectar .
' But I shall confide in you , just the same , <NAME> .
So there I sat , not knowing where to look -- for wherever I looked , I knew <NAME> 's eyes were following me -- and thinking of the dreadful expense to which this young man was putting himself on my account .
Having made this grand point , he wandered into a denser haze and maze of nonsense than even a mayor might have been expected to disport himself in , and came out of it with the brilliant discovery that to take the life of a fellow-creature was to take something that didn ' t belong to you .

More than an hour had passed , and they were even dozing , when one of the three -- each said it was he , and he had <NAME> dozed -- made out Riderhood in his boat at the spot agreed on .
<NAME> <NAME> was very eloquent ; but perhaps I may venture to say , without ill-nature , that he rather monopolised the occasion .

<NAME> buttoned his coat with a determined air .
At length <NAME> , with a coffee-cup in his hand , began to hover about among the pictures , and to cause an interesting speculation to arise in all minds as to the probabilities of his ceasing to hover , and enabling the smaller birds to flutter up-stairs ; which could not be done until he had urged his noble pinions in that direction .
After the removal of the cloth , and the singing of <NAME> ( beautifully executed , and in which we were at no loss to distinguish the bell-like notes of that gifted amateur , <NAME> MICAWBER , <NAME> , <NAME> ) , the usual loyal and patriotic toasts were severally given and rapturously received .

In the morning , when Mr <NAME> was at his breakfast in one or other of the two first-mentioned of them , as well as in the afternoon when he came home to dinner , a bell was rung for <NAME> to repair to this glass chamber , and there walk to and fro with her young charge .
And you will ask him not to hate me ? ' With a mournful shake of the head , as if that would be quite a superfluous entreaty , <NAME> lovingly kissed her two hands to her friend , and her friend ' s two hands were kissed to her ; and then she saw a third hand ( a brown one ) appear among the flowers and leaves , and help her friend out of sight .
What ' s your name now , -- P ? ' said my aunt , as a compromise for the obnoxious appellation .
' My dear Mortimer , you are the express picture of contented industry , reposing ( on credit ) after the virtuous labours of the day. ' ' My dear <NAME> , you are the express picture of discontented idleness not reposing at all .
" You with a pleasant home ? " said <NAME> .
It seemed that Mr <NAME> had been standing with his hands in his pockets looking carelessly at the pony , and occasionally insulting him with such admonitions as ' <NAME> still , ' -- ' Be quiet , ' -- ' Woa-a-a , ' and the like , which by a pony of spirit can not be borne .
They ain ' t <NAME> , or Hair-Washes , or Invigorating <NAME> , to be puffed in that way ! ' Having delivered himself of these remarks , Mr <NAME> took a trot , according to his usual custom , and trotted back to the spot from which he had started .
And he sent his love to me , did he ?
' You asked me something , ' he said then .

If anyone had told me , then , that all this was a brilliant game , played for the excitement of the moment , for the employment of high spirits , in the thoughtless love of superiority , in a mere wasteful careless course of winning what was worthless to him , and next minute thrown away -- I say , if anyone had told me such a lie that night , I wonder in what manner of receiving it my indignation would have found a vent !

All the children of the village , and most of the women , were admiring these sable warders and the closed windows of the house and forge ; and as I came up , one of the two warders ( the postboy ) knocked at the door , -- implying that I was far too much exhausted by grief to have strength remaining to knock for myself .
He says it is nothing to speak of ; which I can confirm , if that is any consolation ; but he recommended , to-day , sea-air .
<NAME> <NAME> , we are not too late again ! ' ' We can not be , ' said Mr Garland .
Come here , sir ! ' The cherub , to his genial amusement , was accordingly conducted to a little washing-room , where <NAME> soaped his face and rubbed his face , and soaped his hands and rubbed his hands , and splashed him and rinsed him and towelled him , until he was as red as beet-root , even to his very ears : ' Now you must be brushed and combed , sir , ' said <NAME> , busily .
Our conference being now ended , and everything arranged , I rose to go ; remarking to <NAME> that he and I had better not go home together , and that I would take half an hour 's start of him .
' There ' s a gentleman in the parlour that ' s ordered a hot beef-steak pudding and potatoes , at nine .

Impelled by such reflections , he grasped his carpet-bag , and creeping stealthily downstairs , shut the detestable street door with as little noise as possible , and walked off .
Now and then , when they pass a police-constable on his beat , <NAME> notices that both the constable and his guide fall into a deep abstraction as they come towards each other , and appear entirely to overlook each other , and to gaze into space .

' He has no right to think that I ' d be led away to go to him , sir , ' said <NAME> , turning round again after half a minute ' s hammering .
<NAME> Mr Toots , left to himself , lay down upon the sofa , little thinking who had reclined there last , and , gazing up at the skylight and resigning himself to visions of <NAME> , lost all heed of time and place .
" And I 'll tell you where from .

However , as he is now gone so far away and for an indefinite time , and as he will have good opportunities and introductions , we may consider this past and gone .
I was on the point of asking him if he knew me , when he tried to stretch out his arm , and said to me , distinctly , with a pleasant smile : ' <NAME> is willin ' ! ' And , it being low water , he went out with the tide .

Mr <NAME> not receiving his remarks with anything like enthusiasm , his employer turned his eyes to his face , and observed that it wore a troubled expression .
<NAME> <NAME> ' s father , being a <NAME> farmer , would have furiously laid about him with a flail , a pitch-fork , and every agricultural implement available for assaulting purposes , on the slightest hint of his son ' s having written a play .

Now , he must be precious old , you know , and he has not a soul about him , and he is reported to be immensely rich ; and whether he is a smuggler , or a receiver , or an unlicensed pawnbroker , or a money-lender -- all of which I have thought likely at different times -- it might pay you to knock up a sort of knowledge of him .

They may vary it with fever and ague , or with as many rheumatic variations as they have joints ; but positively not with entertainment after their own manner .
After the lapse of an hour , a bit of fish and a steak was served up to the travellers , and when the dinner was cleared away , <NAME> and <NAME> drew their chairs up to the fire , and having ordered a bottle of the worst possible port wine , at the highest possible price , for the good of the house , drank brandy-and-water for their own .

I assure you , most exemplary !
Death of my soul , I love the sweet lady ! ' Mrs Clennam ' s face had changed .
Perils were closing round her , and the circle was fast darkening , when I -- being as you have said , sir , too old and broken to be suspected of any feeling for her but a father ' s -- stepped in , and counselled flight .
With this view , his intention was to print a declaration to the foregoing effect , which he had already drawn up ; and , besides circulating it among all who had dealings with the <NAME> , to advertise it in the public papers .

I found the courts of law here , just the same as at <NAME> ; the public institutions almost as good .
My mother put her hands upon my lips to stop me .
DO you hear him say he ' ll humour <NAME> ? ' ' Tim , ' said <NAME> and <NAME> together , ' pray , <NAME> , pray now , don ' t.

I did it for the love of you .
Wititterly , ' said her husband , addressing himself to Mrs. Nickleby , ' is sought after and courted by glittering crowds and brilliant circles .
He is a wonderfully accomplished man -- most extraordinarily accomplished -- reads -- hem -- reads every novel that comes out ; I mean every novel that -- hem -- that has any fashion in it , of course .
Stop at the next inn , and call out for a glass of hot brandy and water. ' It was in vain for <NAME> ' s mother to protest that she stood in need of nothing of the kind .
But she seemed to be everywhere .
'There is nothing very alarming in his appearance .
' <NAME> ' t grieve for that now. ' ' -- My daughter , ' faltered the old woman , ' my gal who ' ll soon get better , and shame ' em all with her good looks. ' Alice smiled mournfully at <NAME> , and fondled her hand a little closer , but said nothing .

' <NAME> designed no revision of this extraordinary quotation from the <NAME> , but Mr <NAME> felt it necessary to offer a few polite remarks .

The two out-door boys went upon the staircase to put on their half-boots and pull the in-door boy 's hair , as I judged from the nature of his objections .

When little Em ' ly grew more courageous , and talked ( but still bashfully ) across the fire to me , of our old wanderings upon the beach , to pick up shells and pebbles ; and when I asked her if she recollected how I used to be devoted to her ; and when we both laughed and reddened , casting these looks back on the pleasant old times , so unreal to look at now ; he was silent and attentive , and observed us thoughtfully .
" To -- do you mean to the young fellow who 's in it ? " he asked , in reply .
In this light it was clearly understood by the other party , who immediately replied with great approbation , ' You quite enter into my feelings , ma ' am , and it ' s jist what I ' d do myself. ' ' But you have no call to do it , ' said <NAME> .

' Have I called you down from the stars ? ' ' No , ' he answered .
What can I have to do with the name ?

The old man who had been standing by the door in one attitude during the whole interview , looking at the mother up-stairs as he had looked at the son down-stairs , went out at the same time , and , after a longer absence , returned with another tray on which was the greater part of a bottle of port wine ( which , to judge by his panting , he had brought from the cellar ) , a lemon , a sugar-basin , and a spice box .
' A man does get more way upon himself , perhaps , in his conversation , when he sits down .
' She will miss it when she wakes .

There has been a delay. ' ' Not that it is of consequence , ' said <NAME> .

If you refer to the presence of any visitor you have here -- I say , if you refer to that , ' answered <NAME> , jerking his head with emphasis towards his shoulder nearest <NAME> , ' I see ! ' ' Is that all you say ? ' ' That ' s all I say .
Mrs <NAME> had some such thoughts too , but they were not so quietly developed in her mind .
Not , you see , to look at. ' ' Not azackly , ' observed <NAME> .
We journeymen must take jobs when we can get them .
Our poor brother <NAME> ' s death has cancelled that. ' ' We had not , ' said <NAME> , ' been in the habit of frequent association with our brother <NAME> ; but there was no decided division or disunion between us .
That gentleman took it up , and read as follows : -- ' Our obscure and filthy contemporary , in some disgusting observations on the recent election for this borough , has presumed to violate the hallowed sanctity of private life , and to refer in a manner not to be misunderstood , to the personal affairs of our late candidate -- aye , and notwithstanding his base defeat , we will add , our future member , <NAME> .
There was yet another circumstance which went a long way to confirm <NAME> in her fears , though it was not a great circumstance in itself .
<NAME> both , and sorely puzzled too , to find out what they seek .
Then why not have it : especially when our friend <NAME> here would profit by it too ?
' Now then , ' said <NAME> , who had been assisting Mrs. Grudden in the preparations , which were on a more extensive scale than was quite agreeable to the collector .
Undeserving as he was , and little as he thought of all these agonies that it cost me -- agonies which should have made him wholly and gratefully mine to his life ' s end -- I loved him .
' I can ' t see you running into danger , through carrying your head so high .
It was at a distance towards the east , but it was long and loud .
I may claim to have felt it , at least as much as anybody else ; and I would fain be remembered kindly for my part in the experience .
' She ' s at -- at <NAME> , I suppose ? ' -- getting out the name of the obnoxious conventicle with some reluctance , and laying a spiteful emphasis upon the words .
At the same time—not to deceive you—I believe I am worthy of her .
<NAME> Pickwick himself continued to reside in his new house , employing his leisure hours in arranging the memoranda which he afterwards presented to the secretary of the once famous club , or in hearing <NAME> read aloud , with such remarks as suggested themselves to his mind , which never failed to afford <NAME> great amusement .
The messenger fortunately found <NAME> in court , regaling himself , business being rather slack , with a cold collation of an Abernethy biscuit and a saveloy .
He dreams that the footsteps die away into distance of time and of space , and that something touches him , and that something falls from his hand .
<NAME> speck as it was in the wide prospect , it made the sunrise a more cheerful sight , and gave to it that sort of human interest which it seems to want at sea .
" Let me hope a moment !
I had scarcely thought it a reservation a few hours ago , but now that it was gone I felt as if I understood its nature better .
<NAME> <NAME> did not remain long in the background after they had reached the drawing-room , for Dr Blimber had him out in no time , dancing with <NAME> .
" Do you know the <NAME> 's , in the next street but one , at the corner ? "
Sometimes he would ask her for herself .
She stood by the table so perfectly composed and still after this acknowledgment of his remark that Mr <NAME> stared at her under a sort of fascination , and could not even look to <NAME> to make another move .
It was not until every preparation was made for <NAME> ' s immediate removal that <NAME> broke silence by declaring she should not be taken away .
I cry chorus to the T ' otherest. ' ' What turn , ' said <NAME> , with an effort at self-repression that forced him to wipe his face , ' did his insolence take to-day ? ' ' It took the turn , ' answered <NAME> , with sullen ferocity , ' of hoping as I was getting ready to be hanged. ' ' Let him look to that , ' cried <NAME> .
<NAME> Leicester is bound to believe a pair of ears that have been handed down to him through such a family , or he really might have mistrusted their report of the iron gentleman 's observations .
' They are here now , ' said <NAME> , rising and hurrying away .
cried <NAME> , calling downward to a boy in Sunday clothes , who perhaps had loitered in to look about him .
They passed the whole of Sunday with him , and generally rode out before dinner ; and on these occasions Mr <NAME> seemed to grow , like <NAME> ' s assailants , and instead of being one man in buckram , to become a dozen .
' " Remaining always , & c. & c. , <NAME> MICAWBER. " ' Much affected , but still intensely enjoying himself , <NAME> folded up his letter , and handed it with a bow to my aunt , as something she might like to keep .
If it could not be done with <NAME> ' s sanction and concurrence , I besought a clandestine interview in the back kitchen where the <NAME> was .
I have often recalled that cheerful party to my pleasant recollection since , and shall not easily forget , in junketings nearer home with friends of older date , my boon companions on the <NAME> .
' I am here by myself , myself .
If her mother ' s consolations could have restored her to a pleasanter and more enviable state of mind , there were abundance of them to produce the effect .
All is told. ' ' Will you please tell me , ' said <NAME> , taking the paper with a prettily knitted brow , but not opening it : ' whether I am right in what I am going to say ?
Come ! ' ' I never heard it said , <NAME> , ' returned the <NAME> .
I should say , now , that the stage , or the -- or the army , Mr <NAME> -- or something very superior in the licensed victualling way -- was the kind of thing that would call out the genius of such a man as you .
The dog has his likings and dislikings , and <NAME> is no great favourite of his ; but I am sure you will give him a character , <NAME> , for never having been like this before. ' <NAME> was too much disturbed to say anything connected in reply ; <NAME> was already occupied in soothing her ; <NAME> , who had cried out twice or thrice , held <NAME> ' s arm for protection ; Lion , deeply ashamed of having caused them this alarm , came trailing himself along the ground to the feet of his mistress .
I believe I don ' t look it. ' ' Indeed you do not , ' said <NAME> , shaking her head and the great green fan together , for emphasis .
What a rusty portion of a boiler and a great iron wheel or so meant by lying half-buried in the dealer ' s fore-court , nobody seemed to know or to want to know .
' I hope she steered herself , skiffed herself , paddled herself , larboarded and starboarded herself , or whatever the technical term may be , to the ceremony ? ' proceeds the playful Tippins .
Oh , don ' t , my dear ! ' ' When <NAME> meets , I say , ' he went on , after waiting until my mother was silent , ' with a base return , that feeling of mine is chilled and altered. ' ' Don ' t , my love , say that ! ' implored my mother very piteously .
I acknowledge -- let me be open -- that it is my failing to be the creature of impulse , and to wear my heart as it were , outside .
' _I_ pray to Heaven it may turn out so ! ' repeated <NAME> .
But he ' ll soon be home for good , now .
An operation which , taken in connexion with the bushy eyebrows and the <NAME> nose , suggested with some liveliness the idea of a hawk engaged upon the eyes of a tough little bird .
They spoke in high praise of the honourable conduct of Messrs. <NAME> and <NAME> , the attorneys for the plaintiff , did they ? ' ' Yes , ' said <NAME> , ' they said what a wery gen ' rous thing it was o ' them to have taken up the case on spec , and to charge nothing at all for costs , unless they got ' em out of <NAME> Pickwick. ' At this very unexpected reply , the spectators tittered again , and <NAME> & <NAME> , turning very red , leaned over to <NAME> , and in a hurried manner whispered something in his ear .
Affectionately and sorrowfully , T.C. ' With this missive ( which I was in twenty minds at once about recalling , as soon as it was out of my hands ) , the ticket-porter at last departed .
If anything could have added to the interest of this agreeable scene , it would have been the remarkable fact of <NAME> ' s appearing without his gaiters , for the first time within the memory of his oldest friends .
I am pretty well known .
That very popular trust in flat things coming round !
' Is it , indeed ? ' rejoined <NAME> .
' I -- hem ! -- I can ' t think , <NAME> , what has given <NAME> offence .
Nor was the young lady herself at all behind-hand in displaying her choicest allurements ; but these , heightened as they were by the artifices of <NAME> , had no effect whatever in increasing the attentions of <NAME> , who , with the precedent of <NAME> still fresh in his memory , steadily resisted every fascination , and placed so strict a guard upon his behaviour that when he had taken his leave the ladies were unanimous in pronouncing him quite a monster of insensibility .
When we came to the usual place of meeting -- it was close by , and <NAME> had often accompanied me before -- my guardian was not there .
I ' m surprised to hear it. ' Despite his presence of mind , however , the speech of Mr F. ' s <NAME> produced a depressing effect on the little assembly ; firstly , because it was impossible to disguise that <NAME> ' s unoffending head was the particular temple of reason depreciated ; and secondly , because nobody ever knew on these occasions whose <NAME> was referred to , or what spectral presence might be invoked under that appellation .
I put up my trembling little hand to clasp hers or to beg her pardon with what earnestness I might , but withdrew it as she looked at me , and laid it on my fluttering heart .
But you and I have done one another some good , <NAME> , -- at all events , you have done me good , my dear ; and division must not come between us , at this time of day. ' ' Division between us ! ' cried I .
I think I should feel as if the name had become endeared to me , and I had no right to use it so. ' ' And that ' s your opinion ? ' remarked Mr Boffin , observant of the Secretary ' s face and again addressing him .
My aunt , though I saw that her shrewdest observation was concentrated on her new guest , had more useful possession of her wits than either of us ; for she held him in conversation , and made it necessary for him to talk , whether he liked it or not .
Furious with terror , he raised his stick , and struck <NAME> a heavy blow across the face .
At the same moment , a small boy clung tight round his leg , and a shrill cry of ' Here he is , father !
The matter of fact , is , that the matron was in no way overpowered by <NAME> 's scowl , but , on the contrary , treated it with great disdain , and even raised a laugh thereat , which sounded as though it were genuine .
' Twelve year , ' replied the cobbler , biting the end of his pipe as he spoke .
' I had conquered it , knowing that it _must_ be conquered , and had come to the resolution to think no more about it .
She sat upright in her arm-chair , with a stately , immovable , passionless air , that it seemed as if nothing could disturb .
That ' s the way it works. ' ' It would be a good thing for me , if I could see things in the calm light you do , Mr Wegg. ' ' Again look here , ' pursues <NAME> , with an oratorical flourish of his pipe and his wooden leg : the latter having an undignified tendency to tilt him back in his chair ; ' here ' s another observation , Mr Venus , unaccompanied with an objection .
That ' s my view of the matter , <NAME> Pickwick. ' ' It is a very philosophical one , ' replied <NAME> .
What could <NAME> do ?
' Here ' s wishing of her back agin. ' Polly cried more than ever at this .
To keep Mrs. Sparsit ' s ears as far off as possible , I expect. ' With her hand upon her brother ' s shoulder , <NAME> still stood looking at the fire .
' I know you are unhappy , and have got into great trouble by bringing me away .
I hated her then , quite as much as I hate her now ; and naturally , therefore , could desire nothing better than that she should marry him .
Well ; I got the better of it , and went on sorting , and went on singing to myself .
' For well I know , sir , ' Mr Wegg would add , ' that a man of your delicate mind would wish to be checked off whenever the opportunity arises , and it is not for me to baulk your feelings. ' A certain rustiness in Mr Venus , which never became so lubricated by the oil of Mr Wegg but that he turned under the screw in a creaking and stiff manner , was very noticeable at about this period .
In the coarse familiarity of their approach , and the effrontery of their inquisitiveness ( which they are in great haste to assert , as if they panted to revenge themselves upon the decent old restraints of home ) , they surpass any native specimens that came within my range of observation : and I often grew so patriotic when I saw and heard them , that I would cheerfully have submitted to a reasonable fine , if I could have given any other country in the whole world , the honour of claiming them for its children .
You know I stood between you and his father so long , that it seems as if death had made no difference , and I was still standing between you .
' The house with the red door , cabmin .
' One of them things that young men do when they get married , ' returned <NAME> ; ' and as runs through with their money like nothing at all !
If my brother had been a man of activity and prudence , he might have left you a rich woman , ma ' am : and if he had turned his son into the world , as my father turned me , when I wasn ' t as old as that boy by a year and a half , he would have been in a situation to help you , instead of being a burden upon you , and increasing your distress .
Go it , <NAME> ! ' ' What you may mean , <NAME> , by your omnibus-driving expressions , I can not pretend to imagine .
And now you must tell me , dearest Ma and <NAME> , upon your words and honours !
<NAME> Matrimonial <NAME> sat in the corner of the darkened room in the great arm-chair by the bedside , and <NAME> lay tucked up warm in a little basket bedstead , carefully disposed on a low settee immediately in front of the fire and close to it , as if his constitution were analogous to that of a muffin , and it was essential to toast him brown while he was very new .
There ! ' With this handsome offer , <NAME> once more threw himself back in his chair , and looked like a man who had been most profligately liberal , but is determined not to repent of it notwithstanding .
' He bust out a-cryin ' , <NAME> , and said you wos wery gen ' rous and thoughtful , and he only wished you could have him innockilated for a gallopin ' consumption , for his old friend as had lived here so long wos dead , and he ' d noweres to look for another. ' Poor fellow , poor fellow ! ' said <NAME> .
' They brighten at the sight of you , ' returned <NAME> .
' <NAME> down , ' said <NAME> , turning towards him , as though by a violent effort .
I hope it was not a poor thing in me to wish to be a little more used to my altered self before I met the eyes of the dear girl I longed so ardently to see , but it is the truth .
He had come straight away from his work , on being written to , and had walked the whole journey ; and was on his way to <NAME> ' s country house after dark , when he fell .
I am going to speak upon another subject , a confidential subject , <NAME> .
May I speak out , among friends ?
The placid look at the white ceiling came back , and passed away , and his head dropped quietly on his breast .
I confess that I looked upon this as a very painful exhibition , and one by no means flattering to the national standard of honesty and honour .
<NAME> ' t take any notice of it , ' said <NAME> , peeping in from the bedroom .
' The fact is , it ain ' t a Hall , ' observed <NAME> drily .
And hadn ' t <NAME> ' s cause to bless itself for their all going together once a quarter -- to the pit -- and didn ' t <NAME> ' s mother always say , when they painted the outside , that <NAME> ' s last treat had helped to that , and wonder what the manager would feel if he but knew it as they passed his house !
' We are all as happy as possible ! ' said <NAME> .
The responsibility of giving the lady away devolved upon the <NAME> , which led to the clergyman 's being unintentionally scandalized , and it happened thus .
He was reconciled to what had happened , and went down again quite happy .
To make these dwellings as habitable and full of comfort as they could , was now their pleasant care .
Have the goodness to confine your dealings strictly to trade and business , and not to travel beyond it .
Official sentiments are one thing .
' Dear Pa , if you knew how much I think this morning of what you told me once , about the first time of our seeing old Mr <NAME> , when I stamped and screamed and beat you with my detestable little bonnet !
Really the time is come ( we being at present all mixing ourselves up with what oughtn ' t to be ) , when <NAME> must be told that this was full as plain to everybody as the sun , before <NAME> went to <NAME> ; that <NAME> made excuses to come back , for nothing else ; and that he ' s always here , for nothing else .
' But I say yes , ' returned his friend .
<NAME> as <NAME> , boy ! ' said <NAME> , taking snuff from a round box on the table , and laughing heartily .
<NAME> would see that the boys were fond of him ; and that would make her happy .
' Mr Dombey , ' pursued <NAME> , smoothing the rosy hue upon her cheeks , ' accordingly repeated his visit ; and possibly finding some attraction in the simplicity and primitiveness of our tastes -- for there is always a charm in nature -- it is so very sweet -- became one of our little circle every evening .
I merely confer with you , on the painful necessity you find yourself under , of depriving this young man of the great advantages of your counsel and instruction. ' ' It is very lamentable , sir , ' <NAME> represented .
' Assuredly , <NAME> is an oracle !
He can speak of nothing else .
' ( <NAME> ) I ask your pardon , sir , ' said Mr Chivery in a secret manner ; ' but which way might you be going ? ' ' I am going over the Bridge. ' He saw in Mr Chivery , with some astonishment , quite an Allegory of <NAME> , as he stood with his key on his lips .
Did you ever taste beer ? ' ' I had a sip of it once , ' said the small servant .
Perhaps -- who shall decide on such mysteries ! -- he was afraid that he might come to hate her .
' I ' m a bacheldore. ' ' A bachelor ! ' I said , astonished .
' Why would you ? ' ' If you please , sir , I am very fond of flowers , ' returned the girl .
He was familiar with him , in the very extremity of his sense of the distance between them .
pointing in the direction of the rag and bottle shop .
" I should like to walk a little , " says my Lady , still looking out of her window .
' You come on business , sir .
' It is still the truth , <NAME> , and my mind is lighter when I think of him for that which made it so much heavier then. ' He checked himself in his tone of melancholy , and smiled upon her as he said ' Good-bye ! ' ' Good-bye , dear <NAME> !
' A very judicious arrangement , ' observed <NAME> with a sneer , ' if your husband will keep within it , ma ' am -- as no doubt he will. ' ' Demmit ! ' exclaimed <NAME> , opening his eyes at the sound of <NAME> ' s voice , ' it is a horrid reality .
" You do n't object to him , little woman ? "
' Let ' s hear what <NAME> did. ' He did not appear to have hidden anything , so went off rather flatly .
Mr <NAME> ? ' ' Perfectly , sir , ' returned Mr Sparkler .
The gluttony of <NAME> is put before us , as an example to the young. " ( I thought this pretty well in him who had been praising up the pork for being so plump and juicy . )
' I told you before , ' replied <NAME> , 'that I was afraid to speak to you there .
' I think they must certainly come to-morrow , eh mother ? ' said <NAME> , laying aside his hat with a weary air and sighing as he spoke .
' You ' ll excuse me , <NAME> , ' said Mr Toots , holding his forehead , ' but I ' m at present in that state that my brain is going , if not gone , and anything approaching to politeness in an individual so situated would be a hollow mockery .
Mr <NAME> replies to Cook , far be it from him to stand in the way of that good feeling which he could wish to see ; and adjourning in quest of the housemaid , and presently returning with that young lady on his arm , informs the kitchen that foreigners is only his fun , and that him and <NAME> have now resolved to take one another for better for worse , and to settle in <NAME> Market in the general greengrocery and herb and leech line , where your kind favours is particular requested .
' To be sure you didn ' t , ' said the little old man ; ' of course not .
<NAME> <NAME> , and his young client , and several blue bags hastily stuffed out of all regularity of form , as the larger sort of serpents are in their first gorged state , have returned to the official den .
' We shall soon find out whether he is or not. ' The unfortunate youth had only interchanged a dozen words with <NAME> , that gentleman having implored him to make a private appeal to some friend to release him , and then pushed him out with the snuff- box , lest his prolonged absence should lead to a discovery .
The coach was punctual to the time appointed ; and <NAME> , after duly installing <NAME> and <NAME> inside , took his seat on the box by the driver .
croaked the Jew , in his usual voice .
retorts <NAME> with a steadfast look , but without loss of temper .
' There were three things , ' said <NAME> , ' that I thought I would like to say , if you were alone and I might come up-stairs .
He is not hungry , Mrs. Bedwin , ' said the gentleman : looking very wise .
You know how sensitive I am to unkindness .
' And very much to be deplored it was , on all accounts !
<NAME> , bespeaking his good lady 's attention , proceeded to enlighten her relative to the arrangement he had made , with all that haughtiness and air of superiority , becoming , not only a member of the sterner sex , but a gentleman who appreciated the dignity of a special appointment on the kinchin lay , in <NAME> and its vicinity .
Not such power of wind has blown for many a winter night .
The milkman , after shaking his head at her darkly , released her chin , and with anything rather than good-will opened his can , and deposited the usual quantity in the family jug .
' But , first and foremost , <NAME> , burn the box .
' O , pray don ' t punish him any more , ' cried <NAME> .
We don ' t want any documents .
' Here ' s sport ! ' he cried , ' sport ready to my hand , all invented and arranged , and only to be enjoyed .
The family room looked very small and very mean , and the downward staircase by which it was attained looked very narrow and very crooked .
I couldn ' t see Mr Gills , could I ? ' said Mr Toots ; ' because -- ' ' If you could see <NAME> , young gen ' l ' m ' n , ' said the <NAME> , impressively , and laying his heavy hand on Mr Toots ' s knee , ' old <NAME> , mind you -- with your own eyes -- as you sit there -- you ' d be welcomer to me , than a wind astern , to a ship becalmed .
' I couldn ' t write like that , now-a-days .
To give himself up to being put in the way of arning a good living and getting on , he must give me up .
' Peek -- christian name ; Weeks -- surname ; good , ver good .
Try the antidote , ' rejoined <NAME> ; ' and may it give you a brighter and better view of the case !
" Then here 's your hat , " returns his new friend , quite as intimate with it as if he had made it ; " and if you 're ready , I am . "
" How do you manage , <NAME> , " said I , " to learn everything that I learn , and always to keep up with me ? " I was beginning to be rather vain of my knowledge , for I spent my birthday guineas on it , and set aside the greater part of my pocket-money for similar investment ; though I have no doubt , now , that the little I knew was extremely dear at the price .
The trial came on at once , and , when he was put to the bar , he was seated in a chair .
' Jupiter ! ' exclaimed <NAME> , ' what an unsophisticated shepherd you are , <NAME> !
She had a curious propensity to call Mrs. Bounderby ' Miss Gradgrind , ' and yielded to it some three or four score times in the course of the evening .
' He does not seem to see us .
Or that night , when I frowned at him ?
' " Will you never love any one but me -- never marry any one beside ? " said the young lady .
' I didn ' t do anything in particular , ' said <NAME> .
I wonder who ! ' ' Is it not very likely that some lady has been taken by him , and that he may love her dearly ? ' ' Perhaps .
However , men always think they know best .
It was a weak fancy perhaps , the childish fancy of a young and lonely creature ; but night after night , and still the sisters loitered in the same place , and still the child followed with a mild and softened heart .
I simply request you to care about nothing -- or seem to care about nothing -- as everybody else does. ' ' Do I ever say I care about anything ? ' asked Mr Merdle .
Sometimes she ' s proud and won ' t touch it for a length of time ; sometimes she ' s so poor that she must have it .
' You shall not escape me in this way , you morose backwoodsman , ' retorts <NAME> .
To <NAME> 's horror , looking back , he saw the last of the land , a frightful range of rocks , behind them ; and his ears were deafened by the thundering of water , as it rolled and roared , and raged among the dreadful caverns it had worn , and fiercely tried to undermine the earth .
It matters little to me where I live , and I had a desperate hope that some intelligence might be cast in my way there , which would not reach me elsewhere .
' The next I make for you , I hope will be made less clumsily .
' Good master ? ' inquired <NAME> .
' -- Has vispered to me , ' resumed his father , ' that it vould be better to dewote the liquor to vishin ' you success and prosperity , and thankin ' you for the manner in which you ' ve brought this here business through .
Both of us did business with him .
Why , from you. " " I never told you. " " Told me !
<NAME> in <NAME> , one of the great lords in power at the Court , held his fortnightly reception in his grand hotel in <NAME> .
To this rumour <NAME> always returned a stout denial , which he accompanied , however , with a lurking grin , that rendered the suspicious doubtful , and fully confirmed all previous believers .
As to this point , and as to some minor topics , there are differences of opinion ; but it is perfectly clear to the brilliant and distinguished circle , all round , that nobody is in question but <NAME> and his retinue , and <NAME> and HIS retinue .
He needed some such touch then .
But I know what I have seen , and what I have looked in the face in this world here , where I find myself .
There was a kettle on the hob , as there had been night and day for fifteen years .
The <NAME> have been , as usual , indefatigably dealing dinner cards to <NAME> , and whoever desires to take a hand had best be quick about it , for it is written in the <NAME> of the <NAME> that Veneering shall make a resounding smash next week .
It is singularly well conducted by <NAME> , a comic actor of great quiet humour and originality , who is well remembered and esteemed by <NAME> playgoers .
He had not expected that the house would wear any different aspect -- had known indeed that it could not -- but coming upon it in the midst of eager thoughts and expectations , it checked the current in its flow , and darkened it with a mournful shadow .
What did you expect me to do ?
It will naturally be very painful to him to find that you are singular in your character and conduct .
You have regularly given me up .
Also that I can accept no second or inferior position .
No man 's life here is worth purchase .
So they told him yes again .
' He don ' t seem to care about his dress , ' thought <NAME> , ' and yet how capitally he does it .
So goes the wintry day outside the <NAME> mansion .
' If you please. ' ' Or would next day , ' said Mr Dombey , ' suit your engagements better ? ' ' I have no engagements .
' It was <NAME> who did that , I KNOW , ' said <NAME> predictively .
Thank you , thank you. ' He felt that it was better to respect her entreaty , and did not move while her slight form went quickly away from him .
<NAME> down , sir. ' ' Would any other gen ' l ' man like to ask me anythin ' ? ' inquired <NAME> , taking up his hat , and looking round most deliberately .
said <NAME> , stirring his tea , and looking up into the matron 's face ; 'are _you_ hard-hearted , Mrs .
I am going there now for my lesson .
" Very good ; I see by these portraits that you take a strong interest in the fashionable great , sir ? "
<NAME> answered the summons , and <NAME> raised his eyes stealthily to his face , as if he almost feared to read there , a knowledge of his recent thoughts .
<NAME> unknowns , amazed to find how intimately they know Veneering , pluck up spirit , fold their arms , and begin to contradict him before breakfast .
' No , I do not indeed , ' replied <NAME> .
' You were speaking about its being a girl , ' said <NAME> .
But as to advising or encouraging or occupying a serious station towards anybody or anything , it is simply not to be thought of in such a child as <NAME> . "
' These are my holidays. ' ' Are they , by <NAME> ! ' muttered <NAME> , with his eyes on the passion-wasted face .
' I 'll run all the way , sir . '
<NAME> Leicester and the baronetcy , <NAME> and <NAME> , <NAME> and his ancestors and his patrimony " -- <NAME> very dry here -- " are , I need not say to you , <NAME> , inseparable . "
His face grew purple ; his eyes were starting from his head , and with protruded tongue , he seemed to mock me .
With all her perfections on her head , my <NAME> has come up from her place in <NAME> ( hotly pursued by the fashionable intelligence ) to pass a few days at her house in town previous to her departure for <NAME> , where her ladyship intends to stay some weeks , after which her movements are uncertain .
Many thousands are in want of common necessaries ; hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts , sir . "
I say 'Mighty potentate , here IS my homage !
That the hope of giving birth to a new partner in such a <NAME> , could not fail to awaken a glorious and stirring ambition in the breast of the least ambitious of her sex .
' Mind you don ' t break out again , you villain , ' said <NAME> , looking sternly at him , ' or I ' ll make faces at you and throw you into fits , I will .
" And what wind , " said <NAME> , " blows you here , <NAME> ? " Though she looked steadily at me , I saw that she was rather confused .
After casting about for some time for a name which should be worthy of her , he decided in favour of <NAME> , as being euphonious and genteel , and furthermore indicative of mystery .
" Go before me and show me all those dreadful places .
Was it an unequal marriage in point of years , this unlucky job of yours ? ' said <NAME> .
The effort of resolution necessary to the achievement of this purpose I found to be quite awful .
Both said that the trade , the manufactures , the commerce , the prosperity of <NAME> , would ever be dearer to their hearts than any earthly object ; and each had it in his power to state , with the utmost confidence , that he was the man who would eventually be returned .
But prominent in it was a draped table with a gilded looking-glass , and that I made out at first sight to be a fine lady 's dressing-table .
<NAME> it. ' The topic was so disagreeable to him , and so put his usual liveliness to the rout , that <NAME> forbore to press him further : the rather as the tea had been drawing for some time on the hob .
<NAME> had the honour to support her , and <NAME> was placed upon the chairman ' s right ; the <NAME> and the <NAME> sustained the vice .
If she were to try one , she would find her teeth in her way , modelling that action of her face , as she has unconsciously modelled all its other expressions , on her pattern of sordid age .
The news is -- ' ' <NAME> ? ' interrupted <NAME> .

To the best of my understanding , and bad 's the best , you 'll tell me , " said <NAME> , softened by the tone of the apology , " he is afraid of the whole subject. " " Afraid ? " " It 's plain enough , I should think , why he may be .
And few people knew of it .
'Come here , you born devil !
It is not in my power to retrace , one by one , all the weary phases of distress of mind through which I passed .
' Let us begone from this place , and never turn back or think of it again .
' You remember the night of our first tea-drinking ? ' said <NAME> .
You must know that I have done no good this long time .
When I came down again , I found <NAME> and <NAME> sweeping up , without any other traces of discomposure than a slit in one of <NAME> 's nostrils , which was neither expressive nor ornamental .
As you have been found in company with this woman ; as you were detected in possession of this document ; as you were engaged with her in fraudulently destroying others , and can give no satisfactory account of yourself ; I shall remand you for a week , in order that inquiries may be made , and evidence got .
I won ' t be led on into a discussion .
My dear friend , can I ever repay you ? ' ' <NAME> ' t talk of it , ' replied <NAME> .
A dog growled as he touched the handle of a room-door ; and a man 's voice demanded who was there .
I have never seen her yet .
' Ah ! ' said the dwarf , who with his hand stretched out above his eyes had been surveying the young man attentively , ' that should be your grandson , neighbour ! ' ' Say rather that he should not be , ' replied the old man .
' You ' re too milk and watery with our friend , you are indeed , ' remonstrated <NAME> , with a disapproving shake of his wooden head .
' You are going through , sir ? ' said the coachman .
I was hungry , but before I had swallowed a morsel , he began a running sum that lasted all through the breakfast .
' I hate him. ' ' What do you hate him for , my dear ? ' asked Squeers .
<NAME> had him down , and his knee was on his throat , when <NAME> pulled him back with a look of alarm , and pointed to the window .
The narrow streets and courts , at length , terminated in a large open space ; scattered about which , were pens for beasts , and other indications of a cattle-market .
Mrs Chick and <NAME> , who had brought them down on the previous night ( which they all passed at an Hotel ) , had just driven away from the door , on their journey home again ; and <NAME> , with her back to the fire , stood , reviewing the new-comers , like an old soldier .
' In-deed ! ' ' He has just been speaking to me , ' said <NAME> , in breathless explanation .
One of these double knocks at <NAME> ' s door , announced the equipage of some great lady -- or rather rich one , for there is occasionally a distinction between riches and greatness -- who had come with her daughter to approve of some court-dresses which had been a long time preparing , and upon whom <NAME> was deputed to wait , accompanied by <NAME> , and officered of course by <NAME> .
Well , <NAME> , that as I was mentioning is what they 're up to . "
Even then , I did exercises for other boys , and seldom did my own. " " And why not ? " " God knows .
At any rate , you know it now .
He faintly moaned , " I am done for , " as the victim , and he barbarously bellowed , " I 'll serve you out , " as the murderer .
' I am going out for a constitutional , ' resumed <NAME> ; ' and while I am gone , that is to say in the interval between this and breakfast , <NAME> , I wish you to read over what I have marked in these books , and to tell me if you quite understand what you have got to learn .
This done very rapidly , she kissed his disfigured forehead , looked up in anguish to the stars , and blessed him and forgave him , ' if she had anything to forgive. ' It was only in that instant that she thought of herself , and then she thought of herself only for him .
says <NAME> , opening another door and glaring in with his bull's-eye .
' But mark ! ' she added , slowly and sternly , opening the other door to go away , ' I am resolved , for reasons that I have and hatreds that I entertain , to cast you out , unless you withdraw from my reach altogether , or drop your pretty mask .
<NAME> <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , stamping first her right foot and then her left with remarkable energy , ' I have never in all that time , till now , been exposed to the arts , the vile arts , of a creature , who disgraces us with all her proceedings , and makes proper people blush for themselves .
<NAME> <NAME> , after glancing at the official cat who is patiently watching a mouse 's hole , fixes his charmed gaze again on his young client and proceeds in his buttoned-up , half-audible voice as if there were an unclean spirit in him that will neither come out nor speak out , " What are you to do , sir , you inquire , during the vacation .
The helpless kind of candour with which he presented this before us , the light-hearted manner in which he was amused by his innocence , the fantastic way in which he took himself under his own protection and argued about that curious person , combined with the delightful ease of everything he said exactly to make out my guardian 's case .
' I know it must sound foolish , and yet it is so. ' ' Where did you think you saw them ? ' ' I don ' t know that I think I saw them anywhere .
' Have you any little thing of that kind in hand , sir ? ' inquired the favoured gentleman in blue , drawing a toothpick from his waistcoat pocket .
It is my bounden duty to you .
And now they had come to the time when they must beg their bread .
' To the old country , sir , ' I rejoin .
" What is the matter with you ? "
Mr Witherden , sir , a kind of faintness is upon my spirits -- if you would do me the favour to ring the bell and order up a glass of something warm and spicy , I shall , notwithstanding what has passed , have a melancholy pleasure in drinking your good health .
In giving Mrs. Bagnet 's hand , with her work in it , a friendly shake -- for she took her seat beside him -- the trooper 's attention is attracted to her face .
And does it seem to me that I am about to deprive <NAME> of his share in such possessions , which are his only birthright ! '
<NAME> , ' said <NAME> , at the expiration of a few minutes .
' And so your preparations are nearly finished at last , my dear <NAME> ? ' said <NAME> , when the dessert was put upon the table , and the silver-headed butler had withdrawn .
" <NAME> ? " echoed my sister ; " trouble ? " and then entered on a fearful catalogue of all the illnesses I had been guilty of , and all the acts of sleeplessness I had committed , and all the high places I had tumbled from , and all the low places I had tumbled into , and all the injuries I had done myself , and all the times she had wished me in my grave , and I had contumaciously refused to go there .
This seemed to have been her principal inducement , originally , for taking up her residence there .
If it 's not in any way disagreeable to you , you 'll oblige me by doing the same .
' I think I remember having had a few interviews like that , with ladies out of doors .
repeats <NAME> with awful politeness .
' I believe that boy strews the ground differently every day , on purpose to bruise and maim one ; unless his master does it with his own hands , which is more than likely .
I shall not be missed ! ' Mrs <NAME> rose erect with these words , and took the arm of Mr Chick , who escorted her from the room , after half an hour ' s shady sojourn there .
At last , <NAME> having departed , we three were one afternoon going out for a ride ; and I , being dressed before <NAME> and going down , came upon my guardian , with his back towards me , standing at the drawing-room window looking out .
" They 'll do as they are ?
But as you wisely pointed out to me , I can ' t do that , for it would look like guilt .
<NAME> <NAME> still walking up and down when Mrs. <NAME> had done , <NAME> addressed that maligned old lady : ' I am surprised , madam , ' he observed with severity , ' that in your old age you have the face to claim <NAME> for your son , after your unnatural and inhuman treatment of him. ' ' _Me_ unnatural ! ' cried poor old Mrs. Pegler .
' If it really was a party ! ' she thought once , as she sat there .
Since you are bent upon it , _very_ well ! ' So , <NAME> and his daughter took <NAME> off with them to <NAME> , and on the way <NAME> never spoke one word , good or bad .
Then says he , lifting up his eyebrows in the gayest way , 'It 's no use mentioning a fypunnote to me , my friend , because I 'm a mere child in such matters and have no idea of money . '
Whether his spirits were elevated by the communication I had made to him , or by his having indulged in this retrospect , I don ' t know ; but they were raised by some influence .
<NAME> <NAME> that their political opinions are identical .
" And now you ! " said <NAME> , suddenly stopping , and turning on the two women with the shawls , from whom the three men had meekly separated , -- " Oh !
There is the <NAME> , who is Providence to five hundred thousand men .
In the main street of <NAME> , on the left-hand side of the way , a short distance after you have passed through the open space fronting the <NAME> , stands an inn known far and wide by the appellation of the <NAME> <NAME> , rendered the more conspicuous by a stone statue of some rampacious animal with flowing mane and tail , distantly resembling an insane cart-horse , which is elevated above the principal door .
There being not the least constraint in his manner , there was none ( or I think there was none ) in mine .
' We shall go by the stage-coach .
Upon this , the young gentleman with the pipes came round him , and shook both his hands very hard -- especially the one in which he held his little bundle .
' Not what enough ? ' said <NAME> .
' They ' re usually kept in carawans to wait upon the dwarfs , ' said Mr Vuffin .
When he came to the low church wall , he got over it , like a man whose legs were numbed and stiff , and then turned round to look for me .
As he evidently has a rooted feeling on this point , and as the depth of it is recognized in Mrs. Bagnet 's face , his mother yields her implicit assent to what he asks .
'The will , ' said <NAME> , speaking for him , 'was in the same spirit as the letter .
You ' d better not keep on pulling his ears , please .
<NAME> <NAME> was copying music ( I recollect , it was a new song , called ' Affection ' s <NAME> ' ) , and <NAME> was painting flowers .
Now , let us see whether there ' s anything else the matter , and how our ribs are ? ' There was nothing else the matter , and our ribs were sound .
' Girl number twenty , ' said the gentleman , smiling in the calm strength of knowledge .
The poor people were so neat and clean , and knelt so reverently in prayer , that it seemed a pleasure , not a tedious duty , their assembling there together ; and though the singing might be rude , it was real , and sounded more musical ( to <NAME> 's ears at least ) than any he had ever heard in church before .
' Why shouldn ' t he ? ' A murmur of assent ran through the company .
After a minute ' s pause , during which he had been looking down upon the gentle patient little face moving on at his side , he said , ' The strangest man , Mr Carker the <NAME> is , <NAME> , that ever you heard of .
Any police down there ? ' ' Here , <NAME> , ' was official rejoinder .
There were many women at that time , upon whom the time laid a dreadfully disfiguring hand ; but , there was not one among them more to be dreaded than this ruthless woman , now taking her way along the streets .
' My darling <NAME> , you must really come and kiss me once more , if you please , my dear ! ' Singular coincidence , that these gushes of interest in <NAME> hurried <NAME> away from almost every dialogue in which <NAME> had a share , however trifling !
Of these , the Jew was , at all events , sufficiently remarkable to be remembered , supposing he had been seen drinking , or loitering about ; but <NAME> returned without any intelligence , calculated to dispel or lessen the mystery .
Their sloping ceilings , cumbrous rusty locks and grates , and heavy wooden bins and beams , slowly mouldering withal , had a prisonous look , and he had the haggard face of a prisoner .
' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , gently , ' I am not quite well , and I have been weeping .
'Indeed you may believe me .
Catching up from the table a piece of bread , and taking his <NAME> ' s bundle under his arm , <NAME> immediately followed him .
But coming to the door , I found him waiting there ; and he said was I coming back again , and I said yes ; and he said did I know you , and I said , yes , I had the pleasure of your acquaintance -- you had given me the pleasure of your acquaintance , after some persuasion ; and he said , if that was the case , would I say to you what I have said , about existing circumstances and coming prepared , and as soon as ever I saw you , would I ask you to step round the corner , if it was only for one minute , on most important business , to Mr <NAME> ' s the <NAME> ' s .
" I am much obliged to you .
No relief or security from him for a moment .
Are we pretty fresh and cheerful sir -- eh , Mr <NAME> ? ' ' Pretty well , sir , ' replied <NAME> .
' Oh , ask your friend to come here , <NAME> , ' said Mrs. <NAME> .
' I am deeply sensible of it. ' ' In this position of affairs , ' said <NAME> , again referring to her notes , ' and admitting his visits on this understanding only , we must require from <NAME> a distinct assurance , on his word of honour , that no communication of any kind shall take place between him and our niece without our knowledge .
Before it is possible to make any arrangement at all compatible with this novel state of things , the ship rights .
He is not ' brought down , ' these observers think , by sorrow and distress of mind .
' Dear me ! ' said <NAME> ; ' what an extraordinary hand ! ' It was directed to himself , was written upon very dirty paper , and in such cramped and crippled writing as to be almost illegible .
' There is no teaching here , I suppose ? ' ' There has been , ' said Mrs. Crummles .
' And to think of <NAME> and <NAME> , and who <NAME> can be , ' said <NAME> ; ' delightful man no doubt and married perhaps or perhaps a daughter , now has he really ?
Little <NAME> is coming , and will find me in the dark. ' Mr <NAME> lighted the candle briskly , and said as he put it down upon the table : ' What are you going to do with <NAME> ?
Moreover , he had the appearance of a perfect ability to go on all night ; or , if occasion were , all next day and all next night ; whereas Mr Blandois soon grew indistinctly conscious of swaggering too fiercely and boastfully .
The rain fell heavily , drearily .
That Mrs <NAME> had always sat at the head of his table , and done the honours of his house in a remarkably lady-like and becoming manner .
When they had hooks they _would_ hang themselves , so they ' re taken out of every cell , and there ' s only the marks left where they used to be ! ' The prison-yard in which he pauses now , has been the scene of terrible performances .
When I told him No , he said she must have gone down then , and yet she " took up too , " when she left there .
' The ride will do his master good , at all events , ' observed my aunt , glancing at the papers on my table .
They most willingly and cheerfully do their duty to all of us who are employed here , and we try to do ours to them .
Always the identical same. ' ' It doesn ' t taste so .
As my mother stooped down on the threshold to take me in her arms and kiss me , the gentleman said I was a more highly privileged little fellow than a monarch -- or something like that ; for my later understanding comes , I am sensible , to my aid here .
<NAME> 's is so great apparently , " mutters the trooper , stroking his chin , " that I have as good as half a mind to go back again .
I stopped at the last full stop to read all this over .
<NAME> <NAME> looked very hard at the man ' s face , but his features were immovable , so he noted down the fact forthwith .
As he threw his head back in the chair , his glance happened to rest upon a bell , a disused bell , that hung in the room , and communicated for some purpose now forgotten with a chamber in the highest story of the building .
<NAME> <NAME> said , " Very much so . "
In the momentary firmness of the hand that was never still -- a firmness inspired by the utterance of these last words , and dying away with them -- I saw the confirmation of her earnest tones .
<NAME> and ruin came on me , I say .
' It will amuse me. ' ' Oh !
On <NAME> calling aloud for <NAME> , a short , bustling , over-dressed female , full of importance , presented herself , and all the young ladies suspending their operations for the moment , whispered to each other sundry criticisms upon the make and texture of <NAME> ' s dress , her complexion , cast of features , and personal appearance , with as much good breeding as could have been displayed by the very best society in a crowded ball-room .
I thought she had had some fear that her unhappy father might be in some way to blame for what had happened .
' I should have been very sorry not to have been at home when you and <NAME> went away , sir , ' rejoined <NAME> .
' We ' re sure to catch them , I think , ' said he .
'No other , take my word for it . '
<NAME> , I beg to request the favour of a private interview. ' ' Why , <NAME> , ' returned the <NAME> , taking him by the hand , ' you are the man as we was on the look-out for. ' ' Oh , <NAME> , ' said Mr Toots , ' what a look-out that must be , of which I am the object !
It 's only me as is written to .
' This is strange news , ' said <NAME> .
But such an old card as this , so deep , so sly , and secret ( though I do n't believe he is ever sober ) , I never came across .
He was the dead image of the sun in old woodcuts , his hair and whiskers answering for rays all around him .
<NAME> <NAME> 's mother was so diverted that she rolled her head as she smiled and made a silent appeal to <NAME> with her elbow .
' I ' m a heavy sleeper , ' said <NAME> , as he flung himself on the bed .
I shall bring a few little books , if you ' ll allow me , and some work , and of an evening now and then , they ' ll learn -- dear me , they ' ll learn a great deal , I trust , and be a credit to their teacher. ' Mr Toodle , who had a great respect for learning , jerked his head approvingly at his wife , and moistened his hands with dawning satisfaction .
They are waiting till I shall want the gentleman to show himself somewhere , for half a moment. ' ' While they ' re waiting , ' said <NAME> , ' couldn ' t you join us ? ' Mr Inspector immediately slipped into the bar , and sat down at the side of the half-door , with his back towards the passage , and directly facing the two guests .
<NAME> crosses and comes halting and shuffling up , slowly scooping the knuckles of his right hand round and round in the hollowed palm of his left , kneading dirt with a natural pestle and mortar .
I beg -- nay , command ! -- that you will not pounce .
The work went on , until the noon-bell rang .
' It ' s some boarding-school in this town , I suppose , ain ' t it ? ' Now , although this question was put in the most careless tone imaginable , <NAME> plainly showed by gestures that he perceived his new friend ' s anxiety to draw forth an answer to it .
But I never will desert <NAME> .
Is it there ? ' ' Here it is ! ' said I .
The boat floated into the wharf to which it belonged .
Shall I say anything for you ? ' ' <NAME> , <NAME> , ' replied Mr Toots indistinctly , ' that I shall think of her every day , but never without feeling happy to know that she is married to the man she loves , and who loves her .
It ' s down my throat again and can ' t come up .
' Off at once , ' replied <NAME> .
I 'm a soldier 's wife and accustomed to travel my own way .
Yes , let us go now .
There was no harm in his trade .
And , considering that the hour-glass they turned from year to year was filled with the earthiest and coarsest sand , the Bleeding Heart Yarders had reason enough for objecting to be despoiled of the one little golden grain of poetry that sparkled in it .
' I can never be grateful enough to you , <NAME> , I am sure , ' said <NAME> , with the sweetest smile imaginable .
But as the <NAME> appeared to be of quite another opinion , and was bent upon it , and as his friendship was too zealous and serious to be trifled with by one so much younger than himself , he forbore to hint the least objection .
However , <NAME> kept him up pretty well , by jerking the rein , and plying the whip ; and when these means failed , and the animal came to a stand , the elder <NAME> got out and kicked him .
" Why , they killed him , " says <NAME> , " on account of his having so much cheek .
Sit down , my beloved. ' She would have gone once more—was all but gone—and once more his face , darkly threatening what would follow if she went , has stopped her .
Do you know what you 're doing ? '
' Now , I ' m a going upstairs to tell your aunt as <NAME> ' r <NAME> ' s here , and that ' ll cheer her up a bit , ' he said .
' Did he say whether he had any business to speak about ? ' inquired <NAME> , after a little impatient consideration .
<NAME> alone , Mr <NAME> locked his outer door , and came back to his fire .
' So am I , <NAME> , ' rejoined <NAME> .
I have been in prison for threatening the solicitor .
' Why the fact is , ' replied Mr Toots , ' that it ' s the young woman I come from .
Still , when you say there is no change for the better , I must , as a bare matter of fact , deny that . "
The waiter retired ; the breakfast concluded ; and the travellers ascended to their respective bedrooms , to prepare a change of clothing , to take with them on their approaching expedition .
I think we had better leave him behind ? ' My aunt seemed disposed to contest the point ; but to facilitate matters I said I would gladly remain behind , if they pleased ; and returned into <NAME> ' s office , where I sat down again , in the chair I had first occupied , to await their return .
oh dear , oh dear , what an edged tool you are ! ' ' <NAME> ' t play with me then , ' said <NAME> impatiently .
( " I really think this must be a man ! " was <NAME> 's breathless reflection , simultaneously with his coming against the wall . )
'Oh , I dare say about that , yer know , ' observed <NAME> , backing towards the door , and shaking his head with a kind of sober alarm .
I want to speak to <NAME> , quite alone. ' I promise that she shall , immediately ; but I can not leave her , for my grief .
The furniture , at once spare and lumbering , hid in the rooms rather than furnished them , and there was no colour in all the house ; such colour as had ever been there , had long ago started away on lost sunbeams -- got itself absorbed , perhaps , into flowers , butterflies , plumage of birds , precious stones , what not .
Yet , no one had followed them , and no man spoke when they entered the wine-shop , though the eyes of every man there were turned upon them .
The looms , and wheels , and <NAME> all out of gear for an hour .
The <NAME> is about to bow to the bar when the prisoner is presented .
Beguiling the time with these pleasant reflections , <NAME> wended his way , through mud and mire , to his gloomy abode : where the <NAME> was sitting up , impatiently awaiting his return .
' <NAME> ' t ye be timorous for me , my dear , ' said the stanch old heart , observant of <NAME> ' s face : ' when I take my seat with my work , clean and busy and fresh , in a country market-place , I shall turn a sixpence as sure as ever a farmer ' s wife there. ' The Secretary took that opportunity of touching on the practical question of Mr <NAME> ' s capabilities .
Why , I recollect old <NAME> quite a little boy , don ' t you ?
<NAME> <NAME> departed upstairs on his errand , and immediately returned with a message that <NAME> would see <NAME> in five minutes ; and having delivered it , returned again to his desk .
I resolved that they should not know .
Cut me off a piece of that pie , one of you boys , to take the taste of that out of my mouth , or it 'll choke me dead . '
Come and see us. ' ' Oh , it ' s of no consequence , thank you ! ' Mr Toots would blushingly rejoin .
The astonished listener remained motionless on his post for some minutes afterwards , and having ascertained , with many cautious glances round him , that he was again alone , crept slowly from his hiding-place , and returned , stealthily and in the shade of the wall , in the same manner as he had descended .
' I wish it was <NAME> , sir , ' said <NAME> .
' I would rather he thought well of me , ' said <NAME> , ' though he swept the street for bread , than that you did , though you splashed the mud upon him from the wheels of a chariot of pure gold. -- There ! ' ' Well I ' m sure ! ' cried Mr Boffin , staring .
It ' s very cheap. ' The old man , notwithstanding his fatigue , would have remained in the churchyard all night if his new acquaintances had remained there too .
What matter , my dear ? ' ' Mr .
For many hours , they had little hope of his surviving ; but grief is strong , and he recovered .
" Esther certainly does think so . "
I must speak to you for myself , since there is no one about me whom I could ask to do so .
The drone said unaffectedly , " You will excuse me ; I really can not attend to the shop !
It is the next difficult thing to an impossibility to imagine <NAME> without Mrs. Rouncewell , but she has only been here fifty years .
He had no opportunity of defending himself , however , for Mrs. <NAME> gave unequivocal signs of fainting ; which , being perceived from the parlour window , Mrs. <NAME> , Mrs. Sanders , the lodger , and the lodger ' s servant , darted precipitately out , and conveyed her into the house , all talking at the same time , and giving utterance to various expressions of pity and condolence , as if she were one of the most suffering mortals on earth .
It seemed that he wanted to know whether all these were brothers and sisters of his ?
Whether this young gentleman ( for he was but three-and-twenty ) combined with the miserly vice of an old man , any of the open-handed vices of a young one , was a moot point ; so very honourably did he keep his own counsel .
I asked after a good deal of hesitation .
' They are both alive. ' ' Both ! ' repeated <NAME> , in a low voice .
I am willing to take charge of you , <NAME> , and to educate you , and provide for you .
<NAME> , evidently with a great determination to say , in his own manner , something that is on his mind before relapsing into silence , tries to raise himself among his pillows a little more .
' Why , in plain <NAME> , to frighten the rooks. ' ' Oh , is that all ? ' ' You are satisfied ? ' ' Quite. ' ' Very well .
I view it , steadily , as an investment .
As thus : ' Mrs Bangham , ' said the doctor , before he had been there twenty minutes , ' go outside and fetch a little brandy , or we shall have you giving in. ' ' Thank you , sir .
He had not been there with me ; all the noses were straight in my day .
But I always say that and have never doubted it .
Is it your pleasure , sir , that we decline and we fall ? ' with a feint of taking up the book .
Had he that deep-seated recondite complaint , and did any doctor find it out ?
' When are you relieved ? ' asked <NAME> .
Not , however , towards the ' shops ' where cunning artificers work in pearls and diamonds and gold and silver , making their hands so rich , that the enriched water in which they wash them is bought for the refiners ; -- not towards these does Mr Wegg stump , but towards the poorer shops of small retail traders in commodities to eat and drink and keep folks warm , and of <NAME> frame-makers , and of barbers , and of brokers , and of dealers in dogs and singing-birds .
You treated me falsely , ungratefully , and cruelly .
In the contemplative mood which these words had awakened , <NAME> walked forth from the <NAME> when his father had left him ; and bending his steps towards <NAME> ' s <NAME> , endeavoured to dissipate his melancholy , by strolling among its ancient precincts .
Men who had lounged about all night in smock-frocks and leather leggings , came out in silken vests and hats and plumes , as jugglers or mountebanks ; or in gorgeous liveries as soft-spoken servants at gambling booths ; or in sturdy yeoman dress as decoys at unlawful games .
Not much in the habit of travelling by rail myself , <NAME> , but gentlemen frequently say so. ' ' Do many gentlemen come here ?
The <NAME> may have faded , more or less , <NAME> ' am , ' observed the Major , dropping into a much nearer chair than had been indicated by his cruel Divinity , ' but it is a tough plant yet , and constant as the evergreen. ' Here the Major , under cover of the dark room , shut up one eye , rolled his head like a <NAME> , and , in his great self-satisfaction , perhaps went nearer to the confines of apoplexy than he had ever gone before .
Get up and bustle about , and do n't come over me with your woman 's nonsense . '
As it was , he laid a finger on his lips , and looked towards her brother .
He had taken service with the prisoner , in good faith and simplicity , four years ago .
He was not quite so young as he had been , and his figure was rather running to seed ; but there was an air of exaggerated gentility about him , which bespoke the hero of swaggering comedy .
' Good-night , <NAME> ! ' returned <NAME> softly .
He ascends the door-steps and is gliding into the dusky hall when he encounters , on the top step , a bowing and propitiatory little man .
( She really was there , I have since found , both before the deed and after it . )
' Not a bit , ' replied the sage <NAME> , with an air of vast experience .
This is a swimmer , sir , this fellow -- a diver , <NAME> save us !
' Perhaps <NAME> ' s <NAME> has gone there , <NAME> , ' observed <NAME> , turning to her .
His own earnest wish , coupled with the assurance he had received from <NAME> , filled him with the belief that she would yet arrive to claim the humble shelter he had offered , and from the death of each day ' s hope another hope sprung up to live to-morrow .
A giant among pigmies , a giant , a giant ! ' <NAME> looked at the old dog with a quiet smile as he chuckled on in this strain , and <NAME> in the closet felt his heart sink within him as the prospect of dinner grew fainter and fainter .
' Would you remember a message to your sister , <NAME> , if I was to charge you with one ? ' ' Well ?
The air become more sharp and piercing , as its first dull hue -- the death of night , rather than the birth of day -- glimmered faintly in the sky .
Perhaps there is a rather increased sense of power upon him as he loosely grasps one of his veinous wrists with his other hand and holding it behind his back walks noiselessly up and down .
It was beginning to rain fast .
We have lost our pleasant interpreter ( she spoke three foreign languages beautifully , <NAME> ; you have heard her many a time ) , and you must pull me through it , <NAME> , as well as you can .
But the Doctor himself was the idol of the whole school : and it must have been a badly composed school if he had been anything else , for he was the kindest of men ; with a simple faith in him that might have touched the stone hearts of the very urns upon the wall .
There never was , there never had been , there never again should be , such a man as Mr Merdle .
Is there anything else he ' d like ?
What ' s <NAME> to her , compared to me ? ' The apposite display of the diamonds , or the peach-velvet bonnet ( she sat in the bonnet to receive visitors , weeks before she could stir out of doors ) , or the dressing of her up in some gaud or other , usually stopped the tears that began to flow hereabouts ; and she would remain in a complacent state until <NAME> came to see her ; when , at a glance of the proud face , she would relapse again .

' And such a mother , ' observed Mr Dombey , bowing with some confused idea of being complimentary to <NAME> .

He was overjoyed to see us and dismounted with great alacrity .
The upper part of the house belonged to her , and as she had no necessity for the second-floor rooms just then , she was in the habit of letting them .

' But I looked so serious , that <NAME> left off shaking her curls , and laid her trembling little hand upon my shoulder , and first looked scared and anxious , then began to cry .

I have committed follies , gentlemen , ' said <NAME> , looking round with a meek smile , ' and I ought to bear the consequences without repining.

' Show him in. ' Mr Sloppy being introduced , remained close to the door : revealing in various parts of his form many surprising , confounding , and incomprehensible buttons .

The other mourners ( who are only Mr Chick , and two of the medical attendants ) proceed upstairs to the drawing-room , to be received by <NAME> and <NAME> .
I recollect the wet house-tops , the clogged and bursting gutters and water-spouts , the mounds of blackened ice and snow over which we passed , the narrowness of the courts by which we went .
Then why don ' t he go ?
There really was no necessity for the good lady to be much distressed upon this particular head ; the extent of her worldly knowledge being , to say the least , very questionable ; and so <NAME> seemed to think , for he smiled as she spoke .
Too late to know for certain , whether injuries received before or after death ; one excellent surgical opinion said , before ; other excellent surgical opinion said , after .
' Pray , <NAME> , ' said Mr Dorrit , raising his eyebrows , ' what do you mean ?
I know all. ' The daughter smiled incredulously .

I felt it was a time for conversation and confidence .
His developed figure and their stunted forms , his large manner filling any amount of room and their little narrow pinched ways , his sounding voice and their sharp spare tones , are in the strongest and the strangest opposition .
<NAME> <NAME> admits that he has been wrong and begs <NAME> to think no more about it .

I woke again at seven o ' clock , and by that time the party had assembled , and were gathered round , one light carriage , with a very stout axletree ; one something on wheels like an amateur carrier ' s cart ; one double phaeton of great antiquity and unearthly construction ; one gig with a great hole in its back and a broken head ; and one rider on horseback who was to go on before .
<NAME> <NAME> said nothing , but he fixed his eyes on <NAME> , and bestowed a look upon him , which , if he had had any feeling , must have pierced his brain .
' And at other times they say , " Can it never be done without these tricks , Mr Riah ?
That ' s a peculiarity of his .
As <NAME> and his sister were by this time compelled to superintend the removal of the few articles of furniture , <NAME> devoted herself to the consolation of the matron , and observed with great kindness of manner that she must really make an effort , and cheer up .
Late in the afternoon he awoke , and in some anxiety sent round to <NAME> ' s lodging hard by , to inquire if he were up yet ?
I was not so easy now during any reference to the name but that I felt it a relief when <NAME> , with an exclamation of surprise , hurried away to meet a stranger whom he first descried coming slowly towards us .

The garret , built to be a depository for firewood and the like , was dim and dark : for , the window of dormer shape , was in truth a door in the roof , with a little crane over it for the hoisting up of stores from the street : unglazed , and closing up the middle in two pieces , like any other door of <NAME> construction .
The gentle Judy , having backed her grandfather a little way from the fire , and having shaken him up as usual , and having released his overshadowed eye from its black-velvet extinguisher , <NAME> again says , " Oh , dear me !
She has been told it often enough ; and when she IS told it , she only gives me a placid look , as if I was I do n't know what -- a steeple in the distance , " said <NAME> with a sudden idea ; " and then she shakes her head and says 'Oh , <NAME> , <NAME> , what a tease you are ! '
Now , then , <NAME> , wheel away. ' ' Hold on , sir , ' said <NAME> , invigorated with the prospect of refreshments .

One of these was a mere boy of nineteen or twenty , who , though it was yet barely ten o ' clock , was drinking gin-and-water , and smoking a cigar- -amusements to which , judging from his inflamed countenance , he had devoted himself pretty constantly for the last year or two of his life .
And yet I can not , " said <NAME> , getting up again , " see afore me One -- and likewise drink to One -- without again expressing -- May I -- may I -- ? " I said he might , and he shook hands with me again , and emptied his glass and turned it upside down .
' <NAME> ! ' As he watches the spasmodic shoots and darts that break out of her face and limbs , like fitful lightning out of a dark sky , some contagion in them seizes upon him : insomuch that he has to withdraw himself to a lean arm-chair by the hearth—placed there , perhaps , for such emergencies—and to sit in it , holding tight , until he has got the better of this unclean spirit of imitation .
He is a kind , excellent , independent-spirited , fine- hearted , hospitable , liberal man ( enthusiastic shouts from the poor relations , at all the adjectives ; and especially at the two last ) .
Being my limbs , what does it signify ?

I was so sorry , and yet I was so fond of them and so glad that they were fond of me ; I pitied them so much , and yet I felt a kind of pride in their loving one another .
But , before we can resolve upon any precise course of action , it will be necessary to see the girl ; to ascertain from her whether she will point out this Monks , on the understanding that he is to be dealt with by us , and not by the law ; or , if she will not , or can not do that , to procure from her such an account of his haunts and description of his person , as will enable us to identify him .
When a name was called , its owner stepped apart into a spot reserved for those who were announced as being thus fatally recorded .
He is a responsible-looking gentleman dressed in black , portly enough , but strong and active .

Not a dead man , I suppose . "
People in my part of the country say they remember me so , but now I must have this vent under my sense of injury or nothing could hold my wits together .
' Oh -- you remember me , I suppose ? ' said <NAME> .
He then returned to the punch , in the highest state of exhilaration .
Perhaps I speak with some little partiality .
To those noble qualities I can lay no claim .
' We intend to win everything , ' said he .
' You were saying , <NAME> , ' said Mr Merdle , with his wounded finger in his mouth , ' that you had a complaint against me ? ' ' A complaint which I could scarcely show the justice of more emphatically , than by having to repeat it , ' said <NAME> .
The street was muddy , dirty , and deserted .
' Now get you into that corner and lie down , ' said <NAME> , ' or I ' ll take you out and shoot you. ' Lion did as he was ordered , and lay down licking his mouth and chest .

' I can easily inquire. ' ' Leave these papers with my clerk , then , ' said <NAME> , producing a small parcel , ' and tell him to wait till I come home. ' Nicholas cheerfully undertook the errand , and bidding his worthy uncle an affectionate farewell , which that warm-hearted old gentleman acknowledged by a growl , hastened away to execute his commission .
A child of excellent abilities , and with strong powers of observation , quick , eager , delicate , and soon hurt bodily or mentally , it seems wonderful to me that nobody should have made any sign in my behalf .
Oh yes , he was up .
<NAME> , I have no doubt whatever that <NAME> will then promote me to young <NAME> ' s situation .
Accepting <NAME> ' s proffered hand to help him up , he then put on his coat , and said to <NAME> , ' Hand me over those spare sculls of yours , and I ' ll pull this in to the nearest stairs .
Mrs. Wititterly had never thrown off the mask with regard to <NAME> , but when she was more than usually out of temper , attributed the circumstance , as ladies sometimes do , to nervous indisposition .

' You plot among you to wean my heart from her .
When he had got so far , it came again into his head that the question was , not what they thought of it , but what she thought of it .
Yet <NAME> so idealised the pretty child whom he had found wandering in the rough streets , and so identified her with her innocent gratitude of that night and the simplicity and truth of its expression , that he blushed for himself as a libeller when he argued that she could ever grow proud .
' It will be necessary , I think , ' he observed , ' to wind up Mr Dolls , before anything to any mortal purpose can be got out of him .
He had been there often , during a whole year , and had always been the same moody and morose lounger there .
When he had finished , she turned her eyes so as to command <NAME> , without otherwise disturbing her attitude , and said : ' Well , ma ' am , have YOU got anything to remark ? ' ' Indeed , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' all that I could say has been so well said by my brother , and all that I know to be the fact has been so plainly stated by him , that I have nothing to add except my thanks for your politeness .
Nothing else in it -- no , nothing , nothing !
It was when <NAME> began to recover that I began to notice a change in my dear girl .
' I waited for a good opportunity .
An old eight-day clock , of solemn and sedate demeanour , ticked gravely in one corner ; and a silver watch , of equal antiquity , dangled from one of the many hooks which ornamented the dresser .
Some few stopped to gaze at <NAME> for a moment or two , or turned round to stare at him as they hurried by ; but none relieved him , or troubled themselves to inquire how he came there .
When there are two parties to a bargain , it is only reasonable that the interests of both should be consulted ; is it , my good friend ? '
<NAME> on the part of other parties brought me round ; but I never asked ' em to bring me round , nor yet the steamer never asked ' em to it .
It rained all day as I once thought it never did rain anywhere , but in the <NAME> of <NAME> .
I had done it again .
It was summer-time , and lovely weather .
No , it was not my fault .
' Could I say a few words with you in the next box ? ' ' By all means , ' rejoined <NAME> with a grin .
I told her I should like it very much , I hoped ; but I was a little strange to it at first .
Between this , and the room she had called hers , there was a small door of communication , standing partly open .
Because they were never asunder .
He was a fine swarthy fellow , with dark hair and large moustachios , who rode a-hunting in clothes of <NAME> green , with russet boots on his feet , and a bugle slung over his shoulder like the guard of a long stage .

' I am very much obliged to you , indeed , ' said <NAME> , on hearing it was to be sent to where he lived , that night .
Notably , <NAME> has made a series of experiments on her digestive functions , so extremely complicated and daring , that if they could be published with their results it might benefit the human race .
You were not to be found .
How could such a collection be here , where you see everything except the inside of one little cupboard and a few boxes ?
Not that I had really thought so , but because my conversational powers were effectually scattered .
The vacant apartment to which the bill in the parlour window bore reference , appeared , on inquiry , to be a small back-room on the second floor , reclaimed from the leads , and overlooking a soot-bespeckled prospect of tiles and chimney-pots .
A word in your ear , Mrs. Nickleby .
That patriotic servant accordingly stuck to his colours ( the <NAME> of four Quarterings ) , and was a perfect <NAME> in respect of nailing them to the mast .
I could have done so , and I would , if we had never met , Florence. ' ' I trust , ' said <NAME> , ambling in at the door , and speaking , half in the room , and half out of it , ' that my lovely and accomplished relative will excuse my having , by a little stratagem , effected this meeting .
<NAME> , come , my young cousins , begin afresh !
<NAME> , ' he added , looking round again .
My dear Mrs Chick -- may I say <NAME> ! ' Mrs <NAME> took <NAME> ' s hand in hers , rested the foot of her wine-glass upon it , repressed a tear , and said in a low voice , ' God bless you ! ' ' My dear <NAME> then , ' said <NAME> , ' my sweet friend , how are you now ? ' ' <NAME> , ' Mrs <NAME> returned .
<NAME> <NAME> would not hear of his rising , so they made the bed the chair , and <NAME> presided .
I can not say that they were very like , or that they particularly resembled any flowers that have ever come under my observation ; but I knew from the paper round them which was accurately copied , what the composition was .
<NAME> was a knotty man , and a close-grained , with a face carved out of very hard material , that had just as much play of expression as a watchman ' s rattle .
' I never saw such a melting thing in all my life ! ' said <NAME> , who naturally substituted for this child one of her own , inquiring for herself in like circumstances .
Traddles still remained , perhaps , but it was very doubtful ; and I had not sufficient confidence in his discretion or good luck , however strong my reliance was on his good nature , to wish to trust him with my situation .
' I think it right to suggest it .
You are quite -- yes -- dear me ! ' I hoped he was well , and Mrs. Strong too .
Mr Perch , who seemed to remember having heard in infancy that there was once a poet of that name , made no objection ; but he was much astonished at the <NAME> ' s coming into the <NAME> to propose a poet ; indeed , if he had proposed to put a poet ' s statue up -- say <NAME> ' s for example -- in a civic thoroughfare , he could hardly have done a greater outrage to Mr Perch ' s experience .
A second knock brought no reply from within the house ; but caused a woman over the way to look out and inquire who that was , awanting <NAME> .
You may , perhaps , be prepared to hear that Mrs. Micawber is in a state of health which renders it not wholly improbable that an addition may be ultimately made to those pledges of affection which -- in short , to the infantine group .
Take him , and I can bear it better , for your sake ! " My earnestness awoke a wonder in her that seemed as if it would have been touched with compassion , if she could have rendered me at all intelligible to her own mind .
' A hundred , ' said the little man .
If you like to come there , come there .
' You ask me why ! ' returned my aunt .
She led <NAME> to a chair beside her , and sat down : Florence looking in her face , quite wondering at its beauty , and willingly leaving her hand in hers .
Mr <NAME> argued , if an orphan were wanted , was he not an orphan himself ; and could a better be desired ?
' You know it almost breaks my heart , even to hear you talk of such a thing , ' replied <NAME> .
At breakfast next morning , he knew the contents of the latest newspapers received ; and mentioned several subjects in connexion with them , on which his opinion had recently been sought by persons of such power and might , that they were only to be obscurely hinted at .
He was walking up and down the room , panting , and making himself worse by laboriously fanning himself with her handkerchief , when he turned towards the opening door .
' You ! ' He did what he could to muster a smile , and returned , ' Your fancy .
After a short delay , he reappeared , and limping back again , halted midway , and beckoned <NAME> to follow him .
He was sitting in his old grey gown and his old black cap , in the sunlight by the window , reading his newspaper .
It may be reasonably inferred that our baby will first expire of inanition , as being the frailest member of our circle ; and that our twins will follow next in order .
' This time , at least , I will leave nothing unsaid , ' he went on , folding his hands before him , clearly to prevent his being betrayed into any impetuous gesture ; ' this last time at least I will not be tortured with after-thoughts of a lost opportunity .
In any part of the house , visitors were usually cognizant of a prevailing mustiness ; and in warm weather <NAME> had been seen apparently writing in sundry chinks and crevices of the wainscoat with the the wrong end of a pen dipped in spirits of turpentine .
' You see , master hadn ' t introduced us , then .
' Stop a moment , ma ' am , ' said <NAME> ; ' I ' m afraid I have not understood you .
' <NAME> my soul and honour that ' s a wise remark .
I replied at my own chambers , with <NAME> .
Let us both try to forget it .
The bell was rung again , with some impatience , while the party were in darkness .
I whistled and made nothing of going .
' <NAME> , ma ' am , ' said <NAME> , staunchly protesting against the words that had been used , and instinctively addressing himself to <NAME> , after glancing at her face .
' Then you ought to have said it , sir , ' returned <NAME> , giving him two pulls and one kiss , ' for you must have thought and meant it .
She started -- it was only a passing dream .
In one of the sunburnt faces I had recognized <NAME> , and I had been afraid of his recognizing me .
and retires conscience-stricken from the presence .
With the candles appeared her maid , with the juvenile dress that was to delude the world to-morrow .
' How do you dare ? ' ' What I mean , <NAME> , is to speak respectful and without offence , but out , and how I dare I know not but I do ! ' said <NAME> .
<NAME> Leicester seems to wake , though his eyes have been wide open , and he looks intently at <NAME> as <NAME> refers to his watch .
We 're not going to pick holes in each other 's coats , I suppose ? "
Oh I know she ' s going to bring him here !
There she sits in his company like a stone , instead of making herself agreeable and getting it easily .
' Capital ! ' said <NAME> , putting the stakes in his pocket .
He saw her in his mind , exactly as she was .
<NAME> nodded to him to take no further notice just then ; and , in a few minutes , the girl subsided into her accustomed demeanour .
Give him to drink , my wife ! " A second man got up and went out .
' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , with affected earnestness , ' forgive intrusion -- short acquaintance -- no time for ceremony -- all discovered. ' ' Sir ! ' said the spinster aunt , rather astonished by the unexpected apparition and somewhat doubtful of <NAME> ' s sanity .
' Fie for shame. ' ' Mr <NAME> will forgive the partiality of a wife , ' said <NAME> , with an engaging smile .
The room was as neat as <NAME> or my aunt .
' Snug ! ' said <NAME> , when he had groped his way to the wooden counting-house , and opened the door with a key he carried about with him .
This , with hazy remembrances of how he had been carried to some office to ' confess judgment ' ( as he recollected the phrase ) , and how he had been carried to another office where his life was assured for somebody not wholly unconnected with the sherry trade whom he remembered by the remarkable circumstance that he had a Straduarius violin to dispose of , and also a <NAME> , formed the sum and substance of Mr <NAME> ' s narrative .
He was then , and he is now , very sorry for it. ' ' But for <NAME> ' s well-bred consideration in coming up to me , next day , after service , in the Nave itself , with his gown still on , and expressing his hope that I had not been greatly alarmed or had my rest violently broken , I believe I might never have heard of that disgraceful transaction , ' said the old lady .
He has been so horribly frightened in the short interval that his terror seizes the other , who makes a rush at him and asks loudly , " What 's the matter ? "
Accordingly , Mr <NAME> produced a list of sundry eastern magnates who were to be bidden to this feast on his behalf ; to which Mrs <NAME> , acting for her dearest child , who was haughtily careless on the subject , subjoined a western list , comprising <NAME> , not yet returned to Baden-Baden , greatly to the detriment of his personal estate ; and a variety of moths of various degrees and ages , who had , at various times , fluttered round the light of her fair daughter , or herself , without any lasting injury to their wings .
' <NAME> , ' he cried , in a suffocating voice , ' it ' s little Nickleby !
What superior intelligence ! ' ' Keep off , <NAME> ! ' cried the palpitating <NAME> , taking her apron from her mouth again .
Oh , very right indeed , ' said <NAME> .
He has more leisure for musing in <NAME> Inn and in the <NAME> during the long vacation than at other seasons , and he says to the two 'prentices , what a thing it is in such hot weather to think that you live in an island with the sea a-rolling and a-bowling right round you .
' Why did you call him back ? ' ' He was long enough coming , anyhow , ' grumbled <NAME> .
It is obvious that , having devoted herself from infancy to this one pursuit and study , <NAME> could know but little of the world , otherwise than in connection with the law ; and that from a lady gifted with such high tastes , proficiency in those gentler and softer arts in which women usually excel , was scarcely to be looked for .
' I shall strive t ' see thee agen , <NAME> , afore I go , but if not— ' ' Thou wilt not , <NAME> , I know .
My darling , do n't you be afraid ! "
But that was always the way with your poor dear papa , -- just his way -- always wandering , never able to fix his thoughts on any one subject for two minutes together .
I am very desirous to serve a friend. " <NAME> tightened his post-office and shook his head , as if his opinion were dead against any fatal weakness of that sort .
You know this to be our determination .
I was standing alone before the fire , when <NAME> came stealing softly in , to give me that usual precious little kiss before I went .
In short , the poor girl ( for what could she know of the criminal intellect , which its own professed students perpetually misread , because they persist in trying to reconcile it with the average intellect of average men , instead of identifying it as a horrible wonder apart ) could get by no road to any other conclusion than that he _was_ a terrible man , and must be fled from .
' Never ! ' was the valorous reply .
" And the maker 's name ? " said <NAME> .
' Can we have beds here ? ' inquired <NAME> , summoning the waiter .
She could scarcely move her head for pain and heaviness , her eyes were strained and sore , and she was very weak .
' Why , he drove a coach down here once , ' said <NAME> ; ' ' lection time came on , and he was engaged by vun party to bring down woters from <NAME> .
At a sign from <NAME> , they helped out a third man , and taking him between them , hurried him into the house .
Mr Dombey stiff with starch and arrogance ; the little image by inheritance , and in unconscious imitation .
The hollow crowd , you know , when they see me with the <NAME> , and characters of distinction like that , suppose me to be happy ; but I ' m wretched .
' Oh , dear , yes , <NAME> , ' he proceeded , in a soft voice , most remarkably contrasting with the action of his thumb , which did not diminish its hard pressure in the least degree , ' there ' s no doubt of it .
One day soon after the appearance of the chair , <NAME> suddenly saying to me , with the impatient movement of her fingers , " There , there , there !
Some are self-possessed directly , and some are much perplexed to make out where they are until they have rubbed their eyes , and leaning on one elbow , looked about them .
Shall we cry shame on the brutality of those who hamstring cattle : and spare the lights of <NAME> upon earth who notch the ears of men and women , cut pleasant posies in the shrinking flesh , learn to write with pens of red-hot iron on the human face , rack their poetic fancies for liveries of mutilation which their slaves shall wear for life and carry to the grave , breaking living limbs as did the soldiery who mocked and slew the Saviour of the world , and set defenceless creatures up for targets !
He takes his place within the carriage , and three other gentlemen follow .
Some of the young ladies washed the lettuces for him , and sliced them under his directions .
But what I have intended , what I have resolved upon ( and this is the confidence I seek to place in you ) is , on my return to <NAME> , in my own person , in my own journal , to bear , for the behoof of my countrymen , such testimony to the gigantic changes in this country as I have hinted at to-night .
The servant soon returned , to beg that she would walk upstairs ; and following him into an upper room , <NAME> was presented to an elderly gentleman of benevolent appearance , in a bottle-green coat .
" This friend , " I pursued , " is trying to get on in commercial life , but has no money , and finds it difficult and disheartening to make a beginning .
' You call very early , and how kind that is , my dear ! ' pursued <NAME> .
He paid the money for his journey to the country-place he had thought of ; and was walking to and fro , alone , looking along the lines of iron , across the valley in one direction , and towards a dark bridge near at hand in the other ; when , turning in his walk , where it was bounded by one end of the wooden stage on which he paced up and down , he saw the man from whom he had fled , emerging from the door by which he himself had entered .
' Not much , I fear , ' returned my mother .
Then he fell into such unaccountable fits of meditation , with his fork midway between his plate and his mouth ; had his eyes attracted in such strange directions ; was afflicted with such remarkable coughs ; sat so far from the table , and dropped so much more than he ate , and pretended that he had n't dropped it ; that I was heartily glad when <NAME> left us for the <NAME> .
Mr <NAME> ' s own particular servant behind his chair ; the <NAME> behind Veneering ' s chair ; instances in point that such servants fall into two classes : one mistrusting the master ' s acquaintances , and the other mistrusting the master .
We ' ll finish the bottle , to the <NAME> , <NAME> -- <NAME> ' s <NAME> .
An ' t you one of the rest !
His scanty black trousers displayed here and there those shiny patches which bespeak long service , and were strapped very tightly over a pair of patched and mended shoes , as if to conceal the dirty white stockings , which were nevertheless distinctly visible .
You mustn ' t tell us about that , here .
Promptly the Secretary wrote to the master of that school , and that very evening <NAME> answered in person .
Upon my life and honour , I never was so rejoiced , my beloved Copperfield , never ! ' I was equally at a loss to express my emotions .
Than I 'm sorry to say , I 've eat your pie. " " God knows you 're welcome to it , -- so far as it was ever mine , " returned <NAME> , with a saving remembrance of Mrs. Joe .
' Hold up , <NAME> ! ' This last observation of <NAME> ' s bore reference to a demonstration <NAME> made at the instant , of a frantic desire to throw his feet in the air , and dash the back of his head on the ice .
Then he placed his breakfast before him with great care , and said , " All right , ai n't you , <NAME> ? " To which the cheerful <NAME> replied , " All right , <NAME> , my boy , all right ! " As there seemed to be a tacit understanding that the <NAME> was not in a presentable state , and was therefore to be considered invisible , I made a pretence of being in complete ignorance of these proceedings .
said <NAME> , putting the light so close to his new jacket as nearly to set him on fire .
She had been surprised at first , because she had not thought Edmund a marrying man .
He was sensible of the value of appearances as an investment , and liked to dress well ; but he drove a bargain for every moveable about him , from the coat on his back to the china on his breakfast-table ; and every bargain by representing somebody ' s ruin or somebody ' s loss , acquired a peculiar charm for him .
The boy complying with an indignant look and as much noise as he could make , swung out of the room ; and <NAME> went to the window , and leaned there , looking out .
I have deliberated , ever since , when and how to destroy it .
<NAME> and freely , there is no anger in you , <NAME> ? ' ' None at all , <NAME> Jasper. ' Still , not quite so frankly or so freely ; or , be it said once again , not quite so carelessly perhaps .
With a plunge of enjoyment , <NAME> settled himself afresh .
' Nothing would give me greater pleasure , ' replied <NAME> .
But what 's done ca n't be undone .
It was old enough now , and dreary enough , for nobody lived in it but <NAME> , the other rooms being all let out as offices .
Observant of his unwillingness to mar the effect by opening it again , <NAME> said , " Go on , Jacques. " " All the village , " pursued the mender of roads , on tiptoe and in a low voice , " withdraws ; all the village whispers by the fountain ; all the village sleeps ; all the village dreams of that unhappy one , within the locks and bars of the prison on the crag , and never to come out of it , except to perish .
Another consequence that he had never foreshadowed , was the implication of an innocent man in his supposed murder .
' When did that person come here , waiter ? ' ' Come down by the night-coach , this morning , sir. ' ' Humph !
At length , <NAME> , in an access of fury that I must ever deplore , threw herself upon me with screams of passion ( no doubt those that were overheard at some distance ) , tore my clothes , tore my hair , lacerated my hands , trampled and trod the dust , and finally leaped over , dashing herself to death upon the rocks below .
' Gentlemen , ' returned <NAME> , ' do with me as you will !
<NAME> hadst no sleep last night , I can well believe .

But if he had any taste for walking , or should wish at any time to break into a trot , he might sometimes find it a little difficult to keep step with your mother .
' Indeed , sir , ' said I , ' her affairs are so changed , that I wished to ask you whether it would be possible -- at a sacrifice on our part of some portion of the premium , of course , ' I put in this , on the spur of the moment , warned by the blank expression of his face -- ' to cancel my articles ? ' What it cost me to make this proposal , nobody knows .
But , your bringing-up was different from mine ; mine was a real thing , by <NAME> !
As it is , I don ' t think I can do with anythin ' under a female markis .
And it surely can not be a little thing that causes you so much uneasiness .
" Do you wish to hold any conversation with me in private ? "
I was willing to do anything to relieve <NAME> from his difficulty , and to restore harmony between himself and an affectionate parent , who has undergone so much on his account .
One young gentleman was very anxious to hang up his cap for him ; and another was so obliging as to put his hands in his pockets , in order that , as he was very tired , he might not have the trouble of emptying them , himself , when he went to bed .
Her cold supreme indifference -- his own unquestioned attribute usurped -- stung him more than any other kind of treatment could have done ; and he determined to bend her to his magnificent and stately will .
He was a gaunt , sallow young man , with hollow cheeks , and a chin almost as black as <NAME> ' s ; but there the likeness ended , for his whiskers were shaved off , and his hair , instead of being glossy , was rusty and dry .
" But I do n't ask what you think of myself ; I ask what you think of the prison . "
She looked up in <NAME> ' s face , and smiled through her tears .
' She will speak differently in a little time. ' I don ' t know what he would have said in answer .
<NAME> ' s knock astonished <NAME> ; but , as he immediately suspected that somebody had come to tell him that somebody else was robbing him , or otherwise trying to get the better of him , he came down promptly and softly .
Here , also , Mr Wegg instantly underwent the remarkable experience of having his hat twitched off his head and thrown out of a window , which was opened and shut for the purpose .
But you know what I know , <NAME> , and it may not be so very easy as it seems , after all .
As often as Mr <NAME> let down the glass and looked back at him ( which was very often ) , he saw him smoking <NAME> out , it is true , but still generally standing up the while and looking about him , like a man who had his suspicions , and kept upon his guard .
There was a sudden bump -- a loud crash- -away rolled a wheel , and over went the chaise .
So with the churchyard on a branch of the solitary way to the night ' s sleeping-place .
The lady turned aside her head .
But can I permit the film of a silly proceeding on the part of <NAME> ( from whom I expect nothing else ) to interpose between me and the great <NAME> continent ?
But , the watchful little dressmaker had been vigilant as ever in her watch , and she now came up and touched <NAME> ' s arm as he looked down at his friend , despairingly .
If he mean this ironically , it may be truer than he thinks .
No , no , no , ' cried the old woman , shaking her head and laughing ; for her daughter had started up , ' not now ; it ' s too far off ; it ' s by the milestone , where the stones are heaped ; -- to-morrow , deary , if it ' s fine , and you are in the humour .
What material ? ' ' <NAME> , ' returned Mrs General , ' at present forms too many opinions .
good gracious <NAME> ! -- pray excuse me -- old habit -- Mr Clennam far more proper -- what a country to live in for so long a time , and with so many lanterns and umbrellas too how very dark and wet the climate ought to be and no doubt actually is , and the sums of money that must be made by those two trades where everybody carries them and hangs them everywhere , the little shoes too and the feet screwed back in infancy is quite surprising , what a traveller you are ! ' In his ridiculous distress , <NAME> received another of the old glances without in the least knowing what to do with it .
" I am sorry to learn that the same state of mind has got this Gridley into new troubles and that he is in hiding , " said my guardian .
Who is this in pain ! " And I used to cry out , " O my blessed children , it ' s poor me .
'Do n't scruple to answer freely , man .
I thank you for disclosing your schemes , which I am now prepared for .
One comfort that she had under the <NAME> by <NAME> was more sustaining to her , and made her more grateful than to a less devoted and affectionate spirit , not habituated to her struggles and sacrifices , might appear quite reasonable ; and , indeed , it may often be observed in life , that spirits like <NAME> do not appear to reason half as carefully as the folks who get the better of them .
She had quite a lovely face , though , as the reader may suppose from this sketch of her history , there was a lurking devil in her bright eye , which looked out pretty sharply from between her prison bars .
Behind the most ancient part of <NAME> , <NAME> , where certain gabled houses some centuries of age still stand looking on the public way , as if disconsolately looking for the <NAME> that has long run dry , is a little nook composed of two irregular quadrangles , called <NAME> .
'Very curious , indeed , ' observed the doctor .
His whole material and immaterial life is wonderfully strange ; his death , the strangest thing of all .
Then I went to bed too .
<NAME> , ' she went on in a steady , straight way , without regarding this , ' asks me to marry him .
cried a voice from below , in reply to a whistle from the Dodger .
I forget , too , at what hour the gates were opened in the morning , admitting of my going in ; but I know that I was often up at six o ' clock , and that my favourite lounging-place in the interval was old <NAME> , where I was wont to sit in one of the stone recesses , watching the people going by , or to look over the balustrades at the sun shining in the water , and lighting up the golden flame on the top of the <NAME> .
But judging from the looks on you , ' retorted <NAME> , completely ridding himself of his grass , and drawing his sleeve across his mouth , ' you ' ve made ekally sure afore , and have got disapinted .
' Ask the favour of the lady ' s name. ' The lady ' s name is <NAME> .
I am looking at the fire. ' ' You seem to find more to look at in it than ever I could find , ' said <NAME> .
The <NAME> , as custodian of the drum , could have wakened him up and had the same speech out of him as before the <NAME> fell , or old <NAME> was seized ; not so with the hoarse tones of the men and women in <NAME> <NAME> 's bosom .
I mentioned to you some time ago , I think , that the young lady whose intended husband was murdered is daughter to a clerk of mine ? ' ' Yes , you told me that , ' said <NAME> ; ' and by-the-bye , I wish you would tell it again here , for it ' s a curious coincidence -- curious that the first news of the discovery should have been brought straight to your table ( when I was there ) , and curious that one of your people should have been so nearly interested in it .
And when I ' m too deaf , and too lame , and too blind , and too mumbly for want of teeth , to be of any use at all , even to be found fault with , than I shall go to my Davy , and ask him to take me in. ' ' And , <NAME> , ' says I , ' I shall be glad to see you , and I ' ll make you as welcome as a queen. ' ' Bless your dear heart ! ' cried <NAME> .
But competition , competition -- new invention , new invention -- alteration , alteration -- the world ' s gone past me .
He stood with his lovely burden in his arms , gazing vacantly on the countenances of his friends , without the slightest attempt at recognition or explanation .
I ' ve led her on to tell her secret she supposed we were alone ; and you were by , God forgive me. ' ' You led her on !
My little woman has a very active mind , sir . "
" Not on any account , " returned <NAME> ; " but a public-house may keep a gentleman .
' Your mother-in-law , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' and the red-nosed man , my boy ; and the red-nosed man .
' <NAME> , <NAME> ! ' said <NAME> , ' to think that I should find you acquainted with the friend of my youth , the companion of earlier days !
But not to-day is <NAME> so occupied .
' He ' s a man of his word , and it ' s my opinion he ' ll do it , miss .
She did not say so , however , as she gave him her hand .
Of these , some were found crying under hedges and in such places , frightened at the solitude .
Have you considered what it is to undermine the confidence that should subsist between my daughter and myself ?
<NAME> Peartree may justify it to the grasp of _his_ mind thus to do his republican utmost to bring an appointed officer into contempt .
He had laid aside his coat and waistcoat ; his shirt was open at the throat , as it used to be when he did that work ; and even the old haggard , faded surface of face had come back to him .
' <NAME> , pooh ! -- nothing more easy -- blackguard boy -- lovely woman -- fat boy horsewhipped -- you believed -- end of the matter -- all comfortable. ' Whether the probability of escaping from the consequences of this ill- timed discovery was delightful to the spinster ' s feelings , or whether the hearing herself described as a ' lovely woman ' softened the asperity of her grief , we know not .
And as <NAME> informed us that <NAME> 's mind had run on <NAME> all the afternoon after hearing of their interview in the morning , I wrote a hasty note in pencil to my guardian to say where we were gone and why .
And now the stars faded , and the day glimmered , and standing in the carriage , looking back , he could discern the track by which he had come , and see that there was no traveller within view , on all the heavy expanse .
Do n't let my brother know . "
Take her away , my dear <NAME> .
You mean , do I feel as if I were settling down ? "

The finger-marks are something whiter for the instant , but he walks on at her side .
<NAME> encouraged herself with a final twitch , and went in .
' Upon my word , it ' s quite extraordinary ! ' ' Open the door , ' said <NAME> , ' I ' ve got him here .
" That was the time , sir , " answers <NAME> , faintly adjusting his whiskers .
' My love , ' said I to <NAME> , ' what have you got in that dish ? ' I could not imagine why <NAME> had been making tempting little faces at me , as if she wanted to kiss me .
And my remark was—for I couldn ' t think of a better one—that I thought it must be just as hard upon those who were starved , whether the others were a million , or a million million .
' Then her mental powers , hitherto stinted in their growth , rapidly developed themselves ; and during the four months of health which she enjoyed , she appears ( making due allowance for a fond mother ' s account ) to have displayed a considerable degree of intelligence .
The request was no sooner preferred , than granted .
' Is that the young man you saw in the lane , whom you told me about , this morning ? ' <NAME> , who , as it has already appeared , was a man of few words , looked at <NAME> , nodded his head , and growled forth , ' That ' s the man. ' <NAME> , who was never proud , gave a smile of friendly recognition as his eyes encountered those of the surly groom , and admitted in courteous terms , that he had ' knowed him afore. ' ' And this is the faithful creature , ' exclaimed <NAME> , ' whom I had nearly suffocated ! -- Mr .
Matters being brought to this so far satisfactory pass , and time being on the wane , Mrs. Bagnet proposes a departure .

I ' ve had trouble enough to find you , and shouldn ' t have found you , if I hadn ' t seen you slipping along the street overnight , and watched you till you was safe housed .
<NAME> had not the least objection in the world , but on the contrary was rather pleased to have an opportunity of talking on the subject which occupied his thoughts ; so , he sat down again , and ( his sanguine imagination warming as he spoke ) entered into a fervent and glowing description of all the honours and advantages to be derived from his appointment at that seat of learning , <NAME> .
We once knew two famous coachmen ( they are dead now , poor fellows ) who were twins , and between whom an unaffected and devoted attachment existed .
Thus in the case of <NAME> .
I have no more of what they call character , my dear , than a canary-bird , but I know I am trustworthy. ' The wayward , playful , affectionate nature , giddy for want of the weight of some sustaining purpose , and capricious because it was always fluttering among little things , was yet a captivating one .
<NAME> , let me go. ' At this crisis of his ravings <NAME> made a pluck at the breakfast knife , and being restrained by his wife ' s grasp , attempted to dash his head against the wall -- taking very good care to be at least six feet from it .
Not because I was squeezed in at an acute angle of the tablecloth , with the table in my chest , and the <NAME> elbow in my eye , nor because I was not allowed to speak ( I did n't want to speak ) , nor because I was regaled with the scaly tips of the drumsticks of the fowls , and with those obscure corners of pork of which the pig , when living , had had the least reason to be vain .
There 'd be a pretty shine made if I was to go a-wisitin THEM , I think .
' I have the honour to address <NAME> , I believe ? ' said the gentleman , with a most persuasive smile .
As soon as we were out of doors , <NAME> , with the manner of a little footpad , demanded a shilling of me on the ground that his pocket-money was " boned " from him .
I had far better stay at home ! ' The agonised way in which she poured this out , as if it burst of itself from her suppressed heart , made it difficult for <NAME> to keep the tears from his eyes as he saw and heard her .
To which he mildly answered , ' Yes , I think I can , my dear. ' ' Then , ' said <NAME> , with solemn indignation , ' I would recommend you , if you have a human feeling , to retire to bed. ' ' Thank you , my dear , ' he replied ; ' I think it IS the best place for me. ' And with these unsympathetic words very gladly withdrew .
' Has he been living with -- ? ' ' Ah , sir ! ' interposed <NAME> , confronting him again .
) , dived under all the furniture , and wound a long iron chain , that dangled from his neck , round legs of chairs and tables , and then tugged at it until his eyes became unnaturally visible , in consequence of their nearly starting out of his head ; and when he growled at Mr Toots , who affected familiarity ; and went pell-mell at <NAME> , morally convinced that he was the enemy whom he had barked at round the corner all his life and had never seen yet ; <NAME> was as pleased with him as if he had been a miracle of discretion .
It was into a place of this kind that <NAME> gazed , as he sat with his hands in his pockets looking out of the window .
The old man raked the fire together with an old stair-rod , and having trimmed his smoky lamp ( for it was night ) , with the stem of his pipe , put it in his mouth again .
<NAME> , <NAME> , for dear God 's sake , for your own , for mine , stop before you spill my blood !
It was not in reason to be expected that he should ; if he could have lightly forgotten it , he could never have conceived it , or had the patience and perseverance to work it out .
' <NAME> , ' echoed <NAME> ; and the ceremony of introduction was complete .
If I was to tell some that he knows , and has spotted and cheated with , where to find him -- ' ' Will you hold your tongue , <NAME> ? ' interrupted the miserable Grinder , glancing quickly round , as though he expected to see his master ' s teeth shining at his elbow .
She slowly , very slowly , broke into a laugh , and pointed at <NAME> with her hand , as if she were a sight of shame for gods and men .
Withers believed she was in her own room .
<NAME> <NAME> makes a leg and comes forward , passing his familiar demon over the region of his mouth .

The wildest would do her bidding -- she had a tender way with them , indeed she had ! ' <NAME> had no power to speak .
' I doen ' t know , sir , ' he replied .
' Oh , <NAME> ! ' he said , shaking his head , ' that ' s the school where they broke the boy ' s ribs -- two ribs -- a little boy he was .
He shrunk behind the curtains , and called out very loudly -- ' Ha-hum ! ' That the lady started at this unexpected sound was evident , by her falling up against the rushlight shade ; that she persuaded herself it must have been the effect of imagination was equally clear , for when <NAME> , under the impression that she had fainted away stone-dead with fright , ventured to peep out again , she was gazing pensively on the fire as before .
The <NAME> dealt , turned up a knave , and omitted to take the usual advantage ; upon which Mr <NAME> called out as loud as he could -- ' Two for his heels ! ' The <NAME> jumped up quickly and clapped her hands .
The room resumed its shadowy terrors , the moment she left it ; and she had no more power to divest herself of these vague impressions of dread , than if they had been stone giants , rooted in the solid earth .
You are not a stranger , <NAME> ' ' Thank you , sir , I am sure -- <NAME> ; ' here <NAME> turned the great hat round and round upon his left-hand , like a slowly twirling mouse-cage ; ' <NAME> quite well , sir ? ' ' Yes , <NAME> , yes ; very well .
Mr Rokesmith , that girl has often seen herself in a pitiful and poor light since , but never in so pitiful and poor a light as now , when the mean tone in which she answered you -- sordid and vain girl that she was -- has been echoed in her ears by Mr Boffin. ' He kissed her hand again .
Be that how it might , he had with pains gradually worked the boy into his own school , and procured him some offices to discharge there , which were repaid with food and lodging .
But I mean a cost .
I am so happy with him .
This gave me courage to protest most vehemently that I loved <NAME> better than I could tell , or anyone believe ; that all my friends knew how I loved her ; that my aunt , <NAME> , <NAME> , everyone who knew me , knew how I loved her , and how earnest my love had made me .
You have your gentleman-friends , you know , and they ' ll serve you with as much of the article as you want .
I ' ll hear all I don ' t know , and say all I know .
I do not charge it upon you. ' The <NAME> replied , with that mute action of his bristling mouth , ' Oh , you don ' t charge it upon me ! ' and bade him go on .
One afternoon , late in the month of February , I came ashore at the wharf at dusk .
' What is a proctor , <NAME> ? ' said I .
At length the dish was lifted on the table , and mugs of ale having been previously set round , little <NAME> ventured to say grace , and supper began .
A little more , in truth , and it will be all extinguished for <NAME> ; and the damp door in the mausoleum which shuts so tight , and looks so obdurate , will have opened and received him .
The green coat had been a smart dress garment in the days of swallow-tails , but had evidently in those times adorned a much shorter man than the stranger , for the soiled and faded sleeves scarcely reached to his wrists .
Here , they fell to reviewing the origin and progress of their acquaintance , as men sometimes do , and tracing out the little events by which it was most strongly marked , came at last to <NAME> .
There was a kind of film or flicker on her face , which at first he took to be the fitful firelight ; but , on a second look , he saw that she was weeping .
There ' s no harm done. ' ' I looked for single motives in everyone , ' said <NAME> , ' and I was satisfied I had bound him to me by motives of interest .
I did so on accounts of your looking too hard at what I had in tow , as if you was suspicious , and on accounts of your holding on to the gunwale of my boat. " I says to him , " <NAME> , I know it. " He says to me , " <NAME> , you are a man in a dozen " -- I think he said in a score , but of that I am not positive , so take the lowest figure , for precious be the obligations of a Alfred <NAME> .

They are very tender to each other at dusky street-corners , and <NAME> has visions of leading an altered and blameless existence as a serious greengrocer in <NAME> .
' No , <NAME> ; I have felt it before .
<NAME> came near me until late at night .
'He wo n't stir till it 's all safe .
Again tenderly wrapping her mantle about her , and taking her on his arm ( though , but for her visit , he was almost too weak to walk ) , <NAME> led <NAME> down-stairs .
A bargain was struck with <NAME> , that if <NAME> was got back he should have a certain sum ; and he was to have more for making him a thief , which this <NAME> wanted for some purpose of his own . '
Show me Mrs Dombey , and I ' ll show you my Alice ' s first cousin. ' <NAME> glanced from the old woman to the lustrous eyes intent upon her face , and derived corroboration from them .
But , he was girdled still with <NAME> ' s iron ring , and the rivets of the iron ring held tight .
What do you say ; ' <NAME> , with his hat in his hand , gave a beat upon the crown at every little division of his sentences , as if it were a tambourine ; ' to his being seen—night after night—watching the <NAME> ? —to his lurking about there—after dark ? —To its striking Mrs. Sparsit—that he could be lurking for no good—To her calling <NAME> ' s attention to him , and their both taking notice of him—And to its appearing on inquiry to-day—that he was also noticed by the neighbours ? ' Having come to the climax , <NAME> , like an oriental dancer , put his tambourine on his head .
' Will you let him go like that , when you can wring money from him ?
' What ought I to do then , <NAME> ? ' I inquired , after looking at the fire a little while .
If his progress downward had been attended with difficulties and uncertainty , his journey back was infinitely more perplexing .
<NAME> is what you want , afore all other things , and may you be able to show yourself smart with that there balsam for the still small woice of a wounded mind !
That interest exhausted , I took a survey of the inn ' s two parlours , which were decorated with coloured prints of <NAME> , and President <NAME> , and of a white-faced young lady ( much speckled by the flies ) , who held up her gold neck-chain for the admiration of the spectator , and informed all admiring comers that she was ' Just Seventeen : ' although I should have thought her older .
" Very easily said ! " remarked <NAME> , amiably repressing a sob , while a hitch came into her upper lip , and her tears overflowed .
You have been dreaming again ! ' The time being come for the renewal of his acquaintance with the <NAME> family , <NAME> , pursuant to contract made between himself and Mr Meagles within the precincts of Bleeding Heart Yard , turned his face on a certain Saturday towards <NAME> , where Mr <NAME> had a cottage-residence of his own .
You have now a -- hum -- a great position to support .
'It seems to go right through one , ' added the old man , touching his side .
' No , ' said Mr Dombey , with magnificent indifference .
And if I had , I shouldn ' t know how to do it. ' ' I am far from being clear as to the last particular , ' returned Mortimer , with great composure , ' that I have much advantage over you. ' ' I hate , ' said <NAME> , putting his legs up on the opposite seat , ' I hate my profession. ' ' Shall I incommode you , if I put mine up too ? ' returned Mortimer .
<NAME> had received a similar letter and had made a similar response .
<NAME> , " said <NAME> , " is -- a -- I do n't know that I can describe him to you better than by saying that he is the husband of Mrs .
' We always , in this house , propose a month -- an initiatory month .
with which the <NAME> concluded .
Bust me if I do n't think he 'd been a drinking ! " His message perplexed his mind to that degree that he was fain , several times , to take off his hat to scratch his head .
' Where did it happen ? ' ' It happened , ' returned the man , with a ruminative air , as he drew his right hand across his chin , and dipped the other in the pocket of his rough outer coat , ' it happened somewhere about here as I reckon .
' Then , ' said my aunt , after a rest , ' there ' s <NAME> .
My daughter Dora having , unhappily , no mother , <NAME> is obliging enough to become her companion and protector. ' A passing thought occurred to me that <NAME> , like the pocket instrument called a life-preserver , was not so much designed for purposes of protection as of assault .
I never thought that I had a curious couple of guardians , in my aunt and <NAME> .
He went into <NAME> ' s room like light and air , brightening and refreshing it as if he were healthy weather .
His tears were soon dried , much sooner than on the former occasion ; and he was presently afterwards very high with his valet , as a way of righting himself for having shed any .
But he is soon relieved by her saying she is very glad to have been there again , and by her talking quite cheerfully about it all , as they walked on by the sea .
In Secret The traveller fared slowly on his way , who fared towards <NAME> from <NAME> in the autumn of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-two .

Rather baulked , Mr Riderhood evasively remarked , with an innocent air , that he believed the T ' other Governor had asked him summa ' t .
" I know no more , ma'am , than the dead , " she replied , glancing compassionately at him .
Then <NAME> arose , and gathering her shawl about her , covering her face with it , and weeping aloud , went slowly to the door .
Her books , her music , and her daily teachers , were her only real companions , <NAME> and <NAME> excepted : of whom the former , in her attendance on the studies of her young mistress , began to grow quite learned herself , while the latter , softened possibly by the same influences , would lay his head upon the window-ledge , and placidly open and shut his eyes upon the street , all through a summer morning ; sometimes pricking up his head to look with great significance after some noisy dog in a cart , who was barking his way along , and sometimes , with an exasperated and unaccountable recollection of his supposed enemy in the neighbourhood , rushing to the door , whence , after a deafening disturbance , he would come jogging back with a ridiculous complacency that belonged to him , and lay his jaw upon the window-ledge again , with the air of a dog who had done a public service .
<NAME> assented , and he crept back in the shadow of the wall to his own lodging .
' Well ? ' said <NAME> , coming back to her chair , as if she had only been taking a casual look at the prospect ; ' and when do you expect -- ' ' I am all in a tremble , ' faltered my mother .
Your conduct has always been of the most delicate and obliging description .
There is no better among my people at home ; no better among your people. ' ' Granted .
And I ' ll slip those after him that shall talk too much ; that won ' t be shook away ; that ' ll hang to him like leeches , and slink arter him like foxes .

' Save the man ! ' cried <NAME> .

You Bob <NAME> there , put the chain upon the door and get ye down to your supper. ' With an alacrity that seemed no less referable to the pepperer fact than to the supper fact , <NAME> obeyed , and his boots were heard descending towards the bed of the river .
' What have you got there , <NAME> ? ' ' This , ' returned Mr Dombey , ' is some cold preparation of calf ' s head , I think .
We ' ll go down this way , as you may like to see the yard , and it ' s all in the road .
' I am sorry for that .
Let ' s rinse our mouths with a drop of burnt sherry ; the last-comer shall stand it , <NAME> shall fetch it , and I ' ll help to drink it .
" It ca n't last for ever , " returned <NAME> with a fierceness kindling in him which again presented to me that last sad reminder .
Here , in a corner my indentures were duly signed and attested , and I was " bound " ; <NAME> holding me all the while as if we had looked in on our way to the scaffold , to have those little preliminaries disposed of .

' How is it possible , sir , that you ever can come right when you ' re always wrong ?
As to himself , Mr <NAME> conveyed to the <NAME> family that he was going , on rather particular business , wherever they were going .

' My dear , it ' s not my fault , ' said the gentleman .
She was exactly the same as when they had parted , just as handsome , just as scornful , just as repressed .

While they were thus employed , the matron , who had been impatiently watching until the dying woman should awaken from her stupor , joined them by the fire , and sharply asked how long she was to wait ?

<NAME> and visdom , <NAME> , alvays grows together. ' As <NAME> delivered this infallible maxim -- the result of many years ' personal experience and observation -- he contrived , by a dexterous twist of his body , to get the bottom button of his coat to perform its office .
However probable it was to him , she had heard of no such thing .
Therefore , what I say to you , <NAME> , <NAME> , is , do n't you go and let yourself be put out of the way because of my knowing anything of your family affairs . "
I have gone aside from my purpose ; I was speaking about our being friends .
Now , it is a fact , that there was nothing at all particular about the knocker on the door , except that it was very large .
The woman hastily lifts up her eyes as if she would deny that her injury is referable to such a cause .
Make up your mind quick , <NAME> .
You ' ll make out that there ' s a speck of something or another there , and you ' ll know it ' s me , and you ' ll come down that cause ' ay to me .
What power of cannon might it take to shake that rusty old man out of his immovable composure ?
" If it 's a point of conspiracy , you need n't take the trouble to mention it .
But it came about in this way .
' Mr <NAME> ' s speeches were detestable to me , shocking to me , ' said <NAME> , startling that gentleman with another stamp of her little foot .
The window-shutters were closed ; the street was empty ; not a soul had awakened to the business of the day .
As it pleased Heaven in its mercy to restore him so soon , I should have great hope .
In the vestry the fire was smoking ; and an over-aged and over-worked and under-paid attorney ' s clerk , ' making a search , ' was running his forefinger down the parchment pages of an immense register ( one of a long series of similar volumes ) gorged with burials .
<NAME> , with an hysterical explosion that was as much a laugh as a sob , and as much a sob as a laugh , answered , ' Mr Toots ! ' The smile that appeared on <NAME> ' s face passed from it in a moment , and her eyes filled with tears .
What do you see written there ? ' The waiter read : ' Datchery. ' ' Now you know my name , ' said the gentleman ; ' <NAME> .
Therefore <NAME> said , though still not without a certain boastfulness and triumph in her legacy , that Mr F. ' s <NAME> was ' very lively to-day , and she thought they had better go. ' But Mr F. ' s <NAME> proved so lively as to take the suggestion in unexpected dudgeon and declare that she would not go ; adding , with several injurious expressions , that if ' He ' -- too evidently meaning <NAME> -- wanted to get rid of her , ' let him chuck her out of winder ; ' and urgently expressing her desire to see ' Him ' perform that ceremony .
It may be that I should have done better by keeping out of the net into which my destiny has worked me , but I think not , though I dare say you will soon hear , if you have not already heard , a very different opinion .
I am a citizen of the world. ' His theatrical air , as he stood with one arm on his hip within the folds of his cloak , together with his manner of disregarding his companion and addressing the opposite wall instead , seemed to intimate that he was rehearsing for the President , whose examination he was shortly to undergo , rather than troubling himself merely to enlighten so small a person as <NAME> .
' Do you know will he be long , sir ? ' asked <NAME> , with bashful hesitation .
The unusual apparition was followed by another bonnet .
Is the man born yet , is the spade wrought yet ?
' What do you think of this request , <NAME> ? ' murmured <NAME> .
These were not easily disposed of ; the good Captain being a mighty slow , gruff reader , and frequently stopping at a hard word to give himself such encouragement as ' Now , my lad !
He therefore resolved that he would take advantage of that evening ' s freedom to go down to <NAME> and Co. ' s , easily to be found by the direction set forth in the handbill ; and see the place , and ask a question or two there himself .
The letter was lying before me just completed , when I was told that a lady waited , who wished to see me .
But they take me on ; and <NAME> talks to me ; and when we get home , puts some water to my lips ; and when I ask his leave to go up to my room , dismisses me with the gentleness of a woman .
If these flattering attentions to herself were not sufficient proofs , <NAME> ' s confidential friend had suffered the secret to escape him in so many words .
' Can you one ? ' inquired the old lady .
' Shall I order a private room , <NAME> ? ' inquired <NAME> , when they reached the Bush .
The man who lay on the ledge of the grating was even chilled .
This is to be my little wife ! " And she says , half bold and half shy , and half a laughing and half a crying , " Yes , <NAME> !
Mrs MacStinger in retort , looked at her all over .
Without doubt it is safe , for no one beyond ourselves can decipher it ; but shall we always be able to decipher it -- or , I ought to say , will she ? " " <NAME> , " returned <NAME> , drawing himself up , " if madame my wife undertook to keep the register in her memory alone , she would not lose a word of it -- not a syllable of it .
The idea of a girl with a really fine head of hair , having to do it by one flat candle and a few inches of looking-glass ! ' ' You caught <NAME> with it , <NAME> , bad as your means of dressing it are. ' ' You low little thing .
Who was he ? " " Your clemency , <NAME> !
' Death of my soul ! ' he exclaimed .
I could forgive him a great deal for doing , with such promptitude , so exactly what I would have done myself ! ' Mrs <NAME> was in the full glow of her gratification , when a double knock was heard at the door .
Mr <NAME> , I am not quite a stranger here .
" That 's the message , " observes <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> was no less surprised , although his astonishment was not expressed in the same eccentric manner .
'Here 's somebody wants to see you , to ask you some questions , I suppose .
<NAME> to twist and turn as the <NAME> has ever been , he is sufficiently rigid now ; and not without much shuffling of attendant feet , and tilting of his bier this way and that way , and peril even of his sliding off it and being tumbled in a heap over the balustrades , can he be got up stairs .
I only entreat you to believe , my favourite child , that I have meant to do right. ' He said it earnestly , and to do him justice he had .
When such as I , who have no certain roof but the coffinlid , and no friend in sickness or death but the hospital nurse , set our rotten hearts on any man , and let him fill the place that has been a blank through all our wretched lives , who can hope to cure us ?
Be this as it may , another light was obtained , and <NAME> was conducted through a maze of rooms , and a labyrinth of passages , to the apartment which had been prepared for his reception , where the girl bade him good-night and left him alone .
Imposing on you to give their Grubbers nothing but blame , and to give them nothing but credit !
<NAME> mine , <NAME> Dombey. ' ' No , no , no , ' said <NAME> , checking him in the act of impetuously pulling off his own .
The great man -- the rich relation -- the unmarried uncle -- who had it in his power to make Morleena an heiress , and the very baby a legatee -- was offended .
<NAME> pride wouldn ' t have schoolmasters brought here , like doctors , to look at a bad case .
The roads were very heavy for the horses , but the pathway was generally good , so we alighted and walked up all the hills , and liked it so well that we prolonged our walk on the level ground when we got to the top .
Quietly , quietly , all the lines of the plan of the great <NAME> melted one after another .
Reflecting on the absurdity of giving way to such feelings , however , he trimmed the light again , and read as follows : -- ' Yes ! -- a madman ' s !
Her next , to go back , and to enter ; and this second impulse held her in irresolution on the staircase .
You see that I am composed , and is it nothing to me ? ' She resumed her steady voice and manner as she said the latter words , and added presently : ' Not wholly estranged .
You have as good a head for understanding such things as I have met with. ' ' A totally uneducated one , I am sorry to add , ' said <NAME> .
<NAME> ' s promised letter -- what a comfortable letter it was ! -- arrived before ' the half ' was many weeks old ; and with it a cake in a perfect nest of oranges , and two bottles of cowslip wine .
At six o ' clock every mornin ' they let ' s go the ropes at one end , and down falls the lodgers .
What I have to do is to respect them , to wish to be admitted to their friendship , to look up at the eminence on which they are placed from my lowlier station -- for , whether viewed as tobacco or viewed as the lock , I well know it is lowly -- and ever wish them well and happy. ' There really was a genuineness in the poor fellow , and a contrast between the hardness of his hat and the softness of his heart ( albeit , perhaps , of his head , too ) , that was moving .
" For there <NAME> chords , Jobling -- " <NAME> begs pardon again .
She went to sleep with a little bracelet he had given her clasped upon her arm .
" You have just come down ? " said <NAME> , edging me a little away with his shoulder .
" Nineteen , " repeats my Lady thoughtfully .
What is it you are not ?
It ' ll begin to be carted off to-morrow. ' ' Have you been out to take leave of your old friend , sir ? ' asked <NAME> , jocosely .
'It 's a long time , ' said <NAME> .
A question now arises , with relation to his nose. ' ' Flat , ' said <NAME> .
' I know her well. ' ' Look at the broken scull .
Nor was it relieved by any glimpse of the little creature who had brought him there .
<NAME> <NAME> takes the chair , and three members of <NAME> are positively coming .
Now tell me , my love .
" Jo , " whispers the law-stationer softly as the boy lingers on the step .
' I declare , ' she sobbed , ' I never was so cut up since your mama and my papa not <NAME> and <NAME> for this once but give the precious little thing a cup of tea and make her put it to her lips at least pray <NAME> do , not even Mr F. ' s last illness for that was of another kind and gout is not a child ' s affection though very painful for all parties and Mr F. a martyr with his leg upon a rest and the wine trade in itself inflammatory for they will do it more or less among themselves and who can wonder , it seems like a dream I am sure to think of nothing at all this morning and now <NAME> of money is it really , but you must know my darling love because you never will be strong enough to tell him all about it upon teaspoons , mightn ' t it be even best to try the directions of my own medical man for though the flavour is anything but agreeable still I force myself to do it as a prescription and find the benefit , you ' d rather not why no my dear I ' d rather not but still I do it as a duty , everybody will congratulate you some in earnest and some not and many will congratulate you with all their hearts but none more so I do assure you from the bottom of my own I do myself though sensible of blundering and being stupid , and will be judged by <NAME> not <NAME> and <NAME> for this once so good-bye darling and God bless you and may you be very happy and excuse the liberty , vowing that the dress shall never be finished by anybody else but shall be laid by for a keepsake just as it is and called <NAME> though why that strangest of denominations at any time I never did myself and now I never shall ! ' <NAME> , in taking leave of her favourite .
' As I was coming out , ' said Mr Toots , ' the young woman , in the most unexpected manner , took me into the pantry. ' The <NAME> seemed , for the moment , to object to this proceeding ; and leaning back in his chair , looked at Mr Toots with a distrustful , if not threatening visage .
And them and their descendants , to the last of their race , I , <NAME> , unhappy prisoner , do this last night of the year 1767 , in my unbearable agony , denounce to the times when all these things shall be answered for .
We found our old lodging vacant , and in half an hour were quietly established there , as if we had never gone away .
Occupied with such thoughts as these , and a crowd of others all tending to the same point , I continued to pace the street for two long hours ; at length the rain began to descend heavily , and then over-powered by fatigue though no less interested than I had been at first , I engaged the nearest coach and so got home .
' It is so , ' the Secretary admitted .
I have reason to know that a local friend of ours ( on whom I beg to bestow a passing but a hearty malediction , with the kind permission of my reverend friend ) sneaks to and fro , and dodges up and down .
Waiting until they were all tolerably quiet and composed again , <NAME> , who stood in need of some rest after his long journey , retired to his own room , and throwing himself , dressed as he was , upon the bed , fell into a sound sleep .
And here he gave another impudent look , which made <NAME> very wroth , because as you all know , gentlemen , to hear an old fellow , who ought to know better , talking about these things , is very unpleasant -- nothing more so .
An excited imagination might suppose that there was something in them so terrific as to drive the rest of the composition , not only the attendant big-legged boys , but the clouds and flowers and pillars too -- in short , the very body and soul of <NAME> , and all the brains it has -- stark mad .
They must have powerful motives for a secret residence , or be reduced to a destitute condition indeed , who seek a refuge in <NAME> 's <NAME> .
Why do you listen ? ' asked the lady .
We now turned into another narrow street .
<NAME> has frequently told me before that he 's a Lincolnshire man , and I says to my old Lignum that night , 'Lignum , that 's his mother for five and for-ty pound ! ' "
' I don ' t know whether you happen to have read many books of <NAME> , Mr Rokesmith ? ' said R. W. ' I have read several. ' ' Well , you know , there ' s usually a King <NAME> , or a King Boy , or a King <NAME> , or a King <NAME> , or <NAME> , or Rum , or Junk , or whatever name the sailors may have happened to give him. ' ' Where ? ' asked <NAME> .
The only utterance with which he indulged his sorrow , was the frequent exclamation that his brother was gone , alone ; that they had been together in the outset of their lives , that they had fallen into misfortune together , that they had kept together through their many years of poverty , that they had remained together to that day ; and that his brother was gone alone , alone !
I dare say he don ' t .
' Come , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
I felt for my old self as the dead may feel if they ever revisit these scenes .
' Who is it ? ' cried <NAME> again .
<NAME> , always flying bat-like about <NAME> 's Court and skimming in and out at everybody 's windows , does say that Mrs. Snagsby is jealous and inquisitive and that <NAME> is sometimes worried out of house and home , and that if he had the spirit of a mouse he would n't stand it .
' Yes , <NAME> , and supper , ' added <NAME> .
How many old recollections , and how many dormant sympathies , does <NAME> time awaken !
" It 's not convenient , " said <NAME> , " and it 's not fair .
" He is a fine young soldier now , <NAME> , by the name of <NAME> .
When I look at you , ' said the lawyer , quitting his stool , and standing before the fire with his back towards it , ' I am reminded of the sweetest little face that ever my eyes beheld .
The object of this new liking was not among his myrmidons .
The wet ground reeked and smoked , after the heavy fall of rain , and the croaking of the frogs ( whose noise in these parts is almost incredible ) sounded as though a million of fairy teams with bells were travelling through the air , and keeping pace with us .
' Though as to master , ' said he , glancing again at <NAME> , ' not master onny more .
Oh , my fellow-countrymen , what warning but this did I give you ?
The <NAME> had no more tenderness or poetry in it , than the bar of a public-house .
" On the contrary , it seems to do you good , miss , judging from your appearance . "
Now you know me , do n't you ? "
Shall I remind you that I am not , and that I never was , anything but the friend whom you agreed to trust ?
A wave as of triumph ?
Have you lurked to my house fifty times , and slept sound in a corner when you had no other bed but the paving-stones , and do you talk to me like this !
That time , to which he has so long , and certainly with great constancy , looked forward , is now come .
" I have got it here , sir . "
'What a pity , <NAME> , my dear , that there 's none quite ready to be done . '
<NAME> and solemn were the score of rubbers in which <NAME> and the old lady played together ; uproarious was the mirth of the round table .
he asks in an insinuating tone .
'So , you 're going on to <NAME> , are you ? '
In our boyish want of discretion I dare say we took too much to drink , and I know we talked too much .
' Well , <NAME> , ' she began , ' what do you think of the proctor plan ?
Arrived at the table , she took her rigid seat , after favouring Mr <NAME> with a glare for himself , which caused the young gentleman to retire to his place in much confusion .
As yet , none. " " Is it the immediate object of this confidence , that you may at once ascertain that , with my knowledge ? " " Not even so .
It was the face of <NAME> , and through all the terrified avoidance it expressed , there was pity in it , sorrow , a grateful tender memory .
" This woman understands me , " <NAME> thinks as she lets her glance fall again .
<NAME> was the better for it , or thought of being so .
That is his employer , gentlemen .
It ' s amazing what places they used to put the guineas in , wrapped up in rags .
And let me remind you that the door is standing open , and your young friend waiting for you on the stairs. ' ' When I accompanied that youth here , sir , I did so with the purpose of adding , as a man whom you should not be permitted to put aside , in case you put him aside as a boy , that his instinct is correct and right. ' Thus <NAME> , with great effort and difficulty .
' Pray , ' said <NAME> , in great confusion , while these preliminaries were in course of completion .
We had other visitors besides <NAME> .
<NAME> taps , that wall represented by that hammer , and says , after good sounding : " Something betwixt us ! " Sure enough , some rubbish has been left in that same six-foot space by <NAME> ' s men ! ' <NAME> opines that such accuracy ' is a gift. ' ' I wouldn ' t have it at a gift , ' returns <NAME> , by no means receiving the observation in good part .
I overheard that he began to ask the drivers of coaches and other vehicles coming towards us what passengers they had seen in other coaches and vehicles that were in advance .
Here were the rotten beam , the sinking arch , the sapped and mouldering wall , the lowly trench of earth , the stately tomb on which no epitaph remained -- all -- marble , stone , iron , wood , and dust -- one common monument of ruin .
Here are the other passengers .
' Glad to hear it , <NAME> .
<NAME> had put up the steps , and was preparing to jump upon the box , when he felt himself gently touched on the shoulder ; and , looking round , his father stood before him .
He went , like the rain , among the just and unjust , doing all the good he could , and neither proclaiming it in the synagogues nor at the corner of streets .
I go to seek an hotel ! ' But , there his eyes encountered <NAME> , who was still at his post .
' <NAME> , ' said the Major , ' I ' m glad to see you .
It ' s rather a good name , I think , sir. ' ' A very good name , indeed , ' said <NAME> , wholly unable to repress a smile .
' Our friend had a remote connexion with that event , ' said the Major , ' and all the credit that belongs to her , J .
'Wait quietly only one instant , while I speak to aunt . '
He had a glass and bottle in his hand , and was in the act of drinking .
Here , all the light clouds of the more solemn part of the proceedings passed away ; every face shone forth joyously ; and nothing was to be heard but congratulations and commendations .
I have nothing to do with it indeed ! ' <NAME> looked at her with his eyes stretched wide ; and opened and shut his mouth a great many times ; but couldn ' t get out one word .
Then they go upstairs , <NAME> heavily , and <NAME> ( for it is he ) very lightly indeed .
At last Mrs. Micawber resolved to move into the prison , where <NAME> had now secured a room to himself .
" Of course , there can be no objection to your being sorry for him , and I 'd put down a five-pound note myself to get him out of it .
He had meant to go away to-day , but clung to this tie in the house as the last and only thing left to him .
' I feel it as a wery high compliment , sir ; it ' s a wery honorable thing to them , as they knows how to reward merit werever they meets it .
I don ' t think I could have done more , then , without letting my hold on father go ; but they sometimes lie heavy on my mind .
And reassured , " Since that 's the case -- " " Yes !
Personally , or by letter , you will always find me here , sir , with my shoulder to the wheel . "
For if great talent and skill are necessary for two pantomimes to paint their thoughts and feelings by the movements of the body , and the expression of the countenance , how much greater the difficulty when darkness shrouds them both , and the one can hear no sound .
He has mastered papa ' s weaknesses , fostered them , and taken advantage of them , until -- to say all that I mean in a word , <NAME> , -- until papa is afraid of him. ' There was more that she might have said ; more that she knew , or that she suspected ; I clearly saw .
I ' m struck of a heap , and can ' t do it , ' he said , impatiently .
And what ' s this in dancing-shoes ?
" I want to know no more than I know .
Your habit of interrupting without having the least thing in the world to say , distracts one .
" Why , " the attorney said to me one day , " if I wanted this office to give me two or three thousand pounds instead of take it , I couldn ' t have more trouble about it. " " You are right , old fellow , " I told him , " and in future you ' ll know that we have something to do here. " ' The pleasant young <NAME> finished by once more laughing heartily .
<NAME> and his daughter were sitting there alone .
<NAME> said he did n't believe there ever was such a goose cooked .
' Let us have some of your best wine to-day , waiter , ' said old <NAME> , rubbing his hands .
And I called him a quantity of names ; ' shaking her head over her work , and dropping tears .
Answering the touch for a moment , but not coldly , her father rested his hands upon the arms of his chair , and looked up for the first time since the beginning of the conference .
Very uncomfortable. ' ' They ' re all on ' em men as has met vith some disappointment in life , ' said <NAME> , senior .
Others rather inclined to the belief that he had projected some distant tour , and was at present occupied in effecting the preliminary arrangements ; but this again was stoutly denied by <NAME> himself , who had unequivocally stated , when cross-examined by <NAME> , that no new journeys were to be undertaken .
<NAME> <NAME> was excited and indignant .
That , he called with confidence on the jury to come and do likewise .
' Are you going ? ' said <NAME> , whose heart sank within her at the result of her stratagem , but who affected a light indifference notwithstanding .
Much marked with irons. ' ' Ran away , the negress Fanny .
I have no design whatever .
I incline as little to the sickly feeling which makes every canting lie or maudlin speech of a notorious criminal a subject of newspaper report and general sympathy , as I do to those good old customs of the good old times which made <NAME> , even so recently as in the reign of the Third King <NAME> , in respect of her criminal code and her prison regulations , one of the most bloody-minded and barbarous countries on the earth .
The key was put in the lock , and turned .
We bestow a fragment of our minds upon you , sir , you see ! "
Is he quite heartbroken ? ' <NAME> was of a tender nature , and there was something in this appeal that moved her very much .
' It ain ' t right of you to ask it , <NAME> , for you know I can ' t refuse you , but <NAME> and me will see what can be done , if <NAME> likes , I may wish , you see , to take a voyage to <NAME> , <NAME> , but I mayn ' t know how to leave the <NAME> Docks. ' <NAME> assented to the proposition .
It is one of those nooks where a few smoky sparrows twitter in smoky trees , as though they called to one another , ' Let us play at country , ' and where a few feet of garden-mould and a few yards of gravel enable them to do that refreshing violence to their tiny understandings .
After this , he stirred the fire ; after that , he rubbed his hands and looked at <NAME> .
There was something in the picture of <NAME> bestowing his deportment on <NAME> that quite took my fancy .
' I hope , ' said <NAME> , looking about him with great ruefulness , as <NAME> disappeared with the two old women : ' I hope that this unfortunate little circumstance will not deprive me of my porochial office ? '
A few hampers , half-a-dozen broken bottles , and such-like rubbish , may be thrown there , when the tenant first moves in , but nothing more ; and there they remain until he goes away again : the damp straw taking just as long to moulder as it thinks proper : and mingling with the scanty box , and stunted everbrowns , and broken flower-pots , that are scattered mournfully about -- a prey to ' blacks ' and dirt .
To see him splitting away at that pace , and cutting round the corners , and knocking up again ' the posts , and starting on again as if he was made of iron as well as them , and me with the wipe in my pocket , singing out arter him -- oh , my eye ! '
It was a wretched little shop , with a roof that any man standing in it could touch with his hand ; little better than a cellar or cave , down three steps .
The confidences of lovely women are not to be slighted .
The stately residence of <NAME> was altogether blighted and deserted .
No struggle , no consciousness of peril , no entreaty—and yet I never saw _that_ before. ' With a start .
If ever delay was dangerous , it 's dangerous now ; and if ever you could n't afterwards forgive yourself for causing it , this is the time .
When we got to our journey ' s end , our first pursuit was to look about for a little lodging for <NAME> , where her brother could have a bed .
The many sounds become so deadened that the change is like putting cotton in the ears , or having the head thickly muffled .
' No , <NAME> , ' continued Mrs. Sparsit , ' say an individual , and I will hear you ; say <NAME> , and you must excuse me. ' ' With the usual exception , ma ' am , ' said <NAME> , trying back , ' of an individual. ' ' Ah—h ! ' Mrs. <NAME> repeated the ejaculation , the shake of the head over her tea-cup , and the long gulp , as taking up the conversation again at the point where it had been interrupted .
I think we had better talk about this , really , <NAME> .
He gazed for a few seconds in the face ; then stooped to kiss it -- oh , how tenderly ! -- and drew a handkerchief before it .
" I 've had the pleasure of seeing you before .
The men in the carpet caps go on tumbling the furniture about ; and the gentlemen with the pens and ink make out inventories of it , and sit upon pieces of furniture never made to be sat upon , and eat bread and cheese from the public-house on other pieces of furniture never made to be eaten on , and seem to have a delight in appropriating precious articles to strange uses .
He sees my Lady pretty often , too ; and he and she are as composed , and as indifferent , and take as little heed of one another , as ever .
She still preserved her proud manner , but there was a touch of softness in her voice , as she answered : ' I justify nothing .
Is that a bag ? ' he looked hard at it ; sooth to say , it required hard looking at to be seen at all in a dimly lighted room : ' and is it your property , my dear ? ' ' Yes , sir .
How it is so , is no matter ; that is my story , and I keep my story to myself .
His broad chest heaves with pleasure .
It had been mentioned at the <NAME> , she remarked , on the authority of the journals , that he had been kept in prison for his own safety .
Now I know ye did .
So , by <NAME> , to the <NAME> of <NAME> In <NAME> ; <NAME> ; <NAME> ; <NAME> ; <NAME> ; St. <NAME> ' s .
I much prefer it as it is. ' <NAME> , with head bent down , still clipped among the plants .
It was one of those scenes of life and animation , caught in its very brightest and freshest moments , which can scarcely fail to please ; for if the eye be tired of show and glare , or the ear be weary with a ceaseless round of noise , the one may repose , turn almost where it will , on eager , happy , and expectant faces , and the other deaden all consciousness of more annoying sounds in those of mirth and exhilaration .
But when we got into a warm room in an excellent hotel and sat down , comfortably washed and dressed , to an early breakfast ( for it was too late to think of going to bed ) , <NAME> began to look more cheerful .
In the course of the dinner and the sitting which succeeded it , <NAME> descending , for a few moments , to domestic topics , informed <NAME> that the air of <NAME> not agreeing with his lady , she was then engaged in making a tour of different fashionable watering-places with a view to the recovery of her wonted health and spirits ; this was a delicate veiling of the fact that Mrs. Pott , acting upon her often- repeated threat of separation , had , in virtue of an arrangement negotiated by her brother , the lieutenant , and concluded by <NAME> , permanently retired with the faithful bodyguard upon one moiety or half part of the annual income and profits arising from the editorship and sale of the <NAME> .
But the gallantry of her friends would not allow of this ; and the man in faded black , mounting the breach first , produced his plunder .
' I ' ll go upon my walk at once , ' said <NAME> , ' and then I shall be out of the way , <NAME> Cuttle. ' ' Take a good long ' un , my lad ! ' replied the <NAME> , calling after him .
What could it do , his boy had asked him .
This is my frugal breakfast .
At least , he ain ' t a hated rival , ' said Mr Toots , stopping short , on second thoughts , and taking away his hand ; ' what should I hate him for ?
' <NAME> , ' rejoined Mrs. Sparsit , ' say no more .
The present <NAME> , holding Mr Clennam ' s card in his hand , had a youthful aspect , and the fluffiest little whisker , perhaps , that ever was seen .
<NAME> mental agitation and disturbance was no novelty to him , even before his late sufferings .
Not the curtains at his feet , nor the curtains at his back , but those to which his face was addressed .
Am I never to hear the last of this ?
He never looked so serene as he did then .
But when <NAME> , taking down his pipe from the mantel-shelf gave it into his hand , and entreated him to smoke it , the good Captain was so bewildered by her attention that he held it as if he had never held a pipe , in all his life .
Suddenly , he took the desperate resolution to going back to <NAME> .
' There , ' said <NAME> , when he had quite done ; ' rub away as hard as you like , you won ' t rub that off in a hurry .
' Where have you worked all your life ? ' ' Mostly underground , <NAME> , ' till I got married .
Let ' s wet it , in a mouth-fill of rum and milk , <NAME> ' otherest Governor. ' <NAME> assenting , went with him into an early public-house , haunted by unsavoury smells of musty hay and stale straw , where returning carts , farmers ' men , gaunt dogs , fowls of a beery breed , and certain human nightbirds fluttering home to roost , were solacing themselves after their several manners ; and where not one of the nightbirds hovering about the sloppy bar failed to discern at a glance in the passion-wasted nightbird with respectable feathers , the worst nightbird of all .
His head was sunk upon his bosom ; and he slumbered again .
Discovering his mistake after a while , he appeared to grow rather sleepy and discontented , and had more than once suggested the propriety of an immediate departure , when the door opened , and the child herself appeared .

He ' s no public offender , bless you , now !

' Then all I need observe , is , ' said the <NAME> , ' that you know a angel , and are chartered a angel. ' Mr Toots instantly seized the <NAME> ' s hand , and requested the favour of his friendship .
' My dear Edith , ' said the other , ' I can not help it .
As ugly and withered as one of the fantastic carvings on the under brackets of the stall seats , as malignant as the <NAME> , as hard as the big brass eagle holding the sacred books upon his wings ( and , according to the sculptor ' s representation of his ferocious attributes , not at all converted by them ) , she hugs herself in her lean arms , and then shakes both fists at the leader of the Choir .
A man with a great puffed head and forehead , swelled veins in his temples , and such a strained skin to his face that it seemed to hold his eyes open , and lift his eyebrows up .
He was either taking refreshment in the bosom just mentioned , or he was tearing through the country at from twenty-five to fifty miles an hour , or he was sleeping after his fatigues .

I asked <NAME> whether he had heard if any of the other relations had any legacies ?
<NAME> <NAME> , submitting herself to his judgment , the scheme was worked out with care .
Catching sight of <NAME> , <NAME> dropped the property into the bottom of the boat with perfect unconcern , being evidently oblivious of its existence , and pulling off the glazed hat hailed him lustily .
The rosy children opposite run past with hoops .
But , as an old fellow , who has carried <NAME> in his arms , who is the trusted friend of <NAME> and of her father too , and who has a great affection for them both , I have spoken .
' Quite a matter of form .

I shall think of it with a melancholy satisfaction when I wake up in the night .
In point of fact , we were playing at <NAME> in the <NAME> .

<NAME> <NAME> darted a look of contempt , which might have withered an anchor .
How many pictures of new journeys over pleasant country , of resting-places under the free broad sky , of rambles in the fields and woods , and paths not often trodden -- how many tones of that one well-remembered voice , how many glimpses of the form , the fluttering dress , the hair that waved so gaily in the wind -- how many visions of what had been , and what he hoped was yet to be -- rose up before him , in the old , dull , silent church !
Among the votaries of <NAME> , who disported themselves until <NAME> gave warning for departure , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and the lovely and accomplished <NAME> , fourth daughter of <NAME> , were particularly remarkable. ' I was looking back to the name of <NAME> , pleased to have discovered , in these happier circumstances , <NAME> , formerly poor pinched usher to my <NAME> magistrate , when <NAME> pointing to another part of the paper , my eyes rested on my own name , and I read thus : ' My Dear Sir , ' Years have elapsed , since I had an opportunity of ocularly perusing the lineaments , now familiar to the imaginations of a considerable portion of the civilized world .
Seated at table in the act of drinking , Mr Dorrit still saw him through his wine-glass , regarding him with a cold and ghostly eye .
" How do you do , <NAME> ?
Mr Garland then related to him , how he had a brother ( of whom he would remember to have heard him speak , and whose picture , taken when he was a young man , hung in the best room ) , and how this brother lived a long way off , in a country-place , with an old clergyman who had been his early friend .
The modest sunflower and hollyhock were depicted as flourishing with great luxuriance on this rustic dwelling , while a quantity of dense smoke issuing from the chimney indicated good cheer within , and also , perhaps , that it had not been lately swept .
' A score , ' cried my aunt , with a kind of indignant pride .
Make it your own time .
<NAME> ' t be tempted into twitting me with the past knowledge that you have of me , because it is identical with the past knowledge that I have of you , and in twitting me , you twit yourself , and I don ' t want to hear you do it .

Now ! ' If there were any sound at all , it was so slight that she must have fallen into a confirmed habit of listening for sounds ; but Mr <NAME> believed he did hear a something , like the falling of dry leaves .
I am screaming out loud all the time I write and so is my brother which takes off my attention rather and I hope will excuse mistakes .
My hopes and fears are both fulfilled to-night .
' Then he has no business to do it , ' said <NAME> .
If you have come here to thank me , it was not necessary .
I 'm not a going to be made unlucky by _your_ sneaking .
The truth was , that she had objected to me as an expensive companion who did <NAME> no good , and that , when <NAME> had first proposed to present me to her , she had received the proposal with such very moderate warmth , that <NAME> had felt himself obliged to confide the state of the case to me , with a view to the lapse of a little time before I made her acquaintance .
But you are such a little oddity !
<NAME> <NAME> held it for a little while in his , with his head bowed down .
As we were close to <NAME> then , I would have stopped as a matter of course , only <NAME> would n't stop .
She lost her colour , and the old and intent expression was a constant , not an occasional , thing ; otherwise , she remained very pretty and comely .
Thus it had been brought about that she now sat in her corner of the luxurious carriage with her little patient hands folded before her , quite displaced even from the last point of the old standing ground in life on which her feet had lingered .
This device I executed successfully .
My duty prosperously ended , all between us is ended . "

<NAME> was the singer , and he sang ' When the heart of a man is depressed with care ' .

' With that , he paid the money for his licence ; and , receiving it neatly folded from <NAME> , together with a shake of the hand , and a polite wish for his happiness and the lady ' s , went out of the office .
But I alighted at the <NAME> , and breakfasted there , and walked the rest of the distance ; for I sought to get into the town quietly by the unfrequented ways , and to leave it in the same manner .
But they never blushed upon a change in the new manner of her thought and speech towards her daughter .
When you say THEY say , what do you mean ?
If her faithful slate had had the latent qualities of sympathetic paper , and its pencil those of invisible ink , many a little treatise calculated to astonish the pupils would have come bursting through the dry sums in school-time under the warming influence of <NAME> ' s bosom .
I remember almost hoping that some better change was possible within me .

The <NAME> argued that his present security was too profound and wonderful to endure much longer ; he knew that when the wind stood in a fair quarter , the weathercock was seldom nailed there ; and he was too well acquainted with the determined and dauntless character of Mrs MacStinger , to doubt that that heroic woman had devoted herself to the task of his discovery and capture .
The moon is rising , and where she sits there is a little stream of cold pale light , in which her head is seen .
" If it ever becomes mine , it shall be put into some hands better qualified to free it slowly ( if such a thing is possible ) from the weight that drags it down , so that the miserable people who can not leave it and who have been long wrung to the last point of endurance , may , in another generation , suffer less ; but it is not for me .
But the night covered it , and no one knew .
Then there emerged from the house , Mrs. Pott , who would have looked very like <NAME> if she hadn ' t had a gown on , conducted by <NAME> , who , in his light-red coat could not possibly have been mistaken for anything but a sportsman , if he had not borne an equal resemblance to a general postman .
" Yes -- I -- " After a pause , he added , again settling the crisp flaxen wig at the ears , " It is very difficult to begin. " He did not begin , but , in his indecision , met her glance .
' Dear me ! ' said <NAME> , slapping all his pockets , one after another , and looking into his desk , and under it , and upon it , and wildly tossing the papers about , ' the note , Mr <NAME> , sir , the five-pound note -- what can have become of it ?

To these various attentions , Mr <NAME> submitted in a kind of grateful astonishment beyond the reach of language .
You had better go first with <NAME> , <NAME> .

Some of the craftiest scoundrels that ever walked this earth , or rather -- for walking implies , at least , an erect position and the bearing of a man -- that ever crawled and crept through life by its dirtiest and narrowest ways , will gravely jot down in diaries the events of every day , and keep a regular debtor and creditor account with <NAME> , which shall always show a floating balance in their own favour .

So , they were always looking at palatial residences in the best situations , and always very nearly taking or buying one , but never quite concluding the bargain .

' <NAME> ' t leave me out , <NAME> , ' cried a sharp-faced gentleman , who was sitting on a low chair with a high back , reading the paper .
What do you want ? " " I am going to <NAME> , <NAME> , " said I , " and want to say good-bye to <NAME> Havisham. " I was not expected , for she left me locked in the yard , while she went to ask if I were to be admitted .
I have spoken with my two wards , <NAME> and <NAME> , on the subject of their defective education , and they give in to the plan proposed ; as I should have taken good care they did , whether they liked it or not.

' I want to speak to <NAME> , if you please , ' he said .
He was father ' s partner , and father broke with him , and now he revenges himself .
How strongly will you have it ? ' He threw out the lees of his glass on the ground , so that they nearly spattered <NAME> .

' I begin to infer , from your manner , and these appearances , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> after a pause , and smiling with a trembling lip , ' that I have been ill. ' ' You just have ! ' replied the small servant , wiping her eyes .

For their two faces were alone with the other flowers .
She stood for some moments looking round the room .

Many , who only came to the house on state occasions , hardly knew who <NAME> was , and said , going home , ' Indeed , was that <NAME> , in the corner ?
<NAME> , having carefully copied the address of <NAME> , the uncle and nephew issued forth together in quest of that accomplished gentleman ; <NAME> firmly persuading himself that he had done his relative great injustice in disliking him at first sight ; and Mrs. Nickleby being at some pains to inform her daughter that she was sure he was a much more kindly disposed person than he seemed ; which , <NAME> dutifully remarked , he might very easily be .

There is no patriot in <NAME> -- in <NAME> ?
God , how the sun poured down upon the very spot !

Some little commotion was occasioned in <NAME> , by the pleasantry of the eight gentlemen in the flank , who persevered in walking four abreast ; it was also found necessary to leave the mottled-faced gentleman behind , to fight a ticket-porter , it being arranged that his friends should call for him as they came back .
By corresponding degrees she sank into a chair , then upon her knees , then upon the ground beside the bed , drawing the coverlet with her , half to hide her shamed head and wet hair in it , and half , as it seemed , to embrace it , rather than have nothing to take to her repentant breast .

' My aunt finished eating the piece of toast on which she was then engaged , looking me full in the face all the while ; and then setting her glass on the chimney-piece , and folding her hands upon her folded skirts , replied as follows : ' <NAME> , my child , if I have any object in life , it is to provide for your being a good , a sensible , and a happy man .
What ' s the use of talking about it ! ' returned <NAME> , chafing his face on his coat-sleeve , as if to mortify his flesh , and have it in unison with his spirit .
And so , <NAME> , quite undetermined whether today is the day before yesterday , or the day after to-morrow , or the week after next , fades away ; and <NAME> and <NAME> fade away , and <NAME> fades away , and the stoney aunt goes away -- she declines to fade , proving rock to the last -- and even the unknowns are slowly strained off , and it is all over .

Also , within doors , Mr Inspector was at his studies as of yore .
<NAME> waved his hand in assent , and went his way .
' I will ascertain that myself without loss of time , ' said <NAME> .

He was along with me , sir , down at <NAME> , ill , and a young lady , <NAME> bless her for a good friend to me , took pity on him when I durst n't , and took him home -- " <NAME> shrinks back from him with a sudden horror .

" Never , little woman , " he replied .
From <NAME> I have received every acknowledgment of my social station , and every recognition of my family descent , that I could possibly expect .
When he put his tools aside as useless , until morning , <NAME> rose and said to him : " Will you go out ? " He looked down at the floor on either side of him in the old manner , looked up in the old manner , and repeated in the old low voice : " Out ? " " Yes ; for a walk with me .
Of her once more stopping , and looking back , and hurrying to <NAME> , and giving <NAME> , above all the others , her last kisses and farewells .

' I only know that I ' m a heavy sleeper at first , and a light one towards morning ; and if Mr <NAME> had come through the shop near daybreak , though ever so much on tiptoe , I ' m pretty sure I should have heard him shut the door at all events. ' On mature consideration of this evidence , <NAME> began to think that the Instrument-maker must have vanished of his own accord ; to which logical conclusion he was assisted by the letter addressed to himself , which , as being undeniably in the old man ' s handwriting , would seem , with no great forcing , to bear the construction , that he arranged of his own will to go , and so went .

He tried to prepare himself in vain ; perhaps the effort to prepare himself made him less able to bear it. " " Would he remember what took place in the relapse ? " asked <NAME> , with natural hesitation .
Whether I was to do it or not , ma ' am , I did it .
He never converses when not professionally consulted .
' Dear me -- ah ! ' This reflection was echoed by all present , who said ' Ah ! ' first , and ' dear me , ' afterwards .
' Oh , he ' s a deal better , sir , ' said <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> can give you nothing but camp fare , you see. ' ' Very excellent fare , <NAME> , ' replied his guest ; and not in mere politeness either ; for the Major always took the best possible care of himself , and indeed ate rather more of rich meats than was good for him , insomuch that his Imperial complexion was mainly referred by the faculty to that circumstance .
There ' th nothing comfortable to tell ; why unthettle her mind , and make her unhappy ? " Tho , whether her father bathely detherted her ; or whether he broke hith own heart alone , rather than pull her down along with him ; never will be known , now , <NAME> , till—no , not till we know how the dogth findth uth out ! ' ' She keeps the bottle that he sent her for , to this hour ; and she will believe in his affection to the last moment of her life , ' said <NAME> .
I hope it ' s <NAME> -- I think it must be <NAME> ! ' And then her thoughts flew back to her old predictions , and the number of times she had said , that Kate with no fortune would marry better than other people ' s daughters with thousands ; and , as she pictured with the brightness of a mother ' s fancy all the beauty and grace of the poor girl who had struggled so cheerfully with her new life of hardship and trial , her heart grew too full , and the tears trickled down her face .
And you 'll ease my friend <NAME> 's mind , and his family 's mind , a good deal if you 'll just mention to him what our understanding is . "
<NAME> pauses to look after him and note all this , with a shadowy belief that he has seen the boy before .
There was some discomfiture in his tone as he resumed , though he tried to conceal it .
<NAME> was drafted into the service of Mrs. Strong , where I saw her every day .
My dear girl is with her father ; and if you 'll wait till she comes down , I 'll make you known to her , and then we 'll go upstairs .
The leap from that knowledge to the inference that <NAME> set herself to teach _her_ something , was easy .
To be the friend of <NAME> you must reject all circumstantial evidence , all reason , observation , and experience , and repose a blind belief in the bookcase .
At this high point , <NAME> ' s friendship remained for three whole days , much to the wonderment of <NAME> ' s young ladies who had never beheld such constancy in that quarter , before ; but on the fourth , it received a check no less violent than sudden , which thus occurred .
As the muffins disappear , little by little , the black shelves and nooks and corners begin to appear , and Mr Wegg gradually acquires an imperfect notion that over against him on the chimney-piece is a <NAME> baby in a bottle , curved up with his big head tucked under him , as he would instantly throw a summersault if the bottle were large enough .
that I should have been fooling here ! ' Accompanying these words with an impatient stamp upon the ground , he tore himself from the manager ' s detaining grasp , and darting rapidly down the street was out of sight in an instant .
He lies there , dressed in shirt and trousers , with bare feet .
I asked him what he thought <NAME> ' s state of mind was , in reference to the cause of their misfortunes ?
But when I found the child was not less fond of me , and drew its soft hand over my face with a kind of pitying protection in its touch , that soon set me up again .
The determined reticence of <NAME> , however , was not to be so approached .
Charles. ' ' Then , tell <NAME> I want to see him. ' ' You shall see , ' said <NAME> , getting off his stool with great agility , ' you shall see , not only <NAME> , but <NAME> likewise. ' <NAME> stopped , looked steadily and severely at <NAME> , nodded his head once , in a curt manner which seemed to say there was a little more behind , and vanished .
' You will be a friend to me , won ' t you ? ' ' I hope so .
Mr <NAME> would be now reduced to saying as he booked the case , ' Well !
I said " Not at all ! "
" Nor ever will be , " says my Lady .
very good -- husband for daughter -- biter bit -- make it public -- not for worlds -- look stupid -- very ! ' ' Wretch , ' said <NAME> , ' we scorn your base insinuations. ' ' I always hated him , ' added <NAME> .
Thus they continued to ask each other who called so loud , over and over again ; and when <NAME> had that by heart <NAME> went to another sentence , and then to two at a time , and then to three , and so on , until at midnight poor <NAME> found to his unspeakable joy that he really began to remember something about the text .
Of cliffs and buildings , and a windmill , and a church , becoming more and more visible upon it .
Badly enough at first , but better now. ' ' And here have I , ' said <NAME> , in something of a self-reproachful tone , ' been a learning and a learning , and here has Mr Boffin been a paying and a paying , ever so long ! ' ' I have heard what your trade is , ' observed <NAME> ; ' it ' s cabinet-making. ' Mr <NAME> nodded .
' Finish your dinner , and walk out with me .
He faintly wipes his forehead with his handkerchief and gasps .
They turned round to the left , a short way past the public-house ; and then , taking a right-hand road , walked on for a long time : passing many large gardens and gentlemen 's houses on both sides of the way , and stopping for nothing but a little beer , until they reached a town .
My mother has a little property , which takes the form of a small life annuity , upon which she lives in an independent though unassuming manner in the <NAME> .
It was a maxim with Mr Brass that the habit of paying compliments kept a man ' s tongue oiled without any expense ; and , as that useful member ought never to grow rusty or creak in turning on its hinges in the case of a practitioner of the law , in whom it should be always glib and easy , he lost few opportunities of improving himself by the utterance of handsome speeches and eulogistic expressions .
He is , as it were suddenly , grown very old .
To this compliment <NAME> replied , that she had a relish for the amusement , and had no intention to forego its gratification .
She watched and waited months for a seamstress .
<NAME> and comfortless , boastfully and doggedly rich , there the room stared at its present occupants , unsoftened and unrelieved by the least trace of any womanly occupation .
' It ' s all in training , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
But whatever she looked at ; sun , moon , stars , or bracelet ; she looked no more at the Major .
' Is it any harm ? ' asked <NAME> , smiling .
' My friend <NAME> , <NAME> ' am , ' returned the Major , ' may be devoted to her in secret , but a man who is paramount in the greatest city in the universe -- ' ' No one can be a stranger , ' said <NAME> , ' to Mr <NAME> ' s immense influence. ' As Mr <NAME> acknowledged the compliment with a bend of his head , the younger lady glancing at him , met his eyes .
Is it the <NAME> of <NAME> ? ' ' What an amazing flow of spirits ! ' cried <NAME> .
So much the greater must have been the solitude of her heart , and her need of some one on whom to bestow it .
" Keep your eyes upon me , dear child , and mind no other object. " " I mind nothing while I hold your hand .
It was not strong enough to impell him to sacrifice himself and spare her , but it was a strong emotion .
She doesn ' t seem so desolate .
<NAME> punch is a pleasant thing , gentlemen -- an extremely pleasant thing under any circumstances -- but in that snug old parlour , before the roaring fire , with the wind blowing outside till every timber in the old house creaked again , <NAME> found it perfectly delightful .
Mr <NAME> and his partner played several rubbers with varying success , until the loss of three sixpences , the gradual sinking of the purl , and the striking of ten o ' clock , combined to render that gentleman mindful of the flight of <NAME> , and the expediency of withdrawing before Mr <NAME> and <NAME> returned .
They all think so. ' ' Well , I suppose they do , ' says <NAME> , meditating aloud .
<NAME> as she was when her mama died , she remembered how the tears would come into her eyes when she spoke of him and of the noble generosity of his character , which she had said was to be trusted above all earthly things ; and <NAME> trusted it .
She was up in my study , <NAME> said : which it was her pride to keep in readiness and order for me .
' This , ' he said aloud , taking me by the hand , and advancing to the fantastic figure with great politeness—not raising her suspicions by the slightest look or whisper , or any kind of aside , to me : ' This lady is the hostess of this mansion , sir .
' <NAME> ! ' exclaimed the <NAME> , ' let go , will you ?
It is immensely received in turf-circles .
' Try a little something green , ' said <NAME> , handing him the basket .
She was its very light and life .
' Cases there are , ' said <NAME> , delicately crooking the little finger of her favourite hand , and making her remarks neater by that neat action ; ' cases there are where a man is not young or elegant , and is rich , and has a handsome establishment already .
' And how is your friend , the faithful <NAME> ? ' ' Digby ! ' said <NAME> , forgetting at the instant that this had been <NAME> ' s theatrical name .
' You ' re a steady <NAME> , and I was not mistaken .
The single exception to this rule perhaps was Mr Carker , who now smiled among the company , and who , as he stood in the circle that was gathered about <NAME> -- watchful of her , of them , his chief , <NAME> and the Major , <NAME> , and everything around -- appeared at ease with both divisions of guests , and not marked as exclusively belonging to either .
The murderer swung lifeless against the wall ; and the boy , thrusting aside the dangling body which obscured his view , called to the people to come and take him out , for <NAME> 's sake .
It was abandoned as soon as tried , and he wore his grizzled hair cut short .
<NAME> <NAME> replied in the affirmative .
<NAME> , my eldest ( twelve ) , is the boy who sent out his pocket-money , to the amount of five and threepence , to the <NAME> .
Did I see among them , the intelligence and refinement : the true , honest , patriotic heart of <NAME> ?
Did n't he owe us immense sums , all round ?
' What news have you brought me ?
In another moment , he stood , fixed and immovable with folded arms , regarding his nephew with a scowl ; while <NAME> and <NAME> threw themselves between the two , to prevent the personal violence which the fierce excitement of <NAME> appeared to threaten .
' I must have a full suit of mourning , <NAME> , and a hatband , to wisit him in , afore he sets out upon his travels .
We come to the spot , sink down in the mire nearly to the coach windows , tilt on one side at an angle of forty-five degrees , and stick there .
' <NAME> , ' said Mr Toots , ' I should wish to be strictly honourable ; but I trust I may be allowed now , to allude to a certain subject that -- ' ' Ay , ay , my lad , ' returned the <NAME> .
<NAME> in the parlour .
On the first crash of the eminent Mr Merdle ' s decease , many important persons had been unable to determine whether they should cut <NAME> , or comfort her .
<NAME> , who is desirous to aid any work that is considered likely to be a good work and who is much sought after by philanthropists , has , I believe , a very high opinion of Mrs .
O Heaven forgive you , father , stop ! " And he stopped , and the dog was bloody , and father lay down crying on the floor with the dog in his arms , and the dog licked his face. ' <NAME> saw that she was sobbing ; and going to her , kissed her , took her hand , and sat down beside her .
His insolence of self-importance dilated as he saw this alteration in her .
It is impossible to describe how <NAME> gets her out , but he accomplishes that feat in a manner so peculiar to himself , enfolding and pervading her like a cloud , and hovering away with her as if he were a homely Jupiter and she the object of his affections .
I was three-and-twenty years of age .
You are in mourning for some near relation ? ' ' For my father , ' answered <NAME> .
He even suspected the mystery of the gloved hand , and held it all the longer in his own for that suspicion .
Did you ever buy anything of him ? ' With piercing eagerness .
That one seemed inclined to turn back , but the other , in which <NAME> recognised enough that was like herself to strike her with an unusual feeling , not quite free from fear , came on ; and then they came on together .
<NAME> then sees the <NAME> , and looks attentively at him , and goes his way .
On approaching nearer , <NAME> discerned that the refection had the appearance of a small cottage-loaf and a pennyworth of milk .
The doctor and the debtor ran down-stairs , leaving the turnkey to return to the lock , and made for the debtor ' s room .
At all events , he hoped so , and therefore tried to believe it .
The mandate was obeyed ; and the indignant <NAME> was conveyed out , with the book in one hand , and the bamboo cane in the other : in a perfect phrenzy of rage and defiance .
Its expression had lost nothing of its beauty ; but it was changed ; and there was an anxious haggard look about the gentle face , which it had never worn before .
That boy , my good sir , would break his neck with pleasure , and deprive his parents of their chief comfort -- and between ourselves , when you come to see him at hare and hounds , taking the fence and ditch by the finger-post , and sliding down the face of the little quarry , you ' ll never forget it .
Supposing his head had been held down under water for a while .
Who would be enchanted to serve you ; who would be so true , so zealous , and so faithful every day !
but all the rejection of sin , and all the war against it , in which I had been bred ? ' She laid her wrathful hand upon the watch on the table .
Shall we drink a toast , <NAME> ? ' ' Ah ! ' said <NAME> , eyeing his little glass impatiently .
He noticed that his companion stood at the window with the air of an affable and accessible Sovereign , and that , when any of his people in the yard below looked up , his recognition of their salutes just stopped short of a blessing .
He jumped up , and the leaden eyes which twinkled behind his mountainous cheeks leered horribly upon the food as he unpacked it from the basket .
Upon that , Mr <NAME> fell to work ; and <NAME> , retaining no property to himself but his clothes and books , and a little loose money , placed his small private banker ' s-account with the papers of the business .
He softly pushed the book over to me , as <NAME> stood smoking with his eyes on the fire , and I read in it : -- " <NAME> 's name was <NAME> .
It was another world , where sin and sorrow never came ; a tranquil place of rest , where nothing evil entered .
' It was at <NAME> ' s , my son tells me , that you first became acquainted , ' said Mrs. <NAME> , as she and I were talking at one table , while they played backgammon at another .
The tired company had broken up , and all the rest were gone to bed except the young lady ' s father , who dozed in his chair by the fire .
I wish by this account of them , imperfect in its execution , but in its just intention , honest , I could hope to convey to my readers one-hundredth part of the gratification , the sights I have described , afforded me .
It was generally considered , indeed , that she had been due some time , and ought to have fallen long ago ; but she had kept her life , and her situation , with an ill-conditioned tenacity that occasioned much offence and disappointment .
' I refer you to my attorney , <NAME> ; <NAME> , of <NAME> ' s <NAME> , ' said he .
' Is it a kind of a spluttering somewhere ? ' said the dressmaker , with an inquiring look .
He took it in his , holding me lightly with his arm , and looking down into my face with the same genuine freshness and faithfulness of manner -- the old protecting manner which had made that house my home in a moment -- said , " You have wrought changes in me , little woman , since the winter day in the stage-coach .
" You little coarse monster , what do you think of me now ? " " I shall not tell you. " " Because you are going to tell upstairs .
After that , love , bliss and rapture ; rapture , love and bliss .
Yes. ' ' Further , I am a gentleman of the softest and sweetest disposition , but who , if trifled with , becomes enraged .
' What of her ? ' ' Why , sir , ' returned <NAME> , ' between <NAME> and the humble individual who has now the honor to address you , warm and tender sentiments have been engendered , sentiments of the most honourable and inspiring kind .
But I should take it as a great favour if you would not press it without urgent occasion. ' Now , it could not be said that there <NAME> urgent occasion , for <NAME> retained no other affairs in his hands than such as still lingered and languished about the undiscovered criminal , and such as arose out of the purchase of the house .
But I do mind , ' said <NAME> , ' and so will you , <NAME> , when I enlighten you .
If you will let me go with you , <NAME> , I will go to the world ' s end without fear .
Now , you see , that makes his good lady very uneasy in her mind , and me too , for whereas I 'm a harum-scarum sort of a good-for-nought that more kicks than halfpence come natural to , why he 's a steady family man , do n't you see ?
' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , very seriously .
The agony on the shore increased .
I know it was a good squeeze , because , being very plump , whenever she made any little exertion after she was dressed , some of the buttons on the back of her gown flew off .
' I -- ha -- thought it was <NAME> ! ' said Mr Dorrit .
There was an empty niche from which some old statue had fallen or been carried away hundreds of years ago , and she was thinking what strange people it must have looked down upon when it stood there , and how many hard struggles might have taken place , and how many murders might have been done , upon that silent spot , when there suddenly emerged from the black shade of the arch , a man .
" No , " said he , with a glance of surprise : " who else should there be ?
And so you chance to find , you know , " <NAME> went on , stooping over him with an air of cheerful raillery which <NAME> by no means reciprocated , " and so you chance to find , you know , a paper with the signature of <NAME> to it .
<NAME> then that I had , and that I have -- do you understand me ?
No one was stirring in the house .
One is called the <NAME> school , and is an asylum for neglected and indigent boys who have committed no crime , but who in the ordinary course of things would very soon be purged of that distinction if they were not taken from the hungry streets and sent here .
Well ! ' Hearing this mention of their old friend ' s name , the four Miss <NAME> gathered round <NAME> , open eyed and mouthed , to hear more .
Equally hard up for a remark. ' ' Somebody said something , ' returned <NAME> .
' But let me take you to your own rest , for you must need it. ' With that <NAME> helped her to get her hat on again , and hung upon his arm the very little bag that was of no earthly use , and led her by the hand ( with a certain stately awkwardness , as if he were going to walk a minuet ) across <NAME> , and into <NAME> ' s <NAME> .
' Not here. ' ' But we have so little time to make so much of , and I have come so far , and am altogether so devoted , and distracted .
' Thank you , my dear , ' he said , as if she had spoken ; ' I am all right , my dear .
I was still in this state of expectation , and had been , for nearly a week ; when I left the <NAME> ' s one snowy night , to walk home .
You know that you made my life unhappy by your pursuit of me .
We must make proper inquiries into his statements , in justice to him as well as to ourselves , and if they are confirmed -- as I feel assured they will be -- we must assist him , we must assist him , brother Ned. ' ' It is enough , my dear brother , that you say we should , ' returned the other .
A handsome mince-pie had been made yesterday morning ( which accounted for the mincemeat not being missed ) , and the pudding was already on the boil .
On the day of judgment .
I wish he ' d make a bonfire of his violoncello , and burn his music-books in it. ' ' You respect nobody , <NAME> , I think , ' said Mr Dombey .
Mr Plornish , who had a small share in a small builder ' s business in the neighbourhood , said , trowel in hand , on the tops of scaffolds and on the tiles of houses , that people did tell him as Mr <NAME> was _the_ one , mind you , to put us all to rights in respects of that which all on us looked to , and to bring us all safe home as much as we needed , mind you , fur toe be brought .
And God knows I do ! " echoed Biddy .
' My brother. ' <NAME> resumed his former position ; and <NAME> , accompanied by a surgeon , entered the room .
He was taken to <NAME> , as well as I remember , on the completion of his fifteenth journey ; when four-and-sixpence , and a second-hand fife which he couldn ' t play , were found upon his person .
' Good day , sir , ' said my aunt , ' and good-bye !
' I am not afraid , ' said <NAME> in a low voice , as he relinquished <NAME> 's hand .
And don ' t be thankful to us ( for we never thought of it ) , but to Mr Rokesmith. ' The letter was written , and read to her , and given to her .
On similar grounds he never beheld an inmate at any one of its windows but he touched his hat .
" I hope I may turn out so , " said I , " but I am much afraid of it , guardian . "
I have been called in , ' he replied .
' What will you take , sir ?
Never let us be parted any more ! ' His head , now grey , was encircled by her arm ; and he groaned to think that never , never , had it rested so before .
When they reached the gate of the <NAME> , the cavalcade , taking the time from the plaintiff , gave three tremendous cheers for the defendant , and , after having shaken hands all round , left him .
There is no doubt that much of the intellectual refinement and superiority of <NAME> , is referable to the quiet influence of the <NAME> of <NAME> , which is within three or four miles of the city .
For the question at issue is only a question of costs , a mere bud on the forest tree of the parent suit , and really will come to a settlement one of these days .
' Will you leave a message for him ? ' ' When do you think he ' ll be back ? ' inquired the stranger .
It was dark in the morning , when I got upon the coach at the inn door .
In the interval , <NAME> , in a fantastic way , had put some of the most beautiful jewels from her dressing-table into <NAME> 's hair , and about her bosom and arms ; and I saw even my guardian look at her from under his thick eyebrows , and raise them a little , when her loveliness was before him , with those rich flushes of glitter and color in it .
' <NAME> , ' he said , detaining it in his .
No , sir , ' said Mr Venus .
He started on the entrance of the stranger , and rose feebly to his feet .
She had never been so handsome , in his eyes .
We have been counting on your return these three or four days past .
' And what was it like ? ' inquires Veneering .
A hundred times in every week , some new most paltry exhibition of that narrow-minded and injurious <NAME> , which is the <NAME> of <NAME> , sickening and blighting everything of wholesome life within its reach , was forced upon my notice ; but I never turned my back upon it with feelings of such deep disgust and measureless contempt , as when I crossed the threshold of this madhouse .
When any sharp sense of its being empty smote upon her , she could kneel beside it , and pray GOD -- it was the pouring out of her full heart -- to let one angel love her and remember her .
Yet every dim little star revolving about her , from her maid to the manager of the <NAME> , knows her weaknesses , prejudices , follies , haughtinesses , and caprices and lives upon as accurate a calculation and as nice a measure of her moral nature as her dressmaker takes of her physical proportions .
" I know that what is said between you and me goes no further. " I asked him if he had ever seen <NAME> 's adopted daughter , Mrs. <NAME> .
T ' other day when I touched his coat in the street , he looked round as if I was a toad .
' Yes , ' said <NAME> , ' to <NAME> .
A final word before I go .
I hope there may turn out to be no why not .
As it was , I thought as little of it as I might .
Could I raise a crowd of old company about you to-morrow morning , that would follow you to ruin like copies of your own shadow , and do you turn on me with your bold looks !
" I have come to bring you home , dear brother ! "
<NAME> , will your ladyship allow me to ask you whether you have had any strange visitors this morning ?
The <NAME> scheme or Course established by <NAME> 's great-aunt may be resolved into the following synopsis .
One day she failed to come , for the first time .
Many of the circumstances whose strong influence has been at work for years in our manufacturing towns have not arisen here ; and there is no manufacturing population in <NAME> , so to speak : for these girls ( often the daughters of small farmers ) come from other States , remain a few years in the mills , and then go home for good .
' A little humouring of <NAME> ' s points !
' It was then , when the love of two dead people who had been nearest and dearest to his heart , was all transferred to this slight creature ; when her face , constantly before him , reminded him , from hour to hour , of the too early change he had seen in such another -- of all the sufferings he had watched and known , and all his child had undergone ; when the young man ' s profligate and hardened course drained him of money as his father ' s had , and even sometimes occasioned them temporary privation and distress ; it was then that there began to beset him , and to be ever in his mind , a gloomy dread of poverty and want .
" But she had a large heart ! "
Sometimes the broken reply was , " Wait !
I am only your friend and distant kinsman .
The green damp hung upon the low walls ; the tracks of the snail and slug glistened in the light of the candle ; but all was still as death .
' I wouldn ' t have sat up all night alone with <NAME> ! ' said <NAME> , ' not if you ' d have put <NAME> into business next morning for himself .
<NAME> <NAME> stood higher than ever ; for he had shown his power ; hinted at his property and testamentary intentions ; gained great credit for disinterestedness and virtue ; and , in addition to all , was finally accommodated with a much larger tumbler of punch than that which <NAME> had so feloniously made off with .
But unwilling to hazard the responsibility , she let me in , and presently brought the sharp message that I was to " come up. " Everything was unchanged , and <NAME> was alone .
His face , remarkable for a brown solidity , brightened as he shook hands with <NAME> and nephew ; but he seemed to be of a laconic disposition , and merely said : ' How goes it ? ' ' All well , ' said Mr Gills , pushing the bottle towards him .
' It includes it : yes , ' said Mr Dombey .
We went our way too , which was to <NAME> 's <NAME> , as quickly as possible .
You know it is professionally arranged beforehand in all cases that are tried what facts the witnesses are to prove .
I did not come back , and they have passed unspoiled into my place .
At the same time far be it from me to -- hum -- to put upon the fine feelings by which my partial friends are actuated , the slight of scrupling to admit that those offerings are -- hum -- highly acceptable .
It was the very next night .
Even when she was quite a child , she was the Agnes whom we know , ' said I .
' It ' s no reason , <NAME> , ' said the old woman , bending over him to whisper , ' that because I am afeared of my life of ' em , you should be .
The young lady , my good sir , " said <NAME> , mildly tapping the Stryver arm , " the young lady .
' I shouldn ' t have thought it. ' Not in the least looking at them , but looking at <NAME> .
From time to time , one man would whisper to his neighbour , or a little group would whisper together , and then the whisperers would nod fiercely to each other , or give their heads a relentless shake , as if they were bent upon doing something very desperate , and were determined not to be put off , whatever happened .
Now , <NAME> is , in a manner , part and parcel of the place , and besides , is supposed to have made Mrs. Rouncewell 's will .
Do not give way so bitterly , dear friend , don ' t .
You have heard something , I des-say , of a change in my expectations , <NAME> , -- I should say , <NAME> ? ' As he sat on my sofa , with his long knees drawn up under his coffee-cup , his hat and gloves upon the ground close to him , his spoon going softly round and round , his shadowless red eyes , which looked as if they had scorched their lashes off , turned towards me without looking at me , the disagreeable dints I have formerly described in his nostrils coming and going with his breath , and a snaky undulation pervading his frame from his chin to his boots , I decided in my own mind that I disliked him intensely .
' " Flasher -- ten guineas to five , <NAME> kills himself. " Within what time shall we say ? ' ' A fortnight ? ' suggested <NAME> , <NAME> .
' Who is a very old friend of my poor <NAME> ' s , and a most excellent man , <NAME> , ' pursued <NAME> , raising his eyes with a look of entreaty in the <NAME> ' s behalf , ' was so good as to offer to come with me , which I could hardly refuse. ' ' No , no , no ; ' observed the Captain complacently .
' He ' d write letters by the ream , if it was a capital offence ! ' <NAME> , without hearing her , went on .
So quiet , that when her father rose to take his leave , she looked round with a start , as if she had forgotten his being there .
Is that <NAME> knowledge of life ?
I may sell <NAME> , though I should be sorry to see the neighbourhood deprived of ' em too .
No sooner was the acquittal pronounced , than tears were shed as freely as blood at another time , and such fraternal embraces were bestowed upon the prisoner by as many of both sexes as could rush at him , that after his long and unwholesome confinement he was in danger of fainting from exhaustion ; none the less because he knew very well , that the very same people , carried by another current , would have rushed at him with the very same intensity , to rend him to pieces and strew him over the streets .
A moment afterwards , he was as fawning and as humble as ever .
The general feeling seems to be that it 's a blessing <NAME> war n't made away with first , mingled with a little natural disappointment that he was not .
How then , my queen ? ' ' On that night , when , emboldened by the scene you had assisted at , you dared come to my room and speak to me , ' she said , ' what passed ? ' He shrugged his shoulders , and laughed ' What passed ? ' she said .
' <NAME> ' t call me by that name !
If I was to be informed , I should despair of understanding , and I 'd rather not be told . "
Thus <NAME> and I found them at nightfall , assembled on the wooden steps , at that time known as <NAME> , watching the departure of a boat with some of their property on board .
' Yes , ' replied a couple of shrill voices .
While his eyes were on the paper , he felt that the eyes of Mr Flintwinch and of Mrs Clennam were on him .
There was a stewardess , too , actively engaged in producing clean sheets and table-cloths from the very entrails of the sofas , and from unexpected lockers , of such artful mechanism , that it made one ' s head ache to see them opened one after another , and rendered it quite a distracting circumstance to follow her proceedings , and to find that every nook and corner and individual piece of furniture was something else besides what it pretended to be , and was a mere trap and deception and place of secret stowage , whose ostensible purpose was its least useful one .
With the <NAME> crypt he is better acquainted than any living authority ; it may even be than any dead one .

What a companion you were ! ' ' Companion ?
' If the dog ' s teeth have entered the leg , <NAME> -- ' began <NAME> , with a display of his own .
When the time drew near for retiring , <NAME> took a glass of water .
What a novel illustration of the tender laws of <NAME> !
It was succeeded by a moment ' s pause .
So they looked , so would he ; so she , his weeping child , who should say when !
The gentleman in the white waistcoat appeared very much amused by this explanation ; but his mirth was speedily checked by a look from <NAME> .
No portrait that I have ever seen of anyone has been half so replete with those qualities .
What I happened to find there , about their secret way of coming and going , without you -- which was strange -- led to my suspecting something wrong .
' I have heard it remarked that she was a very fine woman , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , in a sympathising manner .
<NAME> looked as if he could have willingly excused himself from taking home a visitor at that unseasonable hour ; and , indeed , muttered something about having no fire ; but his companion repeating his request in a peremptory manner , he unlocked the door , and requested him to close it softly , while he got a light .
And how merry we all were , and how loyal to the <NAME> , and how full of mutual congratulations , and how venturesome in predicting the exact hour at which we should arrive at <NAME> , may be easily imagined and readily understood .
Anybody who had seen him projecting himself into <NAME> while he was yet on <NAME> 's side of <NAME> , bursting in his full-blown way along the pavement , to the jostlement of all weaker people , might have seen how safe and strong he was .
' What I have come down to be , since I first saw you in this house !
The cries of the two elder <NAME> , and the wailing of young <NAME> , who may be said to have passed a piebald childhood , forasmuch as he was black in the face during one half of that fairy period of existence , combined to make this visitation the more awful .
He was thought to have gone , but he was hiding .
Going along the passage , with the mingled consciousness and helplessness of a dream , he heard Mr <NAME> ' s door shut again , as Mr <NAME> came out : and immediately afterwards that gentleman called to him .
Pleasant sheds tears deserving her own name , and her sweet delusion is at its height .
' The <NAME> ' s there , and you ' ll have to come back , you know. ' Without taking the least notice , <NAME> leaned his body against a post , in a resting attitude , and there rested with his eyes cast down .
exclaimed <NAME> , turning a look of excessive surprise on his companion .
I shouldn ' t like to have it known that she was so much attached to me .
' Why , my dear Sir , our friend ' s in an unpleasant position -- very much so .
" He is very weak , " said the trooper in a low voice .
It 's my old girl that advises .
<NAME> shillings ! ' After carefully reading the dingy scrap of paper handed to him , and as carefully tucking it into his waistcoat pocket , <NAME> tells out the money ; beginning incautiously by telling the first shilling into Mr Dolls ' s hand , which instantly jerks it out of window ; and ending by telling the fifteen shillings on the seat .
Taking a pace or two over the stone floor , he came back to the table and finished what he had to say .
' You are fairly in for it , ' said the jolly host .
Sincerely , honestly , indeed , <NAME> , I never thought so , before .
Might I ask you to take care of her until she is in the coach ? ' ' Miss Dombey , ' returned Mr Toots , ' you really do me an honour and a kindness .
cries Mrs. Bagnet , looking at him curiously .
" <NAME> , ass ! " and snap at me like a dragon. ' This was true enough ; though the question which <NAME> anticipated , was , in fact , upon <NAME> ' s lips at the moment .
<NAME> and excitement extend further yet , and take a wider range .
The purpose he had brought home to his native country , and had ever since kept in view , was , with her greatest determination , defeated by his mother herself , at the time of all others when he feared that it pressed most .
It certainly did seem that the whelp yielded to this influence .
I have proved myself , and I know better .
And only because I am anxious for the family credit. ' ' To the winds with the family credit ! ' cried the old man , with great scorn and indignation .
' I could wish , ' said Mr Toots , ' to take this opportunity , <NAME> , if I might , of entering into a word of explanation .
Now , do be more practical. ' She had been practical enough with him , in suffering and striving for him ; but she only laid her hand upon his shoulder -- not reproachfully -- and tapped it twice or thrice .
I don ' t wish to alarm Mrs. <NAME> ; but I hope they haven ' t come from any jail or hospital , and brought away a fever or some unpleasantness of that sort , which might be catching for the children. ' Mrs. <NAME> was so overpowered by this supposition , that it needed all the tender attentions of <NAME> , of the <NAME> , <NAME> , to restore her to anything like a state of calmness ; not to mention the assiduity of <NAME> , who held a fat smelling-bottle to his lady ' s nose , until it became matter of some doubt whether the tears which coursed down her face were the result of feelings or <NAME> VOLATILE .
I can desire no more .
<NAME> , perhaps , as he rode , that even this trivial sketch had been made and delivered to its owner , as if it had been bargained for and bought .
<NAME> boy , I done it ! " I tried to collect my thoughts , but I was stunned .
But , whether she was afraid of singing before people , or was out of voice that evening , it was certain that she couldn ' t sing at all .
Mr <NAME> pulled off his coat , and folded it up with great elaboration , staring at <NAME> all the time ; then put on a blue jacket with a double row of gilt buttons , which he had originally ordered for aquatic expeditions , but had brought with him that morning for office purposes ; and , still keeping his eye upon her , suffered himself to drop down silently upon Mr <NAME> ' s stool .
The imprisoned air , the imprisoned light , the imprisoned damps , the imprisoned men , were all deteriorated by confinement .
you alone are to blame , are you , sir ? ' said <NAME> ; ' I -- I -- see through this , sir .
I had not the least belief , in the outset of this story , that the unknown was anything but a delusion of <NAME> ' s , and one of the line of that ill-fated Prince who occasioned him so much difficulty ; but after some reflection I began to entertain the question whether an attempt , or threat of an attempt , might have been twice made to take poor <NAME> himself from under my aunt ' s protection , and whether my aunt , the strength of whose kind feeling towards him I knew from herself , might have been induced to pay a price for his peace and quiet .
' Well , sir , ' said <NAME> , removing his pipe , that he might rub his chin : ' I tell you truly , I shall be glad when her marriage has taken place. ' ' Why so ? ' I inquired .
' I have no patience ' ( which indeed was the truth ) .
' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
Now , does he do too much ? " " I think not .
He is a kind of man -- by <NAME> ! -- that has caused me more restlessness , and more uneasiness , and more dissatisfaction with myself than all other men put together .
I ses 'yes ' I ses .
How else COULD he be disappointed ?
" I am not sure , my dear girl , but that it may be wise and specious to preserve that outward indifference .
I began to be really afraid of him now and looked at him with the greatest astonishment .
But in the general tumbling up of the family , his tumbling out in life somewhere , was a thing to transact itself somehow .
Give my love to your aunt , <NAME> dear , and implore her not to curse the viper that has crossed your path and blighted your existence .
We are liable to be tumbled out neck and crop at a moment 's notice .
The fulfilment of the second has not yet arrived .
Being by this time a perfect <NAME> and a complete success , she made a dash at the door which I had fortunately locked .
<NAME> is a Copious Language , and Trying to <NAME> .
The search continued for five days .
I would tell him before breakfast .
' I regarded myself as a refuge , for her , from the dangers and vicissitudes of life .
But to no purpose ; for still no trace of <NAME> revisited the light of the sun .
The late <NAME> having been beforehand with him in intelligence of his return , and being so determined to bring him to book , I do not think he could have been saved .
' I shall know , ' replied the bold mild man , ' when I have heard your Ludship tell it. ' With that , he leaned back in his chair and smiled at the ceiling , as knowing it by heart , and being already tickled .
' Why will it vex itself , and twist its little face into bewitching nutcrackers ? ' said <NAME> , putting his left arm round the waist of his life and soul , and drawing her towards him with his right .
The bat skimmed in fantastic flights through the heavy air , and the ground was alive with crawling things , whose instinct brought them forth to swell and fatten in the rain .
As his look wandered over the papers again and he passed his two hands over his head , I noticed how sunken and how large his eyes appeared , how dry his lips were , and how his finger-nails were all bitten away .
Now it was <NAME> , now one of my old Reading friends from whom I could not believe I had so recently parted .
I make an agreement with my son <NAME> to-day that on this day twelvemonth he shall marry as pretty and as good a girl as you have seen in all your travels .
To be sure , I do n't know why I should n't be wished a hundred mile away , for I have not much to do with all this ! "
I bought it of an individual that he gave it to , and that lived here after him .
' O me , O me , my lungs is weak , my lungs is bad !
For how does it stand ?
A pleasant journey to you .
' I don ' t know how he came or why , my dear , ' rejoined <NAME> , dismounting with her son ' s assistance , ' but he has been a terrifying of me out of my seven senses all this blessed day. ' ' He has ? ' cried <NAME> .
Is that so ? ' ' Yes , ma ' am ; indeed it is .
The atrocity in its full extent no longer exists , but there is enough of it left to give rise to occurrences that make the heart bleed .
' Who have you got in this here conweyance ? ' ' <NAME> back , ' said <NAME> , whose dignity , like the dignity of a great many other men , had been wondrously augmented by a little popularity .
It must not be supposed ( or it would be a gross injustice to Mr Quilp ) that he was tortured by any disinterested anxiety on behalf of either .
He had raised his fork to his lips , and was on the very point of opening his mouth for the reception of a piece of beef , when the hum of many voices suddenly arose in the kitchen .
I could not afford to lose him , but you will bring him safe back. ' ' Well !
There was nothing of high mark in this .
That , presented by his conductors to this Tribunal , he had announced himself by name and profession as having been for eighteen years a secret and unaccused prisoner in the <NAME> ; that , one of the body so sitting in judgment had risen and identified him , and that this man was <NAME> .
Let us walk. ' ' But you will be so tired , my love. ' ' Oh no !
To do <NAME> justice , he seldom practised this sort of dissimulation ; but he understood those who did , and therefore suffered <NAME> to say , again and again , with great vehemence , that they were jointly doing a very cruel thing , before he again offered to interpose a word .
Probably you came over with the delayed mail that brings the advice. ' ' That I came over with the delayed mail , sir , ' returned Mr Blandois , passing his white hand down his high-hooked nose , ' I know to the cost of my head and stomach : the detestable and intolerable weather having racked them both .
But you had better ask <NAME> if you want to know. ' ' I wonder he doesn ' t call , ' said <NAME> after thinking a moment .
I smoke on srub and water , myself , ' said <NAME> , taking up his glass , ' because it ' s considered softening to the passages , by which this troublesome breath of mine gets into action .
He thought of the times he had seen the brother and sister together in deep converse over one of his own old college books ; now , in the rimy mornings , when he made those sharpening pilgrimages to <NAME> ; now , in the sombre evenings , when he faced the wind at sunset , having climbed his favourite outlook , a beetling fragment of monastery ruin ; and the two studious figures passed below him along the margin of the river , in which the town fires and lights already shone , making the landscape bleaker .
She did not want to speak to her of this -- she could not , remembering to whom she was opposed -- but she wished , in one silent and affectionate embrace , to assure her that she felt it all , and thanked her .
Now , whether the shake had jumbled the fat boy ' s faculties together , instead of arranging them in proper order , or had roused such a quantity of new ideas within him as to render him oblivious of ordinary forms and ceremonies , or ( which is also possible ) had proved unsuccessful in preventing his falling asleep as he ascended the stairs , it is an undoubted fact that he walked into the sitting-room without previously knocking at the door ; and so beheld a gentleman with his arms clasping his young mistress ' s waist , sitting very lovingly by her side on a sofa , while <NAME> and her pretty handmaid feigned to be absorbed in looking out of a window at the other end of the room .
" My amiable child , " murmured <NAME> , adjusting his cravat .
' Probably it will not , ' says <NAME> , with a certain hardened manner upon her , that makes <NAME> shrink , ' have surprised you so much as some others , after what passed between us at the house which is now turned out at windows .
' Aha ! ' said the fat boy .
So he descended the stair again , and , crossing the <NAME> , paused at the great western folding-door of the <NAME> , which stood open on the fine and bright , though short-lived , afternoon , for the airing of the place .
' ' It ' im agin ! ' cried the boy , as the poor creature leaped ; ' and made a dint in his wool. ' ' Let him be ! ' said <NAME> .
Now send me out feet foremost ! ' "
' Do you think of soon returning to the old country ? ' says I .
' If I was so inclined , the loneliness of this situation -- you ' ll excuse my speaking so free -- would put it out of my power , in four and twenty hours ; but I ain ' t at all .
' You ' re wanted inside here. ' ' Has Mr Abel forgotten anything , I wonder ? ' said <NAME> as he dismounted .
' What is the matter ? ' exclaimed <NAME> , running to support her .
<NAME> and <NAME> went out in the meantime on the beach with <NAME> -- who was constantly in tears -- and at about noon Mrs <NAME> presided over some Early Readings .
' <NAME> offers me this place , which he says he can insure me , ' resumed <NAME> after a thoughtful silence , and telling off the circumstances of his position , one by one , upon his fingers ; ' Fred , who , I could have taken my affidavit , would not have heard of such a thing , backs <NAME> to my astonishment , and urges me to take it also -- staggerer , number one !
It was not with me then , as it was in later life , when I fell into the society of the <NAME> , and compared them with <NAME> and <NAME> , rather to the disadvantage of both gentlemen .
The bookcase , glazed and locked , repudiated all familiarities .
' <NAME> , young woman ; you know who this is ? ' ' It ' s Mrs. <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
Of which , to do her justice , she was wholly innocent , in thought , word , or deed .
The funeral had evidently taken place that day , for attached to his hat , which he still retained on his head , was a hatband measuring about a yard and a half in length , which hung over the top rail of the chair and streamed negligently down .
' Why , you know , sir , ' returned <NAME> , venturing to be more familiar : ' -- the fact is , sir , that any allusion to these little combinings together , of friends , for objects in themselves extremely laudable , but which the law terms conspiracies , are -- you take me , sir ? -- best kept snug and among friends , you know. ' ' Eh ! ' said <NAME> , looking up with a perfectly vacant countenance .
I took advantage of the moment -- I had sought one from the first -- to leave the room , after beseeching <NAME> 's attention to her , with a movement of my hand .
' <NAME> , Louisa. ' ' You are quite another father to <NAME> , sir. ' Mrs. <NAME> took a little more tea ; and , as she bent her again contracted eyebrows over her steaming cup , rather looked as if her classical countenance were invoking the infernal gods .
The extreme disquietude of the old housekeeper 's manner in saying this , her broken words , and her wringing of her hands make a powerful impression on Mrs. Bagnet and would astonish her but that she refers them all to her sorrow for her son 's condition .
In the difficulty of hearing anything but wind and waves , and in the crowd , and the unspeakable confusion , and my first breathless efforts to stand against the weather , I was so confused that I looked out to sea for the wreck , and saw nothing but the foaming heads of the great waves .
" Look here , " says <NAME> , recoiling .
And this is his wife , Mrs .
You do n't know how well ! "
And when I say so , you may trust to my being right , sir , for I have made it my business to study my high connexion and to be able to wind it up like a clock , sir . "
I have made some advances out of pocket to accommodate these unpleasantnesses , but I necessarily look to being repaid , for I do not pretend to be a man of capital , and I have a father to support in the <NAME> of <NAME> , besides striving to realize some little independence for three dear girls at home .
At the moment of my arrival , he had just finished putting somebody 's hat into black long-clothes , like an <NAME> baby ; so he held out his hand for mine .
The Jew was no sooner alone , than his countenance resumed its former expression of anxiety and thought .
'The reason of all this , ' replied <NAME> .
" It 's just as likely as not , " said <NAME> , " one of these days ; though there 's plenty of time for that , my dear .
If they wos a pair o ' patent double million magnifyin ' gas microscopes of hextra power , p ' raps I might be able to see through a flight o ' stairs and a deal door ; but bein ' only eyes , you see , my wision ' s limited. ' At this answer , which was delivered without the slightest appearance of irritation , and with the most complete simplicity and equanimity of manner , the spectators tittered , the little judge smiled , and <NAME> looked particularly foolish .
He could turn cramp-bones into chessmen ; fashion Roman chariots from old court cards ; make spoked wheels out of cotton reels , and bird-cages of old wire .
Her mother ' s picture was gone with the rest of the moveables , and on the mark where it had been , was scrawled in chalk , ' this room in panel .
The unhappy collector looked piteously at his wife , as if to see whether there was any one trait of <NAME> left in Mrs. Lillyvick , and finding too surely that there was not , begged pardon of all the company with great humility , and sat down such a crest-fallen , dispirited , disenchanted man , that despite all his selfishness and dotage , he was quite an object of compassion .
' From <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> .
The glazed hat made quite a show in the sun with its glistening , and the <NAME> continued to wave it until he could be seen no longer .
You have heard the dreadful nonsense he has been guilty of this night , and the manner in which he has gone on with that poor unfortunate little old maid .
' I remember well. ' ' Then I tell you what , ' says the <NAME> , leaning back in his chair , and composing his chest for a prodigious roar .
' <NAME> thee down , master , in the elbow chair , ' said the old man , knocking his stick upon the brick floor , and trying to do so sharply .
If one forlorn wanderer then pacing the dark streets , could have heard her innocent disclosure , and could have seen the drops of pity kissed away by her husband from the soft blue eyes so loving of that husband , he might have cried to the night -- and the words would not have parted from his lips for the first time -- " God bless her for her sweet compassion ! " <NAME> .
I recommend you to take yourself off , and be talked to presently , you fool !
They ran to the window , downstairs , and into the street .
When the haughty beauty had concluded , she arose , and receiving Mr <NAME> ' s thanks and compliments in exactly the same manner as before , went with scarcely any pause to the piano , and began there .
She was a woman of about forty , I supposed , -- but I may have thought her younger than she was .
A man yet dark and muddy , in long swollen sodden boots and a hat like them , was called out of a boat and whispered with <NAME> , who went away with him down some slippery steps -- as if to look at something secret that he had to show .
Do nothing for me ; that ' s all .
She hired a crossing-sweeping boy to show it her .
' I ' m sure I feel it myself , in my humble way , ' Mr Perch went on to say , with a shake of his head , ' in a manner I couldn ' t have believed if I hadn ' t been called upon to undergo .
He was a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before .
Really I didn ' t know that I had .
' Very lucky I had the presence of mind to avoid them , ' thought <NAME> with a smile , and walking on tiptoe to another door near the bedside ; ' this opens into the same passage , and I can walk quietly and comfortably away. ' There was only one obstacle to his walking quietly and comfortably away , which was that the door was locked and the key gone .
Your letter is like you , and what could I say of it that would be higher praise than that ?
My Lady trifles with the screen and makes them glitter more , again with that expression which in other times might have been so dangerous to the young man of the name of <NAME> .
He had repeatedly said he would have <NAME> ' s life .
It can ' t be done. ' The drivers on these roads , who certainly get over the ground in a manner which is quite miraculous , so twist and turn the team about in forcing a passage , corkscrew fashion , through the bogs and swamps , that it was quite a common circumstance on looking out of the window , to see the coachman with the ends of a pair of reins in his hands , apparently driving nothing , or playing at horses , and the leaders staring at one unexpectedly from the back of the coach , as if they had some idea of getting up behind .
<NAME> had made good speed while <NAME> was absent , and with his help everything was soon ready for their departure .
But his desire was to the utmost to satisfy <NAME> ( whatever that was ) , and take up all its drafts upon him for tribute .
For a whole week after the happy arrival of <NAME> from <NAME> , <NAME> and <NAME> were from home all day long , only returning just in time for dinner , and then wearing an air of mystery and importance quite foreign to their natures .
' You have done me an unmerited service .
It is , perhaps , hardly in the nature of woman to receive such attentions as the Major once lavished upon myself without betraying some sense of obligation .
And the parlour couldn ' t bear straighter either .
' We ' d have had a young gentleman to meet you , if we had known you were coming , ' retorted <NAME> , nothing abashed .
But we mustn ' t talk about that over here. ' ' Why not ? ' ' Oh , egad ! ' said Mr Meagles , shaking his head very seriously , ' he must hide all those things under lock and key when he comes over here .
The town , which was sluggish and uninteresting enough , was something like the back of an <NAME> watering-place , out of the season .
He trusted he had not lowered himself in the good opinion of his friends by this frank confession of his faults ; and he hoped the promptness with which he had resented the last unmanly outrage on his feelings , to which he had referred , would reinstate him in their good opinion , if he had .
The door opening , without any note of preparation , and apparently of itself , the hard glazed hat in question skimmed into the room like a bird , and alighted heavily at the <NAME> ' s feet .
The child looked around her , with that solemn feeling with which we contemplate the work of ages that have become but drops of water in the great ocean of eternity .
They were come into the <NAME> , where the prison stood , when a voice cried , ' Little mother , little mother ! ' Little Dorrit stopping and looking back , an excited figure of a strange kind bounced against them ( still crying ' little mother ' ) , fell down , and scattered the contents of a large basket , filled with potatoes , in the mud .
She gives me nothing but reproaches , my <NAME> , for all I have done for her .
Not that its arrival brought me either ; for , then I was worse than ever , and began haunting the coach-office in <NAME> , <NAME> , before the coach had left the <NAME> in our town .
On one of these occasions , when they had both been perfectly quiet for a long time , and Mr Dombey only knew that the child was awake by occasionally glancing at his eye , where the bright fire was sparkling like a jewel , little <NAME> broke silence thus : ' Papa !
That ' s what a man of his character ought to have done , it would be argueyfied , ' said the Deputy Lock , cunningly harping on the strong string of her terror ; ' he ought to have handed her over safe to the <NAME> .
I may premise that the poor boy ' s name is <NAME> ; that he is thirteen years of age ; and that he was in full possession of all his faculties , until three years and four months old .
He was always foremost among them .
I have seen it displayed with such success , that I have encountered some fine ladies and gentlemen who might as well have been born caterpillars .
" What else can be the consequence , " said <NAME> , in explanation , " if he will cut the cheese ?
' I don ' t mean to preach ; but I hope , ' says the doctor , gravely shaking his head , ' that this escape may have a good effect upon you , Riderhood. ' The patient ' s discontented growl of a reply is not intelligible ; his daughter , however , could interpret , if she would , that what he says is , he ' don ' t want no Poll-Parroting ' .
There was now so evident a faltering upon him , expressive of indecision whether or no he should express his having heard himself referred to , that Mr <NAME> spoke to him .
If my time had run out , it would have left me still at the height of my perplexities , I dare say .
Let us pass to the second , ' said <NAME> , smiling her agitation away , making the blaze shine upon her , and putting wine and cake and fruit towards her on the table .
I have no hope of its being untrue , but at least I may verify it. " <NAME> nodded .
When I had got into bed , and lay there footsore , weary , and wretched , I found that I could no more close my own eyes than I could close the eyes of this foolish Argus .
Thus , the little circle remained , on the most amicable and agreeable footing , until the Monday morning , when <NAME> withdrew himself from it for a short time , seriously to reflect upon the state of his affairs , and to determine , if he could , upon some course of life , which would enable him to support those who were so entirely dependent upon his exertions .
Being a great reader of all kinds of literature ( and never at all apologetic for that weakness ) , he sat down comfortably to read .
' This is unfortunate , ' said <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> opened one half of the carriage gate , to admit the sedan , the captured ones , and the specials ; and immediately slammed it in the faces of the mob , who , indignant at being excluded , and anxious to see what followed , relieved their feelings by kicking at the gate and ringing the bell , for an hour or two afterwards .
'Here is another letter , ' said Mrs. Maylie , pausing to reflect ; 'but whether to send it now , or wait until I see how <NAME> goes on , I scarcely know .
As the <NAME> sat , and smoked , and looked at <NAME> , <NAME> knows what impossible pictures , in which she was the principal figure , presented themselves to his mind .
He gives me the cold shoulder on this very matter as if he had had nothing to do with it , instead of being the first to propose it .
' I have put the words close to my heart .
You want that sense altogether ; therefore I am no more annoyed when I think of the expression , than I should be annoyed by a man 's opinion of a picture of mine , who had no eye for pictures : or of a piece of music of mine , who had no ear for music. " Sydney <NAME> drank the punch at a great rate ; drank it by bumpers , looking at his friend .
" My friend the law-stationer 's good lady , over there , " says <NAME> , luring Mrs. Snagsby forward with the finger .
<NAME> as I was , and knew that I was , in reference to any wrong she could possibly suspect me of , I shrunk before her strange eyes , quite unable to endure their hungry lustre .
' If the young man comes to be a teacher here , let him understand , at once , that we don ' t want any foolery about the boys .
An actress ' s Reading of a chambermaid , a dancer ' s Reading of a hornpipe , a singer ' s Reading of a song , a marine painter ' s Reading of the sea , the kettle-drum ' s Reading of an instrumental passage , are phrases ever youthful and delightful . )
<NAME> , in its best sense , was for me no more .
I hope he does , I am sure . "
I WILL see her when I please .
' The very house I live in , ' sighed the poor gentleman , ' may be taken from me tomorrow .
Unfortunately for , the experimental philosophy of the female to whose protecting care <NAME> was delivered over , a similar result usually attended the operation of _her_ system ; for at the very moment when the child had contrived to exist upon the smallest possible portion of the weakest possible food , it did perversely happen in eight and a half cases out of ten , either that it sickened from want and cold , or fell into the fire from neglect , or got half-smothered by accident ; in any one of which cases , the miserable little being was usually summoned into another world , and there gathered to the fathers it had never known in this .
'Oh , you little un-grate-ful , mur-de-rous , hor-rid villain ! '
' I don ' t know what to make of it , ' said <NAME> .
One of two remarkable circumstances is indisputably a fact , with reference to that class of society who travel in these boats .
All this time it was incessantly hopping on behind and gaining on him , so that when the boy got to his own door he had reason for being half dead .
That was their meeting , their conversation , and their parting .
They violate equally the justice that should belong to <NAME> , and the restraints that should belong to gentlemen .
I never commit myself hastily in any affair , and from what I see of this , I by no means like the appearance of it .
It was almost morning , when <NAME> 's wine-shop parted with its last knot of customers , and <NAME> said to madame his wife , in husky tones , while fastening the door : " At last it is come , my dear ! " " Eh well ! " returned madame .
' You ' ll have to introduce one for the phenomenon , so you ' d better make a <NAME> DEUX , and save time. ' ' There ' s nothing easier than that , ' said <NAME> , observing the disturbed looks of the young dramatist .
At length he bethought himself of a widowed cousin , divers times removed , of <NAME> ' s , who had once solicited his influence in the lodger world , and who lived in <NAME> , <NAME> .
He can ' t help his likings and dislikings , perhaps .
' By no means , ' said <NAME> .
<NAME> and Mrs. Squeers at <NAME> <NAME> , being safely landed , left <NAME> and the boys standing with the luggage in the road , to amuse themselves by looking at the coach as it changed horses , while he ran into the tavern and went through the leg-stretching process at the bar .
A small square of carpet in the middle of the room , a few articles of furniture that evidently did not belong to the room , and a disorder of trunks and travelling articles , formed the whole of her surroundings .
" My son , " said he , " it 's two o'clock .
' I expect him every instant , sir , ' said <NAME> .
' My brother <NAME> is a fine fellow , a great fellow ! ' exclaimed brother <NAME> as he shut the door and returned to <NAME> .
One of them , the actual exhibitor no doubt , was a little merry-faced man with a twinkling eye and a red nose , who seemed to have unconsciously imbibed something of his hero ' s character .
<NAME> <NAME> , the gentleman who had accompanied <NAME> into the prison , turned sharp round to the right when he got to the bottom of the little flight of steps , and led the way , through an iron gate which stood open , and up another short flight of steps , into a long narrow gallery , dirty and low , paved with stone , and very dimly lighted by a window at each remote end .
' Can I do anything more , sir ? ' I thanked him and said , <NAME> ; but would he take no dinner himself ?
His legs , which , being long , were afflicted with weakness , graced a pair of Oxford- mixture trousers , made to show the full symmetry of those limbs .
" Is he changed ? " <NAME> asked her .
I had come in with an idea of distinguishing myself rather , conceiving that I was very well prepared ; but it turned out to be quite a mistake .
Even <NAME> , -- a man of an extremely bilious habit , with whom my friend <NAME> is probably acquainted -- can not say a syllable in disputation of the fact. ' Florence felt , more than ever , that there was something to come ; and looked earnestly for it .

' Such an inconvenient staircase and so many corner-stairs <NAME> , ' whispered <NAME> , ' would you object to putting your arm round me under my pelerine ? ' With a sense of going down-stairs in a highly-ridiculous manner , <NAME> descended in the required attitude , and only released his fair burden at the dining-room door ; indeed , even there she was rather difficult to be got rid of , remaining in his embrace to murmur , ' Arthur , for mercy ' s sake , don ' t breathe it to papa ! ' She accompanied <NAME> into the room , where the <NAME> sat alone , with his list shoes on the fender , twirling his thumbs as if he had never left off .
Did you never hear your poor dear papa speak of the young lady who was the daughter of the old lady who boarded in the same house that he boarded in once , when he was a bachelor -- what was her name again ?
' Again I think I may say , that ' s not impossible .
" See arter the <NAME> , <NAME> ; let me look at the <NAME> ' HERALD , when it ' s out o ' hand ; don ' t forget to bespeak the <NAME> ; and just bring the ' TIZER , vill you : " and then he ' d set vith his eyes fixed on the clock , and rush out , just a quarter of a minit ' fore the time to waylay the boy as wos a-comin ' in with the evenin ' paper , which he ' d read with sich intense interest and persewerance as worked the other customers up to the wery confines o ' desperation and insanity , ' specially one i-rascible old gen ' l ' m ' n as the vaiter wos always obliged to keep a sharp eye on , at sich times , fear he should be tempted to commit some rash act with the carving-knife .
It came out in <NAME> Peecher the schoolmistress , watering the flowers in the little dusty bit of garden attached to her small official residence , with little windows like the eyes in needles , and little doors like the covers of school-books .
'It is hard , ' said the good doctor , turning away as he spoke ; 'so young ; so much beloved ; but there is very little hope . '
" How do I know it , <NAME> ?
I am sorry to have disturbed you. ' The glare of his eyes settled down into a look of recognition , and he moved a chair or two , to make a way to the fireside .
<NAME> and <NAME> helped themselves out of the smoke by the usual means , and were put down at a station about midway between the town and <NAME> ' s retreat .
The <NAME> accordingly directed the notice of one of the attendants to him , by saying : ' There is a person outside who seems to be really ill , and to require some help , though he says he does not. ' <NAME> had by this time secured their places , and the departure-bell was about to be rung .
" Your servant , gentlemen ; I 've been dozing .
<NAME> <NAME> rises , when the company have breakfasted , and the servants have left the room ; and wonderfully young he looks , with his white wristbands almost covering his hands ( otherwise rather bony ) , and the bloom of the champagne in his cheeks .
His head hanging over -- like this ! " He turned himself sideways to the carriage , and leaned back , with his face thrown up to the sky , and his head hanging down ; then recovered himself , fumbled with his cap , and made a bow .
When they reached the passage , he laid his finger on his lip , and drawing close to the girl , said , in a whisper .
This getting off is all very well in its way , and it tells with such an anatomical Pump as this one , ' pointing out Mr Venus , ' but it won ' t do with a Man .
he said , laying the bundle on the table .
<NAME> <NAME> was between <NAME> and me in the pew ; but I heard her sing , and the congregation vanished .
' Ay , ay ? ' cried the <NAME> , lifting up his bushy eyebrows a little .
It appears to me , that , under my humble roof , there ' s hardly opening enough for a lady of your genius in other people ' s affairs. ' Mrs. <NAME> gave him a look of the darkest scorn , and said with great politeness , ' Really , sir ? ' ' I have been thinking it over , you see , since the late affairs have happened , ma ' am , ' said <NAME> ; ' and it appears to my poor judgment— ' ' Oh !
'She sold it , ' cried Monks , with desperate eagerness ; 'did she sell it ?
Looking round , he discovered that the individual who resorted to this mode of catching his attention was no other than <NAME> ' s favourite page , better known to the readers of this unvarnished history , by the distinguishing appellation of the fat boy .
<NAME> , you old man , grey .
'That 's what it is , sir , ' replied the constable , coughing with great violence ; for he had finished his ale in a hurry , and some of it had gone the wrong way .
<NAME> bowed his acknowledgments , and was unfeignedly glad to see the cloth laid .
' Then if I row up under the <NAME> and lay there , no need to whistle .
In that event , no doubt , he would establish the <NAME> and the <NAME> , and a little annual <NAME> to <NAME> .
' What d ' ye mean , eh ? ' ' Merely that your kind face and manner -- both so unlike any I have ever seen -- tempted me into an avowal , which , to any other stranger in this wilderness of <NAME> , I should not have dreamt of making , ' returned <NAME> .
Then I will tell you why .
" My instructions are that this boy is to move on . "
' Never ! ' and , by way of showing that he had no desire to be questioned further , he drew a chair close to that of the spinster aunt and sat down .
The policeman , with becoming humility , related how he had taken the charge ; how he had searched <NAME> , and found nothing on his person ; and how that was all he knew about it .
' You hear this , girl ? ' said Mr Dombey sternly to the black-eyed .
But he said to me aside in a meek voice : ' I am well aware , <NAME> , that <NAME> , though an excellent lady , has a quick temper ( indeed I think I had the pleasure of knowing her , when I was a numble clerk , before you did , <NAME> ) , and it ' s only natural , I am sure , that it should be made quicker by present circumstances .
' They must not , indeed , ' rejoined <NAME> firmly , as he prepared to leave the house .
She fancied once that he spoke wildly , and at random ; for on her saying she regretted not to have seen him when she had been there before that morning , he at first replied that he had been to see her , and directly afterwards seemed to wish to recall that answer .
His Uncle and he lay under a great obligation to Mr Dombey , which was of <NAME> ' s own soliciting .
Finding all gentle remonstrance useless , <NAME> at length yielded a reluctant consent to his taking lodgings by the week , of a bald-headed cobbler , who rented a small slip room in one of the upper galleries .
'To be sure you can , and the sooner you go the better , <NAME> ; so make up your loss at once , and do n't lose any more time .
She stopped before a shabby little house , as closely shut up as a house that was full of cracks and crevices could be .
' I said , ' he began , ' when I saw you last , that there was something unexplained , which might perhaps influence you .
The sister may have sometimes sadly thought that if she had remained with him , the companion and friend she had been once , he might have escaped the crime into which he had fallen .
Mr Merdle didn ' t want him , and was put out of countenance when the great creature looked at him ; but inappeasable <NAME> would have him -- and had got him .

Even taking into account what he was before , he is -- hum -- sadly broken ! ' His supper , which was brought to him there , and spread upon the little table where he had seen her working , diverted his attention .

Many people are singularly like each other .
' How it lightens my heart , even in such a strange meeting and parting , to hear this ! ' ' Strange words in my own ears , ' said <NAME> , ' and foreign to the sound of my own voice !
I watched him when you were laying on to little Bolder this afternoon .
He wandered on again , irresolute and undecided , and oppressed with the fear of another solitary night .
' Very well , ' said Mrs. Micawber .
I -- I -- came , ' said <NAME> , speaking more slowly , and with harsher emphasis , ' I came to say how grieved I am that any relative of mine , although disowned by me , should have inflicted such punishment on you as -- ' ' Punishment ! ' interposed <NAME> .
He had turned into the narrow and steep street from which the court of enclosure wherein the house stood opened , when another footstep turned into it behind him , and so close upon his own that he was jostled to the wall .

Here ' s a wenerable old lady a -- lyin ' on the carpet waitin ' for dissection , or galwinism , or some other rewivin ' and scientific inwention. ' ' I forgot , ' exclaimed <NAME> .
Along with the figure-head of <NAME> , ' said the <NAME> , ' there ' s a anchor ; but what ' s the good of my having a anchor , if I can ' t find no bottom to let it go in ? ' Captain <NAME> said this rather in his character of a sagacious citizen and householder , bound to impart a morsel from his stores of wisdom to an inexperienced youth , than in his own proper person .
<NAME> , ' said <NAME> , solemnly , ' is more easier conceived than described .
He rambled through the scenes of his old pursuits -- through many where <NAME> lost him as she listened -- sometimes for hours .
Making an inquiry or two about him in the town , I soon heard what company he was in and was coming among the brick-fields to look for him when I observed you bringing him home here . "
<NAME> tell me thou bean ' t , efther yon chap at schoolmeasther ' s , " says I .
Mr Toots , to whom the question seemed perplexing , suggested ' <NAME> ' em. ' But Mr <NAME> did not appear to think that would do .

I know him ! " He darkly closed an eye at <NAME> 's name , and shook his head .
And <NAME> , firing up as if he were plunging into a Parliamentary <NAME> , really did come out nobly : confirming me in good round terms , and in a plain sensible practical manner , that evidently made a favourable impression .
He spoke in a slushy voice , as if much mud had washed into his throat .
I have the honour to attend court regularly .
There ' s a little summer-house overlooking the river , where we might take a glass of this delicious liquor with a whiff of the best tobacco -- it ' s in this case , and of the rarest quality , to my certain knowledge -- and be perfectly snug and happy , could we possibly contrive it ; or is there any very particular engagement that peremptorily takes you another way , Mr <NAME> , eh ?

Nor could any such spectator fail to know in his own breast , that these men , through their very delusions , showed great qualities , susceptible of being turned to the happiest and best account ; and that to pretend ( on the strength of sweeping axioms , howsoever cut and dried ) that they went astray wholly without cause , and of their own irrational wills , was to pretend that there could be smoke without fire , death without birth , harvest without seed , anything or everything produced from nothing .
' Except when he ' s elevated , <NAME> ' s the quietest creature breathing. ' Here a prolonged imitation of a key-bugle broke upon the ear , succeeded by cheers and screams , all of which evidently proceeded from the throat and lungs of the quietest creature breathing , or in plainer designation , of <NAME> himself .

A woman more angry , passionate , reckless , and revengeful never lived .
<NAME> , when <NAME> , admitted by a girl who was cleaning the house , made her way to the sitting-room , she found <NAME> and <NAME> in tears , and <NAME> just concluding his statement of his nephew ' s misdemeanours .

As soon as he had seen your friend here , safe in a coach with you , he hurried off to where he heard this , ' replied the doctor , 'and mounting his horse sallied forth to join the first party at some place in the outskirts agreed upon between them . '
Not bad quarters , either , " says <NAME> , looking round again .

<NAME> , but almost as dismal .
' We can never be too cautious , ' said Mr Brass .
' You know , <NAME> , ' he said , in my ear ( I did not turn my head ) , ' you ' re in quite a wrong position ' ; which I felt to be true , and that made me chafe the more ; ' you can ' t make this a brave thing , and you can ' t help being forgiven .
<NAME> , if you have any love for your father , you had better not join that gang .
But he did not take his eyes off the robber , for an instant , during this action ; and now that they sat over against each other , face to face , he looked fixedly at him , with his lips quivering so violently , and his face so altered by the emotions which had mastered him , that the housebreaker involuntarily drew back his chair , and surveyed him with a look of real affright .
Should the <NAME> have refused the note ?

' Everybody who is at all acquainted with theatrical matters knows what a host of shabby , poverty-stricken men hang about the stage of a large establishment -- not regularly engaged actors , but ballet people , procession men , tumblers , and so forth , who are taken on during the run of a pantomime , or an Easter piece , and are then discharged , until the production of some heavy spectacle occasions a new demand for their services .
She stole away to bed as quickly as she could , and when she was alone , gave free vent to the sorrow with which her breast was overcharged .

Well : go along with you ! ' ' Do you know anything more , ' said I , standing composedly before her -- she had patted me on the shoulder , and sat down in my chair -- ' of that attachment of <NAME> ? ' She looked up in my face a little while , before replying : ' I think I do , Trot. ' ' Are you confirmed in your impression ? ' I inquired .
<NAME> , forgive me when I say that it was you who first presented to my mind the thought that anyone could wrong me , and wrong him , by such a cruel suspicion. ' ' Me ! ' cried Mrs. Markleham .

If he was to make so bold as say a word to me , I should slap his face.

' <NAME> ' nly they are , <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> ; ' but the turnkeys knows beforehand , and gives the word to the wistlers , and you may wistle for it wen you go to look. ' By this time , <NAME> had tapped at a door , which was opened by a gentleman with an uncombed head , who bolted it after them when they had walked in , and grinned ; upon which <NAME> grinned , and <NAME> also ; whereupon <NAME> , thinking it might be expected of him , kept on smiling to the end of the interview .
And drew a long breath .
' Though , by-the-bye , I suppose it was one of that family that pinted me out ? ' ' No .
Of course I was in love with little Em ' ly .
" Ah , but I do n't know , " replies Jo , shaking his head fearfully , " as he DO N'T hear . "
That , knowing what I do , you dare not tempt me further , ' said <NAME> , ' and by this better right ; that those I serve , and with whom you would have done me base wrong and injury , are her nearest and her dearest friends .
There are six children , and they never come unless the phenomenon plays. ' It would have been difficult for any party , family , or otherwise , to have visited the theatre on a night when the phenomenon did <NAME> play , inasmuch as she always sustained one , and not uncommonly two or three , characters , every night ; but <NAME> , sympathising with the feelings of a father , refrained from hinting at this trifling circumstance , and Mr <NAME> continued to talk , uninterrupted by him .
' " You will never leave me , " murmured the young lady .
Come sundry rooks , from various quarters of the sky , back to the great tower ; who may be presumed to enjoy vibration , and to know that bell and organ are going to give it them .

She looked at me , with some fluttering wonder in her face .
' YOUR varnish is fading. ' Mrs <NAME> descended and went in .

In half an hour , <NAME> was seated at a very satisfactory dinner ; and in three-quarters <NAME> returned with the intelligence that <NAME> Fitz-Marshall had ordered his private room to be retained for him , until further notice .

' I ' m not a going to keep you , even , above an hour , ' said <NAME> .
' <NAME> , ' said Mr Rugg , taking him by the hand , ' you are a young man that it does one good to come across .

But she had never seen so singular a smile as that upon this lady ' s face .
There are three meals a day .
' <NAME> early , no ! ' replied <NAME> .

First , the -- ha -- the distinguished happiness and -- ha -- privilege which I now enjoy and appreciate ; secondly , the arrangement -- hum -- the laying out , that is to say , in the best way , of -- ha , hum -- my money. ' ' Well , sir , ' said Mr Merdle , after turning his tongue again , ' if I can be of any use to you in that respect , you may command me. ' Mr <NAME> ' s speech had had more hesitation in it than usual , as he approached the ticklish topic , for he was not perfectly clear how so exalted a potentate might take it .
Proposing then , this flight -- not this flight , but the flight you thought it -- you told me that in the having given you that meeting , and leaving you to be discovered there , if you so thought fit ; and in the having suffered you to be alone with me many times before , -- and having made the opportunities , you said , -- and in the having openly avowed to you that I had no feeling for my husband but aversion , and no care for myself -- I was lost ; I had given you the power to traduce my name ; and I lived , in virtuous reputation , at the pleasure of your breath. ' ' All stratagems in love -- - ' he interrupted , smiling .

Beside him stood a glass of reeking hot pine-apple rum-and-water , with a slice of lemon in it ; and every time the red-nosed man stopped to bring the round of toast to his eye , with the view of ascertaining how it got on , he imbibed a drop or two of the hot pine-apple rum-and-water , and smiled upon the rather stout lady , as she blew the fire .
The old wintry branches of chandeliers in the room where the mouldering table was spread had been lighted while we were out , and <NAME> was in her chair and waiting for me .

The <NAME> said nothing , but he smoothed <NAME> 's hair over his eyes , and said he 'd know better , by and by ; upon which the old gentleman , observing <NAME> 's colour mounting , changed the subject by asking whether there had been much of a crowd at the execution that morning ?

'There is somebody else who should not be forgotten , by the bye , ' said <NAME> , ringing the bell .
Thoroughly overpowered with the notion of <NAME> being the victim of the tender passion , <NAME> threw himself back in his chair with such violence , that he lost his balance , and pitched over upon the floor ; where ( the accident abating nothing of his merriment ) he lay at full length until his laugh was over , when he resumed his former position , and began another laugh .
' And he can hardly believe it , either , ' said <NAME> , when he returned , ' nor nobody will .

I forget in detail what they were , but I have a general recollection that he was to begin with reviving the <NAME> , and to end with crushing it ; inasmuch as his decease would leave it utterly bereft and without a chance or hope .

After calling at one or two flat places , with low dams stretching out into the lake , whereon were stumpy lighthouses , like windmills without sails , the whole looking like a <NAME> vignette , we came at midnight to <NAME> , where we lay all night , and until nine o ' clock next morning .
It was at the corner of the house , I remember , looking two ways .
You don ' t mean to say that you think -- ' ' Oh no , I think nothing at all , ' retorted <NAME> , pettishly .
' Eh ? ' said <NAME> ; and then he repeated the sneer with increased effect .
After gazing at her in silence , <NAME> turned to <NAME> .
That ' s just his character , ' said I .
' Good-night , <NAME> , ' said the <NAME> .
He begged it to be at once understood , that his own observations had been merely intended to bear a <NAME> construction .
" Why , what do you make out that they done with their buttons then , <NAME> ? " asked the landlord , vacillating weakly .
Why , not much has been done ; not much .
I was to go home next night ; not by the mail , but by the heavy night-coach , which was called the <NAME> , and was principally used by country-people travelling short intermediate distances upon the road .
I 'll tear the life out of you both , but I 'll know what it was . '
Come to me in my room after breakfast to-morrow , will you ? ' ' Yes , father. ' ' Your hands are rather cold , <NAME> .
And the friend I purpose to myself to win , is <NAME> " " You need have good cards , sir , " said the spy .
" Do you mean to let her go in that way ? "
From the <NAME> of <NAME> to the <NAME> of <NAME> , there is a general profession of morality , except among our people ; it really is that exception which makes our people quite reviving .
That , all this had been skilfully done ; but that <NAME> , who was well practised in the arts of low cunning and intrigue , had successfully baffled all their attempts , until an unexpected circumstance had brought him , last night , upon his knees .
" I am not indeed , cousin <NAME> , " replied <NAME> with a smile , " if it is to come from you . "
And I entreat you to say a word for me to <NAME> , and to represent to him that , all circumstances considered , he ought to be more open with me ! " I have never seen two men look more oddly at one another than <NAME> and <NAME> did after this apostrophe .
' <NAME> me , sir , ' says <NAME> , rather less mildly than usual , ' I don ' t agree with you .
If it 's ever broke to him that his rip of a brother has turned up , I could wish , " says the trooper , shaking his head very doubtfully , " to break it myself and be governed as to advancing or retreating by the way in which he seems to take it . "
It gladdens my eyes to see you again ; that ' s all. ' ' Don ' t say that ' s all , because -- ha -- that ' s not all .
So far as it was possible to comprehend him without overstepping those delicate and gradual approaches which <NAME> felt to be the only safe advance , he at first supposed that his daughter 's marriage had taken place yesterday .
' It ' s a shame , ' said the bodyguard reproachfully .
' I humbly beg your forgiveness , godmother .
There ' s Mr Headstone stopping and looking over the wall at the tide , to hint that it ' s time to go .
<NAME> , Mr Dolls , or -- ? ' ' <NAME> ' orth <NAME> , ' said Mr Dolls .
You know where I have heard that song the last time ? ' With his rapid native action , his hands made the outline of a high hook nose , pushed his eyes near together , dishevelled his hair , puffed out his upper lip to represent a thick moustache , and threw the heavy end of an ideal cloak over his shoulder .
The schoolmaster sat for a long time smoking his pipe by the kitchen fire , which was now deserted , thinking , with a very happy face , on the fortunate chance which had brought him so opportunely to the child ' s assistance , and parrying , as well as in his simple way he could , the inquisitive cross-examination of the landlady , who had a great curiosity to be made acquainted with every particular of <NAME> ' s life and history .
Put it to the proof .
' For clearly do I know , mark you , ' pursued <NAME> , pointing his words with his forefinger , ' clearly do I know what question your expressive features puts to me. ' ' What question ? ' said <NAME> .
O mum ! ' <NAME> ' s feelings obliged him to squeeze his hat , and contract one leg at the knee .
The Jew walked to the door : looking over his shoulder at the boy as he went .
So away she went , muttering her message all the way to keep it in her mind , and , at the appointed time , came back .
She has her failings -- as who has not ? -- but I never knew her do it when company was present , at which time you may freely trust her with wines , spirits , or malt liquors .
Waiter as he was , he had human passions and feelings , and he looked very hard at <NAME> as he handed the muffins .
" Ah , my love , my love , " he said , " it is in the subtle poison of such abuses to breed such diseases .
' I ' ll have it explained , though , ' said <NAME> , raising his head and hammering the table .
' <NAME> , I ' m very much obliged to you for the caution , and I ' ll leave particular directions with the servant to lock up the spoons , ' replied <NAME> .
<NAME> , let me introduce you. ' ' How are you , ma ' am ? ' said <NAME> .
" No , <NAME> , not by any means . "
' <NAME> , sir -- beg your pardon , sir. -- Very nice four-wheel chaise , sir -- seat for two behind -- one in front for the gentleman that drives -- oh !
Since the <NAME> shut up his shop , which he did very early to-night , <NAME> has been down and up , and down and up ( with a cheap tight velvet skull-cap on his head , making his whiskers look out of all proportion ) , oftener than before .
I can not say that I have been able to conform myself , in heart and spirit , to your rules ; I can not say that I believe my forty years have been profitable or pleasant to myself , or any one ; but I have habitually submitted , and I only ask you to remember it. ' Woe to the suppliant , if such a one there were or ever had been , who had any concession to look for in the inexorable face at the cabinet .
" That wretch would have married me by violence in another hour. " ' " Confound his impudence ! " said my uncle , bestowing a very contemptuous look on the dying heir of <NAME> .
' We will use no harsh terms , ' said brother <NAME> , in a gentle voice ; ' but accommodate ourselves to the circumstances in which this young lady is placed .
' <NAME> , dear madam , the assurance of my highest and most distinguished consideration , ' A thousand friendships to that dear Flintwinch .
I must speak to you. ' Why did she not , and what was the inward struggle that rendered her incapable of doing so , for minutes , while , in the strong constraint she put upon her face , it was as fixed as any statue ' s -- looking upon him with neither yielding nor unyielding , liking nor hatred , pride not humility : nothing but a searching gaze ?
There had never been so serene an understanding between them since they were first affianced .
O , what a resounding chord !
The <NAME> was sitting in his portentous study , with a globe at each knee , books all round him , <NAME> over the door , and <NAME> on the mantel-shelf .
So I tell you what .
Precisely as a beast might approach the opened gate of his den and eye the freedom beyond , he passed those few moments in watching and peering , until the door was closed upon him .
A light was burning there , and showed her Florence in her bloom of innocence and beauty , fast asleep .
Why do you not take some rest ? ' ' Sleep has left me , ' returned the old man .
<NAME> your father in the same way of life as yourself ? "
' <NAME> , <NAME> , certainly , ' said <NAME> , his eyes glistening with delight at this manifestation of filial feeling on the part of his attendant ; ' certainly , Sam. ' <NAME> made a grateful bow .
<NAME> stooped below the shutters , and <NAME> heard the sound of a bell .
Well , this was her sister , her little sister , much younger than <NAME> , whom she had not seen ( so the story went afterwards ) for five years , and to bring whom to that place on a short visit , she had been saving her poor means all that time .
Does he treat you well ? ' ' You see how he treats me , ' the Secretary answered , with a patient and yet proud air .
' O ' course I came to look arter you , my darlin ' , ' replied <NAME> ; for once permitting his passion to get the better of his veracity .
What possessed you ? " " I do n't know what possessed me , <NAME> , " I replied , letting his shirt sleeve go , and sitting down in the ashes at his feet , hanging my head ; " but I wish you had n't taught me to call Knaves at cards <NAME> ; and I wish my boots were n't so thick nor my hands so coarse. " And then I told <NAME> that I felt very miserable , and that I had n't been able to explain myself to Mrs. <NAME> and <NAME> , who were so rude to me , and that there had been a beautiful young lady at <NAME> 's who was dreadfully proud , and that she had said I was common , and that I knew I was common , and that I wished I was not common , and that the lies had come of it somehow , though I did n't know how .
' Upon my soul , I don ' t know what to say .
Then comes another certain person , in the person of yourself , and charges me , in an equally solemn way , not to mention Jo to that other certain person above all other persons .
The habit , too , of seeking some sort of recompense in the discontented boast of being disappointed , is a habit fraught with degeneracy .
Everywhere ! ' The busy little dressmaker quickly snipped the shirt away , and laid bare the results of as furious and sound a thrashing as even Mr <NAME> merited .
If they would only leave us a little more of the poetry of existence in these terrible days ! ' Mrs <NAME> was looking sharp after Mr Dombey all the time she said this , who was looking at <NAME> : who was listening , but who never lifted up her eyes .
The shadows of night had gathered so fast , that he did not look about him when he closed the door , but plodded straight along the street .
In six months we were to be married , and were to go to <NAME> .
I am disappointed and cut a poor figure. ' ' Am I no one ? ' ' Some one -- and I was coming to you , if you had waited a moment .
' I ' m much obleeged to her , I ' m sure , ' said <NAME> .
Him as come down in the country with Mr .
' You spoke so feelingly to me last night , sir , and I found afterwards that you had been so generous to my father , that I could not resist your message , if it was only to thank you ; especially as I wished very much to say to you -- ' she hesitated and trembled , and tears rose in her eyes , but did not fall .
Traddles now informed me , as the result of his inquiries , that the mere mechanical acquisition necessary , except in rare cases , for thorough excellence in it , that is to say , a perfect and entire command of the mystery of short-hand writing and reading , was about equal in difficulty to the mastery of six languages ; and that it might perhaps be attained , by dint of perseverance , in the course of a few years .
" I 'll redeem it at once .
' The youngest -- there were reasons for his being sensitive and watchful -- was the first to find this out .
No one waiting ? ' ' No , sir , no one waiting. ' ' Thank you , <NAME> .
He had an entirely new suit of glossy clothes on , a shining hat , lilac-kid gloves , a neckerchief of a variety of colours , a large hot-house flower in his button-hole , and a thick gold ring on his little finger .
If you asked me for another penny , and made it an open question , I 'd repent of being so liberal and knock off half-a-crown . "
' Say yes , ' Wegg naturally urges .
In whatever way Mrs <NAME> received the response , it did not provoke her to further questioning , or tempt her into any more remarks at the time , for she relapsed into a thoughtful silence , and remained in that state so long that <NAME> withdrew to the other window and rejoined her grandfather , who was now awake .
<NAME> , for your life , do n't touch the blind ! " The <NAME> turned , with his hand upon the fastening of the window , and said , with a cool , bold smile : " My dear friend , I have a charmed life in this city .
' He walked down the hill , and through the village .
We can not allow those who serve us well to labour under any privation or discomfort that it is in our power to remove .
' A very ill-advised and feverish proceeding this , I am sure .
Noo then , where be ' est thou coomin ' to ?
" It might be a claw , for the flesh there is upon it , " was the <NAME> 's sorrowful reply .
The bell was rung ; the room-door opened ; a man came in , with a halting walk ; and , looking round , <NAME> ' s eyes met those of <NAME> .
Besides , my attention was diverted by my visitor , who was cold after her ride and looked hungry and who , our dinner being brought in , required some little assistance in arraying herself with great satisfaction in a pitiable old scarf and a much-worn and often-mended pair of gloves , which she had brought down in a paper parcel .
<NAME> as he was at this impertinence , there was something so exquisitely absurd in such a cartel of defiance , that <NAME> was obliged to bite his lip and read the note over two or three times before he could muster sufficient gravity and sternness to address the hostile messenger , who had not taken his eyes from the ceiling , nor altered the expression of his face in the slightest degree .
My Aunt Makes up Her Mind About <NAME> .
" My dear friend , he is a lawyer , and a famous one .
He had his hands behind him under the skirts of his riding-coat , and he stood at <NAME> 's elbow as negligently as he might have stood at the <NAME> itself .
I saw before me , lying on the step , the mother of the dead child .
He ' s a most remarkable man -- so extremely whimsical !
' If you suppose that boy to be friendless , Mr Wrayburn , you deceive yourself .
If I makes any guess about it , ' added <NAME> , looking at <NAME> , ' I haven ' t got any right to say what it is , ' fear it should be a wrong ' un. ' ' I have no right to make any further inquiry into the private affairs of a friend , however intimate a friend , ' said <NAME> , after a short silence ; ' at present let me merely say , that I do not understand this at all .
This , <NAME> received as an assurance that he might implicitly rely on <NAME> , if he ever should come to need assistance ; either in any of the matters of which they had spoken that night , or any other subject that could in any way affect himself .
But I see too , <NAME> -- ' ' Still as plain as plain can be , <NAME> ? ' asked the boy playfully .
We have gone into them , and he has not .
<NAME> suggests that it gives employment to some other boys , and that he sees no reason why it shouldn ' t , on the same terms , give employment to you. ' ' He having , ' <NAME> observed in a low voice , and half turning round , ' no other prospect , Murdstone. ' <NAME> , with an impatient , even an angry gesture , resumed , without noticing what he had said : ' Those terms are , that you will earn enough for yourself to provide for your eating and drinking , and pocket-money .
In the yard , was the <NAME> , looking so tremendously benevolent that many enthusiastic Collegians grasped him fervently by the hand , and the wives and female relatives of many more Collegians kissed his hand , nothing doubting that he had done it all .
<NAME> and happy , back in the old house in <NAME> ( though it had nothing in it like the real house ) , unaccountably released and light of heart , he was with <NAME> again , and she told him it was all a dream , and he had never gone away .
' I ' m one of the masters at <NAME> , ' he said .
And sure enough there ' s no light , and the door ' s fast .
She had merely asked a civil question , and to be sure she knew it would meet with a civil answer .
" Do you intend to remain in the house any time ?
He cowered down upon his stone bed , and thought of the past .
Looking at him with the expression of the instant frozen on her face , she sits down on the seat again .
She gave him her hand , and said , ' You wonder to see me here by myself ?
Mr Dombey , recovering his composure by degrees , or cooling his emotion in his sense of having taken a high position , sat gradually stiffening again , and looking at the parrot as she swung to and fro , in her great wedding ring .
" I think he likes me a little , my Lady . "
It is a fair , even-handed , noble adjustment of things , that while there is infection in disease and sorrow , there is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good-humour .
I can not say , however , that it is your fault .
" I asked the favour of seeing you for a few moments here , " said I , " in preference to calling at <NAME> 's because , remembering what you said on an occasion when you spoke to me in confidence , I feared I might otherwise cause you some embarrassment , Mr .
I have heard about it , <NAME> .
<NAME> ' em to somebody else , and take their advice. ' <NAME> would , very likely , have carried on the farce of being offended a little longer , if Mrs. Sliderskew , in her anxiety to restore herself to her former high position in his good graces , had not become so extremely affectionate that he stood at some risk of being smothered by her caresses .
' There was -- pardon me -- really such a person , and at all in his power ? ' hinted <NAME> .
' <NAME> , darling , ' interposed his wife .
You 're dead. " I felt that I had come to the brink of my grave .
He bent his eyes involuntarily upon the father as he spoke , and marked his uneasiness ; for he coloured and turned his head away .
A man who could never sufficiently vaunt himself a self-made man .
Why anything the matter ? ' ' You are so very pale , ' said <NAME> , ' that I should hardly have known you. ' ' Pooh pooh !
It subsided as quickly as it had been roused .
They purposed remaining in <NAME> only three days , prior to departing for some weeks to a distant part of the coast .
These sequestered nooks are the public offices of the legal profession , where writs are issued , judgments signed , declarations filed , and numerous other ingenious machines put in motion for the torture and torment of His <NAME> ' s liege subjects , and the comfort and emolument of the practitioners of the law .
Look round you , my dear , and consider .
Then would he be there to tell that honourable gentleman that it would have been more to his honour , more to his credit , more to his good taste , more to his good sense , more to half the dictionary of commonplaces , if he had left the <NAME> Office alone , and never approached this matter .
If she had one in each eye , it might keep that other drooping lid up , and look more uniform .
' My dear ma ' am -- my dear young lady , ' cried brother <NAME> in violent agitation , ' pray don ' t -- not another word , I beseech and entreat you !
The poor schoolmaster was so open-hearted , and so little versed in the most ordinary cunning or deceit , that she could not have failed to succeed in the first five minutes , but that he happened to be unacquainted with what she wished to know ; and so he told her .
A game-cock in the stableyard , deprived of every spark of his accustomed animation , balanced himself dismally on one leg in a corner ; a donkey , moping with drooping head under the narrow roof of an outhouse , appeared from his meditative and miserable countenance to be contemplating suicide .
<NAME> cold , ' he added pettishly , ' standing at that door , wasting one ' s time with such seedy vagabonds ! ' Having very vehemently stirred a particularly large fire with a particularly small poker , the clerk led the way to his principal ' s private room , and announced <NAME> .
Her former cheerfulness was restored , her step regained its elasticity and lightness , the colour which had forsaken her cheek visited it once again , and <NAME> looked more beautiful than ever .
When he had swallowed a little , he took the glass himself and emptied it .
I think my daughter <NAME> has mentioned to me that you know poor <NAME> ? ' ' O yes ! ' said <NAME> .
' Fred ! ' said Mr <NAME> , finding that his former adjuration had been productive of no effect .
That ' s how she know ' d it .
Where , for the first time in many revolving years , the overwhelming pressure of pecuniary liabilities was not proclaimed , from day to day , by importune voices declining to vacate the passage ; where there was no knocker on the door for any creditor to appeal to ; where personal service of process was not required , and detainees were merely lodged at the gate !
' <NAME> ' t it , too ! ' returned <NAME> , pretending to pout .
<NAME> had been in high spirits , too , and they had walked on , in merry conversation , until they had far exceeded their ordinary bounds .
I have never accused him . "
' In the cause of the right , Mr Wegg ? ' ' Always so , Mr Venus .
I have often seen my mother try it , and it seemingly refreshed her .
Soon afterwards , <NAME> , <NAME> , and I , had a cold dinner together ; but we dined in the best parlor , not in the old kitchen , and <NAME> was so exceedingly particular what he did with his knife and fork and the saltcellar and what not , that there was great restraint upon us .
<NAME> <NAME> ' s boat was perfect .
Both walked sullenly on , as though their thoughts were busily occupied , until they were quite clear of the crowd , and almost alone , when <NAME> wheeled round to return .
' This is very extraordinary ! ' ' What is , <NAME> ? ' ' Why here ' s Mr Rokesmith now ! ' ' <NAME> , no , <NAME> , no , ' cried <NAME> , greatly flurried .
In her progress to , and happy arrival at , this resolution , she was possibly influenced , not only by her maternal affections but by three politic considerations .
This testimony , so long as I live , and so long as my descendants have any legal right in my books , I shall cause to be republished , as an appendix to every copy of those two books of mine in which I have referred to <NAME> .
Let us take one of those same little children to be a little maid to <NAME> .
<NAME> ' t be like <NAME> on a mantelpiece frowning at <NAME> , but sit down , and I ' ll tell you something that you really will find amusing .
You don ' t care who goes , I suppose ?
So the lady screamed , and <NAME> started .
Will you have it now ? ' I thanked him and said , ' Yes. ' Upon which he poured it out of a jug into a large tumbler , and held it up against the light , and made it look beautiful .
You think that her father , even in this sad state , will submit himself to her ; do you not ? " " I am sure of it. " " I thought so .
' Just damp enough to be cheerful , sir , ' rejoined <NAME> .
It was very easy , <NAME> said , to make a galley-slave of a boy all the half-year , and then score him up idle ; and to crib two dinners a-week out of his board , and then score him up greedy ; but that wasn ' t going to be submitted to , he believed , was it ?
" I wish he had let it off , " says the benevolent old man , " and blown his head into as many pieces as he owed pounds ! "
In two minutes thereafter , <NAME> was joking with the young ladies who wouldn ' t come over the stile while he looked -- or who , having pretty feet and unexceptionable ankles , preferred standing on the top rail for five minutes or so , declaring that they were too frightened to move -- with as much ease and absence of reserve or constraint , as if he had known them for life .
She took very kindly to me and was extremely confidential , so much so that sometimes she almost made me uncomfortable .
' In the polite circles I believe this sort of thing isn ' t usually said to a gentleman in his own apartments , but never mind that .
Accordingly , Mr <NAME> slipped past Mr Wegg and towed him down .
' <NAME> well , indeed ! ' said the <NAME> .
' This lady , <NAME> , has come here , to give information of an intended duel in this town. ' <NAME> , not knowing exactly what to do , smiled a dependent ' s smile .
' Lift him out , ' said <NAME> , after he had literally feasted his eyes , in silence , upon the culprit .
' I have no scruple in saying , in the presence of our friends here , that I am a man who has , for some years , contended against the pressure of pecuniary difficulties. ' I knew he was certain to say something of this kind ; he always would be so boastful about his difficulties .
' Nobody will pay you interest for the money , I suppose , between this and twelve o ' clock ; will they ? ' ' But nobody would pay you interest for it either , you know , ' returned <NAME> , leering at <NAME> with all the cunning and slyness he could throw into his face .
<NAME> had heard enough before quitting the room , to know that <NAME> loved her yet ; that she had suffered for her sake ; and that she had kept her sacrifices quiet , lest they should trouble her peace .
It would be harsh , and perhaps not altogether true , to say of him that he felt these rubs and gratings against his pride more keenly than he had felt his wife ' s death : but certainly they impressed that event upon him with new force , and communicated to it added weight and bitterness .
That feline personage , with her lips tightly shut and her eyes looking out at him sideways , softly closes the door before replying .
However , father and daughter did at last appear , and <NAME> was ready at the street door to receive them .
I know what it is to be jilted , <NAME> ; I have endured that sort of thing three or four times. ' ' I am much obliged to you , for your condolence on what you presume to be my melancholy case , ' said <NAME> , winding up his watch , and laying it on the table , ' but -- ' ' No , no , ' said <NAME> , ' not a word more ; it ' s a painful subject .
So surely as they raised their voices , the old man got quite blithe and loud ; and so surely as they stopped , his vigour sank again .
He inquired within -- he took the lodgings ; and on the very next day he entered into possession of them .
Besides the prison to which I have already referred , this town contains a pretty arsenal and other institutions .
The moment that she touched the door on this night , <NAME> found that it was open .
To the little inn yonder ? ' ' Let us wait here , ' rejoined <NAME> .
'What 's the good of talking in that way to me ; why do n't yer speak so as I can understand yer ? '
" She is like the morning , " he said .
" And you do n't think it 's an answer , eh ?
I have slept in that room , ' added <NAME> , sinking his voice a little , ' for four-and-forty year ; and if it wasn ' t inconvenient , and didn ' t interfere with business , I should request leave to die there. ' ' Damn you , <NAME> , how dare you talk about dying ? ' roared the twins by one impulse , and blowing their old noses violently .
<NAME> was very bald , and very red , and though ( of course ) an undeniably fine infant , somewhat crushed and spotty in his general effect , as yet .
She must be an immense age , and yet she is as active and handsome !
When he had gone to his own room , and had again thrown himself into the chair by the fire , Mr <NAME> knocked at the door , candle in hand , to ask him how and at what hour he proposed returning on the morrow ?
I would not endure it .
' ' Tis like to be long , ' said <NAME> , in a low voice , ' afore the boat finds new tenants .
' A very natural thought , at all events , after seeing me gazing at those bills .
<NAME> ' t you remember ? ' With slowly dawning remembrance , Mr Venus rises , and holds his candle over the little counter , and holds it down towards the legs , natural and artificial , of Mr Wegg .
I ' ll never believe you again , and never tell you anything more about Mr Carker the <NAME> , if I find out that you have been deceiving me ! ' <NAME> laughingly defied him to find out anything of the kind ; and <NAME> , revolving in his thoughts all sorts of impracticable ways of making fortunes and placing the wooden Midshipman in a position of independence , betook himself to the offices of <NAME> and <NAME> with a heavier countenance than he usually carried there .
' <NAME> ' t be angry with me. ' ' Is it good news , pleasant news , news to make a man skip and snap his fingers ? ' said the dwarf .
Is it Havisham or -- ? " I had nothing to add .
<NAME> , ' said <NAME> , after a few moments ' reflection , ' I must go out at once. ' ' Go out ! ' cried <NAME> .
I assure you , <NAME> , that I only praise <NAME> , because he is your husband and so fond of you. ' Sophronia ' s glance was as if a rather new light broke in upon her .
There were some minutes of discussion between them before they came to this conclusion , during which the staring <NAME> paid close attention to both speakers , and inclined his ear to each by turns , as if he were appointed arbitrator of the argument .
' I know who it is .
But if you will undertake to pen my lord into that furthest drawing-room where he is now so profoundly engaged , I will undertake to bring our dear Merdle into the presence , without the possibility of getting away. ' ' Done ! ' said <NAME> .
I have a character to maintain. ' After a momentary struggle with myself , I turned my eyes upon him , and said , ' You have heard my question .
You wo n't see him alive again , <NAME> .
It don ' t mind me. ' ' Is he asleep ? ' ' No , I think not .
' You are ! ' said Mr Carker .
When dinner-time came , <NAME> drew the arm of her new charge through hers , and led her down-stairs , and presented her to the <NAME> and Mr <NAME> , who were already in the dining-room waiting to begin .
As the world runs , it ought to have been a sound , hearty cuff ; for <NAME> had been duped , deceived , and wronged by the destitute outcast who was now wholly in his power .
It leaves the lowest of the range of dust-mountains , with some sort of a dwelling-house at its foot , to an old servant who is sole executor , and all the rest of the property -- which is very considerable -- to the son .
I hate you ! ' And he would have visited his hatred upon it all with the scowl he threw about him , if he could .
But three or four mile gained to-night is so many saved to-morrow , and if you keep on , I think our best way is to do the same. ' ' Where ' s your partner ? ' inquired <NAME> .
" That is all I have to trouble you with , <NAME> . "
Altogether , it was a scene I could not help dwelling on with pleasure , for a long time after I got back and had wished <NAME> good night .
I could bear , and I have borne , a great deal from <NAME> ; but he insulted me too far .
There , we meant to lie by all night .
' How goes the world , my Flintwinch ?
It was a town of machinery and tall chimneys , out of which interminable serpents of smoke trailed themselves for ever and ever , and never got uncoiled .
It ' s a cold , cold night , and the fog clings so. ' As <NAME> helped her to turn her chair , her loosened bonnet dropped on the floor .
When she was dead , I apprehend he first told his daughter what he had done , and then the son became a part of the family , residing in the house you are acquainted with .
In this same <NAME> ( if that were it which came to his dinners , and to Mrs Merdle ' s receptions and concerts ) , he hardly seemed to enjoy himself much , and was mostly to be found against walls and behind doors .
But , nothing happening , and the moon looking down upon him as if he were dead after a fit of wrath , he holds his steam-hammer beating head and heart , and staggers away .
And it has not been , ' added <NAME> , after a moment ' s pause , ' all heedlessness on my part , <NAME> ; for I have felt an interest in Mr Carker ever since I have been here , and have hardly been able to help speaking of him sometimes , when I have thought of him so much ! ' <NAME> said this from his soul , and with the very breath of honour .
He could not but admit to himself that he might not have made this journey , if he could have foreseen the events of a few days .
Yet , having already made his fortune in his own mind , he was so unassuming with it that I felt quite grateful to him for not being puffed up .
Mr Abel remained behind , very often looking at his watch and at the room door , until Mr <NAME> was roused from a short nap , by the setting-down on the landing-place outside , as from the shoulders of a porter , of some giant load , which seemed to shake the house , and made the little physic bottles on the mantel-shelf ring again .

These losses are much to be deplored , sir , but we must look ' em in the face. ' ' If the money I have sacrificed had been all my own , Mr Rugg , ' sighed Mr Clennam , ' I should have cared far less. ' ' Indeed , sir ? ' said Mr Rugg , rubbing his hands with a cheerful air .

' It was of no use trying reason then , with that vehement panting creature ( <NAME> knows what her mother ' s story must have been ) ; so I quietly told her that she should not go at that late hour of night , and I gave her my hand and took her to her room , and locked the house doors .
Upon your solemn word and honour. ' The old man shook his head .

As I sat by <NAME> ' s crib , on the night before the election , <NAME> was very uneasy in her sleep. ' The <NAME> chemist , who is gloomily looking on , has diabolical impulses to suggest ' Wind ' and throw up his situation ; but represses them .
She began to think , too , that <NAME> was not quite so agreeable a creature as she had at first supposed him ; for , although a skilful flatterer is a most delightful companion if you can keep him all to yourself , his taste becomes very doubtful when he takes to complimenting other people .
Nothing unbecoming tinged the pride ; it was a natural and worthy one ; but he observed it as a curiosity .

To be sure <NAME> looked out of his window very early that morning to see which way the clouds were flying , and to be sure <NAME> would have been at hers too , if she had not sat up so late over-night , starching and ironing small pieces of muslin , and crimping them into frills , and sewing them on to other pieces to form magnificent wholes for next day ' s wear .
His glasses were in his hand , and he had just looked round ; surprised at first , no doubt , by her step upon the stairs , not expecting her until night ; surprised again , by seeing <NAME> in her company .

Unfortunately the morning was drizzly , and an angel could not have concealed the fact that <NAME> was shedding sooty tears outside the window , like some weak giant of a Sweep .
And I believe my brother was speaking on the subject when we -- not very decently -- interrupted him. ' ' I think , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , in a low grave voice , ' that there may be better and more dispassionate judges of such a question than you. ' ' <NAME> , ' replied my mother , timidly , ' you are a far better judge of all questions than I pretend to be .

I was so lonely and so blank without her , and it was so desolate to be going home with no hope of seeing her there , that I could get no comfort for a little while as I walked up and down in a dim corner sobbing and crying .
Give me grown-ups. ' It was difficult to guess the age of this strange creature , for her poor figure furnished no clue to it , and her face was at once so young and so old .
My dear ladies -- you may bind me hand and leg , or lock me up in a closet , if you like .
I repeated , pinching her cheek .
I really thought she was , she had been so short with me ; but I was quite mistaken : for she laid aside her work ( which was a stocking of her own ) , and opening her arms wide , took my curly head within them , and gave it a good squeeze .

The mother rose on being so addressed and fell upon the woman 's neck .
' Not at all , I don ' t wish it , we needn ' t stand upon that footing , <NAME> being a permanency , <NAME> a temporary. ' <NAME> made use of none but comma pauses ; shooting out whatever she had to say in one sentence , and in one breath , if possible .

My hat ( which had served me for a night-cap , too ) was so crushed and bent , that no old battered handleless saucepan on a dunghill need have been ashamed to vie with it .

His form of cheek , eye , and temple , and his colour , are repeated in her .

Now he ' s singing ! ' Mr <NAME> was certainly entertaining himself with vocal exercise , but it was rather a kind of chant than a song ; being a monotonous repetition of one sentence in a very rapid manner , with a long stress upon the last word , which he swelled into a dismal roar .
He did no work for two or three years before he died , but lived in clover ; and his last act ( like a choleric old gentleman ) was to kick his doctor .
They searched every nook and corner round , together and separately ; they shouted , whistled , laughed , called -- and all with the same result .
' Quite charming. ' ' Has she come to sit upon <NAME> ' s knee , ' said the dwarf , in what he meant to be a soothing tone , ' or is she going to bed in her own little room inside here ?
" I have no patience with him , " observed <NAME> 's niece .
Seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point , the gentlemen withdrew .

The smallest boy I ever conversed with , carrying the largest baby I ever saw , offered a supernaturally intelligent explanation of the locality in its old uses , and was very nearly correct .
I ' ll manage him. ' After a little rolling about , in a close scuffle which caused the faces of both to be besmeared with blood , the man took his knee from <NAME> ' s chest , and rose , saying : ' There !
I never stirred in all that time from the <NAME> side , whither I had gone at first .
I have no remembrance of the process. " <NAME> Attorney-General sat down , and the father and daughter sat down together .

And four wooden legs are more troublesome to you than two , when you don ' t want any. ' Mr Pancks concluded by blowing off that steam of his .
The baby soon appeared , carried in great glory by <NAME> ; while <NAME> , in custody of that active young constable , <NAME> , brought up the rear .

Get me a coach ! ' However much astonished I might be , I was sensible that I had no right to refuse compliance with such a peremptory command .
Glass of wine , Sir. ' ' With pleasure , ' said <NAME> ; and the stranger took wine , first with him , and then with <NAME> , and then with <NAME> , and then with <NAME> , and then with the whole party together , almost as rapidly as he talked .
' For the man of wrath , too ! ' added <NAME> ; ' it makes a vessel ' s heart bleed ! ' <NAME> was overheard by his son to murmur something relative to making a vessel ' s nose bleed ; but <NAME> heard him not .
But there are such places yonder. ' ' And far from here ? ' said <NAME> .
It was as if I had seen her admiringly and tenderly embracing <NAME> , and tacitly reproving me , by her considerate protection , for my hot haste in fluttering that little heart .
I was not disturbed by <NAME> ( who took off his gloves to dine ) , though he sat opposite to me at the small table , for I doubt if , looking up at all , he once removed his eyes from his host 's face .
' Here ' s my dear boy -- my dear boy , <NAME> , who brought us together , <NAME> !
" You see again , <NAME> , " observed Mrs. Jellyby serenely , " what a happiness it is to be so much occupied as I am and to have this necessity for self-concentration that I have .
And I have been lingering about , ' added <NAME> , ' like a bailiff ; or , ' with a look at <NAME> , ' an old clothesman. ' The Jew lifted up his eyes , and took in <NAME> once more , at another glance .
You quite surprise me ! ' And again he uttered never a word .
' My dear love , ' said <NAME> .
Why , only think how old she looked .
Accidents , miseries , and offences , were never to be mentioned before her .
' Good- morning , sir. ' ' You ' re a soft customer , you are ; we ' ve got it all out o ' you , anyhow , ' thought <NAME> , as <NAME> walked away .
The time will come -- and soon enough -- when you will understand this better , and will feel it too , as no one save a woman can . "
I wish he was , poor man ! '
That makes no noise , and is quite as certain , and more genteel .
Mrs. <NAME> felt it proper to be agitated ; and as none of the three exactly knew whether under existing circumstances , any communication , otherwise than through <NAME> & <NAME> , ought to be held with <NAME> ' s servant , they were all rather taken by surprise .
" Now , do n't echo , " I retorted .
By the time they alighted there , it was quite dark ; and , proceeding by the dead wall in front of the <NAME> , they entered a small by-street , which is , or was at that time , called <NAME> , and which , whatever it may be now , was in those days a desolate place enough , surrounded by little else than fields and ditches .

' <NAME> is quite comfortable now , <NAME> , ' I remarked , for his satisfaction .
The supposed <NAME> descends , and the seamstress is lifted out next after him .
<NAME> , my love , your hand here. ' ' Oh dear !

It comes out with him among his servants , and yet he leaves it whispering behind ; he sees it pointing after him in the street ; it is waiting for him in his counting-house ; it leers over the shoulders of rich men among the merchants ; it goes beckoning and babbling among the crowd ; it always anticipates him , in every place ; and is always busiest , he knows , when he has gone away .
' When they are , you know what to do with them as well as any man alive , and how to back quietly out at the right time , ' said <NAME> , slapping the capitalist familiarly on the shoulder .
You remember me ? ' ' You remember what I told you I had been , and where I came from , ragged and lame , with the fierce wind and weather beating on my head ? ' ' Yes. ' ' You know how I came back that night , and threw your money in the dirt , and you and your race .
Quietly , quietly , the reflected marks of the prison bars and of the zig-zag iron on the wall-top , faded away .

Who do you suppose is with me ? "
'Very much so indeed , ma'am , ' said the beadle .
We must tell papa about it either to-night or to-morrow , according to the opportunities .

" Regular rules ! " Here , he skipped from his right leg on to his left .
You have heard him say so fifty times .
Why , here ' s your father , <NAME> !
" I ' m in such a state of mind that I hardly know what I write " -- blot -- " if you could see me at this minute shedding tears for my past misconduct " -- pepper-castor -- " my hand trembles when I think " -- blot again -- if that don ' t produce the effect , it ' s all over. ' By this time , Mr <NAME> had finished his entry , and he now replaced his pencil in its little sheath and closed the book , in a perfectly grave and serious frame of mind .
Whatever the man ' s labour , the girl was never employed ; but sat , when she was with him , in a listless , moping state , and idle .
' Half a dozen years ago , or so , ' <NAME> proceeds , ' when I had enlarged my mind up to—I will not say to what it now is , for that might seem to aim at too much , but up to the pitch of wanting another mind to be absorbed in it—I cast my eye about me for a nuptial partner .

The bland and open-hearted proprietor of <NAME> ' s <NAME> slept on amidst the congenial accompaniments of rain , mud , dirt , damp , fog , and rats , until late in the day ; when , summoning his valet <NAME> to assist him to rise , and to prepare breakfast , he quitted his couch , and made his toilet .
" Thank you , <NAME> , " says <NAME> with his usual equanimity .
Now , the fact was , that in the inmost recesses of his own heart , <NAME> was strongly disposed to admit that <NAME> 's appearance and manner were unusually prepossessing ; but he had a strong appetite for contradiction , sharpened on this occasion by the finding of the orange-peel ; and , inwardly determining that no man should dictate to him whether a boy was well-looking or not , he had resolved , from the first , to oppose his friend .
That fearful Impostor , <NAME> , immediately nodded , and said , as he rubbed the arms of his chair , " It 's more than that , Mum. " " Why , you do n't mean to say -- " began my sister .
Give me something , or I ' ll call it after you ! ' croaked the old woman , passionately .
' Oh , indeed ! ' Mrs. <NAME> smiled sweetly , <NAME> bowed , and Mrs. <NAME> said , ' she was sure she was very happy to have an opportunity of being known to a lady which she had heerd so much in favour of , as Mrs. Rogers. ' A compliment which the last-named lady acknowledged with graceful condescension .
' Why , you ' ve been having the place cleaned up ! ' he exclaimed .
He quite enters into it .

Here I am ! ' Glancing round contemptuously at the bedstead , which was turned up by day , he leaned his back against it as a resting-place , without removing his hat from his head , and stood defiantly lounging with his hands in his pockets .
He had walked no more than twelve miles , when night closed in again .

Ding , but thou mak ' st noise eneaf ! ' With these words , <NAME> opened the door himself , and opening his eyes too to their utmost width , cried , as he clapped his hands together , and burst into a hearty roar : ' <NAME> , it be the godfeyther , it be the godfeyther !
The Captain therefore hemmed to clear his throat , and read the letter aloud .

But Mr <NAME> said he would do a great deal more than that , if he could ; and indeed he did more as it was : for he helped <NAME> to undress , and helped him to bed , in the kindest manner possible , and then sat down by the bedside and chuckled very much ; while Mr Feeder , <NAME> , leaning over the bottom of the bedstead , set all the little bristles on his head bolt upright with his bony hands , and then made believe to spar at <NAME> with great science , on account of his being all right again , which was so uncommonly facetious , and kind too in Mr Feeder , that <NAME> , not being able to make up his mind whether it was best to laugh or cry at him , did both at once .
But the more he asked Mrs. Micawber to look up , the more she fixed her eyes on nothing ; and the more he asked her to compose herself , the more she wouldn ' t .

' I am as cheerful , father , as I usually am , or usually have been. ' ' That ' s well , ' said <NAME> .

' Well I am sure , <NAME> , my dear , you ' re very polite ! ' replied <NAME> .
" From the Hulks ! " " Oh-h ! " said I , looking at <NAME> .

' I never heard of that , ' interrupted Monks in a tone intended to appear incredulous , but savouring more of disagreeable surprise .
<NAME> <NAME> , with his hands in his pockets , hovered restlessly about these delicacies , stopping occasionally to whisk the flies out of the sugar-basin with his wife ' s pocket-handkerchief , or to dip a teaspoon in the milk-pot and carry it to his mouth , or to cut off a little knob of crust , and a little corner of meat , and swallow them at two gulps like a couple of pills .

If I showed any trace of what I felt , my own sorrows were sufficient to account for it .

I saw him so often in the course of the evening , which passed very pleasantly , contemplate <NAME> and <NAME> with an interest and a satisfaction that made his fine face remarkably agreeable as he sat at a little distance from the piano listening to the music -- and he had small occasion to tell us that he was passionately fond of music , for his face showed it -- that I asked my guardian as we sat at the backgammon board whether <NAME> had ever been married .
' Rough people -- paths never made for little feet like yours -- a dismal blighted way -- is there no turning back , my child ? ' ' There is none , ' cried <NAME> , pressing forward .
' Now , sir , ' said <NAME> , ' all is safe and quiet .
He did n't make a very desperate resistance , miss !

On deck , I took leave of poor Mrs. Micawber .
If he had hesitated for one instant to punish <NAME> most severely , it must be quite clear to every experienced reader that he would have been , according to all precedents in disputes of matrimony established , a brute , an unnatural husband , an insulting creature , a base imitation of a man , and various other agreeable characters too numerous for recital within the limits of this chapter .
' Not the lad I speak on , ' said the <NAME> .
It ' s natur ; ain ' t it , cook ? ' ' Don ' t ask me , imperence , ' replied the cook , in a high state of delight ; and hereupon the cook and <NAME> laughed again , till what between the beer , and the cold meat , and the laughter combined , the latter young lady was brought to the verge of choking -- an alarming crisis from which she was only recovered by sundry pats on the back , and other necessary attentions , most delicately administered by <NAME> .
' Not even going ; gone. ' ' Has he turned girl or baby ? ' muttered <NAME> , with a fretful gesture .
As soon as he had apologized for the remissness of his memory , he asked me if he should send <NAME> for <NAME> ?
The best way that I can think of would be to send a card , and my compliments , ( I ' ve no doubt he ' d take ' em for a pot of porter , ) by this young man , to the <NAME> with Two Necks .
<NAME> to this , that he was good-looking and intelligent , had a plentiful share of vivacity , was extremely cheerful , and accommodated himself in five minutes ' time to all <NAME> ' s oddities with as much ease as if he had known him from a boy ; and it will be a source of no great wonder that , when they parted for the night , he had produced a most favourable impression , not only upon the worthy Yorkshireman and his wife , but upon <NAME> also , who , revolving all these things in his mind as he made the best of his way home , arrived at the conclusion that he had laid the foundation of a most agreeable and desirable acquaintance .
' I expect a letter from the solicitor respecting that mortgage of <NAME> ' s .

' ' I don ' t know nothing rightly about anything , ' said <NAME> ; ' and if ever you said a true word in your life , it ' s when you call me a heap of confusion , for you two clever ones have done your most to make me such .
From this soft mood she was soon aroused , with a very wholesome and refreshing effect , by the voice of Mrs Pipchin outside the door .
' <NAME> , ' said she in continuation , ' you are acquainted with the family , and have interested yourself with the family , and are influential with the family .
Well , <NAME> , I was about to say : -- it might be painful to you to find yourself mistaken , it might be painful to <NAME> to have the task of being explicit with you , it might be very painful to <NAME> to have the task of being explicit with you .

In short , there ' s a dwelling-house rent-free , attached to my new position , and we must occupy it. ' ' That ' s a gain , <NAME> ' ' Yes , my dear , it is undoubtedly a gain. ' He gave her a very blithe look , and a very sly look .
<NAME> 's history was no sooner unfolded to him , than he poured forth a shower of mingled threats and execrations ; threatened to make her the first victim of the combined ingenuity of Messrs. Blathers and <NAME> ; and actually put on his hat preparatory to sallying forth to obtain the assistance of those worthies .
A movement of timid curiosity impelled her , when she approached the spot , to glance towards the fire .
Alone again , in his own room , Mr <NAME> applied himself to work , and worked all day .
He must have some object .
Consequently , though she was very light , she was out of breath and could not speak at first , as she stood panting , and wiping her arms , and looking quietly at us .
The <NAME> looked desolately round the room , shook his head , and answered , in a low voice , " Not at all. " " Now , as to the future , " hinted <NAME> .
I ' ve prepared the way for you. ' Mr Boffin , entering the usual chamber , laid his stick upon the settle usually reserved for him , thrust his hands into his pockets , and , with his shoulders raised and his hat drooping back upon them , looking disconsolately at <NAME> .

<NAME> , and taking pains , too , for I know what such pains are .
I am afraid to see a newspaper , or to hear a word spoken of what is done in <NAME> , lest he should have done some violence. ' ' Then you are not afraid of him for yourself , dear ? ' said <NAME> , after pondering on the words .
<NAME> <NAME> gently shook his head to impose silence on his friend , and resumed : 'Do you know where this poor boy is now ? '
They all confusedly went out : Louisa crying to him that she forgave him , and loved him still , and that he would one day be sorry to have left her so , and glad to think of these her last words , far away : when some one ran against them .

<NAME> said to me , ' Let us go to the theatre , <NAME> ! ' There was no bedroom before me , but again the jingling table covered with glasses ; the lamp ; <NAME> on my right hand , <NAME> on my left , and <NAME> opposite -- all sitting in a mist , and a long way off .
Perhaps your friend in the city does .
His hurried right hand parcelled out the herbs before him into imaginary beds of flowers in a garden ; and his efforts to control and steady his breathing shook the lips from which the colour rushed to his heart .
He is much to me. ' ' What can he be to you ? ' ' He can be a rival to me among other things , ' said <NAME> .
Mrs. Micawber shrieked , and folded <NAME> in her embrace .
We must fight our way onward .
Two or three Collegians whom they passed , looked after them too , and presently joining Mr Chivery , formed a little group on the Lodge steps , in the midst of which there spontaneously originated a whisper that the <NAME> was going to get his discharge .
He opened his eyes after a few seconds , and looked anxiously round .
It very nearly drove him to it. ' Whether the deceased might not have been better off if he had emigrated in his bachelor days , was a question which his relict did not stop to consider ; for <NAME> entered the room , with her workbox , in this stage of her reflections ; and a much slighter interruption , or no interruption at all , would have diverted Mrs. <NAME> ' s thoughts into a new channel at any time .
I trust I disturb no one ; but there _was_ a paper-knife—O , thank you , I am sure ! ' and disappears with her prize .
' Night after night comes and goes , and I have no rest .
I showed him , <NAME> , at his window , to <NAME> , who was often the spy in the day .
O poor thing , poor thing ! ' These words through her fast-dropping tears .
Or do you kiss my hand in the same spirit in which I once let you kiss my cheek ? " " What spirit was that ? " said I .
' Doctor , ' said the turnkey , ' here ' s a gentleman ' s wife in want of you without a minute ' s loss of time ! ' The doctor ' s friend was in the positive degree of hoarseness , puffiness , red-facedness , all-fours , tobacco , dirt , and brandy ; the doctor in the comparative -- hoarser , puffier , more red-faced , more all-fourey , tobaccoer , dirtier , and brandier .
' For this reason , ' resumed <NAME> , ' I address myself to you , ma ' am .
So I run away that night , and come here , and told ' em you was my brother , and they believed me , and I ' ve been here ever since. ' ' This poor little <NAME> has been wearing herself to death ! ' cried <NAME> .
" But excellent Boythorn might say , " returned our host , swelling and growing very red , " I 'll be -- " " I understand , " said <NAME> .
The little man gave a double-knock on the lid of his snuff-box , opened it , took a great pinch , shut it up again , and repeated the words , ' With you. ' ' I say , my dear Sir , ' resumed the little man , who seemed to gather confidence from the snuff -- ' I say , that her speedy liberation or perpetual imprisonment rests with you , and with you alone .
Looking back at him , I thought of the first night of his return , when our positions were reversed , and when I little supposed my heart could ever be as heavy and anxious at parting from him as it was now .
The rooms are in darkness now ; and to see <NAME> with a wax-light in his hand , holding it above his head and taking a sharp mental inventory of the many delicate objects so curiously at variance with himself , would be to see a sight -- which nobody <NAME> see , as he is particular to lock himself in .
He held her clasped in his left arm , and between whiles her low voice was heard tenderly imploring him to go away with her .
In this dilemma , Mr <NAME> , whose resources appeared equal to any emergency in the <NAME> waters , slipped on his hat , slipped out at the counting-house door , and slipped in again a moment afterwards with an artificial freshness upon him , as if he had been in the country for some weeks .
" I was wrong ; I ought not to have said so , my dear , either , " said I , patting her cheek as kindly as a rough old fellow like me could pat it , " for your mother ' s was one , and so was yours. " " It ' s not that I meant , pa , " said <NAME> .
' Old lady , ' returned Mr Boffin , ' you keep still .
' Bitter poor , my deary , ' replied the old woman .
I couldn ' t do it ! ' ' Why not ? ' returned the <NAME> , gazing at him in astonishment .
Leaving them together , I went home to <NAME> ' s ; more melancholy myself , if possible , than I had been yet .
I know that a great many empty bottles were one of the consequences of this traffic , and that certain men and boys were employed to examine them against the light , and reject those that were flawed , and to rinse and wash them .
<NAME> , old boy , " kissing him , " one for yourself , three for the children .
She was a devoted creature .
' You look very well , <NAME> , ' I said , thinking he would like to know it .
Therefore , not to be remiss in his duty as a father , he threw a pair of sea-boots at <NAME> , which she ducked to avoid , and then cried , poor thing , using her hair for a pocket-handkerchief .
In fact , <NAME> ' s establishment was a great hot-house , in which there was a forcing apparatus incessantly at work .
On one of the fore-most chairs , stands The <NAME> , looking about for her friend .
What harmony , besides her age and her simplicity , surrounded her , he did not know , but even in this fantastic action there was a something neither out of time nor place : a something which it seemed as if nobody else could have made as serious , or done with such a natural and touching air .
'If your answer be what I almost dare to hope it is , ' retorted <NAME> , 'it will shed a gleam of happiness upon my lonely way , and light the path before me .
' You won ' t do it agin , ' said the boy , nodding his head and drawing back , with the elbows ready in case of the worst ; ' now -- ' ' <NAME> still , you dog , ' said <NAME> .
<NAME> , if you could enter into this arrangement , and could answer for <NAME> , it would be a relief to my feelings that I should think cheap at the sacrifice of a considerable portion of my property. ' ' My lad , ' returned the <NAME> , ' say no more .
The <NAME> church is represented , in this remote place , as in most other parts of <NAME> , by a gentleman of great worth and excellence .
He got down , and looked eagerly inside for the beautiful young lady .
she said in a whisper .
He says he takes <NAME> to be more knave than fool ; and old Fluggers , who does the heavy business you know , HE says that when he delivered messages at <NAME> the season before last , there used to be a pickpocket hovering about the coach-stand who had exactly the face of <NAME> ; though , as he very properly says , <NAME> may not be the same , but only his brother , or some near relation. ' ' Oh ! ' cried <NAME> again .
<NAME> is a dreadful thing when it accuses man or boy ; but when , in the case of a boy , that secret burden co-operates with another secret burden down the leg of his trousers , it is ( as I can testify ) a great punishment .
I somehow made it out that when ladies had bad homes and mothers , they went wrong in their way , too ; but that their way was not so foul a one as mine , and they had need to bless God for it .
' Yes ; I ' m going , <NAME> , if you please , ' said <NAME> .
They joked freely with one another , but seldom with him .
But I shall call you the master. " So I went up to the top of the house and he showed me the handsome girl ( very well worth looking at she was ) , and I was called the master .
" It is <NAME> , " said madame .
" Besides , " he said , pursuing his argument in his tone of light-hearted conviction , " if I do n't go anywhere for pain -- which would be a perversion of the intention of my being , and a monstrous thing to do -- why should I go anywhere to be the cause of pain ?
" Pretty witness , " he muttered , looking down into his glass .
Half-a-dozen have gone by within as many minutes .
In some few months less than another year , you know , I shall carry <NAME> off from school as Mrs. Edwin Drood .
Then the cake was cut , and passed through the ring ; the young ladies saved pieces to put under their pillows to dream of their future husbands on ; and a great deal of blushing and merriment was thereby occasioned .
' What course for me then ?
He is a stoutly built , steady-looking , sharp-eyed man in black , of about the middle-age .
" That 's the thing , sir , " repeated <NAME> with the greatest enthusiasm .
<NAME> , or <NAME> as the reader pleases , punctually followed the directions he had received , which -- <NAME> being pretty well acquainted with the locality -- were so exact that he was enabled to gain the magisterial presence without asking any question , or meeting with any interruption by the way .
<NAME> , ' said the father , passing his pocket-handkerchief several times across his face , and then grasping it convulsively in the hand that dropped across his knee , ' I have done what I could to keep you select here ; I have done what I could to retain you a position here .
I believe it. " " But , do not believe , " said <NAME> , upon whose ear the mournful voice struck with a reproachful sound , " that if my fortune were so cast as that , being one day so happy as to make her my wife , I must at any time put any separation between her and you , I could or would breathe a word of what I now say .
How ' s that ? ' ' I don ' t want to deceive you .
Under existing circumstances , there is no place like a great city when you are once in it .
Then , that is why it makes me wretched. " Now , if I could have believed that she favored <NAME> with any idea of making me -- me -- wretched , I should have been in better heart about it ; but in that habitual way of hers , she put me so entirely out of the question , that I could believe nothing of the kind .
' There is nothing else in all the world , ' she said , ' that would have wrung denial from me .
<NAME> smiled , as he said to <NAME> , ' You see , my experience of these things does not begin with myself .
When I said to him that I hoped Mrs. <NAME> and <NAME> were well , he answered respectfully ( and of course respectably ) , that they were tolerably well , he thanked me , and had sent their compliments .
No , to be sure , ' he added quickly , in anticipation of what the old man was going to say , ' there ' s not much business doing there , I know ; but you can make him clean the place out , polish up the instruments ; drudge , Mr Gills .
The cell-door has been closed too long on all its hopes and cares .
What of it ? ' ' When do you think he ever told her that before ?
About the time of twilight , Mr Dombey , grievously afflicted with aches and pains , was helped into his carriage , and propped with cloaks and pillows on one side of it , while his confidential agent bore him company upon the other .
The corner has been mentioned as a wonderful corner for echoes ; it had begun to echo so resoundingly to the tread of coming feet , that it seemed as though the very mention of that weary pacing to and fro had set it going .
Thus <NAME> in the morning , and it buried <NAME> still many fathoms deeper than he had been buried in the night .
And now , old chap , " said <NAME> , conveying to me a sensation , first of burning and then of freezing , for I felt as if that familiar expression were applied to <NAME> , -- " and now , old chap , may we do our duty !
' Now , are you a-comin ' ? ' ' Vait a minit , <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> , who , having tied his shawl with the aid of a small glass that hung in the window , was now , by dint of the most wonderful exertions , struggling into his upper garments .
' I would far rather not see Mr Clennam. ' ' Oh , fie , fie , my dear , that ' s folly .
My Lady , as on that day , sits before the fire with her screen in her hand .
' You needn ' t , if you don ' t like , ma ' am , ' was his answer .
And yet as I sit at work , I smell miles of flowers .
' I could not have done it , but for the fortune in the waterproof belt round my body .
I 'll point her out at the proper time , ' said <NAME> .
" Why do you write in the public streets ?
<NAME> , leaning back in his wooden arm-chair with his arms folded on his breast , looked at him lying with his right hand clenched in his sleep and his teeth set , until a film came over his own sight , and he slept too .
" I knew this person by sight very well , " says he .
And there really was a churchyard outside under some cloisters , for I saw the gravestones from the staircase window .
Every benevolent inhabitant of this retreat had his name inscribed upon his stomach .
Whenever Mr <NAME> turned his eyes to that side of the road , he still saw <NAME> holding his course , apparently without distress , and working himself along by the elbows after the most approved manner of professional gentlemen who get over the ground for wagers .
' Hurrah ! ' echoed <NAME> , taking off his hat and dashing it on the floor , and insanely casting his spectacles into the middle of the kitchen .
Of there being a breakfast , with abundance of things , pretty and substantial , to eat and drink , whereof I partake , as I should do in any other dream , without the least perception of their flavour ; eating and drinking , as I may say , nothing but love and marriage , and no more believing in the viands than in anything else .
' Come , boy , come -- ' and so submitted to be led away .
I am confident he wants strength of purpose .
These are all yawning , for no crumb of amusement ever falls from <NAME> and <NAME> ( the cause in hand ) , which was squeezed dry years upon years ago .
I begin to think he ' ll never wake , ' observed <NAME> .
On which occasion , ' added <NAME> , quitting her nest , and putting something in <NAME> ' s hand , ' Miss Dorrit will permit me to say <NAME> with best wishes in my own dull manner. ' The sisters rose at the same time , and they all stood near the cage of the parrot , as he tore at a claw-full of biscuit and spat it out , seemed to mock them with a pompous dance of his body without moving his feet , and suddenly turned himself upside down and trailed himself all over the outside of his golden cage , with the aid of his cruel beak and black tongue .
' In this house , in the presence of <NAME> and Mrs. Crummles , who have brought up a talented and virtuous family , to be blessings and phenomenons , and what not , are we to hear talk of nooses ? ' ' Folair , ' said <NAME> , deeming it a matter of decency to be affected by this allusion to himself and partner , ' I ' m astonished at you. ' ' What are you going on in this way at me for ? ' urged the unfortunate actor .
<NAME> requests <NAME> not to neglect making an appointment , as he has invited two or three professional friends to witness the ceremony , and can not disappoint them upon any account whatever .
' I suppose he will be back soon , ' he replied ; ' he has cut out and left me expecting him back , in an odd way .
Hearing that his examination ( as he called it ) was now over , <NAME> left the room with a radiant face to fetch his daughters ( his sons had run away at various times ) , leaving my guardian quite delighted by the manner in which he had vindicated his childish character .
Go ahead you , and keep out in pretty open water , that I mayn ' t get fouled again. ' His directions were obeyed , and they pulled ashore directly ; two in one boat , two in the other .
The projects with which she beguiled her illness , for little <NAME> 's education , and little <NAME> 's marriage , and even for her own old age as the grandmother of little <NAME> 's little Esthers , was so prettily expressive of devotion to this pride of her life that I should be tempted to recall some of them but for the timely remembrance that I am getting on irregularly as it is .
asked <NAME> with his hand to his ear .
Whether there was anything in the peculiar slyness of her action which fascinated Mr Quilp , or anything in the expression of her features at the moment which attracted his attention for some other reason ; or whether it merely occurred to him as a pleasant whim to stare the small servant out of countenance ; certain it is , that he planted his elbows square and firmly on the desk , and squeezing up his cheeks with his hands , looked at her fixedly .
They walked all day , and slept that night at a small cottage where beds were let to travellers .
If he could see the least sparkle of relief in her face now ?
On one side of the house was a little stable , just the size for the pony , with a little room over it , just the size for <NAME> .
He spoke <NAME> perfectly well , though he had not begun to learn the language , he told me , until he was a young man grown .
The demoniacal passion of this Neville Landless , his strength in his fury , and his savage rage for the destruction of its object , appal me .
The heavy pillars which support the roof engender masses of black shade , but between them there are lanes of light .
All that she saw was new and wonderful , but it was not real ; it seemed to her as if those visions of mountains and picturesque countries might melt away at any moment , and the carriage , turning some abrupt corner , bring up with a jolt at the old Marshalsea gate .
He started , made a short run , and stopped and looked over his shoulder .
To <NAME> , a hop-grower. ' I am terribly dejected for about a week or two .
But I know that when I saw her turn round , in the grave light of the old staircase , and wait for us , above , I thought of that window ; and I associated something of its tranquil brightness with <NAME> ever afterwards .
<NAME> pretended for a little while to be busily looking among the papers .
Now I am going to tell you all I can about them , because I know that is what you most want to hear .
But he had so high a sense of his hospitable and responsible position as our entertainer , and my guardian laughed so sincerely at and with <NAME> , as a child who blew bubbles and broke them all day long , that matters never went beyond this point .
To them I wish to add the money as she come away with .
' We have a good many of them ; that boy ' s one. ' ' Him in the next box ? ' said <NAME> .
' Hush ! ' he said , in a low voice .
A minute might have been consumed in the ascertaining of these points , when <NAME> , who , from her seat in the carriage , commanded the long narrow passage leading to the Lodge , flushed indignantly .
I hope everybody here will lead them to believe that I died defying them , consistently and perseveringly , as I did through so many years . "
" How many did they say ? " " I do not understand you. " " -- At the last post .
' You are very kind , ' said Mrs. Nickleby , hesitating ; ' but -- ' ' There ' s not a but in the case , my dear Mrs. Nickleby , ' remonstrated Mr Pluck ; ' not such a word in the vocabulary .
Not so <NAME> , who , having listened to Mr Dombey with even a more emphatic attention than usual , and with a more expressive tendency of her head to one side , now leant across the table , and said to Mrs Chick softly : ' <NAME> ! ' ' My dear , ' said <NAME> .
" That is quite right , " said the lady , " <NAME> . "
After long and lonely spurring over dreary roads , they would come to a cluster of poor cottages , not steeped in darkness , but all glittering with lights , and would find the people , in a ghostly manner in the dead of the night , circling hand in hand round a shrivelled tree of <NAME> , or all drawn up together singing a <NAME> song .
Every one of 'em 's doing of it , from the time when I do n't get up , to the time when I do n't go to bed .

' Well , what is it ? ' ' <NAME> and <NAME> have taken Mrs. Bardell in execution for her costs , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
' I have often said I would , ' she remarked , in a threatening manner , to herself , that morning , with many twitches of her head , ' and now I will ! ' Spurring herself on to the accomplishment of this desperate design , with a sharpness that was peculiar to herself , <NAME> haunted the hall and staircase during the whole forenoon , without finding a favourable opportunity for the assault .
I should be dead in a week .
' The agent at <NAME> said he had been obliged to you many times when you were in business , and he would be glad to take him on your recommendation. ' ' That ' s well , ' said <NAME> .
'All I know is , ' said <NAME> , at last : sitting down with a kind of desperate calmness , 'that we must try and carry it off with a bold face .
' <NAME> ' t take it to heart , ' said <NAME> ; ' it ' s of no consequence ; you see I don ' t care about it ; you followed the wrong person , that ' s all. ' That <NAME> all .
The <NAME> gazed upon him mildly .
He married his second wife privately , because he was proud , and in course of time she died .
I am aware , sir , that it would not become me to carry on my little traffic under the windows of your mansion .
I can not resist your prayer .
<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> got into the bin ; <NAME> ascended to his perch , and deposited his feet on a floor-clothed shelf , erected beneath it for that purpose .
' The quick eye of affection is not easily blinded , when of the female sex .
But I think it must have been by something more than chance , for that child -- You remember the bills upon the walls at home ? ' ' Confound the bills upon the walls at home !

What will he like him to be called ?
That ' s what _I_ call education. ' ' I think your good sense will perceive , ' <NAME> remonstrated in all humility , ' that whatever the merits of such a system may be , it would be difficult of general application to girls. ' ' I don ' t see it at all , sir , ' returned the obstinate <NAME> .
How many sich birds are perpetually moulting , and putting their beaks through the wires to peck at all mankind ! ' This poetic figure , which <NAME> took to be in a special allusion to his own checked waistcoat , quite overcame him ; Mr <NAME> ' s voice and manner added not a little to its effect , for he discoursed with all the mild austerity of a hermit , and wanted but a cord round the waist of his rusty surtout , and a skull on the chimney-piece , to be completely set up in that line of business .
If I could be at all useful in a pecuniary point of view , I should glide into the silent tomb with ease and smoothness. ' Mr <NAME> said no more , but slipped out quietly and shut the door upon himself , to cut the <NAME> off from any reply .
If it had n't been for the girl , I might have died . '

In our own country , where it has not , until within these later days , been a very popular fashion with governments to display any extraordinary regard for the great mass of the people or to recognise their existence as improvable creatures , private charities , unexampled in the history of the earth , have arisen , to do an incalculable amount of good among the destitute and afflicted .
' But two could play at your game , ' said <NAME> , snapping his fingers at him half a dozen times , ' and I played it long ago ; long afore you tried your clumsy hand at it ; in days when you hadn ' t begun croaking your lecters or what not in your school .
The world , however , was not in fault in <NAME> ' s case .
The trooper yielding to this invitation , he and <NAME> , not to embarrass the domestic preparations , go forth to take a turn up and down the little street , which they promenade with measured tread and folded arms , as if it were a rampart .

When we were seated in the little ferry-boat , and were crossing the swollen river immediately before both cataracts , I began to feel what it was : but I was in a manner stunned , and unable to comprehend the vastness of the scene .

' If I hadn ' t a family , and that family hadn ' t the cowpock , ' said the waiter , ' I wouldn ' t take a sixpence .

The room was very dark , too dark to be observed with any accuracy , though <NAME> glanced round it in obedience to a secret impulse , anxious to know what kind of room it was .
Seeing that the happiness her mind could realise was all shining upon him , <NAME> kept that single figure before her ; and so they rode brightly through the poor streets in the prison neighbourhood to carry him the great news .
' Not they , sir , ' replied <NAME> , touching his hat .
Her ladyship , my <NAME> , coming in one day when I was alone , and at the height of feeling that I could support it no longer , I told her I must go .
" Why do n't you answer -- " " Pip , " returned <NAME> , cutting me short as if he were hurt , " which I meantersay that were not a question requiring a answer betwixt yourself and me , and which you know the answer to be full well No .
' Now there , ' said Mr Meagles softly , as he gave a turn to the dumb-waiter on his right hand to twirl the sugar towards himself .

" I am not at all surprised to hear it . "
<NAME> , the very possibility of contradiction or disproof , however remote , communicates to this feminine judgment from the first , in nine cases out of ten , the weakness attendant on the testimony of an interested witness ; so personally and strongly does the fair diviner connect herself with her divination .

It ' s my leg , it ' s my leg .
It is certain that the more reduced and necessitous they were , the more pompously the skeleton emerged from its tomb ; and that when there was anything particularly shabby in the wind , the skeleton always came out with the ghastliest flourish .
That , here he had a plan of action to recommend , with a conditional clause .
The place was intolerably dirty , and the smell of tobacco smoke perfectly suffocating .
Mr Headstone comes and confides in me , in a very delicate way , and says , " I hope my marrying your sister would be agreeable to you , <NAME> , and useful to you ? " I say , " There ' s nothing in the world , Mr Headstone , that I could be better pleased with. " Mr Headstone says , " Then I may rely upon your intimate knowledge of me for your good word with your sister , <NAME> ? " And I say , " Certainly , Mr Headstone , and naturally I have a good deal of influence with her. " So I have ; haven ' t I , <NAME> ? ' ' Yes , Charley. ' ' <NAME> said !
I must settle this before I sleep .
As it was of no use going on in that way , I put the paper down , took a peep at my bonnet in the glass to see if it was neat , and looked at the room , which was not half lighted , and at the shabby , dusty tables , and at the piles of writings , and at a bookcase full of the most inexpressive-looking books that ever had anything to say for themselves .
He raised his voice and called ' Eugene !
While he trotted back with the message he was to deliver to the night watchman in his box at the door of <NAME> 's <NAME> , by <NAME> , who was to deliver it to greater authorities within , the shadows of the night took such shapes to him as arose out of the message , and took such shapes to the mare as arose out of _her_ private topics of uneasiness .

' It was all right. ' Again I answered , ' Oh ! ' ' You know who was willin ' , ' said my friend .
Where do you think of going , <NAME> ? ' ' I shall go back to the factory , ' said <NAME> .
Not unless he gets out , I wo n't ! "
'Nor heard anything about him ? '

The dinner was as remarkable for the splendour and completeness of its appointments as the mansion itself , and the company were remarkable for doing it ample justice , in which respect <NAME> and <NAME> particularly signalised themselves ; these two gentlemen eating of every dish , and drinking of every bottle , with a capacity and perseverance truly astonishing .
' There is a furnished little set of chambers to be let in the <NAME> , <NAME> , which ought to suit you to a marvel.

Now , gentlemen. ' As the three went out together , and <NAME> slouched off from under the trembling lamp his separate way , <NAME> asked the officer what he thought of this ?
<NAME> <NAME> begged her to take his arm ; and as they moved on very slowly , asked her how the robbery had been committed .
As the elder <NAME> insisted on selling out his portion forthwith , they proceeded from the bank to the gate of the <NAME> , to which <NAME> , <NAME> , after a short absence , returned with a cheque on <NAME> , <NAME> , & <NAME> , for five hundred and thirty pounds ; that being the money to which <NAME> , at the market price of the day , was entitled , in consideration of the balance of the second Mrs. <NAME> ' s funded savings .
What could I do t ' hinder her ?
' You see , ' said <NAME> , ' it ' s sure to go , on such an occasion , and even if it should not work up quite as well as we expect , why it will be her risk , you know , and not ours. ' ' Yours , you mean , ' said <NAME> .
Have you seen that ? ' ' Ah !
But she is proud , is she not ? "
" But would you allow me the favour of a minute 's private conversation ? "
He 'd set upon a post at a street corner eight or ten hours at a stretch if he undertook to do it . "
I have no time to waste . "
Some of them were most ferocious-looking ruffians , who stared at me as I went by ; and stopped , perhaps , and called after me to come back and speak to them , and when I took to my heels , stoned me .
<NAME> ' t forget to apply it , another time , <NAME> Anne. ' This said , <NAME> finished the watering of her flowers , and went into her little official residence , and took a refresher of the principal rivers and mountains of the world , their breadths , depths , and heights , before settling the measurements of the body of a dress for her own personal occupation .
' Drive slowly anywhere , ' Mrs <NAME> called to her coachman , ' and don ' t let the carriage rattle. ' ' It MUST be more dropping down , I think , ' said Mr Boffin to himself .
I think it came on " for further directions " -- about some bill of costs , to the best of my understanding , which was confused enough .
Separating these , the board and trestles became a counter , the basket supplied the few small lots of fruit and sweets that he offered for sale upon it and became a foot-warmer , the unfolded clothes-horse displayed a choice collection of halfpenny ballads and became a screen , and the stool planted within it became his post for the rest of the day .
She was toiling up the great , wide , vacant staircase , with him in her arms ; his head was lying on her shoulder , one of his arms thrown negligently round her neck .
With some incoherent half-formed thought to that effect , he turned under the blows that were blinding him and mashing his life , and closed with a murderer , whom he caught by a red neckerchief -- unless the raining down of his own blood gave it that hue .
She was very fond of me -- made me this waistcoat , Tom. " ' " Did she ? " said <NAME> .
No trees were to be seen , nor any vegetable growth save a poor brown scrubby moss , freezing in the chinks of rock .
" And then I said <NAME> was thinning fast ; and so it was , my dear . "
As the old woman , with a gigantic and distorted image of herself thrown half upon the wall behind her , half upon the roof above , sat bending over the few loose bricks within which it was pent , on the damp hearth of the chimney -- for there was no stove -- she looked as if she were watching at some witch ' s altar for a favourable token ; and but that the movement of her chattering jaws and trembling chin was too frequent and too fast for the slow flickering of the fire , it would have seemed an illusion wrought by the light , as it came and went , upon a face as motionless as the form to which it belonged .
' Pay five shillings for you indeed ! ' <NAME> proceeded ; ' how many hours do you suppose it costs me to earn five shillings , you infamous boy ? -- <NAME> ' t cry like that , or I ' ll throw a doll at you .
I labour under the same kind of astonishment to this day , having invariably observed that of all human weaknesses , the one to which our common nature is the least disposed to confess ( I can not imagine why ) is the weakness of having gone to sleep in a coach .
' Yes , ' said the child , hesitating whether to enter or retreat , for the dwarf just roused , with his dishevelled hair hanging all about him and a yellow handkerchief over his head , was something fearful to behold ; it ' s only me , sir. ' ' Come in , ' said <NAME> , without getting off the desk .
We made no more provision for growing older , than we did for growing younger .
Let ' s get the scaffolding up , then , for a pair of whiskers .
It is much better as it is ! ' Agnes is downstairs , when I go into the parlour ; and I give her the message .
That night -- it was the fourteenth of August -- he sat up late , and wrote two fervent letters ; one was to <NAME> , explaining the strong obligation he was under to go to <NAME> , and showing her , at length , the reasons that he had , for feeling confident that he could become involved in no personal danger there ; the other was to the <NAME> , confiding <NAME> and their dear child to his care , and dwelling on the same topics with the strongest assurances .
What does he do that for ?
After looking from <NAME> to <NAME> , and from <NAME> to Job in profound silence , he softly ejaculated the words , ' Well , I _am_ damn ' d ! ' which he repeated at least a score of times ; after which exertion , he appeared wholly bereft of speech , and again cast his eyes , first upon the one and then upon the other , in mute perplexity and bewilderment .
<NAME> has , on several occasions , to the best of my knowledge , information , and belief , systematically forged , to various entries , books , and documents , the signature of <NAME> ; and has distinctly done so in one instance , capable of proof by me .
The look and the action had occupied but an instant .
When I do not enjoy the pleasures of the chase , for anything I know he watches at the <NAME> all night. ' ' This is an extraordinary story , ' observed <NAME> , who had heard it out with serious attention .
'And us come to bring him all these beau-ti-ful things . '
'In this very room -- in this very bed -- I once nursed a pretty young creetur ' , that was brought into the house with her feet cut and bruised with walking , and all soiled with dust and blood .
Cries in exaltation of the well-known good physician rent the hall .
Here the friends , for a short time , separated .
If he has a friend here , he will save him the disgrace of the paltry attempt to conceal his name -- and utterly useless one -- for I will find it out , nor leave him until I have. ' <NAME> looked at him contemptuously , and , addressing his companions , said -- ' Let the fellow talk , I have nothing serious to say to boys of his station ; and his pretty sister shall save him a broken head , if he talks till midnight. ' ' You are a base and spiritless scoundrel ! ' said <NAME> , ' and shall be proclaimed so to the world .
' Halloa ! ' he stammered ; ' I didn ' t know you were here. ' ' Whose name , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , putting his hand upon his shoulder and turning him , so that they all three walked towards the house together , ' have you been carving on the trees ? ' ' Whose name ? ' returned <NAME> .
Leaving him in the hall for a moment , shrunk into the corner of the window-seat and staring with an indifference that scarcely could be called wonder at the comfort and brightness about him , I went into the drawing-room to speak to my guardian .
It was not that he was embarrassed , as on that first night with the <NAME> family ; he was habitually unembarrassed now , and yet the something remained .
Or they would come running out into the balcony ; and then <NAME> would hide herself quickly , lest it should check them in their joy , to see her in her black dress , sitting there alone .
Sit down on this chair , close beside me !
Oh , no , I do n't think so !
Mrs Plornish ' s father , -- a poor little reedy piping old gentleman , like a worn-out bird ; who had been in what he called the music-binding business , and met with great misfortunes , and who had seldom been able to make his way , or to see it or to pay it , or to do anything at all with it but find it no thoroughfare , -- had retired of his own accord to the <NAME> which was appointed by law to be the <NAME> of his district ( without the twopence , which was bad political economy ) , on the settlement of that execution which had carried Mr Plornish to the <NAME> .
<NAME> is an honest man. ' ' I am so sure of it that I have promptly made up my mind to speak to you. ' ' You must guide him , you know ; you must steer him ; you must direct him ; he is one of a crotchety sort , ' said Mr Meagles , evidently meaning nothing more than that he did new things and went new ways ; ' but he is as honest as the sun , and so good night ! ' <NAME> went back to his room , sat down again before his fire , and made up his mind that he was glad he had resolved not to fall in love with <NAME> .
'That 's just what it was ! '
' It ' s light enough for me , ' said Mr Merdle .
Mrs. <NAME> was very glad to see me , and said that he had gone away with one of his <NAME> friends to see another who lived near <NAME> , but that she expected him to return tomorrow .
Why is it ? ' said <NAME> , ' Won ' t you tell me ? ' For <NAME> was shaking her head .
The week had gone round to the Saturday following that beating of my heart in the church ; and every day had been so bright and blue that to ramble in the woods , and to see the light striking down among the transparent leaves and sparkling in the beautiful interlacings of the shadows of the trees , while the birds poured out their songs and the air was drowsy with the hum of insects , had been most delightful .
Oh ! ' cried the little creature , holding out her hand and looking upward , ' how they sing ! ' There was something in the face and action for the moment , quite inspired and beautiful .
So we were left to take leave of one another without any restraint .
Many persons who are not members of the <NAME> , avail themselves , I believe , of these institutions , and of the advantageous opportunities they afford for the education of their children .
He had been in that place six nights a week for many years , but had never been observed to raise his eyes above his music-book , and was confidently believed to have never seen a play .
' I wanted to have a little bit o ' conwersation with you , sir , ' said <NAME> , ' if you could spare me five minits or so , sir. ' ' Certainly , ' replied <NAME> .
It was a great exertion for <NAME> , and nobody knows to this day how he ever came to make it , the other party being wholly unknown to him , but he drew a long breath and actually said , out loud , without once stopping , that if the young gentleman did not object to tell , he should like to know what his uncle was going to do for him .
' My mother lives in a most primitive manner down in that dreary red-brick dungeon at <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
' That is the principal , I may say the only difficulty , my dear <NAME> , ' assented his wife .
I have had some slight correspondence with your former friend , sir , ' addressing me , ' but it has not restored his sense of duty or natural obligation .
If you have a suspicion in your own breast , keep that suspicion in your own breast .
He had undergone the ordinary transitions from the height of conviviality to the depth of misery , and from the depth of misery to the height of conviviality .
Your good opinion is a consolation to me .
The thunder was rolling into distance , and the rain was pouring down like a deluge , when the door of his room opened .
He has a great liking for Mrs. Rouncewell ; he says she is a most respectable , creditable woman .
She remonstrates , laughing , and is a childish schoolgirl again .
While Mr Quilp , in his uproarious hospitality , seated himself upon an empty beer-barrel , vaunted the place as the most beautiful and comfortable in the three kingdoms , and elevating his glass , drank to their next merry-meeting in that jovial spot ; and Mr <NAME> , with the rain plashing down into his tea-cup , made a dismal attempt to pluck up his spirits and appear at his ease ; and <NAME> , who was in waiting at the door under an old umbrella , exulted in his agonies , and bade fair to split his sides with laughing ; while all this was passing , <NAME> , unmindful of the wet which dripped down upon her own feminine person and fair apparel , sat placidly behind the tea-board , erect and grizzly , contemplating the unhappiness of her brother with a mind at ease , and content , in her amiable disregard of self , to sit there all night , witnessing the torments which his avaricious and grovelling nature compelled him to endure and forbade him to resent .
I am ashamed to have brought Mr Headstone with me .
This was not a cheering preparation for my visit , and I could have dispensed with the company of <NAME> , when <NAME> ( who arrived within a minute or two after me ) brought him to share our dinner .
The howl and roar , the rattling of the doors and windows , the rumbling in the chimneys , the apparent rocking of the very house that sheltered me , and the prodigious tumult of the sea , were more fearful than in the morning .
<NAME> see to it yourself .
You can say I am coming . '
' If you only knew how I have loved that man -- ' <NAME> ' t distress yourself by recollecting it , ma ' am , ' said the bodyguard .
<NAME> <NAME> picked up his hat , and having turned it over with a look of interest and welcome , began to polish it on his sleeve .
' <NAME> , ' he said , ' I know , and knew before to-day , that I have found no favour with you ; and I knew why .
' I have been lingering here these two hours .
<NAME> <NAME> was fast asleep in bed , when his early visitor , followed by <NAME> , entered the room .
Such a thought never came into my head !
His visitor observed the look , and proceeded .
There are powdered heads from time to time in the little windows of the hall , looking out at the untaxed powder falling all day from the sky ; and in the same conservatory there is peach blossom turning itself exotically to the great hall fire from the nipping weather out of doors .
There were few buildings then , north of the Oxford-road , and forest-trees flourished , and wild flowers grew , and the hawthorn blossomed , in the now vanished fields .
Can be and shall be , on your own terms , ' returned my aunt , ' if you say the word .
It very soon became unnecessary to tell <NAME> what to look for , and an understanding was established between her and Mr Boffin that she was always to look for <NAME> .
' And you shall keep guard on your mistress aloft. ' Diogenes , however , although he had been eyeing his intended breakfast with a watering mouth and glistening eyes , instead of falling to , ravenously , when it was put before him , pricked up his ears , darted to the shop-door , and barked there furiously : burrowing with his head at the bottom , as if he were bent on mining his way out .
After hesitating a little , the figure turned back , and , advancing with an air of gentleness and compassion , said : ' <NAME> me , young woman , for speaking to you , but you are under some distress of mind .
The world did put it about , that she admired my style .
My lot has been so blest that I can relate little of myself which is not a story of goodness and generosity in others .
' My dear <NAME> , ' said Mr Morfin , after a silence , ' I was not prepared for this .
attention to <NAME> , mama , ' rejoined <NAME> quickly -- ' oh yes. ' ' Dear me , <NAME> , ' retorted Mrs. Nickleby , ' what an extraordinary girl you are !
We proceeded by appointment straight to <NAME> ' s house ; where , and at <NAME> ' s , my friend had been labouring ever since our explosive meeting .
Oh , the strong eyes , and the weak frame !
' <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> ! ' ' <NAME> , him , him ? ' repeated <NAME> ; staring about , as if for Him .
They looked at <NAME> ' s worn face , rendered more pathetic by the homely emotions it evinced ; and , in the kindness of their nature , they were more sorry than indignant .
<NAME> 's sleeping-room was all flowers -- in chintz and paper , in velvet , in needlework , in the brocade of two stiff courtly chairs which stood , each attended by a little page of a stool for greater state , on either side of the fire-place .
If her uncle was turned out of house and home , and forced to lay down in a dyke , <NAME> ' r <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , with no less pride than before , ' it ' s my belief she ' d go along with him , now !
We would beg to call particular attention to the monosyllable at the end of the second and fourth lines , which not only enables the singer to take breath at those points , but greatly assists the metre .
<NAME> taught him even that much ; he found it out .
That ' s the worst of you .
and not my <NAME> gentleman ?
' He has feigned it often enough to me , of late , ' said <NAME> .
' I think , my dear , ' said the <NAME> , ' I ' ll at once get rid of <NAME> for the night , because he ' s coming to inhabit the <NAME> , and it might be put into his head or somebody else ' s , if he heard this and it got about that the house is haunted .
I dare say it would not be anything like as disagreeable as one supposes. ' <NAME> had made the suggestion , thinking that the duty might possibly fall within <NAME> ' s department .
' You saucy baggage ! ' retorted <NAME> , rattling at the handle of the door .
<NAME> man of the name of <NAME> !
Take it away ! ' As with a set purpose of implying a misgiving that if nourished upon similar meats , she might come to be like that charmer , which would be a fatal consummation .
' What do you say to THAT ? ' Pa answered quietly with the counter-question , ' What did YOU say to that , my love ? ' ' I said <NAME> , ' returned <NAME> sharply .
He had a tree on his right , a tree on his left , a third before him , and a fourth behind .
I sat looking at her as she cast her eyes down on her work ; I sat seeming still to listen to her ; and <NAME> , in spite of all my attachment to him , darkened in that tone .
It is his humour too , to say that he does not look forward to going out ; that he is not glad the time is drawing near ; that he did look forward to it once , but that was very long ago ; that he has lost all care for everything .
The possibility of my being brought into contact with my mother , of my being taken to her house , even of <NAME> 's , however distantly associated with me , receiving kindnesses and obligations from her husband , was so painful that I felt I could no longer guide myself without his assistance .
I came down again to my dinner ; and even the slow comfort of the meal , and the orderly silence of the place -- which was bare of guests , the <NAME> not yet being over -- were eloquent on the audacity of <NAME> , and his small hopes of a livelihood for twenty years to come .
That , rather late in the evening <NAME> gave us <NAME> 's ode , and threw his bloodstained sword in thunder down , with such effect , that a waiter came in and said , " The <NAME> underneath sent up their compliments , and it was n't the <NAME> ' Arms. " That , they were all in excellent spirits on the road home , and sang , <NAME> !
and she prayed to <NAME> , this lady did , ' said <NAME> , affecting herself beyond measure ; being heartily in earnest , ' to teach her little daughter to be sure of that in her heart : and to know that she was happy there and loved her still : and to hope and try -- Oh , all her life -- to meet her there one day , never , never , never to part any more. ' ' It was my Mama ! ' exclaimed the child , springing up , and clasping her round the neck .
On the same occasion I tell you that I am the idlest and least of lawyers , but that I am better than none , in a case I have noted down with my own hand , and that you may be always sure of my best help , and incidentally of <NAME> ' s too , in your efforts to clear your father .
Through the ragged window-curtain , the light of early day steals in from a miserable court .
You 'd better bring the boy here to-morrow night .
I always knew the real worth of such characters as yours !
We all said he had the <NAME> ' s luck and his own , and as it was the kind of night for the Devil to be out and busy , I suppose he was looking over his shoulder , if anybody could have seen him. ' ' Ah ! ' returned the gruff voice ; ' for all old <NAME> ' s winning through thick and thin of late years , I remember the time when he was the unluckiest and unfortunatest of men .
Call it at the outside a week .
This caused me to feel that I ought to tell her , and <NAME> too , that I was going to be the mistress of <NAME> and that if I avoided that disclosure any longer I might become less worthy in my own eyes of its master 's love .
' Very well , my dear Sir , very well , ' said <NAME> .
I could sing to him , and talk to him , and show the ardour that I felt in all he did , and attain with labour to such knowledge as most interested him ; and I attracted him .
' I says , at first , " This is illusion " ; and was composing myself off to sleep , when I heerd the noise again , distinct . '
I ' d ha ' licked a doozen such as him when I was yoong as thee .
A bitter sleet came rattling against us here on the east wind , and <NAME> took me on his back .
But , ' she said , looking hastily round , 'this fear comes over me again .
In case you choose to leave it here , I can do this for you -- I can replace this matter on its old footing , and I can go so far besides as to give you a written undertaking that this man <NAME> shall never be troubled in any way until you have been proceeded against to the utmost , that your means shall be exhausted before the creditor looks to his .
" 'Gentlemen , ' I returned , ' I am that Doctor Manette of whom you speak so graciously . '
Whatever were <NAME> 's intentions , however ( and no doubt they were of the best ) : it unfortunately happened , as has been twice before remarked , that the table was a round one ; consequently <NAME> , moving his chair by little and little , soon began to diminish the distance between himself and the matron ; and , continuing to travel round the outer edge of the circle , brought his chair , in time , close to that in which the matron was seated .
" I wish to hear it at the window , then .
A gentleman lounging , full dressed , on a sofa , with an opera-glass in his hand , passed before my view , and also my own figure at full length in a glass .
But you never have condescended to me , as much as I could have wished .
Then will you set about it at once , blacksmith ? " said the off-hand sergeant , " as it 's on his <NAME> 's service .
It may be that I shall yet stand your friend , if you deserve it , and repent in action -- not in words .
I know that to anyone but myself -- to you , who consider the immeasurable distance between me and this young lady , who is now your ward , and the object of your peculiar care -- my loving her , even in thought , must appear the height of rashness and presumption .
<NAME> ' t you remember it ? ' ' Why , I THOUGHT I remembered it , my dear ! ' ' You should , for you bought it , Pa. ' ' Yes , I THOUGHT I bought it my dear ! ' said the cherub , giving himself a little shake , as if to rouse his faculties .
She has found it necessary to make a journey -- I trust will shortly return .
It is not in tameness of spirit that I submit .
' <NAME> , We say , ' returned Mr Podsnap , in a condescending manner .
' A good , contented , well-breakfasted juryman is a capital thing to get hold of .
And never believe , dear dear <NAME> , never believe that I forget this night or that while my heart beats it can be insensible to the pride and joy of having been beloved by you . "
' And , dear Mr Clennam , ' said <NAME> , ' because papa and one whom I need not name , do not fully appreciate and understand one another yet , as they will by-and-by ; and because it will be the duty , and the pride , and pleasure of my new life , to draw them to a better knowledge of one another , and to be a happiness to one another , and to be proud of one another , and to love one another , both loving me so dearly ; oh , as you are a kind , true man !
Where does that responsibility rest ?
I must put something under the cushion for your head .
The smoke-serpents were indifferent who was lost or found , who turned out bad or good ; the melancholy mad elephants , like the <NAME> men , abated nothing of their set routine , whatever happened .
He had another reason for this .
If you do , well and good .
But , there was nothing there .
<NAME> <NAME> , habited in his morning jacket , with the black calico sleeves , was returning in a rather desponding state from an unsuccessful survey of the mysterious house with the green gate , when , raising his eyes , he beheld a crowd pouring down the street , surrounding an object which had very much the appearance of a sedan-chair .
There were friends who seemed to be always coming and going across the <NAME> , on errands about the <NAME> , and <NAME> and <NAME> and <NAME> and <NAME> and par and premium and discount and three quarters and seven eighths .
The business , the stock , this house , and everything in it , all belong to <NAME> Knag. ' ' That ' s quite true , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , with whom her late employer had secretly come to an amicable understanding on this point .
Therefore it is , <NAME> , that I consider the platform a sufficiently bad example and a sufficiently bad school , even in public life ; but hold that , carried into private life , it becomes an unendurable nuisance. ' ' These are strong words , sir ! ' exclaimed the <NAME> .
Girded round its middle was an antique scabbard ; but no sword was in it , and the ancient sheath was eaten up with rust .
They listen , and hear his footsteps go back to the gate , and hear the gate close after him .
They were a goodly company , and the <NAME> all but worshipped them .
His coat , his waistcoat , his shoes and stockings , his trousers , his hat , his wit and humour , his pathos and his umbrella , all come before me like visions of my youth .
Firstly ( in a spirit of love ) , what is the common sort of <NAME> -- the working clothes -- the every-day wear , my young friends ?
Some dark specks in the snow , like knots upon a little thread , beginning at the convent door and winding away down the descent in broken lengths which were not yet pieced together , showed where the <NAME> were at work in several places clearing the track .
The night should have turned more wet since I came in , for he had a large sou ' wester hat on , slouched over his face .
Why , good gracious me , suppose the house was to be let !
He is on his last march , miss , and has a whim to see her .
Are you astonished ? " <NAME> , still drinking the punch , rejoined , " Why should I be astonished ? " " You approve ? " <NAME> , still drinking the punch , rejoined , " Why should I not approve ? " " Well ! " said his friend <NAME> , " you take it more easily than I fancied you would , and are less mercenary on my behalf than I thought you would be ; though , to be sure , you know well enough by this time that your ancient chum is a man of a pretty strong will .
I know you have never liked me , as I have liked you ! ' All this time he was squeezing my hand with his damp fishy fingers , while I made every effort I decently could to get it away .
" But it 's not my business ! " he would generally say at those times , and would briskly fall to his sawing again .
Would n't her child ? " " Yes , yes , thank God .
" And you 're doing well , Mr .
The officer turned suddenly from the path , and after climbing a paling , and scaling a hedge , entered a secluded field .
There -- see how this iron bar bends beneath my furious wrench .
' I must move rapidly , or I could not draw my breath .
It would also appear from the <NAME> hereof , that a Joke , even between <NAME> and <NAME> , may be sometimes carried too far There are some men who , living with the one object of enriching themselves , no matter by what means , and being perfectly conscious of the baseness and rascality of the means which they will use every day towards this end , affect nevertheless -- even to themselves -- a high tone of moral rectitude , and shake their heads and sigh over the depravity of the world .
There was the usual aspect of newness on every object , of course .
But <NAME> was not there to look on ; and <NAME> remained unrecognised , and sat staring at her fire , unobserved .
But you came to the right shop for mercy when you came to me , and thank your stars that it IS me as has got to serve you with the article. ' Anybody not in <NAME> ' s confidence would have supposed that he was quite out of the article in question , instead of having a large stock on hand ready for all comers ; nor would the opinion of sceptical persons have undergone much alteration when he followed up the remark by poking <NAME> in the chest with the ferrule of his umbrella , and dealing a smart shower of blows , with the ribs of the same instrument , upon his head and shoulders .
' I assure you , Mrs. <NAME> , ' he then said , much exhausted , ' that the father ' s manner prepared me for a grim and stony maturity .
But an elderly member of the Jewish persuasion , preserved in rum , followed them close , and looked in at the glass before Mr <NAME> had opened one of the day ' s letters .
' But hear this first -- hear this first , brother Ned , ' said the old man , hastily , placing two chairs , one on each side of Nicholas : ' I ' ll tell it you myself , brother Ned , because the young gentleman is modest , and is a scholar , <NAME> , and I shouldn ' t feel it right that he should tell us his story over and over again as if he was a beggar , or as if we doubted him .
Mr <NAME> , without being quite so hot upon the matter , was rather shamed by his friend ' s excitement , and not a little puzzled how to act ( Kit being quite cool and good-humoured ) , when the single gentleman was heard to call violently down the stairs .
But it would be a hard one to learn , and you have got beyond her , and it 's of no use now. " So , with a quiet sigh for me , <NAME> rose from the bank , and said , with a fresh and pleasant change of voice , " Shall we walk a little farther , or go home ? " " <NAME> , " I cried , getting up , putting my arm round her neck , and giving her a kiss , " I shall always tell you everything. " " Till you 're a gentleman , " said <NAME> .
For the better preservation of his cheerfulness therefore , and to prevent his faculties from rusting , he provided himself with a cribbage-board and pack of cards , and accustomed himself to play at cribbage with a dummy , for twenty , thirty , or sometimes even fifty thousand pounds aside , besides many hazardous bets to a considerable amount .
Not a single word did <NAME> speak .
What could I become with these surroundings ?
How came he to have fallen asleep , in his clothes , on the sofa in <NAME> <NAME> 's consulting-room , and to be debating these points outside the <NAME> 's bedroom door in the early morning ?
Upon this head , however , he had no cause for any anxiety , for the whole performance was applauded to the echo , and voluntary contributions were showered in with a liberality which testified yet more strongly to the general delight .
There were a large number of attorneys ' clerks to be sworn , and it being a moral impossibility to swear them all at once , the struggles of these gentlemen to reach the clerk in spectacles , were like those of a crowd to get in at the pit door of a theatre when <NAME> honours it with its presence .
<NAME> find the bad among us easily enough -- among what peoples are the bad not easily found ? -- but they take the worst of us as samples of the best ; they take the lowest of us as presentations of the highest ; and they say " All Jews are alike. " If , doing what I was content to do here , because I was grateful for the past and have small need of money now , I had been a <NAME> , I could have done it , compromising no one but my individual self .
' Kit , they call him. ' ' Kit , eh ! ' said <NAME> .
<NAME> ' t take on , ma ' am , and be sorry ! ' It became intolerable .
It comes when we remember nothing but clear skies , green fields , and sweet-smelling flowers -- when the recollection of snow , and ice , and bleak winds , has faded from our minds as completely as they have disappeared from the earth -- and yet what a pleasant time it is !
' I will not go in just yet , ' said <NAME> .
' My Wal ' r , as I used to call you !
Grasping the rail , he found that the coach had sunk greatly on one side , though it was still dragged forward by the horses ; and while -- confused by their plunging and the loud screams of the lady inside -- he hesitated , for an instant , whether to jump off or not , the vehicle turned easily over , and relieved him from all further uncertainty by flinging him into the road .
You 've been in low spirits this afternoon .
' My dear , ' retorted <NAME> , in a low voice : ' <NAME> , all over ! ' ' In-deed ! ' said <NAME> .
<NAME> forgive me. ' But for all he said , his eager eye scanned Mr <NAME> ' s downcast face none the less closely ; and then it shot a strange triumphant look at the picture , as appealing to it to bear witness how he led him on again , and what was coming .
They all dropped softly on the ground within the gate , and lay there a little -- listening perhaps .
This sounded so like a falsehood , that the old gentleman looked somewhat sternly in <NAME> 's face .
At length , quite unexpectedly , he said something in a whisper .
' He ' s no more a monster than you are , ' returned <NAME> .
If I have any merit it is consistency. ' The daughter had sat quite silent and still during this speech , with her eyes fixed on the ground ; her cousin standing near her , and looking on the ground too .
He wished to do anything as laid in his power to serve <NAME> , altogether putting himself out of sight ; and he hoped he did .
But I come up with ' em , and I crossed ' em .
Besides the melancholy boy , who , I hoped , had not been made so by waltzing alone in the empty kitchen , there were two other boys and one dirty little limp girl in a gauzy dress .
What alone was wanting to the realization of a vast fortune , he considered to be More Capital .
Devil a word , gentlemen , the chair would say .
The sun was low -- near setting -- and its light came redly in above , without descending to the ground .
' Ah ! ' said the dwarf , smacking his lips , ' what a nice kiss that was -- just upon the rosy part .
She was in a state of lawful innocence , so to speak .
And at last he flung out in his violent way , and said , with a D , 'Then do as you like . '
Now , take a rest , and then we ' ll talk again .
Often at posting-houses and other halting places , these miserable creatures would appear to her the only realities of the day ; and many a time , when the money she had brought to give them was all given away , she would sit with her folded hands , thoughtfully looking after some diminutive girl leading her grey father , as if the sight reminded her of something in the days that were gone .
Of my darling being almost smothered among the flowers , and coming out , laughing and crying both together , to my jealous arms .
The house in the city preserved its heavy dulness through all these transactions , and the invalid within it turned the same unvarying round of life .
' And whatever you do with your ink , I can ' t think , for you ' re as clean as a whistle after it .
By no means ! ' ' You may remember that the day I arrived in <NAME> , and found the house to which I drove , empty and deserted , I was directed by some of the neighbours to you , and waited upon you without stopping for rest or refreshment ? ' ' <NAME> precipitate that was , and yet what an earnest and vigorous measure ! ' said <NAME> , conferring with himself , in imitation of his friend Mr <NAME> .
He 'd find himself growing thin , if he did n't look sharp ! "
' More than that , you say , do you ? ' cried the other , pushing back his battered hat , and drawing his hand across his forehead .
Is this one like me , Mr Noggs ? ' This was a puzzling inquiry ; but <NAME> evaded it , by replying to Mr Lillyvick , that he thought the baby might possibly come like him in time .
They were not interchanging a word or a look .
Are you -- are you very poor ? ' ' I am but a wanderer , ' said <NAME> , ' making voyages to live , across the sea .
It was torturing to me to hear them talk of occurrences in which I had had no share .
' It ' s a load off my mind , <NAME> , to have such a partner. ' The red fox made him say all this , I knew , to exhibit him to me in the light he had indicated on the night when he poisoned my rest .
Every member of the respectable coterie appeared plunged in his own reflections ; not excepting the dog , who by a certain malicious licking of his lips seemed to be meditating an attack upon the legs of the first gentleman or lady he might encounter in the streets when he went out .
It was a strange figure -- like a child : yet not so like a child as like an old man , viewed through some supernatural medium , which gave him the appearance of having receded from the view , and being diminished to a child 's proportions .
Look at your boy : he _is_ your ' n , ai n't he ?
' Do you give lessons , ma ' am ? ' inquired <NAME> .
" How do they call you ? " " They call me Defarge. " " Of what trade ? " " Monsieur the <NAME> , vendor of wine. " " Pick up that , philosopher and vendor of wine , " said the <NAME> , throwing him another gold coin , " and spend it as you will .
There was watching enough , now , but it was the watching of strangers who made a greedy trade of it , and who , in the intervals in their attendance upon the sick man huddled together with a ghastly good-fellowship , and ate and drank and made merry ; for disease and death were their ordinary household gods .
She felt as though she would have been glad that it rang on until daylight ; but it ceased , and the circles of its last sound spread out fainter and wider in the air , and all was dead again .
We shall never understand each other. " " Such a mean brute , such a stupid brute ! " I urged , in despair .
Mr <NAME> did not increase in favour with the Father of the <NAME> in the ratio of his increasing visits .
There were no other passengers that night , but we four .
With all her deference for <NAME> as contradistinguished from his portrait , Mrs. <NAME> had not the smallest intention of interrupting the descent .
' Now , you know. ' ' Yes , <NAME> , ' said Mr Boffin , meekly .
Something or somebody had superseded him as a source of interest .
There were three rooms on a floor , and , the doors by which they communicated being put open that the air might pass freely through them all , <NAME> , smilingly observant of that fanciful resemblance which he detected all around him , walked from one to another .
One ought to be civil , you know. ' ' Dear mama , ' rejoined <NAME> , ' don ' t say a word to him , but let us run away as fast as we can , and shut ourselves up till <NAME> comes home. ' Mrs. <NAME> looked very grand , not to say contemptuous , at this humiliating proposal ; and , turning to the old gentleman , who had watched them during these whispers with absorbing eagerness , said : ' If you will conduct yourself , sir , like the gentleman I should imagine you to be , from your language and -- and -- appearance , ( quite the counterpart of your grandpapa , <NAME> , my dear , in his best days , ) and will put your question to me in plain words , I will answer it. ' If Mrs. <NAME> ' s excellent papa had borne , in his best days , a resemblance to the neighbour now looking over the wall , he must have been , to say the least , a very queer-looking old gentleman in his prime .
' Well , <NAME> , ' said Mr Meagles , even suppressing a sigh ; ' how goes the world with you this morning ? ' ' Much as usual , sir .
' <NAME> ' t wait , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
He was very fond of pickled walnuts , gentlemen .
Though in general he highly appreciates the society of Mrs. Bucket -- a lady of a natural detective genius , which if it had been improved by professional exercise , might have done great things , but which has paused at the level of a clever amateur -- he holds himself aloof from that dear solace .
<NAME> : But you think that their abolition would damage a class of practitioners ?
and when the ugly lame old gardener , who I thought had hardly noticed me in all those years , came panting after the coach to give me a little nosegay of geraniums and told me I had been the light of his eyes -- indeed the old man said so ! -- what a heart I had then !
You must exercise the strength of mind for which you are renowned , and make the best of it. ' ' The girl ' s family have made , ' said <NAME> , ' of course , the most strenuous endeavours to -- as the lawyers say -- to have and to hold Henry. ' ' Of course they have , my dear , ' said <NAME> .
His wristbands and collar were oppressive ; his voice and manner were oppressive .
' I give you my word and honour , sir , ' said <NAME> , ' that when I lay that book upon the table , and look at it outside ; compact in three separate and indiwidual wollumes -- one , two , three ; I am as proud as <NAME> to think that I once had the honour of being connected with your family .
There ' ll be beer to feth .
There was a spectre always attendant on him , saying to these high priests , ' Are such the signs you trust , and love to honour ; this head , these eyes , this mode of speech , the tone and manner of this man ?
ha ! ' If the proprietor of <NAME> could have known what was passing in his assistant ' s breast at that moment , he would have discovered , with some surprise , that he was as near being soundly pummelled as he had ever been in his life .
' Well , now , ' said <NAME> , ' afore these here ladies , I should jest like to ask you , as a sort of curiosity , whether you don ' t consider yourself as nice and well-behaved a young gen ' l ' m ' n , as ever used a pink check pocket-handkerchief , and the number four collection ? ' ' And as was ever a-going to be married to a cook , ' said that lady indignantly .
' It ' s not as if the theatre was in its high and palmy days -- you needn ' t stand , <NAME> -- the drama is gone , perfectly gone. ' ' As an exquisite embodiment of the poet ' s visions , and a realisation of human intellectuality , gilding with refulgent light our dreamy moments , and laying open a new and magic world before the mental eye , the drama is gone , perfectly gone , ' said <NAME> .
' How do you know I am old ?
When you are left alone here with <NAME> -- ' ' I am to be left alone here with <NAME> ? ' said <NAME> , quietly .
I believe I state your views correctly ; do I not , my dear Sir ? ' said the little man , turning to <NAME> .
I answered , most assuredly he did not .
Opening the door with all speed , he beheld the expressive countenance of Mr Chuckster , between whom and himself a fraternal greeting ensued .
His friends might advise him , you know ; now he is free .
Mr <NAME> was thus amiably engaged when a step was heard at the outer door , and the door was heard to open hastily .
I think of seeing her happy , and with friends about her , and brought up as she deserves , and as she ought to be .
Do you think that a hundred well-arranged plans , or a hundred suborned witnesses , or a hundred false curs at my heels , or a hundred canting speeches full of oily words , will move me ?
As she stood behind him , leaning over his chair so lovingly , he looked with downcast eyes at the fire .
" Devil doubt him , " says <NAME> .
I hate your virtuous people ! ' said the dwarf , throwing off a bumper of brandy , and smacking his lips , ' ah !
They all agree that she was too high , and Mr <NAME> ' s old flame , the housemaid ( who is very virtuous ) , entreats that you will never talk to her any more about people who hold their heads up , as if the ground wasn ' t good enough for ' em .
But she , who had heard what passed , and who , besides the relief of so suddenly considering herself safe at her journey ' s end , felt reassured beyond all measure by his lively youthful face and manner , ran eagerly up to him , leaving one of the slipshod shoes upon the ground and caught his hand in both of hers .
' Come , ' retorted <NAME> , ' let ' s have no more of this !
He consumed it in putting his hand to his forehead and taking it away again , and in backing his chair into the corner behind him .
' And you know ; at least I hope you know ; ' said Mr Podsnap , with severity , ' that Providence has declared that you shall have the poor always with you ? ' The meek man also hoped he knew that .
Occasionally , we stop for a few minutes , maybe to take in wood , maybe for passengers , at some small town or village ( I ought to say city , every place is a city here ) ; but the banks are for the most part deep solitudes , overgrown with trees , which , hereabouts , are already in leaf and very green .
Those things would be the watch and shirt-pin .
Give her the letter , make her take the letter , put it in her pocket by violence .
' The prospect of an addition to your family ? ' ' The seventh addition , <NAME> , ' returned <NAME> , solemnly .
My fault is , that I have been true to you .
She held it up as if she were a beautiful <NAME> , looking on him , face to face , to strike him dead .
But we took a moonlight walk last Monday night , to talk it over at leisure , and I represented the case to him as it really is .
What is there you can not do , if you will ! ' ' Thank you , ' said <NAME> , ' you ' re very complimentary to say so .
" Your head is cool ? " he said , touching it .
As I had not seen <NAME> on the occasion of our last call ( when he was not to be found anywhere , and when the cook rather thought he must have strolled away with the dustman 's cart ) , I now inquired for him again .
Perhaps this is the reason why it is an article of faith with the servants , handed down from race to race , that the departed <NAME> was a hairdresser .
I could repeat this in my mind too , but I had not the least idea what it meant .
'As weak as water , ' replied <NAME> , with an imprecation on his eyes and limbs .
Give him the papers , conversation , music , mutton , coffee , landscape , fruit in the season , a few sheets of Bristol-board , and a little claret , and he asked no more .
So far , I am rejoiced , I am sure. ' <NAME> , holding <NAME> ' s hat in his hand , was watching the proceedings with great interest , and bore upon his face the slightest possible indication of a smile , as <NAME> , shutting one of his eyes , looked with the other up the inside of one of the poor fellow ' s sleeves as if it were a telescope -- when <NAME> turning hastily to him , bade him search the hat .
' Confound his impudence ! ' muttered <NAME> , rapping the stair-rail impatiently with his cane .
Then she ran to the old man , who folded her in his arms and bade God bless her .
And <NAME> -- ' ' Says , ' Mary <NAME> went on , ' that he is not pleased with his sister , and that his sister won ' t be guided by his advice , and persists in being guided by somebody else ' s ; and that -- ' ' Mr Headstone coming across the garden ! ' exclaimed <NAME> , with a flushed glance at the looking-glass .
It had been one of the first novelties and pleasures of his freedom , and was equally the delight of his wife .
" Are you a married man , sir ? "
The young woman seemed surprised at his appearance , and asked him where his mother was .
My dear boy was not in his usual spirits ; he was depressed—I noticed that—and I am bound henceforth to dwell upon the circumstance the more , now that I know there was a special reason for his being depressed : a reason , moreover , which may possibly have induced him to absent himself. ' ' I pray to Heaven it may turn out so ! ' exclaimed <NAME> .
But bring him here , upon this crowded deck .
Soaking into this filthy ground as you lie here , is your own shape .
' Coach is ready , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , appearing at the door .
With which he hurried out of the room , down the stairs , up the coachsteps , and into the coach , without another word .
He held out his hand , which <NAME> clasped tight in hers .
He emptied his glass , looked mysteriously at his companion , winked both of his small eyes , one after the other , and finally made a motion with his arm , as if he were working an imaginary pump-handle ; thereby intimating that he ( <NAME> ) considered himself as undergoing the process of being pumped by <NAME> .
The vessel being pretty deep in the water , with all her coals on board and so many passengers , and the weather being calm and quiet , there was but little motion ; so that before the dinner was half over , even those passengers who were most distrustful of themselves plucked up amazingly ; and those who in the morning had returned to the universal question , ' Are you a good sailor ? ' a very decided negative , now either parried the inquiry with the evasive reply , ' Oh !
To this decision the middle-aged lady was impelled by a variety of considerations , the chief of which was the incontestable proof it would afford of her devotion to <NAME> , and her anxiety for his safety .
<NAME> and refinement seem but to enhance their warmth of heart and ardent enthusiasm ; and it is the possession of these latter qualities in a most remarkable degree , which renders an educated American one of the most endearing and most generous of friends .
Among them was a beautiful girl of twenty , who had been there nearly three years .
The man was not unnaturally cruel or hard-hearted .
' Will you try to teach me , <NAME> ? ' ' I must teach myself first , <NAME> , ' said I .
'Stupid enough , this , ' muttered the doctor to himself ; 'the boy must have made a mistake .
That 's the kind of man <NAME> is ! "
She put out her hand—a pretty little soft hand ; and her fingers closed upon her brother ' s , as if she would have carried them to her lips .
Our mother died there , when we were little children .
' Shovel and all ! ' said <NAME> .
That ' s the way it works .
And I have so many old parchmentses and papers in my stock .
Mr <NAME> turned his tongue in his closed mouth -- it seemed rather a stiff and unmanageable tongue -- moistened his lips , passed his hand over his forehead again , and looked all round the room again , principally under the chairs .
<NAME> and frenzy reigned supreme ; when a noise arose that drowned all others , and two men , seizing each other by the throat , struggled into the middle of the room .
' Look at his hang-dog air , ' said <NAME> , following .
My guardian lay at the <NAME> in the next room to mine .
Such a heart <NAME> carried under her rough robe .
" Faithful dear boy , well done .
Astonished for the moment , <NAME> fell back a couple of paces and surveyed him from head to foot .
" I do n't know who may not , if you may not . "
But of course I can ' t answer for the consequences .
" By heaven , he is the proudest fellow breathing .
But when I came to think again , I felt sure that I was doing her wrong in this ; and so I went on , as I did at first , hoping to see her once more , just as she used to be .
There were half-dressed figures tearing to and fro , some endeavouring to drag the frightened horses from the stables , others driving the cattle from the yard and out-houses , and others coming laden from the burning pile , amidst a shower of falling sparks , and the tumbling down of red-hot beams .
That there was no hope of escape from it , unless the escape was my own act , I knew quite well .
" Guv'ner , " says <NAME> with exceeding gravity , " he 's a leech in his dispositions , he 's a screw and a wice in his actions , a snake in his twistings , and a lobster in his claws . "
' Bless the precious boy ! ' cried <NAME> , taking hold of me .
I have wronged her enough in fact ; I have wronged her still more in intention .
From <NAME> she looked at me , with a searching glance that seemed to pry into my heart and probe its wounds .
There was nothing revealed by the many eyes that looked at him but watchfulness and eagerness ; there was no visible menacing or anger .
You know what I mean .
" Not so easily as you think .
Neither the Saone nor the <NAME> sped with the swiftness of that peerless building ; nor was the <NAME> deeper than its foundations ; nor were the distant landscapes on the <NAME> road , nor the hills and bay of Genoa the <NAME> , more beautiful .
Let us love each other , <NAME> ! ' said <NAME> , fondling his shaggy head .
' And how do you think we are looking , <NAME> , -- I should say , <NAME> ? ' fawned <NAME> .
There was an old Roman bath in those days at the bottom of one of the streets out of the <NAME> -- it may be there still -- in which I have had many a cold plunge .
We ca n't take THAT in a court of justice , gentlemen .
<NAME> was quite at home here , in right of <NAME> , not to mention the <NAME> and <NAME> , and kept them in view with ease .
' That ' s what you tell this gentleman too , is it ? ' ' If the gentleman comes to ask the same question , I can ' t tell him anything else , sir ; and I only wish I could , for our own sakes , ' was the reply .
' They know what they ' re about , if ever people did , ' murmured <NAME> , drawing in her breath ' oh !
This , too , delighted <NAME> .
She began sobbing and weeping ( to secure the aunt ' s sympathy to herself ) , and said , ' Dear aunt , she has an unhappy temper ; other girls at school , besides I , try hard to make it better ; we all try hard. ' Upon that the aunt fondled her , as if she had said something noble instead of despicable and false , and kept up the infamous pretence by replying , ' But there are reasonable limits , my dear love , to everything , and I see that this poor miserable girl causes you more constant and useless distress than even so good an effort justifies. ' The poor miserable girl came out of her concealment , as you may be prepared to hear , and said , ' Send me home. ' I never said another word to either of them , or to any of them , but ' Send me home , or I will walk home alone , night and day ! ' When I got home , I told my supposed grandmother that , unless I was sent away to finish my education somewhere else before that girl came back , or before any one of them came back , I would burn my sight away by throwing myself into the fire , rather than I would endure to look at their plotting faces .
The amazement , suspicion , resentment , and shame , with which <NAME> looked on at all this , struck him dumb .
I was taking my coffee and roll in the morning , before going to the <NAME> -- and I may observe in this place that it is surprising how much coffee Mrs. <NAME> used , and how weak it was , considering -- when <NAME> himself walked in , to my unbounded joy .
Therefore my <NAME> has come away from the place in <NAME> and has left it to the rain , and the crows , and the rabbits , and the deer , and the partridges and pheasants .
Perhaps I might say better , and yet make no boast of it. ' Poor Little Dorrit , not seeing her way to the offering of any soothing words that would escape repudiation , deemed it best to remain quiet .
Whether it was the absence of the fetters or not , it made no very deep impression on <NAME> ' s adversary , however , but rather seemed to increase the good-humour expressed in his countenance ; in which stage of the contest , one or two gentlemen , who had come out expressly to witness the pulling of <NAME> ' s nose , grew impatient , murmuring that if it were to be done at all it had better be done at once , and that if Mr Lenville didn ' t mean to do it he had better say so , and not keep them waiting there .
You keep him in check , <NAME> , with your common sense , and you stick to the <NAME> , <NAME> , with your -- ' ' Uncommon sense ? ' suggested <NAME> , with his quiet smile .
Then she turned out the contents of the bowl of money for the second time , and began knotting them up in her handkerchief , in a chain of separate knots , for safe keeping through the night .
My aunt , who had this other general opinion in reference to <NAME> , that every man she saw was a pickpocket , gave me her purse to carry for her , which had ten guineas in it and some silver .
" Not enough , " says the trooper , shaking his head .
No wonder. ' ' No wonder , ' repeated <NAME> .
As <NAME> never removed her eyes from <NAME> ( on whom they had some effect , as a steady look has on a lower sort of dog ) , so <NAME> never removed his from <NAME> .
I was sent for , and the case was entrusted to me .
Turning towards <NAME> , and raising his hands and eyes in token of the unspeakable sorrow with which he regarded the calamity that had befallen the family , he carried the high-backed chair to his old corner by the fire , and , seating himself on the very edge , drew forth a brown pocket-handkerchief , and applied the same to his optics .
<NAME> <NAME> took what was given him to eat and drink , and worked on , that first day , until it was too dark to see -- worked on , half an hour after <NAME> could not have seen , for his life , to read or write .
I was well enough , however , to be up early in the morning , and to return my darling 's cheerful blessing from the garden , and to talk with her as long as usual .
" If you don ' t mind what I say , my boy , " said the father , " you ' ll find yourself in bed , in something less than a pig ' s whisper. " He gave the child a shake to make him obedient , and such a rattling ensued as nobody ever heard before .
' What ' s come to you , <NAME> ?
The only pupil who evinced the slightest tendency towards locomotion or playfulness was <NAME> , and as his chief amusement was to tread upon the other boys ' toes in his new boots , his flow of spirits was rather disagreeable than otherwise .
I shouldn ' t have had the heart to put on gentleman ' s clothes .
<NAME> Grewgious being of opinion that she could not do better , she withdrew for the purpose .
Or so -- like a fried fish .
Finally , the worthy couple went away arm in arm .
' At what time will it be ready ? ' asked Mr Codlin faintly .
' I ' ll take down the heads if you please , sir .
'All that I could hope to do , and even more .
' A natural ambition enough , ' said <NAME> , coolly .
' It is truly painful to contemplate mankind in such an aspect , <NAME> , but our reception was , decidedly , cool .
There , with closed doors , and in a mysterious and guilty manner , <NAME> hacked the shoemaker 's bench to pieces , while <NAME> held the candle as if she were assisting at a murder -- for which , indeed , in her grimness , she was no unsuitable figure .
This reply is cut short by <NAME> 's arrival .
They told me in low whispers , that the floor of the old house in which my father died , was stained with his own blood , shed by his own hand in raging madness .
<NAME> <NAME> restrained his wrath by gigantic efforts ; but when <NAME> wrote a cheque for the whole amount , and <NAME> deposited it in a small pocket-book , with a triumphant smile playing over his pimply features , which communicated itself likewise to the stern countenance of <NAME> , he felt the blood in his cheeks tingling with indignation .
Where are they all ! ' ' Whom do you speak of ? ' inquired <NAME> , wishing to rouse the poor half-witted creature to reason .
Then , walking again up to the window , and once more returning disappointed , he sighed deeply , and left the room ; upon which the other two burst into a loud laugh .
The breakfast was interrupted by very little conversation ; even <NAME> felt the influence of the weather , and the previous day ' s excitement .
That again was very reasonable ; since in a country suffering under the affliction of a great amount of earnestness , there might , in an exceeding short space of time , be not a single <NAME> left sticking to a post .
But when the light of the fire was shining on the walls and ceiling of the little room , and on the tea-board and the cups and saucers that were ranged upon the table , and on her calm face turned towards the flame , and reflecting it in the tears that filled her eyes , the <NAME> broke a long silence thus : ' You never was at sea , my own ? ' ' No , ' replied <NAME> .
It was not easy to answer her inquiries ; still less to whisper <NAME> , when <NAME> brought him in , that I had given the letter , and all was well .
When this same <NAME> was mentioned , <NAME> stopped me and herself , and stood looking at the speaker .
The wind , too , which was directly against them , swept in furious gusts down the narrow road , and howled dismally through the trees which skirted the pathway .
' The attorney bowed obsequiously , and glanced at a large packet which the gentleman carried in his hand .
' Good-morning , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
' See what , my dear <NAME> ? ' said my mother ; ' where ? ' ' He ' s got it ! ' cried <NAME> .
<NAME> remained in the same attitude till he heard the noise of the closing door , when he shrugged his shoulders , and after a few turns about the room -- hasty at first , but gradually becoming slower , as he relapsed into himself -- sat down before his desk .
Late as the <NAME> clock showed it to be , the poor woman was still hard at work at an ironing-table ; a young child lay sleeping in a cradle near the fire ; and another , a sturdy boy of two or three years old , very wide awake , with a very tight night-cap on his head , and a night-gown very much too small for him on his body , was sitting bolt upright in a clothes-basket , staring over the rim with his great round eyes , and looking as if he had thoroughly made up his mind never to go to sleep any more ; which , as he had already declined to take his natural rest and had been brought out of bed in consequence , opened a cheerful prospect for his relations and friends .
Shocking thing that , Tom. " ' " Dreadful ! " said <NAME> .
I inclined my head , without knowing what she meant ; and she said , ' Come here ! ' again ; and returned , followed by the respectable <NAME> , who , with undiminished respectability , made me a bow , and took up his position behind her .
I ought rather to write that I should have been alarmed if I had had energy and concentration enough to help me to the clear perception of any truth beyond the fact that I was falling very ill .
' Think of <NAME> and Mr Pluck , two of the most perfect gentlemen that ever lived , what am I too say to them -- what can I say to them ?
There are funds in hand at present .
My works don ' t all moulder away , and rot in the earth .
' I hadn ' t a shoe to my foot .
Another morning arrived , and she came alone .
' Let us be beggars , and be happy. ' ' Beggars -- and happy ! ' said the old man .
The sun rose and sank , and rose and sank again , and many times after that ; and still the boy lay stretched on his uneasy bed , dwindling away beneath the dry and wasting heat of fever .
She looked at <NAME> with keen and unabated interest ; the sound of her voice was thrilling to her ; nothing that was near her , or about her , or at all concerned her , escaped <NAME> .
One of the many to whom , from straitened circumstances , a consequent inability to form the associations they would wish , and a disinclination to mix with the society they could obtain , <NAME> is as complete a solitude as the plains of <NAME> , the humble artist had pursued her lonely , but contented way for many years ; and , until the peculiar misfortunes of the <NAME> family attracted her attention , had made no friends , though brimful of the friendliest feelings to all mankind .
My guardian looked at us again , plainly saying , " You hear him ? "
They seem to come natural to me. ' ' Mr .
' Am I right , again ? ' inquired the <NAME> in a whisper , with the scarlet circle on his forehead swelling in his triumphant joy .
It was at the concealed throat of the sleeper that <NAME> so often looked so curiously , until the sleep seemed to deepen into the stupor of the dead-tired in mind and body .
' I take quite a lively interest in you , my dear soul , upon my word , ' said <NAME> ; ' a sister ' s interest , actually .
Now , madam , I am troubled by noticing that <NAME> is not , so to speak , one of ourselves .
' What are you a-laughin ' at , corpilence ? ' ' <NAME> !
' I have been a good deal flurried , ' replied Mrs. Raddle , in a reproachful manner .
On this head , young <NAME> had no doubt whatever , so Mr <NAME> made him a present of that sum of money , and thanked him for his attention to his ( Mr <NAME> ' s ) affairs ; which , he added , were now , he believed , as good as settled .
Let me suppose the case that I myself may at a certain time -- ha -- or times , have made a -- hum -- an appeal , and a properly-worded appeal , and a delicate appeal , and an urgent appeal to some individual for a small temporary accommodation .
' I suppose there ' s nothing to prevent your going in for it ? ' said Mr Boffin .
<NAME> made in every direction .
<NAME> <NAME> is not in the library , but she repairs to the library .
'He came to me , and left with me , among some other things , a picture -- a portrait painted by himself -- a likeness of this poor girl -- which he did not wish to leave behind , and could not carry forward on his hasty journey .

Beyond these pages the prison has no record of his existence : and though he live to be in the same cell ten weary years , he has no means of knowing , down to the very last hour , in which part of the building it is situated ; what kind of men there are about him ; whether in the long winter nights there are living people near , or he is in some lonely corner of the great jail , with walls , and passages , and iron doors between him and the nearest sharer in its solitary horrors .
" Where was this coach , in the name of gracious ? " asked my sister .
But being now come into the <NAME> , where there was a coach-stand , he stood irresolute whether to go to his lodgings , or to go first to Mr <NAME> ' s house .
' Like the startled fawn , ' said <NAME> .
' What ' s the matter ? ' he asked in plain <NAME> .
I gained the door , dropped over the banisters , and in an instant was in the street .
There is no such thing as such fulfilment on this earth .
She softened more and more while saying this and cried so much over the unwonted little home-picture she had raised in her mind that <NAME> , in his cave under the piano , was touched , and turned himself over on his back with loud lamentations .
'Those were his words , ' said <NAME> , glancing uneasily round , as she had scarcely ceased to do , since she began to speak , for a vision of <NAME> haunted her perpetually .
Your daughter <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , with a lofty air of never having had the least copartnership in that young lady : of whom she now made reproachful mention as an article of luxury which her husband had set up entirely on his own account , and in direct opposition to her advice : ' -- your daughter <NAME> has bestowed herself upon a Mendicant. ' ' Good gracious , my dear ! ' ' Show your father his daughter <NAME> ' s letter , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , in her monotonous Act of <NAME> tone , and waving her hand .
But we don ' t live under leaves , and keep cows and sheep and creatures .
If not , by your own thoughts and suspicions. ' ' I have no suspicions , ' said the Manager .
' <NAME> , when you have found out concerning his coming home , come round to the window of <NAME> , tap twice at it , and wait for me .
I couldn ' t myself. ' ' Do you suppose , ' said I , constraining myself to be very temperate and quiet with him , on account of <NAME> , ' that I regard <NAME> otherwise than as a very dear sister ? ' ' Well , <NAME> , ' he replied , ' you perceive I am not bound to answer that question .
It is the hottest long vacation known for many years .
Now , I had known the bride when I was last there , not only as the prettiest girl in the place , but as having quite distinguished herself in the school , and I could not help looking at her with some surprise .
' A tragedy. ' <NAME> seemed much relieved .
Throughout the remainder of the day , Mr <NAME> ' s What were they up to ?
Is that your fidelity to me ?
I am inclined to believe , from my uncertainty on this head , that it was six at first and seven afterwards .
The lamps , gleaming on the medley of horses ' heads , jumbled with the shadowy driver , and the fluttering of his cloak , made a thousand indistinct shapes , answering to his thoughts .
I wasn ' t here myself above seven year before you .
Who made me " a fellow like this " ?
It would have been next to impossible to suspect him of anything wrong , he was so thoroughly respectable .
But even in this chamber there was a rocking-chair .
The alacrity with which <NAME> brought my bonnet and veil , and having dressed me , quaintly pinned herself into her warm shawl and made herself look like a little old woman , sufficiently expressed her readiness .
I thank you even more for the tone of the question .
On the last Sunday , they invited me to dinner ; and we had a loin of pork and apple sauce , and a pudding .
A fair girl with rich brown hair hanging free in natural ringlets .
You will allow me to order you lunch after your journey , sir . "
If he should be so compassionate as to say that you might write something for me to read -- I think he would , oh , I think he would , if you would only ask him , for he always was so brave and so forgiving -- tell him then ( but not else ) , that when I hear the wind blowing at night , I feel as if it was passing angrily from seeing him and uncle , and was going up to God against me .
They were furnished with slippers and such dry garments as the house or their own bundles afforded , and ensconcing themselves , as Mr <NAME> had already done , in the warm chimney-corner , soon forgot their late troubles or only remembered them as enhancing the delights of the present time .
Give me your hand , my poor boy , and may God forgive you as I do ! ' The culprit was moved to a few abject tears by these words and their pathetic tone .
' I felt it so much that I wouldn ' t on any account have even mentioned that you bought a <NAME> -- which was too much for two .
said <NAME> , coming hastily forward .
As the elms bent to one another , like giants who were whispering secrets , and after a few seconds of such repose , fell into a violent flurry , tossing their wild arms about , as if their late confidences were really too wicked for their peace of mind , some weatherbeaten ragged old rooks ' -nests , burdening their higher branches , swung like wrecks upon a stormy sea .
' We were peeping at the circus , ' muttered <NAME> , haughtily , without lifting up her eyes , ' and father caught us. ' ' And , Mrs. Gradgrind , ' said her husband in a lofty manner , ' I should as soon have expected to find my children reading poetry. ' ' Dear me , ' whimpered Mrs. Gradgrind .
' Once make a giant common and giants will never draw again .
' You spy and speculate on people ' s business with me , do you ? ' ' Dear , no , sir !
If not yesterday , why then today .
There is , perhaps , no reason why I should express myself at all , except the intimacy that has subsisted between us , and which I very much hope , <NAME> -- confidently hope -- nothing will occur to disturb .
<NAME> came out of the hot mill into the damp wind and cold wet streets , haggard and worn .
<NAME> up the place , turn out directly , and send me the key by bearer .
<NAME> was produced , when the court was quiet enough to admit of his being heard , and rapidly expounded the story of the imprisonment , and of his having been a mere boy in the <NAME> 's service , and of the release , and of the state of the prisoner when released and delivered to him .
' Tut ! ' said the <NAME> softly , ' I am much overpaid ! ' and turned away .
' What amount of small change , <NAME> , ' he said , with an abstracted air , after a little meditation , ' might you call a morsel of money ? ' Hurriedly emptying her pocket , old <NAME> laid down on the table , a shilling , and two sixpenny pieces , and a few pence .
' Mr <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' being pretty well accustomed to the agricultural pursuits of sowing wild oats , <NAME> , prudently considers that half a loaf is better than no bread .
The poor child had sat in mute amazement , and patiently imitated everything her teacher did ; but now the truth began to flash upon her : her intellect began to work : she perceived that here was a way by which she could herself make up a sign of anything that was in her own mind , and show it to another mind ; and at once her countenance lighted up with a human expression : it was no longer a dog , or parrot : it was an immortal spirit , eagerly seizing upon a new link of union with other spirits !
' What I know of Mr Riah , ' said <NAME> , with a very disparaging utterance of his name , ' leads me to believe that this is about the shop for disagreeable business .
It was November , and my guardian was standing before his fire leaning his back against the chimney-piece , with his hands under his coattails .
For your good opinion now , for your way of receiving and encouraging me when I first put myself in communication with you , and for the influence since so kindly brought to bear upon a certain lady , both by yourself and by Mr <NAME> Harmon. ' To whom , when thus making mention of him , he also bowed .
<NAME> , clearing his throat behind his hand with a respectable short cough , changed legs , and went on : ' At last , when there had been , upon the whole , a good many words and reproaches , <NAME> he set off one morning , from the neighbourhood of <NAME> , where we had a villa ( the young woman being very partial to the sea ) , and , under pretence of coming back in a day or so , left it in charge with me to break it out , that , for the general happiness of all concerned , he was ' -- here an interruption of the short cough -- ' gone .
' Placed in a mental position of peculiar painfulness , beyond the assuaging reach even of Mrs. Micawber ' s influence , though exercised in the tripartite character of woman , wife , and mother , it is my intention to fly from myself for a short period , and devote a respite of eight-and-forty hours to revisiting some metropolitan scenes of past enjoyment .
Grandfather Smallweed smiles in a very ugly way in recognition of the letter .
<NAME> , dear ! ' I changed the subject by referring to <NAME> .
" I say , my friends , " pursues <NAME> , utterly rejecting and obliterating <NAME> 's suggestion , " why can we not fly ?
I was to leave our village at five in the morning , carrying my little hand-portmanteau , and I had told <NAME> that I wished to walk away all alone .
<NAME> in red going to sacrifice <NAME> in blue , and <NAME> in yellow cast into a den of green lions , were the most prominent of these .
You ' ll make nothing of this .
Her eyes were closing , but they opened again .
I say , my dear Loo !
Let ' s keep out of <NAME> , whatever we come to. ' ' There ' s more than enough of that about , without us ; ain ' t there , <NAME> ? ' said <NAME> .
" <NAME> , surely ! " said <NAME> , who had left her in exactly the same attitude some seventeen years ago .
As well as the prisoner could see , he and <NAME> were the only men there , unconnected with the <NAME> , who wore their usual clothes , and had not assumed the coarse garb of the <NAME> .
I acknowledge that I like it , dear boy , but I am not worth it .
' Hush ! ' said <NAME> , in a stage-whisper -- ' <NAME> boy -- dumpling face -- round eyes -- rascal ! ' Here he shook his head expressively , and the spinster aunt trembled with agitation .
and wi ' verses in his speech , too , -- and war n't it me as could only say , 'Gentlemen , this man at my side is a most precious rascal ' ?
If it ever was , let us forget it. ' ' You are a good girl , you are a patient girl. ' ' As for patience , ' she would reply with a shrug , ' not much of that , godmother .
After some search , it was found in the box , at the bottom of a horse ' s nose-bag ; wherein ( besides hay ) there was discovered an old gold watch , with chain and seals , which <NAME> had worn on his wedding-day , and which had never been seen before or since ; a silver tobacco-stopper , in the form of a leg ; an imitation lemon , full of minute cups and saucers , which I have some idea <NAME> must have purchased to present to me when I was a child , and afterwards found himself unable to part with ; eighty-seven guineas and a half , in guineas and half-guineas ; two hundred and ten pounds , in perfectly clean <NAME> notes ; certain receipts for <NAME> of <NAME> stock ; an old horseshoe , a bad shilling , a piece of camphor , and an oyster-shell .
Impelled by a laudable ambition to study the art and mystery of his father 's honest calling , <NAME> , keeping as close to house fronts , walls , and doorways , as his eyes were close to one another , held his honoured parent in view .
He nodded when I said the subject was painful to me , clapped me on the back , put round the wine again , and went on with his dinner .
He had proudly resumed his privilege , in many of his spare hours , of walking up and down the garden with the <NAME> ; as he had been accustomed to pace up and down The <NAME> ' s <NAME> at <NAME> .
Their walk was the walk of a race apart .
I could snap it like a twig , only there are long galleries here with many doors -- I don ' t think I could find my way along them ; and even if I could , I know there are iron gates below which they keep locked and barred .
' I am not so unreasonable as to expect , ' said <NAME> , resuming her usual tone , after a little while , ' that you will , or that you can , at once , change any sentiment that has become a conviction to you ; least of all a sentiment that is rooted in your trusting disposition .
'What has become of him !
The girl stamped her foot violently on the floor as she vented this threat ; and with her lips compressed , and her hands clenched , looked alternately at the Jew and the other robber : her face quite colourless from the passion of rage into which she had gradually worked herself .
We have preserved them , nevertheless , as affording at once a touching and a convincing proof of the estimation in which he was held by every class of society , and the case with which he made his way to their hearts and feelings .
' Ay ! ' exclaimed the Manager , ' what ' s that ?
it wasn ' t for him to betray his trust , was it ?
I think of the number of yards of net in <NAME> Murdstone ' s cap , or of the price of <NAME> ' s dressing-gown , or any such ridiculous problem that I have no business with , and don ' t want to have anything at all to do with .
On our return , we held a great review of the house and garden and saw that everything was in its prettiest condition , and had the bird out ready as an important part of the establishment .
I may say that I do too , and always did .
After some quarter of an hour ' s absence , he returned .
' I never , never will , sir , ' interposed <NAME> .
The galley was kept steady , and the silent , eager look-out at the water was resumed .
Of <NAME> ' s making a long series of surprised discoveries that she has forgotten all sorts of little things ; and of everybody ' s running everywhere to fetch them .
said <NAME> : not holding his wine-glass by the stem , but grasping the bottom between the thumb and forefinger of his left hand : and placing it in front of his chest ; ' I have seen a good many pieces of business like this , in my time , ladies . '
He had a patron who in a certain sumptuous way -- an apologetic way , as if he constantly took an admiring audience to witness that he really could not help being more free with this old fellow than they might have expected , on account of his simplicity and poverty -- was mightily good to him .
Here he was searched ; and nothing being found upon him , locked up .
I suppose so. ' ' To tell you my mind , <NAME> , ' says <NAME> ; she still calls <NAME> , on account of having made her first experiments in the child-quelling line of business on that lady , when an unfortunate and weazen little girl of tender years ; ' to tell you my mind , <NAME> , I think it ' s a good riddance .
You are to understand , first , that it is the request of the person from whom I take my instructions that you always bear the name of <NAME> .
The grim sly faces in the squares and diamonds of the floor-cloth , relaxed and peeped out at him with less wicked eyes .
So obdurate , so unapproachable , so unrelenting , one would have thought that nothing could soften such a woman ' s nature , and that everything in life had hardened it .
" Nod it ; that 's what I want to see you do .
The night was dark , and a cold wind blew , driving the clouds , furiously and fast , before it .
' The room was kept like this , <NAME> , ' said Mr Boffin , ' against the son ' s return .
But there was other trouble .
It was all gone now .
' " I have wronged you , " shrieked the old man , falling on his knees , and clasping his hands together .
' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> to his sister , ' any harsh words between us are , I hope , uncommon .
The boy shouted ; four birds flew out .
He came to take leave of us ; he had settled to do so beforehand .
Clear of the house , I made the best of my way back to <NAME> 's , took off my new clothes , made them into a bundle , and went back home in my older dress , carrying it -- to speak the truth -- much more at my ease too , though I had the bundle to carry .
' <NAME> , the process had been mechanical , and the success about as great as teaching a very knowing dog a variety of tricks .
'That man must be delivered up by you , ' said the gentleman .
Here IS the young man ! "
Next comes what you mean to say .
Has that fellow ' -- to the man with the wooden leg -- ' been here again ? ' ' <NAME> , ' was the answer .
'Make a bow to the gentleman , <NAME> , ' said Mrs. Mann .
Its legs and feet , most delicately formed , were , like those upper members , bare .
I go back at eight o ' clock tomorrow morning , and have got only three -- three oughts is an ought -- three twos is six -- sixty pound .
It 's the fashionable way ; and fashion and whiskers have been my weaknesses , and I do n't care who knows it , " says <NAME> .
Then she would take up another pen , and begin to write , and find that it spluttered .
Now , <NAME> had still the piece of gold sewn in her dress ; and when she came to consider the lateness of the hour , and the somnolent habits of Mrs Jarley , and to imagine the state of consternation in which they would certainly throw that good lady by knocking her up in the middle of the night -- and when she reflected , on the other hand , that if they remained where they were , and rose early in the morning , they might get back before she awoke , and could plead the violence of the storm by which they had been overtaken , as a good apology for their absence -- she decided , after a great deal of hesitation , to remain .
" I am very grateful for all your kindness and consideration regarding our marriage , and so , I can assure you , is <NAME> . "
He began to show now that he thought of <NAME> ' s fatigue : and often taxed his weakness to whisper to her , ' Go and walk , my dearest , in the sweet air .
The appearance of everything on the lines denoted that the approaching ceremony was one of the utmost grandeur and importance .
It was dreadful to go in at the door again ; but , she did go in , and even went near it , to get the bonnet and other things that she must wear .
' Is this all ? ' demanded the person of the house , when a confused heap of pence and shillings lay on the table .
If she should ever tell me that you are essential to her perfect happiness , I will give her to you .
Now I ask you fair .
I want you to stand between <NAME> and me , and keep us asunder. ' ' Would you love each other too much , without me ? ' ' Yes ; or hate , ' laughed <NAME> ; ' no matter which .
My passion for her is beyond all bounds .
He was a true <NAME> , and hoped there were many like him .
On the clock ' s striking ten , and <NAME> ' s appearing at the door , and addressing a certain person in a faded scarlet jacket , with ' <NAME> , your time ' s up !
" Never have -- " " Not <NAME> , <NAME> ? "
<NAME> coals to be relied upon ?
It was quite dark when he was awakened by a push from <NAME> .
The offer relieved him from considerable embarrassment , for his previous notions of loading a pistol were rather vague and undefined .
Say you know me , and I am sure they will not charge you for it .
My sister ! ' ' <NAME> , <NAME> ! ' returned Mrs. Nickleby , ' whose Kate should it be , if not ours ; or what should I care about it , or take any interest in it for , if it was anybody but your sister ? ' ' Dear mother , ' said <NAME> , ' surely it can ' t be ! ' ' Very good , my dear , ' replied Mrs. Nickleby , with great confidence .
' Not a bit of it , ' replied <NAME> ; ' only cheerful. ' ' Cheerful , sir ! ' ejaculated <NAME> .
All manner of learning my boys take down , sir ; the expense is never thought of ; and they get paternal treatment and washing in. ' ' Upon my word , ' said the gentleman , glancing at <NAME> with a half-smile , and a more than half expression of surprise , ' these are advantages indeed. ' ' You may say that , sir , ' rejoined <NAME> , thrusting his hands into his great-coat pockets .
The dinner done , Mrs. Bagnet , assisted by the younger branches ( who polish their own cups and platters , knives and forks ) , makes all the dinner garniture shine as brightly as before and puts it all away , first sweeping the hearth , to the end that <NAME> and the visitor may not be retarded in the smoking of their pipes .
' I should like , ' he said , 'to call in the aid of my friend <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> thrust forth his face ; and never could I forget the change that came upon it when he saw us , if I were to live five hundred years .
I appeal to you to discontinue your habit of making your misplaced attentions as plain to Mrs Boffin as to me. ' ' Have I done so ? ' ' I should think you have , ' replied <NAME> .
I mean a man whose hopes and aims may sometimes lie ( as most men 's sometimes do , I dare say ) above the ordinary level , but to whom the ordinary level will be high enough after all if it should prove to be a way of usefulness and good service leading to no other .
Follows the <NAME> of <NAME> Nickleby It was with a heavy heart , and many sad forebodings which no effort could banish , that <NAME> , on the morning appointed for the commencement of her engagement with <NAME> , left the city when its clocks yet wanted a quarter of an hour of eight , and threaded her way alone , amid the noise and bustle of the streets , towards the west end of <NAME> .
Accordingly , I started at once , and she leaned upon my shoulder , and we went away at a pace that might have been an imitation ( founded on my first impulse under that roof ) of <NAME> 's chaise-cart .
It is one <NAME> , it appears .
It was a very low fire indeed ; nothing on such a bitter night .
But I may be wrong. ' ' No , you are not wrong , ' said <NAME> , shaking her head .
' <NAME> would not give that for Mrs Wititterly ' s existence. ' <NAME> told this with a kind of sober exultation , as if it were no trifling distinction for a man to have a wife in such a desperate state , and Mrs. Wititterly sighed and looked on , as if she felt the honour , but had determined to bear it as meekly as might be .
It was a mere lumber-room now , but it yet contained an old dismantled bedstead ; the one on which his son had slept ; for no other had ever been there .
' I come to know , ma ' am , whether he will keep his wured ? ' ' No , ' she returned .
At that time it was customary to carry <NAME> down to the dock-yards by stage-coach .
Will you come with us ? ' A little winding through some muddy alleys that might have been deposited by the last ill-savoured tide , brought them to the wicket-gate and bright lamp of a Police Station ; where they found the Night-Inspector , with a pen and ink , and ruler , posting up his books in a whitewashed office , as studiously as if he were in a monastery on top of a mountain , and no howling fury of a drunken woman were banging herself against a cell-door in the back-yard at his elbow .
This chafing over , the ornamental part of <NAME> 's toilet is soon performed .
You needn ' t think it an unmanly or quizzical thing to be particular about your nightcap , for I have often heard your poor dear papa , and the <NAME> Mr. What ' s-his-name , who used to read prayers in that old church with the curious little steeple that the weathercock was blown off the night week before you were born , -- I have often heard them say , that the young men at college are uncommonly particular about their nightcaps , and that the <NAME> nightcaps are quite celebrated for their strength and goodness ; so much so , indeed , that the young men never dream of going to bed without ' em , and I believe it ' s admitted on all hands that THEY know what ' s good , and don ' t coddle themselves. ' <NAME> laughed , and entering no further into the subject of this lengthened harangue , reverted to the pleasant tone of the little birthday party .
It appears to me , my dear <NAME> , ' said Mrs. Micawber , forcibly , ' that what <NAME> has to do , is to throw down the gauntlet to society , and say , in effect , " Show me who will take that up .
' Do you know that your forties have stretched into thousands ? ' ' No. ' ' They have though. ' ' What ' s the time ? ' ' <NAME> !
That night , for the first time in all those many nights , the candle was taken out of the window , <NAME> swung in his old hammock in the old boat , and the wind murmured with the old sound round his head .
' This was a merry life for the <NAME> of <NAME> , and a merrier still for the baron ' s retainers , who drank <NAME> wine every night till they fell under the table , and then had the bottles on the floor , and called for pipes .
Can you lay your hand upon your heart and say that you are worthy of so hysterical a daughter ?
' Is <NAME> in ? ' faltered <NAME> .
No , " returned the stranger , " but once and away , and on a Saturday night too .
" <NAME> , " replies the other , " I am in the downs .
' You have got the address ? ' ' <NAME> , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , consulting his pocket- book .
' It was very thoughtful to mention it. ' ' Can I -- or <NAME> -- do anything ? ' asked <NAME> , gently .
She is truly a comfort to me the first time I see her. ' ' Perhaps you don ' t , ' said the visitor , hesitating -- ' perhaps you don ' t know my story ?
Stopped speaking only ; her hand was still in motion .
I found him out , all in a flash as I may say , one night .
<NAME> <NAME> shortly afterwards took himself off , to prepare for his journey .
Of course , I understand THAT , my love , without your telling me ; and I said the same to <NAME> , and I AM very much pleased .
A lane of small boys beyond me , with the same interest in his eye , watch it too .
Though not Professed but <NAME> , still her wages should be a sufficient object to her to stimilate to soar above mere roast and biled. ' ' We dined very well indeed , ' said <NAME> , ' thank you. ' ' Accustomed , ' said <NAME> with a gracious air , which to the jealous ears of the <NAME> seemed to add ' my good woman ' — ' accustomed to a liberal and nutritious , yet plain and salutary diet , we have found no reason to bemoan our absence from the ancient city , and the methodical household , in which the quiet routine of our lot has been hitherto cast. ' ' I did think it well to mention to my cook , ' observed the <NAME> with a gush of candour , ' which I ' ope you will agree with , <NAME> , was a right precaution , that the young lady being used to what we should consider here but poor diet , had better be brought forward by degrees .
Soon afterwards the day began to dawn , and he softly detached himself from the clasping hand , and cautiously looked out again .
Do you know what my great grandfather ' s name was ? ' ' No , ' said <NAME> .
It was very possible that Mr <NAME> had not yet left the office .
' You got the place , then ? ' ' I got the place , and no thanks to you for it , nor yet none to <NAME> , ' gruffly answered <NAME> .
" You have been a soldier , " observes <NAME> , " and a faithful one . "
After all , you know , it must be said of you that you couldn ' t help yourself : while it would be said of him , with equal reason , that he could. ' ' That ' s true , sir .
It happening that nobody did , he remarked with a mysterious air that he had heard a medical gentleman as went down to <NAME> last week , say how that snuff-taking was bad for the eyes ; but for his part he had never found it so , and what he said was , that everybody should speak as they found .
I am sure you will respect it .
' For , ' said he , ' as my business with this set of gentlemen was to do a public duty and a public service , and as their business with me was to prevent it by wearing my soul out , I think we had better not eat and drink together with a show of being of one mind. ' Mr <NAME> was much amused by his friend ' s oddity ; and patronised him with a more protecting air of allowance than usual , when he rejoined : ' Well , well , <NAME> , you shall have your own crotchety way. ' To Mr <NAME> , as the time approached , <NAME> tried to convey by all quiet and unpretending means , that he was frankly and disinterestedly desirous of tendering him any friendship he would accept .
'Even if it had been the right place , and the right fellows had been there , what could I have done , single-handed ?
" You would deprive them of their means of dining every seventh day , often the only day on which they can be said to dine at all , " said <NAME> .
Too rul loo rul Too rul loo rul -- still , in my desire to be wiser , I got this composition by heart with the utmost gravity ; nor do I recollect that I questioned its merit , except that I thought ( as I still do ) the amount of Too rul somewhat in excess of the poetry .
Did he sip every flower , and change every hour , until Polly his passion requited ? -- Is her name <NAME> ? ' The <NAME> suddenness with which she pounced upon me with this question , and a searching look , quite disconcerted me for a moment .
Throughout the remainder of the day , <NAME> was in consternation , as the grim Pancks cruised in it ; haranguing the inhabitants on their backslidings in respect of payment , demanding his bond , breathing notices to quit and executions , running down defaulters , sending a swell of terror on before him , and leaving it in his wake .
Oliver glanced at it , and saw that it was directed to <NAME> , <NAME> , at some great lord 's house in the country ; where , he could not make out .

They were all poor country people in the church , for the castle in which the old family had lived , was an empty ruin , and there were none but humble folks for seven miles around .
' I got it out of him , ' said <NAME> , with a stammer .
I suppose I looked uncertain , for he went on hastily : ' You have heard the " counting-house " mentioned , or the business , or the cellars , or the wharf , or something about it. ' ' I think I have heard the business mentioned , sir , ' I said , remembering what I vaguely knew of his and his sister ' s resources .
' You can tell father if you will. ' Then , staying her for a moment , she said , ' It was you who made my room so cheerful , and gave it this look of welcome ? ' ' Oh no , <NAME> , it was done before I came .

Tom-all-Alone 's My <NAME> is restless , very restless .
' So should I , ' said <NAME> , speaking for the first time .
There ' s his full-length portrait , painted by himself and presented to you , warranted a likeness !
Ring merrily for births that make expectants writhe , and marriages that are made in hell , and toll ruefully for the dead whose shoes are worn already !
It could not be doubted that this was the truth .
' Only a man fallen out of a four pair of stairs ' window ; but it ' s a very fair case indeed. ' ' Do you mean that the patient is in a fair way to recover ? ' inquired <NAME> .
' It is not for an old soldier of the <NAME> breed , ' observed the Major , relapsing into a mild state , ' to deliver himself up , a prey to his own emotions ; but -- damme , <NAME> , ' cried the Major , in another spasm of ferocity , ' I condole with you ! ' The <NAME> ' s purple visage deepened in its hue , and the <NAME> ' s lobster eyes stood out in bolder relief , as he shook Mr Dombey by the hand , imparting to that peaceful action as defiant a character as if it had been the prelude to his immediately boxing Mr Dombey for a thousand pounds a side and the championship of <NAME> .
I had only gone out with <NAME> after he was found and given him a little , tiny horse ! -- " and , cousin <NAME> , she softened poor <NAME> , the eldest one , so much and was so thoughtful for me and so amiable !
And she would wait , <NAME> , till she was sixty -- any age you can mention -- for me ! ' <NAME> rose from his chair , and , with a triumphant smile , put his hand upon the white cloth I had observed .
<NAME> , all the world , to this creature of <NAME> !
' I AM miserable , ' returned <NAME> , evidently pouting .
If you had ever seen her sister , you would know her to have been as resolute and haughty as she . "
Standing by the table , with his finger in the page to keep the place , and his right arm flourishing above his head , <NAME> , as <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , or <NAME> , would work himself into the most violent heats , and deliver the most withering denunciations of the profligacy and corruption of my aunt and <NAME> ; while I used to sit , at a little distance , with my notebook on my knee , fagging after him with all my might and main .
I did not understand it .
Having with a grave face touched the wounds upon the head , and the broken arms , he took the hand .
It and I have worn away together .
<NAME> single gentlemen pass and repass -- but there is no invitation for to inquire within or without .
' This is a device to keep him out of the way , ' said Mrs. Sparsit , starting from the dull office window whence she had watched him last .
" I am very much put out about my Ladybird. " " Indeed ? " " For gracious sake say something else besides 'indeed , ' or you 'll fidget me to death , " said <NAME> : whose character ( dissociated from stature ) was shortness .
It ain ' t my father ' s writin ' , ' cept this here signater in print letters ; that ' s his. ' ' Perhaps he got somebody to write it for him , and signed it himself afterwards , ' said the pretty housemaid .
I held his hand for a little while in mine .
They shone in every part of the dance like moons .
Meanwhile , Mr <NAME> , on the top of the stool , drew himself into as flat a shape as possible against the wall , and looked , not unconcernedly , down upon the single gentleman , who appeared at the door growling and cursing in a very awful manner , and , with the boots in his hand , seemed to have an intention of hurling them down stairs on speculation .
It is the <NAME> of <NAME> to him .
They were discussing this question , and were almost building up some weak structure of hope on his prolonged absence , when they heard him on the stairs .
" And we had better be that than a pair of noodles , which we should be if we were doing anything else , for it 's the only way of doing what we want to do .
You understand. ' ' Right as a trivet , sir , ' replied <NAME> , with a wink of intelligence ; and having dragged <NAME> ' s portmanteau from the hind boot , into which it had been hastily thrown when they joined the coach at <NAME> , <NAME> disappeared on his errand .
<NAME> stared , with both his eyes and all his buttons , and his mouth wide open ; but was without loss of time escorted forth by <NAME> , pushed out at the yard gate by the shoulders , and locked out .
' First of all , I ' m a-going to call you <NAME> , for short , ' said <NAME> .
In that one moment , every shadow of doubt or agitation passed away from <NAME> ' s soul .
Seated round the table were four or five boys , none older than the <NAME> , smoking long clay pipes , and drinking spirits with the air of middle-aged men .
The sensation is heightened as the tidings spread from mouth to mouth that the beadle is on the ground and has gone in .
It was tempting to think of that expensive Mercenary publicly airing his boots in the archway of the <NAME> 's posting-yard ; it was almost solemn to imagine him casually produced in the tailor 's shop , and confounding the disrespectful senses of <NAME> 's boy .
Feels very low and melancholy , is very feverish , and has a constant thirst upon him ; thinks it must be the wine he used to drink ( cheers ) .
While his learned friend , <NAME> , massing his papers before him , whispered with those who sat near , and from time to time glanced anxiously at the jury ; while all the spectators moved more or less , and grouped themselves anew ; while even my Lord himself arose from his seat , and slowly paced up and down his platform , not unattended by a suspicion in the minds of the audience that his state was feverish ; this one man sat leaning back , with his torn gown half off him , his untidy wig put on just as it had happened to light on his head after its removal , his hands in his pockets , and his eyes on the ceiling as they had been all day .
' Now , old ' un ! ' cried Fascination , in his light raillery , ' what dodgery are you up to next , sitting there with your eyes shut ?
There is not—there may be—I really don ' t see my way to what I want to say , but I must say it before we part—there is not any other young— ' ' O no , <NAME> !
It makes me giddy to see you ! ' But <NAME> , with a wave of his hand and the deftness of a cat , had already dipped through his scuttle of scarlet runners without breaking a leaf , and ' gone below. ' <NAME> , his bedroom window-blind held aside with his hand , happened at the moment to have <NAME> ' s chambers under his eye for the last time that night .
There seemed to be no hope for him .
These all crowded about their associate as he whispered a few words to the <NAME> ; and then turned round and grinned at <NAME> .
I say I did not resent it , nor did I ; but I showed her , by not gratifying her , that I understood her .
It was nothing , now , that I had accustomed myself to think of her , when we were both mere children , as one who was far removed from my wild fancies .
But that was not to be thought of now , when they sat in the state-equipage with <NAME> on the coach-box .
<NAME> <NAME> had witnessed this process in silent astonishment , when <NAME> , turning sharply upon him , said -- ' I think I ain ' t mistaken when I say your name ' s <NAME> , am I ? ' <NAME> looked at <NAME> ; but , perceiving no encouragement in that gentleman ' s widely-opened eyes to deny his name , said -- ' Yes , my name is <NAME> , Sir. ' ' And that other gentleman ' s <NAME> , I think ? ' said <NAME> .
' It was a bright and sunny morning in the pleasant time of summer , when one of those black monks emerged from the abbey portal , and bent his steps towards the house of the fair sisters .
At some turns of the road , a pale flare on the horizon , like an exhalation from the ruin-sown land , showed that the city was yet far off ; but this poor relief was rare and short-lived .
I can ' t work you into a miscellaneous one , no how .
This is the garden of <NAME> 's <NAME> .
They both know what they want and mean to do .
And then , ' Fetch his daughter. ' On both of which errands , quick messengers depart .
It blows over the -- ha -- Surrey hills .
Because , without having known them , you never can fully know what it is to be stimilated to frenzy by the sight of the Usurper. ' Offering these excusatory words as if they reflected great credit on himself , Mr <NAME> impelled himself with his hands towards a chair in a corner of the room , and there , after a variety of awkward gambols , attained a perpendicular position .
The matter being settled thus , little <NAME> began to cry most piteously , as if he had a foreboding that no good would come of it .
Then she would open it at the place where <NAME> had made it illegible last night , and call <NAME> up , to look at his misdeeds .
But , his long-cherished desire to know more about these matters , not only stopped him in his running away , but lured him back again .
He had half a mind to draw a line or two upon the board , and show himself what he meant .
Can dance , and play music , and sing ?
I know what it is , ' replied the friend .
We shook hands in a very cordial way ; and I laughed and laughed , until I pulled out my pocket-handkerchief and wiped my eyes .
Here was the strong arm of the law , coming down with twenty gold-beater force , upon two offenders from the metropolis itself ; the mighty engine was directed by their own magistrate , and worked by their own officers ; and both the criminals , by their united efforts , were securely shut up , in the narrow compass of one sedan-chair .
it was but wishing that all he held against her in his hand might be flung to the winds and chance-sown in many places .
He has no respect for <NAME> .
It was Saturday , and he had gone to <NAME> .
But wot ' s the good of saying that to you !
' Let me tell you , first , that my friends who have been here to-day , know nothing of it , and that their kindness to you has been quite spontaneous and with no hope of return .
But hold me the while , and stay with me afterwards. ' ' My child !
He wears his usual expressionless mask -- if it be a mask -- and carries family secrets in every limb of his body and every crease of his dress .
I haven ' t got much sense , I know , but if he could be brought to believe that I ' d been a faithful servant to him , doing the best I could , and never meaning harm , perhaps he mightn ' t -- ' Here <NAME> faltered so long that the child entreated him to speak out , and quickly , for it was very late , and time to shut the window .
Who was it who , unaided by his love , regard or notice , thrived and grew beautiful when those so aided died ?
In the same style he presently passed us on the other side of the street , on his way to the aristocratic part of the town , where he was going to show himself among the few other gentlemen left .
" <NAME> ' t weep , mama , or you ' ll make me weep too ! " -- " And me ! " says the favourite servant , rubbing his eyes with his arm .
<NAME> coaches , my lord , are such nasty things , that it ' s almost better to walk at any time , for although I believe a hackney coachman can be transported for life , if he has a broken window , still they are so reckless , that they nearly all have broken windows .
Something must be done with <NAME> too , who at present is -- ha -- barely respectable , barely respectable .
On one chair-back hang the old man 's hairy cap and coat .
Next day the court is all alive -- is like a fair , as Mrs. Perkins , more than reconciled to Mrs. Piper , says in amicable conversation with that excellent woman .
I shall hear the church-clocks strike , as I sit here. ' Very quietly , she placed a chair before the scanty fire , and sat down in it , drawing her shawl about her .
" Naturally there was no end to his tongue then .
Not that I complain , ' he added , in his lively , animated , energetic way .
It is you I come to see. ' ' Me ? ' replied a soft voice .
Nor does it become less prepossessing on a closer acquaintance .
' He always prints , I know , ' cos he learnt writin ' from the large bills in the booking-offices .
I was fully old enough now to be apprenticed to <NAME> ; and when <NAME> sat with the poker on his knees thoughtfully raking out the ashes between the lower bars , my sister would so distinctly construe that innocent action into opposition on his part , that she would dive at him , take the poker out of his hands , shake him , and put it away .
Presently we sat down , side by side ; and her angel-face was turned upon me with the welcome I had dreamed of , waking and sleeping , for whole years .
All offered up sacrifices to the minion of fortune and the worm of the hour ! ' The minion of fortune and the worm of the hour , or in less cutting language , <NAME> , <NAME> , the <NAME> , had become as much at home in his eminently aristocratic family mansion as he was likely ever to be .
Old prints of ships with alphabetical references to their various mysteries , hung in frames upon the walls ; the <NAME> under weigh , was on the plates ; outlandish shells , seaweeds , and mosses , decorated the chimney-piece ; the little wainscotted back parlour was lighted by a sky-light , like a cabin .
' I thought so ! ' said he .
There were holidays at school on other birthdays -- none on mine .
' I won ' t have visitors -- really don ' t want visitors , ' she said ; ' little repose -- and all that sort of thing -- is what I quire .
' Do not mention it. ' ' Then , with your leave , madam , ' resumed Mr Dorrit , ringing his little bell to summon his valet , ' I will send for her at once. ' ' <NAME> wish me to remain ? ' ' Perhaps , if you have no other engagement , you would not object for a minute or two -- ' ' Not at all. ' So , <NAME> the valet was instructed to find <NAME> ' s maid , and to request that subordinate to inform <NAME> that Mr <NAME> wished to see her in his own room .
Across the hall , and up the stairs , and along the passages , and through the rooms , which are very brilliant in the season and very dismal out of it -- fairy-land to visit , but a desert to live in -- the old gentleman is conducted by a <NAME> in powder to my <NAME> 's presence .
' Here you are , sir , ' shouted a strange specimen of the human race , in a sackcloth coat , and apron of the same , who , with a brass label and number round his neck , looked as if he were catalogued in some collection of rarities .
While doing so , the <NAME> eyed his visitors intently , and said in a low voice , ' You see I should have bore down on <NAME> yesterday , and this morning , but she -- she took it away and kept it .
There were some boats and barges astrand in the mud , and these enabled us to come within a few yards of her without being seen .
If <NAME> have a fault , it is the fault of being a trifle too innocent , seeing that the innocence which would go extremely well with a sash and tucker is a little out of keeping with the rouge and pearl necklace .
' From whom you are to exact the intelligence that is to be useful to me ? ' ' Yes , ' said the old woman , nodding again .
There was an execution put into our house , for rent .
cried the voice of the girl whom he had followed .
" It 's eleven o'clock striking by the bell of <NAME> 's .
It was of little moment , indeed , whether they were intelligible or no ; for there was nobody to care for them , had they been ever so plain .
He was a very hard man , and her mother had long been dead .
" <NAME> ! " " I will faithfully , " replied the man , " if you will come with me .
But , dear guardian , you are late too , and look weary .
If I had had any but a unnat'ral wife , and this poor boy had had any but a unnat'ral mother , I might have made some money last week instead of being counter-prayed and countermined and religiously circumwented into the worst of luck .
' <NAME> ' t you think that , ' I asked the coachman , in the first stage out of <NAME> , ' a very remarkable sky ?
And there , my sister was laid quietly in the earth , while the larks sang high above it , and the light wind strewed it with beautiful shadows of clouds and trees .
Not of the family in the present times only , but in the past times too .
' It ' s getting on towards our dinner time you know , ' said <NAME> .
' It ' s so stupid at home , ' she replied , ' and <NAME> is so absurd !
' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' I don ' t think you ' re well .
The officer crossed to <NAME> , and <NAME> went up to <NAME> .
<NAME> was within arm ' s length of <NAME> , when he took such deadly aim at him , that he never spoke .
' Well , ' said the other , ' as much in your confidence as you ever chose to let anybody be. ' ' Ah ! ' rejoined <NAME> , folding his arms ; ' that ' s another thing , quite another thing. ' ' Don ' t let us play upon words , <NAME> , in the name of humanity. ' ' Of what ? ' said <NAME> .
The power of his deportment was such that they really were as much overcome with thankfulness as if , instead of quartering himself upon them for the rest of his life , he were making some munificent sacrifice in their favour .
For example , if <NAME> had the good fortune to get hold of a law recruit , or a country gentleman , and ensnared him to his hospitable villa , <NAME> would say to him , on the morning after his arrival , ' Now , my dear Sir , is there anybody you would like to know ?
Mr <NAME> hinted , to jog his attention : ' You could hardly have been out parrot-shooting , in the <NAME> climate , sir ? ' ' <NAME> , no , no , ' said <NAME> fretfully .
From the gutter he was rescued by <NAME> , and thus the first meeting with <NAME> was inaugurated by the awkward circumstance of their being in possession -- one would say at first sight unlawful possession -- of the orphan , upside down and purple in the countenance .
He wants that <NAME> man. ' ' With whom I saw you in the <NAME> in <NAME> , ' hinted <NAME> .
Think of the needy man who has spent his all , beggared himself , and pinched his friends , to enter the profession , which is destined never to yield him a morsel of bread .
' Please to sit down again , <NAME> , and consider yourself welcome. -- Why , yes , ' said <NAME> , taking a chair , and lifting the elder child upon his knee , that he might have the moral support of speaking to a stranger over his head , ' I have been on the wrong side of the Lock myself , and in that way we come to know <NAME> .
His appearance and manner ; are they so honest ? ' ' Very honest. ' ' And her confidence not to be shaken !
" Well , sir , I suppose it is .
Then the going on again -- so fresh at first , and shortly afterwards so sleepy .
There is a press in the room , but its hinges have not creaked , nor has a step been audible upon the floor .
I was mentioning your perception of my weaknesses .
When nose and moustache had settled into their places again , <NAME> loudly snapped his fingers half-a-dozen times ; bending forward to jerk the snaps at <NAME> , as if they were palpable missiles which he jerked into his face .
Now , you ' re aware -- are you -- that you ' re in possession of property to which you ' ve no right at all ?
<NAME> very well understood that this was held out as an additional inducement to her to preserve the strictest silence regarding the events of the preceding night .
There was something in that third-person style of being spoken to , that <NAME> found particularly recognisant of his merits and position .
She hurried off , and presently we passed her hushing and singing to her child at her own door and looking anxiously along the road for her drunken husband .
Has the picture been engraved , miss ? "
' You have heard it all , and you ' ll not forget it .
His expressions , <NAME> , only yesterday upon the subject of Funerals ! ' ' I am afraid , ' said Mr Dombey , interrupting her testily , ' that some of those persons upstairs suggest improper subjects to the child .
Observing that the hand was pointed to them , <NAME> advanced to listen to their talk .
With Mr <NAME> in my mind , I have been set aside and I have been cast out. ' ' If you give those names to my thanking you for your proposal and declining it , is it my fault , Mr Headstone ? ' said <NAME> , compassionating the bitter struggle he could not conceal , almost as much as she was repelled and alarmed by it .
At last his father disinherited him ; but he softened when he was dying , and left him well off , though not nearly so well off as <NAME> Havisham. -- Take another glass of wine , and excuse my mentioning that society as a body does not expect one to be so strictly conscientious in emptying one 's glass , as to turn it bottom upwards with the rim on one 's nose. " I had been doing this , in an excess of attention to his recital .
<NAME> trees grew in corners of the cellars .
Of course it ' s very pleasant that she should be invited , very pleasant , and I have no doubt that she ' ll conduct herself extremely well ; she always does .
She was crossing a gallery of communication that opened at some little distance on the staircase , and was only lighted on great occasions , when she saw , through the opening , which was an arch , the figure of a man coming down some few stairs opposite .
<NAME> gracious goodness heavins , I 've found him ! '
I omitted to ask the question , but I should think it must have been of about half a pony power .
' After all these years she threatens to desert me in the moment of her coming back again ! ' ' I tell you , mother , for the second time , there have been years for me as well as you , ' said <NAME> .
' The withered chaplet my dear , ' said <NAME> , with great enjoyment , ' is then perished the column is crumbled and the pyramid is standing upside down upon its what ' s-his-name call it not giddiness call it not weakness call it not folly I must now retire into privacy and look upon the ashes of departed joys no more but taking a further liberty of paying for the pastry which has formed the humble pretext of our interview will for ever say Adieu ! ' Mr F. ' s <NAME> , who had eaten her pie with great solemnity , and who had been elaborating some grievous scheme of injury in her mind since her first assumption of that public position on the <NAME> ' s steps , took the present opportunity of addressing the following <NAME> apostrophe to the relict of her late nephew .
Bless his heart ; it 's <NAME> alive again ! "
The carriages in the streets are few , and other late sounds in that neighbourhood there are none , unless a man so very nomadically drunk as to stray into the frigid zone goes brawling and bellowing along the pavement .
After all the trouble that has been taken with you !
<NAME> was represented in a flourishing condition , save tools and weapons ; but , the cutler 's knives and axes were sharp and bright , the smith 's hammers were heavy , and the gunmaker 's stock was murderous .
The jackal then invigorated himself with a bumper for his throttle , and a fresh application to his head , and applied himself to the collection of a second meal ; this was administered to the lion in the same manner , and was not disposed of until the clocks struck three in the morning .
<NAME> raised him so that she could hold him on her bosom , which was what he wanted .
She does not immediately enter , when they have parted , but remains looking after him along the street .
There were , certainly , no particular attractions , either in the room over which the glance of <NAME> so discontentedly wandered , or in the narrow street into which it might have penetrated , if he had thought fit to approach the window .
The family name depends wery much upon you , <NAME> , and I hope you ' ll do wot ' s right by it .
<NAME> <NAME> , <NAME> , what have you been up to , for this many a long day , my ould boy ? ' ' I ' m half blind , <NAME> , ' said the old man , ' and almost deaf and dumb with joy. ' ' His wery woice , ' said the <NAME> , looking round with an exultation to which even his face could hardly render justice -- ' his wery woice as chock full o ' science as ever it was !
' It is short , no doubt , my dear .
We will sit in the church porch till you come back. ' ' A good place too , ' said the schoolmaster , leading the way towards it , disencumbering himself of his portmanteau , and placing it on the stone seat .
You can ' t say more to me than I say to myself .
' It was her father that I got acquainted with first .
Full of that vague kind of penitence which holidays awaken next morning , <NAME> turned out at sunrise , and , with his faith in last night ' s enjoyments a little shaken by cool daylight and the return to every-day duties and occupations , went to meet <NAME> and her mother at the appointed place .
I love little Em ' ly , and I don ' t love <NAME> -- no , not at all in that way -- but I feel that there are goodness , peace , and truth , wherever <NAME> is ; and that the soft light of the coloured window in the church , seen long ago , falls on her always , and on me when I am near her , and on everything around .
I ask you who done it and how you know it .
It was in vain that I asked her for her family name .
asked the sleepy <NAME> , shaking himself pettishly .
' I must , indeed , ' said <NAME> ; ' I promised Bantam. ' ' Oh , wery well , ' said <NAME> ; ' that ' s another thing .
Upon a hasty consideration of the circumstances , it may be matter of surprise to some persons , that <NAME> and Mrs. Squeers should have taken so much trouble to repossess themselves of an incumbrance of which it was their wont to complain so loudly ; but their surprise will cease when they are informed that the manifold services of the drudge , if performed by anybody else , would have cost the establishment some ten or twelve shillings per week in the shape of wages ; and furthermore , that all runaways were , as a matter of policy , made severe examples of , at <NAME> , inasmuch as , in consequence of the limited extent of its attractions , there was but little inducement , beyond the powerful impulse of fear , for any pupil , provided with the usual number of legs and the power of using them , to remain .
' And all friends round <NAME> ' s. ' He emptied and put down the wine-glass half-way through this ancient civic toast , and took up the box .
Your conscience will tell you , sir , whether I construe it well or not. ' ' For <NAME> ' s sake ! ' cried <NAME> , interposing in alarm between them .
And <NAME> went home to brood upon it , and to meditate upon the charms of the unknown young lady , now as far beyond his reach as ever .
She meant the burying ground where the man was buried that took the sleeping-stuff -- that you came home and told us of , <NAME> -- that frightened me so , Mrs. Snagsby .
There is nothing in her manner to express weakness or excite compassion .
They made me laugh again by laughing at each other , and then we all three laughed until I was in danger of crying again .
However , the only thing to be done being to knock at the door , I knocked , and was told from within to enter .
' Come in , come in ! ' said <NAME> .
I have been in this trouble , and that trouble , and shall be again .
Not a person , not a piece of property , not a winder , not a horse , nor a dog , nor a cat , nor a bird , nor a fowl , nor a pig , but what he stoned , for want of an enlightened object .
We shall know full soon .
That he was a suspicious , crabbed , cranky , used-up , J .
' <NAME> , ' said the <NAME> , striking home at once , ' here you are ; a man of mind , and a man as can give an opinion .
The streets are well paved , and lighted with gas ; the houses are large and good ; the shops excellent .
The breakfast languishes when that is done , the violated hatchments are avenged , and <NAME> rises to assume her travelling dress .
what strange things you fancy ! ' ' It wasn ' t fancy , <NAME> , my dear , I ' m certain of that , ' returned her mother .
If you ain ' t imperious with ' em , they won ' t believe in your being any better than themselves , if as good , after the stories ( lies mostly ) that they have heard of your beginnings .
It received such light as it got through a grating of iron bars fashioned like a pretty large window , by means of which it could be always inspected from the gloomy staircase on which the grating gave .
Then I made an excuse to go in with my housekeeping keys , shutting the door after me .
I am going to <NAME> , having friends there .
Regardless of all this : for she had weightier matters at heart : <NAME> followed the man , with trembling limbs , to a small ante-chamber , lighted by a lamp from the ceiling .
Roused at length by the silence , she folded the arms , and with admirable presence of mind looked her friend full in the face , and said interrogatively , ' Ye-es ?
' As soon as that ' s ended , send him about his business. ' ' It shall be done , sir , ' returned <NAME> ; ' by all means .
When all this had been done several times , the <NAME> shook his head and seemed to think the matter had a bad look .
Stopping to look at nothing , but seeing all I did see as I went , I was passing quickly on , and in a few moments should have passed the lighted window , when my echoing footsteps brought it suddenly into my mind that there was a dreadful truth in the legend of the <NAME> 's <NAME> , that it was I who was to bring calamity upon the stately house and that my warning feet were haunting it even then .
<NAME> , he observes that she has journeyed a long distance and is footsore and travel-stained .
<NAME> <NAME> saw losing cards in it that <NAME> knew nothing of .
These are the <NAME> 's impressions , my dear , all over <NAME> -- the children know them ! "
<NAME> ; he irritated it , with a kind of perverse pleasure akin to that which a sick man sometimes has in irritating a wound upon his body .
Sit down , there ' s a dear young man , and let me tell you all about it. ' <NAME> needed no second invitation , and eagerly inquired what was the news .
You von ' t think o ' arrestin ' your own son for the money , and sendin ' him off to the <NAME> , will you , you unnat ' ral wagabone ? ' At this reply of <NAME> ' s , the father and son exchanged a complete code of telegraph nods and gestures , after which , the elder <NAME> sat himself down on a stone step and laughed till he was purple .
' That was the treatment , you see .
Is it really , though ? ' I replied that I liked it well enough , but that I certainly could not claim so much for it .
The attention and distinction you have so impressively mentioned , <NAME> , as attaching to this confidence , are , I have no doubt , of the most complimentary and gratifying description ; but they don ' t at all proceed from me .
The back is <NAME> 's bedroom , and in it she 's a-carrying on , poor thing , to a frightful extent ! "
' Now , <NAME> , ' said the <NAME> , doggedly , when he , at length , caught Mr Toots ' s eye , ' I want to know whether this here gammon is to finish it , or whether you ' re a going in to win ? ' ' Chicken , ' returned Mr Toots , ' explain yourself. ' ' Why then , here ' s all about it , <NAME> , ' said the <NAME> .
If it were my brother who had committed it , I would not spare him . "
And if you ain ' t the gentleman I took you for , may be my mind has call to be uneasy .
inquired the lawyer in a low voice .
It ain ' t much to boast of , genteel as his own is .
" My dear <NAME> , " said he , shaking his head pleasantly , " I do n't know .
' When I was very young , ' said <NAME> , ' quite a little child , my first associations with knowledge of any kind were inseparable from a patient friend and teacher -- the friend of my dead father -- who was always dear to me .
There ' s not such a spring in <NAME> as the pump under the archway .
'Look how he stares , <NAME> !
This was not lost on the speaker .
Below the table , again , was a long row of solicitors , with bundles of papers on the matting at their feet ; and then there were the gentlemen of the bar in wigs and gowns -- some awake and some asleep , and one talking , and nobody paying much attention to what he said .
There were afternoon times when she was unemployed , when visitors dropped in to play a hand at cards with her father , when she could be spared and was better away .
I think <NAME> may be gradually falling into trouble , and I wish to stretch out a helping hand to him from the depths of my wicked experience.—Shall I say again , for his sake ?
This narration ended , Mr <NAME> put some questions to Kit respecting his qualifications and general acquirements , while <NAME> noticed the children , and hearing from <NAME> ' s mother certain remarkable circumstances which had attended the birth of each , related certain other remarkable circumstances which had attended the birth of her own son , Mr Abel , from which it appeared that both Kit ' s mother and herself had been , above and beyond all other women of what condition or age soever , peculiarly hemmed in with perils and dangers .
Besides , they know where to find you , and I represent you .
A man was certainly not old at forty ; and many men were not in circumstances to marry , or did not marry , until they had attained that time of life .
Respecting the quiet tea , my dear , why you see the occupations of the day are sometimes a little wearing ; and if there ' s nothing interposed between the day and your mother , why <NAME> is sometimes a little wearing , too. ' ' I know , Pa. ' ' Yes , my dear .
' I ' ll dispose of him so , then , Mr Gills , ' he answered , rising , and shaking the old man by the hand , ' until I make up my mind what to do with him , and what he deserves .
' What I dwell upon most , ' says <NAME> , pursuing his subject of romantic interest , ' is the remarkable accuracy with which you would seem to find out where people are buried.—What is the matter ?
<NAME> <NAME> kept his eyes fixed on his visitor during its narration , and directly it was concluded , took the word again .
So he remains for a minute or two , heaped up against it , and then staggers down the shop to the front door .
There was <NAME> , deceased ; there was <NAME> , deceased ; and there was Jo , deceased ; and they were " all in it . "
I endeavoured to hit a happy medium between these two extremes ; my aunt approved the result ; and <NAME> threw one of his shoes after <NAME> and me , for luck , as we went downstairs .
It wants constant attention in the littlest things .
<NAME> <NAME> kissed the young lady with the black eyes , and <NAME> kissed <NAME> ; and <NAME> , not being particular about the form of being under the mistletoe , kissed <NAME> and the other female servants , just as he caught them .
The only spark of encouragement in the case , was , that my hand upon the sufferer 's breast had this much soothing influence , that for minutes at a time it tranquillised the figure .
that ' s not enough ! ' she cried .
One Christmas time , when yonder solitary child was left here all alone , he did come , for the first time , just like that .
There was no reason , however , why I should refrain from seeing the person who had inconsiderately sent her to so great a distance by night and alone , and as it was not improbable that if she found herself near home she might take farewell of me and deprive me of the opportunity , I avoided the most frequented ways and took the most intricate , and thus it was not until we arrived in the street itself that she knew where we were .
I was just giving you up , sir , and going home . "
I often walked past it afterwards , and never for a long time without thinking of him and half expecting to meet him .
" I communicate to him that secret .
' Once I was in earnest , I tell you that , for I had more than half a mind to swear he uttered threats , and demanded my life or my money. ' ' Oho ! ' said <NAME> , eyeing him askew .
And having now got the <NAME> between himself and <NAME> , he began to feel safe , and to find that the foreign air was lighter to breathe than the air of <NAME> .
she asked , after they had walked a few hundred yards .
I have fear of this man .
' Come ! ' cried the subject of this admiration , returning .
' This is indeed an unexpected pleasure !
He ' d be sharper than a serpent ' s tooth , if he wasn ' t as dull as ditch water .
' Well , sir , ' said <NAME> , with the profound solemnity with which that great man could , when he pleased , render his remarks so deeply impressive .
What have I been and done ?
<NAME> proceeds to tell him all he knows about Jo , unto which the trooper listens with a grave face .
Did I not , <NAME> ? ' ' Well , never mind that now , ' said the boy .
I was so curious to know , that I made up my mind to have it out with <NAME> .
" That 's no question as it stands , you know. " " Will soon come to <NAME> , " said I , after casting about for a precise form of words , " or summon me anywhere else ? " " Now , here , " replied <NAME> , fixing me for the first time with his dark deep-set eyes , " we must revert to the evening when we first encountered one another in your village .
" He is changed , " he returned , shaking his head .
Now , I come to the cruel part of the story , -- merely breaking off , my dear <NAME> , to remark that a dinner-napkin will not go into a tumbler. " Why I was trying to pack mine into my tumbler , I am wholly unable to say .
The gushing fountains which sparkle in the sun , must not be stopped in mere caprice ; the oasis in the desert of <NAME> must not be plucked up idly. ' I hardly knew what I did , I was burning all over to that extraordinary extent ; but I took <NAME> ' s little hand and kissed it -- and she let me !
' Much better too , I hope ? ' <NAME> turned his eyes towards <NAME> , as if to spare her , and answered nothing .
' Then I am delighted to say , ' cried <NAME> , beaming with joy , ' that we have recovered the whole money ! ' ' <NAME> ' t congratulate me , anybody ! ' exclaimed my aunt .
He had turned the cuffs back , half-way up his arm , to get his hands out of the sleeves : apparently with the ultimate view of thrusting them into the pockets of his corduroy trousers ; for there he kept them .
" You ought to do it of yourself , " <NAME> answers ; " I know that very well , Mrs. Bagnet .
<NAME> educates ' em. ' ' The second daughter , perhaps ? ' I hazarded .
It ain ' t -- ain ' t catching. ' <NAME> murmured that she had something to do in her own room , and went away upstairs .
Your brother favours me to the utmost , and it is likely that we might live and work together ; anyhow , it is certain that he would have my best influence and support .
Not a cousin of the batch but is really indignant , and connects it with the feebleness of <NAME> when in office , and really does feel deprived of a stake in the country -- or the pension list -- or something -- by fraud and wrong .
" Yet would you believe that it 's HIS name on the door-plate ? "
It is a way he has sometimes .
I have a light hand ; and if I have been seen apparently to correct <NAME> in that manner , I have done it almost playfully. ' If the playfulness of <NAME> Rigaud were at all expressed by his smile at this point , the relations of <NAME> might have said that they would have much preferred his correcting that unfortunate woman seriously .
I was jealous of everybody .
I am old in years , and older still in misery and care .
Thus , the flush of the day , in its heat and light , would gradually decline ; and again the golden water would be dancing on the wall .
It is quite a bower in the summer-time .
They were clean and new , and I spread them out and handed them over to him .
And at night , you urge me , with great mystery , to start before the ladies are stirring ; the consequence of which is , that young Oliver here is pinned down to his breakfast when he ought to be ranging the meadows after botanical phenomena of all kinds .
' It looks as if the old man ' s spirit had found rest at last ; don ' t it ? ' said <NAME> .
' Only you ! ' cried the dwarf , stretching his neck to obtain a better view of his visitor .
When they were all wearied out , and could tear and beat no longer , they dragged <NAME> , struggling and shouting , but nothing daunted , into the dust-cellar , and there locked him up .
His daughter , turning the bracelet on her arm , and now looking at him , and now looking from him , said , ' Very well , papa .
Moreover , I have done no wrong , and have injured no man .
' Yes , <NAME> , it ' s me , ' said <NAME> , ' and I wish it wasn ' t , though I may not seem to flatter when I say so , but little <NAME> is very ill , and told his Pa today that he would like to see the face of his old nurse , and him and <NAME> hope you ' ll come along with me -- and Mr Walter , <NAME> -- forgetting what is past , and do a kindness to the sweet dear that is withering away .
He was requested to place himself in communication with Mr Mortimer Lightwood , as a possible means of furthering the ends of justice , and a reward was offered to any one acquainted with his whereabout who would communicate the same to the said Mr Mortimer Lightwood at his office in the Temple .
<NAME> age , and vigorous life , and blooming youth , and helpless infancy , poured forth -- on crutches , in the pride of strength and health , in the full blush of promise , in the mere dawn of life -- to gather round her tomb .
I know it does. ' Of <NAME> and <NAME> .
Now what are you going to do ?
Now , if your pretty granddaughter -- excuse me , miss -- will condescend to take care of this pipe for two months , we shall save the cost of one next time .
I doubt if she could have been induced to desert her post , by anyone else .
I kept my resentment to myself ; but I knew very well that it was her way of petting the knowledge that she was my <NAME> , and might have behaved differently to her servant if it had been her fancy .
'My name is <NAME> , sir , ' replied the little invalid : with a look of great astonishment .
<NAME> , ' screamed the dwarf , ' I ' ll be a bachelor in earnest. ' ' You can ' t be serious , <NAME> , ' sobbed his wife .
What should I ever do without you ! ' ' Me leave you , my precious ! ' cried <NAME> .
I should forget how to wear a whole coat now .
' First , he wants some water , ' said he , looking round .
The spy had kept his eyes open , but had been able to detect no sign .
' I 'll eat my head , sir , ' repeated <NAME> , striking his stick upon the ground .
' Ven the lady and gen ' l ' m ' n as keeps the hot-el first begun business , they used to make the beds on the floor ; but this wouldn ' t do at no price , ' cos instead o ' taking a moderate twopenn ' orth o ' sleep , the lodgers used to lie there half the day .
I fear you spoke to me ? ' ' I said , ' remarked <NAME> , a little louder than before , ' it was a fine day. ' ' I beg your pardon .
This gentleman , ' said <NAME> , pointing out the apple-faced man , ' is the father .
' Who says so ? ' cried <NAME> , rising from his knee and confronting them , but still retaining <NAME> ' s lifeless hand in his .
Well ; might you be acquainted with my middle finger , the T ' other ? ' ' I know quite as much of him , ' said <NAME> , with a frown and a distant look before him , ' as I want to know. ' ' Hooroar ! ' cried the man .
This was frequently their theme of conversation .
In consideration of this eminent public service , the <NAME> then in power had recommended the <NAME> to bestow a pension of two or three hundred a-year on his widow ; to which the next Barnacle in power had added certain shady and sedate apartments in the Palaces at <NAME> , where the old lady still lived , deploring the degeneracy of the times in company with several other old ladies of both sexes .
Then he guesses that you don ' t travel faster in <NAME> ; and on your replying that you do , says ' Yes ? ' again ( still interrogatively ) , and it is quite evident , don ' t believe it .
I was made very uneasy in my mind by Mrs. <NAME> 's falling into a discussion with <NAME> respecting two baronetcies , while she ate a sliced orange steeped in sugar and wine , and , forgetting all about the baby on her lap , who did most appalling things with the nut-crackers .
I ' ve had my dinner. ' ' You dine early , sir , ' said the powdered-headed footman .
<NAME> said what anything was , but everybody said what the Mrs Generals , Mr Eustace , or somebody else said it was .
He knew me better than I knew myself .
" I am very glad to go there , sir , " I answered .
Many a night he vaguely and unhappily wandered there , when wine had brought no transitory gladness to him ; many a dreary daybreak revealed his solitary figure lingering there , and still lingering there when the first beams of the sun brought into strong relief , removed beauties of architecture in spires of churches and lofty buildings , as perhaps the quiet time brought some sense of better things , else forgotten and unattainable , into his mind .
When one of 'em says to another , 'He was a convict , a few year ago , and is a ignorant common fellow now , for all he 's lucky , ' what do I say ?
" My time is nearly gone . "
" Darn me if I could n't eat em , " said the man , with a threatening shake of his head , " and if I ha n't half a mind to't ! " I earnestly expressed my hope that he would n't , and held tighter to the tombstone on which he had put me ; partly , to keep myself upon it ; partly , to keep myself from crying .
He told me that what she had said of being here , and there , and everywhere , was true enough ; for she made little darts into the provinces , and seemed to pick up customers everywhere , and to know everybody .
I was a nuisance , an incumbrance , and a pest .
As if this were not bad enough for me , the boys , connecting me with the establishment , on account of the patience and perseverance with which I sat outside , half-dressed , pelted me , and used me very ill all day .
My mind is a blank , from some time -- I can not even say what time -- when I employed myself , in my captivity , in making shoes , to the time when I found myself living in <NAME> with my dear daughter here .
It was a perfectly decent room , half parlour and half kitchen , but not at all a snug room .
' I was quite at your disposition .
" Even if I have grown so much wiser , what then ?
' Is anybody else a-goin ' , <NAME> ? ' said Mrs. Cluppins , arranging her pelerine .
You don ' t know how wet and cold I am , or how many times I have lost my way in coming here through this thick fog .
Quite alarmed at being the only recipient of this untimely visit , and the only spectator of this portentous behaviour , I exclaimed again , ' Pray tell me , <NAME> , what is the matter !
' Damn that boy , he ' s always at something of that sort. ' ' Never was such a boy , I do believe , ' said Mrs. Squeers ; ' whatever he has is always catching too .
And soon the young couple go out of the <NAME> ' <NAME> , taking all precautions against the discovery of the so vitally defective boots of <NAME> : precautions , let us hope , effective for the peace of Mrs. Edwin Drood that is to be .
' You are very good , ' said <NAME> .
Then only was he permitted to be seen , spectacularly poring over large books , and casting his breeches and gaiters into the general weight of the establishment .
These two causes made him answer in a very low and hesitating voice ; whereupon a gentleman in a white waistcoat said he was a fool .
there are times when ignorance is bliss indeed .
' You have done a stealthy and unbecoming action , <NAME> .
' Why do you bring your prolifigate companions here ?
There was something in <NAME> ' s manner that was not to be resisted , and so <NAME> complied with the invitation ; and after a great deal of blushing on his part , and immoderate laughter on that of the wicked little cousin , <NAME> went down on his knees on the dewy grass , and declared his resolution to remain there for ever , unless he were permitted to rise the accepted lover of <NAME> .
' It shall be brought round in any way it likes best , and not brought round at all if it likes that better , ' retorted <NAME> , with his egg-spoon in his mouth .
' What on earth has anybody to do with the -- with the -- Bones of my son ?
I seem , then , to be worthier of the eldest Miss Larkins .
' I am disappointed myself , ' said <NAME> , ' out of mere friendly feeling for them ; but you have real reasons , private reasons I have no doubt , for your disappointment , and therefore it comes heavier than mine. ' ' Why , of course it does , ' <NAME> observed , testily .
by <NAME> , it ' s quite Minervian. ' ' It ' ll look well enough when it comes to be finished , ' observed Mrs Jarley .
He lighted a candle , set out his little tea-board , got hot water from below , and brought in small portions of tea and sugar , a loaf , and some butter from the nearest shop .
" Take <NAME> 's written order , and pay him twenty pounds. " This strongly marked way of doing business made a strongly marked impression on me , and that not of an agreeable kind .
Engines at pits ' mouths , and lean old horses that had worn the circle of their daily labour into the ground , were alike quiet ; wheels had ceased for a short space to turn ; and the great wheel of earth seemed to revolve without the shocks and noises of another time .
As to whether your name is <NAME> , or <NAME> ? " The official turned towards him with sudden distrust .
' He never loved me ; he never loved <NAME> , who is next door but one to a cherubim .
<NAME> guineas , tea and sugar , and servants allowed to see male cousins , if godly .
" Well ? " cried my sister , addressing us both at once .
' With which object in view , <NAME> , ' said Mr <NAME> gravely , ' I shall ask your ladyship ' s permission to put the board in my pocket , and to retire from the presence when I have finished this tankard ; merely observing , <NAME> , that since life like a river is flowing , I care not how fast it rolls on , ma ' am , on , while such purl on the bank still is growing , and such eyes light the waves as they run .
' I will remain here to light you up the stairs .
I -- a -- I ' ll know nobody -- and -- a -- say nothing -- and -- a -- live nowhere -- until I have crushed -- to -- a -- undiscoverable atoms -- the -- transcendent and immortal hypocrite and perjurer -- HEEP ! ' I really had some fear of <NAME> ' s dying on the spot .
Perhaps , to observe whether he had any spectre on his conscience .
Then the curtain moved more perceptibly , and the woman in the bed put it back , and sat up .
Over this bib her dimples looked delightful , and under it her pretty figure not less so .
And of course I should. ' The subject of their dispute , who had seated himself , laughed aloud , and rapped his legs with his hand .
You went down to the river together ? ' ' Undoubtedly .
Not caring what she thought of you ( and <NAME> knows <NAME> was of no consequence ! )
' How much have we in hand ? ' ' Very little indeed , ' replied <NAME> .
' Then it was their own fault , ' said Mr Podsnap .
I can not bear ' t nommore .
' I can ' t speak to you just now , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
<NAME> all your pockets inside out , and leave ' em so ! ' cried the person of the house .
The old man lifted up his eyes once more to the little eyes in Mr Fledgeby ' s head , with some reviving hope that the sign might be coming yet .
Curse me ! ' Unwilling to hazard another quarrel , <NAME> gladly assented to the proposition , and consigned the money to <NAME> , who , as it was nearly eleven o ' clock , lost no time in repairing to the coffee-room on his errand .
It added in a postscript that I would not be many hours from <NAME> .
To see how she operated upon him with a pen-knife !
' You don ' t say more than the truth when you say that , ' replied Squeers .
' For <NAME> ' s sake consider my deplorable condition ; and , while I promise to take no step without taking counsel with you , give me , at least , a vote in my own behalf. ' Moved by this entreaty , <NAME> stammered forth a variety of most unaccountable and entangled sentences , the upshot of which was , that Mrs. <NAME> had examined him , at great length that morning , touching the origin of his acquaintance with , and the whole life , adventures , and pedigree of , <NAME> ; that <NAME> had parried these questions as long as he could , but being , at length , hard pressed and driven into a corner , had gone so far as to admit , that <NAME> was a tutor of great accomplishments , involved in some misfortunes which he was not at liberty to explain , and bearing the name of <NAME> .
I know perfectly well why you have been taking such an interest in this Mrs Gowan .
<NAME> lay there , any longer , but the ruin of the mortal house on which the rain had beaten , and the black hair that had fluttered in the wintry wind .
Why the—Devil , I was going to say , if it had been respectful to their memory—couldn ' t they leave us alone ? ' ' <NAME> , tut , dear boy , ' <NAME> remonstrates , in a tone of gentle deprecation .
The bed had not been lain on , but was smooth and empty .
At last they came into a maze of dust , where a quantity of people were tumbling over one another , and where there was such a confusion of unaccountable shapes of beams , bulkheads , brick walls , ropes , and rollers , and such a mixing of gaslight and daylight , that they seemed to have got on the wrong side of the pattern of the universe .
I will engage that you shall be , and even that young Drood shall make the first advance .
' Similarly , it was through Mr Lightwood that you ever saw her again , for you were with him on the night when my father was found , and so I found you with her on the next day .
' <NAME> to your names , gentlemen , that you may be sworn , ' said the gentleman in black .
'It was the <NAME> , I tell you .
' _Can _you ! ' repeated <NAME> , with a smile of pity .
" But I may ask you a question , <NAME> ? "
Here I sit at the desk again , on a drowsy summer afternoon .
By degrees his attention grew more and more attracted by the objects around him ; and at last he derived as much enjoyment from the ride , as if it had been undertaken for the pleasantest reason in the world .
He was well dressed , of a sprightly and gay appearance , a well-knit figure , and a rich dark complexion .
When not doing so himself , he may have some informant skulking about , in the person of a watchman , porter , or such-like hanger-on of <NAME> .
' Of course he proposed it , but how did it all come about ?
I do n't know nothink about nothink at all . "
I think an inn is a good sort of a place to propose to a single woman in , <NAME> .
The boy , who in the midst of his astonishment could not help staring wildly at the gentleman with so many white teeth who was choking him , and at the office walls , as though determined , if he were choked , that his last look should be at the mysteries for his intrusion into which he was paying such a severe penalty , at last contrived to utter -- ' Come , <NAME> !
Her constant nature turned to him in his distress , as fervently and faithfully , as if , in his prosperity , he had been the embodiment of that idea which had gradually become so faint and dim .
' And very good ones too , I believe , haven ' t they ? ' asked the married lady .
Speaking of daughters , I have seen <NAME> Dombey. ' There was a sudden rush of blood to Mr <NAME> ' s face .
Is it <NAME> , <NAME> ? ' ' Well ; yes it is. ' ' Yes !
What do you mean by it ? ' ' It ain ' t my fault. ' ' Could you eat any bread and meat ? ' said <NAME> , taking down his hat .
<NAME> little presents to Mrs. Nickleby , always of the very things they most required , tended in no slight degree to the improvement and embellishment of the cottage .
The <NAME> of <NAME> To Come conveyed him , as before -- though at a different time , he thought : indeed , there seemed no order in these latter visions , save that they were in the <NAME> -- into the resorts of business men , but showed him not himself .
Like the notes of a fiddle , you sweetly , sir , sweetly , Raises our spirits and charms our ears. " Good-night , sir. ' ' I shall have a word or two to say to you , Mr Wegg , before long , ' remarked <NAME> , ' respecting my share in the project we ' ve been speaking of. ' ' My time , sir , ' returned <NAME> , ' is yours .
<NAME> got upon the box , and gave the word " To the <NAME> ! " The postilion cracked his whip , and they clattered away under the feeble over-swinging lamps .
" Did you think of walking down to Walworth ? " said he .
Can you make a honourable lady of her ? "
Say there is anything again earning it. " This I put to myself strong , as in duty bound ; " how can it be said without blaming <NAME> for offering it to be earned ? " And was it for ME to blame <NAME> ?
But what put marriage in your head ? ' ' I don ' t know ! -- You mustn ' t marry more than one person at a time , may you , <NAME> ? ' ' Certainly not , ' says <NAME> , with the promptest decision .
' In the act , my dear <NAME> , ' repeated Mrs. Markleham , spreading the newspaper on her lap like a table-cloth , and patting her hands upon it , ' of making his last <NAME> and <NAME> .
' Yes. ' ' O , I could never go there any more .
It was quite exhilarating to hear the clash and bustle with which he banged the door and jumped up behind after Mrs. <NAME> was in ; and as that good lady was perfectly unconscious that he applied the gold-headed end of his long stick to his nose , and so telegraphed most disrespectfully to the coachman over her very head , she sat in a state of much stiffness and dignity , not a little proud of her position .
He put it aside by merely repeating that he had a high regard for Mr Doyce .
On the whole , I would recommend you to take to <NAME> ' Commons kindly , <NAME> .
We have lived plainly enough here , <NAME> and I .
Up one minute and down the next ; now in spirits and now in despondency ! " " Ah ! " returned the other , sighing : " yes !
It was a little idea of mine .
But <NAME> has lived in the world , <NAME> : lived in the world with his eyes open , <NAME> , and his ears cocked : and <NAME> tells you , <NAME> , that there ' s a devilish artful and ambitious woman over the way. ' Mr Dombey involuntarily glanced over the way ; and an angry glance he sent in that direction , too .
I ' ll not meddle ; don ' t mind me. ' To get her brother out of the prison ; out of the succession to Mrs Bangham in executing commissions , and out of the slang interchange with very doubtful companions consequent upon both ; was her hardest task .
" You are impanelled here to inquire into the death of a certain man .
' Thank you , ' replied <NAME> , showing all his teeth .
' I was not present myself , ' replied the visitor , ' and in consequence of your firm refusal to give your card to <NAME> , I was desired by that gentleman to identify the wearer of a very uncommon coat -- a bright blue dress-coat , with a gilt button displaying a bust , and the letters <NAME> actually staggered with astonishment as he heard his own costume thus minutely described .
Soon afterwards , came a slamming and banging of doors ; and then came running down stairs , a gentleman with whiskers , and out of breath , who seemed to be red-hot .
But , astounded as he was by the apparition of the dwarf among the <NAME> , and not free from a misgiving that it was the forerunner of some trouble or annoyance , he was compelled to subdue his wonder and to take active measures for the withdrawal of his parent , as the evening was now creeping on , and the matter grew serious .
The old lady nearly blowed us into shivers and smithers , many times. ' ' Why ? ' asked <NAME> .
' I lost the boy , and no efforts of mine could recover him .
So , when the words were all spoken , he too kneeled on one knee on the grass , and the two men looked at one another .
In his dear <NAME> ' s name and in his own , thank you !
You know what they are ? ' ' Oh yes , I know what they are , ' said <NAME> .
' I ' ve a little something to trouble you with , Sir. ' ' Me ! ' exclaimed <NAME> .
He wore the blue bag in the manner of my great-coat , and was strutting along the pavement towards me on the opposite side of the street , attended by a company of delighted young friends to whom he from time to time exclaimed , with a wave of his hand , " Do n't know yah ! " Words can not state the amount of aggravation and injury wreaked upon me by <NAME> 's boy , when passing abreast of me , he pulled up his shirt-collar , twined his side-hair , stuck an arm akimbo , and smirked extravagantly by , wriggling his elbows and body , and drawling to his attendants , " Do n't know yah , do n't know yah , 'pon my soul do n't know yah ! " The disgrace attendant on his immediately afterwards taking to crowing and pursuing me across the bridge with crows , as from an exceedingly dejected fowl who had known me when I was a blacksmith , culminated the disgrace with which I left the town , and was , so to speak , ejected by it into the open country .
Then as I sit a-looking at the fire , I seem to see in the burning coal -- like where that glow is now -- ' ' That ' s gas , that is , ' said the boy , ' coming out of a bit of a forest that ' s been under the mud that was under the water in the days of <NAME> ' s <NAME> .
Yet in that same moment he was the Secretary also , Mr <NAME> ' s Secretary .
How could they help it !
Then <NAME> hung upon her father and nursed his cheek against hers as if he were some poor dull child in pain .
But <NAME> saw her , I have no doubt , in Mrs. Gradgrind ' s presence. ' ' Pray , Mrs. Gradgrind , ' said <NAME> , ' what passed ? ' ' Oh , my poor health ! ' returned Mrs. Gradgrind .
Mr Carker in his own office was the first step ; Mr Morfin , in his own office , was the second .
Are you in the <NAME> , or where are you ?
" <NAME> me directly what you 've been doing to wear me away with fret and fright and worrit , or I 'd have you out of that corner if you was fifty Pips , and he was five hundred Gargerys. " " I have only been to the churchyard , " said I , from my stool , crying and rubbing myself .
As it was , she had no such vent : she could only ponder on her own difficulties , and wonder more and more why this avoidance of <NAME> ' s name should last , now that she knew—for so much <NAME> had told her—that a good understanding was to be reëstablished between the two young men , when <NAME> came down .
you , of course , ' said <NAME> .
But I leave the ole to you , Mr Boffin. ' ' Come ! ' said Mr Boffin .
And get on , my lads ! "
' It is not funny at all. ' ' Oh ! ' said <NAME> , with all possible humility .
I felt myself quite a proctor when I read this document aloud with all possible ceremony , and set forth its provisions , any number of times , to those whom they concerned .
Then who so blest and happy as <NAME> , saving and excepting Mr <NAME> !
' Hip , hip , hip , and nine times nine , and one to finish with , and all that , understood .
The horse no sooner beheld <NAME> advancing towards him with the chaise whip in his hand , than he exchanged the rotary motion in which he had previously indulged , for a retrograde movement of so very determined a character , that it at once drew <NAME> , who was still at the end of the bridle , at a rather quicker rate than fast walking , in the direction from which they had just come .
For a moment only ; but with a transient gleam of scornful wonder on her face , not lost on one observer , who was smiling round the board .
He begins quite to amuse our little party .
' Such a fresh , blooming , modest little bud , neighbour , ' said <NAME> , nursing his short leg , and making his eyes twinkle very much ; ' such a chubby , rosy , cosy , little <NAME> ! ' The old man answered by a forced smile , and was plainly struggling with a feeling of the keenest and most exquisite impatience .
" I will prove you , " repeats mademoiselle in her former whisper .
When you wouldn ' t give me nothing .
He will find some specimens there , by no means remarkable to any man who has been in <NAME> , but sufficiently striking to one who has not .
'Your master 's not at home ; there 's not a man in the house , and he 'll kick that door down in ten minutes . '
Perhaps you ' re mistaken , and never wrote any. ' ' He hadn ' t been gone from here , young lady , ' said <NAME> , turning appealingly to <NAME> , ' as much as a week , when he sent me the only letter I have had from him , saying that he was forced to seek work in another name. ' ' Oh , by <NAME> ! ' cried <NAME> , shaking his head , with a whistle , ' he changes his name , does he !
In my dread of the end of the vacation and their coming back , I could not read a boy ' s name , without inquiring in what tone and with what emphasis HE would read , ' <NAME> care of him .
Both as to his dress and to himself , he was of an overlapping rhinoceros build , with folds in his cheeks , and his forehead , and his eyelids , and his lips , and his ears ; but with bright , eager , childishly-inquiring , grey eyes , under his ragged eyebrows , and broad-brimmed hat .
If you had been more mindful of yourself , and less of me , when we grew up here together , I think my heedless fancy never would have wandered from you .
' Perhaps you are right , uncle , ' replied Mrs. <NAME> , submissively .
Not even to try to make some amends ? ' ' You are such a dreamer , ' said the boy , with his former petulance .
She could distribute , and did distribute pretty looks and smiles to every one among them .
Oliver retained his stool by the fire ; <NAME> wrapped in a blanket , stretched himself on the floor : close outside the fender .

<NAME> drew the little packet from his breast , where he had hurriedly thrust it ; and tying it to a leaden weight , which had formed a part of some pulley , and was lying on the floor , dropped it into the stream .
He was so far the creature of circumstances , that a dry day covered him with dust , and a misty day peppered him with little bits of soot , and a wet day brightened up his tarnished uniform for the moment , and a very hot day blistered him ; but otherwise he was a callous , obdurate , conceited Midshipman , intent on his own discoveries , and caring as little for what went on about him , terrestrially , as <NAME> at the taking of <NAME> .

He stopped at a door .
Among the mighty store of wonderful chains that are for ever forging , day and night , in the vast iron-works of time and circumstance , there was one chain forged in the moment of that small conclusion , riveted to the foundations of heaven and earth , and gifted with invincible force to hold and drag .

<NAME> alone talked steadily and evenly .
<NAME> of an unfortunate father , but -- ha -- always a gentleman .
And rising quietly , and glancing at them with a look that was a little alarmed but perfectly confiding , left the room .
' Will you please to read it ? ' ' But first of all , ' said <NAME> , ' -- did you ever taste shrub , child ? ' <NAME> shook her head .
I should have committed murder -- I know I should -- if we 'd caught one of them rascals . '
He had now done all he sought to do for the present , except that he wished to leave her with a reliance upon him , and to have something like a promise from her that she would cherish it .
He obtruded himself upon us in the first instance .
It ' s the only truth going ! ' This vicious assumption of honesty in dishonesty—a vice so dangerous , so deadly , and so common—seemed , he observed , a little to impress her in his favour .
And you quite a small party then , yourself .
Becoming immediately sensible of the impropriety , he poked the fire , and extinguished the last frail spark for ever .
" Rents ARE high about here .
If my character , and my now dropping you , help me out of that , Mr Headstone , the deliverance is to be attributed to me , and not to you .
" They exchanged looks , but bent their heads to me as I bent mine to them , and we parted without another word on either side .
On the afternoon of a certain fine Sunday when the waves of four months had rolled over the trial for treason , and carried it , as to the public interest and memory , far out to sea , <NAME> walked along the sunny streets from <NAME> where he lived , on his way to dine with the Doctor .
' Does anybody down there know what has happened ? ' demanded <NAME> , in her voice of authority .
' I have gone on day after day , ' said <NAME> , bending over him , and timidly placing her little hand in his , ' in the hope that this persecution would cease ; I have gone on day after day , compelled to assume the appearance of cheerfulness , when I was most unhappy .
Your day is past , and night is comin ' on. ' ' My curse , my bitter , deadly curse , upon you , boy ! ' ' Whence will curses come at your command ?
He was not put into better humour either , by the reflection that he had taken it into his head , early in the evening , to think he had got an ache there , and so stopped at home .
' What an extraordinary thing it is , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , rather pettishly , ' that you couldn ' t have taken your place before. ' ' Not at all extraordinary , ' said <NAME> .
He also follows with his eyes , the toss of <NAME> ' s head : as if to seek a direction to over yonder .
There are offices about the <NAME> of <NAME> in which a man might be cool , if any coolness were worth purchasing at such a price in dullness ; but the little thoroughfares immediately outside those retirements seem to blaze .
They were garish in taste and colour , but were expensive articles of drawing-room furniture that had a very odd look beside the settles and the flaring gaslight pendent from the ceiling .
" I 'm sure I 'm surprised at that .
You took her for better for worse. ' ' I mun ' be ridden o ' her .
It may have been a mistaken one , or you may have ceased to justify it .
I belong to the <NAME> ; so , if you go straight up without me ( I was sent to fetch you ) , you ' ll save me a walk. ' <NAME> , whose way had been in the contrary direction , turned about , and betook himself as in duty bound , to the red brick castle of the giant <NAME> .
' Very much admired , indeed , the young woman was .
I can understand a man ' s dying of a broken neck , or suffering from a broken arm , or a broken head , or a broken leg , or a broken nose ; but a broken heart ! -- nonsense , it ' s the cant of the day .
<NAME> left alone , soon hid her head upon her hands as she had often done in other days , and did not restrain the tears from coursing down her face .
That ' s the vay to begin .
I said I owed him more obligations than I could ever repay , and held him in a higher admiration than I could ever express .
I thought it very curious to see her looking on serenely from her writing-table while <NAME> and I discussed it , occasionally shaking her head at us with a half-reproachful smile like a superior spirit who could just bear with our trifling .
<NAME> , aye , mistress , it 's you , is it ?
' Oh , he ' s all right , ' said <NAME> .
What are you hooroaring at ?
" I am glad to hear it , <NAME> ; and if I may , by way of a last word , revert to what I said before of my mother 's long connexion with the family and the worth it bespeaks on both sides , I would point out this little instance here on my arm who shows herself so affectionate and faithful in parting and in whom my mother , I dare say , has done something to awaken such feelings -- though of course <NAME> , by her heartfelt interest and her genial condescension , has done much more . "
" I do n't know what it is .
Walters and <NAME> are expected home ! ' ' My dear , ' said <NAME> , raising herself quickly from the sofa , very pale , ' don ' t try to deceive me , for it ' s no use , they ' re come home -- I see it plainly in your face ! ' ' She ' s a most extraordinary woman ! ' exclaimed Mr Toots , in rapturous admiration .
<NAME> will suspect <NAME> of being anything but an <NAME> bull-dog , or of having any design in his head but to fly at anybody who touches his master. " " I must say again that I heartily admire your gallantry and youthfulness. " " I must say again , nonsense , nonsense !
Stars were yet visible , but there was dull light in the east that was not the light of night .
' Mr <NAME> mentioned incidentally , in the course of our conversation , that he was going to take your valuable advice on the subject of finding such a partner .
He , <NAME> , of the 97th , to be extinguished in a moment , by a man whom nobody had ever seen before , and whom nobody knew even now !
This important business of the evening had hardly commenced , when the door was thrown briskly open , and another gentleman in a light-blue suit , and leaden buttons , made his appearance .
Her quiet interest in everything that interested <NAME> ; her manner of making acquaintance with <NAME> ( who responded instantly ) ; her pleasant way , when <NAME> was ashamed to come over to her usual seat by me ; her modest grace and ease , eliciting a crowd of blushing little marks of confidence from <NAME> ; seemed to make our circle quite complete .
What is your opinion of <NAME> ? ' Mortimer assented to <NAME> , and they turned eastward .
" Oh , when I think of all these years , and of his fatherly care and kindness , and of the old relations among us , and of you , what shall I do , what shall I do ! "
The philanthropist deranged the symmetry of the table , sat himself in the way of the waiting , blocked up the thoroughfare , and drove <NAME> ( who assisted the parlour-maid ) to the verge of distraction by passing plates and dishes on , over his own head .
The mother and her daughters were engaged in sewing .
I sat next to her .
three times without making an impression .
This conjunction of circumstances led to his immediately afterwards presenting himself before the young ladies in a posture , which in ancient times would not have been considered one of favourable augury for his suit ; since the gondoliers of the young ladies , having been put to some inconvenience by the chase , so neatly brought their own boat in the gentlest collision with the bark of Mr Sparkler , as to tip that gentleman over like a larger species of ninepin , and cause him to exhibit the soles of his shoes to the object of his dearest wishes : while the nobler portions of his anatomy struggled at the bottom of his boat in the arms of one of his men .
Now is the time for shadow , when every corner is a cavern and every downward step a pit , when the stained glass is reflected in pale and faded hues upon the floors , when anything and everything can be made of the heavy staircase beams excepting their own proper shapes , when the armour has dull lights upon it not easily to be distinguished from stealthy movement , and when barred helmets are frightfully suggestive of heads inside .
Mrs. Chadband merely laughs and contemptuously tells him he can " offer " twenty pence .
Last evening he does this .
I have expected you some time. ' ' It is my misfortune , ' he replied , ' to be here , wholly against my will , for such a purpose .
' -- Hear me out ! ' cried <NAME> .
Now , as to the management of your capital while you are away , and as to the conversion of so much of it as the business may need from time to time -- ' His partner stopped him .
You had better tell us at once , that that fellow Slackbridge is not in the town , stirring up the people to mutiny ; and that he is not a regular qualified leader of the people : that is , a most confounded scoundrel .
I ask you , what is that light ? "
This being a very long word for Mr Sparkler , and his mind being exhausted by his late effort , he replied , ' No , thank you .
He now sat looking at the fire , and bit his lip .
' Well ! ' he replied , shaking the snow out of his long hair , ' I was a-going to turn in somewheers. ' In those days there was a side-entrance to the stable-yard of the <NAME> , the inn so memorable to me in connexion with his misfortune , nearly opposite to where we stood .
' How do you do , <NAME> ? ' ' Why , reasonably conwalessent , ' replied <NAME> .
Mr Rokesmith , it is to me you owe this perverted account of what passed between us that night .
<NAME> wilt be faithful , little <NAME> ? '
He gave us a searching look as we entered , but his manner was both courtly and kind .
<NAME> him , ' cried <NAME> , as the chant began again .
' Where is it ? ' ' No good can come of your knowing , ' replied <NAME> .
We are a great country , <NAME> , we are a very great country .
The river was full of floating blocks of ice , which were constantly crunching and cracking under us ; and the depth of water , in the course we took to avoid the larger masses , carried down the middle of the river by the current , did not exceed a few inches .
I don ' t know how long I may live , or how soon I may die ; but I know that if I was capsized , any night , in a gale of wind in <NAME> Roads here , and was to see the town-lights shining for the last time over the rollers as I couldn ' t make no head against , I could go down quieter for thinking " There ' s a man ashore there , iron-true to my little Em ' ly , <NAME> bless her , and no wrong can touch my Em ' ly while so be as that man lives. " ' <NAME> , in simple earnestness , waved his right arm , as if he were waving it at the town-lights for the last time , and then , exchanging a nod with <NAME> , whose eye he caught , proceeded as before .
She may be an hour , she may be more .
This dignitary , conferring in secrecy with <NAME> on the subject of punch and wines , bent his head as though stooping to the <NAME> practice of receiving auricular confession .
Have you taken <NAME> into custody before he had time and opportunity to beat me !
A vast deal of coolness , and a peculiar degree of judgment , are requisite in catching a hat .
I ' ll make <NAME> bark at you all day .
He has caused himself to be provided with a key and can pass in at his pleasure .
As <NAME> murmured something in his placid admiration , the ministering women at his bed ' s head asked him what he said .
<NAME> , shut that door at <NAME> 's back , and take them bits that I 've put out on the cover of the bread-pan .
To these remonstrances , the single gentleman answered not a word , but when the trunk was at last got into the bed-room , sat down upon it and wiped his bald head and face with his handkerchief .
<NAME> doubt , I am sure .
Will you hear me say one word , in explanation of this mischance ? ' But <NAME> might as well have spoken to the wind , for the young lady , with distracted looks , hurried up the stairs .
" He has died , " says the surgeon , " of an over-dose of opium , there is no doubt .
Or at least ' -- for I saw a faint blush in her face , ' you would have let me find it out for myself .
" He first laughed at my words , and then frowned at them .
Her hands were then nervously clasping together , but he took one of them .
' <NAME> , take a seat on the bed , will you ?
<NAME> springs and fiery eruptions , the usual attendants upon earthquakes , lent their contributions of confusion to the scene .
<NAME> 's first triumph in her new office , was to solve a difficulty that had completely vanquished me .
Because we are so very umble. ' ' Have you been studying much law lately ? ' I asked , to change the subject .
Such roads I had never seen .
It seemed to penetrate into the very bones of the shrinking wayfarers , and to rack them with cold and pains .
Two mutton-chops , three potatoes , some split peas , a little flour , two ounces of butter , a pinch of salt , and all this black pepper .
' A gentleman who was so good as to bring <NAME> home the other night when she lost her way , coming from your house. ' The little man turned to the child as if to chide her or express his wonder , but as she was talking to the young man , held his peace , and bent his head to listen .
She described to us how tenderly he had taken leave of her , and how manfully and quietly he had borne himself .
<NAME> 's health is not strong , and I want to be able to assist him .
good Heaven , Mr Brass ! ' cried <NAME> , trembling from head to foot ; ' you don ' t suppose -- ' ' No , no , ' rejoined <NAME> quickly , ' I don ' t suppose anything .
I doen ' t know , being a lady ' s , but what it ' s worse. ' She changed now , in a moment .
The walks shrunk into stripes again at the sound , and raising himself a little in the bed , and holding the curtain open with one hand , he looked out .
To this he submitted with the best grace possible , staring at me during the whole operation as if he never had been , and never could again be , so astonished in his life -- looking very miserable also , certainly , but making no complaint , and going snugly to sleep as soon as it was over .
' Yes , he is , ' was the reply , ' but he ' s very busy .
" <NAME> ; on the other hand , they whisper at the fountain , " resumed the countryman , " that he is brought down into our country to be executed on the spot , and that he will very certainly be executed .
' At the same time , <NAME> , ' added Mr <NAME> , glancing at the note in his hand , ' if the gentleman should want to borrow you now and then for an hour or so , or even a day or so , at a time , we must consent to lend you , and you must consent to be lent. -- Oh !
asked <NAME> , setting down his cup , and looking his employer , eagerly , in the face .
Having seen him sound asleep , and heard him snore most satisfactorily , and having further presided over the distribution of the toys , to the perfect contentment of all the little <NAME> , <NAME> took his leave .
He says this , not unfeelingly , while sitting on the bedstead 's edge with his face towards that other face and his hand upon the region of the heart .
" And reminding you that she and her sister had differed , had gone their several ways ? "
a horrible , horrible sight ! ' ' Who did you think it might have been ? ' asked Mr Inspector .
There was no resource but to knock at the door .
But , finding me well employed , and bearing a good character , and hearing on all hands that I rose fast in the school , she soon discontinued these visits .
Because I am well aware of my deficiencies .
I know this is a confidence , " she modestly said , after a little hesitation , and in earnest tears , " I know you would say this to no one else .
' Bitherstone is new to Mr Toots. ' New to <NAME> , too , almost ; for , in the schoolroom , <NAME> -- no longer <NAME> of Mrs <NAME> ' s -- shows in collars and a neckcloth , and wears a watch .
It is a foolish mercy .
The mill which had worked them down , was the mill that grinds young people old ; the children had ancient faces and grave voices ; and upon them , and upon the grown faces , and ploughed into every furrow of age and coming up afresh , was the sigh , <NAME> .
Mr <NAME> replied that he had very recently been assuaging the pangs of thirst , but that he was still open to ' a modest quencher , ' if the materials were at hand .
It always appears to me ( if this should prove to be a baseless assumption , I shall be pardoned ) , that Mr <NAME> has been accustomed to exercise influence over the minds of others. ' ' Hum -- madam , ' said Mr Dorrit , ' I have been at the head of -- ha of a considerable community .
But , the bitterness of her grief was not in beholding him in this condition , when he was at least content and tranquil , nor in her solitary meditations on his altered state , though these were trials for a young heart .
A clean room , a hot dish for dinner , and a bottle of not absolutely poisonous wine , are all I want tonight .
<NAME> , sir , ' said brother Ned , ' the matter upon which my brother <NAME> called upon you this morning is one which is already perfectly well known to us three , and to others besides , and must unhappily soon become known to a great many more .
She had not failed to recollect , either , how much more agreeable she could render his situation if she were his friend , and how much more disagreeable if she were his enemy ; and , doubtless , many less scrupulous young gentlemen than <NAME> would have encouraged her extravagance had it been only for this very obvious and intelligible reason .
In this house , and with this family , I passed my leisure time .
I can say to you of the healthful music of my pulse what <NAME> said of his .
I said , 'Can you , at your time of life , be so headstrong , my friend , as to persist that an arm-chair is a thing to put upon a shelf and look at ?
These did occasionally wink a little , as the hot air barely moved their faint leaves .
' Heaven forbid , <NAME> , ' he replied , ' that I should do any man an injustice : still less , <NAME> .
After a trifling delay , <NAME> ' s maid appeared , and conducted him to a morning room upstairs , where <NAME> and <NAME> were together .
There was a fine , massive gravity in his face , I did not venture to disturb .
<NAME> <NAME> was well , and <NAME> was well , and Mrs. Gummidge was but poorly , and little Em ' ly wouldn ' t send her love , but said that <NAME> might send it , if she liked .
The blindness of my confidence is past , <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> ' s keen glance comprehended all of us .
' No , Mr <NAME> , sir , ' rejoined <NAME> with emotion , ' I will not take it up .
' Shaving-water , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , from within the curtains .
We stood in the <NAME> while she pointed out her luggage to me , and when it was all collected I remembered -- having forgotten everything but herself in the meanwhile -- that I knew nothing of her destination .
For , as I says to <NAME> when the news of your being ill were brought by letter , which it were brought by the post , and being formerly single he is now married though underpaid for a deal of walking and shoe-leather , but wealth were not a object on his part , and marriage were the great wish of his hart -- " " It is so delightful to hear you , <NAME> !
He won ' t ; not that he ' s afraid -- , oh , no !
' A bird flying to the hedge , ' was all he thought about it ; and came back , and resumed his walk .
<NAME> found it , at last , after some trouble , and pausing at the door to take breath that he might enter with becoming decency , passed into the chapel .
I never saw such a picture of forlorn affliction and distress of mind .
Be quiet , will you ! ' ' Then write large , <NAME> , ' she returned , repeating her secret signal ; ' for my eyes are not good , even at print. ' Muttering to himself , and returning to his work with an ill will , <NAME> went on with the word .
I can acquit my conscience therefore , almost equally , by confidence , on such a theme , in you or him .
It set him thinking of her as he had first seen her , when she had believed herself to be alone among the trees .
" That ' s it ! " says the doctor .
' To Mr Dombey , ' says the old man .
' There ' s plenty of time , ' rejoined the dwarf , ' and it shall be done .
' Oh dear me , dear me ! ' sighs Mr Venus , heavily , snuffing the candle , ' the world that appeared so flowery has ceased to blow !
From this time you begin your history .
" Good night , citizen , " said <NAME> , pausing in going by ; for , the man eyed him inquisitively .
<NAME> made no reply ; but , pulling open the door , of which <NAME> had turned the lock , dashed into the silent streets .
The robbery , partly owing to the inquisitiveness of the neighbours , and partly to his own grief and rage , had , long ago , become known ; but he positively refused to give his sanction or yield any assistance to the old woman ' s capture , and was seized with such a panic at the idea of being called upon to give evidence against her , that he shut himself up close in his house , and refused to hold communication with anybody .
I recollect saying with my own lips that I was much too umble .
' Dear Mr Clennam , I must say something to you before I go .
'It would be hard to tell .
In this state of things , matters seem to be approximating to a fix of another kind , when another inside passenger in a corner , who is nearly suffocated , cries faintly , ' I ' ll get out. ' This is no matter of relief or self-congratulation to the driver , for his immovable philosophy is perfectly undisturbed by anything that happens in the coach .
' She will be at <NAME> long before him , ' thought Mrs. Sparsit , ' though his horse is never so good .
I find , running through the performances of this child , ' said <NAME> , turning to the phenomenon , ' a unity of feeling , a breadth , a light and shade , a warmth of colouring , a tone , a harmony , a glow , an artistical development of original conceptions , which I look for , in vain , among older performers -- I don ' t know whether I make myself understood ? ' ' Perfectly , ' replied <NAME> .
A woman ' s anger is pretty much the same here , as in your fine house .
Anywhere beyond his reach , was no reply to the question .
' Just so , ' returned Mrs. Micawber .
' I hope good may be coming of it in the future time .
' Then , ' said Mrs. Micawber , who prided herself on taking a clear view of things , and keeping <NAME> straight by her woman ' s wisdom , when he might otherwise go a little crooked , ' then I ask myself this question .
Not a thread changes , in the house of the two little bird-like ladies .
' What ' s the row , <NAME> ? ' inquired one gentleman in black calico sleeves .
Mr Carker , ' said the <NAME> , in the goodness of his nature , ' when I was here last , we was very pleasant together .
What ' s the meaning of it ? ' The <NAME> decided , after some consideration , that it meant mantraps ; that it meant plotting and snaring ; that <NAME> was digging pitfalls .
I took leave of <NAME> , and <NAME> , and Mrs. Gummidge , and little Em ' ly , that day ; and passed the night at <NAME> ' s , in a little room in the roof ( with the <NAME> on a shelf by the bed ' s head ) which was to be always mine , <NAME> said , and should always be kept for me in exactly the same state .
They can scarcely be represented as having lumbered it , so conscientious and precise was their orderly arrangement .
Come ? " " <NAME> , <NAME> , there was nothing at all of the kind. " As I fixed my eyes hopelessly on <NAME> , <NAME> contemplated me in dismay .
This , however , was a speciality on that particular birthday , and not a general solemnity .
' What is it but a grave ! ' said the sexton .
The meeting did not take place without great emotion on both sides .
This might lead to his apprehension as he passed along the streets .
' You ' re about right there , ' said <NAME> ; ' and if you had said she would look very well upon the stage too , you wouldn ' t have been far out .
I was not mad at that time , " curtsying low and smiling between every little sentence .
These gradually fell into their proper places , and by degrees suggested more : so that in a little time he had the whole , almost as it was delivered .
Wishing to be fully re-established in my strength and my good spirits before <NAME> came , I now laid down a little series of plans with <NAME> for being in the fresh air all day long .
Heaping them back into the drawers , and locking them up in a rage of haste , he saw some papers on the table .
My old dear bedroom was changed , and I was to lie a long way off .
; and the astonishment of <NAME> was in no degree lessened , when he found it to be couched in the following laconic terms : -- " Mr .
Greatly relieved to find that he was not too late , <NAME> leant against a lamp-post to take breath , and waited the advent of the pony and his charge .
<NAME> any on ' em to be doubled up ? ' When the <NAME> put this question he dropped his hat , made a dodge and a feint with his left hand , hit a supposed enemy a violent blow with his right , shook his head smartly , and recovered himself .
There was not a bird of such methodical and business-like habits in all the world , as the blind blackbird , who dreamed and dozed away his days in a large snug cage , and had lost his voice , from old age , years before <NAME> first bought him .
Under which circumstances she has answered Our <NAME> , " No , <NAME> , I can not have you , I can not have any husband , it is not my intentions ever to become a wife , it is my intentions to be always a sacrifice , farewell , find another worthy of you , and forget me ! " This is the way in which she is doomed to be a constant slave to them that are not worthy that a constant slave she unto them should be .
But I can ' t consent , and I won ' t consent , and I never did consent , and I never will consent to be lost in you .
The schoolmaster took a seat beside him , and stooping over the pillow , whispered his name .
<NAME> replied that he thought not also , judging from <NAME> ' s looks , and that it was a pity , for it need be .
But as this step involved the relinquishment of his apartments at <NAME> MacStinger ' s , and he knew that resolute woman would never hear of his deserting them , the <NAME> took the desperate determination of running away .
But he ' s a perfect Patriarch ; and it would do a man good to serve him on such terms -- on any terms. ' Arthur for his life could not have said with confidence whether <NAME> really thought so or not .
And <NAME> had seen him as a predatory <NAME> of comic propensities , with a face like a red brick , and an outrageous hat all over bells .
Better try Mr <NAME> , second door on the left in the next passage. ' ' Perhaps he will give me the same answer. ' ' Very likely .
Is she dozing , old lady ? '
I never hear the name , or read the name , of <NAME> , but I am reminded of a certain Sunday morning on the beach , the bells ringing for church , little Em ' ly leaning on my shoulder , <NAME> lazily dropping stones into the water , and the sun , away at sea , just breaking through the heavy mist , and showing us the ships , like their own shadows .
And we fell back on the guitar-case , and the flower-painting , and the songs about never leaving off dancing , <NAME> ra la !
Pay five shillings fine for you indeed .
' Did you ever see such a thing as this ? ' said <NAME> to Bar when he had been baffled twenty times .
I ' ll right thee one day , child , I ' ll right thee , never fear ! ' She took from her pocket a little purse .
At this crisis <NAME> interposed her voice , but not in the <NAME> ' s favour , by saying , ' Well done , mother .
We shall soon know now .
' So she does , ' assented <NAME> .
At last the ringing of horses ' bells greeted his anxious ears .
It is quite fitting. ' ' Ma , ' <NAME> struck in , ' Mr and <NAME> are prosperous , no doubt ; but you have no right to say they are proud .
' This ring was given to the young lady who was drowned so early in her beautiful and happy career , by her husband , when they first plighted their faith to one another .
" But for your face I should think you were a little despondent , " said I .
More than that ; I 'm going to ask you to take a walk with me. " I was about to excuse myself , as being but a bad companion just then , when <NAME> anticipated me .
Looking at her he saw her , with a face quite strange to him , shrinking back against the wall , with her hands before her eyes .
With my husband standing by !
" Why , cousin <NAME> , " said <NAME> , clasping her hands upon his arm and shaking her head at me across him -- for I wanted her to be quiet -- " <NAME> was their friend directly .
" You look pale , " said <NAME> when we came out , " and cold ! "
He has been took a little poorly. ' ' <NAME> " taken , " Tope—to the <NAME> , ' the younger rook interposes in a low tone with this touch of correction , as who should say : ' You may offer bad grammar to the laity , or the humbler clergy , not to the Dean. ' <NAME> , Chief <NAME> and <NAME> , and accustomed to be high with excursion parties , declines with a silent loftiness to perceive that any suggestion has been tendered to him .
' Lord bless you , no ! ' ' Not just yet ? ' said my mother , tenderly .
I ' m thinking of taking to it again , next summer , though. ' The child wondered how a grey-headed man like him -- one of his trade too -- could talk of time so easily .
But , you must not think , ' and here she laid her light hand on his shoulder , and looked into his face , ' that I regret to be this burden on you .
Within there , where the light was , was the man who as to both distances could give him up to ruin .
And as the lady ' s humour was considered to lie chiefly in retort , <NAME> laughed heartily , and seemed to expect that <NAME> should do the same .
' Bottle of wine to the gentleman on the box .
He was not among the bobbing umbrellas , and he certainly was not the newspaper boy in the oilskin cap who was slowly working his way along the piece of brass outside , writing his name over Mr <NAME> ' s name with his forefinger .
<NAME> and <NAME> got in without any further ceremony ; and the man to whom he belonged , having lingered for a minute or two 'to bear him up , ' and to defy the hostler and the world to produce his equal , mounted also .
Do you hear me when I tell you that , my darling ?
The jocund travellers came on ; and as they came , <NAME> knew and named them every one .
And he was so good-natured throughout , and in such high spirits , and so fond of <NAME> , that it was very difficult indeed to be otherwise than pleased with him .
' Is it my fault ? ' ' All I know is , ' said <NAME> , smiling drily , for she delighted in nothing so much as irritating her brother , ' that if every one of your clients is to force us to keep a clerk , whether we want to or not , you had better leave off business , strike yourself off the roll , and get taken in execution , as soon as you can. ' ' Have we got any other client like him ? ' said <NAME> .
I do not deny that he has kept me in the dark as to his resources and his liabilities both , ' she went on , looking at the wall ; ' but I never will desert <NAME> ! ' Mrs. Micawber having now raised her voice into a perfect scream , I was so frightened that I ran off to the club-room , and disturbed <NAME> in the act of presiding at a long table , and leading the chorus of <NAME> up , <NAME> , <NAME> ho , <NAME> , <NAME> up , <NAME> , <NAME> up , and gee ho -- o -- o !
Being quite alone , I cried a little again , though on the whole I do n't think I behaved so very , very ill .
" Hallowed be -- thy -- " The light is come upon the dark benighted way .
He seemed to be losing time unless he was moving .
Why can ' t they do as I have done , ma ' am ?
' <NAME> Groffin. ' ' Here , ' said the chemist .
' Wot job ? ' said the long-legged young man .

' With that he bowed and leered at me , and with a keen glance around which seemed to comprehend every object within his range of vision , however , small or trivial , went his way .
<NAME> had no maid ! ' ' I came here alone , ' said <NAME> ' It was my choice to do so .
My guardian 's old hopes of her and <NAME> arose sorrowfully in my mind , and I said to myself , " She has been anxious about him , " and I wondered how that love would end .
I saw his bed rolled up in a corner ; and what plates and dishes and pots he had , on a shelf ; and I divined ( God knows how ) that though the two girls with the shock heads of hair were <NAME> ' s children , the dirty lady was not married to <NAME> .
Where are you going ? ' was the next compassionate chorus she heard .
' Thank you , but I don ' t want you. ' Some small voice , near his ear , would ask him how he was , perhaps .
' I hope so , ' returned <NAME> ; ' our hours are from nine to nine , with extra work when we ' re very full of business , for which I allow payment as overtime. ' Kate bowed her head , to intimate that she heard , and was satisfied .
' Who passes by this road so late ?
I go on board again ; open the door of the gentlemen ' s cabin and walk in .
The day was just breaking , and the whole scene was rendered perfectly visible by the grey light of the morning .
I see her grown up -- gent ' lmen -- like a flower .
<NAME> did not blush to hear the <NAME> earnest in his praises , but sat staring at him , and affecting to snivel with sympathy , and making a feint of being virtuous , and treasuring up every word he said ( like a young spy as he was ) with very promising deceit .
It was not until they had seen him gradually diminish into a mere speck upon the distant road , that they turned to each other , and ventured to laugh aloud .
Upon my honour , ' said <NAME> , indefinitely kissing his hand and bowing with his genteelest air , ' I do Homage to <NAME> !
' Yes , I think you had better .
' You have been here many , many times , when I have not seen you , <NAME> ? ' ' Yes , I have been here sometimes when I have not come into the room. ' ' Very often ? ' ' <NAME> often , ' said <NAME> , timidly .
' We bring the compliments of <NAME> , and a thousand entreaties that you ' ll take a seat in a private box at the play tonight , ' said <NAME> .
It turns into curds and whey when I look at him. ' ' Well it may , sir , ' said Mrs. Snawley .

Such a thing has happened here , often , and too often .
Have you got it ? " " Yes , sir. " Hastily written on the paper was the word " ACQUITTED. " " If you had sent the message , 'Recalled to <NAME> , ' again , " muttered <NAME> , as he turned , " I should have known what you meant , this time. " He had no opportunity of saying , or so much as thinking , anything else , until he was clear of the <NAME> ; for , the crowd came pouring out with a vehemence that nearly took him off his legs , and a loud buzz swept into the street as if the baffled blue-flies were dispersing in search of other carrion .
On a night in mid-July , one thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine , <NAME> came in late , from <NAME> 's , and sat himself down by <NAME> and her husband in the dark window .

' Mr Carker , ' said <NAME> , brightening with a generous thought , ' Come !
He was a tall , gaunt , cadaverous man , in an old greatcoat and slippers , with sunken cheeks , and a restless , eager eye .

For he is , by heaven , the most self-satisfied , and the shallowest , and the most coxcombical and utterly brainless ass ! "
He withdrew his eyes when he saw that he was observed , and affected to be busied with some scanty preparations for dinner .
He has been there so long !
' What is it ? ' By this time <NAME> had recovered sufficient presence of mind to speak for himself , so he said ( as it had been agreed he should say ) that he had called about a pair of hand-screens , and some painted velvet for an ottoman , both of which were required to be of the most elegant design possible , neither time nor expense being of the smallest consideration .
She was even more dreadfully fond of <NAME> than she had been when I last saw them together ; I repeat the word advisedly , for there was something positively dreadful in the energy of her looks and embraces .

What a useful work a Dictionary is !
' A great deal , ' replied <NAME> ; ' but not now .

There was an earthy savour in the air , a chilly bareness in the place , which associated itself somehow with too much getting up by candle-light , and not too much to eat .
He dressed himself for going out , with a docile submission to her entreaty ; and walking with a feeble gait , and looking back , with a tremble , at the room in which he had been so long shut up , and where he had seen the picture in the glass , passed out with her into the hall .

The man shook his head .
I tell you I must get it before I can give it to you. ' She stopped in the roadway , as if to put an end to the conference .
Further , she was lady paramount over certain vaults in the basement , sharply spiked off from communication with the predatory world ; and over the relics of the current day ' s work , consisting of blots of ink , worn-out pens , fragments of wafers , and scraps of paper torn so small , that nothing interesting could ever be deciphered on them when Mrs. <NAME> tried .

The pipe soon getting into better condition , he fell into that state of repose becoming a good smoker ; but sat with his eyes fixed on <NAME> , and , with a beaming placidity not to be described , and stopping every now and then to discharge a little cloud from his lips , slowly puffed it forth , as if it were a scroll coming out of his mouth , bearing the legend ' Poor Wal ' r , ay , ay .
Another shake of the hand , <NAME> , if you please .
' Why , I ' ll tell you what , sir , ' said <NAME> , standing in his favourite attitude and pointing to the cage with the feather of his pen , ' it ' s a very extraordinary thing about that bird , that the only people he ever takes the smallest notice of , are <NAME> , and <NAME> , and you , and me. ' Here , <NAME> stopped and glanced anxiously at <NAME> ; then unexpectedly catching his eye repeated , ' And you and me , sir , and you and me.

And immediately darted into her state-cabin again .
His table was covered with papers , and he was hard at work in an old coat .

From these , in a narrow and a dirty street devoted to such callings , Mr Wegg selects one dark shop-window with a tallow candle dimly burning in it , surrounded by a muddle of objects vaguely resembling pieces of leather and dry stick , but among which nothing is resolvable into anything distinct , save the candle itself in its old tin candlestick , and two preserved frogs fighting a small-sword duel .
' And so you ' ve got another berth , have you , my lad ? ' said the <NAME> , eyeing him intently .

He stood , for a moment , with the blood so tingling through all his veins from terror , that he felt as if he were in a burning fire ; then , confused and frightened , he took to his heels ; and , not knowing what he did , made off as fast as he could lay his feet to the ground .
Do n't be afraid , <NAME> , you shall come back to us again .
Now , who 's next ? " Thus , we walked through <NAME> 's greenhouse , until he turned to me and said , " Notice the man I shall shake hands with. " I should have done so , without the preparation , as he had shaken hands with no one yet .
The <NAME> had no sooner swallowed the last procurable morsel of food , than they evinced , by various half-suppressed yawns and stretchings of their limbs , an obvious inclination to retire for the night , which <NAME> had betrayed still more strongly : he having , in the course of the meal , fallen asleep several times while in the very act of eating .
I replied , ' I , <NAME> !
I have long found that there is nothing .
" For the loss of his services. " <NAME> laid his hand upon my shoulder with the touch of a woman .
I got him back for you by means of the girl ; and then _she_ begins to favour him . '
I have a partiality for everything genuine .
Away , with a shriek , and a roar , and a rattle , plunging down into the earth again , and working on in such a storm of energy and perseverance , that amidst the darkness and whirlwind the motion seems reversed , and to tend furiously backward , until a ray of light upon the wet wall shows its surface flying past like a fierce stream .

They were both so glad to see me at all hours , and used to brighten up so when they heard me opening the door and coming in ( being quite at home , I never knocked ) , that I had no fear of becoming troublesome just yet .
It is appointed against such offences that the offenders shall not be able to forget .

' Why , I think it ' s Mr Carker , ' said <NAME> .
And then , and not till then , I said to <NAME> , " <NAME> , <NAME> will not only be your husband , but he will represent your late father : he will represent the head of our family , he will represent the wisdom and station , and I may say the means , of our family ; and will be , in short , a Boon to it.

You have supposed Mr Meagles and his family to strain every nerve , I think you said -- ' ' Every nerve , ' repeated <NAME> , looking at him in calm obstinacy , with her green fan between her face and the fire .
I have been very poor , too , and have even suffered from want. ' ' Good Heaven , <NAME> ! ' exclaimed <NAME> , ' what are you telling me ? ' ' Nothing which need distress you quite so much , ' answered <NAME> , with a more sprightly air ; ' neither did I come here to bewail my lot , but on matter more to the purpose .

<NAME> 's appearance gave a new turn to the conversation ; for the boys , receiving a sly wink from the wary old Jew , began to ply her with liquor : of which , however , she took very sparingly ; while <NAME> , assuming an unusual flow of spirits , gradually brought <NAME> into a better temper , by affecting to regard his threats as a little pleasant banter ; and , moreover , by laughing very heartily at one or two rough jokes , which , after repeated applications to the spirit-bottle , he condescended to make .

" 'Yes , master , and I 've never been in it much . '
Yet I had never been taught to pray for any relation but my godmother .
I am not angry. ' ' I say , ' resumed the <NAME> , ' I am not angry , and I mean kindly to you , and I want to overlook this .
' <NAME> , <NAME> , ' remonstrated <NAME> , ' I must say that I don ' t understand your allusions , and that I think you might be more delicate and less personal. ' ' Go it ! ' cried Mr <NAME> , becoming , on the shortest notice , a prey to despair .

' Why , surely he must love you with all his heart ! ' cried <NAME> , with an earnestness that threatened to blaze into ferocity if he didn ' t .

I clearly perceived , too , that <NAME> shared my feelings .
Now , it certainly looked about the last apartment on the whole earth out of which any man would be likely to get anything to do him good .
He said ' very much. ' And <NAME> , with no little trepidation , showed herself at his bedside .
' I trust , madam , ' said his Grace , returning alone , ' that you will have the kindness to overlook it , in consideration of its being the act of a very young man who is merely here on liking , and who will never answer. ' With that , he solemnly bowed and retired , and they all burst into laughter , long and merry .
<NAME> <NAME> is here , gentlemen. ' Mr Garland and the Notary walked in , looking very grave ; and , drawing up two chairs , one on each side of the single gentleman , formed a kind of fence round the gentle <NAME> , and penned her into a corner .
But , no Hundreds of people came to see the sights , and <NAME> looked in vain for the fulfilment of <NAME> 's prediction .

At the hour of eight , a deep lowing , as of a nautical Bull , outside the shop-door , succeeded by the knocking of a stick on the panel , announced to the listening ear of <NAME> , that <NAME> was alongside ; whom he instantly admitted , shaggy and loose , and with his stolid mahogany visage , as usual , appearing to have no consciousness of anything before it , but to be attentively observing something that was taking place in quite another part of the world .
To which end , the accidental discovery by <NAME> of some tender correspondence , in which <NAME> was described as ' old ' and ' ordinary , ' had most providentially contributed .
I stopped then , to wave my hat , and dear old <NAME> waved his strong right arm above his head , crying huskily " Hooroar ! " and <NAME> put her apron to her face .
' <NAME> , you may be ; sure , you are ! ' This he twice or thrice repeated with much complacency , as he again dispersed the legs of the <NAME> trousers and bent the knees .
Squeers had actually begun to haul him out , when <NAME> ( who , until then , had been evidently undecided how to act ) took him by the collar , and shaking him so that such teeth as he had , chattered in his head , politely escorted him to the room-door , and thrusting him into the passage , shut it upon him .

You , with your practices of infamous foreign prisons and galleys would make it the money that impelled me .
The sun is tremendously hot , even to me .
' That ' s comforting , and I hope you may be right .
After which offensive implication , he cut himself a crust of bread , and threw the knife down with a noise .
" Before I go , " he said , and paused -- " I may kiss her ? " It was remembered afterwards that when he bent down and touched her face with his lips , he murmured some words .
' Did you hear him ? ' retorted <NAME> .
It has closed around me almost as awfully as if these woods of <NAME> had closed around the house , but my course through it is the same .
She went by the <NAME> , though it cost her a penny , and walked more slowly in that part of her journey than in any other .
" I ask your pardon , sir , " returns the trooper , " but I should wish to know what YOU say ? "

Oh , how happy I was , down upon the floor , with my sweet beautiful girl down upon the floor too , holding my scarred face to her lovely cheek , bathing it with tears and kisses , rocking me to and fro like a child , calling me by every tender name that she could think of , and pressing me to her faithful heart .
How many to the <NAME> to-day ? " " Fifty-two. " " I said so !
Now , the point was this .

On the road home , he was more demonstrative of aggressive intentions against the other foot-passengers , than comported with a professor of the peaceful art of self-defence .
<NAME> , that you could carry back your thoughts to very distant days -- to the time of your early life -- when , unlike this fair flower , you did not pass your youth alone .
" It was he who was very gentlemanly , I think ! "
Suddenly <NAME> gave such a scream that I all but dropped it .
' I wish I were not going to this dinner , Helena. ' ' Dear Neville , is it worth while to care much about it ?
The Storming of the <NAME> in the Air 20 .
Let me go and listen. ' She shuddered to approach the pit ; but she crept towards it on her hands and knees , and called to him as loud as she could call .
said <NAME> , suddenly breaking silence .
I never see a young woman in any station of society -- and I 've seen many elevated ones too -- conduct herself like you have conducted yourself since you was called out of your bed .
When it was asleep again , I crept close to my mother ' s side according to my old custom , broken now a long time , and sat with my arms embracing her waist , and my little red cheek on her shoulder , and once more felt her beautiful hair drooping over me -- like an angel ' s wing as I used to think , I recollect -- and was very happy indeed .
Now , <NAME> , my darling , you had better go along with <NAME> and get ready for the boat .
' <NAME> gobbled and gobbled , till I found out how to do it .

<NAME> saw it , and ground his teeth at every repetition of the savage and cowardly attack .
Not that they had ever quarrelled ( <NAME> informed me ) ; but that having been , on the occasion of <NAME> ' s christening , invited to tea , when they considered themselves privileged to be invited to dinner , they had expressed their opinion in writing , that it was ' better for the happiness of all parties ' that they should stay away .
' <NAME> , count , ' screamed Mrs. Leo Hunter to a well-whiskered individual in a foreign uniform , who was passing by .

It being impossible to stand or sit without holding on , they were all heaped together in one corner of a long sofa—a fixture extending entirely across the cabin—where they clung to each other in momentary expectation of being drowned .
When <NAME> replied in the negative , <NAME> said that she understood why he had been so delicate , but that she felt sure he would approve of her confiding her secret to <NAME> , and that she would therefore do so now with <NAME> ' s permission .
That , he seemed on the point of being at once released , when the tide in his favour met with some unexplained check ( not intelligible to the Doctor ) , which led to a few words of secret conference .
There was very little said at dinner .
I remember , too , when we had discovered and exhausted another topic of consolation in the circumstance of this ladies ' cabin adjoining our state-room , and the consequently immense feasibility of sitting there at all times and seasons , and had fallen into a momentary silence , leaning our faces on our hands and looking at the fire , one of our party said , with the solemn air of a man who had made a discovery , ' What a relish mulled claret will have down here ! ' which appeared to strike us all most forcibly ; as though there were something spicy and high-flavoured in cabins , which essentially improved that composition , and rendered it quite incapable of perfection anywhere else .
She approached one of the wretched hovels by the way-side , and knocked with her hand upon the door .
He could let himself down by the cord to within a less distance of the ground than his own height , and had his knife ready in his hand to cut it then and drop .

There was another loud ring ; and the bustling old landlady of the <NAME> made her appearance in the opposite gallery .
The touch was still in its influence so like a blow that <NAME> could not get many words together to close the subject with .
We never have tunes here . "
" I have come into such good fortune since I saw you last , <NAME> , " I murmured .
Then , she dilated on the fearful hardship of having a father and mother strenuously opposed to her intended husband ; on which unhappy circumstance she dwelt at great length ; for the friend ' s father and mother were quite agreeable to her being married , and the whole courtship was in consequence as flat and common-place an affair as it was possible to imagine .

For by that time it was known that the late Mr Merdle ' s complaint had been simply Forgery and <NAME> .

Yes. ' ' It shall be done , <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> 's indignation was greatly roused ; but reflecting perhaps , that he might only injure the boy by giving vent to it , he suppressed his feelings and submitted to be sworn at once .
<NAME> , perfectly speechless with indignation , dragged the truncheon with the brass crown from its particular pocket , and flourished it before <NAME> ' s eyes .

" He is a very fervid , impassioned speaker -- full of fire !
To this effect , in as few or fewer words , the <NAME> .
" I always observed that their pride bitterly resented the younger brother 's ( as I call him ) having crossed swords with a peasant , and that peasant a boy .
Still my position was a distinguished one , and I was not at all dissatisfied with it , until <NAME> threw me in the way of that unlimited miscreant , <NAME> 's boy .
The letter never reached its destination ; but that , and other proofs , she kept , in case they ever tried to lie away the blot .

' But you needn ' t trouble yourself to make a noise at my door , ' said <NAME> , ' nor to contaminate the key-hole with your eye , I ' m packing up and going you may take your affidavit. ' The <NAME> expressed her lively satisfaction at this intelligence , and with some general opinions upon young hussies as a race , and especially upon their demerits after being spoiled by <NAME> , withdrew to prepare the <NAME> ' s wages .
inquired one of the magistrates .
<NAME> had abundant occupation for his thoughts , as he sat in the quiet room watching the father on his bed , and the daughter fanning his face .
' The servant girl had her key in the door as I came up , and directed me to this room , telling me I was expected .
He was not only a very dexterous thief , but was notorious for his boldness and hardihood , and for the number of his previous convictions .
It was the money left me , and the gains of the first few year wot I sent home to <NAME> -- all for you -- when he first come arter you , agreeable to my letter. " O that he had never come !

' Contradictory things to wish , ' said <NAME> , ' but my life and fortunes are so contradictory altogether that what can I expect myself to be ! ' The Secretary , working in the <NAME> betimes next morning , was informed that a youth waited in the hall who gave the name of <NAME> .
He agreed to this compromise , and if <NAME> had ever been happy in her life , she was happy when we sat down to work .

He had always doubled , and sometimes quadrupled , his fees .

She lives near <NAME> .
They looked at each other .
Arrived at the wharf off which this great commander ' s ship was jammed in among some five hundred companions , whose tangled rigging looked like monstrous cobwebs half swept down , <NAME> appeared at the coach-window , and invited <NAME> and <NAME> to accompany him on board ; observing that <NAME> was to the last degree soft-hearted in respect of ladies , and that nothing would so much tend to bring his expansive intellect into a state of harmony as their presentation to the <NAME> .

Then came more of the wrathful monsters , whose like they almost seemed to be in their wildness and their untamed air , screeching and turning round and round again ; and still , before , behind , and to the right and left , was the same interminable perspective of brick towers , never ceasing in their black vomit , blasting all things living or inanimate , shutting out the face of day , and closing in on all these horrors with a dense dark cloud .
As to her , <NAME> , I think I could almost die to do her service , but you would think so too , if you knew her as I do .

<NAME> <NAME> ' s establishment was about to undergo a serene hush .
' I told you , you rare charmer , you sweet witch , that you must stay and hear me , or do more harm than can ever be undone .

" My dear sir , " said the other , shaking hands with him .
On the other hand , the <NAME> <NAME> , M.P. , contends across the table with some one else that the shipwreck of the country -- about which there is no doubt ; it is only the manner of it that is in question -- is attributable to <NAME> .
Do you know , or do you not know , that the law of <NAME> supposes every man to be innocent , until he is proved -- proved -- to be guilty ? " " <NAME> , " <NAME> began to reply , " as an Englishman myself , I -- " " Come ! " said the stranger , biting his forefinger at him .
' It was a wilderness to me once .
I had never known him to pass the garden-gate before , but on this occasion he came into the house .
What doth your friend thay ?
As they passed <NAME> , he could hear the female sob bitterly ; and once she burst into such a passion of grief , that she was compelled to lean against the wall for support , while the man took the child in his arms , and tried to soothe her .
Then , I saw him wait for her and meet her .
My husband and I have exchanged some remarks upon the subject , when we have observed with pain that you have not been easy with us. ' ' Easy ?
That it would be received as a great honour and distinction , <NAME> , I need not say. ' ' Louisa , ' said Mr Dombey , after a short pause , ' it is not to be supposed -- ' ' Certainly not , ' cried <NAME> , hastening to anticipate a refusal , ' I never thought it was. ' Mr <NAME> looked at her impatiently .
<NAME> <NAME> threw away the scabbard the first morning she arose in Mrs <NAME> ' s house .
The sympathising tone in which he spoke , was quite sincere ; she was sure of that .
One or two late birds sleepily chirping in their nests , and a bat heavily crossing and recrossing her , and the reek of her own tread in the thick dust that felt like velvet , were all Mrs. <NAME> heard or saw until she very softly closed a gate .
' We are very much obliged to you , ma ' am , ' said <NAME> , ' and thankfully accept your offer. ' ' And you ' ll never be sorry for it , ' returned <NAME> .
It looked a very fresh , free life , by daylight : still fresher , and more free , by sunlight .
' I was chivied through the streets , <NAME> , when I went there , and pounded when I got there .
And you are always in my thoughts now .
<NAME> ' t I dote upon you , <NAME> ? ' ' Do you , sweet <NAME> ?
' What do you think I see in this very arbour last night ? ' inquired the boy .
<NAME> , assembly , opera , theatre , drive , nothing is new to my Lady under the worn-out heavens .
This done , <NAME> returned thanks , and that done , the <NAME> proposed Mrs. Vincent Crummles , in affecting terms .
And even if you exchanged blankets for the child -- or books and firing -- it would be impossible to prevent their being turned into liquor. ' Accordingly , it was resolved that Mr and <NAME> should search for an orphan likely to suit , and as free as possible from the foregoing objections , and should communicate again with <NAME> .
She knew he didn ' t mean to be unkind ; but <NAME> was very far from strong , and , if he didn ' t take care , he might lose her when he least expected it , which would be a very dreadful reflection for him afterwards ; and so on .
She was more than human to me .
' I know you thought so .
Thus whispering , they both go in together .
_Will_ you advise me , my sweet child ? ' Even <NAME> smiled at this notion , but she said , ' I will , <NAME> , as well as I can. ' ' Thank you , dearest Amy , ' returned <NAME> , kissing her .
His property in money amounted to nearly three thousand pounds .
Now the tongue -- now the pigeon pie .
It amazed us when we began to sort his letters and to answer some of them for him in the growlery of a morning to find how the great object of the lives of nearly all his correspondents appeared to be to form themselves into committees for getting in and laying out money .
This is the <NAME> , <NAME> , in a cab-full of wollumes .
' I beg you to excuse me .
Not that it did the least good in the way of prevention -- it might almost have been worth remarking that the fact was exactly the reverse -- but , it cleared off ( as to this world ) the trouble of each particular case , and left nothing else connected with it to be looked after .
' Satisfaction , I mean , ' returned the <NAME> .
As I had a great desire to see a Prairie before turning back from the furthest point of my wanderings ; and as some gentlemen of the town had , in their hospitable consideration , an equal desire to gratify me ; a day was fixed , before my departure , for an expedition to the Looking-Glass <NAME> , which is within thirty miles of the town .
At length , in course of time , <NAME> began to take pains to improve herself , and to be very attentive and very industrious ; and by degrees was allowed to come in and out as often as she liked , and got enough to do to support herself , and does support herself .
' <NAME> , be quiet , ' said <NAME> .
The carriages are once more at the church door .
Thus it is , that it often attains its most luxuriant growth in separation and under circumstances of the utmost difficulty ; and thus it was , that <NAME> , thinking of nothing but the unknown young lady , from day to day and from hour to hour , began , at last , to think that he was very desperately in love with her , and that never was such an ill-used and persecuted lover as he .
As the young lady brushed past , she dropped one of her gloves into my uncle ' s hand , and softly whispered , with her lips so close to his face that he felt her warm breath on his nose , the single word " <NAME> ! " Gentlemen , my uncle leaped out of the coach at once , with such violence that it rocked on the springs again .
<NAME> <NAME> was a lantern-faced , sallow-complexioned man , of about five-and-forty , or -- as the novels say -- he might be fifty .

Deportment <NAME> left us on the very next evening to begin his new career , and committed <NAME> to my charge with great love for her and great trust in me .
' It ' s a failure so far , but I ' ll stay behind , and take another touch at Mr Riah. ' ' Do not deceive yourself Mr Twemlow , ' said the Jew , then addressing him directly for the first time .
Not a whit less reticent and wooden was Mr Flintwinch outwardly , than in the usual course of things : the only perceptible difference in him being that the knot of cravat which was generally under his ear , had worked round to the back of his head : where it formed an ornamental appendage not unlike a bagwig , and gave him something of a courtly appearance .
I didn ' t like his eye .
I struck a blow that laid your lofty master in the dust , and set you there , before me , looking at me now , and knowing what I mean. ' He sprung up from his chair with a great oath .
If not , where was the man , and why did he not come back ? ' Where was the man , and why did he not come back ?
'If he was coming here , he 'd have come with the dog , ' said <NAME> , stooping down to examine the animal , who lay panting on the floor .

By six o ' clock we clustered on the deck , prepared to go ashore ; and looked upon the spires , and roofs , and smoke , of <NAME> .
Its effect upon young <NAME> was to make him repeat in a defenceless way , ' Look here !
'There is no other , ' said the doctor .
When did it strike you ? " " I thought he was rather a handsome fellow , and I thought I should have been much the same sort of fellow , if I had had any luck. " <NAME> laughed till he shook his precocious paunch .
' Well , ' said <NAME> , sipping his first glass of port , ' if this is a discounting dinner , all I have to say is , deyvle take me , if it wouldn ' t be a good pla-an to get discount every day. ' ' You ' ll have plenty of it , in your time , ' returned <NAME> ; ' Nickleby will tell you that. ' ' What do you say , <NAME> ? ' inquired the young man ; ' am I to be a good customer ? ' ' It depends entirely on circumstances , my lord , ' replied <NAME> .
' Ay ! ' said <NAME> , as though he pitied him from his heart , ' then you don ' t know what she ' s capable of. ' All this time there had been a great whisking in and out of the other room ; the door had been opened and shut very softly about twenty times a minute ( for it was necessary to keep Mrs. Kenwigs quiet ) ; and the baby had been exhibited to a score or two of deputations from a select body of female friends , who had assembled in the passage , and about the street-door , to discuss the event in all its bearings .
<NAME> gave a nod , put it in his hat , and was shuffling away , when <NAME> , whose doting delight knew no bounds , beckoned him back again , and said , in a shrill whisper , and with a grin which puckered up his whole face , and almost obscured his eyes : ' Will you -- will you take a little drop of something -- just a taste ? ' In good fellowship ( if <NAME> had been capable of it ) Newman would not have drunk with him one bubble of the richest wine that was ever made ; but to see what he would be at , and to punish him as much as he could , he accepted the offer immediately .
He said , ' <NAME> Pythick. ' I asked him who was <NAME> ?
' Give me your hand , my worthy friend , ' said <NAME> .
I ' m here before him , though , so I don ' t mind. ' Comforting himself with this reflection , <NAME> extracted the plug from the door-key ; having opened the door , replugged and repocketed his <NAME> , and picked up the letters which the postman had dropped through the box , he ushered <NAME> into the office .
The <NAME> , as <NAME> had called him , was used to lying in wait , however , and had the patience of his tribe .
I see myself , with <NAME> at my side , journeying along the road of life .
' Who is <NAME> ? ' whispered <NAME> .
And if I ever do leave this place , <NAME> , ' added <NAME> , with assumed cheerfulness -- ' if I do , I pledge you my word that you shall return to me instantly. ' ' Now I ' ll tell you wot it is , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , in a grave and solemn voice .
At an early hour , but not before <NAME> and <NAME> had questioned each other at some length about their voyages and dangers , they all , except <NAME> , vacated <NAME> ' s room , and went down to the parlour .
As <NAME> bowed , he took his spectacles from his waistcoat pocket , and put them on ; a process which he had no sooner gone through , than , uttering an exclamation of surprise , <NAME> retreated several paces , and the lady , with a half-suppressed scream , hid her face in her hands , and dropped into a chair ; whereupon <NAME> was stricken motionless on the spot , and gazed from one to the other , with a countenance expressive of the extremities of horror and surprise .
He broke her heart. ' Agnes leaned upon his shoulder , and stole her arm about his neck .
' You had better get your wind now and change your clothes. ' Having addressed these words to the combatants , he saluted <NAME> , who then observed that the face of <NAME> was quite proportionate in size to his body ; that he had a very full under-lip , a hoarse voice , as though he were in the habit of shouting very much , and very short black hair , shaved off nearly to the crown of his head -- to admit ( as he afterwards learnt ) of his more easily wearing character wigs of any shape or pattern .
It was a ghastly figure to look upon .
<NAME> sat with his door wide open , that he might see him come into the <NAME> .
I played the game to an end with <NAME> , and she beggared me .
The noise of footsteps on the creaking stairs , a few minutes after the occurrence of this conversation , roused the merry old gentleman as he sat over the fire with a saveloy and a small loaf in his hand ; a pocket-knife in his right ; and a pewter pot on the trivet .
<NAME> drooped her head , and rose , and put up her work-basket <NAME> drew her hand through her arm , and they went out of the room like sisters .
Certainly not so many. " " Twice ? " " Jaggers , " interposed <NAME> , much to my relief , " leave my Pip alone , and go with him to your dinner. " He complied , and we groped our way down the dark stairs together .
So what , " continued <NAME> , confident again by this time , " do I naturally turn my thoughts to ? "
I made an exception of you at first .
That thought I never had .
" 'She is dead , ' said I .

A gloomy person with tangled locks , and a general air of having been reared under the shadow of that baleful tree of <NAME> which has given shelter to more lies than the whole botanical kingdom , <NAME> , nevertheless , treated him with unaccountable consideration .
' That ' s the point , ' said his sister .
" <NAME> , my dear , " said <NAME> , recovering his cheerfulness , " these are strong words of advice , but I live in <NAME> <NAME> and have seen a sight here .
Mr <NAME> , struck with the humour of this jest , and carrying out its spirit to the utmost , sought from his wide connection a pair of friends whose joint possessions fell some halfpence short of fifteen pence , and proffered them as bail -- for that was the merry word agreed upon both sides .
It was very edifying to see these unbelievers shake their heads and frown , and hear them hold forth strongly upon navigation : not that they knew anything about it , but that they always mistrusted the captain in calm weather , or when the wind was adverse .
It was a scene of gaiety , glitter , and show ; of richly-dressed people , handsome mirrors , chalked floors , girandoles and wax-candles ; and in all parts of the scene , gliding from spot to spot in silent softness , bowing obsequiously to this party , nodding familiarly to that , and smiling complacently on all , was the sprucely-attired person of <NAME> , <NAME> , the <NAME> of the <NAME> .

" Captain Swosser of the <NAME> , who was Mrs. <NAME> 's first husband , was a very distinguished officer indeed .
' I ain ' t doing any harm here , am I ? ' <NAME> in reply repeated the word ' bell ' as loud as he could roar ; and , his meaning being rendered further intelligible to Mrs. Sliderskew ' s dull sense of hearing by pantomime expressive of ringing at a street-door , <NAME> hobbled out , after sharply demanding why he hadn ' t said there was a ring before , instead of talking about all manner of things that had nothing to do with it , and keeping her half-pint of beer waiting on the steps .
No Poetry and no Art ever charmed the imagination more than the union of the two in this counterfeit cottage charmed <NAME> .
These provisions laid in , we went on through a great noise and uproar that confused my weary head beyond description , and over a bridge which , no doubt , was <NAME> ( indeed I think he told me so , but I was half asleep ) , until we came to the poor person ' s house , which was a part of some alms-houses , as I knew by their look , and by an inscription on a stone over the gate which said they were established for twenty-five poor women .
It was quite enough , she said , that she had told me <NAME> was going to be married ; and that I now knew better than anyone how true it was .
He had been at his books when I had found myself staring at him , and I now saw that he was inky .

The girl must know , well , that if she shook him off , she could never be safe from his fury , and that it would be surely wreaked -- to the maiming of limbs , or perhaps the loss of life -- on the object of her more recent fancy .
These she put on , out on the staircase , first shutting and locking the door and taking away the key .
He was a mighty monarch .
' There was a time , ' said Mr Casby , ' when your parents and myself were not on friendly terms .
You dined over the way .

<NAME> would take this reproof very quietly , and Mrs. Nickleby , making every board creak and every thread rustle as she moved stealthily about , would add : ' My son <NAME> has just come home , and I have come , according to custom , my dear , to know , from your own lips , exactly how you are ; for he won ' t take my account , and never will. ' ' He is later than usual to-night , ' perhaps <NAME> would reply .
She listened to her father as he told her about me , with a pleasant face ; and when he had concluded , proposed to my aunt that we should go upstairs and see my room .

One Sunday when <NAME> , greatly enjoying his pipe , had so plumed himself on being " most awful dull , " that I had given him up for the day , I lay on the earthwork for some time with my chin on my hand , descrying traces of <NAME> and <NAME> all over the prospect , in the sky and in the water , until at last I resolved to mention a thought concerning them that had been much in my head .

Could he ever forget how that woman had wept over his pillow , and called him her own child !

It is a good and happy sleep -- eh ? ' ' Indeed it is , ' returned the bachelor .
' And be sure you treat this lovely woman with everything of the best. ' While they were going along to take boat , ' Don ' t you wish , my dear , ' said R. W. , timidly , ' that your mother was here ? ' ' <NAME> , I don ' t , <NAME> , for I like to have you all to myself to-day .

' What is it , <NAME> ? ' ' A letter for you , sir , being left in the Lodge just this minute , and a message with it , I thought , happening to be there myself , sir , I would bring it to your room.

After some pause , a door of communication with another room was opened , and a lady entered .

" Do you mean your husband ? "
After sitting silent in the carriage watching <NAME> for some time , she took her hand and kissed it passionately .
She heeded no more what they said , than if she had had no ears .
" And advancing ? " " If you come to advancing you know , " said <NAME> , delighted to be able to make another admission , " nobody can doubt that. " " Then what on earth is your meaning , <NAME> ? " demanded <NAME> , perceptibly crestfallen .
I am sure there ought to be no third party present at anything so very kind and so very serious ; and so , if you ' ll remove the third party upstairs , my dear , the third party will retire. ' <NAME> took the hand which the dolls ' dressmaker held out to her for the purpose of being supported away , but only looked at her with an inquiring smile , and made no other movement .
' But I <NAME> , <NAME> , ' Mrs <NAME> hinted , after a little hesitation , ' if <NAME> wants an orphan <NAME> nineteen , who drives a cart and waters the roads. ' Mr <NAME> referred the point to Mrs Boffin in a look ; on that smiling lady ' s shaking her black velvet bonnet and bows , he remarked , in lower spirits , ' that ' s true again. ' ' I am sure , ' said <NAME> , concerned at giving so much trouble , ' that if I had known you would have taken so much pains , sir -- and you too , ma ' am -- I don ' t think I would have come. ' ' PRAY don ' t say that ! ' urged <NAME> .
Suppose you were to go down into the old part of the country again , for instance , and see that -- that out-of-the-way woman with the savagest of names , ' said my aunt , rubbing her nose , for she could never thoroughly forgive Peggotty for being so called .
' <NAME> , dear , advise me. ' Upon this , Emily and <NAME> , and <NAME> and <NAME> , crowded into a corner , and conversed earnestly in whispers for some minutes , during which the fat boy dozed .
'And what have I heard !
<NAME> <NAME> locked his door for him as they went out , slided the key into his pocket with great dexterity , and led the way to his own residence .
I went to <NAME> to find you ; not finding you , I went to <NAME> 's to find <NAME> Herbert. " " And him you found ? " said I , with great anxiety .
When that was done , the basket , which was filled with grapes and other fruit , was unpacked , and all its contents were quietly put away .
It is better for the poor little plaything to die so , than to live .
' Wa ' et be the matther noo ?
" You are fettered , " said <NAME> , trembling .

' Confound the girl , I am half afraid of her .
<NAME> pretence as it is , these allusions to her being expected keep up hope within him .

how the long-forgotten thoughts of former days rushed upon his mind , as he almost ran up and down the narrow yard -- as if intelligence would arrive the sooner for his hurrying -- and how bitterly a sense of his helplessness and desolation rushed upon him , when he heard the truth !
A stage or two further on , the lamps were lighted , and a great to-do occasioned by the taking up , at a roadside inn , of a very fastidious lady with an infinite variety of cloaks and small parcels , who loudly lamented , for the behoof of the outsides , the non-arrival of her own carriage which was to have taken her on , and made the guard solemnly promise to stop every green chariot he saw coming ; which , as it was a dark night and he was sitting with his face the other way , that officer undertook , with many fervent asseverations , to do .
Here , as in many institutions , no uniform is worn ; and I was very glad of it , for two reasons .
I never was so ashamed in my life to hear a man talk folly as I have been to hear you talk this day to the present company .
It may be objected that they are not adapted to the daylight , but everybody knows that they would glitter if there were lamps ; and nothing can be clearer than that if people give fancy-balls in the day-time , and the dresses do not show quite as well as they would by night , the fault lies solely with the people who give the fancy-balls , and is in no wise chargeable on the spangles .

<NAME> quantities of flour form the chief item in the freight of these vessels .

' A gentleman we met on the road , coming up from the country , recommended us here , ' said <NAME> , nudging <NAME> , perhaps to call her attention to this most ingenious device for attracting respect , and perhaps to warn her to betray no surprise .
But , the charm was broken .
" In short , " said <NAME> , " this is a desperate time , when desperate games are played for desperate stakes .
Here I stand , with the contamination of a jail upon me ; but it is possible that you may think me better suited to her than her former husband was. ' He had a certain air of being a handsome man -- which he was not ; and a certain air of being a well-bred man -- which he was not .

Mr <NAME> was the first to lift up his head and speak .
There was another , and a darker object , to be gained .
' I ' ll tell you what , <NAME> , ' remarked his wife as the door closed , ' I think that young chap ' s turning silly. ' ' I hope not , ' said the schoolmaster ; ' for he ' s a handy fellow out of doors , and worth his meat and drink , anyway .
' By the <NAME> , I do ! ' With a very different shake of the head and deep sigh , <NAME> said , ' Thank you , sir , I wish you good day. ' So he left <NAME> swelling at his own portrait on the wall , as if he were going to explode himself into it ; and Mrs. Sparsit still ambling on with her foot in her stirrup , looking quite cast down by the popular vices .

And now , <NAME> ' s right hand closed again upon the ring in its little case , and again was checked by the consideration : ' It is certain , now , that I am to give it back to him ; then why should I tell her of it ?

In lieu of the endearments of childhood in its sweetest aspect , heap upon him all its pains and wants , its sicknesses and ills , its fretfulness , caprice , and querulous endurance : let its prattle be , not of engaging infant fancies , but of cold , and thirst , and hunger : and if his fatherly affection outlive all this , and he be patient , watchful , tender ; careful of his children ' s lives , and mindful always of their joys and sorrows ; then send him back to <NAME> , and <NAME> , and to <NAME> , and when he hears fine talk of the depravity of those who live from hand to mouth , and labour hard to do it , let him speak up , as one who knows , and tell those holders forth that they , by parallel with such a class , should be <NAME> in their daily lives , and lay but humble siege to Heaven at last .
Then , he had his own lesson for the next day to prepare ; and at this , he would work hard , in a little room which looked into the garden , till evening came slowly on , when the ladies would walk out again , and he with them : listening with such pleasure to all they said : and so happy if they wanted a flower that he could climb to reach , or had forgotten anything he could run to fetch : that he could never be quick enough about it .
' There ' s small glasses on the shelf , ' said <NAME> to his daughter .
<NAME> wondered very much what could have occasioned this altered behaviour on the part of the collector ; but , philosophically reflecting that he would most likely know , sooner or later , and that he could perfectly afford to wait , he was very little disturbed by the singularity of the old gentleman ' s deportment .
Now , pray , <NAME> , " said Mrs. Jellyby , for <NAME> was kissing her , " do n't delay me in my work , but let me clear off this heavy batch of papers before the afternoon post comes in ! "

He ' s a little dusty , but he ' s very like you in tone .
<NAME> has a rising reputation among the lawyers , I believe ? ' ' Well , sir , ' returned the waiter , ' probably he has , sir ; but I am not aware of it myself. ' This waiter , who was middle-aged and spare , looked for help to a waiter of more authority -- a stout , potential old man , with a double chin , in black breeches and stockings , who came out of a place like a churchwarden ' s pew , at the end of the coffee-room , where he kept company with a cash-box , a Directory , a Law-list , and other books and papers .

Having made this arrangement with great despatch , he assisted Mary in the long-deferred occupation of shaking the carpets .
I am the man as is guaranteed , by unimpeachable references , to be a out-and-outer in morals and uprightness of principle .

' Mr Dombey , in a paroxysm of rage , made another grasp at the bell-rope that was not there , and , in its absence , pulled his hair rather than nothing .
I was surprised to see that all this time everything was done by the child , and that there appeared to be no other persons but ourselves in the house .

<NAME> , then , of what we had read together , I thought of the two men who went up into the Temple to pray , and I knew there were no better words that I could say beside his bed , than " O Lord , be merciful to him a sinner !

' I know you ' ll excuse me , <NAME> , my dear , but I don ' t like to do this before a third person ; indeed , before a young man it would not be quite proper , though really , after all , I don ' t know what harm there is in it , except that to be sure it ' s not a very becoming thing , though some people say it is very much so , and really I don ' t know why it should not be , if it ' s well got up , and the borders are small-plaited ; of course , a good deal depends upon that.

said <NAME> as we went downstairs .
We all took some , but our appreciation of it was gone , and we merely made a show of eating it .
He was shown into the little back study , where sat <NAME> and his friend <NAME> , with decanters and glasses before them .

He never rode a match on the swiftest animal in his costly stud , with half the speed at which he had torn along the course that ended in the Fleet .

The women , led by <NAME> and <NAME> , often repeat ' a hun-dred thou-sand pound !

Determined to assure Mr Dombey , in so far as it was possible to give him the assurance without expressing it in words , that indeed he mistook his nature , <NAME> had been anxious to show even more cheerfulness and activity after the <NAME> interview than he had shown before : if that were possible , in one of his quick and zealous disposition .
' As if , ' said <NAME> , ' as if the churchyard ghosts were rising. ' He had walked to the window with his cigar in his mouth , to exalt its flavour by comparing the fireside with the outside , when he stopped midway on his return to his arm-chair , and said : ' Apparently one of the ghosts has lost its way , and dropped in to be directed .
Who so mindful of those he left at home -- albeit they were but a mother and two young babies -- as <NAME> ?

' <NAME> , ' she said at length .
' His name ! ' cried <NAME> .
<NAME> and myself will be able , when the time comes , to hold our own -- the <NAME> , in other words , will be able to hold its own , and maintain its own , and hand down its own of itself , and without any such common-place aids .
All the tobacco thus dealt with , was in course of manufacture for chewing ; and one would have supposed there was enough in that one storehouse to have filled even the comprehensive jaws of <NAME> .

" Esther , it 's enough to make anybody but me jealous , " said <NAME> , laughing and shaking her head ; " but it only makes me joyful , for you are the first friend I ever had , and the best friend I ever can have , and nobody can respect and love you too much to please me . "
The old , white-headed father , too -- such deference -- such respect -- such devoted friendship -- he worshipped me !
When I saw you , for the first time , coming out at the door , with your quaint little basket of keys hanging at your side ? ' ' It is just the same , ' said <NAME> , smiling .
God bless you ! ' And it showed , <NAME> thought , how easily one might do injustice to a person ; for <NAME> meant it -- though she was a Forcer -- and felt it .

' Such was , and in such an attitude sat <NAME> ' s papa , who had been in the profession ever since he had first played the ten-year-old imps in the <NAME> pantomimes ; who could sing a little , dance a little , fence a little , act a little , and do everything a little , but not much ; who had been sometimes in the ballet , and sometimes in the chorus , at every theatre in <NAME> ; who was always selected in virtue of his figure to play the military visitors and the speechless noblemen ; who always wore a smart dress , and came on arm-in-arm with a smart lady in short petticoats , -- and always did it too with such an air that people in the pit had been several times known to cry out ' Bravo ! ' under the impression that he was somebody .
<NAME> <NAME> , with manifest tokens of astonishment , took the diminutive document , and found it to run concisely thus : -- Dolls attended at their own residences .
<NAME> <NAME> thought so also ; but , under all the circumstances , he considered it a matter of sound policy to be silent .
Other people had thought of such things , if I had not .
Not in summer , as common pigs do now , to cool themselves , and did even in those distant ages ( which is a proof that the light of civilisation had already begun to dawn , though feebly ) , but in the cold , sharp days of winter .
I lie down now , to ease my head .
' I ' m a-comin ' , sir , ' replied <NAME> , mechanically following his master ; and still he lifted not his eyes from <NAME> , who walked at his side in silence .
He furthermore conjured him to avoid , above all things , the vice of intoxication , which he likened unto the filthy habits of swine , and to those poisonous and baleful drugs which being chewed in the mouth , are said to filch away the memory .
My aunt received a few lines next day in reply ; addressed , outside , to her ; within , to me .
But , had it been the beginning of some great labour with the same end in view -- had it been the commencement of a long journey , to be performed on foot in that inclement season of the year , to be pursued under very privation and difficulty , and to be achieved only with great distress , fatigue , and suffering -- had it been the dawn of some painful enterprise , certain to task his utmost powers of resolution and endurance , and to need his utmost fortitude , but only likely to end , if happily achieved , in good fortune and delight to <NAME> -- <NAME> ' s cheerful zeal would have been as highly roused : <NAME> ' s ardour and impatience would have been , at least , the same .
<NAME> think so , <NAME> ? ' ' <NAME> , ' returned <NAME> ; ' and you acted upon that principle when I meet you on horseback on the road , after our memorable evening. ' ' Sure-ly , ' said <NAME> .
N -- n -- no , I don ' t know you. ' The man replied , ' No , you don ' t know me. ' And so they stood looking at one another surlily enough , until <NAME> came back .
' Does he requite her affection ? ' ' <NAME> kindness , considerate self-denying kindness , is not in his nature , ' returned <NAME> .
' He is , ' said the middle-aged lady .
I propose to consecrate this little retreat , by having a ceremony in which I take a great interest , performed there .
Much as my dear boy was , unhappily , too self-conscious and self-satisfied ( I ' ll draw no parallel between him and you in that respect ) to love as he should have loved , or as any one in his place would have loved—must have loved ! ' She sits in the same still attitude , but shrinking a little more .
How from counting months , we came to weeks , and then to days ; and how I then began to be afraid that I should not be sent for and when I learnt from <NAME> that I had been sent for , and was certainly to go home , had dim forebodings that I might break my leg first .
I am a keeping that young man from harming of you at the present moment , with great difficulty .
" Then , sir , " returns the trooper in a decisive manner , " it appears to me -- being naturally in the vagabond way myself -- that the sooner he comes out of the street , the better .
With his hat thrown back upon his ears as if his wiry prongs of hair had darted up like springs and cast it off , with his jet-black beads of eyes inquisitively sharp , with the fingers of his right hand in his mouth that he might bite the nails , and with the fingers of his left hand in reserve in his pocket for another course , Mr <NAME> cast his shadow through the glass upon the books and papers .
' What ' s this ? ' repeated Mr Dombey , almost foaming .
' I only ask from curiosity , my dear. ' ' Well , then , if you want to know , ' rejoined Mrs. Squeers , ' I ' ll tell you .
It is a retired situation .
'Go on , ' said the person addressed , turning away his face .
He had that good reason for sympathy with haughtiness and coldness , which is found in a fellow-feeling .
<NAME> could say no more .
Both gentlemen laughed for some time .
' Not on no account , ' replied the inexorable creditor .
As they abased themselves before him , <NAME> took a seat , and waved his hand in his most courtly manner .
When we passed through a village , I pictured to myself what the insides of the houses were like , and what the inhabitants were about ; and when boys came running after us , and got up behind and swung there for a little way , I wondered whether their fathers were alive , and whether they were happy at home .
My credentials , entries , and memoranda , are all comprehended in the one line , 'Recalled to <NAME> ; ' which may mean anything .
' Now , gentlemen , ' said <NAME> , tossing a great bundle of papers into a wicker basket at his feet , and throwing himself back in his chair with his arms over the elbows , ' you are dissatisfied with my conduct , I see by the newspapers. ' ' Yes , <NAME> , we are , ' said a plump old gentleman in a violent heat , bursting out of the throng , and planting himself in the front .
I Fall into <NAME> V. I Am <NAME> VI .
<NAME> don ' t hurry. ' ' Let me get my bundle right , <NAME> , and I ' m with you. ' As he ties it afresh , he is once more conscious that he is very narrowly observed .
' What did you want to say ? ' demanded <NAME> , shaking him .
Having parted from her with what may be conjectured to have been a rather bony kiss of a cosmetic flavour , he gave his daughter his blessing , graciously .
' He ' s quite a Troubadour , you know ; quite a Troubadour ! ' These complimentary expressions were uttered in a somewhat absent and distracted manner ; for the unfortunate lawyer , besides having a bad cold in his head , had got wet in coming , and would have willingly borne some pecuniary sacrifice if he could have shifted his present raw quarters to a warm room , and dried himself at a fire .
<NAME> sharp , or <NAME> will think I 'm lost . '
I have never been in the streets with one of them. ' ' Heard me talked of among ' em , though ? ' ' No .
don ' t you understand ? ' And out of that look he vanished from her view .
' Pe-e-e-ill ! ' Horses make a desperate struggle .
The major part of the conversation was confined to Mrs. Weller and the reverend <NAME> ; and the topics principally descanted on , were the virtues of the shepherd , the worthiness of his flock , and the high crimes and misdemeanours of everybody beside -- dissertations which the elder <NAME> occasionally interrupted by half-suppressed references to a gentleman of the name of <NAME> , and other running commentaries of the same kind .
' Ask -- HEEP -- if he ever kept a pocket-book in that house , ' said <NAME> ; ' will you ? ' I saw <NAME> ' s lank hand stop , involuntarily , in the scraping of his chin .
That ' s exactly what I am incapable of doing .
Observing that he made no sketch , however , and that he talked about business only , she began to have suspicions that he represented some creditor of her father ' s , the balance due to whom was noted in that pocket volume .
The air , even in these distempered parts , is fresh after the stifling atmosphere of the houses ; and now , as we emerge into a broader street , it blows upon us with a purer breath , and the stars look bright again .
Wherefore , he only muttered a brief defiance of his master , and did as he was ordered .
<NAME> , <NAME> , is not a bad or a degrading quality .
' He ' s gone ! ' cried <NAME> , who , with the other second , had run up to the body , and fallen on one knee beside it .
If you walley my precious life don ' t upset me , as the gen ' l ' m ' n said to the driver when they was a-carryin ' him to Tyburn. ' And quickening his pace to a sharp run , <NAME> wheeled his master nimbly to the green hill , shot him dexterously out by the very side of the basket , and proceeded to unpack it with the utmost despatch .
The way he ' d sit and chuckle over himself !
' Ah , ' said <NAME> , with great sharpness , ' Oh , them " Blimbers " ' ' Don ' t blame anyone , ' said <NAME> .
After the momentary distraction of <NAME> Cuttle ' s address , which he regarded with lofty indifference , Mr Dombey again turned his eyes upon his son , and sat steadily regarding the child , for some moments , in silence .
I ' m a-goin ' to vork a coach reg ' lar , and ha ' n ' t got noveres to keep it in , unless I vos to pay the guard for takin ' care on it , or to put it in vun o ' the coach pockets , vich ' ud be a temptation to the insides .
But you -- where are you going , where are you coming from , what have you been doing since you left me , what had you been doing before ?
One ancestress of <NAME> , in high-heeled shoes , very like her -- casting the shadow of that virgin event before her full two centuries -- shoots out into a halo and becomes a saint .
<NAME> , being occasionally abstracted and melancholy , is to this day reputed a great poet among his friends and acquaintance , although we do not find that he has ever written anything to encourage the belief .
I won ' t deduct for it ; I look to you to make it up handsomely by keeping the expenses down .
He was a sort of town traveller for a number of miscellaneous houses , now ; but made little or nothing of it , I am afraid .
She was a golden-haired doll ! " " Do you know , <NAME> , " said <NAME> , looking at him with sharp eyes , and slowly drawing a hand across his florid face : " do you know , I rather thought , at the time , that you sympathised with the golden-haired doll , and were quick to see what happened to the golden-haired doll ? " " Quick to see what happened !
<NAME> <NAME> received such patients here as his old reputation , and its revival in the floating whispers of his story , brought him .
There was a broad strong ledge of stone to this grating where the bottom of it was let into the masonry , three or four feet above the ground .
After a little discussion , he proposed to take my aunt to the school , that she might see it and judge for herself ; also , to take her , with the same object , to two or three houses where he thought I could be boarded .
'If it was <NAME> , or the <NAME> , or <NAME> , or -- ' ' I do n't care who , ' replied <NAME> impatiently .
' She understands that , anyways , ' muttered <NAME> , watching <NAME> as she dispatched her portion , and choked and gasped in a most awful manner after so doing .
They returned home to breakfast , and all went well , and in due course the golden hair that had mingled with the poor shoemaker 's white locks in the <NAME> garret , were mingled with them again in the morning sunlight , on the threshold of the door at parting .
However , they booked twelve people inside ; and the luggage ( including such trifles as a large rocking-chair , and a good-sized dining-table ) being at length made fast upon the roof , we started off in great state .
Nothing can be tided over now , <NAME> .
'She shall , ' said Mrs. Maylie .
Bent upon this purpose , and in that mood in which delay is insupportable , he repaired at once to the place ; and being , by description , perfectly acquainted with the situation of his room , crept upstairs and knocked gently at the door .
Many a night and many a day had its inmates listened to the echoes in the corner , with hearts that failed them when they heard the thronging feet .
' <NAME> wants , ' she said to <NAME> , ' to go to London. ' ' Why to <NAME> ? ' returned <NAME> .
As he walked up and down that part of the courtyard which was at the side of the house , with the stray rooks and jackdaws looking after him with their heads cocked slyly , as if they knew how much more knowing they were in worldly affairs than he , if any sort of vagabond could only get near enough to his creaking shoes to attract his attention to one sentence of a tale of distress , that vagabond was made for the next two days .
I would sooner send him away , though I know I am the only person who appreciates him , than have him , and not spend his money on himself .
So , keeping to byways , and shunning human approach , this troublesome old woman hid herself , and fared on all through the dreary day .
You 're a scorpion -- a brimstone scorpion !
I called to his recollection the <NAME> maid and the eager offer of herself she had made to me .
I only use the word to express a monster in a lecturing castle , with <NAME> knows how many heads manipulated into one , taking childhood captive , and dragging it into gloomy statistical dens by the hair .
It was only a moment that I stopped him , for he cut me heavily an instant afterwards , and in the same instant I caught the hand with which he held me in my mouth , between my teeth , and bit it through .
<NAME> <NAME> presents his compliments to <NAME> , <NAME> , and has to call HIS attention to the fact that he totally denies the whole of <NAME> 's positions on every possible subject and has to add , in reference to closing up the pathway , that he will be glad to see the man who may undertake to do it . '
<NAME> combined with the attractions of her youth and beauty , a certain weight of self-sustainment as if she had been married twenty years .
She breathes quickly and heavily , but she stands as unflinchingly as ever he has seen her in the midst of her grandest company .
'Wot a precious strange gal that is ! '
Here , the moonlight is so very bright again that the colours of the nearest stained-glass window are thrown upon their faces .
A letter lay on his table .
Under these circumstances , when <NAME> and <NAME> had got the children into the house , like a little flock of sheep , and <NAME> came out of it to make my acquaintance , I was not much surprised to find that <NAME> was a gentleman with a rather perplexed expression of face , and with his very gray hair disordered on his head , as if he did n't quite see his way to putting anything straight .
Although at another time Mr <NAME> might have looked upon this as a doubtful compliment , he felt it , under the then-existing circumstances , a great relief to be assured that he was not wrongfully suspected .
" But the question , <NAME> .
What do you mean ? ' ' I beg your pardon , sir , ' pleaded Mr <NAME> , ' I was wishful to know -- ' ' You wished to know nothing , sir , ' cried Mr Dorrit , highly flushed .
He was going to spend the evening at some private house in the neighbourhood , had ordered the boots to sit up until his return , and had taken his servant with him .
When they take their inventions into foreign countries , that ' s quite different .
When he lay down on his straw bed , he thought he had done with this world .
What can YOU come for , because we are all very sure before-hand that you are not going to talk !
' Good man ! ' replied <NAME> ; ' bless your heart and soul , my dear Sir , <NAME> is at the very top of his profession .
<NAME> morning , sir , much obliged. -- Door ! " The last word was flung at the boy , who had not the least notion what it meant .
The break he set between his last two sentences was quite embarrassing to his hearer .
But to explain why Mr <NAME> reined in his horse quickly , and what he looked at in no small surprise , a few digressive words are necessary .
' They should be so , of course .
<NAME> , bring in Mr Abel ' s articles. ' ' You see , Mr Witherden , ' said the old lady , ' that <NAME> has not been brought up like the run of young men .
' If that ' s <NAME> , ' Miss <NAME> made proclamation , in her most commanding tones , ' let him instantly come underneath here. ' The submissive <NAME> complied , attended by a crowd .
In the corner by the chimney stand a deal table and a broken desk , a wilderness marked with a rain of ink .
' I ' m glad to hear it , but I don ' t remember when .
' While I was foreman at the Bower -- afore it WAS the Bower -- I considered the business very satisfactory .
He had a reason for going away , though it was an insufficient one . "
' I wanted to speak to him. ' ' What did you want to say ? ' asked half a dozen voices at once .
And she handed me the key across the counter .
Two pairs of eyes not unused to such people look after him , as , biting his nails and brooding , he crosses the square and is swallowed up by the shadow of the southern gateway .
Give him the new bill to sign , <NAME> , and he 'll sign it like a man . "
His arm trembled as it raised her , and supported her head .
Now , it is of no use asking too much of me .
But it pleases me to hear the old music , though I am very bad. ' ' You are a traveller !
The floors were scrubbed to that extent , that you might have supposed the <NAME> blacks emancipated for ever , and gone out of the land for good .
' What wages do you get ? ' ' <NAME> what I could wish , ' replied young Blight .
I think there are some odd shillings or pence , if you are very particular. ' Mr Lammle bestows a by no means loving look upon the partner of his joys and sorrows , and he mutters something ; but checks himself .
' Now tell me I ' m a liar ! ' said the honest man .
<NAME> and wide lay a ruined country , yielding nothing but desolation .
While out on his hospitable preparations , he looks in on <NAME> ; and mentions that dear Ned , and that inflammable young spark of <NAME> ' s , are to dine at the gatehouse to-day , and make up their difference .
It ' s the case with my own wife .
I squeezed it dry to-day. ' ' Nonsense , sir .
He was not singing as usual , nor was he seated at his desk .
In the majority of the shameful cases of disease and death from destitution , that shock the <NAME> and disgrace the country , the illegality is quite equal to the inhumanity -- and known language could say no more of their lawlessness .
Come in ! ' ' I beg your pardon , Mr Carker .
What I missed , I still regarded -- I always regarded -- as something that had been a dream of my youthful fancy ; that was incapable of realization ; that I was now discovering to be so , with some natural pain , as all men did .
One of these expeditions led them through the churchyard where was his father ' s grave .
For he was furnished with that completeness that if the coach-lamps had been blown and stormed out , which did occasionally happen , he had only to shut himself up inside , keep the flint and steel sparks well off the straw , and get a light with tolerable safety and ease ( if he were lucky ) in five minutes .
After a very gallant parting on his side , and a very cool and gentlemanly sort of one on hers , he nodded to <NAME> , and withdrew with the attorney .
' Because I should change ; not those about me .
' That is my brave boy , ' said <NAME> .
Put it to her ladyship , if you think it right , from <NAME> of the Detective .
But as I mentioned to my friend <NAME> , I could not admit the criminality of my lovely and accomplished relative until it was perfectly established .
One of you is enough. ' ' You have an accurate memory of your own , ' said Mr Dombey .
' Prepare yourself for intelligence which , if you have any human feeling in your breast , will make even you shrink and tremble .
I never made them. " Waiting until she was quiet again , -- for this , too , flashed out of her in a wild and sudden way , -- I went on .
Oh dear , dear , what a man it is ! ' ' <NAME> of the bygones do you want to revive ? ' said <NAME> .
Besides , it is in the way of trade .
I don ' t feel quite myself .
' That is what alarms me so much. ' ' Instant measures must be taken , ' said <NAME> .
If it turns out that he warn ' t at the <NAME> Fellowships that night at midnight , I ' m a liar. ' ' What did he say ? ' ' I ' ll tell you ( take me down , <NAME> ' other Governor , I ask no better ) .
you are not put upon your trial before a Court of <NAME> , at present , <NAME> , ' returned Mr Dombey , chafing , ' and therefore it don ' t matter. ' ' My dear <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , in a warning voice , ' I must be spoken to kindly , or there is an end of me , ' at the same time a premonitory redness developed itself in Mrs Chick ' s eyelids which was an invariable sign of rain , unless the weather changed directly .
" I am glad of your good opinion . "
' As I am so fortunate as to have met you , let me press my petition. ' She looked down for a moment at his glistening mouth ; and he looked up at her , standing above him in her stately dress , and thought , again , how beautiful she was .
My schooling was paid for ; it was a bargain ; and when I came away , the bargain ended. ' It was a fundamental principle of the <NAME> philosophy that everything was to be paid for .
<NAME> tell me what it is. ' I replied that I had no complaint to make , either of my Mistress or to my <NAME> ; but I must go .
It was <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> .
Now , I hear <NAME> 's step coming to the door .
Stretching forth his flabby paw , <NAME> lays the same on Jo 's arm and considers where to station him .
LEAVING <NAME> on the afternoon of Saturday the fifth of February , we proceeded by another railroad to Worcester : a pretty <NAME> town , where we had arranged to remain under the hospitable roof of the Governor of the State , until Monday morning .
To this Ladies ' Seminary , then , <NAME> hied , with designs obnoxious to the peace of the fair Sophia , who , arrayed in virgin white , embellished by no ornament but one blushing rose , received him on his arrival , in the midst of very elegant not to say brilliant preparations ; such as the embellishment of the room with the little flower-pots which always stood on the window-sill outside , save in windy weather when they blew into the area ; the choice attire of the day-scholars who were allowed to grace the festival ; the unwonted curls of <NAME> Wackles who had kept her head during the whole of the preceding day screwed up tight in a yellow play-bill ; and the solemn gentility and stately bearing of the old lady and her eldest daughter , which struck Mr Swiveller as being uncommon but made no further impression upon him .
He is at his place in <NAME> ; but the waters are out again on the low-lying grounds , and the cold and damp steal into <NAME> , though well defended , and eke into <NAME> 's bones .
' <NAME> to do it , were you ? ' said <NAME> .
He says it with such a pitiable air , and his grimy tears appear so real , and he lies in the corner up against the hoarding so like a growth of fungus or any unwholesome excrescence produced there in neglect and impurity , that <NAME> is softened towards him .
There had been rain all day , and there was a damp feeling in the air .
When he left me for my good—he never would have left me for his own—I know he was almost broken-hearted with the trial .
My position as a mutual friend requires it , sir. ' <NAME> paused with a most impressive look , and diving into the hat before noticed , drew from thence a small piece of whity-brown paper curiously folded , whence he brought forth a note which it had served to keep clean , and handing it over to <NAME> , said -- ' Have the goodness to read that , sir. ' Nicholas , in a state of much amazement , took the note and broke the seal , glancing at <NAME> as he did so , who , knitting his brow and pursing up his mouth with great dignity , was sitting with his eyes steadily fixed upon the ceiling .
I come up in a cab , and the cab ' s waiting to be paid .
" Very magnanimous indeed , sir , " observed my guardian .
The ravages committed by this unfortunate , rendering her dismissal necessary , she was succeeded ( with intervals of Mrs. Kidgerbury ) by a long line of <NAME> ; terminating in a young person of genteel appearance , who went to <NAME> in <NAME> ' s bonnet .
<NAME> came round for me at dinner-time .
' To think of your going and attacking me , that have always been a friend to you !
However , he would n't be , and there was an end of it . "
She began to forget him soon after her discovery of the <NAME> family .
But never mind them just now .
" I know your engagements , " said he , " and I know you are out of sorts , <NAME> .
His adversary saw the advantage he had gained , and followed it up .
He introduces <NAME> , and then he is good friends with <NAME> and borrows five pounds of him .
<NAME> , now permanently heavy , did not release <NAME> from the survey of the house , until it had extended even to his old garret bedchamber .
It is late ; I need say no more to-night .
Containing <NAME> of a surprising Kind ' As we gang awa ' fra ' Lunnun tomorrow neeght , and as I dinnot know that I was e ' er so happy in a ' my days , <NAME> , Ding !
" Says you , 'Joseph , he gave me a little message , which I will now repeat .
See another reason for urging it on !
It is too insolvent a state of things for any one with any self-respect to entertain , and is universally scouted .
<NAME> <NAME> had been so fully occupied in falling about , and disentangling himself , miraculously , from between the legs of horses , that he had not enjoyed sufficient leisure to observe the scene before him , until it assumed the appearance we have just described .
Her son , ' said Mr Toots , as an additional recommendation , ' was educated in the <NAME> , and blown up in a powder-mill. ' <NAME> accepting this kind offer , Mr <NAME> conducted her to his dwelling , where they were received by the <NAME> in question who fully justified his character of her , and by the Chicken who at first supposed , on seeing a lady in the vehicle , that Mr <NAME> had been doubled up , ably to his old recommendation , and <NAME> abducted .
This was the utmost description <NAME> could give me .
I verily believe that her not remembering and not minding in the least , made me cry again , inwardly , -- and that is the sharpest crying of all .
" I have felt this strange feeling before , " said he , " I can not help thinking there ' s something wrong about that closet. " He made a strong effort , plucked up his courage , shivered the lock with a blow or two of the poker , opened the door , and there , sure enough , standing bolt upright in the corner , was the last tenant , with a little bottle clasped firmly in his hand , and his face -- well ! ' As the little old man concluded , he looked round on the attentive faces of his wondering auditory with a smile of grim delight .
In work alway Let my first years be past , That I may give for ev ' ry day Some good account at last. " ' A deep hum of applause rose not only from the two teachers , but from all the pupils , who were equally astonished to hear <NAME> improvising after this brilliant style ; for although she had been long known as a politician , she had never appeared before as an original poet .
' I could n't see 'em suffer before my very eyes , you know sir . '
By and by , there comes a great bustle downstairs , and a lanky chap with a red nose and a white neckcloth rushes up , and sings out , " Here ' s the shepherd a-coming to wisit his faithful flock ; " and in comes a fat chap in black , vith a great white face , a-smilin ' avay like clockwork .
It was quite sad and oppressive , to come upon great tracts where settlers had been burning down the trees , and where their wounded bodies lay about , like those of murdered creatures , while here and there some charred and blackened giant reared aloft two withered arms , and seemed to call down curses on his foes .
That , my dear <NAME> , appears to me to be his true position .
Surely you know , my dear , that all the greatest ornaments of <NAME> in knowledge , imagination , active humanity , and improvement of every sort are added to its nobility !
' You ' re quite a sailor , I suppose ? ' I said to <NAME> ' ly .
' Oh , nothing , nothing , ' replied <NAME> .
And as to plate , <NAME> bless you , we haven ' t so much as a tea-spoon. ' ' All to be earned ? ' said I , cheerfully .
As they find the fact , they will judge me .
'He 's drunk it all up , every drop , ' said Chitling after watching the dog some time in silence .
" He 's an invalid now , " replied <NAME> .
It was solely the effect of his internal emotions .
' He can not answer for others. ' ' My dear , ' returned <NAME> with sudden seriousness , ' I have no desire to answer for others .
' There ' s burning fever here , and something now and then to which I fear to give a name. ' The dwarf said never a word , but watched his companion as he paced restlessly up and down the room , and presently returned to his seat .
<NAME> <NAME> was a gentleman and a man of honour , and I put it to him first to give me his -- his own opinion .
And there , too , was a sprinkling of less distinguished Parliamentary <NAME> , who had not as yet got anything snug , and were going through their probation to prove their worthiness .
" You may observe , <NAME> , that I abstain from examining this paper myself .
For whom , perhaps with some old instinct of his race , the gentle <NAME> had spread a carpet .
" Walking here again , citizeness ? " " You see me , citizen ! " The wood-sawyer , who was a little man with a redundancy of gesture ( he had once been a mender of roads ) , cast a glance at the prison , pointed at the prison , and putting his ten fingers before his face to represent bars , peeped through them jocosely .
' Been out to-day , <NAME> ? ' Mrs <NAME> answered , for a short drive .
<NAME> and myself will constantly keep a double look-out together , on our goods and chattels .
' " Oh , the deception and villainy of the man ! " said the widow .
They asked me to look out for you , ' said the man .
Both expressed their opinion that a more independent , a more enlightened , a more public-spirited , a more noble- minded , a more disinterested set of men than those who had promised to vote for him , never existed on earth ; each darkly hinted his suspicions that the electors in the opposite interest had certain swinish and besotted infirmities which rendered them unfit for the exercise of the important duties they were called upon to discharge .
' Mr Rokesmith goes with us ? ' he said , hesitating , with a look towards the door .
It ' s all owing to your precious caution that they got hold of it .
" Such as they were , of course . "
We never did look at this subject from the same side , and we never shall .
" <NAME> -- that will do. " ' At this instant , while the <NAME> yet inhaled that delicious fragrance by holding the <NAME> to her exquisite , but thoughtfully-chiselled nose , the door of the <NAME> ( artfully concealed by rich hangings of silken damask , the hue of <NAME> ' s firmament ) was thrown open , and with noiseless tread two VALETS-DE-CHAMBRE , clad in sumptuous liveries of peach-blossom and gold , advanced into the room followed by a page in <NAME> SOIE -- silk stockings -- who , while they remained at some distance making the most graceful obeisances , advanced to the feet of his lovely mistress , and dropping on one knee presented , on a golden salver gorgeously chased , a scented <NAME> .
oh no , I have not been out of town , ' said <NAME> .
It appeared to have become a perfect passion with <NAME> , that the only son should be pitted against them .
By little and little <NAME> had grown stronger , and had become able to dispense with his carriage ; though he still looked thin and delicate ; and still remained the same old , quiet , dreamy child that he had been when first consigned to Mrs <NAME> ' s care .
You didn ' t exactly understand me , though ? ' I gave him a look , but no other answer ; and , going to my good old master , said a few words that I meant to be words of comfort and encouragement .

He heard me respectfully but without much heeding these words , which I spoke a little turned from him , already on my way to the door ; he was observing ( this they afterwards told me ) my height and figure , which seemed to catch his attention all at once .
There was no day ; it was gone as soon as come -- and night came on again ; night so long , and yet so short ; long in its dreadful silence , and short in its fleeting hours .
No magic dwelling-place in magic story , shut up in the heart of a thick wood , was ever more solitary and deserted to the fancy , than was her father ' s mansion in its grim reality , as it stood lowering on the street : always by night , when lights were shining from neighbouring windows , a blot upon its scanty brightness ; always by day , a frown upon its never-smiling face .
There was an universal cry of ' Alive or dead ? ' and then a deep , profound hush .
I will name no names , <NAME> , but so they are pleased to call him up town , and I have seen that man. " " I swear I do n't see him here , " said I .
' Your poor brother -- ' ' My poor brother , ma ' am , ' interposed <NAME> tartly , ' had no idea what business was -- was unacquainted , I verily believe , with the very meaning of the word. ' ' I fear he was , ' said Mrs. Nickleby , with her handkerchief to her eyes .

And in illustration it may be observed , that if Mr <NAME> , not being over-suspicious , had , without prying and listening , left his sister to manage the conference on their joint behalf , or prying and listening , had not been in such a mighty hurry to anticipate her ( which he would not have been , but for his distrust and jealousy ) , he would probably have found himself much better off in the end .

" The other patient lay in a back room across a second staircase , which was a species of loft over a stable .
' Oh , thank ' ee , <NAME> , don ' t it ! ' returned the sharp girl .

But when we recollect , in addition , how very cruel and severe it is , and that a solitary life is always liable to peculiar and distinct objections of a most deplorable nature , which have arisen here , and call to mind , moreover , that the choice is not between this system , and a bad or ill-considered one , but between it and another which has worked well , and is , in its whole design and practice , excellent ; there is surely more than sufficient reason for abandoning a mode of punishment attended by so little hope or promise , and fraught , beyond dispute , with such a host of evils .
Only hear what I have got to say -- only hear me. ' ' How did you come in our garden ? ' faltered the housemaid .

After that , she took the baby out of its little cradle , and nursed it .
' Nature of knowledge , <NAME> ? ' ' I thought he seemed to be a young fellow in a poor way , and I asked his leave—only within a day or so—to share my flowers up there with him ; that is to say , to extend my flower-garden to his windows. ' ' Would you have the kindness to take seats ? ' said <NAME> .

He never even seemed to come to his work on purpose , but would slouch in as if by mere accident ; and when he went to the <NAME> to eat his dinner , or went away at night , he would slouch out , like <NAME> or the Wandering Jew , as if he had no idea where he was going and no intention of ever coming back .

' Indeed , though attained by some wonderful winding narrow stairs , which seemed to have been erected in a pure white chimney , and though very low in the ceiling , and very rugged in the floor , and rather blinking as to the proportions of its lattice window , it was a pleasanter room than that despised chamber once at home , in which <NAME> had first bemoaned the miseries of taking lodgers .
<NAME> , in his best clothes , with his tall hat under his arm , his ivory-handled cane genteelly embarrassing his deportment , and a bundle of cigars in his hand !

As , whenever the <NAME> fell a-musing , his good mother took it to be an infallible sign that he ' wanted support , ' the blooming old lady made all haste to the dining-room closet , to produce from it the support embodied in a glass of <NAME> and a home-made biscuit .
Desperately , but not wildly , for she knew that if she lost distinctness of intention , all was lost and gone .
He would take the assertion of that honourable <NAME> whose voice he had just heard -- it was celebrated ; but if the fame of that treatise were to extend to the farthest confines of the known world , the pride with which he should reflect on the authorship of that production would be as nothing compared with the pride with which he looked around him , on this , the proudest moment of his existence .

Bleeding <NAME> had been harrowed by Mr <NAME> , and cropped by Mr Casby , at the regular seasons ; Mr <NAME> had taken all the drudgery and all the dirt of the business as _his_ share ; Mr <NAME> had taken all the profits , all the ethereal vapour , and all the moonshine , as his share ; and , in the form of words which that benevolent beamer generally employed on Saturday evenings , when he twirled his fat thumbs after striking the week ' s balance , ' everything had been satisfactory to all parties -- all parties -- satisfactory , sir , to all parties.

' ' By all means , ' said <NAME> .
' Your husband , I take it , is not at home ? ' he said .
You may know a black common fellow , or a black common boaster , when you see him ( and no doubt you have a large acquaintance that way ) ; but you are no judge of white men.

When they turned into a narrow street , <NAME> glanced at his window with a dread that always haunted his desolate home ; but it was open , as he had left it , and no one was there .

A handsome little dinner was served immediately , and Mr <NAME> sat sparkling at his end of the table , with his servant behind his chair , and HIS ever-lingering doubts upon the subject of his wages behind himself .
' This , sir , ' said <NAME> , ' is my wife , Mrs. Bounderby : <NAME> ' s eldest daughter .
<NAME> was my intimate companion and friend .
Sitting near her , with the white shoe , that had never been worn , in her hand , and her head bent as she looked at it , was an elegant lady whom I had never seen .

He made up his mouth as if to whistle , but he didn ' t whistle .
' They were made for one another , ' said the <NAME> , mournfully ; ' but what signifies that now ! ' ' Upon my word and honour , ' cried Mr Toots , blurting out his words through a singular combination of awkward chuckles and emotion , ' I ' m even more sorry than I was before .

April Fool Day after that , I says , 'Now , old chap , you 're two and a eight in it . '
" <NAME> ? " " And four ? " " And eight ? " " And six ? " " And two ? " " And ten ? " And so on .
' I am not doing office-work , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
And <NAME> said , decidedly , yes he did .
The back of the establishment , though the chief entrance was there , so contracted that it merely represented in its connexion with the front , the handle of a flat iron set upright on its broadest end .
Any dinner , <NAME> ? ' <NAME> opens a door at the upper end of the room , and discloses a small inner room pleasantly lighted and prepared , wherein a comely dame is in the act of setting dishes on table .
' Of course you know the <NAME> well ? ' ' Yes , sir , ' rejoined Mrs. Sparsit .
Crossing a courtyard which was all noise and bustle , and passing a couple of porters who seemed dressed to match the red fire engine which was wheeled away into a corner , they passed into an office where their business was to be transacted , and where <NAME> and <NAME> left them standing for a few moments , while they went upstairs into the <NAME> .
I could myself have kneeled down then , so far away , and blessed him in my rapture that he should be so truly good and brave .

<NAME> <NAME> hereupon addressed me again .
I want to speak to you. ' Behold me , on my gallant grey , bending at the side of <NAME> , with my hand upon the carriage door !
There is a meagre tree outside , where the sparrows are chirping a little ; and there is a blackbird in an eyelet-hole of sun in a dyer ' s garret , over against the window , who whistles loudly whilst the service is performing ; and there is the man with the wooden leg stumping away .
" No offence , sir , " said <NAME> .

' <NAME> , sir , ' he said , taking it back .
I had kept <NAME> 's flowers .
I am not afraid of him , I am not proud , I am ready to take care of him , and shall not ill-treat him as some people ( besides the asylum-folks ) have done. " After a good deal of squabbling , ' said my aunt , ' I got him ; and he has been here ever since .

If , as your cousin <NAME> says , the sword wears out the what ' s-its-name -- ' ' The scabbard , perhaps , ' said <NAME> .
It was dated an hour and a half before dinner .
' Show me one , and try , ' rejoined <NAME> .
Unfortunates with wrongs , or with projects for the general welfare ( and they had better have had wrongs at first , than have taken that bitter <NAME> recipe for certainly getting them ) , who in slow lapse of time and agony had passed safely through other public departments ; who , according to rule , had been bullied in this , over-reached by that , and evaded by the other ; got referred at last to the <NAME> Office , and never reappeared in the light of day .
<NAME> 's heart sank at sight of her ; for she had never left the bedside of her niece ; and he trembled to think what change could have driven her away .

I will not tell you what misery he underwent , what agony of soul he knew , how great his mental struggle was .
The poor room was a happy room that morning .
' Ith a fact , ' said <NAME> , ' and even knowin ' it , you couldn ' t put your finger on him .
You needn ' t hurry back , my love , if there is , for we don ' t dine just yet , and there ' s plenty of time .
I am happy to report of this deserving gentleman , that his benches are usually well filled , and that his theatre rings with merriment every night .
I will mention the matter to-morrow morning when I take my seat . "
Not that her sister noticed it ; for she was divided between regret at the coming separation , and a lingering wish that she had been included in the plans for visiting <NAME> .
' I ' ve come on very fast , considering. ' ' _You_ have come fast , considering ! ' retorted <NAME> ; ' you creep , you dog , you crawl , you measure distance like a worm .
We have oftentimes the honour to entertain your gentlemen in their travelling backwards and forwards betwixt <NAME> and <NAME> , sir .
Every petty tradesman is to begin to pity her now , is he ?
<NAME> was disposed to be out of temper , as the best of us are too often -- but he looked at the youngest child who was sleeping soundly , and from him to his other brother in the clothes-basket , and from him to their mother , who had been at work without complaint since morning , and thought it would be a better and kinder thing to be good-humoured .
" And if , <NAME> , " said the tenant , calling after him , " if you _would _have the goodness to suggest to the other ladies and gentlemen who are now engaged in haunting old empty houses , that they might be much more comfortable elsewhere , you will confer a very great benefit on society. " " I will , " replied the ghost ; " we must be dull fellows -- very dull fellows , indeed ; I can ' t imagine how we can have been so stupid. " With these words , the spirit disappeared ; and what is rather remarkable , ' added the old man , with a shrewd look round the table , ' he never came back again. ' ' That ain ' t bad , if it ' s true , ' said the man in the <NAME> studs , lighting a fresh cigar .
I do assure you , father , that our first wish and intention is to consider your comfort .
But I have not the present means of raising the sum you have demanded .
' <NAME> friend ? ' ' Never mind , ' said Mr Fledgeby , shutting up one eye , ' any of your friends , all your friends .
' Oh , of course , ' said <NAME> .
How could they have a place in the shadowy conceptions of a gentle mind ?
His dread and hatred of the place became so intense that he felt it a labour to draw his breath in it .
Then , with a rapidity of transition very foreign to his usual character , he said , in pity for his former self , " Poor boy ! "
They was , to be sure and bring a note to you , Mr Carker , before you went out in the morning .
" What a number o ' cats you keep , <NAME> , " says I , when I ' d got intimate with him .
There was a low cinder fire in a rusty , unfixed grate ; and an old three-cornered stained table , with some medicine bottles , a broken glass , and a few other domestic articles , was drawn out before it .
Mr <NAME> , sir -- ' <NAME> , glancing at <NAME> , saw that she was making signals to him , to acquaint her brother with the subject of their recent conversation .
He had found Coavinses in his way .
She tapped me several times upon the arm and nodded good-humouredly as if she were anxious I should understand that I had no cause to fear her , though she spoke so gloomily , and confided these awful secrets to me .
<NAME> <NAME> immediately called to her husband that she would get them , and went , knitting , out of the lamplight , through the courtyard .
<NAME> about somebody else. ' As <NAME> took another cautious survey of the yard , the old woman made a secret motion to her daughter .
She renewed the acquaintance of Mr and <NAME> , as if Mr and <NAME> had said of her what she had said of them , and as if <NAME> alone could quite wear her injury out .
' Now , you see , <NAME> , ' he went on , ' a literary man -- WITH a wooden leg -- is liable to jealousy .
He is in his humble way a public man , but it is not in that sphere that he finds happiness .
And I ' ll swear it ! ' ' Where did he tell you so ? ' ' Outside , ' replied <NAME> , always beating it out , with his head determinedly set askew , and his eyes watchfully dividing their attention between his two auditors , ' outside the door of the <NAME> , towards a quarter after twelve o ' clock at midnight -- but I will not in my conscience undertake to swear to so fine a matter as five minutes -- on the night when he picked up the body .
Drat it all , thot ' s what I want to know. ' So , in order that he might begin to enjoy himself at once , and lose no time , <NAME> gave his wife a hearty kiss , and succeeded in wresting another from <NAME> , after a maidenly resistance of scratching and struggling on the part of that young lady , which was not quite over when they reached the <NAME> ' s Head .
There was another : a young man , whose madness was love and music .
' The old man uttered a loud yell which rang through the lonely fields like the howl of an evil spirit .
' This is an old room , ' he remarked , with a sudden sprightliness of manner , looking round when he got near the door , ' I have been so interested that I have not observed it .
And yet he was so terrible a man !
No favourable leaning in that quarter to-day .
'If I could have done so , without doing heavy wrong to him I loved , ' rejoined <NAME> , ' I could have -- ' 'Have received this declaration very differently ? '
And why , my young friend ? "
" You wish you were going yourself ?
Everything seemed altered as he ran along the streets .
So the dream increased in rapture every hour , as Mr <NAME> felt increasingly sensible that this connection had brought him forward indeed .
She slightly showed me her arm , and it was fearfully thin indeed .
" Am I to read it now ? "
<NAME> was close upon him , and looked round the door too .
He was merely collecting himself to speak very plainly .
Mrs General ' s dreams ought to have been varnished -- if she had any -- lying asleep in the arms of the good Saint <NAME> , with the feathery snow falling on his house-top .
' If you knew what I am undergoing for you ! ' ' Of course he knows it , love , and will never forget it , ' said <NAME> .
I could not hear her disrespectfully mentioned , I added , without expressing my opinion in a decided tone .
' Who is to begin ? ' ' I ' ll begin , ' said <NAME> , ' when I ' ve smoked this here pipe out. ' He finished it with great deliberation , knocked out the ashes on the hob , and put it by .
In a few minutes she had ascended out of that clear field , in among the piled mountains of cloud .
There are ten inclined planes ; five ascending , and five descending ; the carriages are dragged up the former , and let slowly down the latter , by means of stationary engines ; the comparatively level spaces between , being traversed , sometimes by horse , and sometimes by engine power , as the case demands .
" I sat with <NAME> last night , <NAME> , two good hours. " " <NAME> was <NAME> ? " " Dear little thing ! " said <NAME> .
The waiter retired , considerably astonished , and <NAME> motioned <NAME> to a seat .
Let us make haste back. ' ' Certainly ! ' cried <NAME> , ' the quicker , the better .
He sometimes took them to the street where she had lived ; but new improvements had altered it so much , it was not like the same .
" And I said , " I timidly reminded him , " but its mistress remained . "
' He went off dead. ' ' Oh , that indeed , ' said <NAME> .
On my hurrying to speak to him and learn what had happened , he told me , after a word or two of preparation , that there had been a discovery at <NAME> Leicester <NAME> 's .
It was quite as cadaverous as it had looked in the window , though in the grain of it there was that tinge of red which is sometimes to be observed in the skins of red-haired people .
Tracing it to its source , he discovered it to be caused by a sudden extraordinary rising and stiffening of all the risen and stiff hair on <NAME> 's head .
' I do , indeed , ' replied <NAME> .
Such opportunities as I have been enabled to alienate from my domestic duties , I have devoted to corresponding at some length with my family .
It is disgraceful to the electors .
For is it likely that any human creature in his right senses would so lay himself open to be pointed at , by what I call the finger of scorn ? ' <NAME> shakes his head .
All sorts of vehicles of burden are in attendance , from a tilted waggon to a wheelbarrow .
Not only that ; but the village , light-headed with famine , fire , and bell-ringing , and bethinking itself that <NAME> had to do with the collection of rent and taxes -- though it was but a small instalment of taxes , and no rent at all , that <NAME> had got in those latter days -- became impatient for an interview with him , and , surrounding his house , summoned him to come forth for personal conference .
I have never pampered myself , and should not be ill .
So I used to come out at night after they ' d gone to bed , and feel about in the dark for bits of biscuit , or sangwitches that you ' d left in the office , or even pieces of orange peel to put into cold water and make believe it was wine .
I know weel that if I was a lyin parisht i ' th ' road , yo ' d feel it right to pass me by , as a forrenner and stranger .
<NAME> <NAME> did not desire his hearers to be upon their guard against those false prophets and wretched mockers of religion , who , without sense to expound its first doctrines , or hearts to feel its first principles , are more dangerous members of society than the common criminal ; imposing , as they necessarily do , upon the weakest and worst informed , casting scorn and contempt on what should be held most sacred , and bringing into partial disrepute large bodies of virtuous and well- conducted persons of many excellent sects and persuasions .
I could have made my profit .
Then he laughed about her , and asked me if I had ever seen such a fierce little piece of incomprehensibility .
<NAME> had often wished to speak to this man ; yet she had never taken courage to do so , as he made no movement towards her .
Now it is even awful , stealing through it , to think of the live people who have slept in the solitary bedrooms , to say nothing of the dead .
I turned over the leaves of her Diary , and found it written in a fair legible square hand , and expressed in terms which were quite intelligible without any explanation .
Speaking as a sufferer by both , I don ' t know that I wouldn ' t as soon have the <NAME> lot as your lot .
Everybody was dressed for a Fancy Ball that was never to leave off .
Sing out , " good-bye , <NAME> , " when you ' re in the passage , and shut the door .
As <NAME> ' s idea of looking at a furnished lodging was to get on the opposite side of the street to a house with a suitable bill in the window , and stare at it ; and then work his way tortuously to the back of the house , and stare at that ; and then not go in , but make similar trials of another house , with the same result ; their progress was but slow .
' You can , if you like , you know , ' said <NAME> .
Oh , you Jew ! ' The old man stood irresolute and uncertain for a moment , as if there might be further instructions for him in reserve .
It was all said in a moment , and they took me between them , wrapped in the cloak .
I am of your way of thinkin ' . ' ' <NAME> ' t make such a noise at this dead hour of the night .
' But I am not like you. ' The Father of the <NAME> said , with a shrug of modest self-depreciation , ' Oh !
Oliver did as the old lady bade him ; and , although she lamented grievously , meanwhile , that there was not even time to crimp the little frill that bordered his shirt-collar ; he looked so delicate and handsome , despite that important personal advantage , that she went so far as to say : looking at him with great complacency from head to foot , that she really did n't think it would have been possible , on the longest notice , to have made much difference in him for the better .
It would have been difficult by a far brighter light , to recognise in <NAME> , intellectual of face and upright of bearing , the shoemaker of the garret in <NAME> .
She ' s a very taking and agreeable woman ? ' <NAME> smote the gentle Twemlow pale .
I shall come home when I please , and go when I please .
I counted up to high numbers , to make sure of myself , and repeated passages that I knew in prose and verse .
And my guardian put a letter in my hand , without any ordinary beginning such as " My dear Jarndyce , " but rushing at once into the words , " I swear if <NAME> do not come down and take possession of my house , which I vacate for her this day at one o'clock , P.M. , " and then with the utmost seriousness , and in the most emphatic terms , going on to make the extraordinary declaration he had quoted .
<NAME> ! ' They are in the act of ratifying the treaty of friendly move , by shaking hands upon it .
Is it true ? " " Too true. " " Can I only serve you , <NAME> , by serving your friend ?
' You can bear me out in that , <NAME> ? ' ' Eh ? ' cried <NAME> , looking from face to face with an expression of stupid amazement .
' I won ' t be silent , ' returned the nurse .
" He keeps his grog ready mixed in a little tub on the table .
Walking along the <NAME> , afterwards , and observing a hard mottled substance in the window of a ham and beef shop , which resembled marble , but was labelled ' <NAME> ' , I went in and bought a slab of it , which I have since seen reason to believe would have sufficed for fifteen people .
Your healths , gentlemen. ' With this expression of his feelings , <NAME> laid three small written cards before <NAME> ' s friends , and , looking at the clock again , feared it was time to be walking .
'The cutting away when there 's anything wrong , and the eating all the wittles when there 's everything right ; is that his branch ? '
' I should have thought the deadness was a mild word for it , if it had been named to me when we brought you in .
" Did you know this morning , now , that you were coming out on this errand ? "
" An old acquaintance of yours , this road , <NAME> , " said <NAME> cheerfully .
A yellow-faced old gentleman from <NAME> , is going to take unto himself a young wife this morning , and six carriages full of company are expected , and <NAME> has been informed that the yellow-faced old gentleman could pave the road to church with diamonds and hardly miss them .
But she sat perfectly still in his grasp , and only said , in a low voice , " I entreat you , good gentlemen , do not come near us , do not speak , do not move ! " " <NAME> ! " he exclaimed .
On this point , as well as on all other possible points , <NAME> was convinced that my aunt was the wisest and most wonderful of women ; as he repeatedly told me with infinite secrecy , and always in a whisper .
A fish of the sea or river ?
So , as she slightly laughed and afterwards sat looking at the rain , she was as self-possessed and as free to occupy herself with her own thoughts as if she had been alone .
' There ' s a pair on ' em , sir. ' ' <NAME> suspected my design , and set that fellow on you , with this story , I suppose ? ' said <NAME> , half choking .
So the time went on ; until it happened that <NAME> was called away from home by business which required his presence elsewhere , for three or four days .
" <NAME> , it _was_ I .
Do you never hear any haunted noises here ? ' ' <NAME> , ' returned Mr Flintwinch .
" Secondly , what will satisfy you for the trouble of producing it ? "
' Yes , ' said my mother , faintly .
As long as eating was a novelty and an amusement , <NAME> kept up pretty well .
Over and above that , <NAME> , by some means ( it was not very difficult to guess , through the sharp arguments of her liege lord ) , had acquired such a lively conviction of the hazard of saying anything under any circumstances , that she had remained all this time in a corner guarding herself from approach with that symbolical instrument of hers ; so that , when a word or two had been addressed to her by <NAME> , or even by the bottle-green patriarch himself , she had warded off conversation with the toasting-fork like a dumb woman .
' <NAME> , ' said the old gentleman , ' you singled out that particular bird ? ' ' No , ' said <NAME> -- ' no. ' ' You did , ' said <NAME> .
That , and a sense that we were both a little afraid of <NAME> , and submitted ourselves in most things to her direction , were among the first opinions -- if they may be so called -- that I ever derived from what I saw .
I am sensible that so amiable a lady as the lovely and accomplished daughter of my friend <NAME> will not require much urging ; but I am happy to know , that I am supported by my friend <NAME> ' s influence and approval .
At first , he began to doubt the reality of his adventures , but the acute pain in his shoulders when he attempted to rise , assured him that the kicking of the goblins was certainly not ideal .
Can you suppose there ' s any harm in looking as cheerful and being as cheerful as our poor circumstances will permit ?
Then , very strangely , I seemed to hear them , not in the reader 's voice , but in the well-remembered voice of my godmother .
And I went on at a mighty rate , as if it could be done by walking .
When is he coming , <NAME> ? ' ' What a question ! ' cried <NAME> .
' Did she tell you why ? ' I inquired .
A ' most the moment as she lighted heer , all so desolate , she found ( as she believed ) a friend ; a decent woman as spoke to her about the needle-work as she had been brought up to do , about finding plenty of it fur her , about a lodging fur the night , and making secret inquiration concerning of me and all at home , tomorrow .
You needn ' t tell me that , <NAME> .
' <NAME> ! ' said I , going to it .
On every rail and gate , wet lay clammy , and the marsh mist was so thick , that the wooden finger on the post directing people to our village -- a direction which they never accepted , for they never came there -- was invisible to me until I was quite close under it .
Such brains are fertile in expedients .
' And what , my old lady , ' inquired Mr Boffin , when he also had sympathetically laughed : ' what ' s your views on the subject of the Bower ? ' ' Shut it up .
Upon no one , however , did it make a greater impression than on <NAME> himself ; who , after labouring , for some hours , under the fear of having mortally wounded a fellow-creature , eagerly caught at this new idea , and favoured it to the utmost .
At six in the morning , I was in <NAME> <NAME> , buying a bouquet for <NAME> .
And besides , ' added <NAME> , laughing as she pointed a rallying finger at his face , ' because I have got you in my power .
Nothing in the world , and no one in the world , could shake it or could move me . "
at last and at least , <NAME> must be told , ' thought <NAME> , with a sigh .
They agreed that the weather was of high promise ; and <NAME> kept the talk in that safe direction until it had become easy again , when he gently diverted it to <NAME> and his quick sense and agreeable qualities when he was delicately dealt with ; he likewise dwelt on the indisputable affection he entertained for his wife .
Do n't you be afraid of my turning out of my way , right or left , or taking a sleep , or a wash , or a shave till I have found what I go in search of .
He came in and first tossed me some pieces of money ; then struck at me with a whip .
Whether they were or not , did not appear ; but they all had a weedy look .
' You know , <NAME> dear , ' she said , cheerily reverting to their former conversation , ' that I hope I may safely be trusted in great things .
I would have told him all my mother 's letter , but he would not hear it then .
<NAME> <NAME> , who has been looking first at one of them and then at the other , as if he were demented , takes his venerable acquaintance by the throat on receiving this request , and dragging him upright in his chair as easily as if he were a doll , appears in two minds whether or no to shake all future power of cushioning out of him and shake him into his grave .
Her worthy husband , setting aside his bread and butter , immediately discharges the cushion at her , crushes her against the side of her chair , and falls back in his own , overpowered .
I know what men they are from whom these schemes have come .
Such a poor weak little creature ! " As the last thing on earth that his heart was to warm and soften to , it warmed and softened to this pitiable girl .
She had got a baby -- oh , there were a pair of babies when she gave birth to this child sitting here , that Friday night ! -- and what more did she want ? ' <NAME> secretly shook his head at me , as if he thought there was no getting over this .
'It 's no good being proper in this world , ' said the first housemaid .
'You shall read them , if you behave well , ' said the old gentleman kindly ; 'and you will like that , better than looking at the outsides , -- that is , some cases ; because there are books of which the backs and covers are by far the best parts . '
And how well that delightful old soul Mrs. Rouncewell is looking .
' For years , ma ' am , I was one of the most miserable little wretches ever seen .
You ' re a ready money man .
'There is nothing unusual in that , ' said the gentleman .
He turned into the <NAME> , and , having revived himself by twice pacing the pavements of <NAME> 's Bench-walk and Paper-buildings , turned into the Stryver chambers .
You don ' t think they ' ve gone to sea , anyhow ? ' ' Not gone for sailors , certainly , ' returned the mother with a smile .
'What do you think would suit me now ?
What was it that made me burn all over with a wish to chastise him severely for cutting away from his best friends , his pastors and masters ? ' ' It was parental instinct , sir , ' observed <NAME> .
They were looking at the table ( which was spread out in great array ) ; for these young housekeepers are always nervous on such points , and like to see that everything is right .
In one corner stood the diminutive pair of top-boots in which <NAME> was accustomed to enact the little jockey , and , folded on a chair hard by , was a small parcel , which bore a very suspicious resemblance to the companion smalls .
<NAME> as I felt my own unconscious part in his pollution of an honest home , I believed that if I had been brought face to face with him , I could not have uttered one reproach .
The last two or three stragglers were hurrying to the lodge , and he was following , when he caught sight of her in the doorway of the first house from the entrance .
' Dear me ! ' cried that unfortunate gentleman again , ' I am worrited to that degree that I ' m almost off my head .
" Because you 'll come to that if you do n't look out .
Please to get me a glass of water ! ' I was too attentive to the Doctor and his wife , to give any heed to this request ; and it made no impression on anybody else ; so Mrs. <NAME> panted , stared , and fanned herself .
' Oh Di , you bad , forgetful dog !
His getting on his box , which I remember to have been decorated with an old weather-stained pea-green hammercloth moth-eaten into rags , was quite a work of time .
I shall buy up some good Life Assurance shares , and cut into the Direction .
A merry Christmas to you , sir ! "
' I trust I shall have the pleasure of seeing you and your friend at my rooms , and of spending a pleasant evening with you , after this awkward mistake , ' said the little doctor ; ' are you disengaged this evening ? ' ' We have some friends here , ' replied <NAME> , ' and I should not like to leave them to-night .
Now , <NAME> , examining this iron with a smith 's eye , declared it to have been filed asunder some time ago .
If you can ever give me help , rely upon it I will ask you for it .
What do we find , Mr Lightwood ?
' There was a very snug little party , consisting of <NAME> and her cousin <NAME> , and three or four romping , good-humoured , rosy-cheeked girls .
' I ' m sorry I should drive you there , ' said Mrs. Gummidge .
' My dear <NAME> , ' returned his sister , ' you do <NAME> but justice , as a man of your penetration was sure , I knew , to do .
' Hear me , I say , ' said <NAME> , ' and not him. ' ' Say what thou ' st gotten to say then , sir , ' retorted <NAME> ; ' and tak ' care thou dinnot put up angry bluid which thou ' dst betther try to quiet. ' ' I should know <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' by your tongue ; and <NAME> ' ( pointing to <NAME> ) ' by his looks. ' ' Don ' t speak to him , ' said <NAME> , recovering his voice .
It was the queerest of rooms , fitted and furnished more like a luxurious amateur tap-room than anything else within the ken of <NAME> .
At no Mother ' s knee but hers had he ever dwelt in his youth on hopeful promises , on playful fancies , on the harvests of tenderness and humility that lie hidden in the early-fostered seeds of the imagination ; on the oaks of retreat from blighting winds , that have the germs of their strong roots in nursery acorns .
<NAME> , for _you_ , is a plum with the natural bloom on ; it hasn ' t been over-carefully wiped off for _you_— ' ' Don ' t stop , dear fellow .
Impossible ! " " Well ! " said <NAME> , getting up with a lively shake as if he had been asleep , and stirring the fire , " now I 'll endeavor to make myself agreeable again ! " So he went round the room and shook the curtains out , put the chairs in their places , tidied the books and so forth that were lying about , looked into the hall , peeped into the letter-box , shut the door , and came back to his chair by the fire : where he sat down , nursing his left leg in both arms .
' The two youngest are only nine and ten .
inquired <NAME> , fixing his eyes on the Jew .
' Catch the crystal globules -- catch ' em -- bottle ' em up -- cork ' em tight -- put sealing wax on the top -- seal ' em with a cupid -- label ' em " Best quality " -- and stow ' em away in the fourteen binn , with a bar of iron on the top to keep the thunder off ! ' Issuing these commands , as if there were a dozen attendants all actively engaged in their execution , he turned his velvet cap inside out , put it on with great dignity so as to obscure his right eye and three-fourths of his nose , and sticking his arms a-kimbo , looked very fiercely at a sparrow hard by , till the bird flew away , when he put his cap in his pocket with an air of great satisfaction , and addressed himself with respectful demeanour to Mrs. Nickleby .
The silence was at length broken by <NAME> .
' You know who bricks and mortar is , I suppose , sir ? ' ' I do not , indeed , ' replied <NAME> .
Who would have thought it !
I have just been hearing of you .
The <NAME> 's Head It was a heavy mass of building , that chateau of Monsieur the <NAME> , with a large stone courtyard before it , and two stone sweeps of staircase meeting in a stone terrace before the principal door .
" Well ? " said my sister , in her snappish way .
The young lady with the back did not appear for some time after <NAME> ' s death ; observing to some particular friends , with her usual engaging little scream , that she couldn ' t separate the family from a notion of tombstones , and horrors of that sort ; but when she did come , she saw nothing wrong , except Mr <NAME> ' s wearing a bunch of gold seals to his watch , which shocked her very much , as an exploded superstition .
I WILL have it ! ' But <NAME> throws him off , and pauses for an instant , in a raging passion , with the goblet yet in his uplifted hand .
Upon my honour , I will keep your secret .
Either their beauty or the beauty of her arms is particularly attractive to <NAME> .
Nor do they see it any more that day .
'No , ' said the old gentleman , shaking his head ; 'it must be imagination . '
But no one knows the resources of that man ' s intellect , except myself ! ' She stopped for a moment to take my hand between hers , and went on : ' It ' s in vain , <NAME> , to recall the past , unless it works some influence upon the present .
The <NAME> dropped beneath it , so that the extinguisher covered its whole form ; but though <NAME> pressed it down with all his force , he could not hide the light : which streamed from under it , in an unbroken flood upon the ground .
<NAME> confidence , so long preserved between us once , is restored , to know no further interruption .
<NAME> little thing , she 's liable to spasms , and it 's good for her to have her mind employed .
said the man , pushing her towards the door .
If you ' ll be so good as give me your keys , my dear , I ' ll attend to all this sort of thing in future. ' From that time , <NAME> kept the keys in her own little jail all day , and under her pillow all night , and my mother had no more to do with them than I had .
It was plain that some extraordinary grudge was working in <NAME> <NAME> ' s gentle breast , and that it was that which impelled her , without the smallest present cause , to rap the child with the blade of the knife , now on her hand , now on her head , and now on her back , as if she found it quite impossible to stand so close to her without administering a few slight knocks .
<NAME> ! " And he took another gentle little pinch of snuff , and lightly crossed his legs .
But neither oaths , or prayers , nor words , <NAME> kill me , and therefore I live , and mean to live. ' ' And his mother died ! ' cried the old man , passionately clasping his hands and looking upward ; ' and this is <NAME> ' s justice ! ' The other stood lounging with his foot upon a chair , and regarded him with a contemptuous sneer .
' You will not be rid of me so easily , I promise you .
What wonder that days became as years in knitting them together !
Where they don ' t want things done and find a man to do ' em , that man ' s off his legs ; but where they do want things done and find a man to do ' em , that man ' s on his legs .
He knows his lesson , or he does not know it. ' ' He does NOT know it , ' <NAME> interposes awfully .
' I have heard that you were kind enough on one of those occasions , ' said <NAME> , catching at the opportunity as it drifted past him , ' to mention <NAME> to my mother. ' ' Little -- ?
I fancied , indeed , that he sometimes chuckled audibly over this reflection , but the carrier said he was only troubled with a cough .
God bless you ! " and for a moment rests his heart against her bosom , and looks up at both of us , as if it was in pain -- in agony .
One of the most remarkable sufferers by the same axe -- a woman -- had asked at the foot of the same scaffold , not long before , to be allowed to write down the thoughts that were inspiring her .
' Hoity-toity ! ' exclaimed <NAME> , shaking out her black bombazeen skirts , and plucking up all the ogress within her .
They says to one another , " Here comes the man as ain ' t good enough for his own son ! " Lizzie -- ! ' But , she stopped him with a cry .
' What did you think of her , now ?
" And when she went from here , " I was proceeding , when <NAME> 's husband impatiently took me up .
The horse was a bay , a well-looking animal enough ; but with something of a flash and dog-fighting air about him , nevertheless , which accorded both with the vehicle and his master .
I declare if I was Pa , I 'd run away . "
' I was sorry , <NAME> , I remarked , ' said <NAME> , turning his head and his eyes stiffly towards me , ' to observe that you are of a sullen disposition .
<NAME> ! " The valet had put her away from the door , the carriage had broken into a brisk trot , the postilions had quickened the pace , she was left far behind , and <NAME> , again escorted by the Furies , was rapidly diminishing the league or two of distance that remained between him and his chateau .
<NAME> was plainly disconcerted , and alarmed besides .
' I see , ' said <NAME> , ' a sort of brother-in-law o ' the have-his-carcass .
' By your informant , if you have one .
I do not feel that I have the right to tell you what I know of her , for I acquired the knowledge confidentially , and under circumstances that bind me to silence .
" Love him like a brother !
' There ' s rummer things than women in this world though , mind you , ' said the man with the black eye , slowly filling a large <NAME> pipe , with a most capacious bowl .
Three or four days of steady application tendered him master of all the facts it was essential to become acquainted with .

It would have been easy to perceive that they had not slept all last night , even if <NAME> had failed to tell me of their still sitting just as I left them , when it was broad day .
I hear the bells. ' The wind brought the sounds of the church clock to the window .
' I didn ' t expect a visit from you , <NAME> , ' said his sister .
The landlord of the inn is usually among them , and seems , of all the party , to be the least connected with the business of the house .
I promised myself that I would do something for them one of these days , and formed a plan in outline for bestowing a dinner of roast-beef and plum-pudding , a pint of ale , and a gallon of condescension , upon everybody in the village .
' It was all there was , ' returned my aunt .
You know what Ma is -- and I need n't make poor Pa more miserable by " But would it not be adding to his unhappiness to marry without his knowledge or consent , my dear ? "

He is making believe that he thinks of her good and not his own .
There was not the slightest reason to suppose that the man wished to return to prison : indeed everything , but the commission of the offence , made directly against that assumption .
Mrs. Rouncewell , so many years housekeeper at <NAME> , sits within the chaise ; and by her side sits Mrs. Bagnet with her grey cloak and umbrella .
Her other hand pressed hard upon the table , and again the curious stir was observable in her , as if she were going to rise .
They all got to work without loss of time , and very busy they were .
At length , the clock was hidden from his sight by some envious shutters , then the church steeples proclaimed eleven at night , then the quarter past , and then the conviction seemed to obtrude itself on his mind that it was no use tarrying there any longer .
The Jew nodded his head towards <NAME> , who was still gazing at the fire ; and intimated , by a sign , that he would have her told to leave the room .
Kiss it ! " " Do so , as he wishes it , " I said to <NAME> .
On the contrary , they rouse my indignation when I see them in action. ' ' Alfred ! ' ' They rouse my indignation , my dear , against the unworthy persons , and give me a combative desire to stand between Mr Boffin and all such persons .

<NAME> this iron on my sore leg !
Finally , he walked across the room with a measured tread to where the window was .
But being in company with the brother of a doosed fine gal -- well educated too -- with no biggodd nonsense about her -- at the period alluded to -- ' ' There !
' I know something of that hand , too .
There was no need of any caution this time , and no fear of being detained by having to play out a return match with <NAME> ' s boy .
I should certainly not have gone , but for the reference to my Uncle Provis .
Not that I reproach myself .
That it was strongly felt , and that there was a lively hope that it would prosper , there can be no doubt .
We are here , my love. ' The beautiful lady released her hold of <NAME> , and pressing her lips once more upon her face , withdrew hurriedly , and joined them .
That , for these reasons , the jury , being a loyal jury ( as he knew they were ) , and being a responsible jury ( as _they_ knew they were ) , must positively find the prisoner <NAME> , and make an end of him , whether they liked it or not .

I will not Pursue my Question. ' But the lumpy gentleman , unwilling to give it up , again madly said , ' ESKER , ' and again spake no more .
Mr <NAME> made in reply , a comic speech chequered with sentiment .

' At twenty minutes before seven , then , ' said <NAME> , rising , ' the coach will be here .
It is noticed , by the bye , that these damsels become , within the limits of decorum , more skittish when thus intrusted with the concrete representation of their sex , than when dividing the representation with <NAME> ' s young ladies .
What would he do with coals ?
He and his deaf assistant were sitting before the fire .
<NAME> <NAME> ' s case had not gone off in so particularly happy a manner , up to this point , that it could very well afford to have any additional suspicion cast upon it .
What a rattle I am !
It is in reference to your letter to Mr and <NAME> , and this is what it is .
By the noisome ways through which they descended into that pit , they gradually emerge from it , the crowd flitting , and whistling , and skulking about them until they come to the verge , where restoration of the bull's-eyes is made to <NAME> .
He perceives with astonishment that supposing the present government to be overthrown , the limited choice of the <NAME> , in the formation of a new ministry , would lie between <NAME> and <NAME> -- supposing it to be impossible for the <NAME> of <NAME> to act with <NAME> , which may be assumed to be the case in consequence of the breach arising out of that affair with <NAME> .
He found <NAME> in due course ; <NAME> , who had stepped out for a minute or so to the public-house , was opening the door with a latch-key , as he reached the steps .
" I have sent him to the other end of the room , " observed <NAME> , drawing her chair nearer ours , " because I do n't want him to hear the conversation .
" <NAME> would persist in sniffing while he was a-eating his dinner , and said that the beef was so strong it made him. " -- Very good , <NAME> , we ' ll see if we can ' t make you sniff a little without beef .
And I did hope it might just hint a caution .
' I am sorry you have , ' rejoined <NAME> , turning his back upon him .
At the inn we found <NAME> on horseback , waiting with an open carriage to take us to his house , which was a few miles off .
' Oh , you ' ve come back , have you ! ' said Mrs. Weller .
" Before <NAME> , and at <NAME> , and ever since <NAME> , " pursued <NAME> , " you have fallen into your rank , and I have fallen into mine .
I hear <NAME> moving too .
Spiders had built their webs in the angles of the walls and ceilings ; and sometimes , when <NAME> walked softly into a room , the mice would scamper across the floor , and run back terrified to their holes .

We ' re going to have a wedding -- a real wedding this time. ' ' A wedding ! ' exclaimed <NAME> , turning very pale .
<NAME> , like an <NAME> chief , on one of these pieces of matting , the dwarf was regaling himself in the parlour , with bread and cheese and beer , when he observed without appearing to do so , that a boy was prying in at the outer door .
Hear me ! ' ' Unless you are a more obstinate and more persisting woman than even I know you to be , ' Mr <NAME> interposed , ' you had better leave Mr Rigaud , Mr Blandois , Mr Beelzebub , to tell it in his own way .
' There -- that ' s enough. ' ' Enough ! ' cried <NAME> , advancing towards him .
When they can be got to believe that the kettle is made of the precious metals , in that fact lies the whole power of men like our late lamented .
' <NAME> , ' said he , ' you and <NAME> sup at your lodgings to-night , I know .

' Thank you , ' said <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> yields up his family legs to the family disorder as if he held his name and fortune on that feudal tenure .
I am disposed to think he had made no will. ' ' Oh , I know he had ! ' said I .
'Of course it could n't , ' replied <NAME> ; ' I know 'd that , directly I see him coming through <NAME> , with the books under his arm .
Here <NAME> looked at his boots and I looked at mine , and then <NAME> looked at my boots , and I looked at his .
She then requested <NAME> to follow her , and after several feints on the part of <NAME> to attract the young lady ' s attention , they went away : leaving that gentleman extended at full length on the sofa , with his heels in the air and a newspaper in his hand .
When I remembered where I was at that untimely hour , a feeling stole upon me that made me get up , afraid of I don ' t know what , and walk about .
The figure of a man advanced in life , whose smooth grey eyebrows seemed to move to the ticking as the fire-light flickered on them , sat in an arm-chair , with his list shoes on the rug , and his thumbs slowly revolving over one another .
<NAME> looked upon the sleepers ; at first , with the air of one who gazes upon a scene which , though familiar to him , has lost none of its sorrowful effect in consequence ; and , afterwards , with a more intense and searching scrutiny , as a man would who missed something his eye was accustomed to meet , and had expected to rest upon .
When they move once more , <NAME> is seen to look up at the sky , and to point before him .
You be off , ma ' am , this minute , and fetch a little more brandy , or we shall have you in hysterics. ' By this time , the rings had begun to fall from the debtor ' s irresolute hands , like leaves from a wintry tree .
' You didn ' t know me , but I knew two friends of yours that were stopping at the <NAME> at <NAME> , at the time of the election. ' ' Oh , indeed ! ' exclaimed <NAME> .
At last , having been ( always attended by the cat ) all over the house and having seen the whole stock of miscellaneous lumber , which was certainly curious , we came into the back part of the shop .
Not being able , in the absence of any change of clothes , to go to church that day , we were compelled to decline these kindnesses , one and all ; and I was reluctantly obliged to forego the delight of hearing Dr. Channing , who happened to preach that morning for the first time in a very long interval .
But this presses first. ' He debated principally whether he should write to young Drood , or whether he should speak to <NAME> .
Mr <NAME> ' s mansion , if it be a gap among the other houses any longer , is only so because it is not to be vied with in its brightness , and haughtily casts them off .

<NAME> Bumble no sooner uttered <NAME> 's name , in explanation of his errand , than Mrs. Bedwin , who had been listening at the parlour door , hastened into the passage in a breathless state .
Which I meantersay , if the ghost of a man 's own father can not be allowed to claim his attention , what can , <NAME> ?
<NAME> Mrs Pipchin dozing in an easy chair , often changed to <NAME> , or his aunt ; and <NAME> was quite content to shut his eyes again , and see what happened next , without emotion .
If he takes and sends me out I must go .
We have stated them awkwardly , I dare say. ' ' That I dare say you have , ' retorted her mother , briskly .
Not a wured to <NAME> ' r <NAME> ? ' There was a trembling upon her , that I can see now .

His steps echoed through the low building with a hollow sound , and he almost feared to be alone , it was so still and quiet .
Will you repeat it , my dear ? ' Mrs <NAME> complied , by reciting the verses in which this obliging offer had been made , exactly as she had received them .
Nor , that , when we met one night , and spoke together in the room yonder , over the way , she listened at the door. ' ' Mas ' r <NAME> ! ' he replied in astonishment .
While assisting at the literary evenings , he even went so far , on two or three occasions , as to correct Mr Wegg when he grossly mispronounced a word , or made nonsense of a passage ; insomuch that Mr <NAME> took to surveying his course in the day , and to making arrangements for getting round rocks at night instead of running straight upon them .
They were good qualities , without which no high place can be meritoriously won , but like fire and water , though excellent servants , they were very bad masters .
' It ' s a large sum to <NAME> , ' he said , in a dolorous voice .
' I was never up the river , ' added <NAME> .
As <NAME> looked back over her shoulder before going out at the door , <NAME> kissed that hand to her , with a ravenous intensity that was of its kind quite dreadful .
But to give it you short and handy , I 'll put it at once into a mouthful of <NAME> .
The same kind friend had , with <NAME> 's assistance , cautiously stopped all channels of communication through which they could receive intelligence of the dreadful occurrences that so recently taken place .
The <NAME> and instrument soon drove off together to a stable-yard in <NAME> , where a remarkably fine grey gelding , worth , at the lowest figure , seventy-five guineas ( not taking into account the value of the shot he had been made to swallow for the improvement of his form ) , was to be parted with for a twenty-pound note , in consequence of his having run away last week with <NAME> of <NAME> , who wasn ' t up to a horse of his courage , and who , in mere spite , insisted on selling him for that ridiculous sum : or , in other words , on giving him away .
The dog growled again ; and licking his lips , eyed <NAME> as if he were anxious to attach himself to his windpipe without delay .
In short , my aunt , seeing how enraptured I was with the premises , took them for a month , with leave to remain for twelve months when that time was out .
He knew now that she was beautiful ; he did not dispute that she was graceful and winning , and that in the bright dawn of her womanhood she had come upon him , a surprise .
' <NAME> home with me then , ' said <NAME> , ' and my boys shall go with you after dinner , and show you the most likely place. ' The offer was not to be refused ; <NAME> and <NAME> gave <NAME> an arm each , and walked up the street in stately array .
<NAME> ' s picture , too , would be in at least half-a-dozen of the annuals , and on the opposite page would appear , in delicate type , ' <NAME> on contemplating the <NAME> of <NAME> .
' Now , I ' ll be plain with you , Veneering , ' says <NAME> , knitting his brows .
I could not say so , of course , or show that I knew anything about it .
I do n't come in to stare about me .
Through all the rooms he wandered , as he always did , like the last person on earth who had any business to approach them .
' Overpowering , really ! ' ' Do you think I don ' t know , ' said my aunt , turning a deaf ear to the sister , and continuing to address the brother , and to shake her head at him with infinite expression , ' what kind of life you must have led that poor , unhappy , misdirected baby ?
' Now , don ' t be in a flutter , ma ' am ; you ' ll be taken great care of .
Some of us will be dying in a workhouse next. ' ' As the persons you have cited , ' quietly remarked the Secretary , ' thought they would , if I remember , sir. ' ' And very creditable in ' em too , ' said Mr Boffin .
<NAME> , in the mist through which she saw her father , and the prison , and the turbid living river that flowed through it and flowed on .
For , it was he addressed him with a severe countenance , and who had come in quietly by the folding-doors .
Thus , they had toiled along the dusty road , taking little heed of any object within sight , save when they stepped aside to allow a wider passage for the mail-coaches which were whirling out of town , until they passed through <NAME> archway ; when the foremost traveller stopped and called impatiently to his companion , 'Come on , ca n't yer ?
' I thought you might have know ' d him without it , ' said Mr Boffin slightly disappointed .
Well might <NAME> ' s mother say to <NAME> ' s mother that the gallery was the place to see from , and wonder it wasn ' t much dearer than the boxes ; well might Barbara feel doubtful whether to laugh or cry , in her flutter of delight .
' <NAME> has faults -- many faults -- but I wish her well , and above all I wish her married ; for I think it highly desirable -- most desirable from the very nature of her failings -- that she should be married as soon as possible .
I told her so , and told her that I would spend any money or take any pains to drive him out of that country .
' Come ! ' retorted <NAME> , stopping to wheel round upon him , ' let ' s have none of _your_ interruptions .
' Never I mind ! ' said <NAME> , ' no , nor never nobody mind , say ' st thou , schoolmeasther .
I come to the second .
I will only say , at parting , that you do him a great wrong. ' ' I do him no wrong , ' she returned .
<NAME> , of your own noble will , to a ruined man !
He stood , half turned from the prisoner , lounging with his elbow against the bar .
Wot are you bustin ' vith , now ? ' ' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , wiping his forehead , ' I ' m afeerd that vun o ' these days I shall laugh myself into a appleplexy , my boy. ' ' Vell , then , wot do you do it for ? ' said <NAME> .
' I find it so , ' replied the man .
' Now , ' said <NAME> , ' what is it ? ' ' Governors Both , ' returned the man , in what he meant to be a wheedling tone , ' which on you might be <NAME> ? ' ' Lawyer Lightwood , ' ducking at him with a servile air , ' I am a man as gets my living , and as seeks to get my living , by the sweat of my brow .
' You do right , child , ' said <NAME> , ' to speak well of those who deserve well of you. ' ' Right or wrong , ' muttered <NAME> , inaudibly , with a visible hitch of her chin , ' I mean to do it , and you may make up your mind to THAT , old lady. ' ' Here is the paper , madam , ' said the Jew , delivering into <NAME> ' s hands the original document drawn up by <NAME> , and signed by <NAME> .
Several doors were opened in succession , and finally his own .
' _You_ know you must keep up your spirits , mother , and not be lonesome because I ' m not at home .
There is no mystery in it ; there is an unfathomable mystery in the meanest of them , for ever.—Supposing we were to reverse our arithmetic for material objects , and to govern these awful unknown quantities by other means !
Two ; four ; and two is six , ' measuring on the pavement .
He ' d take fire and blow up while he was about it. ' ' And so you would be rid of him , ' said <NAME> , humouring her .

My good mother lived in the country . "
' Is it possible that I had the honour , sir , of officiating when -- ? ' ' Yes , ' said I .
" What have I done ! " I knew not how to answer , or how to comfort her .
He reached the yard ; and his passion vanished in a moment .
' <NAME> ' t let him go alone ! ' screamed the females .
I was waiting for you , <NAME> , till it came down as <NAME> never saw it come down before .
Being left to himself , the savage had a dance , all alone .
ha ! ' His good-humour being in some degree restored by the vision of <NAME> swallowing , perforce , a five-shilling piece , <NAME> slowly brought forth from his desk one of those portable bottles , currently known as pocket-pistols , and shaking the same close to his ear so as to produce a rippling sound very cool and pleasant to listen to , suffered his features to relax , and took a gurgling drink , which relaxed them still more .
' You decline to answer , do you ?
" I 've got a high pair as belonged to mother . "
' Your father can be free within this week .
The poor dear girls should have their disappointment broken to them gently , and , as the first preliminary , <NAME> should be confided in by <NAME> , even in advance of the reappearance of <NAME> .
I am only unfortunate to have come in the way .
<NAME> at them , " glancing at the sleepers on the ground .
' Yes ; uncle <NAME> , I would , ' returned <NAME> , with the energy of both her parents combined ; ' but not aunt <NAME> .
And so , as <NAME> observed , <NAME> bless <NAME> , Every One !
' <NAME> ' r ! ' cried the <NAME> , looking down upon him in amazement .
Both were flushed , flustered , and rumpled , by the late scuffle ; and <NAME> , in coming to the ground , had received a humming knock on the back of his devoted head , which caused him still to rub it with an air of having been highly -- but disagreeably -- astonished .
' My love , how you tremble ! ' ' Because I KNOW you ' re going to scold me , ' exclaimed <NAME> , in a piteous voice .
Filled with this idea , he advanced at once , but stealthily .
<NAME> mistrusts and suspects me -- goes to lawyers , and is taught to mistrust and suspect me .
I have not lived in a walking country , you know. ' ' True , ' says <NAME> .
' Take care he don ' t hear you , sir , or you may be sorry for it. ' ' Oh , pray , <NAME> -- ' said <NAME> .
If he had been murdered , and so artfully disfigured , or concealed , or both , as that the murderer hoped identification to be impossible , except from something that he wore , assuredly the murderer would seek to remove from the body the most lasting , the best known , and the most easily recognisable , things upon it .
The snow lay on the ground , frozen into a hard thick crust , so that only the heaps that had drifted into byways and corners were affected by the sharp wind that howled abroad : which , as if expending increased fury on such prey as it found , caught it savagely up in clouds , and , whirling it into a thousand misty eddies , scattered it in air .
Without waiting for a reply , he inquired of the boys whether any one among them knew anything of their missing schoolmate .
And then the dream grew dim , and faded .
' Yes sure ! ' said she , when the business was opened , ' Mrs <NAME> had the kindness to write to me , ma ' am , and I got <NAME> to read it .
The sun was down , the light had gradually stolen from the roof , and the shadow had crept upward .
Give me , " said <NAME> , " a good book , or a good newspaper , and sit me down afore a good fire , and I ask no better .
Also , notwithstanding their martial appearance , broad square shoulders , and heavy tread , whether there are within the same limits two more simple and unaccustomed children in all the <NAME> affairs of life .
But I -- I am afraid there ' s something the matter with them .
I had become , in the <NAME> and <NAME> time , however short or long it may have been , so unused to the sports and games of boys , that I knew I was awkward and inexperienced in the commonest things belonging to them .
" I heard you were released , <NAME> .
Truly , Mr Sownds the <NAME> has good reason to feel himself in office , as he suns his portly figure on the church steps , waiting for the marriage hour .
I rather thought he might have been here today , sir .
As it so happened that I never saw <NAME> again , I may at once finish what I know of his history .
<NAME> don ' t you give in , and tell the Chancellorship that you ' re wery sorry for makin ' his court contemptible , and you won ' t do so no more ? ' The cobbler put his pipe in the corner of his mouth , while he smiled , and then brought it back to its old place again ; but said nothing .
' And what then , pray ? ' ' Why , then you may go as soon as you like , ' says <NAME> .
The moment he ceased , she looked at him again .
Nickleby , there is terrible news for you , and I am sent to beg you will come with me directly , ' said a voice he seemed to recognise .
He shook my hand and said no more .
' Oh-h ! ' ' I should be glad to countermine him , respecting the handsome gal , your friend .
The swarm and buzz , and going up and down , endure for days .
Will you come and see me today , at any time you like to appoint ?
I love him so much , and so dearly , that when I sometimes think my life may be but a weary one , I am proud of it and glad of it .
Not so much in point of amount as owing to the peculiar and pressing nature of liabilities <NAME> has incurred and the means he has of liquidating or meeting the same .
' That was my speculation , <NAME> .
" My physician , <NAME> , my dear , who was so exceedingly attentive to me .
So forget and forgive all round , <NAME> .
' Well , ' said <NAME> , ' I never did ! ' ' O ' course not , ' said <NAME> , ' and nobody never did , nor never vill neither ; and here am I a-walkin ' about like the wandering Jew -- a sportin ' character you have perhaps heerd on Mary , my dear , as vos alvays doin ' a match agin ' time , and never vent to sleep -- looking arter this here <NAME> Allen. ' ' Miss who ? ' said <NAME> , in great astonishment .
<NAME> <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> of the no surname , all shake hands with one another round , and with the doctor too .
They drew back from the window , and the <NAME> looked for explanation in his friend 's ashy face .
" 'Do you honour me with your attention , <NAME> ? '
Let me raise your head .
Why , here ' s a dismal face for ladies ' company ! -- my pretty sister too , whom you have so often asked me about .
So , Mr and <NAME> had to prompt , and this is how they prompted .
It was a little disconcerting to me , to find , when I was being helped up behind the coach , that I was supposed to have eaten all the dinner without any assistance .
Boiling water hissed and heaved within dilapidated walls ; whence , also , the glare and roar of flames came issuing forth ; and mounds of ashes blocked up rights of way , and wholly changed the law and custom of the neighbourhood .
<NAME> was older in years than the Dodger : having perhaps numbered eighteen winters ; but there was a degree of deference in his deportment towards that young gentleman which seemed to indicate that he felt himself conscious of a slight inferiority in point of genius and professional aquirements .
He added , ' And besides , you know it ' s likely that you ' ll soon have your sister -- ' ' <NAME> , yes ! ' cried <NAME> with a sigh of affection .
But here I am , left with all the ridiculous parts of the situation remaining , and , added to them all , this ridiculous dress !
' To see the clinging of that pretty little thing to her uncle , ' said <NAME> ; ' to see the way she holds on to him , tighter and tighter , and closer and closer , every day , is to see a sight .
And so she used to sit propped up in a great arm-chair , with her beautiful complexion and rosy lips , staring at me -- or not so much at me , I think , as at nothing -- while I busily stitched away and told her every one of my secrets .
The city clocks had only just gone three , but it was quite dark already -- it had not been light all day -- and candles were flaring in the windows of the neighbouring offices , like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air .
' I must be a prisoner for a little while , ' said <NAME> , ' but here are the old books , <NAME> , and the old music. ' ' Even the old flowers are here , ' said I , looking round ; ' or the old kinds. ' ' I have found a pleasure , ' returned <NAME> , smiling , ' while you have been absent , in keeping everything as it used to be when we were children .
Two taps were now heard on the outside of the window .
" Yes , so you did say about ten .
His endeavouring to hoist himself on to a very high window-seat , and his slipping down again , appeared to prepare <NAME> ' s mind for the reception of a discovery .
But from this day , the <NAME> action upon <NAME> threw <NAME> and <NAME> more together , and strengthened the dangerous alienation from her husband and confidence against him with another , into which she had fallen by degrees so fine that she could not retrace them if she tried .
In a preposterous coat , like a beadle ' s , with cuffs and flaps exaggerated to an unspeakable extent ; in an immense waistcoat , knee-breeches , buckled shoes , and a mad cocked hat ; with nothing fitting him , and everything of coarse material , moth-eaten and full of holes ; with seams in his black face , where fear and heat had started through the greasy composition daubed all over it ; anything so grimly , detestably , ridiculously shameful as the whelp in his comic livery , <NAME> never could by any other means have believed in , weighable and measurable fact though it was .
" <NAME> coarse and common ? " said <NAME> , playing with <NAME> 's hair .
One night , the third after <NAME> ' s interview with <NAME> , the old man , who had been weak and ill all day , said he should not leave home .
You know how few our wants are -- <NAME> ' s and mine -- and what little use we have for money , after the life we have led together for so many years ; and now that he is earning an income that is ample for us , through your kindness .
<NAME> , <NAME> , beautiful and drooping , cling to him with the utmost trust of thy bruised heart ; for he has clung to thee , with all the might of his great love !
From the blacksmith's. " " Halloa ! " said the sergeant , staring at <NAME> .
' You will take cold in the evening air , ' urged the spinster aunt affectionately .
You , to be sure ! ' observed my aunt , ' and you can ' t fan it away , my military friend ! ' ) ' It was the first unhappiness of my new life , ' said <NAME> .
' What ' s put marriage in your head ? ' She answered with such a start , that it quite awoke me .

Let ' s talk ! ' ' Do you always live here , sir ? ' asked <NAME> .
All I desire , <NAME> , is , that it should be forgotten .
somewhere , anywhere , for refuge , never more to look upon the place from which she fled !
You are welcome to all you have kept from me. ' ' Are those of your own name dear to you ? ' said the man emphatically .
What was she a doing of , when you went in today ? " asked <NAME> .
Mr Chick , finding that his destiny was , for the time , against him , said no more , and walked off .
' Dead , <NAME> ? ' I hinted , after a respectful pause .
Both times I thought ( though that may easily be my mistake ) , that he hardly looked as if he had met me by accident. ' ' Did he say anything ? ' ' No ; he only nodded and put his head on one side. ' ' The devil take his head ! ' mused <NAME> , still looking at the fire ; ' it ' s always on one side. ' He roused himself to persuade her to put some wine to her lips , and to touch something to eat -- it was very difficult , she was so timid and shy -- and then said , musing again : ' Is my mother at all changed to you ? ' ' Oh , not at all .
Here ' s a match , and now where ' s the candle ?
I am sorry to see you sitting in the street . "
' I am going up stairs to Mr Fledgeby ' s. ' ' You can not do that at this moment .
The storm soon began to pass upon its way .
And still the sick old woman looks into the corner , where the stone arm -- part of a figure of some tomb , she says -- is raised to strike her .
He has proved himself so different from me and has done so much to raise himself while I 've been soldiering that I have n't brass enough in my composition to see him in this place and under this charge .
Now , my dear , about that crib at <NAME> ; when is it to be done , <NAME> , eh ?
I could be here in the day , and turn in the night .
I pretend to no claim upon you , <NAME> , but for the zealous and active discharge -- not the languid and routine discharge , sir : that much credit I stipulate for -- of my professional duty .
Receive at parting ; ' here he gave him a southern embrace , and kissed him soundly on both cheeks ; ' the word of a gentleman !
Now , the unfortunate deceased was himself a lawyer and had a pretty tight hold of me .
You and I are very different creatures . "
<NAME> <NAME> , catching sight of a lady ' s face at the window of the sedan , turned hastily round , plied the knocker with all his might and main , and called frantically upon the chairman to take the chair away again .
" My dear Jarndyce , " returned <NAME> , his genial face irradiated by the comicality of this idea , " what am I to do ?
I am sure I shall be very happy to show <NAME> to you .
* A remarkable instance of the prophetic force of <NAME> ' s imagination ; this dialogue occurring in the year 1827 , and the Revolution in 1830 .
As shadows of her fond imagination , she could give them equal place in her own bosom , and wrong them with no doubts .
I have started up so vividly impressed by it , that its fury has yet seemed raging in my quiet room , in the still night .
'You 're very , very kind to me , ma'am , ' said <NAME> .
Or , if he was at any time inclined to relieve his mind by singing a comic song or dancing a hornpipe , and was obliged to do it to the <NAME> March in <NAME> , he might find himself put out in the execution of his lively intentions. ' ' Poor Pa ! ' thought <NAME> , as she hung upon his arm .
I remember dreaming night after night , of being with my mother as she used to be , or of going to a party at <NAME> ' s , or of travelling outside the stage-coach , or of dining again with my unfortunate friend the waiter , and in all these circumstances making people scream and stare , by the unhappy disclosure that I had nothing on but my little night-shirt , and that placard .
You have never been a companion before , have you ? ' Mrs. Nickleby , who had been eagerly watching her opportunity , came dexterously in , before <NAME> could reply .
To whom did he appear to repeat her faltering words , when , raising his voice and turning his head towards the door of the room from which he had issued , he said : " Removed to the <NAME> , and summoned for to-morrow ? " The dread tribunal of five Judges , <NAME> , and determined <NAME> , sat every day .
In the meantime , his son , whose head was garnished with tenderer spikes , and whose young eyes stood close by one another , as his father 's did , kept the required watch upon his mother .
' My head ' s a bit light , and my feet are a bit heavy , ' said old <NAME> , leaning her face drowsily on the breast of the woman who had spoken before .
The noise of the rain did not disturb him much ; but it attracted his attention sufficiently to make him raise his head sometimes , as if he were rather remonstrating with the elements .
The little man seemed rather baffled by these several repulses , and a short consultation took place between him and the two plump gentlemen .
Do n't believe that I 'll leave you or yours in the lurch , <NAME> .
When she DID say that <NAME> , being always denied to her by his employer ( which I had no doubt at the time was a foreign mode of viewing a clerk ) , she would do herself the pleasure of continually calling at my place until she was let in here .
' And she has a right to do as she likes , I hope , <NAME> , ' said the old lady trembling , partly with anger and partly with a secret fear of her impish son-in-law .
" I intend to , <NAME> , " replies the other .
" Why do you point away ? "
After great consternation had been excited in the mind of Mrs. Cluppins , by an attempt on the part of <NAME> to recount how he had been cross-examined regarding the cupboard then in action ( which was fortunately nipped in the bud by his imbibing half a glass of the old crusted ' the wrong way , ' and thereby endangering his life for some seconds ) , the party walked forth in quest of a <NAME> stage .
Springing a Mine Refreshed by sleep , <NAME> rises betimes in the morning and prepares for a field-day .
' Pray , my dear , allow me to conclude .
I am prepared to do the usual thing which I have done regularly and to keep this matter going .
It is scarcely worth mentioning ; but , is it yet ? " " I had no intention , in the words I used , to claim it yet .
I think about a great many things , ' replied <NAME> .
' Quite , quite , dear brother ; and I can not tell you how happy I am that I have acted as you would have had me. ' ' You don ' t regret ? ' ' N -- n -- no , ' said <NAME> timidly , tracing some pattern upon the ground with her little foot .
They had nearly crossed the bridge , when a gentleman came coolly sauntering towards them , with a cigar in his mouth , his coat thrown back , and his hands behind him .
I suppose they have not done trying on yet .
In the gallery opposite to the pulpit were a little choir of male and female singers , a violoncello , and a violin .
The hopes I have been encouraged to form that you come from that lady , do not deceive me , I trust. ' ' I left her within an hour. ' ' At— ! ' ' At her father ' s. ' <NAME> ' s face lengthened in spite of his coolness , and his perplexity increased .
' Well , well , <NAME> , ' he said , with a disappointed air , ' this is not to the purpose .
Yielding to this fancy , and pleased to find that its indulgence beguiled the sick boy of many tedious hours , and never failed to afford him matter for thought and conversation afterwards , <NAME> made such spots the scenes of their daily rambles : driving him from place to place in a little pony-chair , and supporting him on his arm while they walked slowly among these old haunts , or lingered in the sunlight to take long parting looks of those which were most quiet and beautiful .
Their entrance , whether by premeditation or a simultaneous impulse , was the signal of revolt .
The turkey in the poultry-yard , always troubled with a class-grievance ( probably Christmas ) , may be reminiscent of that summer morning wrongfully taken from him when he got into the lane among the felled trees , where there was a barn and barley .
He flung him in , bolted it , and turned the key .
Here it was that <NAME> and <NAME> were seated on the evening after the conclusion of the election , with several other temporary inmates of the house , smoking and drinking .
' You are a happy fellow .
Not having a very clearly defined notion of what a live board was , <NAME> was rather astounded by this intelligence , and was not quite certain whether he ought to laugh or cry .
Well ? " " When you first caused me to be brought here , <NAME> , when I belonged to the village over yonder , that I wish I had never left , I suppose I did really come here , as any other chance boy might have come , -- as a kind of servant , to gratify a want or a whim , and to be paid for it ? " " Ay , <NAME> , " replied <NAME> , steadily nodding her head ; " you did. " " And that <NAME> -- " " Mr .
This short examination followed , for the court was quick with its work .
His cold and distant nature had neither sought one , nor found one .
" No , I don ' t , " says the man .
In a moment , <NAME> was at the door ; and the other , rising from her seat at her beck , came slowly , and with no conciliatory look , towards her .
I suppose , " said <NAME> , shutting his eyes and lifting up his shoulders with modest consciousness , " that I must show myself , as usual , about town . "
A morsel of bread. ' ' Do you see that ? ' returned the man hoarsely , pointing to a kind of bundle on the ground .
Diwisions among such must come , and must be met as they come .
He don ' t care for me , as I care for him ! ' cried <NAME> , lifting up her skinny hands .
It ' s Monday morning. ' ' At once , if you please , <NAME> , by all means , ' returned <NAME> .
There is an ordinary for ladies , and an ordinary for gentlemen .
You have not acquired , under <NAME> and Mrs. M ' Choakumchild , anything like that amount of exact knowledge which I looked for .
<NAME> on our staircase and read .
Where was I brought from ? ' Boldwig !
This is the separation that there is between us !
So , <NAME> ' s tombstone , with her father ' s record of his death , was almost of the Present , for she knew it was to be .
Have you no remembrance of what has been said between us ?
<NAME> then -- jauntily stepping out a little with his well-shaped right leg , as though he said to Mr Merdle ' don ' t mind the apron ; a mere form ! ' put this case to his good friend : Whether it had occurred to his good friend , that <NAME> might not unreasonably hope that one so blest in his undertakings , and whose example on his pedestal was so influential with it , would shed a little money in the direction of a mission or so to <NAME> ?
It ' s his trade to make the most of everything appertaining to the <NAME> , you know. ' ' I may tell the Dean—I call expressly from the Dean—that you are all right again ? ' The reply , with a slight smile , is : ' Certainly ; with my respects and thanks to the Dean. ' ' I ' m glad to hear that you expect young Drood. ' ' I expect the dear fellow every moment. ' ' Ah !
The view it commands of <NAME> 's Court at one end ( not to mention a squint into <NAME> ) and of <NAME> ' the sheriff 's officer 's backyard at the other she regards as a prospect of unequalled beauty .
Here ' s a game ! ' <NAME> , too , the greater part of the boys came back low-spirited , and were not so boisterous at my expense as I had expected .
Finding that his watch has stopped , he turns into the jeweller ' s shop , to have it wound and set .
And now let me take the liberty of asking you a question .
That spice of romance and love of the marvellous , of which there was a pretty strong infusion in the nature of young <NAME> , and which the guardianship of his Uncle , old <NAME> , had not very much weakened by the waters of stern practical experience , was the occasion of his attaching an uncommon and delightful interest to the adventure of <NAME> with <NAME> .
' I was going on with the little I had left to say .
The fact is , that <NAME> was invited down to a marriage -- which I think took place in <NAME> ? ' ' Shropshire , ' said the bold mild man , finding himself appealed to .
She ' ll never wake till it ' s all over , and there goes the clock again !
There ' s so much trouble in illness , and so much expense , and she ' s seen such a lot of its being objected to. ' ' But she never can have thought , ' said <NAME> , ' that I would grudge the dear child anything ? ' ' No mum , but she might have thought ( as a habit-like ) of its standing in <NAME> ' s light , and might have tried to bring him through it unbeknownst. ' <NAME> knew his ground well .
Would you come up-stairs and wait for her ? ' ' Thank you. ' Turning himself as slowly as he turned in his mind whatever he heard or said , he led the way up the narrow stairs .
' You ' re very good , <NAME> , ' returned <NAME> , ' I am sure .
There could not well be more ink splashed about it , if it had been roofless from its first construction , and the skies had rained , snowed , hailed , and blown ink through the varying seasons of the year .
I congratulate you with all my heart , my dear. ' The good soft little fellow , drying his eyes , here , <NAME> put her arms round his neck and tenderly kissed him on the high road , passionately telling him he was the best of fathers and the best of friends , and that on her wedding-morning she would go down on her knees to him and beg his pardon for having ever teased him or seemed insensible to the worth of such a patient , sympathetic , genial , fresh young heart .
I only wish I wos , myself .
" I take it as a compliment . "
' He is a vagabond on his own statement , -- is he not , <NAME> ? ' ' <NAME> , Sir. ' ' Then I ' ll commit him -- I ' ll commit him as such , ' said <NAME> .
Still I don ' t say that I ' m going to keep ' em always there , for the sake of the beauty of the landscape .
The last man , whoever he is -- and he may be a cobbler or some low vulgar dog for aught we know -- will have a longer pedigree than the greatest nobleman now alive ; and I contend that this is not fair .
He was the stateliest man in the company .
Her friendly indignation had an exemplary effect upon her husband , who shook his head at the trooper several times as a silent recommendation to him to yield .
' What friend o ' yourn is dead ? ' asks <NAME> .
He fills his pipe , lights it , and marches up and down smoking , as his custom is , while <NAME> , raising a powerful odour of hot rolls and coffee , prepares breakfast .
' Besides which , ' continued <NAME> , ' I should expect him , now and then , to go through a few figures in the printed tables , and to pick out a few results , so that I might come out pretty well on timber duty questions , and finance questions , and so on ; and I should like him to get up a few little arguments about the disastrous effects of a return to cash payments and a metallic currency , with a touch now and then about the exportation of bullion , and the <NAME> , and bank notes , and all that kind of thing , which it ' s only necessary to talk fluently about , because nobody understands it .
Where did they go first , <NAME> ? ' The wretched <NAME> made a gasp , and a pause .
' I am sure I don ' t know what to do , ' said Mr Boffin .
It was <NAME> ' s hand , and he kept it on my arm as he said : ' What ' s this ?
His face appeared to me to be quite destitute of colour , and now that I saw him without his seeing me , I fully saw , for the first time , how worn away he was .
There being plenty of gravy to-day , <NAME> spooned into my plate , at this point , about half a pint .
So strong was the impression , that I stood under the beam shuddering from head to foot before I knew it was a fancy , -- though to be sure I was there in an instant .
Some hopeful notion of seeing her , busily engaged in her daily duties , before she saw me , had been in my mind and was defeated .
' I am glad to hear you admit so much , sir , ' retorted <NAME> , in his most offensive manner ; ' and I candidly tell you that I didn ' t expect it. ' Here he lowered heavily at <NAME> again .
What ' s she staring at ? ' he added , in allusion to the daughter , whose eyes were fixed upon the face that now again looked out behind .
Finding him so very friendly and companionable , it was then that I asked for the pen and ink and paper , to write to <NAME> .
The little expedition down the river was delightful , and the little room overlooking the river into which they were shown for dinner was delightful .
' Where ' s the reason for it ?
" Two or three months at <NAME> " <NAME> was highly delighted when we shook hands on this arrangement , and said he could now take courage to tell me that he believed he must go away at the end of the week .
We tarried here three days .
It being quite dark , the <NAME> consented : peeping carefully out first , as he had been wont to do in his time of hiding from <NAME> ; and arming himself with his large stick , in case of an appeal to arms being rendered necessary by any unforeseen circumstance .
There is a tie of many suffering years between us two , and it is the only tie I ever had on earth that <NAME> has not broken . "
Put the case that a woman , under such circumstances as you have mentioned , held her child concealed , and was obliged to communicate the fact to her legal adviser , on his representing to her that he must know , with an eye to the latitude of his defence , how the fact stood about that child .
He so washes , and rubs , and scrubs , and smells , and washes , that he has not long restored himself with a glass of brandy and stood silently before the fire when <NAME> 's bell strikes twelve and all those other bells strike twelve from their towers of various heights in the dark air , and in their many tones .
There are three free-schools already erected , and in full operation in this city .
Get up , get up ! ' Her mother rose , and cried , and wrung her hands , and stood at a little distance gazing on her .
That room was their boat ; that audience were the maidens ; and he ( <NAME> ) , however unworthily , was ' first oars ' ( unbounded applause ) .
' And ye steer with a rudder , don ' t ye ?
He had divested himself of his brown paper parcel , but had made no alteration in his attire , and was , if possible , more loquacious than ever .
' We shall be happy , ' said <NAME> , ' to see <NAME> to dinner , every Sunday , if it should suit his convenience .
" Where are you going to , at <NAME> ? " I asked <NAME> .
Never done nothink to get myself into no trouble , 'sept in not moving on and the inkwhich .
But never mind him now .
Therefore , the next time little <NAME> woke , <NAME> set himself to attract his wandering attention , and this not being a very difficult task ( one sneeze effected it ) , he signed to him to rouse his mother .
When we stopped for supper I couldn ' t muster courage to take any , though I should have liked it very much , but sat by the fire and said I didn ' t want anything .
It would n't have loosened the knot , or kept the drop up , a minute longer .
When we came to ' Here ' s a hand , my trusty frere ' , we all joined hands round the table ; and when we declared we would ' take a right gude <NAME> ' , and hadn ' t the least idea what it meant , we were really affected .
You see the rock that lies in his course .
Therefore <NAME> gave two knocks .
<NAME> for nothing but to have my place occupied , and then for <NAME> ! " " Why , then , " said <NAME> , grasping his eager but so firm and steady hand , " it does not all depend on one old man , but I shall have a young and ardent man at my side. " " By the help of Heaven you shall !
There ' s a providence in everything ; everything works for the best ; I have been tried today but on the whole I do not regret it. ' In which <NAME> spirit , <NAME> dried her eyes and smoothed her lap , and sat as became a person calm under a great wrong .
<NAME> shall we have ? ' Our dear <NAME> would then receive his instructions ; and would sit heavily among the company at table and wander lumpishly about his drawing-rooms afterwards , only remarkable for appearing to have nothing to do with the entertainment beyond being in its way .
If you were a man of business , sergeant , you would not need to be informed that there are confidential reasons , very harmless in themselves , for many such wants in the profession to which I belong .
' I can ' t help myself ! ' cried Mr Boffin , flouncing on the settle in a forlorn manner , with his hands deep in his pockets , as if his pockets had sunk .
" <NAME> if I know , " said <NAME> .
' To hang himself ! ' cried <NAME> again .
I should not be at all surprised if he called to-day .
The banners were very well painted , and flaunted down the street famously .
' Here ' s somebody comin ' at last , ma ' am , ' said the short chairman .
" Then grant me this one great favour .
' Here ' s dinner been ready , half an hour , and no Walter ! ' Turning round upon his stool behind the counter , Mr <NAME> looked out among the instruments in the window , to see if his nephew might be crossing the road .
There ' s evidence , ' said my mother , sobbing ; ' ask <NAME> if I didn ' t do very well when I wasn ' t interfered with ! ' ' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' let there be an end of this .
" Do n't say that , do n't say that .
' Think well of what you do. ' ' Yes , you had better think well , ' said Mr Boffin .
" And was christened so , my dear , " said <NAME> .
A dense justice in a corner is beguiled into a wink .
' Then give me your hand , ' retorted <NAME> .
' When we worked like the neighbours , we suited one another .
Thinking of this , she did not turn away with a delicate indignation -- too many of her own compassionate and tender sex too often do -- but pitied her .
So <NAME> went further in , and , when the clocks were striking ten , stood on P. J. T. ' s doorsteps , wondering what P. J. T. had done with his street-door .
After each sitting was over , and the patron had departed , Mr Wegg invariably saw Mr Venus home .
A <NAME> on My Way LXIII .
Nothing but a gentleman , <NAME> ! '
<NAME> <NAME> was much tickled at this : as of course he ought to be ; and laughed a long time without cessation .
I think nothing can be plainer than that ? ' ' Shall I marry him ? ' repeated <NAME> , with great deliberation .
Mr <NAME> also had been utterly discomfited , and quite unable to assert himself in any way .
' <NAME> , ' to <NAME> , who was revenging himself for the studies to come , on the plum-cake , ' this is a young gentleman you ought to know .
' Having your likeness taken , sir , ' replied the stout turnkey .
I ca n't talk about business till I 've eat and drank ; so produce the sustainance , and let 's have a quiet fill-out for the first time these three days ! '
<NAME> waited for the last stroke , and then knocked .
But as my aunt had swathed me up , I made no complaint of being inconvenienced .
All I have in the world is in this room , except the cottage ; and that I have left <NAME> to let .
" Repeal it , my dear sir ?
It was no nominal meal that we were going to make , but a vigorous reality .
' I know the stick to be his , and he carried it last night .
The low arched door then opened , and the face came out .
I have not the power . "
Let us go on again ; and passing this wilderness of an hotel with stores about its base , like some <NAME> theatre , or the <NAME> shorn of its colonnade , plunge into the Five Points .
' To vich sum , he has added for the house and bisness -- ' ' Lease , good-vill , stock , and fixters , ' interposed <NAME> .
I knew I recollected the face. ' It was , indeed , <NAME> , the ugly clerk .
' Come on ! ' said the cab-driver , sparring away like clockwork .
He quite laughed when I asked him the question , and said there was no fear ; no man in his senses , or out of them , would put off in such a gale of wind , least of all Ham Peggotty , who had been born to seafaring .
' The gentleman , ' said the stranger , ' that advertised in the <NAME> newspaper ? ' ' -- Morning <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , regarding the <NAME> called <NAME> at the delightful village of <NAME> , near <NAME> Bridge in <NAME> , ' added <NAME> .
My father , <NAME> , he were given to drink , and when he were overtook with drink , he hammered away at my mother , most onmerciful .
As many restless spirits , who have hunted fortune , fame , or pleasure through the world , retire in their decline to where they first drew breath , vainly seeking to be children once again before they die , so we , less fortunate than they in early life , but happier in its closing scenes , will set up our rest again among our boyish haunts , and going home with no hope realised , that had its growth in manhood -- carrying back nothing that we brought away , but our old yearnings to each other -- saving no fragment from the wreck of life , but that which first endeared it -- may be , indeed , but children as at first .
It is strange to know no more about either , and particularly you , than I was able to tell last night .
The Secretary would have attended her , but <NAME> advancing and saying with dignity , ' Pardon me !
asked <NAME> , anxiously regarding him .
The influence pervaded the spirit in which they returned to the previous question .
Go on , Sammy. ' ' " Lovely creetur , " ' repeated <NAME> .
The touch had its instantaneous effect .
<NAME> by ! ' ' But I couldn ' t rest , ' said <NAME> , ' without coming to ask you what you think about dear Walter -- who is my brother now -- and whether there is anything to fear , and whether you will not go and console his poor Uncle every day , until we have some intelligence of him ? ' At these words <NAME> , as by an involuntary gesture , clapped his hand to his head , on which the hard glazed hat was not , and looked discomfited .
' For the parents of a boy named <NAME> , who unfortunately -- ' ' -- unfortunately died at <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , finishing the sentence .
When these things were all forgotten , he hoped that <NAME> and he might still be warm friends , and that no word or thought of his humble home , or of her who was well contented to remain there and share his quiet fortunes , would ever again disturb the harmony between them .
" In all other respects , my dear mother , I 'll be as tractable and obedient as you can wish ; on this one alone , I stand out .
I see her , an old woman , weeping for me on the anniversary of this day .
As it was , however , he kept his own secret ; and went home late from the Instrument-maker ' s house , wearing the glazed hat so much on one side , and carrying such a beaming expression in his eyes , that <NAME> ( who might have been brought up at <NAME> Blimber ' s , she was such a <NAME> matron ) fortified herself , at the first glimpse of him , behind the open street door , and refused to come out to the contemplation of her blessed infants , until he was securely lodged in his own room .
While one detachment rushed to the door and locked it , and another mounted on the desks and forms , the stoutest ( and consequently the newest ) boy seized the cane , and confronting Mrs. Squeers with a stern countenance , snatched off her cap and beaver bonnet , put them on his own head , armed himself with the wooden spoon , and bade her , on pain of death , go down upon her knees and take a dose directly .
<NAME> as if she knew all about it , do n't she ?
' Forgive me ; I could not help saying that .
' Certainly not , ' chimed in Mrs. Sanders , who , from certain wistful glances at the little tin saucepan , seemed to be engaged in a mental calculation of the probable extent of the pettitoes , in the event of <NAME> ' s being asked to stop to supper .
' You know whether the cap fits you , <NAME> , ' returned her brother sulkily .
' Please let me hold the pens , ' said <NAME> .
So go on my buck , ' said Mr <NAME> , taking his leave of the ceiling with a significant nod , ' and let us see which of us will be tired first ! ' Dismissing the subject of his downfall with these reflections , which were no doubt very profound , and are indeed not altogether unknown in certain systems of moral philosophy , Mr <NAME> shook off his despondency and assumed the cheerful ease of an irresponsible clerk .
One beautiful evening , when the first shades of twilight were beginning to settle upon the earth , <NAME> sat at this window , intent upon his books .
We will never go away from here ? ' The child shook her head and smiled .
<NAME> <NAME> V. A Morning Adventure VI .
For , though this celebration of to-day is all a mockery , he is my husband , and we must live. -- Do you think it like ? ' <NAME> , in a stunned condition , feigns to compare the portrait in his hand with the original looking towards him from his <NAME> corner .
Therefore I have particularly begged of <NAME> , and I now particularly beg of you , my dear , not to move this subject with <NAME> .
' Halloa ! ' cried a voice inside .
<NAME> <NAME> merely paused in the act of drinking , and bade him either name his business or leave the table .
I shall never get its name now .
How do you do , <NAME> ?
Two friends of the young man , whom we had attracted to the doorway and who stood there with their hands in their pockets , echoed the laugh noisily .
With an uneasy flush upon his face , and hesitation in his manner , he then said in a still lower tone than he had adopted yet : ' Mrs Gowan , I scarcely know how to acquit myself of what I feel to be a duty , and yet I must ask you for your kind consideration in attempting to discharge it .
<NAME> says , ' Oh dear ! ' <NAME> says , ' Oh dear ! ' <NAME> says , ' Oh dear ! ' All , in a rumbling tone of protest .
Whether of questionable childishness or not in any other matters , <NAME> had a child 's enjoyment of change and bright weather .
I dare say you do , <NAME> ? ' ' _I_ remember ' em well enough , ' said the latter .
" In fact , I have just turned into my teens , " says <NAME> .
This guileless youth , descrying the position of affairs , which even his innocence could not mistake , limited his waiting to languishing admiringly against the sideboard when <NAME> didn ' t want anything , and swooping at her when she did .
' I would rather go alone , thank you .
So <NAME> addresses a crazy little woman who is his female lodger , who appears and vanishes in a breath , who soon returns accompanied by a testy medical man brought from his dinner , with a broad , snuffy upper lip and a broad <NAME> tongue .
<NAME> , the uncle , commands the nephew to marry .
For more than a week she lay there , little altered outwardly , with her old handsome resolute frown that I so well knew carved upon her face .
Only don ' t crow. ' ' I crow ! ' exclaimed <NAME> , shrugging his shoulders .
I decided , that day , to write privately to the Minister , stating the nature of the two cases to which I had been summoned , and the place to which I had gone : in effect , stating all the circumstances .
<NAME> , consult your own safety , and don ' t remain here ; the living before the dead ; goodbye ! ' With these words , he seized <NAME> by the arm , and hurried him away .
' If there were any good , ' he said , ' I could do on this earth , I would do it , <NAME> , for you .
' Pounds for two , I think , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , solemnly .
Finding at last , however , that , although I had been all this time a very porcupine or hedgehog , bristling all over with determination , I had effected nothing , it began to occur to me that perhaps <NAME> ' s mind was already formed .
' You keep with us , ' said Mr Meagles , in a threatening kind of <NAME> , ' and I ' ll introduce you presently .
It is possible that the gentleman may , on similar grounds , object to you. ' ' I hope so , ' returned <NAME> .
' I begin to think , ' observed <NAME> , ' that I never shall see him. ' ' These things happen so oddly sometimes , ' said <NAME> with a steady countenance , ' that there seems a kind of fatality in them .
A buzz then went round among the young gentlemen , of ' <NAME> ' s going ! ' ' Little Dombey ' s going ! ' and there was a general move after <NAME> and <NAME> down the staircase and into the hall , in which the whole Blimber family were included .
There are Podsnap the <NAME> , and <NAME> .
Her husband had no relations , and she was rich .
Has a small scar over her eye , a good many teeth missing , the letter A is branded on her cheek and forehead. ' ' Ran away , negro Ben .
You 'll go down ? " " Yes , " said I , casting my eyes over the note , which was exactly in those terms .
When old Mr <NAME> proposed his orphan nephew to my father for my husband , my father impressed upon me that his bringing-up had been , like mine , one of severe restraint .
As these works are pretty much alike all through the States , their general characteristics are easily described .
She made him our guardian , and he was a miserly wretch who grudged us food to eat , and clothes to wear .
' Yes , ' said <NAME> , biting his lip .
It hushed the eloquent , struck down the powerful , abolished the beautiful and good .
Mrs General conceded that high privilege , and here she was .
I have had unformed ideas of striving afresh , beginning anew , shaking off sloth and sensuality , and fighting out the abandoned fight .
We have had quite enough of the subject. ' Thus expressing himself , <NAME> led the conversation to different topics , and <NAME> gradually appeared more at ease , though still very far from being completely so .
But this was the origin of a series of Sunday excursions that these two curious companions made together .
She is the same bright vision to me , at present , that she was before I made <NAME> ' s acquaintance .
At last , the <NAME> read himself into a light slumber .
And at last he emerged from the room , bottle in hand , and , remarking that he was very sorry to say he had been making a fool of himself , begged to propose the health and happiness of <NAME> and Mrs. Winkle , whose felicity , so far from envying , he would be the first to congratulate them upon .
Where ' s your risk ? ' ' Why , you know , ' said <NAME> , fidgeting in his chair , ' if you come to that , I might say where ' s yours ? ' ' You might say where ' s mine ! ' returned <NAME> ; ' you may say where ' s mine .
" So we talked a good deal about it , and so I said to <NAME> , 'Prince , as <NAME> -- ' " " I hope you did n't say 'Miss <NAME> ' ? "
" That was when you never ought to have asked for the security , <NAME> , and when you never ought to have got it , all things considered .
There is no hurry or greediness apparent in the despatch of the meal .
My deary , show me a better !
' But it ' s worth the pain of hearing , only to know that Mrs. <NAME> recovered it , isn ' t it , <NAME> ? ' cried <NAME> .
We had , on our way out , to cross a paved hall , with glass sides and roof , over which a vine was trained .
All the evening his eyes wandered to my aunt ' s face , with an expression of the most dismal apprehension , as if he saw her growing thin on the spot .
You know that <NAME> is dead ; that <NAME> has confessed ; that there is no hope of any further gain .
At length , a low cry of pain broke the stillness that prevailed ; and uttering it , the boy awoke .
It will be like coming to the old <NAME> again . "
<NAME> <NAME> , I am very sorry too. ' ' Goodness knows , ' exclaimed <NAME> , ' there ' s a many we could spare instead , if numbers is a object , <NAME> as a overseer would come cheap at her weight in gold , and if a knowledge of black slavery should be required , them <NAME> is the very people for the sitiwation. ' With that <NAME> untied her bonnet strings , and after looking vacantly for some moments into a little black teapot that was set forth with the usual homely service on the table , shook her head and a tin canister , and began unasked to make the tea .
<NAME> faith in , and immeasurable admiration of , the <NAME> of the <NAME> , succeeded , and threw the <NAME> into a wondering trance .
And what more could I possibly do , if I did believe it ! ' ' You are a singular politician , ' said <NAME> .
I have no false pride .
I should think her like me .
But that didn ' t last long ; for <NAME> , happening to change the position of his tight plump legs , as if he were going to get up , <NAME> swiftly vanished , and appeared no more .
All this was done with the greatest dispatch and without the waste of a moment ; yet nobody was at all hurried .
It is even difficult for me to believe that there was a gap of full two months between my return to <NAME> and the arrival of that birthday .
Every one must. ' ' I hope so , ' said the cherub .
' " " The man says ? " I observed , as <NAME> waited for me to speak .
I don ' t wonder , I ' m sure , at your being a little flurried by having a scene with this fellow , but it ' s all over , my dear , and you ' re righted , and it ' s -- and it ' s ALL right ! ' <NAME> repeated with a highly satisfied air of completeness and finality .
If they ' re hard upon you , brother , as mayhap they are , give ' em a wide berth , sheer off , and part company cheerily ! ' ' <NAME> , ' returned Mr Toots , ' I hardly know how it is , but after what you told me when I came here , for the first time , I -- I feel that I ' d rather think about <NAME> in your society than talk about her in almost anybody else ' s .
Still <NAME> said , think of the situation !
' This , ' said <NAME> , presenting a cheek to be kissed , as sympathetic and responsive as the back of the bowl of a spoon , ' is quite an honour !
' And vere is <NAME> ? ' inquired the old gentleman .
<NAME> <NAME> smoothed his head and face , and stood looking at the fire .
' I am pretty much as usual , sir , ' replied <NAME> .
The child , who was nearest to him , told them afterwards , and told her grandchildren when she was a handsome old lady , that she heard him say , " A life you love. " When he had gone out into the next room , he turned suddenly on <NAME> and her father , who were following , and said to the latter : " You had great influence but yesterday , <NAME> ; let it at least be tried .
The circumstance of having another listener to the wonders unfolded by <NAME> , or , as it were , another calculator to cast up the guineas found in teapots , chimneys , racks and mangers , and other such banks of deposit , seemed greatly to heighten Mr <NAME> ' s enjoyment ; while <NAME> , for his part , though of a jealous temperament which might under ordinary circumstances have resented the anatomist ' s getting into favour , was so very anxious to keep his eye on that gentleman -- lest , being too much left to himself , he should be tempted to play any tricks with the precious document in his keeping -- that he never lost an opportunity of commending him to Mr <NAME> ' s notice as a third party whose company was much to be desired .
' -- are not to be combated by any one , and I address myself to no such hopeless task .
" It does her credit , Mat ! "
The hotel in which we live , is a long row of small houses fronting on the street , and opening at the back upon a common yard , in which hangs a great triangle .
She raised her eyes sufficiently to observe that the figure which presented itself was that of a slight and beautiful girl ; then , bending them on the ground , she tossed her head with affected carelessness as she said : 'It 's a hard matter to get to see you , lady .
I sit down by the fire , thinking with a blind remorse of all those secret feelings I have nourished since my marriage .
' I think , father , I require a little time. ' ' Papa is a preferable mode of address , ' observed Mrs General .
Why me ? ' ' Upon my honour , I think Mr Merdle reposes greater confidence in you than in any one. ' ' On the contrary , he tells me absolutely nothing , even professionally .
Here ' s the cottage , taking one time with another , will produce say seventy pounds a year .
So , <NAME> kept very still ; partly because he was anxious to obey the kind old lady in all things ; and partly , to tell the truth , because he was completely exhausted with what he had already said .
Faring on and hiding , hiding and faring on , the poor harmless creature , as though she were a <NAME> and the whole country were up after her , wore out the day , and gained the night .
The Courier , with agitation in his voice , announced ' <NAME> ! ' Mr <NAME> ' s overwrought heart bounded as he leaped up .
He wore a black velvet waistcoat , with thunder-and-lightning buttons ; and a blue striped shirt , with a white false collar .
When it was impossible to sustain the concluding note any longer , the skipper bellowed forth a terrific ' ahoy ! ' intended in part as a friendly greeting , and in part to show that he was not at all breathed .
These , and other practical witticisms , coupled with the unaccountable absence of <NAME> ( who had suddenly disappeared , and was nowhere to be found ) , rendered their situation upon the whole rather more uncomfortable than pleasing or desirable .
Is she married ? " " Yes. " It was a needless question , for a new desolation in the desolate house had told me so .
" For to-day , I have , my friend .
Beyond this ; it might have restored her wit to my lady your mother -- might , under the pressing little suspicion your wisdom has recognised , have persuaded her at last to announce , covertly , in the journals , that the difficulties of a certain contract would be removed by the appearance of a certain important party to it .
They like me for his sake , as I do everything I do in life for his sake .
The wall must be crumbled , the stone decayed , To pleasure his dainty whim ; And the mouldering dust that years have made , Is a merry meal for him .
' I ha ' n ' t got a glass , ' said <NAME> .
The members of the deputation looked fiercely at each other , and afterwards at the member .
And he is making hay of the grass which is flesh , for his three daughters .
' Then you relieve my mind of a great dread , and a heavy weight , ' said <NAME> ; ' I will do it. ' <NAME> , delighted by the swiftness and completeness of his success , acknowledged it in the handsomest terms .
I began to say that I hoped I was not interrupting , when the clerk shoved this gentleman out with as little ceremony as I ever saw used , and tossing his fur cap out after him , left me alone .
Why , he would answer , " Away with it ! " That ' s what he would answer , gentlemen .
' May I ask where it happened , Mr Twemlow ?
' Indeed , you have avoided me , Mr Carker , ' said <NAME> , with the tears rising to his eyes ; so true was his compassion .
In Fashion It is but a glimpse of the world of fashion that we want on this same miry afternoon .
' <NAME> , I am going home .
' <NAME> , <NAME> ! ' said the stout gentleman , when the citadel was taken , and the besiegers and besieged sat down to dinner .
' Send my fellow here. ' ' Gone to bed , sir. ' ' Tell him to get up , and pack up. ' He wrote two more notes .
" You know what you have got to do .
' You are a very old friend of my nephew ' s , <NAME> , ' said my aunt .
I thank you for the question .
Say no more to-night. ' ' I feel the urgency of this , ' said Mr Carker , ' because it is impossible to say what unforeseen consequences might arise , or how soon , from your being unacquainted with his state of mind .
' Oh , always Wade. ' After looking at the philanthropic visage and the long silky white hair for a few seconds , during which Mr <NAME> twirled his thumbs , and smiled at the fire as if he were benevolently wishing it to burn him that he might forgive it , <NAME> began : ' I beg your pardon , Mr Casby -- ' ' Not so , not so , ' said the Patriarch , ' not so. ' ' -- But , <NAME> had an attendant with her -- a young woman brought up by friends of mine , over whom her influence is not considered very salutary , and to whom I should be glad to have the opportunity of giving the assurance that she has not yet forfeited the interest of those protectors. ' ' Really , really ? ' returned the Patriarch .
As to the washerwoman pawning the clothes , and coming in a state of penitent intoxication to apologize , I suppose that might have happened several times to anybody .
He means plain <NAME> , <NAME> -- <NAME> -- Josh .
More striking still was some indefinable resemblance , in the face of <NAME> , to both .
' I am , sir , ' replied <NAME> .
In short , we heard of a great many missions of various sorts among this set of people , but nothing respecting them was half so clear to us as that it was <NAME> 's mission to be in ecstasies with everybody else 's mission and that it was the most popular mission of all .
<NAME> <NAME> had laid the child down on his own bed , and her head had gradually fallen on the pillow beside her pretty charge .
No child could have surpassed <NAME> in inexperience of everything but wind and weather ; in simplicity , credulity , and generous trustfulness .
My young friend , <NAME> , I believe to be a very excellent and manly fellow ; and his wife I know to be a very amiable and lovely girl , well qualified to transfer to another sphere of action the happiness which for twenty years she has diffused around her , in her father ' s house .
Why , applause from the house when you first come on .
I waited for a few moments , until he could give me his undivided attention ; and then proceeded to explain the precaution , that , it had occurred to me last night , it would be wise to take .
Ride on over all obstacles , and win the race ! ' ' And win what race ? ' said I .
<NAME> ' t be too proud to come and see us , when you have made your fortune. ' ' All right ! ' said <NAME> , and went .
Yet that would be energy. ' ' Precisely my view of the case , <NAME> .
'You may depend upon me , young man , ' answered <NAME> , bowing himself gradually towards the ladder , with excessive politeness .
' For the " How " I come to you .
So she was -- so she was. ' ' And our friend was soothing her anguish , ' said <NAME> , rather maliciously .
' <NAME> , sir , ' repeated the gentleman haughtily .
That he had his reasons for this , he knew full well .
' <NAME> , you have trained me from my cradle ? ' ' Yes , Louisa. ' ' I curse the hour in which I was born to such a destiny. ' He looked at her in doubt and dread , vacantly repeating : ' Curse the hour ?
The coachman gave a tremendous double knock at the door , which was opened long before he had done , as quickly as if there had been a man behind it , with his hand tied to the latch .
That he himself had several times ' reckoned up ' <NAME> , but had never been able to bring him to a satisfactory criminal total .
It happens without any aid of mine , pretty often. ' <NAME> having smoked his cigarette down to his fingers ' ends , <NAME> had the magnanimity to throw him another .
His luck ' s got fouled under the keels of the barges .
It was , to be a gentle , useful , quiet little fellow , always striving to secure the love and attachment of the rest ; and though he was yet often to be seen at his old post on the stairs , or watching the waves and clouds from his solitary window , he was oftener found , too , among the other boys , modestly rendering them some little voluntary service .
I could only suggest that I should go down to Deal , where <NAME> was then stationed , and see him , and try if it were possible to avert the worst .
He may not deserve it , for we know no certain ill of him .
He is of what is called the old school -- a phrase generally meaning any school that seems never to have been young -- and wears knee-breeches tied with ribbons , and gaiters or stockings .
" I saw my ward oftener than she saw me , " he added , cheerily making light of it , " and I always knew she was beloved , useful , and happy .
While the visit at the <NAME> ' s was still in progress , I observed that the postman brought two or three letters every morning for <NAME> , who remained at <NAME> until the rest went back , it being a leisure time ; and that these were always directed in a business-like manner by <NAME> , who now assumed a round legal hand .
We found that a steamer for <NAME> was likely to suit our purpose best , and we directed our thoughts chiefly to that vessel .
He walked on , and she did not appear to hear his steps until he was close upon her .
' A raw , slight stripling , ' continued <NAME> , ' against a man whose very weight might crush him ; to say nothing of his skill in -- I am right , I think , ' said <NAME> , raising his eyes , ' you WERE a patron of the ring once , were you not ? ' The sick man made an impatient gesture , which <NAME> chose to consider as one of acquiescence .
When I could cry no more , I began to think ; and then the oppression on my breast was heaviest , and my grief a dull pain that there was no ease for .
' I am sure I am glad to hear it , but I don ' t know how. ' ' Pitching somebody into a mud-cart , ' said <NAME> .
Then do the swains appear with tea , with lemonade , with sandwiches , with homage .
Then they repaired to the usual family room , to receive <NAME> with a becoming show of indifference .
Mr Plornish could not conceal his exultation in her accomplishments as a linguist .
None of them ever pay .
<NAME> , far more fully than the <NAME> Newsman ever did , a <NAME> ' s Party , given by <NAME> at his Lodgings in the Borough 33 .
' Yes , yes , I understand that now , ' said <NAME> ; ' but I was going to say , I was so deceived by that , your miserly way , the reputation you had among those who knew you of being rich , and your repeated assurances that you would make of my advances treble and quadruple the interest you paid me , that I ' d have advanced you , even now , what you want , on your simple note of hand , if I hadn ' t unexpectedly become acquainted with your secret way of life. ' ' Who is it , ' retorted the old man desperately , ' that , notwithstanding all my caution , told you ?
' You have thrown yourself away , ' said <NAME> , shaking his head .
The mother looked young , and the daughter looked old ; the mother 's complexion was pink , and the daughter 's was yellow ; the mother set up for frivolity , and the daughter for theology .
He was obliged to take some mouldering fixtures that were on the place , and , among the rest , was a great lumbering wooden press for papers , with large glass doors , and a green curtain inside ; a pretty useless thing for him , for he had no papers to put in it ; and as to his clothes , he carried them about with him , and that wasn ' t very hard work , either .
In this district , as in all others where slavery sits brooding , ( I have frequently heard this admitted , even by those who are its warmest advocates : ) there is an air of ruin and decay abroad , which is inseparable from the system .
But , ' said the <NAME> , as a quotation , ' Though lost to sight , to memory dear , and <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> ! ' ' Do you live here ? ' asked <NAME> .
' I am unhappily a widower , ' said I .
' You know this gentleman , I believe ? ' I made my gentleman a distant bow , and <NAME> barely recognized him .
Brooding over the fire , with his dried little head in his dried little hands , and his dried little elbows on his dried little knees , <NAME> is melancholy .
'If he has n't peached , and is committed , there 's no fear till he comes out again , ' said <NAME> , 'and then he must be taken care on .
I said , ' Near <NAME> , ' which was all I knew .
The old house had been long ago pulled down , and a fine broad road was in its place .
Monks , still bearing that assumed name , retired with his portion to a distant part of the <NAME> ; where , having quickly squandered it , he once more fell into his old courses , and , after undergoing a long confinement for some fresh act of fraud and knavery , at length sunk under an attack of his old disorder , and died in prison .
The moping idiot , cowering down with long dishevelled hair ; the gibbering maniac , with his hideous laugh and pointed finger ; the vacant eye , the fierce wild face , the gloomy picking of the hands and lips , and munching of the nails : there they were all , without disguise , in naked ugliness and horror .
I make a respectable income by it .
' But I don ' t know your ' n. ' ' That ' s quite another thing , ' said <NAME> .
TIME went on in <NAME> like its own machinery : so much material wrought up , so much fuel consumed , so many powers worn out , so much money made .
' Never mind. ' There must be something very comprehensive in this phrase of ' Never mind , ' for we do not recollect to have ever witnessed a quarrel in the street , at a theatre , public room , or elsewhere , in which it has not been the standard reply to all belligerent inquiries .
I was not aware that anything was wrong .
<NAME> colours , excellently blended , meet the eye at every turn ; in the furniture -- its proportions admirably devised to suit the shapes and sizes of the small rooms ; on the walls ; upon the floors ; tingeing and subduing the light that comes in through the odd glass doors and windows here and there .
Suddenly the door was unlocked on the inside , and flung violently open .
The lamps across his streets had a portentously elastic swing with them .
And as to being common , I do n't make it out at all clear .
' Are you better now , mother ? ' asked one of the women .
<NAME> somebody should have got over the wall of the back-yard , and stolen it , while they were merry with the goose -- a supposition at which the two young Cratchits became livid !
Nor did I ever regard him as having anything ludicrous about him -- or anything but what was serious , honest , and good -- in his tutor communication with me .
Supported only by a sense that she was bent on conquering in her life-long fight , she went on .
But Mr <NAME> shook his head , and wouldn ' t hear of that being possible .
<NAME> ' ever , none on ' em answered ; so they gave out that he ' d run away , and she kep ' on the bis ' ness .
My business habits had one other bright feature , which I called " leaving a Margin. " For example ; supposing <NAME> 's debts to be one hundred and sixty-four pounds four-and-twopence , I would say , " Leave a margin , and put them down at two hundred. " Or , supposing my own to be four times as much , I would leave a margin , and put them down at seven hundred .
He had never conceived an aversion to her : it had not been worth his while or in his humour .
Well , <NAME> , that ' s worth a kiss , isn ' t it ? ' ' You can take one , <NAME> , ' returned <NAME> , when she had coldly paused , and slowly walked across the room , and ungraciously raised her cheek towards him , with her face turned away .
He ' s as like his Papa as he can be .
There was no divided responsibility now ; the whole burden of their two lives had fallen upon her , and henceforth she must think and act for both .
Whenever he looked back -- as once or twice he did -- her cordial face shone like a light upon his heart ; but when he plodded on his way , and saw her not , the tears were in her eyes as she stood watching him .
Mr <NAME> sat smiling in the chimney-corner , eyeing the landlord as with a roguish look he held the cover in his hand , and , feigning that his doing so was needful to the welfare of the cookery , suffered the delightful steam to tickle the nostrils of his guest .
' No , my dear , no , not an atom from anybody ' s hand but mine if you please .
By way of bringing her out dexterously , <NAME> had made the inquiry as in condescension to an old acquaintance whom she hadn ' t seen for a fortnight or so .
I looked at her , but I could not see her , I could not hear her , I could not draw my breath .
But that you have been trying me , and tampering with me , I am now sure .
Far be it from us , in the present comparatively imperfect state of the resources of our establishment , to endeavour to follow our distinguished townsman through the smoothly-flowing periods of his polished and highly-ornate address !
No man shall talk to <NAME> of <NAME> about letters , with his mind in the state it ' s in now. ' ' Bounderby , ' said <NAME> , in a tone of temperate remonstrance , ' I speak of a very special letter I have written to you , in reference to Louisa. ' ' <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> , knocking the flat of his hand several times with great vehemence on the table , ' I speak of a very special messenger that has come to me , in reference to <NAME> .
Widows , gentlemen , are not usually timorous , as my uncle used to say .
However , it was very soon after the mistake was made of putting some of the trouble out of King <NAME> ' s head into my head , that the man first came .
The people was just as good to me , and I should have gone from town to town , maybe the country through , but that I got news of her being seen among them Swiss mountains yonder .
I am ashamed to seem so selfish , but I don ' t really mean it .
' You ' ll have as much as I shall .
I thus became aware of the mutual relations between them and <NAME> , which were exemplified in the following manner .
' Oh I ' ve run such a way after you ! ' ' What do you want with me ? ' said Mr Abel .
' No , ' thought <NAME> , ' I have acted for the best. ' But , before he had gone five hundred yards , some other and different feeling would come upon him , and then he would lag again , and pulling his hat over his eyes , give way to the melancholy reflections which pressed thickly upon him .
<NAME> <NAME> shook his head with gloomy mystery , and said he wished he might come to good ; whereunto <NAME> replied , that he wished he might come to him ; which , although he agreed with the beadle in most matters , would seem to be a wish of a totally opposite description .
I ' ll walk home wi ' you. ' ' He might fall ill upon the journey back , ' said <NAME> , faintly offering a worn-out scrap of hope ; ' and in such a case , there are many places on the road where he might stop. ' ' But he is in none of them .
He had a quantity of hair and moustache -- jet black , except at the shaggy ends , where it had a tinge of red -- and a high hook nose .
Mr Feeder then told him , to his great joy , that his sister was invited , and that it was a half-yearly event , and that , as the holidays began that day , he could go away with his sister after the party , if he liked , which <NAME> interrupted him to say he would like , very much .
It was dingy enough and not at all clean , but furnished with an odd kind of shabby luxury , with a large footstool , a sofa , and plenty of cushions , an easy-chair , and plenty of pillows , a piano , books , drawing materials , music , newspapers , and a few sketches and pictures .
A rap at the door startled him in this occupation .
' Do you know that person ' s name ? ' he inquired of the man in an audible voice ; pointing out <NAME> as he put the question .
He had made one step towards it , before he checked himself .
I am certain that you do n't forget by what a noble character , <NAME> .
She often moralized over her work on the tricks and the manners of that venerable cheat , but made her little purchases elsewhere , and lived a secluded life .
We ' re positively getting on , you know .
' And you see , as I was saying , <NAME> , ' remarked <NAME> aloud with the utmost coolness , as though there were no one within hearing by themselves : ' and you see , as I was saying -- undergoing grinding torments. ' It was not too strong a phrase for the occasion .
<NAME> would only say then , that he repelled the hon .
In this city there are houses of correction ( where the treadmills are , for women ) , the gates of which are very strong and heavy , and no doubt the keys too .
' Coolish ! ' observed <NAME> , stirring the fire .
If I were not dumb , you would be deaf .
<NAME> <NAME> had felt some apprehensions in consequence of the unusual absence of his two friends , which their mysterious behaviour during the whole morning had by no means tended to diminish .
Many and many a time had my fingers longed to tear him .
The child uttered a suppressed shriek on beholding this agreeable figure ; in their first surprise both she and the old man , not knowing what to say , and half doubting its reality , looked shrinkingly at it .
Fully persuaded , however , that <NAME> would not have solicited him to return unless there was some strong reason which required his presence at home , he resolved to go there , and hastened eastwards with all speed .
I walked through the streets ; and , once more seeing my old adversary the butcher -- now a constable , with his staff hanging up in the shop -- went down to look at the place where I had fought him ; and there meditated on <NAME> and the eldest Miss <NAME> , and all the idle loves and likings , and dislikings , of that time .
'Then you return my love ? '
So , whether he lives or dies , what does it come to ?
The moral sort of fellows might suppose that <NAME> derived some comfortable reflections afterwards , from this prompt retreat , as one of his few actions that made any amends for anything , and as a token to himself that he had escaped the climax of a very bad business .
This reminds me that I have not been able to do so , and that I sometimes almost despair of ever being able to do so .
He spoke of it more than once on the remainder of the way home , and more than once when they got home .
Mrs <NAME> had kept watch and ward over little <NAME> and his sister for nearly twelve months .
' And I do say , and will say , and must say , ' pursued his sister , pressing the foot of the wine-glass on <NAME> ' s hand , at each of the three clauses , ' that <NAME> has very prettily adapted the sentiment to the occasion .
But , somehow , it had all failed .
It was a house of dismal state , with a circular back to it , containing a whole suite of drawing-rooms looking upon a gravelled yard , where two gaunt trees , with blackened trunks and branches , rattled rather than rustled , their leaves were so smoked-dried .
It seemed , too , that <NAME> and <NAME> had gone out upon a visit in the neighbourhood , and would not return before night .
My wonder is , that you are not in earnest yourself , by this time , Agnes. ' <NAME> laughed again , and shook her head .
Her strength held out to enable her to arrange the letter in her breast , so as that it could be seen that she had a paper there .
That 's my view of such things , speaking as a child ! "
' You ' re quite a stranger ! ' ' Yes .
We were in the very same room into which I had brought my blushing girl when her youthful lover , now her so altered husband , was the choice of her young heart , the very same room from which my guardian and I had watched them going away through the sunlight in the fresh bloom of their hope and promise .
She hurriedly addresses these lines to her husband , seals , and leaves them on her table : If I am sought for , or accused of , his murder , believe that I am wholly innocent .
' Why , <NAME> ! ' she added with astonishment , seeing him first .
Bestowing something half-way between a smile and a frown upon his two companions , and again beckoning them to follow him , the man hastened across the apartment , which was of considerable extent , but low in the roof .
All regret will be unavailing , and deep and bitter it must be .
If you could make it convenient , <NAME> ' am , to pass the word presently for them children to come for ' ard , in a body , I should be glad to see ' em. ' These innocent <NAME> were so many daggers to the <NAME> ' s breast , when they appeared in a swarm , and tore at him with the confiding trustfulness he so little deserved .
We had all shaken hands cordially , and neither <NAME> 's eyes nor mine were quite dry , when I saw a four-oared galley shoot out from under the bank but a little way ahead of us , and row out into the same track .
In all these movements he was closely followed by the eyes of <NAME> , as if that young gentleman expected to see the thorn in action .
Rivers and seas were formed to float their ships ; rainbows gave them promise of fair weather ; winds blew for or against their enterprises ; stars and planets circled in their orbits , to preserve inviolate a system of which they were the centre .
' Then you ought to be able to afford it , <NAME> , ' said the judge , reddening ; for <NAME> ' s temper bordered on the irritable , and brooked not contradiction .

Mrs. Nickleby , knowing of her son ' s obligations to the honest Yorkshireman , had , after some demur , yielded her consent to <NAME> and Mrs. Browdie being invited out to tea ; in the way of which arrangement , there were at first sundry difficulties and obstacles , arising out of her not having had an opportunity of ' calling ' upon Mrs. <NAME> first ; for although Mrs. Nickleby very often observed with much complacency ( as most punctilious people do ) , that she had not an atom of pride or formality about her , still she was a great stickler for dignity and ceremonies ; and as it was manifest that , until a call had been made , she could not be ( politely speaking , and according to the laws of society ) even cognisant of the fact of Mrs. <NAME> ' s existence , she felt her situation to be one of peculiar delicacy and difficulty .

Some man fell in with a splash , and was pulled out again with a roar of laughter .
Now a person wouldn ' t think it , fur to see this little thing alongside a rough-weather chap like me , ' said <NAME> , looking round at both of us , with infinite pride ; ' but the sea ain ' t more salt in it than she has fondness in her for her uncle -- a foolish little Em ' ly !

Well , well -- then let us say I love thee dearly. ' ' Indeed , indeed you do , ' replied the child with great earnestness , ' Kit knows you do. ' Kit , who in despatching his bread and meat had been swallowing two-thirds of his knife at every mouthful with the coolness of a juggler , stopped short in his operations on being thus appealed to , and bawled ' Nobody isn ' t such a fool as to say he doosn ' t , ' after which he incapacitated himself for further conversation by taking a most prodigious sandwich at one bite .

After he had left me , I went out on pretence of walking in the garden where I sometimes walk , but really to follow him and make one last petition that he would not protract the dreadful suspense on which I have been racked by him , you do not know how long , but would mercifully strike next morning .
' We have been quarrelling here a little , Mr Rokesmith , but not more than we used ; you know our agreeable ways among ourselves .

As they hurried up to the coach , which was now in the open street and all ready for starting , <NAME> was not a little astonished to find himself suddenly clutched in a close and violent embrace , which nearly took him off his legs ; nor was his amazement at all lessened by hearing the voice of <NAME> exclaim , ' It is he -- my friend , my friend ! ' ' Bless my heart , ' cried <NAME> , struggling in the manager ' s arms , ' what are you about ? ' The manager made no reply , but strained him to his breast again , exclaiming as he did so , ' Farewell , my noble , my lion-hearted boy ! ' In fact , <NAME> , who could never lose any opportunity for professional display , had turned out for the express purpose of taking a public farewell of <NAME> ; and to render it the more imposing , he was now , to that young gentleman ' s most profound annoyance , inflicting upon him a rapid succession of stage embraces , which , as everybody knows , are performed by the embracer ' s laying his or her chin on the shoulder of the object of affection , and looking over it .
He stored my mind with its first treasures , and stamped his character upon them all .

She slept , for their better security , in the room where the wax-work figures were , and she never retired to this place at night but she tortured herself -- she could not help it -- with imagining a resemblance , in some one or other of their death-like faces , to the dwarf , and this fancy would sometimes so gain upon her that she would almost believe he had removed the figure and stood within the clothes .

There was no other question that I knew of in the world , and only <NAME> could give the answer to it .
He was not a coward : but these sounds ; what had gone before ; the strangeness of the place , which had confused him , even in his return from the hall ; the frustration of his schemes ( for , strange to say , he would have been much bolder , if they had succeeded ) ; the unseasonable time ; the recollection of having no one near to whom he could appeal for any friendly office ; above all , the sudden sense , which made even his heart beat like lead , that the man whose confidence he had outraged , and whom he had so treacherously deceived , was there to recognise and challenge him with his mask plucked off his face ; struck a panic through him .
' Of course I did , ' said my aunt , ' and was therefore easily silenced .
<NAME> ' t you know she has ?
It does as well as anything else , for a time .
The hot-water pipes that trail themselves all over the house , the cushioned doors and windows , and the screens and curtains fail to supply the fires ' deficiencies and to satisfy <NAME> 's need .
The old man was up , betimes , next morning , and waited impatiently for the appearance of his new associate , who after a delay that seemed interminable , at length presented himself , and commenced a voracious assault on the breakfast .
It was soon done , and the gate of the <NAME> ' <NAME> closed upon them .
How ' s that ? ' ' I supposed he had come home , ' Pleasant explained .
I knew very well that if he could have had the power of seeing me as I was , he would consider the poor girl tarnished by having for a moment been , although most innocently , the subject of my great and distinguished patronage .
The handsome lady -- so like , oh so like ! -- regarded me with a fixed look , and put her hand to her forehead .
The conversation was here interrupted by a moan from the sick woman .
" What do you come snivelling here for ? " " I did n't go to do it , <NAME> Wemmick. " " You did , " said <NAME> .
You ' re casting your eye round the shop , Mr Wegg .
' Wot ' s that for , <NAME> ? ' inquired <NAME> , directing <NAME> ' s attention to the target in question .
That she couldn ' t help it .
Have I a friend here ?
' You will wonder , perhaps , ' she said in a stronger tone , ' that I can better bear to be known to you whom I have wronged , than to the son of my enemy who wronged me. -- For she did wrong me !
" It is possible , <NAME> , that the gentleman to whom , for the reasons I have mentioned , I refrain from making further allusion -- it is possible , <NAME> , that that gentleman may have done me the honour so far to misapprehend my character as to induce you to believe that you would not have been received by my local establishment in <NAME> with that urbanity , that courtesy , which its members are instructed to show to all ladies and gentlemen who present themselves at that house .
And you mustn ' t , ' seating <NAME> beside her , and patting her hand , ' you mustn ' t feel a dislike to us to begin with , because we couldn ' t help it , you know , my dear. ' With the natural tendency of youth to yield to candour and sweet temper , <NAME> was so touched by the simplicity of this address that she frankly returned <NAME> ' s kiss .
Four hims and a her .
I was such a silly little creature !
I was a ' most as well as I was .
Mr <NAME> was resolved to show her that he was supreme .
But , as it is , I must never touch it , never ! ' She besought him , more pathetically and earnestly , with her little supplicatory hand , than she could have done in any words .
Mr Carker the <NAME> drew a chair close before the fire , and fell to beating the coals softly with the poker .
Now , I was unwilling to put the direction-card on there , lest any of my landlord ' s family should fathom what I was doing , and detain me ; so I said to the young man that I would be glad if he would stop for a minute , when he came to the dead-wall of the King ' s <NAME> prison .
And some were drowned so long ago , that their bleached arms start out from the middle of the current , and seem to try to grasp the boat , and drag it under water .
<NAME> will carry me upstairs before you go , and I won ' t come down again till you come back ; and you shall take Agnes a dreadfully scolding letter from me , because she has never been to see us ! ' We agreed , without any more consultation , that we would both go , and that <NAME> was a little Impostor , who feigned to be rather unwell , because she liked to be petted .
That man ' s your Father of the <NAME> ! ' Resigning herself to inevitable fate by making the best of those people , the <NAME> , and submitting her philosophy to the draught upon it , of which she had foreseen the likelihood in her interview with <NAME> , <NAME> handsomely resolved not to oppose her son ' s marriage .
You may wonder at my saying this so confidently with so little knowledge or experience , but I know it for a certainty from my own heart .
<NAME> <NAME> , otherwise as immovable as a pump or a lamp-post , puts his large right hand on the top of his bald head as if to defend it from a shower-bath and looks with great uneasiness at Mrs. Bagnet .
' Next , ' said <NAME> , blowing at his tea in his saucer , and looking over it at his confidential friend , ' comes the question , What ' s the course to be pursued ? ' On this head , <NAME> had much to say .
How you start ! " She did , indeed , start .
' I need look somewhat changed , ' he said , after a short silence ; ' for I have undergone some suffering , both of mind and body , since I left <NAME> .
Besides which , the walls were not thick , and , whenever he passed the evening at our house , we always knew of it by hearing one continual growl in the kitchen .
When the storm of dust had cleared away and the summer night was calm again , numbers of people choked up every avenue of access , and parties of diggers were formed to relieve one another in digging among the ruins .
While I had been away from home lately , <NAME> had called twice or thrice .
'They resided , ' said <NAME> , without seeming to hear the interruption , 'in a part of the country to which your father in his wandering had repaired , and where he had taken up his abode .
' If you wouldn ' t mind walking in , I ' ll find him directly. ' They walked in ; and <NAME> , having set two chairs for them , sped away with a quick light step .
Gentlemen , our friend <NAME> ( everybody looked at the individual in orange ) , our friend <NAME> has resigned. ' Universal astonishment fell upon the hearers .
In this same church , the pretty boy received all that will soon be left of him on earth -- a name .
There had been shrieks from among the women convicts ; but they had been stilled , and a hush had succeeded .
She hastily dressed herself in her bonnet and shawl : looking fearfully round , from time to time , as if , despite the sleeping draught , she expected every moment to feel the pressure of <NAME> 's heavy hand upon her shoulder ; then , stooping softly over the bed , she kissed the robber 's lips ; and then opening and closing the room-door with noiseless touch , hurried from the house .
' A curse upon you ! ' she said , looking round at me , with a mingled expression of rage and grief .
The eye of <NAME> , who had been his favourite , was insupportable to the <NAME> ; the voice of <NAME> , who was the picture of her mother , made a coward of him .
' I am sorry to say , <NAME> , I can ' t advance your object , ' said <NAME> , nervously .
And I ' ll tell you why , <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> seats himself upon another .
Making a desk of it , he stood there with his back to the old man , warming his knees , perusing the list at his leisure , and often returning to some lines of it , as though they were particularly interesting .
They seemed , however , to be more directly concerned than the others had been in the effective execution of the great principle of the office , as there was an awful inner apartment with a double door , in which the <NAME> appeared to be assembled in council , and out of which there was an imposing coming of papers , and into which there was an imposing going of papers , almost constantly ; wherein another gentleman , number four , was the active instrument .
The only article in which <NAME> dealt , that was not hard , was gingerbread .
<NAME> had known it , and seen it , without looking at her .
My <NAME> has been down at what she calls , in familiar conversation , her " place " in <NAME> .
The room smelt close and unwholesome ; the walls were dirt-discoloured ; and the ceiling blackened .
That ' s going according to the <NAME> , that is. ' ' Mr .
' You ' re thinking of a capital F perhaps ? ' said the <NAME> .
said I , pretending to consider .
The depravity of the human heart is such -- ' ' You will oblige me , ma ' am , ' interrupted <NAME> , ' by confining yourself to facts. ' Miss Murdstone cast down her eyes , shook her head as if protesting against this unseemly interruption , and with frowning dignity resumed : ' Since I am to confine myself to facts , I will state them as dryly as I can .
' Come here , sir ! ' said <NAME> , beckoning to me .
You ' ve got half the property , haven ' t you ? ' ' Yes , yes. ' ' Well then , don ' t you be cowed .
<NAME> ' en name , <NAME> sim ' lar to <NAME> which is my own .
I know what a multitude of things he has shut out for my sake , and how his anxious thoughts of me have shadowed his life , and weakened his strength and energy , by turning them always upon one idea .
It may be that if we knew more of such strange afflictions we might be the better able to alleviate their intensity .
<NAME> ' r is a lad as ' ll go through a deal o ' hard weather .
'Ai n't you afraid of it , sir ?
Ever forgiving and ever affable .
She could have stabbed him -- poisoned him safely .
Now you shall fasten it on yourself , for good luck , if you will , <NAME> . "
<NAME> was then proclaimed by the little man in the drab shorts , and <NAME> rose and said -- That , with the permission of his <NAME> brothers and sisters , then and there present , the secretary would read the report of the <NAME> committee ; a proposition which was again received with a demonstration of pocket-handkerchiefs .
To become a Guppy is the object of his ambition .
Would the lady object to my lighting the pair of candles on the chimneypiece , to throw a further light upon the subject ?
' Good evening , godmother ! ' said <NAME> .
' Have a bit. ' ' I couldn ' t eat a morsel , ' replied his wife .
You may not care to please yourself , and you may not care to please him , but you are not a free agent as to pleasing : you are forced to do that , in spite of yourself , my dear ; so it may be a question whether you may not as well please yourself too , if you can. ' Now , the very grossness of this flattery put <NAME> upon proving that she actually did please in spite of herself .
' <NAME> him about the <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
And I considered whether , if it should signify any one of these meanings , which was so very likely , could I quite answer for myself ?
'My Lord , my Lord , I know it would , ' said I to him , 'and it would have been far better for me never to have heard the name of your high office , but unhappily for me , I ca n't undo the past , and the past drives me here ! '
Remember them last races , Tommy. ' ' Will you never leave off aggravating a man ? ' said <NAME> .
It did look bad ; now didn ' t it ? ' ' It looked so bad , <NAME> , ' responded the old man , with gravity , ' that I will straightway tell you what an impression it wrought upon me .
I did n't know there had been any. " " Estella , " said I , " do look at that fellow in the corner yonder , who is looking over here at us. " " Why should I look at him ? " returned <NAME> , with her eyes on me instead .
" But how much would you tell him , <NAME> ? " " It is necessary to tell him very little .
' They wanted all the happiness to come together .
But that you have gathered already ?
The banquet was appointed for a Sunday , and <NAME> with her own hands stuffed a leg of mutton with oysters on the occasion , and sent it to the baker ' s -- not _the_ baker ' s but an opposition establishment .
After which , appears <NAME> ( whom <NAME> has seen twice in his lifetime ) , to thank <NAME> for counterfeiting the late <NAME> , broadly of <NAME> .
' His residence -- ' ' Is at present at the Angel at Bury. ' ' At <NAME> ? ' ' At <NAME> , not many miles from here .
' I speak to you for the sake of others .
' " What do you want here ? " roared <NAME> ; " I suppose you have come after my daughter , now ! " ' Old Lobbs merely said this as a sneer : for he did not believe that mortal presumption could have carried <NAME> so far .
He said to me , " <NAME> up to the top of the house , sir , and I ' ll show you a handsome girl .
I was sorting those things on the chest , and not thinking of the old man or the children , but singing to myself , when all in a moment I felt there was a face growing out of the dark. ' ' What face ? ' asked her husband , looking about him .
He shivered all the while so violently , that it was quite as much as he could do to keep the neck of the bottle between his teeth , without biting it off .
' It was a vain threat. ' We drove away , out of town , to the churchyard at <NAME> .
You will help me to see him if you can ? " " Your husband is not my business here , " returned <NAME> , looking down at her with perfect composure .
At this the two innocents , with their brains in that apparent danger , laughed , and <NAME> laughed , and the orphan laughed , and then the visitors laughed .
<NAME> faces , inexorable discipline , penance in this world and terror in the next -- nothing graceful or gentle anywhere , and the void in my cowed heart everywhere -- this was my childhood , if I may so misuse the word as to apply it to such a beginning of life. ' ' Really though ? ' said Mr Meagles , made very uncomfortable by the picture offered to his imagination .
So cold , so lonely , so dreary all !
The champion of <NAME> , <NAME> , and the <NAME> of <NAME> , who had bought them , rode in the same train ; and , every time we stopped , got down to see that they were safe .
I am not so unconscionable as to think it likely that you would accept me on trust at first sight , and take me out of the very street .
The continued kindness of her sister was this comfort to <NAME> .
They always praised the child , her sense and beauty , and he was proud to hear them !
' <NAME> and submissively , ' returned the tragedian , scowling upwards .
Slouching at his side with his eyes upon the towing-path , <NAME> held his left hand open , with a certain slight drawing action towards himself .
' Naturally , <NAME> , you know. ' ' Oh-h ! ' said <NAME> , with a severely unconvinced look .
" So much the easier what I have to say , and so much the easier for us to agree , " returned my guardian , his face irradiated by the gentleness and honour of his heart .
Confine yourself to yours , and ask me no question. ' ' By <NAME> , ma ' am ! ' he replied , making her another bow .
<NAME> <NAME> laughed a short laugh as she muttered , ' Yes , to be sure. ' ' And I require my audacious child , ' proceeded <NAME> , with a withering look at her youngest , on whom it had not the slightest effect , ' to please to be just to her sister <NAME> ; to remember that her sister <NAME> is much sought after ; and that when her sister <NAME> accepts an attention , she considers herself to be conferring qui-i-ite as much honour , ' -- this with an indignant shiver , -- ' as she receives. ' But , here <NAME> repudiated , and said quietly , ' I can speak for myself ; you know , ma .
' You must be aware , <NAME> , ' he added , looking restlessly in at the door again , ' if <NAME> objects -- ' ' Personally , he does not object , sir , ' said I .
I acquiesced , of course , knowing nothing to the contrary .
You don ' t know what my state of mind towards you is .
" Lift him , and come away ! " The door closed , and <NAME> was left alone .
It rushed away where it would , but it never , for an instant , lost itself in sleep .
All that I know is , your philosophy and your teaching will not save me .
' My master , sir , is a very artful man. ' ' I know he is , ' said <NAME> .
He seemed to have no strength , and he never once hit me hard , and he was always knocked down ; but he would be up again in a moment , sponging himself or drinking out of the water-bottle , with the greatest satisfaction in seconding himself according to form , and then came at me with an air and a show that made me believe he really was going to do for me at last .
'It must have been something , love , ' urged <NAME> .
<NAME> made no reply , but played a little quicker , as though the words had roused her from some painful thoughts .
Has a small crop out of his left ear. ' ' Ran away , a negro man , named <NAME> .
It was very soon after his interview with the Secretary , that he and <NAME> set out one leaden evening , not unnoticed by <NAME> , to have this desperate interview accomplished .
It was a Game called <NAME> and <NAME> , where <NAME> 's nephew had to think of something , and the rest must find out what ; he only answering to their questions yes or no , as the case was .
She would be deserted and reduced to ruin , and I should catch my death of cold in some broker ' s shop. " ' " Yes , but -- " ' " Don ' t interrupt me , " said the old gentleman .
' There ' s where she sits , you see , ' said <NAME> , when they were standing under the bank , roared and riven at by the wind .
Then was it not the sacred duty of the men of <NAME> , with forefathers before them , an admiring world in company with them , and a posterity to come after them , to hurl out traitors from the tents they had pitched in a sacred and a God-like cause ?
Whenever I fell into a thoughtful state , this subject was sure to present itself , and all my uneasiness was sure to be redoubled .
said he with his bright clear eyes on mine .
Your <NAME> ' s a <NAME> , child , if ever there was one , ' said <NAME> , drying both her eyes at once with great care on opposite corners of <NAME> ' s handkerchief ' He ' ll make an effort .
' You have much too open and generous a countenance for that. ' ' What an extraordinary observer you are ! ' said <NAME> .
I can not rest until I know that we are not too late .
says <NAME> , transferring his cross-examination .
' Of course you do , ' retorted the dwarf , viciously snapping at his words .
There had been an old copy of the <NAME> ' s Progress , with strange plates , upon a shelf at home , over which she had often pored whole evenings , wondering whether it was true in every word , and where those distant countries with the curious names might be .
It ' s his system. ' ' Formed his daughter on his own model ? ' suggested <NAME> .
But then , you see , you 're broad in proportion and do n't look it .
' Amen to that , ' replied <NAME> , ' and a fat and happy liven ' they ' d get out of it !
I began , by being singularly cheerful and light-hearted ; all sorts of half-forgotten things to talk about , came rushing into my mind , and made me hold forth in a most unwonted manner .
Apart from any inclinations of my own , I understood <NAME> 's hint now .
To this they very readily agreed , and the proposition was accordingly acted upon ; <NAME> and <NAME> betaking themselves to a sequestered pot- shop on the remotest confines of the <NAME> , behind the bar door of which their names had in other days very often appeared at the head of long and complex calculations worked in white chalk .
How can I meet the kindest friends that ever human creature had , with this dreadful charge upon me ! ' Mr <NAME> rejoined that it would have been well for the prisoner if he had thought of that before and was about to make some other gloomy observations when the voice of the single gentleman was heard , demanding from above-stairs what was the matter , and what was the cause of all that noise and hurry .
She closed the window again , and sitting down upon the bed , thought of the life that was before them .
<NAME> , and leaguing , and engaging to stand by one another. ' ' It is much to be regretted , ' said Mrs. Sparsit , making her nose more <NAME> and her eyebrows more <NAME> in the strength of her severity , ' that the united masters allow of any such class-combinations. ' ' Yes , ma ' am , ' said <NAME> .
It would be rather late in the day. ' ' Don ' t mind me , ' returned <NAME> ; ' but take care when his wife is by , you know. ' ' His wife ? ' said <NAME> .
To die is our heavy portion , but , oh , let us die with life about us ; when our cold hearts cease to beat , let warm hearts be beating near ; let our last look be upon the bounds which <NAME> has set to his own bright skies , and not on stone walls and bars of iron !
The Captain never lost dignity , from having his ears boxed with the <NAME> .
In this beautiful place : the fairest among the fair and lovely Highlands of the <NAME> : shut in by deep green heights and ruined forts , and looking down upon the distant town of <NAME> , along a glittering path of sunlit water , with here and there a skiff , whose white sail often bends on some new tack as sudden flaws of wind come down upon her from the gullies in the hills : hemmed in , besides , all round with memories of <NAME> , and events of the revolutionary war : is the Military <NAME> of <NAME> .
" Whew ! " the chemist whistled softly , as he read it .
' He was born here. ' We alighted ; and followed the plain coffin to a corner I remember well , where the service was read consigning it to the dust .
A very contentious gentleman , who said it was his mission to be everybody 's brother but who appeared to be on terms of coolness with the whole of his large family , completed the party .
' Very well , ' returned <NAME> ; ' but this is all very different indeed from anything of that sort , <NAME> , and I couldn ' t think of permitting it .
As if I were never to have done with <NAME> , I am reminded here of <NAME> and old <NAME> .
' Always at home. ' This would seem to be secretly agreeable to <NAME> , but he veils his feelings , and observes , ' Strange .
I am not speaking to you politely ; but , as you are aware , I am _not_ polite .
" And let me entreat you to consider that the clearing up of this mystery and the discovery of the real perpetrator of this deed may be of the last importance to others besides yourself . "
' She will try to do well , ' said little Em ' ly .
<NAME> , was that you calling me ?
' -- that I will make no pretence of concealment .
' I have stated the case , as such cases are usually stated among practical minds ; I have stated it , as the case of your mother and myself was stated in its time .
You shall carry a letter to <NAME> from me , <NAME> , and you must both of you be more hopeful of me and not believe that I am quite cast away just yet , my dear . "
He thought about it for a little while with a highly agreeable and whimsical expression of face , then quite gave it up and said in his most engaging manner , " You know what a child I am .
' But I doubt if he could tell many people even their past or present fortunes. ' ' Couldn ' t have told the <NAME> hers ? ' said <NAME> .
I could hardly make them quarrel with me .
The second , that her brother had not made an effort .
said the undertaker : raising the candle above his head , to get a better view of <NAME> .
' You will come to this marriage with me , <NAME> dear ? ' ' N -- no , my love ; I can ' t do that. ' ' You can ' t do that , <NAME> ? ' ' <NAME> , my dear , it ' s quite out of the question .
' I have lived in the world for nigh sixty year , and I ought to know what it is. ' ' You OUGHT to know , certainly , ' thought <NAME> ; ' but whether you do or not , is another question. ' ' If a bachelor happens to have saved a little matter of money , ' said Mr Lillyvick , ' his sisters and brothers , and nephews and nieces , look TO that money , and not to him ; even if , by being a public character , he is the head of the family , or , as it may be , the main from which all the other little branches are turned on , they still wish him dead all the while , and get low-spirited every time they see him looking in good health , because they want to come into his little property .
It being <NAME> ' s regular occupation when they were alone of an evening to brush out and smooth the long fair hair of the dolls ' dressmaker , she unfastened a ribbon that kept it back while the little creature was at her work , and it fell in a beautiful shower over the poor shoulders that were much in need of such adorning rain .
But there was no confusion or disorder .
' He and she ? ' ' What , Mr and <NAME> ? ' said <NAME> .
Very few loose papers are about .
On the next day , fresh search was made , and the inquiries renewed ; but with no better success .
<NAME> <NAME> ' s first procedure was to shake Mrs. Sparsit off , and leave her to progress as she might through various stages of suffering on the floor .
' I will , however , ' continued <NAME> , drying her eyes , and speaking with great indignation , ' say before you , and before everybody here , for the first time , and once for all , that I never will supply that man ' s extravagances and viciousness again .
because he suffered her to lead him .
The ironmaster repeats her expression with a little emphasis .
I have not seen my mother this long time , and it lies upon my conscience , for it ' s something to be loved as she loves her prodigal son. -- -Bah !
He swallowed a glassful and took up the paper again .
They would have scorned the action .
The advice I received in most quarters when I began to yield to my desire of travelling towards that point of the compass was , according to custom , sufficiently cheerless : my companion being threatened with more perils , dangers , and discomforts , than I can remember or would catalogue if I could ; but of which it will be sufficient to remark that blowings-up in steamboats and breakings-down in coaches were among the least .
' Speak out , Sam. ' ' ' Cause , ' rejoined <NAME> -- ' ' cause I ' ve got a little bisness as I want to do. ' ' What business ? ' inquired <NAME> , surprised at <NAME> ' s confused manner .
Those fleet messengers require the <NAME> to see that their hats are deposited where they can be laid hold of at an instant ' s notice ; and they dine ( remarkably well though ) with the air of firemen in charge of an engine , expecting intelligence of some tremendous conflagration .
' This will soon be over now , dear Mr Clennam .
" Oh , <NAME> ! " says the distressed lady ; " would that I could shake off these painful thoughts. " -- " <NAME> , ma ' am , try , " says the faithful servant ; " rouse yourself , ma ' am ; be amused. " -- " I will , " says the lady , " I will learn to suffer with fortitude .
To be sure , how the neighbourhood poured into court that afternoon while the cause was on !
It was a busy day ; and night came on , and found them wondering that there was yet so much to do , and that it should be dark so soon .
Another knock , and still no answer .
The walls were ornamented with the choicest specimens of <NAME> paper , enriched with a gilded cornice of elegant design .
Allow me to catch you round the neck .
This position I continued to occupy during the whole interview , and from it I now saw <NAME> and <NAME> enter the room .
The schoolmeasther agin all <NAME> .
The bed-chamber to which my wife and I were shown , was a large , low , ghostly room ; with a quantity of withered branches on the hearth , and two doors without any fastening , opposite to each other , both opening on the black night and wild country , and so contrived , that one of them always blew the other open : a novelty in domestic architecture , which I do not remember to have seen before , and which I was somewhat disconcerted to have forced on my attention after getting into bed , as I had a considerable sum in gold for our travelling expenses , in my dressing-case .
It was not exactly a hairdresser ' s ; that is to say , people of a coarse and vulgar turn of mind might have called it a barber ' s ; for they not only cut and curled ladies elegantly , and children carefully , but shaved gentlemen easily .
I knew his voice very well .
But <NAME> said she was , and she said it decisively .
Nod away at him , <NAME> ; that 's what he likes .
" My own doing , " said <NAME> .
Wipe your eyes with the cuffs of your jacket , and do n't cry into your gruel ; that 's a very foolish action , <NAME> . '
You can come at night .
It was unnecessary caution surely , and might have defeated itself .
The deficient buttons on his plaid frock had evidently been supplied from one of <NAME> 's coats , they were so extremely brazen and so much too large .
If I did not feel this , and know , besides , that a changed behaviour in one she loved would break her heart , I should not feel my task so difficult of performance , or have to encounter so many struggles in my own bosom , when I take what seems to me to be the strict line of duty . '
<NAME> C. desires to be near his professional adviser , and I am far from objecting , for I court inquiry . "
<NAME> 's vigorous plunges against the bit of timber in question , rendered this occurance highly probable .
' What will you do ? ' she asked him .
But all is over with me on earth , and this must be an Angel .
All is for her sake .
He found a pleasure in setting up <NAME> as the type of elegance , and making him a satire upon others who piqued themselves on personal graces .
And <NAME> , " said <NAME> , " and his wild brother , <NAME> ; there they go !
I know my cue ; smart is the word .
A few faces hurried to glowing windows and looked after us , but none came out .
I do n't suppose there 's a move on the board that would surprise <NAME> , and as to this or that move having taken place , why my knowing it is no odds at all , any possible move whatever ( provided it 's in a wrong direction ) being a probable move according to my experience .
He has no idea of the value of money .
The simple circumstance of being left alone with her husband and <NAME> , was sufficient to stun this admirable lady again without collision between herself and any other fact .
' That done my Em ' ly good , ' he resumed , after such emotion as I could not behold without sharing in ; and as to my aunt , she wept with all her heart ; ' that done <NAME> ' ly good , and she begun to mend .
I thought he said as much ? ' ' The chances are very small , young lady—next to nothing—for a man who gets a bad name among them. ' ' What shall I understand that you mean by a bad name ? ' ' The name of being troublesome. ' ' Then , by the prejudices of his own class , and by the prejudices of the other , he is sacrificed alike ?
We never make company of you .
There , he left his Principal alone ; to wonder , as he rode away , how many thousand Plornishes there might be within a day or two ' s journey of the <NAME> Office , playing sundry curious variations on the same tune , which were not known by ear in that glorious institution .
Wonderful ! " " It 's a terrible thing , <NAME> ; it ai n't true. " " What are you telling of , <NAME> ? " cried <NAME> , falling back in the greatest amazement .
But , on hearing from my aunt that I should sometimes come over on a Saturday , and that he could sometimes come and see me on a Wednesday , he revived ; and vowed to make another kite for those occasions , of proportions greatly surpassing the present one .
In the miserable night he thought of it ; in the dreary day , the wretched dawn , the ghostly , memory-haunted twilight .
The worst class of sum worked in the every-day world is cyphered by the diseased arithmeticians who are always in the rule of Subtraction as to the merits and successes of others , and never in <NAME> as to their own .
' The usual thing ! ' observed <NAME> .
At nineteen , his hand had inscribed in chalk on that part of the wall which fronted her lodgings , on the occasion of her birthday , ' Welcome sweet nursling of the Fairies ! ' At twenty-three , the same hand falteringly presented cigars on Sundays to the Father of the <NAME> , and Father of the queen of his soul .
' A boy that can knock my door down , ' said <NAME> , contemptuously , ' can get over that , I should hope ! ' But <NAME> , taking this as a permission to enter , and getting over it , <NAME> immediately demanded whether an Englishwoman ' s house was her castle or not ; and whether she was to be broke in upon by ' raff. ' On these subjects her thirst for information was still very importunate , when <NAME> , having made his way up the little staircase through an artificial fog occasioned by the washing , which covered the banisters with a clammy perspiration , entered <NAME> ' s room , and found that gentleman in ambush behind the door .
Very good. ' ' And I do declare , ' cried <NAME> , with honest enthusiasm , ' that in this effort I am influenced by no selfish or personal considerations , but by pity for her , and detestation and abhorrence of this scheme ; and that I would do the same , were there twenty rivals in the field , and I the last and least favoured of them all. ' ' You would , I believe , ' said <NAME> .
' You won ' t run so gaily to your old shabby home , my girl .
But he was sleeping soundly , and she softly withdrew .
'What the devil made you stand lingering there , in the wet ? '
' I hope they may become so , ' replied <NAME> .
He made quite a sister of me .
This wretched life , my love , of daily labour and fatigue , is more than you can bear , I am sure it is .
I hope , <NAME> , ' he continued , after a few moments , during which , in his increasing haughtiness , he had improved on his idea , ' I may not find it necessary ever to entrust Mr Carker with any message of objection or remonstrance to you ; but as it would be derogatory to my position and reputation to be frequently holding trivial disputes with a lady upon whom I have conferred the highest distinction that it is in my power to bestow , I shall not scruple to avail myself of his services if I see occasion. ' ' And now , ' he thought , rising in his moral magnificence , and rising a stiffer and more impenetrable man than ever , ' she knows me and my resolution. ' The hand that had so pressed the bracelet was laid heavily upon her breast , but she looked at him still , with an unaltered face , and said in a low voice : ' Wait !
<NAME> farewells were exchanged , and the party separated .
' Mum , sir , even here -- my meaning , sir , exactly. ' ' YOUR meaning exactly , you brazen scarecrow , -- what ' s your meaning ? ' retorted <NAME> .
I had often passed it before , during my residence in that neighbourhood , though never when I could choose another road .
It was very extraordinary that she should come , under such circumstances. ' Not feeling quite so sure of that , <NAME> thought it best to hold his peace .
" -- At the back , there 's a pig , and there are fowls and rabbits ; then , I knock together my own little frame , you see , and grow cucumbers ; and you 'll judge at supper what sort of a salad I can raise .
I have often thought , since , what an odd , innocent , out-of-the-way kind of wedding it must have been !
' The natural curiosity which forms the sole ornament of my professional museum , ' he resumes , ' hereupon desires his Secretary -- an individual of the hermit-crab or oyster species , and whose name , I think , is <NAME> -- but it doesn ' t in the least matter -- say <NAME> -- to put himself in communication with <NAME> .
It was a chill dark autumn evening , and <NAME> had ordered a fire to be kindled in the little back parlour , now more than ever like the cabin of a ship .
The lady happened to bend forward at the same time , and my uncle thought she looked more beautiful than she had done yet .
However , as he was plainly determined to be angry with her if she so much as asked him how he was , she only ventured to kiss his cheek , before accompanying him to Mrs Merdle ' s with an anxious heart .
<NAME> <NAME> , indeed , wildly cried out , " No ! " with the feeble malice of a tired man ; but , as he had no theory , and no coat on , he was unanimously set at naught , -- not to mention his smoking hard behind , as he stood with his back to the kitchen fire to draw the damp out : which was not calculated to inspire confidence .
And now the question is , ' proceeded <NAME> , with the greatest reluctance , ' will you have another egg ? ' ' No , I won ' t , ' said <NAME> , shortly .
The draggling ends of a bright-red neckerchief were then disclosed , and he had even been at the pains of dipping parts of it in some liquid , to give it the appearance of having become stained by wear .
It would be a wonder if I did not , being by the <NAME> ' en name of <NAME> , which took it arter my own father , which took it from his own father , though which of our fam ' ly fust took it nat ' ral I will not in any ways mislead you by undertakin ' to say .
" It would be useless self-distress and torment to reckon up such chances and possibilities .
You know what I mean as well as any man . "
without getting to the second , now burst forward , drew the ruler from his breast ( apparently as a defensive weapon ) , and produced from his pocket a foolscap document , folded in the form of a large letter .
' I had hoped it might not be so bad , ' he said : ' but I had feared a heavy loss there , knowing the connection between her husband and the defaulter. ' ' Yes .
Really , constable , you know , " says <NAME> wistfully , and coughing behind his hand his cough of great perplexity and doubt , " really , that does seem a question .
It happened on one occasion , when he was doing me the honour of talking to me in the playground , that I hazarded the observation that something or somebody -- I forget what now -- was like something or somebody in <NAME> .
He then gravely repaired to another table , where his sister sat herself at her desk .
I am sure you would ! ' said <NAME> .
" It was a great change from <NAME> Swosser to Professor Dingo , " she resumed with a plaintive smile .
There is a tie of many suffering years between us two , and it is the only tie I ever had on earth that <NAME> has not broken ! "
How trifling all that had been occupying his time and thoughts for many weeks seemed to him during that sleepless night , and how constantly and incessantly present to his imagination was the one idea that <NAME> in the midst of some great trouble and distress might even then be looking -- and vainly too -- for him !
' Now , <NAME> , ' says the Major , ' I am a man of the world .
Why was it so worrying to me to have her in our house , and confidential to me every night , when I yet felt that it was better and safer somehow that she should be there than anywhere else ?
After looking at the surrounding objects for assurance that he was not in an odd dream , and after pacing a little while before the house , <NAME> knocked at the door .
' Have you anything to tell me ? ' ' To tell you , lady lass ! ' replied the <NAME> , meeting her eyes in confusion .
' Well , and how are you my buck ? ' said Mr Chuckster , taking a stool .
<NAME> <NAME> , however , was announced as a lesser star , yet visible above the office horizon .
I lost everything , and had a sharp struggle for my life , weak as I was. ' ' Did you get the parties punished ? ' asked <NAME> .
<NAME> was there , and in full force .
I was about to observe that I again behold the serene spot where some of the happiest hours of my existence fleeted by. ' ' Made so , I am sure , by Mrs. Micawber , ' said I .
And he further sees at that board ( this he announces with pomp , as if exulting in the powers of an extraordinary telescope ) his friend Mr Fledgeby , if he will permit him to call him so .
' Ho ! ' Horses plunge , and splash the black driver .
How she got it out , in her muffled state , <NAME> knows ; but she got it out somehow -- there it was -- and slipped it through the Secretary ' s .
Also , the spoon is not generally used over-hand , but under .
I turned at the door , and he was still looking hard at me , while the two vile casts on the shelf seemed to be trying to get their eyelids open , and to force out of their swollen throats , " O , what a man he is ! " <NAME> was out , and though he had been at his desk he could have done nothing for me .
<NAME> money ! ' <NAME> picked the bill up , looked at the total with a bloodshot eye , took a small canvas bag from his pocket , and told the amount into his hand .
Then <NAME> began to wish they had not been quite so nimble ; for the travelling-carriage which had been hired for the occasion was not to arrive until nine o ' clock , and there was nothing but breakfast to fill up the intervening blank of one hour and a half .
Nor did the appearance of this unexpected visitor occasion the least embarrassment , ( save in <NAME> , and that only to the extent of a blush or two at first , ) for the old gentleman was so kind and cordial , and the young gentleman imitated him in this respect so well , that the usual stiffness and formality of a first meeting showed no signs of appearing , and <NAME> really more than once detected herself in the very act of wondering when it was going to begin .
I have told her so .
Speak. ' ' Why , if you will have it , miss , it ' s this , ' said the servant girl .
The man saw that the recognition was mutual , and beckoning to <NAME> to take his former place under the tree , and not to stand in the falling rain , of which , in his first surprise , he had been quite regardless , addressed him in a hoarse , faint tone .
He is going towards the door with a candle in his hand when a knock comes .
The quarters of our soldiers at <NAME> , are finely and airily situated .
You have been dreaming. ' ' My dear brother : ' she laid her head down on his pillow , and her hair flowed over him as if she would hide him from every one but herself : ' is there nothing that you have to tell me ?
'Pop that shawl away in my castor , <NAME> , so that I may know where to find it when I cut ; that 's the time of day !
But never mind that at prethent. ' There was another silence ; and then she exclaimed , sobbing with her hands before her face , ' Oh , give me my clothes , give me my clothes , and let me go away before I break my heart ! ' The women sadly bestirred themselves to get the clothes together—it was soon done , for they were not many—and to pack them in a basket which had often travelled with them .
I should wish to hear what accusation <NAME> can make ! ' ' Surely you must know , <NAME> , ' observed Mr Dombey , ' that I don ' t question your natural devotion to , and regard for , the future head of my house. ' ' I am glad to hear it , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> ; ' but really you are very odd , and sometimes talk very strangely , though without meaning it , I know .
And <NAME> , M.P. , how are things going on down at the house , and when will you turn out those terrible people for us ?
' This , at least , is the light , my dear <NAME> , ' pursued Mrs. Micawber , ' in which I view the subject .
What <NAME> calls ' society ' , I see ; among it <NAME> , from his <NAME> , sneering at the hand that gave it him , and speaking to me of the Doctor as ' so charmingly antique ' .
Mr Dombey , in the plenitude of his power , asked me -- I had it from his own lips yesterday morning -- to be his go-between to you , because he knows I am not agreeable to you , and because he intends that I shall be a punishment for your contumacy ; and besides that , because he really does consider , that I , his paid servant , am an ambassador whom it is derogatory to the dignity -- not of the lady to whom I have the happiness of speaking ; she has no existence in his mind -- but of his wife , a part of himself , to receive .
I will hear no more of the very genteel lady ; I will hear no more of you .
No , but she knew where the school was .
It ain ' t because I don ' t love you .
saw again , which has long been engraven on my heart .
' We have no Faith in the dear old Barons , who were the most delightful creatures -- or in the dear old Priests , who were the most warlike of men -- or even in the days of that inestimable Queen Bess , upon the wall there , which were so extremely golden .
At last I find it .
She took the place of eldest of the three , in all things but precedence ; was the head of the fallen family ; and bore , in her own heart , its anxieties and shames .
' Never in my life , ' replied the cobbler .
I owe so much to him .
And now I can breathe again at last ! ' <NAME> darted in from behind the door , caught <NAME> by both hands , and said the rest for himself .
He soon fell into a gentle doze , from which he was awakened by the light of a candle : which , being brought near the bed , showed him a gentleman with a very large and loud-ticking gold watch in his hand , who felt his pulse , and said he was a great deal better .
Has a scar on her cheek , and the end of one of her toes cut off. ' ' Ran away , my Mulatto woman , <NAME> .
" She says many hard things of you , but you say nothing of her .
The greater the accumulation of deceit and trouble in the world , the brighter and the purer shone the star of <NAME> high above the world .
At the garden-gate of one of these he stopped , and <NAME> alighted .
<NAME> <NAME> resigned his cup without another word ; squeezed Mrs. <NAME> 's little finger as she took it ; and inflicting two open-handed slaps upon his laced waistcoat , gave a mighty sigh , and hitched his chair a very little morsel farther from the fire .
" You 're a friend in need .
think of all I have given up , only this one night , for you .
Where ' s your more than mother ?
We sat in the dark for some time , breathless .
Who knows that better than I do ? ' ' Nothing will turn me from it , <NAME> , when I have justified it to myself .
' The fact is , ' began <NAME> , with a mouth so dry that he had some difficulty in articulating his words : the consciousness of which rendered his manner still more ungainly and undecided ; ' the truth is , that <NAME> , having no secrets from me ( to the best of my belief ) , has confided the whole of this matter to me. ' He came to a stop , and <NAME> asked : ' what matter , sir ? ' ' I thought , ' returned the schoolmaster , stealing another look at her , and seeming to try in vain to sustain it ; for the look dropped as it lighted on her eyes , ' that it might be so superfluous as to be almost impertinent , to enter upon a definition of it .
And how shows this recreant conduct in a man on whom unequal laws are known to have fallen heavy ?
Without entering into further explanations , I may repeat that the idol is down .
It was pleasant to observe that Mrs. Wemmick no longer unwound <NAME> 's arm when it adapted itself to her figure , but sat in a high-backed chair against the wall , like a violoncello in its case , and submitted to be embraced as that melodious instrument might have done .
' I shall leave this here room , sir , just precisely at the wery same moment as you leaves it , ' responded <NAME> , speaking in a forcible manner , and seating himself with perfect gravity .
<NAME> ' t ask how ; -- we may regain it , and a great deal more ; -- but tell nobody , or trouble may come of it .
' Do you recollect anything particular happening on the morning when you were first engaged by the defendant ; eh , <NAME> ? ' said <NAME> .
' You are very kind , ' said <NAME> , ' I shall be delighted to know them .
It was about the last place in the world in which we had any business or reason to be , but a sudden fog , and some error on the pilot ' s part , were the cause .
I must clear my unfortunate partner ' s reputation .
I ha ' seen an ' spok ' n wi ' yor son , one night .
The sea had ebbed and flowed , through a whole year .
And now the rest of the company , highly excited and interested , always excepting <NAME> , who had not the slightest idea that anything was going on , formed in one group round the fire in the next drawing-room , and pretended to be chatting easily on the infinite variety of small topics , while everybody ' s thoughts and eyes were secretly straying towards the secluded pair .
' Why , will it never stop , <NAME> ? ' he would sometimes ask her .
' And really , ' added <NAME> , after half an hour ' s walking had brought them to the village , ' really , for a misanthrope ' s choice , this is one of the prettiest and most desirable places of residence I ever met with. ' In this opinion also , both <NAME> and <NAME> expressed their concurrence ; and having been directed to the <NAME> , a clean and commodious village ale-house , the three travellers entered , and at once inquired for a gentleman of the name of <NAME> .
' I have noticed , ' said he ; ' —my name is Tartar. ' <NAME> inclined his head .
Does the thought-contracted brow of the local Sage or the lustrous eye of local Beauty inquire whose fortunes ?
Shall I tell them to go away ? ' ' No , ' said <NAME> , rising .
I have never been in the way of learning compliments myself , and I don ' t profess to understand the art of paying ' em .
' You can easily have been kept away by business , and must not return till nearly midnight. ' ' Then he will come straight here , ' retorted <NAME> .
Show what clothes you have brought , and what money , and say that I will send some more money .
<NAME> <NAME> Jasper. ' ' Has he a calling , good gentleman ? ' ' Calling ?
But if you , being so full of learning , <NAME> ' r <NAME> , could think of anything to say as might bring her to believe I wasn ' t greatly hurt : still loving of her , and mourning for her : anything as might bring her to believe as I was not tired of my life , and yet was hoping fur to see her without blame , wheer the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest -- anything as would ease her sorrowful mind , and yet not make her think as I could ever marry , or as ' twas possible that anyone could ever be to me what she was -- I should ask of you to say that -- with my prayers for her -- that was so dear. ' I pressed his manly hand again , and told him I would charge myself to do this as well as I could .
The sound was too much for Mr Mantalini .
" I tell you , " said <NAME> , " that you buried paving-stones and earth in that there coffin .
' This is a pollis case , is it ?
You can go. ' <NAME> passed out at the door , and was about to close it after him , when , hearing the voices of the brothers again , and also the mention of his own name , he stood irresolutely , with his hand upon the lock , and the door ajar , uncertain whether to return or go away .
It gave you the face-ache to look at his apples , the stomach-ache to look at his oranges , the tooth-ache to look at his nuts .
For who else would dig , and delve , and drudge , and do domestic work , and make canals and roads , and execute great lines of <NAME> !
No attempt at defiance being made , however , her face gradually relaxed , and became so pleasant , that I was emboldened to kiss and thank her ; which I did with great heartiness , and with both my arms clasped round her neck .
Beyond a general impression of the distance before me , and of the young man with the donkey-cart having used me cruelly , I think I had no very urgent sense of my difficulties when I once again set off with my ninepence in my pocket .
" Oh , <NAME> , you would never guess ! "
It ' s no use my lagging on so far behind it .
Who ' ll be made the fool of there , I wonder , to begin with -- eh , <NAME> ? ' Mrs. Sliderskew appeared to approve highly of this ingenious scheme , and expressed her satisfaction by various rackings and twitchings of her head and body , which by no means enhanced her charms .
To which Mrs <NAME> added , taking thought for him , like the championing little wife she was ; ' Oh yes , detained at the last moment .
and Mrs. Crummles ! ' or saw a little boy run back to stare them in the face , the severe expression of their countenances relaxed , for they felt it was popularity .
To whom <NAME> made his obeisance , closing the door and standing near it , with his hat in his hand .
My uncle woke , rubbed his eyes , and jumped up in astonishment .
I should rather think I did .
" Indeed I am , my Lady .
But <NAME> 's thoughts , like those of most other people , although they were extremely ready and active to point out his difficulties , were wholly at a loss to suggest any feasible mode of surmounting them ; so , after a good deal of thinking to no particular purpose , he changed his little bundle over to the other shoulder , and trudged on .
After some helpless casting about , <NAME> brightened and began again : -- " He is dressed like a 'spectable pieman .
How CAN you ask such goose ' s questions ? ' ' Do you regret anything , my love ? ' ' <NAME> anything ?
<NAME> haste down , and come out .
We began badly , and went on worse .
I took the indentures out of his hand and gave them to <NAME> .
I went forth last night on compulsion , and I learnt a lesson which is working now .
The <NAME> sat in his study chair , covering his face with his hands .
We proceeded without a word being spoken .
<NAME> <NAME> , seizing the boy by one leg and one arm ( fortunately not the broken limb ) lugged him straight into the hall , and deposited him at full length on the floor thereof .
I never see such a chap to eat and drink -- never .
" Yes , there ! " " Where is he ? " He crammed what little food was left , into the breast of his gray jacket .
' Well then , ' replied <NAME> , ' I ' m satisfied .
First , the lonely boar-spears and knives of the chase had been reddened as of old ; then , had gleamed trenchant in the morning sunshine ; now , doors and windows were thrown open , horses in their stables looked round over their shoulders at the light and freshness pouring in at doorways , leaves sparkled and rustled at iron-grated windows , dogs pulled hard at their chains , and reared impatient to be loosed .
He was dressed in a smartly-cut snuff-coloured coat , with large brass buttons ; an orange neckerchief ; a coarse , staring , shawl-pattern waistcoat ; and drab breeches .
' By <NAME> , you are right , <NAME> .
Will you mind it , if I say something very , very silly ? -- -more than usual ? ' inquired <NAME> , peeping over my shoulder into my face .
" When she went from here , she went right away nor'ard by the high road .
<NAME> blood , hot blood. ' And the little man took a warning pinch , and shook his head doubtfully .
The girl drew closer to the table , and made no offer to leave the room , although she could see that <NAME> was pointing to her .
' I would rather not ask , but the question is imposed upon me .
The topic is fraught with such danger to the bonnet , that <NAME> gives another little scream , and begs me to understand that Dora is only to be looked at , and on no account to be touched .
I put such questions to <NAME> as , When did the man come in ?
All men are not gifted alike .
' No , indeed , ' returned his daughter .
' Who is it ? ' asked <NAME> .
' Post-mark , <NAME> , black wax , black border , woman ' s hand , C. N. in the corner. ' ' Black wax ? ' said <NAME> , glancing at the letter .
<NAME> <NAME> looked serious instantly .
<NAME> will be a ugly customer to you , if you do n't .
Mr friend Mr Bounderby could never see any difference between leaving the <NAME> ' hands ' exactly as they were , and requiring them to be fed with turtle soup and venison out of gold spoons .
That 's all I know , ' said <NAME> .
' -- K. then positively refused to sign .
<NAME> says the cat , <NAME> quack says the duck , and Bow-wow-wow says the dog. " I couldn ' t tell you how it come into my head or where from , but it had so much the sound of a rasper that I own to you it astonished myself .
' For <NAME> ' s sake , <NAME> , ' whispered <NAME> , as she opened the door for him in the dark hall , and he groped his way to the sight of the night-sky , ' what is going on here ? ' Her own appearance was sufficiently ghastly , standing in the dark with her apron thrown over her head , and speaking behind it in a low , deadened voice .
' No , sir , ' said Mr Meagles , shaking his head ruefully .
No ; sight more unwonted still -- there is a butterfly in the square -- a real , live butterfly !
If not today , why then tomorrow. ' ' And <NAME> ? ' said <NAME> and I , both together .
It was not that he looked many years older , though still dressed with the old scrupulous cleanliness ; or that there was an unwholesome ruddiness upon his face ; or that his eyes were full and bloodshot ; or that there was a nervous trembling in his hand , the cause of which I knew , and had for some years seen at work .
' <NAME> aware , <NAME> , I am sure , ' said <NAME> , ' that to propose an adjournment to any place to one so far removed by fortune and so courted and caressed by the best society must ever appear intruding even if not a pie-shop far below your present sphere and a back-parlour though a civil man but if for the sake of <NAME> -- can not overcome it more improper now than ever late Doyce and <NAME> -- one last remark I might wish to make one last explanation I might wish to offer perhaps your good nature might excuse under pretence of three kidney ones the humble place of conversation. ' Rightly interpreting this rather obscure speech , <NAME> returned that she was quite at <NAME> ' s disposition .
With <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , Precedent , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> ! "
' And yet you took it very much to heart , ' said <NAME> .
" It is fifty years old . "
" Is who dead , dear boy ? " " Compeyson. " " He hopes I am , if he 's alive , you may be sure , " with a fierce look .
We found <NAME> trying to warm herself at the fire in the writing-room , which <NAME> was then lighting with a smutty parlour candlestick , throwing the candle in to make it burn better .
He has taken the matter so much to heart that he has remonstrated ( in my presence he remonstrated ) with Mr <NAME> , if that be the name .
'No , ' replied <NAME> ; 'at least , as it 's a nasty business , we think you ought to take something less than the premium we offered . '
You ought to see it out , and I won ' t leave you .
<NAME> <NAME> alone could enter into my feelings thoroughly .
<NAME> ! ' exclaimed the old lady , starting .
If , as he folds the handkerchief and carefully puts it up , it were able with an enchanted power to bring before him the place where she found it and the night-landscape near the cottage where it covered the little child , would he descry her there ?
Both houses are handsomely carpeted ; but the state to which these carpets are reduced by the universal disregard of the spittoon with which every honourable member is accommodated , and the extraordinary improvements on the pattern which are squirted and dabbled upon it in every direction , do not admit of being described .
When I looked round , I could see the other lights coming in after us .
When you told me your own story , you told me plainly that you began adoring her the first time you saw her , when you were very young indeed. " " Very well , then , " said I , to whom this was a new and not unwelcome light , " I have never left off adoring her .
It was -- what lasting reason have I to remember it ! -- a cold , harsh , winter day .
It shall and must be spoken .
' Ah ! ' replied <NAME> , with another groan ; this time not even disguised by a wheeze .
' This fellow , ' said Mr Carker to <NAME> , giving him a gentle shake , ' is your son , eh , <NAME> ' am ? ' ' Yes , <NAME> , ' sobbed <NAME> , with a curtsey ; ' yes , Sir. ' ' A bad son , I am afraid ? ' said Mr Carker .
she said on a sudden .
The Secretary lost no time in getting to work , and his vigilance and method soon set their mark on the <NAME> ' s affairs .
It would be a poor thing to gratify a prejudice against him .
' Before I knew what to do , or whether I could do anything , there was a second conversation between the same two brothers , in which their sister was mentioned .
When we stood still , he got opposite to him , and drawing his hand across and across his open mouth with a curious expression of a sense of power , and turning up his eyes , and lowering his grey eyebrows until they appeared to be shut , seemed to scan every lineament of his face .
Defer this marriage for a week .
I would transact your business with people in your pay or employment .
' Ay , I know that , ' was the reply ; ' but I have been very anxious to be at my journey ' s end , and that makes the way seem long. ' ' Well , ' remarked the coachman , ' if the way seemed long with such cattle as you ' ve sat behind , you MUST have been most uncommon anxious ; ' and so saying , he let out his whip-lash and touched up a little boy on the calves of his legs by way of emphasis .
I reply , 'My growling friend , I DO N'T defend them , but they are very agreeable to me .
<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> had made all ready for the journey , and had brought with them , besides travelling cloaks and wrappers , bread and meat , wine , and hot coffee .
<NAME> , more agitated , paced her room ; and paced the gallery outside ; and looked out at the night , blurred and wavy with the raindrops on the glass , and the tears in her own eyes ; and looked up at the hurry in the sky , so different from the repose below , and yet so tranquil and solitary .
' And what is your name , my pale child ? ' said <NAME> .
Would Mr Abel part with me , <NAME> , or is there anybody that could be fonder of the garden , ma ' am ?
' Pray , go on , sir -- disgraceful and rascally proceedings , I think you said ? ' ' I did , ' said <NAME> , thoroughly roused .
' Well , ma ' am , ' resumed <NAME> , ' under these circumstances , I imagine it would not be agreeable to a character like yours to remain here , though you would be very welcome here. ' ' Oh , dear no , sir , I could on no account think of that ! ' Mrs. <NAME> shook her head , still in her highly superior manner , and a little changed the small cough—coughing now , as if the spirit of prophecy rose within her , but had better be coughed down .
As they turned back , <NAME> ' s eye fell upon a small broken stone , partially buried in the ground , in front of a cottage door .
A <NAME> ( assisted by a <NAME> ) married the happy pair , and it behoved <NAME> himself to conduct <NAME> to breakfast .
Mr and <NAME> ' s house in <NAME> , <NAME> , was but a temporary residence .
I am glad to think I have been the instrument of good to <NAME> , and that I may be more so .
' But <NAME> pressed so much , sir -- ' The fact was , that <NAME> had bribed the man , who , being anxious to earn his money with a view to future favours , held the door in his hand , and ventured to linger still .
Suddenly she arose ; and hurrying on , in a direction quite opposite to that in which <NAME> was awaiting her returned , quickened her pace , until it gradually resolved into a violent run .
' My dear , ' assented her eminently practical parent , ' quite true , quite true. ' ' Why , father , ' she pursued , ' what a strange question to ask _me_ !
So unmatched were they , and opposed , so forced and linked together by a chain which adverse hazard and mischance had forged : that fancy might have imagined the pictures on the walls around them , startled by the unnatural conjunction , and observant of it in their several expressions .
I half expect the real master to come home presently , and say he is glad to see me .
" What is to be done with you ?
You know Lagnier , the gentleman .
Some hurried eagerly to catch a glimpse of the winning horse ; others darted to and fro , searching , no less eagerly , for the carriages they had left in quest of better stations .
You are to understand that his second visit to <NAME> was for his own pleasure .
This sound being taken up by the <NAME> , swelled into a rapturous trio which gave general satisfaction .

<NAME> ' r <NAME> , he can remember what she was ; you may judge for your own self what she is ; but neither of you can ' t fully know what she has been , is , and will be , to my loving art .
Take hold of this cup and saucer , ostler .
YOUR name now will be -- " " <NAME> . "
' When it was ' tickerlerly given out that you wasn ' t to go and worrit the wet nurse. ' ' She don ' t worry me , ' was the surprised rejoinder of <NAME> .
' <NAME> , ' said a gentleman in spectacles , who had not yet spoken , ' you complained last week , my good fellow , of the cocoa .
" You seem to forget , " returned <NAME> , " that I ask you to say nothing and have no interest in anything you say . "
Besides which , all that I could have said of the Story to any purpose , I had endeavoured to say in it .
In a small dull yard below his window , there was a tree -- green and flourishing enough , for such a place -- and as the air stirred among its leaves , it threw a rippling shadow on the white wall .
<NAME> <NAME> saw something so exquisitely ludicrous in this reply , that he burst into another laugh ; which laugh , meeting the coffee he was drinking , and carrying it down some wrong channel , very nearly terminated in his premature suffocation .
Well , you are a quiz ! ' <NAME> had no objection to earning the reputation at so cheap a rate : so he looked very knowing , and smiled mysteriously .
<NAME> <NAME> has joined your father ' s muster-roll .
After a while he softly seats himself upon the bedside with his face towards him -- just as he sat in the law-writer 's room -- and touches his chest and heart .
If you don ' t object to our old whim , <NAME> , let us devote this first glass to <NAME> and his wife. ' ' To <NAME> and his wife ! ' says Mr Dombey .
' What a game girl you are , to be such a first-rate sister , <NAME> ! ' whispered <NAME> .
Has been my late childhood ?
' <NAME> way shall we take , <NAME> ? ' Rosa replies : ' I want to go to the Lumps-of-Delight shop. ' ' To the— ? ' ' A <NAME> sweetmeat , sir .
" Have you got it here ? "
' What comes next ? ' Making a dignified attempt to gather himself together , but , as it were , dropping half a dozen pieces of himself while he tried in vain to pick up one , Mr Dolls , swaying his head from side to side , regarded his questioner with what he supposed to be a haughty smile and a scornful glance .
I looked in , and saw him a sitting lonely by his fire , brooding over it .
Instead of proceeding with any more anecdotes , as he had evidently intended but a moment before , he gave a short dry cough , and said , ' Well !
<NAME> with your hand , what means might I not find of advancing your interests and pushing your fortunes !
<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> ' went partners , ' and <NAME> and <NAME> did the same ; and even <NAME> and the spinster aunt established a joint- stock company of fish and flattery .
' And <NAME> ' s friend. ' ' Here is a note from her , entreating you to accede to the request of Mr Mortimer Lightwood , the bearer .
May I , <NAME> ' s <NAME> ? ' The Instrument-maker , without speaking , put her hand to his lips , and <NAME> , leaning back with her arms crossed , in the chair of presidency into which she had voted herself , bit one end of her bonnet strings , and heaved a gentle sigh as she looked up at the skylight .
' Inspired by this idea and the sentiments it awakened , sir , and feeling as a mutual friend that badgering , baiting , and bullying , was not the sort of thing calculated to expand the souls and promote the social harmony of the contending parties , I took upon myself to suggest a course which is THE course to be adopted to the present occasion .
And thus , with a clatter of maids and valets -- for it is one appurtenance of their cousinship that however difficult they may find it to keep themselves , they MUST keep maids and valets -- the cousins disperse to the four winds of heaven ; and the one wintry wind that blows to-day shakes a shower from the trees near the deserted house , as if all the cousins had been changed into leaves .
A flash in the pan or a shot ? "
' <NAME> , my dear , what portraits are you showing Twemlow ? ' ' Public characters , Alfred. ' ' Show him the last of me. ' ' Yes , Alfred. ' She puts the book down , takes another book up , turns the leaves , and presents the portrait to <NAME> .
I can keep this from <NAME> , only by buying him off .
" I believe so , " said <NAME> .
He dressed and got out so quickly that he found himself at the corner of the patriarchal street nearly an hour before her time ; but he was not sorry to have the opportunity of calming himself with a leisurely walk .
<NAME> looked after him , until he turned a corner of the road ; and then set forward on his walk to <NAME> .
We must push on again tomorrow , for we are not rich enough to loiter .
The girls had gone home , when my name burst into bloom on <NAME> ' s door ; and the sharp boy looked , all day , as if he had never heard of <NAME> , shut up in a back room , glancing down from her work into a sooty little strip of garden with a pump in it .
<NAME> departs in search of the iron gentleman , finds , and produces him .
I save nothing -- not a penny -- though I live as you see , but ' -- he laid his hand upon my arm and leant forward to whisper -- ' she shall be rich one of these days , and a fine lady .
Therefore I want to get him , for the present moment , into any poor lodging kept by decent people where he would be admitted .
There was a snap of cold , last week .
' You interrupted us at a critical moment , ' said he , pointing to the man whom I had found in company with him ; ' this fellow will murder me one of these days .
<NAME> , ' quoth the <NAME> , ' human justice may err , but it must act according to its lights .
I hope our occupation is a blameless one ? ' ' " See here , " said the friar , taking the frame from her hand , " an intricate winding of gaudy colours , without purpose or object , unless it be that one day it is destined for some vain ornament , to minister to the pride of your frail and giddy sex .
At last I come to the sea .
' And your sister ' s temper is wearing. ' ' I don ' t mind , Pa. ' ' And you must prepare yourself you know , my precious , ' said her father , with much gentleness , ' for our looking very poor and meagre at home , and being at the best but very uncomfortable , after Mr <NAME> ' s house. ' ' I don ' t mind , <NAME> .
And so she never lifted her head up any more , and it was just an hour later when we laid it down on her own bed , because we found she was gone. " <NAME> cried ; the darkening garden , and the lane , and the stars that were coming out , were blurred in my own sight .
" Do this look like a forge ? " replied <NAME> , sending his glance all round him with an air of injury .
" IS he after his time ? "
<NAME> then betook himself up-stairs , and the other magnates gradually floated up after him until there was no one left below but Mr Merdle .
It would be sentimental , perhaps ?
It was a picture of comfort , full of easy-chairs , cushions and footstools , worked by his mother ' s hand , and with no sort of thing omitted that could help to render it complete .
He began to have suspicions of the prisoner , and to keep an eye upon him , soon afterwards .
I have never told you , <NAME> , of her mother .
My construction even of their simple meaning was not very correct , for I read " wife of the <NAME> " as a complimentary reference to my father 's exaltation to a better world ; and if any one of my deceased relations had been referred to as " Below , " I have no doubt I should have formed the worst opinions of that member of the family .
'He gets worse instead of better , I think , ' said the elder lady .
' No , <NAME> , no supper. ' ' You shall if you like , ' said <NAME> .
' I ' ll try hard , dear mother , now .
' O yes , ' he said , ' quite well -- why not ? ' Sometimes he turned his head , and looked , with earnest gaze and outstretched neck , after some stranger in the crowd , until he disappeared from sight ; but , to the question why he did this , he answered not a word .
To the home of <NAME> ' s Uncle .
<NAME> ! ' But no <NAME> replied .
After looking at Mrs. Gummidge for some moments , in sore distress of mind , he glanced at the <NAME> clock , rose , snuffed the candle , and put it in the window .
' Other things are all very well in their way , but give me <NAME> ! ' ' Oh !
If you deny them from any mistaken regard or fear for them , judge of my intentions by their recognition of this person as their old humble friend. ' ' I always said it ! ' cried the bride , ' I knew she was not a common child !
" You would have been disposed of for so many shillings according to the market price of the article , and Dunstable the butcher would have come up to you as you lay in your straw , and he would have whipped you under his left arm , and with his right he would have tucked up his frock to get a penknife from out of his waistcoat-pocket , and he would have shed your blood and had your life .
If so , the answer was indefinite and vague .
It plaited itself into whatever I thought of , as a bodily pain would have done .
repeated <NAME> turning round in his chair to confront her .
I persuaded her to give me a sitting or two , for the street-door case .
<NAME> , who , while the attention of the other guests was attracted to the principals in the preceding scene , had eyed them like a wolf , appeared to breathe more freely now his niece was gone ; the decanters passing quickly round , he leaned back in his chair , and turned his eyes from speaker to speaker , as they warmed with wine , with looks that seemed to search their hearts , and lay bare , for his distempered sport , every idle thought within them .
In front of a big book-case , in a big chair , behind a big table , and before a big volume , sat <NAME> , looking a full size larger than any one of them , big as they were .
' What ! ' said <NAME> , ' cucumbers and vegetable marrows flying at the heads of the family as they walk in their own garden , and not meant impertinently !
You remember objecting to a word I used , as being too strong ?
It was another and a stronger woman who was the victim , and there had been a struggle -- in a barn .
We stopped to dine at <NAME> , and being now in <NAME> , were waited on , for the first time , by slaves .
For the moment , <NAME> does not turn to them , but remains looking at <NAME> looking at <NAME> ' s portrait through his eyeglass .
The poor schoolmaster shook his head , and said that they barely filled the two forms .
' Do you stay long , sir ? ' ' I have not at present the intention , ' said Mr Dorrit , ' of -- ha -- exceeding a fortnight. ' ' That ' s a very short stay , after so long a journey , ' returned Mr Merdle .
What warning did I give that fellow , the first time he set foot in the house , when the express object of his visit was to know how he could knock Religion over , and floor the Established <NAME> ?
cries the woman , almost breathless .
The fine little boy with the blister on his nose is the eldest .
A soft voice seemed to whisper in her ear , ' <NAME> , dear <NAME> , it is nothing but a dream ! ' and stretching out her arms , she returned the caress of her new Mama , who then went out at the door in the light of the grey morning .
<NAME> and cold as the wintry day is , it is darker and colder in these deserted chambers than in many a hut that will barely exclude the weather ; and though the servants heap fires in the grates and set the couches and the chairs within the warm glass screens that let their ruddy light shoot through to the furthest corners , there is a heavy cloud upon the rooms which no light will dispel .
" I know little enough , I am sure , thanks to Ma !
He said , ' No , no , he had done quite right , ' but that was all .
' I am sorry to trouble you , <NAME> , ' said the brother , gathering them up , ' but -- ' ' Oh !
' Your wife wants money , I suppose , ' said Mr Dombey , putting his hand in his pocket , and speaking ( but that he always did ) haughtily .
Her own little room too , where she had so often knelt down and prayed at night -- prayed for the time which she hoped was dawning now -- the little room where she had slept so peacefully , and dreamed such pleasant dreams !
Different from <NAME> t ' other side the court .
' Yes , my bed , <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> , ' I ' m a prisoner .
' I have been thinking , <NAME> , ' replied the sexton , ' that she , ' he pointed to the grave , ' must have been a deal older than you or me. ' ' Seventy-nine , ' answered the old man with a shake of the head , ' I tell you that I saw it. ' ' Saw it ? ' replied the sexton ; ' aye , but , <NAME> , women don ' t always tell the truth about their age. ' ' That ' s true indeed , ' said the other old man , with a sudden sparkle in his eye .
My sweetest <NAME> , and my dearest <NAME> , do we not know that any difference between you two -- No , <NAME> ; not now. ' Flowers was the maid , who , finding gentlemen present , retreated with precipitation .
Now , if you get a good composition for this debt , which you long ago gave up for lost , you ' ll stand my friend , and help me .
" I do n't know nothink about no -- where I was took by the beadle , do you mean ? "
Give me a rope , a long rope .
<NAME> was served in a style no less polite than the dinner ; and after tea , the young gentlemen rising and bowing as before , withdrew to fetch up the unfinished tasks of that day , or to get up the already looming tasks of to-morrow .
The Period It was the best of times , it was the worst of times , it was the age of wisdom , it was the age of foolishness , it was the epoch of belief , it was the epoch of incredulity , it was the season of <NAME> , it was the season of <NAME> , it was the spring of hope , it was the winter of despair , we had everything before us , we had nothing before us , we were all going direct to <NAME> , we were all going direct the other way -- in short , the period was so far like the present period , that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received , for good or for evil , in the superlative degree of comparison only .
Its contents are known to nobody but himself and us. ' ' Are you certain ? ' demanded <NAME> , precipitately ; ' not even to my mother or sister ?
'Upon my word I was not , sir , ' replied <NAME> , earnestly .
' If you will take me for your wife , <NAME> , I will love you dearly .
I was determined to come through , and come to you. ' ' What is the matter ? ' ' Nothing ' s the matter , sir .
People to say that Mr Dombey -- Mr Dombey ! -- was separated from his wife !
The books were not easy to procure ; and the answer at several shops was , either that they were just out of them , or that they never kept them , or that they had had a great many last month , or that they expected a great many next week But <NAME> was not easily baffled in such an enterprise ; and having entrapped a white-haired youth , in a black calico apron , from a library where she was known , to accompany her in her quest , she led him such a life in going up and down , that he exerted himself to the utmost , if it were only to get rid of her ; and finally enabled her to return home in triumph .
Hoo much cash hast thee gotten ? ' ' Not much , ' said <NAME> , colouring , ' but I can make it enough .
' The more ' s the pity , sir , ' returned Mrs. <NAME> ; ' you are losing all your good old habits .
and the old girl herself , accompanied by <NAME> , appears .
The rope went out as before , the signal was made as before , and the windlass stopped .
" You will not desert this lady we are in search of ; you will not abandon her on such a night and in such a state of mind as I know her to be in ! "
The company amounted in number to some twenty-five or thirty , being composed of such members of the theatrical profession , then engaged or disengaged in <NAME> , as were numbered among the most intimate friends of <NAME> and Mrs. Crummles .
'Of course I know that , my dear .
You are a far more competent judge of such affairs than I am .
Oh , dear me , I 'm out of breath .
Also , how heartily we drank the captain ' s health that day at dinner ; and how restless we became about packing up : and how two or three of the most sanguine spirits rejected the idea of going to bed at all that night as something it was not worth while to do , so near the shore , but went nevertheless , and slept soundly ; and how to be so near our journey ' s end , was like a pleasant dream , from which one feared to wake .
I am always disengaged after four or five o ' clock , and I have time early in the morning .
How she got from story to story was a mystery beyond solution .
' You had better let him go .
<NAME> ' s the fourth. ' ' Is the mother living ? ' I inquired .
' I ' ll take care of you. ' ' You ' re very kind , ' I gratefully returned .
' If I had left myself any breath to cry with , I should have cried again .
His healthy state of mind appeared even to derive a gratification from <NAME> ' s position of embarrassment and isolation among the good company ; and if <NAME> had been in that condition with which <NAME> was incessantly contending , he would have suspected it , and would have struggled with the suspicion as a meanness , even while he sat at the table .
It is , however , the possession , and the only possession except fifty shillings per annum and a very small box indifferently filled with clothing , of a lean young woman from a workhouse ( by some supposed to have been christened <NAME> ) who , although she was farmed or contracted for during her growing time by an amiable benefactor of his species resident at <NAME> , and can not fail to have been developed under the most favourable circumstances , " has fits , " which the parish ca n't account for .
I had some association with it , that struck upon my heart directly ; but I was thinking of anything else when it came upon me , and was confused .
You are going to try matrimony .
My fancy is not able to get that far. ' As the low fire gleamed upon her , it showed her smiling , mournfully and abstractedly .
' If you know anything of him , <NAME> , except that he came from <NAME> -- which we all know -- tell it to Mr Clennam freely. ' ' I know nothing more about him , ' said the girl .
' <NAME> vexation , <NAME> ? ' asked the benignant father .
At this part of the recital <NAME> held his breath , and listened with a face of intense eagerness , though his eyes were not directed towards the speaker .
The <NAME> had next to consider where and why ?
The way in which I listened to all the incidents of the house that made themselves audible to me ; the ringing of bells , the opening and shutting of doors , the murmuring of voices , the footsteps on the stairs ; to any laughing , whistling , or singing , outside , which seemed more dismal than anything else to me in my solitude and disgrace -- the uncertain pace of the hours , especially at night , when I would wake thinking it was morning , and find that the family were not yet gone to bed , and that all the length of night had yet to come -- the depressed dreams and nightmares I had -- the return of day , noon , afternoon , evening , when the boys played in the churchyard , and I watched them from a distance within the room , being ashamed to show myself at the window lest they should know I was a prisoner -- the strange sensation of never hearing myself speak -- the fleeting intervals of something like cheerfulness , which came with eating and drinking , and went away with it -- the setting in of rain one evening , with a fresh smell , and its coming down faster and faster between me and the church , until it and gathering night seemed to quench me in gloom , and fear , and remorse -- all this appears to have gone round and round for years instead of days , it is so vividly and strongly stamped on my remembrance .
We found <NAME> at his desk , in the turret office on the ground floor , either writing , or pretending to write , hard .
I see you pitch your <NAME> ' s bundle into the river .
After running abstractedly over the keys for a few minutes , she fell into a low and very solemn air ; and as she played it , they heard a sound as if she were weeping .
' Ay ! ' the <NAME> echoes ; ' Durdles , <NAME> ! ' ' The truth is , sir , ' explains <NAME> , ' that my curiosity in the man was first really stimulated by <NAME> .
' As I supposed from his not sending ! ' thought <NAME> .
Full of such thoughts , they turned into the long and sombre street .
<NAME> ! " " Yes , sir. " " Is that horse of mine ready ? " " <NAME> round to the door , sir. " " I say .
<NAME> <NAME> merely nodded to <NAME> , who disappearing with great alacrity , shortly returned , pushing in Mrs. Bumble , and dragging her unwilling consort after him .
I heard that one boy , who was a coal-merchant ' s son , came as a set-off against the coal-bill , and was called , on that account , ' Exchange or <NAME> ' -- a name selected from the arithmetic book as expressing this arrangement .
Then Mr <NAME> descended and bore down upon him , with his utmost pressure of steam on .
I have no address , sir .
I only put it to yourself , sir . "
He heard a shout -- another -- saw the face change from its vindictive passion to a faint sickness and terror -- felt the earth tremble -- knew in a moment that the rush was come -- uttered a shriek -- looked round -- saw the red eyes , bleared and dim , in the daylight , close upon him -- was beaten down , caught up , and whirled away upon a jagged mill , that spun him round and round , and struck him limb from limb , and licked his stream of life up with its fiery heat , and cast his mutilated fragments in the air .
I could see that twice or thrice he looked back as if to ascertain if I were still watching him , or perhaps to assure himself that I was not following at a distance .
' I came here , ' said the military gentleman turning to Mrs Jarley -- ' ' pon my soul and honour I hardly know what I came here for .
They had left the town by night ; no one had seen them go ; no one had met them on the road ; the driver of no coach , cart , or waggon , had seen any travellers answering their description ; nobody had fallen in with them , or heard of them .
'He is right in saying that you were with this hag the night she died ; and that she told you something -- ' 'About the mother of the boy you named , ' replied the matron interrupting him .
' And how did you leave <NAME> , reverend sir ? ' said <NAME> .
' I didn ' t climb up the ladder in _them_.—Shouldn ' t be so high up , if I had. ' Being left to saunter in the hall a minute or two while <NAME> went up-stairs for the address , he opened the door of the children ' s study and looked into that serene floor-clothed apartment , which , notwithstanding its book-cases and its cabinets and its variety of learned and philosophical appliances , had much of the genial aspect of a room devoted to hair-cutting .
And was it a hopeful or a promising thing anywhere ?
He let it lie there for some time , as if he had not the courage to open it , but at length did so and turned deadly pale .
' Of something that has made you sorrowful ? ' There was a long pause .
No matter who invites you to stay elsewhere .
He looked back , as he went out at the door , upon the well-lighted and luxurious room , the beautiful and glittering objects everywhere displayed , the shape of <NAME> in its rich dress seated before her glass , and the face of <NAME> as the glass presented it to him ; and betook himself to his old chamber of cogitation , carrying away with him a vivid picture in his mind of all these things , and a rambling and unaccountable speculation ( such as sometimes comes into a man ' s head ) how they would all look when he saw them next .
' The poor baron bore it all as long as he could , and when he could bear it no longer lost his appetite and his spirits , and sat himself gloomily and dejectedly down .
' What is the matter ? ' asked the visitor again .
She was not accustomed to think of herself , or to trouble any one with her emotions .
During this dialogue <NAME> has stood aloof by the old portmanteau , with his hands behind him , equally removed , to all appearance , from all three kinds of interest exhibited near the bed -- from the young surgeon 's professional interest in death , noticeable as being quite apart from his remarks on the deceased as an individual ; from the old man 's unction ; and the little crazy woman 's awe .
' On my return to <NAME> , after the period of absence occasioned by my brother ' s marriage , ' pursued <NAME> in a disdainful voice , ' and on the return of <NAME> from her visit to her friend <NAME> , I imagined that the manner of <NAME> gave me greater occasion for suspicion than before .
<NAME> , feeling not a little disgusted with this dialogue , as well as with the air and manner of the two beings by whom it had been carried on , was about to inquire whether he could not be accommodated with a private sitting-room , when two or three strangers of genteel appearance entered , at sight of whom the boy threw his cigar into the fire , and whispering to <NAME> that they had come to ' make it all right ' for him , joined them at a table in the farther end of the room .
They exchanged one brief glance ; there was a fire in the eyes of both , which could not be mistaken .
' Oh , don ' t talk to me about poor , ' returned my aunt .
Now has he made atonement to you -- with his life !
" Not just at present , my Lady . "
Up from among the fern in the hollow , and winding by the bridle-road among the trees , comes sometimes to this lonely spot the sound of horses ' hoofs .
Naturally , we was both of us inclined to give such a subject a wide berth .
Had n't you better go to bed ? "
There he sat , taking his wine , and taking a good deal of it , for two hours ; while <NAME> played on the piano , worked , and talked to him and me .
<NAME> <NAME> , putting a hand on my shoulder and walking me on at his side without saying anything to me , addressed himself to his followers .
' Thank you <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' thank you , I am sure .
It is for him to say , here and now , all he can ; or to go hence , and do all he can .
Upon which Mrs. Bagnet , with her cloak , basket , and umbrella , goes home , bright-eyed again , to the rest of her family , and the comrades sally forth on the hopeful errand of mollifying <NAME> .
Coming before me , on this particular evening that I mention , mingled with the childish recollections and later fancies , the ghosts of half-formed hopes , the broken shadows of disappointments dimly seen and understood , the blending of experience and imagination , incidental to the occupation with which my thoughts had been busy , it was more than commonly suggestive .
You 'll find , or I 'm much mistaken , that the deceased <NAME> had the intention of communicating the whole to you as soon as he considered it ripe , and further , that he had given her ladyship so to understand .
' ' Cause I was always used to a four-poster afore I came here , and I find the legs of the table answer just as well , ' replied the cobbler .
' The moral being -- I believe that ' s the right expression -- of this exemplary person , derived its highest gratification from anathematizing his nearest relations and turning them out of doors .
' That ' s my handsome daughter , ' said the old woman .
<NAME> discuss it with me ; pray enable me to see it a little more clearly , and teach me how to be a little more useful. " Doctor <NAME> sat meditating after these earnest words were spoken , and <NAME> did not press him .
' Oh you beauties ! ' cried <NAME> , affecting to salute the door by which the ladies had departed .
We duly came back to breakfast , and Mrs. <NAME> sat at the head of the table and <NAME> at the foot .
Would that be it , Mr Wegg ? ' ' That would depend upon what it was , Mr Venus .
' If one was the most dutiful child in existence ( of course on the whole one hopes one is ) , isn ' t she enough to make one want to poke her with something wooden , sitting there bolt upright in a corner ? ' ' Only suppose , ' returned <NAME> , ' that poor Pa was to sit bolt upright in another corner. ' ' My dear , he couldn ' t do it , ' said <NAME> .
<NAME> morning , sir ! ' The Secretary pursued his way , not very much elevated in spirits by this conversation , and , arriving at the <NAME> mansion , found <NAME> waiting for him .
I showed it to him now , and he admired it highly .
You are , at least , as avaricious as you are revengeful .
Acting upon this suggestion , they adjourned to a neighbouring apartment , where <NAME> , being called in , involved himself and his respected superior in such a wonderful maze of fresh contradictions and impossibilities , as tended to throw no particular light on anything , but the fact of his own strong mystification ; except , indeed , his declarations that he should n't know the real boy , if he were put before him that instant ; that he had only taken <NAME> to be he , because <NAME> had said he was ; and that <NAME> had , five minutes previously , admitted in the kitchen , that he began to be very much afraid he had been a little too hasty .
And , perhaps , unlearned as she was , she could have brought a dawning knowledge home to Mr Dombey at that early day , which would not then have struck him in the end like lightning .
That is according as the young gentleman has his original character formed .
The bedroom where the clutching old man had lost his grip on life , was left as he had left it .
In half an hour after our arrival , Mrs. <NAME> appeared ; and in the course of an hour the various things necessary for breakfast straggled one by one into the dining-room .
More than that , we couldn ' t improve the mills themselves , unless we laid down <NAME> carpets on the floors .
' When did I come here ?
I had forgotten my threat .
Indeed , we were all more or less amused , except that miserable Mrs. Gummidge , whose courtship would appear to have been of an exactly parallel nature , she was so continually reminded by these transactions of the old one .
Dear heart alive , how his niece by marriage started !
They provided <NAME> with materials for plying her work , and she had a little table placed at the foot of his bed .
" I generally am near , " returns <NAME> , " being so fond of children .
' Here he is ! ' Perceiving himself to be the antecedent , <NAME> looked from the watchman to the man .
But the bequest is involved in legal disputes , and pending them the work has stopped ; so that like many other great undertakings in <NAME> , even this is rather going to be done one of these days , than doing now .
' You are quite sure ? ' said Mrs. Pott , stealing a tender look at her visitor .
I had an uncle once , <NAME> , who lived in <NAME> , and had a most excellent business as a tobacconist -- hem -- who had such small feet , that they were no bigger than those which are usually joined to wooden legs -- the most symmetrical feet , <NAME> , that even you can imagine. ' ' They must have had something of the appearance of club feet , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
oh don ' t ! ' exclaimed <NAME> , who really felt a thrill of terror in seeing the old man weep .
She answered , looking all the while at her husband for leave .
Although <NAME> was not in <NAME> , its master was , and it was stamped with the same seal .
' Say you are sure I didn ' t mean to .
In case I should be taking a liberty in putting your ladyship on your guard when there 's no necessity for it , you will endeavour , I should hope , to outlive my presumption , and I shall endeavour to outlive your disapprobation .
I rang the bell , the servant came , and <NAME> , laying his written card upon the table and making a dejected bow , departed .
But <NAME> is not alone to-night to ponder at his usual length .

So ' tis wi ' Slackbridge every bit. ' Reverting for a moment to his former refuge , he observed a cautionary movement of her eyes towards the door .
' If <NAME> , reduced to imbecility , at the point of death , and labouring under the delusion of some imaginary relenting towards a girl of whom he had heard that his nephew had once had a fancy for her which he had crushed out of him , and that she afterwards drooped away into melancholy and withdrawal from all who knew her -- if , in that state of weakness , he dictated to me , whose life she had darkened with her sin , and who had been appointed to know her wickedness from her own hand and her own lips , a bequest meant as a recompense to her for supposed unmerited suffering ; was there no difference between my spurning that injustice , and coveting mere money -- a thing which you , and your comrades in the prisons , may steal from anyone ? ' ' Time presses , madame .
If you come to that , I ' d sooner suspect your honesty than his. ' Miss <NAME> pulled out the tin snuff-box , and took a long , slow pinch , regarding her brother with a steady gaze all the time .
That learned man in a few hurried words explained the real state of the case .
The dust storm , driving between them and the placid sky , parted for a moment and showed them the stars .
' <NAME> young man , his <NAME> , ' said the <NAME> of the <NAME> .

<NAME> looks aghast at <NAME> .
Mr Sownds the <NAME> has long risen from the steps , and is in waiting with his cocked hat in his hand .
<NAME> me , Mr Clennam , ' said the sprightly young Barnacle in his pleasantest manner , ' our place is not a wicked Giant to be charged at full tilt ; but only a windmill showing you , as it grinds immense quantities of chaff , which way the country wind blows. ' ' If I could believe that , ' said <NAME> , ' it would be a dismal prospect for all of us. ' ' Oh !
At first , she seemed to wonder at the gentle compassion with which the <NAME> spoke to her , and at his wish that she should have her mother with her , to relieve the dull monotony of her life .
The wine was so bitter cold that it forced a little scream from <NAME> , which she had great difficulty in turning into a ' Hem ! ' The veal had come from such an airy pantry , that the first taste of it had struck a sensation as of cold lead to Mr Chick ' s extremities .

Her face being turned away from me and towards him , I could not see it .
For I believed one of two other persons to have become possessed of it , and to have turned it to this cruel account .
And if ever there were an unfeeling handsome chin that looked as if , for certain , it had never been , in familiar parlance , ' chucked ' by the hand of man , it was the chin curbed up so tight and close by that laced bridle .

Perfectly calm and steady , he sometimes repeated them to himself as he walked ; but , he heard them always .
' Ah , ' said the new-comer , ' it ' s a good thing for both of us , isn ' t it ?
Now for it. ' And , with a very grave face , <NAME> slowly read as follows -- ' A select company of the <NAME> footmen presents their compliments to <NAME> , and requests the pleasure of his company this evening , to a friendly swarry , consisting of a boiled leg of mutton with the usual trimmings .
So we all are , down to the dog .
I use the word natural , in the sense of its being unaffected ; there was something comic in his distraught way , as though it would have been downright ludicrous but for his own perception that it was very near being so .
But when she was gone , I looked about me for a place to hide my face in , and got behind one of the gates in the brewery-lane , and leaned my sleeve against the wall there , and leaned my forehead on it and cried .
' T ' other ' s a black-haired chap in mulberry livery , with a wery large head ? ' ' Yes , yes , he is , ' said <NAME> and <NAME> , with great earnestness .
There are not many persons , I hope and believe , who , after reading these passages , can ever hear that name with indifference .
' I am indeed. ' Mrs Clennam , with a gentleness of which the dreaming <NAME> had never dreamed her to be capable , drew down the face of her little seamstress , and kissed her on the forehead .
It is likely to induce people to contrast <NAME> in her relation towards my daughter , with <NAME> in her relation towards myself .
Do say something more ? ' ' I ' ll say that , ' said the dwarf , seizing her by the arm , ' and do that too , which undone and unsaid would be best for you , unless you go directly. ' ' Has anything happened ? ' cried his wife .
Let us go ; do let us go. ' ' Give me the money , ' returned the old man , ' I must have it .
He is a sharp-eyed man -- a quick keen man -- and he takes in everybody 's look at him , all at once , individually and collectively , in a manner that stamps him a remarkable man .
What ' s your name ? ' ' <NAME> Wegg. -- I don ' t , ' said Mr Wegg , bestirring himself to take the same precaution as before , ' I don ' t know why <NAME> , and I don ' t know why Wegg. ' ' Now , <NAME> , ' said Mr Boffin , hugging his stick closer , ' I want to make a sort of offer to you .
I hope you may be able to think in your own conscience that it is nonsense ; you ' ll find your spirits all the better for it in this -- you ' ll excuse my being so free -- in this burying-ground of a place ; which is wearing of me down .
cried the man ; 'it wo n't answer here .
Let him remember it in that room , years to come !
There are a few children employed in these factories , but not many .
Two or three diplomatic interviews , the result of great subtlety on Mr Wegg ' s part , but assuming the mask of careless yielding to a fortuitous combination of circumstances impelling him towards <NAME> , had enabled him to complete his bargain with Mr Venus .

'Why , he was so angry , <NAME> , that he forgot even to ask after you ! '

I would oppose her in everything , and compete with her .
When <NAME> was singing in the dark room ? "
' The governor hisself ' ll be down here presently. ' ' He ' s a-cabbin ' it , I suppose ? ' said the father .
His travelling baggage is easily carried in his hand , and he repairs with it on foot , to a hybrid hotel in a little square behind <NAME> , near the <NAME> Office .
In Mrs <NAME> ' s presence , sir , we had better drop it. ' Mr Wegg thus came out of his disadvantage with quite a chivalrous air , and not only that , but by dint of repeating with a manly delicacy , ' In Mrs <NAME> ' s presence , sir , we had better drop it ! ' turned the disadvantage on <NAME> , who felt that he had committed himself in a very painful manner .
These are my fears , and these fears I found upon your own demeanour .
Presently a dark object was seen in it , bearing towards us on the tide .
I ask your pardon though , ' said the old man , ' if I spoke rather rough at first .
said <NAME> , rising with his high-shouldered bow .
And all friends is no backerder , if not no forarder .

She took him to her own chamber , and , still holding him by the hand as if she feared to lose him for an instant , gathered together the little stock she had , and hung her basket on her arm .
But still a cloud seemed to hang over his companions which that great man could not but be sensible of , and was wholly at a loss to account for .
I sit here of a night surrounded by the lovely trophies of my art , and what have they done for me ?
But , fortunately for <NAME> , <NAME> did not ; and although he cast about all that day , and kept a corner of his brain working on the one anxious subject through all the round of schemes and business that came with it , night found him at last , still harping on the same theme , and still pursuing the same unprofitable reflections .
There being no stage-coach next day , upon the road we wished to take , I hired ' an extra , ' at a reasonable charge to carry us to <NAME> ; a small town from whence there is a railroad to <NAME> .
May I -- for <NAME> ' s sake , and for my own -- take your hand before I go ? ' She gave him the gloved hand she had maimed last night .
She had nestled down with him , that his head might lie upon her arm ; and her hair drooping over him curtained him from the light .
To-day she is at <NAME> ; yesterday she was at her house in town ; to-morrow she may be abroad , for anything the fashionable intelligence can with confidence predict .
He could not do it .
' This young couple , the lost youth and <NAME> , my ward , though so long betrothed , and so long recognising their betrothal , and so near being married— ' <NAME> saw a staring white face , and two quivering white lips , in the easy-chair , and saw two muddy hands gripping its sides .
' Nothing , ' replied that gentleman , who had had a short man standing on each of his feet for the quarter of an hour immediately preceding .
If he had previously sustained his firmness and fortitude , it had been by an effort which had cost him no little pain ; but the warm welcome , the hearty manner , the homely unaffected commiseration , of the good old man , went to his heart , and no inward struggle could prevent his showing it .
My gentleman from <NAME> , I ' ll be there before ye , and bide your coming .

And <NAME> said , ' Upon my word ! ' Upon which <NAME> said that <NAME> was a giddy thing ; and <NAME> said that <NAME> needn ' t colour up quite so much ; and <NAME> beat <NAME> , and <NAME> beat <NAME> .
' I would be something to you , if I might. ' ' What ? ' said <NAME> , almost sternly .
<NAME> <NAME> ' s life had been , from her first appearance on this planet , altogether of a shady order ; for , Mr Podsnap ' s young person was likely to get little good out of association with other young persons , and had therefore been restricted to companionship with not very congenial older persons , and with massive furniture .
To me—who had been accustomed to think of it as something left behind in the strides of advancing society , as something neglected and forgotten , slumbering and wasting in its sleep—the demand for labour and the rates of wages ; the busy quays of <NAME> ; the vessels taking in their cargoes , and discharging them ; the amount of shipping in the different ports ; the commerce , roads , and public works , all made _to last_ ; the respectability and character of the public journals ; and the amount of rational comfort and happiness which honest industry may earn : were very great surprises .
On examination , however , they turned out to be strictly correct .
I demand of <NAME> , will he not come to deliver me ?
You could tell it nothing that would surprise it , unless , indeed , it redounded to my credit or honour , and then it would scout you for a liar .

She saw me reading it -- reading it of late -- I did very often -- She watched me , saw me put it in the box that fitted into this , the box is gone , she has stolen it .
Of <NAME> , who acts as a semi-auxiliary bridesmaid , being the first to cry , and of her doing homage ( as I take it ) to the memory of <NAME> , in sobs ; of <NAME> Clarissa applying a smelling-bottle ; of Agnes taking care of <NAME> ; of my aunt endeavouring to represent herself as a model of sternness , with tears rolling down her face ; of little Dora trembling very much , and making her responses in faint whispers .

The private dwelling-houses are , for the most part , large and elegant ; the shops extremely good ; and the public buildings handsome .

<NAME> Members of <NAME> , who , little more than twenty years before , had made themselves merry with the wild railroad theories of engineers , and given them the liveliest rubs in cross-examination , went down into the north with their watches in their hands , and sent on messages before by the electric telegraph , to say that they were coming .
' Well , I think it is , ' said <NAME> .
' Then , of course , ' said <NAME> , ' he must beg his way , and he could do that , nowhere , but on the public road. ' ' That ' s true , ' exclaimed <NAME> , clapping his hands .

The loan from your lady and gentleman of twenty shillings to fit out a basket with , would be a fortune for me .
All this , Mrs. Snagsby , as an injured woman , and the friend of Mrs. Chadband , and the follower of <NAME> , and the mourner of the late <NAME> , is here to certify under the seal of confidence , with every possible confusion and involvement possible and impossible , having no pecuniary motive whatever , no scheme or project but the one mentioned , and bringing here , and taking everywhere , her own dense atmosphere of dust , arising from the ceaseless working of her mill of jealousy .
But that young gentleman , considering his nautical friend as merely in a state of preparation for the interview he was going to have , was quite satisfied , and did not review his own discreet conduct without chuckle .
Now you shall judge if I am worthy of belief , both as I was , and as I am. ' Still upon her knees , and with her eyes upon the fire , and the fire shining on her ruined beauty and her wild black hair , one long tress of which she pulled over her shoulder , and wound about her hand , and thoughtfully bit and tore while speaking , she went on : ' When I was young and pretty , and this , ' plucking contemptuously at the hair she held , ' was only handled delicately , and couldn ' t be admired enough , my mother , who had not been very mindful of me as a child , found out my merits , and was fond of me , and proud of me .
Then , little woman , can I do better for a time than retain Mrs. Woodcourt here ? "
In the reluctance he had felt to believe that she loved any one ; in his desire to set that question at rest ; in a half-formed consciousness he had had that there would be a kind of nobleness in his helping her love for any one , was there no suppressed something on his own side that he had hushed as it arose ?
<NAME> <NAME> ; come , you must keep her spirits up , poor girl. ' The good old lady heard this , for her lip quivered as her son said it .
That ' s the cause of my presenting myself here this morning. ' ' I am very glad of any cause , sir , ' said the Notary , ' which procures me the honour of this visit. ' ' Sir , ' retorted the stranger , ' you speak like a mere man of the world , and I think you something better .
I consumed the whole time in thinking how strange it was that I should be encompassed by all this taint of prison and crime ; that , in my childhood out on our lonely marshes on a winter evening , I should have first encountered it ; that , it should have reappeared on two occasions , starting out like a stain that was faded but not gone ; that , it should in this new way pervade my fortune and advancement .

This is an extraordinary day in my calendar .
We had left <NAME> on Friday .

' Your little boy is a very long time gone. ' ' Why it ' s a good long way to the <NAME> , sir , ' remonstrated Mrs. <NAME> .
After a blank , I found that I was lying unbound , on the floor , in the same place , with my head on some one 's knee .

' ' Serious , from my heart -- from my soul ! ' returned <NAME> , with great energy .
He has won the pool. " It was as much as I could do to assent .
The childish prayer of that old birthday when I had aspired to be industrious , contented , and true-hearted and to do good to some one and win some love to myself if I could came back into my mind with a reproachful sense of all the happiness I had since enjoyed and all the affectionate hearts that had been turned towards me .
She raised her eyes quickly , shook her head , and , in a kind of triumph , almost laughed .
He wonders what he did it for .
The wine flowed freely , as indeed it had done all day .
Let me stay a little while ! "
He naturally loves a certain person , on my account ; and acts solely for a certain person ' s good .

I begged permission to retain him , truly saying that he was not at all troublesome , and carried him upstairs and laid him on my bed .
That envoy found her on a little square of carpet , so extremely diminutive in reference to the size of her stone and marble floor that she looked as if she might have had it spread for the trying on of a ready-made pair of shoes ; or as if she had come into possession of the enchanted piece of carpet , bought for forty purses by one of the three princes in the <NAME> , and had that moment been transported on it , at a wish , into a palatial saloon with which it had no connection .
<NAME> was the most grateful little creature in the world , and it was delightful to see her bright gratitude beaming in her face .
' That night , in the silence and desolation of his miserable room , the wretched man knelt down by the dead body of his wife , and called on God to witness a terrible oath , that from that hour , he devoted himself to revenge her death and that of his child ; that thenceforth to the last moment of his life , his whole energies should be directed to this one object ; that his revenge should be protracted and terrible ; that his hatred should be undying and inextinguishable ; and should hunt its object through the world .
' And there ' s my sister Jemima at the door , I do declare ' cried <NAME> , ' with my own sweet precious baby in her arms ! ' The sight added such an extensive pair of wings to <NAME> ' s impatience , that she set off down the Gardens at a run , and bouncing on <NAME> , changed babies with her in a twinkling ; to the unutterable astonishment of that young damsel , on whom the heir of the <NAME> seemed to have fallen from the clouds .
I live here with my brother .
As <NAME> cast ashes not only on its own head but on the neighbourhood ' s too—after the manner of those pious persons who do penance for their own sins by putting other people into sackcloth—it was customary for those who now and then thirsted for a draught of pure air , which is not absolutely the most wicked among the vanities of life , to get a few miles away by the railroad , and then begin their walk , or their lounge in the fields .
' Why , no , ' says <NAME> ; ' remarkable thing , you are all wrong .
<NAME> comes through at four , Sir. -- It don ' t stop. ' He passed his hand across his throbbing head , and looked at his watch .
I wish to lead up to it by degrees .
The glare of the sinking flame , reflected in the oaken panels whose carved tops were dimly seen in the dusky roof -- the aged walls , where strange shadows came and went with every flickering of the fire -- the solemn presence , within , of that decay which falls on senseless things the most enduring in their nature : and , without , and round about on every side , of <NAME> -- filled her with deep and thoughtful feelings , but with none of terror or alarm .
He was dressed in a particularly gorgeous manner , with plenty of articles of jewellery about him -- all about three sizes larger than those which are usually worn by gentlemen -- and a rough greatcoat to crown the whole .
The whole population were shy of him on these various counts of indictment , but especially the last , which involved a species of domestic treason ; and he soon became so confirmed in his seclusion , that his only time for walking up and down was when the evening <NAME> were assembled at their songs and toasts and sentiments , and when the yard was nearly left to the women and children .
All this looked tolerably expensive , I thought , and gave me an agreeable notion of a proctor ' s business .
" Look at the boy you 're waiting for , who 's gone out to do me a good turn .
Never mind ; I dare say I shall manage to recollect it , in the course of half an hour or so. ' The prim man arrived at this point just as the glasses came back , when <NAME> , who had been absorbed in attention during the whole time , said he should very much like to hear the end of it , for , so far as it went , it was , without exception , the very best story he had ever heard .
You have so many things to think about , ' returned Mr Meagles , clapping him on the shoulder , as if his weakness must not be left to itself on any account .
But you were so much better than I , so necessary to me in every boyish hope and disappointment , that to have you to confide in , and rely upon in everything , became a second nature , supplanting for the time the first and greater one of loving you as I do !

It went away into the distance , and what do you think it seemed to do as it moved with the waves ? ' ' Pitch , ' said Mr Toots .
No warmth could warm , no wintry weather chill him .
[ Picture : <NAME> recovered from the <NAME> ] ' It ha ' shined upon me , ' he said reverently , ' in my pain and trouble down below .
' <NAME> far is it to any town or village ? ' she asked of the husband .
" And to attend the court no more ? "
I suppose your loyalty to <NAME> will allow that ? "
' Well , young man , now you _have _done it ! ' said the short chairman .
And his hammer is handed him .
This was given out , sir , to a writer who lodges just over on the opposite side of the lane . "
For that brief time , his face is knitted and stern .
Someone of a nobler character , and more worthy altogether than anyone I have ever seen here , must rise up , before I give my consent .

He was very close to her just then , gentlemen , so he really ought to know .
His windows are dark and quiet , and his door is shut .
If the fire was to go out , through any accident , I verily believe she ' d go out too , and never come to life again. ' As they looked at her , I looked at her also .
Notwithstanding that Mr <NAME> had a strong conviction to the contrary , founded on his recollection of having carefully taken it out , he was fain to admit that this was possible , and therefore went grumbling to the door where , sure enough , he found it .
<NAME> quickly brought a bottle from a cupboard , in which there were many : which , to judge from the diversity of their appearance , were filled with several kinds of liquids .
<NAME> is a fine fellow .
How does that little old song go , which , under pretence of being cheerful , is by far the most lugubrious I ever heard in my life ?
I am a particularly Angular man , ' proceeded <NAME> , as if it suddenly occurred to him to mention it , ' and I am not used to give anything away .
I believed that the <NAME> was right , and I had no worse suspicions .
' This way , ' said the first speaker ; ' they notch in here -- it ' s the best place in the whole field ; ' and the cricketer , panting on before , preceded them to the tent .
' Now , shiny <NAME> , ' said the hostler to the deputy hostler , ' give the gen ' lm ' n the ribbons. ' Shiny <NAME> ' -- so called , probably , from his sleek hair and oily countenance -- placed the reins in <NAME> ' s left hand ; and the upper hostler thrust a whip into his right .
Are you , or ain ' t you ? ' ' Go on , Mr Boffin ; don ' t appeal to me. ' ' Not appeal to <NAME> , ' retorted Mr Boffin as if he hadn ' t done so .
Without another word he led <NAME> into the passage , and thence into the official pantry at the end of it , where he thrust him into a chair , and mounting upon his high stool , sat , with his arms hanging , straight down by his sides , gazing fixedly upon him , as from a tower of observation .

Details were then settled for taking possession on the next day but one , when <NAME> might be reasonably expected ; and <NAME> went back to <NAME> ' s <NAME> on her guardian ' s arm .
Almost as much a stranger here as you , though born here , I came from <NAME> a little while ago .
What did <NAME> say ? ' ' Oh , a likely thing , sir , that I am going to tell you everything , and be told nothing !
My <NAME> 's state has a hollow look , thus gloomy and abandoned ; and in the inner apartment , where <NAME> last night made his secret perquisition , the traces of her dresses and her ornaments , even the mirrors accustomed to reflect them when they were a portion of herself , have a desolate and vacant air .
He yielded to my view of the matter , when convinced that I was honestly in earnest ; and so , with his full consent , I start to-morrow morning .
They looked tempting ; eight in number , circularly set out on a white plate on a tray covered with a white napkin , flanked by a slice of buttered <NAME> roll , and a little compact glass of cool wine and water ; but she resisted all persuasions , and sent them down again -- placing the act to her credit , no doubt , in her Eternal Day-Book .
Their upper house-maid , which is lady ' s- maid too , told me all about it over the wash-house palin ' s before the family was out of bed , one mornin ' . ' ' Wot , the wery next door to you ? ' said <NAME> .
I could not find that he was worse than I .
' Oh pray come to me , <NAME> , do , do ! ' But <NAME> , mistrusting the acceptability of her presence to the higher powers , had not yet gone ; and we were all benighted in the Desert of <NAME> .
They come to a building in the yard with an office on an upper floor .
The attendant did as she was told : shaking her head meanwhile , to intimate that the woman would not die so easily ; having done so , she resumed her seat by the side of the other nurse , who had by this time returned .
' On such an occasion I will give you , <NAME> , ' said Mrs. Micawber , ' in a little more flip , ' for we had been having some already , ' the memory of my papa and mama. ' ' Are they dead , ma ' am ? ' I inquired , after drinking the toast in a wine-glass .
I would die to help you .
' We tied his legs under the apron and made ' em fast to the chaise , to prevent his giving us the slip again. ' With hands trembling with delight , <NAME> unloosened the cord ; and <NAME> , to all appearance more dead than alive , was brought into the house and securely locked up in a cellar , until such time as <NAME> should deem it expedient to operate upon him , in presence of the assembled school .
urges <NAME> , raising his voice a little ; but on his friend 's once more warning him , " I tell you , you ca n't speak too low , " he repeats his question without any sound at all , forming with his lips only the words , " What do you know ? "
That I was lost in blissful delirium .
The cloud settled upon the picture , and concealed it from the sexton ' s view .
<NAME> , my dear <NAME> -- brother Ned , sir , is a perfect lion .
' The snuff-coloured suit , ' said <NAME> , surveying a threadbare coat .
He married -- an <NAME> lady -- and I was one of the trustees .
We used to keep such hours !
said the old lady , suiting the action to the word ; 'you do n't see it now , at all events . '
It looks better. ' ' Mr Rugg , ' said <NAME> , in his dejection , ' my only wish is , that it should be over .
I could repeat the words in my mind , and I knew what they meant of themselves , but I attached no meaning to them in any other connexion .
<NAME> <NAME> ' s the man , <NAME> .
' Wot ' s the matter now ? ' ' Have a cup of tea , there ' s a good soul , ' replied the buxom female coaxingly .
' <NAME> , ' returned <NAME> with dignity , ' I accept the altered phrase .
<NAME> ' t try to go confounding the rights and wrongs of things in that way .
" <NAME> , indeed , " said she , " by another visit from the wards in <NAME> !
Upon my soul , I half believe he escaped in his terror , to get quit of me , not knowing it was me as had got ashore .
They had not traversed many steps of the long main staircase when he stopped , and stared at the roof and round at the walls .
Tell me what it was. ' ' I rather grieve -- I _do_ rather grieve to think , ' said the child , bursting into tears , ' that those who die about us , are so soon forgotten. ' ' And do you think , ' said the schoolmaster , marking the glance she had thrown around , ' that an unvisited grave , a withered tree , a faded flower or two , are tokens of forgetfulness or cold neglect ?
He collected the rents of whole colonies of filthy streets and alleys by the waterside , advanced money to the seamen and petty officers of merchant vessels , had a share in the ventures of divers mates of <NAME> , smoked his smuggled cigars under the very nose of the <NAME> , and made appointments on ' Change with men in glazed hats and round jackets pretty well every day .
' You ' ll find it much pleasanter , <NAME> , ' urged another stout gentleman , who strongly resembled the other half of the roll of flannel aforesaid .
Perhaps it is. ' <NAME> might very probably have reasoned himself into the belief that it really was , had he not , just then happening to look out of the coach window , observed that the looks of the passengers betokened anything but respectful astonishment , and that various telegraphic communications appeared to be passing between them and some persons outside the vehicle , whereupon it occurred to him that these demonstrations might be , in some remote degree , referable to the humorous deportment of <NAME> .
As he sat at his platter and mug , <NAME> saw him , again and yet again , steal a look at the neckerchief , as if he were correcting his slow observation and prompting his sluggish memory .
Take this light ; go softly up the steps straight afore you , and along the little hall , to the street door ; unfasten it , and let us in . '
Buy one of my pictures , and I assure you , in confidence , it will not be worth the money .
Taking her eyes off the book , to test her memory of something in it , <NAME> was the first to see herself observed .
In this pensive , wayward , and uncertain state , people are apt to lounge and loiter without knowing why , to read placards on the walls with great attention and without the smallest idea of one word of their contents , and to stare most earnestly through shop-windows at things which they don ' t see .
' Kinder and kinder than I can tell .
I did not know how it was , but though there were only two of us , we were at once always cramped for room , and yet had always room enough to lose everything in .
The Major was to take the responsibility of ordering everything to eat and drink ; and they were to have a late breakfast together every morning , and a late dinner together every day .
But I may as well tell you that I can find nothing the matter with Mr Merdle .
We must trust to you and time to set him right . "
We are all going to the play , or coming home from it .
She has a fine face -- originally of a character that would be rather called very pretty than handsome , but improved into classicality by the acquired expression of her fashionable state .
Tradesmen ' s books hunger , and tradesmen ' s mouths water , for the gold dust of the <NAME> .
My aunt , with every sort of expression but wonder discharged from her countenance , sat on the gravel , staring at me , until I began to cry ; when she got up in a great hurry , collared me , and took me into the parlour .
' But , bless you , ' pursued <NAME> , ' if you could have seen him of a night , at that time of it !
I gets my living by the sweat of my brow , and it ' s good enough for ME. ' This had a modest self-denying appearance ; but it soon turned out that as , by reason of the impossibility of standing the glass upright while there was anything in it , it required to be emptied as soon as filled , Mr <NAME> managed to drink in the proportion of three to one .
Seeing from this , that it was no private document ; and as it seemed to relate to <NAME> , and was very short : <NAME> unfolded it , lighted his bedroom candle that it might burn up well by the time he finished ; and drawing his chair nearer the fire , read as follows -- ' Less than two hundred years ago , on one of the public baths in this city , there appeared an inscription in honour of its mighty founder , the renowned Prince Bladud .
These completed , and the two alone again , it was pleasant to see ( or would have been , if there had been any one to see it , which there never was ) , the old lady standing to say the <NAME> ' s <NAME> aloud , and her son , <NAME> nevertheless , standing with bent head to hear it , he being within five years of forty : much as he had stood to hear the same words from the same lips when he was within five months of four .
No ; yet something like it .
' Ha ha ! ' he would cry .
echoed the Jew , leaning back in his chair .
I said to <NAME> before leaving home just now to come to you -- of course the first friend I have seen on a subject so momentous to me , my dear Twemlow -- I said to <NAME> , " We must work. " ' ' You were right , you were right , ' replies <NAME> .
The ' young feller ' complying , Mr <NAME> put his hands in his pockets , and tried to look as if he were not minding the pony , but happened to be lounging there by accident .
If he forces us to it , they 'll be producible , wo n't they ? "
Their objects were as various as their demands .
But all that I have to say in this way , I have said .
When she did look up , the expression was not there .
" I know nothing of his life .
" Thankee ! " said <NAME> , rubbing his hands .
I am happy to see you .
No one who can read , ever looks at a book , even unopened on a shelf , like one who can not .
But the craft , the secrecy , the dark deep underhanded plotting , written in Mrs <NAME> ' s countenance , make me shudder. ' As an incontrovertible proof that those baleful attributes were all there , <NAME> shuddered on the spot .
" Or unless she fancies it 's blood , " said the woman .
Do you hear ? -- -His life ! ' Mrs. <NAME> , fallen back stiffly in her chair , and making no sound but a moan , cast her eyes upon her with a wide stare .
He held no station among the Hands who could make speeches and carry on debates .
" But to pass from one subject to another , " resumes <NAME> .
I mean , I am the more easily to be trusted ; and any little constraint that you might feel with another , may vanish before me .
Seeing , or fancying , that I was suspected of an intention of carrying poison to him , I asked to be searched before I sat down at his bedside , and told the officer who was always there , that I was willing to do anything that would assure him of the singleness of my designs .
And above all , my dear , be sure you promise me your vote and interest and all sorts of plumpers for Pocket-Breaches ; for we couldn ' t think of spending sixpence on it , my love , and can only consent to be brought in by the spontaneous thingummies of the incorruptible whatdoyoucallums .
I 'll go a little further with you ; I 'll say something more. " He bent down so low to frown at his boots , that he was able to rub the calves of his legs in the pause he made .
Let me tell you , <NAME> has done without ' em ! ' ' What a load you take from my mind ! ' cried <NAME> .
I thought he had been dead ! ' ' Dead to me , ' returned my aunt , ' but living. ' I sat in silent amazement .
' What are you looking at ?
He took it in one of his , and kissed it , and withdrew .
They were both overturned in a stage-coach the other day ( a bad omen anywhere else , where overturns are not so common ) , and his head , which bears the marks of a recent wound , is bound up still .
I walked past the house , and took several turns in the street , with that kind of hesitation which is natural to a man who is conscious that the visit he is about to pay is unexpected , and may not be very acceptable .
If it only puts him in the vein to leave his poor clerk fifty pounds , that 's something ; and I think I shook him yesterday . "
cried <NAME> , raising his voice .
I believe there has been in <NAME> , since the days of the <NAME> , no law so often infamously administered , no law so often openly violated , no law habitually so ill-supervised .
If you had only sent in to me when they were here !
I have never dreamed of the change in our fortunes itself ; I have never dreamed of your coming back with me that memorable morning to break it ; I have never even dreamed of you .
' I am not certain , of course , ' said <NAME> , amidst profound silence and looks of general dismay ; ' but his manner to me this moment really was very alarming .
' An acquisition indeed. ' As Mrs. Vincent <NAME> recrossed back to the table , there bounded on to the stage from some mysterious inlet , a little girl in a dirty white frock with tucks up to the knees , short trousers , sandaled shoes , white spencer , pink gauze bonnet , green veil and curl papers ; who turned a pirouette , cut twice in the air , turned another pirouette , then , looking off at the opposite wing , shrieked , bounded forward to within six inches of the footlights , and fell into a beautiful attitude of terror , as a shabby gentleman in an old pair of buff slippers came in at one powerful slide , and chattering his teeth , fiercely brandished a walking-stick .
It is such a beautiful place ! ' ' Is it ? ' ' It is like the inside of the most exquisite ship that ever sailed .
" I did n't mean to say anything about it , for it 's not birthday talk , but you have got it out of me , you see , before I sit down .
All the best means are at once in action , and everybody present lends a hand , and a heart and soul .
What did he say ? ' ' Oh you know what papa is , ' rejoined <NAME> , ' and how aggravatingly he sits looking beautiful and turning his thumbs over and over one another till he makes one giddy if one keeps one ' s eyes upon him , he said when we were talking of you -- I don ' t know who began the subject <NAME> ( <NAME> and <NAME> ) but I am sure it wasn ' t me , at least I hope not but you really must excuse my confessing more on that point. ' ' Certainly , ' said <NAME> .
She had a crowd of cousins and acquaintances , and we had dances at her house , and went out to dances at other houses , and , both at home and out , she tormented my love beyond endurance .
But the greatest effect in these miserable lessons is when my mother ( thinking nobody is observing her ) tries to give me the cue by the motion of her lips .
I doubt if he had ever once thought of it before .
Go to my lawyer ( you remember where ; you have been there before ) and show your independence now , will you ?
The kindnesses you have secretly done for his advancement , and then disclosed to me , for my surprise and pleasure , have been , you will believe , but aggravations of the unhappiness and burden of my secret. ' She sunk down gently at the <NAME> ' s feet , though he did his utmost to prevent her ; and said , looking up , tearfully , into his face : ' Do not speak to me yet !
cried Mrs. Mann , starting back .
In a word , I was at liberty to do what I would , for three weeks or a month ; and no other conditions were imposed upon my freedom than the before-mentioned thinking and looking about me , and a pledge to write three times a week and faithfully report myself .
I have been thinking that the law is the boy for me . "
I knew a better way of going to work .
I will remain in the house in which it placed me , until I am entitled to leave it by the terms of my engagement ; though , mind , I see these men no more .
You repent of your determination now , do you ? ' ' My determination ! ' said <NAME> .
Yet the bells , when they sounded , told me sorrowfully of change in everything ; told me of their own age , and my pretty <NAME> ' s youth ; and of the many , never old , who had lived and loved and died , while the reverberations of the bells had hummed through the rusty armour of the <NAME> Prince hanging up within , and , motes upon the deep of <NAME> , had lost themselves in air , as circles do in water .
I should put 'em down at the figures of about eight and ten . "
' Do you see this ? ' He showed me that it was covered with manuscript , very closely and laboriously written ; but so plainly , that as I looked along the lines , I thought I saw some allusion to King Charles the <NAME> ' s head again , in one or two places .
Do you know , <NAME> , he improves ? " " I said to you I thought he was softened when I last saw him. " " So you did .
The sister was so apt a pupil , and the dancing-master had such abundant leisure to bestow upon her ( for it took him a matter of ten weeks to set to his creditors , lead off , turn the <NAME> , and right and left back to his professional pursuits ) , that wonderful progress was made .
But <NAME> , in a spiritless unhappy way , only went whither she was led , and seemed to have no care for anything .
' ' Twas kind of you to meet me .
He had got at the core of that mystery now , he told us , and nothing could be plainer than that the will under which he and <NAME> were to take I do n't know how many thousands of pounds must be finally established if there were any sense or justice in the Court of Chancery -- but oh , what a great IF that sounded in my ears -- and that this happy conclusion could not be much longer delayed .
The cart is shaken all to pieces , and the rugged road is very near its end .
I happened to turn my eyes towards this place , as I was thinking of many things ; and I saw a figure beyond , dressed in a plain cloak .
We shall meet again soon .
" His son 's name is the same , you know , " said I .
And the <NAME> whistled , and stared , and wondered , and dodged about his room , and could make nothing of it .
The brothers give a Banquet on a great <NAME> .
' Nothing could be better , ' said the father-in-law , rubbing his hands .
' It would be particularly comfortable , I think , ' replied <NAME> .
I never knew such a thing .
When I had got rid of him , which I thought it well to do without prolonging explanations , my mind was much troubled by these two circumstances taken together .
I heard that <NAME> was not a bad sort of fellow , but hadn ' t a sixpence to bless himself with ; and that there was no doubt that old Mrs. Mell , his mother , was as poor as job .
On the man ' s stumbling into the room , <NAME> rose to leave it .
' And you have -- when you catch it -- the <NAME> .
Think how soon it will be over. ' ' How soon it will be over ! ' he repeats gloomily .
From these pilgrimages to the jug and basin , he returned with such eccentricities of damp headgear as no words can describe ; which were made the more ludicrous by his anxious gravity .
Throws his lordship 's papers into the fire , my dear , if he wo n't pay the jeweller ! "
<NAME> <NAME> wanted 'em and got 'em , but I looked 'em over first .
' As to <NAME> , that young man of mine , ' said Mr Boffin , dropping his voice and glancing towards the door with an apprehension of being overheard by some eavesdropper there , ' it ' s the same with him as with the footmen .
By the <NAME> , it ' s a great name ! ' said the Major , solemnly .
' You have been betrayed , as all betrayers are .
And in due course there was bed ; where , but for that resumption of the studies which took place in dreams , were rest and sweet forgetfulness .
Why , he was a poor creature to be taken by that delicate mock-modesty , and that hanging head ! ' ' Oh , for <NAME> ' s sake , spare me ! ' exclaimed <NAME> .
" This is very discouraging , " said I .
No matter , <NAME> ; that would never do .
' What do you say , <NAME> ? ' inquired Mrs. Squeers .
' Mr Clennam , will he pay all his debts before he leaves here ? ' ' No doubt .
The landlady , by no means satisfied with this assurance , which she considered an ingenious evasion of the question , rejoined that he had his reasons of course .
You <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , bending her brows upon him angrily , ' you <NAME> ' s clerk !
<NAME> was , when a poet sat upon a stool in a public place , and mused in the sight of men .
She would love him dearly if he would suffer her , but he will not -- though for no fault of hers ; and she is greatly to be loved and pitied by all gentle hearts. ' More of the flowers that <NAME> held fell scattering on the ground ; those that remained were wet , but not with dew ; and her face dropped upon her laden hands .
This the landlady of the Break of Day chirpingly explained , calling between whiles , ' Hola , my husband ! ' out at the side door .
' What is the matter ? ' said <NAME> to the boy .
' Why , here , ' said Mrs. Markleham , taking a letter from the chimney-piece above the <NAME> ' s head , ' the dear fellow says to the Doctor himself -- where is it ?
( Captain <NAME> 's claret to your mistress , <NAME> ! )
Your money has changed you to marble .
Taking his hands from the seat , and placing one of them within the other , as he settled himself on one leg , <NAME> proceeded , with his eyes cast down , and his respectable head a little advanced , and a little on one side : ' The young woman went on in this manner for some time , being occasionally low in her spirits , until I think she began to weary <NAME> by giving way to her low spirits and tempers of that kind ; and things were not so comfortable .
What has my uncle heard from <NAME> ? ' Newman opened and shut his mouth , several times , as though he were trying his utmost to speak , but could make nothing of it , and finally fixed his eyes on <NAME> with a grim and ghastly stare .
And what ' s more , -- he ' s in luck again , by <NAME> if he ain ' t ! ' Cold on the shore , in the raw cold of that leaden crisis in the four-and-twenty hours when the vital force of all the noblest and prettiest things that live is at its lowest , the three watchers looked each at the blank faces of the other two , and all at the blank face of <NAME> in his boat .
I should soon have made you a friendly visit. ' ' Ah ! ' said <NAME> , tossing her head .
<NAME> , with her innocent little scream , supposes so .
In the moment when I was withdrawing my head to go quietly away , I saw a great flaming light spring up .
There was not the right taste about the premature productions , and they didn ' t keep well .
My humour is not a trifling one , and my acknowledgment will be severe. ' ' Oh a proud , hard gentleman ! ' chuckled the old woman , shaking her head , and rubbing her shrivelled hands , ' oh hard , hard , hard !
<NAME> don ' t hurt the creature who is so fond of you !
Because she must have known whether it did or not .
* * * * * 'Stone dead ! '
The sprightly <NAME> , whose sprightliness was very much diminished by the salutation , looked exceedingly dismayed , and said , with the water rising in his eyes : ' Oh !
' What -- the -- deyvle ! ' With which broken ejaculations , he fixed his glass in his eye , and stared at <NAME> in great surprise .
She restrained her tears by a great effort until she was alone upstairs , and then gave them vent .
Far in this den of infamous resort , there was a low-browed , beetling shop , below a pent-house roof , where iron , old rags , bottles , bones , and greasy offal , were bought .
Still , <NAME> , sir , I must stipulate that if you have any word with me , that word is spoken in the presence of my friend . "
<NAME> and <NAME> were lingering for a few moments by the fire , wondering whether Mrs. <NAME> had yet finished her dictation for the day , when <NAME> , who had been out of the room , returned .
<NAME> , both refer to Mr Clennam .
In busier periods of the year these bills disappear , and the houses swarm with legislators .
I light it -- draw one puff -- breathe the smoke out -- there it goes -- it ' s Dolls ! -- it ' s gone -- and being gone you are a man again. ' ' Your subject , ' said <NAME> , after lighting a cigar , and comforting himself with a whiff or two , ' was scouts , Eugene. ' ' Exactly .
' <NAME> down , sir , ' said Mr Boffin , shaking hands with him .
" I begin to think I must be a swell in the <NAME> without knowing it . "
Mr <NAME> came on the scene last , for he was always late , and so were the frequenters always late ; all hands being bound to be made late , by private information about the <NAME> , and <NAME> and <NAME> and <NAME> and <NAME> and par and premium and discount and three quarters and seven eighths .
Unmindful of her stealthy tread , her victim holds his course in fancied triumph .
In this world you need meet no more . '
<NAME> was ever on any account to give anybody anything , or render anybody help without purchase .
Morning after morning they roamed about the town together , pursuing this singular research .
After some rubbing of the lower part of his face , and some looking at us with those bad eyes , over his grisly fingers , he made one more address to me , half whining , and half abusive .
After several times falling short of my destination and as often overshooting it , I came unexpectedly round a corner , upon <NAME> .
He could pave the way , he said , in half an hour , and then they would go down to <NAME> .
I wouldn ' t cry ! ' <NAME> , to which Messrs. Bounderby and <NAME> now walked , was a triumph of fact ; it had no greater taint of fancy in it than Mrs. Gradgrind herself .
You had no such thing in contemplation when I was with you. ' ' No , ' replied <NAME> , ' I hadn ' t then .
" I was standing by a minute , on the chance of company. " " You are late , " I remarked .
' I don ' t know of what—of everything , I think. ' ' Say not another word , ' returned <NAME> .
' To London. ' ' Have you any home to go to ? ' ' I think I have a mother .
' If so , he ought to know best. ' ' No , my dear ; nor it ain ' t that , neither .
He gladly agreed to hire it .
But , when his nephew , leaning an elbow on the table , covered his eyes thoughtfully and dejectedly with his hand , the fine mask looked at him sideways with a stronger concentration of keenness , closeness , and dislike , than was comportable with its wearer 's assumption of indifference .
The wind carried away the striking of the great multitude of city church clocks , for those lay to leeward of them ; but there were bells to windward that told them of its being One -- Two -- Three .
The healthy , strong- made man , who could have borne almost any fatigue of active exertion , was wasting beneath the close confinement and unhealthy atmosphere of a crowded prison .
' He must be a very weak , and foolish , and inconsiderate man , ' said Mrs. Nickleby ; ' blamable indeed -- at least I suppose other people would consider him so ; of course I can ' t be expected to express any opinion on that point , especially after always defending your poor dear papa when other people blamed him for making proposals to me ; and to be sure there can be no doubt that he has taken a very singular way of showing it .
<NAME> exchanged his dreamy posture for his accustomed business attitude : the face of <NAME> disappeared , and the train of thought took to flight , all simultaneously , and in an instant .
In such scenes and occupations the time wore on until nine o ' clock , when <NAME> , jaded and dispirited with the occurrences of the day , hastened from the confinement of the workroom , to join her mother at the street corner , and walk home : -- the more sadly , from having to disguise her real feelings , and feign to participate in all the sanguine visions of her companion .
' Why do you answer it ? ' was his reception of his brother .
I think if you could see her now -- if you would go and see her -- she would move your admiration and compassion. ' The <NAME> inclined his head , and showed his teeth , as who should say , in answer to some careless small-talk , ' Dear me !
And then he showed me , proved by elaborate calculations in his pocket-book , that supposing he had contracted , say , two hundred pounds of debt in six months out of the army ; and that he contracted no debt at all within a corresponding period in the army -- as to which he had quite made up his mind ; this step must involve a saving of four hundred pounds in a year , or two thousand pounds in five years , which was a considerable sum .
' I mean the gentleman up-stairs , ' said <NAME> , turning to <NAME> .
I know you send me away for my good. ' ' O , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> above us knows I do ! ' ' Yes yes .
<NAME> not yet appearing , which induced me to apprehend that he must be ill , I left the <NAME> early on the third day , and walked out to <NAME> .
The people of the house knew what to do ; the proper authorities were soon brought ; and they took an equable business-like possession of the deceased , and of what had been his property , with no greater disturbance of manner or countenance than usually attends the winding-up of a clock .
Stretched upon a mattress on the floor , lay <NAME> , fast asleep .
" Ah ! " said the girl ; " but you see she don't. " She said it so finally , and in such an undiscussible way , that <NAME> , though in a condition of ruffled dignity , could not protest .
<NAME> up , you crabbed image for the sign of a walking-stick shop , and say you saw him put it there ! "
' I have been in the habit of thinking that there was nothing wanting to be done for him ; that it was all settled and over ; in short , of not thinking at all about it .
But unless I had taken the life of <NAME> 's boy on that occasion , I really do not even now see what I could have done save endure .
Not <NAME> ? ' Then a second handsome face appearing .
He was the herald of the family procession .
<NAME> , I ' ll not ask that lady whether she believes what she has said , even in the anger and ill blood in which I and my friend here equally know she has spoken , though she subdues herself , with a determination that any one who has once seen her is not likely to forget .
<NAME> and <NAME> , together , upset the whole house directly .
" I see that I hold a sanctuary in their hearts , and in the hearts of their descendants , generations hence .
Mind my words , it shall be done. ' ' But how ? ' said <NAME> .
'It is never too late , ' said <NAME> , 'for penitence and atonement . '
I do not know how their cool rejections may taste within the hammocks , but , having experience , I can report that , out of them , the mounds of ices and the bowls of mint-julep and sherry-cobbler they make in these latitudes , are refreshments never to be thought of afterwards , in summer , by those who would preserve contented minds .
You are quite aware of that ? " " Quite , sir. " " I communicated to <NAME> -- in <NAME> -- when he first wrote to me -- from <NAME> -- the caution that he must not expect me ever to deviate from the strict line of fact .
Two other passengers , besides the one , were plodding up the hill by the side of the mail .
" May be , I have not . "
How should he , <NAME> , meet the eye of old <NAME> at the next quarter-sessions !
What is wanting to it ? ' ' You -- you shall be informed in the other interview. ' Then he said , as if in a burst of irrepressible despair , ' I -- I leave it all incomplete !
' Yes. ' Then she uncovered her head , and letting her cloak and hood fall where they might , stood looking at him : so colourless , so dishevelled , so defiant and despairing , that he was afraid of her .
While he was thus employed his features gradually relaxed into what was with him a cheerful smile , but which in any other man would have been a ghastly grin of pain , and when the child looked up again she found that he was regarding her with extraordinary favour and complacency .
' That is all you know of him from the fellow-prisoner ? ' ' In substance , all. ' ' And was the fellow-prisoner his accomplice and a murderer , too ?
' Dear boy , I know it , but I can ' t give it .
' And now , my own dear <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' if , while you ' re a prentice , you should want any money to spend ; or if , when you ' re out of your time , my dear , you should want any to set you up ( and you must do one or other , or both , my darling ) ; who has such a good right to ask leave to lend it you , as my sweet girl ' s own old stupid me ! ' I was not so savagely independent as to say anything in reply , but that if ever I borrowed money of anyone , I would borrow it of her .
He would have walked in , and was in the very act of doing so , indeed , when catching sight of <NAME> , he involuntarily shrank back a pace or two , and stood gazing on the unexpected scene before him , perfectly motionless with amazement and terror .
<NAME> , who was now in a professor 's house in <NAME> , was able to be with us less frequently than before ; my guardian still maintained the same reserve ; and so time passed until the commission was obtained and <NAME> received directions with it to join a regiment in <NAME> .
Do I understand that you will take her with you ? "
In every Public Institution , the right of the people to attend , and to have an interest in the proceedings , is most fully and distinctly recognised .
The woman ' s was the first reached .
My dear , do n't you give your mind to that again , or I shall link your feet together at the ankles . "
Worse than that , we found such an unusual crowd in the Court of Chancery that it was full to the door , and we could neither see nor hear what was passing within .
I was bad enough there , but I have been so much worse here .
Can anybody doubt how all this has been brought about ? ' ' I should scarcely think they could , ' said <NAME> mildly .
' <NAME> finds it so , ' she returned .
<NAME> , will you step with us into the next room for a moment ? ' <NAME> assented , and the quartette walked into an empty apartment .
" Friend and legal adviser , " said <NAME> .
He looked in a hurried manner at the graves , then anxiously at the child , then pressed her to his side , and bade her stop to rest .
In its small proportions , it was not unlike the kind of place usually assigned to a gate-porter in <NAME> .
Oh ! " " Ah-h-h ! " growled the journeyman , between his teeth , " I 'd hold you , if you was my wife .
I had not considered how I could thank him , my gratitude lying too deep in my heart for that ; but I now began to consider how I could meet him without thanking him , and felt it would be very difficult indeed .
" No , you do n't do yourself justice .
Sooth to say , poor <NAME> had better reason for his tears than sons of that age often have , for he had lost his second mother -- his first , so far as he knew -- by a stroke as sudden as that natural affliction which had darkened the beginning of his life .
<NAME> made the same impatient gesture with her crouching shoulders , in reply ; and he was glad and happy .
' I said that theer was on ' y one thing furder , ' he proceeded with a grave smile , when he had made up his little bundle again , and put it in his pocket ; ' but theer was two .
It was a cold hard easterly morning when he latched the garden gate and turned away .
' They have some business here ; and I took advantage of their coming , to come too .
Do you hear ? ' she added , waiting with some apparent inconsistency FOR an answer .
To which <NAME> says , " Who 's conspiring ? "
The <NAME> saw that it would be hopeless to affect any further mistake regarding the reality of <NAME> 's rage ; and , shrinking involuntarily back a few paces , cast a glance , half imploring and half cowardly , at <NAME> : as if to hint that he was the fittest person to pursue the dialogue .
Which he did with his boots on , and an umbrella under his arm .
You ' ve seen this gentleman before , I think ? ' <NAME> shook hands with <NAME> , and his friends followed his example .
However , they were grown up and had their own way , and they made the most of it .
' Let him look to that !
At about this time , too , I made three discoveries : first , that Mrs. <NAME> was a martyr to a curious disorder called ' the spazzums ' , which was generally accompanied with inflammation of the nose , and required to be constantly treated with peppermint ; secondly , that something peculiar in the temperature of my pantry , made the brandy-bottles burst ; thirdly , that I was alone in the world , and much given to record that circumstance in fragments of <NAME> versification .
Bending over a steaming vessel of tea , and looking through the steam , and breathing forth the steam , like a malignant <NAME> enchantress engaged in the performance of unholy rites , Mr F. ' s <NAME> put down her great teacup and exclaimed , ' Drat him , if he an ' t come back again ! ' It would seem from the foregoing exclamation that this uncompromising relative of the lamented Mr F. , measuring time by the acuteness of her sensations and not by the clock , supposed <NAME> to have lately gone away ; whereas at least a quarter of a year had elapsed since he had had the temerity to present himself before her .
cries <NAME> , who has started from his chair and unaccountably begun to sidle away .
Of which remarkable gentlewoman it may be finally observed , that there surely never was a gentlewoman of whose transcendent fitness for any vacant appointment on the face of this earth , so many people were ( as the warmth of her Testimonials evinced ) so perfectly satisfied -- or who was so very unfortunate in having a large circle of ardent and distinguished admirers , who never themselves happened to want her in any capacity .
The Jews with the fifty-bladed penknives shut them up in despair ; the men with the pocket-books made pocket-books of them .
It was so with all of us , but with no one more than <NAME> : the development of whose inclination to gird in a grudging and suspicious way at the rest , was screwed out of him before the fish was taken off .
' I said , now candidly , ' Mr <NAME> explained , a little put out .
A big , loud man , with a stare , and a metallic laugh .
At home , in my own room , I am sometimes moved to cry out , ' Oh , <NAME> ! ' in a transport of love .
' The reaction , my lord , the reaction , ' said <NAME> .
You ' re hammer and tongs , already , you two ? ' he said , coolly stroking his face .
If the inkstand had been where the old gentleman thought it was , he would have dipped his pen into it , and signed the indentures , and <NAME> would have been straightway hurried off .
It was difficult , however , to be sure of this ; the <NAME> having no trace of expression in his face when sober .
I never saw in any face there , thank heaven , on my birthday , that it would have been better if I had never been born .
I am very impressible myself , by nature .
I was so , when I first saw you making the mistake of not leaving us alone ; because I perceived that you were inexperienced and sanguine , and had -- I hope you ' ll not object to my saying -- some simplicity ? ' ' Not at all. ' ' Some simplicity .
' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' have the goodness to step downstairs. ' ' <NAME> ' nly , sir , ' replied <NAME> ; and acting on <NAME> ' s gentle hint , <NAME> retired .
I pass the greater part of the long vacation here .
In case the accompanying paper is not legally written , it matters very little , for there is no one interested but you and he , and my plain wish is , that if he is living he should have what little there may be , and if ( as I fear ) otherwise , that you should have it , <NAME> .
When we had passed the village and the church and the churchyard , and were out on the marshes and began to see the sails of the ships as they sailed on , I began to combine <NAME> and <NAME> with the prospect , in my usual way .
I was afraid I had said something shocking .
" You had a child once , whom you loved and lost. " A stronger pressure on my hand .
The languid stillness of the place was only broken by the chirping of this fire and by the voice of one of the <NAME> , who was wandering slowly through a perfect library of evidence , and stopping to put up , from time to time , at little roadside inns of argument on the journey .
'You do n't mean to say he died ? '
" I rose in life that way . "
Very , very , strong feelings. ' With a shaking hand , <NAME> took out his handkerchief and wiped his brow .
' I mean , <NAME> , what can it do ? ' returned <NAME> , folding his arms ( they were hardly long enough to fold ) , and looking at the fire , and up at him , and at the fire , and up at him again .
<NAME> was there , sitting by the bed .
She laughs and talks , and seems to like it .
And now a surprise occurred , so overwhelming and terrific that <NAME> , unsupported by the presence of <NAME> , must have sunk beneath it , and been a lost man from that fatal hour .
That I swear. ' ' You needn ' t take the trouble of swearing , ' said Mr Lammle to the skeleton ; ' once more , it doesn ' t matter .
On Friday the Ninth of June in the present year , Mr and <NAME> ( in their manuscript dress of receiving Mr and <NAME> at breakfast ) were on the <NAME> Railway with me , in a terribly destructive accident .
If I could ever set this right !
His only trouble was , the swift and rapid river .
' What a prophet you have shown yourself , <NAME> ! ' pursued <NAME> .
Some future traveller , visiting , from motives of curiosity , not unmingled , let us hope , with sympathy , the place of confinement allotted to debtors in this city , may , and I trust will , <NAME> , as he traces on its wall , inscribed with a rusty nail , ' The obscure initials , ' P.S .
<NAME> toast and warm tea offered him every night and morning when he couldn ' t swallow anything -- a candle in his bedroom on the very night he died -- the best dictionary sent up for him to lay his head upon -- I don ' t regret it though .
" I am inclined to think , " returned my guardian , " that <NAME> has seen too much of the effects of the court and the cause to exert any influence in their favour .
I saw it move a little more , and a hand softly interpose to keep it open .
The shoes that had so often tumbled off by the way , he preserved in his own room ; and , sitting in the little back parlour of an evening , he had drawn a whole gallery of fancy portraits of <NAME> Mrs <NAME> .
It was never so well worth your while to get me out of this country as it is to-night .
' I point out to you , sir , with indignation , that -- hum -- the -- ha -- delicacy and peculiarity of your father ' s position should strike you dumb , sir , if nothing else should , in laying down such -- ha -- such unnatural principles .
It was a strangely unreal ride through the old squalid streets , with a sensation of being raised out of them into an airy world of wealth and grandeur .
Not being prepared , however , it alarmed him the more ; so away he went like the wind , with the old gentleman and the two boys roaring and shouting behind him .
With his very ears a bright purple shot with crimson , he pent up his indignation , however , and said : ' You ' d like to keep her here for a time ? ' ' I—I had intended to recommend , my dear Bounderby , that you should allow <NAME> to remain here on a visit , and be attended by <NAME> ( I mean of course <NAME> ) , who understands her , and in whom she trusts. ' ' I gather from all this , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , standing up with his hands in his pockets , ' that you are of opinion that there ' s what people call some incompatibility between <NAME> and myself. ' ' I fear there is at present a general incompatibility between <NAME> , and—and—and almost all the relations in which I have placed her , ' was her father ' s sorrowful reply .
Even the male performers stopped in their conversation , and echoed the word ' Going ! ' although some among them ( and they had been the loudest in their congratulations that day ) winked at each other as though they would not be sorry to lose such a favoured rival ; an opinion , indeed , which the honest <NAME> , who was ready dressed for the savage , openly stated in so many words to a demon with whom he was sharing a pot of porter .
When <NAME> was released , you , his old domestic , had the charge of him , I know .
After resuming her place at his side , and tenderly touching his hands and his head , she said : ' <NAME> , dear , you made me go out , but I ought to have stayed with you .
Her visitor watched her as she did so .
" Why is it best , sir ? "
As a means towards his composure and self-possession , he entered into a more minute examination of the office than he had yet had time to make ; looked into the wig-box , the books , and ink-bottle ; untied and inspected all the papers ; carved a few devices on the table with a sharp blade of Mr <NAME> ' s penknife ; and wrote his name on the inside of the wooden coal-scuttle .
Is it yet coming on ? ' ' Why , no , sir , ' retorted Mr Flintwinch .
<NAME> , there are about seven hundred thieves in this town who know all about that watch ; there 's not a man , a woman , or a child , among them , who would n't identify the smallest link in that chain , and drop it as if it was red hot , if inveigled into touching it. " At first with such discourse , and afterwards with conversation of a more general nature , did <NAME> and I beguile the time and the road , until he gave me to understand that we had arrived in the district of <NAME> .
Touch him upon money , and you touch no booby then .
It is <NAME> , I think ; is it not ? ' ' Yes , sir , ' returned <NAME> .
<NAME> , I kiss your hand. ' ' We will shake hands , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , extending his , as old <NAME> bowed .
There , at the very core of <NAME> , in the heart of its business and animation , in the midst of a whirl of noise and motion : stemming as it were the giant currents of life that flow ceaselessly on from different quarters , and meet beneath its walls : stands <NAME> ; and in that crowded street on which it frowns so darkly -- within a few feet of the squalid tottering houses -- upon the very spot on which the vendors of soup and fish and damaged fruit are now plying their trades -- scores of human beings , amidst a roar of sounds to which even the tumult of a great city is as nothing , four , six , or eight strong men at a time , have been hurried violently and swiftly from the world , when the scene has been rendered frightful with excess of human life ; when curious eyes have glared from casement and house-top , and wall and pillar ; and when , in the mass of white and upturned faces , the dying wretch , in his all-comprehensive look of agony , has met not one -- not one -- that bore the impress of pity or compassion .
That ' s all over. ' The Father of the <NAME> glanced at a passing <NAME> with whom he was on friendly terms , as who should say , ' An enfeebled old man , this ; but he is my brother , sir , my brother , and the voice of <NAME> is potent ! ' and steered his brother clear of the handle of the pump by the threadbare sleeve .
<NAME> , old intriguer ? ' Jeremiah , with his eyes upon his mistress , made no reply .
And I begged and prayed my aunt -- I forget in what terms now , but I remember that they affected me very much then -- to befriend and protect me , for my father ' s sake .
We looked at one another , half laughing at our being like the children in the wood , when a curious little old woman in a squeezed bonnet and carrying a reticule came curtsying and smiling up to us with an air of great ceremony .
It seemed that he had several times opened his mouth when alone with <NAME> after dinner , as if he had something on his mind , but had always shut it again , to <NAME> 's extreme confusion , without saying anything .
Let all the lovers get out of the way , and talk among themselves , if they ' ve anything to say .
This letter will show how true I spoke , and they will be thankful for me. ' The Deputy Lock opened the letter with a grave face , which underwent no change as he eyed its contents .
There were two of the traitor ' s own blood -- his renounced brother and sister -- on whom the weight of his guilt rested almost more heavily , at this time , than on the man whom he had so deeply injured .
Therefore I make the entreaty I have now preferred , and I hope you will have sufficient consideration for me to accede to it . "
Do I never read how they grow heartsick of it and give it up , after having let themselves drop so low , and how they after all die out for want of help ?
' I hope so , ' replied the child .
' We understand _that a severe rencontre came off_ a few days since in the <NAME> , between Mr .
' Oh no ! ' ' That ' s well , ' remarked <NAME> .
' I hope , <NAME> , ' says <NAME> , who , in her instruction of the <NAME> family , has acquired an admonitorial tone , and a habit of improving passing occasions , ' that what has happened here , will be a warning to you , Towlinson. ' ' Thank you , <NAME> , I ' m sure , ' says <NAME> .
I hurried away to the parlour ; and there I found <NAME> , sitting at his breakfast with the cane and a newspaper before him , and Mrs. Creakle with an opened letter in her hand .
' Well , <NAME> ! ' said the Major .
It must often happen with miscellaneous ones. ' ' With ribs ( I grant you ) always .
It was with a heavy heart that <NAME> soon afterwards -- no , not retired ; there was no retirement there -- followed -- to his dirty and crowded dormitory .
But if you do need to be ; if you do truly feel at heart that you have indeed been towards me what you have called yourself to-night , and that there is nothing for us in this life but separation ; then Heaven help you , and <NAME> bless you ! ' The purity with which in these words she expressed something of her own love and her own suffering , made a deep impression on him for the passing time .
He has handed me the keys of all his books and papers -- here they are jingling in this pocket -- and the only charge he has given me is " Let Mr Clennam have the means of putting himself on a perfect equality with me as to knowing whatever I know .
He would come triumphantly flying out of <NAME> and <NAME> ahead of the lava , and would boil unharmed in the hot springs of <NAME> , and would float majestically down the <NAME> and the Nile .
' <NAME> won ' t be angry , but is happily married to Mr <NAME> , and didn ' t mention it beforehand to avoid words , and please tell darling you , and love to me , and I should like to know what you ' d have said if any other unmarried member of the family had done it ! ' He read the letter , and faintly exclaimed ' Dear me ! ' ' You may well say Dear me ! ' rejoined <NAME> , in a deep tone .
We want to brisk her up , and brisk her about , and give her a change. ' ' That ' s it ! ' said the open-hearted Mrs Boffin .
<NAME> zig-zags sprung into the cruel pattern sometimes , when she saw it through a burst of tears ; but beautified or hardened still , always over it and under it and through it , she was fain to look in her solitude , seeing everything with that ineffaceable brand .
And yet his interest in youth and hopefulness was not extinguished with the other embers of his soul , for he watched the boy ' s earnest countenance as he spoke with unusual sympathy , though with an inexplicable show of trouble and compassion , which escaped into his looks , however hard he strove to hold it prisoner .
' I must admit the wine .
We seem , to me , to have been months over <NAME> , and months more over the other stories .
' Then I tell you what , Mr Noggs , if you want to keep in the good books in that quarter , you had better not call her the old lady any more , for I suspect she wouldn ' t be best pleased to hear you .
We will look before we leap , and take plenty of time about it . "
In the first place , they have no mast , cordage , tackle , rigging , or other such boat-like gear ; nor have they anything in their shape at all calculated to remind one of a boat ' s head , stem , sides , or keel .
' Yes ; I have seen him twice. ' ' Isn ' t HE a charming creature ? ' ' Indeed he does not strike me as being so , by any means , ' replied <NAME> .
There really is no reason why I should hesitate to say that I know very well that any little delicacy I might have had in making a request to you is quite removed .
When I can run about again as I used to do , <NAME> , let us go and see those places where we were such a silly couple , shall we ?
She turned her head as the carriage came up to her , rose quickly , and presented herself at the carriage-door .
The object of her regret was not long in coming to her , for the news soon spread over the house that <NAME> had had a disturbance with <NAME> , and that they had both appealed to Mr Dombey , and that there had been an unprecedented piece of work in Mr <NAME> ' s room , and that <NAME> was going .
' You ' re a young traveller , my child , ' he said , laying his hand gently on her head .
These were additions to the list of entertaining incidents , but there was still another source of interest .
We shall be very glad to have you for a neighbour -- very glad ; delighted , I ' m sure -- but in any other character it ' s quite impossible , quite .
It ' s thought , down on the beach , she ' ll go to pieces every moment. ' The excited voice went clamouring along the staircase ; and I wrapped myself in my clothes as quickly as I could , and ran into the street .
She did not raise her head .
With a part of this , it would be necessary to buy some clothes , for she had none but those she wore .
<NAME> <NAME> walked on with long strides ; little Oliver , firmly grasping his gold-laced cuff , trotted beside him , inquiring at the end of every quarter of a mile whether they were 'nearly there . '
And the oncommonest workman ca n't show himself oncommon in a gridiron , -- for a gridiron IS a gridiron , " said <NAME> , steadfastly impressing it upon me , as if he were endeavouring to rouse me from a fixed delusion , " and you may haim at what you like , but a gridiron it will come out , either by your leave or again your leave , and you ca n't help yourself -- " " My dear <NAME> , " I cried , in desperation , taking hold of his coat , " do n't go on in that way .
Away , and still away , onward and onward ever : glimpses of cottage-homes , of houses , mansions , rich estates , of husbandry and handicraft , of people , of old roads and paths that look deserted , small , and insignificant as they are left behind : and so they do , and what else is there but such glimpses , in the track of the indomitable monster , <NAME> !
<NAME> that boy ; he ' s gone to sleep again .
When he was out of employment , I couldn ' t always keep him near me .
I apologise. ' ' Humbly and submissively ? ' said <NAME> .
<NAME> was to be a new boy after the vacation , and <NAME> had been busy , in Mr Feeder ' s room , with his father , who was in the <NAME> of <NAME> , and of whom Mr <NAME> had said that when he did catch the <NAME> ' s eye ( which he had been expected to do for three or four years ) , it was anticipated that he would rather touch up the Radicals .
Looking with greater attention at these contrivances ( wondering to find such literary preparations in such a place ) , I descried on each shelf a sort of microscopic sheet and blanket ; then I began dimly to comprehend that the passengers were the library , and that they were to be arranged , edge-wise , on these shelves , till morning .
' You wonder to hear me say that , ' remarked the old woman , shaking her head .
He is getting quite slow and lazy. ' ' I suspect , my dear , ' said my aunt quietly working by her side , ' he has a worse disorder than that .
" Do you suppose it will still be years hence , <NAME> ? " <NAME> shook his head , -- not in negativing the question , but in altogether negativing the notion that he could anyhow be got to answer it , -- and the two horrible casts of the twitched faces looked , when my eyes strayed up to them , as if they had come to a crisis in their suspended attention , and were going to sneeze .
' <NAME> away , dear <NAME> , pray further away. ' ' We must go on , indeed , ' said the child , yielding to his restless wish .
She was absolutely without pity .
" I have n't begun insuring yet , " he replied .
'You shall give nothing at all , ' said <NAME> , smiling ; 'for , as I told you before , we shall employ you in a hundred ways ; and if you only take half the trouble to please us , that you promise now , you will make me very happy indeed . '
' Ah , <NAME> , believe me never more than now ! ' ' Why do you go away from me so often , and keep away ? ' asked <NAME> .
' To-night we three will put up at a <NAME> .
How Mr <NAME> melted away , and Mr <NAME> changed into Mrs Pipchin , <NAME> never thought of asking ; neither was he at all curious to know ; but when he saw <NAME> standing at the bottom of the bed , instead of Mr Feeder , he cried out , ' Mrs Pipchin , don ' t tell Florence ! ' ' <NAME> ' t tell Florence what , my little <NAME> ? ' said <NAME> , coming round to the bedside , and sitting down in the chair .
' Did you give your son the name of <NAME> , because you lived in a sort of ark ? ' <NAME> seemed to think it a deep idea , but answered : ' No , sir .
' But you are spoiling them for me , ' said I , as he stirred it quickly with a piece of burning wood , striking out of it a train of red-hot sparks that went careering up the little chimney , and roaring out into the air .
said <NAME> , leading the way back .
' <NAME> ' t it prime ! ' ' This King had a daughter , who was the wisest and most beautiful Princess that ever was seen .
Not at all excited by these stupendous calculations , <NAME> dismisses his friends with a cool nod and remains behind to take a little admiring notice of <NAME> , as opportunity may serve , and to read the daily papers , which are so very large in proportion to himself , shorn of his hat , that when he holds up the Times to run his eye over the columns , he seems to have retired for the night and to have disappeared under the bedclothes .
" <NAME> me , <NAME> ; you appear warm , sir. " " I have been warm , " I said , " and on your account. " Having stated the circumstances at some length ( my generosity almost overpowered him ) , I asked him his name .
It was not that _he_ looked to them , but that <NAME> looked to them .
I have done this , " she says , " and I ' ve vasted time and substance on them as has done it more than me ; but I hope ven I ' m gone , <NAME> , that you ' ll think on me as I wos afore I know ' d them people , and as I raly wos by natur. " ' " Susan , " says I -- I wos took up wery short by this , <NAME> ; I von ' t deny it , my boy -- " <NAME> , " I says , " you ' ve been a wery good vife to me , altogether ; don ' t say nothin ' at all about it ; keep a good heart , my dear ; and you ' ll live to see me punch that ' ere <NAME> ' s head yet. " She smiled at this , <NAME> , ' said the old gentleman , stifling a sigh with his pipe , ' but she died arter all ! ' ' Vell , ' said <NAME> , venturing to offer a little homely consolation , after the lapse of three or four minutes , consumed by the old gentleman in slowly shaking his head from side to side , and solemnly smoking , ' vell , gov ' nor , ve must all come to it , one day or another. ' ' So we must , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> the elder .
The keeper had brought her a chair on which she sat in the middle of the porch between us .
But I shall rally , my dear <NAME> , in the morning ; do not fear for me , or be uneasy on my account .
The last thing I saw was <NAME> ' s unruffled eye ; fraught , as I fancied , with the silent conviction that I was very young indeed .
' I am sure you must be very tired , ' said the mama , turning to <NAME> .
I wanted a little inspiration , a little freshening up , a little change of ideas , and -- ' Pon my soul and honour , ' said the military gentleman , checking himself and looking round the room , ' what a devilish classical thing this is !
No Other <NAME> is so Favoured as This Country. ' ' And ozer countries ? -- ' the foreign gentleman was beginning , when Mr <NAME> put him right again .
' You don ' t like to hear the name of the cause ? ' said the little man , still busying himself with the knot .
' You are deep , <NAME> , ' pursued <NAME> , with the easy and vivacious frankness of a man of the world who knew the world too well to be ruffled by any discovery of misdoing , when it did not immediately concern himself , ' but you are not quite out of soundings , either -- neither you nor your absent friend , <NAME> .
'Not now , for the world , ' replied the young lady .
The house is full of boarders , both married and single , many of whom sleep upon the premises , and contract by the week for their board and lodging : the charge for which diminishes as they go nearer the sky to roost .
' It was a long way for him , ' said I , ' for he had nothing to uphold him on the journey. ' ' Wasn ' t he fed , poor thing ? ' asked <NAME> .
My aunt , on the other hand , was in a composed frame of mind , which was a lesson to all of us -- to me , I am sure .
' Mr Boffin , I happened to be in Chancery Lane this morning , when I saw you going along before me .
But , he was not far off , for presently she heard a troubled movement and a shouting coming along , which filled her with fear .
' I beg your pardon , sir , for interrupting you , ' said <NAME> ; ' but before you proceed to express , and act upon , any opinion you may have formed on the statements which have been made here , I must claim my right to be heard so far as I am personally concerned. ' ' Hold your tongue , <NAME> , ' said the magistrate peremptorily .
So should I. I was wrong .
' We are not , ' roared <NAME> , in a tone which , to any dispassionate listener , carried conviction with it .
When the repast was fully discussed , the lion put his hands in his waistband again , and lay down to meditate .
There lived in those days , round the corner -- in <NAME> Street Without -- one <NAME> , sworn broker and appraiser , who kept a shop where every description of second-hand furniture was exhibited in the most uncomfortable aspect , and under circumstances and in combinations the most completely foreign to its purpose .
' It ' s prime meat , ' rejoined his lady .
And now I began to wonder at myself for being in the coach , and to doubt whether I had sufficient reason for being there , and to consider whether I should get out presently and go back , and to argue against ever heeding an anonymous communication , and , in short , to pass through all those phases of contradiction and indecision to which I suppose very few hurried people are strangers .
He was Mr Merdle ' s last gift to <NAME> .
<NAME> had been very pale from the moment of his entrance ; but that might have been the effect of her recent illness .
<NAME> <NAME> handed me in and took his own seat on the box .
All through the cold and restless interval , until dawn , they once more whispered in the ears of <NAME> -- sitting opposite the buried man who had been dug out , and wondering what subtle powers were for ever lost to him , and what were capable of restoration -- the old inquiry : " I hope you care to be recalled to life ? " And the old answer : " I ca n't say. " The end of the first book .
' This plan , you see , <NAME> , has been gradually introduced into all the prisons for debt , ' said <NAME> .
<NAME> , not interested in what she has often heard , begins to collect in a basin various tributary streams of tea , from the bottoms of cups and saucers and from the bottom of the tea-pot for the little charwoman 's evening meal .
A <NAME> , when he ' s a good un , is worth his weight in gold .
<NAME> refreshed himself with a draught of wine -- but , he took less than was given to the stranger , as being himself a man to whom it was no rarity -- and stood waiting until the countryman had made his breakfast .
But yer must know , Work'us , yer mother was a regular right-down bad 'un . '
' That ' s real flesh and blood !
Or paid off -- like a ship 's company .
The scorer not committed , the scored debited with what is against him .
I am bound to say so now .
He would have taken his gaiters off his legs , to give away .
And that is my sensation , " says <NAME> , looking round upon the company , " at the present moment . "
' And the second floor ? ' said <NAME> , on finding the first satisfactory .
' <NAME> my soul , an amazing little creature ! ' <NAME> was the subject of Mr <NAME> ' s commendations ; and as she was lingering near the carriage ( all being now ready for its departure ) , that gentleman was suddenly seized with a strong interest in the proceedings , which impelled him to swagger down the garden , and take up his position at a convenient ogling distance .
I began to think there was something disorderly in his being there at all , even if he had not been in the habit of putting his foot in the salt or the melted butter .
' Is your business done , <NAME> ? ' inquired the lady .
I say what I mean .
Therefore she begged to be excused from any further attendance on the top set , until things were as they formerly was , and as they could be wished to be ; and further mentioned that her little book would be found upon the breakfast-table every Saturday morning , when she requested an immediate settlement of the same , with the benevolent view of saving trouble ' and an ill-conwenience ' to all parties .
<NAME> grandfather , let us leave this sad place to-morrow , and beg our way from door to door. ' The old man covered his face with his hands , and hid it in the pillow of the couch on which he lay .
Nor you , sweet-tempered Biddy ! " " Your appetite 's been touched like by your accident , " said the landlord , glancing at the bandaged arm under my coat .
no , nor yet his quarter -- a banking away like smoke at <NAME> 's , and a cocking their medical eyes at that tradesman on the sly , a going in and going out to their own carriages -- ah !
The poor relations caught the people who they thought would like it , and , when the game flagged , got caught themselves .
She did not rise also , but said , having looked at him in the meanwhile with a fixed look of suspicion , and lips angrily compressed : ' He was the chosen associate of your dear friend , Mr Gowan , was he not ?
' I am the son of a country gentleman , ' returned <NAME> , ' your equal in birth and education , and your superior I trust in everything besides .
I look back on the time I write of ; I invoke the innocent figure that I dearly loved , to come out from the mists and shadows of the past , and turn its gentle head towards me once again ; and I can still declare that this one little speech was constantly in my memory .
Ve-ry happy , I am sure ! "
I have put these considerations to you , my dear Sir , very feebly and imperfectly , but I ask you to think of them .
It would be an impertinence elsewhere , but it is not so here , to ask your name and condition ? " <NAME> roused himself , and gave the required information , in words as suitable as he could find .
A pot of beer had appeared from the <NAME> , and they were sharing it by turns in a peaceable manner .
I should have gone to bed with a sore heart indeed under any other roof but that which sheltered little Em ' ly ' s head .
' When I say lovely , ' said <NAME> , ' I always mean you. ' ' You never mean anything , I think , ' returned <NAME> ( not displeased ) .
Do not think so poorly of me as to believe that I feign a love I do not feel .
It sent the most insurrectionary tune into the world that was ever composed .
The general opinion among this class of gentlemen was , that it was a weak thing in <NAME> , and he ' d live to repent it .
<NAME> faith in the deception was the first article of his creed .
Does her credit , under the circumstances , in my opinion ! ' She still looked faint and pale .
" And so have I , " cried <NAME> .
I 'll have no feelings here .
It is now inclosed in a gentleman ' s garden .
They ' re true to one another , faithfo ' to one another , ' fectionate to one another , e ' en to death .
Both these heads of information were in a list that <NAME> , while in prison , gave to <NAME> , of the possessions he supposed I should inherit .
<NAME> is quite clear that he had better not .
Perhaps that will be considered an acceptable course of proceeding .
' Yes , ' said the <NAME> , who , with his half-shut eyes , and his usual smile , seemed to survey <NAME> with the sort of interest that might attach to some choice little animal he was going to stuff .
'Yes , sir , rather thirsty , ' answered <NAME> .
This was bad , but not the worst .
Though he was soon satisfied that he had dismissed the idea as romantic and unlikely -- though possible , there was no denying -- he could not help pursuing it so far as to entertain within himself a picture of what his condition would be , if he should discover such an imposture when he was grown old .
Or if it was partly , was it wholly and entirely ?
' You ' ll find it a most amazing stool to sit down upon , you may depend , ' returned Mr Brass .
Thus <NAME> had no sooner swallowed another glassful than he smiled upon all present in happy forgetfulness of having exhibited symptoms of pugnacity , and proposed ' The ladies !
Perhaps we shall change that , ' said Mr Boffin with a threatening roll of his head .
<NAME> am I at all near the mark in my picture ? ' As abrupt in his conclusion as in his commencement and progress , he jerked this inquiry at <NAME> , and stopped when one might have supposed him in the middle of his oration .
In pursuance of this determination , little Oliver , to his excessive astonishment , was released from bondage , and ordered to put himself into a clean shirt .
Having no reply ready , he could do no better than embrace her .
then this is not my natural manner ? ' she rejoined .
The cry is taken up by a hundred voices , and the crowd accumulate at every turning .
It only wants attending to .
<NAME> , who was one of those sages who act upon conviction , took some days to get the conviction thoroughly into his mind , that he had received a letter to this effect .
He is called to the bar ; and with admirable industry and self-denial has scraped another hundred pounds together , to fee a Conveyancer whose chambers he attends .
His white apron flaps languidly in the air , his head gradually droops upon his breast , he takes very long winks with both eyes at once ; even he is unable to withstand the soporific influence of the place , and is gradually falling asleep .
Your money came out of , or went into , wormy old wooden drawers , particles of which flew up your nose and down your throat when they were opened and shut .
Still the restless mind went , following and counting , ever farther , ever higher , as to the summit of a mighty tower that it took years to climb .
<NAME> , my dear fellow , confess at once that you expected me before. ' ' I did , ' said <NAME> ; ' but <NAME> told me -- ' ' Little Dorrit .
As I consider myself responsible for him , Mr Gills , ' here he smiled a wide smile at <NAME> , who shook before it : ' I shall be glad if you ' ll look sharply after him , and report his behaviour to me .
I shall not fail to correspond .
Always Merdle. ' ' Very strange how these runs on an infatuation prevail , ' said <NAME> .
<NAME> said , " Don ' t come back , <NAME> , until you have seen Mr Boffin , and told him all .
' I am for <NAME> tonight .
' <NAME> back here , will you , and let me knock. ' Anything that makes a noise is satisfactory to a crowd .
We can ' t be happy together for five minutes in the evening , but some intrusive female knocks at the door , and says , ' Oh , if you please , <NAME> , would you step upstairs ! ' <NAME> and my aunt roam all over <NAME> , to find out articles of furniture for <NAME> and me to look at .
' I am sorry , ' stammered <NAME> , confused by the strange man 's wild look .
<NAME> was that , <NAME> ? ' ' Yes , <NAME> Dean. ' ' He has stayed late. ' ' Yes , <NAME> .
I am sure , although absorbed in gazing at the water , that her shawl was off her shoulders , and that she was muffling her hands in it , in an unsettled and bewildered way , more like the action of a sleep-walker than a waking person .
The treadmill is conducted with little or no noise ; five hundred men may pick oakum in the same room , without a sound ; and both kinds of labour admit of such keen and vigilant superintendence , as will render even a word of personal communication amongst the prisoners almost impossible .
<NAME> suggested that it was comfortable to know that <NAME> did not mean these destructive sentiments .
On <NAME> ' s replying in the affirmative , she pushed a chair against it , and begging the assistance of my hand , mounted up , pretty nimbly , to the top , as if it were a stage .
One : I remember his changing a small folded paper from one pocket to another , after we came out , which he had not touched before .
His door being shut , she softly opened it and spoke to him , approaching his bed with a noiseless step .
' Therefore I can judge , ' said Mr Perch , shaking his head and speaking in a silvery murmur , ' of the feelings of such as is at all peculiarly sitiwated in this most painful rewelation. ' Here Mr Perch waited to be confided in ; and receiving no confidence , coughed behind his hand .
You have no young child ? "
No , <NAME> ! ' shaking his head .
He had a wonderful satisfaction in seeing him , and in commenting on his decayed condition after he was gone .
' Oh , quite enough to get , <NAME> , as the soldier said ven they ordered him three hundred and fifty lashes , ' replied <NAME> .
<NAME> , remembering that the clever one had said he would explain himself further in four-and-twenty hours ' time , determined for her part that his taking himself off within that period with all he could get , was the final satisfactory sum and substance of his promised explanation ; but she held her peace , devoutly thankful to be quit of him .
The meek man supposed he did , but supposed that had absolutely nothing to do with it , if its laws were well administered .
The tradesmen held that he was a sort of lawyer , and the other neighbours opined that he was a kind of general agent ; both of which guesses were as correct and definite as guesses about other people ' s affairs usually are , or need to be .
After lingering at the finger-post for a few minutes to see the stilts frisking away in the moonlight and the bearer of the drum toiling slowly after them , he blew a few notes upon the trumpet as a parting salute , and hastened with all speed to follow Mr Codlin .
<NAME> will coom then ; and arterwards I ' ll see thee safe t ' thy <NAME> ' lodgin .
' You are very good , ' said <NAME> .
' Tell him I was hearty , and sent my respects .
' I heerd it now , quite apparent , ' resumed <NAME> .
But as this is the <NAME> , gentlemen , where the lights are , I recommend dropping the subject .
We must have our national schools to walk at the head of , and we must have our standing armies .
I have no occasion to relate that I succeeded .
" I presume this is your other ward , <NAME> ? "
' I mean , ' he explained , ' that young ways were never my ways .
<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> were left alone at the desk , in the general departure from the <NAME> .
' Do you not , sir -- without intending it -- of a surety without intending it -- sometimes mingle the character I fairly earn in your employment , with the character which it is your policy that I should bear ? ' ' I don ' t find it worth my while to cut things so fine as to go into the inquiry , ' Fascination coolly answered .
' Twelve shillings a week , even when they are an old man ' s wages , bury themselves. ' ' I should like to know what you really are worth , ' returned <NAME> , with whom his growing rich on that stipend and gratitude was a very convenient fiction .
Let him rot there. ' ' Certainly , sir .
So , in the rosy evening , one might watch the ever-widening beauty of the landscape -- beyond the newly-released workers wending home -- beyond the silver river -- beyond the deep green fields of corn , so prospering , that the loiterers in their narrow threads of pathway seemed to float immersed breast-high -- beyond the hedgerows and the clumps of trees -- beyond the windmills on the ridge -- away to where the sky appeared to meet the earth , as if there were no immensity of space between mankind and <NAME> .
She made use of me to tease other admirers , and she turned the very familiarity between herself and me to the account of putting a constant slight on my devotion to her .
With all that ruin at my feet and about me , it seemed a natural place for me , that day .
How do you suppose you are ever to get through life , if you ' re such a coward as this ?
<NAME> stock got into circulation .
She remembered well , that even the old woman who had robbed her when a little child -- whose image and whose house , and all she had said and done , were stamped upon her recollection , with the enduring sharpness of a fearful impression made at that early period of life -- had spoken fondly of her daughter , and how terribly even she had cried out in the pain of hopeless separation from her child .
You can ' t put any confidence in him , sir .
Our old selves weren ' t people of fortune ; our new selves are ; it ' s a great difference. ' ' Ah ! ' said <NAME> , pausing in her work again , softly to draw a long breath and to look at the fire .
However , the permission was given , and was never retracted ; for when the month was out , <NAME> and I were ready to depart .
' Had I not seen , at a morning concert , the demdest little fascinator in all the world , and while that little fascinator is my wife , may not all the countesses and dowagers in <NAME> be -- ' <NAME> did not finish the sentence , but he gave <NAME> a very loud kiss , which <NAME> returned ; after which , there seemed to be some more kissing mixed up with the progress of the breakfast .
I ' ll be more communicative with you .
' The speculations of an Angular man , ' resumed <NAME> , still sitting and speaking exactly as before , ' are probably erroneous on so globular a topic .
<NAME> ' t that make a difference , <NAME> ?
And what do we live for but sympathy !
' See that the boiler ' s full .
Out they came forthwith ; Mr Witherden , who was short , chubby , fresh-coloured , brisk , and pompous , leading the old lady with extreme politeness , and the father and son following them , arm in arm .
All their worldly goods are a bag , a large chest and an old chair : one , old , high-backed , rush-bottomed chair : a solitary settler in itself .
' Still , it is a triumph to me to know that he is so true to himself , and to his name of <NAME> ; although , of course , I always knew he would be .
' More care ! ' said the old man in a shrill voice , ' more care of Nelly !
With a view to their rational and moral enjoyment , <NAME> had adapted the beautiful words of ' Who hasn ' t heard of a Jolly Young Waterman ? ' to the tune of the <NAME> , which he would request them to join him in singing ( great applause ) .
There is no despotism here ; that ' s the great thing .
Take my word , it ' s nothing whatever .
cried the old gentleman , bursting out with the rage he had kept down so long , 'd -- n me !
Into his handsome face , the bitter waters of captivity had worn ; but , he covered up their tracks with a determination so strong , that he held the mastery of them even in his sleep .
<NAME> <NAME> awakened much affectionate uneasiness in her sister ' s mind that day by passing the greater part of it in violent fits of embracing her , and in alternately giving her brooches , and wishing herself dead .
" I 'm not a going back .
<NAME> <NAME> sat silent for some minutes , and then , turning round to the prosecutor , said in a towering passion .
I have seen it many times since then , by sunlight and by moonlight , but never free from the impressions of that journey .
The shadow on his face was darker when he turned his glance away from her ; and even then it wandered back again , furtively , as if he were haunted by her bold eyes , and some remembrance they inspired .
As I recall our being opposed thus , face to face , I seem again to hear my heart beat fast and high .
But when she married again -- when she took that most disastrous step of marrying you , in short , ' said my aunt , ' to be plain -- did no one put in a word for the boy at that time ? ' ' My late wife loved her second husband , ma ' am , ' said <NAME> , ' and trusted implicitly in him. ' ' Your late wife , sir , was a most unworldly , most unhappy , most unfortunate baby , ' returned my aunt , shaking her head at him .
I had the honour of being passed on the road. " " Coming up the hill , and at the top of the hill , both ? " " <NAME> , it is true. " " What did you look at , so fixedly ? " " <NAME> , I looked at the man. " He stooped a little , and with his tattered blue cap pointed under the carriage .
I kept my ears open , seeming to have them shut , until I heard that he was absent , and I thought that would be the best time for making the attempt .
' Take Christopher by all means. ' ' I beg your pardon , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , who had listened to this discourse with a lengthening countenance , ' but if that ' s the reason , I ' m afraid I should do more harm than good -- <NAME> , <NAME> , she knows me , and would trust in me , I am sure ; but old master -- I don ' t know why , gentlemen ; nobody does -- would not bear me in his sight after he had been ill , and <NAME> herself told me that I must not go near him or let him see me any more .
Who was this , do you think ? ' ' Why do you ask me ? ' repeated <NAME> .
What are these suckers of cigars and swallowers of strong drinks , whose hats and legs we see in every possible variety of twist , doing , but amusing themselves ?
He had scarcely left the room , and allowed the ticking to become audible again , when a quick hand turned a latchkey in the house-door , opened it , and shut it .
What if I were to turn too ?
' Little Kate <NAME> ' were the words that caught his ear .
' If you please , ' said she .
" You had better , <NAME> , " said <NAME> , doing all he could to propitiate , by tone and manner , " have the dear child here , and our good Pross .
Mrs. Rouncewell might have been sufficiently assured by hearing the rain , but that she is rather deaf , which nothing will induce her to believe .
' Dear me ! ' said Mr <NAME> , ' you too !
All this time , the ringing at the bell was constantly renewed , and those without were beating at the door .
' You are better ? ' said the child , stopping to speak with him .
<NAME> , <NAME> , pray come and see the Doctor. ' I was conscious of <NAME> ' s standing in the shadow of the room , shutting up his knife , when we accompanied her to the <NAME> ; and of my aunt ' s rubbing her nose violently , by the way , as a mild vent for her intolerance of our military friend ; but who got first into the <NAME> , or how Mrs. <NAME> settled herself in a moment in her easy-chair , or how my aunt and I came to be left together near the door ( unless her eyes were quicker than mine , and she held me back ) , I have forgotten , if I ever knew .
' She is a very charming girl , but she has a great deal of feeling .
<NAME> grammar , composition , geography , and the use of the dumb-bells , by <NAME> ; writing , arithmetic , dancing , music , and general fascination , by <NAME> ; the art of needle-work , marking , and samplery , by <NAME> ; corporal punishment , fasting , and other tortures and terrors , by <NAME> .
You have stood of your own strength ever since .
In every little chamber that I entered , and at every grate through which I looked , I seemed to see the same appalling countenance .
" You girls are more trouble than you 're worth , by half . "
Upon my word and honour I seem to be fated , and destined , and ordained , to live in the midst of things that I am never to hear the last of .
' Not that my life has been lonely , for I could have sometimes wished it lonelier , instead of having Ma going on like the <NAME> with a face-ache in majestic corners , and <NAME> being spiteful -- though of course I am very fond of them both .
' Hush ! ' ' You nasty , idle , vicious , good-for-nothing brute , ' cried the woman , stamping on the ground , ' why don ' t you turn the mangle ? ' ' So I am , my life and soul ! ' replied the man ' s voice .
If I had taken a hackney-chariot and gone by the streets , I should have missed my aim ; going as I did , I caught the coach just as it came out of the yard .
'That 's for your people , ' said the guard .
' Dear me ! ' said <NAME> .
<NAME> , your mother took this course with you .
I was in this state when I first shrunk from the light as it twinkled on me once more , and knew with a boundless joy for which no words are rapturous enough that I should see again .
There was nobody at the chambers but <NAME> .
It turned him paler ; but he repeated that he would cling to the hope he had derived from <NAME> ; and that if no trace of his dear boy were found , leading to the dreadful inference that he had been made away with , he would cherish unto the last stretch of possibility the idea , that he might have absconded of his own wild will .
' You just come away , ' said <NAME> .
You will please to answer no , it is not enough. ' ' A moment ! ' cried <NAME> , interposing , ' permit me !
Consequently you 're very far from wanting to give trouble .
I thought of him very much after I went to bed , and raised myself , I recollect , to look at him where he lay in the moonlight , with his handsome face turned up , and his head reclining easily on his arm .
It was at the time when my troubles were at their highest , and when I was most incensed against my lover for his ingratitude in caring as little as he did for the innumerable distresses and mortifications I underwent on his account , that your dear friend , Mr Gowan , appeared at the house .
<NAME> <NAME> could hear him growling away like an old mastiff with a sore throat ; and whenever the unfortunate apprentice with the thin legs came into the room , so surely did old Lobbs commence swearing at him in a most Saracenic and ferocious manner , though apparently with no other end or object than that of easing his bosom by the discharge of a few superfluous oaths .
A destiny , little fellow ! ' As he thus apostrophised the infant he raised one of his hands to his lips , and kissed it ; then , seeming to fear that the action involved some compromise of his dignity , went , awkwardly enough , away .
<NAME> <NAME> is wild with joy , and my aunt remits me a guinea by the next post .
' What <NAME> was that , <NAME> ? ' ' Lor !
" Now , do you suppose he really has got hold of any other papers of importance , as he has boasted to you , since you have been such allies ? "
' It hasn ' t anything to do with you. ' ' Has it anything to do with -- is it anything you heard through chinks or keyholes -- and that you were not intended to hear ? ' asked <NAME> , in a breathless state .
Mrs. Jellyby , sitting in quite a nest of waste paper , drank coffee all the evening and dictated at intervals to her eldest daughter .
Pausing from his work , he leant on his spade , and put his hand to his dull ear .
When she began to walk and talk , he became fond of her ; bought a little arm-chair and stood it by the high fender of the lodge fire-place ; liked to have her company when he was on the lock ; and used to bribe her with cheap toys to come and talk to him .
' Be mine , be mine ! ' cried the old gentleman .
I am ashamed to say that I can not at this moment recall where we met , but I am so glad of this opportunity , I am sure ! ' Then pouncing upon <NAME> , who holds back with all his feeble might , he is haling him off to present him , as <NAME> , to Mrs Podsnap , when the arrival of more guests unravels the mistake .
Which is the man ? " " Here is the man , " said <NAME> .
' I called to ask this morning. ' ' Thank you very much ! ' the pleasant voice of <NAME> would reply .
At any rate you know me as a dissolute dog , who has never done any good , and never will. " " I do n't know that you 'never will .
The day changes as it wears itself away and becomes dark and drizzly .
The air was ' Away with melancholy ' -- a composition , which , when it is played very slowly on the flute , in bed , with the further disadvantage of being performed by a gentleman but imperfectly acquainted with the instrument , who repeats one note a great many times before he can find the next , has not a lively effect .
Y. -- but really this was too bad !
Let me see them again , and beg them , on my knees , to show the same mercy and goodness to you ; and let us both leave this dreadful place , and far apart lead better lives , and forget how we have lived , except in prayers , and never see each other more .
Then the Major called at Mr <NAME> ' s house in town ; and came down again , in the same coach as Mr Dombey .
Towards the twilight I went out by myself , musing on what I ought to do , and whether I was justified in withholding from <NAME> , any longer , what <NAME> had told me in <NAME> ; for that began to trouble me again , very much .
And now , sir , I may admit , freely admit , that my friend is sometimes of a sarcastic temper. ' ' The lady is your friend ' s wife , sir ? ' ' The lady is my friend ' s wife , sir. ' ' She is very handsome. ' ' Sir , she is peerless .
' Thank you , ' he returned , with fervour .
A fair profit is , of course , allowable . '
<NAME> , with a perceptible lengthening of his face , explained that he had not been able to approach this subject ; that it had shared the fate of <NAME> ' s liabilities , in not being comprehended in the terms he had made ; that we were no longer of any authority with <NAME> ; and that if he could do us , or any of us , any injury or annoyance , no doubt he would .
He is , I say again without disguise , a low mercenary wretch .
At least , Mr <NAME> seemed perfectly satisfied when he descried them on board .
It had been hard -- how hard may none but <NAME> ever know ! -- to have the natural affection of a true and earnest nature turned to agony ; and slight , or stern repulse , substituted for the tenderest protection and the dearest care .
' I have saved him , ' she thought .
According to your own account I ' m not worth much , ' Wegg reasons persuasively .
Probably , it took about a dozen drowned men to fit him out completely ; and that may have been the reason why the different articles of his dress were in various stages of decay .
' That he may be ready -- in case of anything turning up. ' ' And do you go too , ma ' am ? ' The events of the day , in combination with the twins , if not with the flip , had made Mrs. Micawber hysterical , and she shed tears as she replied : ' I never will desert <NAME> .
' You will not be long dressing , <NAME> , I presume ? ' said Mr Dombey .
The scamp has been obliged to fly , as I learn , for some knavery , and has found his way abroad .
The son inheriting , was so merciful as to forgive me both , and place me here. ' He made a little gesture as though he kissed the hem of an imaginary garment worn by the noble youth before him .
Sometimes , the table consisted of <NAME> and half a dozen leaves ; sometimes , of <NAME> and a dozen leaves ; sometimes , <NAME> was pulled out to his utmost extent of twenty leaves .
He stepped into the sober , silent , air-tight house -- one might have fancied it to have been stifled by Mutes in the <NAME> manner -- and the door , closing again , seemed to shut out sound and motion .
I am not certain whether I found out then , or afterwards , that , without being actively concerned in any business , he had some share in , or some annual charge upon the profits of , a wine-merchant ' s house in <NAME> , with which his family had been connected from his great-grandfather ' s time , and in which his sister had a similar interest ; but I may mention it in this place , whether or no .
' That ' s the witness-box , I suppose ? ' said <NAME> , pointing to a kind of pulpit , with a brass rail , on his left hand .
So surely as I looked towards her , did I see that eager visage , with its gaunt black eyes and searching brow , intent on mine ; or passing suddenly from mine to <NAME> ' s ; or comprehending both of us at once .
Con-fined , as the lady said. ' ' A prisoner ! ' exclaimed <NAME> , with unaccountable vehemence .
" Only a matter of form , miss , " returned the young gentleman .
'Meat , ma'am , meat , ' replied <NAME> , with stern emphasis .
<NAME> on my left ! "
Taking the bread under his arm , the young gentlman turned into a small public-house , and led the way to a tap-room in the rear of the premises .
Upon it , one of the two men lolled , half sitting and half lying , with his knees drawn up , and his feet and shoulders planted against the opposite sides of the aperture .
On this particular evening the urgency of my case demanded a pint of this mixture , which was poured down my throat , for my greater comfort , while Mrs. <NAME> held my head under her arm , as a boot would be held in a bootjack .
If this young lord does dog your footsteps , and whisper his drivelling inanities in your ears , what of it ?
" Yet , you silly little thing !
He left here , ' said <NAME> , ' with his mother , who had been clamouring , and beseeching , and disclosing , the whole time .
If anyone else had been in my place during the last few years , by this time he would have had <NAME> ( oh , what a worthy man he is , <NAME> , too ! )
There was neither knocker nor bell-handle at the open door where <NAME> and his master stopped ; so , groping his way cautiously through the dark passage , and bidding Oliver keep close to him and not be afraid the undertaker mounted to the top of the first flight of stairs .
If you seriously want to follow up the niece , tell the uncle that you must know where she lives and how she lives , and with whom , or you are no longer a customer of his .
I feared you were going , with malice aforethought , as the dreadful lawyers say -- those horrid prosers ! -- to condemn me to utter solitude. ' ' Why do me so great an injustice , my dear madam ? ' said Mr Dombey .
' Good morning , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> ; very coldly .
But , the comfort was , that all the company at the grand hotel of <NAME> were perfectly dressed .
No matter how incidentally or naturally I endeavoured to form my little wife ' s mind , I could not help seeing that she always had an instinctive perception of what I was about , and became a prey to the keenest apprehensions .
I pity you , and I despise you ! "
The mournfulness of the place and time , and the great terror of this illusion , though it was but momentary , caused me to feel an indescribable awe as I came out between the open wooden gates where I had once wrung my hair after <NAME> had wrung my heart .
<NAME> <NAME> is mightily curious in respect of the room .
It was within half an hour or so of the time of closing .
And could I help it if with all this , and the coming to the little school , and the unexpected sight of the poor children outside waving their hats and bonnets to me , and of a grey-haired gentleman and lady whose daughter I had helped to teach and at whose house I had visited ( who were said to be the proudest people in all that country ) , caring for nothing but calling out , " Good-bye , <NAME> .
The seconds retired , the gentleman on the camp-stool did the same , and the belligerents approached each other .
In face she bore a striking resemblance to her brother , <NAME> -- so exact , indeed , was the likeness between them , that had it consorted with <NAME> ' s maiden modesty and gentle womanhood to have assumed her brother ' s clothes in a frolic and sat down beside him , it would have been difficult for the oldest friend of the family to determine which was <NAME> and which <NAME> , especially as the lady carried upon her upper lip certain reddish demonstrations , which , if the imagination had been assisted by her attire , might have been mistaken for a beard .
<NAME> ' t you go a day ' s journey , if you were in my place ? ' His face was thoughtful , and he sat considering a little before he answered , in a low voice , ' Well !
You know M. R. F. , but not as well as I do .
They are met at the very threshold with this mild appeal .
Let them rest though ; they ' re better gone. ' ' Much better , dear , ' replied the child .
come , that ' s too absurd. ' Notwithstanding the absurdity of the proposal , however , the clerk allowed himself to be gently drawn beyond the hearing of <NAME> ; and after a short conversation conducted in whispers , walked softly down a little dark passage , and disappeared into the legal luminary ' s sanctum , whence he shortly returned on tiptoe , and informed <NAME> and <NAME> that the <NAME> had been prevailed upon , in violation of all established rules and customs , to admit them at once .
It is not , I assure you. ' Comforted by this intelligence , the patient applied himself to his food with a keen appetite , though evidently not with a greater zest in the eating than his nurse appeared to have in seeing him eat .

' ' Just so. ' ' It was not bound upon <NAME> , and it was not bound upon me , by any forfeit , in case— ' ' Don ' t be agitated , my dear .

Sometimes -- towards the end of a long stage -- Kit could not help wishing it were a little warmer : but when they stopped to change horses , and he had had a good run , and what with that , and the bustle of paying the old postilion , and rousing the new one , and running to and fro again until the horses were put to , he was so warm that the blood tingled and smarted in his fingers ' ends -- then , he felt as if to have it one degree less cold would be to lose half the delight and glory of the journey : and up he jumped again , right cheerily , singing to the merry music of the wheels as they rolled away , and , leaving the townspeople in their warm beds , pursued their course along the lonely road .

The post-chaise drove up to the door shortly afterwards ; and <NAME> coming in for the luggage , the good doctor bustled out , to see it packed .
' Yes , ' said <NAME> , ' that was the object of the present expedition .

" " I see it all before me.

' The Captain hastily produced the big watch , the teaspoons , the sugar-tongs , and the canister , and laying them on the table , swept them with his great hand into <NAME> ' s hat ; but in handing that singular strong box to <NAME> , he was so overcome again , that he was fain to make another retreat into the shop , and absent himself for a longer space of time than on his first retirement .

But however that may be , <NAME> is gone .

<NAME> as he was , however , he had sense enough to make a feint of feeling great regret at going away .
' All I will say is , <NAME> , ' he remarked , ' that you can have received no provocation to a feeling in which I believe you have no sharer. ' ' You may ask your dear friend , if you choose , ' she returned , ' for his opinion upon that subject.

' ' I hate him , ' she returned .
' No , R. W. Lavinia has not known the trial that <NAME> has known .
At night , when the workpeople went away , the house was dreary and deserted again ; and <NAME> , listening to their voices echoing through the hall and staircase as they departed , pictured to herself the cheerful homes to which the were returning , and the children who were waiting for them , and was glad to think that they were merry and well pleased to go .

<NAME> women old in the vices of the commonest and worst life , were expected to profess themselves enthralled by the good child ' s book , the <NAME> of <NAME> , who resided in the village cottage by the mill ; severely reproved and morally squashed the miller , when she was five and he was fifty ; divided her porridge with singing birds ; denied herself a new nankeen bonnet , on the ground that the turnips did not wear nankeen bonnets , neither did the sheep who ate them ; who plaited straw and delivered the dreariest orations to all comers , at all sorts of unseasonable times .
<NAME> <NAME> gently reasoned with him as he made a little drawing of his head on the fly-leaf of a book .

No fiend in human form ! ' ' No , sir , certainly , ' Young <NAME> added with simplicity , ' I should be very sorry if there was. ' ' The sentiment , ' said Mr Rugg , ' is what I should have expected from your known principles .

As I told him yes , he laid it on the table , and resting his head upon his hand , began .
Then why stop short , and not otherwise acknowledge it ? ' ' Is there no difference , ' asked <NAME> , with a little faltering in her manner ; ' between submission to a generous spirit , and submission to a base or trivial one ?

' <NAME> sent his daughter out on an errand not an hour ago , and then was seen to slip out himself , with his hat over his eyes , and a bundle tied up in a handkerchief under his arm .

Sometimes she would hear a newspaper read out , and would learn how the <NAME> General cast up the units that had within the last week died of want and of exposure to the weather : for which that Recording <NAME> seemed to have a regular fixed place in his sum , as if they were its halfpence .

He knocked softly , with his hook , at <NAME> ' s door , twice or thrice ; but , receiving no answer , ventured first to peep in , and then to enter : emboldened to take the latter step , perhaps , by the familiar recognition of <NAME> , who , stretched upon the ground by the side of her couch , wagged his tail , and winked his eyes at the <NAME> , without being at the trouble of getting up .
I hope she is in no affliction ?
My Lady , do you object to the twilight ? "
After going round the town , the procession repaired to a certain appointed place , where , as the printed programme set forth , it would be received by the children of the different free schools , ' singing <NAME> Songs. ' I was prevented from getting there , in time to hear these Little Warblers , or to report upon this novel kind of vocal entertainment : novel , at least , to me : but I found in a large open space , each society gathered round its own banners , and listening in silent attention to its own orator .

' Three ten and one ten is five .
You 're in the habit of shaking hands ? " I was rather confused , thinking it must be out of the <NAME> fashion , but said yes .

I observed <NAME> and <NAME> , when they first met ; and the impression made upon me then was not agreeable .

This is the way in which Our <NAME> has come to find no pleasure but in taking cold among the linen , and in showing in that yard , as in that yard I have myself shown you , a broken-down ruin that goes home to his mother ' s heart ! ' Here the good woman pointed to the little window , whence her son might be seen sitting disconsolate in the tuneless groves ; and again shook her head and wiped her eyes , and besought him , for the united sakes of both the young people , to exercise his influence towards the bright reversal of these dismal events .
I am aware of that ; and that ' s the reason why I insist upon it , that there shan ' t be a word about it in his Memorial. ' ' Is it a Memorial about his own history that he is writing , aunt ? ' ' Yes , child , ' said my aunt , rubbing her nose again .

Then he asked me tenderly if I remembered our boyish games at sums , and how we had gone together to have me bound apprentice , and , in effect , how he had ever been my favorite fancy and my chosen friend ?
Might I ask you why he made it ? ' <NAME> burst into tears .
This led on to many interchanges of endearment and enjoyment on all sides , in the midst of which the Inexhaustible being observed staring , in a most imbecile manner , on Mrs <NAME> ' s breast , was pronounced to be supernaturally intelligent as to the whole transaction , and was made to declare to the ladies and gemplemorums , with a wave of the speckled fist ( with difficulty detached from an exceedingly short waist ) , ' I have already informed my venerable Ma that I know all about it ! ' Then , said <NAME> , would Mrs <NAME> come and see her house ?

<NAME> well , I ' m agreeable : I can ' t say no fairer than that , can I , sir ? ' ( <NAME> smiled . )
After overhearing this dialogue , I should assuredly have got down and been left in the solitude and darkness of the highway , but for feeling certain that the man had no suspicion of my identity .
I am now in a condition to show , by -- <NAME> ' S -- false books , and -- <NAME> ' S -- real memoranda , beginning with the partially destroyed pocket-book ( which I was unable to comprehend , at the time of its accidental discovery by Mrs. Micawber , on our taking possession of our present abode , in the locker or bin devoted to the reception of the ashes calcined on our domestic hearth ) , that the weaknesses , the faults , the very virtues , the parental affections , and the sense of honour , of the unhappy <NAME> have been for years acted on by , and warped to the base purposes of -- HEEP .
' I am , ' repeated the Dodger .
Loose then stabbed <NAME> with one of those never-failing weapons , a bowie-knife .
<NAME> <NAME> , still walking in the centre , hand to shoulder on either side , beautifully turns the <NAME> of a drinking song , and they all go up to his rooms .
There was a small stove at that corner of the room which was nearest to the master ' s desk , and by it <NAME> sat down , so depressed and self-degraded by the consciousness of his position , that if death could have come upon him at that time , he would have been almost happy to meet it .
I am sure you will deserve to be happy , and you will be , <NAME> ' As she held out her hand to him with these words , the heart that was under the waistcoat of sprigs -- mere slop-work , if the truth must be known -- swelled to the size of the heart of a gentleman ; and the poor common little fellow , having no room to hold it , burst into tears .

And here ' s thanking of ' em for all their goodness as is so constancy a diffusing of itself over everywhere , and wishing they may live long and die happy ! ' When the foregoing speech was over -- and it might have been much more elegant and much less to the purpose -- the whole body of subordinates under command of the apoplectic butler gave three soft cheers ; which , to that gentleman ' s great indignation , were not very regular , inasmuch as the women persisted in giving an immense number of little shrill hurrahs among themselves , in utter disregard of the time .

How often have I inquired for you , and been told that I should hear before long ! ' ' I know , I know ! ' returned <NAME> .

There had been times when , if he had been a sultan , and his grand vizier had said one morning , " What does the <NAME> of the <NAME> require at the hands of his slave ? "

Here and there an old tub was put to catch the droppings of rain-water from a roof , or they were banked up with mud into a little pond like a large dirt-pie .
The door was open , and the hall was blocked up by a grand piano , a harp , and several other musical instruments in cases , all in progress of removal , and all looking rakish in the daylight .
' That ' s it. ' ' What ' s it ? ' said <NAME> .
He had left her , when only eighteen ; robbed her of jewels and money ; gambled , squandered , forged , and fled to <NAME> : where for two years he had associated with the lowest outcasts .

' Shall we join company in the avenue of trees which leads from <NAME> to <NAME> , and settle the exact spot when we arrive there ? ' said Mr Westwood .
We took our leave early , and left together .
asked the doctor , following the young lady to the sideboard .
<NAME> , apparently somewhat ashamed at being found relaxing himself with a gentleman so much his inferior in station and mental endowments , yawned , and inquiring after <NAME> , took up his hat to go .
He wandered over them again .
As we turned to ascend the last flight of stairs between us and the roof , we caught a full view of this figure pausing for a moment , at a door .
<NAME> to see you , Sir. ' ' Thank ' ee. ' <NAME> emptied his glass , and placed the bottle on the coach-box , by his side .

They were ruined , when they were required to send labouring children to school ; they were ruined when inspectors were appointed to look into their works ; they were ruined , when such inspectors considered it doubtful whether they were quite justified in chopping people up with their machinery ; they were utterly undone , when it was hinted that perhaps they need not always make quite so much smoke .
And very well indeed you are looking , Mrs .
So , to keep up their good-humour , they stopped at the first roadside tavern they came to , and ordered a glass of brandy-and-water all round , with a magnum of extra strength for <NAME> .

Let me make you a cup of tea , ' said <NAME> , ' if you ' d condescend to take such a thing in the cottage ; and many thanks to you , too , I am sure , for bearing us in mind so kindly. ' Mr Plornish deeming it incumbent on him , as host , to add his personal acknowledgments , tendered them in the form which always expressed his highest ideal of a combination of ceremony with sincerity .
' Then let me tell him once for all , through you , that I will come into and go out of this place as often as I like , so long as he keeps <NAME> here ; and that if he wants to be quit of me , he must first be quit of her .
My name is <NAME> , -- <NAME> Toots. ' The <NAME> remembered to have seen this young gentleman at the wedding , and made him a bow .
<NAME> , too , poor wandering shipwrecked boy , oh , where is he ?
I was very hot indeed upon <NAME> 's daring to admire her ; as hot as if it were an outrage on myself .

<NAME> <NAME> , by his master ' s permission , retired to spend the evening in his own way ; and was shortly afterwards elected , by the unanimous voice of the assembled company , into the taproom chair , in which honourable post he acquitted himself so much to the satisfaction of the gentlemen-frequenters , that their roars of laughter and approbation penetrated to <NAME> ' s bedroom , and shortened the term of his natural rest by at least three hours .
It is not necessarily a lengthened preparation , being limited to the setting forth of very simple breakfast requisites for two and the broiling of a rasher of bacon at the fire in the rusty grate ; but as <NAME> has to sidle round a considerable part of the gallery for every object he wants , and never brings two objects at once , it takes time under the circumstances .
' My secret was out ; and my only struggle now was for liberty and freedom .
Mr Doyce , still looking at the flame of his candle , slowly resumed : ' The truth is , he has twice taken his daughter abroad in the hope of separating her from Mr Gowan .
Meanwhile terms were ratified and agreed upon between Mrs Chick and <NAME> , with the assistance of <NAME> ; and Richards being with much ceremony invested with the <NAME> baby , as if it were an Order , resigned her own , with many tears and kisses , to <NAME> .
As the real state of the case dawned upon <NAME> ' s mind , he looked very terrible , and said he was perfectly satisfied ; but at the same time , said so with an air that left <NAME> no alternative but to infer that if he had not been , something most horrible and destructive must inevitably have occurred .
I made acquaintance with an <NAME> railroad , on this occasion , for the first time .
No odious brutes must proach me till I ' ve shaken off this numbness ; ' and in a grisly resumption of her coquettish ways , she made a dab at the Major with her fan , but overset Mr <NAME> ' s breakfast cup instead , which was in quite a different direction .
I can see too well that I am not high in the old lady ' s opinion , and it is easy to understand what an irksome clog I must be upon the hospitalities of her orderly house—especially at this time of year—when I must be kept asunder from this person , and there is such a reason for my not being brought into contact with that person , and an unfavourable reputation has preceded me with such another person ; and so on .
' Lodgings ; up near Mr <NAME> ' s , ' returned <NAME> .
He showed his anxious sense of this last deprivation , by often feeling the lips of other persons when they were talking , and then putting his hand upon his own , as if to assure himself that he had them in the right position .
' Is there ony genelmen there as can len ' a hond here ?
Much comforted by this assurance , <NAME> opened the door to its full width , and confronted a portly man in a great-coat ; who walked in , without saying anything more , and wiped his shoes on the mat , as coolly as if he lived there .
It is a thriving place , pleasantly situated -- streams and streets , town and country , mill and moor -- and seems to present an opening for such a man .
She therefore took her grandfather aside , and telling him that she had still enough left to defray the cost of their lodging , proposed that they should stay there for the night .
I have no doubt the mother is a most genteel and elegant creature , and I have no right whatever to dispute the policy of her living with them : which is <NAME> ' s affair , not mine -- and as to <NAME> ' s choice , herself , I have only seen her picture yet , but that is beautiful indeed .
The door opened , and a group of little children bounded out , shouting and romping .
They were two men who were seated in easy attitudes upon the grass , and so busily engaged as to be at first unconscious of intruders .
Then I don ' t know what it is , I am sure. ' ' What should you say to a young lady from <NAME> ? ' inquired <NAME> .
Whenever the sound reached his ears , he would immediately lay down his pen and fall to rubbing his hands and exhibiting the greatest glee .
The cherub not presuming to address so tremendous an object , transacted her supper through the agency of a third person , as ' <NAME> to your Ma , <NAME> , my dear ' ; and ' <NAME> , I dare say your Ma would take some lettuce if you were to put it on her plate. ' Mrs <NAME> ' s manner of receiving those viands was marked by petrified absence of mind ; in which state , likewise , she partook of them , occasionally laying down her knife and fork , as saying within her own spirit , ' What is this I am doing ? ' and glaring at one or other of the party , as if in indignant search of information .
If he had been simply loving , he would have done <NAME> more good ; but she accepted him as he was -- when had she not accepted him as he was ! -- and made the most and best of him .

" I can guarantee that there is no secrecy in it .
' One night , after a day ' s sport in which he had outdone <NAME> or Gillingwater , and slaughtered " another fine bear , " and brought him home in triumph , the <NAME> sat moodily at the head of his table , eyeing the smoky roof of the hall with a discontented aspect .
She lay bereft of animation for hours ; and when life , look , and speech returned , her senses had deserted her , and she raved wildly and furiously .
His eminently practical friend , on seeing him , stopped also , and gave <NAME> a reproachful look that plainly said , ' Behold your Bounderby ! ' ' Well ! ' blustered <NAME> , ' what ' s the matter ?
' Lift him up , ' said <NAME> .
" But he might , you know .
Here he remained , with his head bowed upon his breast for some time , and then suddenly raising it , said , ' Once , and once for all , have you brought me any money ? ' ' No ! ' returned <NAME> .
You may or you may not be aware ( for perhaps you have not been much in the audience ) , that <NAME> has missed his tip very often , lately. ' ' Has—what has he missed ? ' asked <NAME> , glancing at the potent <NAME> for assistance .

From the dim doorway of <NAME> , within which <NAME> and her husband stood , they could see a comfortable little party of three persons sitting at supper in the bar , and could hear everything that was said .

<NAME> <NAME> naturally asked why not ?
<NAME> <NAME> went down to let him in , and he said on entering , ' Affery , I am glad it ' s you .
You say the suit is changing me ; <NAME> says it changes , has changed , and will change everybody who has any share in it .
I am very glad to be so .
<NAME> , that class of practitioners would be swept from the face of the earth .
It describes her rapid mental growth and improvement during twelve months more , and brings her little history down to the end of last year .
<NAME> night , <NAME> ! ' On awaking in the morning , <NAME> became conscious , by slow degrees , of whispering voices in his room .
' I so hate him for saying it ! ' ' For saying what , my dear ? ' laughed <NAME> .
-- ' But I object to it , and that ' s enough .
' The gentleman took my card .
Will you please come to the understanding that there shall be another interview on the subject ? ' ' With <NAME> , Mr Headstone ? ' ' With -- well , ' he answered , breaking off , ' yes !
Then he slowly released his left hand from its pocket , and made that bush of his whiskers , still contemplating him in silence .
But <NAME> ' s anger quickly gave way to curiosity when the procession turned down the identical courtyard in which he had met with the runaway Job Trotter ; and curiosity was exchanged for a feeling of the most gleeful astonishment , when the all-important <NAME> , commanding the sedan-bearers to halt , advanced with dignified and portentous steps to the very green gate from which <NAME> had emerged , and gave a mighty pull at the bell-handle which hung at the side thereof .
Having given in a hearty shake , he retired , growling , under a form ; just escaping the pewter measure which <NAME> levelled at his head .
<NAME> men passed above his head , and rose and rose ; but he was always at the bottom .

That may be eccentricity , or he may be proud of his legs .
The venerable baron caught his child to his arms , and shed a wink of joy .
' I do n't know what that means , ' replied <NAME> .
Very little life was to be seen on either bank , windows and doors were shut , and the staring black and white letters upon wharves and warehouses ' looked , ' said <NAME> to <NAME> , ' like inscriptions over the graves of dead businesses. ' As they glided slowly on , keeping under the shore and sneaking in and out among the shipping by back-alleys of water , in a pilfering way that seemed to be their boatman ' s normal manner of progression , all the objects among which they crept were so huge in contrast with their wretched boat , as to threaten to crush it .

There were no shortcomings anywhere , in anything but money .
' Good ! ' said Mr Meagles , cheerily .
For instance , it 's your object to take care of number one -- meaning yourself . '
' Because I have no other resting-place , ' was the reply .
But who else was there ? " " Who else ? " " It is the strangest thing , " said <NAME> , drifting into his lost look again ; " and yet I could swear to him. " Becoming alarmed , I entreated <NAME> to explain his meaning .
'It is useless , ' said the gentleman , with a sigh .
Our little room was like a ship 's cabin , and that delighted Charley very much .

<NAME> to change the brooding mind , or raise it up .
" Well , " retorted <NAME> ; " he 'll be paid. " " I do n't mean to imply that he wo n't , " said I , " but it might make you hold your tongue about us and our money , I should think. " " You should think ! " retorted <NAME> .
<NAME> hardly dared to raise her eyes , lest they should reveal the traces of tears ; far less dared to speak ; and <NAME> never uttered one word , unless in answer to a question .

Added to that , he had a blockhead confidence in his money and in his family greatness , which sometimes did him good service , -- almost taking the place of concentration and determined purpose .
He has shown nothing but his shell .
But , I would not take it away while he was present .
What shall I do ! ' The fountains of her heart were opened ; the child , overpowered by the weight of her sorrows and anxieties , by the first confidence she had ever shown , and the sympathy with which her little tale had been received , hid her face in the arms of her helpless friend , and burst into a passion of tears .

But what I thay , <NAME> , ith , that good tempered or bad tempered , I never did a horthe a injury yet , no more than thwearing at him went , and that I don ' t expect I thall begin otherwithe at my time of life , with a rider .

Whatever occurs to harass her , usually settles in her legs ; but on this occasion it mounted to the chest , and then to the head , and , in short , pervaded the whole system in a most alarming manner .

I could see nothing of the room except the shining of the fire in the window-glass , but I stiffened in all my joints with the consciousness that I was under close inspection .
But matters were no sooner in this state , than he devoted all his spare time ( and got up earlier to make it more ) to these perambulations .
The moment I come to you , take me in , and drive away. " " I understand that I wait for you under all circumstances ? " " You have my certificate in your hand with the rest , you know , and will reserve my place .
" Because really and truly , <NAME> , what I said and meant to say was that I trusted <NAME> to you and was sure you 'd bring him through it .
' I am not afraid to have it in my sleep , but I am so sad -- so very , very sad. ' The old man blessed him , the child in tears replied <NAME> night , and <NAME> was again alone .
<NAME> <NAME> softly opens the door of communication between that room and the next and looks in .
The old sexton soon got better , and was about again .
It was not difficult for me , on <NAME> ' s solicitation , to resolve to stay where I was , until after the remains of the poor carrier should have made their last journey to <NAME> .
' Well ! ' he said , looking to his bag , ' having seen you tonight , <NAME> ' r <NAME> ( and that doos me good !
Little Alick in a frock has already made arrangements for his union with a suitable young person at <NAME> .
The doctor then communicated , in reply to multifarious questions from his young friend , a precise account of his patient 's situation ; which was quite as consolatory and full of promise , as <NAME> 's statement had encouraged him to hope ; and to the whole of which , <NAME> , who affected to be busy about the luggage , listened with greedy ears .
' <NAME> ' t take on , old lady. ' ' But I can ' t bear to see you so , my dear. ' ' Nonsense !
So I break my staunch resolution , and think it may be , perhaps , as well to go to bed .
The institution never flagged for want of a story , I am certain ; and the wine lasted out almost as well as the matter .
There were the seats where the poor old people sat , worn spare , and yellow like themselves ; the rugged font where children had their names , the homely altar where they knelt in after life , the plain black tressels that bore their weight on their last visit to the cool old shady church .
You know , my dear Sir , if you _will _take the management of your affairs into your own hands after entrusting them to your solicitor , you must also take the consequences. ' Here <NAME> drew himself up with conscious dignity , and brushed some stray grains of snuff from his shirt frill .
When <NAME> , assenting to this , was gone , <NAME> lifted up his head , and said to his daughter : ' <NAME> , my dear , I have never , that I know of , seen this man .
And to sleep long and sound , " he answered ; " for I 've been sea-tossed and sea-washed , months and months. " " My friend and companion , " said I , rising from the sofa , " is absent ; you must have his room. " " He wo n't come back to-morrow ; will he ? " " <NAME> , " said I , answering almost mechanically , in spite of my utmost efforts ; " not to-morrow. " " Because , look'ee here , dear boy , " he said , dropping his voice , and laying a long finger on my breast in an impressive manner , " caution is necessary. " " How do you mean ?
You ask her to kneel at this bedside and be married to you , that your reparation may be complete .
And in a fourth , and a fifth , and a sixth , and a seventh , the noise , and the beer , and the tobacco smoke , and the cards , all came over again in greater force than before .
You forget however , that to put the case to <NAME> as his own , is to suppose to have done what I did. ' ' I ask his pardon , ' said <NAME> .
Who moved uneasily on his feet , rubbed his beard a little , and at length said : " Well !
If he ' s forgotten ' em , they ' ll soon remind him .
' My child is welcome , though unlooked for , ' said she , at the time presenting her cheek as if it were a cool slate for visitors to enrol themselves upon .
extraordinary indeed , ' rejoined <NAME> , taking a complacent pinch of snuff , and shaking his head gravely .
You have only to choose a trade , <NAME> , and be it .
For upwards of three years she reclined in a wheeled chair , looking attentively at those about her and appearing to understand what they said ; but the rigid silence she had so long held was evermore enforced upon her , and except that she could move her eyes and faintly express a negative and affirmative with her head , she lived and died a statue .
There is nothing of chance or doubt in the course before my son .
No , no , no , ' said <NAME> , shaking her head , and folding her arms ; ' not she , my dear .
' Bless my heart , <NAME> ! ' so the good lady argued ; ' if the <NAME> don ' t want this young lady to be married , why don ' t they file a bill against the <NAME> , make her a Chancery ward , and shut her up in the <NAME> prison for safety ? -- I have read of such things in the newspapers a hundred times .
We shall meet no more .
Would you have robbed me—for no one ' s enrichment—only for the greater desolation of this world—of the immaterial part of my life , the spring and summer of my belief , my refuge from what is sordid and bad in the real things around me , my school in which I should have learned to be more humble and more trusting with them , and to hope in my little sphere to make them better ? ' ' O no , no .
Now Guster , our young woman , is timid and has fits , and she , taking fright at the foreigner 's looks -- which are fierce -- and at a grinding manner that she has of speaking -- which is calculated to alarm a weak mind -- gave way to it , instead of bearing up against it , and tumbled down the kitchen stairs out of one into another , such fits as I do sometimes think are never gone into , or come out of , in any house but ours .
I am not a child , and I am not <NAME> , and I must speak. ' ' Fanny , ' gasped Mr Dorrit , after a majestic silence , ' if I request you to remain here , while I formally announce to Mrs General , as an exemplary lady , who is -- hum -- a trusted member of this family , the -- ha -- the change that is contemplated among us ; if I -- ha -- not only request it , but -- hum -- insist upon it -- ' ' Oh , papa , ' <NAME> broke in with pointed significance , ' if you make so much of it as that , I have in duty nothing to do but comply .
<NAME> stole over her at last ; her grasp relaxed , tightened , relaxed again , and they slept side by side .
What have you got to say ?
' It was so great a change : so great a loss , I felt it , at first , ' said <NAME> , still preserving the same look and tone , ' that I was agitated and distressed .
' Wo-o ! ' cried <NAME> , as the tall quadruped evinced a decided inclination to back into the coffee-room window .
And you recollect <NAME> , that wath thought to be rather thweet upon yourthelf ?
Some of the <NAME> ' s brethren had found themselves exceedingly uncomfortable in their minds , because they were required to bury the dead too hopefully .
He inquired , as he pointed to <NAME> , 'Do you know that person ? '
' It ' s the right sort of a house for such a thorough-built boatman. ' ' So ' tis , sir , so ' tis , sir , ' said <NAME> , grinning .
' Just about there. ' ' Does anybody open them , and shut them ?
Her mother and <NAME> accompanied them , but the worthy lady , pluming herself upon her discretion , took particular care not so much as to look at her daughter during the whole evening , and to seem wholly absorbed in the jokes and conversation of <NAME> , who , having been appointed sentry over <NAME> for that especial purpose , neglected , on his side , no possible opportunity of engrossing her attention .
It ' s not for me , with my family , to refuse , no more than it is to ask. ' ' And would you , <NAME> ' am , ' said the <NAME> , taking down the tin canister in which he kept his cash , from the top shelf of the cupboard , ' be so good as offer eighteen-pence a-piece to the little family all round ?
' Well then , what ' s the matter , <NAME> ? ' said <NAME> , coaxingly .
' Ladies and gentlemen , ' said <NAME> , suddenly rising .
<NAME> sounds and cries came by degrees into the street below ; the servants in the house were roused and busy ; faces looked in at the door , and voices asked his attendants softly how he was .
" 'Consequence , my father did n't make objections to my going to work ; so I went to work at my present calling , which were his too , if he would have followed it , and I worked tolerable hard , I assure you , <NAME> .
For the rest , <NAME> life to <NAME> is a vast blank of overgrown house looking out upon trees , sighing , wringing their hands , bowing their heads , and casting their tears upon the window-panes in monotonous depressions .
" <NAME> took it easy as a good riddance for both sides .
<NAME> me the little carriage for to-day , and for to-morrow ( if I don ' t succeed to-day ) , and I ' ll lie in wait for him. ' It was barely settled when a manly form was seen to pass the windows and heard to knock and ring .
In this order they reached the magistrate ' s house ; the chairmen trotting , the prisoners following , <NAME> oratorising , and the crowd shouting .
From this society , little <NAME> detached himself , on his clerk being announced in a whisper ; and repairing to the dining-room , there found <NAME> and <NAME> looking very dim and shadowy by the light of a kitchen candle , which the gentleman who condescended to appear in plush shorts and cottons for a quarterly stipend , had , with a becoming contempt for the clerk and all things appertaining to ' the office , ' placed upon the table .
Of course Veneering knows that if <NAME> chose to go there , he would be there , in a space of time that might be stated by the light and thoughtless as a jiffy .
<NAME> <NAME> , <NAME> , I should have lost the weapon .
That pale interval over , the picture began to enlarge and fill up so fast that at every new peep I could have found enough to look at for an hour .
" Your remembrance does me more honour than I had supposed it would , <NAME> , " he returned .
<NAME> by step , onward and downward , towards some end , yet so gradually , that she believed herself to remain motionless .
Next door at the back. ' ' O , ' returned <NAME> .
Assuredly he did look then , though he looked his politest , as if any real philanthropist could have desired no better employment than to lash a great stone to his neck , and drop him into the water flowing beyond the dark arched gateway in which he stood .
If you shouldn ' t find her out , you ' ll pay expenses at the <NAME> , and something for loss of time ? ' ' Well , ' said <NAME> , testily ; ' yes !
The hand soon stopped in the midst of them ; the light that had always been feeble and dim behind the weak transparency , went out ; and even Mrs. Gradgrind , emerged from the shadow in which man walketh and disquieteth himself in vain , took upon her the dread solemnity of the sages and patriarchs .
What _is_ a fellow to do for money , and where _am_ I to look for it , if not to my sister ? ' He was almost crying , and scattered the buds about by dozens .
it were well to die , indeed , at such a time !
As he did so , <NAME> very hastily drew back .
replied the young lady : drawing her chair up to the table , and putting her elbows upon it .
The stranger in the land who looks into ten thousand faces for some answering look and never finds it , is in cheering society as compared with him who passes ten averted faces daily , that were once the countenances of friends .
And what are the young couple saying as they leave the church , and go out at the gate ?
' And then there ' s that woman with the <NAME> name , ' said my aunt , ' that <NAME> , she goes and gets married next .
I see a beautiful city and a brilliant people rising from this abyss , and , in their struggles to be truly free , in their triumphs and defeats , through long years to come , I see the evil of this time and of the previous time of which this is the natural birth , gradually making expiation for itself and wearing out .
<NAME> gave me some more gravy .
Not that she had much to do , to do that , ' cried <NAME> , in a closing great burst of distress , ' for I was as bad as bad could be .
Our guest was in such spirits on the way home that I could do nothing but listen to him and wonder at him ; nor was I alone in this , for <NAME> yielded to the same fascination .
<NAME> ' t look round -- ' <NAME> had hardly power to repeat , ' Why not ? ' ' Because there ' s nothing there , my deary , ' said the <NAME> .
Take your time , and weigh it well. ' ' There is but one question , my dear ma ' am , I could wish to ask , ' said Mrs. Micawber .
" Why , you see , my dears , " said Mrs. Badger , " -- you 'll excuse me calling you my dears ? "
Away in the moonlight lie the woodland fields at rest , and the wide house is as quiet as the narrow one .
" Why then , do n't stand staring as if you was afraid , woman ; who 's the wiser ?
We all do it in one way or another .
It is called The Thorn of <NAME> .
<NAME> drew his breath yet more freely , and looked round with a smile of triumph .
I had no consolation in seeing how different she was from this detestable Rufus with the mulberry-coloured great-coat , for I felt that in the very difference between them , in the self-denial of her pure soul and the sordid baseness of his , the greatest danger lay .
<NAME> ' t let me detain you , sir ; I stand in need of no assistance , I thank you .
He despatched <NAME> to bring the carriage to the door ; caused the child to be carefully wrapped up ; bade old Betty get her bonnet on ; collected the toys , enabling the little fellow to comprehend that his treasures were to be transported with him ; and had all things prepared so easily that they were ready for the carriage as soon as it appeared , and in a minute afterwards were on their way .
Well , but I 'll answer you .
Satisfied that he was right in his original conjecture , he applied himself to calming the fears of <NAME> , which , after some time , he partially succeeded in doing , though not in removing the impression upon his mind ; for he still declared , again and again , in the most solemn and fervid manner , that he had positively seen what he had described , and that nothing could ever remove his conviction of its reality .
The mystery of her visits to the brothers <NAME> remained wholly unexplained , for <NAME> had not alluded to them , either in his preliminary conversations with the servant or his subsequent interview with the mistress , merely remarking that he had been instructed to watch the girl home and plead his young friend ' s cause , and not saying how far he had followed her , or from what point .
' So much humour , ' said <NAME> .
And <NAME> and <NAME> entered accordingly .
I have already some acquaintance with the law -- as a defendant on civil process -- and I shall immediately apply myself to the <NAME> of one of the most eminent and remarkable of our English jurists .
' No , I wasn ' t , sir ! ' cried <NAME> .
But that ' s just the way !
<NAME> <NAME> came to the gate , and positively reeled back when she saw me so changed ; her walnut-shell countenance likewise turned from brown to green and yellow .
' A good man , ' said the grandfather , looking after him ; ' a kind man .
I only ask to be free .
' No , my lady lass , ' returned the <NAME> .
' Good-bye ! ' said <NAME> , giving both his hands .
After a time he rose and rang the bell .
' There were five of us , ' returned his partner .
He then went on to tell her where Mr <NAME> was lying , and to request that a carriage might be placed at his disposal to bring him home .
Presently I saw his blue lips again , breathing on the tinder , and then a flare of light flashed up , and showed me <NAME> .
" He is called , I believe -- an -- ironmaster . "
Off he starts once more , with <NAME> half-way down the street ahead of him ; and after twice as long a run as the yesterday 's one , the man 's lost again !
<NAME> ! ' ( <NAME> was quite a rustic place to <NAME> . )
With a clink for the stout , -- Old Clem ! " I thought he had been drinking , but he was not drunk .
No one seemed surprised to see him , or interested in seeing him , or glad to see him , or sorry to see him , or spoke a word , except that somebody in the boat growled as if to dogs , " Give way , you ! " which was the signal for the dip of the oars .
Theer ' s mighty countries , fur from heer .
Once cast away as idle breath , no wealth or power can bring them back .
<NAME> <NAME> had yesterday pleaded Not <NAME> to an indictment denouncing him ( with infinite jingle and jangle ) for that he was a false traitor to our serene , illustrious , excellent , and so forth , prince , our Lord the King , by reason of his having , on divers occasions , and by divers means and ways , assisted <NAME> , the <NAME> King , in his wars against our said serene , illustrious , excellent , and so forth ; that was to say , by coming and going , between the dominions of our said serene , illustrious , excellent , and so forth , and those of the said <NAME> , and wickedly , falsely , traitorously , and otherwise evil-adverbiously , revealing to the said <NAME> what forces our said serene , illustrious , excellent , and so forth , had in preparation to send to <NAME> and <NAME> .
' You are very good , sir .
But they were overcome by unutterable amazement when Mr <NAME> , going close up to the most venerable of men and halting in front of the bottle-green waistcoat , made a trigger of his right thumb and forefinger , applied the same to the brim of the broad-brimmed hat , and , with singular smartness and precision , shot it off the polished head as if it had been a large marble .
<NAME> , apparently possessed by an impression that the reverend gentleman wants to cut his hair , shields his head with both arms and is got into the required position with great difficulty and every possible manifestation of reluctance .
What would he have done here , without his mother ! " ' " You shall not die , <NAME> , you shall not die ; " said the husband , starting up .
<NAME> told them all , and never was there a story which awakened so many emotions in the breasts of two eager listeners .
<NAME> <NAME> had still to be ferreted out from the back parlour of the <NAME> and <NAME> ; and <NAME> had scarcely accomplished this object , and communicated <NAME> ' s message , when the clock struck ten .
The words were read above the ashes of <NAME> , in a corner of a churchyard near the river ; in a churchyard so obscure that there was nothing in it but grass-mounds , not so much as one single tombstone .
' It embittered the life of your poor mother .
About a quarter of a mile off , in a quiet , substantial-looking street , stood an old red brick house with three steps before the door , and a brass plate upon it , bearing , in fat Roman capitals , the words , ' Mr .
when she had me for her theme .
I assure you I attach not the least importance to any opinions .
' However , you needn ' t be at the trouble of repeating it , for it ain ' t worth hearing , and won ' t go down with <NAME> .
And even now that <NAME> is strangled , I don ' t see a way to our bettering ourselves. ' Mr <NAME> added as he turned his pensive steps towards the <NAME> and shook his head , ' I didn ' t think this morning there was half so many Scarers in <NAME> .
Nobody having the hardihood to object to his doing so , he does it , and the party retire as they came up .
I know what I know .
" He IS the most wonderful creature !
You conspirators , and hiders , and runners-away , should know better than that .
I am quite bewildered by all this .
The little boys ' legs being too short to admit of their feet resting upon anything as they sat , and the little boys ' bodies being consequently in imminent hazard of being jerked off the coach , <NAME> had enough to do over the stones to hold them on .
Em ' ly ' s alive ! ' He put his hand down firmly on the table , and set his sunburnt face into a resolute expression .
But he will perish ; there is no real hope. " " Yes .
I said to <NAME> this would be one of the great <NAME> 's boats now , and we stopped to look .
don ' t stare at me , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> ; ' I recollect your words last night , <NAME> .
Yet he 's like you , there 's no denying .
Mr Dombey , who had never found her , kissed her once upon the forehead , and cautioned her not to run away again , or wander anywhere with treacherous attendants .
Last night , I went home .
" I saw one of <NAME> 's long effusions , I think ? "
<NAME> of your own strength now .
A. <NAME> , <NAME> , one pound .
<NAME> some bread and butter , <NAME> ; that ' s a love .
Her carriage towards <NAME> was as a carriage towards a young lady of good position , whom she had met in society a few years ago .
It was the Chief <NAME> .
' Yes , yes , he has , <NAME> , ' said the boy , reddening and laughing .
When you are ready , I am -- need I say with a Hey Ho Chivey , and likewise with a <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> ? ' ' Will nothing make you serious ? ' said <NAME> , laughing through his gravity .
He had supported me , as at first , all this time , and his tenderness was so precious to me that I leaned my head upon his shoulder and loved him as if he had been my father .
I do not remember one but it was clean and neat , and had its plant or two upon the window-sill , or row of crockery upon the shelf , or small display of coloured prints upon the whitewashed wall , or , perhaps , its wooden clock behind the door .
' And having liked no one else with whom we have ever been brought into contact , we had made up our minds not to like you. ' ' Really ? ' said <NAME> again .
<NAME> said that he would work his fingers to the bone for <NAME> , and <NAME> said that she would work her fingers to the bone for <NAME> , and they called me all sorts of endearing and sensible names , and we sat there , advising and talking , half the night .
I know a delightful washerwoman outside , that comes for my things twice a week ; and , by <NAME> ! -- how devilish lucky ! -- this is the day she calls .
He took an extraordinary interest in her fortunes when he first happened to encounter her ; and we gather from the inquiries we have made of him , that it was she in whose behalf he made that turmoil which led to your first acquaintance. ' <NAME> stammered out that he had before suspected the possibility of such a thing ; and in explanation of its having occurred to him , described when and where he had seen the young lady himself .
Now , I have only one thing more to say , you hammer-headed woman , and that is , that I haven ' t altogether made up my mind whether I might , or might not , have ever given you any trouble about the codicil .
When he has walked out , <NAME> , in a great perspiration , nerves himself to the hasty completion of the taking down of the <NAME> , concluding with <NAME> .
<NAME> ' s servant ! ' said Mrs. <NAME> , turning pale .
' Object of my scorn and hatred ! ' said <NAME> , ' I hold ye in contempt. ' <NAME> laughed in very unexpected enjoyment of this performance ; and the ladies , by way of encouragement , laughed louder than before ; whereat <NAME> assumed his bitterest smile , and expressed his opinion that they were ' minions ' .
' Leave go , I tell you ! ' thundered his master .
We had started from <NAME> at three o ' clock in the afternoon , and we were due in <NAME> about eight next morning .
' Two or three year older than <NAME> ' ly , but was at the school with her. ' ' I never heard her name , ' said I .
Mrs MacStinger ! ' <NAME> , whose eyes were now as wide open as they would be , and the knobs upon whose face were perfectly luminous , gave a long shrill whistle of a most melancholy sound , and stood gazing at everybody in a state of speechlessness .
Even this resource shortly failed him ; his irregularities were too great to admit of his earning the wretched pittance he might thus have procured , and he was actually reduced to a state bordering on starvation , only procuring a trifle occasionally by borrowing it of some old companion , or by obtaining an appearance at one or other of the commonest of the minor theatres ; and when he did earn anything it was spent in the old way .
' Now , dear Pa , ' said <NAME> , taking him by both ears as if he were a pitcher , and conveying his face to her rosy lips , ' we are in for it ! ' <NAME> came out to open the gate , waited on by that attentive cavalier and friend of the family , Mr <NAME> .
Mr Wegg , as an artful man who is sure of his supper by-and-bye , presses muffin on his host to soothe him into a compliant state of mind , or , as one might say , to grease his works .
Swear it was not true ?
' You ' ll have no conception of the value of your prize until you draw close to it .
But this being a round game , and one not necessarily limited to three or four players , was open to <NAME> too , who , bursting into the little crowd -- to the great terror of his wife -- and falling about in all directions , now to the right , now to the left , now forwards , now backwards , and accidentally driving his elbow through the hat of the tallest helper , who had been particularly active , speedily caused the odds to wear a very different appearance ; while more than one stout fellow limped away to a respectful distance , anathematising with tears in his eyes the heavy tread and ponderous feet of the burly Yorkshireman .
' Will you do as I do , <NAME> , my boy ? ' inquired his father , returning to his tea with new strength .
It is morning ; and <NAME> , made so trim by my aunt ' s hands , shows me how her pretty hair will curl upon the pillow yet , an how long and bright it is , and how she likes to have it loosely gathered in that net she wears .
This became the purpose of her life .
Sometimes she recited a few verses from <NAME> and the <NAME> ( if those are the right names , which I dare say they are not ) , and would become quite fiery with the sentiments they expressed .
' I heard of the outrage , ' said <NAME> , trying to constrain his working mouth , ' but I had not heard the end of it. ' ' Where were you , ' said the boy , advancing a step as he lowered his voice , ' when it was done ?
I am very glad to do so. " " Glad to part again , <NAME> ?
' Only us two , ' said the man .
Her keen eyes had espied Mr Fledgeby before Mr <NAME> had espied her , and he was paralysed in his purpose of shutting her out , not so much by her approaching the door , as by her favouring him with a shower of nods , the instant he saw her .
Harassed by these thoughts , he now began to wish the marriage over , <NAME> and his young wife gone , and himself left to fulfil his promise , and discharge the generous function he had accepted .
Be this as it may , however , it was his ninth birthday ; and he was keeping it in the coal-cellar with a select party of two other young gentleman , who , after participating with him in a sound thrashing , had been locked up for atrociously presuming to be hungry , when Mrs. Mann , the good lady of the house , was unexpectedly startled by the apparition of <NAME> , the beadle , striving to undo the wicket of the garden-gate .
<NAME> , for the instant , lost its lustre in his eyes , for there were countless treasures of the heart which it could never purchase .
I ' ll give you a clue to my trade , in a game of forfeits .
You and your father and who else there may be of you ? ' asked <NAME> , speaking deliberately , and meditatively turning the watch over and over .
' Clarence is a great ass , but he is one of the dearest and best fellows that ever lived ! ' It appeared , before the breakfast was over , that everybody whom this Gowan knew was either more or less of an ass , or more or less of a knave ; but was , notwithstanding , the most lovable , the most engaging , the simplest , truest , kindest , dearest , best fellow that ever lived .
Call it madness , and I tell you I ca n't help it now , and ca n't be sane .
But Ma talks ! ' That was plainly to be seen , for <NAME> was talking then at her usual canter , with arched head and mane , opened eyes and nostrils .
<NAME> taking no notice , the door was at length softly opened , and the dried face of a mild little elderly gentleman looked in .
" And you can refuse , you mean , eh ?
He has n't come home since the morning , so he may go without 'em .
He soon came round again , however ; and finding that <NAME> 's replies to his questions , were still as straightforward and consistent , and still delivered with as much apparent sincerity and truth , as they had ever been , he made up his mind to attach full credence to them , from that time forth .
I can understand what you tell me , so very much better than what I read in law-writings .
As long as her poor dear pretty was above the ground , she said , she would never desert her .
' He ' s as like her , <NAME> , ' said my aunt , emphatically , ' he ' s as like her , as she was that afternoon before she began to fret -- bless my heart , he ' s as like her , as he can look at me out of his two eyes ! ' ' Is he indeed ? ' said <NAME> .
As the countenance of the stout lady began to clear up , she ventured to inquire how far it was .
" A very eminent solicitor is in attendance , gentlemen , " says the coroner , " who , I am informed , was accidentally present when discovery of the death was made , but he could only repeat the evidence you have already heard from the surgeon , the landlord , the lodger , and the law-stationer , and it is not necessary to trouble him .
' <NAME> , my dear , how very absurd you are , ' returned his mother ; ' of course I mean that his glazed hat looks like a gentleman ' s servant , and not the wart upon his nose ; though even that is not so ridiculous as it may seem to you , for we had a footboy once , who had not only a wart , but a wen also , and a very large wen too , and he demanded to have his wages raised in consequence , because he found it came very expensive .
' Vith the bills for the lease , and that , there ' s eleven hundred and eighty pound here .
' I told you , the last time you were here with a grievance , that you had better turn about and come out of that .
'We must be active , <NAME> , and not give way to useless grief , ' said Mrs. Maylie , laying her finger on her lip , as she looked steadily into his face ; 'this letter must be sent , with all possible expedition , to <NAME> .
But injustice breeds injustice ; the fighting with shadows and being defeated by them necessitates the setting up of substances to combat ; from the impalpable suit which no man alive can understand , the time for that being long gone by , it has become a gloomy relief to turn to the palpable figure of the friend who would have saved him from this ruin and make HIM his enemy .
" And this is the heart that the same <NAME> , who is not otherwise to be mentioned between us , stepped in to estrange from me , " said he indignantly .
<NAME> , come and take it away from him ! ' Whether my aunt supposed , for the moment , that he kept her property in his neck-kerchief , I am sure I don ' t know ; but she certainly pulled at it as if she thought so .
" What did you say ? " " You can bear a little more light ? " " I must bear it , if you let it in. " ( Laying the palest shadow of a stress upon the second word . )
The news that <NAME> had been caught and brought back in triumph , ran like wild-fire through the hungry community , and expectation was on tiptoe all the morning .
' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , broken down , and miserably submissive to him , ' have you a heart ? ' ' The circulation , sir , ' returned <NAME> , smiling at the oddity of the question , ' couldn ' t be carried on without one .
That it has been his constant practice to minister to that passion basely , and to flatter it corruptly , is indubitable .
I wish to know what you want with me. ' ' And so you shall. ' <NAME> had looked hard at his hands and his pockets , apparently as a precautionary measure lest he should have any weapon about him .
As it was next to impossible for men so much agitated as they were by this time , to sit still and move so slowly , all three got out and plodded on behind the carriage .
The barns and outhouses are mouldering away ; the sheds are patched and half roofless ; the log cabins ( built in <NAME> with external chimneys made of clay or wood ) are squalid in the last degree .
" Very full -- er -- excuse me -- lady 's name , <NAME> and surname both ? "

<NAME> ' t it done every day by all the masters about ?
As he called <NAME> ' Lass ' , and gave her a hearty smack on the cheek , I had no doubt , from the general propriety of her conduct , that he was her brother ; and so he turned out -- being presently introduced to me as <NAME> , the master of the house .
On this occasion she was so much disturbed in mind as to find it necessary to open the bedroom door , and make a course for herself , comprising the full extent of the bedrooms from wall to wall ; and while <NAME> and I sat quietly by the fire , she kept passing in and out , along this measured track , at an unchanging pace , with the regularity of a clock-pendulum .
He needn ' t wait , Carker. ' ' You needn ' t wait , <NAME> , ' observed Mr Carker : bare to the gums .
Still my advice is so far worth taking , that -- in short , that I have never taken it myself , and am the ' -- here <NAME> , who had been beaming and smiling , all over his head and face , up to the present moment , checked himself and frowned -- ' the miserable wretch you behold. ' ' My dear Micawber ! ' urged his wife .
The tide , beginning to run down at nine , and being with us until three , we intended still to creep on after it had turned , and row against it until dark .
Such a clerk for you , <NAME> , such a prize , such an ace of trumps .
' What ! ' ejaculated <NAME> , laying his hand upon his note-book .
Having rescued the most defenceless of his compatriots from situations of great extremity , he now went his way alone , or as nearly alone as he could be , with a native gentleman in a suit of grease and a cap of the same material , giving chase at a distance of some fifty yards , and continually calling after him , ' Hi !
<NAME> -- <NAME> , ' continued Mrs. Nickleby , considering .
He shaded his eyes with his hand ; grazed at his opponent , steadfastly , for a few moments ; and , then taking the weapon which was tendered to him , bent his eyes upon that , and looked up no more until the word was given , when he instantly fired .
His presence is an insult to my sister .
But I kept my ground .
'So they are , ' said the undertaker .
My second reason was , that I always hoped there might be some lingering possibility of your brother ' s relenting towards you both ; and in that case , I felt that where there was the chance of a man of his suspicious , watchful character , discovering that you had been secretly befriended by me , there was the chance of a new and fatal cause of division .
'What 's the matter here , my dear ? '
He got from me , through my not knowing where to strike , in the whirling round of the room , and the flashing of flames of fire between us .
Unless he dived overboard. ' The informer wiped his brow ruefully as he said it , sitting in his boat and always staring disconsolate .
It would not be worth mentioning for its own sake , but I was wakeful and rather low-spirited .
' I only ask of him , ' continued <NAME> , whose tears fell while she spoke , ' that he will move so little out of his way , in my behalf , as to enable me by his recommendation -- only by his recommendation -- to earn , literally , my bread and remain with my mother .
' A conspiracy to defeat the ends of justice , and murder its officers .
' It ' s very impolite , I know , but I came to see my poor <NAME> , my only friend .
' <NAME> , sirrah ! ' cried <NAME> , looking up at the old gateway , and showing in the moonlight like some monstrous image that had come down from its niche and was casting a backward glance at its old house , ' faster ! ' ' It ' s a dreadful heavy load , <NAME> , ' the boy pleaded .
There happened , by good fortune , to be a lounger really waiting for some one ; and he sometimes looked over the railing at the water , and sometimes came to the dark corner and looked up the street , rendering <NAME> less conspicuous .
All the aid it can have in the very high character and ability of the <NAME> , not only here but elsewhere , it has , and well deserves to have ; but it may need something more : not to impress the thoughtful and the well-informed , but the ignorant and heedless ; a class which includes some prisoners and many witnesses .
No , <NAME> , I have not worrited and frightened any sweet creetur to an early grave ! ' He eyed her gloomily -- remorsefully I thought -- for an instant ; and said , turning his head towards me , but looking at my feet instead of my face : ' We are not likely to encounter soon again ; -- a source of satisfaction to us both , no doubt , for such meetings as this can never be agreeable .
" I have had the honour of being employed in high families before , and you have no idea -- come , I 'll go so far as to say not even YOU have any idea , sir , " this to the debilitated cousin , " what games goes on ! "
' He says besides , ' she observed , with a slow curling of her lip , ' that his master , as he hears , is coasting <NAME> ; and this done , is away to gratify his seafaring tastes till he is weary .
I see , now , that I might have managed it better .
When I had none , I used to look at a venison shop in <NAME> Street ; or I have strolled , at such a time , as far as <NAME> , and stared at the pineapples .
But have you been very dutiful to me ? ' ' I ! ' cried the old woman .
If my cough takes me , I shall cough out twenty matches afore I gets a light. ' But she finds the candle , and lights it , before the cough comes on .
He knows me , " said <NAME> , with his hand already on the dining-room lock .
' <NAME> , I warn you , that I think it will surprise you ! ' More attention and concentration came into <NAME> ' s eyes as they caught sight of <NAME> smoothing his head again , and again looking at the fire ; but now , with a compressed and determined mouth .
Let me see , what was I -- oh yes , I know .
" From this prison here of horror , whence I every hour tend nearer and nearer to destruction , I send you , <NAME> heretofore the <NAME> , the assurance of my dolorous and unhappy service .
I saw in him when he first came here , almost my other self. ' ' Your other self ! ' repeated the Manager , disdainfully .
They found <NAME> , in company with <NAME> , talking very earnestly , and not bestowing a look on the groups who were congregated on the racket-ground ; they were very motley groups too , and worth the looking at , if it were only in idle curiosity .
' Settle it between yourselves , settle it between yourselves. ' ' No , but I must beg you as a favour , ' said <NAME> , ' to hear me give him notice of what it is my fixed intention to do -- my fixed intention , sir , ' repeated <NAME> , darting an angry look at her husband .
" Two can go up town .
We tapped at the door and went in .
Come to our honest friend. ' He led him to the post of watch , and they both dropped down and crept under the lee of the boat ; a better shelter than it had seemed before , being directly contrasted with the blowing wind and the bare night .
She is a thing of light , and airiness , and joy .
Little Dorrit with a cry of pleasure put her arms about her father ' s neck , and kissed him again and again .
She will be , ' in his fatal freshness he seems to find perpetual verdure and eternal youth in the phrase , ' she will be so glad of the opportunity , I am sure ! ' In the meantime , <NAME> , unable to originate a mistake on her own account , because <NAME> is the only other lady there , does her best in the way of handsomely supporting her husband ' s , by looking towards Mr Twemlow with a plaintive countenance and remarking to Mrs Veneering in a feeling manner , firstly , that she fears he has been rather bilious of late , and , secondly , that the baby is already very like him .
' He got a curiosity to go and taste the beer at a new public-house over the way , and it wos such a wery nice parlour , that he took it into his head to go there every night , which he did for a long time , always comin ' back reg ' lar about a quarter of an hour afore the gate shut , which was all wery snug and comfortable .
When I first came here , and ever since , I am sure I have tried to be as much your friend , as one of my age could presume to be ; but it has been of no use .
A little reservation I fear I must confess to .
The two gentlemen having , by the greediness with which this little bait was swallowed , tested the extent of Mrs. Wititterly ' s appetite for adulation , proceeded to administer that commodity in very large doses , thus affording to <NAME> an opportunity of pestering <NAME> with questions and remarks , to which she was absolutely obliged to make some reply .
<NAME> being again restored , a delicious half-hour -- so <NAME> called it , in the course of subsequent conversation with <NAME> as they were walking home -- was spent in conversation , and <NAME> ' s watch at length apprising him that it was high time to depart , the ladies were left alone , though not without many offers on the part of <NAME> to remain until <NAME> arrived , no matter what hour of the night it might be , if , after the late neighbourly irruption , they entertained the least fear of being left to themselves .
And when a man with bulgy legs , and a rough voice , and a heavy basket on his head that crushed his hat into a mere black muffin , came crying flowers down <NAME> ' s Place , making his timid little roots of daisies shudder in the vibration of every yell he gave , as though he had been an ogre , hawking little children , summer recollections were so strong upon <NAME> , that she shook her head , and murmured she would be comparatively old before she knew it -- which seemed likely .
You may depend upon it that this means something besides dinner. ' ' Tea and supper , perhaps , ' suggested <NAME> .
He had just enough recollection of the face to desire to do that .
They enable <NAME> , though it has cheeks like peaches , and knees like bunches of blossoms , and rosy swellings for calves to its legs and muscles to its arms , to look tolerably cool to-night .
<NAME> accepted the commission with his own free elegance of manner , and swore he would discharge it before he was an hour older .
I was not mistaken ; for the mop came into the schoolroom before long , and turned out <NAME> and me , who lived where we could , and got on how we could , for some days , during which we were always in the way of two or three young women , who had rarely shown themselves before , and were so continually in the midst of dust that I sneezed almost as much as if <NAME> had been a great snuff-box .
' I have used no such expressions. ' ' If you refer , then , to the poorness of your blood— ' ' <NAME> upon me , ' stipulated the <NAME> , expressly , ' at a boarding-school— ' ' Then , ' resumed <NAME> , ' all I can say is , that I am bound to believe , on your asseveration , that it is very poor indeed .
Here is <NAME> , with a variety of qualifications , with great talent -- I should say , with genius , but that may be the partiality of a wife -- ' Traddles and I both murmured ' No. ' ' And here is <NAME> without any suitable position or employment .
To these were added such considerations as the constant residence of <NAME> at a long distance from <NAME> , which rendered his association with <NAME> a mere masquerading frolic , in which nobody was likely to recognise him , either at the time or afterwards ; the impossibility of <NAME> ' s undertaking the task himself , he being already known to her by sight ; and various comments on the uncommon tact and experience of Mr Squeers : which would make his overreaching one old woman a mere matter of child ' s play and amusement .
" She was pretty enough to have been married long ago .
They were but an atom , here , in a mountain heap of misery , the very sight of which increased their hopelessness and suffering .
We will walk forward at once. ' Having given this direction , and settled with the coachman , <NAME> and his three friends struck into the footpath across the fields , and walked briskly away , leaving <NAME> and the fat boy confronted together for the first time .
" My dear son , " said <NAME> , " and dear daughter , I have done my duty .
To my surprise , I heard no more about it for some two or three weeks , though I was sufficiently interested in the result of his endeavours ; descrying a strange gleam of good sense -- I say nothing of good feeling , for that he always exhibited -- in the conclusion to which he had come .
I have not the power of counting .
As the brother and sister stood side by side , with a gallant bearing which became them well , a close likeness between them was apparent , which many , had they only seen them apart , might have failed to remark .
Encamped at a quarter before nine , in good time to touch his three-cornered hat to the oldest of men as they passed in to <NAME> 's , <NAME> took up his station on this windy March morning , with young <NAME> standing by him , when not engaged in making forays through the <NAME> , to inflict bodily and mental injuries of an acute description on passing boys who were small enough for his amiable purpose .
' Precisely so , ' assented Mrs. Micawber .
<NAME> , <NAME> , let ' s explore the polar regions , and have it over. ' She then selected two or three of the little instruments , and a little bottle , and asked ( to my surprise ) if the table would bear .
And , with the blessing of fate and fortune , I ' ll go on improving that woman ' s acquaintance until I have given her maid , before her eyes , things from my dressmaker ' s ten times as handsome and expensive as she once gave me from hers ! ' Little <NAME> was silent ; sensible that she was not to be heard on any question affecting the family dignity , and unwilling to lose to no purpose her sister ' s newly and unexpectedly restored favour .
For three heavy hours , the stone faces of the chateau , lion and human , stared blindly at the night .
And why shouldn ' t he , if he thinks proper ! ' I said : ' Certainly , aunt. ' ' It ' s not a business-like way of speaking , ' said my aunt , ' nor a worldly way .
" Tell me that you are better to-day . "
So if you will walk round and round here with me , we can lock ourselves in and I can tell you comfortably what I wanted to see your dear good face about . "
However , I loved her faithfully ; and one time I went home with her for the holidays .
If I have said too much , or more than I meant , what of it ?
<NAME> till you are a woman , and don ' t talk about what you don ' t understand .
' You take her with you ! ' She answered for him , with a burst of tears .
I do not deny that he is improvident .
It was a pleasant key to touch , for <NAME> suddenly burst into a roar of laughter , and rubbed his hands up and down his legs , as he had been accustomed to do when he enjoyed himself in the long-shipwrecked boat .
Because I ' m ruined , my dear ! ' If the house , and every one of us , had tumbled out into the river together , I could hardly have received a greater shock .
When he withdrew into the room again , he said ' Poor creatures ! ' in a tone of much pity for their miserable condition .
I done it for his money .
<NAME> consider everything yours that you find upon the -- upon the body .
' Be so kind as to keep the door open a moment , <NAME> , that I may see him go along the passage and down the steps .
' That ' s enough for me , ' she replied , with great earnestness and interest of manner .
So unspoilt , so simple , such a good soul !
Would the gentleman give him his card , as he had seen him first ?
As the schoolmaster , after arranging the two forms in due order , took his seat behind his desk and made other preparations for school , the child was apprehensive that she might be in the way , and offered to withdraw to her little bedroom .
'What , ' cried the young lady , 'can be the end of this poor creature 's life ! '
' I ' m only too glad not to speak in this house , excepting when and where I ' m spoke to , sir ; and with regard to being a female , sir , I should wish to know what you considered yourself ? ' ' A miserable wretch , ' exclaimed <NAME> , striking his forehead .
Some such picture , with no real world in it , bright with the light of our innocence , and vague as the stars afar off , was in my mind all the way .
' Ah , sister , why do you turn away your face ? ' Nell could not help following at a little distance .
I tried over and over again in my own room at night , but I could not write an answer that at all began like a good answer , so I thought each night I would wait one more day .
Then she began to drag him , in her childish eagerness , towards the door ; and he , nothing loth to go , accompanied her .
He now told him to go on again and said to me , after considering within himself for a few moments , that he had made up his mind how to proceed .
I was not made the less so by my sense of being daily more and more shut out and alienated from my mother .
He walked slowly on ; and shunning the roadside like a guilty man , turned into a meadow he well remembered ; and covering his face with his hands , threw himself upon the grass .
' You on the top of a pair of steps with the phenomenon in an attitude ; " <NAME> ! " on a transparency behind ; and nine people at the wings with a squib in each hand -- all the dozen and a half going off at once -- it would be very grand -- awful from the front , quite awful. ' As <NAME> appeared by no means impressed with the solemnity of the proposed effect , but , on the contrary , received the proposition in a most irreverent manner , and laughed at it very heartily , <NAME> abandoned the project in its birth , and gloomily observed that they must make up the best bill they could with combats and hornpipes , and so stick to the legitimate drama .
A man ca n't starve ; at least I ca n't .
' I lie here , sometimes , thinking I should like to live until I had had a little time to show you how grateful I could be !
' Now , wait a bit , <NAME> ; there ' s something more .
The <NAME> , heretofore a source of exclusive interest in the streets , became a mere secondary consideration , and to be important only as a part of the show of which she was the chief attraction .
Take your hat off. ' With this , <NAME> , in the most dexterous manner , knocked <NAME> ' s hat to the other side of the room , with such violence , that he had very nearly caused him to swallow the gold toothpick into the bargain .
' It may be out of the ordinary course , and yet be business .
How the fascinating <NAME> gets on when arraying herself for the bewilderment of the senses of men , is known only to the <NAME> and her maid ; but perhaps even that engaging creature , though not reduced to the self-dependence of <NAME> could dispense with a good deal of the trouble attendant on the daily restoration of her charms , seeing that as to her face and neck this adorable divinity is , as it were , a diurnal species of lobster -- throwing off a shell every forenoon , and needing to keep in a retired spot until the new crust hardens .
Now , <NAME> showed that she had struggled through a great lot of brambles which were not as high as her face ; but which she could not have got through and kept her hands out of ; and bits of those brambles were actually found in her skin and put in evidence , as well as the fact that the brambles in question were found on examination to have been broken through , and to have little shreds of her dress and little spots of blood upon them here and there .
I wants to go there and be berried .
' Call in all the servants , ' cried old <NAME> , interposing to prevent the public rebuke which <NAME> would otherwise most indubitably have received from his master .
I apprehend the girl ' s fortune will be very small ; <NAME> might have done much better ; there is scarcely anything to compensate for the connection : still , he acts for himself ; and if I find no improvement within a short time , I see no other course than to resign myself and make the best of these people .
' O , I never can forgive the wanton cruelty of <NAME> ! ' ' My dear , ' said Mr Dorrit , recovering his tone , though he remained unusually pale , ' I must request you not to say so .
' Why don ' t you go down and knock ' em every one downstairs ?
Nevertheless , in the <NAME> creature with the haymaking rake , were clearly to be discerned the rudiments of the Patriarch with the list shoes .
" If it war n't for me you 'd have been to the churchyard long ago , and stayed there .
Alone , in a sequestered place , surrounded by vestiges of old time and decay , it rather has a tendency to call a shudder into being .
In consequence of which his buttons became more importunate of public notice than before , with the exception of two or three about the region of the waistband , which modestly withdrew into a creasy retirement .
Now I will , now I will .
Which so tickled the spectators , that they laughed almost as heartily as <NAME> could have done if he had heard the request .
I looks like a sort of compo of every one on ' em .
On his house-top , he displayed pike and cap , as a good citizen must , and in a window he had stationed his saw inscribed as his " Little Sainte Guillotine " -- for the great sharp female was by that time popularly canonised .
I repudiate , for the moment , my politeness , and say , <NAME> , lies , lies .
It now shone brightly , through the door of communication .
If he says yes , and asks you where the ashes are , refer him to <NAME> , and he will hear of something not at all to his advantage ! ' The triumphant flourish with which <NAME> delivered himself of these words , had a powerful effect in alarming the mother ; who cried out , in much agitation : ' <NAME> , <NAME> !
I think it ' s five-and- twenty , but I don ' t rightly know vether it ain ' t more. ' ' Well ; that ' s pretty well , ' said <NAME> .
' ' Cos ugliness and svindlin ' never ought to be formiliar with elegance and wirtew , ' replied <NAME> .
The clock ticks over the fireplace , the weather-glass hangs in the hall .
' No , ' replied <NAME> , shaking his head , ' far from it -- far from it. ' ' I pity them , ' observed Mrs. Crummles .
<NAME> <NAME> , an indistinct form against the dark street now dotted with lamps , looms in my <NAME> 's view , bigger and blacker than before .
I walk to the front window , and look across the road upon a long , straggling row of houses , one story high , terminating , nearly opposite , but a little to the left , in a melancholy piece of waste ground with frowzy grass , which looks like a small piece of country that has taken to drinking , and has quite lost itself .
' Undraw the curtains , my dear girl , ' said <NAME> , after a while , ' and let us see our wedding-day. ' The sun was rising , and his first rays struck into the room , as she came back , and put her lips to his .
Still , it must be remembered that to support an existence there during many years , required a certain combination of qualities -- he did not say high qualities , but qualities -- moral qualities .
How he rather supposed himself to have pursued the idea into its next degree , because there was something uncommon in the quiet little seamstress , which pleased him and provoked his curiosity .
I have had occasion to notice many hands ; but I never saw stronger in that respect , man 's or woman 's , than these. " While he said these words in a leisurely , critical style , she continued to look at every one of us in regular succession as we sat .
Seeing , as she patted the pillow into its place on the bolster , that he was still looking at her as if waiting for the rest of her reply , she gave it a great poke in the middle , and asked , ' How could I help myself ? ' ' <NAME> could you help yourself from being married ! ' ' O ' course , ' said <NAME> .
My parting blessing on my love .
Was one of those voices <NAME> ' s ? ' ' Yes , it were , Sir. ' And Mrs. Cluppins , after distinctly stating that <NAME> addressed himself to Mrs. <NAME> , repeated by slow degrees , and by dint of many questions , the conversation with which our readers are already acquainted .
" I have squared it with the lad , " says <NAME> , returning , " and it 's all right .
The tide is low , and seems to have thrown them together high on the bare shore .
I want you to marry the widow. " ' " Me , <NAME> ! " said <NAME> .
The first object with which they had an association , or of which they had a remembrance , was a large black board with a dry Ogre chalking ghastly white figures on it .
' Mrs Dombey becomes a secondary consideration , when we are both in question , I imagine , ' said Mr Dombey .
' Begin by believing that I will try to make you happy , and that I am prepared to love you , <NAME> .
' It is there with the express intention that everything shall be left alone .
His garments and outward appearance .
' I ain ' t a person to live with them as has had money left .
I shouldn ' t be surprised for one. ' ' You are quite a philosopher , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
There was a tacit understanding between him and the men into whose hands they originally went -- and from whom I have by degrees purchased the whole , for treble and quadruple their nominal value -- that these loans should be from time to time renewed , until a given period had elapsed .
" I am my own engineer , and my own carpenter , and my own plumber , and my own gardener , and my own Jack of all Trades , " said <NAME> , in acknowledging my compliments .
" There is not much to see here , " said I .
" And <NAME> blows away at his bassoon , and you 're respectable civilians one and all , " says <NAME> .
There , <NAME> turned , and came back again , and so in due course of time got himself shut up in his sanctuary by the chocolate sprites , and was seen no more .
" That was not my meaning , " returns <NAME> .
<NAME> had a couple of pair , and the fat boy announced that there were half a dozen more downstairs ; whereat <NAME> expressed exquisite delight , and looked exquisitely uncomfortable .
She took it , and I ' ll follow it .
But though <NAME> ' s eye wanders , she is much offended if mine does , and frowns to me , as I stand upon the seat , that I am to look at the clergyman .
I ' ll go and fetch ' em. ' After being some time absent , as if in his covetousness he could hardly make up his mind to produce the treasure to his partner , he returned with an old leathern hat-box , into which he had put the other box , for the better preservation of commonplace appearances , and for the disarming of suspicion .
May you repent of it , sir , and live to know better ! ' She was so very earnest and injured , that <NAME> , shocked by the possibility which dawned upon him , said in a gentler tone : ' Do you deny , then , madam , that you left your son to—to be brought up in the gutter ? ' ' Josiah in the gutter ! ' exclaimed Mrs. Pegler .
But -- ' ' Eh ! ' said Mr Boffin .
I never should have been got into my present state if I hadn ' t come here .
However , she had no right to be offended of course .
Now , the fact was , that at that particular moment , <NAME> was sitting on the bed with the reddest face ever seen , cramming the corner of the pillow into his mouth , to prevent his roaring out loud with laughter .
Mr Dorrit , dressing-gowned and newspapered , was at his breakfast .
I was such a shy little thing that I seldom dared to open my lips , and never dared to open my heart , to anybody else .
I should be surprised if he could .
Then why go into subjects , old chap , which as betwixt two sech must be for ever onnecessary ?
She watched his face as earnestly as he watched the river .
Through the beaming smile with which he regarded me as he reasoned thus , there now broke forth a look of disinterested benevolence quite astonishing .
She lay there with one arm creeping round a bar of the iron gate and seeming to embrace it .
But I owe it to <NAME> , and to <NAME> ' s sister ( and in a much lower degree to myself ) , to say to you that I _know_ I was in the full possession and understanding of <NAME> ' s mind and heart at the time of this occurrence ; and that , without in the least colouring or concealing what was to be deplored in him and required to be corrected , I feel certain that his tale is true .
The atmosphere seemed tainted with the smell of coffins .
' You have disregarded all my quiet interference in the miserable lad ' s behalf , ' said <NAME> ; ' you have returned no answer to the letter in which I begged forgiveness for him , and offered to be responsible that he would remain quietly here .
From the dimly-lighted passages of the court , the last sediment of the human stew that had been boiling there all day , was straining off , when <NAME> , <NAME> , his daughter , <NAME> , the solicitor for the defence , and its counsel , <NAME> , stood gathered round <NAME> -- just released -- congratulating him on his escape from death .
" Then you must bring him some evening which is not a <NAME> night , or a <NAME> night , or a Ramification night .
' <NAME> , breakfast. ' No second invitation was required .
' Here they are , ' said <NAME> ; and , as he spoke , the forms of <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> appeared in the distance .
<NAME> too remained in a thoughtful state ; fearing every moment to hear the <NAME> impeached , and unable to resist the conviction that she must be guilty .
" I remember the young lady very well .
" No , indeed , cousin <NAME> , " said <NAME> , " I am sure I could not -- I am sure I would not -- think any ill of <NAME> if the whole world did .
We were obliged to say that we had not the pleasure of <NAME> 's acquaintance .
He did not venture , therefore , to advance towards her ; but the door by which he had entered was behind him , and he stepped back to lock it .
When he had closed the door , he re-opened it , stared in again for a few moments with the same portentous gravity , and nodding his head once , in a slow and ghost-like manner , vanished .
<NAME> <NAME> ' s face was fiery , and his eyes were small , and deep in his head ; he had thick veins in his forehead , a little nose , and a large chin .
The old fireside had smiled upon that same sweet face ; it had passed , like a dream , through haunts of misery and care ; at the door of the poor schoolmaster on the summer evening , before the furnace fire upon the cold wet night , at the still bedside of the dying boy , there had been the same mild lovely look .
But I say ; wa ' at be a ' this aboot schoolmeasther ? ' ' You know it then ? ' said <NAME> .
Now , ducky , ducky , ducky , come to Mrs .
Forgive me for having ever darkened your dark home -- I am a shadow on it , I know well -- and let us never speak of this again. ' ' Mama , ' sobbed <NAME> , ' we are not to part ? ' ' We do this that we may not part , ' said <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> was well-nigh distracted on the receipt of four closely-written and closely-crossed sides of congratulation on the very subject which had prevented her closing her eyes all night , and kept her weeping and watching in her chamber ; still worse and more trying was the necessity of rendering herself agreeable to Mrs. Wititterly , who , being in low spirits after the fatigue of the preceding night , of course expected her companion ( else wherefore had she board and salary ? )
And who , ' he added convincingly , ' must be a low-minded thief , you know , or he never could have conducted himself as he did. ' ' And see , ' said <NAME> , ' see what is involved in this !
Good-night. ' Excusing himself , in these terms , from joining in the festivities , <NAME> took a most winning farewell of Mrs. <NAME> and the other ladies , and retired , after making a very extraordinary impression upon the company .
<NAME> night , and Heaven send our journey may have a prosperous ending ! ' <NAME> was no sluggard next morning , but , springing from his bed some time before day , began to prepare for his welcome expedition .
He ' d carry me up with him .
' Oh , it ' s very hard upon a cove , <NAME> , ' cried the tender <NAME> , injured and indignant in a moment , ' that he can ' t give lawful warning , without being frowned at in that way , and called a deserter .
<NAME> <NAME> ' s upright and honourable bearing , coupled with that force and energy of speech which so eminently distinguished him , would have carried conviction to any reasonable mind ; but , unfortunately , at that particular moment , the mind of <NAME> was in anything but reasonable order .
But , the <NAME> , inclining to the belief that they were required to do one or two other things ( say out of nine-and-thirty ) calculated to trouble their consciences rather more if they would think as much about them , held his peace .
That ' s the little fellow , <NAME> ' am , that was the innocent cause of so much. ' ' This here , <NAME> ' am , ' said <NAME> , ' is him with the short legs -- and they was , ' said Mr Toodle , with a touch of poetry in his tone , ' unusual short for leathers -- as Mr <NAME> made a Grinder on. ' The recollection almost overpowered <NAME> .
You nodded to me , sir ? ' ' <NAME> , pooh , nonsense .
My <NAME> 's figure begins to be expressive of some attention .

Early in the morning , <NAME> , leaving <NAME> in high domestic trust , set off for the <NAME> tent .
The lowest , cruelest , and worst populace of a city , never without its quantity of low , cruel , and bad , were the directing spirits of the scene : noisily commenting , applauding , disapproving , anticipating , and precipitating the result , without a check .
' My friend , how is it possible for me to tell how long you are to lie here ?
' The feeling does you a great deal of honour , ' replied <NAME> ; ' but it is your duty , nevertheless. ' ' I know it is my duty , <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> , with great emotion .

" Well ! " said <NAME> , with a half complaining and half apologetic shrug .
I may have said to one or two friends that she wos a very divine creechure , and had refused one or two offers without any hobvus cause , but -- no , no , no , indeed , <NAME> -- before strangers , too -- it ' s not right -- you shouldn ' t .

' Then , dreams of their young , happy life -- happy to him though laden with pain and early care -- visited his pillow yet oftener than before ; and every night , a boy again , he was at his brother ' s side .

It was , by this time , within an hour of noon , and although a dense vapour still enveloped the city they had left , as if the very breath of its busy people hung over their schemes of gain and profit , and found greater attraction there than in the quiet region above , in the open country it was clear and fair .

And , even then , she never thought or spoke about him , but with something of her old , clear , merry laugh .
It is out of the <NAME> and restoration you have brought to me , that these remembrances arise , and pass between us and the moon on this last night. -- What did I say just now ? " " She knew nothing of you .

Now much disturbed , and dazzled with conflicting gleams of hope and dread , I looked at her for some explanation .
( I expected <NAME> might have got it by this time . ) "

I doen ' t believe I should have done so much as look at him .
They enter , locking themselves in , descend the rugged steps , and are down in the <NAME> .
Mrs Gowan , I hope I am not over-sensitive .
But so long accustomed to suppress emotion and keep down reality , so long schooled for her own purposes in that destructive school which shuts up the natural feelings of the heart like flies in amber and spreads one uniform and dreary gloss over the good and bad , the feeling and the unfeeling , the sensible and the senseless , she had subdued even her wonder until now .

I mentioned to <NAME> in the morning , that I wanted leave of absence for a short time ; and as I was not in the receipt of any salary , and consequently was not obnoxious to the implacable Jorkins , there was no difficulty about it .

He perceived that his master was leading up to the orders he was to take , and he waited to understand them .
I am not acquainted with that language myself , but I should judge from her manners and appearance that she was <NAME> ; anyways , certainly foreign .

I made fur them mountains , <NAME> ' r <NAME> , day and night .
As indeed he might , if he chose , for anything he knew of the matter .
' <NAME> ' t be too hard upon me .
He pressed the work-worn , hunger-worn young fingers , and touched his lips .

It was a sorrowful strain of parting , and the fresh young voice was very plaintive and tender .
A few words passed between them while they were thus engaged , but as their voices were partially stifled by the cupboard , all that <NAME> could distinguish was , that <NAME> said what Mrs. Squeers had said , was injudicious , and that Mrs. <NAME> said what <NAME> said , was ' stuff. ' A vast deal of searching and rummaging ensued , and it proving fruitless , <NAME> was called in , and pushed by Mrs. Squeers , and boxed by <NAME> ; which course of treatment brightening his intellects , enabled him to suggest that possibly Mrs. Squeers might have the spoon in her pocket , as indeed turned out to be the case .

The monotonous ringing of the bells and tramping of the horses ; the monotony of his anxiety , and useless rage ; the monotonous wheel of fear , regret , and passion , he kept turning round and round ; made the journey like a vision , in which nothing was quite real but his own torment .

She was very pretty : exceedingly pretty .
' Come here , <NAME> , ' said her father , coldly .
But no dog appeared , and at length he resumed his journey .
At this point <NAME> greatly augmented my curiosity by taking the utmost pains to open his mouth very wide , and to put it into the form of a word that looked to me like " sulks.

' Do you remember that I tried to tell you , when I came home , what a debt of gratitude I owed you , dearest <NAME> , and how fervently I felt towards you ? ' ' I remember it , ' she said , gently , ' very well. ' ' You have a secret , ' said I .
' She is quite exhausted , ' said the schoolmaster , glancing upward into his face .
I don ' t know what I thought , or what I dreaded .
His business is the Law ? " I nodded harder .
<NAME> upon your head agin , and I ' ll cut one of your feet off. ' The boy made no answer , but directly <NAME> had shut himself in , stood on his head before the door , then walked on his hands to the back and stood on his head there , and then to the opposite side and repeated the performance .
<NAME> , in the library , has fallen asleep for the good of the country over the report of a <NAME> committee .
He had spoken so sensibly and feelingly of my weakness that I wanted to know something about his strength .
Although I looked about me confusedly and hurriedly as we crossed the street , I thought I knew the place .
The bumpers filled , Mr Blandois , with a roystering gaiety , clinked the top of his glass against the bottom of Mr Flintwinch ' s , and the bottom of his glass against the top of Mr Flintwinch ' s , and drank to the intimate acquaintance he foresaw .
exclaimed the old man in a tone of thoughtful amazement and with a wider stare than before .
' Stupid ! ' said Mrs. Squeers angrily .
<NAME> parent dies. ' Same Buffer , emboldened by success , says : ' When ? ' ' The other day .
And it was made the more difficult by the unconscious <NAME> .
The dread of being hunted in a strange remote place , where the laws might not protect him -- the novelty of the feeling that it was strange and remote , originating in his being left alone so suddenly amid the ruins of his plans -- his greater dread of seeking refuge now , in <NAME> or in <NAME> , where men might be hired to assassinate him , he thought , at any dark street corner -- the waywardness of guilt and fear -- perhaps some sympathy of action with the turning back of all his schemes -- impelled him to turn back too , and go to <NAME> .
That ' s all I know. ' ' Good-night , <NAME> ! ' said <NAME> , sorrowfully .
Here is the door as you see .
<NAME> almost smacks his lips with the unction of a horrible interest .
If I had never come into the property , I shouldn ' t have minded .
I forget how my uncle used to call it . "
<NAME> <NAME> was then examined by <NAME> , who , being a promising young man of two or three-and-forty , was of course anxious to confuse a witness who was notoriously predisposed in favour of the other side , as much as he could .
Therefore I was driven at last to asking <NAME> if he would mind convincing me that it really was all over there , as he had said , and that it was not his mere impression .
With that they parted ; Mr <NAME> to make the best of his way home and sleep himself sober ; and <NAME> to cogitate upon the discovery he had made , and exult in the prospect of the rich field of enjoyment and reprisal it opened to him .
he cried in a shrill tone .
Never were such jolly , roystering , rollicking , merry-making blades , as the jovial crew of <NAME> .
After the morning ' s rehearsal they went to work again , nor did they stop , except for a hasty dinner , until it was time to repair to the theatre at night .
' I began , by means of his assistance , to copy law writings .
' " Wouldn ' t she ? " said the old gentleman firmly .
His face , his voice , his manner , all showed that too plainly .
'To the kind gentleman , and the dear old nurse , who took so much care of me before , ' rejoined <NAME> .
I have seen you , and you have seen him , and I must make that do. ' Saying this , she looked at <NAME> as if to fix his features in her mind , and her eye was not so bright as it had been .
She became utterly and completely miserable .
I wish you good-day , <NAME> , and leave my umble respects for <NAME> Trotwood. ' With those words , he retired , kissing his great hand , and leering at us like a mask .
I shall be within the mark any way .
When I sought them out ( as I did ; there was no tampering with me ) , I told them I wanted help to find you out , to trace you down , to go through with what I had begun , to help the right ; and that when I had done it , I ' d burst into your room and tell you all , face to face , man to man , and like a man .
cried <NAME> , struggling to disengage himself from the girl 's grasp .
' I am very glad to know they do ! ' ' Aye , ' returned the old man , ' but stay .
Being by this time nearly tired of sleeping upon shelves , we had remained awake to go ashore straightway ; and groping a passage across the dark decks of other boats , and among labyrinths of engine-machinery and leaking casks of molasses , we reached the streets , knocked up the porter at the hotel where we had stayed before , and were , to our great joy , safely housed soon afterwards .
cried the lady , ' I have been so dreadfully put out ! '
The fire was in a rusty brazier , not fitted to the hearth ; and a common lamp , shaped like a hyacinth-root , smoked and flared in the neck of a stone bottle on the table .
' <NAME> won ' t be long , ' said <NAME> .
<NAME> , <NAME> , let me know what my crime is , will you ? ' The stricken Grinder wept , and put his coat-cuff in his eye .
' Here ' s a state of things ! ' cried Mr <NAME> , raising his eyes to the ceiling .
<NAME> night. " With those words the passenger opened the coach-door and got in ; not at all assisted by his fellow-passengers , who had expeditiously secreted their watches and purses in their boots , and were now making a general pretence of being asleep .
This was enough to irritate a gentleman with <NAME> ' s sense of propriety , but it was not the whole extent of the aggravation , for a stage-coach full , inside and out , was meeting them at the moment , and the astonishment of the passengers was very palpably evinced .
But the agony of mind , the remorse , and shame I felt when I became conscious next day !
If you was to take to something , sir , ' said Mrs. Crupp , ' if you was to take to skittles , now , which is healthy , you might find it divert your mind , and do you good. ' With these words , Mrs. Crupp , affecting to be very careful of the brandy -- which was all gone -- thanked me with a majestic curtsey , and retired .
You have got good measure , <NAME> What-is-it. ' ' Try Jenny , ' suggested that young lady with great calmness .
His constant height is of a piece with his immense abilities .
I knew that she could not live long ; but the thought that before her death she might give birth to some ill-fated being , destined to hand down madness to its offspring , determined me .
The little people could do nothing without dear <NAME> .
" <NAME> , " said the functionary , " I am going to send you on to <NAME> , under an escort. " " Citizen , I desire nothing more than to get to <NAME> , though I could dispense with the escort. " " Silence ! " growled a red-cap , striking at the coverlet with the butt-end of his musket .
The young lady uttered a cry of surprise , and for a few moments they were so still that the listener could distinctly hear them breathe .
Go along with you ! ' ' If you find people in my service who are not to be controlled , <NAME> , ' said Mr Dombey , turning back towards the fire , ' you know what to do with them , I presume .
' I have n't so much as would -- ' ' I do n't know how much you 've got , and I dare say you hardly know yourself , as it would take a pretty long time to count it , ' said <NAME> ; 'but I must have some to-night ; and that 's flat . '
' Quite right to remind me , <NAME> .
It looks very like rappee , sir. ' Here , a sharp peal at the bell reduced the powdered-headed footman to the ignominious necessity of putting the fox ' s head in his pocket , and hastening with a humble countenance to <NAME> ' s ' study. ' By the bye , who ever knew a man who never read or wrote either , who hadn ' t got some small back parlour which he _would _call a study !
' Here you are again , ' repeated Mr Wegg , musing .
I want my bond , you see .
It was not so easily got ready as some people may imagine .
' But it will be light at five , ' said Mr Inspector , ' and then WE shall be seen. ' ' Look here , ' said <NAME> , ' what do you say to this ?
Will you give me the opportunity of saying a few words to you when you come up stairs ? ' ' Assuredly .
Can I speak to you ? ' Mr <NAME> proposed that <NAME> should drive on to his house , a few hundred yards further .
Let him put away his whim now , and he is welcome back .
And then I thought of <NAME> , and of our parting , and went home very sadly .
Let me wet your lips again .
" There never was , " said my guardian , musing as he smiled upon me , " such a Dame Durden for making money last . "
" I am afraid you are tired .
Since it must be seen , I will have it seen by the light I stood in .
By and by , there were peasants going to their daily labour , or to market , or lounging at the doors of poor cottages , gazing idly at him as he passed .
' Why , ' said <NAME> , ' it ' s as plain as <NAME> .
It was a very muddy boot , and may introduce the odd circumstance connected with <NAME> 's domestic economy , that , whereas he often came home after banking hours with clean boots , he often got up next morning to find the same boots covered with clay .
I thought it a little too much that he should complain of being cut short in his flower after all , as if he had not been running to seed , leaf after leaf , ever since his course began .
" No , I can not spare him !
' I never bet half a dozen ! ' said the other gentleman .
It would be hard , indeed , to part you now .
She had been rung down into the glass room as usual , and had walked about and about it a long time , with the baby in her arms , when , to her great surprise and dismay , Mr Dombey -- whom she had seen at first leaning on his elbow at the table , and afterwards walking up and down the middle room , drawing , each time , a little nearer , she thought , to the open folding doors -- came out , suddenly , and stopped before her .
<NAME> ' t judge him , sir , as you would judge others outside the gates .
He saw that she was desperate , and that her unquenchable hatred of him would stop at nothing .
Another moment , and the close darkness of the shut-up house ( forgotten to be opened , though it was long since day ) yielded to the unexpected glare and freedom of the morning ; and <NAME> , with her head bent down to hide her agony of tears , was in the streets .
I am glad to hear you do .
<NAME> and he were very different now , he said , and very happy .
All that I know about <NAME> , you know. " " And all that I know , " I retorted , " you know. " " I fully believe it .
" Three Rums ! " cried the stranger , calling to the landlord .
' Said the <NAME> was the perfect picture of the old aunt from whom he had expectations .
I suppose it was true .
And you , sweet Kit , honest Kit , virtuous , innocent Kit , look to yourself .
By perpetuating the consequences of his ignorant and blind obstinacy .
<NAME> and I know , solely from being practical , that there are times when that girl ' s whole nature seems to roughen itself against seeing us so bound up in <NAME> .
I like it very much. ' At this , I really thought the waiter must have gone out of his mind : as I believe he would have done , but for the interposition of another man , who whispered in his ear , ' Directly. ' ' Well !
This was not addressed to <NAME> , or to any one whom he could see , but it produced an immediate effect .
In an instant she was gone , and he had shut the door .
' I wish I could hope that it would do your father good , ' said Mrs. Weller .
They took the path indicated by the sexton , and soon arrived before the parsonage wall .
Very near the bottom now .
<NAME> ' s is all you ' ve got to say to <NAME> .
" See how the soot 's falling .
I am sure , at least , I couldn ' t feel like one. ' ' Ay , but that is not enough , and is not what I mean .
I demand to see her .
Here is the boat. ' The boat was filled with the cocked hats to which Mr <NAME> entertained a national objection ; and the wearers of those cocked hats landed and came up the steps , and all the impounded travellers congregated together .
I have had no counsellor , no adviser , no one to protect me .
A hospital for imbeciles ! ' He smoked his cigarette out , with his ugly smile so fixed upon his face that he looked as though he were smoking with his drooping beak of a nose , rather than with his mouth ; like a fancy in a weird picture .
I have not spent any of it .
' To think that I could be offended ! ' ' No , no , I didn ' t really think so , ' returned <NAME> ; ' but I am a little tired , and it made me silly for a moment -- I am always a silly little thing , you know , but it made me more silly -- to talk about <NAME> .
' Only father has brought old <NAME> home , and I want you to come into the drawing-room .
Whatever happens , that must always be a comfort to me ! ' Mrs <NAME> made this impressive observation in the drawing-room , after having descended thither from the inspection of the mantua-makers upstairs , who were busy on the family mourning .
But he is not to be spoken of if you please .
I know it was that night. ' ' Well , if you know it was that night , you know , <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> , ' it ' s no use putting pinchers into a cove to make him say so .
When I awoke next morning , I was resolute to declare my passion to <NAME> , and know my fate .
Drawers , desks , pockets , all things belonging to him , <NAME> examines .
It was at once opened by a woman , who dropped a curtsey of recognition , and <NAME> , whispering the officer to remain below , crept gently upstairs , and , opening the door of the front room , entered at once .
I have sat alone and unnoticed , half an evening , while he conversed with his young cousin , my pupil .
Next evening , down come <NAME> and my Lady with their largest retinue , and down come the cousins and others from all the points of the compass .
He had scarcely turned his head about again , and it was still bent down , listening to the girl , when the stoppage ceased , and the obstructed stream of people flowed on .
I leave them to you , at your desire .
I knew its tender nature very well .
A man of your mark ! ' ' It ' s not so much saying it that I object to , ' returned Mr Venus , ' as doing it .
Our friend <NAME> -- do n't be alarmed ! -- is arrested for debt . "
Between him and me , secret articles were signed of which <NAME> was the subject , and I paid him half of my five hundred pounds down , and engaged for sundry other payments : some , to fall due at certain dates out of my income : some , contingent on my coming into my property .
I am dismissed ! ' She looked as little shocked and as hopeful as she could , but it was distressing news , for many reasons .
A less stanch spirit might have been subdued by such adverse influences ; but the loan for her little outfit was in no part repaid , and it had gone worse with her than she had foreseen , and she was put upon proving her case and maintaining her independence .
The country round <NAME> is surpassingly and exquisitely picturesque .
Well , well , well ! ' He went up to the door , which had a projecting canopy in carved work of festooned jack-towels and children ' s heads with water on the brain , designed after a once-popular monumental pattern , and knocked .
Confess instantly ! ' ' <NAME> , ' said Mr Boffin , one broad piece of sunshine from head to foot , ' I wish you ' d help me out of this. ' ' You can ' t be heard by counsel , sir , ' returned <NAME> .
At all events , I will not answer any more ; I have that in my power. ' She is so conscious of his looking at her with a gloating admiration of the touch of anger on her , and the fire and animation it brings with it , that even as her spirit rises , it falls again , and she struggles with a sense of shame , affront , and fear , much as she did that night at the piano .
So saying , he unlocks his door , gropes his way into his murky rooms , lights his candles , and looks about him .
Even then he staggered round and round , weakly staring about him , until Mr Venus with a hard brush brushed his senses into him and the dust out of him .
" Is he dead ? " I asked , after a silence .
It was a public holiday , and <NAME> did not recover his spirits or his usual temperature of nose until the afternoon .
Nor were there wanting objects in the crowd itself to give new point and purpose to the shifting scene .
None of them have come down in the world as we have .
I said it ( people often do so , in such cases ) like a rather reluctant concession to truth and justice ; -- as if I wanted to deny it !
I 'll tell you something more , wolf .
So in her bosom even now ; the strongest qualities she possessed , long turned upon themselves , became a heap of obduracy , that rose against a friend .
What a famous clock , hereafter , if it said to-night of all the nights that it has counted off , to this old man of all the young and old men who have ever stood before it , " Do n't go home ! "
Never , never , before <NAME> , have I thought of you but as the single , bright , pure , blessed recollection of my boyhood and my youth .
' It ' s quite impossible that they can mind it much. ' ' Ah , that ' s just the wery thing , <NAME> , ' rejoined <NAME> , ' they don ' t mind it ; it ' s a reg ' lar holiday to them -- all porter and skittles .
Therefore Mrs <NAME> asked no questions , and showed no curiosity .
" He is called among the neighbours the <NAME> .
Some had desired to rest beneath the very ground they had trodden in their daily walks ; some , where the setting sun might shine upon their beds ; some , where its light would fall upon them when it rose .
Do you deserve your blessings ?
' <NAME> likely , ' replied <NAME> briefly .
<NAME> , ' said my mother , answering with some difficulty , ' was so considerate and good as to secure the reversion of a part of it to me. ' ' How much ? ' asked <NAME> .
Now , you may go. ' Newman readily availed himself of the permission , and , shutting himself up in his little office , remained there , in very serious cogitation , all day .
' You are to be in all things regulated and governed , ' said the gentleman , ' by fact .
' Is my employer , or master , or whatever the proper name may be , ' replied <NAME> quickly ; ' and I was an ass to take his coarseness ill .
Once in the street , moved by some secret impulse , he laughed , and held his sides , and laughed again , and tried to peer through the dusty area railings as if to catch another glimpse of the child , until he was quite tired out .
But water [ ' specially when ' tis salt ) comes nat ' ral to me ; and friends is dear , and I am heer .
I may be wrong , but I have formed that opinion. ' Both Traddles and I applauded it highly .
Her face was hidden from his view , but <NAME> could see that she was weeping .
<NAME> gives <NAME> to understand , in reply , that her sensitive mind is fully made up never to get the better of it as long as she lives , that her nerves are unstrung for ever , and that she has not the least expectation of ever smiling again .
' Stop a minit , ' said <NAME> , ' you ' re all vite behind. ' ' That ' s right , <NAME> , rub it off , ' said <NAME> , as his son dusted him .
I was articled to <NAME> and <NAME> .
" Do it yourself , " returned the friend rather tartly .
And when <NAME> had observed its position with reference to the other boats , and had made sure that he could not miss it , he turned his eyes upon the building where , as he had been told , the lonely girl with the dark hair sat by the fire .
<NAME> you good-night , Mrs. <NAME> .
' Oh , wouldn ' t he , <NAME> ! ' retorted <NAME> , ' he ' d like it very much , I think when he was asked. ' ' You wouldn ' t ask him , I suppose , at all ? ' said <NAME> .
There were occasions when in looking at him she was involuntarily moved to shake her head , as who would say , ' Alas , poor <NAME> ! ' After allowing herself to be betrayed into these evidences of emotion , she would force a lambent brightness , and would be fitfully cheerful , and would say , ' You have still good spirits , sir , I am thankful to find ; ' and would appear to hail it as a blessed dispensation that <NAME> bore up as he did .
My stall and I are for ever parted .
" Is my benefactor to be made known to me to-day ? " " No .
You will like to make some change , perhaps ?
bless you , sir , ' said <NAME> , with a sort of triumphant shiver , ' she never could have seen him on a Sunday without knowing he was that .
There ain ' t so much in that , you ' ll say .
Little Em ' ly had stopped and looked up at the sky in her enumeration of these articles , as if they were a glorious vision .
A somewhat difficult feat , achieved with great dexterity , and with a prodigious splash .
You know her. ' ' I remember , ' said his companion carelessly .
But , for example , the sprightly little woman was very sure of it , she said .
my dear ! ' said <NAME> ; ' we were at that moment talking about you. ' ' Indeed ! ' replied <NAME> , shrinking , though she scarce knew why , from her uncle ' s cold glistening eye .
" Little woman , " said he , " You have been crying . "
Behave yourself to visitors , my lady !
I was not sure you had a workman of your own here , my dear friend , or we need n't have employed this person . "
But I bethought myself that I was in a boat , after all ; and that a man like <NAME> was not a bad person to have on board if anything did happen .
The trooper then takes from his breast-pocket a folded paper , which he lays with an unwilling hand at the lawyer 's elbow .
This has been a bad business , and may be worse , if we delay a moment .
Can you follow me , <NAME> ?
" And something else supports me , <NAME> . "
" Write exactly as I speak. " " To whom do I address it ? " " To no one. " <NAME> still had his hand in his breast .
But you ' ll never go on with it , ' said number four .
If I should prowl about the streets a long time , do n't be uneasy ; I shall reappear in the morning .
It was the first of their proceedings which had no heartiness .
' There he sits , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , as the invalid , not yet recovered from his surprise , reclined in his chair , looking alternately at him and <NAME> .
At the stairs where we had taken him abroad , and ever since , I had looked warily for any token of our being suspected .
His knowledge is not at fault in the present instance .
I ' m generally to be found here , gentlemen , but if I ' m not here , or over the way , that ' s my address .
' Not at all , ' said <NAME> .
We can do so , undismayed .
He winked -- winked openly and undisguisedly ; winked with his right eye -- upon <NAME> !
Her first proceeding there was to unlock a tall press , bring out several bottles , and pour some of the contents of each into my mouth .
What else have I been doing all to-night. ' ' Attend , I tell you , ' ( in a raised voice ) ' to what I am going to say .
'What if he turns against the others ? '
The sickly rays of the suspended lantern falling directly upon them , aggravated the paleness and anxiety of their countenances : which , encircled by the deepest gloom and darkness , looked ghastly in the extreme .
And then I know what would happen .
In short , the banquet was such a failure that I should have been quite unhappy -- about the failure , I mean , for I was always unhappy about <NAME> -- if I had not been relieved by the great good humour of my company , and by a bright suggestion from <NAME> .
' I wonder whether THEY can hear it , ' said <NAME> .
He had no idea that this could dwell in the thoughts of his fair young wife ; but , when he afterwards joined her in their own rooms , he found her waiting for him with the old pretty lifting of the forehead strongly marked .
Shall I tell you about the second time I saw her ?
We shall soon improve our youthful humours. ' God help me , I might have been improved for my whole life , I might have been made another creature perhaps , for life , by a kind word at that season .
I see her face now , better than I did then , I dare say , with its indelible look of regret and wonder turned upon me .
In a small room in the vicinity of the stableyard , betimes in the morning , which was ushered in by <NAME> ' s adventure with the middle -- aged lady in the yellow curl-papers , sat <NAME> , senior , preparing himself for his journey to <NAME> .
He looked up from his breakfast as <NAME> entered , with a fierce and peremptory air , which was very dignified ; and , having scrutinised that gentleman and his companions to his entire satisfaction , hummed a tune , in a manner which seemed to say that he rather suspected somebody wanted to take advantage of him , but it wouldn ' t do .
' I believe that he loves me , fully as much as I love him. ' ' Oh , what happiness ! ' exclaimed <NAME> .
With no consciousness of having moved , she gained the door .
The friendship between himself and me increased continually , and it was maintained on this odd footing : that , while <NAME> came professedly to look after me as my guardian , he always consulted me in any little matter of doubt that arose , and invariably guided himself by my advice ; not only having a high respect for my native sagacity , but considering that I inherited a good deal from my aunt .
There is no look of decent comfort anywhere .
Mr Wrayburn , I have had a bitter trial to-night , and I hope you will not think me ungrateful , or mysterious , or changeable .
After which , we went shivering , at that uncomfortable hour , to our respective beds , through various close passages ; which smelt as if they had been steeped , for ages , in a solution of soup and stables .
The relations between them did not look wilful , or capricious , or a failure , in such a light ; they became elevated into something more self-denying , honourable , affectionate , and true .
He was a grotesque , fantastic figure , and the few bystanders laughed .
As to our lodging , it 's not by any means splendid , because I have my own bread to earn , and my father has n't anything to give me , and I should n't be willing to take it , if he had .
<NAME> up to your seat directly. ' ' I am wery much afeered , ' muttered <NAME> to himself , as he turned away , ' that somethin ' queer ' s come over the governor , or he ' d never ha ' stood this so quiet .
He saw the devoted little creature with her worn shoes , in her common dress , in her jail-home ; a slender child in body , a strong heroine in soul ; and the light of her domestic story made all else dark to him .
The accused , who was ( and who knew he was ) being mentally hanged , beheaded , and quartered , by everybody there , neither flinched from the situation , nor assumed any theatrical air in it .
We must have that bottle. ' ' Why , you wouldn ' t take it by force ? ' said <NAME> , restraining him .
He rubbed it into my mouth and up my nose and down my throat -- Ow !
There were the hedgerows where the brother and sister had so often gathered wild flowers together , and the green fields and shady paths where they had so often strayed .
Keep your eye upon my Uncle , will you , Mr <NAME> , and make him as comfortable as you can while I am gone ?
I wish to make you happy .
They came out with me directly to look at the boy .
He felt forced , sometimes , to try to stop it -- to stem it with his childish hands -- or choke its way with sand -- and when he saw it coming on , resistless , he cried out !
Why disguise the phrase ? ' ' Ma , ' said <NAME> , with one beat of her foot , ' you are enough to drive a saint mad , and so is Lavvy. ' ' Unfortunate Lavvy ! ' cried <NAME> , in a tone of commiseration .
It was the sole resource ; for he told me that the case must be over in five minutes when the witness was there , and that no power on earth could prevent its going against us .
Most of the theatres keep an author on purpose. ' ' Indeed ! ' cried <NAME> .
' There , my dear ! ' said Mr Boffin when they came in to supper .
Fingers and toes. ' ' He pays well , I hope ? ' said <NAME> .
Her golden hair , which she wore in long curls , had been hurriedly pushed aside , and fell down over her neck .
' Sir. ' ' We ' ll avoid these precious morsels of morality if you please , and talk of business. ' ' With all my heart , sir , ' rejoined <NAME> , ' and first let me say -- ' ' First let ME say , if you please. -- <NAME> ! ' Newman presented himself when the summons had been twice or thrice repeated , and asked if his master called .
' You would like to be a lady ? ' I said .
The <NAME> made a gulp as if to get down something that was sticking in his throat , and nervously proceeded : ' That there unfort ' nate ship met with such foul weather , out at sea , as don ' t blow once in twenty year , my darling .
" <NAME> left us at a week 's notice .
It ' s a dreadful thing to gape , but I must do something .
From the accumulated sadness into which I fell , I had at length no hope of ever issuing again .
' <NAME> , ' returned <NAME> , in her usual strong low voice , ' there is a demon of anger in you .
' I have surely slept very long , ' returned <NAME> .
Interlopers Now do those two gentlemen not very neat about the cuffs and buttons who attended the last coroner 's inquest at the <NAME> 's Arms reappear in the precincts with surprising swiftness ( being , in fact , breathlessly fetched by the active and intelligent beadle ) , and institute perquisitions through the court , and dive into the <NAME> 's parlour , and write with ravenous little pens on tissue-paper .
No substance in it , Lucie. " But the shadow of the manner of these Defarges was dark upon himself , for all that , and in his secret mind it troubled him greatly .
She then walked me on very fast .
The spinster aunt trembled , till some pebbles which had accidentally found their way into the large watering-pot shook like an infant ' s rattle .
A Mr. and Mrs. Gulpidge were of the party , who had something to do at second-hand ( at least , <NAME> had ) with the law business of the <NAME> ; and what with the <NAME> , and what with the <NAME> , we were as exclusive as the <NAME> .
Our old selves would be fit for nothing here but to be robbed and imposed upon .
It was easy for me to find out , and I did soon find out , that <NAME> had begun to follow her closely , and that she allowed him to do it .
You found him secret ? ' returns <NAME> , with a greedy relish .
I thought the simple confidence reposed in us by <NAME> and by himself , was , in itself , affecting .
' You see those two old houses , ' he said at last .
<NAME> of parents , devoid of relations , devoid of flocks and herds , devoid of gold and silver and of precious stones .
Anything. ' ' I don ' t like it , ' pettishly returned <NAME> as before .
But before he had said a dozen words , Mrs. Nickleby , with many sly winks and nods , observed , that she was sure <NAME> must be quite tired out , and that she positively must insist on his not sitting up a minute longer .
Occasionally , the old agony comes back : a very little thing will revive it ; even a familiar sound , or the scent of summer flowers in the air ; but it does not last long , now : for the world without , has come to be the vision , and this solitary life , the sad reality .
I shall go down into <NAME> afterwards. ' ' Shooting , sir ? ' said the coachman .
The wisdom of encouraging a little harmless pride in personal appearance even among the blind , or the whimsical absurdity of considering charity and leather breeches inseparable companions , as we do , requires no comment .
Among the number was one stout , red-faced , elderly man , in particular , seated in an opposite box , who attracted <NAME> ' s attention .
Here was a collector of water-rates , without his book , without his pen and ink , without his double knock , without his intimidation , kissing -- actually kissing -- an agreeable female , and leaving taxes , summonses , notices that he had called , or announcements that he would never call again , for two quarters ' due , wholly out of the question .
As he walked up and down , affably accommodating his step to the shuffle of his brother , not proud in his superiority , but considerate of that poor creature , bearing with him , and breathing toleration of his infirmities in every little puff of smoke that issued from his lips and aspired to get over the spiked wall , he was a sight to wonder at .
But I remarked two things : first , that though <NAME> soon recovered her composure , and was quite herself , there was a blank between her and <NAME> which separated them wholly from each other ; secondly , that <NAME> seemed to dislike the intimacy between her and <NAME> , and to watch it with uneasiness .
But , so much more powerful were the frailties of <NAME> ' s form than the strongest resources of tailoring science , that he now stood before the <NAME> , a perfect Argus in the way of buttons : shining and winking and gleaming and twinkling out of a hundred of those eyes of bright metal , at the dazzled spectators .
<NAME> was the artillery , heavy and light , which Mrs. <NAME> brought into play for the furtherance of these great schemes ; various and opposite the means which she employed to bring about the end she had in view .
' Plenty of everything. ' ' Lor ! ' chuckled <NAME> , giving her knees a hug .
They brought some beer and spirits into the boat with them , and what with drinking freely before , and again now , were soon in a fair way of being quarrelsome and intoxicated .
Do you attach no value to their good opinion ?
' Well , <NAME> , ' said the miller ' s daughter , ' you see I have come to see you , although we HAD some words last night. ' ' I pity your bad passions , ' Tilda , ' replied <NAME> , ' but I bear no malice .
' Won ' t you stop to say something to Mrs. Crummles ? ' asked the manager , following him down to the door .
Upon the way , the guard and I were formally introduced to each other ( as we usually were on such occasions ) , and exchanged a variety of small-talk .
It was a trouble to him to think of this face of <NAME> .
But , now I believe that the mark of the red cross is fatal to them , and that they have no part in His mercies .
I ' ll tell her that you have come home .
' A porochial life is not a bed of roses , Mrs .
' The old man and his grandchild who travelled with you -- where are they ?
' Uncle much hove down , <NAME> ' r ? ' inquired the <NAME> , as they were walking along .
I could take care of his property when you are away -- good care , you see. ' Heaving a long-drawn sigh , <NAME> paused for a response .
' There ' ll shortly be an end of <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , threatening it with the hat-box .
' HE was a long time , ' replied <NAME> .
He has been so careless and said so much that he never meant .
Mr <NAME> was so overjoyed by the success of his present , and was so delighted to see <NAME> bending down over <NAME> , smoothing his coarse back with her little delicate hand -- <NAME> graciously allowing it from the first moment of their acquaintance -- that he felt it difficult to take leave , and would , no doubt , have been a much longer time in making up his mind to do so , if he had not been assisted by <NAME> himself , who suddenly took it into his head to bay Mr Toots , and to make short runs at him with his mouth open .
I almost think he did .
There was an old smoky bust over the mantel-shelf , and a dusty clock above the dock -- the only thing present , that seemed to go on as it ought ; for depravity , or poverty , or an habitual acquaintance with both , had left a taint on all the animate matter , hardly less unpleasant than the thick greasy scum on every inanimate object that frowned upon it .
His altered character had never been so grossly marked .
-- Heerd a noise , ' continued <NAME> .
<NAME> on making one last effort to redeem her character , she breaks from Mr Toots and runs away to find the coach , and show a parting smile .
'Have I the lady 's promise for that ? '
' The talent of the other three is principally in combat and serious pantomime .
In moments of confidence too ?
' I said mine , didn ' t I ? ' returned <NAME> .
They reflect handsome faces , simpering faces , youthful faces , faces of threescore and ten that will not submit to be old ; the entire collection of faces that have come to pass a January week or two at <NAME> , and which the fashionable intelligence , a mighty hunter before the <NAME> , hunts with a keen scent , from their breaking cover at the Court of <NAME> <NAME> 's to their being run down to death .
That you sent messages by , you know !
" Yes , " I said ; " and to be repaid by such gratitude as hers is to be made rich , guardian . "
He appeared to be meditating some Patriarchal way out of his delicate position , when Mr <NAME> , once more suddenly applying the trigger to his hat , shot it off again with his former dexterity .
<NAME> nodded assent , and drained his glass .
The predilections of the inexhaustible baby being provided for , <NAME> could think of nothing else .
I myself always clearly foresaw the consequences , and am not surprised .
Is there summ ' at deadly sticking to my clothes ?
I should have been surprised if those two could have thought very highly of one another , <NAME> attaching so much importance to many things and <NAME> caring so little for anything .
He was far from rich , and every day of indecision and inaction made his inheritance a source of greater anxiety to him .
' I recollect meeting a gentleman at <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' only for a few moments , for I was leaving the company as he joined it , so like you that I felt almost certain it was the same. ' ' I see you now for the first time , ' rejoined <NAME> with all due gallantry .
He had been spurred and whipped and heavily sweated .
He ' s very deaf indeed , ' cried the sexton petulantly ; ' are you sure you ' re right about the figures ? ' ' Oh quite , ' replied the old man .
This important point being despatched , <NAME> refreshed himself with three chops , and liquids both malt and spirituous , at the expense of the estate ; and then they all went away to <NAME> ' Commons .
<NAME> <NAME> returned the glare , concentrated into a focus by means of his spectacles , and breathed a bold defiance .
When I handed her down to the door , there was a child , a pretty boy from two to three years old , in her carriage .
At last , swooping at a street corner by a fountain , one of its wheels came to a sickening little jolt , and there was a loud cry from a number of voices , and the horses reared and plunged .
How dare you venture so to affront me , when you know -- I do not know better , <NAME> : I have seen it in your every glance , and heard it in your every word -- that in place of affection between us there is aversion and contempt , and that I despise him hardly less than I despise myself for being his !
Why , I don ' t believe now , ' added <NAME> , taking off his spectacles , and smiling as with gentle pride , ' that there ' s such a place in all the world for coincidences as <NAME> is ! ' ' I don ' t know about that , ' said <NAME> ; ' but -- ' ' <NAME> ' t know about it , <NAME> ! ' interrupted <NAME> , with an obstinate air .
Would she have him fire off real guns , and have his hair cut , and his whiskers shaved , and his eyes turned right and left , and his trousers pipeclayed ? ' ' <NAME> , ' whispered <NAME> , ' you don ' t know who that is .
' <NAME> is blameless , ' she went on , ' of having ever urged you for herself , and she is blameless in intention every way , I am sure , -- but when I saw how many importunate claims were pressed upon you in my name ; how you were traded on in my name ; how generous you were , and how <NAME> , who had your welfare very much at heart , resented it ; the first sense of my exposure to the mean suspicion that my tenderness was bought -- and sold to you , of all men on earth -- fell upon me like unmerited disgrace , in which I forced you to participate .
I made , and have kept , that plot of ground entirely with my own hands .
'Dodger , take off the sausages ; and draw a tub near the fire for <NAME> .
" 'You had better see , ' he carelessly answered ; and took up a light .
Wherefore <NAME> ( who was a thoroughly good-natured man , and as active a creature about everything but his own affairs as ever existed , and never so happy as when he was busy about something that could never be of any profit to him ) set to work at the petition , invented it , engrossed it on an immense sheet of paper , spread it out on a table , and appointed a time for all the club , and all within the walls if they chose , to come up to his room and sign it .
You only knew the town was there , because you knew there could have been no such sulky blotch upon the prospect without a town .
The rest of the half-year is a jumble in my recollection of the daily strife and struggle of our lives ; of the waning summer and the changing season ; of the frosty mornings when we were rung out of bed , and the cold , cold smell of the dark nights when we were rung into bed again ; of the evening schoolroom dimly lighted and indifferently warmed , and the morning schoolroom which was nothing but a great shivering-machine ; of the alternation of boiled beef with roast beef , and boiled mutton with roast mutton ; of clods of bread-and-butter , dog ' s-eared lesson-books , cracked slates , tear-blotted copy-books , canings , rulerings , hair-cuttings , rainy <NAME> , suet-puddings , and a dirty atmosphere of ink , surrounding all .
Then would Mr Perch descant upon the hours of acute uneasiness he and <NAME> had suffered out at <NAME> , when they first suspected ' things was going wrong. ' Then would Mr Perch relate to gaping listeners , in a low voice , as if the corpse of the deceased <NAME> were lying unburied in the next room , how <NAME> had first come to surmise that things was going wrong by hearing him ( Perch ) moaning in his sleep , ' twelve and ninepence in the pound , twelve and ninepence in the pound ! ' <NAME> act of somnambulism he supposed to have originated in the impression made upon him by the change in Mr <NAME> ' s face .
But I was too imbecile , although I knew it to be he , to separate him from his dress ; and tried to call him , I remember , <NAME> .
I thought you ' d allow me to pay my compliments to you .
As <NAME> gazed sternly upon him , it rolled down his cheek .
It appeared to me that he must be a very happy man indeed , to have so many little drawers in his shop ; and I wondered when I peeped into one or two on the lower tiers , and saw the tied-up brown paper packets inside , whether the flower-seeds and bulbs ever wanted of a fine day to break out of those jails , and bloom .
When we had examined these lessons , four morsels of girls ( of whom one was blind ) sang a little song , about the merry month of May , which I thought ( being extremely dismal ) would have suited an English November better .
It was very solitary and very dull , and I did not doubt that I might safely steal upstairs .
Good-night , dear , good-night , good-night. ' His quick transition to a state of unbounded pleasure , as he stood at his window , kissing and clapping his hands : and the way in which the light retreated from his features as she passed out of his view , and left a patient melancholy on the little face : were too remarkable wholly to escape even <NAME> ' s notice .
' It was well that I should be pitied and forgiven by you , or anyone of your name , in the first hour of my return !
" Then , " pursued <NAME> , " it 's monotonous , and to-day is too like yesterday , and to-morrow is too like to-day . "
You know I do , and I wonder you don ' t colour up like fire .
<NAME> sang with great sweetness and expression , and so did Mrs. Strong .
Upwards of an hour elapsed before my guardian put his head into the room where <NAME> and I were sitting and said , " Come in , my dears ! "
" You cold , cold heart ! " " What ? " said <NAME> , preserving her attitude of indifference as she leaned against the great chimney-piece and only moving her eyes ; " do you reproach me for being cold ?
If my friend Dombey suffers from bodily weakness , and would allow me to recommend what has frequently done myself good , as a man who has been extremely queer at times , and who lived pretty freely in the days when men lived very freely , I should say , let it be in point of fact the yolk of an egg , beat up with sugar and nutmeg , in a glass of sherry , and taken in the morning with a slice of dry toast .
So rife and potent was the fever in Bleeding Heart Yard , that Mr <NAME> ' s rent-days caused no interval in the patients .
This was a good freshener to my presence of mind , as a beginning .
Was he here this morning ? ' ' <NAME> , ' bawled <NAME> , in a very loud key .
And yet a married woman , possessing your attractions , shuts her eyes ( and sparklers too ) , and goes and runs her delicate-formed head against a wall .
The certificates were regularly signed as extracts from the parish books , the first letter had a genuine appearance of having been written and preserved for some years , the handwriting of the second tallied with it exactly , ( making proper allowance for its having been written by a person in extremity , ) and there were several other corroboratory scraps of entries and memoranda which it was equally difficult to question .
Apropos of producing , let somebody produce that at its address , and produce the answer here. ' ' Cavalletto , ' said <NAME> .
This is not the place for <NAME> of any kind .
From that time , whenever he thought of <NAME> ' s , it came back as he had seen it in this last view ; and it never seemed to be a real place again , but always a dream , full of eyes .

It happened , that , as she was reading in the old spot by herself one day , this child came running in with his eyes full of tears , and after holding her from him , and looking at her eagerly for a moment , clasped his little arms passionately about her neck .
Anyhow , he named to me that the house had a board up , " This Eminently Aristocratic Mansion to be let or sold. " Me and <NAME> went to look at it , and finding it beyond a doubt <NAME> ( though a trifle high and dull , which after all may be part of the same thing ) took it .
The large rooms are too cramped and close .
There must always be two parties to a quarrel , says the old adage .
And if it was dark and rather dull , we used to say , what did it matter to us , for it only made us remember our last walk with greater pleasure , and look forward to our next one .
I beg your pardon ; will you allow me to look at that card again ? ' ' Oh !
I ' ll hold you living , and I ' ll hold you dead .
Mrs. <NAME> overheard him and smiled .
' Fine pursuit , sir -- fine pursuit. -- <NAME> , <NAME> ? ' ' Not just now , ' said <NAME> .
<NAME> has been recognised by <NAME> as the affectionate brother you have heard of , " said <NAME> , " and has acknowledged the relationship .
said the Jew , bending his head forward , with his eyes almost starting out of it .
' I doubt it , my dear young lady , ' said the doctor , shaking his head .
My denying myself the pleasure of the present agreeable conversation may not be wholly irrespective of your own interests , <NAME> " <NAME> expressed himself quite sure of that and lighted <NAME> out .

Self-elected saints with gloomy brows , this sightless , earless , voiceless child may teach you lessons you will do well to follow .
The baskets contained roast fowls , buffalo ' s tongue ( an exquisite dainty , by the way ) , ham , bread , cheese , and butter ; biscuits , champagne , sherry ; lemons and sugar for punch ; and abundance of rough ice .
Then , <NAME> being gone and we two left alone , she turned to me , and said in a whisper , -- " Is she beautiful , graceful , well-grown ?
I never heard these two points so wisely touched ( if indeed I have ever heard them touched at all ) , by any preacher of that kind before .
Here it is , you see , sir !
I owe it all to him , my love , my pride !
' Eh , <NAME> ? ' ' Yes , indeed , ' said I .
Her tears burst forth afresh at the sight ; she was ashamed and afraid of it ; but it moved her to no anger against him .
<NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> -- all founders of clubs. ' ' I know that , ' said <NAME> ; ' but as I can not put myself in competition with those great men , I can not presume to wear their dresses. ' The grave man considered deeply , for a few seconds , and then said -- ' On reflection , <NAME> , I don ' t know whether it would not afford Mrs. Leo Hunter greater pleasure , if her guests saw a gentleman of your celebrity in his own costume , rather than in an assumed one .
All is now over , ma ' am , and well over. ' During the five minutes or so that <NAME> devoted to the delivery of this oration , my aunt eyed him narrowly .

The bank closed , the ancient clerks came out , the usual watch was set , and <NAME> and his son went home to tea .
He was about retracing his steps , when he was suddenly transfixed to the spot by a sudden appearance ; and the mode and manner of this appearance , we now proceed to relate .
He might have been at bottom , but he certainly was not at top , seeing that his coat was of the roughest and most ill-favoured kind .
And when , at the fortnight 's end , he comes to join you and your beloved husband , on your other fortnight 's trip in <NAME> , you shall say that we have sent him to you in the best health and in the happiest frame .
I went into a coffee-house to write a little note to <NAME> , telling her he had gone off , sending his love to her over and over again , and then went to my lonely home , -- if it deserved the name ; for it was now no home to me , and I had no home anywhere .
The stock-in-trade of this old gentleman comprised chronometers , barometers , telescopes , compasses , charts , maps , sextants , quadrants , and specimens of every kind of instrument used in the working of a ship ' s course , or the keeping of a ship ' s reckoning , or the prosecuting of a ship ' s discoveries .
Her words and manner had touched <NAME> 's heart ; and , mingled with her love for her young charge , and scarcely less intense in its truth and fervour , was her fond wish to win the outcast back to repentance and hope .
Will you read to me a little more ? ' <NAME> was withdrawing her hand to open the book , when <NAME> detained it for a moment .
' <NAME> wrote , the day before yesterday , to say she had made a stolen match without her husband ' s father ' s consent , and so you had gone down to get it when his refusing it couldn ' t prevent the match , and all the rest of it .

Mr <NAME> and the dog were established frequenters of the cottage , and the day was fixed for the wedding .
Ask the first hundred citizens of <NAME> , met at random in the streets at noon , if they believed in <NAME> , they would tell you no ; but put them to choose at night between these eerie Precincts and the thoroughfare of shops , and you would find that ninety-nine declared for the longer round and the more frequented way .
' Trust your old master not to be fooled by pretty faces , <NAME> ; no , no , no -- nor by ugly ones neither , <NAME> , ' he softly added by way of soliloquy .
<NAME> rotten houses , many to let , many yet building , many half-built and mouldering away -- lodgings , where it would be hard to tell which needed pity most , those who let or those who came to take -- children , scantily fed and clothed , spread over every street , and sprawling in the dust -- scolding mothers , stamping their slipshod feet with noisy threats upon the pavement -- shabby fathers , hurrying with dispirited looks to the occupation which brought them ' daily bread ' and little more -- mangling-women , washer-women , cobblers , tailors , chandlers , driving their trades in parlours and kitchens and back room and garrets , and sometimes all of them under the same roof -- brick-fields skirting gardens paled with staves of old casks , or timber pillaged from houses burnt down , and blackened and blistered by the flames -- mounds of dock-weed , nettles , coarse grass and oyster-shells , heaped in rank confusion -- small dissenting chapels to teach , with no lack of illustration , the miseries of <NAME> , and plenty of new churches , erected with a little superfluous wealth , to show the way to <NAME> .
And yet he did care something for the streets that environed that house , and for the senseless stones that made their pavements .

A series of entertainments in celebration of the late nuptials , and in cultivation of society , were arranged , chiefly by Mr Dombey and <NAME> ; and it was settled that the festive proceedings should commence by <NAME> ' s being at home upon a certain evening , and by Mr and <NAME> ' s requesting the honour of the company of a great many incongruous people to dinner on the same day .
Waiting for some reply , I looked about me , noticing how the sluice was abandoned and broken , and how the house -- of wood with a tiled roof -- would not be proof against the weather much longer , if it were so even now , and how the mud and ooze were coated with lime , and how the choking vapor of the kiln crept in a ghostly way towards me .
<NAME> Leicester is majestically wroth .
Much that I have seen , but not noted , has come back upon me with new meaning , during this last trying hour .

He has bought two specimens of poultry , which , if there be any truth in adages , were certainly not caught with chaff , to be prepared for the spit ; he has amazed and rejoiced the family by their unlooked-for production ; he is himself directing the roasting of the poultry ; and Mrs. Bagnet , with her wholesome brown fingers itching to prevent what she sees going wrong , sits in her gown of ceremony , an honoured guest .
Take your oath of that. ' And reference being made to Mr Perch , he confirms her view of the case .

Walks by night , does she ?
I am very susceptible to such horrid things .
Be careful , sir , to what lengths your jealousy carries you another time ; and be careful , also , before you venture too far , to ascertain your rival ' s temper.

When he turned , he had his handkerchief in his hand , and he had been wiping his eyes with it , and he looked tired and ill.

A girl can get on anywhere .
' Will you allow me to ask you , sir , ' he said , addressing <NAME> , who was considerably mystified by this very unpolite by-play -- ' will you allow me to ask you , <NAME> , whether that person belongs to your party ? ' ' No , <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> , ' he is a guest of ours. ' ' He is a member of your club , or I am mistaken ? ' said the lieutenant inquiringly .

He wore thick shoes , and thick leather gaiters , and thick gloves like a hedger ' s .
" My service to him , too !
' <NAME> and <NAME> , ' growled the bass .
Some people laughed to see the alteration in him , but he let them laugh , and little heeded them ; for he was wise enough to know that nothing ever happened on this globe , for good , at which some people did not have their fill of laughter in the outset ; and knowing that such as these would be blind anyway , he thought it quite as well that they should wrinkle up their eyes in grins , as have the malady in less attractive forms .

<NAME> <NAME> is behind his counter in his grey coat and sleeves , inspecting an indenture of several skins which has just come in from the engrosser 's , an immense desert of law-hand and parchment , with here and there a resting-place of a few large letters to break the awful monotony and save the traveller from despair .

All his pains were taken , to the end that he might incense himself with the sight of the detested figure in her company and favour , in her place of concealment .
Go out and ask who is never trifled with , and who is always treated with some delicacy .

While he was plunged in very profound and serious meditation upon this theme , <NAME> sat shaking her head with an air of great mystery and doubt ; when the voice of her brother <NAME> , carolling a cheerful strain , was heard in the passage , and that gentleman himself , beaming with virtuous smiles , appeared .

He could have wished to have spared that company the painful and disgusting detail on which he was about to enter , but as the explanation had been demanded of him , he had no alternative but to state , boldly and distinctly , that he had been required to eat cold meat .
' that ' s wery self-denyin ' o ' you. ' ' Wery , ' replied his parent , with a sigh .
His patron took that opportunity of turning the key in the door , and then sat down upon his bed .
Why , <NAME> love my heart alive , if it ain ' t a treat to look at him ! ' ' He is very handsome , is he not ? ' said I , my heart warming with this praise .
' I wish the boat of my honourable and gallant friend , ' he murmured , lying down again and speaking into his hat , ' may be endowed with philanthropy enough to turn bottom-upward and extinguish him ! -- Mortimer. ' ' My honourable friend. ' ' Three burglaries , two forgeries , and a midnight assassination. ' Yet in spite of having those weights on his conscience , <NAME> was somewhat enlivened by the late slight change in the circumstances of affairs .
' Nothing is going to be done .
Traversing the hollow by the <NAME> of <NAME> , he mounted the opposite bank , and crossing the road which joins the villages of <NAME> and <NAME> , made along the remaining portion of the heath to the fields at <NAME> , in one of which he laid himself down under a hedge , and slept .
" 'Not dead , ' said I ; 'but like to die . '
The scanty parish dress , the livery of his misery , hung loosely on his feeble body ; and his young limbs had wasted away , like those of an old man .
' They have never understood you , <NAME> , ' said his wife .
He ' s too proud a chap to eat it ! ' and , coming out of her chair , shook her venerable fist so very close to his nose as to tickle the surface .
Who told a stranger we could be seen ?
Afterwards , I sometimes observed her rise , with her eyes full of tears , and go out of the room .
She looked very young indeed to be the mother of two children , and I could not help pitying both her and them .

The body was in _its_ place , and its eyes were as he saw them when he stole away .
' You see , ' said Mr Toots , ' what I wanted in a wife was -- in short , was sense .
And , what is very strange , I found him -- " " Not to be any out-of-the-way person , I am afraid ! "
It appears to me , Mr <NAME> , that you yourself are too often and too much in that direction , that direction .
If he stopped it did the same .

" I accept it with many thanks , " returned the trooper .
At another time you ' re all for work .
And here let it be noticed , parenthetically , that the leg of this young man , in its application to the door , evinced the finest sense of touch : always preceding himself and tray ( with something of an angling air about it ) , by some seconds : and always lingering after he and the tray had disappeared , like <NAME> ' s leg when accompanying him off the stage with reluctance to the assassination of <NAME> .
Before retiring , <NAME> , ' proclaimed the <NAME> to <NAME> , loftily cancelling <NAME> , ' I should wish it to be understood between yourself and me that my transactions in future is with you alone .

<NAME> ha ! ' The prospect of playing the spy under such delicious circumstances , and of disappointing them all by walking in alive , gave more delight to <NAME> than the greatest stroke of good fortune could possibly have inspired him with .

There , were the people who were always going out to-morrow , and always putting it off ; there , were the people who had come in yesterday , and who were much more jealous and resentful of this freak of fortune than the seasoned birds .

And certainly , when one comes to think of it , it WAS very odd that anything should have disturbed a companion .
<NAME> gave me some more gravy .
Look what a poor , mean , miserable thing it is !
That honest tradesman 's manner of receiving the look , did not inspire confidence ; he changed the leg on which he rested , as often as if he had fifty of those limbs , and were trying them all ; he examined his finger-nails with a very questionable closeness of attention ; and whenever <NAME> 's eye caught his , he was taken with that peculiar kind of short cough requiring the hollow of a hand before it , which is seldom , if ever , known to be an infirmity attendant on perfect openness of character .
" Did you hear that he was dead , <NAME> ? " I presently asked , with increasing diffidence .
" Yes , yes , you are tired , " said he .
" No , " said a great fat man with a monstrous chin , " I do n't know much about it , either way .

Oh , I understand now. ' ' You see I have married the mother , ' pursued <NAME> ; ' it ' s expensive keeping boys at home , and as she has a little money in her own right , I am afraid ( women are so very foolish , <NAME> ) that she might be led to squander it on them , which would be their ruin , you know. ' ' I see , ' returned <NAME> , throwing himself back in his chair , and waving his hand .
' " Well , " said my uncle , as he looked about him , " a mail travelling at the rate of six miles and a half an hour , and stopping for an indefinite time at such a hole as this , is rather an irregular sort of proceeding , I fancy .
" My child , what questions are these !
She turned , and looked back .
Here , Bull's-eye , mind him , boy !
' But not being a regular musical professional , I should be loath to engage myself for that ; and therefore when I dropped into poetry , I should ask to be considered so fur , in the light of a friend.

Mists hide in the avenues , veil the points of view , and move in funeral-wise across the rising grounds .
<NAME> , I see her dark eyes roll round the church when she says ' miserable sinners ' , as if she were calling all the congregation names .

<NAME> Leicester is content enough that the ironmaster should feel that there is no hurry there ; there , in that ancient house , rooted in that quiet park , where the ivy and the moss have had time to mature , and the gnarled and warted elms and the umbrageous oaks stand deep in the fern and leaves of a hundred years ; and where the sun-dial on the terrace has dumbly recorded for centuries that time which was as much the property of every Dedlock -- while he lasted -- as the house and lands .

I have withdrawn by myself , many times today , to weep .
' You don ' t remember me , I am afraid , ' said I .
It was <NAME> who was arrived , and a gloomy-looking lady she was ; dark , like her brother , whom she greatly resembled in face and voice ; and with very heavy eyebrows , nearly meeting over her large nose , as if , being disabled by the wrongs of her sex from wearing whiskers , she had carried them to that account .
He was standing with his arms folded , over against the wall , looking at the spikes on the top , with a sentimental expression , as if they were the interlacing boughs of trees that had shaded him in his youth .

( I beg to observe that I think of myself with amazement , when I recall the lies I told on this occasion . )

Well , sir , ' observed <NAME> , after clutching at his dusty hair , to brighten his ideas , ' let us put it another way .
But I have not the power , <NAME> .
' Present circumstances is not what your friends would wish for you , <NAME> , but it isn ' t money makes the man : it ' s -- I am really unequal with my umble powers to express what it is , ' said <NAME> , with a fawning jerk , ' but it isn ' t money !

As he was sauntering away his spare time , and stopped to look at almost every object that met his gaze , it is by no means surprising that <NAME> should have paused before a small stationer ' s and print- seller ' s window ; but without further explanation it does appear surprising that his eyes should have no sooner rested on certain pictures which were exposed for sale therein , than he gave a sudden start , smote his right leg with great vehemence , and exclaimed , with energy , ' if it hadn ' t been for this , I should ha ' forgot all about it , till it was too late ! ' The particular picture on which <NAME> ' s eyes were fixed , as he said this , was a highly-coloured representation of a couple of human hearts skewered together with an arrow , cooking before a cheerful fire , while a male and female cannibal in modern attire , the gentleman being clad in a blue coat and white trousers , and the lady in a deep red pelisse with a parasol of the same , were approaching the meal with hungry eyes , up a serpentine gravel path leading thereunto .

' Halloa ! ' said <NAME> , falling back , with a wink .
What does this mean ? ' ' In the name of <NAME> , say what it means , <NAME> ! ' urged <NAME> .
We turned to the right as I have turned , but I can recall no more .
It was nearly dinner-time next day when we appeared before my aunt .
I was undressing in my own room , when <NAME> ' s letter tumbled on the floor .
And now there was a shore before him .
I durstn ' t do it , ' rejoined the small servant ; ' <NAME> ' ud kill me , if she know ' d I come up here. ' ' Have you got a fire down-stairs ? ' said <NAME> .
I had just come in one night from my dear girl 's and was sitting in the midst of all my new clothes , looking at them all around me and thinking , when a letter from my guardian was brought to me .

' <NAME> was by no means of an irritable or envious disposition , but somehow or other the tall man with the brown coat and the bright basket buttons did rouse what little gall he had in his composition , and did make him feel extremely indignant , the more especially as he could now and then observe , from his seat before the glass , certain little affectionate familiarities passing between the tall man and the widow , which sufficiently denoted that the tall man was as high in favour as he was in size .

At last he had declared that he would become a Painter ; partly because he had always had an idle knack that way , and partly to grieve the souls of the Barnacles-in-chief who had not provided for him .

Get along with you , ' and shut it on him .
" Now , what does our young friend say ? "

It would be worth a journey ( not to mention the pleasure of a journey with you , <NAME> ) , to see that sort of people together , and to make one of ' em. ' My heart leaped with a new hope of pleasure .
<NAME> Heaven ! " " Softly , " said <NAME> .
" Now , you see , " <NAME> proceeds approvingly , " you 're comfortable and conducting yourself as I should expect a foreign young woman of your sense to do .

In my forlorn state I became quite attached to the family , and used to walk about , busy with Mrs. Micawber ' s calculations of ways and means , and heavy with the weight of <NAME> ' s debts .

' ' A sulky state of feeling , ' said <NAME> , after a terrible pause , during which he had moistened the palm of his right hand again , ' won ' t do .

' The young lady , who had been coyly affecting not to know that a gentleman was so near , turned round as <NAME> spoke -- no doubt ( indeed she said so , afterwards ) to decline this offer from a perfect stranger -- when instead of speaking , she started back , and uttered a half-suppressed scream .
Accordingly he set it open , and stood upon the threshold , keeping a bright look-out , and sweeping the whole street with his spectacles .

In her two long narrow windows , the fire shone sullenly all day , and sullenly all night .

Then , to match this young lady , was a young man , who had known <NAME> when he was a bachelor , and was much esteemed by the ladies , as bearing the reputation of a rake .
<NAME> <NAME> ' s sister lamented ; the housekeeper condoled ; and both kept thrusting their heads out of the second-floor window to see if the boy was ' coming ' -- which would have been highly satisfactory , and , upon the whole , tantamount to his being come , as the distance to the corner was not quite five yards -- when , all of a sudden , and when he was least expected , the messenger , carrying the bandbox with elaborate caution , appeared in an exactly opposite direction , puffing and panting for breath , and flushed with recent exercise ; as well he might be ; for he had taken the air , in the first instance , behind a hackney coach that went to <NAME> , and had followed two Punches afterwards and had seen the <NAME> home to their own door .

_I_ turn out nothing else , and I make you a present of the confession. ' To make a vaunt of being poor was another of the incidents of his splenetic state , though this may have had the design in it of showing that he ought to be rich ; just as he would publicly laud and decry the <NAME> , lest it should be forgotten that he belonged to the family .
<NAME> <NAME> took that opportunity of holding a little conversation in a low voice with me .
A pencil-writing , on a crushed and torn piece of paper , blotted with wet .
' Leave him to me. ' ' Where is he ?
Now , your ladyship , a queer thing happened after that man 's death .
I wished to be generous to him , even in the secret depths of my heart , which he would never know , because I could have loved him -- could have been devoted to him .
So ended our conference , which I was very glad to bring to a close .
I examine it , very closely .

During this melancholy pause , the turnkey read his newspaper with a waggish look ( he had evidently got among the facetious paragraphs ) until , happening to take his eyes off for an instant , as if to get by dint of contemplation at the very marrow of some joke of a deeper sort than the rest , it appeared to occur to him , for the first time , that somebody was crying .
I ought to have left <NAME> at home , instead , and then my mind might perhaps have been at ease .

Then , on the motion -- made in dumb show -- of <NAME> , they went upstairs ; the family practitioner opening the room door for that distinguished professional , and following him out , with most obsequious politeness .
What ' s this ? ' and bent his eyes upon me , as if he would have burnt me up with them .
He had made a desperate attempt , one night , and had sat up all night for the purpose , to write an acrostic on <NAME> , which affected him to tears in the conception .
One called to mind how he had seen her sitting on that very spot , and how her book had fallen on her lap , and she was gazing with a pensive face upon the sky .

A reconciliation is established on this propitious occasion between the acknowledged wit of the <NAME> and an aspiring rival , with whom he has been at deadly feud for months ; and a little dinner being proposed , in commemoration of their happily restored amity , takes place at a neighbouring tavern ; the wit in the chair ; the rival acting as Vice-President .

' It ' s rather sudden , ' said <NAME> shaking his head with a look of infinite wisdom , and running on ( as he was accustomed to do ) with scraps of verse as if they were only prose in a hurry ; ' when the heart of a man is depressed with fears , the mist is dispelled when <NAME> appears ; she ' s a very nice girl .
or is there one in both directions ?
" Aye , but they might teach me wrong ! "
And in that short time !
If you must proceed upon your journey , I wish you well through it , and will walk a little way with you before school begins. ' ' What are we to do , <NAME> ?

She continued to look at him ; and if , when he entered the house , he had had any latent hope of prevailing in the least with her , she now looked it out of his heart .
When he had gone on thus for some time , he took her hand in his as he was accustomed to do , with nothing of the violence or animation of his late manner ; and so , by degrees so fine that the child could not trace them , he settled down into his usual quiet way , and suffered her to lead him where she would .

I was standing on the wharf at this place , watching the passengers embarking in a steamboat which preceded that whose coming we awaited , and participating in the anxiety with which a sergeant ' s wife was collecting her few goods together—keeping one distracted eye hard upon the porters , who were hurrying them on board , and the other on a hoopless washing-tub for which , as being the most utterly worthless of all her movables , she seemed to entertain particular affection—when three or four soldiers with a recruit came up and went on board .

When any man , of any grade of desert in intellect or character , can climb to any public distinction , no matter what , in <NAME> , without first grovelling down upon the earth , and bending the knee before this monster of depravity ; when any private excellence is safe from its attacks ; when any social confidence is left unbroken by it , or any tie of social decency and honour is held in the least regard ; when any man in that free country has freedom of opinion , and presumes to think for himself , and speak for himself , without humble reference to a censorship which , for its rampant ignorance and base dishonesty , he utterly loathes and despises in his heart ; when those who most acutely feel its infamy and the reproach it casts upon the nation , and who most denounce it to each other , dare to set their heels upon , and crush it openly , in the sight of all men : then , I will believe that its influence is lessening , and men are returning to their manly senses .
All the family ! " <NAME> shuddered as he threw two more billets into his basket , but it was impossible to be there while the wood-sawyer was at work , and not be in his sight .
" I hear the rain-drip on the stones , " replies the young man , " and I hear a curious echo -- I suppose an echo -- which is very like a halting step . "
I have engaged , on <NAME> ' s representation , a housekeeper -- a very old one -- and such other servants as she thinks I shall require .
I ' m not a man ! " ' " What are you then ? " asked the baron .
" And yet when he went from here ( I may say with my blessing ) , and I spread afore him my humble store , like the <NAME> , he was as plump as a Peach ! " This reminded me of the wonderful difference between the servile manner in which he had offered his hand in my new prosperity , saying , " May I ? " and the ostentatious clemency with which he had just now exhibited the same fat five fingers .
Take it. ' With a disdainful scowl at the object of his anger , who met his eye but uttered not a word , <NAME> walked away at his usual pace , without manifesting the slightest curiosity to see what became of his late companion , or indeed once looking behind him .
" What did they call the wretched being ? "
' He has done a great deal for me .
Taking the brewery on my way back , I raised the rusty latch of a little door at the garden end of it , and walked through .
A moment before , the boy ' s eyes were sparkling with unwonted fire , and every feature had been lighted up with an excitement which made him appear , for the moment , quite a different being .
' He has some objection , my dear , ' replied <NAME> , looking at <NAME> .
' <NAME> , ' says <NAME> , ' but the principle is the same. ' Boots is clear that the principle is the same .
Am I to kiss you now ?
<NAME> , on three or four days that I can at once recall , we went our several ways after an early breakfast , and met again at a late dinner .
It ' s well for you to have had so light a part in this business , when mine has been so heavy .
Go to your room , <NAME> , and make yourself look comfortable and pleasant to receive Mr Clennam. ' ' I would rather stay in my own room , <NAME> , ' returned <NAME> , finding it more difficult than before to regain her composure .
That shall be opened when <NAME> comes home again. ' ' <NAME> said ! ' cried the <NAME> .
How have you been since ? ' It was by no means apparent that <NAME> knew what he said , though it was very apparent that he meant to say something highly friendly and appreciative .
<NAME> was rich ; had married a florid widow with property and three boys , who had nothing particularly shining about them but the straight hair of their dumpling heads .
' Then , ' said the old man , clenching his hands desperately , and looking upwards , ' the child and I are lost ! ' ' Neighbour , ' said <NAME> glancing sternly at him , and beating his hand twice or thrice upon the table to attract his wandering attention , ' let me be plain with you , and play a fairer game than when you held all the cards , and I saw but the backs and nothing more .
Anyone who is the parent of a son is interesting to me. ' ' Has Mrs Blimber any wish to see any remarkable person ? ' asked <NAME> , courteously .
Something to drink ? ' asked <NAME> .
Six days , seven days , far on into another week .
It is twenty-five minutes after its time this afternoon .
' I am reading for the bar .
' In what is that man assisting him , who never looks at me without an inscrutable falsehood in his eyes ?
' A baffler , <NAME> , a baffler , that ' s all , ' returned <NAME> .
' <NAME> is a very good sort of person , I believe , ' replied Mr Dombey .
' I tell ' ee I ha ' gotten scent o ' thot already .
' It is indifferent to me what he says or does. ' ' Nay , <NAME> , ' quoth Mrs <NAME> , ' this touches the blood of the family .
<NAME> ' t let me interrupt you , sir. ' ' Then , you see , my good fellow , ' said the single gentleman , ' that while we have no doubt whatever of the truth of this disclosure , which has so providentially come to light -- ' ' Meaning hers ? ' said <NAME> , pointing towards the <NAME> .
The most comfortable of all the hotels of which I had any experience in the <NAME> , and they were not a few , is <NAME> ' s , in that city : where the <NAME> traveller will find curtains to his bed , for the first and probably the last time in <NAME> ( this is a disinterested remark , for I never use them ) ; and where he will be likely to have enough water for washing himself , which is not at all a common case .
' Still , I am quite open to discussion. ' ' But , my dear Ma , I can not see how we are to discuss , if you take that line. ' ' Blame <NAME> for it , <NAME> , and not me , ' said the old lady , with stately severity .
<NAME> had come out at the gate with us , nobody went in at the gate with me .
' Do you mean that I have not represented the case correctly ? ' ' Al-tro ! ' returned <NAME> .
Looking towards the setting sun , there lay , stretched out before my view , a vast expanse of level ground ; unbroken , save by one thin line of trees , which scarcely amounted to a scratch upon the great blank ; until it met the glowing sky , wherein it seemed to dip : mingling with its rich colours , and mellowing in its distant blue .
Mrs. Badger considers it too yellow .
' I can tell you of what you have lost by my act , what I only can restore , and what , if I die without restoring , dies with me , and never can be regained. ' ' I tell my money pretty accurately , and generally keep it in my own custody , ' said <NAME> .
' " Know you not , O stranger , " was the reply , " of the recent proclamation of our gracious king ? " ' " Proclamation !
Which of the two goes first ?
<NAME> Mr <NAME> pleased to see this ?
How green the banks were now , how bright the flowers growing on them , and how tall the rushes !
" I take it , sir , " says <NAME> , " that you know <NAME> pretty well ? "
I am bound to confess that I cried ; but I hope it was with pleasure , though I am not quite sure it was with pleasure .
Say the next day , and pass as much of tomorrow as you can with us !
<NAME> , close , irresponsive to any glancing light , his dress is like himself .
In one or two instances there was a difficulty respecting the raising of fees , and then <NAME> , backing as far as possible from the insufficient money produced , said , " it 's no use , my boy .
The girl 's life had been squandered in the streets , and among the most noisome of the stews and dens of <NAME> , but there was something of the woman 's original nature left in her still ; and when she heard a light step approaching the door opposite to that by which she had entered , and thought of the wide contrast which the small room would in another moment contain , she felt burdened with the sense of her own deep shame , and shrunk as though she could scarcely bear the presence of her with whom she had sought this interview .
It ' s a capital house for study .
Ah dear me , dear me ! ' So tender were his lamentations , that the kindly Mr <NAME> was quite sorry for him , and almost felt mistrustful that in buying the house he had done him an irreparable injury .
<NAME> is like <NAME> in <NAME> ; at least its townspeople say so .
' Lord bless me ! ' cried <NAME> .
The impression made upon me , however made , never left me .
" She exerts herself very much for <NAME> , sir , " I said .
' ' Scuse the liberty , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , seeing he was not clearly remembered , ' but my wife Polly , as was called Richards in your family -- ' A change in Mr <NAME> ' s face , which seemed to express recollection of him , and so it did , but it expressed in a much stronger degree an angry sense of humiliation , stopped Mr Toodle short .
Say that again , " cried <NAME> in a shrill , sharp voice .
To them which is in adversity , besides , your face is a cord ' l .
nearly closed , with perhaps two shutters down , or one ; but through those gaps such glimpses !
She would make him move his chair to her side of the fire , instead of sitting opposite ; and there he would remain in a nook between Mrs Pipchin and the fender , with all the light of his little face absorbed into the black bombazeen drapery , studying every line and wrinkle of her countenance , and peering at the hard grey eye , until Mrs <NAME> was sometimes fain to shut it , on pretence of dozing .
<NAME> and you , to whom the circle of the sciences is open ; <NAME> and you , who may be said to be replete with facts ; <NAME> and you , who have been trained to mathematical exactness ; <NAME> and you , here ! ' cried <NAME> .
No , good darling , I ' ll never tell her ! ' This helped Mr Dorrit to break his silence .
You wo n't find half so much fault in me if you think of me in my forge dress , with my hammer in my hand , or even my pipe .
It only shows how right I was .
" Now you know all about it , <NAME> , " said <NAME> .
' And what does the boy say ? ' said my aunt .
Well-conducted house , and highly respectable landlady. ' They replied that they would be happy to substitute a reality for the pretence , which , in the main , appeared to be as one with Mr Inspector ' s meaning .
<NAME> could swallow a great many things with ease , and was by some few sullen minds supposed to be rather rapidly swallowing <NAME> ; but , his morning 's chocolate could not so much as get into the throat of <NAME> , without the aid of four strong men besides the <NAME> .
I ' m with you directly , sir !
His utter disregard of other people , as shown in his way of tossing the little womanly toys of furniture about , flinging favourite cushions under his boots for a softer rest , and crushing delicate coverings with his big body and his great black head , had the same brute selfishness at the bottom of it .
This is the way young coves is spiled and drove wrong .
<NAME> , whom he had left a lily , had become a peony ; but that was not much .
Everything was left , all right .
<NAME> fortitude -- great strength of mind. ' ' They must have been very happy , ' said <NAME> .
'We call it a put-up robbery , ladies , ' said <NAME> , turning to them , as if he pitied their ignorance , but had a contempt for the doctor 's , 'when the servants is in it . '
" I beg your pardon , sir , " he said to my guardian with a manly kind of diffidence , " but you did me the honour to mention the young lady 's name -- " " <NAME> . "
' Good bye , <NAME> , ' cried <NAME> faintly .
There was a most irritating end to every one of these debates .
' What curious people you are !
" I know 'd my name to be <NAME> , chrisen 'd Abel .
With these treasures then , after her own daily lessons were over , <NAME> sat down at night to track <NAME> ' s footsteps through the thorny ways of learning ; and being possessed of a naturally quick and sound capacity , and taught by that most wonderful of masters , love , it was not long before she gained upon <NAME> ' s heels , and caught and passed him .
I wanted to do it very quiet , but you wouldn ' t let me .
Consider how natural and how plain it is , my dear , that it should be so .
' You ' re never to be trusted , ' screamed the woman ; ' you were out all day yesterday , and gallivanting somewhere I know .
' I ca n't keep her alive , can I ? '
<NAME> <NAME> reflected for a short time , and then , buttoning up his coat with great determination , said -- ' I ' ll keep a pike. ' ' Wot ! ' exclaimed <NAME> .
" You hit the nail on the head .
" I wear the chain I forged in life , " replied the <NAME> .
It was not a face in its first bloom ; she was a woman five and thirty years of age .
As ill at ease as on the first night of his lying down to sleep within those dreary walls , he wore the night out with such thoughts .
'If _you_ please , sir , ' returned <NAME> .
What am I to say , indoors ?
So let us say goodbye for the present , and -- there , there -- take care of that box , my dear sir -- and -- no , no , not a word now ; but be careful of the crossings and -- ' And with any disjointed and unconnected words which would prevent <NAME> from pouring forth his thanks , the brothers hurried him out : shaking hands with him all the way , and affecting very unsuccessfully -- they were poor hands at deception ! -- to be wholly unconscious of the feelings that completely mastered him .
Mrs <NAME> went to a door , looked in beyond it , and came back .
Then , he was alone with <NAME> , plodding on as on the previous day ; and as shadowy people passed them , he felt the robber 's grasp upon his wrist .
'Only to show you my meaning clearly , ' said the Jew , raising his eyebrows .
All the glory and splendour of the day are coming on , and growing brighter every minute .
I 'll call up that poor lad , <NAME> , and save him from being murdered in his bed ; or his throat , " I says , " may be cut from his right ear to his left , without his ever knowing it . " '
' <NAME> ' t you feel how naughty it is of you , ' resumed <NAME> , ' to be a wax-work child , when you might have the proud consciousness of assisting , to the extent of your infant powers , the manufactures of your country ; of improving your mind by the constant contemplation of the steam-engine ; and of earning a comfortable and independent subsistence of from two-and-ninepence to three shillings per week ?
They had been engaged when they were both very young , I told him ( a little indignantly ) and when the prospect before them was much fairer and brighter .
Altogether , I am well off , when I tell my income on the fingers of my left hand , I pass the third finger and take in the fourth to the middle joint .
While he took his supper , <NAME> sat by him , sometimes admonishing him to hold his fork by the handle , like a polite child , and at other times carving for him , or pouring out his drink .
I ' d open one of those doors , and I ' d cram ' em all in , and then I ' d lock the door and through the keyhole I ' d blow in pepper. ' ' What would be the good of blowing in pepper ? ' asked <NAME> .
And besides , again , most men are disappointed in life , somehow or other , and influenced by their disappointment .
For my own part , I looked on <NAME> as a modern <NAME> , and pictured him the bosom friend of all the <NAME> in the <NAME> , sitting under canopies , smoking curly golden pipes -- a mile long , if they could be straightened out .
With a third call , more imperative than either of the two former , <NAME> felt obliged to comply , and this time a chorus was maintained not only by the two men together , but also by the third man on horseback , who being by his position debarred from a nearer participation in the revels of the night , roared when his companions roared , and rent the very air .
<NAME> that it might be hazardous to <NAME> to see him without preparation , Mr <NAME> accepted the offer ; and they were left shut up in the room , looking down through its barred window into the jail .
Lying still , after that , I found that she sat down near me , whispering to herself ' Poor boy ! ' And then it made me twenty times more wretched , to know how unselfishly mindful she was of me , and how selfishly mindful I was of myself .
He 's got it buttoned in his breast .
When her husband was brought in , she turned a look upon him , so sustaining , so encouraging , so full of admiring love and pitying tenderness , yet so courageous for his sake , that it called the healthy blood into his face , brightened his glance , and animated his heart .
I am sure it was while I lay in that bed there , that the thought entered my head of turning the danger I had passed through , to the account of being for some time supposed to have disappeared mysteriously , and of proving <NAME> .
' Yes , they were , ' replied the bagman ; ' very nice men indeed ! ' <NAME> ' s conscience had been somewhat reproaching him for his recent neglect of his friends at the <NAME> ; and he was just on the point of walking forth in quest of them , on the third morning after the election had terminated , when his faithful valet put into his hand a card , on which was engraved the following inscription : -- ' <NAME> ' s a-waitin ' , ' said <NAME> , epigrammatically .
I tell you , if I had stood by , tamely and passively , I should have hated myself , and merited the contempt of every man in existence .
He knew himself by no other name than One Hundred and <NAME> , <NAME> , when he made shoes under my care .
And she actually set off while we three stood looking at one another lost in amazement .
' I have lived an adventurous life .
' I appeal to his lordship. ' ' I should decidedly say it was a mile , ' remarked <NAME> , with a solemn aspect .
It must be carried to the market-town : which is not more than four miles off , by the footpath across the field : and thence dispatched , by an express on horseback , straight to <NAME> .
'Take this lantern , ' said <NAME> , looking into the room .
They formed my character , and filled me with an abhorrence of evil-doers .
' A little too much , I think , ' <NAME> reflected scornfully , ' to have <NAME> ' s lodger laying claim to me , and keeping eligible people off !
exclaimed the old gentleman , reddening .
Something seemed to pass into my place that was like the angel he thought me , and I felt so sorrowful for the loss he had sustained !
But he was deaf ; and when the sexton ( who peradventure , on a pinch , might have walked a mile with great difficulty in half-a-dozen hours ) exchanged a remark with him about his work , the child could not help noticing that he did so with an impatient kind of pity for his infirmity , as if he were himself the strongest and heartiest man alive .
" How do you find them ?
Here <NAME> stopped to look about him for the domicile of <NAME> , plasterer , whose name , according to the custom of <NAME> , <NAME> had never seen or heard of to that hour .
Indeed , ' said <NAME> , glancing from the fair original to the picture and back , ' I can not even now say which is not your portrait. ' ' D ' ye hear that , <NAME> ? ' cried Mr Meagles to his wife , who had followed her daughter .
' You look much better. ' ' Thanks to you , sir -- great change -- <NAME> ' s Fleet -- unwholesome place -- very , ' said <NAME> , shaking his head .
' Thank you , <NAME> , ' returned <NAME> , laughing , and reaching across in high glee to shake hands with me .
" You do n't expect anybody to believe this , about the lady and the sovereign , do you ? "
Her admiration of her once stately patron is , and has been ever since the morning of her shock in <NAME> ' s Place , platonic , but not weakened in the least .
You see I know her. ' <NAME> looked at him as if he were petrified with astonishment , but did not speak ; perhaps lacking the power .
So the son , bringing to me the father ' s rent ( which I receive ) , imparted his secret , and pointed out that he was determined to pursue his genius , and that it would put him in peril of starvation , and that he was not formed for it. ' ' For pursuing his genius , sir ? ' ' <NAME> , my dear , ' said <NAME> , ' for starvation .
<NAME> at our mother , think of her , recall her emotion when she recovered you .
No change , no degradation , no perversion of humanity , in any grade , through all the mysteries of wonderful creation , has monsters half so horrible and dread .
If I found out the nearest proper authorities , and offered myself to go for a soldier , or a sailor , I was such a little fellow that it was most likely they wouldn ' t take me in .
<NAME> supposes that these are honourable men , rich and distinguished , and how CAN I -- how can I undeceive her -- when she is so happy in these little delusions , which are the only happiness she has ?
No clue to how body came into river .
'It 's all a lie together , ' replied <NAME> .
' It cert ' nly seems a queer start to send out pocket- ' ankerchers to people as don ' t know the use on ' em , ' observed <NAME> .
' <NAME> yourself. ' But she still repeated the same words , continually exclaiming , ' Oh , the river ! ' over and over again .
Their conference was very short , but very decided .
There has been more than enough of that extreme .
' Shaken out of destiny ' s dice-box again into your company , eh ?
' Now I am glad to know that !
It was by this time dark ; I heard the clocks strike ten , as I sat resting .
He never could make out why everybody was not quite satisfied , and he felt conscious that he set a brilliant social example in being particularly well satisfied with most things , and , above all other things , with himself .
Or at all events , when the sun is down , and the weather is driving in from the sea ? ' <NAME> thought not .
Theer ' s been kiender a blessing fell upon us , ' said <NAME> , reverentially inclining his head , ' and we ' ve done nowt but prosper .
' It will serve you as much as bringing it to me , I promise you .
He did not laugh himself out of the intention , however , for on he went : picturing to himself , as he approached the place , all kinds of splendid possibilities , and impossibilities too , for that matter , and thinking himself , perhaps with good reason , very fortunate to be endowed with so buoyant and sanguine a temperament .
' You know—and <NAME> should now know likewise—that I took a great prepossession against <NAME> , arising out of his furious conduct on that first occasion .
" No , thank you , " said I .
" In short , my valued friend , " pursued <NAME> , advancing her lips to my ear with an air of equal patronage and mystery , " I must tell you a secret .
You may trust in me -- I know it and I say it , dear , -- with the whole confidence even of your pure heart .
' I have noticed you go past our house , sir , several times in the course of the last week or so. ' ' Our house , ' repeated the other .
says <NAME> , " I 've lost him again ! "
<NAME> as I , of all men , should do that , my girl !
Those abject wretches -- ' ' <NAME> ' t call names , <NAME> , ' said Mr Boffin .
The third , the Olympic , is a tiny show-box for vaudevilles and burlesques .
<NAME> in the fire , as I like to hear you tell how you used to do when you lived in that dreary old house that had once been a windmill .
We are , <NAME> , Your obedient servants , <NAME> & <NAME> .
He advanced towards it trembling .
When the <NAME> came round , <NAME> caused an application to be made for the postponement of his trial until the following Sessions .
I was much disconcerted , but I reflected that if the main point were gained , it mattered little how strangely he perverted everything leading to it .
' I will indeed , upon my soul and body. ' ' And then , ' said <NAME> , with her arms uplifted towards the sky , and her head thrown back and shaking , ' if he ' s true to his word , I ' ll never come a-near him though I know where he is , and never breathe a syllable about him !
They ' ve not doon me a kindness , ma ' am , as I know and feel .
When he has helped himself , <NAME> follows suit , sitting at the extreme end of the little oblong table and taking his plate on his knees .
But of the loved , revered , and honoured head , thou canst not turn one hair to thy dread purposes , or make one feature odious .
<NAME> raised his right hand , and shook his trembling forefinger in the air ; but his passion was so great , that the power of speech was for the moment gone .
And as aëronauts make themselves heavier when they wish to descend , similarly <NAME> charges himself with more liquid from the wicker bottle , that he may come down the better .
' Suppose I so repeated it to Mr Boffin , as to insinuate that my sensitive delicacy and honour -- ' ' Very good words , Sophronia. ' ' -- As to insinuate that <NAME> sensitive delicacy and honour , ' she resumed , with a bitter stress upon the phrase , ' would not allow us to be silent parties to so mercenary and designing a speculation on the Secretary ' s part , and so gross a breach of faith towards his confiding employer .
' Take my advice , ' said <NAME> : ' don ' t ask me why , but take it .
Walks sometimes for two hours when she has them bad .
Oh , <NAME> , if I could have brought you millions , I never could have been so happy for your sake , as I am ! ' ' And you , dear <NAME> ?
Then she saw him dead , upon that very bed , and in that very room , and knew that he had never loved her to the last , and fell upon his cold breast , passionately weeping .
' Let me speak a word with you in private , ' said <NAME> .
After combating , for nearly a week , the feeling which impelled me to revisit the place I had quitted under the circumstances already detailed , I yielded to it at length ; and determining that this time I would present myself by the light of day , bent my steps thither early in the morning .
The latter ceremony , however little importance the unconscious Captain attached to it , was not wholly superfluous ; for , on the previous day , so much excitement had been occasioned in the neighbourhood , by the shutters remaining unopened , that the Instrument-maker ' s house had been honoured with an unusual share of public observation , and had been intently stared at from the opposite side of the way , by groups of hungry gazers , at any time between sunrise and sunset .
You liked me , didn ' t you ?
Although I am very well off , ' said Mr Toots , with energy , ' you can ' t think what a miserable Beast I am .
" I only want to rouse him .
Scared by the sudden breaking of the dead stillness of the place , and by a loud cry which followed it , <NAME> let his lantern fall , and knew not whether to advance or fly .
That I had a fever and was avoided , that I suffered greatly , that I often lost my reason , that the time seemed interminable , that I confounded impossible existences with my own identity ; that I was a brick in the house-wall , and yet entreating to be released from the giddy place where the builders had set me ; that I was a steel beam of a vast engine , clashing and whirling over a gulf , and yet that I implored in my own person to have the engine stopped , and my part in it hammered off ; that I passed through these phases of disease , I know of my own remembrance , and did in some sort know at the time .
'Burn my body , if he is n't more trouble than a whole family of <NAME> .
' You are too considerate. ' ' Not at all , I thank you , ' answered <NAME> again .
One , the cleverest and most celebrated among them , took me aside , and bidding me prepare for the worst , told me -- me , the madman ! -- that my wife was mad .
The beauty and freshness of this calm retreat , in the very dawn and greenness of summer—it was then the beginning of June—were exquisite indeed .
Open the door , beautiful Mrs Flintwinch , and in the meantime let me to pass upstairs , to present my compliments -- homage of <NAME> -- to my lady !
She has devoted herself to an extensive variety of public subjects at various times and is at present ( until something else attracts her ) devoted to the subject of <NAME> , with a view to the general cultivation of the coffee berry -- AND the natives -- and the happy settlement , on the banks of the <NAME> rivers , of our superabundant home population .
The parish authorities inquired with dignity of the workhouse authorities , whether there was no female then domiciled in 'the house ' who was in a situation to impart to <NAME> , the consolation and nourishment of which he stood in need .
<NAME> chooses as we would have <NAME> choose .
At length , during a moment of comparative silence , the little man called out in a very loud , solemn voice , -- ' Mr .
" Quite an adventure for a morning in <NAME> ! "
' They were really gone. ' ' Does he know where to find that lady ? ' ' Can ' t say .
Whether they would tread in the blood when it crept so far , and carry it about the house among those many prints of feet , or even out into the street .
' Now , <NAME> , ' said he ; ' where did you come from and where are you going to ? ' The poor soul confusedly asked the counter-question where she was ?
' Do you know <NAME> ? ' asked the new client .
Then , he thought of all the horrors of the gallows and the scaffold -- and stopped to watch a man sprinkling the floor to cool it -- and then went on to think again .
As he expressed himself to this effect , with assumed carelessness , he took a step or two nearer the concealed spy , as the latter could tell from the distinctness with which he heard him mutter , 'It must be he ! '
It so happened that <NAME> , senior , instead of being deeply engaged in reading the letter , as <NAME> thought , chanced to be looking over the top of it at no less a person than <NAME> himself ; rightly conjecturing that the face aforesaid was made in ridicule and derision of his own person , he fixed his eyes on <NAME> with such expressive sternness , that the late <NAME> ' s lineaments gradually resolved themselves into a very fine expression of humility and confusion .
It being market morning at a neighboring town some ten miles off , <NAME> was not at home .
My guardian had gone out to inquire about him and did not return to dinner .
So like <NAME> , was n't it ? '
The <NAME> , stronger yet , repulsed him .
I have seen your nobler aspirations fall off one by one , until the master-passion , <NAME> , engrosses you .
You muthn ' t mind your thon having a comic livery on. ' They all three went in ; and <NAME> sat down forlorn , on the <NAME> ' s performing chair in the middle of the ring .
There was not the smallest speculation , however , in the countenance of <NAME> .
" It comes from other regions , <NAME> , and is conveyed by other ministers , to other kinds of men .
<NAME> again gazed at him : as it seemed mechanically .
She might go a-berryin ME . "
The landlord of the house had not withdrawn his eye from this place of espial for five minutes , and <NAME> had only just returned from making the communication above related , when <NAME> , in the course of his evening 's business , came into the bar to inquire after some of his young pupils .
Yet the general character of his countenance was pleasant and agreeable .
<NAME> and day the conquering engines rumbled at their distant work , or , advancing smoothly to their journey ' s end , and gliding like tame dragons into the allotted corners grooved out to the inch for their reception , stood bubbling and trembling there , making the walls quake , as if they were dilating with the secret knowledge of great powers yet unsuspected in them , and strong purposes not yet achieved .
<NAME> anything taken place , <NAME> ? ' said Mrs. <NAME> eagerly .
My husband was a Powler. ' ' Beg your pardon , really ! ' said the stranger .
<NAME> himself confirmed this when it was stated , and said that he should like to begin to see him do it .
<NAME> readily consenting , <NAME> ordered out young Barnet as a matter of course .
' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , with a great disrelish .
Very good indeed , my dear ! '
That when <NAME> took her into custody and led her away , she smiled and gave me her delicious hand .
' I am sure , ' said <NAME> , writhing himself into the silence like a Conger-eel , ' that this is a subject full of unpleasantness to everybody .
Though I do know better , <NAME> , and am very sorry for it. ' She came and kissed him , and went back into her corner again .

He said it was like those times , to be alone with <NAME> and me again ; and he wished to Heaven they had never changed .

<NAME> intimates by sidling back a pace or two , with a very unaccountable wrench of his wry face , that he does not regard the transaction as being made more promising by this incident .

Misses <NAME> -- <NAME> -- ! ' The young woman , however , equally unmoved by his direct appeal to her , and by his inarticulate utterance , remained quite neutral , until , after struggling with his assailant into a corner , <NAME> disengaged himself , and stood there panting and fenced in by his own elbows , while the old woman , panting too , and stamping with rage and eagerness , appeared to be collecting her energies for another swoop upon him .

We will refer that question , if you please , to <NAME> Micawber. ' ' Ury -- ! ' Mrs. Heep began , with an anxious gesture .
They traversed the streets in profound silence ; and after walking at a round pace for some distance , arrived in one , of a gloomy appearance and very little frequented , near the <NAME> .
' Why , <NAME> , ' said the old woman , ' you haven ' t been -- you don ' t mean to say you ' ve been a -- ' ' Sitting up all night ? ' said <NAME> , supplying the conclusion of the sentence .

It struck me that if Mrs. <NAME> had discharged her own natural duties and obligations before she swept the horizon with a telescope in search of others , she would have taken the best precautions against becoming absurd , but I need scarcely observe that I kept this to myself .
I passed the day in a ditch , and the night in a pigsty .

' When I was your age , young <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' I was punctual , or I got no dinner ! ' ' When you were my age , ' resumed <NAME> , ' you hadn ' t a wrong balance to get right , and hadn ' t to dress afterwards. ' ' Never mind that now , ' said <NAME> .

That the shadow should be deep as it came on , like the shadow of an actual presence , was in accordance with the laws of the physical world , for all the Light that shone on <NAME> lay beyond <NAME> .
It affected us to see <NAME> clinging , then , to her deplorable home and hanging on her mother 's neck with the greatest tenderness .
She then hastily attired herself for walking , and leaving word that she should return within a couple of hours , hurried away towards her uncle ' s house .
Never again. ' ' She ' s very sensitive , ' said <NAME> , looking after her .
' I tell you , my good fellow , ' said <NAME> , with his indolent laugh , ' that I have nothing to do with swearing. ' ' He can swear AT you , ' <NAME> explained ; ' and so can I .

At length the signal was given , and all the ring leaned forward .
He was so honest and warm-hearted , that to see him again and be assured of his truth to her in her distress , was a joy and comfort beyond all price ; but for that very reason , it was so affecting to think that she caused him a moment ' s unhappiness , or ruffled , by a breath , the harmless current of his life , that her eyes filled with tears , and her bosom overflowed with pity .
And the way in which the <NAME> ' s bride dashed at the unassailable position so considerately to be held by <NAME> , and scattered the whole of the works in all directions in a moment , was triumphant .
That he had relented , in consideration of his youth , his professed contrition , and his friends .
LET us strike the key-note again , before pursuing the tune .
" Do not forget. " The initials of those words are within here now , and were within here then .
The administration of infantine doses of physic awakened all the active sympathy of her character ; and being on one occasion secreted in a cupboard ( whither she had fled in modesty ) , when Mr <NAME> was introduced into the nursery by his sister , to behold his son , in the course of preparation for bed , taking a short walk uphill over <NAME> ' s gown , in a short and airy linen jacket , <NAME> was so transported beyond the ignorant present as to be unable to refrain from crying out , ' Is he not beautiful Mr Dombey !

He made nothing of the people about him as he tramped on , staring over their heads into the body of the court .
It was a habit with <NAME> , whenever he became thoughtful , to put his hands in his breeches pockets .
<NAME> <NAME> would have been little disposed to linger in bed , though his bed had been in a more private situation , and less affected by the raking out of yesterday ' s fire , the kindling of to-day ' s under the collegiate boiler , the filling of that <NAME> vessel at the pump , the sweeping and sawdusting of the common room , and other such preparations .
' I believe , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' that <NAME> is not a young man ? ' ' Oh , no , ' replied <NAME> ; ' old enough to be my father. ' ' You have told my learned friend that you have known <NAME> a long time .
How true ! ' ' As I say , sir , ' pompously went on the Mayor , ' the arm of the law is a strong arm , and a long arm .

Whether his meditations on mortality had touched his liver , or whether his general health had been previously at all amiss , or whether he desired to show a little attention to an eminent man , is not so much to the purpose , as that he made a short call upon his medical adviser -- a distinguished surgeon -- on his way back .
I developed her into what she is , that she might be loved .
This was odd enough : but what was more embarrassing was , that all along the passage , and all along the narrow stairs , blocking up the window , and making the dark entry darker still , was a confused crowd of persons with great importance depicted in their looks ; who were , to all appearance , waiting in silent expectation of some coming event .
The crisis ! ' He had sauntered far enough .
<NAME> got up from the table , making as if she had forgotten something , and went into the next room ; and I heard her sob there .
' I have considered the young ' ooman .
It ' s very considerate of you to try to hide from me that you are uncomfortable about something , but it ' s quite impossible to be done , <NAME> love. ' ' I admit that I am rather uneasy , my own. ' ' Then please to tell me what about , sir. ' But no , he evaded that .
Rising at five o ' clock next morning , I took a walk about the village : none of the houses were strolling about to-day , but it was early for them yet , perhaps : and then amused myself by lounging in a kind of farm-yard behind the tavern , of which the leading features were , a strange jumble of rough sheds for stables ; a rude colonnade , built as a cool place of summer resort ; a deep well ; a great earthen mound for keeping vegetables in , in winter time ; and a pigeon-house , whose little apertures looked , as they do in all pigeon-houses , very much too small for the admission of the plump and swelling-breasted birds who were strutting about it , though they tried to get in never so hard .
And he grew to be proud of the title .
Once , I opened the yard-gate , and looked into the empty street .
He ' d got an old newspaper with him , and some other account in print of the storm .

Who ' s number twenty-two , that ' s to put all the others out ?
The confidence there has been between us must be broken off. ' ' When ? ' cried <NAME> .
It is her and it a n't her .

We have in vain pored over the leaves of <NAME> ' s note-book , in the hope of meeting with a general summary of these beautiful compositions .
Traders in the avarice , indifference , or imbecility of parents , and the helplessness of children ; ignorant , sordid , brutal men , to whom few considerate persons would have entrusted the board and lodging of a horse or a dog ; they formed the worthy cornerstone of a structure , which , for absurdity and a magnificent high-minded LAISSEZ-ALLER neglect , has rarely been exceeded in the world .
Among sundry minor alterations in Mr <NAME> ' s life and habits that began to take place at this time , none was more remarkable than the extraordinary diligence with which he applied himself to business , and the closeness with which he investigated every detail that the affairs of the <NAME> laid open to him .
I want to set you more right with yourself . "
O let us be joyful , joyful !
The lull had a sedative and philosophical influence on <NAME> , who followed me out into the road to say , as a parting observation that might do me good , " On the <NAME> , <NAME> , and off the <NAME> , <NAME> : -- such is Life ! " With what absurd emotions ( for we think the feelings that are very serious in a man quite comical in a boy ) I found myself again going to <NAME> 's , matters little here .
It was quite an accident , and the way in which it came about was this .
First of all , will you have the goodness to inform me where I shall find my voice ; and secondly , what has become of my flesh ? ' The <NAME> only shook her head mournfully , and cried again ; whereupon Mr Swiveller ( being very weak ) felt his own eyes affected likewise .
" You are kinder to me than I often am to myself , " he returned .
But the second object of this interview , I must not forget .

' ' La , <NAME> , ' said Mrs. <NAME> , colouring up to the very border of her cap , as she fancied she observed a species of matrimonial twinkle in the eyes of her lodger ; ' La , <NAME> , what a question ! ' ' Well , but do you ? ' inquired <NAME> .
" Such an unworldly , uncalculating , gossamer creature is a relief to him and an amusement .

Loose , the sub-agent of the mixed band of the <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , and <NAME> , of the mercantile firm of <NAME> and Co. , of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , in which the latter was slain with a bowie-knife .

The sapient pot-boy , looking on officially , then had the conviction borne in upon his soul , that the man was evermore outcast and excommunicate from the <NAME> .
Down in the cellars , as up in the bed-chambers , old objects that he well remembered were changed by age and decay , but were still in their old places ; even to empty beer-casks hoary with cobwebs , and empty wine-bottles with fur and fungus choking up their throats .
" Secondly , what will satisfy me for the trouble of producing it , sir , " repeats <NAME> .
' A most admirable memory. ' ' Thank you , ma ' am .

It announces itself , in the new <NAME> , as a novel enterprise , timidly beginning to spring up .
<NAME> <NAME> , with the normal perplexity of his face heightened and his hair rumpled , looked at them for some minutes , as if he could n't make out how they came to be boarding and lodging in that establishment , and why they had n't been billeted by <NAME> on somebody else .
From <NAME> ' s , Veneering dashes at <NAME> ' s place of business .
' To say to me -- ? ' ' That I hope you will not misunderstand my father .
If she betrayed any agitation , when she presented herself to <NAME> , he did not observe it ; for merely inquiring if she had brought the money , and receiving a reply in the affirmative , he uttered a growl of satisfaction , and replacing his head upon the pillow , resumed the slumbers which her arrival had interrupted .
As foreign steamers would leave <NAME> at about the time of high-water , our plan would be to get down the river by a previous ebb-tide , and lie by in some quiet spot until we could pull off to one .
<NAME> said from behind ( again poking me ) , " Massive and concrete. " So I said boldly , as if I had originated it , and must beg to insist upon it , " Massive and concrete. " " I am glad to have your approbation , gentlemen , " said <NAME> , with an air of dignity , in spite of his being ground against the wall at the time , and holding on by the seat of the chair .
Just as this change had been effected , there presented himself for shaving , a big , burly , good-humoured coal-heaver with a pipe in his mouth , who , drawing his hand across his chin , requested to know when a shaver would be disengaged .
It is enough for me to say that some of its circumstances passed before my own eyes ; for the remainder I know them to have happened , and there are some persons yet living , who will remember them but too well .
<NAME> , who was a member of the little council , ventured to insinuate some doubts relative to the probability of <NAME> ' s arriving at this happy consummation in the compass of an ordinary lifetime ; but the good lady set that question entirely at rest , by informing them that she had a presentiment on the subject -- a species of second-sight with which she had been in the habit of clenching every argument with the deceased <NAME> , and , in nine cases and three-quarters out of every ten , determining it the wrong way .
I want to make it nerve you , and inspire you , <NAME> ! ' ' Oh , but that ' s so shocking ! ' cried <NAME> .

But after dinner , when I made him take his pipe , and when I had loitered with him about the forge , and when we sat down together on the great block of stone outside it , we got on better .
And the pot-boy afterwards remarked , that he hadn ' t been ' so rattled to bed ' , since his late mother had systematically accelerated his retirement to rest with a poker .
" I am in town on leave just now , " said <NAME> .
He was rather reserved , but I thought him very sensible and agreeable .
A clattering of clogs upon the pavement ; a rapid ringing of bells ; and all the melancholy mad elephants , polished and oiled up for the day ' s monotony , were at their heavy exercise again .
Mr <NAME> seemed much relieved and gladdened by the acquisition , and chuckled rapturously during the remainder of his visit .
I should soon be eased of it , if I did .
Unless your mind is prepared for the stairs , it will lead to inevitable disappointment .
I tried to cheer my darling , and asked her what it was .
The ladies were in the full delight of this altered behaviour on the part of <NAME> , when the expected swain arrived , with his hair very damp from recent washing , and a clean shirt , whereof the collar might have belonged to some giant ancestor , forming , together with a white waistcoat of similar dimensions , the chief ornament of his person .
The man was dressed like a traveller , in a foraging cap with fur about it , and a heap of cloak .
That done , he shut down his window , and went to bed again .
<NAME> and Mrs. <NAME> coming one afternoon when my guardian was not at home , in the course of conversation I naturally inquired after <NAME> .
This little round table with the marble top ( it ' s two feet ten in circumference ) , I bought .
I only throw it out as a legal point. ' ' Do you think so , Mr Wegg ?
I am quite myself again , my love , quite myself .

And may I represent to you that it ' s injudicious to say the bee ?
" Do n't tell me there 's anything wrong about that security of <NAME> 's !
' I shall never get another ! '
' Well ! ' said <NAME> , putting the repeater back in his pocket ; ' perhaps it is. ' <NAME> gave a peculiar grunt , as was his custom at the end of all disputes with his master , to imply that he ( <NAME> ) triumphed ; and ( as he rarely spoke to anybody unless somebody spoke to him ) fell into a grim silence , and rubbed his hands slowly over each other : cracking the joints of his fingers , and squeezing them into all possible distortions .
How do you spell it ? ' ' Why , as to the spelling of it , ' returned Mr Boffin , with great presence of mind , ' that ' s <NAME> look out .
This cluster is suddenly broken and put aside by the hands of <NAME> ; all the gazing eyes are brought down to the earth by his loudly inquiring of <NAME> , at an open window : ' Where is my nephew ? ' ' He has not been here .

The very first paragraph upon which <NAME> 's eye rested , was the following advertisement .
But even then his passion for writing letters was too strong to be resisted ; for while we were yet in the height of our excitement , hope , and wonder , the following pastoral note was brought to me from a neighbouring tavern , at which he had called to write it : -- ' Most secret and confidential .

At the water ' s edge they were saluted by <NAME> , who looked white enough after his late adventure , but who made very light of it notwithstanding , -- laughing at the mention of <NAME> .
' I was thinking , <NAME> , that we have often houses to let for people we are concerned for , and matters of that sort .
<NAME> assistance as I have prevailed upon her to accept , I have been obliged , at her own earnest request , to dole out in the smallest portions , lest he , finding how easily money was procured , should squander it even more lightly than he is accustomed to do .
Not so , for I would willingly serve you a year -- two years -- any term you might appoint -- before that should begin to be a consideration between us. ' ' Where do you come from ? ' asked Mr Boffin .

Because he ' s a proud , haughty , consequential , turned-up-nosed peacock. ' Mrs. Squeers , when excited , was accustomed to use strong language , and , moreover , to make use of a plurality of epithets , some of which were of a figurative kind , as the word peacock , and furthermore the allusion to <NAME> ' s nose , which was not intended to be taken in its literal sense , but rather to bear a latitude of construction according to the fancy of the hearers .
We had a struggle near the door .
He haunts my thoughts , like a dreadful ghost .

Into her mind , as into all others contending with the great affliction of our mortal nature , there had stolen solemn wonderings and hopes , arising in the dim world beyond the present life , and murmuring , like faint music , of recognition in the far-off land between her brother and her mother : of some present consciousness in both of her : some love and commiseration for her : and some knowledge of her as she went her way upon the earth .
<NAME> <NAME> , assisted by a <NAME> of <NAME> , arranges the affairs of the elder <NAME> 56 .
For they said , it was a shame to quarrel upon Christmas Day .
You can do as much by me , I have no doubt , beforehand. ' ' Possibly , ' remarked <NAME> .
' And it is very sinful to rebel against them , ' whispered the clergyman .
' It ' s very agreeable to hear .
This brought him to a stop .
At length the breakfast is ready .
For a long time after it was ushered into this world of sorrow and trouble , by the parish surgeon , it remained a matter of considerable doubt whether the child would survive to bear any name at all ; in which case it is somewhat more than probable that these memoirs would never have appeared ; or , if they had , that being comprised within a couple of pages , they would have possessed the inestimable merit of being the most concise and faithful specimen of biography , extant in the literature of any age or country .
' <NAME> ' t I told you what a mercenary little wretch I am ?
The <NAME> of <NAME> ever shone anywhere , he certainly never shone in the house of <NAME> .
Comes <NAME> in his black coat ; come the <NAME> ; come ( when the gorging vessel is replete ) the 'prentices and <NAME> , to be edified ; comes at last , with his slouching head , and his shuffle backward , and his shuffle forward , and his shuffle to the right , and his shuffle to the left , and his bit of fur cap in his muddy hand , which he picks as if it were some mangy bird he had caught and was plucking before eating raw , <NAME> , the very , very tough subject <NAME> is to improve .
And now , as I dare urge no more -- as I am not sure that I have a right to do so -- though <NAME> knows , even that doubt may be habit , ' said the gentleman , rubbing his head , as despondently as before , ' let me ; though a stranger , yet no stranger ; ask two favours. ' ' What are they ? ' she inquired .
' May I venture to inquire what is your version of the matter ? ' ' You may , ' said <NAME> , ' and I will give it to you in honour and in word as true as in this shop I stand .
I really don ' t know what would be best to do , and that ' s the truth .
In fact , she has very little left , indeed. ' ' You as-tound me , <NAME> ! ' cried <NAME> .
He read that he was dishonoured .
This was a question more difficult of solution ; but as knaves generally overreach themselves by imputing their own designs to others , the idea immediately presented itself that some circumstances of irritation between <NAME> and the old man , arising out of their secret transactions and not unconnected perhaps with his sudden disappearance , now rendered the former desirous of revenging himself upon him by seeking to entrap the sole object of his love and anxiety into a connexion of which he knew he had a dread and hatred .
She only knew that there had been an attack upon the prisons , that all political prisoners had been in danger , and that some had been dragged out by the crowd and murdered .
' Bless my soul ! ' said Mrs. Cluppins .
What should we do without strength , my friends ?
If I am ever a little provoking , I am sure you ' ll consider what a thing it is to occupy my position and feel a consciousness of being superior to it .
" O yes I shall ! " said he .
The absurdity of the situation put its pathos to the rout .
' Are you reconciled ? ' Looking fixedly at me , she puts her hand to her forehead , and moans .
That ' s the mark ; come up to the mark , sir .
I will be there and back , before breakfast. ' The old man shook his head , and sighing mournfully , drew her towards him .
It was a wonderfully fine thing to have that lofty castle to myself , and to feel , when I shut my outer door , like <NAME> , when he had got into his fortification , and pulled his ladder up after him .
' Why should you be so uncomfortable ? ' ' Thank you , <NAME> , ' replied my aunt , ' I prefer to sit upon my property. ' Here my aunt looked hard at Mrs. Crupp , and observed , ' We needn ' t trouble you to wait , ma ' am. ' ' Shall I put a little more tea in the pot afore I go , ma ' am ? ' said Mrs. Crupp .
<NAME> , ha ! ' Now , it was evident , as <NAME> laughed , that something struck her as being exceedingly funny ; and as the young ladies took their tone from <NAME> -- she being the chief -- they all got up a laugh without a moment ' s delay , and nodded their heads a little , and smiled sarcastically to each other , as much as to say how very good that was !
Do not forget Your ever grateful and affectionate P.S. -- Particularly remember that <NAME> deserves the best remembrance in which you can hold her .

If you want to out with something , out with it ! "
When I was at home expecting to be rich , I thought vaguely of all the great things I would do .
At length the procession was dissolved by the violent arrival of a nutmeg , before which the drawing-room door bounced open as if it were a cannon-ball ; and while that fragrant article , dispersed through several glasses of coloured warm water , was going the round of society , <NAME> returned to her seat by her new friend .
' What is it , my dear ?
I am not going home now ; I have a visit to make alone .
Your knowledge of old <NAME> , <NAME> , such as he is , and old <NAME> ' s knowledge of you , <NAME> , had its origin in a noble fellow , <NAME> -- in a great creature , <NAME> .

It wandered back to my godmother 's house and came along the intervening track , raising up shadowy speculations which had sometimes trembled there in the dark as to what knowledge <NAME> had of my earliest history -- even as to the possibility of his being my father , though that idle dream was quite gone now .
' Oh dear , yes , sir ! ' cried this hopeful penitent .
He rose and raised me with him .
Because you HAVE no proof. ' ' Men are very wise in their way , ' quoth Mrs Lammle , glancing haughtily at the <NAME> portrait , and shaking out her dress before departing ; ' but they have wisdom to learn .
" What 'll you drink , <NAME> ?
<NAME> , too , arrived with two bandboxes ( whereof the bottoms fell out as they were handed from the coach ) and something in a newspaper , which a gentleman had sat upon , coming down , and which was obliged to be ironed again , before it was fit for service .
' I promise it. ' ' That ' s my dear <NAME> .
Only by times , because <NAME> is growing drowsy .
It would do that incorrigible creature : who was the most barbarous infidel in point of poetry : good to be in such company .
'Why , that she could n't very easily get out of doors unless he knew where she was going to , ' said <NAME> ; 'and so the first time she went to see the lady , she -- ha !
Where I might go , what I might do , or when I might return , were questions utterly unknown to me ; nor did I vex my mind with them , for it was wholly set on <NAME> 's safety .
Oliver brushed away two or three tears that were lingering in his eyes ; and seeing no board but the table , fortunately bowed to that .
' Here we are ! ' said <NAME> , hurrying <NAME> into the little parlour , where <NAME> and his wife were taking a lobster supper .
And when I return , we ' ll have a cup of tea , and a chat over future arrangements .
So easy is it to move light hearts .
Their seat was a part of the window ; when there was anything in the way of a procession going on , they used to have bright draperies hung out of the window , and used to kneel or sit on this seat , and look out at it , leaning on the brilliant colour .
At last the day came for going home .
There was little pain , little uneasiness , but there was no rallying , no effort , no struggle for life .
What remained for me now , but to follow him to the dear old forge , and there to have out my disclosure to him , and my penitent remonstrance with him , and there to relieve my mind and heart of that reserved Secondly , which had begun as a vague something lingering in my thoughts , and had formed into a settled purpose ?
" If a fool 's head ca n't express better opinions than that , " said my sister , " and you have got any work to do , you had better go and do it. " So he went .
But my blood boils to avenge this poor murdered creature .
A very brief conversation ensued .
' Will you unclasp your hand ? ' ' Will you tell me who you are ? ' ' No ! ' ' No ! ' In less time than the quickest tongue could tell it , these words were exchanged , and <NAME> shortening his whip , applied it furiously to the head and shoulders of <NAME> .
Perhaps he never told you my story ? ' ' No. ' ' Oh no , why should he !
' Is <NAME> informed of everything , <NAME> ? ' ' Yes. ' ' And has he heard Littimer himself ? ' ' Yes ; I have told him why you wished it. ' ' You are a good girl .
The spinster aunt could hardly believe her eyes .
There a n't such a rusty bit of metal in the place as its own hinges , I believe ; and I 'm sure there 's no such old bones here , as mine .
That she was a young widow , <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> was so deeply overcome on receiving this intelligence that he found it absolutely necessary to cling to his fair informant for support ; and divers little love passages had passed between them , before he was sufficiently collected to return to the subject .
He did so , quite ineffectually .
Mr Inspector , hastily fortifying himself with another glass , strolled out with a noiseless foot and an unoccupied countenance .
Shipping <NAME> and Office Business 14 .
I am not hurt yet. ' ' Then you won ' t grant my request ? ' ' Decidedly , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
There was no need to tell them who it was ; his pale face was enough .
said <NAME> , addressing <NAME> , with supreme contempt .
" She wants this boy to go and play there .
" I write this by request of <NAME> , for to let you know that he is going to <NAME> in company with <NAME> and would be glad if agreeable to be allowed to see you .
At length the same boy reappeared , and presented me with a note written in pencil , and headed , in a legal manner , ' Heep v. <NAME> ' .
' <NAME> , my love , you know Mr Clennam even better than I have the happiness of doing .
'Dear me , I forgot all about it ! '
The well-known massive gray square tower of its old Cathedral ?
' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' allow me to introduce my very particular friend , <NAME> .
I ' m sure I never was more serious .
But when they came to the town of <NAME> -- which they did at eventide , when the streets were filled with people -- he could not conceal from himself that the aspect of affairs was very alarming .
As he happened not to be doing anything at all , he merely boxed his ears , and told him not to do it again .
If you wish to consult me as to your interests , you will find me here at all times alike .
This last suggestion particularly delighted the bystanders , who cheered it rather uproariously , and were , with some difficulty , deterred from dropping down the area and breaking open the kitchen door to ascertain the fact .
Although the presiding Genii in such an office as this , exercise a summary and arbitrary power over the liberties , the good name , the character , almost the lives , of <NAME> 's subjects , expecially of the poorer class ; and although , within such walls , enough fantastic tricks are daily played to make the angels blind with weeping ; they are closed to the public , save through the medium of the daily press .
<NAME> , business ! " They went up slowly and softly .
' Eh ? ' cried Mr Boffin , catching at the name .
Mr <NAME> had repaired abroad , permanently to grace the establishment of his father <NAME> , whose popular manners had obtained him a diplomatic appointment , the honours of which were discharged by himself and <NAME> , to the satisfaction even of their own countrymen and countrywomen : which was considered almost miraculous .
Not an emigrant , he hoped , within the sense and spirit of the law .
" <NAME> , " said I , " I went to <NAME> yesterday , to speak to <NAME> ; and finding that some wind had blown her here , I followed. " <NAME> Havisham motioning to me for the third or fourth time to sit down , I took the chair by the dressing-table , which I had often seen her occupy .
" Wishermaydie if I do n't , sir , " says Jo , reverting to his favourite declaration .
If the greatest wealth or the highest rank were hers , it would only be important in my sight as removing her still farther from me , and making me more hopeless , if that could be .
Very kind of her too , all the folks said , and I said , along with all the folks .
' What is money after all ! ' said Mr Dombey , backing his chair a little , that he might the better gaze in sheer amazement at the presumptuous atom that propounded such an inquiry .
How de do ? ' Mr Toots would say , with a chuckle and a blush .
" Thriving , grandmother , in every way . "
I hope my natur is _NOT _ a soft vun , <NAME> .
They shall all confess your merit , <NAME> .
You are a common fellow , and a common boaster. ' ' Pooh , pooh , ' says <NAME> , equally furious , but more collected ; ' how should you know ?
Firstly , it ' s enough to have been done , without the mortification of being known to have been done .
" It 's a pleasure to talk to him .
For , when <NAME> passed to <NAME> ' s discovery , and from that to their having both seen Mr Boffin dig up the <NAME> bottle , that gentleman changed colour , changed his attitude , became extremely restless , and ended ( when <NAME> ended ) by being in a state of manifest anxiety , trepidation , and confusion .
It was not a little while before I could succeed or could even restrain bursts of grief , but after an hour or so I was better and felt that I might return .
The tide ran strong , I took care to lose none of it , and our steady stroke carried us on thoroughly well .
Our steamboat came up directly this had left the wharf , and soon bore us to the mouth of the <NAME> ; where the stars and stripes of <NAME> flutter on one side and the <NAME> of <NAME> on the other : and so narrow is the space between them that the sentinels in either fort can often hear the watchword of the other country given .
<NAME> <NAME> , imitating his visitor in the matter of these particulars , though the rapt and imperturbable manner of the great <NAME> was far above his powers , sat in the opposite corner of the fireside , observing him respectfully , and as if he waited for some encouragement or expression of curiosity on <NAME> ' s part which should lead him to his own affairs .
' My name ' s <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
Not going to be done ? ' repeated <NAME> .
' Little Dorrit , ' she said , when she at last broke silence , ' what do you know of that man ? ' ' I don ' t know anything of him , ma ' am , except that I have seen him about , and that he has spoken to me. ' ' What has he said to you ? ' ' I don ' t understand what he has said , he is so strange .
As <NAME> was tired of standing , and Mr <NAME> was kind enough to stimulate him by shrill whistles , and various sporting cries , they rattled off at too sharp a pace to admit of much conversation : especially as the pony , incensed by Mr <NAME> ' s admonitions , took a particular fancy for the lamp-posts and cart-wheels , and evinced a strong desire to run on the pavement and rasp himself against the brick walls .
AN ' T it uncommonly jolly now ! ' * * * * * A <NAME> midsummer day .
I suffered unspeakable trouble while I considered and reconsidered whether I should at last dissolve that spell of my childhood and tell <NAME> all the story .
I am afraid -- sore afraid -- that this purpose originated in my sense of the contrast there would be between me and <NAME> , if we went to the coach together .
Dispirited and anxious , long hoping that to-morrow or next week would clear my way , and long disappointed , I sadly missed the cheerful face and ready response of my friend .
' <NAME> or other , I never can come right in these discussions , ' says <NAME> , sighing and becoming resigned .
<NAME> <NAME> has made a pause to suppress a groan .
In the midst of these remarks , Mrs. <NAME> cried : ' Where ' s <NAME> ? ' No <NAME> was there ; and when they called to her , no <NAME> replied .
' There , young man ! ' said the dolls ' dressmaker .
If she wounds you , love her .
But the very genteel lady ' s <NAME> chariot being already horsed and at the inn-door , the landlord had slipped up-stairs to represent his hard case .
To work a lot of power over you and you not know it , knowing as you think yourselves , would be almost worth laying out money upon .
' Did you ? ' said <NAME> , distrustfully .
' Winkle -- Winkle ! ' shouted <NAME> , calling into the inner room .
There was nothing worth mentioning in the material world , but <NAME> , to be astonished about .
'What 's the good of telling me that ; I can hear it , ca n't I ! '
' I wonder , ' said <NAME> , stopping in the midst of a most sedate conversation with <NAME> , bearing reference to the numerous good qualities of <NAME> and his sister -- ' I wonder what all the people we pass , can see in us to make them stare so. ' ' It ' s a neat turn-out , ' replied <NAME> , with something of pride in his tone .
' Let me entreat you not to say so , <NAME> , either now , or at any future time .
I was rather on the lookout for good fortune then. " " Indeed ? " " Yes .
The doctor-seeking messenger meets the doctor halfway , coming under convoy of police .
' Then you may hand it over , <NAME> .
I have no more to say. ' ' Perhaps , ' said <NAME> , with an unusual and indefinable taunt in his air , ' you mistook my position , when you honoured me with the negotiations in which I have been engaged here ' -- with a motion of his hand towards Mrs Dombey .
Found sobbing afterwards , in own room .
" The picture has never been engraved .
But even this disinterestedness was attended with no inconsiderable cost , to my knowledge , for before <NAME> was sufficiently decorated to walk hand in hand with the professor of deportment , he had to be newly dressed , at the expense of <NAME> and her husband , from top to toe .
Immediately after which , a sprightly gentleman with a quantity of long black hair looked round a beam on the right , and said , ' Less noise there , darlings ! ' and also disappeared .
' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' my sister might -- I doen ' t say she would , but might -- find <NAME> give her a leetle trouble now-and-again .
They had won their household places long ago , and did not stand without , as she did , with a bar across the door .
' I misdoubt , ' said <NAME> , ' if there is as many as twenty left in all this place , who have any trust in the poor dear lad now. ' She said it to <NAME> , as they sat in her lodging , lighted only by the lamp at the street corner .
All my efforts are vain .
The bolts of the door were rusty , and difficult to unfasten without noise .
' Here <NAME> walks by herself , ' I thought .
<NAME> had clearly got his eye upon one of <NAME> 's niece 's sisters , for he answered that a bachelor was a wretched outcast , who had no right to express an opinion on the subject .
' As near as a toucher , ' assented <NAME> .
I am greatly , greatly , disinclined to profit by it .
" All I know of it ; and indeed I only know so much , through piecing it out for myself ; for my father always avoids it , and , even when <NAME> invited me to go there , told me no more of it than it was absolutely requisite I should understand .
Let me remember , then , what he said as to that .
What else do I remember ?
' You ' re afraid you won ' t have as long a finger in the business as you ' ve been used to have .
She sat on a chair holding his hand , and none of us went close to them .
" You will find the young man next door then .
The best judges are pleased to admire it , and the best among our townsmen own to being a little vain of it. ' All this time <NAME> had walked with his hat under his arm , and his white hair streaming .
The <NAME> then handed him separately , and with a decent interval between each supply , his washleather gloves , his thick stick , and his hat ; which latter article the Major wore with a rakish air on one side of his head , by way of toning down his remarkable visage .
' My dearest Edith -- Grangeby -- it ' s most trordinry thing , ' said <NAME> , pettishly , ' that <NAME> -- ' ' <NAME> !
Sometimes , I try to think that the time may come when I may honestly tell her this ; but it is so far off ; in such distant perspective , so many years must elapse before it comes , and when it does come ( if ever ) I shall be so unlike what I am now , and shall have so outlived my days of youth and romance -- though not , I am sure , of love for her -- that even I feel how visionary all such hopes must be , and try to crush them rudely myself , and have the pain over , rather than suffer time to wither them , and keep the disappointment in store .
The same formal politeness , the same composed deference that might as well be defiance ; the whole man the same dark , cold object , at the same distance , which nothing has ever diminished .
" I began to fear , " with timid tenderness , " as it was past the usual time , that <NAME> was not coming . "
I am not strong enough to bear him ! ' To use the cold language of the world , <NAME> rapidly improved the acquaintance of <NAME> .
' The contest , ' said <NAME> , ' shall be prolonged so long as I have health and strength , and that portion of talent with which I am gifted .
If a few thousand persons moving in <NAME> , could only go and be <NAME> , I would put my name down directly ; but as , moving in <NAME> , we can ' t be <NAME> , unfortunately -- Good morning ! ' They came down-stairs with powder before them and powder behind , the elder sister haughty and the younger sister humbled , and were shut out into unpowdered <NAME> , <NAME> .
