Now , my dear madam , I think you spoke of some clever personage .
‘ “ No , there is not , ” rejoined the guard coolly .
‘ I am grieved to hear it .
Behold the vessels coming into port !
<NAME> is shyer than before .
Day was dawning when they again emerged .
<NAME> Leicester is quite well .
He could obtain no engagement , and he wanted bread .
Ever live by cheating at play ?
‘ “ Ye were merry , daughters , ” said the monk .
I mean to complain to your husband .
‘ <NAME> left a widow .
<NAME> ’ t be alarmed , <NAME> my dear .
‘ Morals strictly attended to , though. ’ ‘ Strictly , ’ said <NAME> .
Her face was radiant with intelligence and pleasure .
‘ She is ill , then ! ’ said <NAME> .
This gentleman is Mr Twemlow. ’ The Jew turned to him and bowed .
They sat thus , until it grew late .
Ambitious projects trouble him no more .
‘ I must submit to you , <NAME> -- ’ said <NAME> .
And so _he_ goes up the postern stair .
Is it far from here ? ''
‘ Now , what would you give him ? ’ inquired my aunt .
`` Not so very long , <NAME> .
It is a eye I never knew to fail with paupers .
He had been enriching his medical attendant in the most lavish manner .
‘ Now , there ’ s an Enquiry in <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> was more cheerful than intelligible .
Mrs. Bagnet , you 'll take care of my mother , I know ? ''
And you know already that I have many extra expenses to meet just now .
He had no intention of leaving them .
`` The <NAME> of all Three shall strive within me .
‘ Sniggle and <NAME> , ’ cried the tenor .
`` Do n't I know you , <NAME> !
‘ It may be , dear Little Dorrit. ’ ‘ No .
I want to feel a hundred times more thankful than I do .
‘ Then we will have a chop here , at two .
They were very gay and careless .
I have judged for myself now , and am more than satisfied .
And you know what _their_ improvidence is , ma ’ am .
'You never had , perhaps , a certain gold locket and ring ? '
But nothing will induce me to quarrel with any one to-night .
<NAME> is money , whoever gives it .
Very quaint ! ’ said his friend .
They know him there and defer to him .
It had such a prescriptive , stiff-necked , long-established , solemn , elderly air .
The <NAME> ’ young ladies come to the <NAME> too .
You answer me before I speak , I see .
Some of his rich relations might have paid his debts or compounded for 'em .
We are very ancient , and we ought to make a good book .
you know what I mean , my dear , ' said the Jew .
‘ Our thoughts are free , of course .
You have trodden on me freely in your climbing up .
‘ -- How can you talk about their managing their little means ?
We have ever been far from wishing to obtrude ourselves on anyone .
I seldom or never thought of it before .
Little Eyes and the wolf in a conspiracy ?
`` Well , I think I may .
She ’ s the most extraordinary woman .
`` It 's dear old honest <NAME> !
It certainly was not called a small steamboat without reason .
He fell for five-and-thirty feet .
Will you allow me to retire ? ''
‘ You are <NAME> of <NAME> .
`` How did he first come by that idea , though ?
I don ’ t know what I have done , ’ panted <NAME> .
‘ But I shall confide in you , just the same , <NAME> .
It was <NAME> 's hand , and he passed it through my arm .
<NAME> buttoned his coat with a determined air .
“ You with a pleasant home ? ” said <NAME> .
And he sent his love to me , did he ?
‘ You asked me something , ’ he said then .
‘ Very well indeed , I am .
The parlour was the space behind the screen of rags .
`` My blessing on him , never !
returns the trooper , wheeling his chair to face the old man .
I had no one to advise me .
“ And I 'll tell you where from .
“ 'Nevertheless , <NAME> , my sister married .
‘ What family ? ’ ‘ The <NAME> of course , ’ rejoined <NAME> .
“ Kiss me , child of <NAME> .
‘ Just so , <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> .
There shall be no secrets from you ; you shall be by .
<NAME> <NAME> felt every moment more disposed for the ball .
‘ <NAME> , my dear Sir ! ’ rejoined <NAME> , in utter amazement .
We interchanged that confidence without shaping a syllable .
Again we lost her , and again she rose .
I assure you , most exemplary !
A mighty secret , my pretty one , no doubt !
My mother put her hands upon my lips to stop me .
I did it for the love of you .
But she seemed to be everywhere .
'There is nothing very alarming in his appearance .
`` Because I fell in love . ''
) , but I do n't settle down to constancy in other things .
And when you can do better , you will ?
‘ It ’ s like puttin ’ gas in a balloon .
What can I have to do with the name ?
<NAME> was sorry to miss our good friend Mr Sparkler to-day , Mr Merdle .
‘ She will miss it when she wakes .
'The girl 's gone mad , I think , ' replied <NAME> , savagely .
I shall be as merry as a grig among these gentry .
We journeymen must take jobs when we can get them .
“ You think so ? ” said <NAME> .
At the same time—not to deceive you—I believe I am worthy of her .
`` Let me hope a moment !
Sometimes he would ask her for herself .
‘ They are here now , ’ said <NAME> , rising and hurrying away .
‘ I am here by myself , myself .
‘ _I_ pray to Heaven it may turn out so ! ’ repeated <NAME> .
But he ’ ll soon be home for good , now .
I am pretty well known .
That very popular trust in flat things coming round !
‘ Is it , indeed ? ’ rejoined <NAME> .
What could <NAME> do ?
He can not pay something ? ” “ He has paid all , <NAME> .
‘ The house with the red door , cabmin .
‘ They brighten at the sight of you , ’ returned <NAME> .
I am going to speak upon another subject , a confidential subject , <NAME> .
May I speak out , among friends ?
‘ We are all as happy as possible ! ’ said <NAME> .
He was reconciled to what had happened , and went down again quite happy .
Official sentiments are one thing .
‘ But I say yes , ’ returned his friend .
‘ Assuredly , <NAME> is an oracle !
He can speak of nothing else .
pointing in the direction of the rag and bottle shop .
‘ You come on business , sir .
`` You do n't object to him , little woman ? ''
Mr <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Perfectly , sir , ’ returned Mr Sparkler .
croaked the Jew , in his usual voice .
retorts <NAME> with a steadfast look , but without loss of temper .
You know how sensitive I am to unkindness .
‘ And very much to be deplored it was , on all accounts !
Not such power of wind has blown for many a winter night .
‘ But , first and foremost , <NAME> , burn the box .
We don ’ t want any documents .
‘ I couldn ’ t write like that , now-a-days .
‘ Peek -- christian name ; Weeks -- surname ; good , ver good .
‘ He does not seem to see us .
Or that night , when I frowned at him ?
‘ I didn ’ t do anything in particular , ’ said <NAME> .
However , men always think they know best .
‘ Good master ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
Both of us did business with him .
Why , from you. ” “ I never told you. ” “ Told me !
He needed some such touch then .
What did you expect me to do ?
You have regularly given me up .
Also that I can accept no second or inferior position .
In this latter establishment there were two curious cases .
So they told him yes again .
So goes the wintry day outside the <NAME> mansion .
I am going there now for my lesson .
‘ No , I do not indeed , ’ replied <NAME> .
‘ You were speaking about its being a girl , ’ said <NAME> .
' I 'll run all the way , sir . '
I say 'Mighty potentate , here IS my homage !
`` Go before me and show me all those dreadful places .
The news is -- ’ ‘ <NAME> ? ’ interrupted <NAME> .
What else is so extremely charming !
‘ So he is very impressible .
The strange man said nothing but made another snort .
`` I did n't see YOU , '' says <NAME> .
‘ With the blessing of <NAME> , <NAME> , ’ returned <NAME> .
‘ I am sure I didn ’ t myself .
<NAME> <NAME> smokes with a profound meaning after this and surveys <NAME> in silence .
This tall man , <NAME> , is a rascally adventurer .
‘ But I will not allow it .
Oliver tried to reply but his tongue failed him .
That young lady was , no doubt , an acquisition to the <NAME> .
replied the <NAME> , `` do you believe in me or not ? ''
‘ So have I , ’ said the stranger .
I had no difficulty in recognizing either <NAME> or <NAME> ’ s children .
<NAME> <NAME> merely shakes the finger at her .
In came the three <NAME> , beaming and lovable .
‘ I ’ ll look in upon you to-morrow , young man .
‘ You are the next ? ’ muttered the Manager .
I have done with the red coat , believe me .
`` What has ever got your precious father then ? ''
`` On the wings of the wind , '' replied the <NAME> .
‘ Codicil among the dust ? ’ another guesses .
Has <NAME> been disturbed ?
“ <NAME> ! ” I exclaimed , in amazement .
Why , what have you got there , <NAME> ?
She ses to me she ses 'are you the boy at the inkwhich ? '
Not this world , oh , not this !
It do come in , and it do not come in .
'That is my name , ' said the old gentleman .
<NAME> becomes known to Mrs. Nickleby and <NAME> .
‘ Are you a cricketer ? ’ inquired <NAME> of the marksman .
‘ I should sleep the worse , ’ answered <NAME> , impatiently .
there is a likeness , ’ said <NAME> , after some reflection .
He looked in at the <NAME> .
`` Will you come and dine with me ? ''
A little more elbow-room is all we want here .
It were better not to know .
He has all Tulkinghorn 's , and an excellent business besides .
But I would leave the matter there .
inquired the Jew , with eagerness .
`` You know I do n't , '' said I .
‘ Let me see , ’ said the legal authority .
<NAME> is pretty well acquainted with these proceedings .
<NAME> <NAME> brings a chair and diminishes his shadow .
`` But you might know it , '' observed the gentleman .
I know it was then and there that I had it .
He followed directly , and met <NAME> on the stair .
‘ A personal discussion , <NAME> , my love ?
There is adaptability of character in <NAME> .
Debilitated cousin thinks -- country 's going -- Dayvle -- steeple-chase pace .
Have you posts of profitable pecuniary emolument ?
Another friendly demonstration towards him Mr Wegg now regularly gratified .
What those treasures are they keep so secret that the court is maddened .
THAT I have discovered beyond the possibility of doubt .
But I do mean it ! ’ retorted Kit .
I can be happier in nothing than in your happiness .
He was to be away a long , long time .
They were all about the new house .
`` Oh , <NAME> , you would never guess ! ''
How does it act ? ’ Which he was not prepared to elucidate .
'No , ' replied <NAME> , ' I would rather you remained here . '
“ 'How long , ' I asked , 'has this lasted ? '
And few people knew of it .
'Come here , you born devil !
‘ You remember the night of our first tea-drinking ? ’ said <NAME> .
You must know that I have done no good this long time .
I won ’ t be led on into a discussion .
I have never seen her yet .
‘ You are going through , sir ? ’ said the coachman .
At any rate , you know it now .
says <NAME> , opening another door and glaring in with his bull's-eye .
It is my bounden duty to you .
And now they had come to the time when they must beg their bread .
`` What is the matter with you ? ''
<NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , at the expiration of a few minutes .
repeats <NAME> with awful politeness .
`` They 'll do as they are ?
<NAME> <NAME> that their political opinions are identical .
There is the <NAME> , who is Providence to five hundred thousand men .
‘ We shall go by the stage-coach .
‘ Not what enough ? ’ said <NAME> .
You ’ d better not keep on pulling his ears , please .
'Indeed you may believe me .
`` I am much obliged to you .
No relief or security from him for a moment .
The rain fell heavily , drearily .
Always the identical same. ’ ‘ It doesn ’ t taste so .
I stopped at the last full stop to read all this over .
<NAME> <NAME> said , `` Very much so . ''
<NAME> and ruin came on me , I say .
‘ It will amuse me. ’ ‘ Oh !
'No other , take my word for it . '
It 's only me as is written to .
‘ This is strange news , ’ said <NAME> .
I beg -- nay , command ! -- that you will not pounce .
The work went on , until the noon-bell rang .
But I never will desert <NAME> .
Is it there ? ’ ‘ Here it is ! ’ said I .
The boat floated into the wharf to which it belonged .
It ’ s down my throat again and can ’ t come up .
‘ Off at once , ’ replied <NAME> .
I 'm a soldier 's wife and accustomed to travel my own way .
Yes , let us go now .
There was no harm in his trade .
Do you know what you 're doing ? '
‘ So am I , <NAME> , ’ rejoined <NAME> .
I have been in prison for threatening the solicitor .
The <NAME> is about to bow to the bar when the prisoner is presented .
I resolved that they should not know .
‘ I wish it was <NAME> , sir , ’ said <NAME> .
What matter , my dear ? ’ ‘ Mr .
`` Esther certainly does think so . ''
I asked after a good deal of hesitation .
I view it , steadily , as an investment .
But I always say that and have never doubted it .
Had he that deep-seated recondite complaint , and did any doctor find it out ?
‘ When are you relieved ? ’ asked <NAME> .
You treated me falsely , ungratefully , and cruelly .
‘ Good-night , <NAME> ! ’ returned <NAME> softly .
It was beginning to rain fast .
Is there anything else he ’ d like ?
`` I am sure THAT 'S very natural ! ''
The old lady began to rummage in her pocket for her spectacles .
‘ Always hope ; that ’ s a dear boy .
‘ They taks such as offers .
No more wishing one ’ s self dead now .
'This is not the place I went to sleep in . '
As I might have expected , he had none at all .
‘ What kind of compromise would you recommend ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
“ And so have you , sir .
‘ Yes , my good friend , ’ said my aunt .
`` My heart aches for him ; that it does ! ''
I sha n't disgrace it when the time comes . '
But get up , get up ! ''
‘ That ’ s capital ! ’ said <NAME> , giving it a kiss .
I know that this is a long voyage .
The hour had measured like most other hours .
He did n't say so before <NAME> , he only said so to me .
Appearances indicated that this establishment was a very recent institution .
That ’ s just the wery sort o ’ thing he ’ d do .
‘ <NAME> , sir , ’ said <NAME> .
It broke up the establishment .
She is a tall , dark , black-eyed , fine figure of a woman .
The old woman shook her head .
Three or four hours were not a long time after years .
Those that want to be safe , must hoist flags .
Fairly. ’ ‘ What a dreadfully conscientious fellow you are , <NAME> !
‘ <NAME> prospect , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
There is something else upon its flight besides the wind and clouds .
replied Sikes : appearing at the head of the stairs , with a candle .
<NAME> <NAME> , <NAME> , the <NAME> Guardsman !
Thus : — The time is one o ’ clock at noon .
You ’ ll be delighted with him .
“ On the contrary ; I come direct. ” “ Pardon me !
`` No , no , '' said <NAME> , `` I am in earnest .
We would all be gentlefolks together , then .
He was overjoyed to see us and dismounted with great alacrity .
I understand that we speak together in confidence .
‘ Well , I think I should .
`` But it 's all like you .
Whatever word you like best .
<NAME> says shrewdly , ‘ Oh a long time , bless you !
‘ Yes , but not the old pain .
Better for common sense , better for him , better for me .
It is a name , <NAME> , that a man is proud to recognise .
‘ Clara ! ’ said <NAME> , in her warning note .
‘ We have found a new one in that word , scout .
“ You are still on friendly terms with <NAME> ? ” “ Quite .
He didn ’ t find them , and she died not long after .
`` How did you find out that ? ''
It was a strong grapple , and a fierce struggle , arm and leg .
<NAME> <NAME> is found to be downstairs , by appointment .
I even heard it said between them , `` Shall she go ? ''
He runs up the long wooden entry and finds the trooper smoking his pipe .
‘ No warm water ! ’ exclaimed <NAME> .
<NAME> ! ’ and go out to the assault .
<NAME> , not without some grumbling , gave ninepence .
‘ I ain ’ t a cove to chuck a word away .
Give me a kiss , <NAME> .
‘ Shall we , really ? ’ returned <NAME> , indolently surprised .
‘ The counting-house , sir ? ’ I repeated .
Yet you think yourselves very fine , I dare say ! ''
`` You were always a good friend to me , '' said <NAME> .
“ <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , this is a bad business. ” Ah !
Then why don ’ t he go ?
I know all. ’ The daughter smiled incredulously .
I felt it was a time for conversation and confidence .
That ’ s a peculiarity of his .
The Study of a Loving Heart 25 .
Now , I am coming to the paper , and mark what I say .
<NAME> , <NAME> , pray ! ’ But she did not rise .
you have something to say .
Being my limbs , what does it signify ?
‘ Out with it ! ’ said <NAME> , with an arch look .
He will have his bond , my dear friend . ''
A moment afterwards they re-entered the house .
Not a dead man , I suppose . ''
‘ Oh -- you remember me , I suppose ? ’ said <NAME> .
He then returned to the punch , in the highest state of exhilaration .
Perhaps I speak with some little partiality .
To those noble qualities I can lay no claim .
‘ We intend to win everything , ’ said he .
The street was muddy , dirty , and deserted .
then it 's a panel , eh ? '
Oh yes , he was up .
‘ You plot among you to wean my heart from her .
Nothing else in it -- no , nothing , nothing !
‘ I waited for a good opportunity .
I had done it again .
It was summer-time , and lovely weather .
No , it was not my fault .
Because they were never asunder .
I am still , and I always shall be .
You were not to be found .
A word in your ear , Mrs. Nickleby .
<NAME> , come , my young cousins , begin afresh !
<NAME> , ’ he added , looking round again .
‘ I think it right to suggest it .
‘ A hundred , ’ said the little man .
If you like to come there , come there .
‘ You ask me why ! ’ returned my aunt .
‘ You see , master hadn ’ t introduced us , then .
‘ <NAME> my soul and honour that ’ s a wise remark .
I replied at my own chambers , with <NAME> .
Let us both try to forget it .
I whistled and made nothing of going .
She started -- it was only a passing dream .
and retires conscience-stricken from the presence .
Oh I know she ’ s going to bring him here !
‘ Capital ! ’ said <NAME> , putting the stakes in his pocket .
He saw her in his mind , exactly as she was .
“ <NAME> is <NAME> ? ” says a man behind him .
The room was as neat as <NAME> or my aunt .
Oh , very right indeed , ’ said <NAME> .
My darling , do n't you be afraid ! ''
You know this to be our determination .
‘ Never ! ’ was the valorous reply .
‘ Can we have beds here ? ’ inquired <NAME> , summoning the waiter .
I have walked two nights without resting .
He takes his place within the carriage , and three other gentlemen follow .
‘ Not much , I fear , ’ returned my mother .
An ’ t you one of the rest !
You mustn ’ t tell us about that , here .
I have deliberated , ever since , when and how to destroy it .
With a plunge of enjoyment , <NAME> settled himself afresh .
‘ Nothing would give me greater pleasure , ’ replied <NAME> .
But what 's done ca n't be undone .
I see Her with a child upon her bosom , who bears my name .
‘ Gentlemen , ’ returned <NAME> , ‘ do with me as you will !
<NAME> hadst no sleep last night , I can well believe .
‘ By what right I ask ? ’ ‘ By this right .
The strange sound of his voice thrilled through the whole frame of his child .
But other subjects began to lay heavy on the <NAME> ’ s mind .
replied <NAME> , with a threatening look .
He liked him for it .
`` Did you wish to see him , sir ? ''
Thank you , my dear friend , that 'll do .
‘ He played the audience out tonight .
I dare say I am a capricious fellow , <NAME> .
Then he started , and said : ‘ I beg your pardon , sir .
It was dark now , and torches were kindled .
The night and the snow came on together , and dismal enough they were .
Not the person that shall be nameless .
'Are you going up to the <NAME> , <NAME> ? '
The <NAME> soon got to be dirty and neglected .
Do you guess the reason ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , ’ the child replied .
`` Yes , '' said <NAME> , `` wild Indians .
‘ Who do you think is going to be married tomorrow ?
There were only three conditions of resemblance wanting between these Professors and those .
She got up to look at it .
Go through with it while you are about it .
“ Pretty well is no answer .
That ’ s Blood ! ” It is an actual matter of fact .
How is <NAME> ? ’ said my aunt , sharply .
said the Jew , rising with a menacing look .
And I mean always to keep among none but grown-ups till I marry .
'Bow to the board , ' said <NAME> .
He turned her full to the light , and looked at her .
Walking between her father and <NAME> , <NAME> passed into the open air .
`` Much good may it do you !
I know you too well .
Never in a debtors ' prison ?
You required a verbal explanation .
Call him Mr <NAME> .
You must put it into words , ’ he said .
I have never forgotten your wrongs and their causes .
‘ I dare not leave the house alone .
I will not hear him .
there was something else , and it ’ s gone out of my head !
B. knows a move or two , <NAME> ’ am .
I should like to know how you speed ; though , mind !
It was a cold , dark night .
‘ <NAME> ’ t you see , <NAME> ?
‘ Do not talk so , ’ said the child .
He was deadly pale ; and the whole place seemed turning round and round .
<NAME> 's entrance stopped the conversation .
‘ He is hard to me sometimes , ’ returned <NAME> .
The first we 've both got ; the second you must find us . '
‘ Thank you , ’ said the doctor , ‘ thank you .
He crosses with her and begs .
I never shall forget that night .
‘ His impudence , Mr <NAME> ! ’ said <NAME> , tossing her head .
He is happy , and in heaven now .
‘ Not much , my dear , ’ returned the schoolmaster .
A penny loaf was all they had had that day .
'He seems in high spirits and happy , ' she said , at length .
I read in it , that I was appointed to do these things .
<NAME> , appearing much gratified thereby , saluted him cordially .
repeated <NAME> as if she were afraid of the name .
Be sure you always speak well of father .
I will not repeat what I said to <NAME> .
'This is great happiness to me , great happiness .
His favourite and faithful housekeeper stands at his bedside .
Here the rain began to fall so heavily , that it roused him .
Who the devil is he ?
`` Quite right , and quite true . ''
‘ Mr <NAME> ? ’ inquired the suitor .
There is my fidelity to my dear boy after death .
It rained now , in a sheet of water .
‘ <NAME> was not deceiving me .
He turned it off into a yawn , but it began as a yell .
‘ No offence to anybody , <NAME> .
You may be more right there .
She ’ d do her any kindness in private .
Will you try him , <NAME> ?
‘ How did this happen ? ’ he cried , looking wildly about him .
His hand shakes , he is nervous , and it falls off .
'Give him a little air ! '
We want no babies here , ’ said <NAME> recklessly .
‘ Have you ever been there ? ’ ‘ No. ’ ‘ Oh !
‘ How he would bother the commissioners !
‘ Shall I e ’ er forget it , mun ? ’ replied <NAME> .
I demand no more than the opportunity to do so without delay .
He ’ s as welcome as flowers in May , or coals at <NAME> .
In those times this young lady was a mere child .
To think that I should be drinking his very rum !
'She 'll take the luggage upstairs the while .
This was delightful , and gladdening to the heart of <NAME> .
Not an instant , my dears ! '
But I know she 's got it .
We are going to walk with you .
cries <NAME> in a shrill loud voice .
I would not forward it , unless I feared the worst . '
You feel quite at home here again , I dare say ?
<NAME> recked Mr Podsnap of the traps and toils besetting his <NAME> .
'You were not awake an hour ago ? '
He may sleep on now .
“ No it does n't ; I assure you it does n't .
I was very young , and had no adviser .
It was the <NAME> , you know .
I don ’ t mean to be reproachful either .
Her gleesome voice and merry laugh were the sweetest music of their home .
Yet , what was to be done ?
Ugly , misshapen , peevish , ill-conditioned , ragged , dirty -- but beloved !
<NAME> candles , ' replied Mrs. Corney , slightly returning the pressure .
But he let it go , and it closed with a loud noise .
He fervently replied that indeed indeed they would have been .
They had run from drunkards .
`` Do you wish to hold any conversation with me in private ? ''
She looked up in <NAME> ’ s face , and smiled through her tears .
The lady turned aside her head .
If he mean this ironically , it may be truer than he thinks .
'Do n't scruple to answer freely , man .
I thank you for disclosing your schemes , which I am now prepared for .
Within a few minutes , <NAME> stood whispering at his side .
'Very curious , indeed , ' observed the doctor .
Then I went to bed too .
cried a voice from below , in reply to a whistle from the Dodger .
My little woman has a very active mind , sir . ''
But not to-day is <NAME> so occupied .
She did not say so , however , as she gave him her hand .
Do n't let my brother know . ''
Take her away , my dear <NAME> .
You mean , do I feel as if I were settling down ? ''
<NAME> encouraged herself with a final twitch , and went in .
The request was no sooner preferred , than granted .
“ And you get me wittles. ” He tilted me again .
Thus in the case of <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> , ’ echoed <NAME> ; and the ceremony of introduction was complete .
Withers believed she was in her own room .
‘ I doen ’ t know , sir , ’ he replied .
But I mean a cost .
I am so happy with him .
‘ What is a proctor , <NAME> ? ’ said I .
It will not be true .
‘ No , <NAME> ; I have felt it before .
<NAME> came near me until late at night .
'He wo n't stir till it 's all safe .
You have now a -- hum -- a great position to support .
‘ No , ’ said Mr Dombey , with magnificent indifference .
<NAME> had received a similar letter and had made a similar response .
with which the <NAME> concluded .
Your conduct has always been of the most delicate and obliging description .
‘ Save the man ! ’ cried <NAME> .
Oliver did as he was desired .
‘ I am sorry for that .
It has n't declared anything in heaven knows how many years . ''
The Secretary inquired on what terms ?
‘ I can not walk tonight , <NAME> , ’ returned <NAME> , hurriedly .
The great point of our agreement is yet to come .
I also desire to live in amity with my professional brethren .
None of your live languages for <NAME> .
'You keep ready , and leave the rest to me . '
‘ This very night , sir , ’ replied <NAME> .
You shall have the books . '
The mother had moaned in her sleep and moved .
Out-of-the-way villages there , they tell me .
‘ This here ’ s old <NAME> ’ s nevy Wal ’ r .
“ Hear this ! ” he helplessly exclaimed to the elements .
‘ I will restore to you what I have withheld from you .
It is my turn again , <NAME> .
I had not been conscious of it .
He is easily moved to tears ; is gentle , submissive , and broken-spirited .
<NAME> looked down in hers , and smiled through his .
<NAME> 's finishing the sentence restores her to favour .
He was buried in <NAME> , at the church of <NAME> Pancras-in-the-Fields .
<NAME> thought it was , too , but he held his peace .
The bed itself was covered with an old patch-work counterpane .
‘ Who says man and wife are bad company ?
<NAME> to earth , ashes to ashes , dust to dust !
‘ What is the matter with the men !
The man shook his fist , as he uttered these words incoherently .
The day came , but not the bridegroom .
The last was a S , -- Swubble , I named him .
`` I do n't know that , sir ! ''
I don ’ t want a wife and family .
We had now got into the month of March .
These kisses for a blessing on your head !
“ Have you brought his indentures with you ? ” asked <NAME> .
Coax him to use his influence with the Jew .
‘ Widders , <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> , slightly changing colour .
`` I share those feelings , '' he returned .
This is a secret expedition .
I was speaking of <NAME> .
The apprentices were the queerest little people .
Give me your nose sir ! ’ ‘ No !
‘ Oh , so tranquil ! ’ cried the little creature , smiling .
Are you ready to come , my dear friend ? ''
She 'll never die quiet till you come , mistress . '
Does he send clothes on in advance of him ?
However probable it was to him , she had heard of no such thing .
Make up your mind quick , <NAME> .
But it came about in this way .
The unusual apparition was followed by another bonnet .
Is the man born yet , is the spade wrought yet ?
‘ What do you think of this request , <NAME> ? ’ murmured <NAME> .
‘ Can you one ? ’ inquired the old lady .
The man who lay on the ledge of the grating was even chilled .
Mrs MacStinger in retort , looked at her all over .
‘ Death of my soul ! ’ he exclaimed .
Mr <NAME> , I am not quite a stranger here .
`` That 's the message , '' observes <NAME> .
`` For there <NAME> chords , Jobling -- '' <NAME> begs pardon again .
`` Nineteen , '' repeats my Lady thoughtfully .
What is it you are not ?
'It 's a long time , ' said <NAME> .
‘ I know her well. ’ ‘ Look at the broken scull .
<NAME> <NAME> takes the chair , and three members of <NAME> are positively coming .
Now tell me , my love .
‘ It is so , ’ the Secretary admitted .
Why do you listen ? ’ asked the lady .
We now turned into another narrow street .
I dare say he don ’ t .
‘ Come , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Who is it ? ’ cried <NAME> again .
‘ Yes , <NAME> , and supper , ’ added <NAME> .
The object of this new liking was not among his myrmidons .
Oh , my fellow-countrymen , what warning but this did I give you ?
Now you know me , do n't you ? ''
A wave as of triumph ?
`` I have got it here , sir . ''
he asks in an insinuating tone .
'So , you 're going on to <NAME> , are you ? '
<NAME> was the better for it , or thought of being so .
That is his employer , gentlemen .
We had other visitors besides <NAME> .
Here are the other passengers .
‘ Glad to hear it , <NAME> .
'Wait quietly only one instant , while I speak to aunt . '
And reassured , `` Since that 's the case -- '' `` Yes !
And what ’ s this in dancing-shoes ?
“ I want to know no more than I know .
<NAME> and his daughter were sitting there alone .
<NAME> said he did n't believe there ever was such a goose cooked .
<NAME> <NAME> was excited and indignant .
There was a heap of old feathery wood-ashes on the hearth .
I have no design whatever .
The confidences of lovely women are not to be slighted .
I think we had better talk about this , really , <NAME> .
`` I 've had the pleasure of seeing you before .
His broad chest heaves with pleasure .
Now I know ye did .
What could it do , his boy had asked him .
This is my frugal breakfast .
‘ <NAME> , ’ rejoined Mrs. Sparsit , ‘ say no more .
Am I never to hear the last of this ?
He never looked so serene as he did then .
Suddenly , he took the desperate resolution to going back to <NAME> .
His head was sunk upon his bosom ; and he slumbered again .
Let 'em knock me well about the head .
'Put your head out of the winder , ' replied <NAME> .
I tell this lightly , but it was no light thing to me .
He ’ s no public offender , bless you , now !
<NAME> at her , with her pretty pale face and her cold hands .
Veneering pervades the legislative lobbies , intent upon entrapping his fellow-legislators to dinner .
I asked him how he liked his profession .
said <NAME> , filled with dismal thoughts .
He knew that she would not insist upon his leaving her .
We see <NAME> in a nose , and we know it .
Is there anything you want that would lessen the hardship of this confinement ? ''
You are more beautiful in anger than in repose .
Down <NAME> and <NAME> can follow if they please .
Her patience is unexhausted by hours .
You must endeavour , sir , to change it .
He has a very knowing look , but that he always has .
But I ’ ll provide for her !
He became aware of that again .
<NAME> , I am going to <NAME> . '
That I am greatly dissatisfied with it .
‘ Only me , <NAME> , ’ replied a woman ’ s voice .
This dialogue made us all uneasy , and me very uneasy .
All that can be imparted , he can impart .
I ’ m glad your eyes are red with crying .
‘ Not about money , I hope ?
Let him take that well to heart , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ One thing more , ’ he said .
cries Mrs. Snagsby from the stairs .
`` You do , '' she said very shortly .
‘ Ah , <NAME> ! ’ said <NAME> , with a sigh .
`` Possession is nothing to me .
How to turn a penny .
This is merely in passing .
Are they , though ? ’ she said .
‘ Let them open the door .
All over , that is to say , for the time being .
God forgive this wretched man ! '
‘ Reg ’ lar good land that , ’ interposed another fat man .
“ Pretty witness , ” he muttered , looking down into his glass .
The place in <NAME> is all alive .
I ’ m as good a man as you , and better .
‘ I will not hesitate any longer , Mr Wrayburn .
' I defy you to do it ! '
to the sheet , and gently lifted it away .
‘ I know it , to my disappointment and regret .
<NAME> <NAME> laughed , and said oh yes , he believed so .
The old man overheard , and laughed .
<NAME> ? ’ ‘ Feeder , ’ returned Mr Toots .
People are always calling other people something .
The rosy children opposite run past with hoops .
Though the just Heaven knows that I am innocent of any .
‘ Quite a matter of form .
still fearfully disconcerted by Mrs. <NAME> 's eye .
In point of fact , we were playing at <NAME> in the <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> darted a look of contempt , which might have withered an anchor .
`` How do you do , <NAME> ?
Make it your own time .
My hopes and fears are both fulfilled to-night .
‘ Then he has no business to do it , ’ said <NAME> .
If you have come here to thank me , it was not necessary .
But you are such a little oddity !
This device I executed successfully .
My duty prosperously ended , all between us is ended . ''
<NAME> is it , besides fish , as they sometimes ketches in rivers ?
That matter I place in your hands .
When you say THEY say , what do you mean ?
I remember almost hoping that some better change was possible within me .
‘ ’ Cept <NAME> ’ s <NAME> , ’ observed the fat man solemnly .
<NAME> Leicester writes upon the slate .
‘ <NAME> ! ’ cried <NAME> , rising too .
But the night covered it , and no one knew .
May it soon terminate happily !
You had better go first with <NAME> , <NAME> .
I have always lived quiet , and secret , <NAME> , my dear .
cried <NAME> , sinking on her knees beside it .
In the name of -- of brimstone , why ? ''
What are you melting vith now ?
It ’ s better to understand these things at once .
‘ He has never said a word to me about it .
He has just passed out under the gateway .
A double 1 -- all , everything -- a cobbler ’ s weapon .
‘ I am improving my legal knowledge , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
I am resolute and immoveable .
`` He must have a profession ; he must make some choice for himself .
It was a spectre in his house , and haunted him night and day .
'Where can he have come from ! '
‘ Why not ? ’ ‘ To be sure ! ’ said <NAME> .
There must be no will but his .
They were always 'My husband , my father , and my brother !
The birds began to stir and chirp .
<NAME> <NAME> 's brother conducted the negotiation .
Will you go my way with me , when it is quite dark ?
For their two faces were alone with the other flowers .
She stood for some moments looking round the room .
Does that come next ? ’ asked <NAME> with a look of close attention .
Dedicated to the different hotels in this city. ’ There are three principal theatres .
God , how the sun poured down upon the very spot !
‘ Open the door. ’ ‘ Wait one instant , ’ said <NAME> .
`` I do n't understand what you mean , '' said I , wondering .
' I have been prompt enough this time .
‘ But there shall not be an end of it .
But none on my accounts , ’ said <NAME> .
The largest fidelity to a trust was the life-blood of the man .
thankee hearty , for this visit !
Also , within doors , Mr Inspector was at his studies as of yore .
<NAME> waved his hand in assent , and went his way .
‘ I will ascertain that myself without loss of time , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> , I know very well that your family is far above mine .
The <NAME> looked on her , henceforth , as steadfastly as she on him .
`` Just so , '' observes the stationer with his confirmatory cough .
`` Never , little woman , '' he replied .
And Mrs. Micawber was just the same .
“ If you had been born such , would you have been here now ?
But that was nothing to this .
I can not consent to get up , in this state of uncertainty .
‘ You _shall _make it , sir , ’ said the grave man .
I will inquire myself in the morning .
`` 'T is only a letter of instructions , sir .
‘ “ It was , ” cried the elder lady , weeping bitterly .
Most people know what sort of places commercial rooms usually are .
Let me fill your glass .
‘ Consequently , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ Mr .
You know what Ma is , <NAME> , '' she returned .
You will be good enough to bring me no reply .
I heard the noise of the feet behind , and redoubled my speed .
She used to feed them , <NAME> .
He never converses when not professionally consulted .
He lies there , dressed in shirt and trousers , with bare feet .
The determined reticence of <NAME> , however , was not to be so approached .
I said `` Not at all ! ''
`` Nor ever will be , '' says my Lady .
‘ Finish your dinner , and walk out with me .
He faintly wipes his forehead with his handkerchief and gasps .
He is , as it were suddenly , grown very old .
She watched and waited months for a seamstress .
‘ It ’ s all in training , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Is it any harm ? ’ asked <NAME> , smiling .
She doesn ’ t seem so desolate .
<NAME> had fallen on him in its place .
‘ <NAME> ! ’ exclaimed the <NAME> , ‘ let go , will you ?
It is immensely received in turf-circles .
She was its very light and life .
‘ You ’ re a steady <NAME> , and I was not mistaken .
<NAME> <NAME> replied in the affirmative .
Did n't he owe us immense sums , all round ?
‘ What news have you brought me ?
<NAME> in the parlour .
His insolence of self-importance dilated as he saw this alteration in her .
I was three-and-twenty years of age .
Did you ever buy anything of him ? ’ With piercing eagerness .
At all events , he hoped so , and therefore tried to believe it .
Supposing his head had been held down under water for a while .
After that , love , bliss and rapture ; rapture , love and bliss .
‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , very seriously .
The agony on the shore increased .
‘ I -- ha -- thought it was <NAME> ! ’ said Mr Dorrit .
No one was stirring in the house .
You know that you made my life unhappy by your pursuit of me .
On the day of judgment .
And God knows I do ! ” echoed Biddy .
‘ Good day , sir , ’ said my aunt , ‘ and good-bye !
I have been called in , ’ he replied .
‘ What will you take , sir ?
‘ <NAME> , ’ he said , detaining it in his .
No , sir , ’ said Mr Venus .
She had never been so handsome , in his eyes .
It will depend on you , and it could depend on no better man .
‘ And what was it like ? ’ inquires Veneering .
‘ Yes , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ to <NAME> .
A final word before I go .
I hope there may turn out to be no why not .
As it was , I thought as little of it as I might .
`` I have come to bring you home , dear brother ! ''
One day she failed to come , for the first time .
He did n't precisely remember where it was .
‘ A little humouring of <NAME> ’ s points !
`` But she had a large heart ! ''
I am only your friend and distant kinsman .
‘ It includes it : yes , ’ said Mr Dombey .
I did not come back , and they have passed unspoiled into my place .
It was the very next night .
Some were standing ; some seated .
Do not give way so bitterly , dear friend , don ’ t .
Is that <NAME> knowledge of life ?
A moment afterwards , he was as fawning and as humble as ever .
‘ <NAME> ’ t call me by that name !
‘ Yes , ’ replied a couple of shrill voices .
Also to standby , as much as possible .
Greatly interested in his proceedings , Mr <NAME> observed him closely .
Who did it ? ’ ‘ It is only I , <NAME> .
‘ Shut the door , sir ! ’ said Mr Boffin .
It made no difference in me .
' I took it for you , <NAME> , dear , ' rejoined <NAME> .
`` Seven years dead , '' mused <NAME> .
‘ I never heard of such a thing .
The <NAME> is produced , but is not at all near the thing .
“ All things have worked together as they have fallen out .
<NAME> had done the deed , and entrapped her father .
`` Do as much by me in return . ''
Mrs Pipchin herself is next handed in , and grimly takes her seat .
She has been expressing her anxiety that you should return in time .
Will you return with me and show him that you already know it ?
<NAME> will come in , but none can help .
cried <NAME> ; 'how kind of you to say so ! '
I am quite an Infidel about it , and shall never be converted .
`` Oh , not so bad as me , '' says Jo .
‘ Put the bottle by with the rest , ’ said <NAME> .
Say you are sure before I go away , <NAME> ? ''
‘ “ Leave the lamp , ” said the baron .
His body was much bent , and his face was wrinkled and yellow .
But it was not always thus with Mr Chick .
<NAME> ? ’ <NAME> stole a look at the inquirer .
'It is so pretty , ' replied <NAME> .
But he was great of soul .
That ai n't like being worn out .
‘ It is <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
The <NAME> ’ s was a mighty fine house , fronting the sea .
<NAME> way I turn , I am undone .
She had such an exquisite little nosegay in her hand .
<NAME> <NAME> was the first master , and superior to <NAME> .
‘ I should like to see his poem , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ All the symptoms aggerawated , ’ replied <NAME> , shaking his head .
Perhaps fifty times as good .
To my dear boy ? ’ ‘ Dear ! ’ repeated <NAME> .
There was a melancholy wind , and the marshes were very dismal .
Sometimes the broken reply was , “ Wait !
<NAME> tell me about him !
At first he remained stock still ; then hurried after her .
‘ I am extremely happy to hear it .
‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , nodding his head .
For some moments not a word was spoken .
‘ Then you won ’ t have none tomorrow .
There were twenty churches close together , clamouring for people to come in .
<NAME> , notoriety , is the thing .
And nothing can be more laudable .
‘ Not the slightest fear , <NAME> , ’ interposed the hostler .
I call them the Wards in <NAME> .
They passed the day in the country , and the <NAME> was quite restored .
asked the old lady , after a pause .
I know I am affectionate .
I haven ’ t always occupied my present station of life .
‘ What names , sir ? ’ said the man at the door .
This time he does touch her with his outstretched hand .
A bird of the air ?
What more the letter told me needs not to be repeated here .
What a companion you were ! ’ ‘ Companion ?
When the time drew near for retiring , <NAME> took a glass of water .
What a novel illustration of the tender laws of <NAME> !
It was succeeded by a moment ’ s pause .
Come in ! ” and the <NAME> presented himself .
He was thought to have gone , but he was hiding .
exclaimed <NAME> , turning a look of excessive surprise on his companion .
`` He is very weak , '' said the trooper in a low voice .
It 's my old girl that advises .
‘ You are fairly in for it , ’ said the jolly host .
Sincerely , honestly , indeed , <NAME> , I never thought so , before .
cries Mrs. Bagnet , looking at him curiously .
<NAME> and excitement extend further yet , and take a wider range .
It certainly did seem that the whelp yielded to this influence .
“ Clearly plots , ” said <NAME> .
I can desire no more .
‘ I have no patience ’ ( which indeed was the truth ) .
‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
No line was indicated by any contrivance , but she wrote straight and freely .
I ses 'yes ' I ses .
How else COULD he be disappointed ?
The fulfilment of the second has not yet arrived .
<NAME> is a Copious Language , and Trying to <NAME> .
The search continued for five days .
I would tell him before breakfast .
For how does it stand ?
A pleasant journey to you .
There was nothing of high mark in this .
`` My amiable child , '' murmured <NAME> , adjusting his cravat .
‘ Aha ! ’ said the fat boy .
Now send me out feet foremost ! ' ''
‘ What is the matter ? ’ exclaimed <NAME> , running to support her .
The bookcase , glazed and locked , repudiated all familiarities .
`` Look here , '' says <NAME> , recoiling .
And this is his wife , Mrs .
You do n't know how well ! ''
'The reason of all this , ' replied <NAME> .
‘ From <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> .
They ran to the window , downstairs , and into the street .
Do nothing for me ; that ’ s all .
She hired a crossing-sweeping boy to show it her .
He was a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before .
Really I didn ’ t know that I had .
He had repeatedly said he would have <NAME> ’ s life .
‘ You have done me an unmerited service .
And the parlour couldn ’ t bear straighter either .
He was always foremost among them .
‘ This is unfortunate , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ I have put the words close to my heart .
<NAME> , in its best sense , was for me no more .
I hope he does , I am sure . ''
I WILL see her when I please .
'Oh , you little un-grate-ful , mur-de-rous , hor-rid villain ! '
That was their meeting , their conversation , and their parting .
He can ’ t help his likings and dislikings , perhaps .
‘ By no means , ’ said <NAME> .
`` My son , '' said he , `` it 's two o'clock .
‘ I expect him every instant , sir , ’ said <NAME> .
“ Is he changed ? ” <NAME> asked her .
‘ Again I think I may say , that ’ s not impossible .
“ How do I know it , <NAME> ?
`` Your servant , gentlemen ; I 've been dozing .
he said , laying the bundle on the table .
<NAME> , you old man , grey .
<NAME> bowed his acknowledgments , and was unfeignedly glad to see the cloth laid .
Then I will tell you why .
`` My instructions are that this boy is to move on . ''
But as yet , the neighbourhood was shy to own the <NAME> .
<NAME> thou know thot ? ’ ‘ Oh , ah !
Many people are singularly like each other .
I watched him when you were laying on to little Bolder this afternoon .
‘ Very well , ’ said Mrs. Micawber .
I saw you looking at it yesterday .
I have the honour to attend court regularly .
<NAME> is the wild idea that flutters through her mind .
But Mr Tite <NAME> was a buttoned-up man , and consequently a weighty one .
The life is more than she can bear .
A woman more angry , passionate , reckless , and revengeful never lived .
Not bad quarters , either , '' says <NAME> , looking round again .
‘ Have you many scholars , sir ? ’ she asked .
<NAME> , but almost as dismal .
‘ We can never be too cautious , ’ said Mr Brass .
Should the <NAME> have refused the note ?
‘ <NAME> ! ’ said <NAME> , suddenly turning to him .
That was a fatal blow .
Is there any light a-comin ? ''
In a little while he came .
<NAME> was delighted to hear him express the opinion .
There was life , and no more .
I think -- but I really can ’ t say , sir .
‘ No vay at all ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
`` You do n't mean that , I am sure ? ''
And there would be no Circuit to go .
And drew a long breath .
Of course I was in love with little Em ’ ly .
‘ “ You will never leave me , ” murmured the young lady .
`` You do n't mean -- '' <NAME> begins .
He is much too deep for me .
She looked at me , with some fluttering wonder in her face .
‘ YOUR varnish is fading. ’ Mrs <NAME> descended and went in .
He looked back when he had got the street-door open .
‘ The noose , sir ? ’ retorted <NAME> .
Manners fit for a crown !
Those interests are now paramount in this office .
Shall I tell you on what accusation ?
<NAME> , after hesitating an instant , complied .
And she is , no doubt .
To this manoeuvre he accordingly resorted .
‘ There was a girl called <NAME> .
I hardly know what to liken them to , or how to describe them .
‘ <NAME> early , no ! ’ replied <NAME> .
Will you grant me time -- any length of time ?
At that instant -- ‘ Little <NAME> ! ’ cried the voice behind him .
His first impression was confirmed .
Who ’ s got to say anything agin it ?
The other may be taste ; but this is reason .
Back again it stole to the window -- then turned its head towards her .
Come the roll of wheels and a violent ringing at the bell .
I never was so much afraid of anyone .
If his wife was present , she would throw oil upon the waters .
What need to say that ?
‘ Then this garden , ’ resumed <NAME> .
‘ “ Disband them ! ” cried the baron , in amazement .
She ’ s your master ’ s wife , ’ returned the old woman .
His employer would see to that , sir .
The cart had very nearly given up , but labours on a little more .
Mr <NAME> shrugged his shoulders , and <NAME> sat rigid .
'To be sure it would , my dear , ' replied the Jew .
You have had more than two guineas from me , already .
‘ Putting both your hands afore your face too ! ’ she went on .
Live and let live , we say to them .
`` With the greatest pleasure , sir ! ''
Will you let me give it you ?
‘ This matter is growing alarming , ’ reasoned <NAME> with himself .
'Bless their dear little hearts ! '
He threw himself upon the chair .
Never any other name. ’ ( It was she who whispered it . )
Just what you used to be , now I look at you !
<NAME> requires that he should gain by marriage .
Oh , we may give him joy !
No muffling up in furs and broadcloth kept it out .
`` Say what you have got to say ! ''
Personally ! ’ repeated <NAME> , in an impatient manner .
We will say that he was unexpectedly found at his forge again .
The lounger had lounged out of view , and <NAME> and <NAME> were gone .
<NAME> will surely not deny to <NAME> what it concedes to the butterflies ! ''
<NAME> suggests the law list .
`` Let it go to the four winds for to-night .
A calculated , cast up , balanced , and proved house .
But enough of him , and of all the rest of them .
‘ Is it bright enough now ? ’ said <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> ! ’ said the old man fondling with her hair .
‘ I persuaded him to take a walk this morning .
growled Coavinses with an appearance of strong resentment .
Neither of us would do .
'Call a coach , somebody , pray .
‘ I am astonished to hear this news , ’ said <NAME> .
The doctor appeared much of the same opinion himself .
He is the most intolerable scoundrel on the face of the earth .
But for no money ! -- Bosh ! ’ What does <NAME> say ?
It will warm your heart .
He has a motive , and of course his motive is a dark motive .
I 'm more cumfbler nor you ca n't think .
You needn ’ t break with him altogether , but leave him .
says the good old man .
None of your plots against me ; I ’ ll counterplot you !
So it is , but it ’ s very clean .
‘ No , sir , ’ said the other , flushed and fierce .
And makes an imploring moan .
This shall be made known .
I thank you with all my heart .
<NAME> nose , but no balustrades .
“ It will take a little time .
<NAME> <NAME> nodded to us , who were only waiting for the signal .
But another and different kind of disquietude kept them waking too .
“ Yes , ” said he , nodding in the direction .
‘ Not to make amends ? ’ insinuated Mr Boffin .
‘ Well , child , ’ said my aunt , when I went downstairs .
In all other respects you are comfortably bestowed .
So long , so bare , so blank .
‘ Gentlemen , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ you are welcome .
I left him climbing to the window , and I came to tell you .
‘ Let me have no drunken fooling here .
I knew it from himself .
The city had entirely vanished .
I think that 's all I can give you to know him by .
I was told I was an orphan .
This knapsack is new , and he bought it in the <NAME> yesterday .
We were all to meet in the old boathouse that night .
Nothing of the kind here , sir .
Perhaps I am , ’ sighed the first-floor lodger .
‘ You are quite right , ’ said <NAME> aloud , with affected composure .
“ Dear me ! ” said <NAME> , <NAME> .
<NAME> to her , as congenial melody , “ Evening Bells ” .
The same <NAME> , with the same luck .
They are rare , but not at an end. ’ ‘ Mr Clennam ?
you ’ ll think very differently in another five minutes , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ What ’ s the office ? ’ replied that gentleman from his couch .
“ He went out before I went off .
The very barristers ’ wigs are ill-powdered , and their curls lack crispness .
She goes down without answering or looking behind her .
`` Thank you ; like you , like you , '' said <NAME> .
But ! -- no person can tell me nothing of him , <NAME> .
It was late -- past eleven o ’ clock .
‘ What do you say ? ’ A watchful pause .
Two distinct knocks , sir , will produce the slavey at any time .
<NAME> gate did you come to ? ” I told him .
I shall never be better than I am .
'Oliver , ' cried <NAME> , beckoning to him .
‘ I ’ ll dance with the widow , ’ said the stranger .
No one could , if I did not .
Upon my honour , you have no conception what my feelings are .
what ’ s the matter ? ’ said Mrs. Cluppins .
We said yes , as she seemed to expect us to say so .
`` The bank , the factory , or the house ? ''
He took himself to <NAME> , but not to P. J. T. and <NAME> .
`` Are he and the pretty girl engaged , Mr .
I have not an idea how much .
It is likely to be noticed .
I turned my head aside , and it was gone .
and is laid hands on -- and there 's nothin ' !
I felt as if the room had chilled me .
‘ We came , ’ repeated Mrs. Micawber , ‘ and saw the <NAME> .
My father was <NAME> -- <NAME> de <NAME> .
You can hardly make the best of me if I do n't .
‘ What ’ s this ! ’ said <NAME> , in a whisper .
I told <NAME> when he first come home to stand up against you .
A dwelling where a fire has been .
no ! ’ cried <NAME> , clasping her hands together .
I believe there never was anybody with such an imperturbable countenance when she chose .
She said , after a pause , in no place long .
Though why this should concern you so much , I do n't know . ''
It makes me cold to remember them .
`` Pray tell us the story , '' says <NAME> in a half whisper .
`` Let us see him here and have done with it .
Am I in love again ?
<NAME> see him when you get there .
what then ? ’ muttered <NAME> .
`` Oh , dear , you are too modest .
You might as well flop as meditate .
She was a good , good woman !
But how do I know if he lies ?
His horse had slipped , and he had been thrown .
They were assembled in <NAME> ’ s room .
Yes ; playing cribbage with herself at the table .
`` You said that before , my dear <NAME> . ''
`` I never heard of such a thing !
He had taken these lists from the drawer of the prisoner 's desk .
‘ Now , be a good-tempered Eddy , and pretend .
She was determined to have his arm , and the <NAME> ’ s too .
‘ Yes , I should think so !
<NAME> obeyed , and followed his master on his professional mission .
Do me the favour to step into my bedroom .
We ’ ve done so before now .
‘ I don ’ t like this. ’ ‘ Nor I ’ said <NAME> .
‘ I am sure I am willing she should go .
'He ca n't be coming here .
`` I do not deserve your high praise .
<NAME> , my dear , ’ interposed Mrs. Wititterly .
`` You ca n't recommend anything for the boy , I suppose ? ''
‘ My sister , ’ said <NAME> , presenting her .
‘ No , no , my love ! ’ said <NAME> .
`` It 's one of our law terms , miss .
`` Has she been very ill ? ''
Have you any apartments available , ma ’ am ? ’ ‘ Mr .
inquired <NAME> , after another pause .
‘ You must remember that my poor fellow has always been accustomed to expectations .
I felt her trembling more .
I am afraid he is dead now .
it is at the present moment in high flavour .
You are right , young man .
Under one of these latter , <NAME> ’ s companion disappeared .
I would n't take ten thousand guineas for that bird .
' I tried to get it down , ' rejoined the other .
`` <NAME> , <NAME> , '' says the trooper , sitting on the table .
[ Footnote : Or were virtually , then . ]
To that I have pledged myself .
I am to attend to your interests .
No hurry ; if you are not , I can wait .
‘ Far more , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Do you want to spend anything now ? ’ he asked me .
He said to the world , `` Go your several ways in peace !
Ask me what you will. ’ ‘ I am coming to it .
<NAME> and the youngest <NAME> can sit between me and the guard .
and know me better , man ! ''
Why SHOULD I go there ?
Perish the daring thought that any smaller creation should come between !
I had heard of him from my stationer -- Snagsby of <NAME> 's Court .
These , over and above <NAME> , were the mourners at the lowly grave .
‘ Now then , let ’ s have a talk .
I shall owe you , you do n't know how much .
`` <NAME> told me -- '' He falters .
Specially to introduce <NAME> , <NAME> .
‘ And what is more , <NAME> -- ’ said my aunt .
I truly love and honour you .
He was interesting , was n't he ?
How will he stand in the <NAME> ?
‘ <NAME> knew one of them miss fire before .
The other is a <NAME> of Reformation for <NAME> .
Those are Minders. ’ ‘ Minders ? ’ the Secretary repeated .
And look at that poor unfortunate child !
‘ Whose doing is this ? ’ said <NAME> .
'Not a word now , ' said the Jew , descending the stairs .
Not to your ladyship 's knowledge , perhaps ?
`` The facts bearing on that inquiry .
`` You were talking about nothing else in the gig . ''
‘ You are surprised , ’ said <NAME> .
'You want for nothing , I 'm sure . '
So it happens that the sexton ’ s spade gets worn and battered .
It was tastefully though economically furnished , and very neatly arranged .
<NAME> 's <NAME> bothered him exceedingly .
‘ Oh ‘ Tilda ! ’ ‘ Hush ! ’ said ‘ Tilda .
I 've been lady 's maid to a good many before now .
Never more at <NAME> , <NAME> your Thomas take a spell !
‘ You are its mistress now .
Who brought her father to life ? ” “ Oh !
The party came to the hotel .
Listen to the true one .
I have already thought of that , and taken my measures .
‘ Out of my brother ’ s way ?
The education of such a young gentleman must not be delayed .
It was the same persecutor that had followed him before .
`` I can give no such assurance , <NAME> .
<NAME> , I give you joy , my boy .
Now you know that ’ s infernal clever !
I did write about it , and never got an answer .
Mrs <NAME> ’ s grey eye scanned his thoughtful face .
After gazing at her in silence , <NAME> turned to <NAME> .
That ’ s just his character , ’ said I .
‘ Good-night , <NAME> , ’ said the <NAME> .
Why , not much has been done ; not much .
`` Do you mean to let her go in that way ? ''
‘ It ’ s a shame , ’ said the bodyguard reproachfully .
‘ I humbly beg your forgiveness , godmother .
Put it to the proof .
`` No , <NAME> , not by any means . ''
O , what a resounding chord !
So I tell you what .
<NAME> your father in the same way of life as yourself ? ''
<NAME> stooped below the shutters , and <NAME> heard the sound of a bell .
‘ Upon my soul , I don ’ t know what to say .
Him as come down in the country with Mr .
“ I 'll redeem it at once .
‘ Say yes , ’ Wegg naturally urges .
‘ He walked down the hill , and through the village .
‘ A very ill-advised and feverish proceeding this , I am sure .
Noo then , where be ’ est thou coomin ’ to ?
My Aunt Makes up Her Mind About <NAME> .
`` My dear friend , he is a lawyer , and a famous one .
He ’ s a most remarkable man -- so extremely whimsical !
We have gone into them , and he has not .
‘ I ’ m one of the masters at <NAME> , ’ he said .
`` Do you intend to remain in the house any time ?
He cowered down upon his stone bed , and thought of the past .
`` I think he likes me a little , my Lady . ''
I can not say , however , that it is your fault .
I have heard about it , <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> , darling , ’ interposed his wife .
A man who could never sufficiently vaunt himself a self-made man .
It subsided as quickly as it had been roused .
Look round you , my dear , and consider .
That ’ s how she know ’ d it .
I have never accused him . ''
I have often seen my mother try it , and it seemingly refreshed her .
<NAME> <NAME> ’ s boat was perfect .
You don ’ t care who goes , I suppose ?
So the lady screamed , and <NAME> started .
‘ Just damp enough to be cheerful , sir , ’ rejoined <NAME> .
Accordingly , Mr <NAME> slipped past Mr Wegg and towed him down .
‘ <NAME> well , indeed ! ’ said the <NAME> .
`` She is like the morning , '' he said .
`` And you do n't think it 's an answer , eh ?
I would not endure it .
Is it Havisham or -- ? ” I had nothing to add .
‘ I know who it is .
You wo n't see him alive again , <NAME> .
‘ You are ! ’ said Mr Carker .
`` That is all I have to trouble you with , <NAME> . ''
There , we meant to lie by all night .
‘ How goes the world , my Flintwinch ?
Only friend and companion of my slighted childhood !
You do n't suspect any harm ? ''
Upon your solemn word and honour. ’ The old man shook his head .
Towards the afternoon , her grandfather complained bitterly of hunger .
You can buy wine here .
Between the <NAME> and the <NAME> , commend me to the first ! '
He will be worn out soon , I expect .
In the heart of its radiance sat a beautiful woman -- Edith .
They listened , and it struck three .
Yes , I chanced to be passing at the time .
Why should I be frightened !
‘ Well ? ’ said <NAME> , advancing towards him on tiptoe .
But he restrained himself again- -he did not pulverise him .
I repeated , pinching her cheek .
‘ I have nothing to complain of .
The mother rose on being so addressed and fell upon the woman 's neck .
When I am out of humour , I come and growl here . ''
On a lightly-snowing afternoon she arrived at the usual corner .
A smile irradiated his face as she bent to kiss him .
Has <NAME> any idea of this himself ?
‘ Do nothing of the kind , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ See that the money is right , <NAME> , ’ said the father .
End of <NAME> ’ s The <NAME> Curiosity Shop , by <NAME>
But I don ’ t allow anybody to ride over that turf .
I am delighted to see you .
It ’ s all show with <NAME> , about <NAME> .
why did they send for these people ? '
These were the ceremonies with which he received the collegians .
He would begin by touching her hand .
infernal cunning. ’ ‘ Infernal cunning , ’ echoed two voices .
As to his voice , this misfortune has took it away .
' A many boys , ' observed <NAME> , shaking his head , despondingly .
Most men have seen my portrait at the cigar shop round the corner .
‘ Assure you ‘ pon my soul ‘ tis the case .
Its being a change was everything .
Upon my soul I will ! ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> , busy overmuch , however , will not go down into <NAME> .
She answered for herself directly .
‘ <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , ’ said Mr Dorrit .
<NAME> lots of waste-paper among the rest .
‘ No , she is not here at present , ’ returned the Notary .
‘ Where are we to go to ? ’ screamed the agitated Pickwickians .
A weak reason presented itself .
‘ Look here , dear old boy .
It was wrong in me to take it ?
If you do , you are wrong .
Let sleeping dogs lie -- who wants to rouse ‘ em ?
‘ I never thought of <NAME> .
Come ! ’ The Defaulter would make answer , ‘ Ah , Mr Pancks .
<NAME> <NAME> and you , miss , are different people .
She will walk there some time to ease her aching head .
‘ Yes , yes ! ’ cried <NAME> , with increasing eagerness .
I knew a man who was hung in <NAME> for murdering his master .
That ’ s the first thing you have done .
I laid my trembling hand upon the hand he put before his face .
And that fellow with her , eh ?
The <NAME> Reverend the <NAME> refers to that ?
‘ This here , <NAME> , ’ rejoined <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> , I s ’ pose ? ’ said <NAME> .
She thought what a good father he would be .
‘ Any room , sir ? ’ cries the new passenger to the coachman .
I think of poor dear Baby this morning. ’ ‘ So do I .
'He called my mother names , ' replied <NAME> .
‘ Is there no other road ?
‘ What was it ? ’ said the schoolmaster , tenderly .
`` Pray is your lodger within ? ''
‘ <NAME> ’ t go away , <NAME> , ’ said the black-eyed man .
' A young one , ' replied <NAME> .
He made his offer to her .
That was in the note. ’ ‘ Nothing more , ’ said the child .
‘ Would they make much difference ? ’ repeated his mistress .
I say it IS vilely , grossly , wilfully untrue .
‘ He is quite one of us .
He had no favourite ization that he knew of .
‘ It does not matter , <NAME> .
Where have they taken him to !
`` Cold and raw this morning , cold and raw ! ''
Mr Lammle , accustomed to be intrusted with the most delicate affairs .
You wouldn ’ t have to worry no one , then , sir .
Angels are not like me .
And they fired warning of him .
I have set myself against evil ; not against good .
`` Besides , I was n't proud of him . ''
I feel the present visit very much .
The atmosphere is otherwise stale and close .
‘ Say me , if you like .
He recoiled , but she laid her hand upon his arm .
Mr Feeder ’ s most romantic visions were fulfilled .
`` I do n't know who does , '' he returned .
My blood is up , but wholesomely up , when I think of it .
'They _called_ him Oliver , ' replied the woman , feebly .
‘ That ’ s his allegorical way of expressing it .
`` But I am in my regular employment , you must consider .
I am a little rambling .
`` But do n't be hard upon me !
If _that ’ s_ a taste , I have got that .
‘ <NAME> then , madame , if you please .
‘ Well , I think I will come in ! ’ said Mr Toots .
They were only three at table , and <NAME> made the third .
( “ Let her alone , ” said <NAME> . )
You ’ ll find him tough , <NAME> ’ am .
No ; that was the wrong house ; the next door .
`` You 're so well put together that I should n't have thought it .
‘ I want to know , ’ said <NAME> , and repeated his case .
It is a great resort of foreigners .
‘ My daughter , sir , requires no kindness from you or anybody else .
`` He told me once I was the nearest relation he had . ''
‘ Oh ! ’ rejoined <NAME> , ‘ I thought you did .
‘ You mean proposing ? ’ said <NAME> .
I am stunned by these discoveries .
until she was sixty , or any age that could be mentioned .
'Nothing , aunt ; nothing , ' replied the young lady .
<NAME> to fear if they parted us !
Mrs. Rouncewell is not quite sure as to that .
You can ASK me anything , Mr .
Have these men deceived us , and taken us back by another road ?
Do n't you take any pride out of yourself ?
To me , parting is a painful thing .
He is sharp enough , ’ said <NAME> , impatiently .
They changed clothes at the cottage .
`` I have had experience since .
She made him her stately curtsey in the garden , one morning before breakfast .
`` It seems unkind to leave him , <NAME> .
‘ Has he ? ’ replied the widow lady .
Shake the dust from thy feet and let him go .
I am not clear whether it was six or seven .
`` They are great weaknesses -- <NAME> , sir , they are great .
What reason have you to be morose ?
`` May I ask you a question ? ''
'Not a bit of it , ' replied <NAME> .
`` It shall not be repeated .
Lastly , it was no one , and I was no one .
‘ Happy she is , beyond all doubt , ’ said Mr Garland .
However , here was a model before him .
‘ No ; I am not going to have that done , <NAME> .
screamed the Jew , starting from his seat .
He fears he will die of joy , before he gets among them .
‘ Soon the lady makes a singular and exciting discovery .
I have never broken the condition once .
‘ Stop till I come back .
He is a public offender .
But it was not I .
Not so the eyes upon the bed .
I quickened my pace , and knocked at the door with my hand .
Therefore I have no other object in this , than what <NAME> has mentioned .
‘ I am very sorry , indeed , for all this .
‘ Well , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ That ’ s kind of you to ask .
‘ I knew but too well what all this meant .
What colour , and what texture ! ''
‘ So I was ! ’ ‘ How was the bride dressed ?
‘ No , ’ replied <NAME> , with equal abruptness .
Secondly , nearly all these young ladies subscribe to circulating libraries .
‘ Nothing ! ’ said the lady , looking up .
The state expressly asks him to trust to <NAME> .
`` I have no patience with him , '' observed <NAME> 's niece .
‘ Oh , indeed ! ’ I observed faintly .
You quite surprise me ! ’ And again he uttered never a word .
‘ My dear love , ’ said <NAME> .
Why , only think how old she looked .
Accidents , miseries , and offences , were never to be mentioned before her .
I wish he was , poor man ! '
That makes no noise , and is quite as certain , and more genteel .
“ Now , do n't echo , ” I retorted .
I am born to be served .
<NAME> , my love , your hand here. ’ ‘ Oh dear !
‘ He always came into the garden to say good night .
<NAME> tinge of damask revisiting cheek .
He belonged to the world again .
Who do you suppose is with me ? ''
'Very much so indeed , ma'am , ' said the beadle .
I am proud to make your acquaintance .
You have heard him say so fifty times .
Why , here ’ s your father , <NAME> !
'Oh yes , I can talk .
`` Thank you , <NAME> , '' says <NAME> with his usual equanimity .
He had walked no more than twelve miles , when night closed in again .
The Captain therefore hemmed to clear his throat , and read the letter aloud .
And even now , with this case , I hesitate .
We have begun of late years to imitate this good example .
They drew him to my very feet -- insensible -- dead .
where did mine learn better ?
It was him as pointed out to me where <NAME> was .
`` <NAME> , you 'll understand me , if you think a moment .
said <NAME> , beckoning over the banisters .
<NAME> <NAME> gave his consent gruff -- but gave it .
What do you go in for ?
His confidential agent eyed it keenly .
You have nothing to reproach yourself with .
He did n't make a very desperate resistance , miss !
‘ Wery good , wery good , ’ said <NAME> .
I hated that man with all a madman ’ s hate .
On deck , I took leave of poor Mrs. Micawber .
‘ Not the lad I speak on , ’ said the <NAME> .
‘ You are monstrous polite , ma ’ am , ’ said <NAME> .
Does he think to reduce me by long absence ?
And in this nation , there are fifty millions of money .
Why indeed , Mrs. Bagnet expresses with the umbrella .
He must have some object .
<NAME> for furniture of offices , so much .
‘ <NAME> and quiet as the <NAME> .
How easy my path , how much easier than his !
I came here to take leave of it before its change .
You saw my family with me , perhaps ?
Perhaps your friend in the city does .
Mrs. Micawber shrieked , and folded <NAME> in her embrace .
We must fight our way onward .
He opened his eyes after a few seconds , and looked anxiously round .
‘ Night after night comes and goes , and I have no rest .
O poor thing , poor thing ! ’ These words through her fast-dropping tears .
‘ Old lady , ’ returned Mr Boffin , ‘ you keep still .
‘ Bitter poor , my deary , ’ replied the old woman .
She was a devoted creature .
He got down , and looked eagerly inside for the beautiful young lady .
she said in a whisper .
They joked freely with one another , but seldom with him .
There is an ordinary for ladies , and an ordinary for gentlemen .
You know the accused to be the husband of my daughter .
‘ What course for me then ?
And yet as I sit at work , I smell miles of flowers .
I 'll point her out at the proper time , ' said <NAME> .
`` I knew this person by sight very well , '' says he .
Every benevolent inhabitant of this retreat had his name inscribed upon his stomach .
I am confident he wants strength of purpose .
I begin to think he ’ ll never wake , ’ observed <NAME> .
asked <NAME> with his hand to his ear .
If he could see the least sparkle of relief in her face now ?
<NAME> pretended for a little while to be busily looking among the papers .
To them I wish to add the money as she come away with .
‘ Hush ! ’ he said , in a low voice .
All these are roads to ruin .
`` That is quite right , '' said the lady , `` <NAME> . ''
They are the city scavengers , these pigs .
I should be dead in a week .
The <NAME> gazed upon him mildly .
I can not resist your prayer .
I shook my fists at <NAME> , who was as frantic as myself .
Do you guess that I have come to remind you of a promise ? '
What will he like him to be called ?
If it had n't been for the girl , I might have died . '
The world , however , was not in fault in <NAME> ’ s case .
They 're early with the kitchen fire , and that denotes good servants .
Scarcely that , for it was a look of astonished and keen inquiry .
‘ Not they , sir , ’ replied <NAME> , touching his hat .
`` I am not at all surprised to hear it . ''
Quite wondering at this discovery , <NAME> gave a single knock .
It ’ s my leg , it ’ s my leg .
The place was intolerably dirty , and the smell of tobacco smoke perfectly suffocating .
I must settle this before I sleep .
He raised his voice and called ‘ Eugene !
Not unless he gets out , I wo n't ! ''
'Nor heard anything about him ? '
`` Half after nine , sir , '' repeats <NAME> .
<NAME> , of my present , before I touch upon my future .
Who told him not to come ?
What could I do t ’ hinder her ?
Have you seen that ? ’ ‘ Ah !
But she is proud , is she not ? ''
I have no time to waste . ''
What does he do that for ?
Walking here again , citizeness ? ” “ Yes , citizen. ” “ Ah !
'And us come to bring him all these beau-ti-ful things . '
Here the friends , for a short time , separated .
Sit down on this chair , close beside me !
Oh , no , I do n't think so !
'That 's just what it was ! '
‘ It ’ s light enough for me , ’ said Mr Merdle .
So we were left to take leave of one another without any restraint .
“ I look to the pleasure of seeing you again in the morning .
Your good opinion is a consolation to me .
She remonstrates , laughing , and is a childish schoolgirl again .
I am ashamed to have brought Mr Headstone with me .
<NAME> see to it yourself .
You can say I am coming . '
' I have been lingering here these two hours .
Such a thought never came into my head !
His visitor observed the look , and proceeded .
The world did put it about , that she admired my style .
Oh , the strong eyes , and the weak frame !
<NAME> taught him even that much ; he found it out .
That ’ s the worst of you .
and not my <NAME> gentleman ?
<NAME> man of the name of <NAME> !
You 'd better bring the boy here to-morrow night .
I always knew the real worth of such characters as yours !
Call it at the outside a week .
‘ Very well , my dear Sir , very well , ’ said <NAME> .
`` I wish to hear it at the window , then .
It is not in tameness of spirit that I submit .
Where does that responsibility rest ?
I must put something under the cushion for your head .
He had another reason for this .
If you do , well and good .
But , there was nothing there .
They were a goodly company , and the <NAME> all but worshipped them .
Why , good gracious me , suppose the house was to be let !
“ Have you written 'forget them ' ? ” <NAME> asked .
`` And you 're doing well , Mr .
There -- see how this iron bar bends beneath my furious wrench .
‘ I must move rapidly , or I could not draw my breath .
Sure he saw the prisoner with these lists ?
Not a single word did <NAME> speak .
What could I become with these surroundings ?
‘ I will not go in just yet , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ My Wal ’ r , as I used to call you !
You 've been in low spirits this afternoon .
At length , quite unexpectedly , he said something in a whisper .
But I come up with ‘ em , and I crossed ‘ em .
Devil a word , gentlemen , the chair would say .
She was in a state of lawful innocence , so to speak .
Now , take a rest , and then we ’ ll talk again .
He 'd find himself growing thin , if he did n't look sharp ! ''
They were not interchanging a word or a look .
‘ Do you give lessons , ma ’ am ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
She presented herself to me as the wife of the <NAME> .
Something or somebody had superseded him as a source of interest .
‘ <NAME> ’ t wait , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
He was very fond of pickled walnuts , gentlemen .
<NAME> : But you think that their abolition would damage a class of practitioners ?
His wristbands and collar were oppressive ; his voice and manner were oppressive .
There ’ ll be beer to feth .
‘ How do you know I am old ?
I answered , most assuredly he did not .
His friends might advise him , you know ; now he is free .
`` Devil doubt him , '' says <NAME> .
Those things would be the watch and shirt-pin .
Heaven save the ladies , how they dress !
“ Your head is cool ? ” he said , touching it .
`` Are you a married man , sir ? ''
Soaking into this filthy ground as you lie here , is your own shape .
He held out his hand , which <NAME> clasped tight in hers .
The man was not unnaturally cruel or hard-hearted .
That 's the kind of man <NAME> is ! ''
Our mother died there , when we were little children .
‘ Shovel and all ! ’ said <NAME> .
That ’ s the way it works .
And I have so many old parchmentses and papers in my stock .
‘ Look at his hang-dog air , ’ said <NAME> , following .
My guardian lay at the <NAME> in the next room to mine .
Some scars on her back. ’ ‘ Ran away , the <NAME> wench Mary .
“ Faithful dear boy , well done .
`` I do n't know who may not , if you may not . ''
But of course I can ’ t answer for the consequences .
`` By heaven , he is the proudest fellow breathing .
‘ Bless the precious boy ! ’ cried <NAME> , taking hold of me .
You know what I mean .
`` Not so easily as you think .
We ca n't take THAT in a court of justice , gentlemen .
This , too , delighted <NAME> .
`` Not enough , '' says the trooper , shaking his head .
No wonder. ’ ‘ No wonder , ’ repeated <NAME> .
I was sent for , and the case was entrusted to me .
‘ But what a situation was hers !
‘ What ’ s come to you , <NAME> ?
Or so -- like a fried fish .
Finally , the worthy couple went away arm in arm .
‘ At what time will it be ready ? ’ asked Mr Codlin faintly .
‘ I ’ ll take down the heads if you please , sir .
'All that I could hope to do , and even more .
‘ A natural ambition enough , ’ said <NAME> , coolly .
This reply is cut short by <NAME> 's arrival .
‘ Good-morning , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
Shocking thing that , Tom. ” ‘ “ Dreadful ! ” said <NAME> .
There are funds in hand at present .
My works don ’ t all moulder away , and rot in the earth .
‘ I hadn ’ t a shoe to my foot .
Another morning arrived , and she came alone .
They seem to come natural to me. ’ ‘ Mr .
‘ What are you a-laughin ’ at , corpilence ? ’ ‘ <NAME> !
<NAME> made in every direction .
<NAME> <NAME> is not in the library , but she repairs to the library .
why , she was always coming backwards and forwards .
I know nothing about seven and sixpence .
I see , I see. ’ There was silence between them .
<NAME> is true to me .
He knew these men , also , perfectly .
Does he ever think of his daughter , or wonder where she is gone ?
`` That is a more alarming person than the clerk .
By the moonlight , <NAME> can be seen in profile , perfectly still .
Upon his sacred word of honour , there was no cause of alarm .
Mr and <NAME> had found their search a difficult one .
‘ <NAME> and snappish we are !
‘ I prefer being alone , ’ replied the single gentleman .
So , she once more died away , and nobody minded her .
For the first time in many years , he had no strong drink .
There you have the man !
And here I fell asleep .
'What do you mean by ca n't be ?
And <NAME> went about his daily pursuits .
‘ Look here , you sir , ’ said <NAME> .
The girl lingered a little while to talk , and tell her grievances .
Before it could be given him , he would be gone again .
‘ Well , I ’ m sure ! ’ exclaimed <NAME> .
And you ? ’ Mr <NAME> said in a low growl , ‘ Oh !
I looked at both of them .
‘ Have YOU been making that horrible noise ? ’ said the single gentleman .
Introduce him to me , and I 'll cultivate his acquaintance .
‘ Take your Dictionary , for example .
‘ Is it the last occupant ’ s furniture ? ’ inquired my aunt .
‘ <NAME> ’ like it , ’ replied his father .
‘ Here we are , ’ said <NAME> .
And I looked so , I have no doubt .
`` Do n't you think you can receive his evidence , sir ? ''
<NAME> rose early , and set out on foot for <NAME> .
He invited <NAME> to take a glass of claret .
‘ You have withdrawn yourself in your sullenness to your own room .
I knew that every drop it held was a drop of my life .
<NAME> 's ailings were neither slight nor few .
Mrs <NAME> replied he was not coming .
`` May be not , still I do n't like it .
I have known many adventurers ; interesting spirits -- amiable society !
`` You may have heard my name -- Jarndyce . ''
<NAME> was a criminal , she said , who had killed his wife .
This dream is too real .
‘ And a sweet set they is for sich ! ’ said Mrs. Crupp .
‘ “ What have you got in that bottle ? ” said the goblin .
I live at her father ’ s , and was with her .
‘ Oh never quite , my darling !
You are not used to being officered ; I am .
There were few preparatory arrangements to be made for the marriage of <NAME> .
‘ In fine , then , I name it the history of this house .
“ It was a rash one , ” said she .
Not a man knows it better .
Dear me , <NAME> , that ’ s sharp practice !
The old lady can do nothing but go in search of him .
It bent its head low again , and said not a word .
Perfectly. ’ ‘ But look at it , too .
“ It was n't ending it , I suppose ?
It is peculiar. ’ No doubt .
`` It is not an illness of any serious consequence , <NAME> .
<NAME> and dear little Twoshoes !
‘ What ’ s become of him ? ’ asked my aunt .
“ _I_ ask no questions and make no stipulations .
‘ Like the startled fawn , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ What ’ s the matter ? ’ he asked in plain <NAME> .
There is no such thing as such fulfilment on this earth .
It is the hottest long vacation known for many years .
‘ A tragedy. ’ <NAME> seemed much relieved .
Is that your fidelity to me ?
I wasn ’ t here myself above seven year before you .
Who made me “ a fellow like this ” ?
He was a true <NAME> , and hoped there were many like him .
I thank you even more for the tone of the question .
A fair girl with rich brown hair hanging free in natural ringlets .
You will allow me to order you lunch after your journey , sir . ''
said <NAME> , coming hastily forward .
‘ Once make a giant common and giants will never draw again .
If not yesterday , why then today .
<NAME> <NAME> knitted with nimble fingers and steady eyebrows , and saw nothing .
Grandfather Smallweed smiles in a very ugly way in recognition of the letter .
<NAME> , dear ! ’ I changed the subject by referring to <NAME> .
You ’ ll make nothing of this .
Her eyes were closing , but they opened again .
I say , my dear Loo !
The first man I saw , was seated at his loom , at work .
Their walk was the walk of a race apart .
'What has become of him !
‘ Ay ! ’ exclaimed the Manager , ‘ what ’ s that ?
it wasn ’ t for him to betray his trust , was it ?
I may say that I do too , and always did .
After some quarter of an hour ’ s absence , he returned .
' I never , never will , sir , ' interposed <NAME> .
Here he was searched ; and nothing being found upon him , locked up .
`` Nod it ; that 's what I want to see you do .
But there was other trouble .
It was all gone now .
The boy shouted ; four birds flew out .
'That man must be delivered up by you , ' said the gentleman .
Here IS the young man ! ''
Next comes what you mean to say .
'Make a bow to the gentleman , <NAME> , ' said Mrs. Mann .
He had never seen the instrument that was to terminate his life .
Now I ask you fair .
My passion for her is beyond all bounds .
But it may not be so .
`` Never have -- '' `` Not <NAME> , <NAME> ? ''
<NAME> coals to be relied upon ?
It was quite dark when he was awakened by a push from <NAME> .
It is one <NAME> , it appears .
It was a very low fire indeed ; nothing on such a bitter night .
This chafing over , the ornamental part of <NAME> 's toilet is soon performed .
‘ Is <NAME> in ? ’ faltered <NAME> .
`` <NAME> , '' replies the other , `` I am in the downs .
Stopped speaking only ; her hand was still in motion .
<NAME> <NAME> shortly afterwards took himself off , to prepare for his journey .
I believe it , in its effects , to be cruel and wrong .
It was very possible that Mr <NAME> had not yet left the office .
I am sure you will respect it .
pursues <NAME> , pinching <NAME> 's cheeks .
Do you know him , Mr .
When toned down again , the unimpeachable patriot appeared in the witness-box .
Tom-all-Alone 's My <NAME> is restless , very restless .
‘ So should I , ’ said <NAME> , speaking for the first time .
It could not be doubted that this was the truth .
<NAME> , all the world , to this creature of <NAME> !
‘ I AM miserable , ’ returned <NAME> , evidently pouting .
I did not understand it .
It and I have worn away together .
'Doctor , your clients are people of condition .
I held his hand for a little while in mine .
They shone in every part of the dance like moons .
It is the <NAME> of <NAME> to him .
I see one thing , ” said <NAME> .
There seemed to be no hope for him .
I can ’ t work you into a miscellaneous one , no how .
This is the garden of <NAME> 's <NAME> .
They both know what they want and mean to do .
It blows over the -- ha -- Surrey hills .
Can dance , and play music , and sing ?
I know what it is , ’ replied the friend .
He has no respect for <NAME> .
It was Saturday , and he had gone to <NAME> .
But wot ’ s the good of saying that to you !
On one chair-back hang the old man 's hairy cap and coat .
`` Naturally there was no end to his tongue then .
“ Is it being a good wife to oppose your husband 's business ?
‘ I thought so ! ’ said he .
There were holidays at school on other birthdays -- none on mine .
There was an execution put into our house , for rent .
cried the voice of the girl whom he had followed .
`` It 's eleven o'clock striking by the bell of <NAME> 's .
He was a very hard man , and her mother had long been dead .
Their education is much as with us ; neither better nor worse .
But , dear guardian , you are late too , and look weary .
The officer crossed to <NAME> , and <NAME> went up to <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> taken , my mother !
`` Well , sir , I suppose it is .
I was mentioning your perception of my weaknesses .
Has the picture been engraved , miss ? ''
‘ You have heard it all , and you ’ ll not forget it .
<NAME> trees grew in corners of the cellars .
<NAME> gracious goodness heavins , I 've found him ! '
Bless his heart ; it 's <NAME> alive again ! ''
After all the trouble that has been taken with you !
‘ It is short , no doubt , my dear .
You can ’ t say more to me than I say to myself .
‘ It was her father that I got acquainted with first .
I ask you who done it and how you know it .
asked the sleepy <NAME> , shaking himself pettishly .
There is nothing in her manner to express weakness or excite compassion .
‘ Come in , come in ! ’ said <NAME> .
We shall know full soon .
That he was a suspicious , crabbed , cranky , used-up , J .
I am going to <NAME> , having friends there .
‘ That was the treatment , you see .
inquired the lawyer in a low voice .
It ain ’ t much to boast of , genteel as his own is .
'Look how he stares , <NAME> !
This was not lost on the speaker .
Besides , they know where to find you , and I represent you .
It wants constant attention in the littlest things .
that ’ s not enough ! ’ she cried .
I was just giving you up , sir , and going home . ''
she asked , after they had walked a few hundred yards .
I have fear of this man .
‘ Come ! ’ cried the subject of this admiration , returning .
‘ This is indeed an unexpected pleasure !
What have I been and done ?
`` He is changed , '' he returned , shaking his head .
`` Yet would you believe that it 's HIS name on the door-plate ? ''
I was jealous of everybody .
I am old in years , and older still in misery and care .
It is quite a bower in the summer-time .
Moreover , I have done no wrong , and have injured no man .
I know it does. ’ Of <NAME> and <NAME> .
Now what are you going to do ?
I should forget how to wear a whole coat now .
‘ First , he wants some water , ’ said he , looking round .
This was frequently their theme of conversation .
He knew me better than I knew myself .
`` I am very glad to go there , sir , '' I answered .
`` My time is nearly gone . ''
I was a nuisance , an incumbrance , and a pest .
Disguised , but the same man .
‘ I was quite at your disposition .
`` Even if I have grown so much wiser , what then ?
‘ You are very good , ’ said <NAME> .
there are times when ignorance is bliss indeed .
‘ You have done a stealthy and unbecoming action , <NAME> .
‘ Why do you bring your prolifigate companions here ?
I seem , then , to be worthier of the eldest Miss Larkins .
The mud and water fly about us .
“ Well ? ” cried my sister , addressing us both at once .
‘ I will remain here to light you up the stairs .
You went down to the river together ? ’ ‘ Undoubtedly .
‘ Then it was their own fault , ’ said Mr Podsnap .
I can not bear ’ t nommore .
It added in a postscript that I would not be many hours from <NAME> .
To see how she operated upon him with a pen-knife !
The bed had not been lain on , but was smooth and empty .
'It was the <NAME> , I tell you .
‘ _Can _you ! ’ repeated <NAME> , with a smile of pity .
`` But I may ask you a question , <NAME> ? ''
Here I sit at the desk again , on a drowsy summer afternoon .
‘ Of course he proposed it , but how did it all come about ?
I do n't know nothink about nothink at all . ''
But he had married in <NAME> ?
“ Did you think of walking down to Walworth ? ” said he .
Can you make a honourable lady of her ? ''
‘ Yes. ’ ‘ O , I could never go there any more .
We have lived plainly enough here , <NAME> and I .
Every eye was turned to the jury .
It was a little idea of mine .
`` You are impanelled here to inquire into the death of a certain man .
‘ Thank you , ’ replied <NAME> , showing all his teeth .
' I lost the boy , and no efforts of mine could recover him .
In his dear <NAME> ’ s name and in his own , thank you !
How could they help it !
Are you in the <NAME> , or where are you ?
you , of course , ’ said <NAME> .
And get on , my lads ! ''
Then who so blest and happy as <NAME> , saving and excepting Mr <NAME> !
He begins quite to amuse our little party .
`` I will prove you , '' repeats mademoiselle in her former whisper .
When you wouldn ’ t give me nothing .
‘ Perhaps you are right , uncle , ’ replied Mrs. <NAME> , submissively .
Then I am here as soon as you , you see .
He stopped at a door .
So I thought when <NAME> married , and so I always have thought since .
So you gave notice that you were going ?
“ Yes , do , father , ” says <NAME> .
Do n't look forward to variety , but you 'll have excellence .
'Of course they can , ' replied <NAME> .
The passive desolation of disuse was everywhere silently manifest about it .
Oh no , for that would be too much !
‘ A proud fool ! ’ said my aunt .
`` Oh , no doubt , '' said <NAME> .
You have a brother ; you know it , and him .
We do n't pretend to do it . ''
‘ He said I should object ? ’ asked <NAME> .
‘ As I say , the end crowns the work .
Oh , my aches and pains !
‘ There I must umbly beg leave to differ from you .
Well ; <NAME> took her home .
But , they had no ears for anything in their surprise .
Nothing less than a repetition of that infallible remedy will relieve his feelings .
Why , take yourself , <NAME> , <NAME> .
His terrors affected the child .
From whence do these papers come , you say ?
A deeper slumber followed this -- and then -- What !
thinks the afflicted stationer , as recollection breaks upon him .
‘ I should like to see him , ’ said <NAME> .
You are good , accomplished , and beautiful as an angel .
“ <NAME> , then , ” said <NAME> ; “ think of this !
<NAME> , known also as the <NAME> of <NAME> , is a fine town .
Thus encouraged , <NAME> tapped at the study door .
The old man was by this time up and dressed .
Three sacks below are quite enough for Mr .
Do you attend the family ? ’ I asked .
“ You know what I am , do n't you ?
You understand all about it ?
Each of us , in his own way , got more mad every moment .
But you must be fatigued .
One or other. ’ ‘ One or other ?
That friend is Twemlow. ’ ‘ Certainly ! ’ from <NAME> .
'Not a bit of it , ' observed <NAME> .
I do not pretend to account for it to you , sir .
‘ No bodily inconvenience , ’ replied the lady .
In the interval , old <NAME> will be scarce .
The reins were broken , but they had been dragging on the ground .
‘ Glad to see you back again , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
At it they went , tooth and nail .
There seems a fitness in the arrangement .
And now I 'll tell you something .
I had many selfish thoughts at that time , many ! ''
Can you think what it was ? ’ I believed I could .
There are not many to equal her !
Where 's my bag of documents ?
<NAME> <NAME> was the first to break the astonished silence .
'What a grateful little dear it is .
‘ Nevy of a scientific Uncle !
For a gun is fired close by .
Yes , ’ said <NAME> , withdrawing his attention from the smoke .
You must have some physic .
<NAME> , <NAME> , only think of its being you !
‘ Are you a sailor , sir ? ’ he asked .
`` What are you going to do about him ? ''
‘ No , no. ’ ‘ Do not try , ’ replied Nicholas .
‘ I wonder whether <NAME> ’ s disengaged now ? ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Surely it must be the same man , ’ thought <NAME> .
‘ Yes , but only for white children. ’ Noble aristocracy in crime !
Oh , my heart is breaking when I think about it !
So she is an angel , <NAME> .
and fixed her fine eyes on <NAME> again .
A beadle ordered to hold his tongue !
Oh wandering heart at rest !
<NAME> B. does not deny it , <NAME> .
I had fulfilled my destiny .
When adopted ? ” <NAME> shrugged his shoulders .
<NAME> <NAME> went occasionally to a public-house called The <NAME> .
<NAME> ’ s mother , my good soul , farewell .
My father ’ s former calling was umble .
You wouldn ’ t wish to make unpleasantness .
To some men it never comes ; let them rest and be thankful !
I should think it no disgrace to work , <NAME> knows .
‘ You pay him for his share in bringing about this sale of <NAME> .
<NAME> would contrive to take him , somehow , he said .
“ You made mention of the young lady as a golden-haired doll .
he observes when he is in trim again .
says the ironmaster , checking her in a low voice , though not angrily .
But Precedent and Precipitate together frightened all objection out of most people .
‘ You know what I am going to say .
‘ You don ’ t say so ! ’ ejaculated <NAME> .
<NAME> ’ t be uneasy about me .
<NAME> my coat across at the chest , my love .
Is that , or something like it , the ring of the cant ?
<NAME> alone talked steadily and evenly .
<NAME> of an unfortunate father , but -- ha -- always a gentleman .
He obtruded himself upon us in the first instance .
And you quite a small party then , yourself .
`` Rents ARE high about here .
`` I 'm sure I 'm surprised at that .
‘ Very much admired , indeed , the young woman was .
That ’ s the vay to begin .
<NAME> , aye , mistress , it 's you , is it ?
‘ Oh , he ’ s all right , ’ said <NAME> .
`` I do n't know what it is .
The mother and her daughters were engaged in sewing .
I sat next to her .
three times without making an impression .
Last evening he does this .
‘ -- Hear me out ! ’ cried <NAME> .
I ask you , what is that light ? ''
He now sat looking at the fire , and bit his lip .
<NAME> him , ’ cried <NAME> , as the chant began again .
We are a great country , <NAME> , we are a very great country .
<NAME> , look again upon the prisoner .
She may be an hour , she may be more .
I ’ ll make <NAME> bark at you all day .
<NAME> doubt , I am sure .
Her hands were then nervously clasping together , but he took one of them .
‘ <NAME> , take a seat on the bed , will you ?
Such roads I had never seen .
If they discern no such thing , they will consider me altogether mistaken .
There was no resource but to knock at the door .
Because I am well aware of my deficiencies .
It is a foolish mercy .
The soldiers ' swords are sharpened there , ” said <NAME> .
In this house , and with this family , I passed my leisure time .
The blindness of my confidence is past , <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> ’ s keen glance comprehended all of us .
‘ Shaving-water , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , from within the curtains .
“ That ’ s it ! ” says the doctor .
‘ To Mr Dombey , ’ says the old man .
From this time you begin your history .
I recollect saying with my own lips that I was much too umble .
‘ Dear Mr Clennam , I must say something to you before I go .
'It would be hard to tell .
“ You are a man of business and bound to have a reason .
Anywhere beyond his reach , was no reply to the question .
‘ Just so , ’ returned Mrs. Micawber .
‘ I hope good may be coming of it in the future time .
Not a thread changes , in the house of the two little bird-like ladies .
‘ What is it but a grave ! ’ said the sexton .
The meeting did not take place without great emotion on both sides .
This might lead to his apprehension as he passed along the streets .
Is she dozing , old lady ? '
Pay five shillings fine for you indeed .
We shall soon know now .
‘ So she does , ’ assented <NAME> .
At last the ringing of horses ’ bells greeted his anxious ears .
With my husband standing by !
‘ Bottle of wine to the gentleman on the box .
Do you hear me when I tell you that , my darling ?
He seemed to be losing time unless he was moving .
Why can ’ t they do as I have done , ma ’ am ?
‘ <NAME> Groffin. ’ ‘ Here , ’ said the chemist .
‘ Wot job ? ’ said the long-legged young man .
And what did the doctor call it ?
Says , `` Bless my soul , sir !
This can he charged to nobody .
It cost me five-and-twenty shillings .
Where are you going ? ’ was the next compassionate chorus she heard .
‘ Who passes by this road so late ?
I see her grown up -- gent ’ lmen -- like a flower .
‘ Yes , I think you had better .
Such tokens seldom flourish long .
And why glorious , my young friend ?
<NAME> , dong , ding ; hammer , clang , clash !
said <NAME> , after a pause .
Thus the lessons of my life have been perverted !
<NAME> , having folded the letter , walks in that direction .
He has been there so long !
Before one can say ‘ Thank Heaven ! ’ she wrongs again .
The weather was miserably raw , and the two cursed the cold .
What a useful work a Dictionary is !
‘ A great deal , ’ replied <NAME> ; ‘ but not now .
‘ Sound philosopher , ’ said <NAME> .
Things go too contrary with me .
I shall find a time when we can steal away .
No one can never fill the place that ’ s empty .
The man shook his head .
‘ <NAME> , sir , ’ said the one-eyed man to <NAME> .
I have not the least idea what we had for dinner , besides <NAME> .
Another shake of the hand , <NAME> , if you please .
And immediately darted into her state-cabin again .
Those Furies , the conventionalities , being thus appeased , he left her .
Something that -- ' 'You had better bid , ' interrupted Mrs. Bumble .
`` But pray tell me how you got it . ''
' I could n't help it , <NAME> .
These were all the antecedents known in <NAME> Canon Corner of the coming pupils .
Do n't be afraid , <NAME> , you shall come back to us again .
I replied , ‘ I , <NAME> !
I have long found that there is nothing .
I have a partiality for everything genuine .
I begged he would excuse me from discussing it .
‘ Why , I think it ’ s Mr Carker , ’ said <NAME> .
He was not so much surprised to see me as I had expected .
There is no look of decent comfort anywhere .
I can ’ t keep my money very well .
<NAME> might see that the shadow of the wall was dark upon him .
The lady made no answer , but she smiled again .
‘ No , sir , it was not .
‘ There was that sort of thing done to me somehow .
Sometimes <NAME> faints himself , but the result is the same .
You want to know why I played this little trick that you have interrupted ?
There are only four of us .
“ 'Yes , master , and I 've never been in it much . '
Yet I had never been taught to pray for any relation but my godmother .
‘ <NAME> ’ t it a steamer ? ’ he pauses to ask her .
I clearly perceived , too , that <NAME> shared my feelings .
the counting up to twelve , and 'Hush ! '
<NAME> told it again with great care , and rang every sovereign .
He wrote with extraordinary neatness .
The sun is tremendously hot , even to me .
‘ That ’ s comforting , and I hope you may be right .
‘ Did you hear him ? ’ retorted <NAME> .
'Yes , sir , ' said <NAME> .
And why , then , do men tread them ?
Now , the point was this .
‘ He never loved nobody , ’ bawled Squeers , through the keyhole .
‘ What ’ s your name , sir ? ’ inquired the judge .
`` It was he who was very gentlemanly , I think ! ''
Suddenly <NAME> gave such a scream that I all but dropped it .
The Storming of the <NAME> in the Air 20 .
said <NAME> , suddenly breaking silence .
‘ <NAME> gobbled and gobbled , till I found out how to do it .
`` Let us open the window a bit and get a mouthful of air .
They were very quiet again .
He brought me such joyful and wonderful intelligence about you !
They are no part of the case .
There was very little said at dinner .
The fact is , our roads are not the same .
We never have tunes here . ''
Yes. ’ ‘ It shall be done , <NAME> .
Come into this house for heaven 's sake !
<NAME> took it up , shaking from head to foot .
I had known him a long time -- from a little child .
<NAME> home to your poor mother , you young dog !
`` He is a very fervid , impassioned speaker -- full of fire !
Some are almost sliding down , as you look at them .
Dr. Crocus has come all this way to cure you , gentlemen .
The boy made no sign .
It had been uniformly gloomy and dull .
‘ Ha ! ’ said Mr <NAME> , with a portentous frown .
Mr <NAME> wished him to take it , and he had taken it .
inquired one of the magistrates .
She uttered no cry of distress .
We have had a wretched existence .
‘ It is an honour , indeed ! ’ said <NAME> .
You do , do n't you , Phil ? ''
He had always doubled , and sometimes quadrupled , his fees .
She lives near <NAME> .
They looked at each other .
I will speak to you by and by -- another time .
‘ I do , indeed , ’ replied the junior .
'Let 'em alone for that , ' replied the undertaker .
The pudding was out of the copper .
‘ By advertising , ’ said Mrs. Micawber -- ‘ in all the papers .
Much as the <NAME> is one person , and <NAME> is another .
<NAME> <NAME> ’ s establishment was about to undergo a serene hush .
It 's not that I do n't or I wo n't .
It will be heard of , one day .
She merely speaks of stock-in-trade .
'She has pretty well settled that , in her own mind , already . '
IT was falling dark when <NAME> came out of <NAME> ’ s house .
She does it with all her heart and soul .
‘ But not his daughter ? ’ said <NAME> .
I say , <NAME> ! ” calling me back , and speaking low .
the poor <NAME> ! ” With a sigh of great compassion .
‘ Pray do not make me the subject of any bets .
`` My dear sir , '' said the other , shaking hands with him .
‘ It was a wilderness to me once .
What doth your friend thay ?
Then , I saw him wait for her and meet her .
And you are always in my thoughts now .
She was more than human to me .
‘ I know you thought so .
Thus whispering , they both go in together .
His property in money amounted to nearly three thousand pounds .
Now the tongue -- now the pigeon pie .
This is the <NAME> , <NAME> , in a cab-full of wollumes .
‘ I beg you to excuse me .
‘ Satisfaction , I mean , ’ returned the <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> , be quiet , ’ said <NAME> .
The carriages are once more at the church door .
I didn ’ t like his eye .
'There is no other , ' said the doctor .
He said , ‘ <NAME> Pythick. ’ I asked him who was <NAME> ?
‘ Give me your hand , my worthy friend , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Who is <NAME> ? ’ whispered <NAME> .
It was a ghastly figure to look upon .
I played the game to an end with <NAME> , and she beggared me .
I made an exception of you at first .
That thought I never had .
A part of the bone came out .
‘ That ’ s the point , ’ said his sister .
But it was pleasant cookery too .
I came to tell you .
‘ Why , what do you call yourselves ?
He was a mighty monarch .
You dined over the way .
But nothing more was found .
`` I wonder you do n't go into <NAME> . ''
'Have you anything to ask this witness , boy ? '
<NAME> sorry for you. ’ ‘ And I for you , poor boy !
Then the thought must have come upon him , poor , poor father !
<NAME> ’ t hide , you know ; that ’ s mean .
It was quite unmindful , and sat thinking .
He looked to the right and to the left , uncertain whither to fly .
And yet he was asleep .
I have n't any sister , or father and mother either .
<NAME> <NAME> was there , and <NAME> was there .
We are together to talk it over .
To this <NAME> had no objection .
I wish you 'd lend me half a crown .
said <NAME> to <NAME> .
It was the elder who replied , 'Since about this hour last night . '
And I didn ’ t four seven one .
In this state of things , <NAME> was appealed to .
Never had master a more anxious , humble , docile pupil .
Oo him ? ’ asked <NAME> .
You may say <NAME> there , for I was a gentleman then .
These are the real feelings that I had .
At length the quarters of the little <NAME> arose in view .
‘ With submission , my soul , ’ pleaded Mr Sparkler .
Let whomsoever it most concerned look well to it !
`` Do you mean your husband ? ''
“ I know it well , ” answered <NAME> .
'And what have I heard !
‘ Wa ’ et be the matther noo ?
`` You are fettered , '' said <NAME> , trembling .
‘ Confound the girl , I am half afraid of her .
<NAME> was passed through , and they came again into the lonely road .
Am I a nasty , cruel , selfish , bad mama ?
But , profound gravity sat enthroned on <NAME> ’ s countenance .
At least , don ’ t do it to me .
It 's quite enough that we let 'em have live bodies .
Its abiding place was in all things fitted to it .
Five days , six days , seven days , eight days , nine days .
'So you did , ' observed <NAME> , in a low voice .
‘ I thought it might be agreeable , my dear , ’ said <NAME> .
But , the charm was broken .
Mr <NAME> was the first to lift up his head and speak .
There was another , and a darker object , to be gained .
If not remote enough , I can go remoter .
‘ Ah , child , you pass a good many hours here !
I have often told you , <NAME> , you have no such sympathy . ''
Why , wherever you are going , '' said the gentleman .
‘ The appeal to him seemed necessary .
I knew your father before you .
May it haunt their houses pleasantly , and no one wish to lay it .
I am sufficiently behind the scenes to know the worth of political life .
In which <NAME> falls in <NAME> .
`` At poor <NAME> 's , '' said <NAME> .
said <NAME> as we went downstairs .
Do you know what you have done ?
However , of course , you can do as you like .
`` It shall say it , <NAME> .
Nor is it your fault .
‘ <NAME> , ’ she said at length .
‘ His name ! ’ cried <NAME> .
You made it all right , first .
I would walk back at my leisure .
I don ’ t think that there ever were such people as those Peltiroguses .
She knew of their existence by hundreds and by thousands .
‘ Is <NAME> with you yet ? ’ I asked .
<NAME> up to her , <NAME> .
Then I shall probably not see him for some little time to come .
Especially One Happy Afternoon IX .
<NAME> and his men complain sometimes , of being exhausted .
`` I know there is such a stationer , '' returns <NAME> .
He will want it when he comes back .
The trooper falters and looks at him .
<NAME> <NAME> can never permit that assertion to pass uncontradicted .
<NAME> <NAME> inquired in what respect ?
Other people had thought of such things , if I had not .
I lie down now , to ease my head .
‘ He is , ’ said the middle-aged lady .
‘ What ’ s this ? ’ repeated Mr Dombey , almost foaming .
It is a retired situation .
'Go on , ' said the person addressed , turning away his face .
<NAME> could say no more .
Both gentlemen laughed for some time .
‘ Not on no account , ’ replied the inexorable creditor .
I Fall into <NAME> V. I Am <NAME> VI .
‘ What did you want to say ? ’ demanded <NAME> , shaking him .
<NAME> sharp , or <NAME> will think I 'm lost . '
That ’ s exactly what I am incapable of doing .
<NAME> , <NAME> , is not a bad or a degrading quality .
The way he ’ d sit and chuckle over himself !
if you come to prosperous , you are prosperous , ” said <NAME> .
Nothing can be tided over now , <NAME> .
'She shall , ' said Mrs. Maylie .
In the <NAME> is the charter itself .
You 're a scorpion -- a brimstone scorpion !
'Wot a precious strange gal that is ! '
A letter lay on his table .
When they take their inventions into foreign countries , that ’ s quite different .
‘ They should be so , of course .
And she handed me the key across the counter .
The rooms in which they worked , were as well ordered as themselves .
It ’ s the case with my own wife .
I squeezed it dry to-day. ’ ‘ Nonsense , sir .
He was not singing as usual , nor was he seated at his desk .
Come in ! ’ ‘ I beg your pardon , Mr Carker .
The end of the second book .
‘ Because I should change ; not those about me .
‘ That is my brave boy , ’ said <NAME> .
I don ’ t feel quite myself .
`` I am glad of your good opinion . ''
It was <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> .
The indigent blind of that state are admitted gratuitously .
Swear it was not true ?
‘ <NAME> to do it , were you ? ’ said <NAME> .
`` Very magnanimous indeed , sir , '' observed my guardian .
<NAME> came round for me at dinner-time .
She began to forget him soon after her discovery of the <NAME> family .
But never mind them just now .
His adversary saw the advantage he had gained , and followed it up .
It is late ; I need say no more to-night .
See another reason for urging it on !
This was the utmost description <NAME> could give me .
That , my dear <NAME> , appears to me to be his true position .
‘ Oh , nothing , nothing , ’ replied <NAME> .
“ He 's an invalid now , ” replied <NAME> .
It was solely the effect of his internal emotions .
They asked me to look out for you , ’ said the man .
`` Such as they were , of course . ''
oh no , I have not been out of town , ’ said <NAME> .
He was still by the river-side .
Let some be upon their guard .
`` I was bred in this place .
‘ Forty-two , ’ replied the driver , eyeing him askant .
<NAME> , poor me , the business is slack , is slack !
I am as free as the air .
There ’ s a chill in the air , governor .
<NAME> <NAME> is here , gentlemen , the celebrated Dr. Crocus !
<NAME> not soothing , but reverse .
‘ What ! ’ cried the <NAME> , in a terrible voice .
They shall be made an example of .
`` Whether by his own hand -- '' `` Upon my honour ! ''
‘ Shall I put it off till to-morrow ? ’ said <NAME> .
I will be the mistress of <NAME> when you please . ''
The guard was standing at the door , waiting for the letter-bag .
‘ These five sisters were all of surpassing beauty .
There never was such a house for noises .
You little fool ! ’ ‘ I beg your pardon .
'Smelling the grub like a old lady a going to market !
Go and speak to <NAME> .
look to that young lady .
Gets finer as she gets on .
‘ I can trust you as myself .
<NAME> ought to be possessed of the whole case .
Well spoken , <NAME> , so near your Mistress !
His feeling about the child had been negative from her birth .
Mr. What ’ s-your-name , you were going to refer some question to Micawber .
`` I am sure I do n't wonder at it ! ''
That would have been a change indeed .
I 'm going to take a liberty with you .
‘ Then , I have got it , boy ! ’ said <NAME> .
I -- ha -- need not trouble you , <NAME> .
He knew , now , what he had done .
<NAME> <NAME> looked consciously at <NAME> , and heaved a little sigh .
`` I shall be honoured , I am sure , '' said <NAME> .
I assure you I have no desire to be controversial .
The <NAME> , & c. , is on sale .
‘ <NAME> up , <NAME> ! ’ cried <NAME> .
D -- me , if my neck-handkercher a n't lined with beer !
“ I should have said this sooner , but for my long mistake .
‘ I am very well , I thank you , ’ he would answer .
But I hope I did it for his good .
I supposed the room was empty .
<NAME> water , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ No ; and take away the candle .
‘ What are they doing now ? ’ inquired <NAME> , adjusting his spectacles .
I do n't know , ” returned <NAME> , smiling .
I have the most confused impressions of that walk .
She loved me dearly , but was never happy .
‘ And now I know what it is .
‘ That ’ s wot he says , miss , ’ replied <NAME> coolly .
‘ Is my peace nothing ? ’ said the single gentleman .
Have I ever excused her for it ?
I say condoled , but her only words were `` Jenny !
‘ God bless you , old fellow ! ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Give me the one without a foot .
<NAME> 's valise and hot water to <NAME> .
' I wish you had watched the play .
“ Where will you put me ? ” he asked , presently .
‘ Why , what lovely hair ! ’ cried <NAME> .
‘ Another ? ’ says this woman , in a querulous , rattling whisper .
After a short duration , the permission was most graciously conceded .
This is not an inspiriting close to a dull day .
to touch that passive hand in love and friendship .
They would not be moved .
I had had no purpose , no sustaining soul within me , anywhere .
‘ That ’ s the happiness of you young people , ’ she continued .
This must be very sore . ''
You are a blessing to us .
very soon ! ’ replied the child .
`` Well , mother dear , I say again , I hope not . ''
`` Why , <NAME> is much the same , miss .
There existed proofs -- proofs long suppressed -- of his birth and parentage .
I have not the least idea .
‘ That I see , ’ observed the schoolmaster .
Hundreds of dead and dying .
`` And our lodger with you .
`` No idea of money , '' observed <NAME> .
Anything but his death , I told you from the first .
<NAME> Mrs. Wititterly broke ground next morning , during a pause in the novel-reading .
We were no longer alone .
I see the blots I threw upon it , faded away .
'Are you going to sit snoring there , all day ? '
'She 's a shaking the shroud at me !
In came Mrs. Fezziwig , one vast substantial smile .
Of a Orse ? ’ inquired the foreign gentleman .
He heerd it all , and see it all .
said <NAME> with a sigh .
‘ Again I ramble away from thinking it out to the end .
You can get me out , if you take me so .
But , oh , it do n't matter !
‘ “ Do ! ” replied the client , with sudden vehemence .
The <NAME> said the same , and looked and spoke remarkably like an Irishman .
What will be , will be .
It is what YOU do .
I can say <NAME> , which is a most respectable title .
<NAME> , and the <NAME> Time be praised for this !
‘ Can anything be finer or more delightful ? ’ he inquired of <NAME> .
‘ Oh , that ’ s nothing , ’ said <NAME> .
The people are all alike , too .
Drink a little drop o ’ this here , ’ said the <NAME> .
`` Have you anything to say to me ? ''
You don ’ t know <NAME> .
‘ I ’ m sorry for it , ’ said <NAME> .
I am here , in a position of trust .
‘ What ’ s the use of this ? ’ he demanded .
At once a short cut and a broad road .
'She has not moved , and will not till we are gone . '
' I can do that pretty well , I know , ' said <NAME> .
There seemed to be a near affinity between us .
I might have felt happier if I had been .
`` Was Miss Barbary at all connected with your ladyship 's family ? ''
‘ Then you knew the man before ? ’ ‘ Not before ; afterwards .
Show 'em how you scratch .
‘ No , sir , I haven ’ t , ’ replied the boy .
'Wot 's come of young Bates ? '
‘ Have you come far this morning , gentlemen ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
Everybody who comes in , is glad to know him .
<NAME> counted as nobody , and she was by .
So ‘ tis with her little bonnets and that .
You took him under your roof . ''
Why , take a look at ‘ em and see .
But no ; ’ said <NAME> , stopping short .
The base word money should never be breathed near it ! ''
'Yes , ' said the Jew , as suddenly rousing himself .
You heroine ! ’ Her own eyes filled under his praises .
`` You see what he is ! ''
`` I think I am , miss , '' she replied .
<NAME> , I never heard of him ! ''
What has brought Mrs. Rouncewell to town so unexpectedly ?
'Lend a hand to the girl , ca n't you ? '
I must get back quickly . '
Hastily cloaked and muffled , and stealing away .
All places are alike to me , sir .
and I may say uncle too , all in one .
But I must go elsewhere and seek what I have not found here .
`` He 's in all manner of places , all at wanst . ''
<NAME> <NAME> 's eye comes back and meets <NAME> 's eye .
He brought his gun with him , as a curiosity .
I would unhesitatingly mention <NAME> .
We thought you were dead ! ’ ‘ Not yet , ’ said <NAME> .
He immediately looked at the dish and began to carve .
It had remained so for a long time .
`` To whom will our debt be transferred ? ''
replied the man , glaring at the opposite wall .
‘ I wish we had gone before .
‘ Stand out of the way , dog .
Why should <NAME> be cross ?
But it might have done , if he could have read them .
Yes , I see my way now , right on . ''
Is that it ? ’ said the schoolmaster .
‘ I blame him for not living an hour longer .
What we have said tonight is never to be said more .
`` Nor I , '' said <NAME> moodily .
Who did you want , ma ’ am ? ’ ‘ Miss Dorrit .
'Do you hear his worship ask if you 've anything to say ? '
“ Take it in your right hand .
We have all been mistaken over and over again .
Mr Carker presently tried a canter ; <NAME> was still in attendance .
‘ You may consider yourself very fortunate in having escaped him so easily .
<NAME> nothing of money questions .
‘ I am sure you would not .
If <NAME> ’ r was here -- ’ ‘ Ah !
She had obeyed without a murmur .
You ’ ll ask me how I make out about the pockets ?
'Look at his togs , <NAME> ! '
<NAME> was my intimate companion and friend .
Oh , haven ’ t I got him !
‘ I am not doing office-work , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
And <NAME> said , decidedly , yes he did .
I seem to have been gone a twelvemonth !
<NAME> <NAME> hereupon addressed me again .
`` No offence , sir , '' said <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> , sir , ’ he said , taking it back .
I had kept <NAME> 's flowers .
he ’ s a doing beautiful ! ’ responded <NAME> .
‘ Say what you like , ’ answered <NAME> .
I were a coming to ’ t .
It was dated an hour and a half before dinner .
‘ Show me one , and try , ’ rejoined <NAME> .
I am Mr <NAME> ’ s Secretary .
The poor room was a happy room that morning .
I will mention the matter to-morrow morning when I take my seat . ''
Every petty tradesman is to begin to pity her now , is he ?
But I have not the present means of raising the sum you have demanded .
‘ Oh , of course , ’ said <NAME> .
How glad he is to see us !
He had found Coavinses in his way .
What proof had he of this ?
“ Doctor Manette , look upon the prisoner .
And yet he was so terrible a man !
And why , my young friend ? ''
Everything seemed altered as he ran along the streets .
She slightly showed me her arm , and it was fearfully thin indeed .
`` Am I to read it now ? ''
<NAME> was close upon him , and looked round the door too .
He was merely collecting himself to speak very plainly .
The waiter retired , considerably astonished , and <NAME> motioned <NAME> to a seat .
‘ I do , indeed , ’ replied <NAME> .
It is disgraceful to the electors .
I have never pampered myself , and should not be ill .
I could have made my profit .
“ 'Do you honour me with your attention , <NAME> ? '
‘ You can , if you like , you know , ’ said <NAME> .
I shall come home when I please , and go when I please .
‘ I won ’ t be silent , ’ returned the nurse .
“ He keeps his grog ready mixed in a little tub on the table .
Three tumbrils faring away with their dread loads over the hushing snow .
A fish of the sea or river ?
`` Secondly , what will satisfy you for the trouble of producing it ? ''
‘ Yes , ’ said my mother , faintly .
‘ Did she tell you why ? ’ I inquired .
You needn ’ t tell me that , <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> ! ’ said I , going to it .
Such brains are fertile in expedients .
It also sends missionaries from hence among the <NAME> tribes .
I know what men they are from whom these schemes have come .
And how well that delightful old soul Mrs. Rouncewell is looking .
You ’ re a ready money man .
'There is nothing unusual in that , ' said the gentleman .
'What do you think would suit me now ?
`` Because you 'll come to that if you do n't look out .
‘ Oh Di , you bad , forgetful dog !
A merry Christmas to you , sir ! ''
What do we find , Mr Lightwood ?
‘ The two youngest are only nine and ten .
inquired <NAME> , fixing his eyes on the Jew .
The silence was at length broken by <NAME> .
Who would have thought it !
I have just been hearing of you .
We thank you with all our hearts , and all our love and duty .
“ Well ? ” said my sister , in her snappish way .
Upon my honour , I will keep your secret .
Either their beauty or the beauty of her arms is particularly attractive to <NAME> .
Nor do they see it any more that day .
said the man , pushing her towards the door .
‘ You will not be rid of me so easily , I promise you .
What wonder that days became as years in knitting them together !
‘ What did you think of her , now ?
I declare if I was Pa , I 'd run away . ''
<NAME> was plainly disconcerted , and alarmed besides .
‘ By your informant , if you have one .
`` Love him like a brother !
‘ What do you mean by a pike-keeper ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
“ <NAME> tract of marshes about here , I believe ? ” said <NAME> .
‘ Back , ma ’ am -- back ! ’ said the editor .
‘ I ’ ll never forget you , ’ pursued <NAME> .
Bring the matter clearly before yourself , mother .
‘ There ! ’ said Mr Meagles , throwing open his arms .
Do it now , or <NAME> is no longer so .
The service commenced with a hymn , to which succeeded an extemporary prayer .
They 'll never expect to nab me there , after this country scent .
Perhaps I HAVE allowed myself to brood too much .
With a pretty little party laid along with the other party .
Very like Jo and his order ; very , very like !
‘ What is that ? ’ cried the child , earnestly .
The wind 's getting round again , I am afraid .
And a very handsome sum of money too , I think .
‘ Pratty nigh for the prasant time , sir , ’ replied <NAME> .
‘ No one can harm him now , ’ she said .
<NAME> <NAME> was not to be found .
What other course was left to take ?
‘ Where are the birds ? ’ asked <NAME> .
‘ Sit down. ’ The Secretary sat down .
cried <NAME> , with ill-feigned enthusiasm , 'or is that little Oliver ?
Unless you weep with pleasure to see me .
‘ But the space , ’ urged the grey-haired gentleman .
She was dry and sandy with working in the graves of deceased languages .
Then he added behind his hand , [ ‘ Union , poor old fellow .
I am sure you wo n't betray me .
Mr Inspector watched the proceedings too , and kept his watching closely to himself .
The office was a front parlour , with a panelled wall .
A few minutes brought them to <NAME> 's destination .
At this moment , a low knocking at the cabin-door arrested his attention .
‘ <NAME> is quite well , <NAME> , ’ Susan would add .
The banners were very well painted , and flaunted down the street famously .
'Not to be done at all ! '
`` Yes , I am afraid so , <NAME> . ''
I am above the rest of mankind in such a case as that .
And really he did look very like it .
‘ He ’ s a deal pleasanter without his senses than with ‘ em .
‘ Rides rather rusty , ’ said <NAME> , with a smile .
‘ No , I should hope not !
But don ’ t you tell my father !
`` Not to be wondered at ! ''
I leave no other charge with you . ''
It was his naval way of mentioning my eyes . ''
You have received some considerable education already .
Take me as I am , and make the best of me . ''
‘ I ’ m very glad indeed to hear it , ’ said <NAME> .
He married -- an <NAME> lady -- and I was one of the trustees .
`` <NAME> will look us up , '' says <NAME> .
The thing itself is an exaggeration of nastiness , which can not be outdone .
‘ Decidedly not good , ’ says <NAME> .
`` Passed through here on foot this evening about eight or nine .
The impossibility of keeping him concealed in the chambers was self-evident .
<NAME> , however , have been <NAME> and not Mind .
His condition is a desperate one , <NAME> ’ am .
said the girl , stopping suddenly .
'Have you nothing to say to me ? '
‘ You make pincushions , ’ said <NAME> .
What is the spike that intervenes , and who has set it up ?
‘ Yo-yo-yo-yo-yoe ! ’ went the first boy .
She always has done it .
`` They tell me there was no one here . ''
‘ Excellent , ’ returned the mild man , becoming bold on his success .
He would n't catch anybody else .
‘ Oh , no , Sir. ’ ‘ Very good .
We are all quite well , and <NAME> improves every day .
There is not much business done .
The next has no date whatever , which is in itself suspicious .
I know he will , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , with energy .
I am far from strong .
How do you do , <NAME> ?
‘ And <NAME> ? ’ added <NAME> .
The door of the cell opened , and the attendants returned .
‘ Is this anything that I can do ? ’ ( <NAME> !
‘ Yes , sir , ’ returned the boy .
‘ He ’ s coming to himself , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Acquit me of impertinent curiosity , my dear Mrs. Bounderby .
‘ I believe you ’ re right , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ I know it , ’ replied <NAME> , surveying him through his spectacles .
He came in my way at last .
You had better say it .
There you ’ re a little bit fast .
`` Stow cutting away , you know ! ''
Could not possibly have been better , ’ replied <NAME> .
How did I first know it myself ?
I _did_ sell them , and they 're where you 'll never get them .
‘ <NAME> , <NAME> , she never wrapped up enough .
He therefore terminated the entertainment at the end of the third bottle .
‘ This -- this , ’ said he , ‘ determines me .
I knew that <NAME> would come to me in my room .
Gradually , an unhappy shadow fell upon her beauty , and deepened every day .
It ’ s wery pleasant for the prospects .
Do you play ? ” “ No ! ” returned the spy .
The more he represses it , the more unjust he necessarily is .
And he eyed the Boffins with implacable eyes .
As it was , I took the path that led close by it .
We had heard nothing of him since he went away , that sunny afternoon .
“ Seems you have been out after such ? ” asked the stranger .
I ’ ll bring you out , and your friend too .
It was a sorrowful farewell .
'You -- you -- will be secret with me ? '
`` There 's only a few words more . ''
My young friend , what is bondage ?
I should wish it to be so deliberately said , and so deliberately considered .
Baffled boots from the vexed souls of disappointed outsiders .
And everything a going on so well !
What if I had seen him rush away , mad , in pursuit ?
When I come down , I ’ ll bring <NAME> with me .
sometimes arise in the best-regulated Families .
<NAME> <NAME> was there , before us .
She writhes under her life .
But the pleasure has outweighed the pain .
They are very charming apartments , sir .
The other name ’ s Hexam. ’ <NAME> bent his head in assent .
‘ Pray take me , ’ said <NAME> .
But what will you take ?
And am I to grovel in the dust for <NAME> to walk over ?
It came to <NAME> in his adversity , strongly and tenderly .
You are free to go , and we to follow .
You yourself wouldn ’ t hear of <NAME> , you very well know .
Tell me no more just now , or I might do it again .
‘ It was all there was , ’ returned my aunt .
He is making believe that he thinks of her good and not his own .
How do you do , sir ? ” and shook hands .
<NAME> this iron on my sore leg !
Still , the <NAME> walked among the terrors with a steady head .
‘ I know something of that hand , too .
Not that I reproach myself .
“ Do n't be alarmed , my dear <NAME> .
Mr <NAME> made in reply , a comic speech chequered with sentiment .
What would he do with coals ?
He and his deaf assistant were sitting before the fire .
What a rattle I am !
And I did hope it might just hint a caution .
I hear <NAME> moving too .
‘ Thank you , ’ said <NAME> .
If he takes and sends me out I must go .
But remember , my dear , your future is between you two .
‘ I was never up the river , ’ added <NAME> .
I do n't come in to stare about me .
I come to the second .
<NAME> , of your own noble will , to a ruined man !
‘ I find it so , ’ replied the man .
Two ; four ; and two is six , ’ measuring on the pavement .
My good mother lived in the country . ''
He reached the yard ; and his passion vanished in a moment .
‘ <NAME> ’ t let him go alone ! ’ screamed the females .
Being left to himself , the savage had a dance , all alone .
‘ You decline to answer , do you ?
`` I 've got a high pair as belonged to mother . ''
‘ Your father can be free within this week .
I am only unfortunate to have come in the way .
<NAME> at them , '' glancing at the sleepers on the ground .
And so , as <NAME> observed , <NAME> bless <NAME> , Every One !
Filled with this idea , he advanced at once , but stealthily .
And then the dream grew dim , and faded .
But I -- I am afraid there ’ s something the matter with them .
One of the officers brought it to me as a curiosity .
I rather thought he might have been here today , sir .
The moment he ceased , she looked at him again .
He shook my hand and said no more .
The swarm and buzz , and going up and down , endure for days .
‘ That was my speculation , <NAME> .
So forget and forgive all round , <NAME> .
It is a handsome city , but distractingly regular .
Let me raise your head .
Two taps were now heard on the outside of the window .
`` Yes , so you did say about ten .
She has rather a scaly appearance .
`` It is close at hand .
Better than any novel-book _I_ ever see ! '
How much more to hers !
He would bear nothing but his pride .
<NAME> on the part of <NAME> .
But all these occurrences preceded the final day .
Her pensive form was not long idle at the door .
I am getting old , <NAME> , and have lost nearly all my nails .
It will be better done without my being by .
That , this patriot would be produced before them .
He was left to himself , however , and there was comfort in that .
What would they have contracted ?
You fall into that habit , and then who notices or minds ?
It ’ s a world of change .
He wants to see some fragment in <NAME> 's writing .
‘ Yes , yes , ’ says the other .
`` Mrs. Chadband -- this gentleman 's wife -- Reverend Mr .
`` If she is , she has reason to be .
‘ Can ’ t be done , sir , ’ returned <NAME> .
When that person discloses , my part in this business will cease and determine .
Do n't deceive yourself , my dear .
This last discovery was made by the two friends in pursuing their inquiries .
<NAME> James he began to be restless again .
What is your remark on that proportion ?
We were speaking of <NAME> Minster just now .
That I assert no cause whatever of complaint against her .
YOU have got YOUR nose out of joint .
You ought to be ashamed of yourself .
Of sunset once again , and nightfall .
O , I don ’ t think so .
`` But is the secret safe so far ? ''
' I hope not , sir , ' said Mrs. Bedwin .
‘ I ’ m glad to hear it , ’ returned the other .
There is a magic in the sound .
<NAME> , with fresh tears , kneels at her feet and kisses her hand .
They saw the vault covered , and the stone fixed down .
It makes me shiver , <NAME> .
It must be the theme of general conversation .
She asked and gave no quarter .
‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> complacently .
‘ What have I been a-doing of ? ’ asked <NAME> .
But thou know ’ st our old agreement .
In this manner they were fed at the discretion of their master .
<NAME> <NAME> hurries to the landing and calls , `` <NAME> !
‘ It ’ s very kind of you .
And speaking of <NAME> ( ah , poor <NAME> !
All I desire , <NAME> , is , that it should be forgotten .
‘ Dead , <NAME> ? ’ I hinted , after a respectful pause .
Here ’ s a match , and now where ’ s the candle ?
I am sorry to see you sitting in the street . ''
The storm soon began to pass upon its way .
I could be here in the day , and turn in the night .
You and I are very different creatures . ''
I am sure I shall be very happy to show <NAME> to you .
'You 're very , very kind to me , ma'am , ' said <NAME> .
`` I intend to , <NAME> , '' replies the other .
`` Why do you point away ? ''
‘ Pray , my dear , allow me to conclude .
I think about a great many things , ’ replied <NAME> .
I suppose they have not done trying on yet .
“ They ai n't worth much , then .
He flung him in , bolted it , and turned the key .
‘ You are a happy fellow .
There they stand yet , without the motion of a hand .
His cold and distant nature had neither sought one , nor found one .
“ No , I don ’ t , ” says the man .
Diwisions among such must come , and must be met as they come .
“ I am going to tell you .
<NAME> on our staircase and read .
Where was I brought from ? ’ Boldwig !
This is the separation that there is between us !
Have you no remembrance of what has been said between us ?
And now let me take the liberty of asking you a question .
‘ I was going on with the little I had left to say .
I only wish I wos , myself .
`` I take it as a compliment . ''
He was the stateliest man in the company .
‘ What friend o ’ yourn is dead ? ’ asks <NAME> .
‘ Where ’ s the reason for it ?
‘ And ye steer with a rudder , don ’ t ye ?
“ Where are you going to , at <NAME> ? ” I asked <NAME> .
But never mind him now .
You see the rock that lies in his course .
Therefore <NAME> gave two knocks .
‘ To hang himself ! ’ cried <NAME> again .
I should not be at all surprised if he called to-day .
`` Then grant me this one great favour .
`` Do n't say that , do n't say that .
`` And was christened so , my dear , '' said <NAME> .
A dense justice in a corner is beguiled into a wink .
‘ Then give me your hand , ’ retorted <NAME> .
‘ When we worked like the neighbours , we suited one another .
A <NAME> on My Way LXIII .
Nothing but a gentleman , <NAME> ! '
‘ Having your likeness taken , sir , ’ replied the stout turnkey .
<NAME> waited for the last stroke , and then knocked .
`` Repeal it , my dear sir ?
The low arched door then opened , and the face came out .
I have not the power . ''
‘ Come on ! ’ said the cab-driver , sparring away like clockwork .
asked <NAME> , anxiously regarding him .
The influence pervaded the spirit in which they returned to the previous question .
Go on , Sammy. ’ ‘ “ Lovely creetur , ” ’ repeated <NAME> .
The touch had its instantaneous effect .
<NAME> as if she knew all about it , do n't she ?
‘ Forgive me ; I could not help saying that .
‘ Please let me hold the pens , ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> V. A Morning Adventure VI .
‘ Halloa ! ’ cried a voice inside .
I shall never get its name now .
How do you do , <NAME> ?
‘ I would rather go alone , thank you .
<NAME> , the uncle , commands the nephew to marry .
There are Podsnap the <NAME> , and <NAME> .
Her husband had no relations , and she was rich .
‘ Yes , ’ said <NAME> , biting his lip .
Mrs General conceded that high privilege , and here she was .
We have not half enough as it is .
At last , the <NAME> read himself into a light slumber .
If ever there were love in the world , I love her .
My deary , show me a better !
It will be like coming to the old <NAME> again . ''
I have no false pride .
I should think her like me .
Every one must. ’ ‘ I hope so , ’ said the cherub .
Still <NAME> said , think of the situation !
‘ And vere is <NAME> ? ’ inquired the old gentleman .
<NAME> <NAME> smoothed his head and face , and stood looking at the fire .
‘ I am pretty much as usual , sir , ’ replied <NAME> .
`` It does her credit , Mat ! ''
`` For to-day , I have , my friend .
‘ I ha ’ n ’ t got a glass , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ May I ask where it happened , Mr Twemlow ?
‘ <NAME> , I am going home .
`` You know what you have got to do .
I thank you for the question .
He means plain <NAME> , <NAME> -- <NAME> -- Josh .
‘ I am , sir , ’ replied <NAME> .
Why , applause from the house when you first come on .
‘ For the “ How ” I come to you .
‘ <NAME> , sir , ’ repeated the gentleman haughtily .
It is good , until recalled .
His luck ’ s got fouled under the keels of the barges .
He may not deserve it , for we know no certain ill of him .
Mr Plornish could not conceal his exultation in her accomplishments as a linguist .
None of them ever pay .
‘ You have thrown yourself away , ’ said <NAME> , shaking his head .
‘ I am unhappily a widower , ’ said I .
I said , ‘ Near <NAME> , ’ which was all I knew .
“ <NAME> , is bad enough , ” returned <NAME> , “ but better .
I make a respectable income by it .
I was not aware that anything was wrong .
Suddenly the door was unlocked on the inside , and flung violently open .
‘ Are you better now , mother ? ’ asked one of the women .
He ’ s as like his Papa as he can be .
‘ You ’ ll have as much as I shall .
A rap at the door startled him in this occupation .
He had made one step towards it , before he checked himself .
We ’ re positively getting on , you know .
<NAME> would only say then , that he repelled the hon .
‘ Coolish ! ’ observed <NAME> , stirring the fire .
If I were not dumb , you would be deaf .
Many and many a time had my fingers longed to tear him .
'Then you return my love ? '
So , whether he lives or dies , what does it come to ?
But , somehow , it had all failed .
That 's my view of such things , speaking as a child ! ''
‘ You ’ re quite a stranger ! ’ ‘ Yes .
‘ Why , <NAME> ! ’ she added with astonishment , seeing him first .
All regret will be unavailing , and deep and bitter it must be .
‘ No offence , sir , ’ said <NAME> , humbly .
`` Did you hear me ask you where you have come from ? ''
This is indeed an acquisition .
You observe that I say , I suppose .
‘ <NAME> ’ t be hard upon him , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
You were talking of tampering , just now .
And all in the house did the same .
‘ Very sorry ! ’ said the furious magistrate .
Anyways we will hope so now .
‘ No , my dear , ’ replied the collector , ‘ no .
He ’ s what you may call a rasper , is <NAME> .
We pushed off again , and made what way we could .
The account is now favourably balanced : my creditor has accepted a composition .
and the bedpost was his own .
I thought of our house shut up and hushed .
There was a pair of trousers there .
The Evening of a <NAME> Day 25 .
`` But nothing that might not be sent to a pattern young lady ? ''
<NAME> is the best policy. -- I always find it so myself .
I _do_ understand you before you pint it out .
I am sure you know me better .
Agnes and hospitality prevailed , however , and I conducted him to my fireside .
‘ All of a sudden the coach stopped .
You are shocked , I dare say !
‘ Him ! ’ said the little fellow .
I have another motive in coming : a motive of humanity .
Indeed I don ’ t reproach you .
According to the immemorial usage of waiters in all ages .
'But I will tell you , ' retorted <NAME> .
They were <NAME> and <NAME> .
Upon which door the turnkey knocked with the handle of his key .
They need to charge for dooble-latthers .
‘ Well , I never ! ’ ejaculated the cook .
And not silly ? ’ said my aunt .
<NAME> ’ t you know she has ?
It does as well as anything else , for a time .
The conversation was here interrupted by a moan from the sick woman .
You ’ re casting your eye round the shop , Mr Wegg .
That she couldn ’ t help it .
Have I a friend here ?
Four hims and a her .
I was such a silly little creature !
I was a ’ most as well as I was .
Mr <NAME> was resolved to show her that he was supreme .
And I ’ ll tell you why , <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> seats himself upon another .
<NAME> had known it , and seen it , without looking at her .
That ’ s going according to the <NAME> , that is. ’ ‘ Mr .
said I , pretending to consider .
‘ Come here , sir ! ’ said <NAME> , beckoning to me .
'Ai n't you afraid of it , sir ?
Ever forgiving and ever affable .
She could have stabbed him -- poisoned him safely .
To become a Guppy is the object of his ambition .
‘ Good evening , godmother ! ’ said <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> him about the <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ They wanted all the happiness to come together .
But that you have gathered already ?
‘ I speak to you for the sake of others .
So cold , so lonely , so dreary all !
The continued kindness of her sister was this comfort to <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> and submissively , ’ returned the tragedian , scowling upwards .
I acquiesced , of course , knowing nothing to the contrary .
You don ’ t know what my state of mind towards you is .
'It must have been something , love , ' urged <NAME> .
said he with his bright clear eyes on mine .
I can not rest until I know that we are not too late .
says <NAME> , transferring his cross-examination .
Apart from any inclinations of my own , I understood <NAME> 's hint now .
The Captain never lost dignity , from having his ears boxed with the <NAME> .
‘ She will try to do well , ’ said little Em ’ ly .
<NAME> , was that you calling me ?
‘ -- that I will make no pretence of concealment .
I could hardly make them quarrel with me .
The second , that her brother had not made an effort .
Very few loose papers are about .
because he suffered her to lead him .
The ironmaster repeats her expression with a little emphasis .
He swallowed a glassful and took up the paper again .
They would have scorned the action .
‘ This will soon be over now , dear Mr Clennam .
Another knock , and still no answer .
Allow me to catch you round the neck .
The schoolmeasther agin all <NAME> .
I knew his voice very well .
But <NAME> said she was , and she said it decisively .
Nod away at him , <NAME> ; that 's what he likes .
“ My own doing , ” said <NAME> .
You can come at night .
It was unnecessary caution surely , and might have defeated itself .
‘ What will you do ? ’ she asked him .
All is for her sake .
I know my cue ; smart is the word .
He has no idea of the value of money .
We never make company of you .
‘ The usual thing ! ’ observed <NAME> .
But he was sleeping soundly , and she softly withdrew .
'What the devil made you stand lingering there , in the wet ? '
‘ I hope they may become so , ’ replied <NAME> .
He made quite a sister of me .
<NAME> farewells were exchanged , and the party separated .
You know what I mean as well as any man . ''
I am sure you would ! ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> was there , and in full force .
Also , the spoon is not generally used over-hand , but under .
I have told her so .
No , but she knew where the school was .
It ain ’ t because I don ’ t love you .
saw again , which has long been engraven on my heart .
At last I find it .
‘ Never in my life , ’ replied the cobbler .
I owe so much to him .
At the garden-gate of one of these he stopped , and <NAME> alighted .
`` You 're a friend in need .
Where ’ s your more than mother ?
We sat in the dark for some time , breathless .
Without entering into further explanations , I may repeat that the idol is down .
I must clear my unfortunate partner ’ s reputation .
The sea had ebbed and flowed , through a whole year .
The sound was too much for Mr Mantalini .
‘ This is a pollis case , is it ?
`` Oh , <NAME> , you would never guess ! ''
It ’ s no use my lagging on so far behind it .
My uncle woke , rubbed his eyes , and jumped up in astonishment .
I should rather think I did .
`` Indeed I am , my Lady .
<NAME> haste down , and come out .
We began badly , and went on worse .
I took the indentures out of his hand and gave them to <NAME> .
The <NAME> sat in his study chair , covering his face with his hands .
We proceeded without a word being spoken .
I never see such a chap to eat and drink -- never .
‘ Well then , ’ replied <NAME> , ‘ I ’ m satisfied .
What have they done with my work ?
‘ By <NAME> , you are right , <NAME> .
‘ I would rather not ask , but the question is imposed upon me .
I put such questions to <NAME> as , When did the man come in ?
All men are not gifted alike .
‘ No , indeed , ’ returned his daughter .
‘ Who is it ? ’ asked <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> looked serious instantly .
That 's all I know , ' said <NAME> .
‘ -- K. then positively refused to sign .
‘ No , sir , ’ said Mr Meagles , shaking his head ruefully .
‘ And yet you took it very much to heart , ’ said <NAME> .
`` It is fifty years old . ''
You ought to see it out , and I won ’ t leave you .
<NAME> <NAME> alone could enter into my feelings thoroughly .
<NAME> ! ’ exclaimed the old lady , starting .
It shall and must be spoken .
she said on a sudden .
It would be a poor thing to gratify a prejudice against him .
Defer this marriage for a week .
I would transact your business with people in your pay or employment .
‘ And what is your name , my pale child ? ’ said <NAME> .
“ What is to be done with you ?
You know Lagnier , the gentleman .
`` I beg your pardon , grandmother .
He is a child -- an absolute child .
My guardian asked him what he meant .
‘ I give you joy , Mr Toots ! ’ says old Sol .
Unnatural emotion in a child , innocent of wrong !
<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> divide the dignity of the office .
A considerable scuffling within ensued , but nothing else .
‘ My sweetest Edith ! ’ cries an agitated voice upon the stairs .
`` I want five hundred pound . ''
‘ Is there room for me ? ’ said I .
I am a honest man , that ’ s what I am .
<NAME> would bring Emily at the usual hour .
‘ It is but one room you see .
Prejudiced , I never have been otherwise than in favour of the <NAME> .
“ That 's the name for a thousand pound ! ” cried <NAME> .
<NAME> given to detail are the beggars who make sporting ventures .
The two sons grew up as parsimonious as their sire .
Then why are we here , my friends ?
We must make amends for this as soon as we can .
He found a likeness to his misfortune everywhere .
<NAME> ’ s letter had gone , <NAME> ’ s letter had been delivered .
Those who had been kind to them , did not escape his search .
‘ Do you see him here now ? ’ said the judge .
Behold him in pepper-and-salt pantaloons , with his watch-guard round his neck .
‘ Say he dreamt it , ’ replied <NAME> coolly .
`` You may read it in the whole room .
There is a light in each .
'Work'us , ' said <NAME> , 'how 's your mother ? '
It began to rain , heavily , at the moment .
He stops there , looks round , and beckons Jo .
She had been to the theayter .
One was taken from me , with a warning , yesterday .
‘ And how did you know I was here ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
It was a rimy morning , and very damp .
‘ Thou and I are free of it now , <NAME> .
He turned over the leaves .
By resolving not to set right the wrong he did you .
But not because I repent of what I have said to you .
Let me wet your lips again , and your forehead .
<NAME> said he was ready for anything .
‘ What was it that you asked me ?
With which the head disappeared , and the door closed .
I owe it , alike to others , and to myself . '
I have got other plans for this house .
‘ It never could have been bewitching , <NAME> .
Take hold of this cup and saucer , ostler .
YOUR name now will be -- '' `` <NAME> . ''
<NAME> <NAME> has joined your father ’ s muster-roll .
Has been my late childhood ?
`` Have you got it here ? ''
A flash in the pan or a shot ? ''
I can keep this from <NAME> , only by buying him off .
`` I believe so , '' said <NAME> .
<NAME> departs in search of the iron gentleman , finds , and produces him .
At last I come to the sea .
`` IS he after his time ? ''
It would be sentimental , perhaps ?
I pass to worse news .
I have never told you , <NAME> , of her mother .
‘ I ’ ll try hard , dear mother , now .
To the home of <NAME> ’ s Uncle .
<NAME> ! ’ But no <NAME> replied .
If so , the answer was indefinite and vague .
repeated <NAME> turning round in his chair to confront her .
You remember objecting to a word I used , as being too strong ?
cries the woman , almost breathless .
The fine little boy with the blister on his nose is the eldest .
`` I know little enough , I am sure , thanks to Ma !
Different from <NAME> t ’ other side the court .
Give me a rope , a long rope .
'Upon my word I was not , sir , ' replied <NAME> , earnestly .
and the old girl herself , accompanied by <NAME> , appears .
'Of course I know that , my dear .
You are a far more competent judge of such affairs than I am .
Oh , dear me , I 'm out of breath .
How she got from story to story was a mystery beyond solution .
‘ You had better let him go .
You are going to try matrimony .
‘ <NAME> vexation , <NAME> ? ’ asked the benignant father .
The <NAME> had next to consider where and why ?
I see you pitch your <NAME> ’ s bundle into the river .
‘ As I supposed from his not sending ! ’ thought <NAME> .
Full of such thoughts , they turned into the long and sombre street .
I have no address , sir .
I only put it to yourself , sir . ''
‘ And how did you leave <NAME> , reverend sir ? ’ said <NAME> .
And was it a hopeful or a promising thing anywhere ?
No matter who invites you to stay elsewhere .
‘ What is the matter ? ’ asked the visitor again .
Now has he made atonement to you -- with his life !
`` Not just at present , my Lady . ''
Had n't you better go to bed ? ''
‘ That ’ s my handsome daughter , ’ said the old woman .
I showed it to him now , and he admired it highly .
You are , at least , as avaricious as you are revengeful .
That is according as the young gentleman has his original character formed .
‘ When did I come here ?
I had forgotten my threat .
Dear heart alive , how his niece by marriage started !
We had better go in. ” He recovered himself almost instantly .
She answered , looking all the while at her husband for leave .
‘ Say you are sure I didn ’ t mean to .
But <NAME> is not alone to-night to ponder at his usual length .
<NAME> looks aghast at <NAME> .
You wonder to hear me say A lady .
<NAME> ’ t go prancing and capering about !
Has the difficulty grown easier because of so many failures ? ''
So we all are , down to the dog .
cried the man ; 'it wo n't answer here .
Let him remember it in that room , years to come !
I would oppose her in everything , and compete with her .
When <NAME> was singing in the dark room ? ''
These are my fears , and these fears I found upon your own demeanour .
said <NAME> , rising with his high-shouldered bow .
And all friends is no backerder , if not no forarder .
It gave me the most inconsistent opinions of her .
If it had not been <NAME> , it would have been another .
He could not do it .
Who is he ? ’ His hair had latterly began to change its colour .
On examination , however , they turned out to be strictly correct .
I have attained the dignity of twenty-one .
She is out. ’ ‘ Indeed , sir ? ’ ‘ Yes , <NAME> .
Try , that ’ s a dear soul !
Has almost read a page in twenty miles .
‘ Well , I think it is , ’ said <NAME> .
There never was such a goose .
I laid out twenty pound upon it .
<NAME> trembled , and got a little nearer to the ruler .
Defamation of character : action for damages .
‘ What do you mean ? ’ returned the angry mother .
Begin at once. ’ ‘ Certainly I will .
This is an extraordinary day in my calendar .
What do you want to conwey to your own father , you young Rip ?
‘ Yes , of course you did !
said the gentleman who had spoken first .
<NAME> guarded and more trustful ?
It is made of bad intentions too .
He wonders what he did it for .
The wine flowed freely , as indeed it had done all day .
Let me stay a little while ! ''
I live here with my brother .
I wish to lead up to it by degrees .
He could make no way at all .
To return to my memorandum .
Do you , though ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
`` You were going to say , thirdly ? ''
`` Pray be careful of yourself , miss .
No warmth could warm , no wintry weather chill him .
`` And to attend the court no more ? ''
I suppose your loyalty to <NAME> will allow that ? ''
And his hammer is handed him .
For that brief time , his face is knitted and stern .
How can I think of you as being on equal terms with me ?
His windows are dark and quiet , and his door is shut .
<NAME> is a fine fellow .
I believed that the <NAME> was right , and I had no worse suspicions .
<NAME> ’ r , as is already in your business !
But this was its usual aspect .
he said abruptly and fiercely .
You belong to much brighter and better scenes .
‘ Thank you , ’ said Mrs. Micawber .
On the Day of Judgment .
‘ Well , <NAME> , ’ said the young fellow aloud .
of money ? ’ ‘ No , no , no .
‘ That and to get a writing to be fust-hand <NAME> .
The watches seemed to jostle , and to trip each other up .
They were at <NAME> , and the river rolled on their left .
as ghostly to the touch as to the sight !
Mr Dombey walks up to the drawing-room , to bide his time .
Turns the key upon her , mistress . ''
The very picture of a man whom nothing could move or soften .
And take care they do not spoil you by flattery , child ! ''
_You'll_ pay for this , my fine fellers .
None of that till one ’ s obliged to do it , sir .
So it is , and such is life .
‘ Stand by and knock again .
`` I do n't know how long I 've been among the Spirits .
You remember dear little <NAME> , before he went to school ?
`` It 's very little at present , <NAME> .
‘ Am I right ? ’ said the <NAME> .
A most difficult position to carry off .
‘ Well , she ’ s unsettled at present , ’ said <NAME> .
Coming out of his fit of grief , he clenched his pocket-handkerchief once more .
What was it that he told thee ?
‘ She ’ s a fine creature , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ It can ’ t be helped you know .
<NAME> say a word till thou ’ st droonk it a ’ !
hear ! ’ said the smoking gentleman , in the <NAME> jewellery .
The <NAME> stopped ; the hand was pointed elsewhere .
There he is , you see !
O , you must take the purse !
I feel a particular interest in being acquainted with it .
<NAME> Leicester is there , and she wishes to speak to him first .
How can they go well together ?
`` I really do n't , sir , '' I returned .
‘ Excuse me , ’ replied <NAME> , standing on the wheel .
‘ You have promised and vowed .
It does just as well as another .
Mr <NAME> has gone home long ago .
‘ It ’ s not put into his head to be buried .
Now he is struggling harder to get back .
At last , undressing himself with a gloomy resolution , he got into bed .
Oh , <NAME> , yes , it 's due east -- must be ! ''
I wanted you to come and stay a few days with us .
`` Not a bit , '' said <NAME> .
He mightn ’ t like it else.—Bazzard ! ’ <NAME> reappeared .
‘ Is that you ? ’ inquired Peg .
Then it stopped , and then went on , out of sight .
You will be reclaimed and formed .
Do not , my dear <NAME> , exert yourself .
There seem to be hands dragging me from the door .
‘ I will lead this life no longer .
But it was not my business .
‘ I believe it is , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
It was only now that I began to tremble .
I am sure of it .
I should like to see such a <NAME> anywhere else !
<NAME> <NAME> is here too , occasionally .
It is a very ill wind that blows nobody any good .
You had him there agin .
`` You have been everything I could desire , my love . ''
‘ That ’ s good sound argument , ’ said the placid man .
<NAME> <NAME> had lounged in , but he made only Two .
I have licensed this person .
Having now carried his point and insisted on it , he left off .
`` What wheels on such a day as this , for gracious sake ? ''
I could see nothing else but black darkness .
And thus jealousy gets into <NAME> 's Court , <NAME> .
I intend to take <NAME> .
He died soon after I left school. ’ ‘ Indeed ! ’ ‘ Yes .
'Do n't you seem to mind me .
‘ It ’ s hard work , ’ said <NAME> .
`` But there you have the man .
_We_ know something of that family , eh , <NAME> ?
<NAME> <NAME> was none of these .
It was the house that had been empty , years ago .
It only came from my heart .
You shall do exactly as you have been doing since we have been together .
He told you himself , I 'll be bound , my dear ? ''
The concern prospered , and the partners were fast friends .
Oh , a pretty sort of a man !
“ Is there any noise in the streets ? ” she asked him .
No vestige of any dead body was to be seen upon the floating fragments .
He remained moody , obstinate , and unmoved .
To whom said <NAME> , in her light-hearted surprise : ‘ Oh !
‘ It oughtn ’ t to be , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> gravely .
Your grandmama , <NAME> , was exactly the same -- precisely .
My conscience misgave me when I did it .
‘ And the dear pretty one ? ’ said <NAME> .
There ’ s cause enough now , or the deuce is in it .
Never you mind _me_ , if you please .
You and me know what we know , don ’ t we ?
Now , <NAME> , you have a wise head .
“ Show me the way he went .
None of the invaders remain .
I kept myself to myself and my thoughts .
She lies here all the day .
‘ Only <NAME> objects to the tunic. ’ ‘ He is right .
'You can easily take it away again , ' replied the matron .
I don ’ t think her country will , till she is dead .
It was the old girl that brought out my musical abilities .
Her face was very pale .
said the old lady , with tears in her eyes .
Whether intentionally or accidentally , I do n't know .
'Is there a little boy here ? '
Was the account you gave me just now strictly true ?
Put me down for anything you may consider right , and let me know .
One of them was always taking refreshment .
'Something in this way , old feller , ' said <NAME> .
Do n't let it give you a turn ?
‘ I -- I -- am used to be alone , ’ said <NAME> .
I do NOT love this gentleman .
We went down by the Mail .
I have saved him. ” VII .
Another man and two women come behind .
What ! ’ looking at it nearer .
What was merry Christmas to <NAME> ?
He can swim , can this man , and instantly he strikes out .
‘ Everybody knows that , ’ said the corpulent host .
I could not find that he was worse than I .
I would die to help you .
That I was lost in blissful delirium .
‘ The snuff-coloured suit , ’ said <NAME> , surveying a threadbare coat .
“ The ghosts that vanished when the wicket closed .
We used to keep such hours !
<NAME> <NAME> ’ s the man , <NAME> .
‘ Kinder and kinder than I can tell .
We must trust to you and time to set him right . ''
We are all going to the play , or coming home from it .
No ; yet something like it .
‘ Ha ha ! ’ he would cry .
echoed the Jew , leaning back in his chair .
Their objects were as various as their demands .
But all that I have to say in this way , I have said .
When she did look up , the expression was not there .
“ I know nothing of his life .
“ Thankee ! ” said <NAME> , rubbing his hands .
I am happy to see you .
`` Or unless she fancies it 's blood , '' said the woman .
`` But to pass from one subject to another , '' resumes <NAME> .
‘ What are you looking at ?
He took it in one of his , and kissed it , and withdrew .
<NAME> will be a ugly customer to you , if you do n't .
cried <NAME> , raising his voice .
If you had only sent in to me when they were here !
I doubt if he had ever once thought of it before .
cried Mrs. Mann , starting back .
I have been thinking that the law is the boy for me . ''
I knew a better way of going to work .
I should put 'em down at the figures of about eight and ten . ''
‘ ’ Twas kind of you to meet me .
We shall meet again soon .
The brothers give a Banquet on a great <NAME> .
‘ Nothing could be better , ’ said the father-in-law , rubbing his hands .
‘ It would be particularly comfortable , I think , ’ replied <NAME> .
I never knew such a thing .
‘ And you have -- when you catch it -- the <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> wanted 'em and got 'em , but I looked 'em over first .
‘ You have been betrayed , as all betrayers are .
“ This is very discouraging , ” said I .
No matter , <NAME> ; that would never do .
‘ What do you say , <NAME> ? ’ inquired Mrs. Squeers .
‘ What is the matter ? ’ said <NAME> to the boy .
( Captain <NAME> 's claret to your mistress , <NAME> ! )
Your money has changed you to marble .
<NAME> , with her innocent little scream , supposes so .
<NAME> don ’ t hurt the creature who is so fond of you !
Because she must have known whether it did or not .
* * * * * 'Stone dead ! '
<NAME> , both refer to Mr Clennam .
Unmindful of her stealthy tread , her victim holds his course in fancied triumph .
In this world you need meet no more . '
Morning after morning they roamed about the town together , pursuing this singular research .
He gladly agreed to hire it .
This done , he went on direct to <NAME> 's , and went in .
‘ Why do you answer it ? ’ was his reception of his brother .
‘ I mean the gentleman up-stairs , ’ said <NAME> , turning to <NAME> .
Stretched upon a mattress on the floor , lay <NAME> , fast asleep .
Not <NAME> ? ’ Then a second handsome face appearing .
He was the herald of the family procession .
<NAME> and <NAME> , together , upset the whole house directly .
`` May be , I have not . ''
Do I understand that you will take her with you ? ''
The woman ’ s was the first reached .
I was bad enough there , but I have been so much worse here .
‘ <NAME> finds it so , ’ she returned .
`` Friend and legal adviser , '' said <NAME> .
`` No , you do n't do yourself justice .
To which <NAME> says , `` Who 's conspiring ? ''
Which he did with his boots on , and an umbrella under his arm .
‘ Let him look to that !
A big , loud man , with a stare , and a metallic laugh .
‘ The reaction , my lord , the reaction , ’ said <NAME> .
I am very impressible myself , by nature .
I pass the greater part of the long vacation here .
I was afraid I had said something shocking .
'You do n't mean to say he died ? '
`` I rose in life that way . ''
<NAME> was there , sitting by the bed .
She laughs and talks , and seems to like it .
If I could ever set this right !
His only trouble was , the swift and rapid river .
‘ What a prophet you have shown yourself , <NAME> ! ’ pursued <NAME> .
Her visitor watched her as she did so .
`` Why is it best , sir ? ''
Touch him upon money , and you touch no booby then .
' I hope so , ' replied the child .
‘ Oh no ! ’ ‘ That ’ s well , ’ remarked <NAME> .
‘ Well , <NAME> ! ’ said the Major .
‘ I must admit the wine .
If I might embrace him once !
She did not raise her head .
<NAME> that boy ; he ’ s gone to sleep again .
I apologise. ’ ‘ Humbly and submissively ? ’ said <NAME> .
“ I have n't begun insuring yet , ” he replied .
‘ To-night we three will put up at a <NAME> .
said <NAME> , leading the way back .
'Not now , for the world , ' replied the young lady .
So should I. I was wrong .
‘ It ’ s prime meat , ’ rejoined his lady .
He was Mr Merdle ’ s last gift to <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> handed me in and took his own seat on the box .
‘ That ’ s real flesh and blood !
Or paid off -- like a ship 's company .
The scorer not committed , the scored debited with what is against him .
I am bound to say so now .
He would have taken his gaiters off his legs , to give away .
‘ Is your business done , <NAME> ? ’ inquired the lady .
I say what I mean .
The washing accommodations were primitive .
Ve-ry happy , I am sure ! ''
It sent the most insurrectionary tune into the world that was ever composed .
<NAME> faith in the deception was the first article of his creed .
`` And so have I , '' cried <NAME> .
I 'll have no feelings here .
<NAME> is quite clear that he had better not .
Perhaps that will be considered an acceptable course of proceeding .
'Yes , sir , rather thirsty , ' answered <NAME> .
This was bad , but not the worst .
Or if it was partly , was it wholly and entirely ?
Having no reply ready , he could do no better than embrace her .
then this is not my natural manner ? ’ she rejoined .
It only wants attending to .
I shall not fail to correspond .
‘ I am for <NAME> tonight .
You have no young child ? ''
No , <NAME> ! ’ shaking his head .
‘ You are very good , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Tell him I was hearty , and sent my respects .
' I heerd it now , quite apparent , ' resumed <NAME> .
I have no occasion to relate that I succeeded .
`` I presume this is your other ward , <NAME> ? ''
Let him rot there. ’ ‘ Certainly , sir .
<NAME> stock got into circulation .
You can ’ t put any confidence in him , sir .
I ’ ll be more communicative with you .
<NAME> ’ t that make a difference , <NAME> ?
And what do we live for but sympathy !
‘ See that the boiler ’ s full .
And then they began to fish .
He never came there heated with wine .
Take my word , it ’ s nothing whatever .
“ I 'm not a going back .
What if I were to turn too ?
‘ Little Kate <NAME> ’ were the words that caught his ear .
‘ If you please , ’ said she .
‘ Dear me ! ’ said Mr <NAME> , ‘ you too !
You have stood of your own strength ever since .
Few children were to be seen , and no dogs .
`` You girls are more trouble than you 're worth , by half . ''
'That 's for your people , ' said the guard .
‘ Dear me ! ’ said <NAME> .
What has brought you here ?
There was nobody at the chambers but <NAME> .
‘ You just come away , ’ said <NAME> .
Consequently you 're very far from wanting to give trouble .
‘ What <NAME> was that , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Lor !
‘ Be mine , be mine ! ’ cried the old gentleman .
The day changes as it wears itself away and becomes dark and drizzly .
Y. -- but really this was too bad !
‘ Thank you , ’ he returned , with fervour .
A fair profit is , of course , allowable . '
He is , I say again without disguise , a low mercenary wretch .
At least , Mr <NAME> seemed perfectly satisfied when he descried them on board .
‘ I have saved him , ’ she thought .
`` Only a matter of form , miss , '' returned the young gentleman .
'Meat , ma'am , meat , ' replied <NAME> , with stern emphasis .
<NAME> on my left ! ''
`` Yet , you silly little thing !
‘ Good morning , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> ; very coldly .
“ He first laughed at my words , and then frowned at them .
I pity you , and I despise you ! ''
<NAME> <NAME> is mightily curious in respect of the room .
Every house without a signal will be fired upon by the <NAME> troops .
You know M. R. F. , but not as well as I do .
He took her hair into his hand again , and looked closely at it .
‘ I do as I am bidden by my principal .
I stopped , and he came up breathless .
How much have I to be thankful for , in that !
As he stood there , waiting his arrival , the knocker caught his eye .
The dying ashes have no light to spare , and his endeavours are vain .
‘ He has only just come home .
It was his way in business , often .
Is there anything ? ’ ‘ Nothing , ’ she replied .
My poor , affectionate , failing Frederick !
He is very regular in his walks , is my son .
You 're my son , -- more to me nor any son .
There was another thing the woman did .
Most people are when they ’ ve little to do and less to get .
said the young man , eagerly .
It may turn even means as unexpected and unpromising as these , to account .
‘ What do you mean to do ?
The ironmaster , repressing his amused smile , assents .
I am perfectly honest and outspoken .
<NAME> not yet a while !
‘ Would you believe it ! ’ he said .
You _mutht_ have uth , <NAME> .
and <NAME> , <NAME> agean , ’ replied the Yorkshireman .
How could they have a place in the shadowy conceptions of a gentle mind ?
I ask you -- for information -- what does that mean ?
<NAME> <NAME> bowed , to intimate that he was .
‘ Where is she ! ’ cried this lady .
‘ A long time , ’ said I .
Everybody uses the comb and brush , except myself .
Better employed than to attend to it , ’ said Mr Boffin .
`` I believe so , your ladyship . ''
Oliver roused himself , and made his best obeisance .
‘ Thank you , ‘ <NAME> , dear , ’ retorted <NAME> , majestically .
`` I leave you to judge now !
'Do n't speak to me ; it 's not safe .
The drafts of Mr Dorrit almost constituted a run on the <NAME> .
For he looked at me for an answer .
This behaviour was not lost upon <NAME> .
I thought they were with me .
<NAME> scarcely had come out , when <NAME> came out .
‘ I adore her memory on the assumption .
I wanted somebody to talk to , then .
The heat is greater ; my Lady screens her face .
<NAME> must look into this , <NAME> .
‘ None of your nonsense with me , ’ said Mr Flintwinch .
‘ He sleeps , ’ murmured the spinster aunt .
‘ Not goodest good , because you hesitate about it .
Among civilians I am what they call in <NAME> a ne'er-do-weel .
Keep ye or do ye or you keep always at it .
‘ What is the matter here ? ’ said <NAME> , pressing forward .
“ She was up and down with <NAME> all the evening .
‘ Ay , ay , ’ said <NAME> .
There must be some mistake between us .
‘ Why of <NAME> , <NAME> ? ’ asked her father .
`` What shall I do , what shall I do !
‘ A very fine evening , Mr Headstone , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ I suppose you won ’ t run away meanwhile , eh ?
When morning came , Mrs. Maylie 's predictions were but too well verified .
I thought she would have spoken to me privately if she had dared .
`` Is there a peculiar flavour in what you sprinkle from your torch ? ''
‘ I never dreamt such a real cough as that before .
He wouldn ’ t , wouldn ’ t he ? ’ said <NAME> .
'It was only my caution , nothing more .
‘ No , ’ said <NAME> , looking vacantly at him .
I -- Were you going there now ? ” asked <NAME> .
`` You must be here very seldom , sir , '' said I .
I said it lightly , because I felt her trembling .
‘ What ’ s the matter ? ’ screamed the ladies .
Whatever the motive , you want the best ? ’ My aunt nodded assent .
what would the <NAME> say !
He is perfectly quiet and comfortable now .
“ Well ! ” said <NAME> , “ that 's over !
‘ You have not thought about it ! ’ sneered the invalid .
‘ May I come in ? ’ said <NAME> , peeping .
I had him into my room .
‘ Who is that ? ’ said the Doctor .
I felt as if it came close and near to me .
That is the fault of my position -- not of myself , <NAME> .
They asked me what my story was , and I told them .
‘ Ask him to step here. ’ ‘ Yes , sir. ’ Exit <NAME> .
You wo n't want to spend it .
‘ <NAME> me what you mean .
This person has taken out MY certificate .
But it ’ s natural and rational that you should like it .
What could I ever do but thank him !
‘ <NAME> , ’ said Mrs. Pott , in a soft voice .
They reached the spot where the bereaved husband stood : and stopped .
Because they state the fact .
exclaims <NAME> , panting tigress-like .
<NAME> smiled , but made no reply .
So we stumbled along , quite satisfied .
As I grew up , he occupied the same place still .
<NAME> , I could n't have believed you would have done it !
I have put by a little , ma ’ am , already .
It ’ s a grand thing to be mad !
'What 's set you a snivelling now ? '
' I think I know what it must be to die of that ! '
<NAME> DRIVER ( with great vigour ) .
‘ He ’ s drunk ; he ’ s a drunken plebeian .
Little Dorrit learnt from it what to do .
`` I 'm sure he 's a good soul ! ''
I occasionally made a pretence of wanting a page or two of manuscript copied .
Was it you , the voiceless and the dead ?
‘ You attach too much importance to these things , ma ’ am .
The cup is bitter to the brim .
I lived in a state of chronic uneasiness respecting my behavior to <NAME> .
'Let it be , ' said <NAME> , thrusting his hand before her .
' I 'd scorn to be anything else . '
He may have been the child of circumstances .
Recollect your school at <NAME> at three . ''
It was a very dirty place .
Well ; and so I come to the second thing I have thought of .
`` Now , what do you say about her doctor ?
What ’ s that for a sailor ?
returns the trooper , kissing the young damsels .
`` Here we are , and a nice retired place it is .
She can have had no counsellor for her good .
<NAME> , I never lost that fear .
`` Do n't go on in that way , <NAME> .
You shall pay for this ; you shall pay for this . '
‘ Confound him ! ’ ‘ Yes , ’ said <NAME> .
`` And what classes of chance people come to practise at your gallery ? ''
‘ Lend him a hand , <NAME> , sir .
Little Em ’ ly shook her head .
`` And how does the world use you , Mr .
'You 'll keep a quiet tongue in your head , will you ? '
‘ I am sure I have seen that fellow before , ’ said <NAME> .
At which instance of parental enthusiasm <NAME> was enchanted .
In eight days ’ time , the sessions commenced .
<NAME> words will not move me , nor would hard blows .
Catching up the light , he crept softly upstairs .
But it was certainly the case .
<NAME> <NAME> looked round him .
We sat in silence for a few minutes .
This propensity gave Mrs. Rouncewell great uneasiness .
I will do it by very gentle degrees .
`` The <NAME> of the Feast indeed ! ''
'You are to go with me . '
`` I tell you what , '' says <NAME> .
‘ When he finds himself here , you know , ’ <NAME> explains .
E glad get money. ’ The little man smiled and nodded .
I hadn ’ t victuals enough to snore .
Yes , to be sure , my dear .
Oh , my bones and back !
Now , I am going to examine you out of my own head .
<NAME> everything as is kind and forgiving on your part ?
<NAME> in the aggregate , though short as they went by .
`` She had been a lady of a handsome figure and a noble carriage .
It has an irresistible attraction for him .
In what way ? ’ asked <NAME> .
‘ I can ’ t help that , <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> .
‘ And a low thief , ’ added the gentleman in the green-foil smalls .
‘ Yes , ’ said I , ‘ I am going over to <NAME> .
What he says , I quite concur in .
But they would n't leave me alone .
<NAME> excuse the introduction of such mean topics . ''
`` This , you must know , is the growlery .
There is a quiet decision in his reply which admits of no remonstrance .
Many added that he looked sublime and prophetic .
'Now , man , what have you got to say ? '
The inner gate was locked , and the lodge closed .
I had endeavoured to adapt <NAME> to myself , and found it impracticable .
He was a good power-loom weaver , and a man of perfect integrity .
In a few moments I stood before her .
<NAME> has made too much of it , I suspect .
He should be attended to , and looked after. ’ ‘ A companion ?
You know <NAME> , sir ?
'This is all , is it ? '
I only put it to you . ''
He reddened deeply , as if his natural generosity felt a pang of reproach .
You can ’ t forget that I didn ’ t submit .
‘ There is nothing the matter ? ’ inquired Florence .
‘ <NAME> well , my love , ’ replied <NAME> .
I proceed to other passages of my narrative .
‘ I was to pull through it , I suppose , Mrs. Gradgrind .
‘ Never you mind , ’ retorted that gentleman , tapping his nose derisively .
`` Are the <NAME> down here , <NAME> ? ''
I ’ ll beg it of her with kisses , ’ said <NAME> .
They were both silent for a time ; she weeping .
How could I ever be worthy of those tears ?
‘ Why , I know that knife ! ’ said <NAME> .
'Oh no , they ai n't , ' said the officer .
‘ Of great talent , ’ repeated Mrs. Micawber .
I shall pull through , my dear ! ''
Either of these gentlemen wish to go through the court ?
That ’ s not dutiful , Mr Arthur .
Is this the missis ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
Through this little gate , she passed out of childhood into the care-laden world .
‘ After being so good too , and coming along so well !
‘ Repeat your words louder , sir .
The <NAME> family had for some time helped to administer the <NAME> Office .
Then how can I possibly give you the answer that I have not discovered ?
I must confess to feeling rather glad that he is not <NAME> himself .
The son had no watch .
I must admit that I could not regard myself in an agreeable light .
No wonder that I shook my head !
An indubitable token of life !
This gave him a little comfort .
'No , ' replied the doctor ; 'of course not !
<NAME> again sat looking at the rain .
Because I saw it would be of no use , ’ replied <NAME> .
A merry Christmas to everybody !
So to <NAME> we will go .
I thought I had killed her , this time .
<NAME> Leicester looks astounded and inquires , `` Is the man in custody ? ''
Yes , you deserve 'em from me .
Regard it as a matter of business -- business that must be done .
`` Where is your son <NAME> , Mrs .
Run and tell him that ; d ’ ye hear ?
‘ No Fizkin ! ’ roared the crowd .
'Not long gone seven , ' said the girl .
I will not suffer this tone of levity. ’ ‘ My goodness me !
<NAME> for <NAME> , an old rip !
This is a most important matter .
I will consider my child !
‘ We are -- not younger , ’ said <NAME> .
There was something gipsy-like and agreeable in the dinner , after all .
I was frightened when I went away , and could not think .
<NAME> God ! ’ returned the old man .
‘ I only know her picture , downstairs .
Now , is it ? ’ ‘ N-n-no ! ’ replied <NAME> , faintly .
Little <NAME> rose and left the table .
If I understand any noddle in the world , I understand yours .
Says he wants a pound , and knows a dog .
Pull up here , ' cried the doctor .
`` I hope so , '' said he .
here ’ s this blessed phenomenon at last .
I wish to know on -- ha -- what authority , on whose authority .
`` Very well , <NAME> , '' returns <NAME> .
You call me a lucky fellow .
And who is the dearest friend I have in the world ?
‘ Deary ! ’ said the old woman then .
“ Wolf , I 'll tell you something more .
‘ Why did you resist them ?
<NAME> <NAME> , we ’ ll part , if you please .
Perhaps you know it 's <NAME> ? ” “ Yes , ” said I .
‘ How can that be hoped for ?
`` And he IS a child .
Ladies and gentlemen , my daughter .
His spirits were elastic ; his good-humour was restored .
I don ’ t know what other girls know .
And there ’ s another thing to be remembered , <NAME> .
said I in a whisper .
Can I have seen him abroad ?
We will walk that way , my dears .
I know you pretty well , you see . '
‘ That ’ s <NAME> , ’ returned <NAME> .
‘ Where ’ s <NAME> ? ’ cried a dozen voices .
‘ You are right , ’ returned <NAME> .
<NAME> number two , said they must take everything on political economy .
I dig the ground , and plant things that are to live and grow .
`` Yes , '' said <NAME> , `` well enough .
I hope <NAME> will excuse its painful nature . ''
<NAME> was afraid to look at either her or the man .
He has got that bottle about him .
I am only one of the travellers from down-stairs .
It was just at the time of that discovery in the river .
He is quite sure of himself .
‘ There ’ s a sheet of letter-paper , ’ he returned .
Nor was the occasional society of <NAME> himself wanting to complete their felicity .
‘ Her writing ! ’ said <NAME> .
Is he very white and spectre-like ?
<NAME> tried to speak , but her tears prevented her .
I suffer for <NAME> , <NAME> .
I study and get up abstruse No Thoroughfares in the course of the day .
Oh , where was <NAME> !
Nor do I recollect its subject .
<NAME> , dear , make me poor again and take me home !
No light feet had pressed it for many , many a day .
‘ I never saw so beautiful a face .
Where ’ s that rough total , Mr Rugg ?
Now move on here , come ! ''
Then it flashes upon him .
He re-entered the shed , and shrunk down once more .
Nothing of this appeared , however .
And <NAME> again relates his experience , again suppressing the half-crown fact .
“ 'How has this been done , monsieur ? '
I owe that to you .
Nor were these the only tokens of dispersal .
You must consider yourself in custody , <NAME> . ''
But I may ask you two questions , may I ? '
`` He 's in the dining-room , sir , along with mistress .
Comes <NAME> with his large keys , and yawningly unlocks and sets open .
‘ How are , you , my lad ? ’ replied the <NAME> .
' I think I do , ' said the gentleman , breaking silence .
So much the better for you .
You shall go. ’ ‘ I ! ’ returned the other .
‘ How ! ’ exclaimed <NAME> , with sublime severity .
‘ What do you wish ? ’ ‘ <NAME> ? ’ hesitated Mr Dombey .
He makes it too secure , as it happens .
You can contemplate your beauty at another time . ''
Where are the graces of my soul ?
<NAME> , ’ said I , ‘ what is the matter ?
‘ Wish you luck , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , touching his hat .
Then it turned the handle , and went in .
It had its poor people too .
‘ Accommodation , eh ? ’ said that gentleman , consulting a large book .
<NAME> , <NAME> , much louder , and still she will scarcely hear thee .
In short , <NAME> , that is the object of my visit .
I bred her and educated her , to be loved .
Respecting the other certified copy , your wish shall be complied with .
‘ Nobody would if they did want to , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ I beg and pray that no one will leave the room !
‘ There ! ’ said the dwarf , pulling him in .
The air struck chill and comfortless as it breathed upon him .
Except in that regard , we are all alike .
‘ Yes , ’ I said , with some importance .
I sold them very willingly .
‘ I understand you , <NAME> , perfectly .
‘ No , <NAME> , ’ said the Major , in a severe tone .
<NAME> repeated , as he scrambled out of bed .
I wish you good day , and I hope you 'll do well . ''
‘ My daughter , <NAME> ’ -- began Mr Dombey .
‘ I bless the day ! ’ said <NAME> .
‘ The Game Chicken , ’ said Mr Toots .
‘ Very well , sir , ’ said brother Charles .
‘ Her mother was , and she was poor .
My parting love to uncle .
‘ No , ’ said <NAME> , with the sunset very bright upon her .
You know you like this girl . ''
The <NAME> gardens blush with ripening fruit .
Nearly three hours of silence passed away .
Who else holds the door sometimes ?
‘ I am not quite decided , ’ returned Mr Dombey .
It is of my ward .
<NAME> , my lords and gentlemen .
Then we sits down , gradually gets cool , and holds a confabulation .
But however that may be , <NAME> is gone .
These latter words were addressed to <NAME> , who was sitting nearest to him .
`` You know I do n't intend to be responsible .
And what does this allusion to the slow coach mean ?
The wreck , even to my unpractised eye , was breaking up .
'Well , you need n't be so cross , ' said his companion .
My dear young men , be easy with me , if you please .
It is a broadsword to an oyster-knife .
‘ What , old Nobs ! ’ ejaculated the son .
`` Quite so , '' says <NAME> with a calm nod .
‘ I knew you was a-going to say so .
It ’ s a part of my character .
“ What is to be told to <NAME> ?
It ’ s not much to bear .
Certainly not , my dear <NAME> , most assuredly not .
`` Not much of a one , sir .
‘ Yes , sir , ’ rejoined <NAME> .
Have you had many brothers , <NAME> ? ''
‘ Think better of him than to suppose it .
That concerned myself ; this concerns us all. ’ ‘ Us all !
‘ Very great indeed , ’ said Mr Dombey .
Much better to think of dead than alive , <NAME> !
<NAME> shook her head , and sighed .
It was no other than <NAME> who gave me this piece of intelligence .
He could n't say how long he might be , having a case on .
Shall I tell you what I think ?
Neither of the three served or saved me .
The marine-store merchant holds the light , and the law-stationer conducts the search .
I ’ d die degraded , as I had lived .
I spoke unkindly to him , and he can not bear it from me .
Of her soon cheering up again , and our signing the register all round .
<NAME> , stop him for <NAME> 's sake , were it only in mercy !
His intention was rapidly communicated .
He has never uttered her name , since .
‘ “ Pounds , shillings , and pence , ” is my next note .
He looked out of the window -- it was very dark .
‘ Keep close to me all day .
It shall make me better . ''
'That boy will be hung , ' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat .
Now , are you right there ? ''
She was right touching his destination .
What are you hooroaring at ?
I am tempted now to go away .
‘ Thank you , I would rather not , ’ replied that gentleman .
I was going to remonstrate .
The earth shook when he walked -- he was so very stout .
‘ I ’ ll step out by and by , <NAME> .
`` <NAME> , '' remonstrates <NAME> with his utmost severity .
`` Then we may dismiss him for the present .
The old clergyman was present .
At least you shall not be wronged .
Receive me as your domestic , and I will serve you well .
So glad you came that day !
‘ The smallest encouragement thankfully received .
Whisper. ’ Mr <NAME> whispered , ‘ <NAME> ’ s Bower. ’ ‘ <NAME> !
I SAID hope , I think !
‘ Not in intention -- no no , ’ said he .
The men were very ill-looking .
Am I to call in any assistance , or is the trick done ? ''
It ’ s quite private. ’ ‘ Uncle Sol ! ’ faltered <NAME> .
And he and <NAME> stood together , looking down with compassion on him .
‘ There is the inexpiable offence against my adoration of you .
I hope she is in no affliction ?
My Lady , do you object to the twilight ? ''
‘ Three ten and one ten is five .
‘ There was , further , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> .
‘ Come nearer here , my dear Miss !
<NAME> your eyes , sir , and let me take hold of your chin .
The <NAME> glided on into a street .
He was <NAME> ’ s unfortunate brother , to her , and nothing more .
Might I ask you why he made it ? ’ <NAME> burst into tears .
<NAME> , may the present moment be the least unhappy of our lives .
`` Here 's something to eat , poor boy , '' says <NAME> .
She falls from the lowermost stair , and is swallowed up in the gulf .
The disregarded parrot only was in action .
' I am , ' repeated the Dodger .
‘ Surely that must content you !
We do our best to polish -- polish -- polish ! ''
We took our leave early , and left together .
asked the doctor , following the young lady to the sideboard .
He wandered over them again .
<NAME> ? ’ said <NAME> as he smoked .
And very well indeed you are looking , Mrs .
‘ And your vocation , <NAME> , may really demand this suit and service .
<NAME> , too , poor wandering shipwrecked boy , oh , where is he ?
“ Very well ; then you may go .
‘ Lodgings ; up near Mr <NAME> ’ s , ’ returned <NAME> .
‘ Is there ony genelmen there as can len ’ a hond here ?
You are familiar to me in these strange circumstances , very familiar . ''
Put on these clothes of mine .
There were three or four of us , counting me .
`` I can guarantee that there is no secrecy in it .
‘ Lift him up , ’ said <NAME> .
`` But he might , you know .
I know his ways , and the likely nooks he favours .
It fell to <NAME> now , to be not quite certain how to answer .
<NAME> <NAME> naturally asked why not ?
I am very glad to be so .
-- ‘ But I object to it , and that ’ s enough .
‘ The gentleman took my card .
That may be eccentricity , or he may be proud of his legs .
' I do n't know what that means , ' replied <NAME> .
He had changed , himself , since then .
But my poor young cousins ! ''
There were no shortcomings anywhere , in anything but money .
‘ Good ! ’ said Mr Meagles , cheerily .
‘ Because I have no other resting-place , ’ was the reply .
'It is useless , ' said the gentleman , with a sigh .
<NAME> to change the brooding mind , or raise it up .
He has shown nothing but his shell .
'Not now , ' said the Jew , turning softly away .
The old sexton soon got better , and was about again .
That he had his reasons for this , he knew full well .
Seven stage-coaches are preparing to carry us on .
If he ’ s forgotten ‘ em , they ’ ll soon remind him .
There is nothing of chance or doubt in the course before my son .
We shall meet no more .
What have you got to say ?
And you recollect <NAME> , that wath thought to be rather thweet upon yourthelf ?
‘ Just about there. ’ ‘ Does anybody open them , and shut them ?
‘ Ladies and gentlemen , ’ said <NAME> , suddenly rising .
“ <NAME> took it easy as a good riddance for both sides .
<NAME> <NAME> , <NAME> , I should have lost the weapon .
Next door at the back. ’ ‘ O , ’ returned <NAME> .
it were well to die , indeed , at such a time !
As he did so , <NAME> very hastily drew back .
<NAME> gave me some more gravy .
We all do it in one way or another .
It is called The Thorn of <NAME> .
The day was calm , however , and brightened towards noon .
‘ So much humour , ’ said <NAME> .
And <NAME> and <NAME> entered accordingly .
‘ No , I wasn ’ t , sir ! ’ cried <NAME> .
But that ’ s just the way !
I only ask to be free .
‘ No , my lady lass , ’ returned the <NAME> .
‘ Good-bye ! ’ said <NAME> , giving both his hands .
After a time he rose and rang the bell .
‘ There were five of us , ’ returned his partner .
`` He is called , I believe -- an -- ironmaster . ''
<NAME> ! ’ ( <NAME> was quite a rustic place to <NAME> . )
Theer ’ s mighty countries , fur from heer .
Cruncher. ” “ Let him come out too , ” said <NAME> .
‘ You are very good , sir .
‘ It embittered the life of your poor mother .
when she had me for her theme .
I assure you I attach not the least importance to any opinions .
`` He IS the most wonderful creature !
You conspirators , and hiders , and runners-away , should know better than that .
I am quite bewildered by all this .
Yet he 's like you , there 's no denying .
Last night , I went home .
`` I saw one of <NAME> 's long effusions , I think ? ''
<NAME> of your own strength now .
A. <NAME> , <NAME> , one pound .
<NAME> some bread and butter , <NAME> ; that ’ s a love .
It was the Chief <NAME> .
Those were the words I said .
<NAME> ’ s servant ! ’ said Mrs. <NAME> , turning pale .
‘ Leave go , I tell you ! ’ thundered his master .
This became the purpose of her life .
‘ Only us two , ’ said the man .
`` And you can refuse , you mean , eh ?
<NAME> was none the livelier and none the soberer for so much application .
A very good school it is , and handsomely supported by this family . ''
Let me thank you for so considerately yielding to my disinclination .
I know that she forgives me , and is sorry in her heart .
The stimulant is <NAME> ’ s voice .
Quarrelled and hinted about it .
And <NAME> , best of mothers , let us have your testimony !
I must act for myself , therefore .
<NAME> <NAME> returned , and found no tidings of him , and brought none .
Playfully , I become as one slain and hidden .
‘ I went down there the last time we were in <NAME> .
I wish for your sake they were right .
‘ It ’ s highly probable , my love .
And thus I slowly lose them .
‘ They are here , ’ added the count , tapping his forehead significantly .
‘ I wish , ’ thought <NAME> , ‘ I had never done this .
‘ For all time to come ? ’ asked <NAME> .
Where did you see her ?
I don ’ t know what it is .
said <NAME> , slapping his breeches-pocket .
His lordship gave me an indulgent look and acknowledged my curtsy very graciously .
She was awakened , after some time , by the stopping of the coach .
You would pass muster in a crowd , <NAME> ! ''
<NAME> ’ t be angry with me , <NAME> .
Tables laid in the yard .
<NAME> <NAME> was always remarkable for extreme humanity .
The <NAME> are now dead .
That 's the usual way of doing business . '
“ Both flourishing thankye , ” said <NAME> , “ and particularly the <NAME> .
I took <NAME> into my confidence , and we went out at dusk .
‘ How ill you looked a moment ago !
<NAME> , and keep them close too , if need be !
`` There was no Miss-ing of the girl in my time .
‘ It is true , ’ said <NAME> .
Her father was not at home , and <NAME> knew it .
`` Your ladyship , I come to put you on your guard .
Did he mention that he knew me ? ’ ‘ He did not .
I caused him embarrassment enough as it was , I am sure .
‘ Suppose he lives. ’ ‘ To be sure , ’ said <NAME> .
He is as sweet as honey , and I am as dull as ditch-water .
`` You need n't make a merit of that , '' said she .
'They have him now , ' cried a man on the nearest bridge .
<NAME> politeness and good breeding are observed throughout .
‘ All in good time , <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> .
I work an <NAME> coach now and then for a friend o ’ mine .
It was on a certain Sunday afternoon , that <NAME> took this resolution .
Well , my dear , it 's a pretty anecdote .
'An old man , my <NAME> ; a very old , old man ! '
What a fate there seems in all this !
He went down to his room , and buried <NAME> many additional fathoms deep .
‘ That ’ s a pity , ’ said <NAME> .
The cabinet in which his mother had kept his letters was there .
<NAME> <NAME> is quite sure .
But that ’ s the way I ’ ve gone through life .
`` My friends , '' says <NAME> , `` peace be on this house !
The blue-flies buzzed again , and <NAME> Attorney-General called <NAME> .
<NAME> and eager eyes peered from every inch of space .
<NAME> held a sovereign between his fingers .
`` Know 'd it yes'day aft'noon at tea-time , '' said <NAME> .
Away with him upon the dark road wildly !
He inquired particularly after <NAME> .
‘ And I have no fire , ’ said <NAME> .
accompanying herself on a glorified instrument , resembling a guitar .
‘ Glad to see you , sir .
But your temper is hasty and you are not considerate .
Neither of them spoke at all , for some short time .
‘ Is anything the matter ? ’ said <NAME> .
Really he is. ’ Really he was .
‘ Gone ! ’ ‘ Gone , ’ repeated <NAME> .
`` Oh , my Lady , my Lady .
It was a feeble tribute to thee , but it was well meant .
<NAME> <NAME> is in beautiful voice this day .
Now , you know my story .
He knowed that finger when he saw <NAME> , and he saw it plain .
`` As you say , it 's not a pleasant subject . ''
Nothing could be more precise , exact , and orderly than <NAME> .
'Why , what the blazes is in the wind now ! '
‘ I wish I had the vagabonds here , ’ said the captain wrathfully .
It is better for us both that this subject should end here .
At length he stopped , and rang the bell violently .
Now COULD it , you know !
'And what are _you_ , boy ? '
You know he is despised. ” “ Well ? ” said she .

`` I have long expected this , as you know .
Out again for <NAME> , so away to -- hey !
‘ Where is my nephew ? ’ asked <NAME> , wildly .
‘ I beg your pardon , ’ said he , starting .
It was midnight when he returned from his solitary expedition and climbed his staircase .
I think the worse of him ?
‘ Oh , do , please , <NAME> ! ’ cried all the ladies .
They ’ ve not been sleeping , I know that .
Last night he was very late , and it was quite light .
`` What 's time , '' says Mrs. Snagsby , `` to eternity ? ''
he repeated , taking a pinch of snuff and gently fluttering his fingers .
We fok ha ’ only one room , and we can ’ t .
‘ Fears are entertained that the wound will be mortal .
I and my sister worked at tambour work .
‘ It must be softly done .
'Was there no one by ? '

They were as silent , however , as the men .
The library is deserted , and the fire is sinking low .
He is a dissipated , extravagant idler .
To which Mrs. Bagnet responds with two pokes .
What do you mean by it ?
Too much , perhaps , without teaching .

‘ O you gentlemen , you gentlemen !
We offer the best reparation in our power .

‘ What ! ’ ejaculated <NAME> , laying his hand upon his note-book .
<NAME> -- <NAME> , ’ continued Mrs. Nickleby , considering .
His presence is an insult to my sister .
But I kept my ground .
'So they are , ' said the undertaker .
'What 's the matter here , my dear ? '
‘ A conspiracy to defeat the ends of justice , and murder its officers .

We tapped at the door and went in .
She is a thing of light , and airiness , and joy .
A little reservation I fear I must confess to .
He had just enough recollection of the face to desire to do that .
I have not the power of counting .
‘ Precisely so , ’ assented Mrs. Micawber .
`` Tell me that you are better to-day . ''
I do not deny that he is improvident .
I done it for his money .
<NAME> consider everything yours that you find upon the -- upon the body .
So unspoilt , so simple , such a good soul !
Would the gentleman give him his card , as he had seen him first ?
A man ca n't starve ; at least I ca n't .
‘ Now , wait a bit , <NAME> ; there ’ s something more .
‘ It may be out of the ordinary course , and yet be business .
I wants to go there and be berried .

`` That was not my meaning , '' returns <NAME> .
She took it , and I ’ ll follow it .

However , she had no right to be offended of course .
Mr Dorrit , dressing-gowned and newspapered , was at his breakfast .
I should be surprised if he could .
She watched his face as earnestly as he watched the river .
The atmosphere seemed tainted with the smell of coffins .
‘ <NAME> , breakfast. ’ No second invitation was required .
`` I remember the young lady very well .
Now , ducky , ducky , ducky , come to Mrs .
He ’ d carry me up with him .
You nodded to me , sir ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , pooh , nonsense .

Do you hope to move me by your tears ?

“ Apparently the Citizen-Doctor is not in his right mind ?
‘ Does <NAME> live here ? ’ I then inquired .
‘ I think a pipe vould benefit me a good deal .

As to daily news , there is no dearth of that commodity .
Spies are hovering about in every direction .
‘ The whole world knows that , I presume .
They must be informed of this .
Now , take this piece of paper in your hand .
`` You 're wanted at the <NAME> . ''
It was nothing that the decree bore date since his return to <NAME> .
This description must be received with a week-day limitation .
What a man it is !
<NAME> <NAME> was gentle likewise .
<NAME> Mrs. Sparsit incontinently collared .
Come into the parlour , sir , please . '
until I was almost beside myself .
“ Yes , ” said a voice from the darkness beneath .
Why I fail in my ability to finish it , I can not explain .
‘ As quick as possible , ’ said I .
He made no reply , but walked on with a lowering face .
Mr <NAME> smiled , and said he was sure of it .
`` None of us are , '' said I .
There ’ s the last bottle of the old <NAME> down below .
I found that we mustered our full strength .
Who is that fellow ? ’ ‘ A friend of our host ’ s .
Why ? ’ asked <NAME> , in amazement at this burst .
I saw him put it there .
`` And you will come there too , I hope , <NAME> .
You will remain here , then , and do exactly as you like .
‘ There is not the least cause for fear , I assure you .
( I expected <NAME> might have got it by this time . ) ''
`` And that thus the suit lapses and melts away ? ''
It ’ s not yet brought to an exact allowance ?
Which all the family re-echoed .
An insolent salute wafted from his lips ?
I took the latter course and went up .

You speak very earnestly to me .

These offerings of affection were of a most various and eccentric description .
Were there no poor homes to which its light would have conducted me ! ''
‘ They have come into my possession .

Mortimer <NAME> was not an extraordinarily impressible man , but this face impressed him .
What a poltroon , my Flintwinch !
There was nothing for it but bed ; so I went to bed .
‘ And nice company he is , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
It reached the door at last , and stood upon its feet .
You know I am very grateful to him ; don ’ t you ?
<NAME> <NAME> looked us up .
But <NAME> didn ’ t wait for him .
I can do very little .
The <NAME> answered not , but pointed onward with its hand .
The hackney-coach jolted along <NAME> , as hackney-coaches usually do .
But I ’ ll never tell her !
Oh , Mrs. Corney , what a prospect this opens !
Am I pale , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Not very , ’ replied <NAME> .
‘ Uncle ! ’ A fearful cry followed the word .
I 'm sure of it -- that 's quite sufficient . ''
‘ Now then ! ’ said this man , happening to turn round .
What do you mean ? ’ ‘ Helena , I don ’ t know .
Nothing but that. ’ ‘ Well , well !
Little <NAME> had not attained her twenty-second birthday without finding a lover .
I mean to tell you nothing , <NAME> , ’ replies <NAME> .
The old housekeeper suggests <NAME> .
‘ Pretty well , <NAME> , I thank you , ’ says <NAME> .
It was a dull , close , overcast summer evening .
Why show me this , if I am past all hope ! ''
At breakfast , Mr <NAME> likewise appeared .
I deserve it , for I have been in the scheme from the first .
`` What do you call some time , now ? ''
‘ A gentleman ! ’ said the lady , with a terrific scream .
`` He is celebrated almost everywhere for his deportment . ''
‘ Well , <NAME> ? ’ said <NAME> .

says Jo , in the last degree amazed .
`` I believe so , too , '' said he .
Running to the window , he opened it , and put out his head .
‘ Very good , ’ said Mr Boffin .
I made this little gift for <NAME> .
the cause was in her tottering feet .
Oh dear me , how very whimsical !
Is it surprising that I should be displeased ?
He ’ s uncertain in that respect .
Therefore you must know that I am engaged. ’ Engaged !
‘ Perfectly horrid ! ’ exclaimed <NAME> .
Therefore he says `` you '' are beaten , and not `` we . ''
‘ After which you took to swimming , you know ! ’ said <NAME> .
I set off one morning , accompanied by <NAME> , for <NAME> .
I made fur them mountains , <NAME> ’ r <NAME> , day and night .
‘ <NAME> ’ t be too hard upon me .
You have only to choose a trade , <NAME> , and be it .
‘ That ’ s not it ? ’ said I .
`` Oh , many , many , many years , my dear .
<NAME> has come over you , you jade !
`` Are you arrested for much , sir ? ''
We passed the finger-post , and held straight on to the churchyard .
But what did he do with you ? ''
You shall judge of its influence on me , <NAME> .
‘ What ’ s injudicious , hey ? ’ ‘ Nothing Sir -- nothing .
Her figure is elegant and has the effect of being tall .
This is nigh to be the proodest day o ’ my life , sir .
I regard his course as quite plain before him. ’ ‘ I hoped so .
<NAME> ? ’ I nodded at him , and he nodded back again .
‘ I am going out , ’ she said without looking at it .
<NAME> suits the back to the burden .
But she was always the same to me .
I felt half frightened at myself when the boy glared on me so .
‘ We are all pretty gay here , thank <NAME> !
`` He ai n't at all like <NAME> , mother ! ''
<NAME> comes , and with it the same blank .
We know now , what a struggle you made of old .
You were false to him , daily and hourly .
'Is he to be kidnapped to the other ken , <NAME> says ? '
Next minute , they are at the door .
‘ I expect so , but don ’ t know .
I ’ m glad you lost your way .
There ’ s the other shoe off now !
Do n't yer ask me to do anything till I have done eating .
Tell her that it was her husband 's last arrangement .
But the secret soon came out .
But the secret of these discussions was of little importance .
<NAME> knew he was dead ?
Never poached upon old Fagin !
`` So it might , little woman , '' my guardian assented .
He could not choose but look , although he looked to his dismay .
And the swans upon it , '' says <NAME> after further consideration .
'Pretty well , I think , for a beginner , ' remarked <NAME> complacently .
I only asked a question .
When he mentioned him , he spoke of him casually as his old pensioner .
<NAME> <NAME> nodded in the affirmative .
So all true souls ever are .
‘ It ’ s one fellow , ’ said Mr Sparkler .
In short , must leave it alone , like or no like .
They drew their chairs closer together , starting at every sound .
returned <NAME> , bending down his ear .
‘ I couldn ’ t think of allowing it .
You have been in the wars ! '
As he pretended not to see me , I pretended not to see him .
‘ But this is the fanciful side of the situation .
I had confided it to my aunt , but to no one else .
No one has ever raised that curtain since .
It 'll be a good job for him .
'This is the boy , your worship , ' said <NAME> .
<NAME> , you may rely upon him !
'That is the dabe of this 'ouse , ' replied the Jew .
‘ Oh dear , yes , sir , quite , ’ replied <NAME> .

`` Do not be so moved .
It was fainter and duller .
I 'll come back to tea .
returns <NAME> in an impressive , almost in an imploring , tone .
`` No , I do n't say that .
It was completely covered with such inscriptions .
We have not talked much , but <NAME> has been perfectly contented and cheerful .
Jo slowly munches as he slowly tells it .
said <NAME> , 'what a rum creature you are !
He could not bear it .
And to-morrow night , your ladyship , they will come into my possession . ''
With all my whole heart , Esther ! ''
The three spectators seemed quite stupefied .
It appears to be all in the testator 's handwriting .
It did not appear that <NAME> knew of this taste .
Yes , to the latest and the last .
‘ Oh , so peaceful and so thankful !
Through this person you strike at me , Podsnap the <NAME> .
I beg , therefore , to be understood as foregoing the bird ’ s-nest .

she cried as he fell heavily and calmly back from before her .
said <NAME> , highly amused by this declaration .
There was a fitness in that .
He knew of no rock ; he saw hardly any danger .
No , you only showed it .
‘ To be sure , ’ said <NAME> .
The inequality of <NAME> was nothing to it .
You observe , <NAME> , that my wife is my junior .
said <NAME> ; 'there is something to go back . '
He do n't want to keep it .
You can marry her , arter you and me have come to a settlement .
<NAME> , in compassion , bends over her and speaks to her .
But Mr <NAME> stopped him short .
A footstep on the stairs , and now the door was slowly opening .
‘ That was the way , was it ? ’ said <NAME> .
`` You 're particular , for a shade . ''
Now , what more ? ’ ‘ This more .
‘ She ’ s a-goin ’ off , ’ soliloquised <NAME> in great perplexity .
‘ I never saw such a face , <NAME> .
He is taken off , humbly protesting his innocence .
For what are you , my young friend ?
I am fond of hard work , and am true to my word . ''
It ’ s not a foolish fancy .
Ale. ’ ‘ But there is wine here , aunt .
‘ To the Devil with your witnesses !
‘ Nor to ruin a great many people whom I know .
<NAME> before me ! ’ roared <NAME> .
I receive a bill -- say from <NAME> .
Then she is enraged again , and makes some mention of swindlers .
I wish you many happy returns of the day .
I should not have a secret from you .
And a wise man he must have been to think so !
<NAME> that we shall meet again , on this side of the grave .
He coughed ; she looked up and smiled .
I am sure you know me better than to do so .
Disdaining to reply , she stretched her arm out , pointing to the chair .
Would you be so good as to -- as to speak up , Mr .
‘ The first letter of the name of the deceased , ’ replied <NAME> .
`` Come , '' he says ; `` I am ready . ''
<NAME> was lost in astonishment and concern .
I shall know what to do next ; never fear . '
I would sooner have strangled him than had no return .
But I tell you what .
So , both sets of gates were , for the moment , closed .
<NAME> , still having his purpose , still remained .
I can ’ t manage a discussion .
I only tried to frighten you .
We had stopped , and the waggon had stopped too .
I could see none , I could hear none .
By dint of this ingenious scheme , his gloves were got on to perfection .
Only once during dinner was there any conversation that included the young gentlemen .
<NAME> sum as per bond , five hundred pound .
You must not refuse , sir . '
Here 's a shilling for you .
' I have seen you before , I think ? '
<NAME> will never forget that at <NAME> ’ s she first saw him .
‘ To hang himself ! ’ repeated <NAME> .
Will somebody hand me anything hard and bruising to pelt at her ?
Give this glass to me .
‘ Really I was quite dismayed and shocked last night .
That ’ s rather unlucky , too , for such an immaculate chap .
‘ What is it ? ’ ‘ What is it ? ’ repeated <NAME> .
<NAME> very much admired some artificial flowers under a glass .
<NAME> , do look at him !
Oh , take me somewhere ! ” Much alarmed .
‘ I know it , ’ rejoined <NAME> .
You must go to bed another time , my love .
She seemed to respect him and even to wish to conciliate him .
This , however , was a mere question of length and wearisomeness .
‘ There they are , like the four-and-twenty fiddlers -- all of a row .
‘ You were obliged to tell him !
‘ The -- ? ’ My mother had been thinking of something else .
`` You hear what she says .
‘ I am glad to see them .
<NAME> ’ t go out , you ’ ll fall dead in the street .
`` I do not accuse him . ''
I always had , when I was a medical man .
<NAME> <NAME> looks very grave .
And your sister , <NAME> , and your brother .
‘ <NAME> of themselves ! ’ said Mrs. Raddle .
She was very pretty : exceedingly pretty .
‘ Come here , <NAME> , ’ said her father , coldly .
But no dog appeared , and at length he resumed his journey .
‘ Whew ! ’ whistled <NAME> , as he took it in his hand .
Almost as good a one as you thought me for you .
What can I do ? ’ cried <NAME> .
'What have you got , <NAME> ? '
You know he is always good-humoured and tractable .
I don ’ t know what I thought , or what I dreaded .
His business is the Law ? ” I nodded harder .
‘ Stupid ! ’ said Mrs. Squeers angrily .
And it was made the more difficult by the unconscious <NAME> .
Here is the door as you see .
<NAME> almost smacks his lips with the unction of a horrible interest .
I forget how my uncle used to call it . ''
he cried in a shrill tone .
‘ I began , by means of his assistance , to copy law writings .
‘ “ Wouldn ’ t she ? ” said the old gentleman firmly .
His face , his voice , his manner , all showed that too plainly .
She became utterly and completely miserable .
I shall be within the mark any way .
cried <NAME> , struggling to disengage himself from the girl 's grasp .
<NAME> ourselves. ” “ Is there ? ” asked madame , vacantly .
cried the lady , ' I have been so dreadfully put out ! '
‘ <NAME> won ’ t be long , ’ said <NAME> .
His constant height is of a piece with his immense abilities .
The little people could do nothing without dear <NAME> .
‘ Quite right to remind me , <NAME> .
‘ Here you are again , ’ repeated Mr Wegg , musing .
I want my bond , you see .
It was not so easily got ready as some people may imagine .
Let him put away his whim now , and he is welcome back .
Let me wet your lips again .
`` I am afraid you are tired .
‘ I never bet half a dozen ! ’ said the other gentleman .
It would be hard , indeed , to part you now .
I am glad to hear you do .
<NAME> and he were very different now , he said , and very happy .
“ Three Rums ! ” cried the stranger , calling to the landlord .
I suppose it was true .
By perpetuating the consequences of his ignorant and blind obstinacy .
In an instant she was gone , and he had shut the door .
Very near the bottom now .
<NAME> ’ s is all you ’ ve got to say to <NAME> .
`` See how the soot 's falling .
I have had no counsellor , no adviser , no one to protect me .
I have not spent any of it .
But he is not to be spoken of if you please .
Drawers , desks , pockets , all things belonging to him , <NAME> examines .
I leave them to you , at your desire .
I knew its tender nature very well .
“ Is he dead ? ” I asked , after a silence .
None of them have come down in the world as we have .
I 'll tell you something more , wolf .
Therefore Mrs <NAME> asked no questions , and showed no curiosity .
`` He is called among the neighbours the <NAME> .
Do you deserve your blessings ?
‘ <NAME> likely , ’ replied <NAME> briefly .
I was articled to <NAME> and <NAME> .
`` Do it yourself , '' returned the friend rather tartly .
<NAME> you good-night , Mrs. <NAME> .
My stall and I are for ever parted .
You will like to make some change , perhaps ?
There ain ’ t so much in that , you ’ ll say .
You know her. ’ ‘ I remember , ’ said his companion carelessly .
`` Little woman , '' said he , `` You have been crying . ''
Behave yourself to visitors , my lady !
`` And something else supports me , <NAME> . ''
But you ’ ll never go on with it , ’ said number four .
It was the first of their proceedings which had no heartiness .
His knowledge is not at fault in the present instance .
‘ Not at all , ’ said <NAME> .
We can do so , undismayed .
'What if he turns against the others ? '
And then I know what would happen .
' I wonder whether THEY can hear it , ' said <NAME> .
Shall I tell you about the second time I saw her ?
With no consciousness of having moved , she gained the door .
He was a grotesque , fantastic figure , and the few bystanders laughed .
I wish to make you happy .
They came out with me directly to look at the boy .
There is no one here to see .
‘ You would like to be a lady ? ’ I said .
`` <NAME> left us at a week 's notice .
It ’ s a dreadful thing to gape , but I must do something .
‘ I have surely slept very long , ’ returned <NAME> .
It is a way he has sometimes .
She then walked me on very fast .
You found him secret ? ’ returns <NAME> , with a greedy relish .
‘ You see those two old houses , ’ he said at last .
Do you attach no value to their good opinion ?
It was a trouble to him to think of this face of <NAME> .
Our place of destination in the first instance is <NAME> .
I ’ ll tell her that you have come home .
' A porochial life is not a bed of roses , Mrs .
‘ HE was a long time , ’ replied <NAME> .
He has been so careless and said so much that he never meant .
I almost think he did .
His altered character had never been so grossly marked .
-- Heerd a noise , ' continued <NAME> .
'Have I the lady 's promise for that ? '
‘ The talent of the other three is principally in combat and serious pantomime .
In moments of confidence too ?
‘ I said mine , didn ’ t I ? ’ returned <NAME> .
That you sent messages by , you know !
<NAME> nodded assent , and drained his glass .
I myself always clearly foresaw the consequences , and am not surprised .
Is there summ ’ at deadly sticking to my clothes ?
He had been spurred and whipped and heavily sweated .
I thought you ’ d allow me to pay my compliments to you .
As <NAME> gazed sternly upon him , it rolled down his cheek .
“ No , no , no ; you are too young , too blooming .
<NAME> sang with great sweetness and expression , and so did Mrs. Strong .
This was a good freshener to my presence of mind , as a beginning .
This is not the place for <NAME> of any kind .
<NAME> walked on the other side of <NAME> , and never quitted that position .
Here is an inkstand , here are pens and paper , here are wafers .
He was there , he was there .
It might have cost me a client .
“ 'Pray excuse me , ' said I .
The large rooms are too cramped and close .
There must always be two parties to a quarrel , says the old adage .
I ’ ll hold you living , and I ’ ll hold you dead .
Mrs. <NAME> overheard him and smiled .
‘ Stop and take me , if you please , <NAME> .
If he ’ s there , bring him in .
I never saw the mode .
Here it is , you see , sir !
I owe it all to him , my love , my pride !
‘ Eh , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Yes , indeed , ’ said I .
<NAME> has asked him whether he went to school as a junior with <NAME> ?
Wednesday morning was dawning when I looked out of window .
A <NAME> and a Chase 10 .
‘ <NAME> , I protest against pride .
Really and truly pretty comfortable ?
<NAME> Leicester is majestically wroth .
What have I to do with it ?
Walks by night , does she ?
I am very susceptible to such horrid things .
But it was enough for <NAME> that <NAME> was used to it .
My sister will miss you .
observes the penitent trooper , shaking his head .
Do not mind me , <NAME> , ’ she returned .
A girl can get on anywhere .
I tried to convince her so , but I didn ’ t succeed .
Was she glad to know it ?
He has been at it all day . ''
`` My service to him , too !
‘ <NAME> and <NAME> , ’ growled the bass .
There was no other music than their own singing .
No bringing up by hand then .
But I had lost twenty-four hours .
It 'll be better for him .
Whether it was a criminal act that I had committed ?
I was apprenticed when I was seven year old. ’ ‘ Oh !
‘ Nothing is going to be done .
‘ They have never understood you , <NAME> , ’ said his wife .
Who told a stranger we could be seen ?
If he stopped it did the same .
‘ Of course I know that , <NAME> .
Next day came ; came <NAME> ; and came <NAME> .
`` I accept it with many thanks , '' returned the trooper .
At another time you ’ re all for work .
I am in another way of business .
‘ “ It was _not_ , ” said a deep voice .
Take one of these , I entreat .
‘ <NAME> ’ t be sorry for me , dear Papa !
So expressionless of any approach to spontaneity were his face and manner .
<NAME> gave me some more gravy .
Look what a poor , mean , miserable thing it is !
`` Yes , yes , you are tired , '' said he .
Now let us talk sensibly .
‘ Let me lie by him .
`` My child , what questions are these !
She turned , and looked back .
Here , Bull's-eye , mind him , boy !
‘ No , sir , I know that .
‘ <NAME> and I will come down , together .
‘ Will you answer me ? ’ said <NAME> .
The <NAME> of an Epidemic 14 .
I had thought so more than once lately .
She were a young lass—pretty enow—wi ’ good accounts of herseln .
‘ Come with me to my dear father .
I have withdrawn by myself , many times today , to weep .
‘ Well , and what then ? ’ said <NAME> .
And why should you take trouble ?
She did this , twenty , thirty times .
There is no improvement in the weather .
I should not be able to bear it , and I should not try .
I forgive her , if I have any cause .
‘ How are the mighty fallen ! ’ remarks <NAME> .
There is no obligation on either side .
‘ It is unnatural to see your grey hair lower than mine .
Here they stopped , and Mr <NAME> consulted his watch .
And my terror was greatest of all when I found no figure there .
<NAME> was sure she must .
However , that ’ s beside the question .
‘ I have sold the things .
I ’ ll run out presently , and get a bottle of soda .
I have not done that for many a long year ! ''
But what a certainty was that !
‘ Where are you going to ? ’ ‘ Back to <NAME> , deary .
And what ’ s more , -- with one scull gone .
<NAME> and prosy in the extreme .
What I wish to approach is something very different .
<NAME> in your pipe and I ’ ll read you the letter .
‘ Will you come in ? ’ said Mr Meagles , presently .
‘ What is to be done with the remains ? ’ asked <NAME> .
Now look here , Mr Wegg .
He lowered the window , and looked out at the rising sun .
‘ Oh , <NAME> is quite well , <NAME> , ’ Toots would cry .
But I have not the power , <NAME> .
You ’ ll be rich enough now -- with your Boffins .
'Not coldly , ' rejoined the old lady ; 'far from it . '
‘ Halloa ! ’ said <NAME> , falling back , with a wink .
It was nearly dinner-time next day when we appeared before my aunt .
And now there was a shore before him .
I Assist at an Explosion LIII .
‘ And your master , young man !
<NAME> , show <NAME> and <NAME> their rooms .
‘ What is that ? ’ said <NAME> , kindly .
‘ Your occupations must be immense. ’ ‘ Tolerably so .
<NAME> <NAME> has an exposed sound .
Get along with you , ’ and shut it on him .
`` Now , what does our young friend say ? ''
<NAME> Heaven ! ” “ Softly , ” said <NAME> .
She hastened to the door and opened it .
‘ I have met him twice .
‘ You know very little of your guardian ? ’ the <NAME> repeated .
<NAME> and grieving was the heart of <NAME> , as she crept upstairs .
I 've been locked up as much as a silver tea-kittle .
People came and looked on , too , which made <NAME> nervous .
said <NAME> , catching at the word .
In the drawing-room , groups form as usual .
But I have a constitutional objection to this sort of thing .
`` They say I am like my father , grandmother . ''
‘ Take a word of advice , even from three foot nothing .
In his plain old suit of black , he looked pale and meagre .
There 's nothing solar about legs of beef and mutton .
I believe there never existed in his station a more respectable-looking man .
‘ And you were in crack society .
are you a perfect fool ? ’ and interfered .
<NAME> our child for me. ” That was all the writing .
Every pound lost , would have been a hundredweight of happiness gained .
“ Faint heart never won fair lady. ” Why was my heart so faint ?
There can be no doubt about that .
added <NAME> , looking closely at the man .
Most solemnly. ’ ‘ Never to the <NAME> ! ’ with a convulsed struggle .
' I do n't know where , ' replied the girl .
He makes no search for his daughter .
‘ Leave him to me. ’ ‘ Where is he ?
Now , your ladyship , a queer thing happened after that man 's death .
Mind you , <NAME> , I was his pardner .
‘ An old man entered the porch just as he reached it .
The crisis of the disease was safely past .
I can never see thee better than so .
But what could I suppose when you said nothing for yourself , you know ?
He took out his purse .
`` Aye , but they might teach me wrong ! ''
And in that short time !
`` But I could have made the money without this anonymous information . ''
That concerns me , if it do n't concern <NAME> .
Whenever you do , <NAME> , let us know . ''
`` And now I do n't so much care how it ends . ''
said <NAME> with a blank look .
`` I have done you many wrongs , my own .
When you came in , I was full of it .
`` You give the house almost a wholesome look .
What can it be to me ?
`` What 's to-day , my fine fellow ? ''
But she had the power , and he felt it keenly .
Their pieces were cocked and levelled when we all ran in .
But how ? ’ ‘ I ’ ll tell you , <NAME> .
Try once more , dearest Mr Fledgeby .
He ’ s a low thief , sir .
I spoke to her , and she started , and cried out .
‘ Well , but let us know .
The President rang his bell , and with warmth resumed .
`` HE lived here , '' Jo answers as before .
You can tell nothing I don ’ t know .
‘ Why then , child , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ you can .
'Should I have to hand over ? '
The plot was most interesting .
replied the girl , in the same tone .
'And Fagin would RATHER not ! '
You make your life miserable along of her .
Instead of looking back , therefore , I will look forward .
<NAME> both , and sorely puzzled too , to find out what they seek .
Is the poor creature much hurt ? '
<NAME> assisted him to rise .
Such as I am , I am genuine myself .
‘ Where is <NAME> ? ’ she asked the servant , aloud .
More unlikely things had come to pass .
Always beside him and attached in all his fortunes ?
'The child that was half-baptized <NAME> , is nine year old to-day . '
The cell-door has been closed too long on all its hopes and cares .
That ’ s what _you_ did. ’ ‘ Well ! ’ said <NAME> .
I hope she will give me time -- a little time .
I learned in a moment that my scarred face was all unchanged to him .
Dropsical it certainly is , for it will hold a dozen passengers inside .
‘ Here he is at last ! ’ said old <NAME> .
‘ Because you won ’ t let me .
'On your business all night . '
Still <NAME> said nothing .
`` I am very sorry , sir , '' said <NAME> .
The old gentleman pointed , with some surprise , to his card .
‘ <NAME> me that I acted for the best .
‘ I should wish mother to be got into my state .
`` What did they call the wretched being ? ''
‘ He has done a great deal for me .
Something to drink ? ’ asked <NAME> .
Six days , seven days , far on into another week .
It is twenty-five minutes after its time this afternoon .
‘ I am reading for the bar .
‘ I tell ’ ee I ha ’ gotten scent o ’ thot already .
Mrs. Badger considers it too yellow .
<NAME> ‘ ooman at home sa : ’ chuckling very much .
<NAME> Mr <NAME> pleased to see this ?
It ’ s a capital house for study .
‘ Lord bless me ! ’ cried <NAME> .
The impression made upon me , however made , never left me .
`` She exerts herself very much for <NAME> , sir , '' I said .
Say that again , '' cried <NAME> in a shrill , sharp voice .
It only shows how right I was .
You do remember them , I know .
‘ And what does the boy say ? ’ said my aunt .
I ’ m with you directly , sir !
This is the way young coves is spiled and drove wrong .
Everything was left , all right .
‘ Good bye , <NAME> , ’ cried <NAME> faintly .
There was a most irritating end to every one of these debates .
‘ What curious people you are !
“ I know 'd my name to be <NAME> , chrisen 'd Abel .
' I ca n't keep her alive , can I ? '
“ You hit the nail on the head .
`` I wear the chain I forged in life , '' replied the <NAME> .
'If _you_ please , sir , ' returned <NAME> .
What am I to say , indoors ?
He 's got it buttoned in his breast .
‘ I have lived an adventurous life .
'Take this lantern , ' said <NAME> , looking into the room .
They formed my character , and filled me with an abhorrence of evil-doers .
exclaimed the old gentleman , reddening .
`` How do you find them ?
No clue to how body came into river .
'It 's all a lie together , ' replied <NAME> .
O sister-woman , think of me .
There has been more than enough of that extreme .
‘ Shaken out of destiny ’ s dice-box again into your company , eh ?
‘ Now I am glad to know that !
`` No , thank you , '' said I .
says <NAME> , `` I 've lost him again ! ''
<NAME> as I , of all men , should do that , my girl !
We are , <NAME> , Your obedient servants , <NAME> & <NAME> .
He advanced towards it trembling .
Walks sometimes for two hours when she has them bad .
‘ Let me speak a word with you in private , ’ said <NAME> .
You liked me , didn ’ t you ?
`` I only want to rouse him .
<NAME> chooses as we would have <NAME> choose .
`` Quite an adventure for a morning in <NAME> ! ''
‘ Do you know <NAME> ? ’ asked the new client .
So like <NAME> , was n't it ? '
The <NAME> , stronger yet , repulsed him .
There was not the smallest speculation , however , in the countenance of <NAME> .
<NAME> again gazed at him : as it seemed mechanically .
She might go a-berryin ME . ''
<NAME> anything taken place , <NAME> ? ’ said Mrs. <NAME> eagerly .
<NAME> readily consenting , <NAME> ordered out young Barnet as a matter of course .
‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , with a great disrelish .
Very good indeed , my dear ! '
‘ Your most obedient , <NAME> , ’ said the Major .
<NAME> had turned his liberty to hopeful account by becoming a billiard-marker .
' A woman , ' replied the gentleman .
We are never asunder now ; we never shall be ’ any more .
That time has had its influence on all his later life .
Then I heard that you were here .
‘ Good-bye , ’ rejoined the pretty housemaid , turning her head away .
‘ Oh , no , he shall not , ’ rejoined <NAME> .
Everything looked wan at that hour .
She had a great aunt living in these very times called <NAME> .
<NAME> ’ t ask me nothing about ‘ em , <NAME> .
It lay in a nutshell .
‘ You wouldn ’ t believe , sir , that I feel serious now ?
‘ Wery good , my dear , ’ replied <NAME> .
He put her hand to his lips , and she quietly drew it away .
He was twice her age .
‘ For <NAME> ’ s sake be careful !
said <NAME> , giving his head a great rub and stopping short .
<NAME> finally settled the number at two ; the foreigner and Mr Flintwinch .
inquired the man , as he followed him out to the landing .
I advise no man to interfere in proceedings that I choose to take .
I asked her how she could answer for what I meant ?
Everything being hollow and worthless , she had missed nothing and sacrificed nothing .
The old man shakes his head with sharp sly triumph .
Is there nothing to redeem him ?
<NAME> , dear , try to help me !
Why do I do myself the injustice of calling myself a girl ?
`` I can never forget it , '' said <NAME> .
You will not go yet .
It is not HIS fault . ''
And we have no other place of abode .
Here are The <NAME> once more .
Make the rain pour down , outside , in torrents .
<NAME> is your master now .
I asked him where he meant to go ?
That he well deserved one , yes .
`` Middling , '' replies <NAME> , taking a chair .
<NAME> <NAME> is not in a common way .
‘ This is a joyful occasion indeed , extremely joyful .
<NAME> <NAME> answers , `` Not exactly . ''
At this remark the face of Mr <NAME> gloomed considerably .
But , a remarkable improvement came upon him as to this .
I am neither ; I am wretched .
Not till we give you leave .
The people stand out of the way to let her go by .
<NAME> , price , quality , were of no account .
Mrs. Snagsby sees it all .
‘ Now jump into bed again , or you ’ ll catch the rheumatics .
He was pale and seemed agitated .
Else why have to do with you at all ?
The table trembled in the silence that followed .
The hull of a ship !
'Well , then , look here , ' continued <NAME> .
In another moment , <NAME> was in the arms of the weather-beaten pea-coat .
I may mention at once that this became an annual custom .
With another class of customers , <NAME> was again another man .
I passed the day in a ditch , and the night in a pigsty .
Would you do an old man that good turn , sir ? ''
They suggested quiet places afar off , and rest , and peace .
At length the signal was given , and all the ring leaned forward .
LET us strike the key-note again , before pursuing the tune .
‘ It ’ ll stand you in a pound a week .
Truly , it looked as gloomy that night as even it had ever looked .
I developed her into what she is , that she might be loved .
The crisis ! ’ He had sauntered far enough .
‘ I have considered the young ‘ ooman .
And he grew to be proud of the title .
Once , I opened the yard-gate , and looked into the empty street .
It is her and it a n't her .
A very valuable person , and deservedly respected . ''
I want to set you more right with yourself . ''
O let us be joyful , joyful !
But the second object of this interview , I must not forget .
“ See ! ” cried madame , pointing with her knife .
I don ’ t think what I said now .
'Let me go , will you , -- this minute -- this instant . '
‘ A most admirable memory. ’ ‘ Thank you , ma ’ am .
I was very much changed -- oh , very , very much .
I always said it , long before this came out .
From <NAME> ’ s , Veneering dashes at <NAME> ’ s place of business .
What should be wrong in <NAME> Bower !
“ <NAME> , ” she repeated , flashing a look at me .
Mrs. Corney twice essayed to speak : and twice failed .
‘ <NAME> , ’ he resumed , ‘ I have done with this .
Except that <NAME> was more to be admired than ever , I remember nothing .
glancing round upon the three bystanders .
`` I am in town on leave just now , '' said <NAME> .
He was rather reserved , but I thought him very sensible and agreeable .
I should soon be eased of it , if I did .
I tried to cheer my darling , and asked her what it was .
That done , he shut down his window , and went to bed again .
I am quite myself again , my love , quite myself .
' I shall never get another ! '
But he said not a single word , good or bad .
And I assure you , sir , the ladies are great observers .
‘ They are not to be expected to be as sensitive as we are .
We had a struggle near the door .
He haunts my thoughts , like a dreadful ghost .
For they said , it was a shame to quarrel upon Christmas Day .
‘ It ’ s very agreeable to hear .
This brought him to a stop .
At length the breakfast is ready .
‘ <NAME> ’ t I told you what a mercenary little wretch I am ?
“ It would seem like flight , my darling .
He read that he was dishonoured .
‘ Bless my soul ! ’ said Mrs. Cluppins .
What should we do without strength , my friends ?
“ O yes I shall ! ” said he .
The absurdity of the situation put its pathos to the rout .
That ’ s the mark ; come up to the mark , sir .
I had made up my mind to speak to him now .
‘ Take down that scandalous red handkerchief , I beg .
‘ <NAME> d ’ ye do , <NAME> ? ’ said <NAME> .
She was miserably dressed , and carried some skins over her arm .
‘ Go back to them , ’ <NAME> retorted .
‘ Oh , decidedly , ’ observed the spinster aunt .
I have been familiar with every stone in the place .
But , whenever <NAME> spoke , he shut them again .
If you want to out with something , out with it ! ''
‘ What is it , my dear ?
I am not going home now ; I have a visit to make alone .
that ’ s nothing in such a service .
‘ Oh dear , yes , sir ! ’ cried this hopeful penitent .
He rose and raised me with him .
“ What 'll you drink , <NAME> ?
‘ I promise it. ’ ‘ That ’ s my dear <NAME> .
Only by times , because <NAME> is growing drowsy .
So easy is it to move light hearts .
At last the day came for going home .
But my blood boils to avenge this poor murdered creature .
A very brief conversation ensued .
The spinster aunt could hardly believe her eyes .
That she was a young widow , <NAME> .
He did so , quite ineffectually .
Shipping <NAME> and Office Business 14 .
said <NAME> , addressing <NAME> , with supreme contempt .
“ She wants this boy to go and play there .
'Dear me , I forgot all about it ! '
The well-known massive gray square tower of its old Cathedral ?
I ’ m sure I never was more serious .
‘ Eh ? ’ cried Mr Boffin , catching at the name .
`` Thriving , grandmother , in every way . ''
I hope my natur is _NOT _ a soft vun , <NAME> .
They shall all confess your merit , <NAME> .
`` It 's a pleasure to talk to him .
‘ My name ’ s <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
Not going to be done ? ’ repeated <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> has made a pause to suppress a groan .
‘ There , young man ! ’ said the dolls ’ dressmaker .
If she wounds you , love her .
‘ Did you ? ’ said <NAME> , distrustfully .
‘ Winkle -- Winkle ! ’ shouted <NAME> , calling into the inner room .
The doctor-seeking messenger meets the doctor halfway , coming under convoy of police .
‘ Then you may hand it over , <NAME> .
Found sobbing afterwards , in own room .
`` The picture has never been engraved .
All my efforts are vain .
The bolts of the door were rusty , and difficult to unfasten without noise .
‘ Here <NAME> walks by herself , ’ I thought .
‘ As near as a toucher , ’ assented <NAME> .
I am greatly , greatly , disinclined to profit by it .
Let me remember , then , what he said as to that .
What else do I remember ?
`` You will find the young man next door then .
