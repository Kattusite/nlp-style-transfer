There has been a delay. ' ' Not that it is of consequence , ' said <NAME> .

Sometimes he would ask her for herself .
It was not until every preparation was made for <NAME> ' s immediate removal that <NAME> broke silence by declaring she should not be taken away .
' They are here now , ' said <NAME> , rising and hurrying away .
cried <NAME> , calling downward to a boy in Sunday clothes , who perhaps had loitered in to look about him .
If it could not be done with <NAME> ' s sanction and concurrence , I besought a clandestine interview in the back kitchen where the <NAME> was .

' _I_ pray to Heaven it may turn out so ! ' repeated <NAME> .
But he ' ll soon be home for good , now .
I am pretty well known .
That very popular trust in flat things coming round !
' Is it , indeed ? ' rejoined <NAME> .
' I -- hem ! -- I can ' t think , <NAME> , what has given <NAME> offence .
When we came to the usual place of meeting -- it was close by , and <NAME> had often accompanied me before -- my guardian was not there .
Furious with terror , he raised his stick , and struck <NAME> a heavy blow across the face .

That ' s my view of the matter , <NAME> Pickwick. ' ' It is a very philosophical one , ' replied <NAME> .
What could <NAME> do ?
' Here ' s wishing of her back agin. ' Polly cried more than ever at this .
' I know you are unhappy , and have got into great trouble by bringing me away .
I hated her then , quite as much as I hate her now ; and naturally , therefore , could desire nothing better than that she should marry him .

' The house with the red door , cabmin .
' One of them things that young men do when they get married , ' returned <NAME> ; ' and as runs through with their money like nothing at all !
Go it , <NAME> ! ' ' What you may mean , <NAME> , by your omnibus-driving expressions , I can not pretend to imagine .
And now you must tell me , dearest Ma and <NAME> , upon your words and honours !
' They brighten at the sight of you , ' returned <NAME> .
' <NAME> down , ' said <NAME> , turning towards him , as though by a violent effort .
I am going to speak upon another subject , a confidential subject , <NAME> .
May I speak out , among friends ?
The placid look at the white ceiling came back , and passed away , and his head dropped quietly on his breast .
I confess that I looked upon this as a very painful exhibition , and one by no means flattering to the national standard of honesty and honour .
<NAME> ' t take any notice of it , ' said <NAME> , peeping in from the bedroom .
' The fact is , it ain ' t a Hall , ' observed <NAME> drily .
' We are all as happy as possible ! ' said <NAME> .
The responsibility of giving the lady away devolved upon the <NAME> , which led to the clergyman 's being unintentionally scandalized , and it happened thus .
He was reconciled to what had happened , and went down again quite happy .
To make these dwellings as habitable and full of comfort as they could , was now their pleasant care .
Have the goodness to confine your dealings strictly to trade and business , and not to travel beyond it .
Official sentiments are one thing .
' But I say yes , ' returned his friend .
<NAME> as <NAME> , boy ! ' said <NAME> , taking snuff from a round box on the table , and laughing heartily .
<NAME> would see that the boys were fond of him ; and that would make her happy .
' Assuredly , <NAME> is an oracle !
He can speak of nothing else .
Did you ever taste beer ? ' ' I had a sip of it once , ' said the small servant .
Perhaps -- who shall decide on such mysteries ! -- he was afraid that he might come to hate her .
' I ' m a bacheldore. ' ' A bachelor ! ' I said , astonished .
' Why would you ? ' ' If you please , sir , I am very fond of flowers , ' returned the girl .
He was familiar with him , in the very extremity of his sense of the distance between them .

" I should like to walk a little , " says my Lady , still looking out of her window .
' You come on business , sir .
" You do n't object to him , little woman ? "
' Let ' s hear what <NAME> did. ' He did not appear to have hidden anything , so went off rather flatly .
Mr <NAME> ? ' ' Perfectly , sir , ' returned Mr Sparkler .
' I told you before , ' replied <NAME> , 'that I was afraid to speak to you there .
' I think they must certainly come to-morrow , eh mother ? ' said <NAME> , laying aside his hat with a weary air and sighing as he spoke .
' To be sure you didn ' t , ' said the little old man ; ' of course not .
The coach was punctual to the time appointed ; and <NAME> , after duly installing <NAME> and <NAME> inside , took his seat on the box by the driver .
croaked the Jew , in his usual voice .
retorts <NAME> with a steadfast look , but without loss of temper .
' There were three things , ' said <NAME> , ' that I thought I would like to say , if you were alone and I might come up-stairs .
He is not hungry , Mrs. Bedwin , ' said the gentleman : looking very wise .
You know how sensitive I am to unkindness .
' And very much to be deplored it was , on all accounts !
Not such power of wind has blown for many a winter night .
' But , first and foremost , <NAME> , burn the box .
' O , pray don ' t punish him any more , ' cried <NAME> .
We don ' t want any documents .
' Here ' s sport ! ' he cried , ' sport ready to my hand , all invented and arranged , and only to be enjoyed .
The family room looked very small and very mean , and the downward staircase by which it was attained looked very narrow and very crooked .
' I couldn ' t write like that , now-a-days .

' Peek -- christian name ; Weeks -- surname ; good , ver good .
Try the antidote , ' rejoined <NAME> ; ' and may it give you a brighter and better view of the case !
The trial came on at once , and , when he was put to the bar , he was seated in a chair .
' Jupiter ! ' exclaimed <NAME> , ' what an unsophisticated shepherd you are , <NAME> !
She had a curious propensity to call Mrs. Bounderby ' Miss Gradgrind , ' and yielded to it some three or four score times in the course of the evening .

Or that night , when I frowned at him ?
' " Will you never love any one but me -- never marry any one beside ? " said the young lady .
' I didn ' t do anything in particular , ' said <NAME> .
However , men always think they know best .
Sometimes she ' s proud and won ' t touch it for a length of time ; sometimes she ' s so poor that she must have it .
' You shall not escape me in this way , you morose backwoodsman , ' retorts <NAME> .
' The next I make for you , I hope will be made less clumsily .
' Good master ? ' inquired <NAME> .
Both of us did business with him .
Why , from you. " " I never told you. " " Told me !

He needed some such touch then .

There was a kettle on the hob , as there had been night and day for fifteen years .
It is singularly well conducted by <NAME> , a comic actor of great quiet humour and originality , who is well remembered and esteemed by <NAME> playgoers .
What did you expect me to do ?
It will naturally be very painful to him to find that you are singular in your character and conduct .
You have regularly given me up .
Also that I can accept no second or inferior position .
No man 's life here is worth purchase .
So they told him yes again .
' He don ' t seem to care about his dress , ' thought <NAME> , ' and yet how capitally he does it .
So goes the wintry day outside the <NAME> mansion .
' If you please. ' ' Or would next day , ' said Mr Dombey , ' suit your engagements better ? ' ' I have no engagements .
' It was <NAME> who did that , I KNOW , ' said <NAME> predictively .
Thank you , thank you. ' He felt that it was better to respect her entreaty , and did not move while her slight form went quickly away from him .
said <NAME> , stirring his tea , and looking up into the matron 's face ; 'are _you_ hard-hearted , Mrs .
I am going there now for my lesson .
" Very good ; I see by these portraits that you take a strong interest in the fashionable great , sir ? "
<NAME> answered the summons , and <NAME> raised his eyes stealthily to his face , as if he almost feared to read there , a knowledge of his recent thoughts .
<NAME> unknowns , amazed to find how intimately they know Veneering , pluck up spirit , fold their arms , and begin to contradict him before breakfast .
' No , I do not indeed , ' replied <NAME> .
' You were speaking about its being a girl , ' said <NAME> .
' These are my holidays. ' ' Are they , by <NAME> ! ' muttered <NAME> , with his eyes on the passion-wasted face .
' I 'll run all the way , sir . '
His face grew purple ; his eyes were starting from his head , and with protruded tongue , he seemed to mock me .
Many thousands are in want of common necessaries ; hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts , sir . "
I say 'Mighty potentate , here IS my homage !
" Go before me and show me all those dreadful places .
Was it an unequal marriage in point of years , this unlucky job of yours ? ' said <NAME> .
The effort of resolution necessary to the achievement of this purpose I found to be quite awful .
But prominent in it was a draped table with a gilded looking-glass , and that I made out at first sight to be a fine lady 's dressing-table .
<NAME> had the honour to support her , and <NAME> was placed upon the chairman ' s right ; the <NAME> and the <NAME> sustained the vice .

What else is so extremely charming !
' So he is very impressible .
The strange man said nothing but made another snort .
It was no unfit messenger of death , who had disturbed the quiet of the matron 's room .
' What can it mean ? ' she thought , as she accompanied him up stairs .
<NAME> and death went hand in hand ; wealth and poverty stood side by side ; repletion and starvation laid them down together .
My mother glances submissively at them , shuts the book , and lays it by as an arrear to be worked out when my other tasks are done .
" I did n't see YOU , " says <NAME> .
' With the blessing of <NAME> , <NAME> , ' returned <NAME> .
' I am sure I didn ' t myself .
No boat would then be hired for the purpose , and no boatmen ; that would save at least a chance of suspicion , and any chance is worth saving .
<NAME> <NAME> smokes with a profound meaning after this and surveys <NAME> in silence .
This tall man , <NAME> , is a rascally adventurer .
' But I will not allow it .
I had the honour of making a great success then ; I hope to have the honour of making a great success now .
Oliver tried to reply but his tongue failed him .
That young lady was , no doubt , an acquisition to the <NAME> .
Rather a curious speculation how <NAME> would otherwise have disposed of his leisure until Doomsday .
<NAME> , sir ? ' ' <NAME> is a great thing in these cases , ' observed <NAME> .
replied the <NAME> , " do you believe in me or not ? "
' So have I , ' said the stranger .
I had no difficulty in recognizing either <NAME> or <NAME> ' s children .
There would have been loss , disgrace , I don ' t know what at all .
<NAME> <NAME> merely shakes the finger at her .
Satisfied that her dwelling was safe , she drew one hand through the old man ' s arm and prepared to ply her crutch-stick with the other .
" You speak so feelingly and so manfully , <NAME> , that I thank you with all my heart , and will open all my heart -- or nearly so .
In came the three <NAME> , beaming and lovable .
The others follow ; and there is a blithe and merry ringing , as of a little peal of marriage bells .
' I ' ll look in upon you to-morrow , young man .
' You are the next ? ' muttered the Manager .
I have done with the red coat , believe me .
Not that it required much penetration to say that , because I knew that his being there at all was an act of kindness .
The strong tide filled his throat , and bore him on , upon its rapid current .
" What has ever got your precious father then ? "
This produced a settled gloom , which in time developed a morbid insanity , and finally terminated in raving madness .
" On the wings of the wind , " replied the <NAME> .
' Codicil among the dust ? ' another guesses .
Has <NAME> been disturbed ?
" <NAME> ! " I exclaimed , in amazement .
He had no occasion to say after that that he had conceived an aversion for my patron , neither had I occasion to confess my own .
She came out from behind it , with her work in her hand , and joined him in surveying me .
Why , what have you got there , <NAME> ?
She ses to me she ses 'are you the boy at the inkwhich ? '
Not this world , oh , not this !
He would have thought , even if there were no such design as that , had he brought him there to play with his repressed emotions , and torment him ?
' I -- I drink your health with cheerfulness , Mrs. Mann ' ; and he swallowed half of it .
An appropriate remembrance , presenting an exemplary model for imitation , is revived in the woman ' s mind by the sight of the place .
It do come in , and it do not come in .
'That is my name , ' said the old gentleman .
<NAME> becomes known to Mrs. Nickleby and <NAME> .
' Are you a cricketer ? ' inquired <NAME> of the marksman .
' I should sleep the worse , ' answered <NAME> , impatiently .
Therefore , I followed him without a word , to a retired nook of the garden , formed by the junction of two walls and screened by some rubbish .
<NAME> Leicester is apprehensive that my <NAME> , not being very well , will take cold at that open window .
there is a likeness , ' said <NAME> , after some reflection .
He looked in at the <NAME> .
" Will you come and dine with me ? "
A little more elbow-room is all we want here .
It were better not to know .
He has all Tulkinghorn 's , and an excellent business besides .
See what a pleasant path ; and there ' s the bird -- the same bird -- now he flies to another tree , and stays to sing .
My aunt leaned her elbow on the little round table that she usually kept beside her , and eyed him attentively .
For the rest , it is my Refuge. " " They say , those boastful <NAME> , that it is the <NAME> of many .
' I do not seek to know where these dreadful people live , but where will you be walking or passing at any settled period from this time ? '
The scent of the restoratives that had been tried was pungent in the room , but had no fragrance in the dull and languid air the lady breathed .
He was as good as his word , and started directly .
It is thought better that his old housekeeper should give him <NAME> 's letter , the contents of which no one knows or can surmise .
But my godmother wrote a stiff letter declining for me , and I never went .
' No , I have got it ; here it is , ' said Mr Boffin , dusting it with the sleeve of his coat .
By little and little it revealed itself to be a woman 's -- a lady 's -- <NAME> 's .
His coming back was a venture , he said , and he had always known it to be a venture .
' Shut the shop-door ! ' he then said to his daughter , putting the glass suddenly down .
But before I remove one jot of these stains , I must hear the whole from you .
He dresses at that gentleman ( by whom he is patronized ) , talks at him , walks at him , founds himself entirely on him .
inquired the Jew , with eagerness .
Even the children were instructed , each to dip a wooden spoon into <NAME> ' s pot , and pledge us in its contents .
In a word , they were married , and had gone into the church for no other purpose .
" I am the son of your housekeeper , <NAME> , and passed my childhood about this house .
A gloomy house the <NAME> , with sordid signs on it of having been , through its long existence as <NAME> , in miserly holding .
' <NAME> hundred and twenty-seven pound , four and ninepence ha ' penny , ' replied <NAME> , without moving a limb .
" You know I do n't , " said I .
' Let me see , ' said the legal authority .
I 'll tell you why , Pip. " He had taken up the poker again ; without which , I doubt if he could have proceeded in his demonstration .
I only got my chest away by means of a friend as nobody ' s a match for .
Do you think -- ' ' I never quite thought so , ' said <NAME> , more to herself than him .
<NAME> is pretty well acquainted with these proceedings .
Kneeling down and pouring out her thankfulness with uplifted hands , her thanks were for her father .
If you are , you must take yourself off , Mrs. Peg -- or be taken off .
' Some friend of his , as welcome here as he , ' said the old man .
' Come along with me , I ' ve got something to tell you. ' ' Where am I ? ' said <NAME> .
Dear <NAME> , dear <NAME> , take me back again , and give me back the dear old name !
<NAME> <NAME> brings a chair and diminishes his shadow .
Not even in that childish walk of long ago , were they so far removed from all the world about them as to-day .
And it 's really very hard , " said <NAME> .
" But you might know it , " observed the gentleman .
she cried , jumping fiercely up : her face flushed , and her eyes starting from her head -- ' I robbed her , so I did !
I know it was then and there that I had it .
The lady lay upon her bed as he had left her , clasping her little daughter to her breast .
<NAME> ' ever , it warn ' t paid , and so they cuts the water off .
He followed directly , and met <NAME> on the stair .
' A personal discussion , <NAME> , my love ?
I do mean to say , however , that the whole facts , taken together , will be sufficient to justify you , in the minds of all reasonable men .
There is adaptability of character in <NAME> .
No full-bottomed wig , no red petticoats , no fur , no javelin-men , no white wands .
' Why , and here ' s Fanny in tears now ! ' exclaimed <NAME> , as if in fresh amazement .
' Not a word , ' said <NAME> , making towards the door on tiptoe .
' Really musical , isn ' t it , my dear Copperfield ? ' said <NAME> .
But when the time of trial came , the younger brother ' s heart was full of those old days .
A few bilious Britons there were who would not subscribe to this article of faith ; but their objection was purely theoretical .
Debilitated cousin thinks -- country 's going -- Dayvle -- steeple-chase pace .
During this space he had not been to his mother ' s dismal old house .
From each arm , she unclasped a diamond bracelet , flung it down , and trod upon the glittering heap .
" Jobling , " says <NAME> , " myself and our mutual friend Smallweed -- " <NAME> modestly observes , " Gentlemen both ! "
Have you posts of profitable pecuniary emolument ?
Another friendly demonstration towards him Mr Wegg now regularly gratified .
" Is this a healthy place to live in , <NAME> , do you think ? "
Mrs. Rouncewell is in attendance and receives <NAME> 's customary shake of the hand with a profound curtsy .
What those treasures are they keep so secret that the court is maddened .
<NAME> <NAME> ( still grave ) inquires if to-morrow morning , now , would suit , in case he should be as for'ard as he expects to be .
THAT I have discovered beyond the possibility of doubt .
" You are a good man and a true friend , " said <NAME> , in an altered voice .
But I do mean it ! ' retorted Kit .
And now , what have you got to say next ? ' ' Merely this , <NAME> , ' he returned .
I can be happier in nothing than in your happiness .
And the natural consequence is , as anybody but a baby might have foreseen , that he prowls and wanders .
He was to be away a long , long time .
They were all about the new house .
' Everybody must feel it so. ' ' I feel it more than other people , ' said Mrs. Gummidge .
" Do n't you contradict when there ai n't no occasion , and you wo n't be took in that way .
" Oh , <NAME> , you would never guess ! "
' Is this Captain <NAME> ' s house ? ' ' No , ' said <NAME> .
How does it act ? ' Which he was not prepared to elucidate .
' You don ' t mean to tell me , ' said <NAME> , as his eyes brightened , ' that her brother ' s dead ?
'No , ' replied <NAME> , ' I would rather you remained here . '
' Is the _Independent_ still in being ? ' ' The <NAME> , sir , ' replied <NAME> , ' is still dragging on a wretched and lingering career .
He guided himself by it , no doubt. " " No doubt , " said I .
And few people knew of it .
'Come here , you born devil !
It is not in my power to retrace , one by one , all the weary phases of distress of mind through which I passed .
' Let us begone from this place , and never turn back or think of it again .
' You remember the night of our first tea-drinking ? ' said <NAME> .
You must know that I have done no good this long time .
I won ' t be led on into a discussion .
My dear friend , can I ever repay you ? ' ' <NAME> ' t talk of it , ' replied <NAME> .
A dog growled as he touched the handle of a room-door ; and a man 's voice demanded who was there .
I have never seen her yet .
' You ' re too milk and watery with our friend , you are indeed , ' remonstrated <NAME> , with a disapproving shake of his wooden head .
' You are going through , sir ? ' said the coachman .
I was hungry , but before I had swallowed a morsel , he began a running sum that lasted all through the breakfast .
' I hate him. ' ' What do you hate him for , my dear ? ' asked Squeers .
<NAME> had him down , and his knee was on his throat , when <NAME> pulled him back with a look of alarm , and pointed to the window .
' In-deed ! ' ' He has just been speaking to me , ' said <NAME> , in breathless explanation .
Well , <NAME> , that as I was mentioning is what they 're up to . "
Even then , I did exercises for other boys , and seldom did my own. " " And why not ? " " God knows .
At any rate , you know it now .
says <NAME> , opening another door and glaring in with his bull's-eye .
' Have you any little thing of that kind in hand , sir ? ' inquired the favoured gentleman in blue , drawing a toothpick from his waistcoat pocket .
It is my bounden duty to you .
And now they had come to the time when they must beg their bread .
' To the old country , sir , ' I rejoin .
" What is the matter with you ? "
And does it seem to me that I am about to deprive <NAME> of his share in such possessions , which are his only birthright ! '
<NAME> , ' said <NAME> , at the expiration of a few minutes .
This seemed to have been her principal inducement , originally , for taking up her residence there .
If it 's not in any way disagreeable to you , you 'll oblige me by doing the same .
' I think I remember having had a few interviews like that , with ladies out of doors .
repeats <NAME> with awful politeness .
" They 'll do as they are ?
But as you wisely pointed out to me , I can ' t do that , for it would look like guilt .
' If it really was a party ! ' she thought once , as she sat there .
<NAME> <NAME> that their political opinions are identical .
There is the <NAME> , who is Providence to five hundred thousand men .
There being not the least constraint in his manner , there was none ( or I think there was none ) in mine .
' We shall go by the stage-coach .
' Not what enough ? ' said <NAME> .
' They ' re usually kept in carawans to wait upon the dwarfs , ' said Mr Vuffin .
'The will , ' said <NAME> , speaking for him , 'was in the same spirit as the letter .
You ' d better not keep on pulling his ears , please .
<NAME> <NAME> was copying music ( I recollect , it was a new song , called ' Affection ' s <NAME> ' ) , and <NAME> was painting flowers .
' Girl number twenty , ' said the gentleman , smiling in the calm strength of knowledge .
' Why shouldn ' t he ? ' A murmur of assent ran through the company .
Any police down there ? ' ' Here , <NAME> , ' was official rejoinder .
' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , gently , ' I am not quite well , and I have been weeping .
'Indeed you may believe me .
Catching up from the table a piece of bread , and taking his <NAME> ' s bundle under his arm , <NAME> immediately followed him .
" I am much obliged to you .
No relief or security from him for a moment .
Are we pretty fresh and cheerful sir -- eh , Mr <NAME> ? ' ' Pretty well , sir , ' replied <NAME> .
' Oh , ask your friend to come here , <NAME> , ' said Mrs. <NAME> .
Before it is possible to make any arrangement at all compatible with this novel state of things , the ship rights .
He is not ' brought down , ' these observers think , by sorrow and distress of mind .
' There is no teaching here , I suppose ? ' ' There has been , ' said Mrs. Crummles .
The rain fell heavily , drearily .
That Mrs <NAME> had always sat at the head of his table , and done the honours of his house in a remarkably lady-like and becoming manner .
When I told him No , he said she must have gone down then , and yet she " took up too , " when she left there .
' The ride will do his master good , at all events , ' observed my aunt , glancing at the papers on my table .
They most willingly and cheerfully do their duty to all of us who are employed here , and we try to do ours to them .
Always the identical same. ' ' It doesn ' t taste so .
<NAME> 's is so great apparently , " mutters the trooper , stroking his chin , " that I have as good as half a mind to go back again .
I stopped at the last full stop to read all this over .
<NAME> <NAME> looked very hard at the man ' s face , but his features were immovable , so he noted down the fact forthwith .
<NAME> <NAME> said , " Very much so . "
<NAME> and ruin came on me , I say .
' It will amuse me. ' ' Oh !
I thought she had had some fear that her unhappy father might be in some way to blame for what had happened .
' I should have been very sorry not to have been at home when you and <NAME> went away , sir , ' rejoined <NAME> .
' We ' re sure to catch them , I think , ' said he .
'No other , take my word for it . '
It 's only me as is written to .
' This is strange news , ' said <NAME> .
He was the dead image of the sun in old woodcuts , his hair and whiskers answering for rays all around him .
<NAME> <NAME> 's mother was so diverted that she rolled her head as she smiled and made a silent appeal to <NAME> with her elbow .
' I ' m a heavy sleeper , ' said <NAME> , as he flung himself on the bed .
I beg -- nay , command ! -- that you will not pounce .
The work went on , until the noon-bell rang .
But I never will desert <NAME> .
Is it there ? ' ' Here it is ! ' said I .
The boat floated into the wharf to which it belonged .
It ' s down my throat again and can ' t come up .
' Off at once , ' replied <NAME> .
I 'm a soldier 's wife and accustomed to travel my own way .
Yes , let us go now .
There was no harm in his trade .
' I can never be grateful enough to you , <NAME> , I am sure , ' said <NAME> , with the sweetest smile imaginable .
" Why , they killed him , " says <NAME> , " on account of his having so much cheek .
Do you know what you 're doing ? '
' Did he say whether he had any business to speak about ? ' inquired <NAME> , after a little impatient consideration .
<NAME> alone , Mr <NAME> locked his outer door , and came back to his fire .
' So am I , <NAME> , ' rejoined <NAME> .
I have been in prison for threatening the solicitor .
' Why the fact is , ' replied Mr Toots , ' that it ' s the young woman I come from .
Still , when you say there is no change for the better , I must , as a bare matter of fact , deny that . "
oh dear , oh dear , what an edged tool you are ! ' ' <NAME> ' t play with me then , ' said <NAME> impatiently .
( " I really think this must be a man ! " was <NAME> 's breathless reflection , simultaneously with his coming against the wall . )
'Oh , I dare say about that , yer know , ' observed <NAME> , backing towards the door , and shaking his head with a kind of sober alarm .
I want to speak to <NAME> , quite alone. ' I promise that she shall , immediately ; but I can not leave her , for my grief .
Yet , no one had followed them , and no man spoke when they entered the wine-shop , though the eyes of every man there were turned upon them .
The looms , and wheels , and <NAME> all out of gear for an hour .
The <NAME> is about to bow to the bar when the prisoner is presented .
Why , I recollect old <NAME> quite a little boy , don ' t you ?
I resolved that they should not know .
Come and see us. ' ' Oh , it ' s of no consequence , thank you ! ' Mr Toots would blushingly rejoin .
' I wish it was <NAME> , sir , ' said <NAME> .
It ' s very cheap. ' The old man , notwithstanding his fatigue , would have remained in the churchyard all night if his new acquaintances had remained there too .
What matter , my dear ? ' ' Mr .
For many hours , they had little hope of his surviving ; but grief is strong , and he recovered .
" Esther certainly does think so . "
I must speak to you for myself , since there is no one about me whom I could ask to do so .
The drone said unaffectedly , " You will excuse me ; I really can not attend to the shop !
It is the next difficult thing to an impossibility to imagine <NAME> without Mrs. Rouncewell , but she has only been here fifty years .
It seemed that he wanted to know whether all these were brothers and sisters of his ?
I asked after a good deal of hesitation .
' They are both alive. ' ' Both ! ' repeated <NAME> , in a low voice .
I am willing to take charge of you , <NAME> , and to educate you , and provide for you .
I view it , steadily , as an investment .
He had not been there with me ; all the noses were straight in my day .
But I always say that and have never doubted it .
Is it your pleasure , sir , that we decline and we fall ? ' with a feint of taking up the book .
Had he that deep-seated recondite complaint , and did any doctor find it out ?
' When are you relieved ? ' asked <NAME> .
You treated me falsely , ungratefully , and cruelly .
Not much in the habit of travelling by rail myself , <NAME> , but gentlemen frequently say so. ' ' Do many gentlemen come here ?
Get up and bustle about , and do n't come over me with your woman 's nonsense . '
As it was , he laid a finger on his lips , and looked towards her brother .
He had taken service with the prisoner , in good faith and simplicity , four years ago .
' Good-night , <NAME> ! ' returned <NAME> softly .
He ascends the door-steps and is gliding into the dusky hall when he encounters , on the top step , a bowing and propitiatory little man .
( She really was there , I have since found , both before the deed and after it . )
' Not a bit , ' replied the sage <NAME> , with an air of vast experience .
This is a swimmer , sir , this fellow -- a diver , <NAME> save us !
' Perhaps <NAME> ' s <NAME> has gone there , <NAME> , ' observed <NAME> , turning to her .
' Would you remember a message to your sister , <NAME> , if I was to charge you with one ? ' ' Well ?
It was beginning to rain fast .
There never was , there never had been , there never again should be , such a man as Mr Merdle .
Is there anything else he ' d like ?
All here , yourself excepted , saw the King take it , in his carriage in the street , sitting beside the Queen .
But now he can only whisper , and what he whispers sounds like what it is -- mere jumble and jargon .
" I am sure THAT 'S very natural ! "
' And such a mother , ' observed Mr Dombey , bowing with some confused idea of being complimentary to <NAME> .
' And your respected father , ' said Mr Casby , ' is no more !
The old lady began to rummage in her pocket for her spectacles .
' Always hope ; that ' s a dear boy .
" It may be , partly , because I know nothing of the value of money , " said <NAME> , " but I often feel this .
' They taks such as offers .
No more wishing one ' s self dead now .
'This is not the place I went to sleep in . '
As I might have expected , he had none at all .
' What kind of compromise would you recommend ? ' inquired <NAME> .
His movements might have been planned to gain for him , in getting beyond their reach , twelve hours ' advantage ?
" And so have you , sir .
" In secret , too , " grumbled the gaoler , looking at the written paper .
' Yes , my good friend , ' said my aunt .
" My heart aches for him ; that it does ! "
I sha n't disgrace it when the time comes . '
But get up , get up ! "
' That ' s capital ! ' said <NAME> , giving it a kiss .
<NAME> Snagsby standing at his shop-door looking up at the clouds sees a crow who is out late skim westward over the slice of sky belonging to <NAME> 's Court .
<NAME> <NAME> had been spending a few days with a neighbouring friend , and had only just returned to the parental roof .
Within an hour or two from this. " " It will be dark soon after four .
I know that this is a long voyage .
Three , four , five , guineas , you would consider handsome , I dare say . "
He did n't say so before <NAME> , he only said so to me .
Appearances indicated that this establishment was a very recent institution .
That ' s just the wery sort o ' thing he ' d do .
' <NAME> , sir , ' said <NAME> .
It broke up the establishment .
' Why -- no , I haven ' t exactly dined , ' said Mr Merdle .
He pressed a penny into his hand , and gave vent to his feelings ( as did his exemplary wife also ) , in a shout of approving laughter .
She is a tall , dark , black-eyed , fine figure of a woman .
But the commentary upon it now indelibly written in his handsome face made it far more distressing than it used to be .
" Oh , it 's not the trouble , " returned <NAME> ; " the question is , if there IS any . "
' Get into a little training , and we will have a few score miles together .
I heard that <NAME> had turned him out of doors , in consequence ; and that Mrs. and <NAME> had been in a sad way , ever since .
The old woman shook her head .
' No , no , no ! ' shrieked the other , stamping on the ground with the energy of a madman .
That he laid his other hand upon the <NAME> ' s arm , causing him to look up with an abstracted air .
Three or four hours were not a long time after years .
That I am too old ? " said <NAME> .
He is not a living skeleton , I suppose. ' ' Very far from it , ' said <NAME> , with unspeakable expression .
Fairly. ' ' What a dreadfully conscientious fellow you are , <NAME> !
Some of my readers may have an interest in being informed whether or no any portions of the <NAME> Prison are yet standing .
To avoid being too abrupt , I then spoke of the <NAME> and of <NAME> .
' <NAME> prospect , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
There is something else upon its flight besides the wind and clouds .
It broke from one line in the table of commandments at the altar , and illuminated the building with the words .
replied Sikes : appearing at the head of the stairs , with a candle .
<NAME> <NAME> , <NAME> , the <NAME> Guardsman !
" I can bear it , dear <NAME> .
' Six foot inside that wall is Mrs. Sapsea. ' ' Not really Mrs. Sapsea ? ' ' Say Mrs. Sapsea .
If <NAME> has a half-holiday , do as much for <NAME> Orlick. " I suppose he was about five-and-twenty , but he usually spoke of himself as an ancient person .
You ' ll be delighted with him .
" No , no , " said <NAME> , " I am in earnest .
We would all be gentlefolks together , then .
He was overjoyed to see us and dismounted with great alacrity .
I understand that we speak together in confidence .
why didn ' t you say at first that you was willing to come down handsome ? ' The matter was soon arranged , as the turnkey had foretold .
He joined it once again , and wondering why and whither he had gone , accompanied it until they reached an iron gate .
' Well , I think I should .
' Cinderella , dear child , ' the old man expostulated , ' will you never rest ? ' ' Oh !
" He has a stake in the country , " says <NAME> , " I have no doubt .
' What I have made up my mind about has nothing to do with you .
" But it 's all like you .
So <NAME> laid it on the table and went to bed , and I sat looking at it without taking it up , thinking of many things .
Whatever word you like best .
He intended every child in it to be a modelâ€”just as the young Gradgrinds were all models .
Mr <NAME> was sure to hail this with a burst of chuckles , like the opening of a bottle of some effervescent beverage .
<NAME> says shrewdly , ' Oh a long time , bless you !
He stood pondering , and she sat looking at the dusty fire without moving , for some time .
' Yes , but not the old pain .
' Try a little more something green , sir , ' said <NAME> ; and again handed the basket .
" <NAME> , " he said , more moved than he had been from the first , " before heaven , I will be a true friend to him !
<NAME> considers a little , then remarks , turning to the woman but keeping an encouraging eye on Jo , " He is not so ungrateful as you supposed .
" You made mention of the young lady as a golden-haired doll .
Much as he admired the graces of her face and form , and freshly as they dwelt within his sensual remembrance , he had never thought her half so beautiful .
' Devil of a mess on the staircase , waiter , ' said the stranger .
Better for common sense , better for him , better for me .
How many more of them ! " exclaimed the man with the bloated face .
It is a name , <NAME> , that a man is proud to recognise .
' Clara ! ' said <NAME> , in her warning note .
' We have found a new one in that word , scout .
She ran along the sea beach , believing the old boat was theer ; and calling out to us to turn away our faces , for she was a-coming by .
" You are still on friendly terms with <NAME> ? " " Quite .
Worldly wise in hard and poor necessities , she was innocent in all things else .
'If he means to blab us among his new friends , we may stop his mouth yet . '
He didn ' t find them , and she died not long after .
" How did you find out that ? "
He likes to see a stray face or two looking in through the railings , and perhaps reading his inscription .
I am ashamed at you. ' ' My dear girl , what have I got to do with her dressing beautifully or looking well ? ' inquired <NAME> .
The neighbourhood was a dreary one at that time ; as oppressive , sad , and solitary by night , as any about <NAME> .
' We want to make a little transfer , if you please. ' ' Oh , just come in , will you ? ' said <NAME> .
And very pleasant the fire was ; for , hot though it had been yesterday , it was quite cold to-day , and the wind blew keenly .
Mr Merdle ' s right hand was filled with the evening paper , and the evening paper was full of Mr Merdle .
It was a strong grapple , and a fierce struggle , arm and leg .
It was late next morning when <NAME> awoke , from a sound , long sleep .
Confined as the limits of <NAME> are , it has its barber , its coffee-shop , its beer-shop , and its fried-fish warehouse .
A host of unpleasant misgivings , which had been crowding upon <NAME> during the whole journey , thronged into his mind with redoubled force when he was left alone .
When you say tight -- ' ' I mean tight , ' Mr <NAME> explained .
Everything was so beautiful , so compact , so neat , and in such exquisite taste , said everybody , that there really was no deciding what to admire most .
<NAME> <NAME> is found to be downstairs , by appointment .
From beneath a leaf of torn and cancelled scraps of paper , he took one letter that remained entire .
<NAME> , I may remark , had taken his full share of the general bow , and had received it with infinite condescension .
" My dear Jarndyce , " returned <NAME> , " I will do anything to give you pleasure , but it seems an idle form -- a superstition .
" She might have had the politeness to send that message at first , but it 's better late than never .
I even heard it said between them , " Shall she go ? "
He runs up the long wooden entry and finds the trooper smoking his pipe .

<NAME> set the glasses and decanters in the same corner , and <NAME> sat down to drink , and drank a good deal .
This was delightful , and gladdening to the heart of <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> lost no time in transferring this paper , with the dexterity of a conjuror , from <NAME> to <NAME> .
Not an instant , my dears ! '
I looked at him anxiously when we stopped to change , but I knew by his yet graver face as he stood watching the ostlers that he had heard nothing .
Her hair was torn and ragged , and her arms were bound to her sides with sashes and handkerchiefs .
But I know she 's got it .
We are going to walk with you .
cries <NAME> in a shrill loud voice .
I would not forward it , unless I feared the worst . '
You feel quite at home here again , I dare say ?
<NAME> recked Mr Podsnap of the traps and toils besetting his <NAME> .
The butcher and the porkman painted up , only the leanest scrags of meat ; the baker , the coarsest of meagre loaves .
If people find I have any about me that fit ' em , they can put ' em on and wear ' em , if they like .
'You were not awake an hour ago ? '
The way in which you are resolved and determined to disgrace us on all occasions , is really infamous .
The stumping approach of <NAME> was soon heard behind it , and as it turned upon its hinges he became visible with his hand on the lock .
He may sleep on now .
You was a spy -- witness at the <NAME> .
I do n't think I should have done so , if I had been <NAME> .
But <NAME> knew the danger , and <NAME> knew the danger , and all their followers and hangers-on had the clearest possible perception of the danger .
You can not proceed in this affair , <NAME> -- impossible ! ' ' Quite ! ' said the dignified Payne .
" <NAME> me when I ask you , not now .
You ' ve come at last , have you ? ' ' Why have you not sent to me ? ' said <NAME> .
I was very young , and had no adviser .
It was the <NAME> , you know .
So when the trooper reappears with his , " Had n't you better go to bed , miss ? "
Still , the same quiet life went on at the little cottage , and the same cheerful serenity prevailed among its inmates .
The sergeant ran in first , when we had run the noise quite down , and two of his men ran in close upon him .
I don ' t mean to be reproachful either .
Her gleesome voice and merry laugh were the sweetest music of their home .
Yet , what was to be done ?
I tell you , my good Esther , when he and I were on those terms which he found so convenient , we were not on natural terms . "
Ugly , misshapen , peevish , ill-conditioned , ragged , dirty -- but beloved !
Our conference was held in the state parlor , which was feebly lighted by one candle .
Dependants , to respect us , must be -- ha -- kept at a distance and -- hum -- kept down .
asked the woman , resting herself against a bank , and looking up with the perspiration streaming from her face .
<NAME> candles , ' replied Mrs. Corney , slightly returning the pressure .
But he let it go , and it closed with a loud noise .
" It draws , " says Jo , " as heavy as a cart . "
He shall not , through any suppression of mine , be informed of a part of it , and kept in ignorance of another part of it .
He fervently replied that indeed indeed they would have been .
She wondered what he was thinking of , as he looked at <NAME> and her .
" I was saying , what do you think <NAME> , " pursues <NAME> , " of enlisting ? "
They had run from drunkards .
I said I never would believe that it was your doing. ' ' That was right ! ' said the child eagerly .
But , your bringing-up was different from mine ; mine was a real thing , by <NAME> !
As it is , I don ' t think I can do with anythin ' under a female markis .
And it surely can not be a little thing that causes you so much uneasiness .
" Do you wish to hold any conversation with me in private ? "
" But I do n't ask what you think of myself ; I ask what you think of the prison . "
She looked up in <NAME> ' s face , and smiled through her tears .
' She will speak differently in a little time. ' I don ' t know what he would have said in answer .
But you know what I know , <NAME> , and it may not be so very easy as it seems , after all .
There was a sudden bump -- a loud crash- -away rolled a wheel , and over went the chaise .
So with the churchyard on a branch of the solitary way to the night ' s sleeping-place .
The lady turned aside her head .
If he mean this ironically , it may be truer than he thinks .
What material ? ' ' <NAME> , ' returned Mrs General , ' at present forms too many opinions .
" I am sorry to learn that the same state of mind has got this Gridley into new troubles and that he is in hiding , " said my guardian .
Who is this in pain ! " And I used to cry out , " O my blessed children , it ' s poor me .
'Do n't scruple to answer freely , man .
I thank you for disclosing your schemes , which I am now prepared for .
'Very curious , indeed , ' observed the doctor .
His whole material and immaterial life is wonderfully strange ; his death , the strangest thing of all .
Then I went to bed too .
<NAME> , ' she went on in a steady , straight way , without regarding this , ' asks me to marry him .
cried a voice from below , in reply to a whistle from the Dodger .
' Ask the favour of the lady ' s name. ' The lady ' s name is <NAME> .
I am looking at the fire. ' ' You seem to find more to look at in it than ever I could find , ' said <NAME> .
But competition , competition -- new invention , new invention -- alteration , alteration -- the world ' s gone past me .
He stood with his lovely burden in his arms , gazing vacantly on the countenances of his friends , without the slightest attempt at recognition or explanation .
I ' ve led her on to tell her secret she supposed we were alone ; and you were by , God forgive me. ' ' You led her on !
My little woman has a very active mind , sir . "
" Not on any account , " returned <NAME> ; " but a public-house may keep a gentleman .
' Your mother-in-law , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' and the red-nosed man , my boy ; and the red-nosed man .
' <NAME> , <NAME> ! ' said <NAME> , ' to think that I should find you acquainted with the friend of my youth , the companion of earlier days !
But not to-day is <NAME> so occupied .
' He ' s a man of his word , and it ' s my opinion he ' ll do it , miss .
She did not say so , however , as she gave him her hand .
Of these , some were found crying under hedges and in such places , frightened at the solitude .
Have you considered what it is to undermine the confidence that should subsist between my daughter and myself ?
<NAME> Peartree may justify it to the grasp of _his_ mind thus to do his republican utmost to bring an appointed officer into contempt .
Do n't let my brother know . "
Take her away , my dear <NAME> .
You mean , do I feel as if I were settling down ? "
The finger-marks are something whiter for the instant , but he walks on at her side .
<NAME> encouraged herself with a final twitch , and went in .
' Upon my word , it ' s quite extraordinary ! ' ' Open the door , ' said <NAME> , ' I ' ve got him here .
" That was the time , sir , " answers <NAME> , faintly adjusting his whiskers .
The request was no sooner preferred , than granted .
Matters being brought to this so far satisfactory pass , and time being on the wane , Mrs. Bagnet proposes a departure .
Of dozing women-drunkards especially , you shall come upon such specimens there , in the morning sunlight , as you might seek out of doors in vain through <NAME> .
' I must try to give expression to what is in my mind ; it shall and must be spoken .
" And you get me wittles. " He tilted me again .
We once knew two famous coachmen ( they are dead now , poor fellows ) who were twins , and between whom an unaffected and devoted attachment existed .
Thus in the case of <NAME> .
There 'd be a pretty shine made if I was to go a-wisitin THEM , I think .
' I have the honour to address <NAME> , I believe ? ' said the gentleman , with a most persuasive smile .
' Has he been living with -- ? ' ' Ah , sir ! ' interposed <NAME> , confronting him again .
It was into a place of this kind that <NAME> gazed , as he sat with his hands in his pockets looking out of the window .
<NAME> , <NAME> , for dear God 's sake , for your own , for mine , stop before you spill my blood !
' <NAME> , ' echoed <NAME> ; and the ceremony of introduction was complete .
Withers believed she was in her own room .
<NAME> <NAME> makes a leg and comes forward , passing his familiar demon over the region of his mouth .
" You used to teach girls , " she said , " If you could only have taught me , I could have learnt from you !
The wildest would do her bidding -- she had a tender way with them , indeed she had ! ' <NAME> had no power to speak .
' I doen ' t know , sir , ' he replied .
But I mean a cost .
I am so happy with him .
You have your gentleman-friends , you know , and they ' ll serve you with as much of the article as you want .
I ' ll hear all I don ' t know , and say all I know .
One afternoon , late in the month of February , I came ashore at the wharf at dusk .
' What is a proctor , <NAME> ? ' said I .
At length the dish was lifted on the table , and mugs of ale having been previously set round , little <NAME> ventured to say grace , and supper began .
It will not be true .
The grounds were more than an acre and a quarter in extent , and they were filled with people !
Wishing to embrace the present occasion of finding out whether in teaching <NAME> , I should have to begin quite at the beginning , I said , " Ah !
When I came off my last voyage. ' ' Then you have not been to sea lately ? ' ' No .
They are very tender to each other at dusky street-corners , and <NAME> has visions of leading an altered and blameless existence as a serious greengrocer in <NAME> .
' No , <NAME> ; I have felt it before .
<NAME> came near me until late at night .
'He wo n't stir till it 's all safe .
But , he was girdled still with <NAME> ' s iron ring , and the rivets of the iron ring held tight .
' Will you let him go like that , when you can wring money from him ?
' What ought I to do then , <NAME> ? ' I inquired , after looking at the fire a little while .
If his progress downward had been attended with difficulties and uncertainty , his journey back was infinitely more perplexing .
" Very easily said ! " remarked <NAME> , amiably repressing a sob , while a hitch came into her upper lip , and her tears overflowed .
You have now a -- hum -- a great position to support .
'It seems to go right through one , ' added the old man , touching his side .
' No , ' said Mr Dombey , with magnificent indifference .
<NAME> had received a similar letter and had made a similar response .
' We always , in this house , propose a month -- an initiatory month .
with which the <NAME> concluded .
' Then , ' said my aunt , after a rest , ' there ' s <NAME> .
I never thought that I had a curious couple of guardians , in my aunt and <NAME> .
He went into <NAME> ' s room like light and air , brightening and refreshing it as if he were healthy weather .
In Secret The traveller fared slowly on his way , who fared towards <NAME> from <NAME> in the autumn of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-two .
' I should think not , ' said Mrs. Mann , who had of course laughed very much at <NAME> 's humour .
' Beware of that here , or you ' re a lost rascal , ' and he smiled again , and again cautioned him with his forefinger .
Like the adjoining habitation , it held such old articles of furniture as were absolutely necessary , and had its stack of fire-wood .
' I lead the life of an owl. ' ' You stripped me of the greater part of all I ever had , ' said my aunt .
Rather baulked , Mr Riderhood evasively remarked , with an innocent air , that he believed the T ' other Governor had asked him summa ' t .
" I know no more , ma'am , than the dead , " she replied , glancing compassionately at him .
Then <NAME> arose , and gathering her shawl about her , covering her face with it , and weeping aloud , went slowly to the door .
<NAME> assented , and he crept back in the shadow of the wall to his own lodging .
Your conduct has always been of the most delicate and obliging description .
There is no better among my people at home ; no better among your people. ' ' Granted .
' Save the man ! ' cried <NAME> .
Oliver did as he was desired .
She has had two sons , of whom the younger ran wild , and went for a soldier , and never came back .
We ' ll go down this way , as you may like to see the yard , and it ' s all in the road .
' I am sorry for that .
" It ca n't last for ever , " returned <NAME> with a fierceness kindling in him which again presented to me that last sad reminder .
It has n't declared anything in heaven knows how many years . "
And besides , ' said <NAME> , his teeth chattering as he spoke , 'Mr .
The Secretary inquired on what terms ?
' Hold there , you and your philanthropy , ' cried the smiling landlady , nodding her head more than ever .
' How is it possible , sir , that you ever can come right when you ' re always wrong ?
As to himself , Mr <NAME> conveyed to the <NAME> family that he was going , on rather particular business , wherever they were going .
' I can not walk tonight , <NAME> , ' returned <NAME> , hurriedly .
' My dear , it ' s not my fault , ' said the gentleman .
She was exactly the same as when they had parted , just as handsome , just as scornful , just as repressed .
The great point of our agreement is yet to come .
Mrs. <NAME> wrote a letter of introduction to my guardian in behalf of her eloquent friend <NAME> .
I also desire to live in amity with my professional brethren .
How do you like the law , <NAME> ? ' ' My dear Copperfield , ' he replied .
None of your live languages for <NAME> .
'You keep ready , and leave the rest to me . '
I can not make up my mind. ' ' Nor I , ' said <NAME> .
' This very night , sir , ' replied <NAME> .
B. fifty thousand times ! ' ' Do not interrupt , rude man ! ' said <NAME> .
" At the foot of the same chair there lies a dirty bit of thin red cord that they tie up pens with .
You shall have the books . '
My aunt and <NAME> were there , busily making some little extra comforts , in the way of dress , for the children .
The mother had moaned in her sleep and moved .
Out-of-the-way villages there , they tell me .
I know of several cases such as I describe , my <NAME> , and I think they indicate to me my own course now . "
<NAME> , wet , and fatigue are sufficient causes for my being found dead , but I shall die of others , though I suffer from these .
I know it to be unnecessary and calculated to awaken speculation , doubt , rumour , I do n't know what , in the house .
' This here ' s old <NAME> ' s nevy Wal ' r .
The men who had turned back were among the group ; and its central figures were <NAME> and <NAME> .
There were indeed four sides to the counting-house , but he avoided that one where the window was , deeming it probable that <NAME> would be looking out of it .
He cast his small eyes , first on <NAME> , and then on <NAME> , but said nothing .
" Hear this ! " he helplessly exclaimed to the elements .
' I will restore to you what I have withheld from you .
A visible effect was produced immediately , several jurymen beginning to take voluminous notes with the utmost eagerness .
It is my turn again , <NAME> .
I had not been conscious of it .
I will carry it into no blood but my own ; and the reproach shall rest alone on me . '
I ' m sure I have ! ' ' My brother , ' pursues <NAME> profoundly , ' is so peculiar -- so strange a man .
A letter , under date <NAME> , from a colonist of the name of <NAME> , asking for the particulars of your address , on behalf of <NAME> .
<NAME> ! " " What else could I do ? " " You did that , and that would be enough , without more .
But his spirit was roused at last ; the cruel insult to his dead mother had set his blood on fire .
Moved by the gentle beauty of the scene , the prince sank upon the green turf , and bathed his swollen feet in his tears .
I felt reluctant to be present , when <NAME> first met his sister and <NAME> ; and made <NAME> my excuse for lingering behind .
' But what , ' said <NAME> , as she watched the carving of the fowls , ' makes them pink inside , I wonder , <NAME> !
Little Lucie she taught , as regularly , as if they had all been united in their English home .
<NAME> looked down in hers , and smiled through his .
I shall trust my remembrances then , my sweet nurse , in your hands , and I well know they couldn ' t be in better .
<NAME> 's finishing the sentence restores her to favour .
Resolved , as your discriminating good sense perceives , that if you was to have a sap -- pur -- IZE , it should be a complete one !
I could say nothing in reply ; for who could offer hope , or consolation , to the abject being before me ?
In the drawing-room of which mansion , there presently entered to them the most remarkable girl <NAME> had ever seen .
So , to the <NAME> as before : where <NAME> and <NAME> were handed out , and whence they all went on foot to Mrs <NAME> ' s .
<NAME> thought it was , too , but he held his peace .
' The mother now sought to caress her , but poor <NAME> repelled her , preferring to be with her acquaintances .
Yet the cold was merciful , for it was the cold night air and the rain that restored me from a swoon on the stones of the causeway .
May ' Yes , <NAME> , yes. ' But <NAME> glanced towards the door , as if he thought his principal might appear there , unseasonably .
In capital B ' s and H ' s most of the girls under <NAME> ' s tuition were half a year ahead of every other letter in the alphabet .
There is not a drop of <NAME> 's corrupted blood but propagates infection and contagion somewhere .
At length <NAME> came back -- provokingly cool , and with papers in his hand , and a pen in his mouth , as if nothing had happened .
Towards the last , I could understand some few syllables that she said to me , by placing my ear close to her lips .
I therefore pleaded another engagement ; and observing that Mrs. Micawber ' s spirits were immediately lightened , I resisted all persuasion to forego it .
May I mention something ? ' ' Oh , please don ' t be practical ! ' said <NAME> , coaxingly .
This is what I meant when I said in my note that I had a great favour and a great assistance to beg of you .
That ' s your name. ' At these words , I observed the gentleman more attentively .
' Who says man and wife are bad company ?
There are very few harmless circumstances that would not seem full of perilous meaning , so considered .
<NAME> to earth , ashes to ashes , dust to dust !
' What is the matter with the men !
His household dread him too much to approach a subject on which he is resolutely dumb ; and the only person who dares question him , he silences immediately .
There is much good in it ; there are many good and true people in it ; it has its appointed place .
I believe you there ! ' ' But I love you dearly , <NAME> , ' said the child .
The man shook his fist , as he uttered these words incoherently .
The day came , but not the bridegroom .
One can not say that it is all anxiety or all weariness ; yet it is both , and like ungrown despair . "
The last was a S , -- Swubble , I named him .
" I do n't know that , sir ! "
I have tramped about the country , pet , and I know what I know .
I don ' t want a wife and family .
She had not been consulted on the question , any more than on the question of her coming into these terrestrial parts , to want a name .
We had now got into the month of March .
' I got at him , ' pursued <NAME> , feeling for his whisker , ' by degrees .
I have been very happy with her for some years : too happy , perhaps .
These kisses for a blessing on your head !
My sorrow may bear involuntary witness against you at the judgement <NAME> ; but my angry thoughts or my reproaches never will , I know !
" Have you brought his indentures with you ? " asked <NAME> .
" Now , let me recommend you , " pursued <NAME> , " to look it in the face .
Coax him to use his influence with the Jew .
' Widders , <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> , slightly changing colour .
" Did your ladyship , " says <NAME> , " ever happen to hear of <NAME> ? "
So we are not much alike in that particular .
" I share those feelings , " he returned .
When the door yielded , and he rushed in , what did he see there ?
' That affair of the first bond for four thousand five hundred pounds has not taken the course that was expected , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
I answer that it 's in my nature to do it , under wrong , and I must do it .
For instance , if he took his supper after a hard day , to the <NAME> March in <NAME> , his food might be likely to sit heavy on him .
He had done wonders before , but now he began to powder away like a raving mad giant .
This is a secret expedition .
I was speaking of <NAME> .
What d ' ye think it was all for ? ' ' For another tea-drinkin ' , perhaps , ' said <NAME> .
I am informed of that fact because -- which I mention in confidence -- I know it in the way of my profession at <NAME> and <NAME> 's .
' <NAME> sent me over with the chay-cart , to carry your luggage up to the house .
The apprentices were the queerest little people .
The finale concluded , the dancers promenaded the room , and <NAME> and his companion stationed themselves in a corner to observe the company .
Like some other mothers , whom I have known in the course of my life , Mrs. <NAME> was far more fond of pleasure than her daughter was .
His name ? " " <NAME> , " said <NAME> , making it <NAME> by pronunciation .
You will come home in the holidays , and be a better boy. ' ' Clara ! ' <NAME> repeated .
' <NAME> , aye , ' replied <NAME> ; and on they went , as briskly as need be .
I never saw her , except upon a baggage-waggon , when she was n't washing greens ! "
Give me your nose sir ! ' ' No !
' Oh , so tranquil ! ' cried the little creature , smiling .
Are you ready to come , my dear friend ? "
She 'll never die quiet till you come , mistress . '
" My dear sir , " said <NAME> , quickening his pace , and taking the old gentleman by both his hands .
You haven ' t got polished leather boots on , ' pouting , with one shoulder raised .
If , while our bodies grow old and withered , our hearts could but retain their early youth and freshness , of what avail would be our sorrows and sufferings !
<NAME> and straw were stored in that portion of the place , fagots for firing , and a heap of apples in sand .
I thought it best to bring a sum of money for the purpose. ' ' Thank you , sir , thank you .
It was so precious to me that I look back on these trifles , now , with an aching heart .
' It can ' t have been a petrefaction. ' ' Memoirs of <NAME> <NAME> , commonly called The Walking Rushlight , sir ?
Do not think or speak of disparity between us , for there is none , except in all my many imperfections .
If she hadn ' t stood my friend , sir , I should have been shut up , to lead a dismal life these many years .
The other half served for a kitchen , and was fitted up with a stove whose small chimney passed through the roof .
' Now ain ' t this capital ? ' inquired that jolly personage , when the work of destruction had commenced .
Does he send clothes on in advance of him ?
' Does <NAME> look like the mother of six ? ' ' Quite ridiculous , ' cried the doctor .
However probable it was to him , she had heard of no such thing .
I have gone aside from my purpose ; I was speaking about our being friends .
Now , it is a fact , that there was nothing at all particular about the knocker on the door , except that it was very large .
The woman hastily lifts up her eyes as if she would deny that her injury is referable to such a cause .
Make up your mind quick , <NAME> .
What power of cannon might it take to shake that rusty old man out of his immovable composure ?
" If it 's a point of conspiracy , you need n't take the trouble to mention it .
But it came about in this way .
' Mr <NAME> ' s speeches were detestable to me , shocking to me , ' said <NAME> , startling that gentleman with another stamp of her little foot .
The window-shutters were closed ; the street was empty ; not a soul had awakened to the business of the day .
As it pleased Heaven in its mercy to restore him so soon , I should have great hope .
What do you see written there ? ' The waiter read : ' Datchery. ' ' Now you know my name , ' said the gentleman ; ' <NAME> .
' Do you know will he be long , sir ? ' asked <NAME> , with bashful hesitation .
The unusual apparition was followed by another bonnet .
Is the man born yet , is the spade wrought yet ?
' What do you think of this request , <NAME> ? ' murmured <NAME> .
The letter was lying before me just completed , when I was told that a lady waited , who wished to see me .
If these flattering attentions to herself were not sufficient proofs , <NAME> ' s confidential friend had suffered the secret to escape him in so many words .
' Can you one ? ' inquired the old lady .
' Shall I order a private room , <NAME> ? ' inquired <NAME> , when they reached the Bush .
The man who lay on the ledge of the grating was even chilled .
Mrs MacStinger in retort , looked at her all over .
Who was he ? " " Your clemency , <NAME> !
' Death of my soul ! ' he exclaimed .
Mr <NAME> , I am not quite a stranger here .
" That 's the message , " observes <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> was no less surprised , although his astonishment was not expressed in the same eccentric manner .
'Here 's somebody wants to see you , to ask you some questions , I suppose .
Imposing on you to give their Grubbers nothing but blame , and to give them nothing but credit !
<NAME> mine , <NAME> Dombey. ' ' No , no , no , ' said <NAME> , checking him in the act of impetuously pulling off his own .
<NAME> pride wouldn ' t have schoolmasters brought here , like doctors , to look at a bad case .
Quietly , quietly , all the lines of the plan of the great <NAME> melted one after another .
Her next , to go back , and to enter ; and this second impulse held her in irresolution on the staircase .
At six o ' clock every mornin ' they let ' s go the ropes at one end , and down falls the lodgers .
" For there <NAME> chords , Jobling -- " <NAME> begs pardon again .
She went to sleep with a little bracelet he had given her clasped upon her arm .
" You have just come down ? " said <NAME> , edging me a little away with his shoulder .
" Nineteen , " repeats my Lady thoughtfully .
What is it you are not ?
It ' ll begin to be carted off to-morrow. ' ' Have you been out to take leave of your old friend , sir ? ' asked <NAME> , jocosely .
'It 's a long time , ' said <NAME> .
A question now arises , with relation to his nose. ' ' Flat , ' said <NAME> .
' I know her well. ' ' Look at the broken scull .
Nor was it relieved by any glimpse of the little creature who had brought him there .
<NAME> <NAME> takes the chair , and three members of <NAME> are positively coming .
Now tell me , my love .
" Jo , " whispers the law-stationer softly as the boy lingers on the step .
We found our old lodging vacant , and in half an hour were quietly established there , as if we had never gone away .
' It is so , ' the Secretary admitted .
They must have powerful motives for a secret residence , or be reduced to a destitute condition indeed , who seek a refuge in <NAME> 's <NAME> .
Why do you listen ? ' asked the lady .
We now turned into another narrow street .
I dare say he don ' t .
' Come , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
I felt for my old self as the dead may feel if they ever revisit these scenes .
' Who is it ? ' cried <NAME> again .
' Yes , <NAME> , and supper , ' added <NAME> .
How many old recollections , and how many dormant sympathies , does <NAME> time awaken !
" It 's not convenient , " said <NAME> , " and it 's not fair .
" He is a fine young soldier now , <NAME> , by the name of <NAME> .
The object of this new liking was not among his myrmidons .
' Though as to master , ' said he , glancing again at <NAME> , ' not master onny more .
Oh , my fellow-countrymen , what warning but this did I give you ?
The <NAME> had no more tenderness or poetry in it , than the bar of a public-house .
" On the contrary , it seems to do you good , miss , judging from your appearance . "
Now you know me , do n't you ? "
Shall I remind you that I am not , and that I never was , anything but the friend whom you agreed to trust ?
A wave as of triumph ?
That time , to which he has so long , and certainly with great constancy , looked forward , is now come .
" I have got it here , sir . "
'What a pity , <NAME> , my dear , that there 's none quite ready to be done . '
<NAME> and solemn were the score of rubbers in which <NAME> and the old lady played together ; uproarious was the mirth of the round table .
he asks in an insinuating tone .
'So , you 're going on to <NAME> , are you ? '
In our boyish want of discretion I dare say we took too much to drink , and I know we talked too much .
' Well , <NAME> , ' she began , ' what do you think of the proctor plan ?
It was the face of <NAME> , and through all the terrified avoidance it expressed , there was pity in it , sorrow , a grateful tender memory .
" This woman understands me , " <NAME> thinks as she lets her glance fall again .
<NAME> was the better for it , or thought of being so .
That is his employer , gentlemen .
It ' s amazing what places they used to put the guineas in , wrapped up in rags .
' Pray , ' said <NAME> , in great confusion , while these preliminaries were in course of completion .
We had other visitors besides <NAME> .
Here are the other passengers .
' Glad to hear it , <NAME> .
I go to seek an hotel ! ' But , there his eyes encountered <NAME> , who was still at his post .
' <NAME> , ' said the Major , ' I ' m glad to see you .
' Our friend had a remote connexion with that event , ' said the Major , ' and all the credit that belongs to her , J .
'Wait quietly only one instant , while I speak to aunt . '
He had a glass and bottle in his hand , and was in the act of drinking .
Then they go upstairs , <NAME> heavily , and <NAME> ( for it is he ) very lightly indeed .
At last Mrs. Micawber resolved to move into the prison , where <NAME> had now secured a room to himself .
He had meant to go away to-day , but clung to this tie in the house as the last and only thing left to him .
I don ' t think I could have done more , then , without letting my hold on father go ; but they sometimes lie heavy on my mind .
And reassured , " Since that 's the case -- " " Yes !
Personally , or by letter , you will always find me here , sir , with my shoulder to the wheel . "
I ' m struck of a heap , and can ' t do it , ' he said , impatiently .
And what ' s this in dancing-shoes ?
" I want to know no more than I know .
Your habit of interrupting without having the least thing in the world to say , distracts one .
<NAME> and his daughter were sitting there alone .
<NAME> said he did n't believe there ever was such a goose cooked .
' Let us have some of your best wine to-day , waiter , ' said old <NAME> , rubbing his hands .
And I called him a quantity of names ; ' shaking her head over her work , and dropping tears .
Very uncomfortable. ' ' They ' re all on ' em men as has met vith some disappointment in life , ' said <NAME> , senior .
<NAME> <NAME> was excited and indignant .
That , he called with confidence on the jury to come and do likewise .
' Are you going ? ' said <NAME> , whose heart sank within her at the result of her stratagem , but who affected a light indifference notwithstanding .
Much marked with irons. ' ' Ran away , the negress Fanny .
I have no design whatever .
The key was put in the lock , and turned .
We bestow a fragment of our minds upon you , sir , you see ! "
Is he quite heartbroken ? ' <NAME> was of a tender nature , and there was something in this appeal that moved her very much .
After this , he stirred the fire ; after that , he rubbed his hands and looked at <NAME> .
There was something in the picture of <NAME> bestowing his deportment on <NAME> that quite took my fancy .
The confidences of lovely women are not to be slighted .
The stately residence of <NAME> was altogether blighted and deserted .
No struggle , no consciousness of peril , no entreatyâ€”and yet I never saw _that_ before. ' With a start .
If ever delay was dangerous , it 's dangerous now ; and if ever you could n't afterwards forgive yourself for causing it , this is the time .
The many sounds become so deadened that the change is like putting cotton in the ears , or having the head thickly muffled .
I think we had better talk about this , really , <NAME> .
He gazed for a few seconds in the face ; then stooped to kiss it -- oh , how tenderly ! -- and drew a handkerchief before it .
" I 've had the pleasure of seeing you before .
She still preserved her proud manner , but there was a touch of softness in her voice , as she answered : ' I justify nothing .
How it is so , is no matter ; that is my story , and I keep my story to myself .
His broad chest heaves with pleasure .
It had been mentioned at the <NAME> , she remarked , on the authority of the journals , that he had been kept in prison for his own safety .
Now I know ye did .
So , by <NAME> , to the <NAME> of <NAME> In <NAME> ; <NAME> ; <NAME> ; <NAME> ; <NAME> ; St. <NAME> ' s .
I much prefer it as it is. ' <NAME> , with head bent down , still clipped among the plants .
But the gallantry of her friends would not allow of this ; and the man in faded black , mounting the breach first , produced his plunder .
What could it do , his boy had asked him .
This is my frugal breakfast .
' <NAME> , ' rejoined Mrs. Sparsit , ' say no more .
<NAME> mental agitation and disturbance was no novelty to him , even before his late sufferings .
Not the curtains at his feet , nor the curtains at his back , but those to which his face was addressed .
Am I never to hear the last of this ?
He never looked so serene as he did then .
Suddenly , he took the desperate resolution to going back to <NAME> .
' Where have you worked all your life ? ' ' Mostly underground , <NAME> , ' till I got married .
His head was sunk upon his bosom ; and he slumbered again .
By dint of alternate threats , promises , and bribes , the lady in question was ultimately prevailed upon to undertake the commission .
He had no sooner adopted this resolution , than he conveyed as much honesty into his face as it was capable of expressing , and sympathised with Mr <NAME> exceedingly .
Let 'em knock me well about the head .
'There was two of 'em in it , ' continued <NAME> ; 'and they had a boy with 'em ; that 's plain from the size of the window .
'Put your head out of the winder , ' replied <NAME> .
The listener ' s blood ran colder now than ever it had done in frost and snow , but he knocked again .
I ask you , do YOU mean to tell me ? ' Mr Lammle falls silent again , and they walk as before .
The <NAME> ' s visage on these occasions presented one of the finest examples of combination and succession of expression ever observed .
I tell this lightly , but it was no light thing to me .
He ' s no public offender , bless you , now !
Veneering pervades the legislative lobbies , intent upon entrapping his fellow-legislators to dinner .
O the long , long night , with the moans of the poor wife !
" Kiss me , child of <NAME> .
The <NAME> put down the paper , took off his spectacles , and brought his eyes to bear on the deserter .
Casement windows opened , crazy doors were unbarred , and people came forth shivering -- chilled , as yet , by the new sweet air .
I asked him how he liked his profession .
I can do poor Arthur no good now , that I see ; and you needn ' t be afraid of me .
said <NAME> , filled with dismal thoughts .
He knew that she would not insist upon his leaving her .
We see <NAME> in a nose , and we know it .
Is there anything you want that would lessen the hardship of this confinement ? "
And vegetable marrows likewise. ' ' Confound his impudence ! ' said <NAME> , firing immediately .
' I ' ll teach you manners , my fine fellow , one of these fine mornings. ' ' Thank ' ee , ' said <NAME> .
You are more beautiful in anger than in repose .
' The place of their retreat is indeed discovered , ' he said , ' at last .
Is <NAME> to come along with us ? ' ' <NAME> , no , no , ' replied <NAME> , drawing back , and clinging to <NAME> .
' <NAME> ' t it a curious thing that they should run in little Altro ' s head ?
But , her courage was of that emotional nature that it brought the irrepressible tears into her eyes .
" I forgot it , " he said .
Her patience is unexhausted by hours .
But it is the obstinate custom of such creatures hardly ever to say what is set down for them .
You must endeavour , sir , to change it .
He has a very knowing look , but that he always has .
But I ' ll provide for her !
" I am a mortal , " <NAME> remonstrated , " and liable to fall . "
Do hear my words , and let me save you yet , for better things . '
' Well you see , ' said Mr Inspector , ' it was a question of making a move .
Much as <NAME> would have disliked such a service , I believe she would have retained it , for my sake , in preference to the best upon earth .
' Ah ! ' rejoined the man , taking his handkerchief out of his hat and wiping his face , ' he always will , you know .
' I know what it was , ' said <NAME> ; 'it was the gate . '
He became aware of that again .
It was accordingly settled that <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , should all wear fancy-dresses .
' I suppose you ' ve heard what ' s going forward , <NAME> ? ' said Mrs. <NAME> .
and then counted up to twelve , and said , 'Hush ! '
<NAME> , I am going to <NAME> . '
He waylays the smaller boys to punch their unprotected heads , and calls challenges after me in the open streets .
That I am greatly dissatisfied with it .
'No more of it for me , thank 'ee , <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> ; ' I 've had enough .
Except one man , who got up and went out .
' Only me , <NAME> , ' replied a woman ' s voice .
If you ' re happy or merry ever , you come here to say , along with that chap , that you ' re sorry for it .
A change had been gradually stealing over her , in the time of her loneliness and sorrow .
If I shake and tremble , as we pass the gallows , do n't you mind , but hurry on .
This dialogue made us all uneasy , and me very uneasy .
All that can be imparted , he can impart .
She sat sobbing and murmuring behind it , that , if I was uneasy , why had I ever been married ?
I ' m glad your eyes are red with crying .
He has a clog of iron on his right foot which will weigh four or five pounds. ' ' Detained at the police jail , the negro wench , <NAME> .
' Not about money , I hope ?
<NAME> , conceiving that he had silenced him effectually , could not suppress his triumph , or forbear from following up what he conceived to be his advantage .
It was difficult to believe that a night so long to me , could be short to anybody else .
' The day before yesterday , ' said <NAME> , ' your uncle received this letter .
Let him take that well to heart , ' said <NAME> .
don ' t , <NAME> Weller. ' ' Don ' t what , my dear ? ' said <NAME> .
Of a sudden , in the height of his misery , he puts <NAME> before it .
' One thing more , ' he said .
He stood looking at the gentleman , therefore , with a frightened , self-convicted , and remorseful air .
cries Mrs. Snagsby from the stairs .
<NAME> , come here ! ' The child obeyed : and Mr <NAME> took him on his knee .
" You do , " she said very shortly .
She brought her young husband home one day , and they and their young fledglings have their nest upstairs .
The sight of her in her beauty , almost changed into a woman without his knowledge , may have struck out some such moments even in his life of pride .
It may be so , to such as you who know no righteousness , and no appointment except <NAME> ' s .
' Ah , <NAME> ! ' said <NAME> , with a sigh .
'They shall understand that , ma'am ; they shall be acquainted with the true state of the case , ' said <NAME> .
" Possession is nothing to me .
How to turn a penny .
This is merely in passing .
He 'd start up from a stone coffin , to come in my way ! '
I would have done so again today ; but <NAME> was too quick for me .
' With your usual happy discrimination , my dear <NAME> , ' resumed <NAME> , ' you have hit the point at once .
Are they , though ? ' she said .
Did the phantom of such a woman flit about him on his ride ; true to the reality , and obvious to him ?
' Let them open the door .
All over , that is to say , for the time being .
The city is the seat of the local parliament of <NAME> ; and in its shady legislative halls , some orators were drowsily holding forth to the hot noon day .
The others , looking in as the first one looked , shriek and fly too , and there is an alarm in the street .
" She 's a lovely woman , too , she really is , " says <NAME> , coming back to <NAME> .
'But not the less my niece , ' cried Mrs. Maylie , folding the fainting girl in her arms ; 'not the less my dearest child .
Now , you know me ; you know I am incapable of all the higher and better flights of men .
God forgive this wretched man ! '
' Reg ' lar good land that , ' interposed another fat man .
" As if it were not natural for him to do so , guardian ; as if he could write to a better friend ! "
Open the door of one of these cramped hutches full of sleeping negroes .
' Not so much with her , as with her audiences , ' replied <NAME> .
The place in <NAME> is all alive .
I ' m as good a man as you , and better .
He played with her as a child when in that yard a child she played .
She was introduced as <NAME> , and both <NAME> and his mother called her Rosa .
' I have brought him a little something to eat , ' said the good woman .
I ' ll give it you this afternoon , Sam. ' ' You ' re wery good , sir , ' replied <NAME> .
' I will not hesitate any longer , Mr Wrayburn .
' I defy you to do it ! '
He will talk about business , and won ' t give away his time for nothing .
to the sheet , and gently lifted it away .
" How do you do ? " inquired that lady then -- sharply , and yet as if to express that she bore him no malice .
" Why , <NAME> , my dear , " said I , " what beautiful flowers ! "
' I know it , to my disappointment and regret .
<NAME> <NAME> laughed , and said oh yes , he believed so .
Across the hall , and down the steps , <NAME> led her too ; nor did he withdraw his hand until she was seated in the coach .
Her gentle tapping at the door producing no response , she opens it and peeps in ; seeing no one there , takes possession .
I announce to you that we are arrived at our last sitting on our little business .
She was up ( and , as I believe to this hour , looking for that man ) before anybody in the house was stirring .
I am not going to spend at this rate , to please you , or anybody .
The old man overheard , and laughed .
' My dear Edith , ' said the other , ' I can not help it .
<NAME> ? ' ' Feeder , ' returned Mr Toots .
And it was done -- why , how old are you ? " " Thirty-five , " said the mender of roads , who looked sixty .
People are always calling other people something .
I asked <NAME> whether he had heard if any of the other relations had any legacies ?
<NAME> <NAME> , submitting herself to his judgment , the scheme was worked out with care .
The rosy children opposite run past with hoops .
' Quite a matter of form .
still fearfully disconcerted by Mrs. <NAME> 's eye .
I shall think of it with a melancholy satisfaction when I wake up in the night .
In point of fact , we were playing at <NAME> in the <NAME> .
It was a long room , with crimson-covered benches , and wax candles in glass chandeliers .
Do you believe that I was earnest in all that ? ' ' I do !
' <NAME> ' t you yourself declared that the fellow has heaped provocations , insults , and affronts on you , or something to that effect ?
<NAME> <NAME> darted a look of contempt , which might have withered an anchor .
Seated at table in the act of drinking , Mr Dorrit still saw him through his wine-glass , regarding him with a cold and ghostly eye .
" How do you do , <NAME> ?
' A score , ' cried my aunt , with a kind of indignant pride .
Make it your own time .
The centre of the street door was perfectly covered with a great brass-plate , on which was engraved ' Mrs .
I am screaming out loud all the time I write and so is my brother which takes off my attention rather and I hope will excuse mistakes .
My hopes and fears are both fulfilled to-night .
' Then he has no business to do it , ' said <NAME> .
If you have come here to thank me , it was not necessary .
I 'm not a going to be made unlucky by _your_ sneaking .
But you are such a little oddity !
<NAME> <NAME> held it for a little while in his , with his head bowed down .
As we were close to <NAME> then , I would have stopped as a matter of course , only <NAME> would n't stop .
She lost her colour , and the old and intent expression was a constant , not an occasional , thing ; otherwise , she remained very pretty and comely .
This device I executed successfully .
My duty prosperously ended , all between us is ended . "
<NAME> is it , besides fish , as they sometimes ketches in rivers ?
<NAME> was the singer , and he sang ' When the heart of a man is depressed with care ' .
That matter I place in your hands .
But they never blushed upon a change in the new manner of her thought and speech towards her daughter .
When you say THEY say , what do you mean ?
I remember almost hoping that some better change was possible within me .
' ' Cept <NAME> ' s <NAME> , ' observed the fat man solemnly .
In the meanwhile , <NAME> would wait alone by the fire for the Doctor .
<NAME> Leicester writes upon the slate .
' <NAME> ! ' cried <NAME> , rising too .
' The quarter ' s notice , ' said <NAME> , with the gravity of a man on the right side , ' is not yet half expired .
If ever that boy returns to this house , sir , I 'll eat my head . '
He sat himself down with a threatening swagger , and said : ' Give me a bottle of wine .
The moon is rising , and where she sits there is a little stream of cold pale light , in which her head is seen .
But the night covered it , and no one knew .
on the contrary , don ' t I see every reason why I shouldn ' t ?
Besides , <NAME> , you are such a conscientious master , and require so much , that I believe you make her afraid of you .
To these various attentions , Mr <NAME> submitted in a kind of grateful astonishment beyond the reach of language .
You had better go first with <NAME> , <NAME> .
I felt so sleepy , that I knew if I lost sight of anything for a moment , I was gone .
I have always lived quiet , and secret , <NAME> , my dear .
they pass into the great room with the painted ceiling and find him standing before the fire .
' By the heavy coach from the city , Sir. ' ' Are your places taken ? ' ' They are , sir , ' replied <NAME> .
But on he went before them , always at the same distance , and the same rate .
cried <NAME> , sinking on her knees beside it .
So , they were always looking at palatial residences in the best situations , and always very nearly taking or buying one , but never quite concluding the bargain .
In the name of -- of brimstone , why ? "
What are you melting vith now ?
She said her lady was but poorly , and kept her own room a good deal .
' I knew you would come to him , and I followed you , ' said <NAME> .
It ' s better to understand these things at once .
" Therefore , I have told him many times that he really should be more careful , both in justice to himself and in justice to others .
After our early dinner , I strolled out alone , purposing to finish off the marshes at once , and get them done with .
' He has never said a word to me about it .
His looks were starched , but his white neckerchief was not , and its long limp ends straggled over his closely-buttoned waistcoat in a very uncouth and unpicturesque fashion .
He has just passed out under the gateway .
A double 1 -- all , everything -- a cobbler ' s weapon .
' I am improving my legal knowledge , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
I am resolute and immoveable .
' I want to speak to <NAME> , if you please , ' he said .
He was father ' s partner , and father broke with him , and now he revenges himself .
How strongly will you have it ? ' He threw out the lees of his glass on the ground , so that they nearly spattered <NAME> .
' I went into the wrong shop , fust , last Thursday , ' said <NAME> .
He took his usual seat , she took hers , and he began his meal .
" He must have a profession ; he must make some choice for himself .
It was a spectre in his house , and haunted him night and day .
'Where can he have come from ! '
<NAME> <NAME> and I falling into this conversation , prolonged it and our saunter to and fro , until we diverged into general topics .
The shouts of wonder and delight with which the development of every package was received !
It is a large establishment , as you see , and requires a great number of attendants .
In that low and marshy spot , the fog filled every nook and corner with a thick dense cloud .
He said yes , but asked me for some of my " gentleman 's linen " to put on in the morning .
At length the new postilions are in their saddles , and the old are left behind .
I am very much obliged to you indeed , gentlemen , for your patronage , and also for your recommendations , gentlemen , whenever additional assistance in waiting is required .
' Why not ? ' ' To be sure ! ' said <NAME> .
" Both houses are your home , my dear , " said he , " but the older <NAME> claims priority .
says <NAME> , pointing to the heavily burning taper on his table with a great cabbage head and a long winding-sheet .
There was a form between it and her , the outline strongly developed against the light , which caused her to stop abruptly .
Outside his own domain , and unprotected , he was a very sheep for the shearers .
There must be no will but his .
The birds began to stir and chirp .
<NAME> <NAME> 's brother conducted the negotiation .
" Of course , <NAME> , " he said , " you do n't understand this Chancery business ? "
Will you go my way with me , when it is quite dark ?
For their two faces were alone with the other flowers .
She stood for some moments looking round the room .
Does that come next ? ' asked <NAME> with a look of close attention .
The brightness of the shops where holly sprigs and berries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows , made pale faces ruddy as they passed .
There is no patriot in <NAME> -- in <NAME> ?
God , how the sun poured down upon the very spot !
' Open the door. ' ' Wait one instant , ' said <NAME> .
' Thank you , no ; I don ' t want any more. ' This was in reference to another menace of attention from his recovered friend .
" What is this ? " cried <NAME> , breathless and confused .
' E ope you no fright , ' said <NAME> then , interpreting Mr Pancks in a new way with her usual fertility of resource .
Several close their eyes , and think , or try to get their straying thoughts together .
" Do you take tea , or coffee , <NAME> ? " asked <NAME> , who always presided of a morning .
" Yes , and he -- yes , it was <NAME> , " said <NAME> , altering the construction of his sentence .
" I do n't understand what you mean , " said I , wondering .
It ' s very gratifying and agreeable to me , I am sure ; but don ' t you think you could do better ?
' I have been prompt enough this time .
" Like you , <NAME> , but useless , and so <NAME> like you ! "
' But there shall not be an end of it .
But none on my accounts , ' said <NAME> .
You might suppose him to be an ogre from what he says , and I believe he has the reputation of one with some people .
The largest fidelity to a trust was the life-blood of the man .
thankee hearty , for this visit !
Also , within doors , Mr Inspector was at his studies as of yore .
<NAME> waved his hand in assent , and went his way .
' I will ascertain that myself without loss of time , ' said <NAME> .
It ' s a thing to be thankful for , indeed , that <NAME> is not here to know it. ' <NAME> thought she looked at him with particular expression .
' <NAME> , I know very well that your family is far above mine .
He carried it in a masterly manner , and , not breathed even then , stood looking down upon the river .
In this strife I have almost repulsed and crushed my better angel into a demon .
The <NAME> looked on her , henceforth , as steadfastly as she on him .
" Just so , " observes the stationer with his confirmatory cough .
<NAME> continued his protection of me , and proved a very useful friend ; since nobody dared to annoy one whom he honoured with his countenance .
" Never , little woman , " he replied .
From <NAME> I have received every acknowledgment of my social station , and every recognition of my family descent , that I could possibly expect .
Of her once more stopping , and looking back , and hurrying to <NAME> , and giving <NAME> , above all the others , her last kisses and farewells .
Say only one , upon your knees , with me , and we will talk till morning . '
And Mrs. Micawber was just the same .
" If you had been born such , would you have been here now ?
But that was nothing to this .
I can not consent to get up , in this state of uncertainty .
" Go on ! " " Good ! " said the mender of roads , with an air of mystery .
You ' re in a hurry ? ' ' Yes , I am , ' said <NAME> , looking from one to the other in great surprise .
' You are , any day , ' said <NAME> , ' -- and so ' s your mother. ' <NAME> !
' You _shall _make it , sir , ' said the grave man .
In consequence of which we have at once , <NAME> ( I should go melancholy mad without Mrs Boffin ) , <NAME> , and <NAME> .
I do n't mean to say that I know , of my own knowledge , what there is particularly dead about a door-nail .
I will inquire myself in the morning .
" 'T is only a letter of instructions , sir .
' " It was , " cried the elder lady , weeping bitterly .
Singularly low , as if instead of being so close beside him , it were at a distance .
Most people know what sort of places commercial rooms usually are .
Would you mind toasting this sausage for the <NAME> P. ? " I said I should be delighted to do it .
My affections , ' said <NAME> -- ' but , <NAME> , this is madness ! ' and departed from the room .
Let me fill your glass .
' Consequently , ' said <NAME> , ' Mr .
" Why , <NAME> , " said Mrs. Badger , " is very well and is , I assure you , a great acquisition to our society .
You know what Ma is , <NAME> , " she returned .
You will be good enough to bring me no reply .
But I should like to ! ' ' I am equally sure you would not. ' ' Not even like to ?
I heard the noise of the feet behind , and redoubled my speed .
<NAME> and often we pursued these debates until the clock pointed to midnight , and the candles were burning down .
She used to feed them , <NAME> .
Whether I was to do it or not , ma ' am , I did it .
He never converses when not professionally consulted .
' Dear me -- ah ! ' This reflection was echoed by all present , who said ' Ah ! ' first , and ' dear me , ' afterwards .
' Oh , he ' s a deal better , sir , ' said <NAME> .
<NAME> pauses to look after him and note all this , with a shadowy belief that he has seen the boy before .
There was some discomfiture in his tone as he resumed , though he tried to conceal it .
<NAME> was drafted into the service of Mrs. Strong , where I saw her every day .
The leap from that knowledge to the inference that <NAME> set herself to teach _her_ something , was easy .
To be the friend of <NAME> you must reject all circumstantial evidence , all reason , observation , and experience , and repose a blind belief in the bookcase .
He lies there , dressed in shirt and trousers , with bare feet .
I asked him what he thought <NAME> ' s state of mind was , in reference to the cause of their misfortunes ?
The determined reticence of <NAME> , however , was not to be so approached .
' You will be a friend to me , won ' t you ? ' ' I hope so .
Mr <NAME> would be now reduced to saying as he booked the case , ' Well !
I said " Not at all ! "
" Nor ever will be , " says my Lady .
Of cliffs and buildings , and a windmill , and a church , becoming more and more visible upon it .
' Finish your dinner , and walk out with me .
He faintly wipes his forehead with his handkerchief and gasps .
My mother has a little property , which takes the form of a small life annuity , upon which she lives in an independent though unassuming manner in the <NAME> .
He is , as it were suddenly , grown very old .
To this compliment <NAME> replied , that she had a relish for the amusement , and had no intention to forego its gratification .
She watched and waited months for a seamstress .
<NAME> and comfortless , boastfully and doggedly rich , there the room stared at its present occupants , unsoftened and unrelieved by the least trace of any womanly occupation .
' It ' s all in training , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
But whatever she looked at ; sun , moon , stars , or bracelet ; she looked no more at the Major .
' Is it any harm ? ' asked <NAME> , smiling .
Is it the <NAME> of <NAME> ? ' ' What an amazing flow of spirits ! ' cried <NAME> .
So much the greater must have been the solitude of her heart , and her need of some one on whom to bestow it .
" Keep your eyes upon me , dear child , and mind no other object. " " I mind nothing while I hold your hand .
It was not strong enough to impell him to sacrifice himself and spare her , but it was a strong emotion .
She doesn ' t seem so desolate .
They all think so. ' ' Well , I suppose they do , ' says <NAME> , meditating aloud .
She was up in my study , <NAME> said : which it was her pride to keep in readiness and order for me .
' <NAME> ! ' exclaimed the <NAME> , ' let go , will you ?
It is immensely received in turf-circles .
' Try a little something green , ' said <NAME> , handing him the basket .
She was its very light and life .
' You ' re a steady <NAME> , and I was not mistaken .
It was abandoned as soon as tried , and he wore his grizzled hair cut short .
<NAME> <NAME> replied in the affirmative .
<NAME> , my eldest ( twelve ) , is the boy who sent out his pocket-money , to the amount of five and threepence , to the <NAME> .
Did I see among them , the intelligence and refinement : the true , honest , patriotic heart of <NAME> ?
Did n't he owe us immense sums , all round ?
' What news have you brought me ?
' I must have a full suit of mourning , <NAME> , and a hatband , to wisit him in , afore he sets out upon his travels .
<NAME> in the parlour .
On the first crash of the eminent Mr Merdle ' s decease , many important persons had been unable to determine whether they should cut <NAME> , or comfort her .
His insolence of self-importance dilated as he saw this alteration in her .
I was three-and-twenty years of age .
You are in mourning for some near relation ? ' ' For my father , ' answered <NAME> .
He even suspected the mystery of the gloved hand , and held it all the longer in his own for that suspicion .
Did you ever buy anything of him ? ' With piercing eagerness .
<NAME> then sees the <NAME> , and looks attentively at him , and goes his way .
On approaching nearer , <NAME> discerned that the refection had the appearance of a small cottage-loaf and a pennyworth of milk .
The doctor and the debtor ran down-stairs , leaving the turnkey to return to the lock , and made for the debtor ' s room .
At all events , he hoped so , and therefore tried to believe it .
Supposing his head had been held down under water for a while .
Who would be enchanted to serve you ; who would be so true , so zealous , and so faithful every day !
Shall we drink a toast , <NAME> ? ' ' Ah ! ' said <NAME> , eyeing his little glass impatiently .
He jumped up , and the leaden eyes which twinkled behind his mountainous cheeks leered horribly upon the food as he unpacked it from the basket .
It was another world , where sin and sorrow never came ; a tranquil place of rest , where nothing evil entered .
' I refer you to my attorney , <NAME> ; <NAME> , of <NAME> ' s <NAME> , ' said he .
' Is it a kind of a spluttering somewhere ? ' said the dressmaker , with an inquiring look .
" You little coarse monster , what do you think of me now ? " " I shall not tell you. " " Because you are going to tell upstairs .
After that , love , bliss and rapture ; rapture , love and bliss .
Yes. ' ' Further , I am a gentleman of the softest and sweetest disposition , but who , if trifled with , becomes enraged .
But I do mind , ' said <NAME> , ' and so will you , <NAME> , when I enlighten you .
If you will let me go with you , <NAME> , I will go to the world ' s end without fear .
' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , very seriously .
The agony on the shore increased .
' I -- ha -- thought it was <NAME> ! ' said Mr Dorrit .
" No , " said he , with a glance of surprise : " who else should there be ?
<NAME> then that I had , and that I have -- do you understand me ?
No one was stirring in the house .
Well ! ' Hearing this mention of their old friend ' s name , the four Miss <NAME> gathered round <NAME> , open eyed and mouthed , to hear more .
Equally hard up for a remark. ' ' Somebody said something , ' returned <NAME> .
' Thank you , my dear , ' he said , as if she had spoken ; ' I am all right , my dear .
You know that you made my life unhappy by your pursuit of me .
A handsome mince-pie had been made yesterday morning ( which accounted for the mincemeat not being missed ) , and the pudding was already on the boil .
On the day of judgment .
And God knows I do ! " echoed Biddy .
' My brother. ' <NAME> resumed his former position ; and <NAME> , accompanied by a surgeon , entered the room .
' Good day , sir , ' said my aunt , ' and good-bye !
' I am not afraid , ' said <NAME> in a low voice , as he relinquished <NAME> 's hand .
On similar grounds he never beheld an inmate at any one of its windows but he touched his hat .
" I hope I may turn out so , " said I , " but I am much afraid of it , guardian . "
I have been called in , ' he replied .
' What will you take , sir ?
' Will you leave a message for him ? ' ' When do you think he ' ll be back ? ' inquired the stranger .
It was dark in the morning , when I got upon the coach at the inn door .
' <NAME> , ' he said , detaining it in his .
No , sir , ' said Mr Venus .
He started on the entrance of the stranger , and rose feebly to his feet .
She had never been so handsome , in his eyes .
We have been counting on your return these three or four days past .
' And what was it like ? ' inquires Veneering .
" I know that what is said between you and me goes no further. " I asked him if he had ever seen <NAME> 's adopted daughter , Mrs. <NAME> .
T ' other day when I touched his coat in the street , he looked round as if I was a toad .
' Yes , ' said <NAME> , ' to <NAME> .
A final word before I go .
I hope there may turn out to be no why not .
As it was , I thought as little of it as I might .
" I have come to bring you home , dear brother ! "
<NAME> , will your ladyship allow me to ask you whether you have had any strange visitors this morning ?
The <NAME> scheme or Course established by <NAME> 's great-aunt may be resolved into the following synopsis .
One day she failed to come , for the first time .
' A little humouring of <NAME> ' s points !
" But she had a large heart ! "
Sometimes the broken reply was , " Wait !
I am only your friend and distant kinsman .
The green damp hung upon the low walls ; the tracks of the snail and slug glistened in the light of the candle ; but all was still as death .
' It includes it : yes , ' said Mr Dombey .
We went our way too , which was to <NAME> 's <NAME> , as quickly as possible .
You know it is professionally arranged beforehand in all cases that are tried what facts the witnesses are to prove .
I did not come back , and they have passed unspoiled into my place .
It was the very next night .
Even when she was quite a child , she was the Agnes whom we know , ' said I .
The young lady , my good sir , " said <NAME> , mildly tapping the Stryver arm , " the young lady .
' I shouldn ' t have thought it. ' Not in the least looking at them , but looking at <NAME> .
Now , <NAME> is , in a manner , part and parcel of the place , and besides , is supposed to have made Mrs. Rouncewell 's will .
Do not give way so bitterly , dear friend , don ' t .
' " Flasher -- ten guineas to five , <NAME> kills himself. " Within what time shall we say ? ' ' A fortnight ? ' suggested <NAME> , <NAME> .
' He ' d write letters by the ream , if it was a capital offence ! ' <NAME> , without hearing her , went on .
So quiet , that when her father rose to take his leave , she looked round with a start , as if she had forgotten his being there .
Is that <NAME> knowledge of life ?
I may sell <NAME> , though I should be sorry to see the neighbourhood deprived of ' em too .
A moment afterwards , he was as fawning and as humble as ever .
The general feeling seems to be that it 's a blessing <NAME> war n't made away with first , mingled with a little natural disappointment that he was not .
' <NAME> ' t call me by that name !
If I was to be informed , I should despair of understanding , and I 'd rather not be told . "
' Yes , ' replied a couple of shrill voices .
While his eyes were on the paper , he felt that the eyes of Mr Flintwinch and of Mrs Clennam were on him .
With the <NAME> crypt he is better acquainted than any living authority ; it may even be than any dead one .
Also to standby , as much as possible .
Greatly interested in his proceedings , Mr <NAME> observed him closely .
She sank into <NAME> 's arms ; and that gentleman in his agitation , imprinted a passionate kiss upon her chaste nose .
It was indeed a well ; and the clear fresh stream was running at his feet .
Come ! ' ' No , no , ' rejoined <NAME> , falling back a few steps .
Who did it ? ' ' It is only I , <NAME> .
' Shut the door , sir ! ' said Mr Boffin .
' Not the slightest danger of that , ma ' am , ' replied <NAME> .
' _I_ persuaded her , ' he said , with an edifying air of superiority .
It made no difference in me .
' I took it for you , <NAME> , dear , ' rejoined <NAME> .
" You apprehend me very clearly , <NAME> .
In the ladies ' car , there are a great many gentlemen who have ladies with them .
" Seven years dead , " mused <NAME> .
' I never heard of such a thing .
Thus attired , the <NAME> of the <NAME> , in strict discharge of the important duties of his all-important office , planted himself in the room to receive the company .
All within-doors is very plain and simple , as it ought to be , but arranged with a view to peace and comfort .
The <NAME> is produced , but is not at all near the thing .
" Better to say nothing of the sort , <NAME> , because I do n't mean it . "
I fell asleep worn out , and when I awoke I cried afresh to think that I was back in the world with my load of trouble for others .
" Why , you are worse than I thought you , " says <NAME> , muttering reproof to his watch .
He could not sufficiently give utterance to his regret that he had not himself found a clue to this .
Could they bow down in prayer , and when all Heaven turned to hear them , bring the dark shade of sadness on one angel ' s face ?
<NAME> had done the deed , and entrapped her father .
A sour wine , moreover , or a souring , for its influence on the mood of those who drank it was to make them gloomy .
The visitors had had a minute or two to look about them , when the door opened and <NAME> came in .
You see me in the plight in which I came out of the packet within this half-hour .
" Do as much by me in return . "
We went upstairs to the first floor , still seeing no other furniture than the dirty footprints .
Mrs Pipchin herself is next handed in , and grimly takes her seat .
The morning was ushered in by a violent thunderstorm , and was very wet , but gradually improved and brightened up .
As he knew the house well , he conducted <NAME> to it by the way that showed it to the best advantage .
She has been expressing her anxiety that you should return in time .
They may -- or they may not -- have some reference to a subject which may -- or may not -- have cast its shadow on my existence . "
Will you return with me and show him that you already know it ?
He imagines that he must have seen it in some hospital or refuge , still , can not make out why it comes with any special force on his remembrance .
I should ask Mrs. Gradgrind ' s pardon for strong expressions , but that she knows very well I am not a refined character .
' It ' s a very extraordinary thing , ' she said , ' a most extraordinary thing , that they should have invited <NAME> .
On his return up-stairs , the rest of the guests soon dispersed , and he was left alone .
<NAME> ' t wait here out o ' compliment to me , ' said <NAME> , as the groom wheeled in the barrow , and prepared to shut the gate .
On our going downstairs again , Mrs. <NAME> asked me whether this troublesome business was really to take place next Wednesday .
Why , what but too many cooks should hinder you from having a dozen lawyers if the gentleman recommended them to you . "
She says , says <NAME> ' ly , " Theer ' s home ! " she says .
I see him myself , with his eye at the counting-house keyhole , which being patent is impervious .
So immensely astounded was Mr Merdle by the entrance of <NAME> with such a reference in his mouth , that <NAME> explained himself to have been quoting <NAME> .
' Many and many is the circuit this pony has gone , ' said <NAME> , flicking him skilfully on the eyelid for old acquaintance ' sake .
To hear him say all this with unimaginable energy , one might have thought him the angriest of mankind .
' No , no , <NAME> ' l , ' she returned , ' I shan ' t be that .
<NAME> will come in , but none can help .
cried <NAME> ; 'how kind of you to say so ! '
I am quite an Infidel about it , and shall never be converted .
" Oh , not so bad as me , " says Jo .
' Put the bottle by with the rest , ' said <NAME> .
Say you are sure before I go away , <NAME> ? "
It is a world of disappointment : often to the hopes we most cherish , and hopes that do our nature the greatest honour .
' " Leave the lamp , " said the baron .
His body was much bent , and his face was wrinkled and yellow .
But it was not always thus with Mr Chick .
I will only tell my aunt that we are going out for an hour , and be ready as soon as you are . '
<NAME> in the old days when the innocent perished with the guilty , a thousand to one ?
' By <NAME> ! ' replied the keeper , shaking his head so emphatically that he was obliged to frown to keep his hat on .
It can never , never , give me any feeling but pleasure to see you .
' Look here , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , mollified by these self-approving considerations .
It is true. ' He laughed again , and whistled the burden of the tune he had sung at the door .
<NAME> ? ' <NAME> stole a look at the inquirer .
'It is so pretty , ' replied <NAME> .
But he was great of soul .
I will therefore , if you please , go my way , leaving you to yours .
That ai n't like being worn out .
' It is <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
I will not say what consideration I might give to that point myself , <NAME> , if I were unfettered .
The <NAME> ' s was a mighty fine house , fronting the sea .
In these and her clean dress originated a fable that she was well to do in the world : one might say , for her station , rich .
<NAME> ' t tell me ' -- said <NAME> , shaking his head , and working with both his hands as if he were clearing away ten thousand cobwebs .
<NAME> way I turn , I am undone .
The learned gentleman ( like a few of his <NAME> brethren ) was desperately long-winded , and had a remarkable capacity of saying the same thing over and over again .
She had such an exquisite little nosegay in her hand .
Come and hear <NAME> ! ' <NAME> could I engage their attentions , when my heart was burning against these ignorant designs ?
On the very first evening after our arrival , <NAME> appeared in an exceedingly vacant and awkward condition , and with a bundle of oranges tied up in a handkerchief .
Nickleby ! ' cried <NAME> , as his friend looked back , and stared him in the face .
My worst enemies -- every man has his enemies , <NAME> , and I have mine -- never accused me of being meek .
He argued with <NAME> that the dog had been already poisoned when he changed so , and sprang at him .
<NAME> <NAME> was the first master , and superior to <NAME> .
After the first few days , <NAME> happened one morning to assist at these attentions .
That may be , in part , natural to it ; in part , the result of affliction .
The lady with whom <NAME> was placed , Mrs. Brandley by name , was a widow , with one daughter several years older than <NAME> .
The church with the slender spire , that stands on the top of the hill now , was not there then to tell me the time .
He saw it ; and though his expression did not change , she knew he saw it .
' Now , come , <NAME> ; don ' t let us quarrel : let us be reasonable and talk this over like brother and sister .
' He was crossing you and wheedling you , I saw ; and you were soft wax in his hands , I saw .
What are you thinking of , <NAME> ? ' I was thinking of all that had been said .
' I should like to see his poem , ' said <NAME> .
' All the symptoms aggerawated , ' replied <NAME> , shaking his head .
He was smoother and more polite to me than the elder ; but I saw this .
Perhaps fifty times as good .
Little <NAME> sat down in a golden chair , made quite giddy by these rapid interruptions .
To my dear boy ? ' ' Dear ! ' repeated <NAME> .
There was a melancholy wind , and the marshes were very dismal .
She was the only person who could have stood between me and the silent Tomb , and she did it , in a manner to command my everlasting admiration .
But how ? " " I am going to tell you how .
She requested them to be seated ; and declining to take a seat herself , at once anticipated any introduction of their business .
That done , she once more reminded him of their compact and gaily parted from him .
what _do_ you call this ? ' ' Rather a heavy sea on , sir , and a head-wind. ' A head-wind !
<NAME> tell me about him !
I took my leave of <NAME> , for the time , charging him with my best remembrances to all at home .
At first he remained stock still ; then hurried after her .
I am deeply obliged to you for your encouragement and patronage , but it was papa who asked for it .
We could have seen what he was about , if he had carried a light one .
the <NAME> When the <NAME> vacation approached , no indecent manifestations of joy were exhibited by the leaden-eyed young gentlemen assembled at <NAME> Blimber ' s .
' I am extremely happy to hear it .
' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , nodding his head .
As so much time has passed , and as you spoke only this morning of my being so well again , perhaps you expect me to renew the subject .
She would say , ' Take a salamander , ' as if a general should command a private to catch a <NAME> .
For some moments not a word was spoken .
' Then you won ' t have none tomorrow .
There were twenty churches close together , clamouring for people to come in .
<NAME> , notoriety , is the thing .
All this time Mr <NAME> had been standing at the door , and the small servant had been afraid to approach .
The miserable shop of the wood-sawyer was so small , that its whole surface furnished very indifferent space for this legend .
It is the manner of communicating these diseases ; it is the subtle way in which they go about .
And nothing can be more laudable .
Is it that the carpets and the cushions are too soft and noiseless , so that those who move or repose among them seem to act by stealth ?
The ministers of <NAME> are robed and ready .
And that Mr <NAME> has not treated him well ? ' ' Has treated him most shamefully , dear Pa ! ' cried <NAME> with a flashing face .
It is fair enough , perhaps , that you should pay her some , if she can help you to what you want to know .
In due sequence Mr <NAME> appeared ; on whose entrance the visitor rose from his chair , laughing loud , and folded him in a close embrace .
' Not the slightest fear , <NAME> , ' interposed the hostler .
I call them the Wards in <NAME> .
<NAME> , <NAME> ? ' ' My friend <NAME> has a strong poetic turn , ' said <NAME> .
Her lips were a little parted , as if her heart beat faster than usual .
Why , to say the truth , both have taken a little out of me to-day , my dear , but that was to be expected .
' On my way to -- where I am going. ' ' <NAME> , <NAME> , by <NAME> , ' repeated <NAME> , in her own thoughts .
asked the old lady , after a pause .
' I tell you , I wish such things were more common than they are , and more easily done .
' Ay , ' returned the schoolmaster gaily , ' for many a merry year to come , I hope .
I know I am affectionate .
I had no time for verification , no time for selection , no time for anything , for I had no time to spare .
I haven ' t always occupied my present station of life .
' What names , sir ? ' said the man at the door .
This time he does touch her with his outstretched hand .
At length , she said , in a trembling voice : ' I hope not , <NAME> .
A man stumbled against him as he turned away , who mumbled some maudlin apology .
<NAME> was the hour when <NAME> stopped at the corner , observing the girl and the strange man as they went down the street .
There was a long hard time when I kept far from me the remembrance of what I had thrown away when I was quite ignorant of its worth .
You have got a twist in that bone , to the best of my belief .
We waited half an hour , walking up and down , but there were no signs of him .
A bird of the air ?
For the streets were so full of dense brown smoke that scarcely anything was to be seen .
" It is with exquisite pleasure , guardian -- with a heart full of thanks . "
What more the letter told me needs not to be repeated here .
What a companion you were ! ' ' Companion ?
' If the dog ' s teeth have entered the leg , <NAME> -- ' began <NAME> , with a display of his own .
When the time drew near for retiring , <NAME> took a glass of water .
What a novel illustration of the tender laws of <NAME> !
It was succeeded by a moment ' s pause .
So they looked , so would he ; so she , his weeping child , who should say when !
The gentleman in the white waistcoat appeared very much amused by this explanation ; but his mirth was speedily checked by a look from <NAME> .
No portrait that I have ever seen of anyone has been half so replete with those qualities .
What I happened to find there , about their secret way of coming and going , without you -- which was strange -- led to my suspecting something wrong .
' I have heard it remarked that she was a very fine woman , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , in a sympathising manner .
' What I have come down to be , since I first saw you in this house !
He was thought to have gone , but he was hiding .
Pleasant sheds tears deserving her own name , and her sweet delusion is at its height .
exclaimed <NAME> , turning a look of excessive surprise on his companion .
I shouldn ' t like to have it known that she was so much attached to me .
' Why , my dear Sir , our friend ' s in an unpleasant position -- very much so .
" He is very weak , " said the trooper in a low voice .
It 's my old girl that advises .
Taking a pace or two over the stone floor , he came back to the table and finished what he had to say .
' You are fairly in for it , ' said the jolly host .
Sincerely , honestly , indeed , <NAME> , I never thought so , before .
cries Mrs. Bagnet , looking at him curiously .
<NAME> and excitement extend further yet , and take a wider range .
It certainly did seem that the whelp yielded to this influence .
I have proved myself , and I know better .
' I could wish , ' said Mr Toots , ' to take this opportunity , <NAME> , if I might , of entering into a word of explanation .
I can desire no more .
<NAME> boy , I done it ! " I tried to collect my thoughts , but I was stunned .
But , whether she was afraid of singing before people , or was out of voice that evening , it was certain that she couldn ' t sing at all .
The imprisoned air , the imprisoned light , the imprisoned damps , the imprisoned men , were all deteriorated by confinement .
you alone are to blame , are you , sir ? ' said <NAME> ; ' I -- I -- see through this , sir .
' I have no patience ' ( which indeed was the truth ) .
' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
Now , does he do too much ? " " I think not .
I ses 'yes ' I ses .
How else COULD he be disappointed ?
" I am not sure , my dear girl , but that it may be wise and specious to preserve that outward indifference .
I began to be really afraid of him now and looked at him with the greatest astonishment .
But in the general tumbling up of the family , his tumbling out in life somewhere , was a thing to transact itself somehow .
Give my love to your aunt , <NAME> dear , and implore her not to curse the viper that has crossed your path and blighted your existence .
We are liable to be tumbled out neck and crop at a moment 's notice .
The fulfilment of the second has not yet arrived .
Being by this time a perfect <NAME> and a complete success , she made a dash at the door which I had fortunately locked .
<NAME> is a Copious Language , and Trying to <NAME> .
The search continued for five days .
I would tell him before breakfast .
' I regarded myself as a refuge , for her , from the dangers and vicissitudes of life .
But to no purpose ; for still no trace of <NAME> revisited the light of the sun .
Now it was <NAME> , now one of my old Reading friends from whom I could not believe I had so recently parted .
To be sure , I do n't know why I should n't be wished a hundred mile away , for I have not much to do with all this ! "
I bought it of an individual that he gave it to , and that lived here after him .
' O me , O me , my lungs is weak , my lungs is bad !
For how does it stand ?
A pleasant journey to you .
Is that so ? ' ' Yes , ma ' am ; indeed it is .
The atrocity in its full extent no longer exists , but there is enough of it left to give rise to occurrences that make the heart bleed .
It must not be supposed ( or it would be a gross injustice to Mr Quilp ) that he was tortured by any disinterested anxiety on behalf of either .
I could not afford to lose him , but you will bring him safe back. ' ' Well !
There was nothing of high mark in this .
Let us walk. ' ' But you will be so tired , my love. ' ' Oh no !
But you had better ask <NAME> if you want to know. ' ' I wonder he doesn ' t call , ' said <NAME> after thinking a moment .
" My amiable child , " murmured <NAME> , adjusting his cravat .
' Aha ! ' said the fat boy .
Now send me out feet foremost ! ' "
' Do you think of soon returning to the old country ? ' says I .
' You ' re wanted inside here. ' ' Has Mr Abel forgotten anything , I wonder ? ' said <NAME> as he dismounted .
' What is the matter ? ' exclaimed <NAME> , running to support her .
The bookcase , glazed and locked , repudiated all familiarities .
' <NAME> , young woman ; you know who this is ? ' ' It ' s Mrs. <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
Of which , to do her justice , she was wholly innocent , in thought , word , or deed .
" Look here , " says <NAME> , recoiling .
And this is his wife , Mrs .
You do n't know how well ! "
The Jew was no sooner alone , than his countenance resumed its former expression of anxiety and thought .
'The reason of all this , ' replied <NAME> .
" It 's just as likely as not , " said <NAME> , " one of these days ; though there 's plenty of time for that , my dear .
He could turn cramp-bones into chessmen ; fashion Roman chariots from old court cards ; make spoked wheels out of cotton reels , and bird-cages of old wire .
' From <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> .
The glazed hat made quite a show in the sun with its glistening , and the <NAME> continued to wave it until he could be seen no longer .
You have heard the dreadful nonsense he has been guilty of this night , and the manner in which he has gone on with that poor unfortunate little old maid .
I recommend you to take yourself off , and be talked to presently , you fool !
They ran to the window , downstairs , and into the street .
She was a woman of about forty , I supposed , -- but I may have thought her younger than she was .
Do nothing for me ; that ' s all .
She hired a crossing-sweeping boy to show it her .
He was a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before .
Really I didn ' t know that I had .
Your letter is like you , and what could I say of it that would be higher praise than that ?
He had repeatedly said he would have <NAME> ' s life .
<NAME> had made good speed while <NAME> was absent , and with his help everything was soon ready for their departure .
But his desire was to the utmost to satisfy <NAME> ( whatever that was ) , and take up all its drafts upon him for tribute .
' You have done me an unmerited service .
It is , perhaps , hardly in the nature of woman to receive such attentions as the Major once lavished upon myself without betraying some sense of obligation .
And the parlour couldn ' t bear straighter either .
' We ' d have had a young gentleman to meet you , if we had known you were coming , ' retorted <NAME> , nothing abashed .
The town , which was sluggish and uninteresting enough , was something like the back of an <NAME> watering-place , out of the season .
She gives me nothing but reproaches , my <NAME> , for all I have done for her .
He was always foremost among them .
I have seen it displayed with such success , that I have encountered some fine ladies and gentlemen who might as well have been born caterpillars .
" What else can be the consequence , " said <NAME> , in explanation , " if he will cut the cheese ?
If my time had run out , it would have left me still at the height of my perplexities , I dare say .
I have no hope of its being untrue , but at least I may verify it. " <NAME> nodded .
Being a great reader of all kinds of literature ( and never at all apologetic for that weakness ) , he sat down comfortably to read .
' This is unfortunate , ' said <NAME> .
He gives me the cold shoulder on this very matter as if he had had nothing to do with it , instead of being the first to propose it .
' I have put the words close to my heart .
" My friend the law-stationer 's good lady , over there , " says <NAME> , luring Mrs. Snagsby forward with the finger .
' If the young man comes to be a teacher here , let him understand , at once , that we don ' t want any foolery about the boys .
<NAME> , in its best sense , was for me no more .
I hope he does , I am sure . "
I WILL see her when I please .
' The very house I live in , ' sighed the poor gentleman , ' may be taken from me tomorrow .
'Oh , you little un-grate-ful , mur-de-rous , hor-rid villain ! '
' I don ' t know what to make of it , ' said <NAME> .
One of two remarkable circumstances is indisputably a fact , with reference to that class of society who travel in these boats .
That was their meeting , their conversation , and their parting .
They violate equally the justice that should belong to <NAME> , and the restraints that should belong to gentlemen .
I never commit myself hastily in any affair , and from what I see of this , I by no means like the appearance of it .
He can ' t help his likings and dislikings , perhaps .
' By no means , ' said <NAME> .
" My son , " said he , " it 's two o'clock .
' I expect him every instant , sir , ' said <NAME> .
' My brother <NAME> is a fine fellow , a great fellow ! ' exclaimed brother <NAME> as he shut the door and returned to <NAME> .
' Can I do anything more , sir ? ' I thanked him and said , <NAME> ; but would he take no dinner himself ?
His legs , which , being long , were afflicted with weakness , graced a pair of Oxford- mixture trousers , made to show the full symmetry of those limbs .
" Is he changed ? " <NAME> asked her .
I had come in with an idea of distinguishing myself rather , conceiving that I was very well prepared ; but it turned out to be quite a mistake .
' Again I think I may say , that ' s not impossible .
'It is hard , ' said the good doctor , turning away as he spoke ; 'so young ; so much beloved ; but there is very little hope . '
" How do I know it , <NAME> ?
" Your servant , gentlemen ; I 've been dozing .
When they reached the passage , he laid his finger on his lip , and drawing close to the girl , said , in a whisper .
he said , laying the bundle on the table .
<NAME> <NAME> was between <NAME> and me in the pew ; but I heard her sing , and the congregation vanished .
' Ay , ay ? ' cried the <NAME> , lifting up his bushy eyebrows a little .
'She sold it , ' cried Monks , with desperate eagerness ; 'did she sell it ?
<NAME> , you old man , grey .
<NAME> bowed his acknowledgments , and was unfeignedly glad to see the cloth laid .
' Then if I row up under the <NAME> and lay there , no need to whistle .
In that event , no doubt , he would establish the <NAME> and the <NAME> , and a little annual <NAME> to <NAME> .
Then I will tell you why .
" My instructions are that this boy is to move on . "
' You hear this , girl ? ' said Mr Dombey sternly to the black-eyed .
' They must not , indeed , ' rejoined <NAME> firmly , as he prepared to leave the house .
His Uncle and he lay under a great obligation to Mr Dombey , which was of <NAME> ' s own soliciting .
She stopped before a shabby little house , as closely shut up as a house that was full of cracks and crevices could be .
' I said , ' he began , ' when I saw you last , that there was something unexplained , which might perhaps influence you .
But as yet , the neighbourhood was shy to own the <NAME> .
While it was preparing , I went to <NAME> and inquired for <NAME> ; she was still very ill , though considered something better .
<NAME> thou know thot ? ' ' Oh , ah !
Many people are singularly like each other .
I watched him when you were laying on to little Bolder this afternoon .
He wandered on again , irresolute and undecided , and oppressed with the fear of another solitary night .
' Very well , ' said Mrs. Micawber .
It was but a day gone , and <NAME> had brought the tears into my eyes ; they had soon dried , God forgive me !
<NAME> , ' said <NAME> , solemnly , ' is more easier conceived than described .
He rambled through the scenes of his old pursuits -- through many where <NAME> lost him as she listened -- sometimes for hours .
<NAME> tell me thou bean ' t , efther yon chap at schoolmeasther ' s , " says I .
Mr Toots , to whom the question seemed perplexing , suggested ' <NAME> ' em. ' But Mr <NAME> did not appear to think that would do .
I saw you looking at it yesterday .
" I do n't know , " says Jo , staring moodily at the veil , " nothink about no papers .
I know him ! " He darkly closed an eye at <NAME> 's name , and shook his head .
He spoke in a slushy voice , as if much mud had washed into his throat .
I have the honour to attend court regularly .
<NAME> is the wild idea that flutters through her mind .
" You have my free consent -- a small gift from such a mother to her injured child ! -- but do not tell me of it .
I saw it. ' ' To be sure it was in the open street , ' she observed , after a few moments of less and less angry reflection .
Even this , though , when <NAME> looked at it with increasing steadiness , was not its strangest quality .
But Mr Tite <NAME> was a buttoned-up man , and consequently a weighty one .
She was looking wonderfully well when I quitted it. ' ' Mrs Merdle , ' said Mr Merdle , ' is generally considered a very attractive woman .
' And <NAME> ' ll_ take care , ' said <NAME> internally ; and they entered the house .
The life is more than she can bear .
And to breakfast with whom but his near neighbours , the <NAME> of <NAME> , who have imparted to him that he will meet his distant kinsman , Mr Fledgely .
A woman more angry , passionate , reckless , and revengeful never lived .
It was from the lips of such a tutor , that the child learnt her easy task .
Not bad quarters , either , " says <NAME> , looking round again .
The President rang his bell ; but , The <NAME> , warming with encouragement , shrieked , " I defy that bell ! " wherein she was likewise much commended .
And in the nod and in the firm set of her mouth , there was a vigour of purpose not to be doubted .
The burden of proof lay with <NAME> ; and he produced his evidence that very day at dinner .
Not so gaily , but that the brilliant furniture seemed to stare her out of countenance as if it insisted on being compared with the dingy furniture at home .
I was not wholly indifferent , for I had a hope of being pleasant and useful to <NAME> .
I pass to worse news .
' Have you many scholars , sir ? ' she asked .
<NAME> , but almost as dismal .
' We can never be too cautious , ' said Mr Brass .
<NAME> , if you have any love for your father , you had better not join that gang .
Should the <NAME> have refused the note ?
But when <NAME> told him what was really the matter , <NAME> , after a moment ' s reflection , started up into full activity .
It was past in a moment , and I listened again , and heard the footstep stumble in coming on .
She stole away to bed as quickly as she could , and when she was alone , gave free vent to the sorrow with which her breast was overcharged .
You must go. ' ' I would rather not , ' she said to the Doctor .
' <NAME> ! ' said <NAME> , suddenly turning to him .
That was a fatal blow .
' Now , godmother , ' she went on , ' I particularly wish to ask you what has taken place here , since I left the wolf here ?
Is there any light a-comin ? "
There was not one gleam of interest , parental recognition , or relenting in it .
" My Lady is looking charmingly well , " says Mrs. Rouncewell with another curtsy .
<NAME> was delighted to hear him express the opinion .
Then , what submission , what cringing and fawning , what servility , what abject humiliation !
I think -- but I really can ' t say , sir .
' No vay at all ? ' inquired <NAME> .
" You do n't mean that , I am sure ? "
And there would be no Circuit to go .
And drew a long breath .
' Though , by-the-bye , I suppose it was one of that family that pinted me out ? ' ' No .
Of course I was in love with little Em ' ly .
" Ah , but I do n't know , " replies Jo , shaking his head fearfully , " as he DO N'T hear . "
' " You will never leave me , " murmured the young lady .
Do not fear , Mr Boffin , that I shall contaminate the premises which your gold has bought , with <NAME> lowly pursuits .
' We ' ll try and find out. ' Mrs. Squeers , being out of breath with her exertions , complied .
" You do n't mean -- " <NAME> begins .
He is much too deep for me .
She looked at me , with some fluttering wonder in her face .
' YOUR varnish is fading. ' Mrs <NAME> descended and went in .
Seeing it , he poured out and drank another glassful .
' Be careful what you say , old boy , for this is a serious matter .
I encouraged <NAME> in this idea , because I felt that it might one day be consolatory to her .
He looked back when he had got the street-door open .
' The noose , sir ? ' retorted <NAME> .
Forasmuch as they hang in my memory by only this one slender thread , I do n't know what they did , except that they forbore to remove me .
Manners fit for a crown !
Those interests are now paramount in this office .
Shall I tell you on what accusation ?
<NAME> , after hesitating an instant , complied .
We were both very much surprised , coming higher up , to find my outer door standing open ( which I had shut ) and to hear voices inside .
He undid it slowly , leering and laughing at me , before he began to turn them over , and threw it there .
Not absolutely always , for she could recall some occasions on which her power had failed ; but they were few and slight , and she believed them over .
' <NAME> , my dear , ' taking her to the open window , ' where they live !
' It is him , ' said Mr Wegg , ' and he is capable of it .
The soldiers were in front of us , extending into a pretty wide line with an interval between man and man .
Tell your other friend to get his head painted for the sign of some public-house , and to get it done by a sign-painter .
<NAME> take <NAME> and me and <NAME> to Putney ! ' So they went , very soon after the funeral .
These were not the only members of the <NAME> family who turned it to account .
Once upon a time -- of all the good days in the year , on <NAME> -- old <NAME> sat busy in his counting-house .
" <NAME> put him in the hospital , guv'ner , and the hospital put him -- in a glass-case , I HAVE heerd , " <NAME> replies mysteriously .
And she is , no doubt .
' What he has on his mind. ' ' I ought first to see for myself that he has something on his mind , I think , ' said <NAME> .
Also , when we played at cards <NAME> would look on , with a miserly relish of <NAME> 's moods , whatever they were .
To this manoeuvre he accordingly resorted .
' There ' s <NAME> , little Bolder , <NAME> , and what ' s his name. ' ' So there is , ' rejoined <NAME> .
' There was a girl called <NAME> .
They have descended a gentle slope , and enter upon a level , as compact and dry as a solid block of marble , two miles long .
I want particularly to know all about her. ' ' I ' ll take care , <NAME> , ' said the boy .
" At least there is no opposition to YOU , " <NAME> asserts with confidence .
My own two hands , and feet likewise , being very cold , however , on this particular occasion , I crept below at midnight .
But he said you and I began it , and as he had me there -- for we did -- I put our acquaintance on the old footing .
' I ' m not a going to keep you , even , above an hour , ' said <NAME> .
' <NAME> , ' said Mr Rugg , taking him by the hand , ' you are a young man that it does one good to come across .
and Mrs. M ' Choakumchild never make any mistakes themselves , I suppose , <NAME> ? ' ' O no ! ' she eagerly returned .
But she had never seen so singular a smile as that upon this lady ' s face .
There are three meals a day .
' <NAME> early , no ! ' replied <NAME> .
Will you grant me time -- any length of time ?
' Mr <NAME> , sir , we should fall to work cheerfully , and not in a despondent state .
<NAME> ' t he , pretty ? ' -- or , when he got downstairs , making another trial at that verse of <NAME> .
At that instant -- ' Little <NAME> ! ' cried the voice behind him .
She was going to leave it in a fortnight ; the child couldn ' t recommend her to another , she supposed ?
They are sought by so many , and they are granted ( comparatively ) to so few !
The girl performed her office with such expedition , that in a very few minutes the coach was ready .
I could have no other motive , <NAME> , in keeping anything from you. ' ' I know that well , ' said I .
Who ' s got to say anything agin it ?
All right behind , and full inside ? ' ' All right , old feller , ' replied the embarrassed gentleman .
' I can ' t help it , indeed , sir , ' rejoined the boy , crying .
Not that I need mention it , for it hardly seems to belong to anything .
You signified to me , when I called t ' other morning , that you were .
<NAME> , he never came , all day , between the morning and the night .
See how taut the line is ! ' ' I must have it up , ' said Mr Inspector .
The other may be taste ; but this is reason .
'There is somebody else who should not be forgotten , by the bye , ' said <NAME> , ringing the bell .
' And he can hardly believe it , either , ' said <NAME> , when he returned , ' nor nobody will .
Back again it stole to the window -- then turned its head towards her .
Come the roll of wheels and a violent ringing at the bell .
I never was so much afraid of anyone .
You are reproaching me , underhanded , with having nobody but you to look to .
If his wife was present , she would throw oil upon the waters .
Of the common folk , that is merely bundled up in turf and brambles , the less said the better .
' I have had disappointments to contend against , ' said <NAME> , looking very grim ; ' <NAME> ' s father was two pound ten short .
As she gave way for us , she went softly in and put what we had brought near the miserable bed on which the mother slept .
I wonder whether it ever crept into his mind who that unfortunate some one was ! ' ' I wonder whether I shall sleep to-night !
What need to say that ?
' Then this garden , ' resumed <NAME> .
The driver wanted no directions , but lashed his horse into full speed , without the delay of an instant .
' " Disband them ! " cried the baron , in amazement .
The Major , in a fit of curiosity , has charged the <NAME> to watch the house sometimes , and find out what becomes of <NAME> .
She ' s your master ' s wife , ' returned the old woman .
There is no other principle distinctly , certainly , and consistently maintained through all its narrow turnings .
' It is all I could do for my children -- I have done it .
<NAME> ! ' -- as to that , they might perhaps speak of it at another time , but would say no more now .
His employer would see to that , sir .
The cart had very nearly given up , but labours on a little more .
Mr <NAME> shrugged his shoulders , and <NAME> sat rigid .
'To be sure it would , my dear , ' replied the Jew .
You have had more than two guineas from me , already .
' Putting both your hands afore your face too ! ' she went on .
Live and let live , we say to them .
" Being quite a child , sir , " said I , " and so different from other people -- " " You are right ! "
" With the greatest pleasure , sir ! "
How could she be otherwise than useful and happy ! ' ' <NAME> any -- ' I was thinking aloud , rather than speaking .
' How queer they ' re standing. ' ' Hush , can ' t you ? ' replied <NAME> softly .
Will you let me give it you ?
' This matter is growing alarming , ' reasoned <NAME> with himself .
I told him that we had but just left a coach and were going -- but then I was obliged to look at my companion .
" I went home , <NAME> , <NAME> , at night and found this young woman having supper with my wife , Mrs. Bucket .
'Bless their dear little hearts ! '
<NAME> ? ' ' He shall not , through any act of mine , come back wi ' the unmerited reproach of being brought back .
' Look at <NAME> , ' whispered <NAME> to Bella when this was done , and they stood over the roasting fowls .
He threw himself upon the chair .
" No ; but before I go on , " said <NAME> , shaking his head in his bullying way , " I 'll have this out with you .
He was a hard man , and would never bate an ounce of plate or a bottle of wine .
<NAME> , downright , faithful earnestness. ' ' If you only knew the earnestness of <NAME> , aunt ! ' I cried .
His removal , to make way for other accused persons who were to be tried , rescued him from these caresses for the moment .
He therefore hastily betook himself to the top of the house , and made the best arrangement of it that his imagination and his means suggested .
Or I could make you a handy little set of drawers , to keep your silks and threads and scraps in .
Never any other name. ' ( It was she who whispered it . )
Just what you used to be , now I look at you !
I have thrown these few notes together , because the subject of them was well known to me for many years .
The dignified old gentleman turned out to be <NAME> , who had been maintained by the <NAME> Office for many years as a representative of the <NAME> abroad .
<NAME> requires that he should gain by marriage .
Oh , we may give him joy !
No muffling up in furs and broadcloth kept it out .
The large <NAME> was our great attraction because she had come into the downs in the night .
" Say what you have got to say ! "
Good-bye ! ' The last words were spoken aloud , as the vigilant <NAME> stopped , turned his head , and looked at them from the bottom of the staircase .
It is <NAME> ' s birthday ; and , on our road , <NAME> discourses to me of the good fortune he has enjoyed .
Personally ! ' repeated <NAME> , in an impatient manner .
Being in for a penny , I am ready , as the saying is , to be in for a pound .
Which is he ? " This is he ; this helpless , inarticulately murmuring , wandering old man pointed out .
Tarrying here , only that day and night , to recruit after our late fatigues , we started off once more upon our last journey in <NAME> .
' I ca n't help it , ' said <NAME> , ' I ca n't help it !
The lounger had lounged out of view , and <NAME> and <NAME> were gone .
" After what you let out the other day , <NAME> may as well not know of it .
<NAME> will surely not deny to <NAME> what it concedes to the butterflies ! "
<NAME> suggests the law list .
" Let it go to the four winds for to-night .
A calculated , cast up , balanced , and proved house .
' Perhaps , my dear , <NAME> would like to drink our healths , ' said <NAME> , fumbling in her reticule for some small coin .
' I am still more sorry to hear that , ' said <NAME> , gently .
But enough of him , and of all the rest of them .
' Is it bright enough now ? ' said <NAME> .
' <NAME> ! ' said the old man fondling with her hair .
' I persuaded him to take a walk this morning .
<NAME> was dispatched to the different ale-houses in the village , furnished with the best description <NAME> could give of the appearance and dress of the strangers .
' Who then ? ' ' Can you not guess who then ? ' ' I do not choose to guess , ' she answered .
growled Coavinses with an appearance of strong resentment .
<NAME> is what that Somebody must look for , to sustain him and improve him , <NAME> .
Neither of us would do .
'Call a coach , somebody , pray .
' I am astonished to hear this news , ' said <NAME> .
But at night it had come on to rain in torrents , and all night long it had rained without cessation .
He is down upon the pavement ; and the crowd eagerly gather round him : each new comer , jostling and struggling with the others to catch a glimpse .
The doctor appeared much of the same opinion himself .
exclaimed <NAME> , " I am happy to meet <NAME> and to have the opportunity of tendering my personal regrets .
But there is no one there. " " What is the meaning of One Hundred and <NAME> , <NAME> ? " asked <NAME> .
" Never mind what you read just now , sir ; I do n't ask you what you read just now .
He is the most intolerable scoundrel on the face of the earth .
<NAME> enough to have his own happy home and his own household gods -- and household goddess , too , perhaps ? "
His head was sunk upon his bosom , and perpetual snoring , with a partial choke occasionally , were the only audible indications of the great man ' s presence .
But for no money ! -- Bosh ! ' What does <NAME> say ?
I hope so ; I am not disappointed. ' ' You know how I am loved at home , and how I love home .
It will warm your heart .
He has a motive , and of course his motive is a dark motive .
I could get nobody till five minutes ago ; and I 've run here all the way . '
If it had been in my constitution to be a lighter grubber , I might ha ' got into lighter trouble .
I 'm more cumfbler nor you ca n't think .
You needn ' t break with him altogether , but leave him .
I had heard them , alone at the bedside , striking their boots with their riding-whips , and loitering up and down .
says the good old man .
' I mean , Mr <NAME> , that you must be sharper with the people , sharper with the people , much sharper with the people , sir .
None of your plots against me ; I ' ll counterplot you !
My own mother sees it , and her fondness and fears for you , point to the course that I should take .
So it is , but it ' s very clean .
said the Jew , turning away with a disappointed countenance from a close perusal of the boy 's face .
<NAME> laughed ; and making some reply which did not reach her , seemed , by the creaking of the boards , to lead his companion to the second story .
' No , sir , ' said the other , flushed and fierce .
I should think there never can have been a man who enjoyed his profession more than <NAME> did .
And makes an imploring moan .
When WILL it come to me ! ' ' I am very happy as I am , grandfather , ' said the child .
This shall be made known .
I thank you with all my heart .
<NAME> nose , but no balustrades .
They knew that , and their machinations were conducted in secret ; consequently , <NAME> and I were brought into frequent and unfortunate collision .
We will begin a new life over theer ! ' I asked him if he yet proposed to himself any time for going away .
" It will take a little time .
<NAME> <NAME> nodded to us , who were only waiting for the signal .
But another and different kind of disquietude kept them waking too .
" Yes , " said he , nodding in the direction .
' Not to make amends ? ' insinuated Mr Boffin .
<NAME> , who had been publicly entreated to appear , and for intelligence of whom a reward had been publicly offered !
Well , but what has this to do with this good lass , says you ?
Every eye then turned to the five judges and the public prosecutor .
' Well , child , ' said my aunt , when I went downstairs .
In all other respects you are comfortably bestowed .
' Here -- sit down , and I ' ll teach you how to play. ' ' Oh !
So long , so bare , so blank .
She remained alone in a dull country house : seeing little or no company but riotous , drunken sportsmen .
By this time , I quite gave <NAME> up for lost ; and settled in my own mind that there was no hope for him .
' Gentlemen , ' said <NAME> , ' you are welcome .
A strange thrill struck him when she did so , and visibly passed over his frame ; he laid the knife down softly , as he sat staring at her .
' Let me have no drunken fooling here .
' You had a sister of your own , you told me once , who died before you fell into misfortune .
" The number , sir , " said <NAME> parenthetically , " I believe I have already mentioned .
and would count up to twelve , and say , 'Hush ! '
' No , I won ' t , ' replied <NAME> , composing himself in his arm-chair again , like the master of the house .
The city had entirely vanished .
<NAME> <NAME> is in town , and attends daily , from one till four , at the <NAME> ' s Head , <NAME> .
I think that 's all I can give you to know him by .
The figure was now within the chamber , and she , still dumb -- quite dumb , and almost senseless -- stood looking on .
' I _did not_ , ' replied <NAME> , rising too ; 'but within the last fortnight I have learnt it all .
There , he laid her down on a couch , where her child and <NAME> wept over her .
I was told I was an orphan .
I forgot myself. ' Mr Venus knowingly cocked his shock of hair , as rather thinking Mr <NAME> had remembered himself , in respect of appearing without any disguise .
This knapsack is new , and he bought it in the <NAME> yesterday .
Its deplorable peculiarity was , that it was the faintness of solitude and disuse .
We were all to meet in the old boathouse that night .
He started by and by as if he were just then awakened , and asked who that was , and what was the matter ?
When <NAME> had laughed a little while , his eyes again encountered the cocked hat ; and he became grave .
Nothing of the kind here , sir .
He couldn ' t make anything of it though , so he got into bed , covered himself up warm , and fell asleep .
Perhaps I am , ' sighed the first-floor lodger .
' You are quite right , ' said <NAME> aloud , with affected composure .
' Well , I shouldn ' t wonder if it was , ' returned the old man doubtfully .
<NAME> started back , for he knew him well ; many a time he had watched him digging graves in the churchyard .
The condemned felon has as good a yard for air and exercise in <NAME> , as the insolvent debtor in the <NAME> .
They were black , cold rooms ; and seemed to be in mourning , like the inmates of the house .
" He does it with the best intention , " observed <NAME> , " but it has n't the effect he means , poor fellow ! "
I then descried <NAME> and Mrs. Hubble ; the last-named in a decent speechless paroxysm in a corner .
" Dear me ! " said <NAME> , <NAME> .
" Play the game out. " Saving for the one weird smile at first , I should have felt almost sure that <NAME> 's face could not smile .
<NAME> to her , as congenial melody , " Evening Bells " .
Having done so with tenderness , the <NAME> turned to again , countering with his left , and putting in his right , in a tremendous manner .
Difficulties had arisen in the construction of this machine , simple as it was ; requisites had been found wanting , and messages had had to go and return .
'Well , they were separated , ' said <NAME> , 'and what of that ? '
Possessing in yourself , <NAME> , all that is calculated to charm the eye -- " " Oh !
I entreat , I order you ! ' ' <NAME> , aunt ! ' said I .
They are rare , but not at an end. ' ' Mr Clennam ?
you ' ll think very differently in another five minutes , ' said <NAME> .
' What ' s the office ? ' replied that gentleman from his couch .
Leaving home very early in the morning , I got to <NAME> by stage-coach in such good time that I got to <NAME> with the day before me .
" He went out before I went off .
The very barristers ' wigs are ill-powdered , and their curls lack crispness .
What I am , my father was ; and my sister is ; and my brother is .
She goes down without answering or looking behind her .
The weak husband and the father -- the father that is yet to be -- relents .
" Thank you ; like you , like you , " said <NAME> .
When the family have retired to rest , we shall come out of the kitchen , and the young lady out of her bedroom .
But ! -- no person can tell me nothing of him , <NAME> .
" If you please , miss , " said the little girl in a soft voice , " I am <NAME> . "
It was late -- past eleven o ' clock .
It WAS one ! ' This repetition with extraordinary vehemence , and the snarl of a wolf .
He scarcely speaks again , until he takes leave of her , at the gate of the <NAME> ' House .
I shall but win back my own , and it ' s all for thee , my darling. ' ' God help us ! ' cried the child .
You can put them to some other poor boy 's use. " I took out my purse .
' What do you say ? ' A watchful pause .
But the forge was a very short distance off , and I went towards it under the sweet green limes , listening for the clink of <NAME> 's hammer .
There have been years for me as well as you , and there has been wretchedness for me as well as you .
Two distinct knocks , sir , will produce the slavey at any time .
<NAME> gate did you come to ? " I told him .
Those that want to be safe , must hoist flags .
I told her that I was going to be married to my guardian and that we had been engaged some time .
'Oliver , ' cried <NAME> , beckoning to him .
You ought to know it 's enough to drive a person wild to hear you .
' I ' ll dance with the widow , ' said the stranger .
No one could , if I did not .
' Now , my dear Dora , you must know that I never said that ! ' ' You said , I wasn ' t comfortable ! ' cried <NAME> .
Upon my honour , you have no conception what my feelings are .
what ' s the matter ? ' said Mrs. Cluppins .
We said yes , as she seemed to expect us to say so .
But not being umble yourself , you don ' t judge well , perhaps , for them that are .
Do you really feel sure that you can answer for him so confidently ? ' The perplexed and perplexing look vanished .
I hope it may be taken into account one day , when all days are at an end for me !
'Why did I eat spring lamb at eighteen pence a pound , my honest friend ? '
<NAME> <NAME> paused too , and insensibly released his hold of the carving-knife , which remained inserted in the beef .
" The bank , the factory , or the house ? "
They may hunt the whole country-side , while the raindrops are pattering round their inactivity .
He took himself to <NAME> , but not to P. J. T. and <NAME> .
The little that remains to their historian to relate , is told in few and simple words .
" Are he and the pretty girl engaged , Mr .
I have not an idea how much .
I must be particularly careful , if it were only for his satisfaction , to take myself well to task and have a regular wind-up of this business now . "
It is likely to be noticed .
' We are quite safe now , and have nothing to fear indeed , dear grandfather , ' she said .
' Do not , if you please , put suppositions betwixt my lips where none such have been imparted by myself .
If _that_ was beginning it -- " said <NAME> .
I believe duelling is one of his <NAME> ' s most undoubted prerogatives , <NAME> ? ' ' Expressly stipulated in <NAME> , sir , ' said <NAME> .
I turned my head aside , and it was gone .
Others again , opening the white-hot furnace-doors , cast fuel on the flames , which came rushing and roaring forth to meet it , and licked it up like oil .
" Sha n't I give you a piece of anything at all , miss ? "
and is laid hands on -- and there 's nothin ' !
There ' s no hurry -- shall we say this afternoon ? ' ' <NAME> Friday morning , ' returned the old man .
I felt as if the room had chilled me .
' We came , ' repeated Mrs. Micawber , ' and saw the <NAME> .
' And was he not called <NAME> ? ' ' No ! ' said Mr Baptist .
I can recommend it for your purpose , sir , because it really is extra super .
We apply ourselves to find out , Mr Lightwood , and we find that your friend , this Mr <NAME> , here , pays .
People understood that <NAME> 's , in a stately way , tolerated the odd-job-man .
What did we think she , <NAME> , might have been if she had been caressed and cared for in her childhood , like her young mistress ?
The population is migratory , usually disappearing on the verge of quarter-day , and generally by night .
Nothing in the whole adventure , not even the upset , had disturbed the calm and equable current of <NAME> ' s temper .
Where can I possibly move to , sir , more nor I do move ! "
" But when I fell into the mistake I have so long remained in , at least you led me on ? " said I .
" I do n't suspect anything more than I know , <NAME> , " returns the other gravely .
' But not you , governor , not you , ' he went on , stolidly shaking his head .
My father was <NAME> -- <NAME> de <NAME> .
It was in the state of my own feelings , I added bashfully : to clench the explanation .
You can hardly make the best of me if I do n't .
' What ' s this ! ' said <NAME> , in a whisper .
' I knew it could never be , I felt too sure of that , before I asked !
' They include , I presume , correspondence ? ' ' <NAME> , ' interposed <NAME> .
Whenever that undecided <NAME> had to ask a question or state a doubt , the public helped him out with it .
I should have no power of keeping you against his wish , and he would have no difficulty , at any time , in finding <NAME> of <NAME> .
Would he like his debts paid and his house furnished , and a few bank notes for shaving paper if he shaves at all ?
I told <NAME> when he first come home to stand up against you .
' Here am I , ' said <NAME> , pursuing his argument with the weekly tenant .
Walk me , walk me ! " I made out from this , that the work I had to do , was to walk <NAME> round and round the room .
And now I am going seriously to tell you -- let me see how many -- four secrets .
Some persons might object to the papers being signed occasionally with rather fine names , but this is an <NAME> fashion .
You will be visited , and can ask then .
He wore very short trousers , and black cotton stockings , which , like the rest of his apparel , were particularly rusty .
no ! ' cried <NAME> , clasping her hands together .
But at an expense of threepence I soon refreshed myself completely ; and , being in better spirits then , limped seven miles upon my road .
She merely bowed ; and bending over some plants that stood near , waited in silence for him to proceed .
I believe there never was anybody with such an imperturbable countenance when she chose .
If there is a man chock full of science in the world , it ' s old <NAME> .
<NAME> , potatoes , poultry , prunes , and prism are all very good words for the lips : especially prunes and prism .
She said , after a pause , in no place long .
Though why this should concern you so much , I do n't know . "
It makes me cold to remember them .
<NAME> , <NAME> ? ' ' I called , sir , before going down , as an act of attention. ' ' Of attention ! ' said <NAME> .
' You ' re to walk upstairs then , please , ' said the man .
" Pray tell us the story , " says <NAME> in a half whisper .
" <NAME> , only daughter of <NAME> , the good physician who sits there. " This answer had a happy effect upon the audience .
Mrs. Crummles trod the pavement as if she were going to immediate execution with an animating consciousness of innocence , and that heroic fortitude which virtue alone inspires .
" Let us see him here and have done with it .
Turning round to look about them when they had got thus far , they saw , among some ruined buildings at a distance , one single solitary light .
A bare lopsided weatherbeaten pole was planted in the ashes there , and had been there many a year .
Am I in love again ?
' How sauce ? ' ' I can cut my bread so -- like a melon .

At sight of their perjured relative , <NAME> turned faint and pale , and <NAME> rose majestically .
He turned white , as she held her hand up like an enchantress , at whose invocation the sound had come .
His confidential agent eyed it keenly .
We never could associate , never could communicate , never probably from that time forth could interchange another word on earth .
If I showed any trace of what I felt , my own sorrows were sufficient to account for it .
You have nothing to reproach yourself with .
' Now , sir , ' said <NAME> , ' all is safe and quiet .
He did n't make a very desperate resistance , miss !
With those words , the Jew , stooping down , placed the candle on an upper flight of stairs , exactly opposite to the room door .
He was mooning about , I suppose , taking liberties with people ' s chins ; but there he was , somehow .
Not a great fortune , forty and odd pounds for the inheritor of a hundred and odd thousand !
' Wery good , wery good , ' said <NAME> .
I hated that man with all a madman ' s hate .
' Not inside -- I ' ll be damned if you ' re going inside , ' said the strange man .
On deck , I took leave of poor Mrs. Micawber .
' Not the lad I speak on , ' said the <NAME> .
' Not even going ; gone. ' ' Has he turned girl or baby ? ' muttered <NAME> , with a fretful gesture .
As soon as he had apologized for the remissness of his memory , he asked me if he should send <NAME> for <NAME> ?
' I expect a letter from the solicitor respecting that mortgage of <NAME> ' s .
' There are many vessels leaving the port , I suppose , ' replied <NAME> .
HE was NOT an engraver. ' ( Here Mr <NAME> said , with no reason whatever , Of course not . )
" I hear you , sir , in the dark , but I 'm a-gropin -- a-gropin -- let me catch hold of your hand . "
' You are monstrous polite , ma ' am , ' said <NAME> .
Does he think to reduce me by long absence ?
And in this nation , there are fifty millions of money .
The fruits of the earth have their growth in corruption .
Why indeed , Mrs. Bagnet expresses with the umbrella .
' And I never was so glad to see it. ' ' Tell your master to make his box-seat wider , then , ' returned the passenger .
He put them , one by one , in the breast of his inner coat , counted out the money for them , and deliberately left the shop .
From this soft mood she was soon aroused , with a very wholesome and refreshing effect , by the voice of Mrs Pipchin outside the door .
' Run for <NAME> , ' cried <NAME> , menacing the page with both fists .
A movement of timid curiosity impelled her , when she approached the spot , to glance towards the fire .
Alone again , in his own room , Mr <NAME> applied himself to work , and worked all day .
He must have some object .
<NAME> for furniture of offices , so much .
<NAME> , brother Ned ? ' ' For nothing at all , ' said brother Ned .
' And somebody ' s beating a carpet , I think ? ' ' Mr Fledgeby ' s carpet , I dare say , ' replied the smiling lady .
That was his nephew , ' I replied ; ' whom he adopted , though , as a son .
' That ' s not an answer , sir , ' said <NAME> , ' to my remark .
" Bring your chair here , and speak on. " He complied as to the chair , but appeared to find the speaking on less easy .
" They 'd say , " returned my sister , curtly , " pretty well .
I saw him to-night , about eight -- helped him to shut up his shop -- and he had got the letters then in his hairy cap .
<NAME> , and taking pains , too , for I know what such pains are .
<NAME> <NAME> gently shook his head to impose silence on his friend , and resumed : 'Do you know where this poor boy is now ? '
' <NAME> and quiet as the <NAME> .
I can ' t find it ! ' All this time sobbing , and searching in the little reticule .
How easy my path , how much easier than his !
I came here to take leave of it before its change .
You saw my family with me , perhaps ?
Will you not let me come near you ? ' ' How can you ask me ?
<NAME> is steeped in money to the throat , and talks and thinks of nothing else .
Perhaps your friend in the city does .
He is much to me. ' ' What can he be to you ? ' ' He can be a rival to me among other things , ' said <NAME> .
Mrs. Micawber shrieked , and folded <NAME> in her embrace .
We must fight our way onward .
He opened his eyes after a few seconds , and looked anxiously round .
I trust I disturb no one ; but there _was_ a paper-knifeâ€”O , thank you , I am sure ! ' and disappears with her prize .
' Night after night comes and goes , and I have no rest .
I showed him , <NAME> , at his window , to <NAME> , who was often the spy in the day .
O poor thing , poor thing ! ' These words through her fast-dropping tears .
Or do you kiss my hand in the same spirit in which I once let you kiss my cheek ? " " What spirit was that ? " said I .
' For this reason , ' resumed <NAME> , ' I address myself to you , ma ' am .
He held her clasped in his left arm , and between whiles her low voice was heard tenderly imploring him to go away with her .
' Old lady , ' returned Mr Boffin , ' you keep still .
' Bitter poor , my deary , ' replied the old woman .
I couldn ' t do it ! ' ' Why not ? ' returned the <NAME> , gazing at him in astonishment .
Leaving them together , I went home to <NAME> ' s ; more melancholy myself , if possible , than I had been yet .
<NAME> , old boy , " kissing him , " one for yourself , three for the children .
She was a devoted creature .
' You look very well , <NAME> , ' I said , thinking he would like to know it .
In fact , <NAME> ' s establishment was a great hot-house , in which there was a forcing apparatus incessantly at work .
On one of the fore-most chairs , stands The <NAME> , looking about for her friend .
The <NAME> church is represented , in this remote place , as in most other parts of <NAME> , by a gentleman of great worth and excellence .
He got down , and looked eagerly inside for the beautiful young lady .
she said in a whisper .
' Yes ; I ' m going , <NAME> , if you please , ' said <NAME> .
They joked freely with one another , but seldom with him .
" It is <NAME> , " said madame .
" Pretty witness , " he muttered , looking down into his glass .
Half-a-dozen have gone by within as many minutes .
In some few months less than another year , you know , I shall carry <NAME> off from school as Mrs. Edwin Drood .
' What course for me then ?
He is a stoutly built , steady-looking , sharp-eyed man in black , of about the middle-age .
" That 's the thing , sir , " repeated <NAME> with the greatest enthusiasm .
How ' s that ? ' ' I don ' t want to deceive you .
Under existing circumstances , there is no place like a great city when you are once in it .
' There is nothing else in all the world , ' she said , ' that would have wrung denial from me .
<NAME> smiled , as he said to <NAME> , ' You see , my experience of these things does not begin with myself .
The cell-door has been closed too long on all its hopes and cares .
What of it ? ' ' When do you think he ever told her that before ?
Thus <NAME> in the morning , and it buried <NAME> still many fathoms deeper than he had been buried in the night .
' I would far rather not see Mr Clennam. ' ' Oh , fie , fie , my dear , that ' s folly .
My Lady , as on that day , sits before the fire with her screen in her hand .
' You needn ' t , if you don ' t like , ma ' am , ' was his answer .
And yet as I sit at work , I smell miles of flowers .
' I could not have done it , but for the fortune in the waterproof belt round my body .
I 'll point her out at the proper time , ' said <NAME> .
" Why do you write in the public streets ?
" I knew this person by sight very well , " says he .
And there really was a churchyard outside under some cloisters , for I saw the gravestones from the staircase window .
Every benevolent inhabitant of this retreat had his name inscribed upon his stomach .
' Hurrah ! ' echoed <NAME> , taking off his hat and dashing it on the floor , and insanely casting his spectacles into the middle of the kitchen .
' Come , boy , come -- ' and so submitted to be led away .
I am confident he wants strength of purpose .
I begin to think he ' ll never wake , ' observed <NAME> .
' I suppose he will be back soon , ' he replied ; ' he has cut out and left me expecting him back , in an odd way .
asked <NAME> with his hand to his ear .
They walked all day , and slept that night at a small cottage where beds were let to travellers .
If he could see the least sparkle of relief in her face now ?
On one side of the house was a little stable , just the size for the pony , with a little room over it , just the size for <NAME> .
He spoke <NAME> perfectly well , though he had not begun to learn the language , he told me , until he was a young man grown .
The demoniacal passion of this Neville Landless , his strength in his fury , and his savage rage for the destruction of its object , appal me .
The heavy pillars which support the roof engender masses of black shade , but between them there are lanes of light .
He started , made a short run , and stopped and looked over his shoulder .
To <NAME> , a hop-grower. ' I am terribly dejected for about a week or two .
<NAME> pretended for a little while to be busily looking among the papers .
Now I am going to tell you all I can about them , because I know that is what you most want to hear .
To them I wish to add the money as she come away with .
' We have a good many of them ; that boy ' s one. ' ' Him in the next box ? ' said <NAME> .
' Hush ! ' he said , in a low voice .
I hope everybody here will lead them to believe that I died defying them , consistently and perseveringly , as I did through so many years . "
" How many did they say ? " " I do not understand you. " " -- At the last post .
" That is quite right , " said the lady , " <NAME> . "
Every one of 'em 's doing of it , from the time when I do n't get up , to the time when I do n't go to bed .
' Well , what is it ? ' ' <NAME> and <NAME> have taken Mrs. Bardell in execution for her costs , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
I should be dead in a week .
The <NAME> gazed upon him mildly .
He married his second wife privately , because he was proud , and in course of time she died .
I am aware , sir , that it would not become me to carry on my little traffic under the windows of your mansion .
I can not resist your prayer .
<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> got into the bin ; <NAME> ascended to his perch , and deposited his feet on a floor-clothed shelf , erected beneath it for that purpose .
' The quick eye of affection is not easily blinded , when of the female sex .
I shook my fists at <NAME> , who was as frantic as myself .
Do you guess that I have come to remind you of a promise ? '
What will he like him to be called ?
If it had n't been for the girl , I might have died . '
The world , however , was not in fault in <NAME> ' s case .
<NAME> <NAME> had sent for me , to see if she could take a fancy to me .
Now , boys , ' said Mrs. Squeers , mimicking , as nearly as she could , the voice and manner of the usher .
They 're early with the kitchen fire , and that denotes good servants .
Scarcely that , for it was a look of astonished and keen inquiry .
' Not they , sir , ' replied <NAME> , touching his hat .
' Now there , ' said Mr Meagles softly , as he gave a turn to the dumb-waiter on his right hand to twirl the sugar towards himself .
" I am not at all surprised to hear it . "
Quite wondering at this discovery , <NAME> gave a single knock .
If they HAD called themselves rich , most likely they wouldn ' t have been so. ' ' They lived and died very miserably .
It ' s my leg , it ' s my leg .
That , here he had a plan of action to recommend , with a conditional clause .
The place was intolerably dirty , and the smell of tobacco smoke perfectly suffocating .
I must settle this before I sleep .
He raised his voice and called ' Eugene !
It was a song that imitated the measure of beating upon iron , and was a mere lyrical excuse for the introduction of <NAME> 's respected name .
The door-keeper will pass the note to <NAME> , and do you make any gesture that will attract <NAME> 's attention , and show him where you stand .
I felt that , at the time. ' He drew his friend closer to him .
We traversed but one side of the square , however , and at the end of it she stopped , and put her candle down and opened a door .
' It was all right. ' Again I answered , ' Oh ! ' ' You know who was willin ' , ' said my friend .
Where do you think of going , <NAME> ? ' ' I shall go back to the factory , ' said <NAME> .
Not unless he gets out , I wo n't ! "
'Nor heard anything about him ? '
" Half after nine , sir , " repeats <NAME> .
<NAME> , of my present , before I touch upon my future .
He is my uncle , but he is a villain , and has done me wrong. ' ' Has he though ? ' asked <NAME> , bending eagerly forward .
The young gentleman uttered this exultant sound with mysterious significance .
Who told him not to come ?
<NAME> <NAME> begged her to take his arm ; and as they moved on very slowly , asked her how the robbery had been committed .
What could I do t ' hinder her ?
Have you seen that ? ' ' Ah !
But she is proud , is she not ? "
" But would you allow me the favour of a minute 's private conversation ? "
He 'd set upon a post at a street corner eight or ten hours at a stretch if he undertook to do it . "
I have no time to waste . "
I think it came on " for further directions " -- about some bill of costs , to the best of my understanding , which was confused enough .
She was very fond of me -- made me this waistcoat , Tom. " ' " Did she ? " said <NAME> .
No trees were to be seen , nor any vegetable growth save a poor brown scrubby moss , freezing in the chinks of rock .
" And then I said <NAME> was thinning fast ; and so it was , my dear . "
We made no more provision for growing older , than we did for growing younger .
Let ' s get the scaffolding up , then , for a pair of whiskers .
It is much better as it is ! ' Agnes is downstairs , when I go into the parlour ; and I give her the message .
What does he do that for ?
The look and the action had occupied but an instant .
'And us come to bring him all these beau-ti-ful things . '
Cries in exaltation of the well-known good physician rent the hall .
Here the friends , for a short time , separated .
It was not that he was embarrassed , as on that first night with the <NAME> family ; he was habitually unembarrassed now , and yet the something remained .
Sit down on this chair , close beside me !
Oh , no , I do n't think so !
'That 's just what it was ! '
' It ' s light enough for me , ' said Mr Merdle .
Why is it ? ' said <NAME> , ' Won ' t you tell me ? ' For <NAME> was shaking her head .
So we were left to take leave of one another without any restraint .
' My mother lives in a most primitive manner down in that dreary red-brick dungeon at <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
' That is the principal , I may say the only difficulty , my dear <NAME> , ' assented his wife .
I have had some slight correspondence with your former friend , sir , ' addressing me , ' but it has not restored his sense of duty or natural obligation .
If you have a suspicion in your own breast , keep that suspicion in your own breast .
He had undergone the ordinary transitions from the height of conviviality to the depth of misery , and from the depth of misery to the height of conviviality .
Your good opinion is a consolation to me .
The thunder was rolling into distance , and the rain was pouring down like a deluge , when the door of his room opened .
He has a great liking for Mrs. Rouncewell ; he says she is a most respectable , creditable woman .
She remonstrates , laughing , and is a childish schoolgirl again .
I am ashamed to have brought Mr Headstone with me .
<NAME> see to it yourself .
You can say I am coming . '
' If you only knew how I have loved that man -- ' <NAME> ' t distress yourself by recollecting it , ma ' am , ' said the bodyguard .
<NAME> <NAME> picked up his hat , and having turned it over with a look of interest and welcome , began to polish it on his sleeve .
' <NAME> , ' he said , ' I know , and knew before to-day , that I have found no favour with you ; and I knew why .
' I have been lingering here these two hours .
<NAME> <NAME> was fast asleep in bed , when his early visitor , followed by <NAME> , entered the room .
Such a thought never came into my head !
His visitor observed the look , and proceeded .
There were few buildings then , north of the Oxford-road , and forest-trees flourished , and wild flowers grew , and the hawthorn blossomed , in the now vanished fields .
Can be and shall be , on your own terms , ' returned my aunt , ' if you say the word .
The world did put it about , that she admired my style .
My lot has been so blest that I can relate little of myself which is not a story of goodness and generosity in others .
' My dear <NAME> , ' said Mr Morfin , after a silence , ' I was not prepared for this .
We proceeded by appointment straight to <NAME> ' s house ; where , and at <NAME> ' s , my friend had been labouring ever since our explosive meeting .
Oh , the strong eyes , and the weak frame !
' <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> ! ' ' <NAME> , him , him ? ' repeated <NAME> ; staring about , as if for Him .
<NAME> taught him even that much ; he found it out .
That ' s the worst of you .
and not my <NAME> gentleman ?
' He has feigned it often enough to me , of late , ' said <NAME> .
' You saucy baggage ! ' retorted <NAME> , rattling at the handle of the door .
<NAME> man of the name of <NAME> !
He had a tree on his right , a tree on his left , a third before him , and a fourth behind .
Through the ragged window-curtain , the light of early day steals in from a miserable court .
You 'd better bring the boy here to-morrow night .
I always knew the real worth of such characters as yours !
Call it at the outside a week .
' Very well , my dear Sir , very well , ' said <NAME> .
' I says , at first , " This is illusion " ; and was composing myself off to sleep , when I heerd the noise again , distinct . '
I ' d ha ' licked a doozen such as him when I was yoong as thee .
A bitter sleet came rattling against us here on the east wind , and <NAME> took me on his back .
But , ' she said , looking hastily round , 'this fear comes over me again .
" 'Gentlemen , ' I returned , ' I am that Doctor Manette of whom you speak so graciously . '
" I wish to hear it at the window , then .
But you never have condescended to me , as much as I could have wished .
Then will you set about it at once , blacksmith ? " said the off-hand sergeant , " as it 's on his <NAME> 's service .
It may be that I shall yet stand your friend , if you deserve it , and repent in action -- not in words .
She has found it necessary to make a journey -- I trust will shortly return .
It is not in tameness of spirit that I submit .
' <NAME> , We say , ' returned Mr Podsnap , in a condescending manner .
' A good , contented , well-breakfasted juryman is a capital thing to get hold of .
Where does that responsibility rest ?
I must put something under the cushion for your head .
He had another reason for this .
If you do , well and good .
But , there was nothing there .
Girded round its middle was an antique scabbard ; but no sword was in it , and the ancient sheath was eaten up with rust .
They listen , and hear his footsteps go back to the gate , and hear the gate close after him .
They were a goodly company , and the <NAME> all but worshipped them .
Firstly ( in a spirit of love ) , what is the common sort of <NAME> -- the working clothes -- the every-day wear , my young friends ?
The night should have turned more wet since I came in , for he had a large sou ' wester hat on , slouched over his face .
Why , good gracious me , suppose the house was to be let !
He is on his last march , miss , and has a whim to see her .
" But it 's not my business ! " he would generally say at those times , and would briskly fall to his sawing again .
Would n't her child ? " " Yes , yes , thank God .
" And you 're doing well , Mr .
The officer turned suddenly from the path , and after climbing a paling , and scaling a hedge , entered a secluded field .
There -- see how this iron bar bends beneath my furious wrench .
' I must move rapidly , or I could not draw my breath .
There was the usual aspect of newness on every object , of course .
But <NAME> was not there to look on ; and <NAME> remained unrecognised , and sat staring at her fire , unobserved .
Not a single word did <NAME> speak .
What could I become with these surroundings ?
' Kit , they call him. ' ' Kit , eh ! ' said <NAME> .
<NAME> ' t take on , ma ' am , and be sorry ! ' It became intolerable .
' I will not go in just yet , ' said <NAME> .
' My Wal ' r , as I used to call you !
You 've been in low spirits this afternoon .
' My dear , ' retorted <NAME> , in a low voice : ' <NAME> , all over ! ' ' In-deed ! ' said <NAME> .
They all dropped softly on the ground within the gate , and lay there a little -- listening perhaps .
This sounded so like a falsehood , that the old gentleman looked somewhat sternly in <NAME> 's face .
At length , quite unexpectedly , he said something in a whisper .
' He ' s no more a monster than you are , ' returned <NAME> .
He wished to do anything as laid in his power to serve <NAME> , altogether putting himself out of sight ; and he hoped he did .
But I come up with ' em , and I crossed ' em .
What alone was wanting to the realization of a vast fortune , he considered to be More Capital .
Devil a word , gentlemen , the chair would say .
The sun was low -- near setting -- and its light came redly in above , without descending to the ground .
' Ah ! ' said the dwarf , smacking his lips , ' what a nice kiss that was -- just upon the rosy part .
She was in a state of lawful innocence , so to speak .
And at last he flung out in his violent way , and said , with a D , 'Then do as you like . '
Now , take a rest , and then we ' ll talk again .
Of my darling being almost smothered among the flowers , and coming out , laughing and crying both together , to my jealous arms .
The house in the city preserved its heavy dulness through all these transactions , and the invalid within it turned the same unvarying round of life .
' And whatever you do with your ink , I can ' t think , for you ' re as clean as a whistle after it .
He 'd find himself growing thin , if he did n't look sharp ! "
' More than that , you say , do you ? ' cried the other , pushing back his battered hat , and drawing his hand across his forehead .
They were not interchanging a word or a look .
Are you -- are you very poor ? ' ' I am but a wanderer , ' said <NAME> , ' making voyages to live , across the sea .
It was torturing to me to hear them talk of occurrences in which I had had no share .
Look at your boy : he _is_ your ' n , ai n't he ?
' Do you give lessons , ma ' am ? ' inquired <NAME> .
We shall never understand each other. " " Such a mean brute , such a stupid brute ! " I urged , in despair .
Mr <NAME> did not increase in favour with the Father of the <NAME> in the ratio of his increasing visits .
There were no other passengers that night , but we four .
With all her deference for <NAME> as contradistinguished from his portrait , Mrs. <NAME> had not the smallest intention of interrupting the descent .
' Now , you know. ' ' Yes , <NAME> , ' said Mr Boffin , meekly .
Something or somebody had superseded him as a source of interest .
' <NAME> ' t wait , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
He was very fond of pickled walnuts , gentlemen .
<NAME> : But you think that their abolition would damage a class of practitioners ?
His wristbands and collar were oppressive ; his voice and manner were oppressive .
There ' ll be beer to feth .
' How do you know I am old ?
When you are left alone here with <NAME> -- ' ' I am to be left alone here with <NAME> ? ' said <NAME> , quietly .
I believe I state your views correctly ; do I not , my dear Sir ? ' said the little man , turning to <NAME> .
I answered , most assuredly he did not .
Opening the door with all speed , he beheld the expressive countenance of Mr Chuckster , between whom and himself a fraternal greeting ensued .
His friends might advise him , you know ; now he is free .
Mr <NAME> was thus amiably engaged when a step was heard at the outer door , and the door was heard to open hastily .
I think of seeing her happy , and with friends about her , and brought up as she deserves , and as she ought to be .
As she stood behind him , leaning over his chair so lovingly , he looked with downcast eyes at the fire .
" Devil doubt him , " says <NAME> .
I hate your virtuous people ! ' said the dwarf , throwing off a bumper of brandy , and smacking his lips , ' ah !
' Come , ' retorted <NAME> , ' let ' s have no more of this !
He consumed it in putting his hand to his forehead and taking it away again , and in backing his chair into the corner behind him .
Those things would be the watch and shirt-pin .
Give her the letter , make her take the letter , put it in her pocket by violence .
' The prospect of an addition to your family ? ' ' The seventh addition , <NAME> , ' returned <NAME> , solemnly .
My fault is , that I have been true to you .
She held it up as if she were a beautiful <NAME> , looking on him , face to face , to strike him dead .
But we took a moonlight walk last Monday night , to talk it over at leisure , and I represented the case to him as it really is .
What is there you can not do , if you will ! ' ' Thank you , ' said <NAME> , ' you ' re very complimentary to say so .
" Your head is cool ? " he said , touching it .
Perhaps this is the reason why it is an article of faith with the servants , handed down from race to race , that the departed <NAME> was a hairdresser .
I could repeat this in my mind too , but I had not the least idea what it meant .
'As weak as water , ' replied <NAME> , with an imprecation on his eyes and limbs .
' Confound his impudence ! ' muttered <NAME> , rapping the stair-rail impatiently with his cane .
Then she ran to the old man , who folded her in his arms and bade God bless her .
It had been one of the first novelties and pleasures of his freedom , and was equally the delight of his wife .
" Are you a married man , sir ? "
The young woman seemed surprised at his appearance , and asked him where his mother was .
But bring him here , upon this crowded deck .
Soaking into this filthy ground as you lie here , is your own shape .
' Coach is ready , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , appearing at the door .
With which he hurried out of the room , down the stairs , up the coachsteps , and into the coach , without another word .
He held out his hand , which <NAME> clasped tight in hers .
Among them was a beautiful girl of twenty , who had been there nearly three years .
The man was not unnaturally cruel or hard-hearted .
' Will you try to teach me , <NAME> ? ' ' I must teach myself first , <NAME> , ' said I .
'Stupid enough , this , ' muttered the doctor to himself ; 'the boy must have made a mistake .
That 's the kind of man <NAME> is ! "
She put out her handâ€”a pretty little soft hand ; and her fingers closed upon her brother ' s , as if she would have carried them to her lips .
Our mother died there , when we were little children .
' Shovel and all ! ' said <NAME> .
That ' s the way it works .
And I have so many old parchmentses and papers in my stock .
' Look at his hang-dog air , ' said <NAME> , following .
My guardian lay at the <NAME> in the next room to mine .
Such a heart <NAME> carried under her rough robe .
" Faithful dear boy , well done .
Astonished for the moment , <NAME> fell back a couple of paces and surveyed him from head to foot .
" I do n't know who may not , if you may not . "
But of course I can ' t answer for the consequences .
" By heaven , he is the proudest fellow breathing .
That there was no hope of escape from it , unless the escape was my own act , I knew quite well .
' Bless the precious boy ! ' cried <NAME> , taking hold of me .
I have wronged her enough in fact ; I have wronged her still more in intention .
From <NAME> she looked at me , with a searching glance that seemed to pry into my heart and probe its wounds .
There was nothing revealed by the many eyes that looked at him but watchfulness and eagerness ; there was no visible menacing or anger .
You know what I mean .
" Not so easily as you think .
Let us love each other , <NAME> ! ' said <NAME> , fondling his shaggy head .
' And how do you think we are looking , <NAME> , -- I should say , <NAME> ? ' fawned <NAME> .
We ca n't take THAT in a court of justice , gentlemen .
<NAME> was quite at home here , in right of <NAME> , not to mention the <NAME> and <NAME> , and kept them in view with ease .
' They know what they ' re about , if ever people did , ' murmured <NAME> , drawing in her breath ' oh !
This , too , delighted <NAME> .
The amazement , suspicion , resentment , and shame , with which <NAME> looked on at all this , struck him dumb .
" Not enough , " says the trooper , shaking his head .
No wonder. ' ' No wonder , ' repeated <NAME> .
I was sent for , and the case was entrusted to me .
' What ' s come to you , <NAME> ?
I shouldn ' t have had the heart to put on gentleman ' s clothes .
<NAME> Grewgious being of opinion that she could not do better , she withdrew for the purpose .
Or so -- like a fried fish .
Finally , the worthy couple went away arm in arm .
' At what time will it be ready ? ' asked Mr Codlin faintly .
' I ' ll take down the heads if you please , sir .
'All that I could hope to do , and even more .
' A natural ambition enough , ' said <NAME> , coolly .
' It is truly painful to contemplate mankind in such an aspect , <NAME> , but our reception was , decidedly , cool .

Do you know what my great grandfather ' s name was ? ' ' No , ' said <NAME> .
It was very possible that Mr <NAME> had not yet left the office .

If you had ever seen her sister , you would know her to have been as resolute and haughty as she . "

They shone in every part of the dance like moons .
It is the <NAME> of <NAME> to him .
They were discussing this question , and were almost building up some weak structure of hope on his prolonged absence , when they heard him on the stairs .
' First of all , I ' m a-going to call you <NAME> , for short , ' said <NAME> .
In that one moment , every shadow of doubt or agitation passed away from <NAME> ' s soul .

There seemed to be no hope for him .
These all crowded about their associate as he whispered a few words to the <NAME> ; and then turned round and grinned at <NAME> .
I say I did not resent it , nor did I ; but I showed her , by not gratifying her , that I understood her .
But that was not to be thought of now , when they sat in the state-equipage with <NAME> on the coach-box .

It blows over the -- ha -- Surrey hills .
The matter being settled thus , little <NAME> began to cry most piteously , as if he had a foreboding that no good would come of it .
Then she would open it at the place where <NAME> had made it illegible last night , and call <NAME> up , to look at his misdeeds .
But , his long-cherished desire to know more about these matters , not only stopped him in his running away , but lured him back again .

Nor does it become less prepossessing on a closer acquaintance .
' He always prints , I know , ' cos he learnt writin ' from the large bills in the booking-offices .

There were some boats and barges astrand in the mud , and these enabled us to come within a few yards of her without being seen .
' From whom you are to exact the intelligence that is to be useful to me ? ' ' Yes , ' said the old woman , nodding again .
There was an execution put into our house , for rent .

" It 's eleven o'clock striking by the bell of <NAME> 's .
It was of little moment , indeed , whether they were intelligible or no ; for there was nobody to care for them , had they been ever so plain .
He was a very hard man , and her mother had long been dead .

But , dear guardian , you are late too , and look weary .
' <NAME> ' t you think that , ' I asked the coachman , in the first stage out of <NAME> , ' a very remarkable sky ?
Not of the family in the present times only , but in the past times too .
' It ' s getting on towards our dinner time you know , ' said <NAME> .
' It ' s so stupid at home , ' she replied , ' and <NAME> is so absurd !
' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' I don ' t think you ' re well .
The officer crossed to <NAME> , and <NAME> went up to <NAME> .
<NAME> was within arm ' s length of <NAME> , when he took such deadly aim at him , that he never spoke .
He wants that <NAME> man. ' ' With whom I saw you in the <NAME> in <NAME> , ' hinted <NAME> .
His appearance and manner ; are they so honest ? ' ' Very honest. ' ' And her confidence not to be shaken !
" Well , sir , I suppose it is .

There is a press in the room , but its hinges have not creaked , nor has a step been audible upon the floor .
I was mentioning your perception of my weaknesses .
Now , you ' re aware -- are you -- that you ' re in possession of property to which you ' ve no right at all ?
<NAME> very well understood that this was held out as an additional inducement to her to preserve the strictest silence regarding the events of the preceding night .
There was something in that third-person style of being spoken to , that <NAME> found particularly recognisant of his merits and position .
She hurried off , and presently we passed her hushing and singing to her child at her own door and looking anxiously along the road for her drunken husband .
Has the picture been engraved , miss ? "
' You have heard it all , and you ' ll not forget it .
Observing that the hand was pointed to them , <NAME> advanced to listen to their talk .

<NAME> gracious goodness heavins , I 've found him ! '
I omitted to ask the question , but I should think it must have been of about half a pony power .
Bless his heart ; it 's <NAME> alive again ! "
After all the trouble that has been taken with you !
<NAME> raised him so that she could hold him on her bosom , which was what he wanted .
She does not immediately enter , when they have parted , but remains looking after him along the street .
The family name depends wery much upon you , <NAME> , and I hope you ' ll do wot ' s right by it .
' It is short , no doubt , my dear .
You can ' t say more to me than I say to myself .
' It was her father that I got acquainted with first .
I ask you who done it and how you know it .
It was in vain that I asked her for her family name .
asked the sleepy <NAME> , shaking himself pettishly .
' And all friends round <NAME> ' s. ' He emptied and put down the wine-glass half-way through this ancient civic toast , and took up the box .
And <NAME> went home to brood upon it , and to meditate upon the charms of the unknown young lady , now as far beyond his reach as ever .
There is nothing in her manner to express weakness or excite compassion .
They made me laugh again by laughing at each other , and then we all three laughed until I was in danger of crying again .
However , the only thing to be done being to knock at the door , I knocked , and was told from within to enter .
' Come in , come in ! ' said <NAME> .
I have been in this trouble , and that trouble , and shall be again .
We shall know full soon .
That he was a suspicious , crabbed , cranky , used-up , J .
The streets are well paved , and lighted with gas ; the houses are large and good ; the shops excellent .
The breakfast languishes when that is done , the violated hatchments are avenged , and <NAME> rises to assume her travelling dress .
what strange things you fancy ! ' ' It wasn ' t fancy , <NAME> , my dear , I ' m certain of that , ' returned her mother .
Then I made an excuse to go in with my housekeeping keys , shutting the door after me .
I am going to <NAME> , having friends there .
When all this had been done several times , the <NAME> shook his head and seemed to think the matter had a bad look .
<NAME> , he observes that she has journeyed a long distance and is footsore and travel-stained .
<NAME> <NAME> saw losing cards in it that <NAME> knew nothing of .
These are the <NAME> 's impressions , my dear , all over <NAME> -- the children know them ! "
<NAME> ; he irritated it , with a kind of perverse pleasure akin to that which a sick man sometimes has in irritating a wound upon his body .
' That was the treatment , you see .
Is it really , though ? ' I replied that I liked it well enough , but that I certainly could not claim so much for it .
The back is <NAME> 's bedroom , and in it she 's a-carrying on , poor thing , to a frightful extent ! "
If it were my brother who had committed it , I would not spare him . "
And if you ain ' t the gentleman I took you for , may be my mind has call to be uneasy .

First , something tickles your right knee , and then the same sensation irritates your left .
<NAME> ' t be uneasy about me .
' Am I not right , <NAME> ? ' he said , after a short silence .
I have heard him on such occasions produce sounds of a nature similar to what may be sometimes heard in <NAME> clocks .
<NAME> my coat across at the chest , my love .
Is that , or something like it , the ring of the cant ?
<NAME> alone talked steadily and evenly .
<NAME> of an unfortunate father , but -- ha -- always a gentleman .
And rising quietly , and glancing at them with a look that was a little alarmed but perfectly confiding , left the room .
I should have committed murder -- I know I should -- if we 'd caught one of them rascals . '
He obtruded himself upon us in the first instance .
And you quite a small party then , yourself .
Becoming immediately sensible of the impropriety , he poked the fire , and extinguished the last frail spark for ever .
" Rents ARE high about here .
" They exchanged looks , but bent their heads to me as I bent mine to them , and we parted without another word on either side .
' Does anybody down there know what has happened ? ' demanded <NAME> , in her voice of authority .
He also follows with his eyes , the toss of <NAME> ' s head : as if to seek a direction to over yonder .
" I 'm sure I 'm surprised at that .
You took her for better for worse. ' ' I mun ' be ridden o ' her .
It may have been a mistaken one , or you may have ceased to justify it .

That ' s the vay to begin .
I said I owed him more obligations than I could ever repay , and held him in a higher admiration than I could ever express .
<NAME> , aye , mistress , it 's you , is it ?
' Oh , he ' s all right , ' said <NAME> .
What are you hooroaring at ?
" I do n't know what it is .
Stars were yet visible , but there was dull light in the east that was not the light of night .
' Mr <NAME> mentioned incidentally , in the course of our conversation , that he was going to take your valuable advice on the subject of finding such a partner .
What is your opinion of <NAME> ? ' Mortimer assented to <NAME> , and they turned eastward .
The mother and her daughters were engaged in sewing .
I sat next to her .
three times without making an impression .
Mrs. Chadband merely laughs and contemptuously tells him he can " offer " twenty pence .
Last evening he does this .
' -- Hear me out ! ' cried <NAME> .
I ask you , what is that light ? "
This being a very long word for Mr Sparkler , and his mind being exhausted by his late effort , he replied , ' No , thank you .
He now sat looking at the fire , and bit his lip .
' How do you do , <NAME> ? ' ' Why , reasonably conwalessent , ' replied <NAME> .
Mr Rokesmith , it is to me you owe this perverted account of what passed between us that night .
<NAME> wilt be faithful , little <NAME> ? '
He gave us a searching look as we entered , but his manner was both courtly and kind .
<NAME> him , ' cried <NAME> , as the chant began again .
' Where is it ? ' ' No good can come of your knowing , ' replied <NAME> .

She may be an hour , she may be more .
This dignitary , conferring in secrecy with <NAME> on the subject of punch and wines , bent his head as though stooping to the <NAME> practice of receiving auricular confession .
Have you taken <NAME> into custody before he had time and opportunity to beat me !
A vast deal of coolness , and a peculiar degree of judgment , are requisite in catching a hat .
I ' ll make <NAME> bark at you all day .
He has caused himself to be provided with a key and can pass in at his pleasure .
As <NAME> murmured something in his placid admiration , the ministering women at his bed ' s head asked him what he said .
<NAME> , shut that door at <NAME> 's back , and take them bits that I 've put out on the cover of the bread-pan .
<NAME> doubt , I am sure .
" He has died , " says the surgeon , " of an over-dose of opium , there is no doubt .
Or at least ' -- for I saw a faint blush in her face , ' you would have let me find it out for myself .
" He first laughed at my words , and then frowned at them .
Her hands were then nervously clasping together , but he took one of them .
' <NAME> , take a seat on the bed , will you ?
<NAME> springs and fiery eruptions , the usual attendants upon earthquakes , lent their contributions of confusion to the scene .
<NAME> 's first triumph in her new office , was to solve a difficulty that had completely vanquished me .
Because we are so very umble. ' ' Have you been studying much law lately ? ' I asked , to change the subject .

Two mutton-chops , three potatoes , some split peas , a little flour , two ounces of butter , a pinch of salt , and all this black pepper .
She described to us how tenderly he had taken leave of her , and how manfully and quietly he had borne himself .
<NAME> 's health is not strong , and I want to be able to assist him .
I doen ' t know , being a lady ' s , but what it ' s worse. ' She changed now , in a moment .
' Yes , he is , ' was the reply , ' but he ' s very busy .
asked <NAME> , setting down his cup , and looking his employer , eagerly , in the face .
He says this , not unfeelingly , while sitting on the bedstead 's edge with his face towards that other face and his hand upon the region of the heart .
" And reminding you that she and her sister had differed , had gone their several ways ? "
a horrible , horrible sight ! ' ' Who did you think it might have been ? ' asked Mr Inspector .
There was no resource but to knock at the door .
Because I am well aware of my deficiencies .
It is a foolish mercy .
A clean room , a hot dish for dinner , and a bottle of not absolutely poisonous wine , are all I want tonight .
In this house , and with this family , I passed my leisure time .
I can say to you of the healthful music of my pulse what <NAME> said of his .
These did occasionally wink a little , as the hot air barely moved their faint leaves .
' Heaven forbid , <NAME> , ' he replied , ' that I should do any man an injustice : still less , <NAME> .
After a trifling delay , <NAME> ' s maid appeared , and conducted him to a morning room upstairs , where <NAME> and <NAME> were together .
There was a fine , massive gravity in his face , I did not venture to disturb .
The blindness of my confidence is past , <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> ' s keen glance comprehended all of us .
' No , Mr <NAME> , sir , ' rejoined <NAME> with emotion , ' I will not take it up .
' Shaving-water , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , from within the curtains .
He won ' t ; not that he ' s afraid -- , oh , no !
' A bird flying to the hedge , ' was all he thought about it ; and came back , and resumed his walk .
I never saw such a picture of forlorn affliction and distress of mind .
I can acquit my conscience therefore , almost equally , by confidence , on such a theme , in you or him .
It set him thinking of her as he had first seen her , when she had believed herself to be alone among the trees .

' Oh dear me , dear me ! ' sighs Mr Venus , heavily , snuffing the candle , ' the world that appeared so flowery has ceased to blow !
From this time you begin your history .
" Good night , citizen , " said <NAME> , pausing in going by ; for , the man eyed him inquisitively .
<NAME> made no reply ; but , pulling open the door , of which <NAME> had turned the lock , dashed into the silent streets .
I recollect saying with my own lips that I was much too umble .
' Dear Mr Clennam , I must say something to you before I go .
'It would be hard to tell .
' She will be at <NAME> long before him , ' thought Mrs. Sparsit , ' though his horse is never so good .
A woman ' s anger is pretty much the same here , as in your fine house .
Anywhere beyond his reach , was no reply to the question .
' Just so , ' returned Mrs. Micawber .
' I hope good may be coming of it in the future time .
Not a thread changes , in the house of the two little bird-like ladies .
' What ' s the row , <NAME> ? ' inquired one gentleman in black calico sleeves .
Mr Carker , ' said the <NAME> , in the goodness of his nature , ' when I was here last , we was very pleasant together .
They can scarcely be represented as having lumbered it , so conscientious and precise was their orderly arrangement .
This , however , was a speciality on that particular birthday , and not a general solemnity .
' What is it but a grave ! ' said the sexton .
The meeting did not take place without great emotion on both sides .
This might lead to his apprehension as he passed along the streets .
I was not mad at that time , " curtsying low and smiling between every little sentence .
These gradually fell into their proper places , and by degrees suggested more : so that in a little time he had the whole , almost as it was delivered .
Heaping them back into the drawers , and locking them up in a rage of haste , he saw some papers on the table .
My old dear bedroom was changed , and I was to lie a long way off .
; and the astonishment of <NAME> was in no degree lessened , when he found it to be couched in the following laconic terms : -- " Mr .
Greatly relieved to find that he was not too late , <NAME> leant against a lamp-post to take breath , and waited the advent of the pony and his charge .
But I can ' t consent , and I won ' t consent , and I never did consent , and I never will consent to be lost in you .
The schoolmaster took a seat beside him , and stooping over the pillow , whispered his name .
<NAME> replied that he thought not also , judging from <NAME> ' s looks , and that it was a pity , for it need be .
And <NAME> had seen him as a predatory <NAME> of comic propensities , with a face like a red brick , and an outrageous hat all over bells .
Better try Mr <NAME> , second door on the left in the next passage. ' ' Perhaps he will give me the same answer. ' ' Very likely .
Is she dozing , old lady ? '
And we fell back on the guitar-case , and the flower-painting , and the songs about never leaving off dancing , <NAME> ra la !
Pay five shillings fine for you indeed .
' Did you ever see such a thing as this ? ' said <NAME> to Bar when he had been baffled twenty times .
I ' ll right thee one day , child , I ' ll right thee , never fear ! ' She took from her pocket a little purse .
At this crisis <NAME> interposed her voice , but not in the <NAME> ' s favour , by saying , ' Well done , mother .
We shall soon know now .
' So she does , ' assented <NAME> .
At last the ringing of horses ' bells greeted his anxious ears .
" But for your face I should think you were a little despondent , " said I .
Looking at her he saw her , with a face quite strange to him , shrinking back against the wall , with her hands before her eyes .
With my husband standing by !
" You look pale , " said <NAME> when we came out , " and cold ! "
' Lord bless you , no ! ' ' Not just yet ? ' said my mother , tenderly .
Within there , where the light was , was the man who as to both distances could give him up to ruin .
And as the lady ' s humour was considered to lie chiefly in retort , <NAME> laughed heartily , and seemed to expect that <NAME> should do the same .
' Bottle of wine to the gentleman on the box .
Do you hear me when I tell you that , my darling ?
The jocund travellers came on ; and as they came , <NAME> knew and named them every one .
Being quite alone , I cried a little again , though on the whole I do n't think I behaved so very , very ill .
" Hallowed be -- thy -- " The light is come upon the dark benighted way .
He seemed to be losing time unless he was moving .
Why can ' t they do as I have done , ma ' am ?
' <NAME> Groffin. ' ' Here , ' said the chemist .
' Wot job ? ' said the long-legged young man .
You may kiss me , if you like. " I kissed her cheek as she turned it to me .
He wouldn ' t let me touch him , when I tried ; and then she beat him .
A pitiful and plaintive look , with which she had begun to regard him when she was still extremely young , was perhaps a part of this discovery .
I ' m a-going to seek her at the post-mark. ' He showed it to me .
And what did the doctor call it ?
Says , " Bless my soul , sir !
This can he charged to nobody .
That ' s all they ' ll have to do .
It cost me five-and-twenty shillings .
The disease took the singular form , on those occasions , of causing the infected to find an unfathomable excuse and consolation in allusions to the magic name .
<NAME> had no maid ! ' ' I came here alone , ' said <NAME> ' It was my choice to do so .
Where are you going ? ' was the next compassionate chorus she heard .
' Thank you , but I don ' t want you. ' Some small voice , near his ear , would ask him how he was , perhaps .
' Who passes by this road so late ?
I go on board again ; open the door of the gentlemen ' s cabin and walk in .
The day was just breaking , and the whole scene was rendered perfectly visible by the grey light of the morning .
I see her grown up -- gent ' lmen -- like a flower .
Upon my honour , ' said <NAME> , indefinitely kissing his hand and bowing with his genteelest air , ' I do Homage to <NAME> !
' Yes , I think you had better .
It turns into curds and whey when I look at him. ' ' Well it may , sir , ' said Mrs. Snawley .
A diamond all set round with rubies ; that 's a gentleman 's , I hope !
She was one of those people who can bear a great deal of pleasure , and she never flinched in her perseverance in the cause .
Such tokens seldom flourish long .
Now , give me the address. ' <NAME> repeated it slowly , as Mr <NAME> wrote it down .
And why glorious , my young friend ?
<NAME> , dong , ding ; hammer , clang , clash !
You call yourself humble and sinful , but you are the most Bumptious of your sex .
said <NAME> , after a pause .
Had he ever been a spy himself ?
' I only go too ready. ' ' Very ready , ' said Mrs. Gummidge , shaking her head , and wiping her eyes .
Therefore we had sat , feeling keenly for him , but laughing , nevertheless , from ear to ear .

Thus the lessons of my life have been perverted !
The period of the family ' s stay at <NAME> came , in its course , to an end , and they moved , with their retinue , to <NAME> .
I am in my ' -- <NAME> hesitated a little -- ' father ' s business likewise. ' ' Oh indeed ! ' said Mr Dorrit .
Now , if I had stayed at <NAME> 's I should have been obliged to spend twelve pounds at a blow for some heart-breaking lecture-fees .
' But I mean , boy , ' resuming his gravity , ' what do you consider me in this respect ? ' touching his forehead .
Such a thing has happened here , often , and too often .
Where are you going ? ' asked the <NAME> , looking round at him over the glasses .
The old girl promptly makes a sign of entreaty to him to say nothing ; assenting with a nod , he suffers them to enter as he shuts the door .
<NAME> , having folded the letter , walks in that direction .
' I find I ' ve got a couple of coats at home that I don ' t want , <NAME> .
' Mr Carker , ' said <NAME> , brightening with a generous thought , ' Come !
He was a tall , gaunt , cadaverous man , in an old greatcoat and slippers , with sunken cheeks , and a restless , eager eye .
" No , sir , " returned <NAME> ; " it was going by post , when you brought <NAME> into the office .
' That ' h Jack the <NAME> Killerâ€”piethe of comic infant bithnith , ' said <NAME> .
For he is , by heaven , the most self-satisfied , and the shallowest , and the most coxcombical and utterly brainless ass ! "
He withdrew his eyes when he saw that he was observed , and affected to be busied with some scanty preparations for dinner .
He has been there so long !
The weather was miserably raw , and the two cursed the cold .
What a useful work a Dictionary is !
' A great deal , ' replied <NAME> ; ' but not now .
' Sound philosopher , ' said <NAME> .
So grey , so slow , so quiet , so impassionate , so very bumpy in the head , <NAME> was the word for him .
<NAME> <NAME> had made a communication to me on the way to <NAME> for which I was not unprepared .
<NAME> , disregarding my remonstrances , had hurriedly taken off his cloak and was putting it about me .
" 'Now , lift me up , <NAME> ; lift me up .
You recollect him ? ' ' Never mind , ' replied the old lady , with great dignity .
She has her own supper of bread and cheese to hand to <NAME> , with whom she ventures to interchange a word or so for the first time .
Things go too contrary with me .
I shall find a time when we can steal away .
' Uncle , you must -- I am sure you will -- release me from such vile and degrading companionship as I am exposed to now .
No one can never fill the place that ' s empty .
The man shook his head .
I tell you I must get it before I can give it to you. ' She stopped in the roadway , as if to put an end to the conference .
" What will you take for breakfast , sir ? " ' <NAME> was thinking how he should open the case , so he made no answer .
It was as if he kissed me , and I couldn ' t bear it , but cried out .
' <NAME> , sir , ' said the one-eyed man to <NAME> .
I have not the least idea what we had for dinner , besides <NAME> .
Another shake of the hand , <NAME> , if you please .
They worked gaily in ordering and arranging their houses until noon , and then went to visit the clergyman .
' Yes , <NAME> , that ' s wagging , <NAME> , ' returned the quondam <NAME> , much affected .
' <NAME> , ' rejoined the other , ' tell me ; I must know. ' ' MUST know , ' interrupted the other disdainfully .
And immediately darted into her state-cabin again .
His table was covered with papers , and he was hard at work in an old coat .
The allusion to friends , and the offer of money , <NAME> held to be mere empty vapouring , for purposes of delay .
Not tonight ! ' He comes very slowly back to me , licks my hand , and lifts his dim eyes to my face .
How long such conquests last , is another matter ; that they are achieved , is every-day experience , not even to be flourished away by Podsnappery itself .
" Why , you a n't such an unnatural woman , I hope , " returns <NAME> sternly , " as to wish your own child dead ? "
' Now , don ' t ask me how I dare , father , because that ' s bosh .
Those Furies , the conventionalities , being thus appeased , he left her .
<NAME> looked at Mr Dombey through her spectacles , as if she would have liked to crack a few quotations with him from the authority in question .
' <NAME> ' t that how you put it ? ' ' That was what I said. ' ' Ay !
' And so you ' ve got another berth , have you , my lad ? ' said the <NAME> , eyeing him intently .
Something that -- ' 'You had better bid , ' interrupted Mrs. Bumble .
" But pray tell me how you got it . "
<NAME> at me , I say , proud mother of a proud , false son !
' I could n't help it , <NAME> .
These were all the antecedents known in <NAME> Canon Corner of the coming pupils .
<NAME> <NAME> would say no if he could -- as he is unable to hide .
' I surprise you , I see , ma ' am , ' said the old gentleman .
They were all about her at the time , knowing that the end was drawing on .
Do n't be afraid , <NAME> , you shall come back to us again .
I replied , ' I , <NAME> !
I have long found that there is nothing .
" For the loss of his services. " <NAME> laid his hand upon my shoulder with the touch of a woman .
I got him back for you by means of the girl ; and then _she_ begins to favour him . '
I have a partiality for everything genuine .
I begged he would excuse me from discussing it .
It is appointed against such offences that the offenders shall not be able to forget .
' More than enough , ' the other said , and took her hand and kissed it .
' " Send young Gay. " ' ' Call him back , ' said Mr Dombey .
' Why , I think it ' s Mr Carker , ' said <NAME> .
She was not quite so self-possessed as usual , I thought ; and had evidently undergone anxiety and fatigue .
But look at him ! ' He pointed to <NAME> , pale and glowering in a corner , evidently very much out in his calculations , and taken by surprise .
He was not so much surprised to see me as I had expected .
' We were a very happy little company , <NAME> , ' said poor Crummles .
Now , <NAME> , the candles. ' The candles were brought , the fire was stirred up , and a fresh log of wood thrown on .
I can ' t keep my money very well .
' If I have found it best to conceal where my home is , it is not because I am ashamed of him .
With the round top of an inkstand and two broken bits of sealing-wax he is silently and slowly working out whatever train of indecision is in his mind .
The smaller birds might have tumbled out of their nests , fascinated by the glittering of Mrs. Sparsit ' s eyes in the gloom , as she stopped and listened .
<NAME> <NAME> without a hat , and his clothes torn in several places , stood by his side , and the fragments of the chaise lay scattered at their feet .
said the old lady , 'painters always make ladies out prettier than they are , or they would n't get any custom , child .
These <NAME> engaged , only too happy to have escaped any request for payment of a week ' s rent beforehand .
It may be time that I should meet with some misfortune ; but I hope it is not this . '
<NAME> might see that the shadow of the wall was dark upon him .
When he cast off the Patriarch at night , it was only to take an anonymous craft in tow , and labour away afresh in other waters .
The lady made no answer , but she smiled again .
' No , sir , it was not .
There was a formation of surface going on around her on an amazing scale , and it had not a flaw of courage or honest free speech in it .
and more than that , <NAME> , ' said a neighbour , who had come down to help him with the boat .
At the end of the second day , he saw land ; at the end of the third , his loom stood empty .
He shook as if he would have fallen ; and his hand -- I touched it with my own , for his appearance alarmed me -- was deadly cold .
' What ? ' ' All this , ' she rejoined ; ' all this about us .
' There was that sort of thing done to me somehow .
What did he live upon ?
' When you ' re ready for your snooze , ' said that honest creature , ' chuck yourself on my bed in the corner , <NAME> ' otherest .
Sometimes <NAME> faints himself , but the result is the same .
Maids are so hard to teach , now-a-days , that I have put her about me young .
You want to know why I played this little trick that you have interrupted ?
There are only four of us .
" 'Yes , master , and I 've never been in it much . '
Yet I had never been taught to pray for any relation but my godmother .
There were times , she said , of an evening , when he talked of their old life in the boat-house ; and then he mentioned Emily as a child .
They might be buried in consecrated ground , but he would have had them buried deep , and never brought to light again .
'Really , my friend , ' I said , ' I think not -- if your time is of any value to you . '
' <NAME> ' t it a steamer ? ' he pauses to ask her .
Only in the corner where the combat had taken place could I detect any evidence of the young gentleman 's existence .
<NAME> <NAME> arose , lighted a cigarette , put the rest of his stock into a breast-pocket , and stretched himself out at full length upon the bench .
I have an enemy -- you understand what that is ? ' ' Oh , yes , I understand that , ' said <NAME> .
' Give it to me. ' ' Oh yes , I dare say , ' cried the other boy .
I clearly perceived , too , that <NAME> shared my feelings .
Now , it certainly looked about the last apartment on the whole earth out of which any man would be likely to get anything to do him good .
He said ' very much. ' And <NAME> , with no little trepidation , showed herself at his bedside .
But , no Hundreds of people came to see the sights , and <NAME> looked in vain for the fulfilment of <NAME> 's prediction .
<NAME> told it again with great care , and rang every sovereign .
It was a passionate , loving , thankful , womanly action , but the hand made no response -- dropped cold and heavy , and took to its knitting again .
Instead of going straight to the gate , too , she stepped back into the passage , and beckoned me .
He wrote with extraordinary neatness .
For if I had that chance , in one of the humours he drives me into -- he 'd go down , sir ! "
You , with your practices of infamous foreign prisons and galleys would make it the money that impelled me .
The sun is tremendously hot , even to me .
' That ' s comforting , and I hope you may be right .
After which offensive implication , he cut himself a crust of bread , and threw the knife down with a noise .
' Did you hear him ? ' retorted <NAME> .
It has closed around me almost as awfully as if these woods of <NAME> had closed around the house , but my course through it is the same .
She went by the <NAME> , though it cost her a penny , and walked more slowly in that part of her journey than in any other .
" I ask your pardon , sir , " returns the trooper , " but I should wish to know what YOU say ? "
'Yes , sir , ' said <NAME> .
How many to the <NAME> to-day ? " " Fifty-two. " " I said so !
Now , the point was this .
' He never loved nobody , ' bawled Squeers , through the keyhole .
I know where this hound is to be met with ; time and place both .

On the road home , he was more demonstrative of aggressive intentions against the other foot-passengers , than comported with a professor of the peaceful art of self-defence .
" It was he who was very gentlemanly , I think ! "
Suddenly <NAME> gave such a scream that I all but dropped it .
' I wish I were not going to this dinner , Helena. ' ' Dear Neville , is it worth while to care much about it ?
The Storming of the <NAME> in the Air 20 .
said <NAME> , suddenly breaking silence .

<NAME> saw it , and ground his teeth at every repetition of the savage and cowardly attack .
' <NAME> , count , ' screamed Mrs. Leo Hunter to a well-whiskered individual in a foreign uniform , who was passing by .

They are no part of the case .
There was very little said at dinner .
She approached one of the wretched hovels by the way-side , and knocked with her hand upon the door .
She follows him , peeps from the court , sees him still faltering on without looking back , and holds him in view .
The fact is , our roads are not the same .
' Why , that ' s the <NAME> hand , <NAME> ! ' laughed the gentleman .
There was another loud ring ; and the bustling old landlady of the <NAME> made her appearance in the opposite gallery .
The touch was still in its influence so like a blow that <NAME> could not get many words together to close the subject with .
We never have tunes here . "
" I have come into such good fortune since I saw you last , <NAME> , " I murmured .
You remember me as give you somethink handsome for a handkercher wot she had left ? '
" 'Monsieur , ' said I , 'in my profession , the communications of patients are always received in confidence . '
For by that time it was known that the late Mr Merdle ' s complaint had been simply Forgery and <NAME> .
' It ' s <NAME> ' s <NAME> ! ' said the <NAME> , looking intently in her face .
Yes. ' ' It shall be done , <NAME> .
<NAME> , perfectly speechless with indignation , dragged the truncheon with the brass crown from its particular pocket , and flourished it before <NAME> ' s eyes .
I had no doubt that under all the circumstances we should be married in the most private and simple manner .
It must have been one of them : and the jury had to decide between two sets of suspicions , almost equally unnatural , unaccountable , and strange .
" Quite true that I have exhausted my present resources , and I am quite content to know it .
Come into this house for heaven 's sake !
Even on himself , its shadow was faint enough as he moved about among the throng , receiving homage .

The letter never reached its destination ; but that , and other proofs , she kept , in case they ever tried to lie away the blot .
The boy made no sign .
It had been uniformly gloomy and dull .

<NAME> was laid in the best of these rooms ; the second was his dressing-room ; the third , his bedroom .
' Ha ! ' said Mr <NAME> , with a portentous frown .
Mr <NAME> wished him to take it , and he had taken it .
inquired one of the magistrates .

Who did you want , ma ' am ? ' ' Miss Dorrit .
'Do you hear his worship ask if you 've anything to say ? '
After two o ' clock in the day , they are allowed to sing , a certain number at a time .
Now , my dear , put your arm a little further through mine , and hold it steady , and I sha n't hurt you ! "
" Take it in your right hand .
' Do you hear , cook ? ' said the lady abbess , stamping her foot impatiently .
We have all been mistaken over and over again .
The breakfast passed off in silence , for each of the party was brooding over his , or her , own personal grievances .
Mr Carker presently tried a canter ; <NAME> was still in attendance .
But she was so affectionate and sweet-natured , and had such a pleasant manner of being both sly and shy at once , that she captivated me more than ever .
In the meantime , it is always preparing , though it is not seen or heard .
I am not going to be eyed as if I had come from the <NAME> , and sit silent under it .
' You may consider yourself very fortunate in having escaped him so easily .
<NAME> nothing of money questions .
Here am I , content to receive things childishly as they fall out , and I never take trouble !
After that , she took the baby out of its little cradle , and nursed it .
' I am sure you would not .
If <NAME> ' r was here -- ' ' Ah !
That ' s aw enden ' twixt him and me. ' ' Have you left his work , <NAME> ? ' asked <NAME> , anxiously and quickly .
Desperately , but not wildly , for she knew that if she lost distinctness of intention , all was lost and gone .
" Among them odd heaps of old papers , this gentleman , when he comes into the property , naturally begins to rummage , do n't you see ? "
That was what I meant , I acknowledged , though he was a very harmless person , even when we had had more of him .
I had never , at that time , seen such a metallic lady altogether as <NAME> was .
She had obeyed without a murmur .
You ' ll ask me how I make out about the pockets ?
" I hope this marriage is for the best , guardian , " said I when we three were on our road home .
On the present festive occasion he emerged from his room , when the blithe bells were going , the picture of misery , in a full suit of Sunday penitentials .
'Look at his togs , <NAME> ! '
' Your husband , I take it , is not at home ? ' he said .
No gracious ray of light is seen to fall on <NAME> , kneeling at the altar with her timid head bowed down .
And I hope it is not at all unlikely that he may expand ( as a clerk of your acquaintance has expanded ) into a partner .
' This , sir , ' said <NAME> , ' is my wife , Mrs. Bounderby : <NAME> ' s eldest daughter .
<NAME> was my intimate companion and friend .
He made up his mouth as if to whistle , but he didn ' t whistle .
Oh , haven ' t I got him !
April Fool Day after that , I says , 'Now , old chap , you 're two and a eight in it . '
' I am not doing office-work , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
And <NAME> said , decidedly , yes he did .
' Of course you know the <NAME> well ? ' ' Yes , sir , ' rejoined Mrs. Sparsit .
I could myself have kneeled down then , so far away , and blessed him in my rapture that he should be so truly good and brave .
I seem to have been gone a twelvemonth !
' Now , my dear sir -- my dear sir , ' interposed the busy little man .
<NAME> <NAME> hereupon addressed me again .
I want to speak to you. ' Behold me , on my gallant grey , bending at the side of <NAME> , with my hand upon the carriage door !
" No offence , sir , " said <NAME> .
Looking after this man , <NAME> saw him go in at the door by which he himself had just come out .
' <NAME> , sir , ' he said , taking it back .
I had kept <NAME> 's flowers .
he ' s a doing beautiful ! ' responded <NAME> .
' Say what you like , ' answered <NAME> .
" I do n't know , " says <NAME> , opening his eyes , " why <NAME> should be worked to death .
I were a coming to ' t .
If , as your cousin <NAME> says , the sword wears out the what ' s-its-name -- ' ' The scabbard , perhaps , ' said <NAME> .
It was dated an hour and a half before dinner .
' Show me one , and try , ' rejoined <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> is down here. ' ' Who ? ' cried <NAME> , much astonished .
I am Mr <NAME> ' s Secretary .
Having delivered himself to this effect , <NAME> bowed again , looked into the crown of his hat , and stepped towards the door .
Nothing but your wife. ' The light hand stole about his neck , and the voice came nearer -- nearer .
I am afraid we present opportunities to people to do wrong , that never ought to be presented .
I will not tell you what misery he underwent , what agony of soul he knew , how great his mental struggle was .
The poor room was a happy room that morning .
' Ith a fact , ' said <NAME> , ' and even knowin ' it , you couldn ' t put your finger on him .
You needn ' t hurry back , my love , if there is , for we don ' t dine just yet , and there ' s plenty of time .
I am happy to report of this deserving gentleman , that his benches are usually well filled , and that his theatre rings with merriment every night .
I will mention the matter to-morrow morning when I take my seat . "
We have oftentimes the honour to entertain your gentlemen in their travelling backwards and forwards betwixt <NAME> and <NAME> , sir .
Every petty tradesman is to begin to pity her now , is he ?
I do assure you , father , that our first wish and intention is to consider your comfort .
But I have not the present means of raising the sum you have demanded .
' <NAME> friend ? ' ' Never mind , ' said Mr Fledgeby , shutting up one eye , ' any of your friends , all your friends .
' Oh , of course , ' said <NAME> .
How could they have a place in the shadowy conceptions of a gentle mind ?
His dread and hatred of the place became so intense that he felt it a labour to draw his breath in it .
Then , with a rapidity of transition very foreign to his usual character , he said , in pity for his former self , " Poor boy ! "
They was , to be sure and bring a note to you , Mr Carker , before you went out in the morning .
" What a number o ' cats you keep , <NAME> , " says I , when I ' d got intimate with him .
He had found Coavinses in his way .
<NAME> <NAME> immediately called to her husband that she would get them , and went , knitting , out of the lamplight , through the courtyard .
<NAME> about somebody else. ' As <NAME> took another cautious survey of the yard , the old woman made a secret motion to her daughter .
' Now , you see , <NAME> , ' he went on , ' a literary man -- WITH a wooden leg -- is liable to jealousy .
He is in his humble way a public man , but it is not in that sphere that he finds happiness .
There was another : a young man , whose madness was love and music .
' The old man uttered a loud yell which rang through the lonely fields like the howl of an evil spirit .
And yet he was so terrible a man !
No favourable leaning in that quarter to-day .
And why , my young friend ? "
" You wish you were going yourself ?
Everything seemed altered as he ran along the streets .
So the dream increased in rapture every hour , as Mr <NAME> felt increasingly sensible that this connection had brought him forward indeed .
She slightly showed me her arm , and it was fearfully thin indeed .
" Am I to read it now ? "
<NAME> was close upon him , and looked round the door too .
He was merely collecting himself to speak very plainly .
' If you knew what I am undergoing for you ! ' ' Of course he knows it , love , and will never forget it , ' said <NAME> .
I could not hear her disrespectfully mentioned , I added , without expressing my opinion in a decided tone .
In a few minutes she had ascended out of that clear field , in among the piled mountains of cloud .
" I sat with <NAME> last night , <NAME> , two good hours. " " <NAME> was <NAME> ? " " Dear little thing ! " said <NAME> .
The waiter retired , considerably astonished , and <NAME> motioned <NAME> to a seat .
Let us make haste back. ' ' Certainly ! ' cried <NAME> , ' the quicker , the better .
He sometimes took them to the street where she had lived ; but new improvements had altered it so much , it was not like the same .
" And I said , " I timidly reminded him , " but its mistress remained . "
' He went off dead. ' ' Oh , that indeed , ' said <NAME> .
Tracing it to its source , he discovered it to be caused by a sudden extraordinary rising and stiffening of all the risen and stiff hair on <NAME> 's head .
' I do , indeed , ' replied <NAME> .
Such opportunities as I have been enabled to alienate from my domestic duties , I have devoted to corresponding at some length with my family .
It is disgraceful to the electors .
All sorts of vehicles of burden are in attendance , from a tilted waggon to a wheelbarrow .
I have never pampered myself , and should not be ill .
I could have made my profit .
Then he laughed about her , and asked me if I had ever seen such a fierce little piece of incomprehensibility .
<NAME> had often wished to speak to this man ; yet she had never taken courage to do so , as he made no movement towards her .
Now it is even awful , stealing through it , to think of the live people who have slept in the solitary bedrooms , to say nothing of the dead .
Speaking as a sufferer by both , I don ' t know that I wouldn ' t as soon have the <NAME> lot as your lot .
Everybody was dressed for a Fancy Ball that was never to leave off .
Sing out , " good-bye , <NAME> , " when you ' re in the passage , and shut the door .
' You can , if you like , you know , ' said <NAME> .
Oh , you Jew ! ' The old man stood irresolute and uncertain for a moment , as if there might be further instructions for him in reserve .
It was all said in a moment , and they took me between them , wrapped in the cloak .
I am of your way of thinkin ' . ' ' <NAME> ' t make such a noise at this dead hour of the night .
' But I am not like you. ' The Father of the <NAME> said , with a shrug of modest self-depreciation , ' Oh !
She ' s a very taking and agreeable woman ? ' <NAME> smote the gentle Twemlow pale .
I shall come home when I please , and go when I please .
I counted up to high numbers , to make sure of myself , and repeated passages that I knew in prose and verse .
<NAME> ! ' They are in the act of ratifying the treaty of friendly move , by shaking hands upon it .
Is it true ? " " Too true. " " Can I only serve you , <NAME> , by serving your friend ?
' You can bear me out in that , <NAME> ? ' ' Eh ? ' cried <NAME> , looking from face to face with an expression of stupid amazement .
' I won ' t be silent , ' returned the nurse .
" He keeps his grog ready mixed in a little tub on the table .
'The cutting away when there 's anything wrong , and the eating all the wittles when there 's everything right ; is that his branch ? '
' I should have thought the deadness was a mild word for it , if it had been named to me when we brought you in .
" Did you know this morning , now , that you were coming out on this errand ? "
" An old acquaintance of yours , this road , <NAME> , " said <NAME> cheerfully .
A fish of the sea or river ?
So the time went on ; until it happened that <NAME> was called away from home by business which required his presence elsewhere , for three or four days .
" <NAME> , it _was_ I .
Do you never hear any haunted noises here ? ' ' <NAME> , ' returned Mr Flintwinch .
" Secondly , what will satisfy you for the trouble of producing it ? "
' Yes , ' said my mother , faintly .
As long as eating was a novelty and an amusement , <NAME> kept up pretty well .
Can you suppose there ' s any harm in looking as cheerful and being as cheerful as our poor circumstances will permit ?
Then , very strangely , I seemed to hear them , not in the reader 's voice , but in the well-remembered voice of my godmother .
And I went on at a mighty rate , as if it could be done by walking .
When is he coming , <NAME> ? ' ' What a question ! ' cried <NAME> .
' Did she tell you why ? ' I inquired .
You needn ' t tell me that , <NAME> .
' <NAME> ! ' said I , going to it .
Such brains are fertile in expedients .
At six in the morning , I was in <NAME> <NAME> , buying a bouquet for <NAME> .
And besides , ' added <NAME> , laughing as she pointed a rallying finger at his face , ' because I have got you in my power .
Nothing in the world , and no one in the world , could shake it or could move me . "
at last and at least , <NAME> must be told , ' thought <NAME> , with a sigh .
He came in and first tossed me some pieces of money ; then struck at me with a whip .
Whether they were or not , did not appear ; but they all had a weedy look .
' You know , <NAME> dear , ' she said , cheerily reverting to their former conversation , ' that I hope I may safely be trusted in great things .
I would have told him all my mother 's letter , but he would not hear it then .
I know what men they are from whom these schemes have come .
'It 's no good being proper in this world , ' said the first housemaid .
And how well that delightful old soul Mrs. Rouncewell is looking .
' For years , ma ' am , I was one of the most miserable little wretches ever seen .
You ' re a ready money man .
'There is nothing unusual in that , ' said the gentleman .
He turned into the <NAME> , and , having revived himself by twice pacing the pavements of <NAME> 's Bench-walk and Paper-buildings , turned into the Stryver chambers .
You don ' t think they ' ve gone to sea , anyhow ? ' ' Not gone for sailors , certainly , ' returned the mother with a smile .
'What do you think would suit me now ?
' Dear me ! ' cried that unfortunate gentleman again , ' I am worrited to that degree that I ' m almost off my head .
" Because you 'll come to that if you do n't look out .
' Oh Di , you bad , forgetful dog !
His getting on his box , which I remember to have been decorated with an old weather-stained pea-green hammercloth moth-eaten into rags , was quite a work of time .
I shall buy up some good Life Assurance shares , and cut into the Direction .
A merry Christmas to you , sir ! "
Now , <NAME> , examining this iron with a smith 's eye , declared it to have been filed asunder some time ago .
If you can ever give me help , rely upon it I will ask you for it .
What do we find , Mr Lightwood ?
' There was a very snug little party , consisting of <NAME> and her cousin <NAME> , and three or four romping , good-humoured , rosy-cheeked girls .
' I ' m sorry I should drive you there , ' said Mrs. Gummidge .
It was the queerest of rooms , fitted and furnished more like a luxurious amateur tap-room than anything else within the ken of <NAME> .
' The two youngest are only nine and ten .
inquired <NAME> , fixing his eyes on the Jew .
The silence was at length broken by <NAME> .
' You know who bricks and mortar is , I suppose , sir ? ' ' I do not , indeed , ' replied <NAME> .
Who would have thought it !
I have just been hearing of you .
" Well ? " said my sister , in her snappish way .
Upon my honour , I will keep your secret .
Either their beauty or the beauty of her arms is particularly attractive to <NAME> .
Nor do they see it any more that day .
'No , ' said the old gentleman , shaking his head ; 'it must be imagination . '
<NAME> confidence , so long preserved between us once , is restored , to know no further interruption .
<NAME> little thing , she 's liable to spasms , and it 's good for her to have her mind employed .
said the man , pushing her towards the door .
<NAME> ! " And he took another gentle little pinch of snuff , and lightly crossed his legs .
' You will not be rid of me so easily , I promise you .
What wonder that days became as years in knitting them together !
He knows his lesson , or he does not know it. ' ' He does NOT know it , ' <NAME> interposes awfully .
I fancied , indeed , that he sometimes chuckled audibly over this reflection , but the carrier said he was only troubled with a cough .
' Hoity-toity ! ' exclaimed <NAME> , shaking out her black bombazeen skirts , and plucking up all the ogress within her .
' What did you think of her , now ?
" And when she went from here , " I was proceeding , when <NAME> 's husband impatiently took me up .
I declare if I was Pa , I 'd run away . "
<NAME> was plainly disconcerted , and alarmed besides .
' I see , ' said <NAME> , ' a sort of brother-in-law o ' the have-his-carcass .
' By your informant , if you have one .
" Love him like a brother !
Three or four days of steady application tendered him master of all the facts it was essential to become acquainted with .
' What do you mean by a pike-keeper ? ' inquired <NAME> .
" <NAME> tract of marshes about here , I believe ? " said <NAME> .
' Back , ma ' am -- back ! ' said the editor .
' He has a proud stomach , this chap , ' said Mr F. ' s relation , on being reseated .
He had scarcely set foot without the house , when his father stood before him .
Of cursing himself for being there , for having fled , for having let her go , for not having confronted and defied him .
I had advanced in fame and fortune , my domestic joy was perfect , I had been married ten happy years .
Returning to <NAME> that night , we lay at the little inn at which we had halted in the afternoon .
' I ' ll never forget you , ' pursued <NAME> .
Bring the matter clearly before yourself , mother .
When I was less foolish and more composed , my darling took her wedding-ring from her bosom , and kissed it , and put it on .
Think of their all meeting me with it , on my collecting days , here and there and everywhere .
' There ! ' said Mr Meagles , throwing open his arms .
Where are that old man and that child you speak of ? ' ' <NAME> ? ' said <NAME> , hesitating , and looking towards his friend .
Do it now , or <NAME> is no longer so .
until the flattest echo in the neighbourhood seemed to catch the contagion and to laugh as enjoyingly as he did or as we did when we heard him laugh .
There is nothing in you to like ; you know that .
They 'll never expect to nab me there , after this country scent .
Perhaps I HAVE allowed myself to brood too much .
With a pretty little party laid along with the other party .
There ' s a moral in everything , if we would only avail ourselves of it .
' If reparation can be made to any one , if restitution can be made to any one , let us know it and make it .
The great part of us know well the other , and they all tell me .
After the lapse of some minutes , which appeared an immense time to little <NAME> on the table , <NAME> came back .
Very like Jo and his order ; very , very like !
Many of the workmen appeared to be strong men , and it is hardly necessary to add that they were all labouring quietly , then .
' What is that ? ' cried the child , earnestly .
The wind 's getting round again , I am afraid .
" Now , <NAME> , you know , " said <NAME> , " you and I understand one another .
Imagine one selected day struck out of it , and think how different its course would have been .
And a very handsome sum of money too , I think .
' Pratty nigh for the prasant time , sir , ' replied <NAME> .
' No one can harm him now , ' she said .
Keep her out , <NAME> , if you love me truly , to the last !
<NAME> <NAME> was not to be found .
What other course was left to take ?
' Where are the birds ? ' asked <NAME> .
' I do believe the woman hears me , and wants to make me break a wessel , so that she may have the pleasure of nursing me .
As nations are made to be taxed , so families are made to be butlered .
' Sit down. ' The Secretary sat down .
Now or never ! ' Bunsby didn ' t then , and didn ' t ever ; for Mrs MacStinger immediately afterwards married him .
Alighting on his feet , he took <NAME> by the button-hole , led him behind the pump , and pantingly produced from his pocket a bundle of papers .
cried <NAME> , with ill-feigned enthusiasm , 'or is that little Oliver ?
Unless you weep with pleasure to see me .
' But the space , ' urged the grey-haired gentleman .
She was dry and sandy with working in the graves of deceased languages .
'But , my dear , ' said <NAME> , ' I want to ask your advice . '
'Come , ' said <NAME> , 'these are not the characteristics of young <NAME> ; so he need n't excite your wrath . '
A thick and dingy Turkey-carpet muffles the floor where he sits , attended by two candles in old-fashioned silver candlesticks that give a very insufficient light to his large room .
Then he added behind his hand , [ ' Union , poor old fellow .
I am sure you wo n't betray me .
All the while , the steamer ' s lights moved spectrally a very little , as she lay-to , waiting the upshot of whatever accident had happened .
Mr Inspector watched the proceedings too , and kept his watching closely to himself .
The office was a front parlour , with a panelled wall .
Why didn ' t you tell me your little history -- that about you and the poor old gentleman ?
The wicket opened on a stone staircase , leading upward .
<NAME> wore -- ' ' Tops ! ' cried the mild man , rising in public estimation every Instant .
I care for no man on earth , and no man on earth cares for me. " " Much to be regretted .
At this moment , a low knocking at the cabin-door arrested his attention .
As if he wouldn ' t ! ' ' <NAME> ' t let it put you out , Mr Wegg .
From the portico , from the eaves , from the parapet , from every ledge and post and pillar , drips the thawed snow .
<NAME> is good enough to offer these affairs to me , but they are not in my way .
' You are not very intimate with <NAME> , are you ? ' said <NAME> .
' <NAME> is quite well , <NAME> , ' Susan would add .
<NAME> has quite departed from my breast .
On an accusation of murder. ' She started at the word , and her looks expressed her natural horror .
'Not to be done at all ! '
He has a great deal of eloquence at his command , undoubtedly , but I am not quite favourable to his style myself .
His skin was so unwholesomely deficient in the natural tinge , that he looked as though , if he were cut , he would bleed white .
Just so had she first dimly seen the face which she now dimly saw again .
What then ? ' ' The name of the master of the house is , ' said <NAME> .
Gonnows I were not a unkind husband to her. ' ' I have heard all this before , ' said <NAME> .
" Yes , I am afraid so , <NAME> . "
' <NAME> , of what consequence to our friend , <NAME> , is the good opinion of Mrs. Nickleby ? ' ' Of what consequence ? ' echoed <NAME> .
I am above the rest of mankind in such a case as that .
I am not afraid that I shall put a wrong construction on it , whatever it is. ' ' Thank you .
And really he did look very like it .
I ' ll look out for one like <NAME> , and poison him -- ha , ha , ha !
What is it ? ' retorted the member , looking shrewdly at him , with his head on one side .
He means to tell us , that a horrid female waterman is graceful ! ' ' Pardon me .
But they were very decently kept .
' He ' s a deal pleasanter without his senses than with ' em .
In many a noble mansion lives a man , the best of husbands and of fathers , whose private worth in both capacities is justly lauded to the skies .
' Rides rather rusty , ' said <NAME> , with a smile .
" <NAME> , <NAME> , I mentioned yesterday evening that I wanted but a very little to complete this case .
' No , I should hope not !
But don ' t you tell my father !
" Not to be wondered at ! "
If there are six children , six people come to hold them in their laps .
I leave no other charge with you . "
' I would rather walk slowly on , so as to gain a little time before I see her .
It was his naval way of mentioning my eyes . "
' They mark the graves of those who had very tender , loving friends. ' ' I was sure they did ! ' the child exclaimed .
You have received some considerable education already .
" Take her , my old friend , and take my gratitude along with you .
' Yes , ' replied <NAME> , turning towards the corner from which the voice proceeded .
' We don ' t shave gentlemen in your line , ' remarked the young proprietor .
<NAME> <NAME> gave a last hopeless knock ; the ladies were only a few doors off .
Take me as I am , and make the best of me . "
In every line of the narrative he had heard , he had heard his condemnation .
He was your nat ' ral born friend like , warn ' t he , <NAME> ? ' <NAME> had no words to answer with .
She looked up at it while she spoke , as if it were the fervent purpose of her own heart shining above her .
The room was destitute of carpet or of curtain .
' I ' m very glad indeed to hear it , ' said <NAME> .
Once , when there was a pause in the dancing , <NAME> told <NAME> that he seemed very fond of music .
" <NAME> , " said the husband , turning to his wife with a smile , " I saw an old friend of yours this afternoon . "
But the ghost sat down on the opposite side of the fireplace , as if he were quite used to it .
" <NAME> will look us up , " says <NAME> .
But , such awful workers , and such awful work !
The latter , who had a candle in his hand , called his man to take it away .
<NAME> grace as was visible in it , made it the uglier , showing how warped and perverted all things good by nature were become .
He had very ingeniously manufactured a sort of <NAME> clock from some disregarded odds and ends ; and his vinegar-bottle served for the pendulum .
That wasn ' t much. ' ' I am sorry for it , ' said <NAME> : ' not that it matters now , though .
' Decidedly not good , ' says <NAME> .
When he had made a suitable reply , Mr <NAME> wrung him by the hand , and fell into a brown study , as did <NAME> likewise .
I only mean that I suppose some compensation is fair and reasonable in that sort of marriage. ' ' Compensation to the lady , sir ? ' asked <NAME> gravely .
" But supposing you did ? " " It ca n't be supposed , " said <NAME> .
" Passed through here on foot this evening about eight or nine .
Foremost among them , smooth <NAME> and <NAME> , arm in arm , claim our polite attention .
That gentleman had gradually passed through the various stages which precede the lethargy produced by dinner , and its consequences .
The impossibility of keeping him concealed in the chambers was self-evident .
<NAME> , however , have been <NAME> and not Mind .
" I am sorry to have kept you waiting , officer , but I am rather later than my usual hour this morning .
' It ' s not my gal ! ' cried the old woman , tossing up her arms , and clasping her hands above her head .
" My <NAME> went out , <NAME> , before you were taken ill , and do n't know of your illness yet . "
His condition is a desperate one , <NAME> ' am .
" My dear sir , " cries <NAME> , " would you do me a favour ?
said the girl , stopping suddenly .
' You know , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' why I left here .
'Have you nothing to say to me ? '
' I hoped , ' faltered Mrs. Nickleby , ' that you might have an opportunity of doing something for your brother ' s children .
He says -- " <NAME> is so long in taking out his eye-glass and adjusting it that my <NAME> looks a little irritated .
If I were to meet that most unparalleled despot in the streets to-morrow , I would fell him like a rotten tree ! "
" My dear son , " said <NAME> , " you have four schools this afternoon .
' You make pincushions , ' said <NAME> .
What is the spike that intervenes , and who has set it up ?
' Yo-yo-yo-yo-yoe ! ' went the first boy .
She always has done it .
" They tell me there was no one here . "
They ' re more or less younger than I am , and they ' re playful .
It greatly affected me to see him so , but I hoped he might become more yielding , and I remained silent .
I trust in saying this -- ' For a moment the lady , with a glass at her eye , stood transfixed and speechless before the two Miss Dorrits .
I attended him in his last illness .
Among men who have any sound and sterling qualities , there is nothing so contagious as pure openness of heart .
' Halls of slavery , <NAME> , is mere stuff and nonsense , ' returned the unmoved Irrepressible .
' Oh , uncle , I am SO glad to see you , ' said Mrs. <NAME> , kissing the collector affectionately on both cheeks .
' Excellent , ' returned the mild man , becoming bold on his success .
' There ' s ever so many people in the river. ' ' <NAME> ' em to put on all the kettles ! ' cried <NAME> .
An Opinion Worn out by anxious watching , <NAME> fell asleep at his post .
He was not at <NAME> , and probably had been sent to execute some commission at a distance .
He would n't catch anybody else .
' Oh , no , Sir. ' ' Very good .
" _He ' s_ a Natural ! " The remaining six members of the <NAME> laughed unanimously .
We are all quite well , and <NAME> improves every day .
' Or , if <NAME> would be in better keeping , consider that I said <NAME> .
There is not much business done .
The next has no date whatever , which is in itself suspicious .
' I know it , ' replied the Jew , tearing a newspaper from his pocket and pointing to it .
I know he will , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , with energy .
I am far from strong .
' Yes , sir , ' returned Mrs. Sparsit , with a kind of social widowhood upon her .
How do you do , <NAME> ?
' And <NAME> ? ' added <NAME> .
The door of the cell opened , and the attendants returned .
' Is this anything that I can do ? ' ( <NAME> !
' I never saw a young fellow so regularly cut out for that line , since I ' ve been in the profession .
' Yes , sir , ' returned the boy .
' He ' s coming to himself , ' said <NAME> .
It was pleasant weather , and on the road we made my domestic happiness the theme of conversation .
This is the writing of <NAME> .
The young lady merely throwing off her simple bonnet , sat down to the piano as usual .
What I stand to , is , that he knows well wot that there <NAME> was never in that there coffin .
I pretended to put my balance away every night , but I didn ' t .
We must expect change. ' ' Of weather ? ' asked <NAME> , in her simplicity .
It was a hard matter to preserve the innocent deceit of which they were profoundly unsuspicious .

He came in my way at last .
You had better say it .
There you ' re a little bit fast .
He can not be kept in his present state of suspense. " " Mama , " said <NAME> , still crying , " would he be unhappy without me ?
' What is the matter ? ' ' <NAME> ! ' replied <NAME> , laying his hand on her arm .
" Stow cutting away , you know ! "
Could not possibly have been better , ' replied <NAME> .

' Is your heart mine still , dear Dora ? ' said I , rapturously , for I knew by her clinging to me that it was .

Not that he could doubt ( that , even with him , is impossible ) , but that nothing can prepare him for the blow . "
You ' ll be walking in your sleep next , my woman , and playing the whole round of your distempered antics .
It ' s wery pleasant for the prospects .
Help the gentleman to take her out .
It comes of flowing on so quiet , and of that there rippling at the boat 's head making a sort of a Sunday tune .
For I am not so bad as I was , ' pleaded <NAME> ; ' I am bad enough , but not so bad as I was , indeed .
It was reassuring , on such a night , to be told that some of the inn-servants had agreed together to sit up until morning .

The more he represses it , the more unjust he necessarily is .
And he eyed the Boffins with implacable eyes .

Let me hear your story ; where you come from ; who brought you up ; and how you got into the company in which I found you .
I ' ll bring you out , and your friend too .

I should wish it to be so deliberately said , and so deliberately considered .
Baffled boots from the vexed souls of disappointed outsiders .
You say they are marks of finger-nails , and you set up the hypothesis that she destroyed her child .

And everything a going on so well !
<NAME> -- ' ' <NAME> , if you please , ' said her father , majestically .
What if I had seen him rush away , mad , in pursuit ?
When I come down , I ' ll bring <NAME> with me .
<NAME> , do you see the old lady in the gauze turban ? ' ' The fat old lady ? ' inquired <NAME> innocently .
Now , I ask you , Nickleby , as a man of the world ; ' Surely not , ' answered <NAME> .
I think you must have seen that I was struck with those charms on the day when I waited at the <NAME> .
We must get into the air ; we must join our dear friend and brother , <NAME> .

The other name ' s Hexam. ' <NAME> bent his head in assent .
One night I was sitting in the chimney corner with my slate , expending great efforts on the production of a letter to <NAME> .
' Pray take me , ' said <NAME> .

But what will you take ?
And am I to grovel in the dust for <NAME> to walk over ?

You are free to go , and we to follow .
You yourself wouldn ' t hear of <NAME> , you very well know .
You remember <NAME> , <NAME> ? ' said <NAME> , appealing to another man in the lodge , who was paring the mud off his shoes with a five-and-twenty-bladed pocket-knife .
' <NAME> , friend ! ' said <NAME> , calling after him , ' are you blind ? ' The man made no reply , but went his way .
The old unhappy loss or want of something had , I am conscious , some place in my heart ; but not to the embitterment of my life .
Tell me no more just now , or I might do it again .
As he walked briskly along the road , he heard behind him , the noise of some vehicle , approaching at a furious pace .
I hear the bells. ' The wind brought the sounds of the church clock to the window .
' I didn ' t expect a visit from you , <NAME> , ' said his sister .
The landlord of the inn is usually among them , and seems , of all the party , to be the least connected with the business of the house .
' It was all there was , ' returned my aunt .
' Oh yes , dear ! ' ' <NAME> , <NAME> ? ' ' Your old nurse ' s .
He is making believe that he thinks of her good and not his own .
Mrs. Rouncewell , so many years housekeeper at <NAME> , sits within the chaise ; and by her side sits Mrs. Bagnet with her grey cloak and umbrella .
Her other hand pressed hard upon the table , and again the curious stir was observable in her , as if she were going to rise .
They all got to work without loss of time , and very busy they were .
Kiss it ! " " Do so , as he wishes it , " I said to <NAME> .
<NAME> this iron on my sore leg !
Finally , he walked across the room with a measured tread to where the window was .
' I know something of that hand , too .
There was no need of any caution this time , and no fear of being detained by having to play out a return match with <NAME> ' s boy .
I should certainly not have gone , but for the reference to my Uncle Provis .
Not that I reproach myself .
That it was strongly felt , and that there was a lively hope that it would prosper , there can be no doubt .
Mr <NAME> made in reply , a comic speech chequered with sentiment .
On meeting my eye , he said plainly , by a momentary and silent pause in that attitude , " Indeed ?
' At twenty minutes before seven , then , ' said <NAME> , rising , ' the coach will be here .
What would he do with coals ?
He and his deaf assistant were sitting before the fire .
What a rattle I am !
It is in reference to your letter to Mr and <NAME> , and this is what it is .
And I did hope it might just hint a caution .
' I am sorry you have , ' rejoined <NAME> , turning his back upon him .
At the inn we found <NAME> on horseback , waiting with an open carriage to take us to his house , which was a few miles off .
' Oh , you ' ve come back , have you ! ' said Mrs. Weller .
I hear <NAME> moving too .
And such voice he ' s in ! ' Little <NAME> gave him her hand , and smilingly said she had not seen him this long time .
We ' re going to have a wedding -- a real wedding this time. ' ' A wedding ! ' exclaimed <NAME> , turning very pale .

<NAME> <NAME> yields up his family legs to the family disorder as if he held his name and fortune on that feudal tenure .
I am disposed to think he had made no will. ' ' Oh , I know he had ! ' said I .

Here <NAME> looked at his boots and I looked at mine , and then <NAME> looked at my boots , and I looked at his .
When they move once more , <NAME> is seen to look up at the sky , and to point before him .
But this presses first. ' He debated principally whether he should write to young Drood , or whether he should speak to <NAME> .
' It ain ' t that she ' s not as pretty as ever , for she ' s prettier -- I do assure you , she is prettier .
Which I meantersay , if the ghost of a man 's own father can not be allowed to claim his attention , what can , <NAME> ?
If he takes and sends me out I must go .
We have stated them awkwardly , I dare say. ' ' That I dare say you have , ' retorted her mother , briskly .
Not a wured to <NAME> ' r <NAME> ? ' There was a trembling upon her , that I can see now .
But remember , my dear , your future is between you two .
His steps echoed through the low building with a hollow sound , and he almost feared to be alone , it was so still and quiet .
They were good qualities , without which no high place can be meritoriously won , but like fire and water , though excellent servants , they were very bad masters .
' It ' s a large sum to <NAME> , ' he said , in a dolorous voice .
' I was never up the river , ' added <NAME> .
But to give it you short and handy , I 'll put it at once into a mouthful of <NAME> .
The dog growled again ; and licking his lips , eyed <NAME> as if he were anxious to attach himself to his windpipe without delay .
' Now , I ' ll be plain with you , Veneering , ' says <NAME> , knitting his brows .
I could not say so , of course , or show that I knew anything about it .

<NAME> , in the mist through which she saw her father , and the prison , and the turbid living river that flowed through it and flowed on .
For , it was he addressed him with a severe countenance , and who had come in quietly by the folding-doors .
' I thought you might have know ' d him without it , ' said Mr Boffin slightly disappointed .
I told her so , and told her that I would spend any money or take any pains to drive him out of that country .
' Come ! ' retorted <NAME> , stopping to wheel round upon him , ' let ' s have none of _your_ interruptions .
' Never I mind ! ' said <NAME> , ' no , nor never nobody mind , say ' st thou , schoolmeasther .
I come to the second .
I will only say , at parting , that you do him a great wrong. ' ' I do him no wrong , ' she returned .
<NAME> , of your own noble will , to a ruined man !
He stood , half turned from the prisoner , lounging with his elbow against the bar .
' I find it so , ' replied the man .
Several doors were opened in succession , and finally his own .

Two ; four ; and two is six , ' measuring on the pavement .
He ' d take fire and blow up while he was about it. ' ' And so you would be rid of him , ' said <NAME> , humouring her .
Then <NAME> evaded and wandered away , while he was getting his man up to the mark .
My good mother lived in the country . "
' Is it possible that I had the honour , sir , of officiating when -- ? ' ' Yes , ' said I .
" What have I done ! " I knew not how to answer , or how to comfort her .
He reached the yard ; and his passion vanished in a moment .
' <NAME> ' t let him go alone ! ' screamed the females .
I was waiting for you , <NAME> , till it came down as <NAME> never saw it come down before .
Being left to himself , the savage had a dance , all alone .

" I 've got a high pair as belonged to mother . "
' Your father can be free within this week .
I am only unfortunate to have come in the way .
<NAME> at them , " glancing at the sleepers on the ground .
' Yes ; uncle <NAME> , I would , ' returned <NAME> , with the energy of both her parents combined ; ' but not aunt <NAME> .
And so , as <NAME> observed , <NAME> bless <NAME> , Every One !
' <NAME> ' r ! ' cried the <NAME> , looking down upon him in amazement .
' My love , how you tremble ! ' ' Because I KNOW you ' re going to scold me , ' exclaimed <NAME> , in a piteous voice .
Filled with this idea , he advanced at once , but stealthily .
<NAME> mistrusts and suspects me -- goes to lawyers , and is taught to mistrust and suspect me .
I have not lived in a walking country , you know. ' ' True , ' says <NAME> .
' Take care he don ' t hear you , sir , or you may be sorry for it. ' ' Oh , pray , <NAME> -- ' said <NAME> .
Without waiting for a reply , he inquired of the boys whether any one among them knew anything of their missing schoolmate .
And then the dream grew dim , and faded .
The sun was down , the light had gradually stolen from the roof , and the shadow had crept upward .
But I -- I am afraid there ' s something the matter with them .
" I heard you were released , <NAME> .
I rather thought he might have been here today , sir .
As it so happened that I never saw <NAME> again , I may at once finish what I know of his history .
' And what then , pray ? ' ' Why , then you may go as soon as you like , ' says <NAME> .
The moment he ceased , she looked at him again .
Nickleby , there is terrible news for you , and I am sent to beg you will come with me directly , ' said a voice he seemed to recognise .
He shook my hand and said no more .
' Oh-h ! ' ' I should be glad to countermine him , respecting the handsome gal , your friend .
The swarm and buzz , and going up and down , endure for days .
Will you come and see me today , at any time you like to appoint ?
' That was my speculation , <NAME> .
" My physician , <NAME> , my dear , who was so exceedingly attentive to me .
So forget and forgive all round , <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> of the no surname , all shake hands with one another round , and with the doctor too .
They drew back from the window , and the <NAME> looked for explanation in his friend 's ashy face .
" 'Do you honour me with your attention , <NAME> ? '
Let me raise your head .
Why , here ' s a dismal face for ladies ' company ! -- my pretty sister too , whom you have so often asked me about .
So , Mr and <NAME> had to prompt , and this is how they prompted .
But here I am , left with all the ridiculous parts of the situation remaining , and , added to them all , this ridiculous dress !
Two taps were now heard on the outside of the window .
" Yes , so you did say about ten .
" <NAME> coarse and common ? " said <NAME> , playing with <NAME> 's hair .
From the blacksmith's. " " Halloa ! " said the sergeant , staring at <NAME> .

He had taken scarcely anything to eat or drink since early in the morning , and felt quite worn out and exhausted .
When there was any little hint of anything being in the wind , he got lost directly .
<NAME> <NAME> , slightly nudging his friend to take another look , makes a shuffling bow to <NAME> , who returns it with an easy nod .

" It is close at hand .
Better than any novel-book _I_ ever see ! '
On charges of inviolable secrecy , confidences were interchanged respecting golden youth of <NAME> expected to call , ' at home , ' on the first opportunity .
<NAME> unconsciousness of what had happened in the home that existed no more , even the deep slumber of exhaustion could not produce .
" <NAME> , if I may speak plainly -- " " By all means . "
She does not care to go about with us ; she is lost in the society we have here ; our tastes are evidently not her tastes .
What are my agony and indignation next day , when I hear a flying rumour that the <NAME> have stood <NAME> in the stocks for turning in her toes !
How much more to hers !
He would bear nothing but his pride .
<NAME> on the part of <NAME> .
Mr Clennam , would you oblige me -- hum -- with a blue neckcloth you will find in that drawer at your elbow .

" Tony , " says <NAME> as they walk towards the court , " once again understand me , as a friend .
' There is only one phenomenon , sir , ' replied <NAME> impressively , ' and that ' s a girl. ' ' Very true , ' said <NAME> .
But all these occurrences preceded the final day .
Her pensive form was not long idle at the door .
I am getting old , <NAME> , and have lost nearly all my nails .
It will be better done without my being by .
It was sufficiently late in the year for the orchards to be ruddy with ripe apples ; and in a few places the hop-pickers were already at work .
The old man took off his hat -- he had no memory for the words -- but he said amen , and that they were very good .
He was left to himself , however , and there was comfort in that .
Shall we tell the lamentations that ensued when <NAME> found herself deserted by the faithless <NAME> ?
What would they have contracted ?
You fall into that habit , and then who notices or minds ?
They ' ll bother her head off , I think , before they have done with her .
It ' s a world of change .
He wants to see some fragment in <NAME> 's writing .
' Emma , ' he returned , ' that view of the question is , at such a moment , irresistible .

" Mrs. Chadband -- this gentleman 's wife -- Reverend Mr .
Whatever they could prove ( which is usually anything you like ) , they proved there , in an army constantly strengthening by the arrival of new recruits .

When that person discloses , my part in this business will cease and determine .
They left her at the corner of the street , and <NAME> led the way to <NAME> 's , which was within a few minutes ' walk .
Now , for example , <NAME> , ' said Mrs. Micawber , assuming a profound air , ' a judge , or even say a Chancellor .
The water-wheel of the paper-mill was audible there , and seemed to have a softening influence on the bright wintry scene .
Give yourself a little treat ! ' ' No thank ' ee , <NAME> ' am , ' returned the Captain very humbly .
<NAME> <NAME> , having laughed heartily again , resumed his pipe with tears in his eyes .
By degrees they let him know that doubts have arisen , that inquiries are to be made , and perhaps he may be pardoned after all .
Not a fortified town that they passed in all their journey was as strong , not a <NAME> summit was as high , as Mr <NAME> ' s castle .
You come and ask me in the street to take you for a Secretary , and I take you .
Do n't deceive yourself , my dear .
This last discovery was made by the two friends in pursuing their inquiries .
' Do you know how this stone came here , my friend ? ' inquired the benevolent <NAME> .
As the wretched creature mumbled and chuckled in her hideous merriment , the undertaker turned to go away .
<NAME> James he began to be restless again .
" You will do me the kindness to remember , sir , that I am not at present placed ? "
We call this a state of childishness , but it is the same poor hollow mockery of it , that death is of sleep .
What is your remark on that proportion ?
' You were in the tiptop fashion , and all the rest of it , ' said <NAME> .
We were speaking of <NAME> Minster just now .
That I assert no cause whatever of complaint against her .
Will you go , <NAME> ? ' ' Will I go ! ' she repeated , turning very red , and breathing quickly as she looked round at her mother .
<NAME> to the defaulter whose appeal lay to the tribunal where those severe eyes presided .
All those lights were extinguished before I could sound the words. ' ' Light ' em up again ! ' said Mr Meagles .
Her little light curls were as crisp as ever , and she had already her spectacles on , which made <NAME> wonder whether she went to bed in them .
YOU have got YOUR nose out of joint .
' It ' s a deal too good to be married in , master , ' rejoined <NAME> , after a short inspection of the suit .
said she , putting her hand into her reticule , " I have nothing here but documents , my dear <NAME> ; I must borrow a pocket handkerchief . "
You ought to be ashamed of yourself .
Of such melodious strings is <NAME> formed. ' ' Then it IS the lady as formerly objected ? ' said <NAME> .
Of sunset once again , and nightfall .

He then dressed for dinner , by taking off his glazed hat and putting on his coat .
On the other hand , she often looked at him , with interest and curiosity , if not distrust , but his face never showed the least consciousness .
Not near him ! ' ' What ' s his name , <NAME> ? ' inquired <NAME> , determined to be interested in the <NAME> ' s friend .
At least , if I could -- but I shall come to all that by and by , and it is mere idleness to go on about it now .
She is a very superior young lady , of very remarkable attractions , graces , and virtues .
' I ' m glad to hear it , ' returned the other .

If you knew how I have looked for you , <NAME> -- ' ' Wery hard , indeed , I s ' pose ? ' said <NAME> drily .
' Talk of fairies ! ' cried <NAME> ' I never see anybody so light to be alive , never .

He looks to it , flushed and fitfully , to do something with his interests and bring them to some settlement .
<NAME> , with fresh tears , kneels at her feet and kisses her hand .
They saw the vault covered , and the stone fixed down .
It makes me shiver , <NAME> .
We are not accustomed to carry things with the same hand or to look at 'em from the same point .
' Naturally , Mr Headstone , I have a good deal of influence with her .
As he raised his head from stooping to do so , he found the landlady beside him .

<NAME> , the high priests of this worship had the man before them as a protest against their meanness .
'He has likewise attempted , sir , to murder the female servant , ' said <NAME> , with a face of ashy paleness .
She asked and gave no quarter .

I don ' t know how long we were going , and to this hour I know as little where we went .
' What have I been a-doing of ? ' asked <NAME> .
After a hearty breakfast , the four gentlemen sallied forth to walk to <NAME> , followed by a man bearing the stone in its deal box .
After several imperfect words , which vainly attempted to struggle to the surface , but were drowned and washed away by the strong tide of her tears , she spake .
Give him sixpence , or five shillings , or five pound ten -- you are arithmeticians , and I am not -- and get rid of him ! "
" Pooh ! " said he , " I did n't care much for it .
But thou know ' st our old agreement .
<NAME> <NAME> and his shadow had not stood near <NAME> , who held her father ' s arm , but in a retired place by themselves .
In this manner they were fed at the discretion of their master .
<NAME> <NAME> hurries to the landing and calls , " <NAME> !
The father opened the room door for us and bowed us out in a manner , I must acknowledge , worthy of his shining original .
And therefore I am very glad to get out of his way and to go home with my friend <NAME> . "
<NAME> <NAME> compares the faces with one eye shut up , while <NAME> smokes in stolid satisfaction .
And what ' s more , -- the boat ' s drove tight by the tide ' atwixt two tiers of barges .
' I ' ll tell you what , sir , ' he said ; ' the talent of this child is not to be imagined .
' You ' ll be asked the question down town , ' said the man .
' It ' s very kind of you .
I believe she conceals them , and always will conceal them , even from herself .
The blinds were all drawn down , and the inscription <NAME> and Co. seemed to doze in the counting-house window on the ground-floor giving on the sleepy street .
The passenger booked by this history , was on the coach-step , getting in ; the two other passengers were close behind him , and about to follow .
But he called till he was hoarse ; nobody paid the least attention to him .
The coach drives up to the door of an inn .
We do so too ; and passing through our little state-room , resume our seats in the quiet gallery without .
She tried hard to retain her firmness , but he saw it melting away under his eyes .
Let ' s talk ! ' ' Do you always live here , sir ? ' asked <NAME> .
All I desire , <NAME> , is , that it should be forgotten .
somewhere , anywhere , for refuge , never more to look upon the place from which she fled !
You are welcome to all you have kept from me. ' ' Are those of your own name dear to you ? ' said the man emphatically .
What was she a doing of , when you went in today ? " asked <NAME> .
Mr Chick , finding that his destiny was , for the time , against him , said no more , and walked off .
' Dead , <NAME> ? ' I hinted , after a respectful pause .
Here ' s a match , and now where ' s the candle ?
I am sorry to see you sitting in the street . "
' I am going up stairs to Mr Fledgeby ' s. ' ' You can not do that at this moment .
The storm soon began to pass upon its way .
Now , my dear , about that crib at <NAME> ; when is it to be done , <NAME> , eh ?
I could be here in the day , and turn in the night .
Receive at parting ; ' here he gave him a southern embrace , and kissed him soundly on both cheeks ; ' the word of a gentleman !
Now , the unfortunate deceased was himself a lawyer and had a pretty tight hold of me .
You and I are very different creatures . "
" My dear Jarndyce , " returned <NAME> , his genial face irradiated by the comicality of this idea , " what am I to do ?
I am sure I shall be very happy to show <NAME> to you .
* A remarkable instance of the prophetic force of <NAME> ' s imagination ; this dialogue occurring in the year 1827 , and the Revolution in 1830 .
As shadows of her fond imagination , she could give them equal place in her own bosom , and wrong them with no doubts .
I have started up so vividly impressed by it , that its fury has yet seemed raging in my quiet room , in the still night .
'You 're very , very kind to me , ma'am , ' said <NAME> .
The little man seemed rather baffled by these several repulses , and a short consultation took place between him and the two plump gentlemen .
Do n't believe that I 'll leave you or yours in the lurch , <NAME> .
" I intend to , <NAME> , " replies the other .
" Why do you point away ? "
Springing a Mine Refreshed by sleep , <NAME> rises betimes in the morning and prepares for a field-day .
' Pray , my dear , allow me to conclude .
I am prepared to do the usual thing which I have done regularly and to keep this matter going .
It is scarcely worth mentioning ; but , is it yet ? " " I had no intention , in the words I used , to claim it yet .
I think about a great many things , ' replied <NAME> .
I suppose they have not done trying on yet .
In the gallery opposite to the pulpit were a little choir of male and female singers , a violoncello , and a violin .
' Well , well , <NAME> , ' he said , with a disappointed air , ' this is not to the purpose .
Their entrance , whether by premeditation or a simultaneous impulse , was the signal of revolt .
He flung him in , bolted it , and turned the key .
' You are a happy fellow .
This short examination followed , for the court was quick with its work .
His cold and distant nature had neither sought one , nor found one .
" No , I don ' t , " says the man .
A morsel of bread. ' ' Do you see that ? ' returned the man hoarsely , pointing to a kind of bundle on the ground .
Diwisions among such must come , and must be met as they come .
He don ' t care for me , as I care for him ! ' cried <NAME> , lifting up her skinny hands .
It ' s Monday morning. ' ' At once , if you please , <NAME> , by all means , ' returned <NAME> .
There is an ordinary for ladies , and an ordinary for gentlemen .
You have not acquired , under <NAME> and Mrs. M ' Choakumchild , anything like that amount of exact knowledge which I looked for .
<NAME> on our staircase and read .
Where was I brought from ? ' Boldwig !
This is the separation that there is between us !
So , <NAME> ' s tombstone , with her father ' s record of his death , was almost of the Present , for she knew it was to be .
Have you no remembrance of what has been said between us ?
Finding that his watch has stopped , he turns into the jeweller ' s shop , to have it wound and set .
And now let me take the liberty of asking you a question .
' I was going on with the little I had left to say .
She ' ll never wake till it ' s all over , and there goes the clock again !
' You ' re very good , <NAME> , ' returned <NAME> , ' I am sure .
I only wish I wos , myself .
" I take it as a compliment . "
Still I don ' t say that I ' m going to keep ' em always there , for the sake of the beauty of the landscape .
He was the stateliest man in the company .
Her friendly indignation had an exemplary effect upon her husband , who shook his head at the trooper several times as a silent recommendation to him to yield .
' What friend o ' yourn is dead ? ' asks <NAME> .
Where did they go first , <NAME> ? ' The wretched <NAME> made a gasp , and a pause .
' I am sure I don ' t know what to do , ' said Mr Boffin .
It was <NAME> ' s hand , and he kept it on my arm as he said : ' What ' s this ?
There being plenty of gravy to-day , <NAME> spooned into my plate , at this point , about half a pint .
Some hopeful notion of seeing her , busily engaged in her daily duties , before she saw me , had been in my mind and was defeated .
What ' s she staring at ? ' he added , in allusion to the daughter , whose eyes were fixed upon the face that now again looked out behind .
Finding him so very friendly and companionable , it was then that I asked for the pen and ink and paper , to write to <NAME> .
The little expedition down the river was delightful , and the little room overlooking the river into which they were shown for dinner was delightful .
' Where ' s the reason for it ?
We tarried here three days .
There is a tie of many suffering years between us two , and it is the only tie I ever had on earth that <NAME> has not broken . "
There are three free-schools already erected , and in full operation in this city .
Get up , get up ! ' Her mother rose , and cried , and wrung her hands , and stood at a little distance gazing on her .
That room was their boat ; that audience were the maidens ; and he ( <NAME> ) , however unworthily , was ' first oars ' ( unbounded applause ) .
' And ye steer with a rudder , don ' t ye ?
He had divested himself of his brown paper parcel , but had made no alteration in his attire , and was , if possible , more loquacious than ever .
' We shall be happy , ' said <NAME> , ' to see <NAME> to dinner , every Sunday , if it should suit his convenience .
" Where are you going to , at <NAME> ? " I asked <NAME> .
Never done nothink to get myself into no trouble , 'sept in not moving on and the inkwhich .
But never mind him now .
It would n't have loosened the knot , or kept the drop up , a minute longer .
You see the rock that lies in his course .
Therefore <NAME> gave two knocks .
" <NAME> if I know , " said <NAME> .
' To hang himself ! ' cried <NAME> again .
I should not be at all surprised if he called to-day .
The banners were very well painted , and flaunted down the street famously .
' Here ' s somebody comin ' at last , ma ' am , ' said the short chairman .
" Then grant me this one great favour .
" Do n't say that , do n't say that .
' Think well of what you do. ' ' Yes , you had better think well , ' said Mr Boffin .
" And was christened so , my dear , " said <NAME> .
A dense justice in a corner is beguiled into a wink .
' Then give me your hand , ' retorted <NAME> .
' When we worked like the neighbours , we suited one another .
Thinking of this , she did not turn away with a delicate indignation -- too many of her own compassionate and tender sex too often do -- but pitied her .
After each sitting was over , and the patron had departed , Mr Wegg invariably saw Mr Venus home .
A <NAME> on My Way LXIII .
Nothing but a gentleman , <NAME> ! '
<NAME> <NAME> was much tickled at this : as of course he ought to be ; and laughed a long time without cessation .
I think nothing can be plainer than that ? ' ' Shall I marry him ? ' repeated <NAME> , with great deliberation .
Mr <NAME> also had been utterly discomfited , and quite unable to assert himself in any way .
' Having your likeness taken , sir , ' replied the stout turnkey .
<NAME> waited for the last stroke , and then knocked .
But as my aunt had swathed me up , I made no complaint of being inconvenienced .
All I have in the world is in this room , except the cottage ; and that I have left <NAME> to let .
" Repeal it , my dear sir ?
It was no nominal meal that we were going to make , but a vigorous reality .
' I know the stick to be his , and he carried it last night .
The low arched door then opened , and the face came out .
I have not the power . "
' To vich sum , he has added for the house and bisness -- ' ' Lease , good-vill , stock , and fixters , ' interposed <NAME> .
I knew I recollected the face. ' It was , indeed , <NAME> , the ugly clerk .
' Come on ! ' said the cab-driver , sparring away like clockwork .
My father , <NAME> , he were given to drink , and when he were overtook with drink , he hammered away at my mother , most onmerciful .
It is strange to know no more about either , and particularly you , than I was able to tell last night .
The Secretary would have attended her , but <NAME> advancing and saying with dignity , ' Pardon me !
asked <NAME> , anxiously regarding him .
The influence pervaded the spirit in which they returned to the previous question .
Go on , Sammy. ' ' " Lovely creetur , " ' repeated <NAME> .
The touch had its instantaneous effect .
' For the parents of a boy named <NAME> , who unfortunately -- ' ' -- unfortunately died at <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , finishing the sentence .
" In all other respects , my dear mother , I 'll be as tractable and obedient as you can wish ; on this one alone , I stand out .
I see her , an old woman , weeping for me on the anniversary of this day .
<NAME> as if she knew all about it , do n't she ?
' Forgive me ; I could not help saying that .
' You know whether the cap fits you , <NAME> , ' returned her brother sulkily .
' Please let me hold the pens , ' said <NAME> .
One beautiful evening , when the first shades of twilight were beginning to settle upon the earth , <NAME> sat at this window , intent upon his books .
We will never go away from here ? ' The child shook her head and smiled .
<NAME> <NAME> V. A Morning Adventure VI .
Therefore I have particularly begged of <NAME> , and I now particularly beg of you , my dear , not to move this subject with <NAME> .
' Halloa ! ' cried a voice inside .
<NAME> <NAME> merely paused in the act of drinking , and bade him either name his business or leave the table .
I shall never get its name now .
How do you do , <NAME> ?
Two friends of the young man , whom we had attracted to the doorway and who stood there with their hands in their pockets , echoed the laugh noisily .
Whether of questionable childishness or not in any other matters , <NAME> had a child 's enjoyment of change and bright weather .
I dare say you do , <NAME> ? ' ' _I_ remember ' em well enough , ' said the latter .
" In fact , I have just turned into my teens , " says <NAME> .
' I would rather go alone , thank you .
<NAME> , the uncle , commands the nephew to marry .
For more than a week she lay there , little altered outwardly , with her old handsome resolute frown that I so well knew carved upon her face .
Only don ' t crow. ' ' I crow ! ' exclaimed <NAME> , shrugging his shoulders .
' If there were any good , ' he said , ' I could do on this earth , I would do it , <NAME> , for you .
' Pounds for two , I think , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , solemnly .
' You keep with us , ' said Mr Meagles , in a threatening kind of <NAME> , ' and I ' ll introduce you presently .
It is possible that the gentleman may , on similar grounds , object to you. ' ' I hope so , ' returned <NAME> .
There are Podsnap the <NAME> , and <NAME> .
Her husband had no relations , and she was rich .
You 'll go down ? " " Yes , " said I , casting my eyes over the note , which was exactly in those terms .
As these works are pretty much alike all through the States , their general characteristics are easily described .
She made him our guardian , and he was a miserly wretch who grudged us food to eat , and clothes to wear .
' Yes , ' said <NAME> , biting his lip .
It hushed the eloquent , struck down the powerful , abolished the beautiful and good .
Mrs General conceded that high privilege , and here she was .
I have had unformed ideas of striving afresh , beginning anew , shaking off sloth and sensuality , and fighting out the abandoned fight .
But this was the origin of a series of Sunday excursions that these two curious companions made together .
She is the same bright vision to me , at present , that she was before I made <NAME> ' s acquaintance .
At last , the <NAME> read himself into a light slumber .
" That was when you never ought to have asked for the security , <NAME> , and when you never ought to have got it , all things considered .
There is no hurry or greediness apparent in the despatch of the meal .
My deary , show me a better !
' But it ' s worth the pain of hearing , only to know that Mrs. <NAME> recovered it , isn ' t it , <NAME> ? ' cried <NAME> .
We had , on our way out , to cross a paved hall , with glass sides and roof , over which a vine was trained .
You know that <NAME> is dead ; that <NAME> has confessed ; that there is no hope of any further gain .
At length , a low cry of pain broke the stillness that prevailed ; and uttering it , the boy awoke .
It will be like coming to the old <NAME> again . "
<NAME> faith in , and immeasurable admiration of , the <NAME> of the <NAME> , succeeded , and threw the <NAME> into a wondering trance .
And what more could I possibly do , if I did believe it ! ' ' You are a singular politician , ' said <NAME> .
I have no false pride .
I should think her like me .
All this was done with the greatest dispatch and without the waste of a moment ; yet nobody was at all hurried .
It is even difficult for me to believe that there was a gap of full two months between my return to <NAME> and the arrival of that birthday .
Every one must. ' ' I hope so , ' said the cherub .
' " " The man says ? " I observed , as <NAME> waited for me to speak .
Still <NAME> said , think of the situation !
' And vere is <NAME> ? ' inquired the old gentleman .
<NAME> <NAME> smoothed his head and face , and stood looking at the fire .
' I am pretty much as usual , sir , ' replied <NAME> .
' -- are not to be combated by any one , and I address myself to no such hopeless task .
" It does her credit , Mat ! "
I sit down by the fire , thinking with a blind remorse of all those secret feelings I have nourished since my marriage .
' I think , father , I require a little time. ' ' Papa is a preferable mode of address , ' observed Mrs General .
Here ' s the cottage , taking one time with another , will produce say seventy pounds a year .
The Courier , with agitation in his voice , announced ' <NAME> ! ' Mr <NAME> ' s overwrought heart bounded as he leaped up .
He wore a black velvet waistcoat , with thunder-and-lightning buttons ; and a blue striped shirt , with a white false collar .
Is she married ? " " Yes. " It was a needless question , for a new desolation in the desolate house had told me so .
" For to-day , I have , my friend .
They like me for his sake , as I do everything I do in life for his sake .
' I ha ' n ' t got a glass , ' said <NAME> .
The members of the deputation looked fiercely at each other , and afterwards at the member .
And he is making hay of the grass which is flesh , for his three daughters .
Why , he would answer , " Away with it ! " That ' s what he would answer , gentlemen .
' May I ask where it happened , Mr Twemlow ?
' Indeed , you have avoided me , Mr Carker , ' said <NAME> , with the tears rising to his eyes ; so true was his compassion .
In Fashion It is but a glimpse of the world of fashion that we want on this same miry afternoon .
' <NAME> , I am going home .
' <NAME> , <NAME> ! ' said the stout gentleman , when the citadel was taken , and the besiegers and besieged sat down to dinner .
' Send my fellow here. ' ' Gone to bed , sir. ' ' Tell him to get up , and pack up. ' He wrote two more notes .
" You know what you have got to do .
' You are a very old friend of my nephew ' s , <NAME> , ' said my aunt .
I thank you for the question .
As to the washerwoman pawning the clothes , and coming in a state of penitent intoxication to apologize , I suppose that might have happened several times to anybody .
He means plain <NAME> , <NAME> -- <NAME> -- Josh .
More striking still was some indefinable resemblance , in the face of <NAME> , to both .
' I am , sir , ' replied <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> had laid the child down on his own bed , and her head had gradually fallen on the pillow beside her pretty charge .
No child could have surpassed <NAME> in inexperience of everything but wind and weather ; in simplicity , credulity , and generous trustfulness .
Why , applause from the house when you first come on .
Ride on over all obstacles , and win the race ! ' ' And win what race ? ' said I .
<NAME> ' t be too proud to come and see us , when you have made your fortune. ' ' All right ! ' said <NAME> , and went .
Yet that would be energy. ' ' Precisely my view of the case , <NAME> .
'You may depend upon me , young man , ' answered <NAME> , bowing himself gradually towards the ladder , with excessive politeness .
' For the " How " I come to you .
So she was -- so she was. ' ' And our friend was soothing her anguish , ' said <NAME> , rather maliciously .
' <NAME> , sir , ' repeated the gentleman haughtily .
That he had his reasons for this , he knew full well .
That he himself had several times ' reckoned up ' <NAME> , but had never been able to bring him to a satisfactory criminal total .
His luck ' s got fouled under the keels of the barges .
He may not deserve it , for we know no certain ill of him .
We found that a steamer for <NAME> was likely to suit our purpose best , and we directed our thoughts chiefly to that vessel .
He walked on , and she did not appear to hear his steps until he was close upon her .
' I am sure I am glad to hear it , but I don ' t know how. ' ' Pitching somebody into a mud-cart , ' said <NAME> .
Then do the swains appear with tea , with lemonade , with sandwiches , with homage .
Then they repaired to the usual family room , to receive <NAME> with a becoming show of indifference .
Mr Plornish could not conceal his exultation in her accomplishments as a linguist .
None of them ever pay .
<NAME> , far more fully than the <NAME> Newsman ever did , a <NAME> ' s Party , given by <NAME> at his Lodgings in the Borough 33 .
' You have thrown yourself away , ' said <NAME> , shaking his head .
' I am unhappily a widower , ' said I .
' You know this gentleman , I believe ? ' I made my gentleman a distant bow , and <NAME> barely recognized him .
Brooding over the fire , with his dried little head in his dried little hands , and his dried little elbows on his dried little knees , <NAME> is melancholy .
I said , ' Near <NAME> , ' which was all I knew .
The old house had been long ago pulled down , and a fine broad road was in its place .
I make a respectable income by it .
' But I don ' t know your ' n. ' ' That ' s quite another thing , ' said <NAME> .
I was not aware that anything was wrong .
Suddenly the door was unlocked on the inside , and flung violently open .
The lamps across his streets had a portentously elastic swing with them .
And as to being common , I do n't make it out at all clear .
' Are you better now , mother ? ' asked one of the women .
Supported only by a sense that she was bent on conquering in her life-long fight , she went on .
But Mr <NAME> shook his head , and wouldn ' t hear of that being possible .
<NAME> ' ever , none on ' em answered ; so they gave out that he ' d run away , and she kep ' on the bis ' ness .
He had never conceived an aversion to her : it had not been worth his while or in his humour .
He ' s as like his Papa as he can be .
There was no divided responsibility now ; the whole burden of their two lives had fallen upon her , and henceforth she must think and act for both .
' No , my dear , no , not an atom from anybody ' s hand but mine if you please .
I looked at her , but I could not see her , I could not hear her , I could not draw my breath .
But that you have been trying me , and tampering with me , I am now sure .
Widows , gentlemen , are not usually timorous , as my uncle used to say .
I am ashamed to seem so selfish , but I don ' t really mean it .
' You ' ll have as much as I shall .
I thus became aware of the mutual relations between them and <NAME> , which were exemplified in the following manner .
' Oh I ' ve run such a way after you ! ' ' What do you want with me ? ' said Mr Abel .
A rap at the door startled him in this occupation .
' Do you know that person ' s name ? ' he inquired of the man in an audible voice ; pointing out <NAME> as he put the question .
He had made one step towards it , before he checked himself .
I am certain that you do n't forget by what a noble character , <NAME> .
She often moralized over her work on the tricks and the manners of that venerable cheat , but made her little purchases elsewhere , and lived a secluded life .
We ' re positively getting on , you know .
<NAME> would only say then , that he repelled the hon .
' Coolish ! ' observed <NAME> , stirring the fire .
If I were not dumb , you would be deaf .
Many and many a time had my fingers longed to tear him .
'Then you return my love ? '
So , whether he lives or dies , what does it come to ?
This reminds me that I have not been able to do so , and that I sometimes almost despair of ever being able to do so .
He spoke of it more than once on the remainder of the way home , and more than once when they got home .
Mrs <NAME> had kept watch and ward over little <NAME> and his sister for nearly twelve months .
But , somehow , it had all failed .
It seemed , too , that <NAME> and <NAME> had gone out upon a visit in the neighbourhood , and would not return before night .
My wonder is , that you are not in earnest yourself , by this time , Agnes. ' <NAME> laughed again , and shook her head .
Her strength held out to enable her to arrange the letter in her breast , so as that it could be seen that she had a paper there .
That 's my view of such things , speaking as a child ! "
' You ' re quite a stranger ! ' ' Yes .
' Why , <NAME> ! ' she added with astonishment , seeing him first .
All regret will be unavailing , and deep and bitter it must be .
In all these movements he was closely followed by the eyes of <NAME> , as if that young gentleman expected to see the thorn in action .
He is intent upon various new expenses , -- horses , and carriages , and lavish appearances of all kinds .
' No offence , sir , ' said <NAME> , humbly .
Many a time I 've heard my old fellow-serjeant of that name ; and a moderate man he was in all respects , as ever I come across ! "
" Did you hear me ask you where you have come from ? "
<NAME> there nobody else to come ? ' ' I beg your pardon , <NAME> , ' returned <NAME> .
<NAME> 's niece 's sisters , and all the other ladies , expressed the same opinion .
This is indeed an acquisition .
It ' s much better he shouldn ' t come to-night. ' The schoolmaster lighted a candle , fastened the window-shutter , and closed the door .
You observe that I say , I suppose .
He pushed against the garden-gate ; it was unlocked , and swung open on its hinges .
He made the cottage smaller than it need have been , by being so very much out of proportion to it .
Is that the reason , aunt ? ' ' <NAME> , ' said the lady , ' but not all .
Then I would make a fact so disgraceful known , and boldly challenge society to set it right .
' <NAME> ' t be hard upon him , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
You were talking of tampering , just now .
They are both written in good faith , I have no doubt , and without any collusion .
And all in the house did the same .
But what -- hey ? -- Lord forgive us ! -- Mrs <NAME> muttered some ejaculation to this effect , and turned giddy .
It was a very small establishment , wherein a decent woman sat behind the counter working at her needle .
And I hope that he may find it " -- <NAME> again looks grave -- " to his satisfaction . "
Their <NAME> bonnets , ornamented with plumes of jet black feathers , Mr <NAME> carried on his instrument .
I think I observed , myself , that it was highly creditable to all concerned .
' Very sorry ! ' said the furious magistrate .
Some man fell in with a splash , and was pulled out again with a roar of laughter .
Anyways we will hope so now .
The noble lady ' s condition on these delightful occasions was one compounded of heroic endurance and heroic forgiveness .
' No , my dear , ' replied the collector , ' no .
" So , as I happen to be in the habit of coming about your premises , you take me into your confidence , do n't you ? "
He ' s what you may call a rasper , is <NAME> .
We pushed off again , and made what way we could .
The account is now favourably balanced : my creditor has accepted a composition .
I see you there a many times , as plain as ever I see you on them misty marshes .
and the bedpost was his own .
Her colour came and went once more ; and once more , as she bent her head , I saw the same sad smile .
I thought of our house shut up and hushed .
' It ' s me -- Short ' -- a voice called through the keyhole .
There was a pair of trousers there .
What happiness was ours that day , what joy , what rest , what hope , what gratitude , what bliss !
The company had departed for another town more than twenty miles off , and had opened there last night .
He observed us with a genial interest , but there seemed , if I may venture on such a contradiction , nothing selfish in it .
" Thank you , sir , I am sure , " returns the stationer with his cough of deference .
The Evening of a <NAME> Day 25 .
" But nothing that might not be sent to a pattern young lady ? "
' Come away for tonight ! ' ' I will not , by G -- , ' he replied .
<NAME> is the best policy. -- I always find it so myself .
I _do_ understand you before you pint it out .
" Good day , madame , " said the new-comer .
And <NAME> ( you good little Pa ) , you don ' t take milk .
<NAME> him , when he theeth our horthe begin to danthe , not to be afraid of being thpilt , but to look out for a pony-gig coming up .
One reflection disturbed him far more than any selfish considerations arising out of his own position .
I am sure you know me better .
Agnes and hospitality prevailed , however , and I conducted him to my fireside .
Having closed the door , to prevent being overheard , he sank into a chair , and said , in a low voice -- ' " Hush !
<NAME> cries of ' Shame , ' mingled with groans and hisses , prevailed for a quarter of an hour .
But she soon cheered up , and we did wonders with it before we went to bed .
Oh , look at it , look at it !
And I said yes , and she said she knew only one or two places about here , but had lost her way and could n't find them .
' I , with poor father ' s grave not even cleared of undeserved stain and shame , and he trying to clear it for me !
Given out on the Wednesday night at eight o'clock , brought in on the Thursday morning at half after nine . "
He tries this , swings it , poises it , and lays it by , with the knapsack , on a window-seat .
From a very early age I have detected what those about me thought they hid from me .
' <NAME> , ' said the old gentleman ; ' it was not your fault that he fell in love with you , I suppose ?
' All of a sudden the coach stopped .
'If you are in poverty or affliction I shall be truly glad to relieve you if I can , -- I shall indeed .
The <NAME> was sitting in his easy-chair by the fireside , and his young wife was on a stool at his feet .

She was in great agitation .

' Have a roast fowl , ' said <NAME> , ' with a bit of weal stuffing and some egg sauce .

' A dependence upon him , ' said <NAME> , ' would embitter my whole life .
They were painted , I think , by the artist who had touched up the <NAME> doors with red and gold ; for I seemed to recognise his style immediately .
There was no other question that I knew of in the world , and only <NAME> could give the answer to it .
' Of course I did , ' said my aunt , ' and was therefore easily silenced .
<NAME> ' t you know she has ?
It does as well as anything else , for a time .
It was soon done , and the gate of the <NAME> ' <NAME> closed upon them .
How ' s that ? ' ' I supposed he had come home , ' Pleasant explained .
The handsome lady -- so like , oh so like ! -- regarded me with a fixed look , and put her hand to her forehead .
The conversation was here interrupted by a moan from the sick woman .
" What do you come snivelling here for ? " " I did n't go to do it , <NAME> Wemmick. " " You did , " said <NAME> .
You ' re casting your eye round the shop , Mr Wegg .
' Wot ' s that for , <NAME> ? ' inquired <NAME> , directing <NAME> ' s attention to the target in question .
That she couldn ' t help it .
Have I a friend here ?
Four hims and a her .
I was such a silly little creature !
I was a ' most as well as I was .
Mr <NAME> was resolved to show her that he was supreme .
Mr Carker the <NAME> drew a chair close before the fire , and fell to beating the coals softly with the poker .

' I am sorry to say , <NAME> , I can ' t advance your object , ' said <NAME> , nervously .
And I ' ll tell you why , <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> seats himself upon another .
The only article in which <NAME> dealt , that was not hard , was gingerbread .
<NAME> had known it , and seen it , without looking at her .
My <NAME> has been down at what she calls , in familiar conversation , her " place " in <NAME> .
The room smelt close and unwholesome ; the walls were dirt-discoloured ; and the ceiling blackened .
That ' s going according to the <NAME> , that is. ' ' Mr .

' Have a bit. ' ' I couldn ' t eat a morsel , ' replied his wife .
' <NAME> him about the <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
And I considered whether , if it should signify any one of these meanings , which was so very likely , could I quite answer for myself ?

' His residence -- ' ' Is at present at the Angel at Bury. ' ' At <NAME> ? ' ' At <NAME> , not many miles from here .
' I speak to you for the sake of others .
He said to me , " <NAME> up to the top of the house , sir , and I ' ll show you a handsome girl .
' It was a vain threat. ' We drove away , out of town , to the churchyard at <NAME> .
At this the two innocents , with their brains in that apparent danger , laughed , and <NAME> laughed , and the orphan laughed , and then the visitors laughed .

They always praised the child , her sense and beauty , and he was proud to hear them !
' <NAME> and submissively , ' returned the tragedian , scowling upwards .
Slouching at his side with his eyes upon the towing-path , <NAME> held his left hand open , with a certain slight drawing action towards himself .
' Naturally , <NAME> , you know. ' ' Oh-h ! ' said <NAME> , with a severely unconvinced look .
Confine yourself to yours , and ask me no question. ' ' By <NAME> , ma ' am ! ' he replied , making her another bow .
I acquiesced , of course , knowing nothing to the contrary .
You don ' t know what my state of mind towards you is .
" Lift him , and come away ! " The door closed , and <NAME> was left alone .
It rushed away where it would , but it never , for an instant , lost itself in sleep .
All that I know is , your philosophy and your teaching will not save me .
' My master , sir , is a very artful man. ' ' I know he is , ' said <NAME> .
'It must have been something , love , ' urged <NAME> .
<NAME> made no reply , but played a little quicker , as though the words had roused her from some painful thoughts .

' There ' s where she sits , you see , ' said <NAME> , when they were standing under the bank , roared and riven at by the wind .
Whenever I fell into a thoughtful state , this subject was sure to present itself , and all my uneasiness was sure to be redoubled .
said he with his bright clear eyes on mine .
' You have much too open and generous a countenance for that. ' ' What an extraordinary observer you are ! ' said <NAME> .
I can not rest until I know that we are not too late .
says <NAME> , transferring his cross-examination .
' Of course you do , ' retorted the dwarf , viciously snapping at his words .
It ' s his system. ' ' Formed his daughter on his own model ? ' suggested <NAME> .
But then , you see , you 're broad in proportion and do n't look it .
' Amen to that , ' replied <NAME> , ' and a fat and happy liven ' they ' d get out of it !
Apart from any inclinations of my own , I understood <NAME> 's hint now .
She closed the window again , and sitting down upon the bed , thought of the life that was before them .
The Captain never lost dignity , from having his ears boxed with the <NAME> .
" Whew ! " the chemist whistled softly , as he read it .
As if I were never to have done with <NAME> , I am reminded here of <NAME> and old <NAME> .
' Always at home. ' This would seem to be secretly agreeable to <NAME> , but he veils his feelings , and observes , ' Strange .
I am not speaking to you politely ; but , as you are aware , I am _not_ polite .
' She will try to do well , ' said little Em ' ly .
<NAME> , was that you calling me ?
' -- that I will make no pretence of concealment .
' But I doubt if he could tell many people even their past or present fortunes. ' ' Couldn ' t have told the <NAME> hers ? ' said <NAME> .
I could hardly make them quarrel with me .
The second , that her brother had not made an effort .
said the undertaker : raising the candle above his head , to get a better view of <NAME> .
But there was no confusion or disorder .
' He and she ? ' ' What , Mr and <NAME> ? ' said <NAME> .
Very few loose papers are about .
On the next day , fresh search was made , and the inquiries renewed ; but with no better success .
<NAME> <NAME> ' s first procedure was to shake Mrs. Sparsit off , and leave her to progress as she might through various stages of suffering on the floor .

The ironmaster repeats her expression with a little emphasis .
He swallowed a glassful and took up the paper again .
They would have scorned the action .
' This will soon be over now , dear Mr Clennam .
To be sure , how the neighbourhood poured into court that afternoon while the cause was on !
Another knock , and still no answer .

Allow me to catch you round the neck .
This position I continued to occupy during the whole interview , and from it I now saw <NAME> and <NAME> enter the room .
The schoolmeasther agin all <NAME> .
I knew his voice very well .
But <NAME> said she was , and she said it decisively .
Nod away at him , <NAME> ; that 's what he likes .
" My own doing , " said <NAME> .
Wipe your eyes with the cuffs of your jacket , and do n't cry into your gruel ; that 's a very foolish action , <NAME> . '
You can come at night .
It was unnecessary caution surely , and might have defeated itself .
The deficient buttons on his plaid frock had evidently been supplied from one of <NAME> 's coats , they were so extremely brazen and so much too large .
<NAME> C. desires to be near his professional adviser , and I am far from objecting , for I court inquiry . "

' What will you do ? ' she asked him .
But all is over with me on earth , and this must be an Angel .
All is for her sake .
He found a pleasure in setting up <NAME> as the type of elegance , and making him a satire upon others who piqued themselves on personal graces .
And <NAME> , " said <NAME> , " and his wild brother , <NAME> ; there they go !
I know my cue ; smart is the word .
A few faces hurried to glowing windows and looked after us , but none came out .
He has no idea of the value of money .
The simple circumstance of being left alone with her husband and <NAME> , was sufficient to stun this admirable lady again without collision between herself and any other fact .
We never make company of you .
In the miserable night he thought of it ; in the dreary day , the wretched dawn , the ghostly , memory-haunted twilight .
' The usual thing ! ' observed <NAME> .
' You won ' t run so gaily to your old shabby home , my girl .
But he was sleeping soundly , and she softly withdrew .
'What the devil made you stand lingering there , in the wet ? '
' I hope they may become so , ' replied <NAME> .
He made quite a sister of me .
This wretched life , my love , of daily labour and fatigue , is more than you can bear , I am sure it is .
<NAME> farewells were exchanged , and the party separated .
I had often passed it before , during my residence in that neighbourhood , though never when I could choose another road .
It was very extraordinary that she should come , under such circumstances. ' Not feeling quite so sure of that , <NAME> thought it best to hold his peace .
I have often thought , since , what an odd , innocent , out-of-the-way kind of wedding it must have been !
The lady happened to bend forward at the same time , and my uncle thought she looked more beautiful than she had done yet .
" It would be useless self-distress and torment to reckon up such chances and possibilities .
You know what I mean as well as any man . "
He then gravely repaired to another table , where his sister sat herself at her desk .
I am sure you would ! ' said <NAME> .
" It was a great change from <NAME> Swosser to Professor Dingo , " she resumed with a plaintive smile .
There is a tie of many suffering years between us two , and it is the only tie I ever had on earth that <NAME> has not broken ! "
' Now , <NAME> , ' says the Major , ' I am a man of the world .
' Have you anything to tell me ? ' ' To tell you , lady lass ! ' replied the <NAME> , meeting her eyes in confusion .
' Well , and how are you my buck ? ' said Mr Chuckster , taking a stool .
<NAME> <NAME> , however , was announced as a lesser star , yet visible above the office horizon .
I lost everything , and had a sharp struggle for my life , weak as I was. ' ' Did you get the parties punished ? ' asked <NAME> .
<NAME> was there , and in full force .
' Ho ! ' Horses plunge , and splash the black driver .
Also , the spoon is not generally used over-hand , but under .
I have told her so .
Speak. ' ' Why , if you will have it , miss , it ' s this , ' said the servant girl .
He is going towards the door with a candle in his hand when a knock comes .
The quarters of our soldiers at <NAME> , are finely and airily situated .
'Pop that shawl away in my castor , <NAME> , so that I may know where to find it when I cut ; that 's the time of day !
And <NAME> , M.P. , how are things going on down at the house , and when will you turn out those terrible people for us ?
' This , at least , is the light , my dear <NAME> , ' pursued Mrs. Micawber , ' in which I view the subject .
I will hear no more of the very genteel lady ; I will hear no more of you .

At last I find it .
' Never in my life , ' replied the cobbler .

The greater the accumulation of deceit and trouble in the world , the brighter and the purer shone the star of <NAME> high above the world .
At the garden-gate of one of these he stopped , and <NAME> alighted .
" You 're a friend in need .
think of all I have given up , only this one night , for you .
Where ' s your more than mother ?
We sat in the dark for some time , breathless .
Who knows that better than I do ? ' ' Nothing will turn me from it , <NAME> , when I have justified it to myself .
And how shows this recreant conduct in a man on whom unequal laws are known to have fallen heavy ?

Does the thought-contracted brow of the local Sage or the lustrous eye of local Beauty inquire whose fortunes ?
Shall I tell them to go away ? ' ' No , ' said <NAME> , rising .
I have never been in the way of learning compliments myself , and I don ' t profess to understand the art of paying ' em .

Show what clothes you have brought , and what money , and say that I will send some more money .
<NAME> <NAME> Jasper. ' ' Has he a calling , good gentleman ? ' ' Calling ?
The sound was too much for Mr Mantalini .
" I tell you , " said <NAME> , " that you buried paving-stones and earth in that there coffin .
' This is a pollis case , is it ?
It gave you the face-ache to look at his apples , the stomach-ache to look at his oranges , the tooth-ache to look at his nuts .
For who else would dig , and delve , and drudge , and do domestic work , and make canals and roads , and execute great lines of <NAME> !
" Oh , <NAME> , you would never guess ! "
It ' s no use my lagging on so far behind it .
To which Mrs <NAME> added , taking thought for him , like the championing little wife she was ; ' Oh yes , detained at the last moment .
To whom <NAME> made his obeisance , closing the door and standing near it , with his hat in his hand .
My uncle woke , rubbed his eyes , and jumped up in astonishment .
I should rather think I did .
" Indeed I am , my Lady .
After some helpless casting about , <NAME> brightened and began again : -- " He is dressed like a 'spectable pieman .
How CAN you ask such goose ' s questions ? ' ' Do you regret anything , my love ? ' ' <NAME> anything ?
<NAME> haste down , and come out .
We began badly , and went on worse .
I took the indentures out of his hand and gave them to <NAME> .
I went forth last night on compulsion , and I learnt a lesson which is working now .
The <NAME> sat in his study chair , covering his face with his hands .
We proceeded without a word being spoken .
I never see such a chap to eat and drink -- never .
" Yes , there ! " " Where is he ? " He crammed what little food was left , into the breast of his gray jacket .
' Well then , ' replied <NAME> , ' I ' m satisfied .
He was dressed in a smartly-cut snuff-coloured coat , with large brass buttons ; an orange neckerchief ; a coarse , staring , shawl-pattern waistcoat ; and drab breeches .
' By <NAME> , you are right , <NAME> .
Will you mind it , if I say something very , very silly ? -- -more than usual ? ' inquired <NAME> , peeping over my shoulder into my face .
" When she went from here , she went right away nor'ard by the high road .
<NAME> blood , hot blood. ' And the little man took a warning pinch , and shook his head doubtfully .
The girl drew closer to the table , and made no offer to leave the room , although she could see that <NAME> was pointing to her .
' I would rather not ask , but the question is imposed upon me .
I put such questions to <NAME> as , When did the man come in ?
All men are not gifted alike .
' No , indeed , ' returned his daughter .
' Who is it ? ' asked <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> looked serious instantly .
<NAME> will be a ugly customer to you , if you do n't .
That 's all I know , ' said <NAME> .
' -- K. then positively refused to sign .
' No , sir , ' said Mr Meagles , shaking his head ruefully .
No ; sight more unwonted still -- there is a butterfly in the square -- a real , live butterfly !
If not today , why then tomorrow. ' ' And <NAME> ? ' said <NAME> and I , both together .
' And yet you took it very much to heart , ' said <NAME> .
" It is fifty years old . "
He has taken the matter so much to heart that he has remonstrated ( in my presence he remonstrated ) with Mr <NAME> , if that be the name .
'No , ' replied <NAME> ; 'at least , as it 's a nasty business , we think you ought to take something less than the premium we offered . '
You ought to see it out , and I won ' t leave you .
<NAME> <NAME> alone could enter into my feelings thoroughly .
<NAME> ! ' exclaimed the old lady , starting .
When I looked round , I could see the other lights coming in after us .
It was -- what lasting reason have I to remember it ! -- a cold , harsh , winter day .
It shall and must be spoken .
' Ah ! ' replied <NAME> , with another groan ; this time not even disguised by a wheeze .
she said on a sudden .
The Secretary lost no time in getting to work , and his vigilance and method soon set their mark on the <NAME> ' s affairs .
It would be a poor thing to gratify a prejudice against him .

' Pray , go on , sir -- disgraceful and rascally proceedings , I think you said ? ' ' I did , ' said <NAME> , thoroughly roused .
As they turned back , <NAME> ' s eye fell upon a small broken stone , partially buried in the ground , in front of a cottage door .
A <NAME> ( assisted by a <NAME> ) married the happy pair , and it behoved <NAME> himself to conduct <NAME> to breakfast .
Mr and <NAME> ' s house in <NAME> , <NAME> , was but a temporary residence .
I am glad to think I have been the instrument of good to <NAME> , and that I may be more so .
I half expect the real master to come home presently , and say he is glad to see me .
" What is to be done with you ?
You know Lagnier , the gentleman .
You are to understand that his second visit to <NAME> was for his own pleasure .
This sound being taken up by the <NAME> , swelled into a rapturous trio which gave general satisfaction .
" My friend in the city , <NAME> , has done a little business with a pupil of yours . "
" I beg your pardon , grandmother .
He is a child -- an absolute child .
My guardian asked him what he meant .
I wish you good night , sir. ' He comprehended everybody present , in the respectful bow with which he followed these words , and disappeared .
' I give you joy , Mr Toots ! ' says old Sol .
Unnatural emotion in a child , innocent of wrong !
<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> divide the dignity of the office .
I was at that time in our <NAME> <NAME> , and had been -- oh !
A considerable scuffling within ensued , but nothing else .
' My sweetest Edith ! ' cries an agitated voice upon the stairs .
Its deep fidelity and goodness were not to be adorned by me or any man .
" I want five hundred pound . "
' Is there room for me ? ' said I .
I see you are going back to it , ' returned <NAME> , wondering why .
Ally Loo ! ' Horses almost do it .
I am a honest man , that ' s what I am .
Can I be so weak as to imagine that <NAME> , wielding the rod of talent and of power in <NAME> , will be nothing in <NAME> ?
' <NAME> is your ward ? ' asked <NAME> , after a time , in a faint , fatigued voice .
<NAME> would bring Emily at the usual hour .
' It is but one room you see .
' Coketown , sir , ' said <NAME> , obstinately taking a chair , ' is not the kind of place you have been accustomed to .
By the powerful old gentleman ' s aid , even a hackney-coach gets over half a mile of ground .
' You know I have had losses , and am poorer than I used to be .
<NAME> given to detail are the beggars who make sporting ventures .
I should require to be crammed , sir. ' ' I beg your pardon , ' interposed <NAME> , doubtful whether he had heard aright .
Here is a glass of mulled wine ready to our hand at the moment ; and I say , 'Uncle <NAME> ! ' "
He never misses a chance in his practice , which is a mark of respectability .

They were close upon our heels ; every man for himself , and each from the gallows !
The two sons grew up as parsimonious as their sire .

We must make amends for this as soon as we can .
He found a likeness to his misfortune everywhere .
You are a credit to the school , and you will be a greater credit to it yet , and they will help you to get a living .
<NAME> ' s letter had gone , <NAME> ' s letter had been delivered .
' I thought our good friend a little changed , and out of spirits , after he came this morning ? ' said <NAME> .
But she never could , and she never did , find a phrase satisfactory to her perhaps-too-favourable estimate of my intellect .

Those who had been kind to them , did not escape his search .
He stops hard by <NAME> and reads a playbill , decides to go to <NAME> 's Theatre .

Behold him in pepper-and-salt pantaloons , with his watch-guard round his neck .
' This is it , ain ' t it ? ' ' Let me look , ' said <NAME> .
' What next ? ' The breakfast table at Mr <NAME> ' s was usually a very pleasant one , and was always presided over by <NAME> .
' Say he dreamt it , ' replied <NAME> coolly .
'Juries , ' said <NAME> , grasping his cane tightly , as was his wont when working into a passion : 'juries is ineddicated , vulgar , grovelling wretches . '
I ' d do more by you than the rest of ' em do , I fancy. ' ' What would you do ? ' he asked .

" You may read it in the whole room .
Remarkable documents , ' added the lawyer , raising his eyes to the ceiling , ' most remarkable documents .
There is a light in each .
'Work'us , ' said <NAME> , 'how 's your mother ? '
Whatever Mrs. <NAME> said , <NAME> repeated to us ; and just as he had drawn Mrs. Jellyby out , he drew Mrs. Pardiggle out .
Not that any one did , for Veneering , M.P. , was always the authority for their being very rich , and perhaps believed it .
It began to rain , heavily , at the moment .
' With <NAME> and his lady , I mean to say , <NAME> , and the young gentleman .
That part of the world is at a safe distance. ' ' Say here , then , ' rejoins the other , rising in a fury .
He was quick enough to observe ; he had a good memory , and did not forget a word of the brother ' s revelations .

He stops there , looks round , and beckons Jo .
" Now , mademoiselle , " repeats <NAME> , making no demonstration except with the finger , " you sit down upon that sofy . "

This was only for a moment ; for <NAME> softly said to him , ' <NAME> !

I pass the greater part of the long vacation here .
I was afraid I had said something shocking .
" You had a child once , whom you loved and lost. " A stronger pressure on my hand .
'You do n't mean to say he died ? '
" I rose in life that way . "
Very , very , strong feelings. ' With a shaking hand , <NAME> took out his handkerchief and wiped his brow .
<NAME> was there , sitting by the bed .
She laughs and talks , and seems to like it .
If I could ever set this right !
His only trouble was , the swift and rapid river .
' What a prophet you have shown yourself , <NAME> ! ' pursued <NAME> .
I saw it move a little more , and a hand softly interpose to keep it open .
It was never so well worth your while to get me out of this country as it is to-night .
It was a strangely unreal ride through the old squalid streets , with a sensation of being raised out of them into an airy world of wealth and grandeur .
When <NAME> was released , you , his old domestic , had the charge of him , I know .
Her visitor watched her as she did so .
" Why is it best , sir ? "
Is it yet coming on ? ' ' Why , no , sir , ' retorted Mr Flintwinch .
Touch him upon money , and you touch no booby then .
It is <NAME> , I think ; is it not ? ' ' Yes , sir , ' returned <NAME> .
<NAME> , I kiss your hand. ' ' We will shake hands , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , extending his , as old <NAME> bowed .
<NAME> , old intriguer ? ' Jeremiah , with his eyes upon his mistress , made no reply .
Let all the lovers get out of the way , and talk among themselves , if they ' ve anything to say .
Therefore I make the entreaty I have now preferred , and I hope you will have sufficient consideration for me to accede to it . "
' I hope so , ' replied the child .
' We understand _that a severe rencontre came off_ a few days since in the <NAME> , between Mr .
' Oh no ! ' ' That ' s well , ' remarked <NAME> .
' Well , <NAME> ! ' said the Major .
It must often happen with miscellaneous ones. ' ' With ribs ( I grant you ) always .
It was with a heavy heart that <NAME> soon afterwards -- no , not retired ; there was no retirement there -- followed -- to his dirty and crowded dormitory .
We want to brisk her up , and brisk her about , and give her a change. ' ' That ' s it ! ' said the open-hearted Mrs Boffin .
' I must admit the wine .
We seem , to me , to have been months over <NAME> , and months more over the other stories .
We will look before we leap , and take plenty of time about it . "
She turned her head as the carriage came up to her , rose quickly , and presented herself at the carriage-door .
' You ' re a young traveller , my child , ' he said , laying his hand gently on her head .
These were additions to the list of entertaining incidents , but there was still another source of interest .
She did not raise her head .
With a part of this , it would be necessary to buy some clothes , for she had none but those she wore .
<NAME> that boy ; he ' s gone to sleep again .
When he was out of employment , I couldn ' t always keep him near me .
I apologise. ' ' Humbly and submissively ? ' said <NAME> .
' You wonder to hear me say that , ' remarked the old woman , shaking her head .
' <NAME> away , dear <NAME> , pray further away. ' ' We must go on , indeed , ' said the child , yielding to his restless wish .
She was absolutely without pity .
" I have n't begun insuring yet , " he replied .
' To-night we three will put up at a <NAME> .
said <NAME> , leading the way back .
' <NAME> ' t it prime ! ' ' This King had a daughter , who was the wisest and most beautiful Princess that ever was seen .
It was not that _he_ looked to them , but that <NAME> looked to them .
The keeper had brought her a chair on which she sat in the middle of the porch between us .
But I shall rally , my dear <NAME> , in the morning ; do not fear for me , or be uneasy on my account .
The last thing I saw was <NAME> ' s unruffled eye ; fraught , as I fancied , with the silent conviction that I was very young indeed .
' I am sure you must be very tired , ' said the mama , turning to <NAME> .
No Other <NAME> is so Favoured as This Country. ' ' And ozer countries ? -- ' the foreign gentleman was beginning , when Mr <NAME> put him right again .
' You don ' t like to hear the name of the cause ? ' said the little man , still busying himself with the knot .
'Not now , for the world , ' replied the young lady .
' Mr Boffin , I happened to be in Chancery Lane this morning , when I saw you going along before me .
But , he was not far off , for presently she heard a troubled movement and a shouting coming along , which filled her with fear .
So should I. I was wrong .
' We are not , ' roared <NAME> , in a tone which , to any dispassionate listener , carried conviction with it .
When the repast was fully discussed , the lion put his hands in his waistband again , and lay down to meditate .
' It ' s prime meat , ' rejoined his lady .
He was Mr Merdle ' s last gift to <NAME> .
<NAME> had been very pale from the moment of his entrance ; but that might have been the effect of her recent illness .
<NAME> <NAME> handed me in and took his own seat on the box .
' This plan , you see , <NAME> , has been gradually introduced into all the prisons for debt , ' said <NAME> .
A <NAME> , when he ' s a good un , is worth his weight in gold .
But yer must know , Work'us , yer mother was a regular right-down bad 'un . '
' That ' s real flesh and blood !
Or paid off -- like a ship 's company .
The scorer not committed , the scored debited with what is against him .
I am bound to say so now .
He would have taken his gaiters off his legs , to give away .
And that is my sensation , " says <NAME> , looking round upon the company , " at the present moment . "
' And the second floor ? ' said <NAME> , on finding the first satisfactory .
' Is your business done , <NAME> ? ' inquired the lady .
I say what I mean .
The poor relations caught the people who they thought would like it , and , when the game flagged , got caught themselves .
' I am the son of a country gentleman , ' returned <NAME> , ' your equal in birth and education , and your superior I trust in everything besides .
Ve-ry happy , I am sure ! "
I have put these considerations to you , my dear Sir , very feebly and imperfectly , but I ask you to think of them .
A pot of beer had appeared from the <NAME> , and they were sharing it by turns in a peaceable manner .
I should have gone to bed with a sore heart indeed under any other roof but that which sheltered little Em ' ly ' s head .
Do not think so poorly of me as to believe that I feign a love I do not feel .
It sent the most insurrectionary tune into the world that was ever composed .
The general opinion among this class of gentlemen was , that it was a weak thing in <NAME> , and he ' d live to repent it .
<NAME> faith in the deception was the first article of his creed .
Does her credit , under the circumstances , in my opinion ! ' She still looked faint and pale .
" And so have I , " cried <NAME> .
I 'll have no feelings here .
It is now inclosed in a gentleman ' s garden .
They ' re true to one another , faithfo ' to one another , ' fectionate to one another , e ' en to death .
Both these heads of information were in a list that <NAME> , while in prison , gave to <NAME> , of the possessions he supposed I should inherit .
<NAME> is quite clear that he had better not .
Perhaps that will be considered an acceptable course of proceeding .
'Yes , sir , rather thirsty , ' answered <NAME> .
This was bad , but not the worst .
Or if it was partly , was it wholly and entirely ?
' You ' ll find it a most amazing stool to sit down upon , you may depend , ' returned Mr Brass .
Thus <NAME> had no sooner swallowed another glassful than he smiled upon all present in happy forgetfulness of having exhibited symptoms of pugnacity , and proposed ' The ladies !
Perhaps we shall change that , ' said Mr Boffin with a threatening roll of his head .
In pursuance of this determination , little Oliver , to his excessive astonishment , was released from bondage , and ordered to put himself into a clean shirt .
Having no reply ready , he could do no better than embrace her .
then this is not my natural manner ? ' she rejoined .
The cry is taken up by a hundred voices , and the crowd accumulate at every turning .
It only wants attending to .
He is called to the bar ; and with admirable industry and self-denial has scraped another hundred pounds together , to fee a Conveyancer whose chambers he attends .
Still the restless mind went , following and counting , ever farther , ever higher , as to the summit of a mighty tower that it took years to climb .
I shall not fail to correspond .
Always Merdle. ' ' Very strange how these runs on an infatuation prevail , ' said <NAME> .
<NAME> said , " Don ' t come back , <NAME> , until you have seen Mr Boffin , and told him all .
' I am for <NAME> tonight .
' <NAME> back here , will you , and let me knock. ' Anything that makes a noise is satisfactory to a crowd .
' I am sorry , ' stammered <NAME> , confused by the strange man 's wild look .
<NAME> was that , <NAME> ? ' ' Yes , <NAME> Dean. ' ' He has stayed late. ' ' Yes , <NAME> .
<NAME> suggested that it was comfortable to know that <NAME> did not mean these destructive sentiments .
One : I remember his changing a small folded paper from one pocket to another , after we came out , which he had not touched before .
His door being shut , she softly opened it and spoke to him , approaching his bed with a noiseless step .
You have no young child ? "
No , <NAME> ! ' shaking his head .
He had a wonderful satisfaction in seeing him , and in commenting on his decayed condition after he was gone .
' Oh , quite enough to get , <NAME> , as the soldier said ven they ordered him three hundred and fifty lashes , ' replied <NAME> .
The meek man supposed he did , but supposed that had absolutely nothing to do with it , if its laws were well administered .
<NAME> will coom then ; and arterwards I ' ll see thee safe t ' thy <NAME> ' lodgin .
' You are very good , ' said <NAME> .
' Tell him I was hearty , and sent my respects .
' I heerd it now , quite apparent , ' resumed <NAME> .
But as this is the <NAME> , gentlemen , where the lights are , I recommend dropping the subject .
We must have our national schools to walk at the head of , and we must have our standing armies .
I have no occasion to relate that I succeeded .
" I presume this is your other ward , <NAME> ? "
' I mean , ' he explained , ' that young ways were never my ways .
<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> were left alone at the desk , in the general departure from the <NAME> .
Let him rot there. ' ' Certainly , sir .
With all that ruin at my feet and about me , it seemed a natural place for me , that day .
How do you suppose you are ever to get through life , if you ' re such a coward as this ?
<NAME> stock got into circulation .
You can ' t put any confidence in him , sir .
However , the permission was given , and was never retracted ; for when the month was out , <NAME> and I were ready to depart .
I ' ll be more communicative with you .
' The speculations of an Angular man , ' resumed <NAME> , still sitting and speaking exactly as before , ' are probably erroneous on so globular a topic .
<NAME> ' t that make a difference , <NAME> ?
And what do we live for but sympathy !
' See that the boiler ' s full .
All their worldly goods are a bag , a large chest and an old chair : one , old , high-backed , rush-bottomed chair : a solitary settler in itself .
' More care ! ' said the old man in a shrill voice , ' more care of Nelly !
There is no despotism here ; that ' s the great thing .
Take my word , it ' s nothing whatever .
cried the old gentleman , bursting out with the rage he had kept down so long , 'd -- n me !
" I 'm not a going back .
<NAME> <NAME> sat silent for some minutes , and then , turning round to the prosecutor , said in a towering passion .
I have seen it many times since then , by sunlight and by moonlight , but never free from the impressions of that journey .
As I recall our being opposed thus , face to face , I seem again to hear my heart beat fast and high .
Who was this , do you think ? ' ' Why do you ask me ? ' repeated <NAME> .
What are these suckers of cigars and swallowers of strong drinks , whose hats and legs we see in every possible variety of twist , doing , but amusing themselves ?
What if I were to turn too ?
' Little Kate <NAME> ' were the words that caught his ear .
' If you please , ' said she .
Mrs. Rouncewell might have been sufficiently assured by hearing the rain , but that she is rather deaf , which nothing will induce her to believe .
' Dear me ! ' said Mr <NAME> , ' you too !
All this time , the ringing at the bell was constantly renewed , and those without were beating at the door .
' You are better ? ' said the child , stopping to speak with him .
' She is a very charming girl , but she has a great deal of feeling .
You have stood of your own strength ever since .
In every little chamber that I entered , and at every grate through which I looked , I seemed to see the same appalling countenance .
" You girls are more trouble than you 're worth , by half . "
'That 's for your people , ' said the guard .
' Dear me ! ' said <NAME> .
<NAME> , your mother took this course with you .
There was nobody at the chambers but <NAME> .
' You just come away , ' said <NAME> .
You will please to answer no , it is not enough. ' ' A moment ! ' cried <NAME> , interposing , ' permit me !
Consequently you 're very far from wanting to give trouble .
<NAME> <NAME> is wild with joy , and my aunt remits me a guinea by the next post .
' What <NAME> was that , <NAME> ? ' ' Lor !
Mrs. Jellyby , sitting in quite a nest of waste paper , drank coffee all the evening and dictated at intervals to her eldest daughter .
Pausing from his work , he leant on his spade , and put his hand to his dull ear .
' Be mine , be mine ! ' cried the old gentleman .
Which is the man ? " " Here is the man , " said <NAME> .
' I called to ask this morning. ' ' Thank you very much ! ' the pleasant voice of <NAME> would reply .
The day changes as it wears itself away and becomes dark and drizzly .
Y. -- but really this was too bad !
Then the Major called at Mr <NAME> ' s house in town ; and came down again , in the same coach as Mr Dombey .
' Thank you , ' he returned , with fervour .
A fair profit is , of course , allowable . '
He is , I say again without disguise , a low mercenary wretch .
At least , Mr <NAME> seemed perfectly satisfied when he descried them on board .
' I have saved him , ' she thought .
According to your own account I ' m not worth much , ' Wegg reasons persuasively .
' You will not be long dressing , <NAME> , I presume ? ' said Mr Dombey .
The scamp has been obliged to fly , as I learn , for some knavery , and has found his way abroad .
' That ' s the witness-box , I suppose ? ' said <NAME> , pointing to a kind of pulpit , with a brass rail , on his left hand .
Con-fined , as the lady said. ' ' A prisoner ! ' exclaimed <NAME> , with unaccountable vehemence .
" Only a matter of form , miss , " returned the young gentleman .
'Meat , ma'am , meat , ' replied <NAME> , with stern emphasis .
<NAME> on my left ! "
Taking the bread under his arm , the young gentlman turned into a small public-house , and led the way to a tap-room in the rear of the premises .
If this young lord does dog your footsteps , and whisper his drivelling inanities in your ears , what of it ?
" Yet , you silly little thing !
He left here , ' said <NAME> , ' with his mother , who had been clamouring , and beseeching , and disclosing , the whole time .
' Good morning , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> ; very coldly .
But , the comfort was , that all the company at the grand hotel of <NAME> were perfectly dressed .
I pity you , and I despise you ! "
<NAME> <NAME> is mightily curious in respect of the room .
It was within half an hour or so of the time of closing .
The seconds retired , the gentleman on the camp-stool did the same , and the belligerents approached each other .
You know M. R. F. , but not as well as I do .
They are met at the very threshold with this mild appeal .
Let them rest though ; they ' re better gone. ' ' Much better , dear , ' replied the child .
But it can ' t be helped now ; it ' s too late to help it now .
' I do as I am bidden by my principal .
I fear not , my dear <NAME> ; they are too clever for that , I doubt .
I stopped , and he came up breathless .
How much have I to be thankful for , in that !
As he stood there , waiting his arrival , the knocker caught his eye .
The dying ashes have no light to spare , and his endeavours are vain .
' That trying climate ! -- like living , they tell me , on a sand-heap , underneath a burning-glass !
On his head , he wore a broad-brimmed sugar-loaf hat , garnished with a single feather .
' He has only just come home .
Why did you who read this , commit that not dissimilar inconsistency of your own last year , last month , last week ?
It was his way in business , often .
Is there anything ? ' ' Nothing , ' she replied .
' He ' s not much used to ladies ' society , and it makes him bashful .
( <NAME> apparently suggested by his eye lighting on Mrs. Smallweed in her slumber . )
My poor , affectionate , failing Frederick !
He is very regular in his walks , is my son .
You 're my son , -- more to me nor any son .
Six nights passed -- six long weary nights -- and on each , <NAME> came home with a disappointed face , and briefly intimated that it was not yet time .
' Lord bless my soul , <NAME> ! ' cried <NAME> , laughing again , ' what a mad fellow you are !
Swiftly now , indeed , the time flew by until it was the evening before the day appointed for the marriage .
When they passed a prison of the State , they kept far from its frowning walls , and looked up at its bars , and spoke in whispers .
' How weak am I , ' said <NAME> , when he was gone , ' that I could shed tears at this reception !
There was another thing the woman did .
Most people are when they ' ve little to do and less to get .
said the young man , eagerly .
It may turn even means as unexpected and unpromising as these , to account .
' What do you mean to do ?
The ironmaster , repressing his amused smile , assents .
<NAME> and <NAME> would have turned this wall in another instant ; but , stopping so short , stand behind it .
She was alone all day , for , after an early breakfast her husband repaired every morning to the <NAME> , and did not return until their late dinner hour .
<NAME> <NAME> sat observing it , with such suppressed approval as was to be desired in the leader of the <NAME> women .
I am perfectly honest and outspoken .
<NAME> not yet a while !
' Would you believe it ! ' he said .
You _mutht_ have uth , <NAME> .
and <NAME> , <NAME> agean , ' replied the Yorkshireman .
I had the honour of knowing him there .
What the two drank together , between <NAME> and <NAME> , might have floated a king 's ship .
Because he ' s got it here. ' The lecturer held up the tightly clenched right hand .
I did something -- bowed , I suppose -- and was all attention , when the other sister struck in .
They had no depth or change ; they glittered , and they opened and shut .
' I have spoken of him as still living , ' she added , ' but he may have been put out of the way for anything I know .
Upon a shelf in an open cupboard were a plate or two , a cup or two , and so forth , but all dry and empty .
' Grazing , ' said <NAME> , raising his voice , under the impression that as <NAME> failed to comprehend him , he must be deaf .
What if he went abroad , and his mother or <NAME> were to die the while ?
" Well ! " she cried , picking up the pocket-handkerchief , " if that do n't make seven times !
There is terror in the carriage , there is weeping , there is the heavy breathing of the insensible traveller .
" This is Mam'selle ! " said he .
This quarter passed , they came upon the haunts of commerce and great traffic , where many people were resorting , and business was already rife .
I ask you -- for information -- what does that mean ?
' With me , sir ? ' retorted <NAME> , eyeing him in disdainful surprise .
<NAME> <NAME> bowed , to intimate that he was .
' But , ' resumes <NAME> , ' I am accountable for mentioning it to you .
' Where is she ! ' cried this lady .
' A long time , ' said I .
Do you know me ? " " Yes , I know you , <NAME> Doctor. " " We all know you , <NAME> , " said the other three .
Better employed than to attend to it , ' said Mr Boffin .
" I believe so , your ladyship . "
The great grindstone , <NAME> , had turned when <NAME> looked out again , and the sun was red on the courtyard .
I was born with a caul , which was advertised for sale , in the newspapers , at the low price of fifteen guineas .
She has had her right arm broke. ' ' Ran away , my negro man , <NAME> .
Oliver roused himself , and made his best obeisance .
He went in and went out in an unaccountable way , like a man without an object .
' Thank you , ' <NAME> , dear , ' retorted <NAME> , majestically .
" I leave you to judge now !
'Do n't speak to me ; it 's not safe .
The drafts of Mr Dorrit almost constituted a run on the <NAME> .
The penitential den once set apart for interviews with the <NAME> , was now the news-Exchange , and was filled to overflowing .
This behaviour was not lost upon <NAME> .
If you want a subject , look at <NAME> ! " " True , sir .
I thought they were with me .
<NAME> scarcely had come out , when <NAME> came out .
Oh dem ! ' ' What DO you want , man ? ' demanded <NAME> , sternly .
' I adore her memory on the assumption .
I wanted somebody to talk to , then .
' Never -- perform -- business ! ' ' Very well , sir , ' said <NAME> , darting a withering look at the culprit .
The heat is greater ; my Lady screens her face .
" In fact , that is our family department , " said <NAME> , " in this hurly-burly of life .
' It will afford me the greatest pleasure to know you , sir , ' replied <NAME> .
<NAME> must look into this , <NAME> .
What do you look at me for ? ' <NAME> promptly resumed his letter , glad to revert to a performance with which he was so highly satisfied .
' Indeed , indeed he does ! ' cried <NAME> , ' as dearly as I love him .
We shall be married from the <NAME> ' lodgings , and shall be delighted to see you -- either before church or at breakfast-time , which you like .
" I have known <NAME> and his daughter , in England. " " Yes ? " said <NAME> .
He is a broad-faced , bull-necked , young butcher , with rough red cheeks , an ill-conditioned mind , and an injurious tongue .
' None of your nonsense with me , ' said Mr Flintwinch .
' He sleeps , ' murmured the spinster aunt .
Yet , I go there a mortal sight of times in the course of the year , taking one day with another . "
His avaricious manner of collecting all the eatables about him , and devouring some with his eyes while devouring others with his jaws , was the same manner .
' Not goodest good , because you hesitate about it .
Among civilians I am what they call in <NAME> a ne'er-do-weel .
Keep ye or do ye or you keep always at it .
' What is the matter here ? ' said <NAME> , pressing forward .
They were in what is called a good position , and visited , and were visited by , numbers of people .
" She was up and down with <NAME> all the evening .
It was the last day of the year .
' Ay , ay , ' said <NAME> .
" I ca n't help my looks , " says Mrs. Snagsby , " and if I could I would n't . "
There must be some mistake between us .
He tried a glass of grog ; but melancholy truth was at the bottom of that well , and he couldn ' t finish it .
' Why of <NAME> , <NAME> ? ' asked her father .
" What shall I do , what shall I do !
The travellers ' room at the <NAME> is of course uncomfortable ; it would be no travellers ' room if it were not .
The only perjury is <NAME> ' s , and I fancy he is pretty well used to it .
' A very fine evening , Mr Headstone , ' said <NAME> .
' I suppose you won ' t run away meanwhile , eh ?
When morning came , Mrs. Maylie 's predictions were but too well verified .
I thought she would have spoken to me privately if she had dared .
He was not able to work , but one day there was a grave to be made , and he came to overlook the man who dug it .
<NAME> <NAME> had not moved from the spot where she stood when <NAME> first became aware of her ; but , she now advanced one step .
You may judge with what devotion he who lost that mother almost in the winning , clung to this girl , her breathing image .
" Is there a peculiar flavour in what you sprinkle from your torch ? "
' I never dreamt such a real cough as that before .
He wouldn ' t , wouldn ' t he ? ' said <NAME> .
" I should like a little variety , " said <NAME> ; " I mean a good range of experience . "
'It was only my caution , nothing more .
' No , ' said <NAME> , looking vacantly at him .
' Any room , sir ? ' cries the new passenger to the coachman .
" You must be here very seldom , sir , " said I .
I said it lightly , because I felt her trembling .
In that formation process of hers , she dipped the smallest of brushes into the largest of pots , and varnished the surface of every object that came under consideration .
I could hardly help meeting certain people walking together here , and that could do no good , and is certainly not the way to forget .
And in his last look as we drove away , I saw that he was very sorry for me .
' What ' s the matter ? ' screamed the ladies .
Whatever the motive , you want the best ? ' My aunt nodded assent .
what would the <NAME> say !
He is perfectly quiet and comfortable now .
" Well ! " said <NAME> , " that 's over !
( But he shook his head aside at us , evidently sensible of the tendency of the late occurrences to recall the memory of the old one . )
Tumbled together on the table are some pieces of iron , purposely broken to be tested at various periods of their service , in various capacities .
Still , she is more than contented and does all she has to do with all her heart .
But <NAME> was a composed man , who performed neither on his own trumpet , nor on the trumpets of other people .
' You have not thought about it ! ' sneered the invalid .
' May I come in ? ' said <NAME> , peeping .
I had him into my room .
' Who is that ? ' said the Doctor .
I felt as if it came close and near to me .
I never crossed the river again ; for I knew there were people on the other shore , and in such a place it is natural to shun strange company .
That is the fault of my position -- not of myself , <NAME> .
There ' s more than one sweet creetur in the world ! ' ' Not to me , <NAME> , ' replied Mr Toots gravely .
They asked me what my story was , and I told them .
' Ask him to step here. ' ' Yes , sir. ' Exit <NAME> .
Was I ever once dishonest when I was poor and hungry , and is it likely I would begin now !
The opened half-door was opened a little further , and secured at that angle for the time .
You wo n't want to spend it .
The idea did not originate in my own discernment , I am bound to confess , but in a speech of <NAME> ' s .
' <NAME> me what you mean .
No garret , no shoemaking , no One Hundred and <NAME> , <NAME> , now !
There ' s beds here , sir , ' said <NAME> , addressing his master , ' everything clean and comfortable .
If I live , I saw my husband in a carriage in the street to-night ! ' ' Strumpet , it ' s false ! ' cried <NAME> .
" We will stand by him , as he himself stood by the two poor creatures who are gone . "
And yet I am very much of the opinion , my dears , that he has not chosen his profession advisedly . "
This person has taken out MY certificate .
' Old lady , ' said Mr Boffin , anticipating his wife , ' you hold your tongue .
But it ' s natural and rational that you should like it .
' However , time ' s up for to-night , ' said Mr Boffin , waving his hand after a silence .
He affected a stiff white cravat , after the example of his principal , and was always closely buttoned up and tightly dressed .
All I thay ith , the <NAME> hath thtood by <NAME> , and I ' ll thtand by the <NAME> .
But we must be careful -- for our cousin 's sake , <NAME> , for our cousin 's sake -- that we make no more such mistakes .
The receding footsteps of the speaker were heard ; and , in another minute , the form of <NAME> , otherwise the <NAME> , appeared .
' I am sure I am not like myself when I am away , ' said I .
What could I ever do but thank him !
' Now here ' s an aggravating animal ! ' ' Well , what harm do they do ? ' retorted <NAME> .
But before I leave <NAME> , I must advert to one disgusting circumstance which can hardly have escaped the observation of any decent traveller who has visited the Falls .
" Close them again. " That was done too , and the <NAME> went on with his supper .
The man never trod ground whose virtues and services would have sustained him in that place that day , against such denunciation .
' Then , what the devil did you run sharp instruments into <NAME> ' s legs for ? ' inquired <NAME> angrily .
' Some say he frightened you , but <NAME> ' S a lie , I know .
' Where is <NAME> ? ' said Mrs. Leo Hunter , as she placed the aforesaid lions around her .
' We go upon the practical mode of teaching , <NAME> ; the regular education system .
' Who else is a-goin ' , lovey ? ' said Mrs. Cluppins , in an insinuating manner .
' <NAME> , ' said Mrs. Pott , in a soft voice .
A son will sometimes make it known to his father that he has fallen in love , say , with a young woman in the factory .
They reached the spot where the bereaved husband stood : and stopped .
Because they state the fact .
I require no reference from you , and perhaps , therefore , you will require none from me .

The <NAME> , husband and wife , The <NAME> , and <NAME> , were in the first press , and at no great distance from him in the <NAME> .

But it was certainly the case .
And was there no one nearer and dearer than <NAME> , to uphold the striving heart in its anguish ?
I wonder what ' s that for ? ' ' ' Cos they has a mortal awersion to washing anythin ' , I suppose , <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> .

Well , I -- ' ' No , nor anybody else , ' said <NAME> , anticipating the rest .

' And now , ' said <NAME> , when a heart-rending scene had ensued and the children were cleared away again , ' give me some supper .
That was _my_ last Christmas Eve. ' ' What do you mean ? ' is the very abrupt , and , one might say , fierce retort .

He should be attended to , and looked after. ' ' A companion ?
You know <NAME> , sir ?
'This is all , is it ? '
That ' s easy to see. ' It would have been so cruel if he had meant it , that <NAME> firmly resolved to believe he did not mean it .
I only put it to you . "
He reddened deeply , as if his natural generosity felt a pang of reproach .

' <NAME> well , my love , ' replied <NAME> .
I proceed to other passages of my narrative .
They took another quart apiece to drink each other ' s health in , and were staunch friends ever afterwards .

She petted them , as I may say , and made the most of them .
" Mat , " said <NAME> , " you have heard pretty well all I have been saying to this lady and these two gentlemen .

' Never you mind , ' retorted that gentleman , tapping his nose derisively .
" Are the <NAME> down here , <NAME> ? "
I ' ll beg it of her with kisses , ' said <NAME> .

Mrs Pipchin almost laughs as the fly-van drives off , and she composes her black bombazeen skirts , and settles herself among the cushions of her easy chair .

" Yes , " said <NAME> , " well enough .
I hope <NAME> will excuse its painful nature . "
<NAME> was afraid to look at either her or the man .
Better than some real ones. ' ' Never fret about them , <NAME> , ' she answered quickly , and not without an anxious glance at his face .

Of coming down into a harbour when the tide was at its full , and seeing fishing-boats float on , and glad women and children waiting for them .
' For <NAME> ' s sake , ' cried <NAME> , ' don ' t do that !
Since the time of her leaving home , <NAME> had lived with the rest of the family on equal terms .
The noise and motion in the streets fatigued his brain at first , but he was not surprised , or curious , or pleased , or irritated .
Having bestowed a scowl upon the object of this warning , to increase its effect , <NAME> continued .
' Her writing ! ' said <NAME> .
It sheared off heads so many , that it , and the ground it most polluted , were a rotten red .
Do you know , <NAME> , I almost wonder that <NAME> never turned your thoughts to <NAME> . "
' In with it , Christopher. ' ' All right , <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> .
<NAME> tried to speak , but her tears prevented her .
'Yes , I am , ' replied the old gentleman ; 'but I am not sure that this boy actually took the handkerchief .
Little <NAME> ' s. ' So always as he sat alone in the faded chair , thinking .
I suffer for <NAME> , <NAME> .
I do n't know that it 's of any direct use my doing so , but it 's all I can do , and I do it thoroughly .
I study and get up abstruse No Thoroughfares in the course of the day .
Oh , where was <NAME> !
I 'll tell you what , though ; my lodger is so black-humoured and gloomy that I believe he 'd as soon make that bargain as any other .
Nor do I recollect its subject .
only don ' t expect me to stand between your mother and you , <NAME> .
<NAME> , dear , make me poor again and take me home !
There was , and is when I write , at the end of that low-lying street , a dilapidated little wooden building , probably an obsolete old ferry-house .
No light feet had pressed it for many , many a day .
' I don ' t know what I am to do. ' ' Don ' t be alarmed , ' said I .
' I never saw so beautiful a face .
Where ' s that rough total , Mr Rugg ?
" Well ! " she went on ; " you have a promising career before you .
We have reason to know by this time that there is no good in it and no hope , that there is nothing to be got from it but sorrow .
" Ca n't be a lawyer , then , " says <NAME> , folding his arms with an air of confirmed resolution .
' If it hadn ' t been for me , I don ' t know what would have become of him. ' What strange creatures we are !
Now move on here , come ! "
Then it flashes upon him .
He re-entered the shed , and shrunk down once more .
I turned him hastily on some pretence , and held him in conversation until it was gone .
' Patience , ' she croaked , laying her hand , like a claw , upon his arm .
' Indeed I am not going to be , my darling ! ' I assured her .
I ' m none the worse for that , am I ? ' ' Not a bit , ' replied <NAME> .
Nothing of this appeared , however .
If you will hear me through a very little more , all you can ever do for me is done .
And <NAME> again relates his experience , again suppressing the half-crown fact .
" In making some alterations , the workmen came upon an old dungeon , which had been , for many years , built up and forgotten .
<NAME> me. ' ' It ' s quite accidental , ' replied <NAME> , greatly perplexed by the curious and unexpected nature of the interview .
As he spoke , he seated himself at the other end of the table , and , throwing off his cloak and cap , disclosed his features .
It was clothed in one simple green robe , or mantle , bordered with white fur .
I owe that to you .
Nor were these the only tokens of dispersal .
And I am bound to bear in mind that I took <NAME> on , at a time when I had no thought of being fashionable or of leaving the Bower .
You must consider yourself in custody , <NAME> . "
<NAME> some of the boys had seen me coming through <NAME> , wayworn and ragged , and should find me out ?
A certain leanness falls upon houses not sufficiently imbued with life ( as if they were nourished upon it ) , which was very noticeable here .
But I may ask you two questions , may I ? '
Mrs <NAME> had been drafted home to the house in town , and <NAME> , now a smart young woman , had come down .

" He 's in the dining-room , sir , along with mistress .
Comes <NAME> with his large keys , and yawningly unlocks and sets open .
I believe that I began to know that there was something about my aunt , notwithstanding her many eccentricities and odd humours , to be honoured and trusted in .
' How are , you , my lad ? ' replied the <NAME> .
Even cousins may be sorry to part ; and in truth I am very , very sorry , <NAME> , though I know it 's for your welfare .
' I think I do , ' said the gentleman , breaking silence .
Struggles , <NAME> and <NAME> , were , each in his turn , the subject of unqualified eulogium ; and each in due course returned thanks for the honour .
What business was it of old <NAME> ' s more than anybody else ' s ?
That 's the kind of thing for _you_ .
So much the better for you .
You shall go. ' ' I ! ' returned the other .
' How ! ' exclaimed <NAME> , with sublime severity .
Few ways of life were hidden from <NAME> , and he was oftener in its darkest places than even <NAME> .
Both were bleeding and panting and execrating and struggling ; but of course I knew them both directly .
' What do you wish ? ' ' <NAME> ? ' hesitated Mr Dombey .
' I can see your features , godmother , behind the beard. ' ' Does the fancy go to my changing other objects too , <NAME> ? ' ' Ah !
' Wy don ' t you ? ' said <NAME> , urging his question strenuously .
His face was as fiery as ever ; his eyes were as small , and rather deeper set .
He makes it too secure , as it happens .
She 's a Tartar. " " Miss Havisham ? " " I do n't say no to that , but I meant <NAME> .
<NAME> is a stonemason ; chiefly in the gravestone , tomb , and monument way , and wholly of their colour from head to foot .
What ' s your message , Nelly ? ' The child handed him a letter .
You can contemplate your beauty at another time . "
Where are the graces of my soul ?
what are you up to , my dear ? ' said Mr Codlin , raising his head , and yawning .
From these she obtained a lamp , and a direction to the lady ' s room .
Her eyes were so red with waking and crying , that the <NAME> might have winked with greater consistency .
" Nothing but beggar my neighbor , miss. " " Beggar him , " said <NAME> to <NAME> .
<NAME> , ' said I , ' what is the matter ?
' Head , potry -- chapter , literary friends -- name , <NAME> ; ver good .
' Wish you luck , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , touching his hat .
Let me go back. ' ' I swear to you , <NAME> , you shall go directly .
' If I can redeem it , or hope to do so , you know I will. ' ' I am sure you will , ' was the reply .
Then it turned the handle , and went in .
On the haggard face of every man among these prisoners , the same expression sat .
' I suppose the <NAME> folks are rather rough and uncultivated ; that ' s all. ' ' But this person , ' urged Kate .
' It was wrong , ' said the old gentleman in a milder tone , ' very wrong .
You are his little pet , you are his favourite ; he ' ll do anything for you .
" I hear a voice , " says <NAME> ; " is it a still small voice , my friends ?
For old <NAME> 's deportment is very beautiful , you know , <NAME> , " said <NAME> , " and his feelings are extremely sensitive . "
<NAME> smiled with perfect composure , and said she had no doubt of my having been quite right , and of her having been very disagreeable .
' Accommodation , eh ? ' said that gentleman , consulting a large book .
In short , <NAME> , that is the object of my visit .
' Winkle -- Tupman -- I beg your pardon for the observations I made just now .
From which , " said <NAME> , " conjectures had been raised and theories formed .
Another minute , and it was suffused with a crimson flush : and a heavy wildness came over the soft blue eye .
I bred her and educated her , to be loved .
The brothers conferred apart for a short time : their manner showing that they were agitated .
The old man ' s eye was keen with the twinklings of avarice and cunning ; the young man ' s bright with the light of intelligence and spirit .
But neither mode of relief suggested itself to <NAME> ; so he solicited a private audience , and told his father .
Respecting the other certified copy , your wish shall be complied with .
' Nobody would if they did want to , ' said <NAME> .
' I beg and pray that no one will leave the room !
I have travelled out of the record , sir , I am aware , in putting the point to you .
" But really when the time came , and I knew no other ill of him , I was in doubts .
' Hurt his feelings , and lost him his situation. ' ' His feelings ? ' repeated <NAME> disdainfully .
' There ! ' said the dwarf , pulling him in .
The air struck chill and comfortless as it breathed upon him .
" 'She is my sister , <NAME> .
Except in that regard , we are all alike .
' Yes , ' I said , with some importance .
I sold them very willingly .
' I understand you , <NAME> , perfectly .
<NAME> <NAME> , standing on a cushion , surveying through the eye-glass , thus checks off .
He 'd make his fortun ' on the stage that dog would , and rewive the drayma besides . '
' No , <NAME> , ' said the Major , in a severe tone .
<NAME> repeated , as he scrambled out of bed .
I wish you good day , and I hope you 'll do well . "
' My daughter , <NAME> ' -- began Mr Dombey .
And now the void in <NAME> ' s own heart began again , indeed , to make a solitude around her .
' From Mr Garland. ' ' Oh ! ' said <NAME> , with extreme politeness .
Let him be at peace. " But the man continuing to exclaim , " <NAME> , <NAME> ! " the face of <NAME> is for a moment turned towards him .
' I bless the day ! ' said <NAME> .
They won ' t pass that werdick , they won ' t pass it , Sammy. ' And <NAME> shook his head with legal solemnity .
He felt the delicacy of his situation , and modestly replied , ' No. ' ' Are you , sir ? ' inquired <NAME> .
" Your granddaughter I have had the honour of seeing before ; my service to you , miss . "
He instantly jumped up , and it was not the same man , but another man !
' The Game Chicken , ' said Mr Toots .
' Very well , sir , ' said brother Charles .
' Her mother was , and she was poor .
There was one great source of uneasiness in the midst of this good fortune , and that was the having nobody by , to whom she could confide it .
There had been a wind all day ; and it was rising then , with an extraordinary great sound .
My parting love to uncle .
' No , ' said <NAME> , with the sunset very bright upon her .
You know you like this girl . "
I am sure you have enough to do , if that ' s what you want .
The <NAME> gardens blush with ripening fruit .
Nearly three hours of silence passed away .
There was a short pause ; the brandy-and-water had done its work ; the amiable countenance of <NAME> was fast recovering its customary expression .
Who else holds the door sometimes ?
<NAME> keeps her own little carriage now instead of hiring one , and lives full two miles further westward than <NAME> .
I am glad that , thinking I deserve to be thanked , you have come to thank me .
' <NAME> , ' said the magistrate , ' dear me , <NAME> -- pray take a seat -- you can not mean this ?
' I am not quite decided , ' returned Mr Dombey .
It is of my ward .
Then I playfully tried verbal instruction in domestic matters , as we walked about on a Saturday afternoon .
' You are , my love , you know you are ; one breath -- ' said <NAME> , blowing an imaginary feather away .
These were its brief contents : -- " Not wishful to intrude I have departured fur you are well again dear Pip and will do better without JO .
Why should I pause to ask how much of my shrinking from <NAME> might be traced to Estella ?
She filled his glass , put all the little matters on the table ready to his hand , and then sat beside him while he ate his supper .
' There ' s the light of her fire. ' ' I ' ll take a peep through the window , ' said <NAME> .
' All I ' ve got to say is , that it ' s well for you that the diwision of labour has been what it has been .
<NAME> , my lords and gentlemen .
Then we sits down , gradually gets cool , and holds a confabulation .
<NAME> coloured deeply , breathed quickly for a few moments , and then walked on with a firmer and more determined step .
<NAME> <NAME> objected to it very strong , and he is a good lodger , though his temper has been hard tried . "
<NAME> upon the ground , clinging to him , calling to him , folding her hands , praying to him .
There must be a splendid operation , though , to-morrow -- magnificent sight if <NAME> does it. ' ' You consider <NAME> a good operator ? ' said <NAME> .
But however that may be , <NAME> is gone .
" Why , get along with you , " said she to my guardian , " what do you mean ?

" You know I do n't intend to be responsible .
For anything I knew , his animosity towards the man might otherwise lead to his seeking him out and rushing on his own destruction .

I ' ll get a chaise at the <NAME> , and follow ' em instantly .
The wreck , even to my unpractised eye , was breaking up .
<NAME> as he was , however , he had sense enough to make a feint of feeling great regret at going away .
' No , R. W. Lavinia has not known the trial that <NAME> has known .
" It 's me , " returns the old man of the house , whose breath is in his ear .
Maddening church bells of all degrees of dissonance , sharp and flat , cracked and clear , fast and slow , made the brick-and-mortar echoes hideous .
' <NAME> ! ' said I , as civilly as I could , after a silence .
' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , smacking his lips , ' I hardly know , now .
'Well , you need n't be so cross , ' said his companion .
<NAME> <NAME> gently reasoned with him as he made a little drawing of his head on the fly-leaf of a book .
My dear young men , be easy with me , if you please .
I don ' t mean to say that I deserve to be the pride and delight of his life -- you believe me , I know -- but I am .
It is a broadsword to an oyster-knife .
' What , old Nobs ! ' ejaculated the son .
" Quite so , " says <NAME> with a calm nod .
' I knew you was a-going to say so .
It ' s a part of my character .
The day is then just breaking .
It ' s not much to bear .

The owners of such places as <NAME> , " said <NAME> with his usual happy and easy air , " are public benefactors .
Have you had many brothers , <NAME> ? "
Mr <NAME> ordered his carriage to be ready early in the morning that he might wait upon Mr Dorrit immediately after breakfast .
' Think better of him than to suppose it .
That concerned myself ; this concerns us all. ' ' Us all !
' Very great indeed , ' said Mr Dombey .
Much better to think of dead than alive , <NAME> !
I tell you , ' returned <NAME> , waving his hand in deprecation of any further wrath ; ' I wasn ' t in earnest .
' <NAME> dramatised stories which had previously appeared in print , it is true , ' observed <NAME> .
You keep half an eye on the newspapers , and I should n't wonder if you was to read something about it before long , if you look sharp .
But if he had cut the end of his nose off , he would have put a piece of sticking-plaister over it , and been quite satisfied .
As I told him yes , he laid it on the table , and resting his head upon his hand , began .
The servant-maids felt her inferiority , for they were better treated ; free to come and go , and regarded in their stations with much more respect .
<NAME> shook her head , and sighed .
It was no other than <NAME> who gave me this piece of intelligence .
" Not personally , <NAME> , " said <NAME> ; " merely through his solicitors , Messrs. <NAME> and <NAME> , of <NAME> .
A few lawyers ' clerks and others who know this suitor by sight linger on the chance of his furnishing some fun and enlivening the dismal weather a little .
He could n't say how long he might be , having a case on .
By your leave ! ' said <NAME> , knuckling his forehead , with a chuckle and a leer .
His gorgeousness was not unmixed with dirt ; and both in complexion and consistency he had suffered from the closeness of his pantry .
Shall I tell you what I think ?
It ain ' t because I ' m a servant and you ' re a master , that you ' re to go and libel me .
Neither of the three served or saved me .
The marine-store merchant holds the light , and the law-stationer conducts the search .
Then he stops , and with more of those inarticulate sounds , lifts up his eyes and seems to stare at something .
Advancing more and more into the shadow of this mournful place , its dark depressing influence stole upon their spirits , and filled them with a dismal gloom .
I ' d die degraded , as I had lived .
" Now lookee here , <NAME> , " said the man , turning quickly round upon him and tapping him on the breast with a large forefinger .
I spoke unkindly to him , and he can not bear it from me .
The light porter placed the tea-tray on it , knuckling his forehead as a form of homage .
Is mine less hard to bear or is it harder to bear , when my whole living was in it and has been thus shamefully sucked away ? "
It is longer than a travelling breakfast with us ; more orderly , and more polite .
" But , my dear , " she said , gaily , reaching another hand to put it upon mine .
He was so full of feeling too and had such a delicate sentiment for what was beautiful or tender that he could have won a heart by that alone .
Of her soon cheering up again , and our signing the register all round .
<NAME> was to be married to-morrow .
<NAME> , stop him for <NAME> 's sake , were it only in mercy !
We began to talk about my aunt ' s losses , and I told them what I had tried to do that morning .
His intention was rapidly communicated .
He has never uttered her name , since .
' Let ' s get back to the dodgerest of the dodgers , ' said he .
' " Pounds , shillings , and pence , " is my next note .
And he wears it , too , round his neck , I can tell you !
He looked out of the window -- it was very dark .
' Keep close to me all day .
It shall make me better . "
She , who so gloried in my fame , and so looked forward to its augmentation , well knew that I would labour on .
' You ain ' t poor , you know , <NAME> , as you pretend .
'That boy will be hung , ' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat .
Now , are you right there ? "
My Lady reclines in her chair composedly , though with a trifle less of graceful ease than usual perhaps , and never falters in her steady gaze .
' I mean I ' ll tell you nothing. ' Mr <NAME> sparkled at him , but frowned at him too .
She was right touching his destination .
I am tempted now to go away .
' Thank you , I would rather not , ' replied that gentleman .
I was going to remonstrate .
The earth shook when he walked -- he was so very stout .
' I ' ll step out by and by , <NAME> .
No , no ! ' As <NAME> says these latter words , he shakes his head , knowingly , and laughs again .
" <NAME> , " remonstrates <NAME> with his utmost severity .
' Here I am. ' ' Here you are , sir , ' assented Mr Venus .
" Then we may dismiss him for the present .

Another surgeon then coming in , the two exchanged a whisper , and the second took the hand .

" -- That the friend with whom he had formerly been staying there was Mr .
I don ' t know , ' said the jolly old gentleman ; ' all very natural , I dare say -- nothing unusual .
I determined to ask <NAME> why he had ever taught me to call those picture-cards <NAME> , which ought to be called knaves .
I told him all about it and how her first entreaties had referred to his forgiveness .
An undeniable boy for a pupil-teacher ; an undeniable boy to do credit to the master who should bring him on .
' What ! ' cried the old woman , her nodding head bridling with a ghastly vanity .
I SAID hope , I think !
My anything ; pet -- secretary -- messenger -- I do n't know what . "

Again he paused near the sisters ' house , and again he entered by the postern .
D'Aulnais is the name of his mother 's family. " <NAME> knitted steadily , but the intelligence had a palpable effect upon her husband .
' Not in intention -- no no , ' said he .
<NAME> , lying on the sofa in his room , playing the flute a little , was enchanted to see me .
The men were very ill-looking .
I says to myself , 'If I ai n't a gentleman , nor yet ai n't got no learning , I 'm the owner of such .
Am I to call in any assistance , or is the trick done ? "
He had seen it , with the expression of last night , timidly pleading to him .
It ' s quite private. ' ' Uncle Sol ! ' faltered <NAME> .
And he and <NAME> stood together , looking down with compassion on him .
' There is the inexpiable offence against my adoration of you .
He thrust his head out of the coach window at intervals , and bawled out to know why they didn ' t go faster .
I hope she is in no affliction ?
My Lady , do you object to the twilight ? "
Nothing national is exhibited for money ; and no public officer is a showman .
His mouth was such a post-office of a mouth that he had a mechanical appearance of smiling .
I should like to be able to say a word or two to my clerk just now .
There ' s nothing I should like better , but I must remain with these two fellows .
' Three ten and one ten is five .
You 're in the habit of shaking hands ? " I was rather confused , thinking it must be out of the <NAME> fashion , but said yes .
' There was , further , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> .
' Come nearer here , my dear Miss !

He led them into a stone kitchen , fitted with coppers for dressing the prison food , and pointed to a door .
He was <NAME> ' s unfortunate brother , to her , and nothing more .
Might I ask you why he made it ? ' <NAME> burst into tears .
<NAME> , may the present moment be the least unhappy of our lives .
" Here 's something to eat , poor boy , " says <NAME> .
She falls from the lowermost stair , and is swallowed up in the gulf .
The disregarded parrot only was in action .
' You run about the brink , and run across it , in this uncertain light , on a few inches width of rotten wood , ' said he .
<NAME> well , I ' m agreeable : I can ' t say no fairer than that , can I , sir ? ' ( <NAME> smiled . )
' I am , ' repeated the Dodger .
Loose then stabbed <NAME> with one of those never-failing weapons , a bowie-knife .
' Surely that must content you !
We do our best to polish -- polish -- polish ! "
At that point the object of his affections shut him up like a box with a spring lid , and sent him away .
I should say he knew nothing about her and had never seen her , so HE can give me no information .
She does her best to destroy my fortunes and her own , and she won ' t reproach me !
" I came to take these babies down to my room for an hour , " he said , going to them again , " and let them play about .
How often have I inquired for you , and been told that I should hear before long ! ' ' I know , I know ! ' returned <NAME> .
" I inquired because , coming from <NAME> , I of course have not yet been in town , and I thought some letters might have been sent down here .
You do look uncommon well , to be sure. ' <NAME> acknowledged the compliment , and cordially shook hands with the stout gentleman in the top-boots .
' That ' s it. ' ' What ' s it ? ' said <NAME> .
We took our leave early , and left together .

I will address your mother , sir , who knows the world. ' ' Ah !

<NAME> , too , poor wandering shipwrecked boy , oh , where is he ?
I was very hot indeed upon <NAME> 's daring to admire her ; as hot as if it were an outrage on myself .
" Very well ; then you may go .
Thou knowest who said , " Let him who is without sin among you cast the first stone at her ! " There have been plenty to do that .
Bless you , my dear Sir , such a thing was never heard of , without a consultation fee being previously paid , and a consultation fixed .
' My secret was out ; and my only struggle now was for liberty and freedom .

They were two men who were seated in easy attitudes upon the grass , and so busily engaged as to be at first unconscious of intruders .
Then I don ' t know what it is , I am sure. ' ' What should you say to a young lady from <NAME> ? ' inquired <NAME> .
Whenever the sound reached his ears , he would immediately lay down his pen and fall to rubbing his hands and exhibiting the greatest glee .

" She died a woman , " said the <NAME> , " and had , as I think , children . "
I know his ways , and the likely nooks he favours .
It fell to <NAME> now , to be not quite certain how to answer .
Of my friend <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' who is a man of remarkable shrewdness , I desire to speak with all possible respect .
<NAME> <NAME> naturally asked why not ?
<NAME> <NAME> went down to let him in , and he said on entering , ' Affery , I am glad it ' s you .

' The gentleman took my card .
Then he slowly released his left hand from its pocket , and made that bush of his whiskers , still contemplating him in silence .
Having given in a hearty shake , he retired , growling , under a form ; just escaping the pewter measure which <NAME> levelled at his head .
<NAME> men passed above his head , and rose and rose ; but he was always at the bottom .
That may be eccentricity , or he may be proud of his legs .
The venerable baron caught his child to his arms , and shed a wink of joy .
' I do n't know what that means , ' replied <NAME> .
He had changed , himself , since then .
But my poor young cousins ! "
To consider , wrong as he was , that he could care so much for her , and that she had the power to move him so !
Do you know whether they 've sold the prize <NAME> that was hanging up there ? -- Not the little prize <NAME> : the big one ? "
There were no shortcomings anywhere , in anything but money .
' Good ! ' said Mr Meagles , cheerily .
For instance , it 's your object to take care of number one -- meaning yourself . '
' Because I have no other resting-place , ' was the reply .

' All down <NAME> , all down <NAME> , all up <NAME> , down Gracechurch Street , and along <NAME> , as far as <NAME> ' s <NAME> .
But for this it would have been difficult to detach its figure from the night , and separate it from the darkness by which it was surrounded .
I foresaw your visit this afternoon. ' ' <NAME> ' t ! ' said Mr Inspector .
' What is it ? ' ' What is it ? ' repeated <NAME> .
' Not half what <NAME> is , he isn ' t , ' replied the small servant , shaking her head .
<NAME> very much admired some artificial flowers under a glass .
<NAME> , do look at him !
Oh , take me somewhere ! " Much alarmed .
Your suspense is nearly ended , my darling ; he shall be restored to you within a few hours ; I have encompassed him with every protection .
" Good Spirit , " he pursued , as down upon the ground he fell before it : " Your nature intercedes for me , and pities me .
The old man of the house , pushing it open before him , appeared there with his fur cap in his hand and his cat at his heels .
Did you hear him say , you cur , that he was going to have the <NAME> cleared off , when no doubt the whole place will be rummaged ?
' This evening. ' ' I shall not give them any notice that we are here , you know , ' said I , delighted .
' I know it , ' rejoined <NAME> .
' And what should you say , ' said the <NAME> -- ' not committing yourself -- about his time of sheering off ?
You must go to bed another time , my love .
<NAME> , by the by , said as much in a tone of surprise as he scrambled out of bed .
' The willin ! ' ' And leave off his evil ways , and set up in the chandlery line arterwards , ' said the housemaid .
In one part of the window was a picture of a red paper mill at which a cart was unloading a quantity of sacks of old rags .
" I have said , my child , that what I do , I do for your sake , not my own .
She seemed to respect him and even to wish to conciliate him .
' Your praise , sir , is commendation , indeed. ' ' Well , ' said <NAME> , ' what ' s to be done ?
This , however , was a mere question of length and wearisomeness .
' There they are , like the four-and-twenty fiddlers -- all of a row .
He laughed when I cautioned him , and said he was as good a man as <NAME> any day .
' You were obliged to tell him !
" Do n't look ! " cried <NAME> .
' The -- ? ' My mother had been thinking of something else .
" You hear what she says .
' I am glad to see them .
<NAME> ' t go out , you ' ll fall dead in the street .
Do you know much of him ? ' ' I never saw the man in my life. ' ' I doubt if you ever _will_ see him now .
Her father , a gentleman in misfortune -- a gentleman of a fine spirit and courtly manners , who always bore with him -- he deeply honoured .
" I do not accuse him . "
I always had , when I was a medical man .
I 'll follow the other , by G -- -- " " The other ? "
<NAME> <NAME> looks very grave .
And I anything that <NAME> told me. ' How delightful those interchanges , and the looks accompanying them !
Besides , ' said <NAME> , putting back her hair , and looking wonderingly at my aunt and me , ' why shouldn ' t you both go ?
At this , the charity-boy looked monstrous fierce ; and said that <NAME> would want one before long , if he cut jokes with his superiors in that way .
" Babies are to be nut-crackered dead , for people 's poor grandpapa 's positions ! " Then he let himself down again , and became silent .
And your sister , <NAME> , and your brother .
" You have no time to ask me why I bring it , or what it means ; I have no time to tell you .
<NAME> , this is a wine that was imported by the captain , we will not say how many years ago .
Upon its coming in , the dying flame leaped up , as though it cried , " I know him ; <NAME> 's Ghost ! "
' <NAME> of themselves ! ' said Mrs. Raddle .
The auspicious event is always commemorated according to certain forms settled and prescribed by <NAME> some years since .
She was very pretty : exceedingly pretty .
' Come here , <NAME> , ' said her father , coldly .
But no dog appeared , and at length he resumed his journey .
' Oh , the man -- the man -- behind the door ! ' screamed <NAME> .
<NAME> tells the tempter that he wears no jewellery but his watch and chain , which were his father ' s ; and his shirt-pin .
' <NAME> ' t you think me a queer little comicality ? ' In shaking her head at him after asking the question , she shook her hair down .
The boat went on , under the arching trees , and over their tranquil shadows in the water .
<NAME> <NAME> sat in his private office one morning , ready dressed to walk abroad .
She was very much attached to me -- very much -- highly connected , too .
He was then the most impetuous boy in the world , and he is now the most impetuous man .
' Whew ! ' whistled <NAME> , as he took it in his hand .
<NAME> <NAME> had looked on at this , as one who recognized in Joe the village idiot , and in me his keeper .
Almost as good a one as you thought me for you .
What can I do ? ' cried <NAME> .
'What have you got , <NAME> ? '
You know he is always good-humoured and tractable .
I was to think of it , and could speak to her by the church .
' She is quite exhausted , ' said the schoolmaster , glancing upward into his face .
I don ' t know what I thought , or what I dreaded .
His business is the Law ? " I nodded harder .
<NAME> , in the library , has fallen asleep for the good of the country over the report of a <NAME> committee .
He had spoken so sensibly and feelingly of my weakness that I wanted to know something about his strength .
Although I looked about me confusedly and hurriedly as we crossed the street , I thought I knew the place .
exclaimed the old man in a tone of thoughtful amazement and with a wider stare than before .
' Stupid ! ' said Mrs. Squeers angrily .
<NAME> parent dies. ' Same Buffer , emboldened by success , says : ' When ? ' ' The other day .
And it was made the more difficult by the unconscious <NAME> .
That ' s all I know. ' ' Good-night , <NAME> ! ' said <NAME> , sorrowfully .
Here is the door as you see .
<NAME> almost smacks his lips with the unction of a horrible interest .
If I had never come into the property , I shouldn ' t have minded .
I forget how my uncle used to call it . "
he cried in a shrill tone .
Never were such jolly , roystering , rollicking , merry-making blades , as the jovial crew of <NAME> .
' I began , by means of his assistance , to copy law writings .
' " Wouldn ' t she ? " said the old gentleman firmly .
His face , his voice , his manner , all showed that too plainly .
'To the kind gentleman , and the dear old nurse , who took so much care of me before , ' rejoined <NAME> .
She became utterly and completely miserable .
I shall be within the mark any way .
cried <NAME> , struggling to disengage himself from the girl 's grasp .
' I am very glad to know they do ! ' ' Aye , ' returned the old man , ' but stay .
cried the lady , ' I have been so dreadfully put out ! '
' <NAME> won ' t be long , ' said <NAME> .
<NAME> , <NAME> , let me know what my crime is , will you ? ' The stricken Grinder wept , and put his coat-cuff in his eye .
' Here ' s a state of things ! ' cried Mr <NAME> , raising his eyes to the ceiling .
But the agony of mind , the remorse , and shame I felt when I became conscious next day !
You have got good measure , <NAME> What-is-it. ' ' Try Jenny , ' suggested that young lady with great calmness .
His constant height is of a piece with his immense abilities .
The little people could do nothing without dear <NAME> .
The young lady uttered a cry of surprise , and for a few moments they were so still that the listener could distinctly hear them breathe .
' Quite right to remind me , <NAME> .
' Here you are again , ' repeated Mr Wegg , musing .
I want my bond , you see .
It was not so easily got ready as some people may imagine .
Will you give me the opportunity of saying a few words to you when you come up stairs ? ' ' Assuredly .
Can I speak to you ? ' Mr <NAME> proposed that <NAME> should drive on to his house , a few hundred yards further .
Let him put away his whim now , and he is welcome back .
And then I thought of <NAME> , and of our parting , and went home very sadly .
Let me wet your lips again .
" There never was , " said my guardian , musing as he smiled upon me , " such a Dame Durden for making money last . "
" I am afraid you are tired .
Since it must be seen , I will have it seen by the light I stood in .
' Why , ' said <NAME> , ' it ' s as plain as <NAME> .
" No , I can not spare him !
' I never bet half a dozen ! ' said the other gentleman .
It would be hard , indeed , to part you now .
<NAME> ' t judge him , sir , as you would judge others outside the gates .
He saw that she was desperate , and that her unquenchable hatred of him would stop at nothing .
I am glad to hear you do .
<NAME> and he were very different now , he said , and very happy .
All that I know about <NAME> , you know. " " And all that I know , " I retorted , " you know. " " I fully believe it .
" Three Rums ! " cried the stranger , calling to the landlord .
' Said the <NAME> was the perfect picture of the old aunt from whom he had expectations .
I suppose it was true .
And you , sweet Kit , honest Kit , virtuous , innocent Kit , look to yourself .
By perpetuating the consequences of his ignorant and blind obstinacy .
This was not addressed to <NAME> , or to any one whom he could see , but it produced an immediate effect .
In an instant she was gone , and he had shut the door .
' I wish I could hope that it would do your father good , ' said Mrs. Weller .
They took the path indicated by the sexton , and soon arrived before the parsonage wall .
Very near the bottom now .
<NAME> ' s is all you ' ve got to say to <NAME> .
" See how the soot 's falling .
I am sure , at least , I couldn ' t feel like one. ' ' Ay , but that is not enough , and is not what I mean .
I demand to see her .
I have had no counsellor , no adviser , no one to protect me .
I have not spent any of it .
' Only father has brought old <NAME> home , and I want you to come into the drawing-room .
But he is not to be spoken of if you please .
When I awoke next morning , I was resolute to declare my passion to <NAME> , and know my fate .
Drawers , desks , pockets , all things belonging to him , <NAME> examines .
I have sat alone and unnoticed , half an evening , while he conversed with his young cousin , my pupil .
Next evening , down come <NAME> and my Lady with their largest retinue , and down come the cousins and others from all the points of the compass .
I leave them to you , at your desire .
I knew its tender nature very well .
A man of your mark ! ' ' It ' s not so much saying it that I object to , ' returned Mr Venus , ' as doing it .
Our friend <NAME> -- do n't be alarmed ! -- is arrested for debt . "
I am dismissed ! ' She looked as little shocked and as hopeful as she could , but it was distressing news , for many reasons .
The country round <NAME> is surpassingly and exquisitely picturesque .
So saying , he unlocks his door , gropes his way into his murky rooms , lights his candles , and looks about him .
" Is he dead ? " I asked , after a silence .
It was a public holiday , and <NAME> did not recover his spirits or his usual temperature of nose until the afternoon .
Nor were there wanting objects in the crowd itself to give new point and purpose to the shifting scene .
None of them have come down in the world as we have .
I 'll tell you something more , wolf .
So in her bosom even now ; the strongest qualities she possessed , long turned upon themselves , became a heap of obduracy , that rose against a friend .
Never , never , before <NAME> , have I thought of you but as the single , bright , pure , blessed recollection of my boyhood and my youth .
Therefore Mrs <NAME> asked no questions , and showed no curiosity .
" He is called among the neighbours the <NAME> .
Do you deserve your blessings ?
' <NAME> likely , ' replied <NAME> briefly .
' You are to be in all things regulated and governed , ' said the gentleman , ' by fact .
But water [ ' specially when ' tis salt ) comes nat ' ral to me ; and friends is dear , and I am heer .
I may be wrong , but I have formed that opinion. ' Both Traddles and I applauded it highly .
Her face was hidden from his view , but <NAME> could see that she was weeping .
I was articled to <NAME> and <NAME> .
" Do it yourself , " returned the friend rather tartly .
<NAME> you good-night , Mrs. <NAME> .
My stall and I are for ever parted .
" Is my benefactor to be made known to me to-day ? " " No .
You will like to make some change , perhaps ?
There ain ' t so much in that , you ' ll say .
Little Em ' ly had stopped and looked up at the sky in her enumeration of these articles , as if they were a glorious vision .
A somewhat difficult feat , achieved with great dexterity , and with a prodigious splash .
You know her. ' ' I remember , ' said his companion carelessly .
But , for example , the sprightly little woman was very sure of it , she said .
" Little woman , " said he , " You have been crying . "
Behave yourself to visitors , my lady !
I was not sure you had a workman of your own here , my dear friend , or we need n't have employed this person . "
The trooper then takes from his breast-pocket a folded paper , which he lays with an unwilling hand at the lawyer 's elbow .
This has been a bad business , and may be worse , if we delay a moment .
Can you follow me , <NAME> ?
" And something else supports me , <NAME> . "
" Write exactly as I speak. " " To whom do I address it ? " " To no one. " <NAME> still had his hand in his breast .
But you ' ll never go on with it , ' said number four .
If I should prowl about the streets a long time , do n't be uneasy ; I shall reappear in the morning .
It was the first of their proceedings which had no heartiness .
At the stairs where we had taken him abroad , and ever since , I had looked warily for any token of our being suspected .
His knowledge is not at fault in the present instance .
I ' m generally to be found here , gentlemen , but if I ' m not here , or over the way , that ' s my address .
' Not at all , ' said <NAME> .
We can do so , undismayed .
He winked -- winked openly and undisguisedly ; winked with his right eye -- upon <NAME> !
Her first proceeding there was to unlock a tall press , bring out several bottles , and pour some of the contents of each into my mouth .
'What if he turns against the others ? '
And then I know what would happen .
' I wonder whether THEY can hear it , ' said <NAME> .
Shall I tell you about the second time I saw her ?
I see her face now , better than I did then , I dare say , with its indelible look of regret and wonder turned upon me .
' I believe that he loves me , fully as much as I love him. ' ' Oh , what happiness ! ' exclaimed <NAME> .
With no consciousness of having moved , she gained the door .
There is no look of decent comfort anywhere .
Mr Wrayburn , I have had a bitter trial to-night , and I hope you will not think me ungrateful , or mysterious , or changeable .
He was a grotesque , fantastic figure , and the few bystanders laughed .
We must have that bottle. ' ' Why , you wouldn ' t take it by force ? ' said <NAME> , restraining him .
He rubbed it into my mouth and up my nose and down my throat -- Ow !
There were the hedgerows where the brother and sister had so often gathered wild flowers together , and the green fields and shady paths where they had so often strayed .
Keep your eye upon my Uncle , will you , Mr <NAME> , and make him as comfortable as you can while I am gone ?
I wish to make you happy .
They came out with me directly to look at the boy .
Most of the theatres keep an author on purpose. ' ' Indeed ! ' cried <NAME> .
' There , my dear ! ' said Mr Boffin when they came in to supper .
Fingers and toes. ' ' He pays well , I hope ? ' said <NAME> .
Her golden hair , which she wore in long curls , had been hurriedly pushed aside , and fell down over her neck .
' You would like to be a lady ? ' I said .
" <NAME> left us at a week 's notice .
It ' s a dreadful thing to gape , but I must do something .
From the accumulated sadness into which I fell , I had at length no hope of ever issuing again .
' <NAME> , ' returned <NAME> , in her usual strong low voice , ' there is a demon of anger in you .
' I have surely slept very long , ' returned <NAME> .
She then walked me on very fast .
The spinster aunt trembled , till some pebbles which had accidentally found their way into the large watering-pot shook like an infant ' s rattle .
Our old selves would be fit for nothing here but to be robbed and imposed upon .
You found him secret ? ' returns <NAME> , with a greedy relish .
I thought the simple confidence reposed in us by <NAME> and by himself , was , in itself , affecting .
' You see those two old houses , ' he said at last .
<NAME> of parents , devoid of relations , devoid of flocks and herds , devoid of gold and silver and of precious stones .
Anything. ' ' I don ' t like it , ' pettishly returned <NAME> as before .
I shall go down into <NAME> afterwards. ' ' Shooting , sir ? ' said the coachman .
Among the number was one stout , red-faced , elderly man , in particular , seated in an opposite box , who attracted <NAME> ' s attention .
' Plenty of everything. ' ' Lor ! ' chuckled <NAME> , giving her knees a hug .
Do you attach no value to their good opinion ?
' Won ' t you stop to say something to Mrs. Crummles ? ' asked the manager , following him down to the door .
Upon the way , the guard and I were formally introduced to each other ( as we usually were on such occasions ) , and exchanged a variety of small-talk .
It was a trouble to him to think of this face of <NAME> .
But , now I believe that the mark of the red cross is fatal to them , and that they have no part in His mercies .
I ' ll tell her that you have come home .
' A porochial life is not a bed of roses , Mrs .
' The old man and his grandchild who travelled with you -- where are they ?
' Uncle much hove down , <NAME> ' r ? ' inquired the <NAME> , as they were walking along .
I could take care of his property when you are away -- good care , you see. ' Heaving a long-drawn sigh , <NAME> paused for a response .
' There ' ll shortly be an end of <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , threatening it with the hat-box .
' HE was a long time , ' replied <NAME> .
He has been so careless and said so much that he never meant .
I almost think he did .
His altered character had never been so grossly marked .
-- Heerd a noise , ' continued <NAME> .
<NAME> on making one last effort to redeem her character , she breaks from Mr Toots and runs away to find the coach , and show a parting smile .
'Have I the lady 's promise for that ? '
' The talent of the other three is principally in combat and serious pantomime .
In moments of confidence too ?
' I said mine , didn ' t I ? ' returned <NAME> .
That you sent messages by , you know !
" Yes , " I said ; " and to be repaid by such gratitude as hers is to be made rich , guardian . "
<NAME> nodded assent , and drained his glass .
The predilections of the inexhaustible baby being provided for , <NAME> could think of nothing else .
I myself always clearly foresaw the consequences , and am not surprised .
Is there summ ' at deadly sticking to my clothes ?
He was far from rich , and every day of indecision and inaction made his inheritance a source of greater anxiety to him .
He had been spurred and whipped and heavily sweated .
<NAME> <NAME> returned the glare , concentrated into a focus by means of his spectacles , and breathed a bold defiance .
When I handed her down to the door , there was a child , a pretty boy from two to three years old , in her carriage .
I made , and have kept , that plot of ground entirely with my own hands .
'Dodger , take off the sausages ; and draw a tub near the fire for <NAME> .
" 'You had better see , ' he carelessly answered ; and took up a light .
You only knew the town was there , because you knew there could have been no such sulky blotch upon the prospect without a town .
I thought you ' d allow me to pay my compliments to you .
As <NAME> gazed sternly upon him , it rolled down his cheek .
It was very solitary and very dull , and I did not doubt that I might safely steal upstairs .
' It was well that I should be pitied and forgiven by you , or anyone of your name , in the first hour of my return !
" Then , " pursued <NAME> , " it 's monotonous , and to-day is too like yesterday , and to-morrow is too like to-day . "
You know I do , and I wonder you don ' t colour up like fire .
<NAME> sang with great sweetness and expression , and so did Mrs. Strong .
Upwards of an hour elapsed before my guardian put his head into the room where <NAME> and I were sitting and said , " Come in , my dears ! "
So rife and potent was the fever in Bleeding Heart Yard , that Mr <NAME> ' s rent-days caused no interval in the patients .
This was a good freshener to my presence of mind , as a beginning .
Was he here this morning ? ' ' <NAME> , ' bawled <NAME> , in a very loud key .
And yet a married woman , possessing your attractions , shuts her eyes ( and sparklers too ) , and goes and runs her delicate-formed head against a wall .
Apropos of producing , let somebody produce that at its address , and produce the answer here. ' ' Cavalletto , ' said <NAME> .
This is not the place for <NAME> of any kind .
<NAME> walked on the other side of <NAME> , and never quitted that position .
Here is an inkstand , here are pens and paper , here are wafers .
He was there , he was there .
It might have cost me a client .
" Dead ! " The people closed round , and looked at Monsieur the <NAME> .
The large rooms are too cramped and close .
There must always be two parties to a quarrel , says the old adage .
I beg your pardon ; will you allow me to look at that card again ? ' ' Oh !
I ' ll hold you living , and I ' ll hold you dead .
Mrs. <NAME> overheard him and smiled .
' Fine pursuit , sir -- fine pursuit. -- <NAME> , <NAME> ? ' ' Not just now , ' said <NAME> .
<NAME> has been recognised by <NAME> as the affectionate brother you have heard of , " said <NAME> , " and has acknowledged the relationship .
said the Jew , bending his head forward , with his eyes almost starting out of it .
' I doubt it , my dear young lady , ' said the doctor , shaking his head .
' Stop and take me , if you please , <NAME> .
If he ' s there , bring him in .
Self-elected saints with gloomy brows , this sightless , earless , voiceless child may teach you lessons you will do well to follow .
I never heard these two points so wisely touched ( if indeed I have ever heard them touched at all ) , by any preacher of that kind before .
Here it is , you see , sir !
I owe it all to him , my love , my pride !
' Eh , <NAME> ? ' ' Yes , indeed , ' said I .
Her tears burst forth afresh at the sight ; she was ashamed and afraid of it ; but it moved her to no anger against him .
' There ' s one thing about you , <NAME> ' otherest Governor , ' said <NAME> , faring on again , ' as looks well and goes fur .
' Is anything the matter here ? ' ' A wedding <NAME> , a wedding ! ' cried several voices .
The bank closed , the ancient clerks came out , the usual watch was set , and <NAME> and his son went home to tea .
He might have been at bottom , but he certainly was not at top , seeing that his coat was of the roughest and most ill-favoured kind .
Will you read to me a little more ? ' <NAME> was withdrawing her hand to open the book , when <NAME> detained it for a moment .
'Where he can , your worship , ' replied the officer ; again pretending to receive <NAME> 's answer .
<NAME> has asked him whether he went to school as a junior with <NAME> ?
<NAME> , stay , ' added the Jew , unlocking a drawer with a shaking hand ; 'there 's money , my dears .
Mr <NAME> and the dog were established frequenters of the cottage , and the day was fixed for the wedding .
And yet he did care something for the streets that environed that house , and for the senseless stones that made their pavements .
It may be years hence , or it may be only months , but I shall come to that at last . '
Wednesday morning was dawning when I looked out of window .
A <NAME> and a Chase 10 .
' <NAME> , I protest against pride .
It was curious to observe some faces which stood out prominently from among the group .
You must know <NAME> 's <NAME> in <NAME> .
And am I never to have change of air , because the bees don ' t ?
Really and truly pretty comfortable ?
" You put that to her ladyship , <NAME> , <NAME> , from me , <NAME> of the Detective .
<NAME> Leicester is majestically wroth .
Much that I have seen , but not noted , has come back upon me with new meaning , during this last trying hour .
God bless that stewardess for her piously fraudulent account of January voyages !
Are you any fresher now , or do you want the iron candlestick to wake you thoroughly ? '
He may be a very superior man , but he is , so to speak , merged -- merged -- in the more shining qualities of his wife . "
Take your oath of that. ' And reference being made to Mr Perch , he confirms her view of the case .
What have I to do with it ?
<NAME> <NAME> , leaning forward over the table , pierces what he has got to follow directly into <NAME> with the thumb-nail already mentioned .
Walks by night , does she ?
I am very susceptible to such horrid things .
It would be hard to keep your model republics going , without the countrymen and countrywomen of those two labourers .
' They ' re no good , I suppose. ' ' They ' re no harm , ' said <NAME> .
But it was enough for <NAME> that <NAME> was used to it .
Free of my commission , I shall be able to compound with some small usurers who will hear of nothing but their bond now -- <NAME> says so .
The dwarf had twice encountered him when he was endeavouring to obtain intelligence of the fugitives .
My sister will miss you .
observes the penitent trooper , shaking his head .
Mr Lightwood will be in directly. ' ' I ' m not in a hurry , ' said Mr <NAME> ' Thank you , sir .
Do not mind me , <NAME> , ' she returned .
' I heard the doctor tell them I was dying , ' replied the child with a faint smile .
A girl can get on anywhere .
' Why , sir , Friday or Saturday , nigh ' bout. ' ' Friday or Saturday , ' said <NAME> .
I tried to convince her so , but I didn ' t succeed .
Was she glad to know it ?
He has been at it all day . "
He wore thick shoes , and thick leather gaiters , and thick gloves like a hedger ' s .
" My service to him , too !
' <NAME> and <NAME> , ' growled the bass .
At first I thought it quite hopeless , but I have unquestionably seen , for a single moment , the face that I once knew so well .
Never from the mighty sea may voices rise too late , to come between us and the unseen region on the other shore !
It was very little , but even hunger was forgotten in the strange tranquillity that crept over her senses .
No bringing up by hand then .
But I had lost twenty-four hours .
Licker they ' ll do yo hurt. ' Slackbridge laughed , folded his arms , and frowned sarcastically .
' Should you ? ' was the only reply of the bagman , who continued to smoke with great vehemence .
It 'll be better for him .
My husband , the forester. " " What of your husband , the forester ?
Because he is not free to show himself and to speak for himself , you would let such people insult him with impunity .
Whether it was a criminal act that I had committed ?
I was apprenticed when I was seven year old. ' ' Oh !
But how could I , a poor dazed village lad , avoid that wonderful inconsistency into which the best and wisest of men fall every day ?
' My love , you will inform <NAME> , if you please. ' ' Assuredly , ' said <NAME> .
Go out and ask who is never trifled with , and who is always treated with some delicacy .
It was but a few minutes after ten o ' clock , when her carriage rolled along the street in which she lived .
<NAME> , it is better for her , much better ; you owe it to her .
' that ' s wery self-denyin ' o ' you. ' ' Wery , ' replied his parent , with a sigh .
His patron took that opportunity of turning the key in the door , and then sat down upon his bed .
' Nothing is going to be done .
" 'Not dead , ' said I ; 'but like to die . '
' They have never understood you , <NAME> , ' said his wife .
Who told a stranger we could be seen ?
Afterwards , I sometimes observed her rise , with her eyes full of tears , and go out of the room .
She looked very young indeed to be the mother of two children , and I could not help pitying both her and them .
The body was in _its_ place , and its eyes were as he saw them when he stole away .
' You see , ' said Mr Toots , ' what I wanted in a wife was -- in short , was sense .
And , what is very strange , I found him -- " " Not to be any out-of-the-way person , I am afraid ! "
It appears to me , Mr <NAME> , that you yourself are too often and too much in that direction , that direction .
If he stopped it did the same .
" One might suppose I was a-moving in the fashionable circles and getting myself up for almac 's , " says <NAME> .
They are funny , but not uncommon. ' ' Funny ! ' exclaimed <NAME> involuntarily .
' Of course I know that , <NAME> .
I know only one thing that I am fit for , and that is , to go for a soldier .
Next day came ; came <NAME> ; and came <NAME> .
' Do you play ecarte , <NAME> ? ' ' I shall be very happy to learn under your tuition , ' replied <NAME> .
So I 'll give you a piece of advice , and it 's this , do n't you talk too much .
He was arranging his fruit in plates while we talked , which divided his attention , and was the cause of his having made this lapse of a word .
" I accept it with many thanks , " returned the trooper .

" Did you hear that he was dead , <NAME> ? " I presently asked , with increasing diffidence .
" Yes , yes , you are tired , " said he .
" No , " said a great fat man with a monstrous chin , " I do n't know much about it , either way .

' Anywheres , my dear , ' said the collector , ' I am not particular. ' Not particular !
' Let me lie by him .

Mists hide in the avenues , veil the points of view , and move in funeral-wise across the rising grounds .
<NAME> , I see her dark eyes roll round the church when she says ' miserable sinners ' , as if she were calling all the congregation names .

None of them , young or old , thought of passing the child without a friendly word .
<NAME> <NAME> stood up in a state of great agitation , and took a glance at the court .

Pointing in the direction of <NAME> , he inquired whether any one was up yonder to-night .
I could only be as brisk and busy as possible , and that I had tried to be all along .
Common abbreviations took new meanings in his eyes , and had sole reference to them .
' Well , and what then ? ' said <NAME> .
The basket packed in silence , they brought her bonnet to her , and smoothed her disordered hair , and put it on .
And why should you take trouble ?

I forgive her , if I have any cause .
' How are the mighty fallen ! ' remarks <NAME> .

Here they stopped , and Mr <NAME> consulted his watch .
It brought to her mind the foot of the <NAME> , and she committed herself to Him who died upon it .
And my terror was greatest of all when I found no figure there .
<NAME> was sure she must .
'And take yourself away from here , unless you want me to do something desperate . '
When the shadows of evening were closing in , I took an opportunity of getting into the garden with <NAME> for a little talk .
" I 'll tell you , however , " said I , " whether you want to know or not .

' I am so glad to be here. ' ' That ' s a fine fellow ! ' said <NAME> .
Who brought you up by hand ? " " You did , " said I .
Now look here , Mr Wegg .
I have said so already , ' replied <NAME> , shaking the right hand of his friend , while <NAME> shook the left .
said the undertaker ; looking up from the book , and pausing in the middle of a word ; 'is that you , Bumble ? '
This is not a time for a lady , however highly connected , to be totally inaudible , and seemingly swallowing marbles .

' Halloa ! ' said <NAME> , falling back , with a wink .
What does this mean ? ' ' In the name of <NAME> , say what it means , <NAME> ! ' urged <NAME> .
We turned to the right as I have turned , but I can recall no more .
It was nearly dinner-time next day when we appeared before my aunt .
