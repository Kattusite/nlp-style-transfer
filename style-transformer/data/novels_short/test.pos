And what a leer there was upon the face !
‘ I didn ’ t think of that .
‘ A new one ? ’ I repeated .
The power of this woman is astonishing .
I am as gay as a lark. ’ Which his face confirmed .
The old question arose again and again -- What could it be ?
Was he much the better for his wealth ?
‘ Quite a young woman , ’ said <NAME> , musing .
I got your letter and destroyed it .
The gaps remain , and there are not unpopular lodgings among the rubbish .
'It 's all arranged about bringing off the swag , is it ? '
‘ Was ever man so beset as I ?
`` He certainly was not active in it .
‘ Did I say “ before ? ” ’ replied old Sol .
‘ You have no business there .
‘ At the apartment of your son .
And I said again , `` I ca n't help it , <NAME> . ''
‘ Ha ! ’ he said , ‘ I thought so .
“ My father , ” said <NAME> , softly laying her hand on his .
I never to my knowledge see you afore though , not even in court .
`` And again , '' says mademoiselle with more tight and angry nods .
And besides , it was not a long-considered step .
'Take a seat , will you ? '
Let us find my brother. ’ ‘ Not yet .
I saw my mother stop her ears then , and I heard her crying .
‘ Be mine , be mine ! ’ repeated the old gentleman .
'Compose yourself , <NAME> , and answer me distinctly .
It ’ s a cruel thing to keep the dear child shut up there .
<NAME> , long ago , ’ said <NAME> , without looking at her .
There was no appearance of its inmates stirring at that early hour .
They then parted good friends , and <NAME> walked away .
And where were they all now ?
‘ Kill me sooner than take me there .
'Let me out , ' said <NAME> .
The head was covered now .
It ’ s mine , ’ retorted <NAME> .
‘ They came , and raised her , and placed her on the bed .
‘ Yes ! ’ the Father of the <NAME> assented .
They have left off telling me to ‘ wait a few days more ’ .
‘ Is it nothing to see those placards about ?
A break-up of the constitootion is it ? -- werry good .
‘ Nor was this the whole extent of the baron ’ s misfortunes .
You have to do with a man also .
<NAME> nodded his concurrence in the opinion .
Everything within reach of your hand , in good preservation .
‘ He doesn ’ t know what to say , ’ replied <NAME> .
Heaven be with you , <NAME> ! ’ cried <NAME> with emotion .
I can say that , with a true and honest heart , any way .
‘ Well , well ! ’ said <NAME> .
Tell me of my ingratitude .
'The father of the unhappy <NAME> had _two_ daughters , ' said <NAME> .
And now it seems to be everybody , except you. ’ Oho !
The time might have been when I might have revealed it to you .
`` Will you run over , once again , what the boy said ? ''
‘ Not at all , ’ gruffly remarked the elder <NAME> .
I dare say I owe as much as good-natured people will let me owe .
`` So he tells me , '' returned my guardian .
‘ It ’ s nearly eleven o ’ clock , <NAME> .
He keeps them on shelves over his head , and will weigh them all .
One of <NAME> ’ s friends was named <NAME> , and the other <NAME> .
`` Why , no , I ca n't say he has , miss .
I want to get some dinner . ''
I could not help adding , `` So unreasonably ! ''
They 'll be delighted , every one of 'em . '
'This is my friend , <NAME> .
I am going to do so .
And what then , sir ? ’ ‘ Oh !
'We want to sleep here to-night . '
They listened as he spoke again within its silent walls .
And that opens a pretty picture of things , I hope ?
But , tut , all this is nothing !
She has n't much strength in her , so I easily kept her quiet .
‘ I know all about it , <NAME> !
‘ I shouldn ’ t be here without him .
It was all over now .
`` You would like some hot water , would n't you ? ''
<NAME> and loose in one thing , fast and loose in everything .
His eye-glass and his watch are ready to his hand .
She can ’ t be more than seventeen -- say eighteen at the outside .
I wishes ’ em no hurt ! )
The <NAME> assisted in the conversation , like a regular member of the establishment .
<NAME> <NAME> followed , with a thoughtful countenance .
Grandfather Smallweed immediately throws the cushion at her .
‘ Hope I see you well , sir , ’ said <NAME> .
I could hardly begin but <NAME> must begin too , so he soon followed .
Have you no consideration for HIS property ? '
‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
Come and kiss your Bluffy ! ''
`` Can it do any good ? ''
She then seemed to come to it all at once .
The host allowed to <NAME> that it was a little monotonous .
She resides with me again .
This is to be hushed up if it can be .
'Master of the workhouse , young man ! '
In the midst of this sensation , the beadle arrives .
Do n't say any more , if you please , <NAME> .
We 've come a long way ; never mind .
I will tell <NAME> to be careful of it .
And she has come back , a most beautiful and most elegant creature .
Of course , ’ said her father , meditating .
She is eminently calculated for a mother-in-law .
I really don ’ t know what to say , ’ replied Mrs. Curdle .
You heard him , but a little time ago .
I thall keep your brother here after the performanth .
He shook his head when I then asked him if she had recovered .
He is more courted than anyone else .
<NAME> , doomed man , while she is near !
My son is one of the last representatives of two old families .
' I must leave you now , indeed . '
No , no ; confound and curse me !
But their self-forgetfulness charmed me .
‘ It mustn ’ t be , ’ said <NAME> .
What is your love to mine ?
And he must be buried , you know . ''
Not much in that , is there ?
Let them keep always at it .
And he said , Now , this schoolroom is a Nation .
said Mrs. Sowerberry : looking piteously on the charity-boy .
‘ Here ’ s a game ! ’ roared the populace .
Then <NAME> proposed : `` A <NAME> Christmas to us all , my dears .
‘ Then good-morning , ma ’ am , ’ said <NAME> .
Oh , my Darling ! ’ Overpowered by sudden grief , he sobbed aloud .
I may have been seen to slap her face -- nothing more .
It seems like making a great disturbance about nothing particular . ''
Oh , my dear Spyers , where is the villain ! ''
'If you ever want me , I 'm here .
I depreciated <NAME> ; I depreciated <NAME> .
It is but the death , it is all the same .
‘ I can not say , ’ replied <NAME> .
' I do not think you ever will .
Yet it inspired him with an inward fortitude , that rose with his love .
Their looks are not prepossessing , and their manners are peculiar .
The celebration of a birthday in the family .
<NAME> <NAME> was for the most part plunged into deep gloom .
It would not extend beyond two people .
I saw you with money yesterday .
( I thank my honourable friend for that cheer . )
It is not in keeping .
But the likeness ends outside .
“ What is this ? ” cried <NAME> , breathless and confused .
`` <NAME> , <NAME> , I 'm sorry to see you like this .
`` I am not aware that it can . ''
I reply , then , they are not identical with those of Mr .
But the offices are shut up now , <NAME> .
There ’ s something moving in the name .
When I say we speak <NAME> and <NAME> , I mean they do .
I dare say they will report progress to-morrow morning . ''
It only brought him in wexation .
Whom I so respect and honour -- whom I so devotedly love !
‘ Ah ! ’ replied <NAME> , ‘ talk of the country , indeed !
I ’ ll give him a shilling , presently .
His mother was on the stage. ’ ‘ Was she ? ’ rejoined <NAME> .
_In_ all the public establishments of <NAME> , the utmost courtesy prevails .
`` An extremely dangerous person in any community .
_Pictures from <NAME> is also available from <NAME> as a separate eText.—DP .
But <NAME> argued the matter with me .
Not so old as you think , friend , perhaps .
And it was clear he meant to do it .
‘ Mind that , <NAME> ! ’ he added , with unusual energy .
Where the dexterity of the lawyers , eager to discover a flaw ?
“ To hear the names he 's giving me !
`` I would like to kiss her ! ''
It 's a freehold , by <NAME> ! ” “ Is it indeed ?
I am in want of nothing .
What a sweet singer you was when you first come !
But they recall no feeling of disgust or reluctance .
‘ If you can direct us , do .
She suffers him to stand by the door and asks him what he wants .
It was not too much trouble , and Mr <NAME> came up .
Joy of D. who dances round J. while he eats his supper .
He saw us , as we took leave of each other .
‘ You have forgotten the water , sir , ’ said <NAME> .
she cried , in a hollow voice .
You have been a pleasant room to me , dear room .
We are extra official. ” I cordially assented .
‘ I haven ’ t nerve to play even if I could .
`` Liz , you 're tired and ill. Let me take him . ''
‘ I must go home , ’ replied <NAME> , looking wildly round .
Mrs. Markleham -- you have not forgotten Mrs. Markleham ? ’ Forgotten the <NAME> !
<NAME> <NAME> is not here ? ''
What have these pests of the earth been doing to _you_ ?
I was ingenuous and young , and I thought so .
He found the Doctor reading in his arm-chair at a window .
I devote myself at daybreak to-morrow morning , to bringing <NAME> here .
And he is in prison . ''
“ I was new here once , ” said <NAME> .
‘ This man alarming you again !
My aunt took her hand in hers , and laughed .
I bar , ’ said <NAME> , <NAME> , thoughtfully .
I really don ’ t know , <NAME> .
said Mrs. Bumble , in a voice of command .
Then why should they quarrel with us ?
That 's a nice innocent place to live in , ai n't it ? ''
When they are shut into the back room , they speak low .
‘ Ah , my beloved Lizzie ! ’ he said , faintly .
He was taken on board , and instantly manacled at the wrists and ankles .
‘ How now ? ’ said <NAME> , looking sternly round .
The hotel ( a very excellent one ) is called the <NAME> .
You understand to what I allude , Mr Wegg ?
Give him several to take away .
‘ “ Who calls so loud ? ” ’ cried <NAME> .
But he has repressive power , and she has none .
‘ She was off somewhere at daybreak this morning .
That you can find out .
Yet what did <NAME> expect ?
To <NAME> heretofore the <NAME> , of <NAME> .
I told him seven shillings .
‘ When he ’ s well he do , ’ she answered .
Never let us be parted any more , <NAME> .
If we have n't all three met here without meaning it ! ''
‘ Oh ! ’ sneered <NAME> , looking after him as she entered .
And there was a passive congeniality between them , besides this active one .
said <NAME> when they had returned .
‘ See after your friend , and be in the way to-morrow at one .
Oh , if you knew how my heart is torn .
<NAME> him to drink it , <NAME> . '
‘ You bring Trent to me .
“ He is a traitor since the decree .
It has died in a moment without pain .
That done , he replaced the candle and took the hand again .
<NAME> <NAME> had been looking for us .
Morning came ; and the little cottage was lonely and still .
‘ Ah , <NAME> -- a precious seedy-looking customer .
Her little stock of money amounted to but a few guineas .
No favoring in this shop .
I wonder you do n't starve in your own way also .
What the deuce is it all about ?
I am incapable of designs .
<NAME> <NAME> kept his word , and remained unmarried , for two years .
‘ You ’ re the best of human creatures .
‘ None of your close shavers the <NAME> ain ’ t .
‘ Never read anything but letters and accounts .
He was obviously very ill at ease , however .
<NAME> does not see , otherwise , what he has to do with marriage .
It was <NAME> , <NAME> . ''
‘ Here they are , you see , ’ said Mr Meagles .
`` How long should I have to hold out ? ''
Come here , my little witch !
But I never own to it before her .
The child readily complied , and he went out .
‘ Then what do you think , mother , has become of ‘ em ?
I know as well that you feel none towards me .
Give him time to get rid of it , you know .
‘ Now , you are something like a genteel boy !
Unfortunately <NAME> is no snuff-taker .
<NAME> wilt uphold her here to her last hour .
Can you feel quite assured of that , my dear ? ''
The darkness found him occupied with these thoughts .
How are you now , my dear ?
Before we go , I should like to speak to him a moment .
‘ Bless thee a hundred times !
What a state of mind I was in !
Oh , he is a worthy gentleman , <NAME> !
‘ To be sure , ’ said <NAME> .
That ’ s what I feel so strong , you know !
<NAME> <NAME> could not determine this in his mind .
‘ Here ’ s <NAME> , dear Mrs Quilp , ’ said her husband .
There ’ s no such name now .
I say no more of that .
Then this respectability of <NAME> is brought into powerful play against them .
I am bent upon it -- so is <NAME> .
It is impossible ; it is a child ’ s tale .
‘ You have answered very well , <NAME> .
He ain ’ t a father to neither .
What could I say but yes !
Come on , and have it out in plain words !
She WAS worth any six , and she IS worth any six .
`` You know I do ; you see me do it . ''
I forgot Mr Pancks last time .
‘ Is there nothing else , <NAME> ? ’ I said .
‘ What shall I get by it ? ’ asked the driver .
Beadles are but men : and <NAME> smiled .
‘ They ’ ve got all the lot , <NAME> !
That cruel man with the wooden leg aggravated my sufferings .
“ You are right , ” he returned .
Everybody gave me a present .
The track of to-day had the same features as the track of yesterday .
‘ Believe ! ’ retorted the other , ‘ can anybody doubt it ?
‘ That ’ s me , ’ said the lady .
By our own schemes , I mean our joint interest .
“ Well to be sure ! ” said <NAME> , astounded .
He had been prepared to miss her very much , but not so much .
‘ Can you drink anything ? ’ was his next inquiry .
Why , then he lurked about and dogged me in the street .
Bless your eyes , here 's old <NAME> .
`` <NAME> , will you allow me ?
‘ You are cold ; I felt you tremble .
It is not until they are gone , that <NAME> moves .
Well then , I will say no more about it .
But you have not told me where he is now , <NAME> .
<NAME> YOU off now , father ? ''
But he remained too late .
Never separate the two , like the heathen waggoner .
I have heard her , many a time , talk just like him .
' I scarcely know of what , ' replied the girl .
<NAME> was about to take his chocolate .
‘ Indeed ? ’ was all she answered .
‘ This whelp is the only creature she cares for .
Everything had its appointed place and its appointed time .
And what do you intend to make of him , ma'am ?
'What fancy have you got in your head now ? '
`` What company is this , <NAME> ? ''
He had been stoned in the streets .
The week passed away in a most delightful manner .
This flower-pot and stand , she bought herself .
'And very grateful indeed , sir , for your goodness to me . '
“ Five more days , and then the day before the day !
Our own emotions are our recompense .
‘ Like a demd native ? ’ asked the husband .
Did History chronicle a king of men ?
‘ What of him ? ’ ‘ <NAME> called , ’ said <NAME> .
I rely on that promise .
He will perish : there is no real hope , ” echoed <NAME> .
I have been under a Taboo in that infernal scoundrel ’ s service .
For , the state of the man was murderous .
The top shelf in the right-hand corner -- oh ! '
The house is a ruin , and the rats fly from it .
‘ Twas evident she knew not of the disaster .
How do they call her ?
I wonder what you will say when you come to this !
' I know better , ' said <NAME> .
‘ I am , sir , ’ replied <NAME> .
I am not impertinently curious , but have a good object .
You must not stir from my side during the whole interview .
‘ Mr <NAME> ? ’ said the suitor .
<NAME> is quite sure of it .
Thank you for reminding me .
‘ And these heer pretty ones , ’ said <NAME> .
`` Why , you 're six foot two , I suppose ? ''
‘ Do you think he is in earnest , my dear Major ?
Oh so nice it was .
Twice , <NAME> knocked with a careful hand , and listened .
Still , there was no abatement in the storm , but it blew harder .
I should have had it before to be of use to me .
But tell me his name , deary ! ’ cried <NAME> .
Well , Mr Clennam , he addresses himself to the Government .
The gentlemen soon saunter after them .
What sort of stuff do you think I ’ m made of ?
Now I have answered you , answer me .
That ain ’ t the worst on it , neither .
`` You do n't mind these things ; neither does <NAME> .
The eldest Miss <NAME> is not a little girl .
'Ca n't you look at the gentleman , you obstinate boy ? '
‘ Your wretched brother , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Is that all ? ’ said the mother .
To come to tea here for ever ?
I thought I ’ d try another room , and shake it off .
“ No ; there are only two ; mother and daughter .
‘ Come on then , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> ’ t you ? ’ said the waiter .
My Aunt Astonishes Me XXXVII .
<NAME> ceased to be , within the shadow of the roof .
Never did wrap up enough ; ’ the Major being buttoned to the chin .
He had not a word .
' I can , ' said <NAME> , almost aloud .
`` Yes , my dear , '' said I .
repeats Mrs. Rouncewell , `` <NAME> !
'And what have you got , my dear ? '
But you show it. ’ ‘ Show what ?
What is her observation upon that ?
A month ’ s notice terminates my tenancy .
Is that it , my dear ? '
You confuse me , and how can I transact business if I am confused ?
You shall see the whole case clear , from first to last . ''
You may thank me for restoring him to you .
'The first question is , of what nature was her communication ? '
‘ I entreat <NAME> to bear with me in entering into these details .
I hear nothing now , indeed .
I was with him when he was sick and well , rich and poor .
They were all silent for a long while .
You never run up and down stairs for me , all day long .
‘ I shall be stronger than I was afore .
Therefore , he stayed to dinner .
I don ’ t say she has got it .
‘ The people are coming down the crescent now .
It happened to be the <NAME> ’ s birthday , too .
‘ Ah , well ! ’ he said , wiping his face .
He ’ d be afraid of you , and wouldn ’ t talk .
<NAME> himself was the chief impediment .
He 'll be here soon enough for us all . '
No one , however , had been there .
‘ I an ’ t a talker , ’ replied the other .
I ’ d go anywhere about the house the same as ever .
However , there I have ‘ em , just the same .
When she loved him , <NAME> , right well .
Are we to be exposed to this unnatural conduct every moment of our lives ?
“ Is it possible ! ” repeated <NAME> , bitterly .
A man is hungry all day long .
‘ Not a word , ’ resumed <NAME> , ‘ and never will be .
Do not mind the rain .
How little I thought what I was doing !
`` What have you been thinking about , my dear ? ''
‘ I like your conversation much .
The procession up the aisle was beautiful .
`` If you please , '' said <NAME> .
We drank the muddy water of this river while we were upon it .
I think not at all , <NAME> , '' he returned with an effort .
‘ He is shooting in <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
said he after giving us a courteous greeting .
“ The reply to this was made by him who had spoken second .
‘ Just come in , <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> .
said I when we had sat before the fire a little while .
<NAME> sighed , and shook his head despondingly .
And so _he_ goes up the postern stair .
<NAME> and <NAME> had often dealt in hides , but never in hearts .
‘ It is my duty to find out why she made that stipulation .
You are travelling for amusement and instruction .
The President will have a gentleman before him soon .
'How do you do , sir ?
The name of <NAME> is the name of the age .
I ’ ll write another to-morrow morning .
The trooper shakes his head .
`` Are there any more of you besides <NAME> ? ''
Before what ? ’ said <NAME> , putting her hand upon his arm .
At last he resolved to watch <NAME> and know more of her story .
But the <NAME> had somehow come to the knowledge that <NAME> kept a school .
I know this in much the same way , I suppose .
The very feet of the dog were bloody .
' I ask one promise , ' said <NAME> .
‘ He is only the representative of another ! ’ cried <NAME> .
That I 'll do , and render an account of course .
He then stirred the fire and left me .
I spoke to him , and he spoke to me .
`` No , no , we will try to prevent that .
`` I believe it , my dear Charley .
It follows naturally on the sights we have just left .
How unfortnet do you want me fur to be ?
‘ Quite so , ’ assented his partner .
<NAME> , you are a wag .
<NAME> do n't , father , '' urged his son .
'What do _you_ do here ? '
It was like her cordial voice in my ears .
‘ Does he deny that he did ?
He was going to say that you were not -- what ?
`` This foreign young woman has been my lodger for some weeks back . ''
'Very true , ' said the undertaker ; 'they would indeed . '
`` Of <NAME> , '' says <NAME> , hitting him again .
They have wondered how I have suffered it .
‘ Have you any other apartments , ma ’ am ? ’ he asked .
You can understand what I read aloud ? ’ ‘ Altogether .
<NAME> and you 'll hear all the bells in the city jangling . ''
‘ I admire it greatly , sir , ’ said <NAME> .
I have felt it dreadfully .
“ You may get cheated , robbed , and murdered in <NAME> .
He is such a ridiculous fellow ! ''
`` You are a good woman . ''
It may be a cheerful language .
‘ What is the matter ? ’ ‘ I don ’ t know .
As my father 's came there .
‘ He ’ s opposed to us ; he leads on the other side .
<NAME> brother to <NAME> ? ” “ Who 's he ? ” said <NAME> .
Your sister will be in , in about a quarter of an hour .
General <NAME> will help us out . ''
Before our people 's time here , sir .
Do you not know what is due to guests ?
“ Hah ! ” said Mrs. <NAME> , restoring <NAME> to his station .
'Why , what does the boy mean ? '
I adore her in it !
said <NAME> , reflectively ; 'how queer ! '
`` <NAME> of <NAME> 's <NAME> .
Physicians ’ prescriptions carefully prepared , ” and all the rest of it .
I can walk quite strongly .
‘ My life ! ’ said <NAME> , taking her in his arms .
“ I am glad I think so , <NAME> .
But he saw nothing of this .
It is so very unusual to find you here at this hour .
Is SHE working ? ’ ‘ She is , ’ says Veneering .
he ! ’ ‘ Not many , I think , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ And when does the ship sail , <NAME> ? ’ asked my aunt .
I have determined to remove this weight from my mind .
You mustn ’ t show yourself to him , child .
I am not changed towards you . ''
`` You are a vixen , a vixen ! ''
`` Dear mother , are you so resolved ? ''
And <NAME> at the door , inquiring who is within .
So dearly do I love the scene of my poverty and your kindness .
Will you come and see the gentleman , Mr .
“ It is all I could do , ” said <NAME> .
And so you shall , my darling -- when I tell you !
'There ough n't to be , if there is , ' replied <NAME> .
Surrounded by these influences , they walked on pleasantly enough .
When a boy , '' <NAME> added with great solemnity .
There was not even a closet in it .
‘ My pa -- <NAME> -- he ’ s stopping here .
I am going away again .
Being what it is , she neither knows nor cares . ''
You have lived a gentleman ; you will die a gentleman .
But those were capital days , too , in <NAME> !
Look angry at me , <NAME> .
God bless you ! ’ and withdrew .
They ’ ll be good shots one of these days .
‘ Where is my old pensioner all this while ?
What , you know him , do you ? ''
It slowly grew to that .
Go aside ! ” said <NAME> .
<NAME> of us two can repeat most poetry ?
<NAME> was truly repentant , and would not say another syllable .
Nor hurt ? ’ she asked him , anxiously .
'Oh , you have n't , have n't you ? '
`` Well , and how are you ? ''
The morning is by this time getting on apace .
And all 's fish that comes to my net .
I freely admit , I am a woman of business .
'It 's a break-up of the system altogether .
‘ I have done no worse , I have not disgraced you .
That 's all to be said at present .
<NAME> and time have taught me what to do .
It passed me , and went on to <NAME> .
‘ I see I take you with me !
There was a third , <NAME> , who I fancied would sing it .
<NAME> cleaned down with soft soap and soda .
‘ <NAME> , I think , sir , ’ replied <NAME> .
‘ What is the matter between us ? ’ said <NAME> .
“ Why need you tell me what I have not asked ?
‘ Halloa ! ’ he cried , calling him roughly back .
No shame upon her brow ; no late repentance bending her disdainful neck .
But some people will die .
Why have they not been here ? '
I am thrown away in society .
You shall see her tomorrow night .
Bother your people ! ’ interposed <NAME> , with a toss of her head .
And you ain ’ t gone , ain ’ t you ?
‘ I remember very well , sir , ’ rejoined <NAME> .
He ’ s never been heerd fur to complain .
I mourned for my child-wife , taken from her blooming world , so young .
'Good boy , <NAME> -- well done -- ' he mumbled .
Sit down , you dancing , prancing , shambling , scrambling poll-parrot !
‘ Old lady , ’ said Mr Boffin , ‘ stop that noise !
‘ I ’ ve found ‘ em out , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
I suppose sense in certain quarters ; you suppose mincing bread-and-butter nonsense .
This is a great advancement for her in life , Mr Rokesmith .
We must have <NAME> here .
Unfortunately , the property of <NAME> was settled upon herself .
‘ It ’ s like you did , <NAME> ’ r <NAME> .
They know what a clever lad he is ; he 'll be a lifer .
You call her Little Dorrit ? ’ No road in that direction .
repeated the young lady , with great stress upon the word .
<NAME> , make room for one of these gentlemen on the box .
‘ I am not too proud to believe it , <NAME> .
I have been very unhappy since she died .
‘ My brother and I are just the same .
“ Here is monsieur , who knows a well-made shoe when he sees one .
‘ We should all have been lost without <NAME> .
That ’ s what you ’ ll have to break to her .
It was the poor schoolmaster .
`` I think you had better call me guardian , my dear . ''
Nothing but flight can save us .
The bottle-green suit had been brushed , ready for the morrow .
Who set this chap on , in this dress , when the carting began ?
This was his unvarying reply .
When he was freshest and truest , he loved me .
Bail you to any amount , and only charge half a crown .
It brushes the <NAME> cobwebs away , and pleases the <NAME> .
‘ Perhaps , ’ he returned , ‘ I have said enough .
He pulled it off and showed 'em me .
<NAME> grass and rank weeds straggled over all the marshy land in the vicinity .
I can stand any fire better than a fire of cross questions .
‘ But WERE you ever married , <NAME> ? ’ says I .
‘ Yes , my lady lass , ’ returned the <NAME> .
`` Is this your young attendant ? ''
Exactly , ’ said the old man .
He rode like a highwayman .
<NAME> is the thief of time .
‘ Be careful how you go , my dear friend .
`` My dearest <NAME> , '' asked <NAME> , `` why not ? ''
Mrs. Chadband is a stern , severe-looking , silent woman .
Through all his stages , <NAME> followed him with the same strange interest .
<NAME> ’ t I , <NAME> , my dear ?
<NAME> gives a howl at the recollection .
<NAME> , a disappointed suitor , has been here to-day and has been alarming .
But that had nothing to do with it .
‘ Then they are not the Misers I mean .
‘ I ’ m sure to bring him through it , ’ said <NAME> .
said I , beginning to let down my hair .
Where I live , I mean. ’ ‘ Indeed ! ’ returned <NAME> quickly .
<NAME> had kept his chair all night .
You know Snagsby the stationer ? ''
‘ Yes , he is , <NAME> , ’ replied the landlady .
And how am I to set about it ?
Her brother and sister is high in their views , and against Our <NAME> .
There is something melancholy in it , and I don ’ t know why .
`` Not even any one who had attended on him ? ''
‘ It was as true , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ as turnips is .
Because , why should I do anything else ?
And off _its_ head comes .
`` Have you no wish in reference to your case ? ''
‘ <NAME> must have gone down to the <NAME> , sir .
Anything else we can do for him , besides giving her up ?
Still I think it charming .
'Not for the world , ' replied <NAME> .
‘ What do you think of the other ? ’ said I .
The landlord slightly inclined his head .
`` Not quite so far , I hope ? ''
`` I come from arriving at this so detestable house with your wife .
What I was thinking of was this .
'And if it is not ? '
<NAME> cats scamper across the road .
'Why , soldiers , why -- should we be melancholy , boys ? '
Mr Dombey , <NAME> Skewton. ’ The lady in the chair was gracious .
‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
When I cries out that night , “ I know you now !
‘ None of it , ’ answered <NAME> .
And of course he 's going .
‘ As to what was found in the dust now .
Reluctantly , I confessed myself quite unable to answer the question .
I dare say you would , <NAME> .
Of their appearance I shall have something to say , presently .
‘ I can ’ t help it , ’ cried Mrs. Nickleby .
Little <NAME> was not ashamed of her poor shoes .
He has time before him , and the race to run .
So every true soul ever was , ever is , and ever will be .
I was only too happy to be in such request .
Let me see thee , a ’ so good , and so forgiving .
I took a sudden resolution .
I may drop into the <NAME> , and clear off that way .
I will not say a word more .
For the rest , uncertainty and danger seemed written upon everything .
Their way lies through strange places .
Of course he might come in. ’ And so he did .
<NAME> , he believed that <NAME> had no particular pair of shoes .
It ’ s not a celebrated name .
People couldn ’ t ask one to wedding breakfasts .
But what 's the matter , <NAME> ? ''
She lives with me at my table here . ''
'Not bad , any way , ' replied <NAME> with a smile .
‘ Coming down the yard now , <NAME> , ’ replied the hostler .
‘ In what respect ? ’ asked <NAME> .
At least I had nothing in my mind that I could say .
'No , I know you 're not .
Thank you , sir , thank you .
What , are you here , <NAME> ?
The visitor offered his hand .
said the people , turning to look after her as she rushed away .
What was the end of it ?
If my daughter flies in my face , surely my husband may .
Containing the whole Science of Government 11 .
The <NAME> were a very high family , and a very large family .
Volumes could not have said more .
‘ I ’ m a intimate friend of his and his Uncle ’ s .
'Will you disclose the whole ? '
<NAME> home directly , you cruel boy !
`` I 'm very glad to hear it . ''
<NAME> ’ t give it to him .
‘ Did you ever see a ghost ? ’ was the sullen retort .
I know what that is .
It is all the same .
‘ What can we do , Trotwood ? ’ said <NAME> .
Ve-ry strong influence , is it not ?
Dear me , that 's not a common name , <NAME> , is it ?
‘ Very sad , is it not ? ’ returned <NAME> .
Let him remember it in that room , years to come .
<NAME> ! ’ at intervals all day , and ‘ Lock ho !
I didn ’ t call too loud .
I felt very ignorant , but what could I do ?
There 's no time to lose . '
I ’ m a going to seek my niece through the wureld .
What did he earn by it ?
I do <NAME> forget , though I do not read it as he did .
'And his master , too , I think you said , <NAME> ? '
`` Have you many pupils , Mr .
‘ Come here , you sir , ’ said the dwarf .
What have paupers to do with soul or spirit ?
She said she had a headache ; headaches don ’ t occasion red eyes .
He thinks he has awakened his friend .
As <NAME> appears , <NAME> hastens towards her , to bid her farewell .
said <NAME> , with a sigh .
The little spot made them the more beautiful .
Then came the tea and coffee ; and then , the ball .
His hat was off , before he opened the door ; his comforter too .
‘ Hi ! ’ cried the woman , raising a cracked voice .
‘ Nobody would , nobody could , you know .
`` Do n't you be afraid of that .
'The boy next , ' said <NAME> .
I am always wrong when you are in question .
‘ A very good fellow indeed ! ’ returned <NAME> .
The shop was close and hot .
When we repeated , with some surprise , `` The sheep ? ''
‘ It isn ’ t funny at all , ’ repeated <NAME> .
Perhaps you would n't mind <NAME> 's coming in , <NAME> ? ''
When he reached home Mrs. Maylie was sitting in the little parlour .
I could not wonder at any one loving her .
She was busily engaged in the little offices of the table .
All I mean goes beyond words , as I hope you understand and believe .
The newspaper-reading turnkey has told them all .
I should not have the courage to mention this to any one but you .
Before I leave this place , <NAME> shall hear me . '
A certain idle carelessness and recklessness of consistency soon comes of it .
In that intent <NAME> will persevere , as his duty is .
Of courthe you do ; I needn ’ t athk .
It is for his good .
<NAME> enough to be hith mother .
She looked from him to <NAME> , and her features softened .
‘ And warn ’ t there no honest man to pick it up ?
‘ When will <NAME> be back , sir ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
Besides , it is a violation of our agreement .
He flies on these occasions like an angel or a bird .
‘ Impossible to imagine , ’ said <NAME> .
He never knocked like that .
But , yes , I know I may .
And I have got it ! ''
I came down of my own accord .
But the old gentleman was not the only person who raised the hue-and-cry .
‘ Not as you are carrying it , ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> should have induced ME to touch it ! )
Here ’ s <NAME> ! ’ said <NAME> .
In face , watchful behind a blind ; habitually not uncensorious and contemptuous perhaps .
What you have overcome in yourself , can you not overcome in him ?
<NAME> <NAME> was of her opinion .
what dreadful pain it is !
I have seen two of them safely out of bed .
We found my aunt alone , in a state of some excitement .
I shall transact the business : you will transact the pleasure .
I might only weaken what is ill enough said as it is .
Not for her life , not for her life !
‘ Fine doings in a person ’ s own house ! ’ ‘ Mrs .
That my own artless <NAME> is changed to me !
It wanted but a very slight circumstance to kindle his wrath against <NAME> .
`` 'Presents her compliments to Mr .
'No , not at all , ' rejoined <NAME> .
What did you do then ?
`` If it is not being troublesome , '' said we .
‘ Oh , you prodigal old son !
<NAME> , do go away , for I am afraid of you .
that has it , ’ replied <NAME> , ‘ and ready iced too .
<NAME> , what will it be ? ''
Little <NAME> , with a piercing cry , held her back .
I beg and pray that I may stay with you !
The strange gentleman beckoned him out of his place , and <NAME> went .
It would have been better , under any circumstances , to have gone on !
The <NAME> stopped beside one little knot of business men .
Do I care for this girl , except as your friend ?
I think she gave it him .
Get up , and sit in your chair .
Again and again he listened for the sound of wheels behind .
There is the desolation of my heart and my soul .
‘ And why not ? ’ retorted <NAME> .
‘ What should you say this was ? ’ demanded Mr Swiveller .
I don ’ t appear in the business , neither do you .
But I should say their cook at the <NAME> wanted a little looking after .
After a little hesitation he opened the window , and demanded who it was .
'Am I to go with you ? '
`` How long have you known it ? ''
<NAME> thinks half so bad of me as my own father does .
Not within my hearing , that is to say . ''
After which the six-footer comes into action and is much admired .
But he had his reward .
‘ <NAME> ’ t tell me you did .
She bent over him softly , kissed him , and came to the table .
You a hold upon me !
‘ -- To be crammed , sir , ’ repeated <NAME> .
Some of the drivers are blacks , some whites .
And what ’ s this with a clarionet ?
‘ Will she call me “ <NAME> ” ? ’ cried <NAME> .
`` And now undo my bundle , <NAME> , '' said the first woman .
‘ Not if your wish is gratified , ’ replied <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> ’ s to the brim too .
thinks the trooper as he follows .
‘ He was only called the other day .
Does he see a ghost , or hear an organ ?
‘ Are you going home ? ’ he said .
That 's very pleasant , you know !
But I want to keep you in attendance .
It was all the same to him .
‘ A pet name , sir , ’ he explained again .
But try over and over again , nevertheless .
Transportation or the gallows for anybody who shall touch the property ! ''
‘ If I felt less , I could do more .
`` This has been without prejudice ? ''
cried the new comer , breathless with haste .
<NAME> must be careful. ’ ‘ How do you mean ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
But now he was ill at ease about her .
“ What ’ s that ? ” he said to me .
I canna be expecten to ’ t .
It is in <NAME> , but not of it .
There ! ’ Here <NAME> burst into tears .
The man against the child , for a bag of gold ! '
replied the voice of the <NAME> , through the key-hole .
Almost as dull as the infernal old jail .
All the better for her !
‘ We meet and part to-night , ’ she said .
It is a great privilege .
<NAME> suspicion may exist without that connexion . ''
My convict never looked at me , except that once .
Taking the furniture with them , of course ?
Because such inclinations are among the vicious qualities of mankind .
I ’ m not indeed , ’ said <NAME> .
I shall accompany you. ’ ‘ You ! ’ said <NAME> .
`` So you kept him after all ? ''
The new flower sprang from the deep-planted and long-cherished root , she knew .
I had not meant that , and was rather taken by surprise .
Seven-and-sixpence to me , old Isaac .
<NAME> , <NAME> , aw a muddle !
“ But I do n't know how to originate , in such a case .
She died when I was born .
‘ Perhaps a little damp and ague-ish ? ’ said <NAME> .
The two days became three , and the three days became four .
‘ By-the-bye , I HAVE thought of somebody too .
Let some one hold him back .
'Forgive me for saying so , but I wish you had . '
But I do not believe this .
Unless it was , I might not be bold enough to say it .
Here , take hold of my hand , <NAME> .
We asked him if he knew what was doing in it .
And he was so modest , too .
Mrs <NAME> listened attentively , until she had finished .
I call upon you , sir , therefore , to pint out the good .
' I have no brother , ' replied <NAME> .
What is there in all this ?
Let it lie there , let it lie .
It is the boat we wait for !
I had thought about that , while we had been there side by side .
‘ The old story ; always thinking , and never doing .
<NAME> <NAME> adopted <NAME> as his son .
I believe I was kept at home for that purpose .
I applied the key on hearing this and opened the door .
And how can I pay ?
`` What are you talking of ? ''
I wish I was dead .
I was a boyish husband as to years .
The way was purposely confused , no doubt .
It was a kind of festive occasion , and the parties were attired accordingly .
<NAME> waited some little while before he spoke again .
I have had enough of arguing to last one man his life . ''
Did I say we could depend upon no better man ?
I am never mealy with ’ em .
I do not go with Mrs. Jellyby in her treatment of her young family .
But please to drive on -- quick , please !
However , that ’ s neither here nor there , just now .
'That 's the second , ' observed the woman with much deliberation .
I can not read what I have written with this gaunt hand .
Is that so much that he deserves this praise ? ''
Do you know what that tune is , Mr .
That she may be able to recognise the faces and know the persons .
'Coals , candles , and house-rent free , ' said <NAME> .
Mrs Clennam still sat intent .
( More blushes in the bean-stalk country ! )
The same that I expect . ''
‘ I ought to know this writing .
‘ Ay , ay ! ’ cried the boy , in the same tone .
Her cutting , gentlemen , was simplicity itself .
Never had visitors a more hospitable reception .
They were much soiled , but otherwise unhurt .
No , <NAME> , to none .
<NAME> <NAME> , with his mouth open , looking for somebody to speak next .
A great wind rises , and the summer is gone in a moment .
‘ Mrs Quilp. ’ ‘ Yes , <NAME> , ’ said the timid sufferer .
<NAME> was there , and had his usual effect upon me .
The church itself was not more quiet .
This time she really is going to speak to him .
It shall be a parlour-curtain lecture .
`` I do n't know , my <NAME> ; I can scarcely hope so .
‘ I am almost afraid to disturb him , ’ said the child timidly .
‘ What a timid little goose our Amy is !
‘ Poor , poor Walter ! ’ sighed <NAME> .
'And to-morrow two months it was done ! '
‘ That won ’ t do , ’ returned the lady .
‘ In pumping water out of the <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> .
‘ Go on , sir , go on .
he thinks , with a pitying sadness .
Because he felt any new compunction towards it ?
She has lots of expensive knowledge , sir , political and otherwise .
`` I suppose it 's chops at the <NAME> 's Arms . ''
Again -- these three white little loaves are for <NAME> .
'Oh , come in with you ! '
‘ Hear , hear , ’ assented <NAME> ’ s client .
Mr Dorrit will allow me to withdraw. ’ ‘ Hum .
This coach is rather behind its time to-day , I guess .
You were the first to mention her name .
Mr Dombey would be delighted to leave <NAME> in such admirable guardianship .
This time , as before , <NAME> turned back along with him .
`` Go on , if you please , '' said I .
The same face : the very same .
‘ What else do you suppose I think I am made for ?
Is not your sorrow mine ?
<NAME> <NAME> ’ s a little restless in his sleep .
‘ Be careful , sir , ’ said <NAME> , looking steadily at him .
I told you , you could n't tire me , you know .
Let me look at you .
He is what they call a barrister , with nothing to do .
I have done a similar thing myself , in construction , often .
These stairs are a part of the bridge ; they consist of three flights .
But it ’ s very near the sea .
<NAME> comes up to make herself useful , and falls to work immediately .
'Well , I suppose it is , ' growled <NAME> .
‘ Whatever you want most , if I could be that .
The fact is , you ain ’ t enough here , <NAME> .
<NAME> will turn you , won ’ t it ?
I am not quite sure , because the wolf and you change forms .
'We shall see , ' returned the old gentleman with a searching glance .
Those are the lights of <NAME> . '
`` This other gentleman is in the preaching line , I think ? ''
`` Because I thought there war n't enough of you , perhaps ? ''
I was certain of it .
A moment of profound silence followed .
‘ He isn ’ t , ’ said <NAME> indignantly .
You will do him no harm .
If he says , 'Skimpole , join the dance ! '
And another thing , my dear .
“ I am a <NAME> , ” said <NAME> , “ I am desperate .
‘ Is it ? ’ said <NAME> .
I shall wait for some encouragement and hope .
The fault is mine , and only mine .
<NAME> , Mrs. Smithie , and the <NAME> , ’ was the next announcement .
Such <NAME> as he and Ma make of themselves ! ''
This observation must be limited exclusively to his daughter .
Thus the whelp had gone out of the circle before the people moved .
inquired the man with the keys .
<NAME> <NAME> ran hastily upstairs , and with a trembling hand opened the bag .
It would have been flat heresy to do so .
I hardly know how to say it .
`` Home , for good and all .
It is quite still and silent .
Who was his friend with him ?
Why it may be his <NAME> one of these days , in part .
I date my recovery from the receipt of that intelligence .
I 'll never go another step in opposition to it .
It was like passing from death to life ; it was drawing nearer Heaven .
Not the faintest rustle broke the profound tranquillity of the solemn scene .
On the contrary , they are most acceptable .
<NAME> withdrew his head , but thrust it in again .
‘ I suppose it is , now you mention it .
At the moment , the bell rang loudly in the hall .
He saw her bosom throb , and saw her face flush and turn white .
What can you possibly want to know of circuses then ?
‘ Declines to marry ? ’ another guesses .
Between the room and the men there were strong points of general resemblance .
But his name is <NAME> . ''
Over the young ladies , I see a Missis .
Their goings-on had been going on for some time .
‘ I can ’ t keep her avay from me .
said <NAME> , apparently refreshed .
‘ I were very patient wi ’ her .
‘ There ’ s no more to tell , <NAME> .
Can I in no way repay your confidence ?
If you 'll only let me cry a little longer .
Mr <NAME> was slinking about the hearthrug , waiting to welcome <NAME> .
'Him that I told the young lady of before . '
<NAME> dear ! ’ <NAME> stood for a moment , immovable .
‘ To our house , where you came this morning .
for shame ! ’ <NAME> brightened up and smiled .
Consternation was in every face .
Is that all you say ?
No difference in this respect between the base metals and the precious .
The waiter returned , and ushered three gentlemen into the room .
Perhaps you have often thought the same .
Go up stairs and get me my bonnet and shawl .
‘ Ah , to be sure ! ’ returned the Patriarch .
‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , beckoning me aside into a window .
And yet I am rash to say so .
`` I have achieved that reputation , I suppose . ''
'Let me say a prayer .
I should like a glass of water .
She , who coils her fascinations round me like a pure angelic rattlesnake !
‘ Till it poured down like rain , ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> , they know me at the stage-door I suppose .
It was exactly reproduced in the dress he now wore .
‘ The <NAME> was very good to me .
It would be mean to suspect him .
The door yielded to the pressure , and they passed in together .
) , I shall away betimes tomorrow morning .
‘ <NAME> ’ at all , <NAME> , ’ replied his attendant .
WHY should the <NAME> have refused the note ?
exclaims <NAME> , clapping her hands after a twentieth repetition of this remark .
‘ Sam ! ’ cried <NAME> , calling after him , ‘ <NAME> !
Well ; all sorts of humbugs profess morality .
The means of happiness are on the cards and the dice .
I had had the key that was found , made long before .
What is their unanimous declaration ?
I deserve a bow now and then .
Do you see ? ’ ‘ I understand , ’ said <NAME> .
Once more I say , time presses .
‘ Then he has done nothing .
By and by she tries again .
`` How de do , gentlemen , how de do !
‘ There ’ s a footstep ! ’ exclaims <NAME> .
No one knows how ‘ tis .
<NAME> Bitherstone formerly of ours .
How did the verdict go , sir ?
Let us advance by steps .
You can hold a knife to that black eye , as you run along .
My unhappy mother told me that in my illness she had been nearly frantic .
`` Quite strong enough for that , miss ! ''
‘ Nor want anything , ’ cried the boy .
I wo n't squeeze you tighter than I can help .
<NAME> , I beg your pardon , sir !
And thus for a fortnight matters went on .
‘ I ’ m not a going to hurt you .
“ <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> and <NAME> .
I only ask you , my second mother , to consider .
I ought to have more fortitude and self-command than that .
You have n't got no occasion to be up to it .
`` I pouring out of window !
Of all the world , unchanged .
`` You have n't looked in at all ? ''
Secondly , to pay the rent -- here it is .
‘ Stay here the while , all !
The <NAME> disappears , and in a few moments returns .
At this humorous feat he laughed outright .
<NAME> <NAME> was giving it , with all due secrecy and circumspection .
I suppose we had some notion that this was to end in marriage .
‘ Get me a coach. ’ ‘ A coach !
No one can assist you ; you are to work it out for yourselves .
So we are not much alike in that particular .
cried my guardian , quite triumphant .
This young gentleman has to accomplish a destiny .
He had not previously uttered a word .
Wake up , some of you ! ''
I do ; I say again , I do .
`` The airs the fellow gives himself ! ''
I have been wretched , too .
Turn me in some other direction before I go. ” “ Well then !
‘ Does she sing at all ? ’ I asked .
' A nice person to prefer a charge against a poor boy ! '
'Not at all , my dear , ' said <NAME> humbly .
'You can do nothing to help me .
This deed was done last night at ten o'clock .
‘ They are a depraved , worthless set .
Still , nobody appeared , to claim the dusty youngster from <NAME> , <NAME> .
‘ I should hope so , ’ returned Mr Toots .
As to all the rest—What will be , will be .
‘ What do you mean , boy ? ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Go away , and shut the door .
Their conference was very short , but very decided .
They hurried away , through several streets , without stopping or speaking .
I was disagreeable too , <NAME> ; we were all of us disagreeable together .
And then they fell to shaking hands most heartily again .
I am invested with no authority for diverging from them .
I swear it before the God that saw it !
But my understanding for all this was gone .
I was on the wrong side of the post .
'If your inclinations chime with your sense of duty -- ' <NAME> began .
He rarely joined them on the Saturdays now .
<NAME> E. S. <NAME> was nominated and supported by <NAME> .
Now , brother Ned , my dear fellow , I ’ m ready .
‘ You have purposely cast a dreadful suspicion upon my mother ’ s house .
First , not a word more from you about the past .
I am almost sure he will grant it now , if I ask him .
Every possible inquiry was made , and every place was searched .
He tried to shut it out , but it would stream in .
I do n't care for what you say at all .
`` Much obliged to you , ma'am ! ''
<NAME> tumbrils carry the day 's wine to <NAME> .
She never left him all that night .
Do not keep me here , but let me go at once .
I never thought of it , before or afterwards .
Let me whisper in your ear . '
There was a beautiful propriety in that .
God bless you , dear Mr Clennam .
I say , he struck me .
When he had gone a little way , he looked back .
Has he been here , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Here , in this room .
‘ <NAME> , you sir ! ’ said <NAME> , for the third time .
In their orderly and punctual progress they brought round <NAME> and twilight .
'Do not think of that .
<NAME> will see to your accommodation .
I just makes out to cry , “ I know you now !
‘ Only myself , ’ he assented with a sigh .
This is the young lady .
“ Ay ! ” returned the sergeant , “ two .
Does our fiendish contemporary wince ?
says <NAME> , biting his thumb with the appetite of vexation .
<NAME> <NAME> shakes his head .
I should like to see it .
‘ Not on no account , ’ replied <NAME> .
said <NAME> , involuntarily falling from her strange companion .
How well I recollect the kind of day it was !
I had seen <NAME> frequently .
‘ Nothing the matter , ’ replied <NAME> .
But he was a tight-fisted hand at the grind-stone , <NAME> !
‘ -- ‘ <NAME> , ain ’ t ? ’ With a stupid stare .
He , a broken , bankrupt , sick , dishonoured prisoner .
“ Disguise from you is impossible .
‘ Nor I neither , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ I imagined all this when he was a boy .
His soul is a great deal too large for his frame .
‘ How do you mean ? ’ rejoined <NAME> .
I made it in a moment .
making her eyes very large .
That morning ’ s breakfast passed heavily off .
said this worthy , nodding to the Jew .
Far from it. ’ ‘ Six children , sir ? ’ exclaimed <NAME> .
I should break through the wall to come to you .
But she 's alive , and I know her . ''
‘ <NAME> ! ’ said <NAME> , with dignity .
Let this intercede for me .
I do n't attach any value to money .
`` What does <NAME> mean ? ''
No such artificial means would bring sleep to his eyes .
said my guardian with his good-humoured smile .
`` Now , I wonder who it can be about ? ''
Say no more , <NAME> , say no more , my child .
We stand around the grave .
‘ Of course , my dear <NAME> ; of course .
But neither ever broached the theme .
I ’ ll be judged by the gentleman himself .
“ A perfect fleet , ” said he .
‘ Dis-gusting ! ’ ejaculated both the young ladies .
But she was not to be so easily left .
It was a nice sickly season just at this time .
‘ I hope there is ! ’ replied Kate .
I have not the honour of Mrs <NAME> ’ s good opinion .
‘ I can ’ t , I daren ’ t. ’ ‘ Help !
YOU want more painstaking and search-making !
‘ Ay , ’ rejoined <NAME> , taking his arm .
Tried to nudge you , but you wouldn ’ t .
Both times at night , when I was going back .
Now attend a moment ! ’ said the old man .
Is it coming on you , <NAME> ?
said the Jew , scowling fiercely on the boy .
<NAME> ! ’ prevented his relapse into a doze .
Her boy may have learnt no better !
Ten o'clock at night ? ” “ Yes , sir .
‘ The consequences may be dreadful , ’ said <NAME> .
( In this he was very warmly supported by Mr and <NAME> . )
But she was too high !
what shall I do ! ’ thinks <NAME> , clasping her hands .
It would be impossible to save the family credit for a day .
I do not say that anything is to be done .
Will you take no counsel with me ?
We felt our inexperience , and were unable to help ourselves .
‘ Dear Fanny , what is the matter ?
It hears , my dear child , all sorts of shocking things .
said <NAME> , feeling in his breast with a look of alarm .
He was the first to speak , and he spoke thus : ‘ Yes .
In a moment , the whole company were on their feet .
‘ Much more than for any other .
I find a woman. ’ The colour overspread her face .
<NAME> is devoted to him .
‘ You have said more than enough to him on business , before now .
It might cut somebody , by accident .
By the light of the fire he can be seen looking towards the moonlight .
‘ There may be , in the coffee-room. ’ MAY BE .
'What business is it of yours ? '
I have only just come to a decision to take one .
The fellow sends a most abandoned villain with one eye to construct a gateway .
'There now , <NAME> , ' remonstrated <NAME> , eagerly catching at the word .
At first , none but the surgeon went close to it .
‘ Now let us see , ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> and hours , days and nights , he remained in this same condition .
‘ Is there nothing I can do ? ’ asked <NAME> .
inquired <NAME> , with well-timed jocularity .
‘ Did I indeed , sir ? ’ said <NAME> .
You see I know enough to know much more with very little help .
I am much better here , ’ said <NAME> , faintly .
Always think of me as quite an old man .
<NAME> , hi ! ’ <NAME> once more , savagely .
We must , in a measure , assist to turn them up .
They told me he was there .
Father , he did gain it .
She ran in , and was running out again when she saw me .
<NAME> remember what I said to you .
We both grub on in a muddle .
Upon these were laid knives and forks for six or eight people .
<NAME> ’ t let him come up till I ’ ve got away .
‘ We ’ ll go together , ’ repeated <NAME> .
Let us draw further back .
`` I hope he did n't die of anything catching ?
‘ Did you ever hear of the great commercial house of <NAME> & <NAME> ?
He had all the cares of the world on his head in three months .
‘ What is your great mode of smoothing and managing , <NAME> ?
`` What have I to do with that , or what have you ?
`` But that is a long time .
‘ He wouldn ’ t blow up alone .
‘ That is because you are good ; not because I am !
Sometimes there is n't any milk , and sometimes the cat drinks it .
That it is in the stare of the pictures .
‘ Is it not likely that it should be ?
‘ Now , young man , ’ said the porter .
<NAME> looked about him for the <NAME> , and saw it not .
‘ This is a dry game .
What is that ? ’ returns <NAME> .
‘ He was there once before , ’ said my aunt presently .
‘ In the river , ’ somebody rejoins .
'By all means , ' observed <NAME> , with great alacrity .
I see he is listening , but can ’ t hear .
<NAME> was in attendance , and loitered about until the expected train came in .
‘ How very odd you are to-day , my dear !
`` That 's very like <NAME> , '' says <NAME> .
How could it be otherwise ?
And he did it ; yes , he did !
`` Why , what do you mean ? ''
It is not usual to cancel articles for any such reason .
I have no lover , of course .
‘ He is only glad to see me .
<NAME> , thrusting Mr Flintwinch aside , proceeded straight up-stairs .
`` Talk of the angels , '' says <NAME> .
said the girl , with an expression of pleasure at his return .
‘ Stay a moment , <NAME> ; stay another moment .
I ’ m glad he has lost his mistress .
He has had a fever .
“ Indeed I am lost here .
To return to the letter .
Each doing what she suggested , there was no want of assistance .
`` Sir , I have told you why .
‘ I don ’ t like it , Mr Venus .
Do you recollect him ? ’ No .
They were very fond of one another : that was certain .
There must be many ways of doing it .
If I were but legally executor of <NAME> ’ s will !
And as to the brim of his hat , it ’ s narrow .
That 's my mother. ” “ Oh ! ” said he , coming back .
`` You will excuse me , <NAME> , '' observes <NAME> .
There was another blank silence before her father rejoined : “ I believe it .
‘ In such good spirits ! ’ said <NAME> .
I thought of it much afterwards .
All others he was willing to forget .
<NAME> <NAME> was suspected , with three companions .
I know she ’ s a naughty , mischief-making old thing !
Would you recommend his being spoken to , or his being left alone ?
She was followed by the whelp .
‘ Your lovely woman was told her fortune to night on her way home .
And what ’ s this straggling about in an idle sort of a way ?
It was far otherwise with little <NAME> .
`` Pray think , once more , <NAME> , '' said I .
You will go , wo n't you ? ''
exclaimed the doctor , aghast in his turn .
Externally , <NAME> showed no signs of being mellowed by these glowing vintages .
<NAME> , <NAME> , I have ruined <NAME> !
That is what it means .
‘ They are sitting up beyond their usual hour , I suppose .
She has not money , you have not youth .
You go and tramp , ' he ses .
returned <NAME> , opening her eyes .
“ I think you have got the ague , ” said I .
It was a prison for men .
It was ten o ’ clock when I went out .
! ’ ‘ Nonsense ! ’ said <NAME> , turning back again .
The business will get rather complicated if I ’ ve many more customers .
The unwelcome visitors advanced into the middle of the room .
A happy New Year to all the world .
How could they be near us , and be green and fresh ?
`` He appears to be an excellent master , '' I observed .
But not as she did .
I have a right to complain of it as almost a breach of confidence .
But the figure that he seeks is not among them .
Not that that is much though , I am sure .
He thought besides , ‘ This is a very odd beginning .
He sat up in bed and listened .
‘ How are you , <NAME> ? ’ said he .
I should have liked to know her .
'Has it long gone the half-hour ? '
The vendor observing this , increased in loquacity .
You must accommodate the visit to the demands upon my time .
‘ He ’ s in a cab , sir , at the door .
This <NAME> was at the <NAME> de Ville , and might be loosed .
An Appearance in the <NAME> 29 .
`` That 's the whole of it . ''
‘ All right , ’ was the reply .
‘ <NAME> for ever ! ’ roared the honest and independent .
Tell me more of your history .
'That 's the boy , is it ? '
‘ Eh ! ’ said <NAME> , with a look of virtuous surprise .
Should possibilities be worse to bear than certainties ?
I would give them my aunt .
I say the children ; I have two little daughters .
`` Pray , pray tell me more . ''
' I would not for the world , sir , ' replied <NAME> .
‘ Now , is it all thought out ?
‘ Show the gentlemen into the parlour , <NAME> , ’ said the landlady .
Let us waste no words about it .
How can you consistently ask me such a question ?
It said , `` What the de-vil are you crying for ? ''
Keep this quiet , and make no inquiry for me ; it is useless .
Let me think -- what was the year again ! '
So will my daughter <NAME> be .
asked the other man in a hoarse voice .
I am as giddy as a drunken man .
‘ Yes , ’ said Mr Carker , ‘ we have received it !
said <NAME> , clenching his fist .
He is the father of my twins !
He needed no persuasion , and was soon asleep .
‘ Not I , <NAME> , thank you , ’ said <NAME> , laughing .
I will make no such pretence to you .
<NAME> clasped his hands , and sank feebly backward .
‘ Shall I speak of our affairs , mother ?
He left his brother to be happy .
`` This is a very sensible woman , '' said my guardian .
‘ I hope I am also , ’ rejoined the other .
said <NAME> , improving the accident .
‘ Well , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
I took the opportunity of moving well behind my table .
They renewed their charitable efforts , and he beat them off .
The <NAME> , and the <NAME> LVII .
I understand there were some of our very best men among ‘ em .
'So it is , ' acquiesced the undertaker .
`` What could you have on your mind , you know !
‘ The message relates to family matters , ’ said <NAME> , hesitating .
cried the office keeper , running out .
That I am too old ? ” said <NAME> .
Pick me up ; I want to hear better .
‘ There is no longer any occasion for uneasiness , ma ’ am .
The <NAME> resented her claiming to know people of such distinction .
She had never breathed her dread of him to any one but <NAME> .
And the <NAME> was above all !
<NAME> said the <NAME> had a secret ?
He shrunk , as if to let the thing go by .
‘ You mean Mrs. Nickleby ? ’ said <NAME> .
Oh , I assure you he is very odd ! ''
You pusillanimous , abject , cringing dogs !
It ’ s in the lining of the mattress , <NAME> .
Do n't break cover too soon .
After a few words of course , they sallied into the street .
Very rarely tells him anything more explicit .
`` You seek to close these places on the <NAME> Day ? ''
‘ He ’ ll be doing something desperate ; he ’ ll murder somebody .
'No , no , ' rejoined <NAME> , finding his voice .
Do you see those grovelling and wandering eyes ?
'What is the name to me ? '
We must not let you pass out of our knowledge .
The dream will have come again .
‘ You have a son , I believe ? ’ said Mr Dombey .
But the <NAME> forbid that I should repine under any visitation .
Blind leaders of the blind !
And she evidently thought so , for she wept most grievously .
The <NAME> ’ s breath came short and thick with consternation .
The first sitting was limited .
She sends you her regard .
and away with me ! ’ ‘ To-night ? ’ murmured the old man .
‘ You are not going , papa ? ’ said <NAME> , anxiously .
She falters , trembles , and puts her hand confusedly to her head .
Mrs <NAME> ’ s niece , <NAME> , took cold pork .
My mother dropped her work , and arose hurriedly , but timidly I thought .
<NAME> , hope , and charity , shared his whole nature among them .
`` By all means , <NAME> . ''
‘ The monk turned to the second sister .
As fast asleep as she is now , I hope ! ''
I wrote to <NAME> as soon as <NAME> and I were engaged .
You here again ? ” said <NAME> .
I am rational again now , and you shall advise me .
My trade is not of that kind that I need be roused from bed .
‘ You are a young man , ’ she said , nodding .
‘ My dear , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ I ’ m very sorry .
We may have detained her longer than she expected already . '
You spoke of my sister ’ s tears .
Her nerves is so very delicate , you see , and soon unstrung .
“ What floor do you want ? ” “ The top .
I told her not to come near us till he was dead .
She and his father had been at variance from his earliest remembrance .
She , too , was turning homeward , when she heard a strange sound .
<NAME> , pray , be cautious ! ” cried <NAME> .
‘ They were all fine babies , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ How do we know whom he is deceiving there ?
‘ Go on , <NAME> ; do go on .
‘ And yet I have some respect here .
For it 's quite impossible that I can put my papers away . ''
He may think of her constantly , or he may never think about her .
‘ So you said just now , my dear , ’ replied <NAME> .
‘ She is pale though , and looks much exhausted .
Are you going to return there ? ''
how devoutly he wished he could !
‘ I ’ ll tell ‘ ee more ; hear this , too .
Somewhere must be thought of .
He sat in his usual place and attitude like a great stuffed figure .
`` Pretty well , grandmother , I think . ''
V. The <NAME> Those were drinking days , and most men drank hard .
He took her mantle from the wall , and tenderly wrapped it round her .
And she has acted up to it glorious ! ''
‘ He is quite well , <NAME> , thank you , ’ said <NAME> .
The spinster aunt was knitting .
Oh dear , how very kind of you !
<NAME> <NAME> is the type and model of a young drummer .
She -- have you seen her , <NAME> ? '
We must have <NAME> , you know .
`` I will not hear you say such shameful words ! ''
‘ Get up , pig ! ’ growled the first .
They are nothing but good to me .
`` How do you do , sir ?
‘ <NAME> us on what grounds you make this accusation , ’ said <NAME> .
Why does he move so softly to-night ?
Do not speak of money at present .
‘ And if it be a necessity— ’ <NAME> faltered .
<NAME> , <NAME> , admission for admission .
This desperate threat effectually broke up the party .
<NAME> is no object here .
The subject did not admit of a doubt .
`` Jo , can you say what I say ? ''
“ <NAME> out of this office .
‘ Very sorry , ’ said the crestfallen <NAME> .
I have stood between your father and mother for a number of years .
But you began by saying that we took different views , you know .
My low tap at the door was answered by <NAME> .
The fact is , the girl was washing the glasses .
It is well meant , I have no doubt , but I reject it .
he said , speaking in a homely , rustic way and with great vehemence .
But no hand was there , and it opened no more .
<NAME> ’ t I say so ? ’ Here Mrs. <NAME> sobbed .
I never do ; I never have done .
But I can ’ t think about the lesson .
‘ Ay ay , we ’ ll take care of the old woman .
A man of the name of <NAME> .
I mean to pay him too , ’ retorted <NAME> .
<NAME> curious , your delightful sex is ! ''
Would you object to my writing it ? ''
But she couldn ’ t control herself to go any further .
‘ Excuse my putting it to you , <NAME> , but now really !
And keep as near me , as you can . '
We see enough ! ’ cried <NAME> .
<NAME> ! ’ looking into the lines .
‘ Not this morning , ’ he said to the dog .
So strange , to have the road-dust on his feet instead of the coal-grit .
`` When did he come from <NAME> ? ''
Nothing more was said between the happy pair .
‘ <NAME> ’ said <NAME> ; and down they sat .
I looked up , and met her sharp bright glance respectfully .
A happy party they were , that night .
‘ Dear Miss Trotwood , is that all the history ? ’ said <NAME> .
‘ “ A man , ” replied the figure .
<NAME> , let us be courageous .
That time passed , and her little Lucie lay on her bosom .
‘ <NAME> and gentleman ? ’ inquired <NAME> , almost breathless with impatience .
So was <NAME> , for he was seldom otherwise .
Why have I alluded to it ?
`` Then , cousin <NAME> -- '' <NAME> laughingly began again .
I told you so beforehand , my dear , ’ said <NAME> .
But that ’ s not all , sir .
'Go to him , ' Biddy say , 'without loss of time . '
‘ I am certain of it .
cried <NAME> , to all appearance much relieved .
inquired my guardian , almost sternly .
I write the exact truth .
Carrying these with <NAME> ’ s aid , he passed up to his dwelling .
And why have you done it ?
more shame for him , ’ thought <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> word , my dear sir , very harsh word indeed .
Not so , by any means .
<NAME> day to you , gentlemen ; good day ! ''
<NAME> ’ t you speak to him ?
It had vanished from the earth .
<NAME> went on , and the turnkey began to fail .
You will find the cold mutton on the table . ''
'Will she be buried to-morrow , or next day , or to-night ?
'He has brought me to this lonely place to murder me ! '
There is a splendid wedding in the church .
I am in now , as one of the regulars. ’ ‘ Oh !
Was he prejudiced against the race of lawyers ?
We all three went home together next day .
He went away in high spirits .
‘ <NAME> ’ s the matter with me , ’ replied <NAME> nervously .
Think of this now , <NAME> and Mrs. Micawber .
<NAME> <NAME> L. <NAME> 's <NAME> .
‘ Good-bye ! ’ ‘ Good-bye ! ’ said the pretty housemaid .
They lingered about , in the fields , for some hours .
Without other announcement or ceremony , <NAME> walks in .
His blood is infected , and objects lose their natural aspects in his sight .
Now then , just you hear a word or two from me .
Here somebody cried out , ‘ Shame , <NAME> !
Were you one of many children ? ’ He shook his head .
They left that fancy ware to boys and girls , and boarding-schools and books .
`` A tremendous family to provide for ! ''
`` Do n't shake your head , '' said <NAME> .
His thoughts , as yet , have no wider range than home .
<NAME> out of his house .
His sister gently touched him on the shoulder , and pointed to it .
Through the munificence of Mr Boffin .
You seem to know all about ‘ em , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Yes , Miss. ’ And threw back his head and laughed .
And where ’ s the good of it ?
‘ Yes , <NAME> , it is , ’ replies <NAME> , advancing .
It was a case of jealousy .
‘ Sam ! ’ said <NAME> , calling over the banisters .
What do you mean by this noise , you hussies ? '
‘ <NAME> has gone for an airing on the <NAME> .
When his hollow voice broke silence , they all three started .
<NAME> laid his hand upon his shoulder .
The house was silent as the grave .
Why not , when you can have one so devoted to you !
No , he scorned the base insinuation .
I couldn ’ t have done it , <NAME> .
'Did you tell him to lock her and bar her in ? '
<NAME> ith a bad piethe of bithnith , thith ith .
This here conduct of yourn won ’ t suit my book , <NAME> .
Come ! ’ ‘ Yes , <NAME> , ’ returned the <NAME> .
I hope you didn ’ t take cold .
‘ Mr Wegg , ’ said <NAME> , with another flush .
I do n't tell it you on information received .
Who should we bury , <NAME> ? ’ returned the sexton .
It can be proved , sir .
She said them slightingly , but not with displeasure .
I should have been more fit for Heaven than I ever have been since .
<NAME> took the bit off , and put it in her mouth .
‘ You mean something more , as concerns myself and my intention .
That 's the time of day .
No veiled future dimly glanced upon him in the moonbeams .
<NAME> must have irritated him , -- made faces at him .
I may not see her again for a long , long time .
`` I am fond of boating .
He is a child , you know ! ''
<NAME> electors of the borough of <NAME> .
It was then calm , radiant sunset .
‘ Fanny is not going to live with us just now , father .
‘ If you please , partner , ’ said <NAME> , rubbing his hands .
‘ I was going to do so .
What dear flowers ! ’ said <NAME> .
Yes , they do happen to be bloody .
‘ There are bad tidings in that letter. ’ ‘ Yes .
Yes , it is , it is .
Are you sure that it would not be better to try that course ?
What childhood did you ever leave to me ?
Grandfather Smallweed inquires , slowly rubbing his legs .
Then I watch ; then I hide , until he walks and smokes .
<NAME> , <NAME> , run , in <NAME> ’ s name !
Your lodging ( which I have arranged for ) will be paid by me .
I believe I have as much influence with your Papa as anybody has .
He remained at the bottom , apparently drowned , for at least ten minutes .
troubled me none the less because I went on .
He lies a little turned away , but his eyes are surely open .
Just as anybody might. ’ ‘ Precisely so , ’ said <NAME> .
But I must not take that at a word .
‘ Now , darlings ! ’ said the gentleman with the black hair .
I feared you would think too much of what passed here just now .
The Orfling was likewise accommodated with an inexpensive lodging in the same neighbourhood .
No words can describe the <NAME> ’ s consternation at this sight .
Why , he knows you have come home .
Numbers of people were lost in the <NAME> Office .
‘ Let me do something for you , at least , ’ said <NAME> .
She hesitates , but he motions again , and she sits down .
But it might have been. ’ ‘ Of how much ? ’ ‘ Oh !
This would not do , it was quite clear .
‘ Do you mean mine ? ’ asked <NAME> .
From him , ’ she said , with a laugh .
`` Let me see , <NAME> , '' said I , pretending to consider .
There were samples of cheap clocks , and samples of cheap vases of flowers .
`` That 's a bad presentiment , mother . ''
Her father thought so as he looked at her .
I was there , as I have mentioned , at all hours .
‘ He had hardly read it when he was called away .
Two minutes hence may be too late .
How can I get that reading , <NAME> ?
‘ I make false statements , it appears ?
I remember the place well. ’ Looking very curiously round it .
She does n't notice a word !
The poor side , you say ?
Would you ! ’ <NAME> had caught him round the body .
She sees nothing and hears nothing .
She is gone with me upon a distant voyage .
‘ He ’ s here , sir , ’ rejoined Mr Swiveller .
I only know that I don ’ t like it .
One of her sisterhood knitted beside her .
I will take you there directly , without a minute 's loss of time .
I really will , you know ! ’ she answered .
And she may have the pain of knowing that he does so . '
So this calling follows the rest .
`` He has none , and no anger .
The young gentleman uttered this exultant sound with mysterious significance .
For I naturally said , `` Esther !
<NAME> <NAME> understood her quite as well as if she had said a thousand .
said <NAME> , caustically ; after an attentive perusal of <NAME> 's features .
I suppose I shall hear a knock here .
I was not insensible , indeed .
What I suffered from that placard , nobody can imagine .
It has aged me , tired me , vexed me , disappointed me .
It ’ s nigh six in the morning. ’ ‘ Is it though ?
‘ <NAME> ’ t alarm me at the very beginning .
To which <NAME> retorts , `` I say so ! ''
I have been alone , and indifferent to it .
But , perhaps , nobody 's ever did ?
I understand your allusion , my love .
I shall come to no harm .
something of that sort , ' replied <NAME> .
A hurry and contradiction pervaded all his thoughts .
I am sure I can not imagine what the cause of it is .
‘ <NAME> , ’ replied the unwelcome visitor .
I will not disgrace your recommendation .
I have been in prison for contempt of court .
They all returned his look .
‘ “ My love , ” said the baron .
`` Begging your pardon for interrupting you a moment ? ''
‘ Now , gentlemen , ’ said <NAME> , looking at them attentively .
The scientific gentleman was a bachelor .
‘ Come , dear boy ! ’ said <NAME> .
‘ “ Family of Mr Gallanbile , MP .
He never thought of <NAME> .
‘ What ! ’ said Mr Carker , who had heard this .
It has been too short and easy .
<NAME> , dear , I am changed .
He was going to <NAME> and to <NAME> as a surgeon on board ship .
His tone is no less sorrowfully echoed by his new acquaintance .
‘ <NAME> de do , <NAME> ? ’ said a voice beside him .
Those are of a different kind .
‘ You are from <NAME> , sir , are you .
Several times she has gone out early , and been absent until evening .
<NAME> ’ t moddley-coddley , there ’ s a good fellow .
‘ What is the matter ? ’ asked her visitor .
`` I hope not , guardian , '' said I .
‘ Avay vith melincholly , as the little boy said ven his schoolmissus died .
Imprisonment began to tell upon him .
‘ I say , ’ he proceeded , ‘ Miss Dombey !
<NAME> in return , requiring name of such <NAME> .
‘ Not there ! ’ cried <NAME> .
There are two establishments for boys in this same neighbourhood .
The firm was known as <NAME> and <NAME> .
What are you stopping for ? ” said I .
Here ’ s a burial volume , just the thing !
But I am never fatigued .
‘ <NAME> see to the drag ven you go downhill .
A deaf serving-woman and the light porter completed Mrs. Sparsit ’ s empire .
`` But knows a quantity , I suppose ?
‘ It is an old prerogative of kings to govern everything but their passions .
<NAME> looked to such men as his good friend to do such things .
‘ Would it be such hopeless work ?
He will never forget that at <NAME> ’ s he first saw <NAME> .
`` And I ai n't took back to Tom-all-Alone 's .
`` So it is , so it is , '' returned my guardian hurriedly .
‘ It ’ s no use knocking , coachman .
said the Jew , when they had regained the passage .
'And I for his falsehood with my head ! '
I never did take anything from any one .
It ’ s the best of old worlds !
Then <NAME> would appear , and the man would retire .
You feared that I should be beforehand with you .
‘ Very , ’ said <NAME> , with his mouth full .
After which , he walked home , whistling .
The evidence lay in a most remarkable manner , between those two .
You will please consider me your guardian .
He is a most extraordinary old chap , sir .
She ’ s well to do now , and a widow .
My <NAME> 's lips move , but they utter nothing .
The enchanting <NAME> leaves a card .
'You should , indeed , ' replied <NAME> .
Who takes the smallest notice of me ?
treat him kindly , <NAME> for my sake ! '
What line are you in ?
And what these charred and blackened walls we stand before ?
`` Never have a mission , my dear child . ''
The iron gentleman makes an iron bow .
I adopted her , to be loved .
Your feet are not wet ?
In which a <NAME> is holden 13 .
The law had been her nurse .
Because you have got a daughter .
To whom could it belong ?
Any amount of singular look for me , but not a double look !
I don ’ t like red noses .
My aunt mused a little while , and then said : ‘ Mr .
But I also know what <NAME> is .
‘ Humph ! ’ said <NAME> , pausing at the door .
I carried coffee , <NAME> , for a long time .
I had never been told where it was .
said <NAME> , anxiously bringing a chair towards my table .
' I want a boy , and he mus n't be a big 'un .
Terms , twenty guineas per annum .
Could we walk , my friends , without strength ?
<NAME> <NAME> ! ’ was the only reply .
The afternoon wore away , however , and he did not appear .
A-a-matter of business -- do n't be distressed .
`` A quarter past , '' said <NAME> , counting .
‘ Thank you , dear <NAME> ! ’ said I .
I say to them , What else are you made for ?
The windows of the chamber where he lay , I darkened last .
I sat down by his side in silence .
`` No , my love , '' said he .
Guess. ’ ‘ I am not good at guessing anything. ’ ‘ She did .
‘ Ye-es , ’ said the other , turning full upon him .
It 's a monomania with him to think he is possessed of documents .
‘ <NAME> , does it ? ’ said <NAME> .
Its effect was precisely what a more experienced observer would have foreseen .
'Why , the gentleman 's got him , ' replied the officer .
The kinchin lay will be a fortune to you . '
It reflects disgrace on no one living , except you who use it .
<NAME> and I both laughed , but not so loud .
'It wrings my heart to hear you ! '
“ Touch that string , and he instantly changes for the worse .
<NAME> <NAME> was so bewildered that he could think of no locality but <NAME> .
Mr <NAME> , I drink yours .
I hope they may never come to hear of it .
`` Would any one believe this ? ''
Where are my friends ? ’ ‘ You ain ’ t got no friends .
`` Twice before , '' says <NAME> .
`` No letter that can possibly have been overlooked ? ''
However , it ’ s soon set right .
‘ She goes on errands as well as any one. ’ <NAME> laughed .
We shall meet at dinner-time .
Ai n't the lady the t'other lady ? ''
I congratulate you on your feathers .
`` She has no daughter of her own , has she ? ''
'You do n't mean to go yourself , I suppose ? '
<NAME> at <NAME> and <NAME> !
'You know that <NAME> is worse to-night , my fascinator ? '
‘ <NAME> is rather vulgar , my dear .
You must not return to us any more .
He inquired particularly after Mr Merdle .
she added in the same breath , laughing as he laughed .
‘ Ye-es , if I can , ’ returned the other , promptly .
“ Is this a cut ? ” said <NAME> .
‘ No better yet ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
Not a little more magnificence , therefore , on the part of <NAME> .
The school reopened next day .
He only requires to be understood .
I merely said that you were paying a hackney coach .
Do n't be afraid of it . ''
The idea of your coming down the Lane yourself !
‘ I know you ’ ll be sorry afterwards .
I hope I have learnt how to accommodate myself to the changes of life .
`` That they are what they are , do not blame me ! ''
‘ Did I look well in snuff-colour ?
I chose it as a conspicuous part of the house .
Come and see. ’ He went on again , and <NAME> accompanied him .
We all drew nearer to the cages , feigning to examine the birds .
`` She 's gone forrard to the Police Office , '' returns <NAME> .

‘ I never thought you ’ d get better .
To speak unreservedly to you , I do .

I know too much about it , sir .
Whatever the old girl says , do -- do it ! ''
Now , hear me , my dears !
'Do you live in <NAME> ? '
She prayed him to forgive her , before my Agnes came into this world .
At length they arrived at the large stone .
Quickening their pace , they turned up a road upon the left hand .
'Not too strong , ' replied <NAME> , with a delicate cough .
‘ If you please , ma ’ am , ’ I began .
‘ Can you drive ? ’ said the fat boy .
The poor girl was sitting on the floor where they had laid her down .
‘ I think I have caught it now , ’ said <NAME> .
I am more important to my sister than he thinks .
She ’ ll drop down the river with that theer tide .
I must see him to-night , for I faithfully promised to do so .
Neither was his manner influenced .
Not in the least likely .
How can I ever thank you ?
What would be the consequence ?
She is never to blame in any such instance .
'Bless her , she 's going off ! '
‘ <NAME> ’ t you find <NAME> blooming , sir ?
He never opened it without occasion .
he exclaimed , `` I fear you more than any spectre I have seen .

It looked very comfortable indeed .
All things in it are of the past .
`` Tell her how it was . ''
'Amen to that , my child ! '
Mrs Alfred <NAME> faced her lord .
If <NAME> were in her worst , I intensified it .
‘ Never mind , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , with dignity .
I had recognized her with amazement , for <NAME> .
Let me have a word with you . '
‘ With all my heart , ’ said Mr Swiveller .
‘ I am sir , ’ replied the landlord .
‘ We have only met each other once before , you know .
It must not be lost. ’ He tapped at the cottage door .
Mrs <NAME> rang for candles as soon as the <NAME> had closed upon him .
‘ O ’ course you air , ’ said <NAME> argumentatively .
This has not been broken very long .
Now let us walk the other way .
'What of the house , my man ; eh ? '
Thereupon all the young ladies rose and began shaking their skirts out behind .
He sought to raise himself a little .
Upon the latter , sits a man of sixty ; reading .
So that 's disposed of , and we will talk of something else . ''
‘ I thought so , ’ he observed .
‘ This is not all the good-fortune .
This is the offer you mentioned , sir ? ’ ‘ Yes .
He charged himself even with restraining <NAME> from improving his opportunity .
He observed the look and said , ‘ To my mother , of course .
And you are in mourning too !
A short pause followed these consolatory remarks of <NAME> .
It is not dark enough yet .
‘ Are you always as busy as you are now ? ’ ‘ Busier .
He will be no worse off than he was , you know .
' I am , ' said the girl earnestly .
‘ You can if you like .
“ Is it not impressive , <NAME> ? ” asked <NAME> .
No man removed his hand from it now .
And why on the sly ?
‘ Of course ; that was to be expected .
My dear , for the moment -- true .
_I_ do n't want to intrude upon your secrets . '
Perhaps we had better go to your place of residence .
‘ My darling girl , ’ she began again .
‘ Wish you good-night , <NAME> , ’ said Mrs. Craddock .
said I. I always sat down on the other side of him .
How did you find me ?
I then proceeded to the object of my visit .
‘ Overtake him ; bring him back instantly !
`` Guppy , '' says <NAME> , `` I will not deny it .
Which the playacting have likeways brought him to <NAME> along with me .
<NAME> , indeed ! ’ cried <NAME> , bridling up .
‘ You want some one ? ’ said the lady in a stern manner .
We shall have plenty of time. ’ ‘ Capital ! ’ said <NAME> .
Mr Clennam is a very gentlemanly man -- very gentlemanly .
I did not set this down as a discovery , rashly .
‘ To the old country , sir , ’ I rejoin .
What say you , my dear sir ?
Some people maintains that an Englishman ’ s house is his castle .
It 's only a question between the larger sum and the smaller .
`` 'To promote the conversation , ' as a joker might say .
`` What do you want , sir ? ''
He ca n't be expected to know much of such a labyrinth . ''
‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , after thoughtfully pausing in her work .
They won ’ t do over here .
‘ Yes , you have taken cold , ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> , ’ adds <NAME> , ‘ can exceed their good-humour .
‘ I fear I must , ’ said <NAME> , with heroic firmness .
First , he took the two secret men .
He thought of the picturesque alliance between those two , externally so very different .
Her grandson apologizes with `` True .
' I should by your description .
So little did I know of the world !
There 's subjects enough as betwixt two sech , without onnecessary ones .
He had not miscalculated the effect then !
`` What do you call him again ? ''
He was a better follower than <NAME> .
That 's not my sort either . ''
On this point opinion was divided .
`` I felt it a good deal at first .
Never mind , <NAME> , never mind ! ’ said <NAME> .
And really it did seem possible .
‘ Had I ? ’ said the man again .
I ’ m a mother to both .
It was done in a minute .
‘ I ’ m glad to hear it .
In the business part of the proceedings he carried all before him . ''
I know my duty better now .
“ Therese ! ” she cries , in her shrill tones .
For some changes in the fortunes of my friends , I was prepared .
Lie down again ; there 's a dear ! '
In the back kitchen , I raved as became me .
‘ I should be the victim of their fury , ’ replied <NAME> .
I 'll tell true , indeed , Mrs .
I told her so , as she sat brooding after this outburst .
<NAME> , I envy them the luxury of their own feelings on this occasion .
'Well , well , ' said <NAME> , 'every trade has its drawbacks .
And for what place of all places ?
His family is as old as the hills , and infinitely more respectable .
Am I blind to that boy ’ s defects ?
‘ <NAME> ! ’ cried <NAME> , recoiling in amazement .
<NAME> noticed the first <NAME> .
‘ How does he bear it , my dear creature ? ’ asks <NAME> .
I told you from the first it was a toss-up .
As <NAME> looked fixedly at this phenomenon , it was a knocker again .
‘ Say out what you have to say .
There was a snap of cold , last week .
'What do you mean by lagging and a lifer ? '
That was all , and what was that !
I am going to <NAME> on business .
Be careful , <NAME> , be careful .
cried <NAME> , 'What is it ? '
`` My prudent <NAME> , why not ? ''
Know you very well , gentlemen , though you mayn ’ t remember me .
To entreat her , at least , to pause .
She can not endure their restraint and will walk alone in a neighbouring garden .
‘ If you had money now -- ’ said Mr Dombey .
<NAME> uses me to it .
This is the most I consider possible .
He must go to it .
He was the meanest cur existing , with a single pair of legs .
<NAME> said he played the fife .
You may keep the books , if you 're fond of reading .
‘ He broke it over me .
It IS a wilderness , ’ said the old man with much animation .
'Why , if he did n't mind -- ' observed Fagin .
Did you find Madeline herself , waiting for you and expecting you ?
<NAME> ’ t say you are a prisoner , <NAME> !
Oh dear , dear , not on any account .
You 'll hardly believe what I am going to tell you .
What did he do it for ? ''
‘ Oh , you do , do you ? ’ sneered <NAME> .
It will be two o ’ clock by the time we get back .
I ses 'yes I can ' I ses .
says Mrs. Bagnet , quietly threading her needle .
He had heard of <NAME> , at the posting-houses , as being before him .
You will presently see that we ca n't be too private .
What has this to do with me ? ''
He was the meekest of his sex , the mildest of little men .
What are his necessities , and what does he require ?
‘ <NAME> d ’ ye do , <NAME> ? ’ said Mr Toots .
We have never had any quarrel , to which I have been a party .
These things she could plainly see .
In the mildest language , I adore you .
`` Ca n't help it , '' he returned .
Seven-eighths of my stock is old-fashioned .
“ Roast weal , ” says the patient .
`` Are the pictures all as they used to be ? ''
‘ One other word , my Little Dorrit .
What <NAME> ’ s father was to me , she made him .
'It is , ' was the reply .
But he set up no monopoly of the general attention , or the conversation .
`` Is she married , my dear ? ''
I know that I lounged about the streets , insufficiently and unsatisfactorily fed .
There are a few children employed in these factories , but not many .
<NAME> <NAME> was extremely glad to see me , but a little confused too .
He softly reclosed the door .
‘ Indeed , ma ’ am ! ’ replied <NAME> , timidly .
It is not worth your noticing .
I have been a weak child .
She would officially succeed to the chamber she had rented so long .
‘ No , he didn ’ t , <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> .
And it 's really very hard , ” said <NAME> .
‘ There is no air here , ’ said the man faintly .
The young man and the girl both laughed .
They are startling contrivances , and are most agreeable when passed .
‘ Thou seest this daughter of my dear dead brother !
And now , my dear Sir , I put it to you .
‘ I think we may adjourn , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ She would have been proud of you .
Wherever I looked I saw the ominous words that ran in it repeated .
Let my arm go ! ’ ‘ Not yet .
Only because I am sure that you would too .
My Missis as I had the hard time wi ' -- Stop though !
‘ <NAME> is very nearly nineteen , ’ replied the widow .
and yonder the captain himself .
`` What have you done with your candle ? ''
`` Your woman 's wit hits the mark .
‘ You will communicate with us again ? ’ said <NAME> .
We asked a gentleman by us if he knew what cause was on .
`` Your ladyship is acquainted with the name of <NAME> ? ''
My hair had known no comb or brush since I left <NAME> .
And she spoke the truth .
Though that seems wretchedly prejudiced—does it not ? —for I never saw him .
It is the <NAME> thing altogether .
‘ The race that one has started in , ’ said he .
Mr Boffin heard of you through a certain Mr Lightwood .
<NAME> <NAME> ’ s half sorry he advised you now .
To the <NAME> , therefore , I directed my steps .
perhaps <NAME> first , ’ I admitted , with a blush .
That ’ s all over long ago .
<NAME> perhaps , but so it is ! ''
So hurrah for the <NAME> , <NAME> !
Look over your hand , <NAME> , and see what you have .
So the girl eyed him .
‘ Surely , surely , ’ returned <NAME> .
Nothing but mysteries in connection with <NAME> ’ s house .
As ever I took of you .
When am I to get my money ready ?
‘ Nothing , thank you , ’ rejoined <NAME> .
It did not , however , so continue .
`` You said about ten , '' Tony repeats .
`` I have been quite alarmed .
‘ He is very , very ill , ’ said <NAME> .
I will simply make statements , therefore , and not put questions .
<NAME> <NAME> re-asserts it by another inclination of his head .
‘ To be sure , ’ said <NAME> , by no means disconcerted .
The young man inclines his head in acknowledgment of the precepts of experience .
Not that <NAME> care for such society , you know !
I give ‘ em away to the young ladies .
Not so , however , Mr Sparkler .
It is among their dignities .
Let us make the friendly move of agreeing to look for it together .
But on the contrary , comrade , what MAY we find ?
It shrunk , collapsed , and dwindled down into a bedpost .
The attitude was that of one who sought the heat .
'So do I , ' cried <NAME> .
“ Now you know all about it , <NAME> , ” said <NAME> .
They have never given ME any vexation ; quite the contrary .
Then , he launched into a general eulogium on the <NAME> .
‘ We mustn ’ t let him go ?
He is journeying to-day into the iron country farther north to look about him .
Pack up your things directly !
I can not deny that I shed tears .
Copperfield. ’ ‘ I am glad to see you , sir .
I was to go abroad .
My father and <NAME> never met again .
Who 's the worse for the loss of a few things like these ?
‘ Thou changest me from bad to good .
`` I told you this was the growlery , my dear .
Yet it would never do to run away from him .
‘ I couldn ’ t believe my eyes .
‘ But I want you to know , my love .
‘ What light is that ! ’ said the younger brother .
Let me speak of it in its place .
Her step towards the door brings her front to front with <NAME> .
There was a terror in every ash that dropped out of the fire .
My anger was roused in behalf of an absent , friendless stranger .
‘ Take care of the last step , <NAME> .
Is he ready to go ?
'Pretty well , thank you , sir ' replied Oliver , with considerable hesitation .
‘ Former pastrycook and Muffin-maker , much respected ; ’ introducing gravestone .
For I did love him once .
Some purpose , strong enough to fill up any pause , possessed her .
Are you there , my friend ?
`` So you gave him notice ? ''
I mean <NAME> ! ’ My heart quite died within me .
You are wet , and you look weary .
<NAME> is pounds , shillings , and pence .
Shutting his eyes and rolling .
Although <NAME> had roused himself from sleep , he was not thoroughly awake .
' I shall do you a mischief ! '
‘ <NAME> ! ’ cried <NAME> , ‘ at <NAME> !
You address nothing in my breast , you touch nothing there .
What will they think of us !
‘ Let me see , said the blind man .
The eyes were there , before he had laid himself along .
replied <NAME> eagerly ; 'but I was thinking that I am ungrateful now . '
‘ Let us speak for ourselves , sir .
For the face , it expressed nothing but violent and evil passions .
‘ Nothing , I suppose ? ’ said <NAME> , with a diabolical grin .
<NAME> ’ t you pity <NAME> , and I won ’ t pity <NAME> .
‘ I wrote him a note , I said it was a painful thing .
I think the reply was , `` Cut away , then ! ''
I have very strong reasons indeed , for entertaining that wish .
Before breakfast in the morning , <NAME> walked out to look about him .
But I could make nothing of the word .
You was a spy -- witness at the <NAME> .
‘ I prefer to remain at home .
She had no fear that she would live through another night .
Then came the question , which of the two next doors ?
'You must compose yourself , ' said the doctor supporting her .
‘ Nonsense ! ’ cried <NAME> -- somewhat resentful of the idea .
He laughed as he retired with the bird -- it was a plump one .
But I did both , and made them happy .
‘ At any rate I ’ m going .
‘ Not by no means , ’ acquiesced <NAME> , affably but magisterially .
Only a miser ; that 's all . '
asked <NAME> , advancing to meet him .
<NAME> ’ s servant ! ’ said <NAME> earnestly .
She taught her , indeed , nearly all she knows .
‘ It ’ s quite dreadful , ’ said <NAME> , stopping his ears .
I am in statu quo. ’ ‘ And Mrs. Micawber ? ’ I pursued .
He saw a strength within her that was resistless .
What queer bills are to be bought , and at what prices ?
I tell you , cruelly , <NAME> .
asked <NAME> of the gentleman whom we had found in attendance on her .
‘ Placed me in such an extremely awkward situation , ’ continued <NAME> .
But we held our own without any appearance of molestation .
‘ <NAME> , make us truly thankful , brother Ned , ’ said <NAME> .
What does anybody want here ?
What a demd savage lamb ! ’ cried <NAME> .
‘ You are an errand-boy for aught I know , ’ said <NAME> .
They have brought him to a rich end , truly !
The sun went down and she was still there .
I had always pitied her , never so much as now .
And how dare you encourage him , you insolent minx ?
He laughed heartily and answered , `` No . ''
Do you believe what I am saying ? ’ ‘ I fear I must .
`` And as to <NAME> , '' resumes <NAME> .
‘ You are mad , ’ said <NAME> .
It seems to require much mixing and compounding .
‘ So I think , <NAME> , when they come to me .
Oh , <NAME> , you silly , silly , silly puss ! ''
‘ From day to day I feel this .
<NAME> hastened to the window of his office , and looked in .
‘ Or abroad. ’ ‘ Surely , ’ the <NAME> answered .
We all went to church , and <NAME> gave her away .
I suppose nobody ever was in such a state of ink .
‘ Here is your letter , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Not for all the world and his wife .
`` You 'll want all day to-morrow , I suppose ? ''
`` How do you do , Mr .
<NAME> walk into the back shop , sir . ''
I laid her out ; and I must walk , you know .
It was a pretty letter .
But you are coming my way .
Shortly afterwards , Mrs. <NAME> appeared .
All continued dark and silent as before .
It ’ s well I ’ m quite prepared .
and goes on with the <NAME> letters . ''
'Wot a rum chap you are , <NAME> ! '
He awoke refreshed , and they continued their journey .
She stood still , and listened .
It comes over me at times. ’ Was it gone ?
The entreaties to remain were pressing , but <NAME> was inflexible .
‘ This morning , <NAME> ’ am , ’ returned the Major .
The walls and ceiling were blackened with flies .
In Mr Plornish ’ s judgment you would be the worse for it .
'Whoever it was , I 'd serve them the same . '
As many of the jury as can crowd together at the table sit there .
How much greater cause she had for weeping now !
‘ You ’ re to have it every day , he says .
I tried to wean her fra ’ t ower and ower agen .
'Why , now she 's on the other tack ! '
‘ I wonder I haven ’ t chucked it away afore now .
‘ Oh , to be sure ! ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> and <NAME> was no more -- his children no more .
I will remain here , till he come to ask me for it . '
Under this impression he returned to the charge .
My Lady walks upon the other side .
“ You won ’ t scream ? ” said <NAME> doubtfully .
‘ <NAME> ’ t you though ! ’ said Mrs. Heep .
Let me relieve you of that bundle !
I never was so wickedly wronged .
The system here , is rigid , strict , and hopeless solitary confinement .
<NAME> amusements are not wanting .
`` It is so , little one . ''
How many ? ’ ‘ Two , ’ rejoined <NAME> .
But the heart is the bird .
‘ <NAME> ! ’ cried <NAME> , looking up .
`` <NAME> , '' said the boy , standing still to gaze at us .
<NAME> and <NAME> ’ s warehouse was at the waterside .
I think he must have gone to look for it .
He had heard of her going to the prison every day .
`` I 'm a-cleaning the upstairs back room , miss , '' replies <NAME> .
‘ “ It is , is it ? ” said my uncle .
It would be a splendid thing for me .
This man pursued <NAME> closely , and professed to be devoted to her .
'You can say nothing to alter my resolution .
'Yes , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
Come ! ’ and his teeth fairly shone again .
I regretted the necessity , but it must be done .
`` What is that to me ? ''
`` And you are to go down at twelve ? ''
Besides her consideration money , her daily contract included meals .
‘ A charming subject of reflection for you , very charming .
‘ Yes , ’ rejoined the one-eyed man .
You want another dose ! ’ said Mr Flintwinch .
`` <NAME> , will you forgive me ?
‘ I say again , I don ’ t know what man he is .
`` Just as good as saw it , '' he returned .
“ Do n't you expect to see him ? ” said I .
`` My little woman , why do you look at me in that way ?
I say , how the <NAME> would bother 'em would n't he ? '
As they struck the bargain , <NAME> surveyed him with a painful interest .
<NAME> <NAME> describes over and over again .
‘ The dead letters , of course , ’ said the bagman .
Why not , Mr Carker ? ’ said the boy .
He always concluded by addressing <NAME> .
Mrs. Rouncewell 's hands unquiet , as usual , on this reference .
He was fatter than ever .
“ <NAME> ’ t trouble yourself about the warming-pan. ” The warming-pan !
<NAME> for deeper and heavier sorrow was yet to come .
No news came of old <NAME> .
I have not been advised with myself .
cries Judy with a stamp upon the ground .
‘ Why , that leaves you fifty , ’ retorted <NAME> .
<NAME> came home , and I soon had no doubt at all . ''
The cottage is not what it was .
`` But in that he was influenced by passion , not by reason .
He looked up with a surly nod when his visitor came in .
What more can I say for you than that I know you deserve her !
He little suspected with whose money .
<NAME> back as a die .
After a while I recognized the familiar way to <NAME> .
<NAME> pair for a curricle .
This was my homely thought , as I contemplated the box-tree .
‘ No , no , ’ replied <NAME> .
Every eye was fixed on <NAME> ’ s face .
Mrs <NAME> was affected to tears .
I see he is going to speak to you . ''
exclaimed <NAME> , in strong indignation .
`` Yes , we happened to meet oftener , '' he returned .
We have never been readers in our family .
He is truly military , and full of anecdote .
'This purse , ' cried the young lady .
But I will not do that .
Mr <NAME> thought he had passed my young gentleman on the bridge yonder .
`` Yes , with <NAME> on it .
There is a dog , <NAME> , connected with -- but excuse me .
To think of your poor sister and her Rampages !
'Look down , ' said <NAME> , lowering the lantern into the gulf .
When she went to Mr Casby ’ s , he was always there .
That was the thing he had set his heart upon .
This made him almost grave .
I have been away nearly eight years .
<NAME> in company , gentlemen , in God ’ s name .
I am tired to death of the matter . ''
For the reasons I have mentioned I would select you .
Everybody else quickly vanishes too .
There is inquiry on foot , and pursuit .
I doen ’ t care , bless you !
I was smoking , and trying to suppress a rising tendency to shudder .
She takes a chair , looking straight at him as on the last occasion .
'Do n't believe that , ' said <NAME> .
What more could I hope to do by prolonging the interview ?
`` What is the matter with you now ? ''
A little owl could stare .
Grandfather Smallweed inquires of <NAME> , <NAME> 's twin sister .
‘ Did you ? ’ <NAME> retorted .
No sense reported anything unusual there .
The breakfast ended in a perfect understanding .
' I was a regular cunning sneak when I was at school .
Nearly two thousand pounds profit from him already though .
<NAME> ; isn ’ t it ? ’ ‘ Very , ’ said <NAME> .
You will always be my solace and resource , as you have always been .
‘ Well ; but I was speaking ironically , ’ rejoined <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> , stay , ’ said <NAME> .
He always knew where the plump sister was .
I believe -- at least I know -- that he was not rich .
But let him look at me , in prison , and in bonds here .
“ You , is it , <NAME> ? ” “ It is , <NAME> .
After whom I remember nothing but an average equality of failure .
I shall do well enough , and so will my husband .
`` Will somebody give me a quart pot ? ''
You don ’ t know him half as well as I do , <NAME> .
Would you allow me to look at it ?
It is that which makes me bold .
‘ I am acquainted with my faults .
It was constantly before him all at once .
‘ _I_ mean of the foreign man , ’ said <NAME> .
“ And she might credit it .
‘ Are they well ? ’ he asked .
‘ I asked him to come. ’ ‘ I am sorry to hear it .
What I said was low ; that 's what it was ; low .
I lay myself open to detection , I know .
asked <NAME> , coaxing him , with her arms round his neck .
said she in reply to my inquiry .
‘ You don ’ t show it , ’ said <NAME> .
Here is my little woman ! ''
I told him what I had come for .
Of her father ’ s being groundlessly suspected , she felt sure .
Is it fear or is it anger now ?
<NAME> at this in my hand .
`` Disgrace never comes to <NAME> , '' returns the housekeeper .
'Tell your governor that <NAME> and <NAME> is here , will you ? '
The <NAME> did not go to bed for a long time .
You have long had a good model before you , in your cousin <NAME> .
Let it be. ” “ But , <NAME> .
This is not unselfish in me .
She was a spoilt child ; but how could she be otherwise ?
-- always repeating Mrs. <NAME> 's answer to us like an interpreter .
She looked round with an air of incertitude , and advanced towards the stairs .
I hope no bereavement has befallen her .
asks Mrs. Bagnet , stopping in her cheerful talk .
‘ I shall not require the carriage at night , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ I don ’ t know , ’ replied <NAME> pettishly .
'It 's quite a cruelty , ' said <NAME> .
You put it away somewhere , and you kept your own counsel where .
My handkerchief wo n't hurt you . ''
‘ But you ’ re always bragging about something .
In this last respect , servants are the devil .
Suddenly a spasm shoots across her face and she turns deadly pale .
He did not answer , and was to all appearances asleep .
I must not hear of such a sacrifice .
Let me have a word with you outside . '
I admired and loved him , and his approval was return enough .
‘ Still , so it was , ’ continued Mrs. Micawber .
<NAME> <NAME> was in high feather and spirits , but a little nervous withal .
It was a good thought .
They let you off easily enough , ” sneered <NAME> .
`` I covet nothing , '' said <NAME> in the same light way .
How I persuaded myself that this was likely , I do n't know .
he cried , upon his knees .
‘ Dear me ! ’ exclaimed the old lady .
After this , they went home .
We don ’ t walk like that .
says the coroner with a melancholy shake of the head .
You ’ ll be hurt. ’ ‘ Wait one instant , <NAME> .
‘ Where shall we drive you , sir ? ’ said the post-boy .
And very much indebted for the omen .
‘ You will not take the air to-day , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
the other man seemed to answer ; 'could I mistake him , think you ?
Perhaps you will sleep in your own room ?
'What if I did it ! '
This is the third time of your hinting and threatening .
Only four of them passed .
<NAME> <NAME> , <NAME> , do n't you say a word nor yet stir .
He awoke to this , and he awoke to more .
I say , ‘ Come in ! ’ but someone taps again .
That , his position and attitude were , on the whole , sublime .
Now , your inclinations are to be consulted .
`` He never finishes what he begins to say !
'Here his is , coming down the street . '
I don ’ t see why he shouldn ’ t be .
said the beadle , raising his hand with a show of authority .
This he knows , and knowing , still offers me his hand .
still going on ; but where !
I made myself known to your sister .
His clothes were shabby , but he had an imposing shirt-collar on .
`` Only hear that , <NAME> , '' said Mrs. Cratchit .
I told you from the first , <NAME> , that I never give hopes .
I suppose the opening prospect confused me .
The child looked round the room as she took her seat .
And their assembled friends being not a bit behindhand , roared out lustily .
She was bent , they told me , on committing suicide .
It was nearly nine o ’ clock when he reached <NAME> .
Did she send here for you ? ’ ‘ No .
O ye sun , moon , and stars , the great man !
You may do anything with me if you only show me children .
He had just come home .
'Come near the fire , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
‘ Oh Jeremiah ! ’ cried <NAME> , waking .
‘ A word. ’ I confronted <NAME> alone .
The house was no longer theirs .
Did he leave them here ?
‘ Was there ever such a -- !
We had a beautiful little dinner .
‘ What can <NAME> think when he hears you ? ’ ‘ Oh !
I won ’ t hear of it .
<NAME> <NAME> is my messenger and representative .
Under these circumstances I thought myself well rid of him for a shilling .
So were his two companions .
They all open <NAME> ’ s work .
There 'll he nobody but Ma to thank for it . ''
Say what they are. ’ ‘ Mr .
‘ I am not aware of anything more , ’ replied <NAME> .
I speak for myself , let me add , without including you .
Doctors were sent for , and soon came .
She looked at him now .
He resumed where he had left off .
In the morning she was just the same , <NAME> .
It was not to be .
They were always forgiving me , in their vanity and condescension .
Does he -- do they -- aunt ? ’ <NAME> shook her head compassionately .
‘ Mississes , <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> , with an alarming frown .
She made no reply , but still pressed forward .
A sunburnt , quick , lithe , little man , though rather thickset .
<NAME> <NAME> ’ s admiration seemed to increase her perplexity .
Oh , what shall I do , what shall I do !
That is , in the long run .
A hard family likeness was on all these things .
‘ They are so beautiful ! ’ said Mrs. <NAME> , sobbing .
I never can , believe me .
The feeling which beset the child was one of dim uncertain horror .
“ Bewitching Mrs. Copperfield ” , ’ I repeated stoutly .
Who passes by this road so late ?
There is a rude means of washing , a table , and a bedstead .
What changes , <NAME> , even in my small world !
‘ He has never had occasion to acquire such little arts .
'He is not in danger , I hope ? '
said Mrs. Bagnet , continuing to grumble on good-humouredly .
They are gone , and I resume the journey of my story .
I will not be put down .
The old man and the child dwelt alone together .
I take it as a compliment .
No ; he said confidently , no !
I have n't had the letter more than a quarter of an hour . ''
“ These scraps of paper fail me .
She looked at her watch , and it was twenty minutes past two .
He 's game enough now , I 'll engage .
I knowed old <NAME> , sir .
Those fellows who were here one night .
You know <NAME> , the <NAME> , across the lane .
Does that look as if I cared for her ?
He did it , whether or no .
I will do no more .
I declare here ’ s some one else .
Are we never to be permitted to forget ?
He will love and honour you as I will .
And not in the same hand , perhaps ?
`` Settled in the law , '' said I .
That he is bound to make an effort .
`` This , '' returned <NAME> , `` is as it should be .
She is very much alone .
It was of no avail .
He shall not bully me -- he shall not bully me .
To his matter-of-fact home , which was called <NAME> , <NAME> directed his steps .
‘ What came of that , I needn ’ t say .
You may stare and shiver .
‘ She looks upon me as mere child , sir .
`` Disappointed , miss , '' said <NAME> , peeping through the curtain .
Mr <NAME> had uncovered on looking in at the door , and remained so .
`` Now we 're all right again .
“ Orlick there ? ” “ Ah ! ” he answered , slouching out .
Of course , she has remained here ever since .
Has he been here long ?
‘ Well , but the <NAME> of <NAME> !
It is the last bottle of the old Madiera .
<NAME> <NAME> wants to speak to you .
<NAME> was the first , and walked by himself smoking .
They kept him , many times , from what did him real harm .
When there is not , the character of the scenery is always the same .
'Because of <NAME> 's account of him , the said <NAME> . '
<NAME> , out of date , withdrawing from attention , able to afford it .
It was as haggard a view of life as a man need look upon .
‘ I suppose so , ’ said <NAME> , looking at <NAME> .
‘ Open the window , ’ said the sick man .
<NAME> looks at him inquiringly , repeating the name .
`` I admit it most fully and freely , '' said I .
There was a bright moon , but it was behind the clouds .
<NAME> Jobling is buttoned up closer than mere adornment might require .
They were immediately admitted into the lodge .
‘ Not a button , ’ said <NAME> .
rejoined <NAME> ; 'that was done by <NAME> , that was . '
‘ Of <NAME> and <NAME> , in the wine trade , ’ he replied .
And however far off that may be , I will never tire of trying .
But by this time , his doubts were all removed .
“ <NAME> is the best policy , ” is it ?
The lady says what ’ s right .
A Shoal of <NAME> 35 .
‘ You , injured by his haughty temper !
I have been no lover of this lady ’ s .
'Not a penny , ' replied the girl , waving her hand .
The very wedding looked dismal as they passed in front of the altar .
Then came the night -- dark , dismal , silent night .
It was for me to smile .
But we always calls him <NAME> just the same .
She stopped , and reddened again .
With many adieus and good wishes , <NAME> went his way .
She rose too , and he took leave with all humility .
‘ Pretty well ! ’ echoed <NAME> .
But we preserved an unbroken silence .
My child is always dangerous , more or less .
You are to be a proctor .
' I know he is , ' rejoined <NAME> .
he said , rising and pushing back his chair .
Women work hard in these parts .
`` Never you mind for me , miss .
I can act with philosophy in such a case as that .
These have been his relations towards me .
<NAME> on in the night , <NAME> opened his eyes .
But no temperature made the melancholy mad elephants more mad or more sane .
And I know brickmakers go about working at piecework in different places .
`` So am I , they tell me . ''
<NAME> looked at me a little frightened .
Shall I tell you more ?
It ’ s my business to see it .
So many hundred Hands in this <NAME> ; so many hundred horse <NAME> .
They look very , very like that sort of thing .
‘ <NAME> know , ’ said <NAME> .
It remained thus , until the first warning bell began to ring .
I work hard , and read Law insatiably .
`` The house is yonder , '' <NAME> exclaimed .
<NAME> , when he was sufficiently cool , proceeded with his letter .
You see me at my greatest disadvantage .
‘ What ’ s the matter ? ’ said the short dark man .
Now , I 'll tell you what I have got for supper , <NAME> .
‘ Of course I am , ’ replied <NAME> haughtily .
We reached the city , late that night .
Be seated , <NAME> , I beg , <NAME> .
Mr Dombey , Sir. ’ <NAME> bowed .
O yeth , to be thure !
Did the honourable <NAME> allude to him ?
said <NAME> , pausing near the door .
`` What 's the matter with the cat ? ''
That ’ s what your daughter wants .
The word <NAME> , besides , gives a pretty form to the lips .
Let me go my way , all of ye .
Never , since I have been here ! ''
We must break it to get it through into the cage .
It was ratified only the other day .
Mr Lightwood , here has been a wicked cruel murder .
‘ Well , good-bye , then , ’ said the old gentleman .
Every eye then turned to the five judges and the public prosecutor .
But permit me to set you right on one point .
It was due to the uniform he wore , to demand this explanation .
'We are all weak creeturs , ' said <NAME> .
`` I am sorry to say I am . ''
There was another long pause .
I think that will cure her , my boy .
There are no ends of ways of leaving here .
More unfortunately still , she had relations .
is there no chord in your heart that I can touch !
‘ How can you be so thankless to your best friend , <NAME> ?
‘ Then why DO you wait ? ’ said <NAME> .
Call him Trotwood , certainly , ’ said <NAME> .
There he found Mr Rugg .
said the doctor , laying <NAME> gently down again .
Appealing to <NAME> , would be rather a rum course .
Do I ? ’ ‘ Yes , ’ she answered with a smile .
I merely wish that we should -- ha -- understand each other .
There might have been much more envy in politer places .
Again , only this morning at breakfast .
Everybody wakes at the same time .
‘ Excuse me , ’ said the gentleman hastily .
‘ A lady ! ’ says <NAME> , pluming his ruffled feathers .
‘ Not I , indeed , ’ returned <NAME> .
Mr <NAME> ’ s companion resumed the conversation .
The wood is quite fresh where it gave way .
<NAME> <NAME> demanded how he afterwards recognised him then ?
'Well , then , ' rejoined <NAME> , ' I would n't .
<NAME> ’ t stop to say one word to me , but go .
‘ Come , come , <NAME> , ’ urged <NAME> , at his side .
May be a humble one !
He can ’ t go too soon .
It ’ s no fault of mine .
Each was bowed down and broken .
Her beautiful serene eyes met mine as she came towards me .
He might not be so gently dealt with outside as he is there .
sounded all over the <NAME> .
About something relating to <NAME> , he believed .
‘ Not for the world , ’ rejoined <NAME> .
Do you know they would be ruined to pay off my old scores ?
And so shall somebody else too .
<NAME> evening , citizen , ” filling his glass .
‘ My name is <NAME> , ’ said the gentleman .
So the doctor , breathing low , and closely watching , asks himself .
‘ You have been used to eaves-dropping .
Let us see the state of the case .
inquired <NAME> : anxious to encourage any symptoms of good-humour in the unwelcome visitors .
This devil whom you make an angel of .
Mouldering away before our eyes .
But then quickly added , reading <NAME> ’ s face : ‘ No .
Who was it whose least word did what his utmost means could not ?
<NAME> <NAME> glanced with a troubled eye at us and grudgingly nodded assent .
Once—once—I found myself on deck .
We do not appear to understand each other yet .
These are the corporate beggars .
It 's as good as another . ''
There 's more where that come from .
How long was I to bear this ?
I have supposed the head to be all-sufficient .
<NAME> , ma ’ am , work ; we must all work .
`` I beg your pardon , miss ! ''
The latter so received it , and remained silent .
‘ Well , <NAME> , how have you got on without me all day ?
His mind would run upon that spot .
‘ But I am acquainted with these chaps , ’ said <NAME> .
This paper I part with now .
His recent despondency , not to say despair , was gone in a moment .
I don ’ t know that , ’ said <NAME> .
It was a very genteel entertainment , very handsomely served .
She ’ s deep , <NAME> , deep , but <NAME> is deeper .
What can you two be together ?
He , self-important , unbending , formal , austere .
She ’ s far away , she ’ s far away !
Proud I am sure to have the honour !
’ Tis for that. ’ ‘ Well , well , ’ said he .
Is there none in this room ?
He was contented , you will say .
'Not a bit of it , ' replied <NAME> .
‘ Finish by telling me how your father left you , <NAME> .
You are hasty in thinking that I mean to check you .
‘ How could I help myself ?
<NAME> stood at <NAME> ’ s elbow .
‘ You have heard <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , turning to me .
`` Of course you may , cousin <NAME> . ''
I could not see my father weep , and sit by , careless .
A hard one to me , but it is a necessary one .
This was one of the consequences of getting into good society .
I had cut the connexion .
Go back again. ’ ‘ No mistake , ’ returned <NAME> .
As there is no doubt they were .
Your necessities are greater than mine . ''
A very well conducted family indeed , the Chiveries .
Nothing else that he knows on .
What did I tell you when we came away from <NAME> that time ?
I never speak to him at such an hour .
I 'm always writing for Ma .
‘ I did this for years ; long , long years they were .
‘ You claim to have one plain motive in all you do yourself .
You do not know of what service it might be .
`` It 's no fault of yours , sir ; but you shall judge .
I have been called picturesque myself .
It is the light of <NAME> . ''
BEFORE leaving <NAME> , I devoted one day to an excursion to <NAME> .
‘ Fine mornin ’ , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , senior .
Shake hands with it on .
They always went on agen me about the Devil .
I was in this family before you were born .
I disgrace nobody and cumber nobody ; that 's something .
' I would not have had them here , for the world . '
‘ <NAME> , you are inconsiderate : you expect too much of your sister .
My <NAME> says she has been `` bored to death . ''
They set off Florence very much , to his fancy ; but not himself .
I have been throwed , all sorts of styles , all my life ! ''
<NAME> cake , covered with <NAME> , silver , and true-lovers ’ knots .
He had reached the old house at last -- how hot the room was .
They are not at home .
I know not where to go .
“ It depends upon how you dewelop your talents .
You hag , you cat , you dog , you brimstone barker ! ''
My guardian did not seek to dissuade me , and I went .
asked <NAME> , in a low voice , of <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> ’ s hollow down by the flare is not there now .
I never have any money .
<NAME> flew swiftly by , and summer came .
Yes , <NAME> thought she had better go with me .
`` Then it was your young man who came for me .
The <NAME> of My Resolution XIV .
‘ Sir. ’ Stay here. ’ <NAME> seemed uncertain .
‘ <NAME> , you amaze me , ’ cried <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> couldn ’ t bear the climate , my dear .
says <NAME> slightly , `` we have n't got much good out of <NAME> .
<NAME> up everybody else , and welcome .
As we advanced , I began to feel misgivings that my companion lost confidence .
`` Somebody 's been making free here ! ''
‘ Is he as soft as ever ?
It was too much for Mrs. <NAME> , who immediately rose .
‘ Hold your tongue , sir , ’ said <NAME> .
What can I do to save him , sir ? '
<NAME> <NAME> , my amiable subject , you will get your money .
‘ But why did you tell her ?
‘ This is a good beginning , ’ he said bitterly .
<NAME> , I wo n't be smothered any more .
I am not a traitor. ” “ He lies ! ” cried the smith .
The cook and housemaid screamed .
‘ Is there anybody at home ?
'That 's not the point , ' said the doctor , mysteriously .
How are you ? ’ ( very shortly . )
I had never been shown my mama 's grave .
‘ Well , <NAME> , ’ said Dr Lumbey , ‘ this makes six .
This is the writing of <NAME> .
'If you knew what I am sometimes , you would pity me , indeed .
<NAME> dismiss that from your consideration .
`` You 're not tall enough to reach the tub ! ''
Let me put your shawl tidy .
`` My dear , I do n't know it , '' said I .
Very glad indeed to have the pleasure .
Not I , I hope ! ’ ‘ You hope , indeed !
Can I hope that she will still remain the same <NAME> as of old ?
‘ I hope that ’ s <NAME> ! ’ said <NAME> .
He asked her , after short consideration , why she supposed so .
Why , I think that sometimes. ’ ‘ You are laughing , <NAME> .
‘ Play ! ’ suddenly cried the bowler .
`` No more did n't I of mine , '' cries Guster .
‘ There ’ s a friend he took to very much at last .
<NAME> back , look back , and see if we are pursued !
I believe your father is acquainted with his daughter <NAME> ’ s writing .
I ’ m a going to seek my Em ’ ly .
This was very disagreeable to a guilty mind .
Whether they turned into it on his movement or on hers matters little .
There was something in this .
Accompanying <NAME> to the gate , she as closely watched what followed .
Nothing of any kind was missing .
Where am I to wait for her ?
I can speak to no one else about him , but poor Kit .
It was the peculiarity of the nuptials that they were all Bride .
‘ <NAME> down , <NAME> , ’ said Mr Toots .
I asked if the brickmaker 's wife were ill , but <NAME> said no .
‘ I ask you , <NAME> , are you frightened ?
‘ No , of course not , ’ he assented .
I am very sorry I intruded , I am sure .
‘ We ’ ll go and look at ‘ em. ’ Away we went .
Some of us have damp ways , and some of us have dry ways .
‘ I say nothing of his plea for claiming my confidence .
In whatever state she walked away , she certainly did not walk back again .
<NAME> , <NAME> , this long while !
<NAME> <NAME> , open your eyes , that ’ s a love !
At this sally , the boys laughed .
`` Why did you not tell me , Mrs .
‘ You don ’ t know who he is !
“ You acted noble , my boy , ” said he .
Then our brother was drawn -- swiftly -- to drunkenness .
I am afraid you ’ ll find me very dull .
They were now by an avenue of trees .
I hope they will manage their little income. ’ ‘ Oh !
‘ I am not very likely to , ’ rejoined <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> ’ s brow darkened during the recital .
`` You are very poor , ai n't you ? ''
The black driver dances like a madman .
One Dowager , <NAME> calls it lip-salve .
`` Not much of that , sir , though that HAS happened .
‘ “ Stay , love , ” cried the young lady .
Plashwater Weir <NAME> ! ’ The bargeman stopped , and looked back .
‘ Ah , <NAME> ? ’ said <NAME> .
To a poor one most . ''
‘ More shame for you , ’ retorted the nurse .
<NAME> and ventilation , drainage and water-service , all of the primest quality .
Revived by soup , <NAME> discourses mildly of the <NAME> with <NAME> and <NAME> .
It is in the hands of my solicitor .
‘ It seems improbable because it is improbable , ’ his friend returned .
of the honour of his alliance .
<NAME> at him while I ask the way , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Son of Bitherstone of <NAME> .
<NAME> could not but assent again .
I make response , 'Tall as a spectre .
he had never played with three thorough-paced female card-players before .
The closing of the door recalled him to himself .
But it 's a weak chance if he 'd come , sir ! ''
Stumbled against them. ’ ‘ The people ? ’ ‘ Yes .
How much are you out of pocket ?
I don ’ t know her ! ’ I knew her .
‘ I promise , ’ said <NAME> .
You separated yourself from my affairs .
Has this letter any connexion with dear little <NAME> ?
<NAME> <NAME> ’ s world was peopled with profligates , and he acted accordingly .
The furniture was all very solid and good , like his watch-chain .
You are -- hum -- quite accurate , I have no doubt .
'Wounded desperate , miss , ' replied <NAME> , with indescribable complacency .
‘ Humph ! ’ retorted <NAME> , looking at the fire .
A housekeeper would be acceptable over yonder at the <NAME> , for instance .
“ 'Not dead , ' said I ; 'but like to die . '
P'raps they would n't do it if I wos to go myself .
And now to see him after all , and in a prison too !
`` Why have you told my story to so many persons ? ''
‘ Very bad , ’ said the landlord .
‘ You ’ ll go home very soon , you will .
Look to your feet , <NAME> , for we shall try your boots .
'You seem out of humour , <NAME> . '
I am not very old , you may say .
‘ Have I startled you ? ’ he asked .
<NAME> bowed and stepped forward .
I have derived inexpressible comfort from it .
I saw <NAME> lay her beads down .
What should I have lost ?
Had her attractions been manifested first to him -- or <NAME> ?
I had been afraid until then to say a word about the play .
Thinks it long enough for <NAME> .
Can I have a word with you ? ’ ‘ <NAME> .
Two cognovits -- take care of them .
<NAME> <NAME> with it !
‘ You can ’ t be trusted for a moment .
And this was the first passage of <NAME> ’ s first love .
He has not a large business , but he is a very respectable man .
“ Not in season ! ” says I .
They left you , you say -- at those races , as I understand .
'Not one little peep , miss ? '
‘ <NAME> , ’ said the <NAME> , in persuasive accents .
It can never be a solitary one to you and me .
However , we must take it as it comes .
‘ Men are not born able seamen .
Let me first see that he is in visiting order . '
<NAME> is in a new situation , and his prospects are very good indeed .
Such an ugly villain too ! ” said <NAME> .
A fourth did nothing but whistle .
`` This is a truly sad time , Mr .
She was still doing this , five minutes afterwards .
I deserve the reproach , which is very just indeed .
They were a full half-hour in conference .
‘ Come in , my love , ’ said <NAME> .
said <NAME> , folding his hands .
`` A fog , miss , '' said the young gentleman .
Why , my limbs only made my breath shorter when I used ‘ em .
Like his impudence ! ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> , loo , loo ; <NAME> , loo , loo !
‘ But oh , my friends and brothers !
<NAME> is but a poor calling .
The hysterics called up <NAME> .
In the meantime , Mrs. <NAME> kept unwinking watch and ward .
I think he would not be much the better for the mother .
Other professional men go out of town .
‘ I ’ m thinking how old you must be , ’ said <NAME> .
So the doctors ordered him off .
‘ You see and hear this foolish creature .
cried the doctor , as usual , all in a bustle .
‘ I didn ’ t seek it of him , poor lad .
And when I got downstairs , oh , how I cried !
I have no more to say .
I rather feel it to be so .
All through the night the wind blows , and abates not .
It is very doubtful whether <NAME> knows how to laugh .
We were twelve boarders , and there were two Miss Donnys , twins .
I saw a figure like myself lying dressed in my clothes on a bed .
`` And I never saw him ! ''
He lent it at ten , and thought that pretty high .
Now , the <NAME> has got its gentleman again , through me .
‘ Indeed ! ’ said <NAME> , surprised .
And I get too much of Mrs. <NAME> 's first and second . ''
If you do , I can put her in the way of getting one .
I never saw a sight so pitiful as this before !
I am the person you inquired for . '
`` I goes out to work , sir , '' returns <NAME> .
Or what avails a curse or blessing from a man like you ?
‘ That ain ’ t no word for it .
‘ Please to be seated , sir , ’ said Mrs. Sparsit .
“ You get me a file. ” He tilted me again .
`` She in all respects deserves it , '' says my Lady .
At a place where she worked , answered <NAME> , blushing .
<NAME> looked at him for the reason .
<NAME> was the first to change .
'Speak out , my friend , if you have anything to say .
`` The dearest friend I have ! ''
in quick reply to a gesture of dissent from the housekeeper .
‘ Come in , ’ said <NAME> .
However , if he won ’ t lead , I can ’ t follow .
Besides , that lonely girl with the dark hair runs in my head .
how to know the charm in its beginning !
The cat expands her wicked mouth and snarls at him .
I am sure it does no good .
But bring him here , upon this crowded deck .
But I expect a judgment .
‘ Ye-yes ; oh , yes , ’ replied <NAME> .
I would not lose her now , for all the treasures of the world .
It is she who should reproach ; not I .
Your sex have such a surprising animosity against one another when you do differ .
‘ Help your mother to get breakfast , <NAME> .
The candle was drawn back , and the face disappeared .
‘ No , not all of you , ’ said the strange man emphatically .
That night I knew he had a false and thankless heart .
`` Do n't scold the old lady .
The lamps looked pale , and shook as if they were cold .
'Well , and what if he did , you little ungrateful wretch ? '
Not go as I have said ? ''
But <NAME> couldn ’ t get happily out of it .
I was a good-enough-tempered man once , I believe .
‘ So your name ’ s <NAME> , eh ? ’ said <NAME> .
‘ In-deed ! ’ rejoined <NAME> , cringing excessively .
Hold me , somebody , while I laugh it out . '
The warm blaze alone defied it , and leaped and sparkled merrily .
I will if I can .
‘ Not a very old prisoner _that_ !
that ’ s all , is it ? ’ said <NAME> .
But do n't you fret yourself on that score .
says <NAME> , greedily curious .
he cried impatiently , stamping his foot upon the ground .
Come on , and do n't stand preaching there . '
Every night my Lady casually asks her maid , `` Is <NAME> come ? ''
At last I done it .
The younger brother stood apart .
This affords charming food for contemplation .
But the horses is off .
‘ Well then , the way was this .
He had nothing with him but his boat , and came on apace .
To pass , <NAME> , from the ensign to the captain . ''
I asked him what he thought of <NAME> ?
Mr Feeder in a black coat was at the bottom .
Such d ’ licious broth and wine !
She felt she must do that , or he might suspect the truth .
‘ How goes the world this forenoon , gentlemen ?
<NAME> W. had better have come here , and <NAME> too .
‘ My pet , if you please .
<NAME> said it to me , but I had not spoken .
‘ Upon my soul , they ’ re perfect .
This old gentleman , or the <NAME> ? ''
We parted , overwhelmed with grief ; and I think <NAME> enjoyed herself completely .
<NAME> <NAME> was in great force , and looked astonishingly young .
The countenance of <NAME> fell , and anxiety overspread his features .
It seems to strike your fancy , dear . '
Do let us resolve ourselves into a <NAME> of the whole <NAME> !
‘ It created an immense sensation .
I turned directly , came back , and looked again .
This fellow is pigeon-hearted and light-headed .
But she uttered no sound , and her breathing was no slower .
All this , I say , is yesterday ’ s event .
‘ I mean of the foreign man , ’ <NAME> explained .
‘ I can ’ t bear to look at you .
chatters Grandfather Smallweed , swallowing his rage .
I will pray for them , and believe that they will arrive .
<NAME> will read it for her , and tell her what to do .
The person who does copying . ''
‘ Over and over again. ’ ‘ Just like me !
<NAME> has no such advantage .
For what 's a door-chain when she 's got one always up ?
‘ Very sensitive ; that ’ s a pity .
You may depend upon it , it would have a superb effect . '
<NAME> , I beg your pardon ; this is my friend <NAME> .
I neither wish to spare myself nor to be spared .
It may not be the same . '
The barrier between Mr Dombey and his wife was not weakened by time .
‘ You , you won ’ t be angry with me now .
He has been doing so ever since it fell dark .
<NAME> , no less steadily , kept them in sight .
Mr Dombey goes upon a journey 21 .
“ It is true what madame says , ” observed <NAME> .
Do you know what would become of the <NAME> in that case ?
‘ And yet with such a true and gallant spirit , ’ pursued <NAME> .
‘ Oh , <NAME> , when ? ’ ‘ Now , ’ said <NAME> .
Besides which , she is so charmingly ugly , ’ relapsing into languor .
These five year I ha ’ paid her .
<NAME> has been out a dozen times , looking for you , <NAME> .
cried the Dodger at this moment , ' I heard the tinkler . '
And he and <NAME> led the way .
‘ Leave your nephew here , for the present .
`` Oh , yes , you tell me so , '' returns <NAME> .
You have n't got the family face . ''
‘ A joke is wasted upon me , sir .
<NAME> and mould began to lurk in closets .
Because I wish to see you always at your best .
I am going home. ’ ‘ Deed , sir ?
They had determined not to admire <NAME> ’ s picture .
But my younger daughter , <NAME> , rather worries and vexes my thoughts .
‘ But he is one of that family from whom you took a nurse .
‘ <NAME> , ’ said the visitor .
“ My good <NAME> , so he was .
Still , I must confess he is not without faults , love . ''
Here one of you boys , carry that show into the barn .
inquired <NAME> , turning to the doctor .
‘ It strikes me rather as a hang-MAN air , ’ returned <NAME> .
cried the girl , pressing her hair back with her hands .
He might be , or he might not be .
<NAME> <NAME> made at the door .
‘ Oh , how good of you !
‘ I was going there , ’ said the surly man .
`` I always give too much to ladies .
I am going to take out the licence .
I will try , then , to forgive him his share of blame .
He had been known in <NAME> as <NAME> .
The men obeyed , and the two were left alone together .
`` If you think so , guardian , it is right . ''
Have you , though ? ’ returned <NAME> , his eyes sparkling with delight .
She won ’ t come in MY way , he says .
<NAME> <NAME> on his legs again .
‘ Mr Merdle , this is -- ha -- indeed an honour .
But , he never mentioned her as a woman .
Still the <NAME> pointed downward to the grave by which it stood .
Then , why don ’ t they improve it , ma ’ am !
‘ This is the hardest trial I have had .
I heard him say so . '
6 , in the court. ’ ‘ There is a double wallflower at <NAME> .
What does she try to do ?
‘ Do you see where we are ? ’ ‘ Yes , my love .
It was a happy time .
Nothing disagreeable should ever be looked at .
<NAME> , ’ said I , bolting it out with some difficulty .
She only said , ‘ Oh , dear , dear <NAME> !
<NAME> , evermore. ’ This , blotted with tears , was the letter .
<NAME> here , <NAME> , <NAME> .
I have cast up the years of her age , year after year .
he says we ’ re dear , ’ cried the oldest and ugliest teacher .
'Do you mean to say anything , you young shaver ? '
Will you tell them to send him up ? ''
Only come to see me as if you come by chance alonger <NAME> .
There was poison in the house .
<NAME> in the helpless state that you see me in , is naturally anxious .
The name has quite escaped me .
A substitute for a Fire .
‘ Besides you , I mean , <NAME> , ’ returned the craven <NAME> .
When shall we look upon his like again ?
demanded <NAME> , pouring question upon question with great volubility .
I have none to spare myself , having to attend court very soon .
' I am nobody ; do n't consult me , pray .
‘ What , haven ’ t you seen her lately ? ’ said <NAME> .
I don ’ t want him any longer .
I brought him on purpose for you .
`` What was your remark , my dear friend ? ''
`` Well , sir , '' says <NAME> .
' I 'll answer for that boy 's truth with my life ! '
Meanwhile <NAME> and <NAME> walk to and fro , quietly talking together .
He paused at the next door in the passage , and tapped gently thereat .
‘ No , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ I ain ’ t .
This had better be the end of it .
Though it has not yet finally disappeared , it is dwindling daily .
cried Fagin , following him hastily .
You 're no trouble at all .
‘ Thank you ! ’ He certainly never had seen this old woman before .
There was not one touch of tenderness or pity in it .
Take it from your mother ?
This is him as I have seen brought up by hand .
We who were left walked on towards the house .
‘ I respect you , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> with emotion .
‘ Let me , oh do let me .
<NAME> let me take these bags from you .
‘ He ’ s very sorry for giving offence .
Of <NAME> , conflicting rumours went abroad .
<NAME> <NAME> allowed <NAME> to obey it , in silence .
I have a scheme to develop , little woman .
It were the Poison-bottle on table .
I have shown you now , more plainly , that I do .
But now a fearful circumstance occurs .
This business was capitally described in the advertisement , <NAME> .
`` Would you allow me to get it filled for you ? ''
