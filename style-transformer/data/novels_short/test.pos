<NAME> to see it accomplished , and yet patient , she waited for the last fall , as for the ripeness and fulness of the harvest of her hopes .
And it was clear he meant to do it .
'We had our eyes fixed full upon each other ; and I could swear to him . '
' I shall not come to you to take lessons in the art , ma ' am ! ' retorted <NAME> .
How it got into his head , I can ' t say ; I can only say that it never got out .
' Mind that , <NAME> ! ' he added , with unusual energy .
She took a step backward , and put out her hands in an undecided frightened way , as if to keep me off .
All the partnership books and papers must remain in our possession ; all your books and papers ; all money accounts and securities , of both kinds .
On we go , all night , and by-and-by the day begins to break , and presently the first cheerful rays of the warm sun come slanting on us brightly .
When she first saw me , might she not be a little shocked and disappointed ?
Where the dexterity of the lawyers , eager to discover a flaw ?
" To hear the names he 's giving me !
" I would like to kiss her ! "
It 's a freehold , by <NAME> ! " " Is it indeed ?
I am in want of nothing .
What a sweet singer you was when you first come !
' Oh , if you please , you ' re to come upstairs , ' replied the tailor ' s daughter , with a smile .
But they recall no feeling of disgust or reluctance .
' If you can direct us , do .
For , coming along I had thought well of what I was going to say .
She suffers him to stand by the door and asks him what he wants .
It was not too much trouble , and Mr <NAME> came up .
Joy of D. who dances round J. while he eats his supper .
There ' s the <NAME> establishment , and there ' s your mother ' s <NAME> .
He saw us , as we took leave of each other .
From the goodness of all about me I derived such consolation as I can never think of unmoved .
I saw them quite hard at work , when I looked down through the open skylight .
' You have forgotten the water , sir , ' said <NAME> .
At that time , and for a good many weeks after that time , <NAME> was constant in his visits .
' You wouldn ' t mind my asking if it happened to be a job as you was come about , sir , would you ? ' asked <NAME> wistfully .
she cried , in a hollow voice .
The old man paused a moment while it was gently closed and fastened on the inside , and satisfied that this was done , walked on at a slow pace .
You have been a pleasant room to me , dear room .
We are extra official. " I cordially assented .
' I haven ' t nerve to play even if I could .
" Liz , you 're tired and ill. Let me take him . "
The surprise of <NAME> at this summary proceeding , great as it was , was immeasurably exceeded by the astonishment of the doctor .
" By my soul , I thought him the worst-looking dog I had ever beheld when he was telling me to take the turning to the right .
But it was not my time yet , I was glad to tell her , for I should have been vexed to take her away then .
' I thought his cowardice and servility were the best guarantee for his keeping silence .
' I must go home , ' replied <NAME> , looking wildly round .
" The tall man is lost , and he is sought -- how many months ?
Mrs. Markleham -- you have not forgotten Mrs. Markleham ? ' Forgotten the <NAME> !
<NAME> <NAME> is not here ? "
What have these pests of the earth been doing to _you_ ?
I was ingenuous and young , and I thought so .

His neck was saved for the halter , but he got some painful and slow-healing injury for his trouble ?
His door was opened , and the head of the elder <NAME> was put in a very little way , without being turned towards him .
There were three young women in adjoining cells , all convicted at the same time of a conspiracy to rob their prosecutor .
Your manner , which I must say does not seem intended to propitiate , induces me to think it possible .
I devote myself at daybreak to-morrow morning , to bringing <NAME> here .
And how different the parting with them was , from any she had expected , and most of all from that which she had oftenest pictured to herself .
And he is in prison . "
" I was new here once , " said <NAME> .
It was a great comfort and surprise to me to find him in his low state cheerful and looking forward .
' This man alarming you again !
' <NAME> true , ' returned <NAME> , shaking his head : ' but I meant a life of habit , <NAME> -- that sort of custom .
cried Monks , in a voice which , from its very suppression , seemed only the more furious .
My aunt took her hand in hers , and laughed .
At last , biting her thin lips , and bridling up , she said -- ' It can ' t be .
I bar , ' said <NAME> , <NAME> , thoughtfully .
I really don ' t know , <NAME> .
My deary , deary , deary , wife of <NAME> and mother of his little child !
When we came near the churchyard , we had to cross an embankment , and get over a stile near a sluice-gate .
said Mrs. Bumble , in a voice of command .
' I didn ' t know it would be so ; it was impossible for me to foresee it .
' He ' s shocked at the way your father goes on in , ' replied Mrs. Weller .
That fellow ! ' said <NAME> , beating a lump of coal on the top of the fire , with the poker .
Then why should they quarrel with us ?
That 's a nice innocent place to live in , ai n't it ? "
" It makes no pretensions , but it is a comfortable little place , I hope , and will be more so with such bright young looks in it .
It had been almost dark before , but now it seemed quite dark , and soon afterwards very dark .
Its gentle touch , though it had been light and instantaneous , appeared still present to the old man 's sense of feeling .
When they are shut into the back room , they speak low .
' <NAME> , ' cried <NAME> eagerly , as he looked from the coach window , ' they are at the corner of the lane still !
' Ah , my beloved Lizzie ! ' he said , faintly .
He was taken on board , and instantly manacled at the wrists and ankles .
hush ! ' cried <NAME> , suddenly starting up , and covering <NAME> ' s mouth with his trembling hand .
Now , <NAME> , I am employed by <NAME> , <NAME> , to follow her and find her , to save her and take her his forgiveness .
' How now ? ' said <NAME> , looking sternly round .
' My house , ' answered the disconsolate <NAME> , affected perhaps by its loneliness .
The other had that likeness too -- as you have -- but was not the same .
Never were such shouts heard as those which greeted <NAME> ' s efforts to fix the sugar-loaf hat on his head , by way of entering the garden in style .
The pint-pots were great strokes of genius : but the milk-can was a perfect masterpiece . '
' No , not exactly. ' ' Figures of some sort , I would venture a bet , ' said <NAME> .
You understand to what I allude , Mr Wegg ?
Give him several to take away .
' " Who calls so loud ? " ' cried <NAME> .
Some evil-minded person who had seen him come upstairs with a handsome watch in his hand , perhaps .
The weightiest of men had said to projectors , ' Now , what name have you got ?
I was prepared for a great change in him , after what I had heard from <NAME> , but his appearance shocked me .
She observes him very cautiously , as though mentally feeling her way to her next remark .
But he has repressive power , and she has none .
Everything within the house and without , seemed to be the perfection of neatness and order .
' Why , it ' s that very house ; she ' s been living there these six weeks .
' She was off somewhere at daybreak this morning .
That you can find out .
Mr <NAME> was much distressed when the quarter of an hour expired , and came hopping in , a very bad second .
Yet what did <NAME> expect ?
I have got three sacks of ladies ' hair below , but none so beautiful and fine as this .
Spiritual revelations were conceded to <NAME> at that favoured period , as at this .
I judged him to be about my own age , but he was much taller , and he had a way of spinning himself about that was full of appearance .
' <NAME> ' t ! ' Old Sol endeavoured to assume a cheery look , and smiled across the little table at him as pleasantly as he could .
When he had said goodbye all round and came to <NAME> , he could not but mark the difference between their present separation and their parting at <NAME> .
My first question when I saw <NAME> had been of course , whether all was well down the river ?
" And as <NAME> and you are happily good friends , I should like to know , " said my guardian , " what you think , my dear .
' Do you think they WERE crooked ? ' said <NAME> , in an insinuating tone .
I told him seven shillings .
They expected me home before <NAME> ; but had no idea of my returning so soon .
' When he ' s well he do , ' she answered .
This made him doubt whether he had locked his door last night , and feel a little surprised at having a companion in the room .
What do you say ? ' ' To the system ? ' inquired Traddles , looking grave .
I have seen passion in many forms , but I have never seen it in such a form as that .
Never let us be parted any more , <NAME> .
If we have n't all three met here without meaning it ! "
It was remarkable ( but perhaps the wretched life he had led accounted for it ) that he was the least anxious of any of us .
' I must leave you somewhere for a few minutes , ' said the schoolmaster , at length breaking the silence into which they had fallen in their gladness .
' Oh ! ' sneered <NAME> , looking after him as she entered .
And there was a passive congeniality between them , besides this active one .
<NAME> <NAME> ' s oration upon this occasion , together with the debate thereon , is entered on the Transactions of the <NAME> .
A noticeable relaxation of discipline had for some few days pervaded the <NAME> ' House .
said <NAME> when they had returned .
Turning his eyes towards the door , they encountered the new-comer ; and in him , through his rags and dirt , he recognised the familiar features of <NAME> .
' See after your friend , and be in the way to-morrow at one .
He was a year younger than I , and young-looking even when that allowance was made .
Oh , if you knew how my heart is torn .
<NAME> him to drink it , <NAME> . '
The little dressmaker stood up at the foot of the bed , humming her song , and nodded to him brightly .
If I am correctly informed , he is cognizant of the business on which I wish to speak to you . '
Good-bye , <NAME> ! ' and with a kiss for each Miss <NAME> turned to the door .
' You bring Trent to me .
Stay. ' He hastily put away a padlocked cash-box that was on the table , and substituted in its stead an empty purse .
Where can I have it , <NAME> ? ' <NAME> ' s knowledge of <NAME> was extensive and peculiar .
Every one waited with his grasp set , and his body bent down to the work , ready to reverse and wind in .
I know that in the novelty of possessing a tithe of such means as <NAME> has placed at your disposal , ladies are apt to run into a sudden extreme .
I could no more have removed my eyes from her pale face than I could have stirred from the bench on which I sat .
That done , he replaced the candle and took the hand again .
I have been thinking , sir , for some time , that I was getting it , and now I have got it .
<NAME> <NAME> had been looking for us .
Morning came ; and the little cottage was lonely and still .
' Ah , <NAME> -- a precious seedy-looking customer .
This was first put into my head by his seeing a shoot that had come up in the night , and saying , " What , <NAME> ?
The wickets were pitched , and so were a couple of marquees for the rest and refreshment of the contending parties .
I appeal to our mutual friend Smallweed whether he has or has not heard me remark that I ca n't make him out . "
'Your tale is of the longest , ' observed Monks , moving restlessly in his chair .
Her little stock of money amounted to but a few guineas .
Upon reference to the book , it appeared that the dozen secretaryships had dwindled down to one .
Now , the man who did the sexton ' s duty was a little older than he , though much more active .
If I don ' t brood over all I want , it is the better for me , and not the worse for anyone .
No favoring in this shop .
" Hah ! " said <NAME> at last , as he moved towards the papers on the table .
I wonder you do n't starve in your own way also .
That more than this she would never ( and he was well persuaded of the steadfastness of her resolution ) for any human consideration disclose .
Gravely , <NAME> , for the subject is grave enough , you know how it is as well as I do .
Is that the boat , where I see a light yonder ? ' ' That ' s the boat , ' said I .
Their money may be soon got out of them , without violence , ' said the man .
What the deuce is it all about ?
To put before you any appeal to reconsider your purpose or to set narrow limits to it , would be , I feel , not less so .
I am incapable of designs .
<NAME> <NAME> kept his word , and remained unmarried , for two years .
' Get off ! ' cried <NAME> , indignant at this process , and vainly endeavouring to extricate himself from the grasp of his enthusiastic acquaintance .
' You ' re the best of human creatures .
I am glad to see you , and glad you are not too proud to know me . "
<NAME> <NAME> was very red and hot , for your outlaws are desperate fellows to shout .
' None of your close shavers the <NAME> ain ' t .
It is lowly , but airy , open at the back , and considered one of the 'ealthiest outlets .
' Never read anything but letters and accounts .
With the thought , her purity and goodness came before him in their brightest light .
He was obviously very ill at ease , however .
<NAME> does not see , otherwise , what he has to do with marriage .
It was <NAME> , <NAME> . "
' Here they are , you see , ' said Mr Meagles .
' To ask you if you ' ll have another rasher would be unmeaning flattery , for it would make you thirsty all day .
They parted , therefore , in the friendliest manner , and with the kindest feeling on both sides .
" How long should I have to hold out ? "
Come here , my little witch !
But I never own to it before her .
The child readily complied , and he went out .
<NAME> of paint , bare of paper on the walls , bare of furniture , bare of experience of human life .
' Then what do you think , mother , has become of ' em ?
A man with no hat , and with broken shoes , and with an old rag tied round his head .
I know as well that you feel none towards me .
" It-can't-be , " muttered <NAME> , retrospectively , and idling his glass ( which fortunately was a small one ) again .
Give him time to get rid of it , you know .
To an unfortunate bachelor of a fellow who has lived alone all his life , you know , it ' s positively delicious .
<NAME> <NAME> eyed the old man with great curiosity , and the remainder of the company smiled , and looked on in silence .
said <NAME> , walking again at a great pace , with a candle in his hand that had gone out .
In both , there were several knots of loungers , squalid and miserable , but now with a manifest sense of power enthroned on their distress .
' Now , you are something like a genteel boy !
' <NAME> if I can make it out ! ' said he , staring at them .
' The younger brother had been a traveller in many countries , and had made his pilgrimage through life alone .
Do you mind me ? ' Glad to be released , the woman quickly disappeared .
Unfortunately <NAME> is no snuff-taker .
<NAME> wilt uphold her here to her last hour .
One fair evening , when <NAME> was not inclined to go out , my aunt and I strolled up to the <NAME> ' s cottage .
One of these is his own sleeping chamber : the other is his nephew ' s .
Touch my face with yours , in case I should not hold out till you come back .
The moment the result was known , the minority ( a large one ) cheerfully yielded to the rest , and withdrew all kind of opposition .
" And now , " says <NAME> , stirring the fire , " touching this same bundle of letters .
I would have withdrawn , but the <NAME> made a gesture to detain me , and I remained .
Can you feel quite assured of that , my dear ? "
" The door is locked then , my friend ? " said <NAME> , surprised .
When she spoke to him , he listened , and in due course answered , but never looked at her , that I could see .
The darkness found him occupied with these thoughts .
How are you now , my dear ?
Before we go , I should like to speak to him a moment .
' Bless thee a hundred times !
<NAME> had also been appointed Secretary , and had been enjoined to give instant notice of resignation to <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , for ever and ever .
What a state of mind I was in !
You could make no discovery in reference to me that would do me the least service or give me the least pleasure .
Oh , he is a worthy gentleman , <NAME> !
' Fill your glass , and pass the wine , ' said the indefatigable visitor .
And now go ! " At the mention of each name , she had struck the table with her stick in a new place .
' To be sure , ' said <NAME> .
<NAME> was to be my travelling companion , though I am sure I wanted none and would willingly have left her at home .
That ' s what I feel so strong , you know !
<NAME> <NAME> could not determine this in his mind .
When I have come to you , at last ( as I have always done ) , I have come to peace and happiness .
And whatever opinion you take away of me , shall make no difference in my remembrance of you .
' In one instant , after the clock struck two , the whole of this deserted and quiet spot had become a scene of most extraordinary life and animation .
' Here ' s <NAME> , dear Mrs Quilp , ' said her husband .
There ' s no such name now .
That boy , <NAME> , ' said the Major in a lower tone , ' will live in history .
I say no more of that .
' Look on to the end -- ' <NAME> was beginning to remonstrate , when he caught at the words : ' Ah !
Then this respectability of <NAME> is brought into powerful play against them .
I am bent upon it -- so is <NAME> .
" We have borne this a long time , " said <NAME> , turning her eyes again upon <NAME> .
<NAME> night ! ' She took the hand he offered her , and gratefully and almost reverently raised it to her lips .
It is impossible ; it is a child ' s tale .
It was what was always being dinned into you and me at school ; it ' s what goes down best .
' You have answered very well , <NAME> .
He ain ' t a father to neither .
Do n't keep him too warm , ma'am ; but be careful that you do n't let him be too cold ; will you have the goodness ? '
Says you -- what name is it ? ' ' Her name ? ' ' Ah ! ' said <NAME> , with a nod of his head .
<NAME> ho ! ' ' What ' s the matter ? ' demanded <NAME> , looking sleepily up .
What could I say but yes !
Perhaps some momentary recollection of the story of the <NAME> may have been in her mind .
Let us go forth again into the cheerful streets .
With these last words she snaps her teeth together as if her mouth closed with a spring .
As there was only one house in the enclosure , there was no room for uncertainty , so he went up the steps of that house and knocked .
' To bed again , poor boy ! ' ' Ay ! ' cried the child , in a burst of despair .
She WAS worth any six , and she IS worth any six .
" You know I do ; you see me do it . "
I forgot Mr Pancks last time .
" Says <NAME> : 'Why , you fool , do n't you know she 's got a living body ?
' Is there nothing else , <NAME> ? ' I said .
' What shall I get by it ? ' asked the driver .
Both the private father and the Father of the <NAME> were strong within him then .
<NAME> <NAME> took no pains to conceal his implacable dislike of <NAME> , yet he never referred it , however distantly , to such a source .
Beadles are but men : and <NAME> smiled .
' They ' ve got all the lot , <NAME> !
<NAME> , my good woman -- dear me , what a situation -- pray consider. -- Mrs .
That cruel man with the wooden leg aggravated my sufferings .
" You are right , " he returned .
' Now with regard to the matter on which I , with the concurrence of these gentlemen , sent for you , ' said <NAME> .
' You say , <NAME> , ' pursued Mr Dorrit , ' that you think you require time .
Everybody gave me a present .
Save me from Jere-_mi_-ah ! ' Mr <NAME> had made a run at her , but <NAME> had caught him in his arms midway .
I could tell her nothing but that there was such a sister ; beyond that , I knew nothing .
Never ! ' Again the <NAME> inclined his head and showed his teeth , and seemed to say , ' Remarkable indeed !
' <NAME> has improved even in this little time , I have no doubt , ' said <NAME> , glancing proudly at her daughter .
' Believe ! ' retorted the other , ' can anybody doubt it ?
' That ' s me , ' said the lady .
By our own schemes , I mean our joint interest .
' There is some spell about that boy , ' said <NAME> , grinding his teeth .
' Never , ' said my aunt , ' be mean in anything ; never be false ; never be cruel .
" Well to be sure ! " said <NAME> , astounded .
' It ' s the second floor , <NAME> , ' said the same voice ; ' what a stupid thing you are !
' Ah , dear me ! ' sighed <NAME> , giving me the tea-caddy scoop instead of her fingers .
He had been prepared to miss her very much , but not so much .
' Can you drink anything ? ' was his next inquiry .
' <NAME> ' t be frightened , mistress , ' said <NAME> , after a pause .
You are different from other children , <NAME> , because you were not born , like them , in common sinfulness and wrath .
Would you have the kindness to make a few plasters and put ' em on ?
Why , then he lurked about and dogged me in the street .
Bred in meanness and hard dealing , this had rescued him to be a man of honourable mind and open hand .
' Well , ma ' am , she will soon be quite comfortable , I hope , ' returned <NAME> .
Bless your eyes , here 's old <NAME> .
' You will find her , ' pursued my aunt , ' as good , as beautiful , as earnest , as disinterested , as she has always been .
" <NAME> , will you allow me ?
' You are cold ; I felt you tremble .
It is not until they are gone , that <NAME> moves .
Well then , I will say no more about it .
And is your brother acquainted with all this , my dear ? ' ' Oh , no , no , ' replied <NAME> , changing colour .
' By the upsetting of a boat in which his nurse had no business to have put him , ' said the Major .
The Jew shook his head impatiently , and said in a whisper , 'Is _he_ here ? '
But you have not told me where he is now , <NAME> .
<NAME> YOU off now , father ? "
But he remained too late .
Never separate the two , like the heathen waggoner .
Two or three violins and a wind instrument from the Opera band reside within its precincts .
When the <NAME> had said these words , ' Gentlemen , we will resume our studies at seven tomorrow , ' the pupils bowed again , and went to bed .
I have heard her , many a time , talk just like him .
Where sat the many legislators of coarse threats ; of words and blows such as coalheavers deal upon each other , when they forget their breeding ?
The figure had plunged down the precipice , and she felt herself , as it were , attending on the body .
' I scarcely know of what , ' replied the girl .
I fancied , as I looked at her , that I slipped hopelessly back into the coarse and common boy again .
' Indeed ? ' was all she answered .
They went out by another staircase , avoiding the lodge ; and coming into the front court-yard , now all quiet and deserted , gained the street .
" Of course I know that. " " How do you know it ? " said I .
' Is it not a good place ? ' ' Yes , yes , ' said the schoolmaster .
' This whelp is the only creature she cares for .
Though not before he had whispered something , on the door-mat , to the footman , in which there was the phrase ' old-fashioned ' -- for <NAME> heard it .
Not my fault ! ' and to pass on before the instant had elapsed which was requisite to his recovery of the realities about him .
And what do you intend to make of him , ma'am ?
I shall leave this at five o ' clock , and ride there on horseback .
It 's rare for you both that you went out early in life -- Judy to the flower business , and you to the law .
' Drink of this cup , you ' ll find there ' s a spell in its every drop ' gainst the ills of mortality .
The carriage was then so far in advance of me that two gentlemen had time to open the door and alight before I came up with it .
'What fancy have you got in your head now ? '
" What company is this , <NAME> ? "
He had been stoned in the streets .
But as he drew nearer and nearer home he forgot it again , and began to think how very dull and solitary the house would be inside .
The week passed away in a most delightful manner .
This flower-pot and stand , she bought herself .
It ' s a topic that I wouldn ' t touch upon , to any soul but you .
'And very grateful indeed , sir , for your goodness to me . '
<NAME> ! ' When <NAME> arrived at this point , he turned the corner at which he had been long hesitating , and fell fast asleep .
" Five more days , and then the day before the day !
Our own emotions are our recompense .
Let me first tell you , once for all , that it ' s of no use your paying visits to me .
Nor was the scenery , as we approached the junction of the <NAME> and <NAME> rivers , at all inspiriting in its influence .
' Like a demd native ? ' asked the husband .
Did History chronicle a king of men ?
' What of him ? ' ' <NAME> called , ' said <NAME> .
I rely on that promise .
He didn ' t wish to trouble nobody , and if he had troubled anybody by what he said , he asked pardon , that was all .
" For the honour of the family , I could even resolve to incommode you to that extent .
I have been under a Taboo in that infernal scoundrel ' s service .
For , the state of the man was murderous .
The top shelf in the right-hand corner -- oh ! '
How dare I say it is my sister ' s ! ' She was weeping still .
I thought you was poor , my improvident friend ! ' Why , <NAME> , how hard it was upon a man !
' And , my dear ! ' whispered <NAME> , ' tell the pretty little angel that I should so have liked to see her , only for a minute !
The house is a ruin , and the rats fly from it .
' Twas evident she knew not of the disaster .
" You come here to make a remarkably modest demand , which you have just stated , and it not being conceded , you will come again . "
When you lose , you ' re martyrs ; but I don ' t find that when you win , you look upon the other losers in that light .
How do they call her ?
When it thundered very loudly , he glanced towards <NAME> , having it in his mind that some of the tall chimneys might be struck by lightning .
I wonder what you will say when you come to this !
<NAME> <NAME> was meditating ; it might be that the insects brought to mind , some painful passage in his own past life .
' I know better , ' said <NAME> .
' I am , sir , ' replied <NAME> .
It is to be regretted , I suppose , but it could not be helped . "
I am not impertinently curious , but have a good object .
But I confess I do n't see why our young friend , in his degree , should not seek to invest himself with such poetry as is open to him .
You must not stir from my side during the whole interview .
' Mr <NAME> ? ' said the suitor .
<NAME> is quite sure of it .
Thank you for reminding me .
' And these heer pretty ones , ' said <NAME> .
It won ' t answer to have <NAME> about , while this business of ours is about .
It led him to nothing , and therefore is no great matter , save in the intention .
" Why , you 're six foot two , I suppose ? "
Even I , safe as an Englishman , and even <NAME> 's , important as they are to <NAME> credit , avoid all naming of the matter .
You know the horse-riders are famous for never minding what they say , ' addressing <NAME> .
' And calculated on it , ' she rejoined , ' and so pursued me .
In the first place because I want to profit by everything you tell me , and in the second place because I have no secrets from <NAME> . "
Not stumbling on the means after all , I was fain to go out to the adjacent Lodge and get the watchman there to come with his lantern .
The representatives of the <NAME> dropped in next , and Mr Merdle ' s physician dropped in next .
' And yesterday too , master. ' ' Dear me , you ' ve had a deal of trouble .
' Do you think he is in earnest , my dear Major ?
He advanced to meet them , and tenderly obliging the old man to lean upon his arm , conducted him with slow and trembling steps towards the house .
Oh so nice it was .
Twice , <NAME> knocked with a careful hand , and listened .
Still , there was no abatement in the storm , but it blew harder .
' The strange gentleman -- him as had his arm hurt -- a-kissin ' and huggin ' -- ' ' Who , <NAME> ?
I should have had it before to be of use to me .
But tell me his name , deary ! ' cried <NAME> .
Well , Mr Clennam , he addresses himself to the Government .
' <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> -- ' Law , civil power , and exekative ; them ' s my titles ; here ' s my authority .
I couldn ' t say at this minute , sir , whether it ' s two and two months , or whether it ' s two and five months .
The gentlemen soon saunter after them .
said the old lady : observing in great surprise , the look of awe with which the child regarded the painting .
Mr <NAME> took the lead , towing Mr Wegg , in order that his refractory leg might be promptly extricated from any pitfalls it should dig for itself .
It quite spoiled my pleasure for that night because it was so very embarrassing and so very ridiculous .
At this hour and by this light it changes into threatening hands raised up and menacing the handsome face with every breath that stirs .
'He can not be hardened in vice , ' said <NAME> ; 'It is impossible . '
What sort of stuff do you think I ' m made of ?
" I only said I would n't go without one of the servants came up to <NAME> , " returns <NAME> .
Now I have answered you , answer me .
His first impression was confirmed .
To a certain written statement respecting not wishing to be regarded in a certain light .
That ain ' t the worst on it , neither .
" You do n't mind these things ; neither does <NAME> .
The eldest Miss <NAME> is not a little girl .
But I counted twenty-three gentlemen in wigs who said they were " in it , " and none of them appeared to understand it much better than I .
Probably we shall make the most of it that is to be made. ' ' Probably , ' said <NAME> .
A woman , probably of not less than two-and-twenty , she might have been passed in the street for little more than half that age .
'Ca n't you look at the gentleman , you obstinate boy ? '
' Your wretched brother , ' said <NAME> .
' Is that all ? ' said the mother .
After another moment 's listening , <NAME> ( who was a good judge ) agreed , and <NAME> ( who was a bad judge ) agreed .
When he knew I saw him , he looked frightened ; for he started , and shrunk away .
' Was it real , now , or only to display the eyelashes ? ' Kate , looking anxiously towards the door , made no reply .
She had nothing else to tell him but that <NAME> ' s secret had no reference whatever to the cruel charge , or its withdrawal .
To come to tea here for ever ?
I thought I ' d try another room , and shake it off .
" No ; there are only two ; mother and daughter .
' Come on then , ' said <NAME> .
' <NAME> ' t you ? ' said the waiter .
My Aunt Astonishes Me XXXVII .
<NAME> ceased to be , within the shadow of the roof .
My husband drew a little nearer towards <NAME> , and I saw him solemnly lift up his hand to warn my guardian .
Never did wrap up enough ; ' the Major being buttoned to the chin .
We shall mount to a hundred soon .
Every kind of finer tendon and ligament that is in the nature of poultry to possess is developed in these specimens in the singular form of guitar-strings .
It was unavailing ; he extended his arm towards them , and made another violent effort .
He had not a word .
' I can , ' said <NAME> , almost aloud .
I looked at him eagerly when he looked at me , and slightly moved my hands and shook my head .
" But , my dear , " she went on in her mysterious way , " there 's a dreadful attraction in the place .
" Yes , my dear , " said I .
repeats Mrs. Rouncewell , " <NAME> !
<NAME> <NAME> raised his eyes piously to the ceiling in thankfulness ; and , bringing them down again to the brim of the cup , lifted it to his nose .
'And what have you got , my dear ? '
But you show it. ' ' Show what ?
What is her observation upon that ?
A month ' s notice terminates my tenancy .
Is that it , my dear ? '
You shall see the whole case clear , from first to last . "
You may thank me for restoring him to you .
" Now , <NAME> , " he said to me , " you wo n't be alarmed whatever comes off , I know .
They were , in truth , very rugged , noisy fellows , and quite brutal among themselves , though civil enough to their two passengers .
<NAME> dropped on one knee , and implored him , with a redundancy of gesticulation , to hear what had brought himself into such foul company .
" The dear little thing , " returned <NAME> , " holds dutifully to her father as long as he lasts ; but he wo n't last long .
After recovering twice or thrice , and as often relapsing , he wiped his eyes and said grace ; and a very cheerful meal their scanty supper was .
'The first question is , of what nature was her communication ? '
Having relieved her mind of these disclosures , she partook of shrimps and porter , and evinced a disposition to swear eternal friendship .
<NAME> <NAME> is the gentleman ' s name. ' ' I hope you have preserved the unities , sir ? ' said <NAME> .
' I entreat <NAME> to bear with me in entering into these details .
I hear nothing now , indeed .
I was with him when he was sick and well , rich and poor .
I have been carted out of <NAME> in the dead of night , and carried leagues away from it packed in straw .
He knew no better fields than those near <NAME> , and no better means of getting at them than by passing Mr <NAME> ' s house .
There 's no one here but the finest creature upon earth -- a child . "
" Did you ever see anybody very like the prisoner ? " Not so like ( the witness said ) as that he could be mistaken .
They were all silent for a long while .
You never run up and down stairs for me , all day long .
' " You did ? " said <NAME> , at last finding breath to speak .
' I shall be stronger than I was afore .
Therefore , he stayed to dinner .
I do n't know how it is exactly , but the law seems to put things up in price .
I don ' t say she has got it .
These various signs and tokens , marked by the little woman , are not lost upon her .
It might be more according to the rights of things , to say Two-thirds ; it might be more according to the rights of things , to say Three-fourths .
' The people are coming down the crescent now .
It happened to be the <NAME> ' s birthday , too .
' Ah , well ! ' he said , wiping his face .
I will not sit here , and hear such comparisons made. ' With that she stalked out , and made the door bang after her .
He ' d be afraid of you , and wouldn ' t talk .
She was calmed and comforted by the thought , and went to rest with a lighter heart .
And the broad stomacher heaves , and the quaint upright old-fashioned figure bends under its load of affectionate distress .
<NAME> himself was the chief impediment .
He 'll be here soon enough for us all . '
No one , however , had been there .
There was a fire in the tap-room , and some country-labourers were drinking before it .
<NAME> concluded , Mr <NAME> ' s horse was ordered out again , and Mr Carker mounting his own , they rode off for the <NAME> together .
' I an ' t a talker , ' replied the other .
His scrambling home , from week 's end to week 's end , is like one great washing-day -- only nothing 's washed ! "
I ' d go anywhere about the house the same as ever .
" Your own feeling tells you that you were not what you are , " she returned .
Mrs Tickit , though minutely circumstantial in her reply , had no settled opinion between five seconds and ten minutes .
However , there I have ' em , just the same .
You do n't forget how happily and peacefully my life is all marked out for me , and by whom ?
When she loved him , <NAME> , right well .
I have reflected that if I should wear out , he will be able to watch that judgment .
Are we to be exposed to this unnatural conduct every moment of our lives ?
She went through with me , she went through with the <NAME> , she went through with herself , she went through with everythink .
' Yes , ' says <NAME> , with sudden spirit , ' The politeness was my guardian ' s , not mine .
" I go there at other times , " said <NAME> , " but <NAME> does not come then .
" <NAME> ? " asked <NAME> , inquisitively raising her dark eyebrows .
He said gently , ' Tattycoram , come to me a moment , my good girl. ' She went up to the window .
She then got on her bonnet and went out , having been anxious to get out much sooner .
A man is hungry all day long .
' Nobody ' s at home at present , ' returned the child , with a glib assertion of her dignity , ' except the person of the house .
How -- or perhaps I should rather say where -- IS <NAME> ? ' ' Not here , ' Mrs <NAME> proclaimed , with folded arms .
The night crept on apace , the moon went down , the stars grew pale and dim , and morning , cold as they , slowly approached .
' If , ' said <NAME> , with solemn patience , ' I have not expressed myself with clearness , <NAME> , the fault of course is mine .
' Not a word , ' resumed <NAME> , ' and never will be .
To enlighten it with the lights of a stone passage , a flight of stairs , a brown window-curtain , and a black man .
Do not mind the rain .
The law-stationer 's establishment is , in <NAME> 's eyes , a temple of plenty and splendour .
It was not yet daylight ; for the candle was still burning , and it was quite dark outside .
" What have you been thinking about , my dear ? "
' I like your conversation much .
The procession up the aisle was beautiful .
What is your name ? ' A question more decidedly rushing at the secret he was keeping from her , could not have astounded him .
On the day when matters were concluded between <NAME> and <NAME> , we were all under engagement to dine at <NAME> 's house .
Boats were putting off , torches were lighting up , people were rushing tumultuously to the water ' s edge .
" If you please , " said <NAME> .
I know it , and have heard my father say so .
" A multitude of people , and yet a solitude ! " said <NAME> , when they had listened for a while .
Oh , for mercy ' s sake , tell uncle that I never loved him half so dear as now .
I think not at all , <NAME> , " he returned with an effort .
' He is shooting in <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
<NAME> for the <NAME> prisoner 's kindred in <NAME> Force !
His worship knew this perfectly well ; but it was a good annoyance , and a safe one .
said he after giving us a courteous greeting .
I brought it with me to send from these parts , as <NAME> might be a painful name just now to the person it 's written to .
By day , are there no Punches , <NAME> , Dancing-dogs , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , or even Barrel-organs ?
" Not that it affects you , though , I 'm sure , " said <NAME> , putting up the steps .
If he be ever asked how , why , when , or wherefore , he shuts up one eye and shakes his head .
' Just come in , <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> .
'And he 'd uncommonly like to see any man offer to do it , ' responded <NAME> , knocking his stick upon the floor .
said I when we had sat before the fire a little while .
" You are , of course , the person who has written me so many letters ? "
<NAME> <NAME> , after laughing cheerfully and clapping him on the shoulder , assists in these arrangements and helps to get the gallery into business order .
' Well , <NAME> , ' said the other -- ' Doctor <NAME> was of the same mind , I believed .
<NAME> and <NAME> has warped him out of himself and perverted me in his eyes .
<NAME> sighed , and shook his head despondingly .
' Was he not , <NAME> ? ' ' You know he was not. ' ' He was , ' cried the woman .
He has been for some time particularly desirous to serve his country in a post of good emoluments , unaccompanied by any trouble or responsibility .
Then , without a scrap of courage , but with a great deal of desperation , I went softly in and stood beside her , touching her with my finger .
And so _he_ goes up the postern stair .
<NAME> and <NAME> had often dealt in hides , but never in hearts .
Also , while he still grasped that feature , he directed several thoughtful looks down the street , after the retiring figure of Mr Boffin .
Therefore I take every opportunity of openly stating to a friend of <NAME> how <NAME> is situated .
' It is my duty to find out why she made that stipulation .
You are travelling for amusement and instruction .
' You are , sir , I perceive , a man of sense and talent , ' said <NAME> , almost breathless with the vehemence of his patriotic declaration .
The President will have a gentleman before him soon .
In another part of the building , there was a male patient in bed ; very much flushed and heated .
He may not have money , but he always has what is much better -- family , my dear . "
I can do it without <NAME> , of course , but this is the shortest way . "
Although I was treated in every other respect like the rest of the school , this single difference was made in my case from the first .
If you have nothing better to do than to walk up town with me , I shall be glad to introduce you to <NAME> ' s daughter. ' ' Mr .
'How do you do , sir ?
Who loosed it ? ' <NAME> , being on his road to the <NAME> , approaches it by way of <NAME> .
The name of <NAME> is the name of the age .
I ' ll write another to-morrow morning .
'Yes , ' said <NAME> , recoiling a few steps , as if to be nearer assistance in case she should require it .
The trooper shakes his head .
" Are there any more of you besides <NAME> ? "
Before what ? ' said <NAME> , putting her hand upon his arm .
At last he resolved to watch <NAME> and know more of her story .
<NAME> for her father was the first distinct emotion that made head against the flood of sorrow which overwhelmed her .
But the <NAME> had somehow come to the knowledge that <NAME> kept a school .
I know this in much the same way , I suppose .
When <NAME> asked him what he thought of the <NAME> , <NAME> said he had thought of that , too , and it was n't a bad idea .
I ca n't go into a long explanation before company ; but I could n't help it , upon my honour . '
The very feet of the dog were bloody .
A field-marshal has his uniform ; a bishop his silk apron ; a counsellor his silk gown ; a beadle his cocked hat .
So , the close of every week was a delicious time for me ; and I got through the rest of the week by looking forward to it .
Sounds of recognition and greeting pass between the <NAME> and somebody else , at the stair-foot .
' I ask one promise , ' said <NAME> .
' Not if it should happen to have been a tame bull , you little <NAME> ? ' said <NAME> .
Within a few more minutes he is reported as sending his respects , and could my Lady please to receive him for a word or two after her dinner ?
' He is only the representative of another ! ' cried <NAME> .
' We call Crummles that , because his style of acting is rather in the heavy and ponderous way , ' said <NAME> .
So off they set ; the plaintiff and defendant walking arm in arm , the officer in front , and eight stout coachmen bringing up the rear .
But I AM such a nasty little thing ! ' ' My dear ! ' urged <NAME> again .
That I 'll do , and render an account of course .
If he had been in <NAME> indeed , and the time had been sunset , and the scene a stately terrace !
There was no sleep for <NAME> on that night when <NAME> turned so easily in his bed ; there was no sleep for little Miss Peecher .
What you have said to me could have affected me so much from no other lips , for there are none that could give it such a value to me .
He then stirred the fire and left me .
' I augur all sort of good from your sensible decision. ' ' <NAME> , you do us a great deal of honour , ' he rejoined .
I told the gentleman at first , when he told me upstairs it was come to light , that I would answer for your being umble , and making amends .
Drop it altogether. " " Yes , Jerry. " " Yes , <NAME> , " repeated <NAME> sitting down to tea .
I spoke to him , and he spoke to me .
Finally he gave a faint single rap , and <NAME> -- such was the compromising name of the avenging boy -- announced " Mr .
He was standing close beside it , with one of his skeleton hands over his mouth , and the other resting on the <NAME> ' s table .
He returned no reply , but it was evident that he heard what was said , and that he thought about it , however confusedly .
" No , no , we will try to prevent that .
As he looked , she became blended with the child he had loved , and he could hardly separate the two .
" I believe it , my dear Charley .
'Not one , ' replied <NAME> , in a voice rendered husky by regret ; 'not one . '
You can put on the cards and in the advertisements , " Education by <NAME> and able assistants , " without having any assistants , can ' t you ?
How unfortnet do you want me fur to be ?
I hope _she_ is not mad ? ' ' Yes. ' ' On what subject ?
' Quite so , ' assented his partner .
<NAME> , you are a wag .
<NAME> do n't , father , " urged his son .
'We must make up for lost time when we 've got things into a good train .
The connection between the two places was by a hilly turnpike-road , and the travelling on that road was very slow .
'What do _you_ do here ? '
But how the graces and elegancies which she had dispersed about the poorly-furnished room went to the heart of <NAME> !
It was like her cordial voice in my ears .
' Does he deny that he did ?
He was going to say that you were not -- what ?
<NAME> to the Institution for the <NAME> in <NAME> ? ' ' I have seen it. ' ' Well !
' For why ? ' growled <NAME> , looking at his friend for the first time .
' But let me go on thinking the facts out , and avoid confusing them with my speculations .
' How can I feel otherwise than flattered by your notice in any way ? ' ' Oh !
I released her arms , and called the woman to assist me to compose her figure and the dress she had torn .
Sometimes my aunt and <NAME> were invited to do so , and accepted the invitation .
" Really , I think I could do a greater thing than that if the need were pressing .
I was at the coach office to take leave of her and see her go ; and there was he , returning to <NAME> by the same conveyance .
He followed , however , quickly ; and saw Mr Meagles going down the street with his enemy at his side .
" This foreign young woman has been my lodger for some weeks back . "
'Very true , ' said the undertaker ; 'they would indeed . '
" Of <NAME> , " says <NAME> , hitting him again .
They have wondered how I have suffered it .
If ever an old gentleman had made a point of appearing in public , shaved close and clean , that old gentleman was <NAME> .
' Yes , ' he said without emotion , ' it was <NAME> , he knew .
<NAME> Leicester generally refers back in his mind to <NAME> and arranges a sequence of events on a plan of his own .
When they were within two paces of each other , <NAME> 's <NAME> held up its hand , warning him to come no nearer .
There had been snow , some hours before ; and it lay , not deep , but hard-frozen on the ground .
' Have you any other apartments , ma ' am ? ' he asked .
You can understand what I read aloud ? ' ' Altogether .
But whatever you do , do n't you fall a-crying , my dear ; and do n't you worry yourself no more than you can help .
<NAME> and you 'll hear all the bells in the city jangling . "
As his lineaments soften with life , their faces and their hearts harden to him .
My life has been passed in this poor prison , and my teaching has been very defective ; but let me implore you to remember later and better days .
' I admire it greatly , sir , ' said <NAME> .
I have felt it dreadfully .
<NAME> <NAME> had received them with a familiar nod and a friendly look , but without any more particular greeting in the midst of his address .
" You may get cheated , robbed , and murdered in <NAME> .
He is such a ridiculous fellow ! "
" You are a good woman . "
It may be a cheerful language .
' Thank you , ' replied <NAME> ; ' I ' d rather not. ' ' What do _you _think , <NAME> ? ' inquired <NAME> .
He had been high with Mr Rugg , and had threatened to employ some one else .
' What is the matter ? ' ' I don ' t know .
We was living then in a solitary place , but among the beautifullest trees , and with the roses a-covering our <NAME> to the roof .
As my father 's came there .
' He ' s opposed to us ; he leads on the other side .
' <NAME> ; and that makes it the more vexatious , ' observed <NAME> , in the same pettish tone .
' <NAME> ' t I know that you were hanging about the house the other night , like a thief , eh ?
<NAME> brother to <NAME> ? " " Who 's he ? " said <NAME> .
Your sister will be in , in about a quarter of an hour .
' I am ready to walk with you. ' ' Thank you , Mr Headstone .
<NAME> <NAME> is already enough impressed by <NAME> , to feel indignant that <NAME> ( far below her ) should hold his prize so lightly .
General <NAME> will help us out . "
<NAME> felt a little vague trepidation as to the subject-matter of this same consultation , until Mrs <NAME> announced it .
She was particularly proud of her turn for business ; and she showed it now in reducing everything to pen and ink , and being moved by nothing .
' There ' s <NAME> , ' he said , with flashing eyes ; ' the woman has spirit , determination , purpose -- was she asleep , or petrified ?
He saw her pause irresolutely at the door and look towards him ; and he saw no more .
He made his way by sea to <NAME> , and back , after hearing the narrative to which <NAME> had assisted me .
' In the church , down yonder , ' said the <NAME> , pointing his thumb over his shoulder .
He hath a lamb from the fold ! ' cried the preacher , raising his voice still higher and pointing to the baby .
Do you not know what is due to guests ?
" Hah ! " said Mrs. <NAME> , restoring <NAME> to his station .
'Why , what does the boy mean ? '
But he invited <NAME> to dinner , and even brought him within range of the dangerous ( because expensive ) fascinations of <NAME> .
' <NAME> , ' said the watchful <NAME> , observing the effect which the praise of <NAME> had produced .
Meanwhile , <NAME> walked to and fro in his little back-office , troubled in mind by what had just occurred .
It is true that How not to do it was the great study and object of all public departments and professional politicians all round the <NAME> Office .
Be so good as chair that there member in this direction , will you ? "
I adore her in it !
<NAME> recognised the sally in his usual way , and took in his provender in his usual way .
If that dark-visaged eldest boy could look more malicious than he had already looked , this was the time when he did it .
said <NAME> , reflectively ; 'how queer ! '
It is a bare office , with bare windows , looking on the iron view below .
<NAME> lady ? ' ' Yes , ' I said , ' rather. ' ' Pretty stiff in the back ? ' said he , making himself upright .
The party that had overtaken them , and followed in their train , consisted of only three members : one lady and two gentlemen .
" <NAME> of <NAME> 's <NAME> .
Physicians ' prescriptions carefully prepared , " and all the rest of it .
The man obeyed , and <NAME> followed the light closely with his eyes .
Since no one here knows anything about him , it might be as well to send for <NAME> .
I can walk quite strongly .
' My life ! ' said <NAME> , taking her in his arms .
I ' ll slit his nose and ears , flog him , maim him for life .
" I am glad I think so , <NAME> .
But he saw nothing of this .
" Draw off a bit here , <NAME> , " says <NAME> as a kind of shabby palanquin is borne towards them , surrounded by a noisy crowd .
Who ? ' Clennam , replying in <NAME> , said the <NAME> lady ; he wished to see the <NAME> lady .
It is so very unusual to find you here at this hour .
Not in regular government pay and employment , to lay traps ?
From this spot , <NAME> wandered along all the galleries , up and down all the staircases , and once again round the whole area of the yard .
Is SHE working ? ' ' She is , ' says Veneering .
<NAME> given ; with the sarcastic addition ( from <NAME> ) of " Without slugs , Polly ! "
Patterns of carpets faded and became perplexed and faint , like the memory of those years ' trifling incidents .
I could not dress myself without help ; but I made up the fire , which was still burning , and got some coffee ready for them .
he ! ' ' Not many , I think , ' said <NAME> .
I ' ve heerd , in my dreams , of <NAME> ' s father and his uncle .
It was not I who cautioned you once never to found a hope or expectation on the family curse . "
Come in , ma ' am ! ' then said Mrs. Sparsit , reversing her former word of command .
' And when does the ship sail , <NAME> ? ' asked my aunt .
I have determined to remove this weight from my mind .
You mustn ' t show yourself to him , child .
' How do you find yourself arter it , my love ? ' ' <NAME> ! ' exclaimed Mrs. Weller .
That ' s all. ' With that , and ' Good night , ' the Secretary lowers the window , and disappears .
I am not changed towards you . "
" You are a vixen , a vixen ! "
' I have seen enough , ' said <NAME> , as he threw himself into a chair in his little apartment .
" Dear mother , are you so resolved ? "
There never was such a curious man .
It was a busy time , and I trotted about with him all day long , buying a variety of things of which he stood in need .
And <NAME> at the door , inquiring who is within .
he asks , good-humouredly making light of what he has done as she gets up and curtsys .
So dearly do I love the scene of my poverty and your kindness .
' You missed a friend , you know ; or you missed a foe , you know ; or you wouldn ' t have come here , you know .
you have brought your pigs to a very indifferent market , Arthur. ' If <NAME> had patience , <NAME> had not .
( I redeemed that promise afterwards , in characters larger than those in which apartments are usually announced in manuscript , as being to let . )
Let me go ! " " Ah ! " he returned , " I 'll let you go .
Will you come and see the gentleman , Mr .
Mrs Wickam shaking her head , and letting fall several tears , pointed out the little group to <NAME> , and turned her eyes up to the ceiling .
And so you shall , my darling -- when I tell you !
I was very angry with him indeed , for the first time in my life , but it only lasted a moment .
It is a part of <NAME> 's policy and mastery to have no political opinions ; indeed , <NAME> opinions .
' Oh ! ' said <NAME> , as soon as he recovered his suspended power of speech .
'Well , and good morning to _you_ , sir , ' replied Mrs. Mann , with many smiles ; 'and hoping you find yourself well , sir ! '
'There ough n't to be , if there is , ' replied <NAME> .
And your sister <NAME> has a fine brave spirit of another kind , a spirit of pure devotion , a beau-ti-ful spirit !
Surrounded by these influences , they walked on pleasantly enough .
When a boy , " <NAME> added with great solemnity .
There was not even a closet in it .
' <NAME> , I am sure ! ' ' I understand , ' said <NAME> , ' from my son <NAME> , that he has already improved that chance occasion .
He was writing at a table , with a great confusion of clothes , tin cases , books , boots , brushes , and portmanteaus strewn all about the floor .
' My pa -- <NAME> -- he ' s stopping here .
We shall be able to set you to rights in a very short time , I have no doubt , ma ' am .
Let me not be considered as wishing to detract from the merits of the former gentlemen .
' I excessively regret poor Gay , ' said <NAME> , ' and the crew .
He had been over the <NAME> in the course of the morning and whimsically described the family pictures as we walked .
" Now , I 'll put you in a corner , " forensically shaking a forefinger at him .
I endure without murmuring , because it is appointed that I shall so make reparation for my sins .
If I may ! ' ' Why , it ' s but a dull life that we lead here , boy , I am afraid , ' he said .
But I must impose one or two conditions on you , before you enter my house in that capacity .
I am going away again .
Being what it is , she neither knows nor cares . "
You have lived a gentleman ; you will die a gentleman .
But those were capital days , too , in <NAME> !
Look angry at me , <NAME> .
How -- ha -- how are they all , <NAME> ? ' ' Thank you , sir , They ' re all pretty well , sir .
And in any one of these his many cares , from first to last , <NAME> never flagged nor faltered .
<NAME> there no party of her own , in other times , on which the stars had shone ?
<NAME> <NAME> lingered , but the old gentleman drew her arm through his , and led her , with gentle force , away .
Pulling at the bell again and getting no reply , she pushed the outer door , and found it standing ajar .
In commercial phrase , coffins were looking up ; and , in the course of a few weeks , <NAME> acquired a great deal of experience .
God bless you ! ' and withdrew .
But there were worse troubles yet in store for him , and as they came on , his melancholy and sadness increased .
They ' ll be good shots one of these days .
' Where is my old pensioner all this while ?
She had nothing for it now , therefore , but to run after the chaise , and to call to Mr Abel to stop .
I could wish , however , to have seen it in a better light than it can ever be viewed in , where it stands .
I wish for your sake <NAME> was not a Sheep of the Prisons. " Sheep was a cant word of the time for a spy , under the gaolers .
What , you know him , do you ? "
It slowly grew to that .
The bride ' s father , our good friend there , is a noble person , and I am proud to know him ( great uproar ) .
<NAME> of us two can repeat most poetry ?
' Thank you , it ' s of no consequence , ' retorted Mr Toots .
' Leave her alone , everybody ! ' cried Mrs. Sparsit , with great energy .
Over and above this , <NAME> was very anxious " to learn housekeeping , " as she said .
<NAME> was truly repentant , and would not say another syllable .
<NAME> could make no reply , but looked his anxiety to be gone at once .
I went , with my wife , at about ten .
Nor hurt ? ' she asked him , anxiously .
But <NAME> had gone home after dressing her mistress , and the fat boy came back again more disturbed than before .
' What ' s a man made for ? ' ' For nothing else ? ' said <NAME> .
I do not quite know how to write what I wish to say next , but I trust you will understand it as I mean it .
'Oh , you have n't , have n't you ? '
" Well , and how are you ? "
The morning is by this time getting on apace .
<NAME> , ' said <NAME> , looking round him with increased caution , and speaking in a whisper .
Why are we now in the mansions of the rich and great , my friends ?
She laid her hand upon her breast , murmuring the sacred name that had been read to her ; and life passed from her face , like light removed .
And all 's fish that comes to my net .
I freely admit , I am a woman of business .
" I repeat this conversation exactly as it occurred .
I never thought he 'd a done it under a gold watch , chain , and seals , at the lowest .
'It 's a break-up of the system altogether .
' Friend of yours , sir ? ' ' Not exactly a friend , ' replied <NAME> , in a low tone .
Go along with you ! ' But the inflexible <NAME> , merely honouring <NAME> with another look , remained .
He would have followed her , but <NAME> , twisting his hand in his coat collar , dragged him towards the passage by which they had entered .
' I can ' t account for more than five , ' said <NAME> , with an air of perplexity .
She was quicker to perceive the slightest matter here , than in any other case -- but one .
At length he rises , throws open the door of a corner cupboard , and refers to a few uncouth chalked strokes on its inner side .
' The late <NAME> , gentlemen , was very fond of me , ' said <NAME> .
You are acquainted , perhaps , with the famous name of <NAME> ? ' ' The great Merdle ! ' exclaimed Mrs General .
' I have done no worse , I have not disgraced you .
My name 's <NAME> , as you are aware , and I have got a peace-warrant against <NAME> .
<NAME> anybody any idea ? ' ' Not roast man , I believe , ' replied the voice of the second gentleman of the party of three .
I couldn ' t very well get out of it , ' he explained , turning to the latter .
That 's a card not to be beaten .
' Therefore , my dear Doctor , ' said the <NAME> , giving him several affectionate taps , ' you may command me , at all times and seasons .
And indeed , I think we are all engaged , except the baby. " " Then you are ? " said I .
That 's all to be said at present .
<NAME> and time have taught me what to do .
It passed me , and went on to <NAME> .
Log of the <NAME> states , that a breeze springing up in the night , the wreck was seen no more .
What ' s your motive in this ? ' ' <NAME> take the man ! ' exclaimed my aunt .
' I see I take you with me !
<NAME> away. ' ' It is upon honour , sir ? ' the other still stipulated , with respectful firmness .
There was a third , <NAME> , who I fancied would sing it .
On the entrance of his friends , that gentleman laid down his knife and fork , and with a mournful air advanced to meet them .
<NAME> <NAME> being indeed fatigued , fell into a slumber , and waking in about half an hour , inquired what time it was .
After great difficulty and much puzzling , he contrived to read as follows : -- My dear young Man .
Lieutenant <NAME> turned round to his friend <NAME> , with a scarcely perceptible shrug of the shoulder , as if implying some doubt of the accuracy of his recollection .
A blazing sun upon a fierce August day was no greater rarity in southern <NAME> then , than at any other time , before or since .
<NAME> cleaned down with soft soap and soda .
He was seated on the ice , making spasmodic efforts to smile ; but anguish was depicted on every lineament of his countenance .
' <NAME> , help your master up to the box ; t ' other leg , <NAME> , that ' s it ; give us your hand , <NAME> .
' <NAME> , I think , sir , ' replied <NAME> .
' As thick , ' repeated Mr Rugg , ' as we could reasonably have expected .
" 'At last she is dead ? '
' What is the matter between us ? ' said <NAME> .
Even money could not buy them now ; everything must come out , and everybody must know all .
However , it has nothing to do with the present subject , excepting that <NAME> looked so like it at the moment that it came into my head . "
You will be good enough to observe , <NAME> , that no message to Mrs Dombey with which you are or may be charged , admits of reply .
You will be sure to hear when the jury come in .
' When I married , I found that my brother was even at that time heavily in debt .
' Halloa ! ' he cried , calling him roughly back .
No shame upon her brow ; no late repentance bending her disdainful neck .
" I do n't expect nothink at all , sir , much , but that 's the true hist'ry on it . "
But some people will die .
Why have they not been here ? '
" To me , women ! " cried madame his wife .
I am thrown away in society .
You shall see her tomorrow night .
I have a presentiment that he WILL mention it the first thing this morning . "
There was a pause , during which , <NAME> , who had covered her face with one hand , gave free vent to her tears .
Bother your people ! ' interposed <NAME> , with a toss of her head .
<NAME> after book was added to the heap of failures , <NAME> being firmly watchful of us all the time .
And you ain ' t gone , ain ' t you ?
' I remember very well , sir , ' rejoined <NAME> .
She was particularly delighted when <NAME> assured her that there were hospitals , and very kindly conducted hospitals , in <NAME> .
I ' ve brought little Wackford up , on purpose to show to parents and guardians .
He ' s never been heerd fur to complain .
I mourned for my child-wife , taken from her blooming world , so young .
It is represented that he is not in strong health , and has separated sadly from a friend who is under the displeasure of the <NAME> .
' By keeping silence upon the subject , my dear sir , ' returned brother Charles .
But there ' s no need to talk ; tomorrow will soon be here. ' ' And wha-at ' s to be done tomorrow ? ' inquired <NAME> .
'Good boy , <NAME> -- well done -- ' he mumbled .
' What say you , <NAME> ? ' <NAME> scratched his head and shook it , but said nothing at all .
' You could go away , and grow almost out of knowledge , and never come to tell your poor old friend how fortunate you were , proud lad !
" Your mind will be all the better for not running on one point too continually , and I 'll tell you for a change .
' The fence between this wharf and the next is easily climbed , ' said the dwarf , when he had taken these precautions .
Sit down , you dancing , prancing , shambling , scrambling poll-parrot !
' Old lady , ' said Mr Boffin , ' stop that noise !
' I ' ve found ' em out , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
' I was acquainted with all this , you know , ' said <NAME> , ' except the last clause , long ago .
This is a great advancement for her in life , Mr Rokesmith .
We must have <NAME> here .
At length there was a cry of silence , and a breathless look from all towards the door .
Yet <NAME> was in one of his sanguine states and in good spirits and was thoroughly pleased to see <NAME> again , whom he had always liked .
So he said , ' Florence , you may go and look at your pretty brother , if you like , I daresay .
said <NAME> , reflectively , 'if I 'd only got that young boy of <NAME> , the chimbley-sweeper 's !
Unfortunately , the property of <NAME> was settled upon herself .
Can you spare me a very few minutes ? ' ' Surely , surely , ' returned brother <NAME> , looking at him with an anxious countenance .
' It ' s like you did , <NAME> ' r <NAME> .
' So my friend being invited down to this marriage in <NAME> , ' with a pleasant sense of the readiness of this joke , ' goes .
I think <NAME> ' s means were straitened at about this time ; but it is little to the purpose .
' It is not worth my while , ' pursues <NAME> , becoming handsomely mollified , ' and it is the reverse of important to my position .
They know what a clever lad he is ; he 'll be a lifer .
His look was thoughtful , but had a benignant expression in it which I often ( how often ! )
My dear Trot ! ' cried my aunt , in a terrified whisper , and pressing my arm .
You call her Little Dorrit ? ' No road in that direction .
At least , <NAME> asked me if I did not , and I said yes .
The dark windows over yonder. ' ' I may go to <NAME> to-morrow ? ' asked <NAME> .
repeated the young lady , with great stress upon the word .
Then the child ' s head disappeared , and the prison-keeper ' s head disappeared , but the little voice prolonged the strain until the door clashed .
' <NAME> , ' said that eccentric functionary , ' furniter ' s cheap where you come from , <NAME> .
<NAME> , make room for one of these gentlemen on the box .
When he had been gone about a minute , the door reopened , and his hat and his head reappeared .
' I am not too proud to believe it , <NAME> .
<NAME> no more about the lists ?
<NAME> , whom I had seen at <NAME> 's on the same occasion , also turned up .
How long have they taken these lodgings for ? ' ' Only from week to week , ' replied <NAME> .
" Why , I hear of her , <NAME> , " replied <NAME> , " through <NAME> , but I see very little of her .
Overpowered with watching and exertion , I had closed my eyes for a few minutes , when I felt a violent clutch on my shoulder .
I have been very unhappy since she died .
' Now then ! ' cried <NAME> , poking his head out at the front-door .
What has been my history , that I should be at the pains of entreating either them or you not to have it so !
' My brother and I are just the same .
You know that at length I gave it up , and declined to guess any more .
' This is what your loving <NAME> calls the best time in the day and night , ' said the person of the house .
So it is with the one great cardinal virtue , which , properly nourished and exercised , leads to , if it does not necessarily include , all the others .
' We should all have been lost without <NAME> .
That ' s what you ' ll have to break to her .
It was the poor schoolmaster .
Let it stand for this day week , and you shall receive my printed address in the meantime .
" I think you had better call me guardian , my dear . "
The local influence of my family was quite unavailing to obtain any employment in that department , for a man of <NAME> ' s abilities .
Nothing but flight can save us .
I was to stay in the house , and was to be married from the house .
' That stone has worn away and been replaced by others , and many generations have come and gone since then .
It is natural , under these circumstances , that he , in his turn , should remember the friend to whom he is indebted for so promising an acquaintance .
The bottle-green suit had been brushed , ready for the morrow .
Who set this chap on , in this dress , when the carting began ?
Your mind will be more at peace , lying here , if you make Lizzie your wife .
This was his unvarying reply .
' But come , ' said <NAME> , as if suddenly recollecting himself ; ' we must not forget our mission in the pleasure of this interview .
When he was freshest and truest , he loved me .
There was a very dirty lady in his little room , and two wan girls , his daughters , with shock heads of hair .
That he had the bottle somewhere about him could not be doubted ; where , was not so clear .
Bail you to any amount , and only charge half a crown .
It brushes the <NAME> cobwebs away , and pleases the <NAME> .
' Perhaps , ' he returned , ' I have said enough .
' How can I care a pinch of snuff for <NAME> , when I think of that ' ere darling child ?
He pulled it off and showed 'em me .
<NAME> grass and rank weeds straggled over all the marshy land in the vicinity .
I am well , and your father has influence around me .
But he suffered Mr Casby to go out , without offering any further remark , and then took a peep at him over the little green window-blinds .
'In that way of business , ' rejoined <NAME> ; 'and so are the people of the house .
Has a scar on his right hand ; his thumb and forefinger being injured by being shot last fall .
I can stand any fire better than a fire of cross questions .
' But WERE you ever married , <NAME> ? ' says I .
They told her I was gone to seek her , and what my parting words was. ' ' Is that another letter in your hand ? ' said I .
' But I am made , ' said <NAME> to Mr Chick , ' of no more account than <NAME> !
This was all so pleasant that I hope it made me still more like the mountain than I had been before .
Considering myself sufficiently incongruous on my legal eminence , I have until now suppressed my domestic destiny .
Confining yourself rigidly to <NAME> , the question of Fact you state to yourself is : Does <NAME> ask me to marry him ?
The ole garden is open to you , and your airy pinions carry you through it .
' Yes , my lady lass , ' returned the <NAME> .
The chance to hush it is to let in these people now in a wrangle with your footmen .
I ha ' read i ' th ' papers that great folk ( fair faw ' em a ' !
" Is this your young attendant ? "
Exactly , ' said the old man .
He rode like a highwayman .
He threw himself back in his easy-chair , wrapped in contemplations of his future greatness .
<NAME> is the thief of time .
' Ay , ' said the <NAME> , reverentially ; ' it ' s a almighty element .
I know that from the beds of those who were past recovery , thanks have often , often gone up , in the last hour , for his patient ministration .
' Be careful how you go , my dear friend .
<NAME> <NAME> never removed his stern eye from the boy until he had deposited number four on the counter and was at a safe distance again .
I observe it , because I can ' t help observing it , being accustomed to take a powerful sight of notice ; but I don ' t object .
" My dearest <NAME> , " asked <NAME> , " why not ? "
' <NAME> mind. ' ' But I DO mind , ' said the <NAME> , laying her fan upon his lips .
' <NAME> ' t talk to me , you aggravating thing , don ' t ! ' said Mrs. Nupkins .
Mrs. Chadband is a stern , severe-looking , silent woman .
He made his face shine with the punch , so that it looked as if it had been varnished all over .
Evening had come on when I lifted up my eyes and saw my guardian standing in the little hall .
Through all his stages , <NAME> followed him with the same strange interest .
<NAME> ' t I , <NAME> , my dear ?
The daily visits I could make him were shortened now , and he was more strictly kept .
' I don ' t rightly know which is your brother , miss , ' replied <NAME> .
No more than that was ever said against her , <NAME> ? ' ' <NAME> , father , ' said Mrs. Joram .
I could have wished my noble friend had been alive to have seen my management of this case .
<NAME> gives a howl at the recollection .
I ' ll not ask you , with your remembrance of my house and all belonging to it , whether you believe it .
' I fear -- I hope it is not against the rules -- that she will bring the children. ' ' The children ? ' said the turnkey .
' No -- not much o ' that either ; you ' ve lost ten minutes here , and gone away as wise as you came , arter all .
Go on with your report. ' ' Am I pardoned ? ' he asked , with an air of half abashed gallantry .
<NAME> , a disappointed suitor , has been here to-day and has been alarming .
But that had nothing to do with it .
' Then they are not the Misers I mean .
I would not shame you by seeming to take them to heart , or treat them earnestly for an instant .
' No. ' ' Charming woman , <NAME> , ' said the Major , with a fat laugh rising in his short throat , and nearly suffocating him .
If she likes to make any little arrangement , afterwards , in the way of doing any little thing for us at home , very well .
A long room with three long rows of desks , and six of forms , and bristling all round with pegs for hats and slates .
' I ' m sure to bring him through it , ' said <NAME> .
The call being repeated , <NAME> looked out again , so cautiously that no part of the old man ' s body was visible .
It is a hundred to one if I should avail myself of it four times in a year .
At length , it was suggested that the letters were not initials , but the complete word , <NAME> .
She eyed him narrowly , while he spoke ; and cast upon him a look of intelligence which sufficiently showed that she guessed what had been passing in his thoughts .
said I , beginning to let down my hair .
But it is full of indignation to-night after undergoing the ordeal of consigning to the tomb the remains of a faithful , a zealous , a devoted adherent . "
Where I live , I mean. ' ' Indeed ! ' returned <NAME> quickly .
Let it be a secret between you and me ; and mind you tell me everything !
The morning of day and the morning of life are but too much alike. ' ' You speak truly , sir , ' said <NAME> .
<NAME> had kept his chair all night .
You know Snagsby the stationer ? "
' Yes , he is , <NAME> , ' replied the landlady .
He sat looking at the horse ' s ears , as if he saw something new there ; and sat so , for a considerable time .
'_I_ did that , sir , ' said a great lubberly fellow , stepping forward ; 'and preciously I cut my knuckle agin ' his mouth .
And how am I to set about it ?
But there ' s no harm in my trying. ' His breath fell like a flame of fire on <NAME> ' s ear , it was so hot .
When I had money enough , I used to get half-a-pint of ready-made coffee and a slice of bread and butter .
Her brother and sister is high in their views , and against Our <NAME> .
There is something melancholy in it , and I don ' t know why .
' No , sir , ' said Mr Venus , winking his weak eyes and shaking his head .
" Not even any one who had attended on him ? "
Dear Mr Clennam , I write to you from my own room at <NAME> , thinking you will be glad to hear from me .
For a man so expert in most things of that kind , <NAME> takes time to open the door and makes some noise too .
' It was as true , ' said <NAME> , ' as turnips is .
' Have some legal help. ' ' Perhaps I had better. ' ' Have Rugg. ' ' There is not much to do .
Similarly , he dealt us clean plates and knives and forks , for each course , and dropped those just disused into two baskets on the ground by his chair .
Because , why should I do anything else ?
I rather thought that everyone was struck by his not being proud , and taking notice of us .
Men talk of <NAME> as an abstract thing , and lose sight of what is natural while they do so .
<NAME> made his best bow , and stepped into the presence of a lady and gentleman seated at breakfast .
He told me once there should be a day of reckoning between us , sooner or later .
' I don ' t know why we unfortunate creatures should be supposed to want common sense , but it is generally taken for granted that we do .
' Have you the face to utter the word to me ? ' ' The face , too ! ' replied <NAME> , staring at him with cold scorn .
' And have a highly respectable reference for everything , have you ? ' <NAME> replied that she had , and laid her uncle ' s card upon the table .
I have had a pattern in my hand. " He glanced at the shoe with some little passing touch of pride .
" Have you no wish in reference to your case ? "
He shall not do it again , if I can help it ; I ' ll expose him !
' <NAME> must have gone down to the <NAME> , sir .
But it ' s a dear good world , and I love it ! ' ' It lies fair before you now , ' said <NAME> .
Anything else we can do for him , besides giving her up ?
Still I think it charming .
The old gentleman is newly shaken up by <NAME> to bear his part in the conversation .
'Why , I suppose if I was n't , I should n't be here , ' replied <NAME> .
<NAME> ill , sir ? ' Mr <NAME> had staggered up , with his lower jaw dropped , catching <NAME> by the shoulder , and pointing to the half-door .
'Not for the world , ' replied <NAME> .
' What do you think of the other ? ' said I .
The landlord slightly inclined his head .
This one was a sailor , with two anchors and a flag and G. F. T. on his arm .
" Not quite so far , I hope ? "
" I come from arriving at this so detestable house with your wife .
She partly drew aside the curtain of the long , low garret window and called our attention to a number of bird-cages hanging there , some containing several birds .
The daughters , who appeared to be very fond of him , were amused by this droll fact , particularly the <NAME> daughter .
Here were she , <NAME> , and her husband discoursing at once affectingly and effectively , but discoursing alone .
' You are so changed , ' said <NAME> -- ' I changed ! ' she interrupted .
' He is not hurt in the least. ' ' Don ' t let him come any nearer , ' said <NAME> , retiring as far as she could .
What I was thinking of was this .
I rose and joined <NAME> , who was by this time putting on her bonnet .
' I know another case , ' said the little old man , when his chuckles had in some degree subsided .
' Not at all , sir , ' replied <NAME> ; ' it was my fault .
We meet with it in a chin , and we say , " There it is !
On examination it was pronounced that she had received serious hurts , but that they of themselves were far from hopeless ; the danger lay mainly in the nervous shock .
repeats <NAME> , in his desperation clutching at the clump of hair at the back of his bald head .
<NAME> went through it all in his patient manner , and admired it all exceedingly .
' But there ' s some of his old friends not so patient as me .
'And if it is not ? '
<NAME> cats scamper across the road .
Having been hard at work in one dull enclosure all his life , he had a child ' s delight in looking at shops .
'Why , soldiers , why -- should we be melancholy , boys ? '
To this mind of the heart , if I may call it so , in <NAME> , some bright ray of the truth shot straight .
He left the messengers at the gate , and saw them admitted by the porter .
Mr Dombey , <NAME> Skewton. ' The lady in the chair was gracious .
But I held her tight all the while , and could have wept over her I do n't know how long .
' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
To Lizzie it was so new , so pretty , at once so womanly and so childish , that it won her completely .
When I cries out that night , " I know you now !
Some straggling carts and coaches rumbling by , first broke the charm , then others came , then others yet more active , then a crowd .
' None of it , ' answered <NAME> .
He goes downstairs , and <NAME> tries to compose himself before the fire for waiting a long time .
And beside him , white with rage or fear , or both , were the scowling features of the man who had accosted him in the inn-yard .
He arrived post-haste with the intelligence one evening , and had a long conference with my guardian .
What does he mean , <NAME> ? ' ' Live there , <NAME> , ' faltered <NAME> .
And of course he 's going .
' As to what was found in the dust now .
' You ' re a nice young gentleman ! ' said Mr Carker , shaking his head at him .
Reluctantly , I confessed myself quite unable to answer the question .
I dare say you would , <NAME> .
His coffee was produced , by the special activity of <NAME> , a full hour before he wanted it .
I had bought a spotted wooden horse over-night as a parting gift to little <NAME> -- that was the boy -- and a doll for little Emma .
Except the clock , there was not such an accurate and unimpeachable instrument in existence as the little thermometer which hung behind the door .
He lies , dressed , across a large unseemly bed , upon a bedstead that has indeed given way under the weight upon it .
' I can ' t help it , ' cried Mrs. Nickleby .
Little <NAME> was not ashamed of her poor shoes .
He has time before him , and the race to run .
So every true soul ever was , ever is , and ever will be .
' I want to see a ruddier touch here , <NAME> , ' he said , indicating his own healthy cheek by way of pattern .
Will you have the goodness to charge yourself with that commission , <NAME> ? ' ' Certainly ! ' rejoined <NAME> .
I was only too happy to be in such request .
' There is quite a bloom upon your demd countenance , ' said <NAME> , seating himself unbidden , and arranging his hair and whiskers .
Let me see thee , a ' so good , and so forgiving .
But <NAME> , looking up and smiling through her tears , cried , " Yes , I do !
I took a sudden resolution .
Consequently she made out nothing , and Mr Dombey in his den remained a very shade .
If the matter had only been properly taken up at first , as I wished it to be !
" Sir , " returned <NAME> , " as I believe I have already mentioned , it is next door .
He was then attacked by scarlet fever ; in four weeks became deaf ; in a few weeks more , blind ; in six months , dumb .
" Your ladyship , " replies <NAME> , again referring to his paper , " I am coming to that .
' Have you seen <NAME> , my dear , ' he said , ' since she left your house ? ' ' No , sir ! ' replied <NAME> .
I may drop into the <NAME> , and clear off that way .
He , anything but a guide , a support , and a friend to me !
However , he took affairs as coolly as it was in human nature to do , and entertained himself with the facetious idea of the training more than once .
'They have n't no more philosophy nor political economy about 'em than that , ' said the beadle , snapping his fingers contemptuously .
Better to begin slowly. " Thus , <NAME> , in a stern voice , to <NAME> , as they began ascending the stairs .
I address myself to that Doctor. " Then she raised her voice and called out , " Citizen Doctor !
' We call it a Hall up in <NAME> , because it sounds better , but they don ' t know it by that name in these parts .
<NAME> ' s gentleman , not knowing how the matter really stands , is afraid to pursue the subject .
' I am going , ma ' am , ' said <NAME> , ' to marry <NAME> ' s daughter. ' ' Yes , sir , ' returned Mrs. Sparsit .
' And imposition , ' added <NAME> , laughing ; ' we won ' t leave out the imposition .
' I never will believe it , sir , ' replied the old lady , firmly .
' I despise 'em , ' said the beadle , growing very red in the face .
<NAME> ' s place was at the bottom of the school , at the opposite end of the long room .
I will not say a word more .
" This , " said she , pointing to the long table with her stick , " is where I will be laid when I am dead .
' Well , godmother , ' said <NAME> , as they remained upon the steps together , looking at one another .
" _I_ go through no streets and past no fountains .
For the rest , uncertainty and danger seemed written upon everything .
Their way lies through strange places .
Of course he might come in. ' And so he did .
<NAME> , he believed that <NAME> had no particular pair of shoes .
It ' s not a celebrated name .
' Rokesmith. ' ' No , it ain ' t ! ' cried <NAME> , clapping her hands , and shaking her head .
I had no difficulty in deducing from your unreserved conversation , and the rumour openly going about among your admirers , the nature of your calling .
Mr Toots tells <NAME> when he comes at night , that he hasn ' t been so wretched all day long , and yet he likes it .
People couldn ' t ask one to wedding breakfasts .
Then you see , " said <NAME> , shaking his head , " I am hopeless of understanding it . "
But what 's the matter , <NAME> ? "
They entered the house , the crowd opening right and left to let them pass , and cheering vociferously .
She lives with me at my table here . "
'Not bad , any way , ' replied <NAME> with a smile .
' Coming down the yard now , <NAME> , ' replied the hostler .
' In what respect ? ' asked <NAME> .
'This is far enough , ' said a voice , which was evidently that of the gentleman .
' Dear me , sir ! ' said <NAME> , surveying me with his head on one side .
At least I had nothing in my mind that I could say .
'No , I know you 're not .
No , nor in the hall , which was so bare that he could see that , at a glance .
He is the best judge of his own responsibility ; he acts upon his responsibility .
Thank you , sir , thank you .
If great criminals told the truth -- which , being great criminals , they do not -- they would very rarely tell of their struggles against the crime .
' Thank you , ma ' am , ' said <NAME> , knuckling his forehead again , in return for the favour of Mrs. Sparsit ' s improving conversation .
Are they -- are they near here ? ' ' A long way from here , ' returned the gentleman , shaking his head .
What , are you here , <NAME> ?
Still , at the same time , I wouldn ' t commit such an injustice for the world .
" <NAME> , there is my husband ! " she cried , pointing him out .
I had alighted from <NAME> 's back on the brink of the ditch when we came up , and had not moved since .
" My dear boy , " said <NAME> , " I am harder with myself when I do anything that gives you pain .
The visitor offered his hand .
' Let me get at him , <NAME> , ' cried <NAME> , as he rushed at the ill- starred youth .
When they had got through such studies as they had in hand , they stood leaning on the window-sill , and looking down upon the patch of garden .
said the people , turning to look after her as she rushed away .
What was the end of it ?
The <NAME> touched him on the arm , and pointed to his younger self , intent upon his reading .
My aunt was as happy as I was , in the arrangement made for me ; and we went down to the drawing-room again , well pleased and gratified .
' There was something behind the door , <NAME> , which perwented our getting it open , for ever so long , <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> .
" <NAME> ? " " Something that crossed me ? " " I am conscious of nothing ; there can be nothing here .
A desolate air of utter and complete loneliness fell upon him , like a visible shade .
If my daughter flies in my face , surely my husband may .
They had no doubt that <NAME> would " do something " for me ; their doubts related to the form that something would take .
I gave them an undertaking on which they sent down your discharge ; it ' s very awkward , my dear <NAME> ; what will you do ?
Containing the whole Science of Government 11 .
The <NAME> were a very high family , and a very large family .
Volumes could not have said more .
But I should feel it much more , if I didn ' t know it to be a tie between me and father. -- <NAME> !
The <NAME> stopped at a certain warehouse door , and asked <NAME> if he knew it .
For nearly a whole week , the <NAME> , & c. , is in course of removal .
' I ' m a intimate friend of his and his Uncle ' s .
'Will you disclose the whole ? '
" He would n't keep out of <NAME> , and I suppose he 's over head and ears in debt .
<NAME> home directly , you cruel boy !
He had taken it up , and was stooping to work again , when his eyes caught the skirt of her dress .
" I 'm very glad to hear it . "
<NAME> ' t give it to him .
' Did you ever see a ghost ? ' was the sullen retort .
I know what that is .
Is the moment come ? " " Yes. " She kisses his lips ; he kisses hers ; they solemnly bless each other .
Will you come and see her ? " The answers to this question were various and contradictory .
' What can we do , Trotwood ? ' said <NAME> .
The whole place seemed restless and troubled ; and the people were crowding and flitting to and fro , like the shadows in an uneasy dream .
She flies in a passion , and breaks his pipe ; he steps out , and gets another .
When he had achieved this rush of vivacity and condescension , his <NAME> composed himself into the picture after <NAME> , and made a third cow in the group .
Ve-ry strong influence , is it not ?
Dear me , that 's not a common name , <NAME> , is it ?
It never is , to obstinate and sullen natures ; for they struggle hard to be such .
By Heaven I will , if I hang on to the foot-board. ' ' You shall be horsewhipped if you do , ' returned <NAME> .
Then you ' ll memorialise that Department ( according to regular forms which you ' ll find out ) for leave to memorialise this Department .
Nevertheless , it was not easy , with the face of his beloved wife fresh before him , to compose his mind to what it must bear .
<NAME> Leicester sits like a statue , gazing at the cruel finger that is probing the life-blood of his heart .
I am afraid I was in a tremulous state for a minute or so , though I did my best to disguise it .
' And that is just what I mean ; that is just how it was with us , ' said <NAME> .
' Very sad , is it not ? ' returned <NAME> .
But , he had never seen his friend in his present aspect : he had never at all known him in his present character .
Let him remember it in that room , years to come .
All day , I have had him near me. ' ' What can I do ? ' cried <NAME> , shuddering at these words .
<NAME> ! ' at intervals all day , and ' Lock ho !
It is not so unlike the Court of Chancery but that we may pass from the one scene to the other , as the crow flies .
Until then , good-bye. ' As <NAME> said this , he got into the coach which had by this time arrived , followed by the tipstaff .
Often after dark , one other figure walked alone before the <NAME> ' s house .
' Them things as is always a-goin ' up and down , in the city. ' ' Omnibuses ? ' suggested <NAME> .
You 've hit the right nail upon the head , and are as safe here as you could be .
But she seemed to be a good sort of fellow , and showed a high regard for the <NAME> .
' However , ' said <NAME> , appearing to pluck up his spirits , ' we ' ll hope it ' s not so bad as that comes to .
' It ' s a stupid name , ' she said , shaking her curls for a moment .
I didn ' t call too loud .
I felt very ignorant , but what could I do ?
There 's no time to lose . '
' This is not all of ' em , even as we already know ' em , ' said <NAME> , with many nods of hidden meaning .
I ' m a going to seek my niece through the wureld .
" They would n't have nothink to say to me if I wos to go to a nice innocent place fur to live .
I was regularly turned on my back when I found him taken up by your establishment , I do assure you . "
What did he earn by it ?
I do <NAME> forget , though I do not read it as he did .
Let us say no more upon the subject ; it ' s a very painful one to me .
'And his master , too , I think you said , <NAME> ? '
Welcome to this stricken breast ! ' She felt the words , although she could not utter them , and held him in her pure embrace .
Around and around the house the leaves fall thick , but never fast , for they come circling down with a dead lightness that is sombre and slow .
' " You a miserable man ! " said the goblin , in a tone of excessive contempt .
Happily for me , I am so much engaged that I have no time to think about it .
What is the meaning of it , <NAME> ? ' added <NAME> , in a threatening , and a louder tone .
" Have you many pupils , Mr .
As we were going along , she asked me what he had said ; and I told her he had said it was all right .
' Come here , you sir , ' said the dwarf .
What have paupers to do with soul or spirit ?
She said she had a headache ; headaches don ' t occasion red eyes .
' Emily , my girl , ' said <NAME> reproachfully , ' I detest meanness and deceit ; this is unjustifiable and indelicate in the highest degree .
He thinks he has awakened his friend .
The probability of his ever doing so , appeared to me , when I saw him , to be very small .
<NAME> would bark and caper round us , and go on before , and look back on the landing , breathing short , to see that we were coming .
As <NAME> appears , <NAME> hastens towards her , to bid her farewell .
Had I given <NAME> no reason to doubt my constancy , and to think that in prosperity I should grow cold to him and cast him off ?
said <NAME> , with a sigh .
<NAME> Leicester receives the gout as a troublesome demon , but still a demon of the patrician order .
The little spot made them the more beautiful .
All the love and duty I could ever have rendered to him is transferred to you . "
Then came the tea and coffee ; and then , the ball .
" Do n't recall her to herself , " he said , softly , to the latter , " she is better so .
His hat was off , before he opened the door ; his comforter too .
' Hi ! ' cried the woman , raising a cracked voice .
' Nobody would , nobody could , you know .
<NAME> <NAME> , breaking off , has made a noiseless descent upon mademoiselle and laid his heavy hand upon her shoulder .
She simpered a little , affected extreme vexation and hesitation , and at last arrived at the conclusion that she supposed she must go .
But he kept up , nevertheless , and , with his head drooping languidly on his breast , went stumbling onward , he knew not whither .
' <NAME> Mr Gills to come here. ' Mr Perch was too deferential to express surprise or recognition of the figure in the corner : and <NAME> appeared immediately .
It ' s one or the other. ' ' Don ' t distress yourself by worrying your mind about it , ' he returned , with infinite forbearance .
" Do n't you be afraid of that .
'The boy next , ' said <NAME> .
I observed that the latter always spoke of himself indefinitely , as ' a man ' , and seldom or never in the first person singular .
I am always wrong when you are in question .
' A very good fellow indeed ! ' returned <NAME> .
The house stands , large and weather-proof , in the long dull street ; but it is a ruin , and the rats fly from it .
The shop was close and hot .
I have done what I thowt should be done , but I never looked fur any good to come of my stan ' ning where I do .
When we repeated , with some surprise , " The sheep ? "
The world did have it that she showed a passion for attending my sales , when they took place on half holidays , or in vacation time .
After <NAME> was restored , we still had to break it to the other eight ; and it produced various effects upon them of a most pathetic nature .
And with that , he darted in again with one jerk and clapped the little door to , like a figure in a <NAME> clock when the hour strikes .
<NAME> was a capital way of raising his spirits , and putting him quite at his ease .
Beholding him in the trim described at the conclusion of the last chapter , he stood aghast in wonder and consternation .
<NAME> strike you dead on the spot , if ever you split in any way sumever !
' It isn ' t funny at all , ' repeated <NAME> .
' Is there anything else you wish to say to me , dear father ? ' ' No , no .
Perhaps you would n't mind <NAME> 's coming in , <NAME> ? "
" <NAME> is _not _wholesome , <NAME> , " says the doctor , wery fierce .
When he reached home Mrs. Maylie was sitting in the little parlour .
I could not wonder at any one loving her .
' Anybody else , <NAME> ? ' he said , without looking up , and turning over the leaves .
She was busily engaged in the little offices of the table .
All I mean goes beyond words , as I hope you understand and believe .
You had better call us thieves , <NAME> ; or perhaps You would like to assault one of _us_ .
The newspaper-reading turnkey has told them all .
I should not have the courage to mention this to any one but you .
And wot other man can say the same , <NAME> ? ' ' Vell , there ' s somethin ' in that , ' said <NAME> .
Before I leave this place , <NAME> shall hear me . '
A certain idle carelessness and recklessness of consistency soon comes of it .
They and the accounts were all found correct , and the books and the papers resumed their places in the bag .
In that intent <NAME> will persevere , as his duty is .
Of courthe you do ; I needn ' t athk .
It is for his good .
<NAME> enough to be hith mother .
I fully expected to find a Constable in the kitchen , waiting to take me up .
She looked from him to <NAME> , and her features softened .
She stops him as he is moving out of the room by asking , " This is the notice I was to receive ?
I was told by your guardian that you discontinued it under the shock that we have all felt so acutely .
' And warn ' t there no honest man to pick it up ?
' When will <NAME> be back , sir ? ' inquired <NAME> .
They see my <NAME> 's face .
All this time , <NAME> never raised her eyes , unless to glance towards her mother when that lady ' s fervent spirit shone forth in words .
' But nature will smile though priests may frown , and next day the sun shone brightly , and on the next , and the next again .
It will be of no use your rubbing yourselves ; you won ' t rub the marks out that I shall give you .

If you want information regarding your uncle Provis , you had much better come and tell no one , and lose no time .
But if she knew I was ill , she must have pitied me , even there ; for she was very ill herself before she died .
From this employment she suddenly desisted , and said to <NAME> , much to my confusion : ' Who ' s your friend ? ' ' Mr .
He flies on these occasions like an angel or a bird .
' Impossible to imagine , ' said <NAME> .
If you haven ' t got the one thing , why have you got the other ?
It would be best to hide this coin , and never produce it unless their case was absolutely desperate , and no other resource was left them .
If he be seeking his own star as he methodically turns and turns upon the leads , it should be but a pale one to be so rustily represented below .
" To bless and receive me , " groaned my mother , " it is far too late .
' Of all the men I know , you are the best adapted , by nature and by position , for society .
<NAME> and he did not see this poor life of his from the same point of view .
Said <NAME> convulsively wrestles with one of his many Gods or <NAME> , perhaps , and snarls horribly .
But he had a bold spirit , and he ran a little wild and went for a soldier .
He never knocked like that .
But , yes , I know I may .
' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , in a monotonous forced way , ' is active in the business , <NAME> .
And I have got it ! "
I came down of my own accord .
Yes , <NAME> , ' says you , " here <NAME> shook his head and hand at me , " 'he knows my total deficiency of common human gratitoode .
But the old gentleman was not the only person who raised the hue-and-cry .
I must beg you to take this back , <NAME> Weller. ' Wery well , ' said <NAME> , with a discontented look .
' Not as you are carrying it , ' said <NAME> .
<NAME> should have induced ME to touch it ! )
I doubt whether two young birds could have known less about keeping house , than I and my pretty <NAME> did .
Here ' s <NAME> ! ' said <NAME> .
The rippling of the river seemed to cause a correspondent stir in his uneasy reflections .
In town or country , wet or dry , hot or cold , <NAME> suffers .
HE was not altered , but he was surprised to see how altered I was and appeared quite pleased .
In face , watchful behind a blind ; habitually not uncensorious and contemptuous perhaps .
He was a little bright creature with a rather large head , but a delicate face and a sweet voice , and there was a perfect charm in him .
A fourth is building , and will soon be opened .
What you have overcome in yourself , can you not overcome in him ?
<NAME> <NAME> was of her opinion .
what dreadful pain it is !
I have seen two of them safely out of bed .
I mean , Mrs. Bagnet , there he was , dying without ever having been taught much more than to know his right hand from his left .
' There are shades in all good pictures , but there are lights too , if we choose to contemplate them , ' said the gentleman with the merry face .
It is just half a year since I first saw this delicate morsel , and , oh dear , what a delicate morsel it is !
It was nothing that the decree bore date since his return to <NAME> .
We found my aunt alone , in a state of some excitement .
I shall transact the business : you will transact the pleasure .
I might only weaken what is ill enough said as it is .
Not for her life , not for her life !
<NAME> has eaten no dinner , but has twice or thrice poured out water with a steady hand and drunk it .
' Fine doings in a person ' s own house ! ' ' Mrs .
Upon my word I am , though I wasn ' t acquainted with the party .
Though there <NAME> unintentionally threw him out by faltering , ' Oh , is it indeed ?
' <NAME> is with his sister now ! ' It was the conception of an inspired moment , and she shot off with her utmost swiftness to work it out .
In the interest of seeing her , ever drawing , with no hand to stay her , nearer and nearer to the bottom of this new <NAME> ' s Staircase .
' You have had no former cause of complaint on the sentimental score , <NAME> , and you will have none in future .
As he did so , hat in hand , <NAME> whispered : ' He killed the dog. ' ' <NAME> know it ? ' Little <NAME> whispered .
That my own artless <NAME> is changed to me !
These measures , advisable to be taken in any case , <NAME> took in the hope of his coming to himself .
' I screamed rather than talked , for I felt tumultuous passions eddying through my veins , and the old spirits whispering and taunting me to tear his heart out .
' You think this thumped head of mine is excited ? ' <NAME> went on , with a high look ; ' not so , believe me .
It wanted but a very slight circumstance to kindle his wrath against <NAME> .
what was that , which sent the blood tingling to his heart , and deprived him of his voice , and of power to move !
" 'Presents her compliments to Mr .
'No , not at all , ' rejoined <NAME> .
I meant that , I am sure , as much as I still mean it .
What did you do then ?
' You ' re wery right , old friend , ' said <NAME> ; ' I _do_ mean arternoon .
" If it is not being troublesome , " said we .
Of whom ? ' ' Of any one you have lately seen and made angry. ' He snapped his fingers and laughed .
' Oh , you prodigal old son !
" Yet , <NAME> , " said I , looking round , " I miss something , surely , that I am accustomed to ? "
To think that I should see him at last , and you should be able to know that I have told you the truth ! '
<NAME> , do go away , for I am afraid of you .
that has it , ' replied <NAME> , ' and ready iced too .
<NAME> , what will it be ? "
' Upon my soul and body ! ' said Mr Toots , taking his seat beside her .
Little <NAME> , with a piercing cry , held her back .
He stared at her with a fearful look , and after a while his lips began to form some words , though no sound proceeded from them .
Could it be , she asked herself with starting tears , that her own dear mother had been made unhappy by such treatment , and had pined away and died ?
' I ' m sure I heard you say as much , my dear , ' retorted <NAME> in his cold sarcastic manner .
I beg and pray that I may stay with you !
The strange gentleman beckoned him out of his place , and <NAME> went .
After holding her to his breast with a passionate cry , he took up his bundle and darted out at the door , with an arm across his eyes .
And my child is a troublesome bad child , and costs me a world of scolding .
It would have been better , under any circumstances , to have gone on !
' Have you no feeling , that you keep her out in the cruel streets at such a time as this ?
" I have never borne to look upon them since , and now I blame myself for my weakness .
The <NAME> stopped beside one little knot of business men .
Do I care for this girl , except as your friend ?
I think she gave it him .
Get up , and sit in your chair .
Again and again he listened for the sound of wheels behind .
There is the desolation of my heart and my soul .
' My love , ' said <NAME> , ' you professed yourself very fond of <NAME> Fitz-Marshall .
In her furred travelling-dress , <NAME> seemed more delicately beautiful than she had ever seemed yet , even in my eyes .
" What ' s your motive ? " ' ' Exactly. ' ' Motive , ' said <NAME> , ' good .
I examined the place , and the body , and the papers , and everything .
<NAME> , eh ? ' <NAME> took out his pocketbook and made a note of it .
' And why not ? ' retorted <NAME> .
' What will you take to go out ? ' I beg your pardon , ' replied <NAME> .
She steeped a piece of linen in a basin , into which she poured some liquid from a bottle , and laid it with a gentle hand upon the sore .
' What should you say this was ? ' demanded Mr Swiveller .
We were very gay and sociable , and I asked him , in the course of conversation , what he was ?
I don ' t appear in the business , neither do you .
But I should say their cook at the <NAME> wanted a little looking after .
And I observed , with great surprise , that he devoted it to staring in my direction as if he were lost in amazement .
They know what a clever madman I have been , and they are proud to have me here , to show .
At length that low roar of many voices ran through the crowd which usually announces the arrival of whatever they have been waiting for .
I felt that no one -- mother , sister , wife -- could honour him more than I. I did , indeed !
Ladies who have a passion for attending lectures are to be found among all classes and all conditions .
After a little hesitation he opened the window , and demanded who it was .
She had no time to lose , but must get ready at once .
" This is a sorrowful case , " said my guardian after asking him a question or two and touching him and examining his eyes .
This person , " the other bearer , " we engaged in the street outside for a pint of beer .
'Am I to go with you ? '
" How long have you known it ? "
" Never mind what I make it , my friend , " observed <NAME> , with a knowing and contradictory toss of his head .
<NAME> thinks half so bad of me as my own father does .
The boy sprung up , stroked his face with his hand , and threw his wasted arms round his neck , crying out that he was his dear kind friend .
Not within my hearing , that is to say . "
After which the six-footer comes into action and is much admired .
She clung round my neck , calling me by every dear name she could think of and saying what should she do without me !
But he had his reward .
' <NAME> ' t tell me you did .
' All night long , ' pursued the other , hurriedly , ' I had dreams of him -- and yet I didn ' t sleep -- in his blood .
She bent over him softly , kissed him , and came to the table .
You a hold upon me !
' -- To be crammed , sir , ' repeated <NAME> .
'Ca n't I be supposed to feel -- _I_ as brought him up porochially -- when I see him a-setting here among ladies and gentlemen of the very affablest description !
<NAME> , who had been asleep too , staggered up at the noise I made , and in an instant I saw his jackknife shining in his hand .
I didn ' t mean any harm indeed , upon my word I didn ' t , ' cried the small servant , struggling like a much larger one .
But he was very penitent indeed , and in a peculiar way -- not in the lump , but by instalments .
Outer doors of chambers are shut up by the score , messages and parcels are to be left at the <NAME> 's Lodge by the bushel .
Still , " returned the gentleman , " I wish I could say they were not . "
Falling asleep , and leaving great blocks of building materials dangling in the air ; waking again , to resume work and get them into their places .
But he is denounced -- and gravely -- by the <NAME> and <NAME> .
It is accomplished at last , and he proceeds alone in quest of his adviser .
And what ' s this with a clarionet ?
' Will she call me " <NAME> " ? ' cried <NAME> .
" And now undo my bundle , <NAME> , " said the first woman .
' Not if your wish is gratified , ' replied <NAME> .
' <NAME> ' s to the brim too .
Mr <NAME> was well to do , and stood very high in Mr Podsnap ' s opinion .
You have been in every line I have ever read since I first came here , the rough common boy whose poor heart you wounded even then .
' I ask you again , ' thundered the doctor , 'are you , on your solemn oaths , able to identify that boy ? '
' Yes , I did , Sir. ' ' What do you think of it , <NAME> ? ' ' Think of it , <NAME> ? ' ' Yes .
Otherwise the staid old house was , as to its cleanliness and order , still just as it had been when I first saw it .
' Remember my words , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' and be thankful that <NAME> is not too fond of you .
After a short absence ( during which he could be heard to speak in a softened soothing tone ) he returned , bearing in his hand a lamp .
'You will see them directly , and they will be overjoyed to find you safe and well . '
thinks the trooper as he follows .
' He was only called the other day .
Does he see a ghost , or hear an organ ?
' Are you going home ? ' he said .
Gradually , he fell into that deep tranquil sleep which ease from recent suffering alone imparts ; that calm and peaceful rest which it is pain to wake from .
That 's very pleasant , you know !
But I want to keep you in attendance .
It was all the same to him .
' A pet name , sir , ' he explained again .
But try over and over again , nevertheless .
Transportation or the gallows for anybody who shall touch the property ! "
<NAME> and red-eyed , his hopes plainly had deserted him , his sanguine mood was gone , and all his worst misgivings had come back .
' If I felt less , I could do more .
" This has been without prejudice ? "
cried the new comer , breathless with haste .
' I want to speak to you , who spoke to me this morning , ' said <NAME> , pointing out with his finger the man whom he addressed .
<NAME> must be careful. ' ' How do you mean ? ' inquired <NAME> .
At length , the <NAME> clock chiming one quarter , with a rapid turn he hurries in .
The fact is , he had been originally jobbed out by the day , and he never quite got over his old habits .
But now he was ill at ease about her .
<NAME> <NAME> has received him there these several evenings past to know whether he has anything to report .
I opened my eyes in the night , and I saw , in the great chair at the bedside , <NAME> .
As she neared it , she turned , and withdrew her eyes from my face .
-- do n't be ashamed still to confide in me , for there will be nothing monstrous or uncommon in it .
" What ' s that ? " he said to me .
I canna be expecten to ' t .
It is in <NAME> , but not of it .
He has a most romantic heart , Mrs. Nickleby , as indeed -- hem -- as indeed all our family have , and the disappointment was a dreadful blow .
" Yes , yes , " says the good old gentleman , reverting to his lesson of wisdom .
What IS the move , <NAME> ? ' ' Are you almost ready for breakfast , <NAME> ? ' ' You can pour it out .
There ! ' Here <NAME> burst into tears .
We expressed our acknowledgments and sat down behind the door , where there was a lame invalid of a sofa .
The man against the child , for a bag of gold ! '
replied the voice of the <NAME> , through the key-hole .
Sometimes I hope , my dear , and sometimes I -- do n't quite despair , but nearly .
<NAME> go on to something else besides our having no nonsense about us. ' ' Yes , my love , ' said Mr Sparkler .
' If you ' re afraid of the fox , ' said <NAME> , ' you may dismiss all present expectations of seeing that animal .
Almost as dull as the infernal old jail .
All the better for her !
Besides , <NAME> , I 'm here , because I 've meant it by you , years and years .
' And what about the cash , my existence ' s jewel ? ' said <NAME> , when these endearments ceased .
I would n't go free , now , if you was to fall down on your knees and ask me .
He will write to her every alternate day , and tell her all his adventures .
' We meet and part to-night , ' she said .
It is a great privilege .
<NAME> suspicion may exist without that connexion . "
At that moment , <NAME> ( of course , the woman with the apron ) dropped the candlestick she held , and cried out , ' There !
' Who is that ? ' ' Only me , sir , ' replied the voice .
Then , I got up and partly dressed , and sat at the window to take a last look out , and in taking it fell asleep .
And here it may be observed , that <NAME> was not , in the ordinary sense of the word , a young man of high spirit .
My convict never looked at me , except that once .
<NAME> , love , I am telling <NAME> that he never saw you abroad. ' ' No such luck , sir , ' said <NAME> .
' You have delivered the little parcel I gave you for your old landlord , <NAME> ? ' ' I have , <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> .
Taking the furniture with them , of course ?
My fellow-citizen here would have it forty-two ; ten more heads are worth having .
I ' m not indeed , ' said <NAME> .
' No , thank you , ' said Mr Merdle , ' I don ' t feel inclined for it .
All his widowed mother could spare had been spent in qualifying him for his profession .
I shall accompany you. ' ' You ! ' said <NAME> .
' And how do YOU like the law ? ' ' A -- not particularly , ' returned <NAME> .
But you have given me such a specimen of both , that I should be a fit subject for both if I remained silent respecting them .
Chokings and nervous jerkings , however , are nothing new to me when I think with anxiety of those I love .
" So you kept him after all ? "
<NAME> , if you wish to be carried downstairs -- " " In a moment , my dear friend , in a moment .
The new flower sprang from the deep-planted and long-cherished root , she knew .
Suppose my conscience -- ' ' And we know what a conscience it is , my soul .
I had not meant that , and was rather taken by surprise .
Seven-and-sixpence to me , old Isaac .
<NAME> person singular , I do not care ; second person singular , thou dost not care ; third person singular , she does not care , ' returned <NAME> .
<NAME> , <NAME> , aw a muddle !
As I serve my gun that day , I resolve , when the place shall fall , to examine that cell .
Apart from the realities of this most picturesque city , there are associations clustering about it which would make a desert rich in interest .
I saw her , not a minute before you came up , pass in at that door. ' The old man looked at him attentively .
She died when I was born .
I didn ' t dare to warn him , and advise him ; but if I had seen direct cause , I would have shown him my example .
' Perhaps a little damp and ague-ish ? ' said <NAME> .
The two days became three , and the three days became four .
With that hospitable invitation , the <NAME> said ' Good day ! ' and walked out and shut the door ; leaving Mr Carker still reclining against the chimney-piece .
<NAME> <NAME> then seized the terrified boy by the collar with very little ceremony ; and all three were quickly inside the house .
<NAME> <NAME> , <NAME> , what you 've trusted to me I 'll go through with .
We must both die ; we are both connected with the dead already , each by a little child .
Near London. ' ' Mine , perhaps you recollect , ' said <NAME> , with a serious look , ' lives down in <NAME> -- one of ten .
' By-the-bye , I HAVE thought of somebody too .
Devise your own means of putting him out of my way , and execute them .
Let some one hold him back .
<NAME> was very glad to see me , and told me that the house had not been like itself since I had left it .
You must follow him , Sam. ' ' <NAME> ' nly , <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> .
'Forgive me for saying so , but I wish you had . '
<NAME> <NAME> had great experience in hackney cabs , and her starting in one was generally a work of time , as she was systematic in the preparatory arrangements .
The bell was ringing , and the <NAME> was a Serpent of many coils , and the <NAME> was getting ready .
" Oh , that 's not quite the worst of it , <NAME> dear ! "
Before the door , were three tall poplar trees , which made it very dark within ; and the wind moaned through them with a dismal wail .
But I do not believe this .
Unless it was , I might not be bold enough to say it .
Yours have been of a much slighter kind , spread over a much shorter time .
Or she might be as ugly as she was rich , without any fear of losing me .
' You know all now , ' she said , raising her eyes to <NAME> ' s .
" It MUST be very good of Mrs. Jellyby to take such pains about a scheme for the benefit of natives -- and yet -- <NAME> and the housekeeping ! "
Here , take hold of my hand , <NAME> .
Did they not , sir ? ' ' <NAME> , I don ' t know that they did , ' said Mr Boffin , curtly .
We asked him if he knew what was doing in it .
And he was so modest , too .
There was encouragement in seeing a ray of light from within , stealing through the dark stern doorway , and falling in a thread upon the marble floor .
Mrs <NAME> listened attentively , until she had finished .
' There was a criminal called <NAME> -- a girl still , but deserted and an outcast .
I call upon you , sir , therefore , to pint out the good .
' I have no brother , ' replied <NAME> .
'You should , lady , and I know you will , ' rejoined the girl , rising .
I can ' t do that , for I am a poor , timid , nervous creature .
I am not much used to parties ; but this is one of business , and such fooleries are an important part of it sometimes .
Upon this doubtful ground , lived Mrs. Wititterly , and at Mrs. Wititterly ' s door <NAME> knocked with trembling hand .
The house is such a ruin that the rats have fled , and there is not one left .
<NAME> , steady. ' <NAME> planted himself into his own corner , as firmly as he could ; and on whirled the chaise faster than ever .
What is there in all this ?
My poor , proud friends , have looked on and approved ; and every tie between us has been deadened in my breast .
" You work hard , madame , " said a man near her .
Let it lie there , let it lie .
<NAME> name ? " " John. " " <NAME> , " repeated madame , after murmuring it once to herself .
I had thought about that , while we had been there side by side .
An exploratory blackbeetle now and then was found immovable upon the stairs , or in an upper room , as wondering how he got there .
All this , doubtless , he knew thoroughly , and had , in his cunning , considered well .
' The old story ; always thinking , and never doing .
<NAME> <NAME> adopted <NAME> as his son .
He refolds it and lays it in his desk with a countenance as unperturbable as death .
They had gone rustling away as if their little dresses were made of autumn-leaves : and they came rustling back , in like manner .
The pastry-cook is hard at work in the funereal room in <NAME> , and the very tall young men are busy looking on .
The second letter , at that moment in <NAME> ' s breast-pocket , particularly remembered him by name .
I believe I was kept at home for that purpose .
I applied the key on hearing this and opened the door .
But , <NAME> mistaken on a point that has caused me more smart in my breast than a flight of savages ' arrows could have done !
And how can I pay ?
" What are you talking of ? "
'You 're a-going to accommodate us , and wot 's to prevent my standing treat for a pint or so , in return ? '
What is this ? ' ' <NAME> , <NAME> ! ' said <NAME> timidly ; sensible of having approached the presence with too much familiarity .

<NAME> waited some little while before he spoke again .
I have had enough of arguing to last one man his life . "
I am never mealy with ' em .
There was a scream as of an individual -- not a rook -- in corporal anguish .
I do not go with Mrs. Jellyby in her treatment of her young family .
But please to drive on -- quick , please !
However , that ' s neither here nor there , just now .

The pleasantest part of the occasion by far , to <NAME> , was the painfullest .
' I ought to know this writing .
' Ay , ay ! ' cried the boy , in the same tone .
Her cutting , gentlemen , was simplicity itself .
Never had visitors a more hospitable reception .
' Now , <NAME> , ' said he , ' now , woman , what are you doing ?
They were much soiled , but otherwise unhurt .
<NAME> <NAME> , with his mouth open , looking for somebody to speak next .
A great wind rises , and the summer is gone in a moment .
" I want , " said <NAME> , who had not removed his gaze from the shoemaker , " to let in a little more light here .
For a moment it had a suspicious look of suicide , arranged to counterfeit accident .
He has the faded appearance of a gentleman in embarrassed circumstances ; even his light whiskers droop with something of a shabby air .

He needed no second entreaty ; and she prepared her father ' s bed , and begged him to lie down .

<NAME> ' s <NAME> is the name Mrs <NAME> christened it when we come into it as a property .
' Oh , that ' s the ' rig ' nal , is it ? ' said <NAME> .
' I knew it ! ' cried the single gentleman , letting down one of the front glasses .
This time she really is going to speak to him .
It shall be a parlour-curtain lecture .
I have my faults , sir , ' said Mr Chuckster -- ' <NAME> , no , ' interposed Mr Swiveller .
<NAME> , with such power of movement as he has , arranges himself a little to receive him .
' I knew it , <NAME> , ' he said , looking round with an air of melancholy triumph , ' that society has been too much for her .
" I do n't know , my <NAME> ; I can scarcely hope so .
' I am almost afraid to disturb him , ' said the child timidly .
' What a timid little goose our Amy is !
' Yes , here he is , flesh and blood , flesh and blood. ' ' Vary little flesh , ' said <NAME> .
' Poor , poor Walter ! ' sighed <NAME> .
But she never explained it ; and it had , in consequence , the charm of mystery , in addition to the advantage of the sharpest expression .
The information we got on these heads from the carpenter , who had charge of these people , was often of the strangest kind .
He acquiescing , we followed at a distance : never losing sight of her , but never caring to come very near , as she frequently looked about .
<NAME> said she did n't know ; perhaps they were designed for teachers , perhaps for the stage .
" The shrieks and the cries were audible there , though subdued by the distance .

Exactly my own views , Mr Boffin. ' Here <NAME> rose , and balancing himself on his wooden leg , fluttered over his prey with extended hand .
For it was a reg ' lar good secret , that was ! ' cried <NAME> , hugging herself .
' Go on , sir , go on .
" To-night , " said the man , putting the pipe in his mouth .
Nothing being said on the other side , he had to begin again , and began with new embarrassment .
he thinks , with a pitying sadness .
Because he felt any new compunction towards it ?
She has lots of expensive knowledge , sir , political and otherwise .
I should have been happy to have made <NAME> a prominent consideration , too , if the case had admitted of it ; but unfortunately it does not . "
" I suppose it 's chops at the <NAME> 's Arms . "
I have a business charge to acquit myself of .
Again -- these three white little loaves are for <NAME> .
'Oh , come in with you ! '
' You have a bad father , have you ? ' ' <NAME> , <NAME> ! ' returned <NAME> , amazed .
' I ' m sure I never deserved it from him , no , nor from you .
' Hear , hear , ' assented <NAME> ' s client .
When <NAME> has a matter of this pressing interest under his consideration , the fat forefinger seems to rise , to the dignity of a familiar demon .
He had witnessed many such removals , and always with pain , though he knew that they departed for their own good .
The old lady is not seventy-three now , my dear Sir. ' The little man paused , and took a pinch of snuff .
Permit me , sir -- if you hold the card a little slanting , this way , you catch the light upon the up-stroke .
Mr Dorrit will allow me to withdraw. ' ' Hum .

" All things have worked together as they have fallen out .
You were the first to mention her name .
The light in the passage was obscured for a moment , and my aunt came out .
She must be well brought up , and well guarded from reposing any foolish confidences where they are not deserved .
I was not crying at anything in particular that I know of ; but somehow it made me cry , to see old friends .
' Look at him , ' cries <NAME> , stretching out his hand admiringly and tenderly , though rallyingly too .

Mr Dombey would be delighted to leave <NAME> in such admirable guardianship .
A Doctor ? " " Yes. " " With a daughter ? " " Yes. " " Yes , " said the <NAME> .
' <NAME> , ass , traitor ! ' ' Drat the man ! ' cried the nurse , looking angrily around .
It lay heavier on my breast than if I had been a most atrocious criminal , I dare say .
Mr Wegg opens the gate , descries a sort of brown paper truncheon under Mr <NAME> ' s arm , and remarks , in a dry tone : ' Oh !

This time , as before , <NAME> turned back along with him .
" Go on , if you please , " said I .
The same face : the very same .

This young gentleman has to accomplish a destiny .
On my knees , I am certain , in my heart and soul I am certain , nothing !
I hope that when I have the pleasure of seeing you , next , this passing cloud will have given place to sunshine .
" Well , well , " said my guardian , comforting him ; " well , well , well , dear boy ! "
Wake up , some of you ! "
I shall come to you again in your regular order , " returned Mrs. Pardiggle with demonstrative cheerfulness .
I do ; I say again , I do .
<NAME> ha ! ' <NAME> gave a satisfactory account of all the little household at <NAME> .
For these particulars or generalities concerning <NAME> , Mr <NAME> was indebted in the course of the day to his own eyes and to Mrs Affery ' s tongue .
" The airs the fellow gives himself ! "
' What did you wish to know next , <NAME> ? ' ' What became of <NAME> ?
I have been wretched , too .
After this , he smoked four pipes successively in the little parlour by himself , and was discovered chuckling , at the expiration of as many hours .
' It ' s almost enough to make us get married after all , isn ' t it ? ' said <NAME> .
' I shall feel proud of your acquaintance , <NAME> , ' said the little doctor .
He stumbles down the stairs and presently comes back , shading a flaring taper with his hand .
But his father -- and his uncle -- were the most profligate coachmen that ever sat upon a box . "
Oliver availed himself of the kind permission , and fell to the floor in a fainting fit .
How should you like to grow up a clever man , and write books , eh ? '
' Does she sing at all ? ' I asked .
' A nice person to prefer a charge against a poor boy ! '
It was a curious place : a large wall , with a gate in the middle , and a gas-light burning inside .
He frightened every one away from him when he was alive , to profit us when he was dead !
'Not at all , my dear , ' said <NAME> humbly .
Having abundance of time for his usual methodical toilette , <NAME> presented himself at the breakfast-hour in his usual white linen , and with his usual neat leg .
' Your mother will be fit to jump out of her skin , my boy , when she hears of this , ' said <NAME> to his son .
'You can do nothing to help me .
This was the state of matters , on the afternoon of , what I may be excused for calling , that eventful and important Friday .
<NAME> things than the <NAME> had at that time to contend with , would have yielded before his persevering purpose .
This deed was done last night at ten o'clock .
' They are a depraved , worthless set .
Here , <NAME> coughed impatiently ; which appeared to afford <NAME> the most exquisite delight .
I have set these people by the ears , and made two new enemies , where , <NAME> knows , I needed none .
' All I will add is , <NAME> forbid that I should touch my Uncle ' s possessions , <NAME> !
Upon the latter , sits a man of sixty ; reading .
You are not to pocket other people 's pounds , shillings , and pence and escape scot-free . "
' Well , <NAME> ? ' ' Mr Headstone coming home , ma ' am. ' In about a minute , <NAME> again hailed .
' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , with such a sudden accession of violence that <NAME> started in his boots , ' I throw you off for ever , miss .
You have pawned your wardrobe. ' ' Everything -- <NAME> ' s too -- all shirts gone -- never mind -- saves washing .
' I beg your pardon , <NAME> ; but have you ever done this sort of thing in your time ? ' said <NAME> .
' Favourites ? ' repeated <NAME> , with the veins in his forehead swelling quickly .
Could you give me any account of her whatever ? ' ' None , ' returned the Patriarch , shaking his big head with his utmost benevolence .
' And now , <NAME> , ' pursued <NAME> , ' I ' ll make a confession to you .
Still , nobody appeared , to claim the dusty youngster from <NAME> , <NAME> .
' I should hope so , ' returned Mr Toots .
One gentleman who stood among this group , appeared to take upon himself the functions of a master of the ceremonies .
As to all the rest—What will be , will be .
' What do you mean , boy ? ' said <NAME> .
' Go away , and shut the door .
It was evident , however , that the only intellectual exercise was that of imitation and memory .
As I had a sorrowful wish to see the old place once more , before it was locked up , I engaged to meet them there in the evening .
Give me a sign that you attend to me. ' She slightly and constrainedly moves her hand .
It was not lost upon <NAME> , who delighted in torturing him , or indeed anybody else , when he could .
I told him that he was more like himself in those latter words than in anything he had said yet .
They hurried away , through several streets , without stopping or speaking .
Our customers over there , seem not to be able to confide their property to us fast enough .
I was disagreeable too , <NAME> ; we were all of us disagreeable together .
Thank you , <NAME> , I do n't know but what I WILL take a marrow pudding . "
At first they were faintly discernible in the mist , and above them the later stars still glimmered .
Like the <NAME> of questionable jollity in the song , They cared for <NAME> , no not they , and <NAME> cared for them .
While these occurrences were in progress , <NAME> made the discovery that <NAME> had a fascinating influence over her .
She will repeat it , in character , <NAME> , to-morrow morning. ' ' In character ! ' ' As <NAME> .
' And where did you leave <NAME> , reverend sir ? ' <NAME> had left him at <NAME> .
<NAME> take it away. " I had never been struck at so keenly , for my thanklessness to <NAME> , as through the brazen impostor Pumblechook .
It was you , was it ? ' ' Me ! ' returned <NAME> , in a loud tone .
' The fact is , I was ruined by having money left me. ' ' Come , come , ' said <NAME> , ' that von ' t do .
Surely this is the heaviest of the three. ' ' You ' ll find ' em much of a muchness , I expect , ' says <NAME> .
And then they fell to shaking hands most heartily again .
And <NAME> , " says <NAME> , opening his arms , " here 's children too !
I am invested with no authority for diverging from them .
I swear it before the God that saw it !
Perhaps with an eye to first impressions , Mr <NAME> was very carefully and trimly dressed , that morning .
It brought a vague expression of dissatisfaction into Mr <NAME> ' s face ; but the door being opened , it was quickly gone .
But my understanding for all this was gone .
We changed again , and yet again , and it was now too late and too far to go back , and I went on .
With these words , he took a thick stick from <NAME> 's hands , who , having delivered another to <NAME> , busied himself in fastening on <NAME> 's cape .
I was on the wrong side of the post .
said <NAME> , clapping him on the shoulder with an air of protection that had something serious in it , though he laughed .
Having dismissed his attendant , and seen the box safely deposited in the coach-office , he looked into the coffee-room in search of <NAME> .
'If your inclinations chime with your sense of duty -- ' <NAME> began .
He rarely joined them on the Saturdays now .
But I held to it , and the harder it was , the stronger I held , for I was determined , and my mind firm made up .
<NAME> <NAME> was so bewildered that he could think of no locality but <NAME> .
' Not at all so. ' ' She is a tiresome creature , ' said <NAME> , pouting .
He does not know it ; we must go to him from here , to tell him of it .
Now , brother Ned , my dear fellow , I ' m ready .
' You have purposely cast a dreadful suspicion upon my mother ' s house .
Do you believe there is any chance of her consent , to balance against the outrage it would be to her ( loving dear old lady ! )
First , not a word more from you about the past .
said the board , looking very knowing ; 'we are the fellows to set this to rights ; we 'll stop it all , in no time . '
I am almost sure he will grant it now , if I ask him .
It appeared to be something droll , for occasionally there was a laugh and a cry of " Silence ! "
' Do you mean that a prisoner forgives his prison ? ' said she , slowly and with emphasis .
Every possible inquiry was made , and every place was searched .
I am the Relieving Officer appointed by eternal ordinance to do my work ; I am not held in estimation according as I shirk it .
My Lady , with a disdainful gesture of the hand that holds the screen , assures him of his being worth no complaint from her .
He tried to shut it out , but it would stream in .
I do n't care for what you say at all .
" Much obliged to you , ma'am ! "
The visit did not originate with him. ' ' He had some conversation with the poor man .
' When are you at home ? ' ' When you like. ' ' Breakfast-time ? ' said <NAME> , in her abruptest and shortest manner .
She never left him all that night .
Do not keep me here , but let me go at once .
He did everything for me except the household work , for which he had engaged a very decent woman , after paying off the laundress on his first arrival .
I never thought of it , before or afterwards .
' Would you have any objection to write down to <NAME> , and ask this favour of <NAME> ?
Let me whisper in your ear . '
" You are the fellow we want , " said <NAME> , in his ear ; " you make these fools believe that it will last for ever .
I had barely time to get down again before the coach started , and I could hardly see the family for the handkerchiefs they waved .
There was a beautiful propriety in that .
She was an old lady in a large cap , with rather a red nose and rather an unsteady eye , but smiling all over .
God bless you , dear Mr Clennam .
With this strange expression on him his thoughts had wandered away .
Wretched marriages don ' t come of such things , in our degree ; only wretchedness and ruin .
I say , he struck me .
'It 's a nasty trade , ' said <NAME> , when <NAME> had again stated his wish .
I ' ve never took charity yet , nor yet has any one belonging to me .
<NAME> played the piano to him , sat by him , and worked and talked , and played some games at dominoes with me .
' Nor pass it over to me ? ' ' That would be the same thing .
Why , he ' s an uglier-looking thief than can be seen anywhere for a penny .
<NAME> ' s story having got abroad , raised him up a host of friends , and many offers of provision for his future life .
' It ' s a dreadful trial to a father ' s feelin ' s , that ' ere , <NAME> -- ' ' Nonsense , ' said <NAME> .
' That woman , <NAME> , ' said the Major , ' is , in her way , a Lucifer .
' That ' s a dreadful fellow. ' ' The alligator , sir ? ' said <NAME> .
But , this was not the change on the village , and on many a village like it .
When he had gone a little way , he looked back .
Has he been here , <NAME> ? ' ' Here , in this room .
' <NAME> , you sir ! ' said <NAME> , for the third time .
In their orderly and punctual progress they brought round <NAME> and twilight .
' I dare say my birds sing better than other birds , and my flowers smell better than other flowers .
So sunken and suppressed it was , that it was like a voice underground .
Can I ever forget ? ' ' As you were then , my sister , I have often thought since , you have ever been to me .
All <NAME> ' s interest is to stick well to the story he has told ; and all his risk is , to depart from it in the least .
His eyes are then fixed upon her , she knows , though her own see nothing but the grass .
' I made an observation to my friend , sir , ' replied <NAME> , always ready to enter into conversation .
'Do not think of that .
He lowered it , and passed a remark on the next change of the moon .
<NAME> will see to your accommodation .
I just makes out to cry , " I know you now !
' Only myself , ' he assented with a sigh .
' Are my feathers so very much rumpled ? ' said <NAME> , coolly going up to the looking-glass .
This is the young lady .
' Now , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , calmly feeling for his whisker , ' it won ' t do .
<NAME> and grind , fag and grind , turn the wheel , turn the wheel !
" Ay ! " returned the sergeant , " two .
On a healthy autumn day , the <NAME> prisoner , weak but otherwise restored , sat listening to a voice that read to him .
' No orders has come in for any friend o ' yourn. ' ' I mean my live friend there. ' ' O !
Does our fiendish contemporary wince ?
says <NAME> , biting his thumb with the appetite of vexation .
<NAME> <NAME> rubs his head with the key while she entertains herself with a sarcastic laugh .
There ' s not a <NAME> in this town , sir , man , woman , or child , but has one ultimate object in life .
One observes my Lord with his white hair , standing , hat in hand , to help my Lady to and from the carriage .
<NAME> <NAME> shakes his head .
I should like to see it .
I dare say she ' ll manage to do it. ' ' Probably , ' said <NAME> .
' The tiny woman ? ' ' Ah ! ' ' I don ' t know , ' said <NAME> .
' Not on no account , ' replied <NAME> .
said <NAME> , involuntarily falling from her strange companion .
No speck , nor spot , nor spatter soiled the purity of any of <NAME> ' s household gods , large , small , or middle-sized .
And then repeated aloud in a tone of astonishment : ' see me righted , sir ? ' ' Ay , ay ! ' said Mr Boffin .
But here again they were disappointed , for the gate was closed , and some fierce dogs , barking at their approach , obliged them to retreat .
How well I recollect the kind of day it was !
' Have you any intention of going away again ? ' <NAME> asked me , as I was standing by .
I had seen <NAME> frequently .
' Nothing the matter , ' replied <NAME> .
And thus poor <NAME> sickened and grew worse , and fell into heavy danger of death , and lay severely ill for many a long round of day and night .
The fright and abhorrence that <NAME> smoothed out of her strong face as she ended this diversion , showed how seriously she had meant it .
But he was a tight-fisted hand at the grind-stone , <NAME> !
" Or I 'll have your heart and liver out. " He tilted me again .
I opened the door ; and at first looked down , to my amazement , on nothing but a great umbrella that appeared to be walking about of itself .
<NAME> there no stranger with him ? ' ' I ' ll take my world-without-end everlasting <NAME> that you warn ' t with him , ' answered <NAME> .
Those who are habituated to the -- ha -- <NAME> , are pleased to call me its father .
' -- ' <NAME> , ain ' t ? ' With a stupid stare .
The <NAME> was not troubled with the faintest idea of any difficulty in retaining <NAME> , or of any responsibility thereby incurred .
' <NAME> and <NAME> , ' cried the gentleman in black , calling on the case , which stood first on the list .
He , a broken , bankrupt , sick , dishonoured prisoner .
Before we had taken many paces down the street beyond it , the noise of the city seemed to melt , as if by magic , into a softened distance .
" Disguise from you is impossible .
I was greatly dejected and distressed , but in an incoherent wholesale sort of way .
His recollections were few enough , but they were all of one kind -- all connected with the poverty and misery of his parents .
' Nor I neither , ' said <NAME> .
<NAME> had only to remember that her star of promise was clouded in the general gloom that hung upon the house , and to weep and be resigned .
' I imagined all this when he was a boy .
His soul is a great deal too large for his frame .
Rising softly , for my charge lay fast asleep , I looked out of the window .
' How do you mean ? ' rejoined <NAME> .
I made it in a moment .
' Mr Dorrit will pardon me , ' said <NAME> , ' if I remark that this is not a time or place for the pursuit of the present conversation .
making her eyes very large .
<NAME> , swift-responsive , appears , receives instructions whom to produce , skims away , produces the aforesaid , and departs .
<NAME> lives -- that is to say , <NAME> has not yet died -- in a ruinous place known to the like of him by the name of Tom-all-Alone 's .
That morning ' s breakfast passed heavily off .
'Let 's have a glim , ' said <NAME> , 'or we shall go breaking our necks , or treading on the dog .
She clung to him as she should have clung to some far better nature that day , and was a little shaken in her reserved composure for the first time .
said this worthy , nodding to the Jew .
Far from it. ' ' Six children , sir ? ' exclaimed <NAME> .
<NAME> ! ' ' What are you doing ? ' said <NAME> , seizing him by the arm .
It will do you good. ' <NAME> hesitated ; but , yielding to his curiosity , rose .
" Why , " said <NAME> , " to tell the truth , <NAME> , this view of the matter had not occurred to me until Mrs. <NAME> mentioned it .
I wouldn ' t be taken upon that. ' ' Why not ? ' asked <NAME> .
I should break through the wall to come to you .
But she 's alive , and I know her . "
' <NAME> ! ' said <NAME> , with dignity .
Let this intercede for me .
Commission to the extent of two and ninepence in a fortnight can not , however limited our ideas , be considered remunerative. ' We were all agreed upon that .
With the first ray of light that struggled through the crevices in the shutters , <NAME> arose , and again unbarred the door .
I do n't attach any value to money .
" What does <NAME> mean ? "
No such artificial means would bring sleep to his eyes .
said my guardian with his good-humoured smile .
" Now , I wonder who it can be about ? "
Say no more , <NAME> , say no more , my child .
We stand around the grave .
' Of course , my dear <NAME> ; of course .
' <NAME> , I have forgotten this gentleman ' s name. ' <NAME> bends over her , and calls to her , ' Mr .
Breathing more freely in a little while , he sat down at the table , and listened again until the clock struck Two .
Why , when these fellows of our acquaintance drink and you drink with them , the more talkative they get , the more silent you get .
The upshot of which , was , to smash this witness like a crockery vessel , and shiver his part of the case to useless lumber .
' My opinion is -- no will. ' It appeared a wonderful thing to me , but it turned out that there was no will .
But neither ever broached the theme .
As they walked on in silence , he could not but see how used the people were to the spectacle of prisoners passing along the streets .
He was so good as to make an appointment for to-night , when you would be at home. ' A dark gentleman .
I ' ll be judged by the gentleman himself .
" A perfect fleet , " said he .
' Dis-gusting ! ' ejaculated both the young ladies .
For , sailors to be got the better of , were essential to <NAME> ' s <NAME> .
In respect of <NAME> ' s <NAME> , the <NAME> ' s parental and admiration knew no change .
And now he ' s to bring home a new mistress , a baby-faced chit of a girl !
<NAME> <NAME> to see <NAME> Rosa. ' This is the announcement of the parlour-maid in chief .
She dismissed the messenger to his own devices , and rode away to her old home .
But she was not to be so easily left .
But , gentlemen of <NAME> , is it in cricket alone that your fellow-townsmen stand pre- eminent ?
It was a nice sickly season just at this time .
I was very much concerned for his misfortunes , and felt that any recognition short of ninepence would be mere brutality and hardness of heart .
All the time , our overfraught hearts are beating at a rate that would far outstrip the fastest gallop of the fastest horses ever foaled .
with a flourish of the arm , and a flush of the face , they were swept away .
' I hope there is ! ' replied Kate .
<NAME> income twenty pounds , annual expenditure twenty pounds ought and six , result misery .
I have not the honour of Mrs <NAME> ' s good opinion .
They were still fishing perseveringly , when he peeped in at the gate for the second time ; but , now they seemed to have got a bite .
He was , at first , somewhat disconcerted to meet us two together ; but quickly decided what to do , and came up to me .
The panic-stricken men pointed to where such articles were kept ; the murderer , hastily selecting the longest and strongest cord , hurried up to the house-top .
All I was going to say was , that I hold myself under an obligation to the coincidence , that ' s all. ' ' Oh !
In the yard , was <NAME> making a new epitaph for himself , on the occasion of his dying of a broken heart .
You told me last night of a friend you had ? ' His name was <NAME> , <NAME> said .
The Jew grinned ; and , making a low obeisance to <NAME> , took him by the hand , and hoped he should have the honour of his intimate acquaintance .
' I can ' t , I daren ' t. ' ' Help !
But supposing he is a free black , and has no owner , it may naturally be presumed that he is done again , and again , and again .
said I , knowing how it pleased her to have her confidence received with an appearance of interest .
What between the buryin ground , the grocer ' s , the waggon-stables , and the paunch trade , the <NAME> flies gets very large .
When he came to bid us good-bye , he brought his mother with him for the first time .
They were coming back , even poorer than they went .
YOU want more painstaking and search-making !
Pretty Nell ! ' Mr <NAME> looked , as he was , all open-mouthed astonishment .
They were always 'My husband , my father , and my brother !
And now come here , and I 'll show you how to take the marks out of the handkerchiefs . '
He might be deemed eligible by you and might be disposed to respond to this proposal .
Remember how poor we are. ' Mrs. <NAME> shook her head , and said , through her tears , that poverty was not a crime .
" You are one of those , <NAME> , " said I , " who make the most of every chance .
' Ay , ' rejoined <NAME> , taking his arm .
The time was once when men as knowing as <NAME> would walk on turret-tops in the starlight and look up into the sky to read their fortunes there .
He was a chance acquaintance , made abroad. ' ' A chance acquaintance made abroad ! ' she repeated .
Tried to nudge you , but you wouldn ' t .
Both times at night , when I was going back .
Only first exchange that nightcap for some more appropriate covering , or we shall be taken for madmen . '
' And the man as puts me in , ' ull never let me out till you go yourself. ' ' Bless my heart and soul ! ' ejaculated <NAME> .
They were all occupied with the poor girl , and I heard <NAME> directing them and speaking to her often .
Now attend a moment ! ' said the old man .
Is it coming on you , <NAME> ?
said the Jew , scowling fiercely on the boy .
That 's a very good card .
<NAME> ! ' prevented his relapse into a doze .
Her boy may have learnt no better !
' The consequences may be dreadful , ' said <NAME> .
( In this he was very warmly supported by Mr and <NAME> . )
But she was too high !
I do what I can for them. ' ' You do what you can for them ! ' repeated <NAME> , walking her on very fast .
She stopped at the corner , and putting her hand in his , wished him good night .
You will wear the green velvet jacket ? ' ' No , no , ' replied <NAME> .
what shall I do ! ' thinks <NAME> , clasping her hands .
It would be impossible to save the family credit for a day .
His lonely daughter , bereft of her final hope and reliance , appealed to them both too strongly .
I do not say that anything is to be done .
Will you take no counsel with me ?
Why I KNOW of fifteen and sixpence that came to <NAME> one night last month , to see me dance the <NAME> Fling ; and what ' s the consequence ?
It ' s of no use cross-examining my eyes , ' cried <NAME> , winking and rubbing them , ' they stick to their first account , and will .
We felt our inexperience , and were unable to help ourselves .
Mrs <NAME> coughed as before , and drew lines on the carpet with the ivory end of her parasol .
' Dear Fanny , what is the matter ?
It hears , my dear child , all sorts of shocking things .
You ' re an active woman at that time , and if you want to get that paper , you can get it .
It was right that all that had sustained me should give way at once and that I should die of terror and my conscience .
said <NAME> , feeling in his breast with a look of alarm .
He was the first to speak , and he spoke thus : ' Yes .
The house was so still that I heard the girl ' s light step upstairs .
I ' ve giv ' notice of the circumstarnce to the police , and the police have took possession of it .
All the ladies in the prison had got hold of the news , and were in the yard .
Two gaolers , who had been standing there , went out , and the prisoner was brought in , and put to the bar .
' Much more than for any other .
' And here ' s the sunny place on the white wall where they one day measured one another .
When they entered together , the shadow of the night of the return again darkened Mr <NAME> ' s face .
I find a woman. ' The colour overspread her face .
Then kindness requires that I should n't go near them -- and I wo n't . "
There was a stage , that evening , when she spoke collectedly of what had happened , though with a certain terrible vivacity .
' Off with you ! ' The boys applied whip and spur , the waiters shouted , the hostlers cheered , and away they went , fast and furiously .
<NAME> is devoted to him .
' <NAME> , ' said the lady , hurriedly , and looking into her face with great earnestness .
' You have said more than enough to him on business , before now .
It might cut somebody , by accident .
By the light of the fire he can be seen looking towards the moonlight .
<NAME> looked after him , but neither moved nor spoke for some time : when he broke what almost seemed the silence of stupefaction , by a scornful laugh .
Is it your pleasure to take <NAME> ? ' ' Ah ! ' said Mr Boffin .
' There may be , in the coffee-room. ' MAY BE .
'What business is it of yours ? '
The tail of <NAME> 's eye becomes conscious of the head of Mrs. Snagsby looking in at the shop-door to know what he means by deserting his tea .
I have only just come to a decision to take one .
" This , " said <NAME> , " is my Beauty daughter , <NAME> -- plays and sings odds and ends like her father .
' <NAME> ! ' said <NAME> , clearing his throat , and warming with the punch and with the fire .
The fellow sends a most abandoned villain with one eye to construct a gateway .
' Not to any stranger , ma ' am , ' said the good lady ; ' but she has been a companion to me for some years .
'There now , <NAME> , ' remonstrated <NAME> , eagerly catching at the word .
At first , none but the surgeon went close to it .
He held her , almost as if she were sanctified to him by death , and kissed her , once , almost as he might have kissed the dead .
' Now let us see , ' said <NAME> .
Every question told. " " I always am sound ; am I not ? " " I do n't gainsay it .
He looked at the work upon the table , and praised the industry and speed of Mrs. Cratchit and the girls .
<NAME> and hours , days and nights , he remained in this same condition .
He is my only relation in the world , <NAME> , and unless you plead for me , I fear I have lost even him .
' Is there nothing I can do ? ' asked <NAME> .
' He ' ll do , ' said <NAME> , ' though it ain ' t what I call him. ' The servant inquired if they had any appointment ?
The <NAME> boys , as may be readily supposed , have very much the advantage of the others in point of personal appearance .
His being my lawyer , and his being the lawyer of your patron is a coincidence .
God send that old nursery tales were true , and that gypsies stole such children by the score !
inquired <NAME> , with well-timed jocularity .
But do not hide from me ; do not steal away alone ; let me keep beside you .
Of her outward appearance I know no more than that she was like her mother .
He was a morose , savage-hearted , bad man ; idle and dissolute in his habits ; cruel and ferocious in his disposition .
Sitting beside him , I made a pretence of working for my dear , as he had always been used to joke about my being busy .
' Did I indeed , sir ? ' said <NAME> .
You see I know enough to know much more with very little help .
<NAME> <NAME> also came to speak to us and did the honours of the place in much the same way , with the bland modesty of a proprietor .
I am much better here , ' said <NAME> , faintly .
If a girl , doll or no doll , swoons within a yard or two of a man 's nose , he can see it without a perspective-glass .
The decent hair-guard that went round his neck and took care of his decent silver watch was an object of envy to her .
I knew he always read at that hour , and as I drew near I saw the light shining out into the passage from his reading-lamp .
He had been overthrown into gutters ; bespattered with mud ; violently flattened against posts .
There were no conspicuous people in it , trading far and wide on rotten banks of religion , patriotism , virtue , honour .
He 's a thief , a liar , a devil , all that 's bad , from this night forth .
Always think of me as quite an old man .
It glides over the park after the moving shadows of the clouds , and chases them , and never catches them , all day .
In the evening , he found the dinner-table laid for four , but they sat down only three .
When all was still , at a late hour , poor crazed <NAME> came weeping to me and told me she had given her birds their liberty .
' Similarly , ' resumes <NAME> , ' I have observations as I can offer upon certain points and parties ; but I make no objections , Mr Venus .
It ' s some time since I was articled , but the payment of that hundred pounds was a great pull .
A four-oared galley hovering about in so unusual a way as to attract this notice was an ugly circumstance that I could not get rid of .
' I beg your pardon , <NAME> ' am ? ' said Mr Boffin , coming to a stop .
<NAME> , hi ! ' <NAME> once more , savagely .
We must , in a measure , assist to turn them up .
" I do n't know , " he said as he looked at me , " what it is that sets me off again -- but -- bosh !
' Sir ! ' ' <NAME> , I am your humble servant , ' said Mr Quilp , to whom the monosyllable was addressed .
That individual is in legal possession of the premises , under a distress for rent .
They told me he was there .
I think <NAME> did too ; I think he darkened the room for that reason .
In fact , mother , I ca n't bear it ; I ca n't make up my mind to it .
Father , he did gain it .
He had nearly got downstairs , when he stopped , and drew the key from his pocket .
But , imbued from her childhood with a brooding sense of wrong , and an inveterate hatred of a class , opportunity had developed her into a tigress .
What was , was all summed up in this : that she was lost , and he bowed down with sorrow and remorse .
Accordingly , <NAME> , as the man who has the greatest reputation to sustain , becomes the interpreter of the general instinct .
" See ! " returned the mender of roads , with extended finger .
She ran in , and was running out again when she saw me .
<NAME> remember what I said to you .
We both grub on in a muddle .
' To make his fortune , ' Mr <NAME> repeated , in the same dumb manner .
Upon these were laid knives and forks for six or eight people .
I should have continued to avoid you , in pursuance of the same set purpose , for a short time longer , if we had not met now .
<NAME> ' t let him come up till I ' ve got away .
Should I do it if I did not ? ' ' Are we to be estranged , <NAME> ? ' asked <NAME> , gazing at her like one frightened .
I ' ll get some cushions out of the church , and you and your friend shall lie down before the fire .
Mr Headstone , I don ' t say what you have got upon your conscience , for I don ' t know .
Upon my word and honour , <NAME> , I don ' t know anything more about it .
' We ' ll go together , ' repeated <NAME> .
When I first had the happiness of looking upon you , it was one fifteen , and had stood at that figure for a lengthened period .
" I hope he did n't die of anything catching ?
For , <NAME> often stops short at itself and dies with the doer of it ; but <NAME> , never .
' Did you ever hear of the great commercial house of <NAME> & <NAME> ?
' I found out an <NAME> gen ' leman as was in authority , ' said <NAME> , ' and told him I was a-going to seek my niece .
Behold me here to prevent it ! ' ' <NAME> is coming here ? ' said <NAME> , with a smile .
Nor are they desirous to prolong their visit , packing the few movables with all possible speed and never speaking above a whisper .
And what that deep red light in the opposite direction ?
He had all the cares of the world on his head in three months .
He was dressed in decent black , a little rusty , and had the appearance of a sagacious master in some handicraft .
' I ' m astonished at that , <NAME> , you being usually so quick !
' What is your great mode of smoothing and managing , <NAME> ?
" My friends , " says he , " what is this which we now behold as being spread before us ?
As he is going to do so again , he happens to look at his coat-sleeve .
" What have I to do with that , or what have you ?
I have observed his face to be not the face of a true friend of the <NAME> .
" But that is a long time .
As often as I raised my eyes from what I was about , I met hers .
' He wouldn ' t blow up alone .
It had been matter of conversation with <NAME> when she was last in town , and this visit was the result .
' What a jolly old Jack it is ! ' cries the young fellow , with a clap of his hands .
Now , if you will fetch any authorised neighbouring somebody to do it in return for my opening the door , I ' ll open the door .
' That is because you are good ; not because I am !
It was interesting to be in the quiet old town once more , and it was not disagreeable to be here and there suddenly recognized and stared after .
Sometimes there is n't any milk , and sometimes the cat drinks it .
' I shall never , <NAME> , ' said Mrs. Micawber , ' revert to the period when <NAME> was in difficulties , without thinking of you .
That it is in the stare of the pictures .
' Is it not likely that it should be ?
' In the meanness of your nature you revile me with the meanness of my birth .
He patiently awaits an explicit answer ; and <NAME> , more baffled by his patience than by anything else , at last desperately whispers a name in his ear .
<NAME> was sitting on a certain time by his window , with her work-basket between her and her old attendant , who was still her faithful companion .
' Now , young man , ' said the porter .
<NAME> looked about him for the <NAME> , and saw it not .
' This is a dry game .
What is that ? ' returns <NAME> .
' He was there once before , ' said my aunt presently .
This last manifestation as by far the most alarming , by reason of its threatening his prolonged stay on the premises , necessitated vigorous measures .
I should n't be at all surprised -- mark what I say ! -- if he got <NAME> a better situation . "
' <NAME> , ' returned my aunt gravely , ' I can ' t say .
' In the river , ' somebody rejoins .
<NAME> ' ee ! ' ' Mrs Meagles and your daughter -- ? ' ' <NAME> as well as possible , ' said Mr Meagles .
'By all means , ' observed <NAME> , with great alacrity .
laughed the same woman , when old <NAME> , producing a flannel bag with money in it , told out their several gains upon the ground .
I see he is listening , but can ' t hear .
<NAME> was in attendance , and loitered about until the expected train came in .
' How very odd you are to-day , my dear !
" That 's very like <NAME> , " says <NAME> .
' Well , ' returned Mr Boffin , ' if I am , that ' s my business .
How could it be otherwise ?
And he did it ; yes , he did !
<NAME> <NAME> ( of <NAME> Salem-House <NAME> , <NAME> ) presided , and on his right sat the distinguished guest .
" Why , what do you mean ? "
It is not usual to cancel articles for any such reason .
He put on his hat and walked quickly down the garden , determined to investigate the matter to the very bottom .
I say " ever since , " as if I had been here a week .
I have no lover , of course .
' He is only glad to see me .
<NAME> , thrusting Mr Flintwinch aside , proceeded straight up-stairs .
He returned to where he had stood before -- advanced a pace -- another -- another still .
<NAME> , astonishment , indignation , and a storm of passions , rushed through the listener ' s heart , as the plot was laid bare .
' Why this is indeed a joy I had not looked for ! ' said Mrs. Crummles , when <NAME> was presented .
If this be real , and her allotted time be not yet come , wake , <NAME> , wake !
' You won ' t see such boys as those very often , I think , ' said Mr Crummles .
" Talk of the angels , " says <NAME> .
Not caring to go too near the door , until the appointed time , <NAME> crouched into an angle of the wall , and awaited its arrival .
said the girl , with an expression of pleasure at his return .
There was duty to be done , and it was done , but not harshly .
' Stay a moment , <NAME> ; stay another moment .
' You know what I mean , do you , <NAME> ? ' inquired <NAME> , looking hard at him , through the spectacles .
I ' m glad he has lost his mistress .
<NAME> steam , tide , wind , and horses , all abate their speed , to linger on such happiness ?
He has had a fever .
I calculate you ' ll have got through that case of the corporation , Judge , by this time , now ?
To return to the letter .
<NAME> ' t tell me that that handsome child has been in the habit of prowling about as she ' s done these last two or three days .
Each doing what she suggested , there was no want of assistance .
" Sir , I have told you why .
' I don ' t like it , Mr Venus .
Do you recollect him ? ' No .
They were very fond of one another : that was certain .
There must be many ways of doing it .
Be good enough to pinch him , sir -- in the leg , if you please ; nothing else wakes him -- thank you .
It at once reduced <NAME> to begging , as a special favour , to be allowed to say what Mrs. <NAME> was most curious to hear .
and gave my little basket of housekeeping keys such a shake that they sounded like little bells and rang me hopefully to bed .
' I never threshed a boy in a hackney coach before , ' said <NAME> , when he stopped to rest .
<NAME> , who would not have smiled for the world , replied composedly : ' But you are a very good penman , sir .
The person on the sofa , who appeared to have a cold in his head , gave such a very loud snort that he startled me .
If I were but legally executor of <NAME> ' s will !
And as to the brim of his hat , it ' s narrow .
That 's my mother. " " Oh ! " said he , coming back .
He seems fully determined to drop down ; don ' t he ? ' Mr <NAME> opined that such was clearly his intention .
I see one thing , " said <NAME> .
" You will excuse me , <NAME> , " observes <NAME> .
But she 's patienter than others would be , and is clever too , and always willing , up to the full mark of her strength and over .
My Lady merely waves her off with indifference , saying , " There , there , child !
With a good deal more of that sort , which I wondered how they knew .
' I am not complaining , ' he returned , ' I am only stating the case .
'If he had , ' said <NAME> , 'the dog 'ud want to lead us away to where he did it .
' This is very kind of you , <NAME> ' r <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
' It ' s below stairs , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , and he ran down after it .
When it got so high , it got the upper hand of me , but this is how I always know there 's a eight in it . "
Everybody stares to see me using my own ; and two or three gentlemen are strongly disposed to banter me on my prejudices , but don ' t .
<NAME> <NAME> , satisfied , expresses high approval and awaits her coming at the door .
" If , sir , " she begins , " in my knowledge of my secret -- " But he interrupts her .
' In such good spirits ! ' said <NAME> .
I thought of it much afterwards .
<NAME> ! ' The form moved , rose , advanced , and dropped upon its knees at his feet .
All others he was willing to forget .
" Dear boy , " he said , as I sat down by his bed : " I thought you was late .
<NAME> <NAME> was suspected , with three companions .
I know she ' s a naughty , mischief-making old thing !
<NAME> of what must separate me , through the whole remainder of my life , from purity and innocence -- from you , of all the earth .
You don ' t come in here , ' said <NAME> ' s better-half , interposing her person , which was a robust one , in the doorway .
If the mistress put such a construction upon the behaviour of her new friends , what could the companion urge against them ?
Mellers it , is the word I should employ , Mr Boffin. ' His wooden conceit and craft kept exact pace with the delighted expectation of his victim .
' I said that it was better as it is ! ' she whispers , as she holds me in her arms .
It ' s the parting from her old playfellow and friend -- her favourite cousin -- that has done this .
Would you recommend his being spoken to , or his being left alone ?
said I , with my eyes filling fast ; but I thought they might , when it was not for myself .
At first I was painfully awake and vainly tried to lose myself , with my eyes closed , among the scenes of the day .
" You will not be late ? " " I shall be there before the commencement. " " And before the tumbrils arrive .
I knew it to be <NAME> 's file , and I knew that he knew my convict , the moment I saw the instrument .
And they were married with the sun shining on them through the painted figure of Our Saviour on the window .
' Oh ! ' said <NAME> , catching him a smart box on the ear .
A lady of your sense and strength of character will be prepared for my now declaring it void and taking my own course . "
I did lose money before , certainly , but it doesn ' t quite follow that he took it .
I was fluttered by her being unexpectedly so near ( she was almost within speaking distance before I knew her ) and would have risen to continue my walk .
She was followed by the whelp .
' Eh ? ' cried the old man , surveying him from head to foot .
How irrevocable would have been his knowledge of it , if he had remained with me but another hour !
' Mr <NAME> , ' said the boy , ' I want a word with you .
' Your lovely woman was told her fortune to night on her way home .
And what ' s this straggling about in an idle sort of a way ?
How few of <NAME> 's faces are left alone to gladden us with their beauty !
It was far otherwise with little <NAME> .
' One who brings you news , was the answer , in a woman ' s voice .
" Pray think , once more , <NAME> , " said I .
It was the man ; the man he had followed in company with the girl , and whom he had overheard talking to <NAME> .
It was a by-street , and there was nobody about , or in the few wretched shops they passed .
You will go , wo n't you ? "
exclaimed the doctor , aghast in his turn .
Each of you will do what is best for the other , if not what is best for yourselves . "
But she gave us her blessing , and the assurance of her lasting friendship , and spoke to us , generally , as became a Voice from the Cloister .
Externally , <NAME> showed no signs of being mellowed by these glowing vintages .
<NAME> , <NAME> , I have ruined <NAME> !
That is what it means .
Matters having reached this point , Mr <NAME> explained , and the virtuous feelings of his son being thereby calmed , they shook hands , and harmony reigned again .
It was like asking , as a favour , to be sentenced to transportation from <NAME> .
You charge again ' me that <NAME> got lost sight of , and was no more thought of .
<NAME> , fact , fact , everywhere in the material aspect of the town ; fact , fact , fact , everywhere in the immaterial .
' They are sitting up beyond their usual hour , I suppose .
She has not money , you have not youth .
' <NAME> , <NAME> ; it ' s near <NAME> ' s , and handy for me , you know .
She shared it with him ; and lingering on without pain , but without hope , her life ebbed slowly away .
I am not sure but that at first he was inclined to think it rather a moody scheme , and one that might do a brooding mind harm .
' My dear ' ; and he stopped and turned to me : ' would you like to see your -- ' ' No , father , ' <NAME> interposed .
You go and tramp , ' he ses .
But <NAME> asked , for me , whether he lived there , and they said he did .
returned <NAME> , opening her eyes .
" I think you have got the ague , " said I .
Such an honour and pleasure -- it ' s both , <NAME> ' s mother , it ' s both -- is not to be forgotten so soon .
It was a prison for men .
It was ten o ' clock when I went out .
That he is killed ? ' ' He is dead , then ! ' exclaimed <NAME> .
! ' ' Nonsense ! ' said <NAME> , turning back again .
The business will get rather complicated if I ' ve many more customers .
The unwelcome visitors advanced into the middle of the room .
There would be more of an adventurous spirit in it , and consequently more of a certain sort of poetry . "
A happy New Year to all the world .
' You have seen me , young lady , ' repeated <NAME> , as she did not answer , ' once before. ' <NAME> coughed again .
Now I think of it , the gentleman who brought us to your house . "
That ' s an under-handed mind , sir. ' ' Do you say there ' s something against him ? ' <NAME> asks .
That made me think of all my past life ; and that brought me , as it ought to have done before , into a better condition .
If I am to remain and hold up my head , I must be scratched .
How could they be near us , and be green and fresh ?
I prepared <NAME> for <NAME> ' s arrival and it was not long before he came .
" He appears to be an excellent master , " I observed .
It would suit ( he considers ) a young bride , to perfection ; especially if of a rather diminutive style of beauty .
He looked dejectedly round , and slunk away ; and , as he reached the door , the titterings of the paupers broke into a shrill chuckle of irrepressible delight .
' To carry out an idea , ' repeated <NAME> ; ' and that ' s the great convenience of living in a thoroughfare like the <NAME> .
' Confound you , what do you mean ? ' said the stout man rising a little , and supporting himself on his elbow .
At last it falls ; and then a dumb old woman lies upon the bed , and she is crooked and shrunk up , and half of her is dead .
But not as she did .
Following it at a respectful distance , <NAME> passed into the bed-chamber , where a fire had been sometime lighted , and was burning briskly .
He must have given him the slip somehow , or he would n't be so easy . '
As to me , I sat on his left hand , and the rest were grouped about us , on the nearest beds and on the floor .
I have a right to complain of it as almost a breach of confidence .
But the figure that he seeks is not among them .
Not that that is much though , I am sure .
And if they forgot me , I should never know it , ' replied <NAME> .
He thought besides , ' This is a very odd beginning .
Ever so fur as I went , ever so fur the mountains seemed to shift away from me .
There ' s many of them , I ' m sure , that would be the better for it. ' ' Thank you , <NAME> .
He sat up in bed and listened .
' How are you , <NAME> ? ' said he .
' You are Mr <NAME> , the new schoolmaster ? ' he said , greeting <NAME> ' s kind friend .
and I should like to leave a small balance in his favour , to be settled when he can .
You couldn ' t expect that , could you , <NAME> ' am ? ' ' Oh !
I congratulated her ( as she addressed herself to me ) upon this fortunate addition to her income and wished her a long continuance of it .
' Do you know nothing of a woman ' s anger ? ' ' You have a saucy tongue , <NAME> , ' said Mr Dombey .
I should have liked to know her .
'Has it long gone the half-hour ? '
But , then twisting himself suddenly round upon him , he found his look unchanged .
The vendor observing this , increased in loquacity .
You must accommodate the visit to the demands upon my time .
' Are you there , <NAME> ? ' said her brother , looking in at the door .
What I say is , I must come off clear and full or not at all .
' He ' s in a cab , sir , at the door .
The host smiled , disappeared , and shortly afterwards returned with a steaming jorum : of which , the first gulp brought the water into <NAME> 's eyes .
Dear me , where is she ? ' ' <NAME> , my dear ! ' cried <NAME> , ' where are you ?
<NAME> started at the word of command , and before a gun was fired he had reached the lake .
He took his usual poor eighteenpennyworth of food in his usual indigestive way , and had as little to say for himself as ever a wonderful man had .
An Appearance in the <NAME> 29 .
<NAME> ' ll remember like a good soul , won ' t ye , that the market price is dreffle high just now ?
Say what it is , only say what it is. ' ' My dearest <NAME> , nothing .
I never thought this of him. " " My husband , it is so .
" That 's the whole of it . "
' All right , ' was the reply .
It was <NAME> , and I had to stir the pudding for next day , with a copper-stick , from seven to eight by the <NAME> clock .
I could only hope to do so by chance. ' ' I think , <NAME> ' r <NAME> , I know wheer to look. ' ' It is dark .
When the <NAME> had considered it a little while , she said to the tiny woman , And you keep watch over this every day ?
I HAD one , but what he may think about it at the present time I can ' t say .
There -- <NAME> -- sounds well , I think , sir. ' ' Very , ' said <NAME> .
My father ' s not in the way , and won ' t be in the way to-day , ' said <NAME> .
She is rather long , notwithstanding ; but by and by I hear a rustling at the door , and someone taps .
' <NAME> for ever ! ' roared the honest and independent .
That what the <NAME> had to do , was to stick on to the national ship as long as they could .
Mr <NAME> has seen him for some days past , and a very clever man I believe him to be .
Hundreds of People The quiet lodgings of <NAME> were in a quiet street-corner not far from Soho-square .
' My dear , I haven ' t one ! ' ' Not one ? ' ' Well !
Tell me more of your history .
'That 's the boy , is it ? '
' Eh ! ' said <NAME> , with a look of virtuous surprise .
" Now , mistress , " says the lawyer , tapping the key hastily upon the chimney-piece .
But it succeeded , and she asked , after a silence : ' Is he married ? ' ' <NAME> , deary , ' said the mother .
Should possibilities be worse to bear than certainties ?
' An escapade of a week or so. ' ' And how are they all ?
Whether it was the following Sunday when I saw the gentleman again , or whether there was any greater lapse of time before he reappeared , I can not recall .
I quickened my pace , and , passing among them , wondering at their looks , went hurriedly in .
I would give them my aunt .
I say the children ; I have two little daughters .
' I scorn your shifty evasions , and I scorn you , ' said the schoolmaster .
" Pray , pray tell me more . "
' I would not for the world , sir , ' replied <NAME> .
' Now , is it all thought out ?
<NAME> paid the first week in advance. ' ' Then you had better get them out at the end of it , ' said <NAME> .
' Show the gentlemen into the parlour , <NAME> , ' said the landlady .
Let us waste no words about it .
At first the whelp would not draw any nearer , but persisted in remaining up there by himself .
Here <NAME> , seized with a fit of coughing in the midst of his triumph , breaks off to ejaculate , " Oh , dear me !
How can you consistently ask me such a question ?
It said , " What the de-vil are you crying for ? "
Keep this quiet , and make no inquiry for me ; it is useless .
Let us go forward and meet her. ' As they advanced , she saw them coming , and seemed rather troubled .
Let me think -- what was the year again ! '
<NAME> goes into various shops and parlours , examining the inhabitants , always shutting the door first , and by exclusion , delay , and general idiotcy exasperating the public .
So will my daughter <NAME> be .
' So good-bye , <NAME> , ' said my aunt , ' and take care of yourself !
asked the other man in a hoarse voice .
I am as giddy as a drunken man .
' Yes , ' said Mr Carker , ' we have received it !
I am extremely sorry to see this in you , <NAME> , " I repeated .
<NAME> , hooray , hooray ! —And now , <NAME> , let ' s have a little talk about <NAME> .
'In the King 's name , ' cried the voices without ; and the hoarse cry arose again , but louder .
said <NAME> , clenching his fist .
He is the father of my twins !
Hardly relying on my own interpretation of the indistinct sounds he made , I caused <NAME> to hear them .
I wrote her a long letter , in which I tried to make her comprehend how blest I was , and what a darling <NAME> was .
The latter mode of pronunciation is perhaps the most in favour .
' Not I , <NAME> , thank you , ' said <NAME> , laughing .
I will make no such pretence to you .
<NAME> clasped his hands , and sank feebly backward .
I ' ve told her how I ' m sitivated ; she ' s ready to vait till I ' m ready , and I believe she vill .
<NAME> <NAME> instantly struck in , and begged to inquire what Mrs MacStinger meant by that , and if she knew whom she was talking to .
<NAME> night , my dear. ' Somehow , <NAME> was not so well pleased with this assurance and this prospect as she might have been .
My mind flew back to <NAME> ; and could it be <NAME> , I thought , who used to draw the skeletons !
It being necessary to take soundings every minute , and to feel the way with the greatest caution , Mr Wegg ' s attention was fully employed .
' Shall I speak of our affairs , mother ?
Also , there were two double-bedded rooms , -- " such as they were , " the landlord said .
'An hour this side of midnight , ' said <NAME> , raising the blind to look out and returning to his seat .
' I have the satisfaction to know you are , sir , ' said <NAME> .
He comes down , he goes to <NAME> , he relates what we have agreed upon , and he states our case better than we could .
He left his brother to be happy .
But , in our youthful ecstasy , I don ' t think that we really looked before us or behind us ; or had any aspiration beyond the ignorant present .
He finished by freezing a cup of tea for his own drinking , and retiring at his lowest temperature .
<NAME> has gone to the doctor 's to get a bottle of stuff for a sick woman but will be here anon .
I wish she had me to deal with ! ' said <NAME> , reddening with the energy of the wish .
' May I -- <NAME> , I but ask the question humbly -- may I say it ?
At any rate , I made up my mind to be so dreadfully industrious that I would leave myself not a moment 's leisure to be low-spirited .
Everybody knows how like the street the two dinner-rows of people who take their stand by the street will be .
" This is a very sensible woman , " said my guardian .
' I hope I am also , ' rejoined the other .
I ha ' gone t ' th ' brigg , minded to fling myseln ower , and ha ' no more on ' t .
said <NAME> , improving the accident .
First of all , she would bring out the immense account-book , and lay it down upon the table , with a deep sigh .
How long did you stay there ? ' ' About ten minutes ; I should say not more .
What other reason could Miss Tox have for connecting Mr Dombey with her summer days and dandelion fetters ?
There ' s no love lost between us , I assure you , ' said <NAME> , tying her bonnet strings with a jerk .
' Well , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
Come here , <NAME> and Poddles. ' <NAME> was the pet-name of the boy ; <NAME> of the girl .
He took very little supper , but was a long time over it , and often reverted to his brother ' s declining state .
I took the opportunity of moving well behind my table .
' Do you know me now , man ? ' The landlord scratched his head , looked at the ceiling , and at the stranger , and smiled feebly .
They renewed their charitable efforts , and he beat them off .
The <NAME> , and the <NAME> LVII .
<NAME> to the <NAME> , my dear ma ' am , if you don ' t believe me .
' Are you not coming , <NAME> ? ' ' <NAME> , I will remain here .
I understand there were some of our very best men among ' em .
My sister went for the stone bottle , came back with the stone bottle , and poured his brandy out : no one else taking any .
' Bof -- fin ! ' ' Yes , <NAME> , ' he answered , coming out of a fit of abstraction , with a sigh .
They threw themselves into committees in the most impassioned manner and collected subscriptions with a vehemence quite extraordinary .
The engaging frankness with which he made this declaration really had a disinterested appearance and captivated my guardian , if not , for the moment , <NAME> too .
<NAME> ever stopped him in the street to say , with gladsome looks , " My dear Scrooge , how are you ?
'So it is , ' acquiesced the undertaker .
Does she go out to shun her <NAME> , <NAME> ? ' ' La bless you , no , <NAME> ' am .
" Why , look at you all ! " bawled this figure , addressing the inn servants .
Even when we 've good cards , <NAME> and I ca n't make nothing of 'em . '
" What could you have on your mind , you know !
' The message relates to family matters , ' said <NAME> , hesitating .
cried the office keeper , running out .
' <NAME> , who can help seeing the way to do it ? -- you astonish me !
Following the current with her eyes , she saw a bloody face turned up towards the moon , and drifting away .
Pick me up ; I want to hear better .
I had on ' y to think as she was found , and it was gone .
' There , Mr Blandois ! ' said <NAME> , showing it , ' I hope you may think that worth coming so high to see .
And finished his breakfast as if the flavour of the <NAME> , and also of the ham and toast and eggs , were a little on the wane .
One timid look around -- one moment 's pause of hesitation -- he had closed it behind him , and was in the open street .
' There is no longer any occasion for uneasiness , ma ' am .
Make up the fires , and buy another coal-scuttle before you dot another i , <NAME> ! "
The <NAME> resented her claiming to know people of such distinction .
She had never breathed her dread of him to any one but <NAME> .
As soon as he arrived in <NAME> he would present himself to this old friend , but he must say nothing of his intention now .
They are both tarred with a dirty brush , and I can ' t have the <NAME> tarred with the same brush .
And the <NAME> was above all !
<NAME> said the <NAME> had a secret ?
' <NAME> , sir , by a cask of sugar. ' ' He is a good creature , ' said <NAME> , with great earnestness .
But if he had looked at me for an hour or for a day , I could not have remembered his face ever afterwards , as having been more attentive .
He shrunk , as if to let the thing go by .
No. ' ' Might I ask , without seeming impertinent , whether you have any intention of selling it ? ' ' Certainly not .
He looked at the two , less and less attentively , and his eyes in gloomy abstraction sought the ground and looked about him in the old way .
' You mean Mrs. Nickleby ? ' said <NAME> .
Oh , I assure you he is very odd ! "
You pusillanimous , abject , cringing dogs !
It ' s in the lining of the mattress , <NAME> .
Whereas them medical doctors ' wives do n't flop -- catch 'em at it !
Do n't break cover too soon .
After a few words of course , they sallied into the street .
So immensely absurd ! ' It fell to his lot , now , to stipulate for secrecy .
Very rarely tells him anything more explicit .
" You seek to close these places on the <NAME> Day ? "
' He ' ll be doing something desperate ; he ' ll murder somebody .
The world was very busy now , in sooth , and had a deal to say .
He had the special peculiarity of some birds of prey , that when he knitted his brow , his ruffled crest stood highest .
Do not tell me that you wish I had lost this ; for it has softened my heart to all mankind . '
'No , no , ' rejoined <NAME> , finding his voice .
Thus for ten days <NAME> bent over his pillow , laying her cheek against his .
Now I know he knows where she is gone. ' ' Can not undertake to say , sir , I am sure ! ' <NAME> again rejoined .
Do you see those grovelling and wandering eyes ?
But perhaps my brother ' s penetration may enable him to have some insight into his character .
'What is the name to me ? '
" In their presence , " pursued <NAME> , " I will tell you , young man , what to say to <NAME> .
' Under such circumstances , what could a man of <NAME> ' s spirit do ?
We must not let you pass out of our knowledge .
<NAME> was in the garden in the centre and hurried out as soon as I appeared .
<NAME> , ' said <NAME> ; ' my friend , <NAME> , <NAME> , M.C .
The dream will have come again .
' Get down to life ! ' Mr Fledgeby seemed to think it rather a good suggestion , and with a nod turned round .
Who , standing in the portal , received them with ghostly gloom , and all her other appliances of ceremony .
When the Major was too hoarse with meat and drink , and the display of his social powers , to render himself intelligible any longer , they adjourned to coffee .
' You have a son , I believe ? ' said Mr Dombey .
But the <NAME> forbid that I should repine under any visitation .
' What ' s the t ' other name ? ' said <NAME> , looking round .
" Now , do n't open your mouth too wide , because you do n't look handsome when you do it . "
Blind leaders of the blind !
' Out of the question to marry her , ' said <NAME> , ' and out of the question to leave her .
I loved that stupid mite in a passionate way that she could no more deserve than I can remember without feeling ashamed of , though I was but a child .
The room was lighted as of yore , and at the sound of our entrance , she stopped and turned .
This artificial respiration ceasing , do I feel any faint flutter under my hand upon the chest ?
Get behind the door , old chap , and have the jack-towel betwixt you. " I took the advice .
inquired the doctor ; who had returned to the room shortly after the commencement of the story .
And she evidently thought so , for she wept most grievously .
The <NAME> ' s breath came short and thick with consternation .
The first sitting was limited .
She sends you her regard .
and away with me ! ' ' To-night ? ' murmured the old man .
' You are not going , papa ? ' said <NAME> , anxiously .
' I think you will , ' said Mrs. Mann , who had noticed the tone of the refusal , and the gesture that had accompanied it .
She falters , trembles , and puts her hand confusedly to her head .
The <NAME> trembled to think that <NAME> was not to be got rid of , and had been brought back in a coach .
Beyond town , we found a heavy mist out , and it fell wet and thick .
Mrs <NAME> ' s niece , <NAME> , took cold pork .
We have nothing more to say , and may break up our pleasant party . '
My mother dropped her work , and arose hurriedly , but timidly I thought .
' I 'm <NAME> , ' said the charity-boy , 'and you 're under me .
<NAME> , hope , and charity , shared his whole nature among them .
" By all means , <NAME> . "
If you were not an ornament to <NAME> , and if I was not a benefactor to <NAME> , you and I would never have come together .
' The monk turned to the second sister .
<NAME> , meagre , ragged , scowling , wolfish ; but prostrate , too , in their humility .
' What DID you do here when you were here before ? ' asked <NAME> .
Have you lately come to settle in this neighbourhood , or do you own to another neighbourhood ?
There 's father coming , " cried the two young Cratchits , who were everywhere at once .
As fast asleep as she is now , I hope ! "
I wrote to <NAME> as soon as <NAME> and I were engaged .
You here again ? " said <NAME> .
I am rational again now , and you shall advise me .
My trade is not of that kind that I need be roused from bed .
<NAME> was thus left at leisure to entertain himself with his own thoughts , until they arrived at the drawbridge at <NAME> , when <NAME> pulled up .
But they said , wait a few days more ; and then , wait a few days more ; and still she neither ran nor walked .
<NAME> , my boy , <NAME> , my dear , what have you been doing ?
You have no right to do it ; I ' m sure we never interfered with you .
' I don ' t deny , ' added <NAME> , ' that my schooling was cheap .
' You are a young man , ' she said , nodding .
' My dear , ' said <NAME> , ' I ' m very sorry .
<NAME> , the world is before you ; and it is most probable that as you enter it , so it will receive you .
We may have detained her longer than she expected already . '
You spoke of my sister ' s tears .
Do you know it , or do you not , <NAME> ? ' says the Major , almost in a passion .
Her nerves is so very delicate , you see , and soon unstrung .
<NAME> ' t I seen you before ? ' ' Once before -- if you had your eyesight , ' replied <NAME> ; the conditional clause in an under-tone .
You wish me to speak to her , and tell her so , and entreat her to be your wife .
Because , as I say , it is not good for man to be alone. ' <NAME> appears to commit this original idea to memory .
" What floor do you want ? " " The top .
Seeing the faint light of early day without , the girl rose to undraw the curtain .
Perhaps , see the great crowd of people with its rush and roar , bearing down upon them , too .
As they come through the dismal passages , some officers of the jail who are in waiting there , congratulate him , in their rough way , on his release .
' I was thinking of the other proverbial church person -- Job , ' said <NAME> .
Probably it is through Provis that you have received the explanation of <NAME> -- in <NAME> ? " " It came through <NAME> , " I replied .
'It is very inexcusable in him if he stops to play with any other boys , ' said the young lady , smiling .
The yard was so dark that even <NAME> , who knew its every stone , was fain to grope with his hands .
' If oaths , or prayers , or words , could rid me of you , they should .
' It is refreshing to know that you hold my excellent friend , <NAME> , in such high esteem .
'Oh no , I wo n't hurt him , ' replied the officer , tearing his jacket half off his back , in proof thereof .
She and his father had been at variance from his earliest remembrance .
It is considered not unlikely that he will get up an imitation of the coroner and make it the principal feature of the <NAME> in the evening .
And I am -- quite sure ! ' She might rely upon it , said <NAME> .
She , too , was turning homeward , when she heard a strange sound .
' You would not give her pain ? ' ' I am not so sure of that , if it would only rouse her .
' What did you think of that ? ' asked <NAME> , when <NAME> went round to the stage again .
' They were all fine babies , ' said <NAME> .
' How do we know whom he is deceiving there ?
' Go on , <NAME> ; do go on .
We made the round of the principal theatres , too , with great delight , and saw all the plays that were worth seeing .
To the <NAME> Road we went and there inquired at Mrs. <NAME> 's residence for Mrs. Guppy .
As he turned the key in the lock , he surveyed me with some astonishment which was not diminished when he looked from me to my companion .
' And yet I have some respect here .
Neither did it revive for more than a few moments when she once or twice afterwards glanced at <NAME> or at me through her glass .
For it 's quite impossible that I can put my papers away . "
To see the great wheels slowly turning , and to think of being run down and crushed !
He may think of her constantly , or he may never think about her .
' So you said just now , my dear , ' replied <NAME> .
' She is pale though , and looks much exhausted .
He was angry only one night , and that was not to me , but <NAME> .
On hearing this most unexpected sound , <NAME> looked , first incredulous , and afterwards amazed .
Mrs <NAME> took the opportunity of his being so engaged , to get a better observation of his face than she had yet taken .
Are you going to return there ? "
how devoutly he wished he could !
He closed his book hastily ; and was at once ushered into the imposing presence of the renowned <NAME> .
' I ' ll tell ' ee more ; hear this , too .
I have found my son -- my youngest , who went away for a soldier so long ago .
Somewhere must be thought of .
' ' <NAME> won something she didn ' t expect , I think , haven ' t you , dear ? ' said <NAME> , maliciously .
' Not at your peril ? ' ' No , <NAME> , ' said Mr Boffin , shaking his head good-humouredly .
Through the heart of the town a deadly sewer ebbed and flowed , in the place of a fine fresh river .
' You are unusually mysterious tonight. ' ' Cold , perhaps , ' returned <NAME> ; ' cold , perhaps .
If I got a little pair of shoes by any chance , she would take ' em off and sell ' em for drink .
He sat in his usual place and attitude like a great stuffed figure .
" Pretty well , grandmother , I think . "
Among other havens of domestic tranquillity and peace of mind , my feet will naturally tend towards the King ' s <NAME> .
' I should like to sleep on that question to-night , ' he answered doubtfully .
It 's well it 's the beer , and not the pot , as hit me , or I 'd have settled somebody .
It was his better nature to be true to her , if it were his worse nature to be wholly selfish .
Mr Mortimer Lightwood and Mr <NAME> took a coffee-house dinner together in Mr Lightwood ' s office .
We are going to cross here .
' This evil , if evil it be , has been of my own seeking .
He took her mantle from the wall , and tenderly wrapped it round her .
It was spacious , and I dare say had once been handsome , but every discernible thing in it was covered with dust and mould , and dropping to pieces .
And she has acted up to it glorious ! "
' He is quite well , <NAME> , thank you , ' said <NAME> .
' Ah , my poor head ! ' said Mrs. <NAME> , with a faint smile .
They have rumbled through the streets , and jolted over the stones , and at length reach the wide and open country .
Though <NAME> was not at that time aware of it , the class of gentlemen before alluded to , proceed on just the same principle in all their transactions .
The spinster aunt was knitting .
Find the door where the witnesses go in , and show the door-keeper this note for <NAME> .
Oh dear , how very kind of you !
' I am afraid you have been giving her some of your wicked looks , my lord , ' said the intended .
<NAME> <NAME> is the type and model of a young drummer .
" No , my dear , not ill .
We must have <NAME> , you know .
so very soon ? ' ' I have thought of this for weeks , and why should I postpone it ?
" I will not hear you say such shameful words ! "
you should have rung the worker ' s bell , ' said the footman , touching the handle of one in the door-post .
' Get up , pig ! ' growled the first .
' I say , ' said the other , looking over the rails , and speaking in a hoarse whisper ; 'what a time this would be for a sell !
They are nothing but good to me .
" How do you do , sir ?
' <NAME> us on what grounds you make this accusation , ' said <NAME> .
Why does he move so softly to-night ?
In the service I mentally insert <NAME> ' s name -- I put her in among the <NAME> .
exclaimed the old lady , starting ; 'do n't talk in that way , child .
Do not speak of money at present .
' And if it be a necessity— ' <NAME> faltered .
<NAME> , <NAME> , admission for admission .
This desperate threat effectually broke up the party .
Whether he had been attacked and defeated by <NAME> , and was ashamed to show himself after his discomfiture .
<NAME> is no object here .
The subject did not admit of a doubt .
It ' s the only thing in all the world that I am fit for , or that ' s fit for me .
' Here you are , ' said <NAME> , ' bonds -- take care of them .
It happened that in the street they had several times passed a dingy house , apparently empty , with bills in the windows , announcing that it was to let .
The <NAME> , at his best , appeared so poor a substitute for the love and pride of parents .
' And I ' ll tell you what , my dear Copperfield , ' said <NAME> , ' your friend <NAME> is a young fellow who might be attorney-general .
" Jo , can you say what I say ? "
" <NAME> out of this office .
The arrival of this unexpected heir soon taking wind in the court still makes good for the <NAME> and keeps the court upon its mettle .
C. " ' said the stranger -- ' queer set out -- old fellow ' s likeness , and " P .
<NAME> <NAME> was in the last degree amazed and disconcerted at sight of <NAME> , and had murmured involuntarily , ' Look here !
<NAME> <NAME> 's niece 's sister -- the plump one with the lace tucker : not the one with the roses -- blushed .
' Very sorry , ' said the crestfallen <NAME> .
I have stood between your father and mother for a number of years .
' But we are always glad to come home , father ; now , are we not ?
But you began by saying that we took different views , you know .
That will be his place , -- there , " striking the table with her stick , " at my head !
There was an empty room above-stairs at the wooden <NAME> ' s , which , in days of yore , had been <NAME> ' s bedroom .
My low tap at the door was answered by <NAME> .
Evidently close at hand from the peculiar shock it communicated to the air , yet subdued as if it were far off .
' Well , so your old master and young mistress have gone ? ' ' Where ? ' rejoined <NAME> , looking round .
' I see him a-winkin ' at her , with his wicked old eye , ' shouted a fourth .
' I thought it was " adore. " ' ' " Love , " my dear , ' retorted <NAME> .
The fact is , the girl was washing the glasses .
The old man looked , irresolutely and helplessly , first at her , then to the right and left , then at her again , and shook his head .
I deigned to make him no reply ; and , taking up my hat , was going out to bed , when he came between me and the door .
' Come , you let me alone , ' said the boy , parrying <NAME> ' s hand with both his elbows alternatively .
It is well meant , I have no doubt , but I reject it .
he said , speaking in a homely , rustic way and with great vehemence .
But no hand was there , and it opened no more .
<NAME> Solicitor-General then , following his leader 's lead , examined the patriot : <NAME> , gentleman , by name .
The seizure of the station with a fit of trembling , gradually deepening to a complaint of the heart , announced the train .
<NAME> ' t I say so ? ' Here Mrs. <NAME> sobbed .
I never do ; I never have done .
But I can ' t think about the lesson .
said the Jew , drawing his chair forward , and speaking in a very low voice .
In short , must leave it alone , like or no like .
There was nothing for it , but to turn back and begin all over again .
The turnkey nodded ; and the companion passed in without being asked whom he wanted .
' I am not aweer , <NAME> , that you have any right to address your conversation to me .
He expressed great gentleness and kindness for my father 's state , and I am sure he felt it .
' I am sorry , <NAME> , ' said Mr Dombey , ' that you should not have thought it your duty -- ' She looked at him again .
Thus , she walking backward and he walking forward , they came into their own room .
A man of the name of <NAME> .
I mean to pay him too , ' retorted <NAME> .
If you please , miss , " said <NAME> in a whisper , with her eyes at their roundest and largest .
<NAME> curious , your delightful sex is ! "
Would you object to my writing it ? "
But she couldn ' t control herself to go any further .
' Excuse my putting it to you , <NAME> , but now really !
<NAME> is now at work upon embroidery or some such pretty thing , and as she bends her head over it , my Lady watches her in silence .
And keep as near me , as you can . '
' Put me down for another twenty -- or -- stop a minute , stop a minute .
Do not use such strong words. ' ' He might have laid my dear boy dead at my feet .
growled <NAME> , in his accustomed voice , as near as he could feign it .
We see enough ! ' cried <NAME> .
' And is <NAME> absolutely banished ? ' said the Major , thrusting in his purple face over the steps .
<NAME> ! ' looking into the lines .
' Not this morning , ' he said to the dog .
So strange , to have the road-dust on his feet instead of the coal-grit .
" When did he come from <NAME> ? "
Finding her still very restless on this head , they made him up a bed in an inner room , to which he presently retired .
Nothing more was said between the happy pair .
' <NAME> ' said <NAME> ; and down they sat .
I looked up , and met her sharp bright glance respectfully .
He wandered through the rooms : lately so luxurious ; now so bare and dismal and so changed , apparently , even in their shape and size .
A happy party they were , that night .
<NAME> <NAME> grasped the undertaker by the arm , and led him into the building .
Mrs <NAME> circulated the news , as she received congratulations on it , with a careless grace that displayed it to advantage , as the setting displays the jewel .
' Dear Miss Trotwood , is that all the history ? ' said <NAME> .
' Not come in search of you , you see ; but still seeking some one .
' You have no connection with any of those rascally papers have you ? ' said <NAME> .
' " A man , " replied the figure .
' He said about an hour , ' replied <NAME> -- politely of course , but without any indication of being stricken to the heart by <NAME> ' s charms .
<NAME> , let us be courageous .
The whole system of shipping and conveying these unfortunate persons , is one that stands in need of thorough revision .
You don ' t often meet with such behaviour in young men , and it strikes one more when one does meet with it. ' ' Oh !
<NAME> care of the pigs .
' <NAME> and gentleman ? ' inquired <NAME> , almost breathless with impatience .
What discussion , <NAME> ? ' ' Shall I tell him , Mr Fledgeby ? ' asked <NAME> .
I made it a rule to take as much out of myself as I possibly could , in my way of doing everything to which I applied my energies .
Therefore it is sealed and deposited for posting among the iron correspondence of the day .
' Open the door , and let me take my dear friend <NAME> to my arms !
So was <NAME> , for he was seldom otherwise .
In one part , carcases of houses , inauspiciously begun and never finished , rotted away .
Why have I alluded to it ?
" Then , cousin <NAME> -- " <NAME> laughingly began again .
' How could you presume to come here on such an errand , you scoundrel ? ' ' <NAME> !
When the narrative was concluded ; he raised his head hastily , as if about to speak , but on brother <NAME> resuming , fell into his old attitude again .
Where does any one say I was seen ? ' returned the girl , sullenly casting down her eyes .
I told you so beforehand , my dear , ' said <NAME> .
But that ' s not all , sir .
'Go to him , ' Biddy say , 'without loss of time . '
' <NAME> , I were never good at showin o ' t , though I ha had ' n my share in feeling o ' t .
' I am certain of it .
cried <NAME> , to all appearance much relieved .
inquired my guardian , almost sternly .
I write the exact truth .
He would do nothing to make it a desperate venture , and he had very little fear of his safety with such good help .
Carrying these with <NAME> ' s aid , he passed up to his dwelling .
And why have you done it ?
In short , she was shaking the curls again , when the little dog came running along the walk to our relief .
more shame for him , ' thought <NAME> .
' <NAME> word , my dear sir , very harsh word indeed .
<NAME> looked as if she would like to trace the connexion of ideas between <NAME> and <NAME> ' s <NAME> ' s <NAME> .
Not so , by any means .
The door is opened by the same weak-eyed young man , whose imbecility of grin at sight of Mr Toots is feebleness of character personified .
Her lips quivered and opened , in spite of her utmost efforts to keep them still .
<NAME> day to you , gentlemen ; good day ! "
' I think I see him now , ' cried the Jew , bending his eyes upon his pupil .
<NAME> ' t you speak to him ?
Nicholas could not go to bed without expatiating on the excellences and munificence of the brothers <NAME> , and relating the great success which had attended his efforts that day .
It had vanished from the earth .
' Tight-Jeff or Slack-Jeff , it don ' t much signify : it ' s only tight-rope and slack-rope .
<NAME> went on , and the turnkey began to fail .
' Never owed her a penny , <NAME> ' r , ' said <NAME> , in a low voice , and with visible marks of trepidation on his countenance .
' " I ' ll astonish you , " said <NAME> , putting his hand in his pocket .
I can scarcely believe it now .
<NAME> ' t tell me so if she has not. ' ' She has , ' cried <NAME> .
<NAME> kept one hand on my lips , and raised the other in a listening attitude .
You will find the cold mutton on the table . "
'Will she be buried to-morrow , or next day , or to-night ?
'He has brought me to this lonely place to murder me ! '
There is a splendid wedding in the church .
I am in now , as one of the regulars. ' ' Oh !
' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' I dare say you have been annoyed in the <NAME> ; there are some odd gentry there .
Was he prejudiced against the race of lawyers ?
We all three went home together next day .
He went away in high spirits .
<NAME> kind for once , and sing us an <NAME> song. ' ' What do you care for an <NAME> song ? ' she returned .
' <NAME> ' s the matter with me , ' replied <NAME> nervously .
Think of this now , <NAME> and Mrs. Micawber .
<NAME> <NAME> L. <NAME> 's <NAME> .
' Good-bye ! ' ' Good-bye ! ' said the pretty housemaid .
So Mr <NAME> bought a gift of each sort , and paid handsomely for it .
Even <NAME> standing in a window , moodily swinging the tassel of a blind , gives it a smarter jerk now , as if he found himself in better case .
' Have you been travelling ? ' Mr Short replied in the affirmative with a nod and a smile .
What fine hidden sensibilities are touched in such a case , no echoes tell ; but it is so , and it was so here .
' I ' ll not detain you any longer now , ' he said , putting a crown into <NAME> ' s hand , and looking towards the Notary .
More remarkable by being so removed from the crowd it was among than if it had been lifted on a pedestal to be seen , the figure attracted all eyes .
They lingered about , in the fields , for some hours .
There was my brother , as I read in chance <NAME> papers now and then , rising to be prosperous and famous .
Without other announcement or ceremony , <NAME> walks in .
" Since then , " said I , " we have never spoken on the subject except once . "
In taking me to him my guardian told me this , and also explained how it was that he had come to think of me .
" <NAME> , " I urged , " it is not so hopeless as that ? "
His blood is infected , and objects lose their natural aspects in his sight .
' Our judgments -- I am supposing a general case -- ' ' Of course , ' said <NAME> .
<NAME> may complain , but if <NAME> grumbles by so much as a word -- oh dear , down with him , down with him directly .
Now then , just you hear a word or two from me .
Here somebody cried out , ' Shame , <NAME> !
Were you one of many children ? ' He shook his head .
All these proceedings occupied <NAME> so much , that it was not until the following day that he saw <NAME> again .
They left that fancy ware to boys and girls , and boarding-schools and books .
<NAME> , still looking , and always looking with an immovable countenance , at the opposite side of the world , made no reply .
" A tremendous family to provide for ! "
Ten o'clock at night ? " " Yes , sir .
" Do n't shake your head , " said <NAME> .
This matter is not at all in my course of practice and is not in my office .
His thoughts , as yet , have no wider range than home .
That ' s a cautious fellow. ' ' He is a very cautious fellow indeed , ' returned <NAME> .
<NAME> out of his house .
His sister gently touched him on the shoulder , and pointed to it .
Through the munificence of Mr Boffin .
'Bear a hand with the boy , ' cried <NAME> , beckoning furiously to his confederate .
I am sure I hardly know how it ' s done ! ' ' Are many of the young ladies with you ? ' I inquired .
' Not a syllable , sir , from my man , if we talk till doomsday , ' returned the captain .
Always proceeding from a rigid mouth and closed teeth , as if the jaw were locked and the face frozen up in pain .
' Very well , ' cried <NAME> with an air of resignation , ' then I suppose it must be done !
You seem to know all about ' em , ' said <NAME> .
' Yes , Miss. ' And threw back his head and laughed .
And where ' s the good of it ?
' Yes , <NAME> , it is , ' replies <NAME> , advancing .
If that was bad , I am sorry ; but you repeat it after consideration , and that seems to me to be at least no better .
The Captain himself was in the last extremity of shabbiness , with large whiskers , and an old , old brown great-coat with no other coat below it .
" And not only here , but you will go to <NAME> 's too , perhaps ?
<NAME> <NAME> looked more astonished than hospitable , at sight of this uninvited party in his dining-room .
'Yes , I know you are , ' said the gentleman : 'You 're hungry too , a n't you ? '
' And <NAME> is here , ' said <NAME> , in rapid conclusion ; ' and , could you believe it ?
It was a case of jealousy .
' Sam ! ' said <NAME> , calling over the banisters .
" I hope , guardian , " said I , " that you may not trust too much to my discretion .
What do you mean by this noise , you hussies ? '
' <NAME> has gone for an airing on the <NAME> .
<NAME> , Florence. ' <NAME> turned so pale , and spoke so earnestly , that <NAME> did not need her restraining hand upon her lips .
He looks into the second : not there .
When his hollow voice broke silence , they all three started .
<NAME> laid his hand upon his shoulder .
Confused , but sensible that something might depend on his presence of mind , he commanded himself , and was silently attentive .
The house was silent as the grave .
They were the prelude to the first reception of Mr and <NAME> at dinner , and they skilfully placed <NAME> on his usual ground in the new family .
Why not , when you can have one so devoted to you !
'If she lasts a couple of hours , I shall be surprised , ' said the apothecary 's apprentice , intent upon the toothpick 's point .
I couldn ' t have done it , <NAME> .
'Did you tell him to lock her and bar her in ? '
His head was all on one side , and one of his eyes was half shut up , as if he were taking aim at something with an invisible gun .
<NAME> ith a bad piethe of bithnith , thith ith .
This here conduct of yourn won ' t suit my book , <NAME> .
Come ! ' ' Yes , <NAME> , ' returned the <NAME> .
I hope you didn ' t take cold .
The great majority were silent and still , looking fixedly at the ground .
' Mr Wegg , ' said <NAME> , with another flush .
" <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , " returns <NAME> , " put it to her ladyship to clear that up .
<NAME> masses of the same material , carried forward by the wind , and shone through by the burning sun , stalked in the distance like pillars of living fire .
I have no need to observe that I do not wilfully or negligently mislead my readers and that before I wrote that description I took pains to investigate the subject .
' My own feelings exactly , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , putting her apron to her eyes , and shaking her head .
Here , too , the bride ' s trustee ; an oilcake-fed style of business-gentleman with mooney spectacles , and an object of much interest .
He walked up one street , and down another , until exercise had abated the first passion of his grief ; and then the revulsion of feeling made him thirsty .
The Secretary kept silence for a little while ; then merely said , ' You are wholly mistaken , <NAME> ; wonderfully mistaken .
He did neither , and meanwhile the result of this private marriage was a son .
I do n't tell it you on information received .
Who should we bury , <NAME> ? ' returned the sexton .
I hid my tears in the bedclothes , and pressed her from me with my hand , when she would have raised me up .
It can be proved , sir .
' <NAME> gracious , <NAME> , what is the matter , what have you been doing ? ' cried <NAME> .
She said them slightingly , but not with displeasure .
He still wore knee-breeches , and dark cotton stockings on his nether limbs ; but they were not _the_ breeches .
There are bad people in it , Mr <NAME> , but if there were no bad people , there would be no good lawyers .
I should have been more fit for Heaven than I ever have been since .
<NAME> took the bit off , and put it in her mouth .
' You mean something more , as concerns myself and my intention .
That 's the time of day .
No veiled future dimly glanced upon him in the moonbeams .
The <NAME> paused a moment , as observing his condition , and giving him time to recover .
<NAME> must have irritated him , -- made faces at him .
I may not see her again for a long , long time .
' I won ' t take one of the others , ' said <NAME> , tying the knots of the bundle very tight , in the severity of her resolution .
Then you see , <NAME> , " he returns , " you are not to be trusted .
" I am fond of boating .
He is a child , you know ! "
<NAME> <NAME> wiped from his forehead the perspiration which his walk had engendered , glanced complacently at the cocked hat , and smiled .
<NAME> electors of the borough of <NAME> .
It was then calm , radiant sunset .
A face of a transparent paleness ; every feature in it clearly defined ; one set expression on it .
' Fanny is not going to live with us just now , father .
<NAME> Orlick he 's been a bustin ' open a dwelling-ouse. " " <NAME> ? " said I .
The other gentleman with him , in the red under-waistcoat and dark moustache , is the <NAME> <NAME> , his bosom friend .
' If you please , partner , ' said <NAME> , rubbing his hands .
' I was going to do so .
As soon as any gentleman found his number , he took possession of it by immediately undressing himself and crawling into bed .
' It ' s better for me to be stupid than uncomfortable , isn ' t it ? ' said <NAME> .
He seldom or never took the liberty of standing with his back to the fire unless he was quite alone .
What dear flowers ! ' said <NAME> .
The air , the movement in the court , the lapse of time , or the combination of these things recovers him .
Yes , they do happen to be bloody .

<NAME> and her baby sister were so exactly alike , and so completely one , that in our thoughts we have never been able to separate them since .
Two half-quartern brans ; pound of best fresh ; piece of double Glo'ster ; and , to wind up all , some of the richest sort you ever lushed ! '
' Thank you , dear <NAME> ! ' said I .
I say to them , What else are you made for ?
' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , before whom Mrs General instantly loomed , ' no , I thank you .
If I consulted merely my own interests with <NAME> , I should not be here .
The windows of the chamber where he lay , I darkened last .
The mild <NAME> could not possibly bear malice at such a time , if at any time .
I have heard that Mrs. <NAME> was understood to suffer great mortification from her daughter 's ignoble marriage and pursuits , but I hope she got over it in time .
I sat down by his side in silence .
" No , my love , " said he .
Guess. ' ' I am not good at guessing anything. ' ' She did .
' Ye-es , ' said the other , turning full upon him .
The store of creature comforts was not the chief part of the visitor ' s reception .
" He was put there , " says Jo , holding to the bars and looking in .
<NAME> , <NAME> ! ' ' Get along with you , you wretch , ' said the hand-maiden , obviously not ill-pleased with the compliment , however .
' What more could you do ! ' sneered Quilp , ' couldn ' t you have done something less ?
I fancied that I could detect in his manner a consciousness of this , and a purpose of always holding her in suspense .
It 's a monomania with him to think he is possessed of documents .
' <NAME> , does it ? ' said <NAME> .
Its effect was precisely what a more experienced observer would have foreseen .
' You are putting it on yourself , father , and getting into all this injury of your own accord ! ' said the young gentleman morosely .
'Why , the gentleman 's got him , ' replied the officer .
he asked aloud , winking at us and pointing at her as she turned away , affecting to sweep the grate .
said the Jew , seizing the Dodger tightly by the collar , and threatening him with horrid imprecations .
The furniture was not the same , and the figure in the chair was not himself .
Give me a week. ' ' One week , ' said <NAME> , turning to his companion , ' from today .
The kinchin lay will be a fortune to you . '
It reflects disgrace on no one living , except you who use it .
He seemed to feel that as long as <NAME> could make no discovery without his knowledge , he was so far safe .
<NAME> and I both laughed , but not so loud .
Hence the concession , and hence the appearance of <NAME> , piloted in by the man , man .
The wine being by this time poured out , <NAME> drank to Mrs. Perker and the children , and <NAME> to <NAME> .
The clerk and clergyman then appearing , we were ranged in order at those fatal rails .
" Do n't lose your temper as well as your money , " says <NAME> , calmly knocking the ashes out of his pipe .
'It wrings my heart to hear you ! '
' It ' s the contemplation of this sort of thing , that makes me deplore my fate in being a bachelor .
' I have taken the measure of the two women that died last night , <NAME> , ' said the undertaker .
'And mind you do n't poison it , ' said <NAME> , laying his hat upon the table .
Can I not recall you -- forgive me again ! -- to a better course ?
' Not very well , dear Mr Boffin ; I have fluttered myself by being -- perhaps foolishly -- uneasy and anxious .
' The young lady might think herself well off , ' she observed , ' to have such a beau .
Mr <NAME> , I drink yours .
And you needn ' t nudge him , Mr <NAME> , for I know your work begins early tomorrow , and I say the same to you .
I hope they may never come to hear of it .
" Would any one believe this ? "
' So you vouldn ' t subscribe to the flannel veskits ? ' said <NAME> , after another interval of smoking .
Among her pre-matrimonial transactions with <NAME> ' s father , <NAME> ' s mother had raised money of him at a great disadvantage on a certain reversionary interest .
He suffered for this on several occasions ; and particularly once , when <NAME> laughed in church , and the <NAME> thought it was <NAME> , and took him out .
Though I never knew what they were ( being in <NAME> ) , further than that they were highly eulogistic of the lineage of <NAME> ap-Kerrig .
' Compliments. ' ' Love ! ' repeated <NAME> , with a little stamp of her foot .
This unhappy boy , <NAME> , has been the occasion of much domestic trouble and uneasiness ; both during the lifetime of my late dear wife , and since .
It made a great impression on me , and I remembered it a long time afterwards ; as I shall have occasion to narrate when the time comes .
Whether there was , or not , we must leave the reader to determine , when we have faithfully recorded the behaviour of the individual in question .
Where are my friends ? ' ' You ain ' t got no friends .
" Twice before , " says <NAME> .
" No letter that can possibly have been overlooked ? "
However , it ' s soon set right .
' She goes on errands as well as any one. ' <NAME> laughed .
We shall meet at dinner-time .
Ai n't the lady the t'other lady ? "
'Stand still , a minute , ' cried the voice ; ' I 'll be with you directly . '
At which astounding intelligence , <NAME> clasped her hands , fell into a tremble , and shed tears of sympathy and pleasure , like the good-natured creature she really was .
" My dear doctor , " said I to <NAME> , in this very room , the very last time he came .
Was he to be told that , he wished to know again , by his own son on his own hearth , to his own face ?
To have been out in such a wind , and not to have known it was blowing !
But they ' re <NAME> metal. ' ' The silver will be the brighter when it comes , ' said I .
I congratulate you on your feathers .
<NAME> and still eastward through the stale streets he takes his way , until he reaches his destination : a miserable court , specially miserable among many such .
The craving man on the jury rubbed his hands together , and restored the usual hand to his mouth .
<NAME> <NAME> had arrived on the wheels just now alluded to , and came running into the room in a breathless condition .
He was a miserable wretch , but her word was more than a law for him .
" Then he 's as good as gold , " said the little creature -- Oh , in such a motherly , womanly way !
" She has no daughter of her own , has she ? "
His social existence had been more like that of an early <NAME> , than an innocent child of the nineteenth century .
<NAME> walked forth , elated with the scene ; and all was brightness and splendour .
'You do n't mean to go yourself , I suppose ? '
<NAME> at <NAME> and <NAME> !
' Oh the joy of -- ' ' Be rational , sir , pray , ' said <NAME> .
He has the power to render us happy or unhappy ; to make our service light or burdensome ; a pleasure or a toil .
'You know that <NAME> is worse to-night , my fascinator ? '
During the time of my illness , we were still in <NAME> , where Mrs. <NAME> had come , on my guardian 's invitation , to stay with us .
' <NAME> is rather vulgar , my dear .
You must not return to us any more .
Meanwhile the chaise proceeded , without any slackening of pace , towards the conclusion of the stage .
For as she looked , she saw him murdering that fond idea to which she had held in spite of him .
Dismissed ! ' said <NAME> , giving <NAME> his hand before lightly waving it , as if he waved the whole subject away .
He inquired particularly after Mr Merdle .
she added in the same breath , laughing as he laughed .
Her hand , for a moment , left the velvet chair to bring a knife within her reach upon the table ; then she stood as she had stood before .
<NAME> and water I alwayth take. ' He had already called for a glass , and now called for another .
That he was a muscular man , strong on his legs , and that he was browned and hardened by exposure to weather .
She would have some fair reason for looking down upon me , I thought , if she saw me frightened ; and she would have no fair reason .
' Ye-es , if I can , ' returned the other , promptly .
" Is this a cut ? " said <NAME> .
' No better yet ? ' inquired <NAME> .
Not a little more magnificence , therefore , on the part of <NAME> .
Mrs. Pardiggle accordingly rose and made a little vortex in the confined room from which the pipe itself very narrowly escaped .
It would be such a hard surprise. ' ' I don ' t see it at all , ' blustered <NAME> .
The school reopened next day .
He only requires to be understood .
I merely said that you were paying a hackney coach .
Do n't be afraid of it . "
The idea of your coming down the Lane yourself !
He made the most dismal sounds I have ever heard produced by any means , natural or artificial .
' I know you ' ll be sorry afterwards .
I hope I have learnt how to accommodate myself to the changes of life .
" That they are what they are , do not blame me ! "
' Did I look well in snuff-colour ?
now I ' m off. ' ' I hope you are , ' said <NAME> to himself .
I chose it as a conspicuous part of the house .
Good-night ! ' Still covering her face , she sobbed , and answered ' Good-night , dear <NAME> , ' and silently ascended .
Come and see. ' He went on again , and <NAME> accompanied him .
We all drew nearer to the cages , feigning to examine the birds .
" She 's gone forrard to the Police Office , " returns <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> tripped up the steps to the house-door , tripped down the steps with the key , tripped across the little garden , and opened the gate .
My Uncle ' s child made people ' s blood run cold , some times , she did ! ' ' <NAME> ? ' asked <NAME> .
' Well , <NAME> , what ' s the matter with you ? ' said <NAME> .
He strengthens and invigorates a man , <NAME> , does <NAME> , in his moral nature. ' Mr <NAME> snapped at the expression .
The Beginning of a Longer Journey LII .
" I could n't make him hear , and I softly opened the door and looked in .
Excuse me if I recommend you not to chafe so much , not to be so impetuous , not to wear yourself out so .
The attitude was no less familiar to her than the tone of voice had been .
' I never thought you ' d get better .
He spoke of him , in short , not bitterly or meaning to bear hard upon him , but as anybody might who saw him as he showed himself .
In the atmosphere of vague anxiety and dread that lowered about them in connexion with their fugitive brother , this sound , unusual there , became almost alarming .
<NAME> had been dozing ; but looked worse , and was more feverish than he had appeared yet .
' We had better , ' said this subordinate minister of justice , ' get to the office while there ' s a magistrate sitting .
I have been faithful to my post since the days of his <NAME> Highness the <NAME> , and I will not desert it now .
The lady was at the farther end of the room , and once she ventured to wave her hand , as if beseeching my uncle ' s assistance .
' But bless your hearts and eyebrows , all this sort of thing was nothing to my uncle !
The little citizen , not to be outdone , declared her to be a celestial witness .
' Things come about very strangely ! ' thought <NAME> , as he walked home .
<NAME> ' t stand staring at me , but do look sharp , will you ? ' Offering no further observation , <NAME> huddled on his clothes .
If the thing were gone , my dear <NAME> , might not the fear go with it ?
To speak unreservedly to you , I do .
<NAME> care how you spend it , and do n't get yourself into trouble . "
Then he too stood , with his doubled hand upon the table near it , waiting to be addressed .
' A schooner , from <NAME> or <NAME> , laden with fruit and wine .
Squeers was jealous of the influence which his man had so soon acquired , and his family hated him , and <NAME> paid for both .
I am talking of <NAME> as if she was a man-of-war .
<NAME> there no other neck to clasp ; no other face to turn to ?
All ' s over. ' Therefore , the police sent for something to cover it , and it was covered and borne through the streets , the people falling away .
The sensation was like being touched in the marrow with some pungent and searching acid , it set my very teeth on edge .
" Kit ' s coming to-morrow morning , I know .
' Why nat ' rally , ' said Mr Riderhood , ' ain ' t I always thirsty ! ' ( <NAME> at the absurdity of the question . )
My shoes were by this time in a woeful condition .
If you would empower me to do it , I would do it for you with the greatest satisfaction ! "
' I will , directly , sir , ' replied <NAME> : undoing the chain , and turning the key .
To <NAME> and <NAME> , and into <NAME> .
This was addressed to <NAME> , who now made his appearance ; that gentleman , motioning <NAME> to retire , brought in the two ladies , and shut the door .
His anxiety , his eagerness , and affliction at this pass are pitiable to behold .
' I am delighted to hear it .
Did you think that I was long gone ? ' It is as the face of a woman , shaded by a quantity of rich dark hair .
' We are older than we were , I see , ' said my aunt .
I know too much about it , sir .
Whatever the old girl says , do -- do it ! "
I have come to ask if you would let me stay with you ? ' ' Why should you stay with me ?
Now , hear me , my dears !
She stands looking at him as he writes on , all unconscious , and only her fluttering hands give utterance to her emotions .
'Do you live in <NAME> ? '
She prayed him to forgive her , before my Agnes came into this world .
At length they arrived at the large stone .
But all these sights were of short duration , being speedily broken up by coffee , and the desertion of the room .
Quickening their pace , they turned up a road upon the left hand .
' I believe , father , ' said <NAME> , ' he will not come back to town to-night. ' <NAME> turned away , and said no more .
His man looked back pretty often as he went , but got no hint of him .
thieves ! ' shrieked the usurer , starting up and folding his book to his breast .
'Not too strong , ' replied <NAME> , with a delicate cough .
' If you please , ma ' am , ' I began .
' Can you drive ? ' said the fat boy .
' And there really is no hurry , you know , ' said <NAME> in a lower voice .
' What insupportable creature is this , coming in ? ' said <NAME> , ' I can not hear it .
The poor girl was sitting on the floor where they had laid her down .
' I think I have caught it now , ' said <NAME> .
I am more important to my sister than he thinks .
The childish feet of long ago , did not tread such enchanted ground as theirs do now .
As he looked at the fire , I thought I saw a cunning expression , followed by a half-laugh , come into his face .
' <NAME> , aunt ! ' I seriously believe it had never once entered my head for a single moment , to consider whether she was or not .
She ' ll drop down the river with that theer tide .
When I came back , she was dying ; and all the blood in my heart has dried up , for they starved her to death .
I must see him to-night , for I faithfully promised to do so .
' I am sure I thought it was the boy , or I would n't have meddled with him .
' And you see , <NAME> , ' he added , dropping his voice , ' how powerful money is , and how anxious people are to get it .
<NAME> , and thin , and pallid , he awoke at last from what seemed to have been a long and troubled dream .
Likewise you 're a oncommon scholar. " " No , I am ignorant and backward , Joe. " " Why , see what a letter you wrote last night !
I yield. ' <NAME> was at once overwhelmed with blushes and expressions of gratitude , of which latter commodity neither <NAME> nor Mrs. <NAME> was by any means sparing .
Neither was his manner influenced .
Not in the least likely .
How can I ever thank you ?
You speak as if he had threatened you in some dark way. ' ' He has never spoken to me about—that .
What would be the consequence ?
' That ' s cheering ! ' ' I have only one difficulty , aunt. ' ' Say what it is , <NAME> , ' she returned .
I ask , for information. ' ' My dear <NAME> , I wish I ever had ! ' ' Then you have not ?
She is never to blame in any such instance .
'Bless her , she 's going off ! '
' <NAME> ' t you find <NAME> blooming , sir ?
May I hold the pens ? ' The remembrance of her pretty joy when I said yes , brings tears into my eyes .
At one time , she was all cordiality and ease ; at another , all stiffness and frigidity .
When she had entered two or three laborious items in the account-book , <NAME> would walk over the page , wagging his tail , and smear them all out .
' Wicked one ! ' ' You have been here before , if I am not mistaken ? ' said Mr Dombey .
But its sound had revived a long train of miserable <NAME> , and the procession would not stop with the bell , but continued to march on .
Among the trees and not far from the residence he pointed out the spire of the little church of which he had spoken .
If there must be such a shadow anywhere , I would keep it for the future in my own breast .
I thought she would have come round again before this , but she hasn ' t been here. ' ' About <NAME> -- ' said <NAME> .
' Your way lies there , sir , ' said <NAME> , in a suppressed voice , that some devil might have owned with pride .
I have seen enough of you to know that you are a bully and coward .
It was as well that he did so ; for although the <NAME> was not gone long , he was gone much longer than he had proposed .
I am sure you don ' t. ' ' I do , ' returned the old woman .
He never opened it without occasion .
he exclaimed , " I fear you more than any spectre I have seen .
<NAME> <NAME> gave him good day .
' I am sure we are very much obliged to him , ' observed Mrs. Nickleby .
That young man hears the words I speak .
The woman sits beside him , very attentive to the pipe , which is all the while at his lips .
cried <NAME> , holding up his hands .
' <NAME> of <NAME> is not to be plundered and nobody suspected .
' He is not being educated anywhere .
' Wot a game it is ! ' said the elder <NAME> , with a chuckle .
I won her through a rash vow .
' I don ' t mind it at all .
' Did I always say that that ' ere blessed child was the most interesting I ever see ?
I replaced the razor in its usual drawer , unfastened the door , and called loudly for assistance .
I couldn ' t , <NAME> ! ' said <NAME> .
I was a listening. ' ' Was you , indeed ? ' said Mr Wegg , dubiously .
' I knew you would admire my brother .
Take me away ! ' With one swift turn of her lithe figures <NAME> laid the little beauty on a sofa , as if she had never caught her up .
<NAME> pound a week -- it ' s too cheap , <NAME> .
It looked very comfortable indeed .
<NAME> is a sort of distant connexion of mine -- it doesn ' t matter how ; I needn ' t enter into that .
He thought , if this man could be raised up now , what would be his foremost thoughts ?
All things in it are of the past .
' Oh , yes , it ' s all right , ' replied Mrs. Crummles , anticipating the question .
" Tell her how it was . "
<NAME> ' t you knock her cap off , or her tooth out , or scratch her , or do something or other to her ? ' asked <NAME> .
She hurried out to meet him ; and little Bob in his comforter -- he had need of it , poor fellow -- came in .
'Amen to that , my child ! '
Mrs Alfred <NAME> faced her lord .
When the shadow of the church-porch swallowed them up , victorious Gruff and <NAME> likewise presented himself to be swallowed up .
In connection with the quaker <NAME> , there is a picture by <NAME> , which is exhibited for the benefit of the funds of the institution .
<NAME> , I had brought in all our hammers , one after another , but without avail .
'Just a leetle drop , with a little cold water , and a lump of sugar . '
He shook the snow from his hat and clothes , and brushed it away from his face , while I was inwardly making these remarks .
<NAME> ' t say , " Oh , <NAME> , <NAME> ! " That ' s childish .
If <NAME> were in her worst , I intensified it .
' <NAME> and water-erily you mean , sir , ' he returned , with some little thickness of speech , in consequence of the Gum-Ticklers having tickled it .
This fact is interesting , as illustrating the secret connection and sympathy which always exist between great minds .
He ' s my brother. ' ' He ' s MY brother ! ' cried the preacher .
He says to the woman , " Miserable creature , what has he done ? "
This is the witness encountered by appointment , by me , <NAME> .
' Never mind , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , with dignity .
It had no variety but in depth .
I had recognized her with amazement , for <NAME> .
Though a young man , I have ferreted out evidence , got up cases , and seen lots of life .
Let me have a word with you . '
' With all my heart , ' said Mr Swiveller .
' I am sir , ' replied the landlord .
' We have only met each other once before , you know .
It must not be lost. ' He tapped at the cottage door .
Mrs <NAME> rang for candles as soon as the <NAME> had closed upon him .
' O ' course you air , ' said <NAME> argumentatively .
This has not been broken very long .
She ' s extremely sorry to lose you , Mr <NAME> , but a sense of her duty to society reconciles her .
He asked me if I felt sure that I was as well as in the morning ?
Now let us walk the other way .
'What of the house , my man ; eh ? '
" Peace , my friends , " says <NAME> , rising and wiping the oily exudations from his reverend visage .
' I tell you , ' returned <NAME> boldly , ' that I don ' t know .
The man , after looking at me for a moment , turned me upside down , and emptied my pockets .
Thereupon all the young ladies rose and began shaking their skirts out behind .
' That was our light porter at the <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' who brought you the message to-night .
' But it can ' t be helped , I ' ve done my duty , <NAME> , I have indeed .
' You will doubtless be surprised , my dear <NAME> , to receive this communication .
He sought to raise himself a little .
Would you not ? " " Truly , madame , I think so .
These are the weapons of <NAME> .
<NAME> was so near her when they shook hands , that he could see a small tiny tear , yet trembling on an eyelash .
So that 's disposed of , and we will talk of something else . "
But just as my first impulse had been to pity her , so was his .
' I am afraid , <NAME> , that his feelings have made him so indeed , ' said Mrs. Weller mournfully .
' I thought so , ' he observed .
He was pitched out of his gig once , and knocked , head first , against a milestone .
' This is not all the good-fortune .
Come both of you ! ' ' Come , <NAME> , ' said the little man .
' Thank you , my lord , ' said Mr <NAME> ; ' thank you .
This is the offer you mentioned , sir ? ' ' Yes .
' Mr <NAME> , ' said Mr Dombey , ' will you take the bottom of the table , if you please ?
The carriage turned about , and drove on at its former speed .
He charged himself even with restraining <NAME> from improving his opportunity .
' So misplaced , ' <NAME> went on , ' that I feel constantly apologetic towards him .
' <NAME> , madam ? ' ' And the dismal evening , and -- and everything , ' said <NAME> .
' " <NAME> were hid under the cushions and covers of the chairs " ' ; ( Here Mr <NAME> looked under himself on the settle . )
He observed the look and said , ' To my mother , of course .
' It ' s been chasing me all my life , but it shall never take me nor mine alive ! ' cried old Betty .
And you are in mourning too !
A short pause followed these consolatory remarks of <NAME> .
It is not dark enough yet .
I would have a settlement out of somebody , by fair means or by foul .
' The most extraordinary thing in the world , ' said <NAME> , saluting both ladies with the utmost cordiality ; ' the most extraordinary thing .
' Are you always as busy as you are now ? ' ' Busier .
how , is , my , lit , tle , friend ? ' over and over and over again .
I saw the lots shortly afterwards in Kimber ' s lodgings—through the window—and I easily made out that there had been a sneaking pretence of lending them till better times .
' Keep quiet , do , ' said <NAME> , ' there never vos such a old picter-card born .
I can ' t say. ' ' As you supposed he was at home , it would seem that he has just gone out ?
As I rode back in the lonely night , the wind going by me like a restless memory , I thought of this , and feared she was not happy .
He will be no worse off than he was , you know .
' Who sent it me ? ' ' Why , your friend , ' replied the man .
On our arrival in <NAME> , we had called with <NAME> at Mrs. <NAME> 's but had not been so fortunate as to find her at home .
' Now , don ' t allow yourself to be fatigued beyond your powers ; there ' s a amiable bein ' .
' I am , ' said the girl earnestly .
' You can if you like .
The whole party arrived in safety at the Bush before <NAME> had recovered his breath .
What he supposed , for example , <NAME> would do , if he and <NAME> ever should encounter ?
<NAME> <NAME> might have asked with <NAME> ' into my grave ? ' so chill and earthy was the place .
Why , <NAME> ' r <NAME> , you was but the heighth of the littlest of these , when I first see you !
' Not at all , <NAME> , not at all , ' returned the other haughtily .
' Hurrah ! ' And then there was another roaring , like that of a whole menagerie when the elephant has rung the bell for the cold meat .
I heard the clocks strike twelve , and was still reading , without knowing what I read , when <NAME> touched me .
No man removed his hand from it now .
Yet she could not help returning ; and her work would soon fall unheeded from her hands again .
When he is most proud and happy in her and her children , he will be most repentant of his own part in the dark vision of our married life .
And why on the sly ?
' I do n't know ; I really do n't know , ' said <NAME> , with a rueful countenance .
' Of course ; that was to be expected .
My dear , for the moment -- true .
please ! ' cried <NAME> , with a kiss , ' don ' t be a naughty <NAME> !
" I wish , sir , " said <NAME> , " to leave a good name behind me .
We think we have hinted elsewhere , that <NAME> had a way of becoming sentimental after brandy .
There have been a meeting to-night where he have been spoken of in the same shameful way .
I haven ' t seen her for this many a week. ' ' How ' s that ? ' asked <NAME> .
One other quotation from the same Preface may serve to introduce a fact that my readers may think curious .
_I_ do n't want to intrude upon your secrets . '
' Why should you ? ' It was impossible to say to that sweet little surprised face , otherwise than lightly and playfully , that we must work to live .
Perhaps we had better go to your place of residence .
' My darling girl , ' she began again .
Which contains a brief Account of the <NAME> of the Action of <NAME> against Pickwick 27 .
' Wish you good-night , <NAME> , ' said Mrs. Craddock .
The old man , looking up at the cages after another look at us , went through the list .
' Very good , ' said <NAME> , looking about : ' ve -- ry good .
said I. I always sat down on the other side of him .
How did you find me ?
Yes. ' ' He was a good ' un , ' said Mr Boffin , ' and he had a sister worthy of him .
I was thinking <NAME> seemed out of sorts. ' ' Me ! ' cried <NAME> , biting her lips , and trembling with very jealousy .
<NAME> , as pat as need be. ' Newman reflected for a few seconds , and then hurried away , muttering that he would be back directly .
I advised you to ; but no , it ' s not your way to take advice .
I then proceeded to the object of my visit .
' Overtake him ; bring him back instantly !
" Guppy , " says <NAME> , " I will not deny it .
Which the playacting have likeways brought him to <NAME> along with me .
' Well , <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> , thrusting his head out of the window .
<NAME> , indeed ! ' cried <NAME> , bridling up .
The houses have no owners ; they are broken open , and entered upon by those who have the courage ; and there they live , and there they die .
' You want some one ? ' said the lady in a stern manner .
If the fire will burn ( it _will_ sometimes ) we are pretty cheerful .
We shall have plenty of time. ' ' Capital ! ' said <NAME> .
Mr Clennam is a very gentlemanly man -- very gentlemanly .
' There never was a happier one ! ' I exclaimed , laying down the carving-knife and fork .
It was not like sleep -- and yet it must have been , or why those pleasant dreams of the little scholar all night long !
I did not set this down as a discovery , rashly .
The face of each child , as the amount of his contribution was mentioned , darkened in a peculiarly vindictive manner , but his was by far the worst .
said the elder , when I went in .
What say you , my dear sir ?
Some people maintains that an Englishman ' s house is his castle .
' Will you never be a <NAME> , my dear child ! ' said <NAME> , with pathetic reproachfulness .
I knew how quick she always was to divine the truth , and that she would never be the first to breathe his name .
' Well , <NAME> , what have you got to say to me ? ' <NAME> remained silent .
It 's only a question between the larger sum and the smaller .
<NAME> , " said <NAME> , " after being all of a heap for half an hour , struck out a plan .
<NAME> <NAME> 's words were , that she would live to bless us all for many years to come .
" Skin the stockings off <NAME> , " said the owner of that property , " or you 'll bust 'em .
" 'To promote the conversation , ' as a joker might say .
I said it certainly was not business that I came upon , but it was not quite a pleasant matter .
' And pray , what did you mean by that , sir ? ' demanded <NAME> , turning angrily on his assistant .
" What do you want , sir ? "
He ca n't be expected to know much of such a labyrinth . "
' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , after thoughtfully pausing in her work .
I hate it. ' ' Hate it , <NAME> ? ' ( <NAME> bewildered . )

His family is as old as the hills , and infinitely more respectable .

' Oh , you do , do you ? ' sneered <NAME> .
' He hadn ' t got his card in his pocket. ' ' I object to the introduction o ' politics , ' said the mottled-faced gentleman .

<NAME> didn ' t know : already having everything she wanted , she couldn ' t say .
You know that I came to you , extremely apprehensive , on my dear boy ' s behalf , of his mad violence .
' Thank you , ' stammered Mr Sparkler , ' she ' s uncommonly well -- at least , poorly. ' ' In <NAME> ? ' said <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> was extremely glad to see me , but a little confused too .
' For this gentleman ? ' said Mrs. Crupp , feeling in her pocket for her keys .
He softly reclosed the door .

My moral influence with them lads , ' added <NAME> , with deeper gravity , ' is a tottering to its basis .
I wish to prove to <NAME> that I can rise to a heighth of which perhaps she hardly thought me capable .
" Yours is a long life to look back upon , sir ? " said <NAME> , wistfully .
And I can always like you now , and your sister will not tease or trifle with you .
<NAME> to atone for his past neglect without another hour ' s delay , he straightway walked upstairs to <NAME> , and requested leave of absence for this laudable purpose .

<NAME> <NAME> ' s half sorry he advised you now .
To the <NAME> , therefore , I directed my steps .
perhaps <NAME> first , ' I admitted , with a blush .

That ' s all over long ago .
The confined room , strong of parchment-grease , is warehouse , counting-house , and copying-office .

So hurrah for the <NAME> , <NAME> !
As they passed where he sat , <NAME> looked so wistfully at the little turn-out , that the old gentleman looked at him .
<NAME> fell upon the ground but a few particles of froth , which slowly detached themselves from the rim , and trickled lazily down .
After a time she arose , and with feeble and tottering steps ascended the street .
So the girl eyed him .
I turn my head , and see it , in its beautiful serenity , beside me .

There was a terror in every ash that dropped out of the fire .
I want you to burn something for me. ' ' What ? ' ' Only this folded paper .
I have a great respect for <NAME> , and no one in whom he is interested can be an object of indifference to me . "
My anger was roused in behalf of an absent , friendless stranger .
<NAME> ' t let her come here , <NAME> ! ' which was a corruption of <NAME> .
On the grounds that it ' s well understood along the cause ' ays and the stairs that he done it .
' Take care of the last step , <NAME> .
I found , now I had leisure to count them , that there were no fewer than six little <NAME> present , in various stages of tumbling up .
To divert his thoughts from this melancholy subject , I informed <NAME> that I relied upon him for a bowl of punch , and led him to the lemons .
Is he ready to go ?
'Pretty well , thank you , sir ' replied Oliver , with considerable hesitation .
The poor child clings to her for awhile , as she clings to him , and then , when the old man calls , he says " I must go !
' Former pastrycook and Muffin-maker , much respected ; ' introducing gravestone .
For I did love him once .
In a very few minutes the waiter came in to announce that <NAME> had arrived from <NAME> , and would be happy to see the gentleman from <NAME> 's .
Some purpose , strong enough to fill up any pause , possessed her .
' The only name I could possibly care to know , to-night. ' ' Sissy Jupe. ' ' Pardon my curiosity at parting .
He had loved <NAME> from the hour of his danger .
So I shall have time gradually to make her familiar with my hopes , as opportunities offer .
' I heard of no one having died. ' ' She lived in another hamlet , my dear , ' returned the sexton .
Are you there , my friend ?
Monsieur the <NAME> ran his eyes over them all , as if they had been mere rats come out of their holes .
My uncle , gentlemen , ' said the bagman , ' was one of the merriest , pleasantest , cleverest fellows , that ever lived .
' I heard from <NAME> , ' said the Patriarch with his benevolent smile , ' that she was coming to call , coming to call .
said the <NAME> , stopping short when there had been a long silence ; and addressing <NAME> .
" So you gave him notice ? "
<NAME> , you have addressed some remarks to me. ' <NAME> turned round , bent his head meekly , and smiled .
Such a marriage would irretrievably blight my son ' s career , and ruin his prospects .
" This is a day , " said <NAME> , gaily taking a little claret in a tumbler , " that will ever be remembered here .
I didn ' t know what to make of it , till this gentleman favoured us with his first visit .
He is among us ! " " Among us ! " from the universal throat again .
Then she would flit along the yard , climb the scores of stairs that led to her room , and take her seat at the window .
<NAME> <NAME> presented her , and his lordship begged her to sit down near him .
You told me you had a proposal ; what is it ?
' I ' ll tell you how I did it , ' said the delighted <NAME> , putting his hair into a condition as elevated as himself .
I mean <NAME> ! ' My heart quite died within me .
You are wet , and you look weary .
<NAME> is pounds , shillings , and pence .
Within a few minutes of our stopping , not before , I saw two great white clouds rising up slowly and majestically from the depths of the earth .
The tall man was standing in the snug little bar , with his hands behind him , quite at home .
This unlucky morning , of all mornings in the year , was the morning next after Mr <NAME> ' s interview with <NAME> in her little carriage .
But when I stole a glance at her and saw her so composed and distant and unapproachable , I felt this to be a foolish weakness .
' What _can_ he mean by this ? ' said <NAME> , when the horse had executed this manoeuvre for the twentieth time .
It ' s enough for me to see how loving you and your husband are .
' I have stood before him face to face , and he crushed me down in the dirt of his contempt , and walked over me .
<NAME> is uncommonly fond of you , Trot. ' ' There is nothing she would leave undone to prove it , ' said I .
<NAME> macaroons , glittering liqueurs , magically-preserved tropical spices , and jellies of celestial tropical fruits , displayed themselves profusely at an instant ' s notice .
So here I am , a poor devil of an artist. ' <NAME> was beginning , ' But on the other hand -- ' when <NAME> took him up .
' I thought perhaps you wouldn ' t mind , in this fine weather , coming home by water , <NAME> .
Keep me always at it , and I ' ll keep you always at it , you keep somebody else always at it .
From the exterior of <NAME> 's Shooting Gallery , and the long entry , and the bare perspective beyond it , <NAME> augurs well .
Staggering as if struck by lightning , he lost his balance and tumbled over the parapet .
She was much given to tying up her head in a pocket-handkerchief , knotted under the chin .
Shutting his eyes and rolling .
The Augurs of the <NAME> invariably predict that when <NAME> and that finger are in much conference , a terrible avenger will be heard of before long .
Although <NAME> had roused himself from sleep , he was not thoroughly awake .
But this little death has made me ask myself the question , seriously , whether I wasn ' t too bent upon pleasing myself .
' I shall do you a mischief ! '
" Pass that torch slowly along these walls , that I may see them , " said <NAME> to the turnkey .
' <NAME> ! ' cried <NAME> , ' at <NAME> !

She is engaged to be married to a most worthy and deserving man in her own station of life .

From my point of view , he was the wrong twin all the time , and only externally like the <NAME> of <NAME> .
The eyes were there , before he had laid himself along .
The wound was a sword-thrust , received from twenty to twenty-four hours before , but no skill could have saved him if it had been looked to without delay .
replied <NAME> eagerly ; 'but I was thinking that I am ungrateful now . '
<NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' what is the matter , <NAME> ? ' ' Never mind , <NAME> ! ' replied <NAME> , with haughty defiance .
' It has come back upon me to-day , it has all come back since we have been sitting here .
' Let us speak for ourselves , sir .
For the face , it expressed nothing but violent and evil passions .
' Nothing , I suppose ? ' said <NAME> , with a diabolical grin .
But , next come the <NAME> , and Mr Perch ; and Mr Perch brings <NAME> to talk it over in the kitchen , and to spend a pleasant evening .
<NAME> ' t you pity <NAME> , and I won ' t pity <NAME> .
As she glanced down into the yard , she saw <NAME> come in and leer up with the corner of his eye as he went by .
' I wrote him a note , I said it was a painful thing .
The kind of foreign help which people usually seek for their children , I can afford to despise ; being above it , I hope .
I think the reply was , " Cut away , then ! "
She shall be rich -- noble ! ' <NAME> took out his pocket-handkerchief , and wiped his eyes .
Light mists arise , and the dew falls , and all the sweet scents in the garden are heavy in the air .
' She is in <NAME> , with all her family , <NAME> , ' he said , when the dreaded lady was occupied again .
I have very strong reasons indeed , for entertaining that wish .
Of course it ' s an exertion , but still , when I know how much depends upon me in this house , I am obliged to make it .
' Is the <NAME> in his room , <NAME> ? ' inquired <NAME> , offering his box with all imaginable courtesy .
'This is a painful task , ' said he , 'but these declarations , which have been signed in <NAME> before many gentlemen , must be in substance repeated here .
Her father was a country gentleman down in your part of the world , and was a brewer .
Before breakfast in the morning , <NAME> walked out to look about him .
And I might have a nice little bit of hot roast meat spoiling at home all this time -- how does HE know I haven ' t ?
But I could make nothing of the word .
' My dear <NAME> , I am here. ' ' How long is this to last , <NAME> ? ' <NAME> shook his head .
He seemed to be the only restless thing , except the clocks , in the whole motionless house .
' I prefer to remain at home .
I denounce them to <NAME> and to earth. " A terrible sound arose when the reading of this document was done .
I see Her with a child upon her bosom , who bears my name .
' Where might it be deposited at present ? ' asked Mr Boffin , in a wheedling tone .
The dawn coming , the morning coming , and the day coming , and neither message nor letter coming with either , he went down to the country house .
She had no fear that she would live through another night .
Then came the question , which of the two next doors ?
'You must compose yourself , ' said the doctor supporting her .
The newly married pair , on their arrival in <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , were received by the Chief <NAME> .
' Nonsense ! ' cried <NAME> -- somewhat resentful of the idea .
' <NAME> said , my lad , ' observed the <NAME> , nodding his head thoughtfully ; ' and true .
He laughed as he retired with the bird -- it was a plump one .
I am not , as I hope you are aware , a governess -- ' ' O dear no ! ' said Mr Dorrit .
My husband , fellow-citizen , is a good <NAME> and a bold man ; he has deserved well of the <NAME> , and possesses its confidence .
One thousand , four hundred and seventy-five pounds , four shillings , and threepence , tomorrow at twelve o ' clock .
' I have not been here a week tomorrow , without considering that too , my dear , ' she returned .
" Such things may be , " repeats <NAME> , " or they may not be .
' This , however , ' said Mr Toots , ' is not the point .
' I ' ll try , ' said <NAME> , ' if you ' ll help me away .
' You have reminded me , <NAME> , that this conversation was private -- private and confidential , gentlemen .
Where is <NAME> ? " " Here he is , " said the <NAME> , entering the dark room at the moment .
But I did both , and made them happy .
' At any rate I ' m going .
If you only repose half as much confidence in me as I repose in you after what I 've experienced of you , that 'll do .
' Not by no means , ' acquiesced <NAME> , affably but magisterially .
Do you see THIS ? ' cried <NAME> , sitting up , and pointing to his prostrate lady , who was holding him very tight round the waist .
N. F. was some tender , lovely , fascinating fair-creature , I make no doubt , ' observed Mr Blandois , as he snapped on the case again .
When I think of my past follies , and my present state , I am sure it would be best for you .
He didn ' t happen to take that particular five-pound note , but I have not the smallest doubt that he ' s always up to something of that sort .
Only a miser ; that 's all . '
' She has actually passed me without the slightest acknowledgment of my presence ! ' The young lady turned and curtsied .

Indeed , so much affection for him had been added in this one evening to my gratitude that I hoped I already began to understand him through that mingled feeling .
I am in statu quo. ' ' And Mrs. Micawber ? ' I pursued .
The latter faithful appendage is also invariably a part of the old girl 's presence out of doors .
How can I think so , looking back on such a trifling wasted youth as mine !
This dangerous ground in his steeple-chase towards manhood passed , he still found it very rough riding , and was grievously beset by all the obstacles in his course .
But I was softened by the softened aspect of the man , and felt a touch of reproach .
Is there so much hurry in this going away , that <NAME> , with a wave of her hand , sweeps on , and is gone !
He saw a strength within her that was resistless .
How long I have been wearing out , I do n't know ; I seemed to break down in an hour .
What queer bills are to be bought , and at what prices ?
I tell you , cruelly , <NAME> .
asked <NAME> of the gentleman whom we had found in attendance on her .
' Placed me in such an extremely awkward situation , ' continued <NAME> .
But we held our own without any appearance of molestation .
said the stranger , thrown off his guard ; and plainly showing that all his fears ( whatever they were ) were aroused afresh by the intelligence .

<NAME> , that I express no opinion , one way or other , on the trust I undertake .

And why does Mr Carker , passing through the people to the hall-door , think of the old woman who called to him in the Grove that morning ?

And how dare you encourage him , you insolent minx ?
' The hag is out , on some preparation for your wedding festivities , I suppose , ' said <NAME> , preparing to depart .
He laughed heartily and answered , " No . "
Do you believe what I am saying ? ' ' I fear I must .
" And as to <NAME> , " resumes <NAME> .
' I am very happy to receive such support in my opinion , sir , ' he rejoined .
' You are mad , ' said <NAME> .
' That ' s capital ! ' he whispered , giving <NAME> such a hug that it squeezed a new expression into his face .
" <NAME> , " said <NAME> with a rough sort of salutation , " you bear your wrongs more quietly than I can bear mine .
" Me , " said the boy , " and <NAME> , " patting the limp bonnet of the child he was nursing .
It seems to require much mixing and compounding .
' So I think , <NAME> , when they come to me .
<NAME> , sir ! ' ' Well , ma ' am ? ' retorted <NAME> .

Judged by mere worldly considerations and probabilities , his story is a very doubtful one . '
' I do nothing but beg and pray you to be comforted and overlook it .
' Or abroad. ' ' Surely , ' the <NAME> answered .
We all went to church , and <NAME> gave her away .
I suppose nobody ever was in such a state of ink .

She looked away at the river , as she walked with her hands folded before her ; and that was all he could make of her without showing his face .
' I say again , I don ' t know what man he is .
" Just as good as saw it , " he returned .
" Do n't you expect to see him ? " said I .
" My little woman , why do you look at me in that way ?
It was tremendous. ' ' I always suffer for these triumphs afterwards , ' said Mrs. Wititterly .
It would n't put you out ? " I expressed the readiness I felt , and we went into the castle .
<NAME> , for this poor place she showed an increasing love ; and to sit in it alone became her favourite rest .
<NAME> <NAME> hopes he will have the goodness to -- " I tell you , sergeant , I have nothing to say to you .
I say , how the <NAME> would bother 'em would n't he ? '
As they struck the bargain , <NAME> surveyed him with a painful interest .
<NAME> <NAME> describes over and over again .
' The dead letters , of course , ' said the bagman .
' <NAME> , aye ? ' ' No , ' said <NAME> , before I could reply .
Why not , Mr Carker ? ' said the boy .
He always concluded by addressing <NAME> .
There are three there , <NAME> , with a jolly large blue unicorn and gold pitchfork on 'em : which is the old lady 's arms . '
Mrs. Rouncewell 's hands unquiet , as usual , on this reference .
' May I beg your pardon again , if I inquire what you mean , sir ? ' said <NAME> .
He was fatter than ever .
If you make a fool of me again , I 'll soon cure you , I warrant you ! '
He was so very solicitous on this head that <NAME> gave him the strongest assurances that he did him no injustice .
" <NAME> ' t trouble yourself about the warming-pan. " The warming-pan !
<NAME> for deeper and heavier sorrow was yet to come .
No news came of old <NAME> .
I have not been advised with myself .
cries Judy with a stamp upon the ground .
' And the world shall deal by you as it does by me , till one or both of us shall quit it for a better .
' Why , that leaves you fifty , ' retorted <NAME> .
' We are all so -- so happy now , my dear <NAME> ! ' says <NAME> , with a suspicious catching in her breath .
' That was before you began to lose your recollection , you know , ' said <NAME> quietly .
' How does she look now ? ' ' Quite happy , ' said <NAME> .
It ' s a triumph , too , to tear her away from a gallant young rival : a great triumph for an old man !
Die who would , it would still remain the same ; these sights and sounds would still go on , as happily as ever .
<NAME> came home , and I soon had no doubt at all . "
Mr <NAME> was even graver than it was his custom to be , and quite silent .
He writes to this purpose on his slate , and Mrs. Rouncewell with a heavy heart obeys .
The cottage is not what it was .
You might have chanced to hear of your <NAME> on his bier , but for the friend I sent to fetch you .
* * * * * That same afternoon , the massive gray square tower of an old Cathedral rises before the sight of a jaded traveller .
" But in that he was influenced by passion , not by reason .
It was evident that very grave and eventful proceedings were on foot ; but various surmises were afloat , respecting their precise character .
He looked up with a surly nod when his visitor came in .
Whatever prejudiced and unauthorised constructions your blind and envious wrath may put upon his character , it is a frank , good-natured character .
' A telling move with a good many , I dare say , but it won ' t put ME off my guard .
I was proud of his interest : deeply , fondly , gratefully attached to him .
Wheresoever the strong tide met with an impediment , his gaze paused for an instant .
" You may -- the memory of what is past half makes me hope you will -- have pain in this .
' My boy has been preserved and thrives , ' says old <NAME> , rubbing his hands .
I faltered , " I do n't know. " " Might a mere warmint ask whose property ? " said he .
What more can I say for you than that I know you deserve her !
The evening grew more dull every moment , and a melancholy wind sounded through the deserted fields , like a distant giant whistling for his house-dog .
' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> ' s friend , closing the room-door , ' here is a young friend of mine whom we must assist .
My impression , certainly , has always been , that there was a mystery in the affair which she could explain if so inclined .
He little suspected with whose money .
In some villages , large painted boards were fixed up : warning all persons who begged within the district , that they would be sent to jail .
<NAME> back as a die .
After a while I recognized the familiar way to <NAME> .
<NAME> pair for a curricle .
This was my homely thought , as I contemplated the box-tree .
' No , no , ' replied <NAME> .
Have you observed any gradual alteration in <NAME> ? ' I had observed it , and had often wondered whether she had too .
Every eye was fixed on <NAME> ' s face .
Mrs <NAME> was affected to tears .
I told <NAME> I would make haste back and inquired of <NAME> as we went in whether there was not a gentleman with <NAME> .
<NAME> knows that better than <NAME> , though she taunts me because she has made me her dependent .
" I ask your pardon , sir , " said <NAME> with a step backward .
' Well , then , come along ! ' said I. I could not help being rather short with him , but he appeared not to mind it .
I see he is going to speak to you . "
Please to carve , <NAME> , for I can ' t. ' This sally ushers in the dinner .
exclaimed <NAME> , in strong indignation .
" Yes , we happened to meet oftener , " he returned .
If I were , or could be , in your place , I should be satisfied of that .
We have never been readers in our family .
My husband died of want ; so many die of want ; so many more will die of want. " " Again , well ?
' My love for my dear child was a diseased love , but my mind was all unhealthy then .
" I am growing more and more unequal to the task I have set myself .
He is truly military , and full of anecdote .
'This purse , ' cried the young lady .
But I will not do that .
Even when the lessons are done , the worst is yet to happen , in the shape of an appalling sum .
' He were ett ' n and drinking—as large and as loud as a Hummobee. ' ' Thank you ! ' said the old woman , with infinite content .
I came all this way to see him in his new clothes. ' ' Ah what a pity ! ' cried <NAME> .
" Because he ai n't well , I think , mother , " adds <NAME> .
Mr <NAME> thought he had passed my young gentleman on the bridge yonder .
' May the present moment , ' said <NAME> , sticking his fork into a large carbuncular potato , ' be the worst of our lives !
As <NAME> moves about to execute this order , it appears that he is lame , though able to move very quickly .
" I am looking about me. " Somehow , that pursuit seemed more in keeping with <NAME> 's <NAME> .
Still , she does not turn her head until she has landed on the other side .
" Yes , with <NAME> on it .
'If it be painful to him , ' she thought , 'to come back here , how painful it will be to me !
<NAME> , not being skilful in such matters , only fanned the flame in attempting to extinguish it .
He said , if that was n't law , he would be glad to know what was .
There is a dog , <NAME> , connected with -- but excuse me .
To think of your poor sister and her Rampages !
Being much flushed and excited , I tumbled my half-guinea out of my pocket in pulling the card out .
'Look down , ' said <NAME> , lowering the lantern into the gulf .
I will carry out your views , sir ; but , under protest. ' Mr Rugg then stated , not without prolixity , the heads of his protest .
When she went to Mr Casby ' s , he was always there .
How do you do , my Lord ? ' ' Veway hot , <NAME> , ' said his Lordship .
That was the thing he had set his heart upon .
This made him almost grave .
' Hollo ! ' said <NAME> , ' I ought to know that ' ere head and them features ; the eyeglass , too , and the broad-brimmed tile !
But that she ever thought of it , or watched it , was a secret which she kept within her own young breast .
' There ' s something wrong ! ' ' How do you know it ? ' demanded <NAME> .
I have been away nearly eight years .
' I 'll tell you what it is , gentlemen , ' said he , 'we 're all afraid . '
<NAME> in company , gentlemen , in God ' s name .
' It hurts me so , ' cried the poor body , ' to see him come back alone .
I am tired to death of the matter . "
Once more she caught her arm , and covered her eyes with it ; and then was gone .
said a man , bursting out of a beer-shop , with a white dog at his heels ; 'young Oliver !
The strange boy whistled ; and put his arms into his pockets , as far as the big coat-sleeves would let them go .
" We went our several ways , " said <NAME> , " and had little in common even before we agreed to differ .
<NAME> is so shy as she gives it to him that they drop it between them and almost knock their foreheads together as they pick it up .
' I am afraid we must live expensively for the first week , ' returned <NAME> , with a groan , ' and then we must make up for it .
Once out of it , there ' s no knowing when we may come back to it .
<NAME> , in the form of odds and ends of cold cream and pomatum , and also of hairpins , was freely distributed among the attendants .
' Doctors were called in -- great men who rolled up to my door in easy carriages , with fine horses and gaudy servants .
<NAME> is the path across the fields , leading to the old house where I was a little child !
For the reasons I have mentioned I would select you .
But , now that I remember , one of you has already been there , and can show the way .
If you 're not tired , <NAME> -- though I know it 's tiring to strangers -- will you tip him one more ?
' You ' ll soon get the better of it , dear , ' rejoined the friend .
' Why , then , I ' ll tell you one , ' said <NAME> , throwing his pipe into the fire , and raising his voice .
As to a stocking , I didn ' t know such a thing by name .
Everybody else quickly vanishes too .
There is inquiry on foot , and pursuit .
Mr and <NAME> , sitting side by side , with <NAME> withdrawn to an immeasurable distance , fell to discussing how they could best find their orphan .
Hosts of stars are visible to-night , though their brilliancy is eclipsed by the splendour of the moon .
Sometimes he stopped at the fire-place , and sometimes at the door , making believe that he was staring with all his might into shop-windows .
I doen ' t care , bless you !
I was smoking , and trying to suppress a rising tendency to shudder .
The moment my aunt was restored , she flew at <NAME> , and calling her a silly old creature , hugged her with all her might .
She takes a chair , looking straight at him as on the last occasion .
' A very singular young man that , ' said the powdered-headed footman , looking after <NAME> , with a countenance which clearly showed he could make nothing of him .
Blowed if I shouldn ' t have left out lakes , never having clapped eyes upon one , to my knowledge .
'Do n't believe that , ' said <NAME> .
He said , perhaps , the best thing in the way of amends that could be said .
What more could I hope to do by prolonging the interview ?
Suddenly I came upon a pasteboard placard , beautifully written , which was lying on the desk , and bore these words : ' <NAME> CARE OF HIM .
The idea of being a kind of a widow , and never having been married !
Oh , my friends and fellow-countrymen , the slaves of an iron-handed and a grinding despotism !
He smiled as the mother retired down stairs ; but his face fell , as the daughter followed .
No songs of birds were in the air , no pleasant scents , no moving lights and shadows from swift passing clouds .
Then he drew his feet together , and made a low , grave bow , and then put out his left hand .
In these matrimonial dialogues they never addressed each other , but always some invisible presence that appeared to take a station about midway between them .
' Wait outside a few minutes , <NAME> , will you ? ' said <NAME> .
" What is the matter with you now ? "
A little owl could stare .
<NAME> <NAME> , very apoplectic , still exhibits his deportment about town , still enjoys himself in the old manner , is still believed in in the old way .
Grandfather Smallweed inquires of <NAME> , <NAME> 's twin sister .
In the midst of her incoherence , she stops , looks at her daughter , cries out that her wits are going , and hides her face upon the bed .
I have a child who will soon call <NAME> by the name by which I call you .
' Did you ? ' <NAME> retorted .
No sense reported anything unusual there .
There they had been waiting for her , many and many a night , no doubt .
However , I told him I was T. Copperfield , <NAME> , and he believed it , and gave me the letter , which he said required an answer .
' It ' s the fine arts that bring me out of bed , <NAME> , ' returned the lady .
The breakfast ended in a perfect understanding .
How the time wears , I know not ; until I am recalled by my child-wife ' s old companion .
and he won ' t come in. ' ' Who ? ' cried Mr Dombey .
' Just keep your eye upon him for a few minutes , ' murmured <NAME> .
' I was a regular cunning sneak when I was at school .
Nearly two thousand pounds profit from him already though .
<NAME> ; isn ' t it ? ' ' Very , ' said <NAME> .
You will always be my solace and resource , as you have always been .
But according to my count , it 's ten times ten -- it 's a hundred o'clock .
' Well ; but I was speaking ironically , ' rejoined <NAME> .
interposed the nurse , hastily depositing in her pocket a green glass bottle , the contents of which she had been tasting in a corner with evident satisfaction .
' <NAME> , stay , ' said <NAME> .
And again , for anything I knew , the proffered information might have some important bearing on the flight itself .
' It is , ' replied the driver , rubbing himself as if he ached , after throwing the reins to the ostler .
On two or three occasions he was employed on business which took him to a distance , and had formerly been transacted by <NAME> .
While she sat weeping , it grew late , and dreary midnight tolled out from the steeples .
' Tell him I am sorry that we ever met. ' ' No more ? ' said <NAME> after a pause .
He always knew where the plump sister was .
<NAME> , if you let her in but once , only to look upon me for one moment as I lie here , I shall die . "
I believe -- at least I know -- that he was not rich .
Still , the average duration of human life is proved to have increased of late years .
If I could be dyed black , and made <NAME> ' s slave , I should consider it a compliment .
With such rich golden hair , such soft blue eyes , and such a bright , innocent , trusting face !
But let him look at me , in prison , and in bonds here .
All the little changes that had crept in when the Heeps were there , were changed again .
" You , is it , <NAME> ? " " It is , <NAME> .
After whom I remember nothing but an average equality of failure .
I shall do well enough , and so will my husband .
He stops in his rubbing and looks at her , with his hands on his knees .
I loved my darling so well that I was more concerned for their effect on her than on any one .
As I passed the steps of the portico , I encountered , at the corner , a woman ' s face .
" Will somebody give me a quart pot ? "
Not they , but they 'll be upon the minds of some of the young fellows , some of these days , and make 'em precious low-spirited .
You don ' t know him half as well as I do , <NAME> .
It was not until even the dusty cloud was no longer to be seen , that the gazers dispersed .
Would you allow me to look at it ?
When she answered fervently , she well knew that , she never forgot it , he touched upon his second and more delicate point -- the suspicion he had formed .
I never saw him afterwards , but I sometimes imagine that I descry a faint reflection of him in <NAME> .
It is that which makes me bold .
' Nobody dead , is there ? ' said <NAME> , alarmed at the horror in <NAME> ' s countenance .
They have all been witnesses of it , from day to day , from night to night , from week to week , from month to month .
' I am acquainted with my faults .
The iron country farther north is , I suppose , the congenial direction for a boy with these tendencies . "
I ' ll have it out of you in full , Boffin. ' ' Dear me ! ' cried that unfortunate gentleman .
That the recollection of your true consideration for her always , can never be forgotten by her .
The captain being gone , we compose ourselves to read , if the place be light enough ; and if not , we doze and talk alternately .
It was constantly before him all at once .
' For what did I say to myself arter having amused myself with that there stretch of a comic idea , as a sort of a playful game ?
' _I_ mean of the foreign man , ' said <NAME> .
My father ( a farmer ) made a will and left his farm and stock and so forth to my mother for her life .
" And she might credit it .
' Are they well ? ' he asked .
But even to get the very doubtful and preliminary stage of making the appeal , seemed one of the least promising of human undertakings .
' I asked him to come. ' ' I am sorry to hear it .
What I said was low ; that 's what it was ; low .
When he has done so , he looks out again at the falling sleet and snow and listens again for the returning steps .
I lay myself open to detection , I know .
asked <NAME> , coaxing him , with her arms round his neck .
said she in reply to my inquiry .
' He works , ' he said , ' as bold as a man can .
' You don ' t show it , ' said <NAME> .
And at the same time there emerged from scores of bye-streets , lanes , and nameless turnings , innumerable people , carrying their dinners to the bakers ' shops .
Here is my little woman ! "
I told him what I had come for .
<NAME> , <NAME> , it would do us no harm to remember oftener than we do , that vices are sometimes only virtues carried to excess !
" I have suspected it a long while -- fully known it a little while . "
Do you hear me say he struck me ? ' ' I hear , I hear , ' replied one of those who held him .
It sickened her , for blows fell heavily and cruelly on the quiet of the night .
Of her father ' s being groundlessly suspected , she felt sure .
Is it fear or is it anger now ?
I stopped at the umble point of my learning , and says I , " Hold hard ! " When you offered to teach me <NAME> , I knew better .
The short-hand writers , the reporters of the court , and the reporters of the newspapers invariably decamp with the rest of the regulars when <NAME> and <NAME> comes on .
has been an effective Something , in the way of preventing me from turning to at <NAME> .
It was , to conceal what had occurred , from those who were going away ; and to dismiss them on their voyage in happy ignorance .
' Is my pa in , do you know ? ' asked <NAME> with dignity .
<NAME> at this in my hand .
" Disgrace never comes to <NAME> , " returns the housekeeper .
She ca n't know anything about me though , ' added <NAME> after a moment 's silence .
'Tell your governor that <NAME> and <NAME> is here , will you ? '
" Now , <NAME> , " he said to me as we walked quickly away .
The <NAME> did not go to bed for a long time .
You have long had a good model before you , in your cousin <NAME> .
Then would he come down to that house with a slap upon the table , and meet the honourable gentleman foot to foot .
<NAME> , give me an old friend ' s arm upstairs ! ' <NAME> hastened to him .
After a few other preliminaries , equally brief , and having settled the road each party should take to avoid suspicion , they separated .
Shortly afterwards , <NAME> appeared , looking lovely , <NAME> thought ; and attired in such a number of skirts that it was quite an excursion to walk round her .
This is not unselfish in me .
The upshot of it all was , that <NAME> was in raptures with him , and that they went upstairs to breakfast .
The old man listened with great attention , and when he had concluded , drew his arm eagerly through his own .
' Your people don ' t usually travel in character , do they ? ' said <NAME> , pointing to the dresses of the dogs .
Where are you bound for ? " " For the <NAME> , I think , " said I .
" I would recommend him to sacrifice it .
She was a spoilt child ; but how could she be otherwise ?
-- always repeating Mrs. <NAME> 's answer to us like an interpreter .
You ' ll begin to take charge at once , of all that ' s going on in the new house , will you ? ' ' Most willingly .
She looked round with an air of incertitude , and advanced towards the stairs .
I hope no bereavement has befallen her .
asks Mrs. Bagnet , stopping in her cheerful talk .
' Yes , and I am afraid I was seldom or never as good as I ought to have been , <NAME> .
' I shall not require the carriage at night , ' said <NAME> .
Fortified by such encouragement , he could venture to say <NAME> ; and now <NAME> ' s mind was relieved .
' I don ' t know , ' replied <NAME> pettishly .
'It 's quite a cruelty , ' said <NAME> .
Here was a new inducement to dissipation , presented to that sport of circumstances , Mr Perch the Messenger !
' I hav ' n ' t got anything to do with the lodgings , ' said <NAME> .
<NAME> , and stream , and meadow , and summer days , shone brightly in her view , and there was no dark tint in all the sparkling picture .
You put it away somewhere , and you kept your own counsel where .
At about mid-day , we set out for the office of <NAME> and <NAME> , in <NAME> ' Commons .
He had charged himself with drink , for the playing out of his game , and was impatient to begin .
My handkerchief wo n't hurt you . "
She came to meet me with a smile of welcome and her hand extended , but seemed to change her mind in a moment and kissed me .
' But you ' re always bragging about something .
The tone of society in <NAME> is one of perfect politeness , courtesy , and good breeding .
Yet , in spite of his early promise , all this vigilance and care could not make little Paul a thriving boy .
In this last respect , servants are the devil .
Suddenly a spasm shoots across her face and she turns deadly pale .
' An _unfortunate affray_ occurred in <NAME> county ( <NAME> .
He did not answer , and was to all appearances asleep .
I must not hear of such a sacrifice .
' A few -- a very few -- will suffice , <NAME> , ' said the young man , drawing his chair towards her .
She has beauty still , and if it be not in its heyday , it is not yet in its autumn .
I believe your intention is to perpetuate , and not to weaken , the ties between me and my other and far dearer self .
' In the course of the week , ' said <NAME> , ' we shall be happy to see <NAME> to tea .
No ; you are strict , you are ; we must wait over twelve o ' clock , and get into Monday .
Let me have a word with you outside . '
One of you gentlemen has a servant called <NAME> ? ' ' Both , ' replied the notary .
I admired and loved him , and his approval was return enough .
' Still , so it was , ' continued Mrs. Micawber .
" _Do_ dozens come for that purpose ? " " <NAME> , " said <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> was in high feather and spirits , but a little nervous withal .
It was a good thought .
' What ' s this ? ' said the single gentleman thrusting out his head .
Those who were appointed of old to go to wicked kings and accuse them -- were they not ministers and servants ?
He drew in his head ; and <NAME> , left standing in the street , could hear the sash closed , as gently and carefully as it had been opened .
They let you off easily enough , " sneered <NAME> .
I had when I first entered on it , and a good man he was .
" I covet nothing , " said <NAME> in the same light way .
How I persuaded myself that this was likely , I do n't know .
You gave me leave , at any time within a year , to renew the subject of our last discourse . '
he cried , upon his knees .
' Dear me ! ' exclaimed the old lady .
A nephew whom they had brought up was a frequent visitor at the house , among many other visitors ; and he began to pay me attention .
After this , they went home .
We don ' t walk like that .
We went on our way upstairs after this episode ; and , as we were going up , we met a gentleman groping his way down .
says the coroner with a melancholy shake of the head .
And why , then , do men tread them ?
To her succeeded another lady , claiming to be a pauper , whose wealth was found wrapped up in little scraps of paper and old rag .
You ' ll be hurt. ' ' Wait one instant , <NAME> .
' Where shall we drive you , sir ? ' said the post-boy .
You know -- dear me , what a very elegant button this is , <NAME> !
And very much indebted for the omen .
' You will not take the air to-day , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
' And that ? ' inquired the dwarf , wheeling round and pointing straight at me .
the other man seemed to answer ; 'could I mistake him , think you ?
Perhaps you will sleep in your own room ?
'What if I did it ! '
This is the third time of your hinting and threatening .
He had been married now a year ; and Mrs. <NAME> had never released him from her determined pity a moment .
That done , she came softly back and stood by the side of my chair .
I urged upon him the necessity of its being dug up , and the paper being legally produced and established .
' Oh , don ' t you think he ' s changed ? ' said Mrs. Heep .
Only four of them passed .
In her own old place sat <NAME> , once more , looking ( but for her dress ) as if she had never left it .
Only one among them , one of the gentlemen belonging to the party of three , made advances towards conversation .
She is considered so ( I have heard ) among the clerks in the <NAME> , and it is a point more in their way than in mine .
' This good king had a queen , who eighteen years before , had had a son , who was called <NAME> .
' <NAME> ' nly not , ' replied <NAME> ; ' what ' s the good o ' flannel veskits to the young niggers abroad ?
<NAME> <NAME> , <NAME> , do n't you say a word nor yet stir .
He awoke to this , and he awoke to more .
' It might have been better for <NAME> to have known some hardships , ' he says , defiantly .
All this time I had never been able to consider my own situation , nor could I do so yet .
Through costly-coloured glass and paper-mended window , through cathedral dome and rotten crevice , it shed its equal ray .
I am not a coward , <NAME> , but to tell you a secret , I am a little afraid of Jack. ' ' No , no !
I say , ' Come in ! ' but someone taps again .
As the time so passed , this slinking business became a more and more precarious one .
He could detect a design upon it when nobody else had any perception of the fact .
Now , your inclinations are to be consulted .
What is the matter ? ' ' <NAME> dare you , ' said the old man , turning round on <NAME> , ' how dare you do it ?
" He never finishes what he begins to say !
The Father of the <NAME> condescended towards his brother as an amiable , well-meaning man ; a private character , who had not arrived at distinction .
'Here his is , coming down the street . '
Now , what have you got to say to me , eh ? ' <NAME> made no reply ; for the little pink pocket-handkerchief was in full force .
I don ' t see why he shouldn ' t be .
said the beadle , raising his hand with a show of authority .
This he knows , and knowing , still offers me his hand .
He cast his despairing eyes downward towards the form from which it had proceeded , and , shuddering from head to foot , looked round .
still going on ; but where !
I made myself known to your sister .
His clothes were shabby , but he had an imposing shirt-collar on .
" Only hear that , <NAME> , " said Mrs. Cratchit .
I told you from the first , <NAME> , that I never give hopes .
Good-night. ' Again he turned towards the wicket , where the satellite , with his eye upon his chief , remained a dumb statue .
" Now that you have come , I think you will do something to help mamma , something to save papa !
I suppose the opening prospect confused me .
' You were always a favourite of hers , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' always were from the first .
The child looked round the room as she took her seat .
The cat remains where they found her , still snarling at the something on the ground before the fire and between the two chairs .
And their assembled friends being not a bit behindhand , roared out lustily .
I have tried hard to think it not worth remembering , but I can not make so little of it .
' There ' s an unfortunate devil , who has got a friend on the poor side , that ' s glad to do anything of that sort .
An exhausted composure , a worn-out placidity , an equanimity of fatigue not to be ruffled by interest or satisfaction , are the trophies of her victory .
She had not a good place , she said ; the wages were low , and the work was hard .
After bidding the old man good night , <NAME> retired to her poor garret , but had scarcely closed the door , when it was gently tapped at .
So stimulated , the business was extremely brisk , and the articles in stock went off with the greatest celerity .
It was nearly nine o ' clock when he reached <NAME> .
Did she send here for you ? ' ' No .
O ye sun , moon , and stars , the great man !
On the grounds that you may take me where you will , and get me sworn to it .
" I am not quite myself , " returns the trooper ; " I have been a little put out , Mrs .
You may do anything with me if you only show me children .
The <NAME> , with an abashed and guilty air , immediately walked on tiptoe to the little parlour and locked himself in .
He is pointing at an empty chair and at a stain upon the ground before it that might be almost covered with a hand .
The round of visits was made ; and <NAME> , with a discreet use of his blue coaching , came off triumphantly , though with a considerable accession of boredom .
' There ' s only one way in which money can be made of it , and that is by taking it to her .
He had just come home .
But the last item was long , long , long , in linking itself to the rest .
They asked me to be industrious and faithful , and I promised to be so .
' Now , boy ! ' said Mr Carker , putting his hand on young <NAME> ' s shoulder , and bringing him out into the middle of the room .
'Come near the fire , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
You to go before me ; you to go alone ; you to go , and I to remain !
' Oh Jeremiah ! ' cried <NAME> , waking .
' A word. ' I confronted <NAME> alone .
The house was no longer theirs .
Did he leave them here ?
' Was there ever such a -- !
We had a beautiful little dinner .
Now I ' ve took the liberty of coming here -- ' Won ' t you sit down ? ' said Mr Carker , smiling .
" Well , " he proceeds , throwing off his disappointment , " next and last , those plans of mine .
" Tony , " he says hurriedly to his astonished companion , " let us be quick in putting the things together and in getting out of this place .
Have you dined with <NAME> yet ? " " Not yet. " " Well , " said <NAME> , " he 'll give you wine , and good wine .
' " But I am not joking ; I was never farther from it , " remonstrated the baron .
' What can <NAME> think when he hears you ? ' ' Oh !
<NAME> <NAME> had made his unavailing expedition to <NAME> in the midst of a great pressure of business .
I won ' t hear of it .
' What is it , <NAME> ? ' <NAME> was the questioner , and put an arm round the poor baby as he made a struggle .
<NAME> <NAME> is my messenger and representative .
Under these circumstances I thought myself well rid of him for a shilling .
Oh , don ' t cry. ' ' I won ' t cry any more , ' said <NAME> .
They made a path through booths and carriages and throngs of people , and never once stopped to look behind .
If they could be brought to me loose , to sort , I should hardly have the face to claim ' em as mine .
Gently <NAME> , gently. ' ' Strange sitivation for one o ' the family , ' observed <NAME> , hoisting the aunt into a chair .
So were his two companions .
They all open <NAME> ' s work .
There 'll he nobody but Ma to thank for it . "
Say what they are. ' ' Mr .
' I am not aware of anything more , ' replied <NAME> .
I speak for myself , let me add , without including you .
Doctors were sent for , and soon came .
' He has got his discharge , by G -- ! ' said the man .
She looked at him now .
He resumed where he had left off .
In the morning she was just the same , <NAME> .
It was not to be .
I couldn ' t learn a Latin Grammar when I was out , every day , with old Glubb .
They were always forgiving me , in their vanity and condescension .
Does he -- do they -- aunt ? ' <NAME> shook her head compassionately .
He is fondest of her and most loving to her , when there is no creature by .
' Mississes , <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> , with an alarming frown .
She made no reply , but still pressed forward .
The spy preserved the same relative distance between them , and followed : with his eye upon her .
' If it had been anyone but you , <NAME> , ' said I , turning away my head , ' I should not have minded it half so much .
A sunburnt , quick , lithe , little man , though rather thickset .
<NAME> <NAME> ' s admiration seemed to increase her perplexity .
Are you quite sure , Mr Rokesmith , that you have never had a disappointment in love ? ' ' Quite sure .
Oh , what shall I do , what shall I do !
Their mode of bestowing the prisoners at night ( which is of general adoption ) differs from ours , and is both simple and effective .
That is , in the long run .
' What an infernal hole this is ! ' said <NAME> , breaking a long pause .
' Perhaps you may not be aware , sir , ' said <NAME> , ' that I intruded upon him when he was over here in <NAME> .
A hard family likeness was on all these things .
' They are so beautiful ! ' said Mrs. <NAME> , sobbing .
At least I know I should be , if you were better acquainted with my character. ' ' Well , <NAME> , ' was the rejoinder .
'Now listen to me , ' said the dying woman aloud , as if making a great effort to revive one latent spark of energy .
I never can , believe me .
' He knows best , ' meaning <NAME> , ' for he has always been at my elbow , whispering me .
After sipping his cognac to the end , he added : " Yes , <NAME> is going to be married .
I saw him stand uncovered in the bitter air , with a reverence for something .
The feeling which beset the child was one of dim uncertain horror .
I comforted her and would have raised her , but she cried no , no ; she wanted to stay there !
I took the child to one kept by a man named <NAME> , and left it there .
' Of his general expectations here , ' assented Mr Carker , dumbly as before .
" Bewitching Mrs. Copperfield " , ' I repeated stoutly .
' " Unless he brings me back a lady , " ' said <NAME> , tracing out that part with his finger .
I was afraid of staying then to speak to either woman , lest I should bring her into trouble .
Who passes by this road so late ?
' Wery desp ' rate ch ' racter , your Wash-up , ' replied <NAME> .
You belong , as it were , to the place , and in a manner represent it towards a stranger .
At first my face was so strange to me that I think I should have put my hands before it and started back but for the encouragement I have mentioned .
That it is a great work to have cut you away from father ' s life , and to have made a new and good beginning .
Not an ill wind , I hope ? ' ' No , ' replied my aunt .
As I have grown older , I think I have had experience of some other houses doing business on the principle of <NAME> and <NAME> !
During this whole time the whelp moved about with <NAME> like his shadow , assisting in all the proceedings .
A fine full-coloured young woman , Mr Clennam , with very dark hair and very dark eyes .
In a very little time <NAME> comes down and tells him that <NAME> will join him directly and place herself under his protection to accompany him where he pleases .
What changes , <NAME> , even in my small world !
" And if you keep it under your skirts like that , who 's to help tumbling ?
In such a case I could show you reasons , I think , which would induce you to yield it . '
The son of my old friend <NAME> , of <NAME> , is a born fool , Sir. ' Here the <NAME> laughed till he was almost black .
cried a loud , hoarse voice , as soon as they set foot in the passage .
' He has never had occasion to acquire such little arts .
'He is not in danger , I hope ? '
said Mrs. Bagnet , continuing to grumble on good-humouredly .
' But whether it is all true , or partly true , or entirely false , I am wholly unable to say .
Little <NAME> came out wonderfully , told various comic stories , and sang a serious song which was almost as funny as the anecdotes .
They are gone , and I resume the journey of my story .
I will not be put down .
There was an anxiety even in her hopefulness that made me doubtful if I had done right in approaching the subject .
The old man and the child dwelt alone together .
<NAME> was pretty sure to be there expecting me , and we went on together through the frosty air and gathering fog towards the twinkling lights of the town .
Upon the <NAME> ' s door-steps one day , <NAME> stood with a fluttering heart , and with his small right hand in his father ' s .
I take it as a compliment .
The lady modestly hesitated to reply , lest there should be any impropriety in holding an interview with <NAME> , with closed doors .
' I have every reason to believe , my dear -- indeed I may say I know , ' returned <NAME> , ' that he is wealthy .
<NAME> , ' said the elder lady , ' this is not a fit conversation for the servants to overhear .
No ; he said confidently , no !
I have n't had the letter more than a quarter of an hour . "
' A kind office , ' said the little gentleman , nodding to <NAME> as she curtseyed to him .
I am very sorry to have done a man wrong , particularly when it can ' t be undone .
Or would it worry you just now ? " " <NAME> me by all means .
Some of the windows had been walled up ; of those that remained , all the lower were rustily barred .
<NAME> in the <NAME> A beautiful landscape , with the corn bright in it , but not abundant .
Old Mr <NAME> was the first to stretch out his hand , and inquire how he felt .
He 's game enough now , I 'll engage .
All this time , my leg and foot were in the air .
I knowed old <NAME> , sir .
<NAME> , to this wretched hour I am ignorant of both .
After half an hour ' s cooling in the churchyard , I saw the chariot coming back .
These institutions were established , no doubt , upon the principle that those who had so large a share in making the laws , would certainly respect them .
<NAME> <NAME> gently pressed her hand to his lips , and sank upon the sofa .
Never shall I forget the repulsive sight that met my eye when I turned round .
Those fellows who were here one night .
' I made mention of no names , and I wish to make mention of no names , ' said <NAME> , with a portentous look .
" Pooh ! " said he , sluicing his face , and speaking through the water-drops ; " it 's nothing , <NAME> .
' I _will_ speak , ' cried the man ; ' I will not be turned out .
Even its comforts were limited to its being dry and warm , and having a snug though faded fireside .
To make them wear iron collars by day and night , and to worry them with dogs , are practices almost too ordinary to deserve mention .
You know <NAME> , the <NAME> , across the lane .
Does that look as if I cared for her ?
He did it , whether or no .
It had only been , as I thought , of less assistance than the horses in getting us on , and it had often aided them .
I was obliged to hurry away ; I was kept out late ; and I felt all night such pangs of remorse as made me miserable .
" There is another point of view , " he continues , " in which the case presents itself .
I will do no more .
' She is a curate ' s daughter , ' said <NAME> ; ' one of ten , down in <NAME> .
Do you hear him ? ' ' I believe you are right , mother , ' replied Alice , in a low voice .
Her manner was more winning than she had cared to let it be to me before , and I thought I saw <NAME> 's influence in the change .
I declare here ' s some one else .
The meek man was afraid we must take it as proved , because there were the Inquests and the <NAME> ' s returns .
Put that clock aboard a ship an ' pack it off to <NAME> , an ' the time will go on just the same .
The suite of rooms on the ground-floor were lighted up , and a military band was playing in the hall .
When they were all drawn back , it was found to be locked , and worst of all , the key was gone .
I remember that I thought it , in form , more like a riding-habit with the superfluous skirt cut off , than anything else .
Where does your sister live ? ' ' Why , she is not settled yet , Mr Headstone .
" Well , sir , " says the trooper , looking into his hat after another disconcerted pause , " I am sorry not to have given you more satisfaction .
Are we never to be permitted to forget ?
He will love and honour you as I will .
And not in the same hand , perhaps ?
" Settled in the law , " said I .
That he is bound to make an effort .
" This , " returned <NAME> , " is as it should be .
She is very much alone .
It was of no avail .
The cat leaped down and ripped at a bundle of rags with her tigerish claws , with a sound that it set my teeth on edge to hear .
' <NAME> tells me , <NAME> , ' he eagerly began on coming in -- but stopped when he saw her face .
He shall not bully me -- he shall not bully me .
To his matter-of-fact home , which was called <NAME> , <NAME> directed his steps .
' What came of that , I needn ' t say .
It warn ' t much -- execution for nine pound nothin ' , multiplied by five for costs ; but hows ' ever here he stopped for seventeen year .
The father is like his own father , a weak wretched trembling creature , falling to pieces , never sober .
You may stare and shiver .
' She looks upon me as mere child , sir .
" Disappointed , miss , " said <NAME> , peeping through the curtain .
Mr <NAME> had uncovered on looking in at the door , and remained so .
" Now we 're all right again .
" Orlick there ? " " Ah ! " he answered , slouching out .
<NAME> opinion has knotted the lash , heated the branding-iron , loaded the rifle , and shielded the murderer .
Of course , she has remained here ever since .
Now , take this paper that <NAME> has carried about him .
It was a more difficult task to take leave of the inmates of <NAME> , from whom they had received so much hospitality and kindness .
It was the sign of the regeneration of the human race .
Either of us might be accused of it , you know. " " Only neither of us is , " I remarked .
' Well , but the <NAME> of <NAME> !
After breakfast she took me to her own home , and a beautiful little home it was .
As the words were spoken , they passed through the wall , and stood upon an open country road , with fields on either hand .
' My country rounds , ' she added at length , ' brought me to <NAME> , <NAME> , the night before last .
It is the last bottle of the old Madiera .
After dinner , we went down to the railroad again , and took our seats in the cars for <NAME> .
It was not only a constraint upon the child ' s mind , but even upon the natural grace and freedom of her actions .
<NAME> <NAME> wants to speak to you .
' I decline to name it , sir , ' returned <NAME> , suddenly turning loud and sharp .
" As if it was not a favour to be protected from the lamp-iron ! " " It is always as the good patriot says , " observed the functionary .
<NAME> was the first , and walked by himself smoking .
Her mother died when she was a baby , and her father denied her nothing .
If the question concerned an outfit for <NAME> , <NAME> would know all about it and would be quite excited .
They kept him , many times , from what did him real harm .
'Because of <NAME> 's account of him , the said <NAME> . '
' I wish you ' d show me the palm of your hand , ' said <NAME> .
<NAME> , out of date , withdrawing from attention , able to afford it .
It was as haggard a view of life as a man need look upon .
I ceased to draw back , and we went straight to the best parlour , where she left me .
'It 's a cold ride from <NAME> , ma'am ; and I always find that spirits comes home warmer to the feelings . '
<NAME> <NAME> , sitting in the twilight by the open window , enjoys his wine .
' I suppose so , ' said <NAME> , looking at <NAME> .
Besides ; if you are not filial , sir , if you discard that duty , you are at least -- hum -- not a <NAME> ?
' Open the window , ' said the sick man .
<NAME> looks at him inquiringly , repeating the name .
" I admit it most fully and freely , " said I .
' Ah ! ' Mrs <NAME> curled the little finger of her left hand as who should say , ' I have caught you .
There was a bright moon , but it was behind the clouds .
<NAME> Jobling is buttoned up closer than mere adornment might require .
A great deal of laughter ensued , and Mrs. <NAME> volunteered to humour him , so she took a slight sip out of her glass .
They were immediately admitted into the lodge .
<NAME> <NAME> , don ' t you hear a knock ? ' ' I ' ll answer the door in one moment , <NAME> , ' replied the clerk .
' Not a button , ' said <NAME> .
Two peculiarly blunt knocks or pokes at the door , as if the dead man arriving on his back were striking at it with the soles of his motionless feet .
rejoined <NAME> ; 'that was done by <NAME> , that was . '
Yes , verily , my lords and gentlemen and honourable boards , adapting your Catechism to the occasion , and by <NAME> ' s help so you must .
' Of <NAME> and <NAME> , in the wine trade , ' he replied .
Better far than all the <NAME> put together know him. ' Mrs. Tope ' s care has spread a very neat , clean breakfast ready for her lodger .
This resistance only infuriated <NAME> the more ; who , dropping on his knees , began to assail the animal most furiously .
He rightly judged that , at first at all events , they would go in a contrary direction from their late companion .
And however far off that may be , I will never tire of trying .
' Very , very , <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> , without moving a muscle of his face .
My brother <NAME> , ' said the old man admiringly , ' is fit company for monarchs ; but not so your uncle , my dear .
One of these papers was a letter to this girl <NAME> ; the other a will . '
Yet he said it with so much meaning , too , that I felt he as perfectly understood <NAME> to be my benefactress , as I understood the fact myself .
But by this time , his doubts were all removed .
" <NAME> is the best policy , " is it ?
She and her husband had worked too , and had brought their simple faith and honour clean out of dustheaps .
The lady says what ' s right .
<NAME> Leicester is not aware that any client of <NAME> has been in need of his assistance .
A Shoal of <NAME> 35 .
I am far from sure that I believed there was anything hopeful in it , but my mind was thoroughly made up that it must be carried into execution .
' You , injured by his haughty temper !
How are you gettin ' on , and how is the chandlery bis ' ness likely to do ?
I have been no lover of this lady ' s .
'Not a penny , ' replied the girl , waving her hand .
The very wedding looked dismal as they passed in front of the altar .
Then came the night -- dark , dismal , silent night .
It was for me to smile .
The man who was seated there , was tall and dark , and wore a large cloak .
But we always calls him <NAME> just the same .
She stopped , and reddened again .
<NAME> , I have an inexpressible desire to find service with a young lady who is good , accomplished , beautiful .
May I ask a question , <NAME> , before I go ? " " I think you may take that liberty , " the <NAME> answered , smiling .
With many adieus and good wishes , <NAME> went his way .
She rose too , and he took leave with all humility .
I wanted to be cutting at those trees in the forest of difficulty , under circumstances that should prove my strength .
' Pretty well ! ' echoed <NAME> .
Try easy now. ' He tried easy now ; but the luck resisted ; wouldn ' t come .
' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , laughing boisterously , ' they dean ' t put too much intiv ' em .
But we preserved an unbroken silence .
It was after much consideration of this fact , and much pondering over such an unfortunate combination of circumstances , that a bright idea occurred to the <NAME> .
My child is always dangerous , more or less .
I had never laughed and cried in all my life , I dare say -- not even to her -- more freely than I did that morning .
You are to be a proctor .
But she joined in the forfeits , and loved her love to admiration with all the letters of the alphabet .
The quantity of walking exercise I took , was not in this respect attended with its usual consequence , as the disappointment counteracted the fresh air .
Mr Morfin , as an officer of inferior state , inhabited the room that was nearest to the clerks .
He might as well have been born with a yard and a half of it , and a remnant over . "
' I know he is , ' rejoined <NAME> .
he said , rising and pushing back his chair .
These crawling things had fascinated my attention , and I was watching them from a distance , when <NAME> laid a hand upon my shoulder .
' I don ' t know , ' replied <NAME> , in the same tone .
She does not even know my name. ' ' I ' ll ask it for all that .
Women work hard in these parts .
" Never you mind for me , miss .
I can act with philosophy in such a case as that .
Our new shoes had come home , but we hadn ' t put ' em on .
These have been his relations towards me .
<NAME> on in the night , <NAME> opened his eyes .
Begging your pardon , <NAME> , ' said Mr Perch , hesitating at the door , ' he ' s rough , <NAME> , in appearance. ' ' Never mind .
It has not yet come to my sister ' s knowledge that we have found it out , but we have .
But this put me into such a tremble lest they should detain me there that she soon recalled her words and compromised for a rest of half an hour .
' Of course you like dancing ? ' ' Oh no , I don ' t , ' said <NAME> .
Is there no devil to help me ? ' Swiftly , there glided again into his brain the figure he had raised that night .
But no temperature made the melancholy mad elephants more mad or more sane .
And I know brickmakers go about working at piecework in different places .
" So am I , they tell me . "
What does it matter whether such a blighted life as mine comes to an end , now , next week , or next year ?
<NAME> looked at me a little frightened .
Shall I tell you more ?
It ' s my business to see it .
So many hundred Hands in this <NAME> ; so many hundred horse <NAME> .
' The duty done , and act of reparation performed , which can alone enable me to contemplate my fellow mortal , I shall be known no more .
It was the journey ' s fitting end , and might have been the end of everything ; it was so ruinous and dreary .
They look very , very like that sort of thing .
' <NAME> know , ' said <NAME> .
It remained thus , until the first warning bell began to ring .
I work hard , and read Law insatiably .
" The house is yonder , " <NAME> exclaimed .
There was a faint light in a chamber window not far off , and <NAME> ran towards that house to ask their way .
<NAME> , when he was sufficiently cool , proceeded with his letter .
You see me at my greatest disadvantage .
' What ' s the matter ? ' said the short dark man .
" <NAME> 's your mother ? " " There , sir ! " said I .
In the hunted air of the people there was yet some wild-beast thought of the possibility of turning at bay .
' I hope they are , ' said <NAME> , fixing his eyes upon his friend .
There was one piece of gold among it , and an emergency might come when its worth to them would be increased a hundred fold .
Now , I 'll tell you what I have got for supper , <NAME> .
Here <NAME> bowed grimly to <NAME> , while <NAME> and <NAME> glanced mutual distrust out of the corners of their eyes .
To exclude the cold , one half of this door was fast closed , and the other was opened but a very little way .
He rather congratulated himself on his prudence when the single gentleman , without notice or explanation of any kind , double-locked the door .
Of course you gentlemen hardly failed to observe that he was towing by the neck and arms. ' They had helped to release the rope , and of course not .
It appeared on the whole , to <NAME> herself , that this same society in which they lived , greatly resembled a superior sort of <NAME> .
' Of course I am , ' replied <NAME> haughtily .
Be seated , <NAME> , I beg , <NAME> .
Mr Dombey , Sir. ' <NAME> bowed .
Then is she kind and cruel , stately and unassuming , various , beautifully wilful .
O yeth , to be thure !
Did the honourable <NAME> allude to him ?
said <NAME> , pausing near the door .
She said no more at the time ; but she presently stopped and looked at me again ; and presently again ; and after that , looked frowning and moody .
It is the fate of a lonely old man , that those about him should form new and different attachments and leave him .
" What 's the matter with the cat ? "
And I mean to be paid high , Mr Venus , I promise you. ' ' You speak quite revengefully , Mr Wegg. ' ' Revengefully , sir ?
She was alarmed by an occurrence in the house which might have alarmed a stronger person , and was made ill by the distress and agitation .
That ' s what your daughter wants .
' I ain ' t a man of many words , but I take it very kind of you to be so friendly , and above-board .
" Besides , it 's not as if I was an accomplished girl who had any right to give herself airs , " said <NAME> .
It was a hard parting , though it was not for long .
If it don ' t act well , or don ' t quite accord with our mutual convenience , he can easily go to the right-about .
The word <NAME> , besides , gives a pretty form to the lips .
I am staying at the house of papa ' s agent , <NAME> , in <NAME> , <NAME> .
' Better there than here , ' said a third voice aloud -- <NAME> ' s , though she did not move .
' <NAME> ' t be afeard , mun , ' he said ; ' tak ' eneaf to carry thee whoam .
Let me go my way , all of ye .
Never , since I have been here ! "
What could I do , but kiss away her tears , and tell her how I doted on her , after that !
' I fully understands my instructions , do I , <NAME> ? ' inquired <NAME> .
<NAME> and patience , hope and patience ! ' These words were uttered in too low a tone to reach the ears of the young men .
We must break it to get it through into the cage .
It was ratified only the other day .
I went out of my senses immediately ; became a mere driveller next day , on receipt of a little lace-edged sheet of note-paper , ' Favoured by papa .
' <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> , ' horrible. ' A low tap was heard at the room door .
' Yes , <NAME> , ' she said , when that young lady had concluded .
Her bosom was heaving in a distressful manner that I greatly pitied , but I thought it better not to speak .
Mr Lightwood , here has been a wicked cruel murder .
' Well , good-bye , then , ' said the old gentleman .
You summon no energy and purpose .
' Welcome misery , welcome houselessness , welcome hunger , rags , tempest , and beggary !
" Well , well , my dear , " said <NAME> , " we wo n't go into that now .
But permit me to set you right on one point .
Shall I make any more apologies , <NAME> ? ' ' Not one , ' replied that gentleman .
' <NAME> much so , for our peace , perhaps , my dear , ' returned her mother ; ' but we won ' t complain .
I am always afraid of inconveniencing busy men , being an idle man. ' ' I should not have thought so , from your appearance. ' ' No ?
It was due to the uniform he wore , to demand this explanation .
'We are all weak creeturs , ' said <NAME> .
" I am sorry to say I am . "
There was another long pause .
I think that will cure her , my boy .
There are no ends of ways of leaving here .
More unfortunately still , she had relations .
In regard of the other <NAME> , the nondescript lodged in the same house with herself and uncle .
is there no chord in your heart that I can touch !
Above all the noise we made , I heard them running up the stairs , and crying out -- I heard my mother crying out -- and <NAME> .
' How can you be so thankless to your best friend , <NAME> ?
' Then why DO you wait ? ' said <NAME> .
Call him Trotwood , certainly , ' said <NAME> .
There he found Mr Rugg .
Not only was I soon as well known on the <NAME> as the postmen on that beat , but I pervaded <NAME> likewise .
Look at him ! ' ' Well , I _am_ looking at him , ' said <NAME> .
<NAME> is prettier , thought the good Minor Canon frequently , when taking his seat at table opposite his long-widowed mother .
said the doctor , laying <NAME> gently down again .
I wish I could doubt the evidence of my senses , but their depositions are unimpeachable .
Appealing to <NAME> , would be rather a rum course .
Look sharp with the light , or I shall knock my brains out against something in this confounded hole . '
Do I ? ' ' Yes , ' she answered with a smile .
I merely wish that we should -- ha -- understand each other .
He had been crouching for a spring at the moment when his master caught him .
And if ever in my life I saw a love that nothing but death could change , I saw it then before me .
There might have been much more envy in politer places .
Again , only this morning at breakfast .
This old man wears a hat , a thumbed and napless and yet an obdurate hat , which has never adapted itself to the shape of his poor head .
On purpose to annoy me , for he knows how I doat upon them ! ' A grisly little fiction concerning her lovers is <NAME> ' s point .
" The <NAME> , called <NAME> , " said the first .
' Excuse me , ' said the gentleman hastily .
But he could as easily have changed a clear sky by looking at it in surprise , as affect her .
' A lady ! ' says <NAME> , pluming his ruffled feathers .
<NAME> was the substance of <NAME> ' s discoveries concerning him , made that rainy Sunday afternoon and afterwards .
' I never thought you had told us anything but the truth , ' said <NAME> , soothing him .
By degrees he fell to reposing such great confidence in me , as to ask my advice in reference to his own affairs .
In good time Mr <NAME> ' s mansion was gained again , and again there was a noise of tongues in the library .
<NAME> has made the very houses prematurely old .
" He is not in the way to do so now , my dear , " replied my guardian .
Over all the legal neighbourhood there hangs , like some great veil of rust or gigantic cobweb , the idleness and pensiveness of the long vacation .
'He hung about , not to come over here afore dark , but he 'll be here soon , ' replied <NAME> .
There , snuff and cigars , and <NAME> pipes and flutes , and violins and violoncellos , divide the supremacy between them .
The bewildered butler gazed from them towards <NAME> , and from <NAME> towards <NAME> , with a most ludicrous mixture of fear and perplexity .
" <NAME> , " said I , " you place great confidence in me , but I fear you will not take advice from me ? "
Why do you take and choke a cove who has never done you any harm , neither of you ?
' Not I , indeed , ' returned <NAME> .
' No , <NAME> , ' cried <NAME> , interrupting him , and rubbing his hands in an ecstasy .
He would have clasped the little figure closer , but he saw that the eyes appealed to him not to be moved .
" Only I , " returns the trooper , " but as I know it , do me one more good turn and pull my hat over my eyes . "
Mr <NAME> ' s companion resumed the conversation .
That is not my name .
Still I was forced to wait for a start , and I wasn ' t so lucky as to get a start .
Then , <NAME> sat up and took a long look at his figure , and then cried : ' Hi -- I -- i !
The wood is quite fresh where it gave way .
' Have you a good memory ? ' ' I don ' t know , ' said <NAME> , shaking his head sorrowfully .
'Well , then , ' rejoined <NAME> , ' I would n't .
<NAME> ' t stop to say one word to me , but go .
Completely worked round , haven ' t you ? ' ' Yes , deary , ' said <NAME> , laying aside her shawl .
' Containing a position which I deny , ' interrupted he of the dirty countenance .
' Come , come , <NAME> , ' urged <NAME> , at his side .
after it was given out so ' tickerlerly , that <NAME> wasn ' t to be made free with ! ' exclaimed <NAME> .
May be a humble one !
" Why , indeed , sir , unless it is to cool her down ! "
I stole it in my heart when she first showed it me hanging round her neck ; and the child 's death , perhaps , is on me besides !
He can ' t go too soon .
It ' s no fault of mine .
Each was bowed down and broken .
Her beautiful serene eyes met mine as she came towards me .
He might not be so gently dealt with outside as he is there .
After a few moments ' silence , it had relaxed into its usual weak condition .
sounded all over the <NAME> .
' Is fork , sir , fork , ' replied Mr Swiveller slapping his pocket .
About something relating to <NAME> , he believed .
' Not for the world , ' rejoined <NAME> .
But <NAME> has spared you this , R.W. , whatever it may have thought proper to inflict upon her ! ' Here Mrs <NAME> burst into tears .
He would have raised his hands and besought her for pardon , but she caught them in her own , and put them down , hurriedly .
All further inquiries were superseded by the appearance of old <NAME> , who , running upstairs and just recognising <NAME> , passed at once into <NAME> ' s room .
They were very glad to set the chair down , and give a good round loud double-knock at the street door .
Do you know they would be ruined to pay off my old scores ?
And so shall somebody else too .
I have told you already , so don ' t fly in the face of Providence by attempting to deny it ! ' ' Hush !
He is a cordial young fellow , and we will have him to meet the brother and sister at dinner .
<NAME> <NAME> makes a hurried remark to the effect that they may be doing the deceased a service , that he hopes so .
Whether or no , I wo n't be prayed agin , I tell you .
Even in my father 's time , we did a world of wrong , injuring every human creature who came between us and our pleasure , whatever it was .
' My name is <NAME> , ' said the gentleman .
So the doctor , breathing low , and closely watching , asks himself .
' You have been used to eaves-dropping .
Let us see the state of the case .
That <NAME> bottle was found by my noble benefactor and yours , after he entered on possession of the estate .
" But for <NAME> 's modesty , " said <NAME> , " I would take leave to correct him and say three distinguished men . "
She has an extensive acquaintance at <NAME> among appalling old gentlemen with thin legs and nankeen trousers , and is of high standing in that dreary city .
You have a noble nature , and <NAME> 's love may make you worthier every day . "
inquired <NAME> : anxious to encourage any symptoms of good-humour in the unwelcome visitors .
' Two witnesses to it ; <NAME> knows the nature of an oath , he does ; we shall have you there , sir .
This devil whom you make an angel of .
Mouldering away before our eyes .
But then quickly added , reading <NAME> ' s face : ' No .
They followed the girl up some steep corner-stairs without meeting any one , and stopped in the dark while she went on for a candle .
<NAME> , being present , then named , in furtherance of a suggestion she had previously offered to the <NAME> , <NAME> .
Some say she really is , or was , a party to a suit , but no one knows for certain because no one cares .
' Will you have some of this ? ' said the fat boy , plunging into the pie up to the very ferules of the knife and fork .
Who was it whose least word did what his utmost means could not ?
<NAME> <NAME> glanced with a troubled eye at us and grudgingly nodded assent .
' This happy idea , brave sir , ' <NAME> resumed after drinking , ' was a happy idea for several reasons .
I may find a use for it one day .
At that point , my convict became so frantically exasperated , that he would have rushed upon him but for the interposition of the soldiers .
" Repression is the only lasting philosophy .
We do not appear to understand each other yet .
I have a settled purpose. ' ' And a good one , I hope , ' said <NAME> .
These are the corporate beggars .
Having achieved this feat , he sighed again , and applied himself assiduously to the pie .
It 's as good as another . "
There 's more where that come from .
The discussions ended in our hiring for him , by the month , a neat little furnished lodging in a quiet old house near <NAME> .
How long was I to bear this ?
I have supposed the head to be all-sufficient .
She listened with great attention , and with a face that often changed , but had the same purpose in all its varying expressions .
<NAME> <NAME> relieved his father with dutiful interest , and reported No job in his absence .
<NAME> , ma ' am , work ; we must all work .
But he told me to-night that he wished to do so in the morning. ' ' Ah !
The lady was not young and fresh from the hand of <NAME> , but was young and fresh from the hand of her maid .
" I beg your pardon , miss ! "
Some of the drivers are blacks , some whites .
' Well , <NAME> , how have you got on without me all day ?
His mind would run upon that spot .
' But I am acquainted with these chaps , ' said <NAME> .
' Who ' s that ? ' cried a stout old man , who was putting on a nightcap as if he were going to bed in a vault .
" Yes , <NAME> , " said he with a gentle seriousness , " it is to be forgotten now , to be forgotten for a while .
This paper I part with now .
He recognized the friends the instant they reappeared , but their reappearance had no effect on his composure .
As the sisters reached the porch , he quickened his pace , and called upon them to stop .
It came upon me as the close of the benignant history I had been pursuing , and I felt that I had but one thing to do .
His recent despondency , not to say despair , was gone in a moment .
He held it up , and looked round , everywhere , expecting to see her crouching in some corner ; but the room was empty .
I don ' t know that , ' said <NAME> .
It was a very genteel entertainment , very handsomely served .
In such a very hard manner and with eyes so particularly green that <NAME> 's natural gravity is much deepened by the contemplation of that venerable man .
But she hardly ever spoke -- I question if she ever did -- without making some mention of him .
You know this lady ( for she _is_ a lady ) , Mrs. Sparsit ? ' ' I have already had the honour— ' ' Very well .
I acted on Mrs. Crupp ' s opinion , and gave the order at the pastry-cook ' s myself .
She ' s deep , <NAME> , deep , but <NAME> is deeper .
For example : you couldn ' t for your life be a gentleman ; I couldn ' t for my life be otherwise .
What can you two be together ?
' The question , ' returned <NAME> , with a sort of joyful affability , ' why I didn ' t mention sooner , that I had found something .
Upon which law-writer there was an inquest , and which law-writer was an anonymous character , his name being unknown .
He , self-important , unbending , formal , austere .
Is it unusual , unsophisticated , primitive ? ' ' It ' s delightful indeed , sir , ' replied the lawyer .
And I intend always doing it. ' ' You are a long-headed fellow , Fledgeby. ' ' May be , or may not be .
She ' s far away , she ' s far away !
Proud I am sure to have the honour !
' Tis for that. ' ' Well , well , ' said he .
Is there none in this room ?
He says , no varnish can hide the grain of the wood ; and that the more varnish you put on , the more the grain will express itself .
He was contented , you will say .
So far all goes well with us -- much , much better than it has of late gone with many poor souls .
'Not a bit of it , ' replied <NAME> .
' Finish by telling me how your father left you , <NAME> .
And yet , I was perverse enough to feel a chill and disappointment in receiving no welcome , and rattling , alone and silent , through the misty streets .
'No , ' said <NAME> ; 'to hear you repeat it , if you will -- finally repeat it !
Perhaps her mind had not got quite so far as the ceremony yet , but was lagging on the way there .
You are hasty in thinking that I mean to check you .
It became a part of my life , and as inseparable from my life as my own head .
' How could I help myself ?
You ' re in a fright , and don ' t know what you say or mean .
' I am very little hurt , I assure you. ' ' Then you are not dead ! ' ejaculated the hysterical lady .
Three o ' clock , and half-past three , and they had passed over <NAME> .
' There ' s inconveniency in it , but the novelty gives it a sort of relish , too ! ' <NAME> !
" And she is of so aristocratic a disposition -- " " Yes , ma'am , " I said again , with the same object as before .
It is extraordinary how long a man may look among the crowd without discovering the face of a friend , but it is no less true .
<NAME> stood at <NAME> ' s elbow .
said the nurse , picking up the cork of the green bottle , which had fallen out on the pillow , as she stooped to take up the child .
' You have heard <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , turning to me .
' After all , you haven ' t said what you mean to do yourself , <NAME> .
Some of the neighbours threw up their windows , and called across the street to each other that old <NAME> ' s housekeeper must have dropped down dead .
" Of course you may , cousin <NAME> . "
It did not pass away , as weightier things had done ; but came uppermost again , and yet again , and many times that day , and often afterwards .
He slowly shook the shadow off , and turned to her .
A hard one to me , but it is a necessary one .
Mr Carker then handed him out of the room ; and <NAME> , keeping his round eyes fixed upon his patron to the last , vanished for the time being .
This was one of the consequences of getting into good society .
I had cut the connexion .
Go back again. ' ' No mistake , ' returned <NAME> .
As there is no doubt they were .
Your necessities are greater than mine . "
The blood has not flushed into his face so suddenly and redly for many a long year as when he recognizes <NAME> .
There was none of the noise and clamour of a schoolroom ; none of its boisterous play , or hearty mirth .
" Well , " returns his wife , considering , " <NAME> seems to me to be getting not a little impatient and restless .
This was a very wise resolution , but he was prevented from putting it in practice by a new source of anxiety and uneasiness .
A very well conducted family indeed , the Chiveries .
Nothing else that he knows on .
What did I tell you when we came away from <NAME> that time ?
If he won ' t listen to reason , we must do it against his will , and show him that we are determined to exert our authority .
Resigning himself to which condition with a perfectly satisfied manner , <NAME> begs the favour of another cup of coffee .
I never speak to him at such an hour .
<NAME> and I know our duty to each other better , I pray Heaven ! ' ' Oh ! ' said <NAME> , nodding her head thoughtfully .
I 'm always writing for Ma .
He seized it with the same rapid impatience which had characterised his speech , and hastily made his way to the other side of the screen .
' I did this for years ; long , long years they were .
She is in her pride tonight. ' And as she spoke , she struck her hand upon her beautiful bosom , as though she would have beaten down herself .
' You claim to have one plain motive in all you do yourself .
' Who could have told you that I took another service at <NAME> , and that they afterwards moved all the way here ?
You do not know of what service it might be .
" It 's no fault of yours , sir ; but you shall judge .
I have been called picturesque myself .
It is the light of <NAME> . "
There ' s only one avenue to the <NAME> left often now , and I shall have to stop up that to-night with a pair of gloves .
What is it ? " " News from the other world ! " " How , then ? " cried madame , contemptuously .
Such a confusion of tongues , before the circumstances were related , and the proofs disclosed !
' Fine mornin ' , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , senior .
Shake hands with it on .
They always went on agen me about the Devil .
I was in this family before you were born .
' This is more than _I_ knew of him , ' she said , giving it back .
I disgrace nobody and cumber nobody ; that 's something .
' I would not have had them here , for the world . '
' <NAME> , you are inconsiderate : you expect too much of your sister .
Is it possible , I wonder , that there was any analogy between the case of the <NAME> population and the case of the little Gradgrinds ?
My <NAME> says she has been " bored to death . "
They set off Florence very much , to his fancy ; but not himself .
I have been throwed , all sorts of styles , all my life ! "
Thus , in the midst of the mud and at the heart of the fog , sits the <NAME> Chancellor in his <NAME> of Chancery .
<NAME> <NAME> 's great-aunt conquered a confirmed habit of living into which she had fallen , and <NAME> became a part of our establishment .
He had secretly interposed against this confiding young man , for no better real reason than because the young man ' s ways were not his ways .
" Yes , " repeated the stranger , looking round at the rest of the company with his right hand extended towards the witness , <NAME> .
Yes , yes , yes. ' ' Your position , my dear <NAME> , is now a fine one .
<NAME> cake , covered with <NAME> , silver , and true-lovers ' knots .
" I turned her gently over , placed my hands upon her breast to calm her and keep her down , and looked into her face .
He had reached the old house at last -- how hot the room was .
' Demnition pleasant , and a tip-top sawyer. ' ' And what said he ? ' asked <NAME> , knitting his brows .
Indeed there is nothing in the world I would n't do to show how much . "
They are not at home .
I know not where to go .
In the girls ' school , reading was proposed ; and as I felt tolerably equal to that art , I expressed my willingness to hear a class .
Why have I never heard until the day before yesterday of your suffering yourself to be cooped up in jail ?
You hag , you cat , you dog , you brimstone barker ! "
' Only a gentleman and his wife , Miss. ' ' And who are they ?
But I have an interest in the little creature , and a respect for her that I can not express to you .
My guardian did not seek to dissuade me , and I went .
asked <NAME> , in a low voice , of <NAME> .
' There is no date to that , is there ? ' inquired a juror .
<NAME> , sir , I am sure , ' said <NAME> , beginning to regard himself in quite a new light .
' <NAME> ' s hollow down by the flare is not there now .
I never have any money .
He carried the child over , and before the timid arm was loosed from his neck asked her for a kiss .
One evening , a holiday night with them , <NAME> and her grandfather went out to walk .
<NAME> flew swiftly by , and summer came .
Now you 're a-going to poll-pry and question according to custom -- I know what you 're a-going to be up to .
' <NAME> ' s , up <NAME> way ? ' Mr Wegg admits that he is bound for that port .
no mistake about that , ' said a very red-faced man , behind a cigar .
Yes , <NAME> thought she had better go with me .
The fashionable intelligence says so for the comfort of the <NAME> , and it knows all fashionable things .
" Then it was your young man who came for me .
The <NAME> of My Resolution XIV .
The name of Mr Tite <NAME> has been mentioned to me as representing some highly influential interest among his creditors .
' Sir. ' Stay here. ' <NAME> seemed uncertain .
' I beg your pardon , ' said the <NAME> , looking up with an air of abstraction .
But , when she suffered it to break loose , it was only for a moment .
' <NAME> , you amaze me , ' cried <NAME> .
' I will have a respectful , prompt , and ready bearing towards myself , ' he continued , ' and towards <NAME> , and towards your mother .
It was evening when I arrived , much fatigued by the journey I had so often made so easily .
'You have some papers , ' said <NAME> advancing , 'which were placed in your hands , for better security , by a man called <NAME> . '
<NAME> <NAME> couldn ' t bear the climate , my dear .
says <NAME> slightly , " we have n't got much good out of <NAME> .
' No , my son , ' he resumed , with a snap of his fingers .
' Address your observations to me , sir , ' interposed <NAME> ; ' I alone am to blame , if anybody be. ' ' Oh !
<NAME> up everybody else , and welcome .
As we advanced , I began to feel misgivings that my companion lost confidence .
' We are thankful to come here for rest , sir , ' said <NAME> .
The river has washed away its banks , and stately trees have fallen down into the stream .
" Somebody 's been making free here ! "
' Is he as soft as ever ?
<NAME> <NAME> returned no other reply than by taking the little <NAME> in her arms , and making his cockade perfectly flat and limp with her caresses .
It was too much for Mrs. <NAME> , who immediately rose .
If <NAME> would have the distinguished goodness to occupy the other salon especially reserved for him , for but five minutes , all would go well .
Not that he has any suspicions , but that he may as well know what they are up to in there .
' Hold your tongue , sir , ' said <NAME> .
" No , sir , " I said , " I do n't think I shall , " really not seeing on consideration why I should be .
Most solemnly. ' ' Nor let the <NAME> touch me , not yet so much as look at me ! ' with another struggle .
" Six months , a year ! " " Not so long as that , " said I .
Had these been such , their imprisoned rays of light would have taken flight that moment , and they would have been as dull as lead .
What can I do to save him , sir ? '
<NAME> Leicester rises , adjusts her scarf about her , and returns to his seat .
' Of course there is. ' ' Who do you mean ? ' said <NAME> , in the same mysterious manner .
' By a slip from <NAME> , <NAME> , we learn that the <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> , my amiable subject , you will get your money .
Let his foe follow him , and find him for himself , but not through me !
There was a Mrs <NAME> lived at <NAME> before me , and perhaps you ' re mistaking me for her .
' But why did you tell her ?
' This is a good beginning , ' he said bitterly .
' Why , confound the woman , ' exclaimed <NAME> , ' she IS sentimental !
The little picture was so instantaneously dissolved by our going in , that one might have doubted whether it had ever been .
<NAME> , I wo n't be smothered any more .
The cook and housemaid screamed .
' Is there anybody at home ?
There are always on board ship , a Sanguine One , and a Despondent One .
'That 's not the point , ' said the doctor , mysteriously .
How are you ? ' ( very shortly . )
Would you ? " and began dancing backwards and forwards in a manner quite unparalleled within my limited experience .
A damp mist rose from the river , and the marshy ground about ; and spread itself over the dreary fields .
I had never been shown my mama 's grave .
She wanted no strengthening in her firmness ; but if she had had need of any , she would have derived it from his kindling face .
' Well , <NAME> , ' said Dr Lumbey , ' this makes six .
'If you knew what I am sometimes , you would pity me , indeed .
<NAME> dismiss that from your consideration .
I had taken care to have it well understood in <NAME> Britain when my birthday was .
' He bites. ' ' Eh , <NAME> , eh ? ' pursued the client .
While you are here , I must stipulate that you are always known as -- say as <NAME> -- an ordinary name , and convenient .
" It 's true enough , " he said , going before us with the lantern , " that they call me the <NAME> and call my shop Chancery .
" You 're not tall enough to reach the tub ! "
In this state , the waiter ' s dismal intelligence about the ships immediately connected itself , without any effort of my volition , with my uneasiness about <NAME> .
' I am in no difficulty , ' exclaimed <NAME> , ' and in no hurry .
Let me put your shawl tidy .
" My dear , I do n't know it , " said I .
' <NAME> , Mr Rokesmith , I can ' t say what I consider them , ' returned the young lady .
He was very fond of reading the papers , very fond of making fancy-sketches with a pencil , very fond of nature , very fond of art .
Very glad indeed to have the pleasure .
' I am charmed , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' let me assure you , with <NAME> .
Not I , I hope ! ' ' You hope , indeed !
Can I hope that she will still remain the same <NAME> as of old ?
' I hope that ' s <NAME> ! ' said <NAME> .
There was a cut upon his forehead , and they had been wetting his hair , which lay bedabbled and entangled on the pillow .
He asked her , after short consideration , why she supposed so .
Sometimes she wondered , with a swelling heart and rising tear , whether she was proficient enough in anything to surprise him when they should become companions .
Why , I think that sometimes. ' ' You are laughing , <NAME> .
We will behold , and minutely examine , a scene so interesting to every Englishman. ' ' We will , ' was the animated cry of three voices .
That the mother and father , unknown to one another , were dwelling within so many miles , furlongs , yards if you like , of one another .
' Play ! ' suddenly cried the bowler .
He could not tell me that ; he saw me , and over my shoulder he saw the man .
The quick eye of the <NAME> detected his helplessness immediately , and now , as she afterwards observed , she felt she had got him .
And it takes away the hunger as well as wittles , deary. ' She hands him the nearly-emptied pipe , and sinks back , turning over on her face .
" No more did n't I of mine , " cries Guster .
Every word he uttered had a force that no other grace could have imparted to it .
' There ' s a friend he took to very much at last .
But he thought it better not to ask the question ; and walked back to the shop : thinking over all he had seen and heard .
She had never been quite at her ease with him , and received him with some little embarrassment as he seated himself near her table .
I believe your father is acquainted with his daughter <NAME> ' s writing .
The child answered that that was not its name ; it was a garden -- his brother ' s .
And may my prayers go up to Heaven that ' twill be a happiness to her , and a comfort , and a honour , all her life !
" You said , dear guardian , when we spoke of <NAME> before <NAME> left us , that you thought he would give a long trial to another country .
But , that it was hopeless to question him on that one reserved point , <NAME> , with his small eyes too near together , saw full well .
The wine-shop keeper accordingly rolled his eyes about , until they rested upon an elderly gentleman and a young lady , who were seated in a corner .
I ' m a going to seek my Em ' ly .
' I doubt , ' said <NAME> , ' if he can be here till next day. ' ' Then I will come next night too , ' said <NAME> .
' And what I recommend you for the present , is , don ' t talk , <NAME> .
This was very disagreeable to a guilty mind .
Whether they turned into it on his movement or on hers matters little .
There was something in this .
" How much ? " " Only two sets of them. " " Give me the worst first. " " There they are , <NAME> .
' Would you not like to be rich NOW , my darling ? ' ' How can you ask me such a question , <NAME> dear ?
But he sat and looked at her , notwithstanding , for nearly two hours , as she sat looking at the fire , until he was again called out .
In the evening I started , by that conveyance , down the road I had traversed under so many vicissitudes .
At last , the top of the staircase was gained , and they stopped for the third time .
You are , we will say in round numbers , twenty years of age ; <NAME> is , we will say in round numbers , fifty .
Approaching nearer and nearer , the bargeman became <NAME> , in rough water-side second-hand clothing .
Accompanying <NAME> to the gate , she as closely watched what followed .
Nothing of any kind was missing .
There is little enough in the high tide of the day , but there is next to none at night .
He can not do so , she tells him , too plainly or too briefly .
There was no wind to make a ripple on the foul water within the harbour , or on the beautiful sea without .
Where am I to wait for her ?
He meant to be clear of the town very early ; before the Hands were in the streets .
'And your reasons , <NAME> , ' he said , at length , in a low voice ; 'your reasons for this decision ? '
I can speak to no one else about him , but poor Kit .
You do n't mean to set up for a new character with <NAME> after all these years , I hope ? "
' But what ' s the use of tapping ? ' he said , ' She ' ll never hear .
<NAME> profusion is in the shops : particularly in the articles of currants , raisins , spices , candied peel , and moist sugar .
' No , thank you , ' said Mr Toots , ' it ' s all quite right .
It was the peculiarity of the nuptials that they were all Bride .
' <NAME> down , <NAME> , ' said Mr Toots .
I asked if the brickmaker 's wife were ill , but <NAME> said no .
' I ask you , <NAME> , are you frightened ?
' No , of course not , ' he assented .
You ' d persuade me if you could , that you are a poor Jew .
I am very sorry I intruded , I am sure .
' <NAME> ' t be alarmed , my dear , ' he said , gently ; ' I am not angry with you .
His countenance had , perhaps for years , become so set in its contentious expression that it did not soften , even now when he was quiet .
Oliver reached the stile at which the by-path terminated ; and once more gained the high-road .
I couldn ' t bear to have anything of that sort going on with myself .
' We ' ll go and look at ' em. ' Away we went .
<NAME> need to show that this detested family name had long been anathematised by <NAME> , and was wrought into the fatal register .
I am seldom called upon to put my young friends into mourning ; not into real mourning , that is ; Court mourning they are rather proud of .
The seats , instead of stretching from end to end , are placed crosswise .
' I say nothing of his plea for claiming my confidence .
In whatever state she walked away , she certainly did not walk back again .
<NAME> , <NAME> , this long while !
During the day , his bedstead turns up against the wall , and leaves more space for him to work in .
This was the result of his day ' s anxiety , and this was the decision he put in practice when the day closed in .
I promise you nothing , ' said the dolls ' dressmaker , dabbing two dabs at him with her needle , as if she put out both his eyes .
But , perhaps , she little thinks how I would retort upon her if I married her son .
<NAME> <NAME> , open your eyes , that ' s a love !
This was , when he was asked a Parliamentary question on any one topic , to return an answer on any other .
At this sally , the boys laughed .
It was lost upon <NAME> , who was stooping at the moment to tie the boot-lace which the dog had torn .
" Why did you not tell me , Mrs .
' You don ' t know who he is !
His colour changed though , when , without a pause , it came on through the heavy door , and passed into the room before his eyes .
" You acted noble , my boy , " said he .
He would have been more and more sensible of what was wanting in his home .
Then our brother was drawn -- swiftly -- to drunkenness .
I am afraid you ' ll find me very dull .
<NAME> ! ' We gave him three times three , and another , and a good one to finish with .
' But about these boys of yours ; you wanted to speak to me ? ' ' Yes , ' replied <NAME> .
They were now by an avenue of trees .
This was done and said with a comical mixture of jest and earnest , and , leading to a great amount of laughter , made them very merry indeed .
I hope they will manage their little income. ' ' Oh !
' I am not very likely to , ' rejoined <NAME> .
You hold your life on the condition that to the last you shall struggle hard for it .
<NAME> <NAME> ' s brow darkened during the recital .
But now she soothed him with gentle and tender words , smiled at his thinking they could ever part , and rallied him cheerfully upon the jest .
" You are very poor , ai n't you ? "
He had not previously uttered a word .
Utterly preposterous as his cravat was , and as his collars were , I was conscious of a sort of dignity in the look .
One Dowager , <NAME> calls it lip-salve .
" Not much of that , sir , though that HAS happened .
' " Stay , love , " cried the young lady .
Plashwater Weir <NAME> ! ' The bargeman stopped , and looked back .
says <NAME> , who likes nothing better than to model his conversation on forensic principles .
' The dear young friend to whom he presents me , may be a comfort to me at some time , he says .
' And yet so pretty , so pretty ! ' And added presently , as he walked to and fro in his room .
For example , these ravishing ear-rings and this necklace so superb to correspond , were what one called a love-gift .
' Ah , <NAME> ? ' said <NAME> .
What place is this , to which the squalid street conducts us ?
" I am not at all tired , my dear , " said I , " and would much prefer to go out . "
' Now then. ' There was a sharp whirring noise , that made <NAME> start back as if he had been shot himself .
To a poor one most . "
' More shame for you , ' retorted the nurse .
<NAME> and ventilation , drainage and water-service , all of the primest quality .
<NAME> is a great favourite of mine , ' said Mrs. Sparsit , ' as indeed he is of most people .
Revived by soup , <NAME> discourses mildly of the <NAME> with <NAME> and <NAME> .
It is in the hands of my solicitor .
' It seems improbable because it is improbable , ' his friend returned .
of the honour of his alliance .
No human intelligence could have read the mysteries of his mind , in the scared blank wonder of his face .
Then , I considered , when I had got safe back again , this was a nice thing to have done !
How they said , ' Bagstock , your friend <NAME> now , what is the view he takes of such and such a question ?
<NAME> at him while I ask the way , ' said <NAME> .
I lodge at one Mr <NAME> ' s , at Holloway. ' Mr <NAME> stared again .
' He sought the pig with all the ardour of their early friendship -- but , alas !
' Son of Bitherstone of <NAME> .
<NAME> could not but assent again .
When she , cast out of home , come here to me , and dropped upon them planks , her wownded heart was broke .
What a strange peculiarity on the part of Mr Meagles , and where should we find another such case !
Now pray remark , <NAME> , and Mr Sols , the depth of my wife ' s penetration .
There is no man in this world on whom I could so rely for right guidance , as on you .
This is our sitting-room , -- just such chairs and tables and carpet and so forth , you see , as they could spare from home .
he had never played with three thorough-paced female card-players before .
So <NAME> quenched her wonder in her gratitude whenever it broke out , and soon subdued it .
The closing of the door recalled him to himself .
He had been brought down to <NAME> , from <NAME> , by an eminent Philanthropist , and why ?
' She ' s got hold o ' some inwention for grown-up people being born again , <NAME> -- the new birth , I think they calls it .
But it 's a weak chance if he 'd come , sir ! "
It still wanted ten minutes to the hour when he had ascended the staircase on which <NAME> ' s chambers were .
Stumbled against them. ' ' The people ? ' ' Yes .
He stopped just as his eminently practical friend , still accompanied by the two young culprits , entered the room .
' I dare say I didn ' t make myself very clear , ' he went on , ' nor you neither .
To offer it or hint at it would be to drive him to an extremity , if nothing else did . "
NOW lift me , my love. ' <NAME> very softly raised the weather-stained grey head , and lifted her as high as <NAME> .
How much are you out of pocket ?
I don ' t know her ! ' I knew her .
" And so , <NAME> , " says <NAME> of the shooting gallery after several turns in silence , " you were dreaming of the country last night ? "
I have wronged thee , <NAME> , but I will right thee yet , I will indeed .
' I promise , ' said <NAME> .
You separated yourself from my affairs .
But no such day had ever dawned on Mr Dombey , or his wife ; and the course of each was taken .
Has this letter any connexion with dear little <NAME> ?
By-and-bye , they went into the house .
Say the next day ! ' I said the next day ; and he put on his great-coat and lighted his cigar , and set off to walk home .
<NAME> <NAME> ' s world was peopled with profligates , and he acted accordingly .
As to <NAME> , <NAME> 's brother , I am really afraid to say what he did at school in ciphering , but I think it was decimals .
" Why , I must get a lodging of some sort , " said <NAME> , pondering .
The furniture was all very solid and good , like his watch-chain .
You are -- hum -- quite accurate , I have no doubt .
There were the piles of city roofs and chimneys , more free from smoke than on week-days ; and there were the distant masts and steeples .
I walked out once , <NAME> , during a conversation between two brothers , to which , in the beginning , young <NAME> was a party .
'Wounded desperate , miss , ' replied <NAME> , with indescribable complacency .
<NAME> , sitting by , looked down at the dark eyelashes lying wet on the flushed cheeks , and looked with gentleness and pity , for she knew the truth .
" The first until we meet to-morrow , the second as a farewell to this theme between us for ever . "
Now , <NAME> -- after you , ma ' am. ' Mrs <NAME> hesitated , but Mr <NAME> insisted .
Perhaps it was so likened by the lonely <NAME> , standing on the brink of the lock .
' Humph ! ' retorted <NAME> , looking at the fire .
He saw nothing of it , for before he looked at her , she had again cast down her eyes !
Before turning to retrace his steps , he stopped upon the margin , to look down at the reflected night .
A housekeeper would be acceptable over yonder at the <NAME> , for instance .
' May I take the liberty to say something ? ' ' You may , ' <NAME> graciously conceded .
His recital ended , <NAME> insisted upon his young friend ' s stripping off his coat and allowing whatever injuries he had received to be properly tended .
Within , there were two glasses of rum and milk prepared , and two biscuits .
She withdrew her hand timidly from his arm as we stopped to speak to them , and blushed as she gave it to <NAME> and to me .
Every street was a sawpit , and there were no top-sawyers ; every passenger was an under-sawyer , with the sawdust blinding him and choking him .
The stranger did not recognize me , but I recognized him as the gentleman I had met on the stairs , on the occasion of my second visit to <NAME> .
The murdered person was a woman , -- a woman a good ten years older , very much larger , and very much stronger .
I can ' t say more than that for ' em. ' ' I ' ll take this man myself , sir , ' said Mr Inspector to <NAME> .
P'raps they would n't do it if I wos to go myself .
' Well , sir , I have been thinking that if you were in waiting in the garden behind , alone -- ' ' Alone , ' said <NAME> .
' How ? ' was <NAME> ' s inquiry , in a low and slow voice , after a silence .
' It may be , or may not be , ' said Mr Boffin , ' just as you view it .
'When a man 's his own enemy , it 's only because he 's too much his own friend ; not because he 's careful for everybody but himself .
And now to see him after all , and in a prison too !
" Why have you told my story to so many persons ? "
So there ain ' t no other character ; ain ' t there , my lad ? ' Walter briskly waved his hand in the negative .
' Very bad , ' said the landlord .
I wish your ladyship good day , and am much obliged to you all the same . "
' You ' ll go home very soon , you will .
Look to your feet , <NAME> , for we shall try your boots .
' <NAME> ? ' repeated the other , with a wide show of his teeth .
'You seem out of humour , <NAME> . '
<NAME> had fallen on him in its place .
Not of late years , ' replied the <NAME> , with a flourish of his hand .
He felt the more resigned to it , forasmuch as <NAME> enjoyed herself completely , and <NAME> was delighted .
I am not very old , you may say .
' Have I startled you ? ' he asked .
<NAME> bowed and stepped forward .
I might have known it from what I have seen of your strength of character .
I have derived inexpressible comfort from it .
I saw <NAME> lay her beads down .
What should I have lost ?
My love to you ! ' Some of the fog that hung about old <NAME> seemed to have got into his throat ; for he spoke huskily .
Had her attractions been manifested first to him -- or <NAME> ?
A railroad yonder , see , where two stout horses trot along , drawing a score or two of people and a great wooden ark , with ease .
If you ever read this letter , <NAME> , I am likely to be dead .
The patient figures at work were swarthy with the filings of iron and steel that danced on every bench and bubbled up through every chink in the planking .
I had been afraid until then to say a word about the play .
Oliver murmured his comprehension of the different bodies referred to ; and <NAME> proceeded to load the pistol , with great nicety and deliberation .
Thinks it long enough for <NAME> .
The coat was wide-skirted ; and in that respect like _the_ coat , but , oh how different !
' It seemed at first as if it was only <NAME> that he objected to meet .
It ' s a sensible and proper thing indeed , what Mrs <NAME> has said ! ' exclaimed the old lady .
' My dear girl ! ' ' You frightened me. ' ' Most unintentionally , but I am as sorry as if I had meant to do it .
Can I have a word with you ? ' ' <NAME> .
Two cognovits -- take care of them .
' She ought not to be alone here ; ought she , <NAME> ? ' said <NAME> , anxiously .
' Very seasonable. ' ' Seasonablest veather I ever see , sir , ' rejoined <NAME> .
" And , again and again , I am glad to see you , Watt !
<NAME> <NAME> with it !
'That it wo n't do ; so it 's no use a-trying it on , <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> .
At length he went back again , and took the road which leads from <NAME> to <NAME> .
You have too much feeling. ' ' We have all our faults , ' said <NAME> , weeping and shaking her head .
' You can ' t be trusted for a moment .
And this was the first passage of <NAME> ' s first love .
<NAME> at parting recapitulated to the old man all that she had said before , and bound him to their compact .
He has not a large business , but he is a very respectable man .
" Not in season ! " says I .
'Oh , you know , <NAME> , he must be mad , ' said Mrs. Sowerberry .
They left you , you say -- at those races , as I understand .
' Let me see then , ' resumed Mr Boffin , with his hand to his chin .
<NAME> <NAME> kissed her hand , retired to the window , and pulling out his pocket-handkerchief , had a mental wrestle with himself .
Oh deep , exhaustless , mighty well of love , in which so much was sunk !
'Not one little peep , miss ? '
Mrs. Rouncewell confirms all this , not without personal pride , reserving only the one point of affability .
' <NAME> , ' said the <NAME> , in persuasive accents .
" 'You see , monsieur , I am going to use them , ' I replied , and said no more .
It can never be a solitary one to you and me .
However , we must take it as it comes .
Equally , when he lay still and staring , he would repeat it for hours without cessation , but then , always in a tone of subdued warning and horror .
' Men are not born able seamen .
Let me first see that he is in visiting order . '
It is certain that Mr Toots , by some remote and roundabout road , had got to that point , and that there he made a stand .
<NAME> is in a new situation , and his prospects are very good indeed .
' <NAME> him -- ' ' What ? ' ' Such dreadful words , ' said <NAME> .
" <NAME> , " said I , " do you remember , when we were overtaken by the thunder-storm , <NAME> 's speaking to you of her sister ? "
At mid-day following he reappeared at the <NAME> , in the character , not new to him , of a witness before a <NAME> ' s <NAME> .
He do n't get no iron rust here ! " II .
Do you think I would tell you so or come to you like this , if it were not the case ? ' <NAME> looked at him more closely .
While he smoked out his cigar in peace , she made his bed , and put the small room in order for his repose .
The weather is so very bad down in <NAME> that the liveliest imagination can scarcely apprehend its ever being fine again .
' I object on principle , ' said <NAME> , ' as a biped -- ' ' As a what ? ' asked Mr Boffin .
Nelly , kneeling down beside the box , was soon busily engaged in her task , and accomplishing it to a miracle .
Such an ugly villain too ! " said <NAME> .
I do n't know what may happen if I am carried beyond myself at last !
I have saved him. " VII .
' Why , she complains of suffering from the fright of last night , ' said the lady .
" This is a truly sad time , Mr .
' I 'll fetch him directly , ' said Mrs. Mann , leaving the room for that purpose .
Yes ; I knew that <NAME> was looking out for me. ' ' Do you keep a cat down there ? ' asked <NAME> .
She was still doing this , five minutes afterwards .
It 's a fight to get back again .
' " Damn you , " said I , starting up , and rushing upon him ; " I killed her .
I deserve the reproach , which is very just indeed .
They were a full half-hour in conference .
' Come in , my love , ' said <NAME> .
Not six—but what believes as he has doon his duty by the rest and by himseln .
He has the constitution of a rhinoceros , the digestion of an ostrich , and the concentration of an oyster .
<NAME> gracious , such a woman ! ' <NAME> shook his head with great solemnity , as though to imply that he supposed she must have been rather a dazzler .
said <NAME> , folding his hands .
It was either you or the schoolmaster -- one of you , or the two between you -- that got the forged letter done ; remember that !
" A fog , miss , " said the young gentleman .
Why , my limbs only made my breath shorter when I used ' em .
Like his impudence ! ' said <NAME> .
It is in the present mode .
' But oh , my friends and brothers !
' Then , if you please , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' have the goodness to turn the cushion .
<NAME> <NAME> is only a baronet , but there is no mightier baronet than he .
Then , the mender of roads having got his tools together and all things ready to go down into the village , roused him .
<NAME> is but a poor calling .
The hysterics called up <NAME> .
The steamer for <NAME> and the steamer for <NAME> would start from <NAME> at about nine on Thursday morning .
In the meantime , Mrs. <NAME> kept unwinking watch and ward .
I think he would not be much the better for the mother .
Other professional men go out of town .
' I ' m thinking how old you must be , ' said <NAME> .
' The same mistake presents itself to me , in one shape or other , at every turn , ' said brother Charles .
But it left a little figure visible upon a lonely shore , and <NAME> was always staring at it .
So the doctors ordered him off .
' No , no , <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> , arresting his hand , ' A lady .
' Twenty pound ten better , ' repeated <NAME> , ' than you did that day when I first introduced myself .
' You see and hear this foolish creature .
' I beg your parding , young man , ' said Mrs. Raddle , in a cold perspiration of anger .
cried the doctor , as usual , all in a bustle .
' Where are you , <NAME> ? ' ' Here , sir , ' replied <NAME> .
With the funeral clang that it sounded into <NAME> ' s heart , his sense of weakness returned .
A moment more , and <NAME> came clattering along the passage , with the noise of all the nails in his boots condensed into every separate nail .
' I didn ' t seek it of him , poor lad .
' But people think more of it than people think. ' <NAME> returned , with an uncomfortable feeling in so very slight a courtesy being unusual , <NAME> that all !
I parted with the secret , even while I was angry with myself for doing so .
I hope it is not self-indulgent to shed these tears as I think of it .
Never mind ; send some bread -- only a loaf of bread and a cup of water .
And when I got downstairs , oh , how I cried !
I have no more to say .
" Then I may say at once that I am glad of it , because it is on that subject that I am anxious to be understood .
" Really , sir , I think she might , " said Mrs. Blinder , getting her heavy breath by painful degrees .
" Him that I ' ve know ' d so intimate so many years , and like so much .
I rather feel it to be so .
All through the night the wind blows , and abates not .
<NAME> Jasper proving willing to speak for Mrs. Tope , <NAME> , who had sent up his card , was invited to ascend the postern staircase .
<NAME> <NAME> emerges from behind the cherubim ' s leg , when all is quiet , and comes slowly down from the gallery .
Mr <NAME> was far from quarrelling , in his own breast , with the manner of his beautiful betrothed .
' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , compassionating his follower ' s confusion and embarrassment .
I must tell you that as to this , I have felt , ever since I have been away , an anxiety which I am very anxious to relieve .
It is very doubtful whether <NAME> knows how to laugh .
We were twelve boarders , and there were two Miss Donnys , twins .
For many years the persistent <NAME> has been pointing , with no particular meaning , from that ceiling .
I have said so to Venus. ' ' You certainly have , sir , ' said <NAME> .
He was a dreadful old man to look at , in a filthy flannel waistcoat , and smelling terribly of rum .
I saw a figure like myself lying dressed in my clothes on a bed .
She had risen , as the nurse said , and the lashes of her eyes were wet with tears .
He only took it under his arm , however , and marched out of the office in profound silence .
<NAME> him that if , in his own present , he can find a reason to think less bitterly of me , I asked him to do so .
" And I never saw him ! "
He lent it at ten , and thought that pretty high .
Now , the <NAME> has got its gentleman again , through me .
It was called <NAME> , <NAME> 's <NAME> ; and I had no other guide to <NAME> 's <NAME> than the <NAME> Rope-walk .
' Indeed ! ' said <NAME> , surprised .
And I get too much of Mrs. <NAME> 's first and second . "
If you do , I can put her in the way of getting one .
I never saw a sight so pitiful as this before !
' Oh , you ' ve woke up , at last , have you ? ' said <NAME> .
I am the person you inquired for . '
' O , you Fool ! ' said Mrs. Sparsit , when she was alone at her supper .
The journey seemed endless ; street after street was entered and left behind ; and still they went jolting on .
' You seem to be sorry , Rosa. ' ' I am sorry for the poor old place .
And I noticed as I kissed my dear that she lay with one hand under her pillow so that it was hidden .
" I goes out to work , sir , " returns <NAME> .
He came of rich people down in <NAME> , who had nursed this combination of qualities until they made the discovery that it was just of age and a blockhead .
Or what avails a curse or blessing from a man like you ?
' That ain ' t no word for it .
' Why , that ' s the very thing , ' replied <NAME> , as though his thoughts were about them at that moment .
What , surely must I understand ? " " That I can not wish to renew that chance intercourse with you of long ago , under these different circumstances .
<NAME> <NAME> was still indulging in the same extraordinary gestures , and the cracking of his fingers sounded louder that ever .
Not <NAME> our Manager , <NAME> -- the other <NAME> ; the <NAME> -- <NAME> !
Some young children sported among the tombs , and hid from each other , with laughing faces .
<NAME> at the expiration of the quarter of an hour , went down to breakfast .
' Please to be seated , sir , ' said Mrs. Sparsit .
At this hour , just as evening is closing in , you will see them roaming towards bed by scores , eating their way to the last .
<NAME> will go regularly between us , and when the time comes you may be certain I shall be ready .
A quainter corner than the corner where the <NAME> lived , was not to be found in <NAME> .
Though all unseen , and unsuspected by the pupils , <NAME> even pervaded the school exercises .
You must look to this , and see that her heart does not grow heavy among these solemn ruins .
" You get me a file. " He tilted me again .
" If they are not in that room , they are gone , and can be pursued and brought back , " said <NAME> to herself .
' And what have they made you sensible of ? ' <NAME> ' s play of eyes between the two holds good throughout the dialogue , to the end .
' A mistake , a mistake ! ' Turning away , he sat down with a heavy sigh in the faded chair again .
When I left the <NAME> for good , I asked for them , and brought them away with me .
Where ' s your feminine tenderness ? ' ' You thankless dog ! ' gasped <NAME> .
" She in all respects deserves it , " says my Lady .
" I do not even know , " said I , speaking low as he took his seat at the table , " by what name to call you .
My rambles , <NAME> , are over. ' ' How do I know that ' ere , sir ? ' argued <NAME> .
At a place where she worked , answered <NAME> , blushing .
It was as stately and as dark as ever , when he went by and glanced up at its frowning front .
I don ' t complain of him. ' As she said it , with her eyes upon the fire-glow , there was an instantaneous escape of distress into her face .
A thick , yellow liquor defiles them , which is offensive to the touch and sight and more offensive to the smell .
<NAME> looked at him for the reason .
We will not detain you. ' ' I thank you , sir , ' said <NAME> .
We wouldn ' t mind then , when there comes stormy weather. -- -Not for our own sakes , I mean .
Deep ditches , double drawbridge , massive stone walls , eight great towers , cannon , muskets , fire and smoke .
<NAME> was the first to change .
There is a curse on it , and on all this land. " " And you ? " said the uncle .
'Speak out , my friend , if you have anything to say .
He said no more , and there was silence for some quarter of an hour until supper appeared .
He was as good-natured a dancing-master as ever danced to the <NAME> , and he kept his word .
One was the flippant contempt with which the guests evidently regarded her uncle , and the other , the easy insolence of their manner towards herself .
bawled <NAME> , calling in a state of great excitement , up the staircase ; 'here 's one of the thieves , ma'am !
' You are not so old , <NAME> , are you , that you ' ll leave your mistress yet ? ' said <NAME> .
Is n't there bright eyes somewheres , wot you love the thoughts on ? " O Estella , <NAME> !
This flabby lump of mortality that we work so hard at with such patient perseverance , yields no sign of you .
I was not angry with them ; I was more afraid of them , as if I were cast away among creatures with whom I had no community of nature .
So far as it was developed , it had been my happiness to form it .
No one remained now but the excitable Jew , who had already raised the skirts of <NAME> 's coat to his lips several times .
' " Now then ! " said a voice , as my uncle felt a hand on his shoulder , " you ' re booked for one inside .
He smoked his pipe as we went along , and sometimes stopped to clap me on the shoulder .
I mustn ' t be put upon , as a numble person , too much .
As to <NAME> and me , whom he had wrapped up with great care , the night being sharp and frosty , we trembled from head to foot .
It being a cold night , the <NAME> wore his hat , as , indeed , was often his custom within doors .
Monsieur the <NAME> indicates me with his finger , standing near our little fountain , and says , 'To me !
<NAME> <NAME> had hooked him in the coat collar with the handle of his umbrella , and was hanging on at the other end with all his might and main .
" The dearest friend I have ! "
" What is to be told to <NAME> ?
in quick reply to a gesture of dissent from the housekeeper .
' Come in , ' said <NAME> .
However , if he won ' t lead , I can ' t follow .
Besides , that lonely girl with the dark hair runs in my head .
" Now , <NAME> , " he began , " the word I have to say relates to <NAME> . "
how to know the charm in its beginning !
Do you remember one night when I came with <NAME> to your lodging in <NAME> ?
The cat expands her wicked mouth and snarls at him .
Gentlemen , we ' ve port , sherry , cigars , and most excellent champagne .
I had never known before how short life really was and into how small a space the mind could put it .
But , it beckoned him back in his sleep , and showed itself in shining forms .
There was a guard in the hut , and they challenged , and the sergeant answered .
But I expect a judgment .
" No , I do n't say that it was so , mother , but that I made it out to be so .
' No , <NAME> ' s-delight , ' said <NAME> , ' I am not afeard .
' Ye-yes ; oh , yes , ' replied <NAME> .
Two persons. ' ' To be sure , they didn ' t buy anything , ' cried the boy .
I would not lose her now , for all the treasures of the world .
It is she who should reproach ; not I .
Your sex have such a surprising animosity against one another when you do differ .
so do I. I see it all afore me , upon my soul I do , <NAME> .
' Help your mother to get breakfast , <NAME> .
The candle was drawn back , and the face disappeared .
' No , not all of you , ' said the strange man emphatically .
He stood for a moment at his own hall door , looking sedately at the elegant equipage as it rattled away .
' You appear to feel it so , ' rejoined <NAME> , smiling at the clerk , who was literally red-hot .
Suddenly he stood still , and asked <NAME> point-blank if he knew where she was ?
' Ha , ha ! ' cried Mr Slum , ' you ' re giving way , you ' re coming down .
" What do you mean ? " said I , half suspecting him to be mad .
' It strikes you in the same light , ' said <NAME> , with perfect calmness .
' Perhaps not , ' said <NAME> ; ' and you bring me back to the question , with an apology for digressing .
That night I knew he had a false and thankless heart .
' As I ' ve told you , <NAME> , I ' ve the best of friends .
" Do n't scold the old lady .
The lamps looked pale , and shook as if they were cold .
<NAME> did not see that ; but felt it incumbent on her to continue talking .
Her tears sprung forth beneath it , as she sunk upon her knees , and laid her aching head and streaming hair upon the pillow by its side .
But first she searched her pocket and found that her money was all gone -- not a sixpence remained .
It was the momentary yielding of a nature that had been disappointed from the dawn of its perceptions , but had not quite given up all its hopeful yearnings yet .
'Well , and what if he did , you little ungrateful wretch ? '
Not go as I have said ? "
But <NAME> couldn ' t get happily out of it .
Does she know your son ? ' ' <NAME> up together , sir , ' said <NAME> .
I was a good-enough-tempered man once , I believe .
<NAME> reviving the notion of the ball , would be scouted as a malignant idiot .
' So your name ' s <NAME> , eh ? ' said <NAME> .
You see I am informed of the circumstances ? " " Such is the fact , certainly , " said <NAME> .
' In-deed ! ' rejoined <NAME> , cringing excessively .
It was the figure of an old man with a bowed head , wearing a large brimmed low-crowned hat , and a long-skirted coat .
Hold me , somebody , while I laugh it out . '
The warm blaze alone defied it , and leaped and sparkled merrily .
<NAME> had given me his arm and was taking me away when <NAME> came up .
I will if I can .
It came upon him in a moment of inspiration , as he was smoking an early pipe in <NAME> Place after breakfast ; and it was worthy of the tobacco .
' I play my game to the end in spite of words ; and Death of my Body and Death of my Soul !
' Not a very old prisoner _that_ !
that ' s all , is it ? ' said <NAME> .
Looking round , he beholds the young man of the name of <NAME> , much discomfited and not presenting a very impressive letter of introduction in his manner and appearance .
What was <NAME> ' s affright and wonder when , at sight of her , with her tearful face , and outstretched arms , <NAME> recoiled and shrieked !
' You talk big , you do , but things look pretty black against yourself , to my thinking .
" Mrs. <NAME> has not the appearance , <NAME> , of a lady who has had two former husbands ? "
But do n't you fret yourself on that score .
says <NAME> , greedily curious .
<NAME> <NAME> turns up the gas and coughs behind his hand , modestly anticipating profit .
And I am ashamed of you , sir , ' said Mrs. <NAME> , lastly , ' for your slanders and suspicions .
' Oh , no , I ' m sure it wouldn ' t , ' replied the clerk , moving a little more into the centre of the doorway .
he cried impatiently , stamping his foot upon the ground .
Only I ' ll take it as a favour if you ' ll part company for the present .
I saw , directly , in his mother ' s face , that she knew from himself what he had done .
Come on , and do n't stand preaching there . '
' Why couldn ' t you let me be ! ' said <NAME> , ' when I was contented ?
As he now appeared in his doorway , towelling his hands , <NAME> got on his great-coat and stood by to snuff out the candles .
' I couldn ' t help it. ' ' Couldn ' t help it ! ' cried <NAME> .
Every night my Lady casually asks her maid , " Is <NAME> come ? "
I am in a counting-house , and looking about me. " " Is a counting-house profitable ? " I asked .
Everything of father ' s had gone wrong that night , and he hadn ' t pleased the public at all .
As if her life were an enchanted vision , there arose out of her solitude ministering thoughts , that made it fanciful and unreal .
I recalled , too , that the one-eyed gentleman had shuffled forth against the wall when I was the innocent cause of his being turned out .
At last I done it .
' Admirably groomed , <NAME> ' -- Mr <NAME> is patting the pony -- ' does you great credit -- amazingly sleek and bright to be sure .
' Come , sir , ' she said , with a cruel pleasure in repeating the stab , ' I will be as open with you as you can desire .
Mr <NAME> sat on a stool with a foot on the rail of another stool , and his hat on .
The younger brother stood apart .
This affords charming food for contemplation .
But the horses is off .
I wish her to know , and perhaps you will tell her ? ' ' Do you think , at your sister ' s age -- ' hinted <NAME> .
' When I was last here , ' I faltered , ' Miss <NAME> told me he was sailing here and there .
' Well then , the way was this .
Nor did he ever again face the doughty Mrs Pipchin , under <NAME> ' s roof .
He had nothing with him but his boat , and came on apace .
Of <NAME> laughing gaily ; and of <NAME> being so fond of Agnes that she will not be separated from her , but still keeps her hand .
To pass , <NAME> , from the ensign to the captain . "
' I have not the smallest doubt it ' s the fame of the phenomenon -- that ' s the man ; him in the great-coat and no shirt-collar .
Mr Feeder in a black coat was at the bottom .
We had a doleful parting , and when I took my place by <NAME> 's side , I felt that that was my place henceforth while he lived .
He drank deeply of it , and throwing his aching limbs upon the bank , sank into a delicious trance .
Such d ' licious broth and wine !
She felt she must do that , or he might suspect the truth .
' How goes the world this forenoon , gentlemen ?
There could not be fewer than five hundred people , and they were dancing like five thousand demons .
The baby-preference that even I have heard of as common among children , has never had its innocent resting-place in my breast .
<NAME> W. had better have come here , and <NAME> too .
Little Dorrit with amazement , saw this , and observed that they exchanged quick looks .
Oliver wondered what picking the old gentleman 's pocket in play , had to do with his chances of being a great man .
' My pet , if you please .
Everybody thought he ' d gone out of town. ' ' And how was he found out at last ? ' inquired <NAME> .
This modesty of mine directed my attention to the marine-store shops , and such shops as <NAME> ' s , in preference to the regular dealers .
( I really don ' t like the notion of his going wandering at large , he is so extremely liable to be run over .
<NAME> said it to me , but I had not spoken .
' Upon my soul , they ' re perfect .
It won ' t do. ' ' No , ' said Mr Boffin , with his voice still dropped , ' it really won ' t .
They ' ve got two children , tho we ' re thtrong in the <NAME> bithnith and the <NAME> dodge .
As I think the circumstances back , I hear the rain splashing on the stone pavement of the passage , which was not under cover .
In the autumn of the year , <NAME> and <NAME> were creeping up to the highest ridges of the Alps .
This old gentleman , or the <NAME> ? "
We parted , overwhelmed with grief ; and I think <NAME> enjoyed herself completely .
" First , " said my guardian , " can we do anything for your personal comfort , <NAME> ? "
Out of the rottenness of these things , there has sprung up in <NAME> a sect of philosophers known as Transcendentalists .
' Any news of the young gentleman who is so important to us all ? ' asked <NAME> , with his whole regiment of teeth on parade .
Altogether I was lost in amazement , and sat staring at her , quite oblivious , I am afraid , of the laws of politeness .
' You wouldn ' t mind my cutting out something while we are at tea , would you ? ' she asked her Jewish friend , with a coaxing air .
<NAME> <NAME> was in great force , and looked astonishingly young .
<NAME> , " said <NAME> , " only cried and said he hoped we might get on better than he and <NAME> had got on .
She was hurt too , at the same time , and lay insensible for some days ; bright as her eyes are , now .
The countenance of <NAME> fell , and anxiety overspread his features .
It seems to strike your fancy , dear . '
The expected guests are rather select than numerous , being <NAME> and Mrs. Chadband and no more .
And -- if you 'll excuse my saying so much -- I should hardly have thought you did yourself , sir . "
Do let us resolve ourselves into a <NAME> of the whole <NAME> !
The bridegroom , to whom the pen was handed first , made a rude cross for his mark ; the bride , who came next , did the same .
He departed on his errand , however , and immediately returned , ushering in its object .
Unconscious of this prediction , <NAME> continued to occupy precisely the same ground in reference to the Doctor and to Mrs. Strong .
It held a branch of fresh green holly in its hand ; and , in singular contradiction of that wintry emblem , had its dress trimmed with summer flowers .
' It created an immense sensation .
In a short restless interval of sensibility , or partial sensibility , I made out that he asked for you to be brought to sit by him .
" Oh , <NAME> , my dear , so much the worse , so much the worse ! "
I turned directly , came back , and looked again .
This fellow is pigeon-hearted and light-headed .
But she uttered no sound , and her breathing was no slower .
All this , I say , is yesterday ' s event .
And when we came at last to the five thousand cheeses ( canes he made it that day , I remember ) , my mother burst out crying .
' I mean of the foreign man , ' <NAME> explained .
' I can ' t bear to look at you .
<NAME> would come , however , in spite of her , when the carrier ' s horse pleased -- and did .
You do me the favour to follow , and to comprehend ? ' She kept her eyes fixed upon him with a frown .
Ugh ! -- to prevent my crying out , and then cruelly assaulted me. ' ' With this ? ' asked <NAME> , showing the pieces of cane .
chatters Grandfather Smallweed , swallowing his rage .
We might have been a party of <NAME> , the conversation assumed such a sanguine complexion .
I will pray for them , and believe that they will arrive .
' <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> ? ' Miss <NAME> repeated as she panted from stair to stair , ' where have I heard that name ?
<NAME> will read it for her , and tell her what to do .
The person who does copying . "
' Over and over again. ' ' Just like me !
To all appearance , almost in the dark : I have done all I could do to be lost .
" Good day , citizeness. " " Good day , citizen. " This mode of address was now prescribed by decree .
Arrived at the usurer ' s house , he found the windows close shut , the dingy blinds drawn down ; all was silent , melancholy , and deserted .
<NAME> has no such advantage .
Mr <NAME> came and sat down on the other side of her , and she felt the fraternal railing come behind her , and apparently stretch on to include <NAME> .
<NAME> stood arrested on the spot , and if he had awakened then , must have remained there .
He was pinched in , and swelled out , and got up , and strapped down , as much as he could possibly bear .
They never could have led a happy life together ; but nothing could have made it more unhappy , than the wilful and determined warfare of such elements .
' You know forty-seven songs , ' said the man , with a gravity which admitted of no altercation on the subject .
Would you be so good as look arter her , <NAME> , for a minute ? ' Mrs. Gummidge nodded and disappeared .
No man spoke , but the steersman held up his hand , and all softly backed water , and kept the boat straight and true before it .
' He stands up to you like -- like a -- why I don ' t know what he don ' t stand up to you like .
We desire that , too ; that he may not by any chance be made her prey again .
I hardly understand you. ' ' What will you take to be paid out ? ' said the butcher .
For what 's a door-chain when she 's got one always up ?
' Very sensitive ; that ' s a pity .
We are to be married whenever we can , and then I shall go to Pa at the office and write to <NAME> .
You may depend upon it , it would have a superb effect . '
<NAME> , I beg your pardon ; this is my friend <NAME> .
I neither wish to spare myself nor to be spared .
' <NAME> has gone to get a book or two he wants , and will probably be back before me .
I would n't lend anybody a sixpence. " " Rather mean to borrow under those circumstances , I should say. " " You should say , " repeated <NAME> .
It may not be the same . '
The barrier between Mr Dombey and his wife was not weakened by time .
' You , you won ' t be angry with me now .
He has been doing so ever since it fell dark .
<NAME> , no less steadily , kept them in sight .
It ' s no fun , ' said <NAME> , ' unless we take them by surprise .
" Why , my darling , " said I , " what a goose you must take me for !
says the master , walking towards him without his coat and waistcoat , and looking more soldierly than ever in his braces .
Mr Dombey goes upon a journey 21 .
<NAME> <NAME> got his arm securely round the daughter 's waist , and held her ; for he felt that she was sinking .
" Better to be a rational creature , " he added then , after ringing a small bell on the table , " and accept your natural destiny .
Do you know what would become of the <NAME> in that case ?
" Why , what 'll you do with a half-holiday , if you get it ? " said <NAME> .
' You are thoughtful today , <NAME> ! ' ' Agnes , shall I tell you what about ?
He may kill me for it if he likes , or if he dares , but if I am here I 'll give him up .
You will revive yet. " ' " Never again , <NAME> ; never again , " said the dying woman .
You ' ll know our light porter again ? ' ' Yes , sure , ' said <NAME> .
' You had better refresh your memory , sir , ' said <NAME> , with a threatening look .
Never shall I forget the lonely sensation of first lying down , without a roof above my head !
' I am the brother of the young lady who has been the subject of conversation here , ' said <NAME> .
Could the man <NAME> , in a moment of remorse , have divulged some secret conspiracy for his assassination ?
As it met his , the nose came down over the moustache and the moustache went up under the nose .
A minute ' s silence , and he murmured the burden of some roaring song .
' And yet with such a true and gallant spirit , ' pursued <NAME> .
I have no other trust , than that I have been with her since she came home , and that she has given me her confidence .
' That sort of people. -- -Are they really animals and clods , and beings of another order ?
On the Sunday morning we all set forth to walk to the little church in the park .
' Oh , <NAME> , when ? ' ' Now , ' said <NAME> .
' <NAME> , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> senior , taking off his upper coat , and seating himself with his accustomed gravity .
<NAME> <NAME> has wealthy friends who would coin their very hearts to save her in such a strait as this .
' Then where _are_ you going , pretty one ? ' ' Now I come to think of it , I don ' t know , ' said <NAME> .
<NAME> , and gloomy , and black , in truth it was , and sullen and dark were the rooms , once so bustling with life and enterprise .
Besides which , she is so charmingly ugly , ' relapsing into languor .
In fact , Mrs. <NAME> was about to solace herself with a cup of tea .
Upon my word and honour I think you can hardly know your own feelings better than I imagine them .
These five year I ha ' paid her .
Mrs <NAME> attributed certain views of furthering the marriage to my friend here , in conversation with me before it took place ; and I endeavoured to undeceive her .
As the whispers became louder , which they did from that time every minute , they became more threatening .
' I surprise you , sir ? ' he said , with a quick change to a submissive manner .
<NAME> has been out a dozen times , looking for you , <NAME> .
cried the Dodger at this moment , ' I heard the tinkler . '
And he and <NAME> led the way .
' Leave your nephew here , for the present .
This , my young companion -- ' ' Stop a bit , ' interposed <NAME> .
" Oh , yes , you tell me so , " returns <NAME> .
Yes , I always say so , ' Mrs. Gradgrind cried , with unexpected quickness .
You have n't got the family face . "
' A joke is wasted upon me , sir .
<NAME> and mould began to lurk in closets .
Because I wish to see you always at your best .
' Look here ! ' she said , striking the scar again , with a relentless hand .
I am going home. ' ' Deed , sir ?
It has not looked very long , when he sits up , chilled and shaking , slowly recovers consciousness of where he is , and makes himself ready to depart .
By and by , I saw him , with the majority of a lobster on his plate , eating his dinner at the feet of <NAME> !
I know the man , and know him to have been in communication with <NAME> before , respecting a deceased person who had given him offence .
I think he loves me better every day , and is kinder and more affectionate than he was the day before .
<NAME> ! ' exclaimed <NAME> , lost in astonishment , ' what is the meaning of this , <NAME> ?
They had determined not to admire <NAME> ' s picture .
But my younger daughter , <NAME> , rather worries and vexes my thoughts .
' But he is one of that family from whom you took a nurse .
The rolling wheels were noiseless , and the sharp ring and clatter of the horses ' hoofs , became a dull , muffled tramp .
Moreover it was her habit to shake her head at that wretched old boy whenever she caught his eye as he shivered and shook .
' <NAME> , ' said the visitor .
" My good <NAME> , so he was .
If I had been his wife , I could have been the slave of his caprices for a word of love a year .
<NAME> , down with him , fifty fathoms down ; his struggles grew fainter and fainter , until they wholly ceased .
Still , I must confess he is not without faults , love . "
I say it ' s obstinacy , and nothing shall ever convince me that it isn ' t .
My dear friend Mr <NAME> is dying. ' The dressmaker clasped her hands , and uttered a little piteous cry .
I am so accustomed to the habit that I could hardly live if I relinquished it : but there ' s nothing doing , nothing doing .
If you tell me that he is dead , I am in your debt and bound to you for life .
' I -- I -- remember it very well indeed. ' ' <NAME> is the lady I speak of , ' said brother Charles .
Do you know that you are talking to a gentleman , sir , who at one time could have bought up fifty such men as you and all you have ?
<NAME> <NAME> nods his sagacious head , advances it yet closer , and drops into a whisper .
Here one of you boys , carry that show into the barn .
inquired <NAME> , turning to the doctor .
Although <NAME> had been brought up by philosophers , he was not theoretically acquainted with the beautiful axiom that self-preservation is the first law of nature .
' Cause they had both stood betwixt him and his getting his living by the sweat of his brow .
' It strikes me rather as a hang-MAN air , ' returned <NAME> .
At sight of the young lady , <NAME> started and changed colour ; his heart beat violently , and he stood rooted to the spot .
cried the girl , pressing her hair back with her hands .
He might be , or he might not be .
The <NAME> going round with champagne , looks very much as if HE could give them a pretty good idea how people did that , if he had a mind .
' Anybody who didn ' t know you as well as I do , my dear fellow , would say you were an accomplished courtier , ' said <NAME> .
Such a precious loud hymn , <NAME> , while the tea was a brewing ; such a grace , such eatin ' and drinkin ' !
And then they began to fish .
<NAME> over that there bottle ! ' Here Mr <NAME> appeared to labour under a virtuous delusion that it was his own property .
' Oh , how good of you !
' I was going there , ' said the surly man .
" I always give too much to ladies .
I am going to take out the licence .
I will try , then , to forgive him his share of blame .
Five of 'em strung up in a row , and none left to play booty , or turn white-livered ! '
' She ' s very fond of you , <NAME> , though not so fond as I am .
The men obeyed , and the two were left alone together .
' Twenty pounds per annewum , I believe , Mr Squeers ? ' ' Guineas , ' rejoined the schoolmaster , with a persuasive smile .
' I have almost forgotten that there is anything to do in the world but to go out tossing on the sea here .
" If you think so , guardian , it is right . "
It seemed to her that she awoke after sleeping some hours , and found <NAME> not yet abed .
Have you , though ? ' returned <NAME> , his eyes sparkling with delight .
He could have laid hands upon himself for his cowardice , but it was the very shadow of his defeat , and could not be separated from it .
But the dead-and-gone Dedlocks take it very calmly and have never been known to object .
Let this be a warning to all young ladies to be particular in the character of the gentlemen of their choice .
She won ' t come in MY way , he says .
Where would you wish it taken from ? ' she answered , turning to him with the same enforced attention as before .
It is still Monday night. " " Thank God ! " " And you have all to-morrow , Tuesday , to rest in , " said <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> on his legs again .
<NAME> <NAME> had previously volunteered to go home with us and had withdrawn to dress himself for the purpose .
' Mr Merdle , this is -- ha -- indeed an honour .
But , he never mentioned her as a woman .
' They are very like their mamma , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , majestically .
He had turned the course of what he said at that instant , and she remained .
Still the <NAME> pointed downward to the grave by which it stood .
' I hope the gentleman will understand that it is n't my fault , sir ? '
Then , why don ' t they improve it , ma ' am !
All day long , little <NAME> has cried for her , and asked me , over and over again , whether <NAME> ' ly was wicked ?
' This is the hardest trial I have had .
But if the dear fellow can ' t live there , he can ' t live there .
Now , you know , so very prepossessing in the lady with the veil ! "
I heard him say so . '
6 , in the court. ' ' There is a double wallflower at <NAME> .
' I think it is a knock at the door , ' said <NAME> , as if there could be the smallest doubt of the fact .
' Very ill , <NAME> , have I been ? ' ' Dead , all but , ' replied the small servant .
" My dear , " said I , " as long as you wo n't hear me out -- " " I do n't want to hear you out . "
He dotes upon the children to the last and remembers the commission he has undertaken for an absent friend .
What does she try to do ?
' Do you see where we are ? ' ' Yes , my love .
It was a happy time .
He never smoked so late , and it seemed to hint to me that he wanted comforting , for some reason or other .
Nothing disagreeable should ever be looked at .
<NAME> , ' said I , bolting it out with some difficulty .
She only said , ' Oh , dear , dear <NAME> !
<NAME> , evermore. ' This , blotted with tears , was the letter .
His eyes were so often turned towards it , that he used his tools mechanically , and , one would have said , to very poor account .
<NAME> here , <NAME> , <NAME> .
he says we ' re dear , ' cried the oldest and ugliest teacher .
Softened regrets they might be , teaching me what I had failed to learn when my younger life was all before me , but not the less regrets .
'Do you mean to say anything , you young shaver ? '
Will you tell them to send him up ? "
Only come to see me as if you come by chance alonger <NAME> .
There was poison in the house .
But that is not the subject on which I wish to speak with you. ' ' Oh ! ' said <NAME> .
His mind was evidently wandering to his old life , for he continued to mutter , without appearing conscious of their presence otherwise than as a part of his vision .
This did not serve him ; for , at such bantering or retort as suited the company , he was no match for <NAME> .
I could n't be worse off if I was a what's-his-name -- man and a brother ! "
No , do n't ring -- I have been brought up in a sharp school and am accustomed to a variety of general practice .
I appeal to you , sir , ' proceeded <NAME> with increasing spirit , ' not to pursue me .
When she came there of an evening , she always shrunk from accepting his escort home , and ran away with me instead .
The honour is reciprocal , sir , as I usually say when I dramatise a book .
Make your own arrangements. ' ' Why , I was thinking that this evening would be a good time , <NAME> , when they are all sitting round the fire .
After all , the question is still where ? " " At extermination , " said madame .
The expression in the forehead , which had so particularly attracted his notice , and which was now immovable , had deepened into one of pain and horror .
He was a very easy , pleasant fellow indeed , and his manners were exceedingly winning .
<NAME> in the helpless state that you see me in , is naturally anxious .
The name has quite escaped me .
A substitute for a Fire .
But this latter <NAME> object ( in short sleeves ) always appeared to be the great inoffensive aim of her existence .
' Dear Nicholas , ' whispered <NAME> , who had been looking anxiously over his shoulder , ' can this be really the case ?
' Besides you , I mean , <NAME> , ' returned the craven <NAME> .
' I shall make him fetch and carry , my dear , and I shall make him subject to me .
When shall we look upon his like again ?
demanded <NAME> , pouring question upon question with great volubility .
I have none to spare myself , having to attend court very soon .
" Where have you been , you young monkey ? " said Mrs. <NAME> , stamping her foot .
asked <NAME> , adding , as <NAME> nodded assent , 'What name shall I tell my good friend . '
It ' s very comfortable , thank you. ' ' I have the pleasure of knowing Mr Dombey , ' observed <NAME> .
" Better now , " quoth <NAME> , motioning the lawyer to sit down and read to him alone .
<NAME> <NAME> 's thoughts take such form as he looks at her , with his ragged grey eyebrows a hair 's breadth more contracted than usual under her gaze .
' I am nobody ; do n't consult me , pray .
' What , haven ' t you seen her lately ? ' said <NAME> .
They were all three more sharply on the alert , and less deadened by the miserable influences of the place and time .
This going away was perhaps the very first action of their joint lives that they had got through without her .
He sat down beside me , taking some pains to sit on the form , I thought , in imitation of the print of his illustrious model on the sofa .
The morning hurry and flutter had been great ; for , long and anxiously as I had waited for <NAME> , his hint had come like a surprise at last .
A sad and desolate place it was , a gloomy , sorrowful place that gave me a strange sensation of mournfulness and even dread .
I don ' t want him any longer .
I brought him on purpose for you .
" What was your remark , my dear friend ? "
She will be glad to see you , if you will permit me to let her know that you are here. ' ' By all means , ' returned <NAME> .
" Well , sir , " says <NAME> .
At the top of the table , seated in an arm-chair rather higher than the rest , was a particularly fat gentleman with a very round , red face .
<NAME> occasioned the inexhaustible baby to square at him with the speckled fists , and demand in a threatening manner what he meant ?
' I 'll answer for that boy 's truth with my life ! '
' Exactly so , <NAME> , ' said Mr Toots , whose fervour of acquiescence was greatly heightened by his entire ignorance of the <NAME> ' s meaning .
Meanwhile <NAME> and <NAME> walk to and fro , quietly talking together .
He paused at the next door in the passage , and tapped gently thereat .
' And a little bit o ' cold beef , ' said the second coachman .
' No , ' said <NAME> , ' I ain ' t .
This had better be the end of it .
Do you make that of it ? " <NAME> answered , " Those are not the exact words. " " Not the exact words ! " repeated the gentleman bitterly .
It was yet night when she awoke , nor did she know how long , or for how short a time , she had slept .
Her thinness seemed to be the effect of some wasting fire within her , which found a vent in her gaunt eyes .
No book , no work , no occupation of any kind but her own thought , beguiled the tardy time .
Though it has not yet finally disappeared , it is dwindling daily .
' We can do it in a fortnight. ' ' No , I thank you .
cried Fagin , following him hastily .
You 're no trouble at all .
' And is gone , I know not where. ' ' He should ha ' stopped and fought it out , <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> contemptuously .
' Thank you ! ' He certainly never had seen this old woman before .
There was not one touch of tenderness or pity in it .
Take it from your mother ?
This is him as I have seen brought up by hand .
We who were left walked on towards the house .
' I respect you , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> with emotion .
I see none like them in that place , but he is admitted to be superior to all the rest .
' You needn ' t make yourself uncomfortable , ' remarked his wife , laughing heartily .
' Let me , oh do let me .
WHEN <NAME> awoke , it was so dark , that looking out of bed , he could scarcely distinguish the transparent window from the opaque walls of his chamber .
' God bless her , she is as easily scared as a bird , ' said I .
Then to go back , you know , and find him in the same cramped place. ' ' Ah yes !
<NAME> let me take these bags from you .
' He ' s very sorry for giving offence .
You are not " -- the apprehension came suddenly into his mind -- " a prisoner ? " " No .
It was his delight to help her , or to fancy that he did so , and they soon became close companions .
When the shop was closed , he took them out of his cap , hung his cap on the chair-back , and stood turning them over before the fire .
Of <NAME> , conflicting rumours went abroad .
' Confound these fellows ! ' thought <NAME> ; ' they have come to breakfast , I suppose .
<NAME> <NAME> allowed <NAME> to obey it , in silence .
I have a scheme to develop , little woman .
I have been offered and rejected , put up and appraised , until my very soul has sickened .
If I did think of it at odd moments now and then , I had only to be busy and forget it .
It were the Poison-bottle on table .
' Well , well ! ' returned <NAME> , with a patient , even a submissive , air .
There were some trifles there -- poor useless things -- that she would have liked to take away ; but that was impossible .
Her father privately married again -- his cook , I rather think. " " I thought he was proud , " said I .
I have shown you now , more plainly , that I do .
But now a fearful circumstance occurs .
<NAME> Whiffers then added that he feared a portion of this outrage might be traced to his own forbearing and accommodating disposition .
And we tell people that you have lived there , without so much as a day ' s or a night ' s absence , ever since .
<NAME> was his pride , that he indignantly took her away , as if from reproach and disgrace .
But these fears vanished before a well-trimmed lamp and the familiar aspect of her own room .
These arrangements completed , they give the women good night and come out once more into black and foul Tom-all-Alone 's .
This business was capitally described in the advertisement , <NAME> .
A joke ' s a joke. ' ' Upon my soul ! ' said the whelp .
" Would you allow me to get it filled for you ? "
' Oh , very , <NAME> , very , ' replied <NAME> .
" Well , gentlemen , " resumes the coroner .
I stopped where I was , among the leaves , and listened .
" You are very obliging , <NAME> .
Everybody knows me here. ' ' What will she do there ? ' inquired <NAME> .
<NAME> , poor me , poor me , my poor hand shakes like to drop off !
That ' s all. ' <NAME> rested his elbow on the arm of his chair , and shaded his face with his hand .
At one time we were all flung together in a heap at the bottom of the coach , and at another we were crushing our heads against the roof .
<NAME> and dark he found it .
'It 's all bought up as fast as it can be made , ' said the fellow .
Regarding that as done , is there nothing I can do for you yourself ? " " Nothing .
I thought of <NAME> : and a foolish , fearful fancy came upon me of his being near at hand , and liable to be met at any turn .
I wish your ladyship good day . "
About midnight I got out of bed and went to <NAME> , with the conviction that I had been asleep for four-and-twenty hours , and that Wednesday was past .
<NAME> , sir , ' said the girl .
This was <NAME> ' s party .
' I am glad you are so well satisfied , sir , ' was his calm remark .
" I am very sorry both to hear it and to see it , <NAME> . "
Echoing <NAME> A wonderful corner for echoes , it has been remarked , that corner where the <NAME> lived .
Let him keep to ' t .
Have you any idea of any cause that can have overset him ? ' ' You surprise me !
Do I know anything about your combinings ? ' ' No no , sir -- certainly not ; not by any means , ' returned <NAME> .
Be here all the earlier next morning . "
The confined entrance was so dark that it was impossible to make out distinctly what kind of person opened the door ; but it appeared to be an old woman .
' Well , Mr <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
If you ca n't get to be oncommon through going straight , you 'll never get to do it through going crooked .
' I do not pretend. ' ' Oh !
" But I 'll lime you , you dog , I 'll lime you ! "
' Do you , though ? ' said <NAME> , appearing to consider that fact in itself surprising .
<NAME> <NAME> had smoked his evening pipe and there were preparations for some supper by and by .
There she is ! ' In the strength of his misfortune , and the energy of his distress , he fired for the moment like a proud man .
A bitter taste it is that such poor cattle always have in their mouths , and hard lives they live , <NAME> .
I ' d take it by any force , I ' d have it at any price !
Three are to meet at the gatehouse to-night .
Then , he hastily proceeded to dispose the watches and jewellery beneath his clothing .
" Which I meantersay , " cried <NAME> , " that if you come into my place bull-baiting and badgering me , come out !
The <NAME> liked his answering with a smile ; it looked pleasant .
Down to -- ah , poor poor fellow ! -- to the end , he never received me but with something of his old merry boyish manner .
" Were you examined at an inquest ? "
Neither his brief consideration , nor its purport , was lost on his companion .
He could think of her being there , without a lurking misgiving that it would have been better if she had not come .
<NAME> n't only one wot can go up town .
" You copied some affidavits in that cause for me lately . "
' Twenty minutes past two , <NAME> , I set your watch at .
' A fool of <NAME> ! ' exclaimed <NAME> .
<NAME> 's breakfast for to-morrow , served out to be cooked .
You hear ; I think that ' s apology enough. ' ' You will not understand me , ' said <NAME> .
After a few moments of painful hesitation , I broke the silence .
We have said in walked <NAME> , but the statement is not distinguished by our usual scrupulous adherence to fact .
We knew the distinguishing marks of each vessel .
'Well , well , Mrs. Mann , ' he replied in a calmer tone ; 'it may be as you say ; it may be .
' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' here ' s Father !
' My dear , I have remained all night at my table , pondering again and again on what has so painfully passed between us .
Are you afraid to kiss me ? ' The answer is , the ready pressure of her lips upon the cold but smiling mouth .
He was in the full heat and bustle of concluding these operations , when his uncle , <NAME> , accosted him .
I travelled heer , and I travelled theer , but I found no Em ' ly , and I travelled home. ' ' How long ago ? ' I asked .
'Give me a shawl here .
' Shall I tell you , ' asked <NAME> , ' what I see down there ? ' ' Limited little b ? ' suggested <NAME> with her eyebrows raised .
Their looks were very sad , and might have moved the sternest visitor to tears , but not to that kind of sorrow which the contemplation of the men awakens .
This person wore a wig of short , coarse , red hair , which he took off with his hat , and hung upon a nail .
<NAME> bowed , said he was very well , and seemed very much astonished at the outward appearance of the proprietor of <NAME> Hall : as indeed he was .
I only meant did you want your horse minded. ' ' I ' m going to get down in the next street , ' returned the old gentleman .
Who 'll say as much as that , I should like to know ; eh , <NAME> ? '
I might have remembered it .
It stands in the corner of the poor field of wheat , which is full of great unsightly stumps , like earthy butchers ' -blocks .
I want to found an opinion on what you tell me .
He must be stopped somehow. " " You mean that you ca n't accept -- " " How can I ? " I interposed , as <NAME> paused .
' And this is the bed to which society consigns me , is it ?
On the other hand , the question was , not what he thought of the point , but what she thought of it .
But , when we went into the room , and it turned pale , she was ten thousand times prettier yet .
' Oh , certainly , depend upon me , ' said that gentleman aloud .
The family had left that part a week before ; they had called in such trifling debts as were outstanding , discharged them , and left the place by night .
Were they not ? ' ' When she told you you would be a judge ?
But I can go and earn some more , when I like ; ca n't I , <NAME> ? '
Finally , becoming cataleptic , she has to be carried up the narrow staircase like a grand piano .
' <NAME> , ' said my aunt , ' attention ! ' <NAME> recovered himself , with a blush .

If I had wanted anything by which to mark this night of our re-union , I should have found it in this .
' Get me money , ' he said wildly , as they parted for the night .
' What ' s her name ? ' inquired <NAME> .
I wish the whole school was here .
' Not a word. ' ' To him or anyone ? ' pursued the Manager .

Not quite so charming to see their smiling faces fall and brood as they dropped moodily into separate corners of their little carriage .
said <NAME> , turning round , and addressing <NAME> , after he had bolted the door behind them .
Another soft knock at the outer door attracts his attention as he goes down-stairs .
' Wot ' s the matter now ? ' said <NAME> .
I haven ' t any great liking for that. ' ' No , to be sure , ' he assented .
He was going to say " to a shade , " but substituted this , as more appropriate .
The opportunity that the day 's rest had given me for reflection had resulted in my fully determining to say nothing to him respecting <NAME> .
If it was his whim to surprise us , his whim succeeded .

It shall be made to pay ; don ' t you be afraid .
' I can ' t get up , ' said the child , ' because my back ' s bad , and my legs are queer .
' Are you satisfied with that , or shall I finish it a little more ? ' said <NAME> , showing the sketch to Mr Dombey .
One face , and not an agreeable one , though it was handsome , seemed maliciously watchful of this pretty girl , and indeed of every one and everything there .
I have no idea whether this took any time .
' Here , you Smike ; take away now .
" Why , he paid you for them , you know , and handsome too , " says <NAME> .
There was no sound inside .
" Well , " returns the old man , " it 's true that I do n't see company , <NAME> , and that I do n't treat .
The horseman had gone forward to have coffee and some eatables prepared , and they were by this time nearly ready .

'Oh , he wo n't speak out , wo n't he ? '
' <NAME> in love ! ' repeated my aunt .
But the small servant immediately pausing in her talk , he subsided again , and pleading a momentary forgetfulness of their compact , entreated her to proceed .
I am obliged to go to London. ' In less than another minute she was on her road to the railway , under <NAME> ' s protection .

Put it that I take an inventory , or make a catalogue .
I am paid for undertaking it , and I do so .
He washed , and was cured .
<NAME> left alone , laid her head upon her hand , and pressing the other over her swelling heart , held free communication with her sorrows .
I beg your pardon , <NAME> .
You have seen my sister oftener and oftener .
" This is my lodger , <NAME> , " says <NAME> , nodding at her .
wo n't his manners do then ? " asked <NAME> , plucking a black-currant leaf .
' A little , <NAME> , ' replied that gentleman .
Still very pale , she is dressed in slight mourning and wears two beautiful bracelets .
<NAME> is confident that he invented that forcible figure—would fall to pieces .
<NAME> <NAME> listens , starts from his chair , and catches a young fellow in his arms , exclaiming : ' My dear Edwin ! ' ' My dear Jack !
And I am sorry to say I have known them cruel to their wives too . "
' Oh yes I have , I have my faults , no man knows his faults better than I know mine .

He hears that his innocence is established , and that he is pardoned .

" You are a little late , <NAME> , " said <NAME> .
<NAME> saw him put it there .
It was the one grain of relief I had .
I never was responsible in my life -- I ca n't be . "
Come and ask her if she is better ; come and ask her to lie down .
' Nothing , ' Tilda , ' replied <NAME> , sobbing .
As you , of course , have not forgotten that he did. ' She watched him still attentively .
' We never can be here. ' ' No , we never can again -- never again -- that ' s truly said , ' rejoined the old man .

" One in-door , and three out .
'How well he looks , and how like a gentleman 's son he is dressed again !
The sadness of the scene imparted a sombre tinge to the feelings of <NAME> .
She had been saying all the while , " Let me go ! "

<NAME> , and repent of it .
But he shuts out the now chilled air , draws the window-curtain , goes to bed , and falls asleep .
' So she is , ' said <NAME> , ' so she is .
' I will wait , if you please , for I want to speak to her. ' ' Do you ? ' returned <NAME> .
We thought it a pity he should go away .
' No , thank you ! ' said <NAME> , coldly , as I mechanically offered them back to him .
" What do you say , <NAME> ? "
They moved so gently , that their footsteps made no noise ; but there were sobs from among the group , and sounds of grief and mourning .

Oliver knew this too well ; but thinking it might be dangerous to express his feelings more openly , he only sighed , and went on with his boot-cleaning .
'Yes , sir , ' replied <NAME> , in a low , tremulous voice .
A dry subject for a young lady , but an important subject too .
' I am a demd villain ! ' cried <NAME> , smiting himself on the head .
When I came here today , I thought that nothing could have wrested this confession from me .
Not for your sake , but for the sake of others .
Such were Mr Quilp ' s first proceedings on entering upon his new property .
All this she did without looking at me .
In this family we are all children , and I am the youngest . "
I am the umble instrument of umbly serving him , and he puts me on an eminence I hardly could have hoped to reach .
I have been looking everywhere for my bench , and I ca n't find it .
' Only a bob ' s vorth , <NAME> , ' cried the driver sulkily , for the information of his friend the waterman , as the cab drove off .

The appearances , beyond all rational doubt , observed in that case are the appearances observed in <NAME> 's case .
When <NAME> and the unfortunate Prince found an opportunity to become betrothed I do n't know , but they certainly found none on this occasion to exchange a dozen words .
Dear Mr Clennam , don ' t let me see you weep !
Shall I ever forget the morning I looked scornfully at him when he offered to carry my parasol ?
The <NAME> pointed as before .
He has no curiosity or care for the scene about him , and always speaks to the girl .
He had no wife to call in and astonish , so he rang the bell for his servant .
Do you think it good ? -- Warn her father against me .
' Hum -- eh -- what ' s that ? ' said the strange man .
' <NAME> , ' retorted <NAME> , colouring , ' is a wicked , impudent , bold-faced hussy. ' ' What ' s that ? ' inquired <NAME> .
<NAME> father said anything particular to you to-day or yesterday , <NAME> ? ' ' <NAME> , <NAME> .

' Con-found it , no , ' rejoined <NAME> , stopping for an instant to smash a fly with the ruler .
The screen still goes , as before .
When he loves his Florence most , he will hate me least .
I deplored the untimely death of <NAME> , most sincerely , and shed tears in doing so .
I admire her -- as my friend does -- exceedingly .
My time is nearly all devoted to some very intimate friends .
You can have as much flirting as you like -- at your Boffins .
'Indeed I do n't know , sir , ' replied <NAME> .
It ' s not possible. ' ' No , <NAME> ' am , ' said <NAME> ' No more did my Uncle ' s child .
' As silent a feller as myself .
' Uncle , ' said <NAME> , when she judged they must be near their destination , ' I must ask one question of you .
By degrees , the shutters were opened ; the window-blinds were drawn up ; and people began passing to and fro .
I found him in his dressing-room surrounded by his stock of boots , already hard at it , washing his hands of us .

That this correspondence with the public enemy was not a correspondence of to-day , or of yesterday , or even of last year , or of the year before .
They think me a long way off , and if I went wholly unexpected , I should frighten them .

What could have made them so late ?
The house in <NAME> Inn had bills in the windows announcing that it was to let , and it looked dirtier and gloomier and ghastlier than ever .
Never clapped eyes upon her ! " " Goodness , uncle !
' Em ' ly ' s her name , ' said <NAME> , ' and she ' s little too .
The name pleased him , or suited him as well as any other , and the Bachelor he had ever since remained .
As he is not here , to-morrow will be time enough . '
" Not if to lift this glass would do it !
' Now , my men , ' said the single gentleman ; ' you have done very well .
" That 'll do , my good friend ! "
If you do n't like it , I ca n't help it .

' Give them a glass of wine each to drink the toast in .
On the road I have suffered a great deal .
The boy , <NAME> , was training for and with a schoolmaster .

' Though I am old and ugly now , -- much older by life and habit than years though , -- I was once as young as any .
<NAME> water is in general request at the office next day , and most of the party deem the bill an imposition .
" I am sorry , " says <NAME> , " to have touched so sore a place . "
It struck cold and damp , but was not dark .
She ' d deny it , and so would my master .
' Not contented , <NAME> , ' said Mr Chuckster , ' with making friends with <NAME> , he has cultivated the acquaintance of his father and mother .
When you know that she only does it out of kindness and the best intentions !
But I felt that the kiss was given to the coarse common boy as a piece of money might have been , and that it was worth nothing .
And yet -- and yet -- she sends a look in that direction as if it were her heart 's desire to have that figure moved out of the way .
' Is it Justice with the bandage off her eyes , and without the sword and scales ?
It was a temperance song ( whirlwinds of cheers ) .
Little <NAME> is waiting for the coroner and jury on their return .
But now , <NAME> arrived .
What _could_ the boy be crying for ?
She has her friend and counsellor always near . "
No ; I repudiate the title !
<NAME> , on that unfortunate occasion , commits himself under provocation. ' ' And under mulled wine , ' added the old lady .
He complied , and I went on alone .
' You mean that in that case I must pay the damages ? ' said <NAME> , who had watched this telegraphic answer with considerable sternness .
Batter the gate once more ! ' He stood listening intently , but the noise was not renewed .
( Gusty weather with deceitful calms .
Are you her ladyship 's property , or somebody else 's ?
Shall I give you a ride , <NAME> ?
" Anyhow , here I stand , this present day , <NAME> married to <NAME> 's widder .
<NAME> clamps and girders , fire-proof from top to bottom ; mechanical lifts for the housemaids , with all their brushes and brooms ; everything that heart could desire .
It is to be hoped they will still continue happy .
And so I said yes , if it was no harm , and she said no -- no harm .
But he wore out , poor man , so I have appointed his successor .
<NAME> <NAME> looked at me , and I looked at her and said I was indeed .
Pictures and prints of vessels fighting with the rolling waves filled her with alarm .
Come -- to play. " " Come nearer ; let me look at you .
" Yes , dearest. " " Yes , citizen. " " Ah !
<NAME> retired behind his elbow at first , but relented at the sight of sponge-cake and allowed me to take him on my lap , where he sat munching quietly .
A profound silence was observed during the ride .
So make her comfortable. ' ' Thank you very much , sir , ' that discreet lady observed , ' but pray do not let My comfort be a consideration .
And the communication I have got to make is , that he has great expectations. " <NAME> and I gasped , and looked at one another .
My appetite vanished instantly , and I knew no peace or rest until the day arrived .
' I believe every word you have said , ' he returned .
Without I was informed agen , the danger ai n't so much to signify .
" She was a noble vessel .
And the one that went on only went on a certain way agreed upon to deceive and then turned across country and went home .
<NAME> took no notice of either of us , but led us the way that I knew so well .
You would then have been my ward until you were of age .
This is an unseasonable hour , but here is a young woman who has been making statements which render my visit necessary .
<NAME> told him it was between two and three .
' His ascendancy over papa , ' said <NAME> , ' is very great .
' Dear Arthur , ' said her delighted voice outside the door , ' I have some one here .
Yes , it was ; there they were .
<NAME> firm , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , looking down .
' A positive fool , ' said <NAME> .
Why , we ain ' t had such a thing happen here , my dear , not for I couldn ' t name the time when .
'As you like , my dear , as you like ' replied the Jew .
' It was at that time that mama was most solicitous about my <NAME> .
She detested us , she was miserable with us , she couldn ' t bear it , she wouldn ' t bear it , she was determined to go away .
<NAME> back , look back , and see if we are pursued !
' Good night , sir , good night , ' cried the lawyer , retreating backwards towards the door .
' I ' ll see this <NAME> and <NAME> !
I never saw her more .
" <NAME> , " said <NAME> , clasping his hands , " that no one near and dear to me is in this dreadful town to-night .
R. <NAME> locked up his desk one evening , and , putting his bunch of keys in his pocket much as if it were his peg-top , made for home .
" But our Defarge , " said <NAME> , " is undoubtedly a good <NAME> ?
" Slander those who tell it ye !
' My mama departed this life , ' said Mrs. Micawber , ' before <NAME> ' s difficulties commenced , or at least before they became pressing .

<NAME> _he_ think of his neighbour too ?
<NAME> and affable as man could be , Mr <NAME> picked his way along the streets and hummed a soft tune as he went .
There might be medical doctors at the present hour , a picking up their guineas where a honest tradesman do n't pick up his fardens -- fardens !
He was to be another father to him , and they were all to live together in a garden of roses , weren ' t they ?
He has exhausted his resources and is bound henceforward to the tree he has planted . "
' You ' re one of the thort , <NAME> , that keepth a prethiouth thight of money out of the houthe .
' " Was it a large one ? " inquired <NAME> .
" It is noble in you to tell me that you have other causes of unhappiness .
'Here they are , ' replied <NAME> , producing a pair of pistols .
The time came , without bringing with it any relief to my feelings , and the company came .
' I tell you I have a presentiment that it must be a girl , ' returned <NAME> .
' But no , not he ! ' says <NAME> of the no surname , clinching the quartette .
Watch-guards and toasting-forks were alike at a discount , and pencil-cases and sponges were a drug in the market .
' Yes , ' rejoined <NAME> , looking round for an instant , and immediately carrying his eyes back again to the ceiling .
It made me giddy and faint in a moment .
But what could I do ?
inquires the stationer with his cough of sympathy .
That gently done , he called to him <NAME> and <NAME> .
Permit me to inquire the name of the magistrate who offers a gratuitous and unprovoked insult to a respectable person , under the protection of the bench . '
" Why , no , sir , I could n't .
<NAME> , reassured , falls to rubbing his legs .
I am <NAME> mere child , sir .
' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , at length breaking the silence , ' you were right , and I was wrong .
<NAME> upon that , for she would lay her own fair head beside her husband 's cheerfully. " He faltered for an instant ; then went on as before .
Not changing his action even then , he opened and shut the palms of his hands as he warmed them , and looked down at it .
Yes , he was the Father of the place .
<NAME> in the deepening gloom looks down upon the ground , half frightened and half shy .
" I wish <NAME> was dead ! "
<NAME> , that you could remember , long ago , another child who loved you dearly , you being but a child yourself .
That I could not absolutely pledge myself to like it , until I knew something more about it .
' <NAME> ' t , <NAME> ' ly ! ' said <NAME> , tapping her gently on the shoulder .
' There , poor dear ! ' ' Oh well , <NAME> !
Along the crowded path they bore her now ; pure as the newly-fallen snow that covered it ; whose day on earth had been as fleeting .
It won ' t do ; I told the clerk when I took my places that it wouldn ' t do .
" From the market-gardens down by <NAME> .
<NAME> , and <NAME> and Means , you ' re all up in , so we shall only want one rehearsal .
The clerk in the <NAME> involuntarily applauded .
And will you tell them all that I have thought of them every day , and that my heart is faithful to them everywhere ?
He carried so very attentive an expression on his countenance that it appeared as if the confidential discourse of the big stick required to be followed closely .
He does nothing steadily or patiently ; but equally takes things up and throws them down , and does them , or leaves them undone , without caring about them .
This is not your resolution ; call it up , <NAME> , call it up ! "
' They won ' t let you be more than a Casual there .
' Well , I ' m pretty well , thank ' ee , <NAME> , ' said Mr Toots .
<NAME> smiled and lifted up his arm to touch him as he stood behind the head of the couch .
He had left her in her father ' s room within an hour .
' Oh indeed , ma ' am , ' thought <NAME> , ' you have been pining , have you ?
' I look sharply after most men that I deal with , and most of all I looked sharply after you .
<NAME> praised <NAME> more to me that night than ever she had praised him yet .
' <NAME> , you Sir ! ' shouted <NAME> fiercely .
He quickened his pace ; but before he reached her , she turned her head .
<NAME> is the dread power of the man , and so terribly evident it is that he makes no idle boast , that <NAME> begins to apologize .
Next to accepting a large sum on the spot , I believe this gave <NAME> more comfort than anything I could have done .
So the two old schoolfellows felt it to be , as , their dinner done , they turned towards the fire to smoke .
' Here I am , sir. ' ' And our friend of the perspiring brow is at the far corner there ?
It still increased , until our horses could scarcely face the wind .
" My friends , " says <NAME> , looking round him in conclusion , " I will not proceed with my young friend now .
We may be reckoning without our host in all this , ' he added more cheerfully , ' and I trust , and almost believe we are .
' I don ' t know how it is , <NAME> ; I seem to want some faculty of mind that I ought to have .
<NAME> <NAME> , charmed to see you .
Am I never to throw it off ?
' A little drop of spirits , master , if it 's all the same , ' replied <NAME> .
A speck in the mist , at last !
' We don ' t know , ' said <NAME> , answering this mute appeal aloud .
' N-not particularly so , I think , sir , ' rejoined <NAME> , with his teeth chattering in his head .
' <NAME> , ' cried <NAME> , when this sound met her ear , ' make haste , for <NAME> ' s sake , he will destroy himself !
He will certainly help us to a new livelihood .
When should I awaken the heart within her that was mute and sleeping now ?
' They are strangers in this part of the town , <NAME> .
I expected , every day , that my guardian might speak to me about the letter , but he never did .
' You accidentally saw a young lady in this room one morning , my dear sir , in a fainting fit .
On these national occasions dancing may be a patriotic service , and <NAME> is constantly seen hopping about for the good of an ungrateful and unpensioning country .
Still , very steadfastly and quietly walking towards it , a peaceful figure too in the landscape , went <NAME> , shoeless , through the wet grass .
Shall it be done ? ' ' It shall , sir , ' said <NAME> .
I have seen so much business done on sharp principles that , to tell you the truth , Mr <NAME> , I am tired of them. ' Mr <NAME> laughed .
" No , " returns his friend ; " if it 's nothing worse than this , I withdraw the observation . "
But the moment <NAME> understood the full extent of his misfortune , self-preservation dictated an attempt at flight .
' A milliner and dressmaker , ma ' am , ' replied <NAME> .
' Blessed if she didn ' t send ' em all to sleep till twelve hours arter the election was over .
Whether it was possible in a <NAME> country to get on without blood , after this , was a question on which the Finches were divided .
It was a picture of cold , silent decay .
His walking did not bring him home until the dawn of day .
<NAME> ' t you better be seated ?
I writed some words to <NAME> , ' an air of novelty came over Mr Pancks with this designation , ' to come and help .
The visitor said that was well , and he would return for the information , relying on its being obtained .
I know what it is , sir .
I was very sorry , but there was a higher consideration than sense .
We arranged a time for <NAME> to come out by the coach and share my early dinner .
The procession then reformed ; the chairmen resumed their stations ; and the march was re- commenced .
' They are not worth your notice , ' said the dismal man .
Let her come and go , unobserved and unquestioned .
It ' s made out of a boat ! ' ' Made out of a boat , is it ? ' said <NAME> .
<NAME> and less respectable men might fall short of that mark , but Mr <NAME> was always up to it .
' I try to believe and hope so still .
Affery was the first to move , and she , wringing her hands , pursued her mistress .
The sick man laid his hand upon his attendant ' s arm , and motioned him to stop .
' Yes , I think it ' ll do , ' said <NAME> .
What a launch in life I think it now , on looking back , to be so mean and servile to a man of such parts and pretensions !
" 'Doctor , they are very proud , these <NAME> ; but we common dogs are proud too , sometimes .
I hope that contents you. ' ' Upon your soul ? ' said <NAME> .
A part of the bone came out .
So , at six o ' clock that evening , which was one of the early office evenings , I announced myself as ready , to <NAME> .
While the meal was in progress , their host remarked that the old man seemed much fatigued , and evidently stood in need of rest .
' I hardly know -- I -- I am much obliged , Sir. ' ' He needn ' t wait , <NAME> , ' said Mr Dombey .
'Your behaviour has ever been kind and noble . '
But that lady , kissing me , and making me put them back in my pocket , replied that she couldn ' t think of it .
These articles having been promptly supplied , he walked on direct towards Leadenhall <NAME> at a good round pace , very different from his recent lingering one .
I have been so , many years .
The roof yet vibrated with the cheering , when the assembly dispersed .
For <NAME> wos wery good to me too , and I knows it . "
I knew from her own lips that she regarded herself as the innocent cause of his errors , and as owing him a great debt she ardently desired to pay .
' Yes -- yes ; I almost forgot , I do declare. ' ' I thought you were forgetting , ' said <NAME> .
I should have done it before now , if I hadn ' t been afraid of making bad worse .
If she had ever had the virtue in her , it had quite gone out of her .
They were in high good-humour ; and one of them , a little , weazen , hump-backed man , began to dance .
'She has formed no other attachment ? '
I would have spared you the degradation , but we must hear them from your own lips before we part , and you know why . '
' Now , my reliance is on you. ' ' But it must not be on me , <NAME> , ' returned <NAME> , with a pleasant smile .
Struck by the energy of her manner , <NAME> looked up in her face with great surprise .
He tells her , in acknowledgment of her many subdued thanks , that she is very welcome , gives her good day , and walks away .
Mr Feeder says he has no doubt of it .
' I have a crotchet in my head that it must be so .
' I say I wonder <NAME> didn ' t take you with him , dear. ' ' Never you mind , <NAME> , ' returned the <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> pointed to it , and admonished him to take it up .
And when you used him shamefully , I took his part and loved him -- There !
It portended that there was one stone face too many , up at the chateau .
He never thought of <NAME> .
So I said as much .
They had no other friends or home to leave , he said , and had come to share his fortunes .
Everybody was excited , except the fat boy , and he slept as soundly as if the roaring of cannon were his ordinary lullaby .
' <NAME> ! ' cried <NAME> , ' where is that fellow , <NAME> ? ' But not a word said <NAME> .
The time has flown. ' ' You ' re a brute ! ' exclaimed <NAME> .
My aunt and I were at that time vacating the two cottages at <NAME> ; I intending to go abroad , and she to return to her house at <NAME> .
I put my hand upon her head , and touched her forehead , and said it was hot now but would be cool to-morrow .
If our observant lady readers can deduce any satisfactory inferences from these facts , we beg them by all means to do so .
<NAME> elevates his one eyebrow , and after respectfully staring at his master to express interest , swallows a great gulp of coffee , still staring at him .
The first time he came to our old place was when my father was alive .
<NAME> was in his inner room , his sanctuary of sanctuaries , the <NAME> to the crowd of worshippers in the suite of rooms without .
And yet , through the very limited means of expression that he possessed , he seemed to express kindness .
I have already said , sir , that I have had my suspicions of <NAME> , in reference to <NAME> , for some time .
' What you will , <NAME> , ' she answered , without turning her head , and with supreme indifference .
Perhaps you may be interested , <NAME> , " continued <NAME> , leading the way into the next drawing-room , " in this portrait of <NAME> .
' <NAME> ' ee , <NAME> , ' returned the <NAME> .
If you will hold the candle for <NAME> , my friend , he 'll soon see whether there is anything to help you . "
Then we all went to <NAME> , a narrow alley at a very short distance .
I must tell you how it was .
" When I ask what I am to call myself to-day , <NAME> , " I went on , " I suggest what I have in my thoughts .
But he did not hint to me that when I had been better looking he had had this same proceeding in his thoughts and had refrained from it .
We had better not say anything having the appearance of a remonstrance or condition ; it might not seem generous .
For what says the <NAME> ?
He do n't make himself comfortable with it .
I mean to burn him at last. ' ' Ha ha ! ' cried <NAME> .
Many accounts and account-books , many files of correspondence , and several strong boxes , garnished <NAME> ' s room .
I trust it confidently to your not suppressing anything .
you needn ' t mind reading that , ' interrupted the client .
<NAME> , this has been a dreadful day !
Mr <NAME> replied to it accordingly .
' Oh come away ! ' said <NAME> , ' they are quarrelling .
I have to begin the world . "
Then I go among the <NAME> .
<NAME> , on the first morning of my so auspiciously beginning life on my own account , the oldest of the regular boys was summoned to show me my business .
Being asked what he thinks of the proceedings , characterizes them ( his strength lying in a slangular direction ) as " a rummy start . "
She was a formidable style of lady with spectacles , a prominent nose , and a loud voice , who had the effect of wanting a great deal of room .
' Hold up ! ' said the stout old <NAME> , as <NAME> dived head foremost into his capacious waistcoat .
inquired the beadle , affectionately pressing her hand .
There was some secret , sure perception between them , which set them against one another in all ways .
Is it blank cartridge or ball ?
The room was a pleasant one , at the top of the house , overlooking the sea , on which the moon was shining brilliantly .
I believe I had at this time some lurking distrust of <NAME> .
The <NAME> gets first to the mountain , and waits for the <NAME> people to come up ; both sets of passengers being conveyed across it at the same time .
From whence have we derived that spiritual profit ?
' You see what a dry , shrivelled , withered old chip it is , ' returned <NAME> , when the other was at length silent .
