And when you can do better , you will ?
' It ' s like puttin ' gas in a balloon .
' I ' ve got him , hard and fast. ' ' Wa ' at ! ' exclaimed <NAME> , pushing away his plate .
' Have I called you down from the stars ? ' ' No , ' he answered .
What can I have to do with the name ?
<NAME> was sorry to miss our good friend Mr Sparkler to-day , Mr Merdle .
' Any maker ' s name ? ' ' Brown. ' ' Where of ? ' ' <NAME> .
' A man does get more way upon himself , perhaps , in his conversation , when he sits down .
' She will miss it when she wakes .
'The girl 's gone mad , I think , ' replied <NAME> , savagely .
She began piteously declaring that she did n't mean any harm , she did n't mean any harm , Mrs. Snagsby !
For which reason <NAME> ' s eyes drooped more engrossedly over her book , and she turned the page with an air of profound absorption in it .
Only one man in the crowd cried ' No ! ' and he was promptly taken into custody , and straightway borne off .
You can hardly think how kind she is to me , and what pains she takes with me .
There has been a delay. ' ' Not that it is of consequence , ' said <NAME> .
I shall be as merry as a grig among these gentry .
But the peace and rest of the old Sunday morning were on everything , except me .
Mrs <NAME> had some such thoughts too , but they were not so quietly developed in her mind .
Not , you see , to look at. ' ' Not azackly , ' observed <NAME> .
We journeymen must take jobs when we can get them .
There was yet another circumstance which went a long way to confirm <NAME> in her fears , though it was not a great circumstance in itself .
<NAME> both , and sorely puzzled too , to find out what they seek .
Then why not have it : especially when our friend <NAME> here would profit by it too ?
' I can ' t see you running into danger , through carrying your head so high .
It was at a distance towards the east , but it was long and loud .
I may claim to have felt it , at least as much as anybody else ; and I would fain be remembered kindly for my part in the experience .
At the same time—not to deceive you—I believe I am worthy of her .
The messenger fortunately found <NAME> in court , regaling himself , business being rather slack , with a cold collation of an Abernethy biscuit and a saveloy .
He dreams that the footsteps die away into distance of time and of space , and that something touches him , and that something falls from his hand .
" Let me hope a moment !
I had scarcely thought it a reservation a few hours ago , but now that it was gone I felt as if I understood its nature better .
<NAME> <NAME> did not remain long in the background after they had reached the drawing-room , for Dr Blimber had him out in no time , dancing with <NAME> .
" Do you know the <NAME> 's , in the next street but one , at the corner ? "
Sometimes he would ask her for herself .
It was not until every preparation was made for <NAME> ' s immediate removal that <NAME> broke silence by declaring she should not be taken away .
' They are here now , ' said <NAME> , rising and hurrying away .
cried <NAME> , calling downward to a boy in Sunday clothes , who perhaps had loitered in to look about him .
If it could not be done with <NAME> ' s sanction and concurrence , I besought a clandestine interview in the back kitchen where the <NAME> was .
' I am here by myself , myself .
If her mother ' s consolations could have restored her to a pleasanter and more enviable state of mind , there were abundance of them to produce the effect .
Come ! ' ' I never heard it said , <NAME> , ' returned the <NAME> .
I acknowledge -- let me be open -- that it is my failing to be the creature of impulse , and to wear my heart as it were , outside .
' _I_ pray to Heaven it may turn out so ! ' repeated <NAME> .
But he ' ll soon be home for good , now .
I am pretty well known .
That very popular trust in flat things coming round !
' Is it , indeed ? ' rejoined <NAME> .
' I -- hem ! -- I can ' t think , <NAME> , what has given <NAME> offence .
When we came to the usual place of meeting -- it was close by , and <NAME> had often accompanied me before -- my guardian was not there .
Furious with terror , he raised his stick , and struck <NAME> a heavy blow across the face .
At the same moment , a small boy clung tight round his leg , and a shrill cry of ' Here he is , father !
' Twelve year , ' replied the cobbler , biting the end of his pipe as he spoke .
' I had conquered it , knowing that it _must_ be conquered , and had come to the resolution to think no more about it .
She sat upright in her arm-chair , with a stately , immovable , passionless air , that it seemed as if nothing could disturb .
That ' s my view of the matter , <NAME> Pickwick. ' ' It is a very philosophical one , ' replied <NAME> .
What could <NAME> do ?
' Here ' s wishing of her back agin. ' Polly cried more than ever at this .
' I know you are unhappy , and have got into great trouble by bringing me away .
I hated her then , quite as much as I hate her now ; and naturally , therefore , could desire nothing better than that she should marry him .
Well ; I got the better of it , and went on sorting , and went on singing to myself .
You know I stood between you and his father so long , that it seems as if death had made no difference , and I was still standing between you .
' The house with the red door , cabmin .
' One of them things that young men do when they get married , ' returned <NAME> ; ' and as runs through with their money like nothing at all !
Go it , <NAME> ! ' ' What you may mean , <NAME> , by your omnibus-driving expressions , I can not pretend to imagine .
And now you must tell me , dearest Ma and <NAME> , upon your words and honours !
' They brighten at the sight of you , ' returned <NAME> .
' <NAME> down , ' said <NAME> , turning towards him , as though by a violent effort .
I am going to speak upon another subject , a confidential subject , <NAME> .
May I speak out , among friends ?
The placid look at the white ceiling came back , and passed away , and his head dropped quietly on his breast .
I confess that I looked upon this as a very painful exhibition , and one by no means flattering to the national standard of honesty and honour .
<NAME> ' t take any notice of it , ' said <NAME> , peeping in from the bedroom .
' The fact is , it ain ' t a Hall , ' observed <NAME> drily .
' We are all as happy as possible ! ' said <NAME> .
The responsibility of giving the lady away devolved upon the <NAME> , which led to the clergyman 's being unintentionally scandalized , and it happened thus .
He was reconciled to what had happened , and went down again quite happy .
To make these dwellings as habitable and full of comfort as they could , was now their pleasant care .
Have the goodness to confine your dealings strictly to trade and business , and not to travel beyond it .
Official sentiments are one thing .
' But I say yes , ' returned his friend .
<NAME> as <NAME> , boy ! ' said <NAME> , taking snuff from a round box on the table , and laughing heartily .
<NAME> would see that the boys were fond of him ; and that would make her happy .
' Assuredly , <NAME> is an oracle !
He can speak of nothing else .
Did you ever taste beer ? ' ' I had a sip of it once , ' said the small servant .
Perhaps -- who shall decide on such mysteries ! -- he was afraid that he might come to hate her .
' I ' m a bacheldore. ' ' A bachelor ! ' I said , astonished .
' Why would you ? ' ' If you please , sir , I am very fond of flowers , ' returned the girl .
He was familiar with him , in the very extremity of his sense of the distance between them .

" I should like to walk a little , " says my Lady , still looking out of her window .
' You come on business , sir .
" You do n't object to him , little woman ? "
' Let ' s hear what <NAME> did. ' He did not appear to have hidden anything , so went off rather flatly .
Mr <NAME> ? ' ' Perfectly , sir , ' returned Mr Sparkler .
' I told you before , ' replied <NAME> , 'that I was afraid to speak to you there .
' I think they must certainly come to-morrow , eh mother ? ' said <NAME> , laying aside his hat with a weary air and sighing as he spoke .
' To be sure you didn ' t , ' said the little old man ; ' of course not .
The coach was punctual to the time appointed ; and <NAME> , after duly installing <NAME> and <NAME> inside , took his seat on the box by the driver .
croaked the Jew , in his usual voice .
retorts <NAME> with a steadfast look , but without loss of temper .
' There were three things , ' said <NAME> , ' that I thought I would like to say , if you were alone and I might come up-stairs .
He is not hungry , Mrs. Bedwin , ' said the gentleman : looking very wise .
You know how sensitive I am to unkindness .
' And very much to be deplored it was , on all accounts !
Not such power of wind has blown for many a winter night .
' But , first and foremost , <NAME> , burn the box .
' O , pray don ' t punish him any more , ' cried <NAME> .
We don ' t want any documents .
' Here ' s sport ! ' he cried , ' sport ready to my hand , all invented and arranged , and only to be enjoyed .
The family room looked very small and very mean , and the downward staircase by which it was attained looked very narrow and very crooked .
' I couldn ' t write like that , now-a-days .
To give himself up to being put in the way of arning a good living and getting on , he must give me up .
' Peek -- christian name ; Weeks -- surname ; good , ver good .
Try the antidote , ' rejoined <NAME> ; ' and may it give you a brighter and better view of the case !
The trial came on at once , and , when he was put to the bar , he was seated in a chair .
' Jupiter ! ' exclaimed <NAME> , ' what an unsophisticated shepherd you are , <NAME> !
She had a curious propensity to call Mrs. Bounderby ' Miss Gradgrind , ' and yielded to it some three or four score times in the course of the evening .
' He does not seem to see us .
Or that night , when I frowned at him ?
' " Will you never love any one but me -- never marry any one beside ? " said the young lady .
' I didn ' t do anything in particular , ' said <NAME> .
However , men always think they know best .
Sometimes she ' s proud and won ' t touch it for a length of time ; sometimes she ' s so poor that she must have it .
' You shall not escape me in this way , you morose backwoodsman , ' retorts <NAME> .
' The next I make for you , I hope will be made less clumsily .
' Good master ? ' inquired <NAME> .
Both of us did business with him .
Why , from you. " " I never told you. " " Told me !
<NAME> in <NAME> , one of the great lords in power at the Court , held his fortnightly reception in his grand hotel in <NAME> .
He needed some such touch then .

There was a kettle on the hob , as there had been night and day for fifteen years .
It is singularly well conducted by <NAME> , a comic actor of great quiet humour and originality , who is well remembered and esteemed by <NAME> playgoers .
What did you expect me to do ?
It will naturally be very painful to him to find that you are singular in your character and conduct .
You have regularly given me up .
Also that I can accept no second or inferior position .
No man 's life here is worth purchase .
So they told him yes again .
' He don ' t seem to care about his dress , ' thought <NAME> , ' and yet how capitally he does it .
So goes the wintry day outside the <NAME> mansion .
' If you please. ' ' Or would next day , ' said Mr Dombey , ' suit your engagements better ? ' ' I have no engagements .
' It was <NAME> who did that , I KNOW , ' said <NAME> predictively .
Thank you , thank you. ' He felt that it was better to respect her entreaty , and did not move while her slight form went quickly away from him .
said <NAME> , stirring his tea , and looking up into the matron 's face ; 'are _you_ hard-hearted , Mrs .
I am going there now for my lesson .
" Very good ; I see by these portraits that you take a strong interest in the fashionable great , sir ? "
<NAME> answered the summons , and <NAME> raised his eyes stealthily to his face , as if he almost feared to read there , a knowledge of his recent thoughts .
<NAME> unknowns , amazed to find how intimately they know Veneering , pluck up spirit , fold their arms , and begin to contradict him before breakfast .
' No , I do not indeed , ' replied <NAME> .
' You were speaking about its being a girl , ' said <NAME> .
' These are my holidays. ' ' Are they , by <NAME> ! ' muttered <NAME> , with his eyes on the passion-wasted face .
' I 'll run all the way , sir . '
His face grew purple ; his eyes were starting from his head , and with protruded tongue , he seemed to mock me .

I say 'Mighty potentate , here IS my homage !
" Go before me and show me all those dreadful places .
Was it an unequal marriage in point of years , this unlucky job of yours ? ' said <NAME> .

<NAME> had the honour to support her , and <NAME> was placed upon the chairman ' s right ; the <NAME> and the <NAME> sustained the vice .
The news is -- ' ' <NAME> ? ' interrupted <NAME> .
What else is so extremely charming !
' So he is very impressible .
The strange man said nothing but made another snort .
It was no unfit messenger of death , who had disturbed the quiet of the matron 's room .
' What can it mean ? ' she thought , as she accompanied him up stairs .
<NAME> and death went hand in hand ; wealth and poverty stood side by side ; repletion and starvation laid them down together .
My mother glances submissively at them , shuts the book , and lays it by as an arrear to be worked out when my other tasks are done .
" I did n't see YOU , " says <NAME> .
' With the blessing of <NAME> , <NAME> , ' returned <NAME> .
' I am sure I didn ' t myself .

replied the <NAME> , " do you believe in me or not ? "
' So have I , ' said the stranger .

There would have been loss , disgrace , I don ' t know what at all .
<NAME> <NAME> merely shakes the finger at her .
Satisfied that her dwelling was safe , she drew one hand through the old man ' s arm and prepared to ply her crutch-stick with the other .
" You speak so feelingly and so manfully , <NAME> , that I thank you with all my heart , and will open all my heart -- or nearly so .
In came the three <NAME> , beaming and lovable .
The others follow ; and there is a blithe and merry ringing , as of a little peal of marriage bells .
' I ' ll look in upon you to-morrow , young man .
' You are the next ? ' muttered the Manager .
I have done with the red coat , believe me .
Not that it required much penetration to say that , because I knew that his being there at all was an act of kindness .
The strong tide filled his throat , and bore him on , upon its rapid current .
" What has ever got your precious father then ? "

Therefore , I followed him without a word , to a retired nook of the garden , formed by the junction of two walls and screened by some rubbish .
<NAME> Leicester is apprehensive that my <NAME> , not being very well , will take cold at that open window .
there is a likeness , ' said <NAME> , after some reflection .
He looked in at the <NAME> .
" Will you come and dine with me ? "
A little more elbow-room is all we want here .

The scent of the restoratives that had been tried was pungent in the room , but had no fragrance in the dull and languid air the lady breathed .
He was as good as his word , and started directly .
It is thought better that his old housekeeper should give him <NAME> 's letter , the contents of which no one knows or can surmise .
But my godmother wrote a stiff letter declining for me , and I never went .
' No , I have got it ; here it is , ' said Mr Boffin , dusting it with the sleeve of his coat .

The lady lay upon her bed as he had left her , clasping her little daughter to her breast .

<NAME> <NAME> 's mother was so diverted that she rolled her head as she smiled and made a silent appeal to <NAME> with her elbow .
' I ' m a heavy sleeper , ' said <NAME> , as he flung himself on the bed .
I beg -- nay , command ! -- that you will not pounce .
The work went on , until the noon-bell rang .
But I never will desert <NAME> .
Is it there ? ' ' Here it is ! ' said I .
The boat floated into the wharf to which it belonged .
It ' s down my throat again and can ' t come up .
' Off at once , ' replied <NAME> .
I 'm a soldier 's wife and accustomed to travel my own way .
Yes , let us go now .
There was no harm in his trade .
' I can never be grateful enough to you , <NAME> , I am sure , ' said <NAME> , with the sweetest smile imaginable .
" Why , they killed him , " says <NAME> , " on account of his having so much cheek .
Do you know what you 're doing ? '
' Did he say whether he had any business to speak about ? ' inquired <NAME> , after a little impatient consideration .
<NAME> alone , Mr <NAME> locked his outer door , and came back to his fire .
' So am I , <NAME> , ' rejoined <NAME> .
I have been in prison for threatening the solicitor .
' Why the fact is , ' replied Mr Toots , ' that it ' s the young woman I come from .
Still , when you say there is no change for the better , I must , as a bare matter of fact , deny that . "
oh dear , oh dear , what an edged tool you are ! ' ' <NAME> ' t play with me then , ' said <NAME> impatiently .
( " I really think this must be a man ! " was <NAME> 's breathless reflection , simultaneously with his coming against the wall . )
'Oh , I dare say about that , yer know , ' observed <NAME> , backing towards the door , and shaking his head with a kind of sober alarm .
I want to speak to <NAME> , quite alone. ' I promise that she shall , immediately ; but I can not leave her , for my grief .
Yet , no one had followed them , and no man spoke when they entered the wine-shop , though the eyes of every man there were turned upon them .
The looms , and wheels , and <NAME> all out of gear for an hour .
The <NAME> is about to bow to the bar when the prisoner is presented .
Why , I recollect old <NAME> quite a little boy , don ' t you ?
I resolved that they should not know .
Come and see us. ' ' Oh , it ' s of no consequence , thank you ! ' Mr Toots would blushingly rejoin .
' I wish it was <NAME> , sir , ' said <NAME> .
It ' s very cheap. ' The old man , notwithstanding his fatigue , would have remained in the churchyard all night if his new acquaintances had remained there too .
What matter , my dear ? ' ' Mr .
For many hours , they had little hope of his surviving ; but grief is strong , and he recovered .
" Esther certainly does think so . "
I must speak to you for myself , since there is no one about me whom I could ask to do so .
The drone said unaffectedly , " You will excuse me ; I really can not attend to the shop !
It is the next difficult thing to an impossibility to imagine <NAME> without Mrs. Rouncewell , but she has only been here fifty years .
It seemed that he wanted to know whether all these were brothers and sisters of his ?
I asked after a good deal of hesitation .
' They are both alive. ' ' Both ! ' repeated <NAME> , in a low voice .
I am willing to take charge of you , <NAME> , and to educate you , and provide for you .
I view it , steadily , as an investment .
He had not been there with me ; all the noses were straight in my day .
But I always say that and have never doubted it .
Is it your pleasure , sir , that we decline and we fall ? ' with a feint of taking up the book .
Had he that deep-seated recondite complaint , and did any doctor find it out ?
' When are you relieved ? ' asked <NAME> .
You treated me falsely , ungratefully , and cruelly .
Not much in the habit of travelling by rail myself , <NAME> , but gentlemen frequently say so. ' ' Do many gentlemen come here ?
Get up and bustle about , and do n't come over me with your woman 's nonsense . '
As it was , he laid a finger on his lips , and looked towards her brother .
He had taken service with the prisoner , in good faith and simplicity , four years ago .
' Good-night , <NAME> ! ' returned <NAME> softly .
He ascends the door-steps and is gliding into the dusky hall when he encounters , on the top step , a bowing and propitiatory little man .
( She really was there , I have since found , both before the deed and after it . )
' Not a bit , ' replied the sage <NAME> , with an air of vast experience .
This is a swimmer , sir , this fellow -- a diver , <NAME> save us !
' Perhaps <NAME> ' s <NAME> has gone there , <NAME> , ' observed <NAME> , turning to her .
' Would you remember a message to your sister , <NAME> , if I was to charge you with one ? ' ' Well ?
It was beginning to rain fast .
There never was , there never had been , there never again should be , such a man as Mr Merdle .
Is there anything else he ' d like ?
All here , yourself excepted , saw the King take it , in his carriage in the street , sitting beside the Queen .
But now he can only whisper , and what he whispers sounds like what it is -- mere jumble and jargon .
" I am sure THAT 'S very natural ! "
' And such a mother , ' observed Mr Dombey , bowing with some confused idea of being complimentary to <NAME> .
' And your respected father , ' said Mr Casby , ' is no more !
The old lady began to rummage in her pocket for her spectacles .
' Always hope ; that ' s a dear boy .
" It may be , partly , because I know nothing of the value of money , " said <NAME> , " but I often feel this .
' They taks such as offers .
No more wishing one ' s self dead now .
'This is not the place I went to sleep in . '
As I might have expected , he had none at all .
' What kind of compromise would you recommend ? ' inquired <NAME> .
His movements might have been planned to gain for him , in getting beyond their reach , twelve hours ' advantage ?
" And so have you , sir .
" In secret , too , " grumbled the gaoler , looking at the written paper .
' Yes , my good friend , ' said my aunt .
" My heart aches for him ; that it does ! "
I sha n't disgrace it when the time comes . '
But get up , get up ! "
' That ' s capital ! ' said <NAME> , giving it a kiss .
<NAME> Snagsby standing at his shop-door looking up at the clouds sees a crow who is out late skim westward over the slice of sky belonging to <NAME> 's Court .
<NAME> <NAME> had been spending a few days with a neighbouring friend , and had only just returned to the parental roof .
Within an hour or two from this. " " It will be dark soon after four .
I know that this is a long voyage .
Three , four , five , guineas , you would consider handsome , I dare say . "
He did n't say so before <NAME> , he only said so to me .
Appearances indicated that this establishment was a very recent institution .
That ' s just the wery sort o ' thing he ' d do .
' <NAME> , sir , ' said <NAME> .
It broke up the establishment .
' Why -- no , I haven ' t exactly dined , ' said Mr Merdle .
He pressed a penny into his hand , and gave vent to his feelings ( as did his exemplary wife also ) , in a shout of approving laughter .
She is a tall , dark , black-eyed , fine figure of a woman .
But the commentary upon it now indelibly written in his handsome face made it far more distressing than it used to be .
" Oh , it 's not the trouble , " returned <NAME> ; " the question is , if there IS any . "
' Get into a little training , and we will have a few score miles together .
I heard that <NAME> had turned him out of doors , in consequence ; and that Mrs. and <NAME> had been in a sad way , ever since .
The old woman shook her head .
' No , no , no ! ' shrieked the other , stamping on the ground with the energy of a madman .
That he laid his other hand upon the <NAME> ' s arm , causing him to look up with an abstracted air .
Three or four hours were not a long time after years .
That I am too old ? " said <NAME> .
He is not a living skeleton , I suppose. ' ' Very far from it , ' said <NAME> , with unspeakable expression .
Fairly. ' ' What a dreadfully conscientious fellow you are , <NAME> !
Some of my readers may have an interest in being informed whether or no any portions of the <NAME> Prison are yet standing .
To avoid being too abrupt , I then spoke of the <NAME> and of <NAME> .
' <NAME> prospect , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
There is something else upon its flight besides the wind and clouds .
It broke from one line in the table of commandments at the altar , and illuminated the building with the words .
replied Sikes : appearing at the head of the stairs , with a candle .
<NAME> <NAME> , <NAME> , the <NAME> Guardsman !
" I can bear it , dear <NAME> .
' Six foot inside that wall is Mrs. Sapsea. ' ' Not really Mrs. Sapsea ? ' ' Say Mrs. Sapsea .
If <NAME> has a half-holiday , do as much for <NAME> Orlick. " I suppose he was about five-and-twenty , but he usually spoke of himself as an ancient person .
You ' ll be delighted with him .
" No , no , " said <NAME> , " I am in earnest .
We would all be gentlefolks together , then .
He was overjoyed to see us and dismounted with great alacrity .
I understand that we speak together in confidence .
why didn ' t you say at first that you was willing to come down handsome ? ' The matter was soon arranged , as the turnkey had foretold .
He joined it once again , and wondering why and whither he had gone , accompanied it until they reached an iron gate .
' Well , I think I should .
' Cinderella , dear child , ' the old man expostulated , ' will you never rest ? ' ' Oh !
" He has a stake in the country , " says <NAME> , " I have no doubt .
' What I have made up my mind about has nothing to do with you .
" But it 's all like you .
So <NAME> laid it on the table and went to bed , and I sat looking at it without taking it up , thinking of many things .
Whatever word you like best .
He intended every child in it to be a model—just as the young Gradgrinds were all models .
Mr <NAME> was sure to hail this with a burst of chuckles , like the opening of a bottle of some effervescent beverage .
<NAME> says shrewdly , ' Oh a long time , bless you !
He stood pondering , and she sat looking at the dusty fire without moving , for some time .
' Yes , but not the old pain .
' Try a little more something green , sir , ' said <NAME> ; and again handed the basket .
" <NAME> , " he said , more moved than he had been from the first , " before heaven , I will be a true friend to him !
<NAME> considers a little , then remarks , turning to the woman but keeping an encouraging eye on Jo , " He is not so ungrateful as you supposed .
" You made mention of the young lady as a golden-haired doll .
Much as he admired the graces of her face and form , and freshly as they dwelt within his sensual remembrance , he had never thought her half so beautiful .
' Devil of a mess on the staircase , waiter , ' said the stranger .
Better for common sense , better for him , better for me .
How many more of them ! " exclaimed the man with the bloated face .
It is a name , <NAME> , that a man is proud to recognise .
' Clara ! ' said <NAME> , in her warning note .
' We have found a new one in that word , scout .
She ran along the sea beach , believing the old boat was theer ; and calling out to us to turn away our faces , for she was a-coming by .
" You are still on friendly terms with <NAME> ? " " Quite .
Worldly wise in hard and poor necessities , she was innocent in all things else .
'If he means to blab us among his new friends , we may stop his mouth yet . '
He didn ' t find them , and she died not long after .
" How did you find out that ? "
He likes to see a stray face or two looking in through the railings , and perhaps reading his inscription .
I am ashamed at you. ' ' My dear girl , what have I got to do with her dressing beautifully or looking well ? ' inquired <NAME> .
The neighbourhood was a dreary one at that time ; as oppressive , sad , and solitary by night , as any about <NAME> .
' We want to make a little transfer , if you please. ' ' Oh , just come in , will you ? ' said <NAME> .
And very pleasant the fire was ; for , hot though it had been yesterday , it was quite cold to-day , and the wind blew keenly .
Mr Merdle ' s right hand was filled with the evening paper , and the evening paper was full of Mr Merdle .
It was a strong grapple , and a fierce struggle , arm and leg .
It was late next morning when <NAME> awoke , from a sound , long sleep .
Confined as the limits of <NAME> are , it has its barber , its coffee-shop , its beer-shop , and its fried-fish warehouse .
A host of unpleasant misgivings , which had been crowding upon <NAME> during the whole journey , thronged into his mind with redoubled force when he was left alone .
When you say tight -- ' ' I mean tight , ' Mr <NAME> explained .
Everything was so beautiful , so compact , so neat , and in such exquisite taste , said everybody , that there really was no deciding what to admire most .
<NAME> <NAME> is found to be downstairs , by appointment .
From beneath a leaf of torn and cancelled scraps of paper , he took one letter that remained entire .
<NAME> , I may remark , had taken his full share of the general bow , and had received it with infinite condescension .
" My dear Jarndyce , " returned <NAME> , " I will do anything to give you pleasure , but it seems an idle form -- a superstition .
" She might have had the politeness to send that message at first , but it 's better late than never .
I even heard it said between them , " Shall she go ? "
He runs up the long wooden entry and finds the trooper smoking his pipe .
I felt its whole weight now ; and I drooped beneath it , and I said in my heart that it could never be lightened .
But he always saw her as she was , without disguise , and watched her on the dangerous way that she was going .
' He don ' t consider himself above it. ' ' Perhaps he considers himself beneath it , ' suggested <NAME> .
' No warm water ! ' exclaimed <NAME> .
<NAME> ! ' and go out to the assault .
He states his points so clearly that it ' s a treat to have ' em !
<NAME> , not without some grumbling , gave ninepence .
' I ain ' t a cove to chuck a word away .
Am I so like my poor little Uncle again ? ' ' Yes , <NAME> .
They had scarcely set foot upon its pavement , when the girl started , and immediately made towards them .
Give me a kiss , <NAME> .
All this passed in a whisper a door or two from the house in which I could faintly hear crying and moaning .
However , they brought her through it by unremitting and affectionate attention ; and we were married yesterday six weeks .
' Shall we , really ? ' returned <NAME> , indolently surprised .
We have been taking counsel together , and getting on very well , all things considered .
' The counting-house , sir ? ' I repeated .
He was very unwilling to go , I can tell you , but there was no help for it .
If you ' ll go on managing capitally , I ' ll go on doing my part .
Yet you think yourselves very fine , I dare say ! "
Mr and <NAME> had been dining alone , with their gloom cast over them , and <NAME> reclined on a drawing-room sofa .
" You were always a good friend to me , " said <NAME> .
" <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , this is a bad business. " Ah !
The other mourners ( who are only Mr Chick , and two of the medical attendants ) proceed upstairs to the drawing-room , to be received by <NAME> and <NAME> .
Then why don ' t he go ?
Too late to know for certain , whether injuries received before or after death ; one excellent surgical opinion said , before ; other excellent surgical opinion said , after .
' Pray , <NAME> , ' said Mr Dorrit , raising his eyebrows , ' what do you mean ?
I know all. ' The daughter smiled incredulously .
He could calmly think how beautiful she was , how full of promise , what a home some happy man would find in such a heart one day .
But I have done it myself ; no thanks to the governor. ' ' And your intelligent sister ? ' ' My intelligent sister is about where she was .
I felt it was a time for conversation and confidence .
<NAME> <NAME> admits that he has been wrong and begs <NAME> to think no more about it .
' And at other times they say , " Can it never be done without these tricks , Mr Riah ?
That ' s a peculiarity of his .
Late in the afternoon he awoke , and in some anxiety sent round to <NAME> ' s lodging hard by , to inquire if he were up yet ?
Or , if they flop , their floppings goes in favour of more patients , and how can you rightly have one without t'other ?

Now , I am coming to the paper , and mark what I say .
<NAME> , <NAME> , pray ! ' But she did not rise .
She held so tight to him , in fact , that the officers were obliged to take ' em both together .
I regret <NAME> Boffin. ' ' I , too , regret that separation very much .
I asked him , with a better appearance of composure than I could have thought possible a minute before , whether he had made his feelings known to Agnes .
Now , then , <NAME> , wheel away. ' ' Hold on , sir , ' said <NAME> , invigorated with the prospect of refreshments .
' Come ! ' said he , ' I don ' t want to be told about that .
you have something to say .
Being my limbs , what does it signify ?
Of course , " he said , bringing his chair nearer mine and breaking into his fascinating smile , " of course it 's not business .
We can not command our feelings to such an extent as that. ' Miss Tox assented , without being particular as to the intelligibility of the proposition .
' Out with it ! ' said <NAME> , with an arch look .
I hope that gentleman will take warning , sir , and will not be offended at my freedom .
After that , Mr Feeder not only began to dance as if he meant dancing and nothing else , but secretly to stimulate the music to perform wild tunes .

He will have his bond , my dear friend . "
When a name was called , its owner stepped apart into a spot reserved for those who were announced as being thus fatally recorded .
He is a responsible-looking gentleman dressed in black , portly enough , but strong and active .
A moment afterwards they re-entered the house .
Not a dead man , I suppose . "
' Oh -- you remember me , I suppose ? ' said <NAME> .
He then returned to the punch , in the highest state of exhilaration .
Perhaps I speak with some little partiality .
To those noble qualities I can lay no claim .
' We intend to win everything , ' said he .
The street was muddy , dirty , and deserted .
then it 's a panel , eh ? '
Oh yes , he was up .
<NAME> , I have no doubt whatever that <NAME> will then promote me to young <NAME> ' s situation .

He had been there often , during a whole year , and had always been the same moody and morose lounger there .
Nothing else in it -- no , nothing , nothing !

' I waited for a good opportunity .
When there are two parties to a bargain , it is only reasonable that the interests of both should be consulted ; is it , my good friend ? '
It rained all day as I once thought it never did rain anywhere , but in the <NAME> of <NAME> .
I had done it again .
It was summer-time , and lovely weather .
No , it was not my fault .
' Could I say a few words with you in the next box ? ' ' By all means , ' rejoined <NAME> with a grin .
I told her I should like it very much , I hoped ; but I was a little strange to it at first .
Between this , and the room she had called hers , there was a small door of communication , standing partly open .
Because they were never asunder .
I am still , and I always shall be .
' I am very much obliged to you , indeed , ' said <NAME> , on hearing it was to be sent to where he lived , that night .
You were not to be found .
How could such a collection be here , where you see everything except the inside of one little cupboard and a few boxes ?
Not that I had really thought so , but because my conversational powers were effectually scattered .
A word in your ear , Mrs. Nickleby .
That patriotic servant accordingly stuck to his colours ( the <NAME> of four Quarterings ) , and was a perfect <NAME> in respect of nailing them to the mast .
<NAME> , come , my young cousins , begin afresh !
<NAME> , ' he added , looking round again .
<NAME> <NAME> would not hear of his rising , so they made the bed the chair , and <NAME> presided .
' I think it right to suggest it .
You are quite -- yes -- dear me ! ' I hoped he was well , and Mrs. Strong too .
A second knock brought no reply from within the house ; but caused a woman over the way to look out and inquire who that was , awanting <NAME> .
' A hundred , ' said the little man .
If you like to come there , come there .
' You ask me why ! ' returned my aunt .
Mr <NAME> argued , if an orphan were wanted , was he not an orphan himself ; and could a better be desired ?
' You know it almost breaks my heart , even to hear you talk of such a thing , ' replied <NAME> .
He was walking up and down the room , panting , and making himself worse by laboriously fanning himself with her handkerchief , when he turned towards the opening door .
' You ! ' He did what he could to muster a smile , and returned , ' Your fancy .
After a short delay , he reappeared , and limping back again , halted midway , and beckoned <NAME> to follow him .
He was sitting in his old grey gown and his old black cap , in the sunlight by the window , reading his newspaper .
' You see , master hadn ' t introduced us , then .
' Stop a moment , ma ' am , ' said <NAME> ; ' I ' m afraid I have not understood you .
' <NAME> my soul and honour that ' s a wise remark .
I replied at my own chambers , with <NAME> .
Let us both try to forget it .
The bell was rung again , with some impatience , while the party were in darkness .
I whistled and made nothing of going .
She started -- it was only a passing dream .
In one of the sunburnt faces I had recognized <NAME> , and I had been afraid of his recognizing me .

<NAME> Leicester seems to wake , though his eyes have been wide open , and he looks intently at <NAME> as <NAME> refers to his watch .
We 're not going to pick holes in each other 's coats , I suppose ? "
Oh I know she ' s going to bring him here !
There she sits in his company like a stone , instead of making herself agreeable and getting it easily .
' Capital ! ' said <NAME> , putting the stakes in his pocket .
He saw her in his mind , exactly as she was .
<NAME> nodded to him to take no further notice just then ; and , in a few minutes , the girl subsided into her accustomed demeanour .
Give him to drink , my wife ! " A second man got up and went out .
' Fie for shame. ' ' Mr <NAME> will forgive the partiality of a wife , ' said <NAME> , with an engaging smile .
The room was as neat as <NAME> or my aunt .
' Snug ! ' said <NAME> , when he had groped his way to the wooden counting-house , and opened the door with a key he carried about with him .
' <NAME> , ' he cried , in a suffocating voice , ' it ' s little Nickleby !
What superior intelligence ! ' ' Keep off , <NAME> ! ' cried the palpitating <NAME> , taking her apron from her mouth again .
Oh , very right indeed , ' said <NAME> .
' Why did you call him back ? ' ' He was long enough coming , anyhow , ' grumbled <NAME> .
' I shall strive t ' see thee agen , <NAME> , afore I go , but if not— ' ' Thou wilt not , <NAME> , I know .
My darling , do n't you be afraid ! "
You know this to be our determination .
I was standing alone before the fire , when <NAME> came stealing softly in , to give me that usual precious little kiss before I went .

" And the maker 's name ? " said <NAME> .
' Can we have beds here ? ' inquired <NAME> , summoning the waiter .
She could scarcely move her head for pain and heaviness , her eyes were strained and sore , and she was very weak .
At a sign from <NAME> , they helped out a third man , and taking him between them , hurried him into the house .

He takes his place within the carriage , and three other gentlemen follow .
Some of the young ladies washed the lettuces for him , and sliced them under his directions .
' You call very early , and how kind that is , my dear ! ' pursued <NAME> .
' Not much , I fear , ' returned my mother .
We ' ll finish the bottle , to the <NAME> , <NAME> -- <NAME> ' s <NAME> .

She had been surprised at first , because she had not thought Edmund a marrying man .
I have deliberated , ever since , when and how to destroy it .
With a plunge of enjoyment , <NAME> settled himself afresh .
' Nothing would give me greater pleasure , ' replied <NAME> .
But what 's done ca n't be undone .
It was old enough now , and dreary enough , for nobody lived in it but <NAME> , the other rooms being all let out as offices .
Another consequence that he had never foreshadowed , was the implication of an innocent man in his supposed murder .
' When did that person come here , waiter ? ' ' Come down by the night-coach , this morning , sir. ' ' Humph !
' Gentlemen , ' returned <NAME> , ' do with me as you will !
<NAME> hadst no sleep last night , I can well believe .
' By what right I ask ? ' ' By this right .
And in this dress ? ' ' I hoped you would like me better in this dress than any other .
' Why should I seek to change , ' said I , ' what has been so precious to me for so long !
As when I saw my little darling looking up so naturally to those cordial eyes .
' Why , they ' re -- over there , my dear , ' said the turnkey , with a vague flourish of his key .
The strange sound of his voice thrilled through the whole frame of his child .
' Hi , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> ! ' <NAME> make another effort .
But other subjects began to lay heavy on the <NAME> ' s mind .
It was the beginning of a day in <NAME> ; the deep blue sky unsullied by a cloud , and teeming with brilliant light .
There was a favourite spot of mine in the park-woods of <NAME> where a seat had been erected commanding a lovely view .
' My dear young <NAME> , ' he said , clapping me on the shoulder again , ' you are a very <NAME> .
' Eloped with a half-pay captain , ' repeated <NAME> , ' basely and falsely eloped with a half-pay captain .
Mr <NAME> hurried out , and found her on the dark staircase , panting , with a lighted candle in her hand .

I dare say I am a capricious fellow , <NAME> .

I shall trust my remembrances then , my sweet nurse , in your hands , and I well know they couldn ' t be in better .
<NAME> 's finishing the sentence restores her to favour .
Resolved , as your discriminating good sense perceives , that if you was to have a sap -- pur -- IZE , it should be a complete one !
I could say nothing in reply ; for who could offer hope , or consolation , to the abject being before me ?
In the drawing-room of which mansion , there presently entered to them the most remarkable girl <NAME> had ever seen .
So , to the <NAME> as before : where <NAME> and <NAME> were handed out , and whence they all went on foot to Mrs <NAME> ' s .
<NAME> thought it was , too , but he held his peace .
' The mother now sought to caress her , but poor <NAME> repelled her , preferring to be with her acquaintances .
Yet the cold was merciful , for it was the cold night air and the rain that restored me from a swoon on the stones of the causeway .
May ' Yes , <NAME> , yes. ' But <NAME> glanced towards the door , as if he thought his principal might appear there , unseasonably .
In capital B ' s and H ' s most of the girls under <NAME> ' s tuition were half a year ahead of every other letter in the alphabet .
There is not a drop of <NAME> 's corrupted blood but propagates infection and contagion somewhere .
At length <NAME> came back -- provokingly cool , and with papers in his hand , and a pen in his mouth , as if nothing had happened .
Towards the last , I could understand some few syllables that she said to me , by placing my ear close to her lips .
I therefore pleaded another engagement ; and observing that Mrs. Micawber ' s spirits were immediately lightened , I resisted all persuasion to forego it .
May I mention something ? ' ' Oh , please don ' t be practical ! ' said <NAME> , coaxingly .
This is what I meant when I said in my note that I had a great favour and a great assistance to beg of you .
That ' s your name. ' At these words , I observed the gentleman more attentively .
' Who says man and wife are bad company ?
There are very few harmless circumstances that would not seem full of perilous meaning , so considered .
<NAME> to earth , ashes to ashes , dust to dust !
' What is the matter with the men !
His household dread him too much to approach a subject on which he is resolutely dumb ; and the only person who dares question him , he silences immediately .
There is much good in it ; there are many good and true people in it ; it has its appointed place .
I believe you there ! ' ' But I love you dearly , <NAME> , ' said the child .
The man shook his fist , as he uttered these words incoherently .
The day came , but not the bridegroom .
One can not say that it is all anxiety or all weariness ; yet it is both , and like ungrown despair . "
The last was a S , -- Swubble , I named him .
" I do n't know that , sir ! "
I have tramped about the country , pet , and I know what I know .
I don ' t want a wife and family .
She had not been consulted on the question , any more than on the question of her coming into these terrestrial parts , to want a name .
We had now got into the month of March .
' I got at him , ' pursued <NAME> , feeling for his whisker , ' by degrees .
I have been very happy with her for some years : too happy , perhaps .
These kisses for a blessing on your head !
My sorrow may bear involuntary witness against you at the judgement <NAME> ; but my angry thoughts or my reproaches never will , I know !
" Have you brought his indentures with you ? " asked <NAME> .
" Now , let me recommend you , " pursued <NAME> , " to look it in the face .
Coax him to use his influence with the Jew .
' Widders , <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> , slightly changing colour .
" Did your ladyship , " says <NAME> , " ever happen to hear of <NAME> ? "
So we are not much alike in that particular .
" I share those feelings , " he returned .
When the door yielded , and he rushed in , what did he see there ?
' That affair of the first bond for four thousand five hundred pounds has not taken the course that was expected , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
I answer that it 's in my nature to do it , under wrong , and I must do it .
For instance , if he took his supper after a hard day , to the <NAME> March in <NAME> , his food might be likely to sit heavy on him .
He had done wonders before , but now he began to powder away like a raving mad giant .
This is a secret expedition .
I was speaking of <NAME> .
What d ' ye think it was all for ? ' ' For another tea-drinkin ' , perhaps , ' said <NAME> .
I am informed of that fact because -- which I mention in confidence -- I know it in the way of my profession at <NAME> and <NAME> 's .
' <NAME> sent me over with the chay-cart , to carry your luggage up to the house .
The apprentices were the queerest little people .
The finale concluded , the dancers promenaded the room , and <NAME> and his companion stationed themselves in a corner to observe the company .
Like some other mothers , whom I have known in the course of my life , Mrs. <NAME> was far more fond of pleasure than her daughter was .
His name ? " " <NAME> , " said <NAME> , making it <NAME> by pronunciation .
You will come home in the holidays , and be a better boy. ' ' Clara ! ' <NAME> repeated .
' <NAME> , aye , ' replied <NAME> ; and on they went , as briskly as need be .
I never saw her , except upon a baggage-waggon , when she was n't washing greens ! "
Give me your nose sir ! ' ' No !
' Oh , so tranquil ! ' cried the little creature , smiling .
Are you ready to come , my dear friend ? "
She 'll never die quiet till you come , mistress . '
" My dear sir , " said <NAME> , quickening his pace , and taking the old gentleman by both his hands .
You haven ' t got polished leather boots on , ' pouting , with one shoulder raised .
If , while our bodies grow old and withered , our hearts could but retain their early youth and freshness , of what avail would be our sorrows and sufferings !
<NAME> and straw were stored in that portion of the place , fagots for firing , and a heap of apples in sand .
I thought it best to bring a sum of money for the purpose. ' ' Thank you , sir , thank you .
It was so precious to me that I look back on these trifles , now , with an aching heart .
' It can ' t have been a petrefaction. ' ' Memoirs of <NAME> <NAME> , commonly called The Walking Rushlight , sir ?
Do not think or speak of disparity between us , for there is none , except in all my many imperfections .
If she hadn ' t stood my friend , sir , I should have been shut up , to lead a dismal life these many years .
The other half served for a kitchen , and was fitted up with a stove whose small chimney passed through the roof .
' Now ain ' t this capital ? ' inquired that jolly personage , when the work of destruction had commenced .
Does he send clothes on in advance of him ?
' Does <NAME> look like the mother of six ? ' ' Quite ridiculous , ' cried the doctor .
However probable it was to him , she had heard of no such thing .
I have gone aside from my purpose ; I was speaking about our being friends .
Now , it is a fact , that there was nothing at all particular about the knocker on the door , except that it was very large .
The woman hastily lifts up her eyes as if she would deny that her injury is referable to such a cause .
Make up your mind quick , <NAME> .
What power of cannon might it take to shake that rusty old man out of his immovable composure ?
" If it 's a point of conspiracy , you need n't take the trouble to mention it .
But it came about in this way .
' Mr <NAME> ' s speeches were detestable to me , shocking to me , ' said <NAME> , startling that gentleman with another stamp of her little foot .
The window-shutters were closed ; the street was empty ; not a soul had awakened to the business of the day .
As it pleased Heaven in its mercy to restore him so soon , I should have great hope .
What do you see written there ? ' The waiter read : ' Datchery. ' ' Now you know my name , ' said the gentleman ; ' <NAME> .
' Do you know will he be long , sir ? ' asked <NAME> , with bashful hesitation .
The unusual apparition was followed by another bonnet .
Is the man born yet , is the spade wrought yet ?
' What do you think of this request , <NAME> ? ' murmured <NAME> .
The letter was lying before me just completed , when I was told that a lady waited , who wished to see me .
If these flattering attentions to herself were not sufficient proofs , <NAME> ' s confidential friend had suffered the secret to escape him in so many words .
' Can you one ? ' inquired the old lady .
' Shall I order a private room , <NAME> ? ' inquired <NAME> , when they reached the Bush .
The man who lay on the ledge of the grating was even chilled .
Mrs MacStinger in retort , looked at her all over .
Who was he ? " " Your clemency , <NAME> !
' Death of my soul ! ' he exclaimed .
Mr <NAME> , I am not quite a stranger here .
" That 's the message , " observes <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> was no less surprised , although his astonishment was not expressed in the same eccentric manner .
'Here 's somebody wants to see you , to ask you some questions , I suppose .
Imposing on you to give their Grubbers nothing but blame , and to give them nothing but credit !
<NAME> mine , <NAME> Dombey. ' ' No , no , no , ' said <NAME> , checking him in the act of impetuously pulling off his own .
<NAME> pride wouldn ' t have schoolmasters brought here , like doctors , to look at a bad case .
Quietly , quietly , all the lines of the plan of the great <NAME> melted one after another .
Her next , to go back , and to enter ; and this second impulse held her in irresolution on the staircase .
At six o ' clock every mornin ' they let ' s go the ropes at one end , and down falls the lodgers .
" For there <NAME> chords , Jobling -- " <NAME> begs pardon again .
She went to sleep with a little bracelet he had given her clasped upon her arm .
" You have just come down ? " said <NAME> , edging me a little away with his shoulder .
" Nineteen , " repeats my Lady thoughtfully .
What is it you are not ?
It ' ll begin to be carted off to-morrow. ' ' Have you been out to take leave of your old friend , sir ? ' asked <NAME> , jocosely .
'It 's a long time , ' said <NAME> .
A question now arises , with relation to his nose. ' ' Flat , ' said <NAME> .
' I know her well. ' ' Look at the broken scull .
Nor was it relieved by any glimpse of the little creature who had brought him there .
<NAME> <NAME> takes the chair , and three members of <NAME> are positively coming .
Now tell me , my love .
" Jo , " whispers the law-stationer softly as the boy lingers on the step .
We found our old lodging vacant , and in half an hour were quietly established there , as if we had never gone away .
' It is so , ' the Secretary admitted .
They must have powerful motives for a secret residence , or be reduced to a destitute condition indeed , who seek a refuge in <NAME> 's <NAME> .
Why do you listen ? ' asked the lady .
We now turned into another narrow street .
I dare say he don ' t .
' Come , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
I felt for my old self as the dead may feel if they ever revisit these scenes .
' Who is it ? ' cried <NAME> again .
' Yes , <NAME> , and supper , ' added <NAME> .
How many old recollections , and how many dormant sympathies , does <NAME> time awaken !
" It 's not convenient , " said <NAME> , " and it 's not fair .
" He is a fine young soldier now , <NAME> , by the name of <NAME> .
The object of this new liking was not among his myrmidons .
' Though as to master , ' said he , glancing again at <NAME> , ' not master onny more .
Oh , my fellow-countrymen , what warning but this did I give you ?
The <NAME> had no more tenderness or poetry in it , than the bar of a public-house .
" On the contrary , it seems to do you good , miss , judging from your appearance . "
Now you know me , do n't you ? "
Shall I remind you that I am not , and that I never was , anything but the friend whom you agreed to trust ?
A wave as of triumph ?
That time , to which he has so long , and certainly with great constancy , looked forward , is now come .
" I have got it here , sir . "
'What a pity , <NAME> , my dear , that there 's none quite ready to be done . '
<NAME> and solemn were the score of rubbers in which <NAME> and the old lady played together ; uproarious was the mirth of the round table .
he asks in an insinuating tone .
'So , you 're going on to <NAME> , are you ? '
In our boyish want of discretion I dare say we took too much to drink , and I know we talked too much .
' Well , <NAME> , ' she began , ' what do you think of the proctor plan ?
It was the face of <NAME> , and through all the terrified avoidance it expressed , there was pity in it , sorrow , a grateful tender memory .
" This woman understands me , " <NAME> thinks as she lets her glance fall again .
<NAME> was the better for it , or thought of being so .
That is his employer , gentlemen .
It ' s amazing what places they used to put the guineas in , wrapped up in rags .
' Pray , ' said <NAME> , in great confusion , while these preliminaries were in course of completion .
We had other visitors besides <NAME> .
Here are the other passengers .
' Glad to hear it , <NAME> .
I go to seek an hotel ! ' But , there his eyes encountered <NAME> , who was still at his post .
' <NAME> , ' said the Major , ' I ' m glad to see you .
' Our friend had a remote connexion with that event , ' said the Major , ' and all the credit that belongs to her , J .
'Wait quietly only one instant , while I speak to aunt . '
He had a glass and bottle in his hand , and was in the act of drinking .
Then they go upstairs , <NAME> heavily , and <NAME> ( for it is he ) very lightly indeed .
At last Mrs. Micawber resolved to move into the prison , where <NAME> had now secured a room to himself .
He had meant to go away to-day , but clung to this tie in the house as the last and only thing left to him .
I don ' t think I could have done more , then , without letting my hold on father go ; but they sometimes lie heavy on my mind .
And reassured , " Since that 's the case -- " " Yes !
Personally , or by letter , you will always find me here , sir , with my shoulder to the wheel . "
I ' m struck of a heap , and can ' t do it , ' he said , impatiently .
And what ' s this in dancing-shoes ?
" I want to know no more than I know .
Your habit of interrupting without having the least thing in the world to say , distracts one .
<NAME> and his daughter were sitting there alone .
<NAME> said he did n't believe there ever was such a goose cooked .
' Let us have some of your best wine to-day , waiter , ' said old <NAME> , rubbing his hands .
And I called him a quantity of names ; ' shaking her head over her work , and dropping tears .
Very uncomfortable. ' ' They ' re all on ' em men as has met vith some disappointment in life , ' said <NAME> , senior .
<NAME> <NAME> was excited and indignant .
That , he called with confidence on the jury to come and do likewise .
' Are you going ? ' said <NAME> , whose heart sank within her at the result of her stratagem , but who affected a light indifference notwithstanding .
Much marked with irons. ' ' Ran away , the negress Fanny .
I have no design whatever .
The key was put in the lock , and turned .
We bestow a fragment of our minds upon you , sir , you see ! "
Is he quite heartbroken ? ' <NAME> was of a tender nature , and there was something in this appeal that moved her very much .
After this , he stirred the fire ; after that , he rubbed his hands and looked at <NAME> .
There was something in the picture of <NAME> bestowing his deportment on <NAME> that quite took my fancy .
The confidences of lovely women are not to be slighted .
The stately residence of <NAME> was altogether blighted and deserted .
No struggle , no consciousness of peril , no entreaty—and yet I never saw _that_ before. ' With a start .
If ever delay was dangerous , it 's dangerous now ; and if ever you could n't afterwards forgive yourself for causing it , this is the time .
The many sounds become so deadened that the change is like putting cotton in the ears , or having the head thickly muffled .
I think we had better talk about this , really , <NAME> .
He gazed for a few seconds in the face ; then stooped to kiss it -- oh , how tenderly ! -- and drew a handkerchief before it .
" I 've had the pleasure of seeing you before .
She still preserved her proud manner , but there was a touch of softness in her voice , as she answered : ' I justify nothing .
How it is so , is no matter ; that is my story , and I keep my story to myself .
His broad chest heaves with pleasure .
It had been mentioned at the <NAME> , she remarked , on the authority of the journals , that he had been kept in prison for his own safety .
Now I know ye did .
So , by <NAME> , to the <NAME> of <NAME> In <NAME> ; <NAME> ; <NAME> ; <NAME> ; <NAME> ; St. <NAME> ' s .
I much prefer it as it is. ' <NAME> , with head bent down , still clipped among the plants .
But the gallantry of her friends would not allow of this ; and the man in faded black , mounting the breach first , produced his plunder .
What could it do , his boy had asked him .
This is my frugal breakfast .
' <NAME> , ' rejoined Mrs. Sparsit , ' say no more .
<NAME> mental agitation and disturbance was no novelty to him , even before his late sufferings .
Not the curtains at his feet , nor the curtains at his back , but those to which his face was addressed .
Am I never to hear the last of this ?
He never looked so serene as he did then .
Suddenly , he took the desperate resolution to going back to <NAME> .
' Where have you worked all your life ? ' ' Mostly underground , <NAME> , ' till I got married .
His head was sunk upon his bosom ; and he slumbered again .
By dint of alternate threats , promises , and bribes , the lady in question was ultimately prevailed upon to undertake the commission .
He had no sooner adopted this resolution , than he conveyed as much honesty into his face as it was capable of expressing , and sympathised with Mr <NAME> exceedingly .
Let 'em knock me well about the head .
'There was two of 'em in it , ' continued <NAME> ; 'and they had a boy with 'em ; that 's plain from the size of the window .
'Put your head out of the winder , ' replied <NAME> .
The listener ' s blood ran colder now than ever it had done in frost and snow , but he knocked again .
I ask you , do YOU mean to tell me ? ' Mr Lammle falls silent again , and they walk as before .
The <NAME> ' s visage on these occasions presented one of the finest examples of combination and succession of expression ever observed .
I tell this lightly , but it was no light thing to me .
He ' s no public offender , bless you , now !
Veneering pervades the legislative lobbies , intent upon entrapping his fellow-legislators to dinner .
O the long , long night , with the moans of the poor wife !
" Kiss me , child of <NAME> .
The <NAME> put down the paper , took off his spectacles , and brought his eyes to bear on the deserter .
Casement windows opened , crazy doors were unbarred , and people came forth shivering -- chilled , as yet , by the new sweet air .
I asked him how he liked his profession .
I can do poor Arthur no good now , that I see ; and you needn ' t be afraid of me .
said <NAME> , filled with dismal thoughts .
He knew that she would not insist upon his leaving her .
We see <NAME> in a nose , and we know it .
Is there anything you want that would lessen the hardship of this confinement ? "
And vegetable marrows likewise. ' ' Confound his impudence ! ' said <NAME> , firing immediately .
' I ' ll teach you manners , my fine fellow , one of these fine mornings. ' ' Thank ' ee , ' said <NAME> .
You are more beautiful in anger than in repose .
' The place of their retreat is indeed discovered , ' he said , ' at last .
Is <NAME> to come along with us ? ' ' <NAME> , no , no , ' replied <NAME> , drawing back , and clinging to <NAME> .
' <NAME> ' t it a curious thing that they should run in little Altro ' s head ?
But , her courage was of that emotional nature that it brought the irrepressible tears into her eyes .
" I forgot it , " he said .
Her patience is unexhausted by hours .
But it is the obstinate custom of such creatures hardly ever to say what is set down for them .
You must endeavour , sir , to change it .
He has a very knowing look , but that he always has .
But I ' ll provide for her !
" I am a mortal , " <NAME> remonstrated , " and liable to fall . "
Do hear my words , and let me save you yet , for better things . '
' Well you see , ' said Mr Inspector , ' it was a question of making a move .
Much as <NAME> would have disliked such a service , I believe she would have retained it , for my sake , in preference to the best upon earth .
' Ah ! ' rejoined the man , taking his handkerchief out of his hat and wiping his face , ' he always will , you know .
' I know what it was , ' said <NAME> ; 'it was the gate . '
He became aware of that again .
It was accordingly settled that <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , should all wear fancy-dresses .
' I suppose you ' ve heard what ' s going forward , <NAME> ? ' said Mrs. <NAME> .
and then counted up to twelve , and said , 'Hush ! '
<NAME> , I am going to <NAME> . '
He waylays the smaller boys to punch their unprotected heads , and calls challenges after me in the open streets .
That I am greatly dissatisfied with it .
'No more of it for me , thank 'ee , <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> ; ' I 've had enough .
Except one man , who got up and went out .
' Only me , <NAME> , ' replied a woman ' s voice .
If you ' re happy or merry ever , you come here to say , along with that chap , that you ' re sorry for it .
A change had been gradually stealing over her , in the time of her loneliness and sorrow .
If I shake and tremble , as we pass the gallows , do n't you mind , but hurry on .
This dialogue made us all uneasy , and me very uneasy .
All that can be imparted , he can impart .
She sat sobbing and murmuring behind it , that , if I was uneasy , why had I ever been married ?
I ' m glad your eyes are red with crying .
He has a clog of iron on his right foot which will weigh four or five pounds. ' ' Detained at the police jail , the negro wench , <NAME> .
' Not about money , I hope ?
<NAME> , conceiving that he had silenced him effectually , could not suppress his triumph , or forbear from following up what he conceived to be his advantage .
It was difficult to believe that a night so long to me , could be short to anybody else .
' The day before yesterday , ' said <NAME> , ' your uncle received this letter .
Let him take that well to heart , ' said <NAME> .
don ' t , <NAME> Weller. ' ' Don ' t what , my dear ? ' said <NAME> .
Of a sudden , in the height of his misery , he puts <NAME> before it .
' One thing more , ' he said .
He stood looking at the gentleman , therefore , with a frightened , self-convicted , and remorseful air .
cries Mrs. Snagsby from the stairs .
<NAME> , come here ! ' The child obeyed : and Mr <NAME> took him on his knee .
" You do , " she said very shortly .
She brought her young husband home one day , and they and their young fledglings have their nest upstairs .
The sight of her in her beauty , almost changed into a woman without his knowledge , may have struck out some such moments even in his life of pride .
It may be so , to such as you who know no righteousness , and no appointment except <NAME> ' s .
' Ah , <NAME> ! ' said <NAME> , with a sigh .
'They shall understand that , ma'am ; they shall be acquainted with the true state of the case , ' said <NAME> .
" Possession is nothing to me .
How to turn a penny .
This is merely in passing .
He 'd start up from a stone coffin , to come in my way ! '
I would have done so again today ; but <NAME> was too quick for me .
' With your usual happy discrimination , my dear <NAME> , ' resumed <NAME> , ' you have hit the point at once .
Are they , though ? ' she said .
Did the phantom of such a woman flit about him on his ride ; true to the reality , and obvious to him ?
' Let them open the door .
All over , that is to say , for the time being .
The city is the seat of the local parliament of <NAME> ; and in its shady legislative halls , some orators were drowsily holding forth to the hot noon day .
The others , looking in as the first one looked , shriek and fly too , and there is an alarm in the street .
" She 's a lovely woman , too , she really is , " says <NAME> , coming back to <NAME> .
'But not the less my niece , ' cried Mrs. Maylie , folding the fainting girl in her arms ; 'not the less my dearest child .
Now , you know me ; you know I am incapable of all the higher and better flights of men .
God forgive this wretched man ! '
' Reg ' lar good land that , ' interposed another fat man .
" As if it were not natural for him to do so , guardian ; as if he could write to a better friend ! "
Open the door of one of these cramped hutches full of sleeping negroes .
' Not so much with her , as with her audiences , ' replied <NAME> .
The place in <NAME> is all alive .
I ' m as good a man as you , and better .
He played with her as a child when in that yard a child she played .
She was introduced as <NAME> , and both <NAME> and his mother called her Rosa .
' I have brought him a little something to eat , ' said the good woman .
I ' ll give it you this afternoon , Sam. ' ' You ' re wery good , sir , ' replied <NAME> .
' I will not hesitate any longer , Mr Wrayburn .
' I defy you to do it ! '
He will talk about business , and won ' t give away his time for nothing .
to the sheet , and gently lifted it away .
" How do you do ? " inquired that lady then -- sharply , and yet as if to express that she bore him no malice .
" Why , <NAME> , my dear , " said I , " what beautiful flowers ! "
' I know it , to my disappointment and regret .
<NAME> <NAME> laughed , and said oh yes , he believed so .
Across the hall , and down the steps , <NAME> led her too ; nor did he withdraw his hand until she was seated in the coach .
Her gentle tapping at the door producing no response , she opens it and peeps in ; seeing no one there , takes possession .
I announce to you that we are arrived at our last sitting on our little business .
She was up ( and , as I believe to this hour , looking for that man ) before anybody in the house was stirring .
I am not going to spend at this rate , to please you , or anybody .
The old man overheard , and laughed .
' My dear Edith , ' said the other , ' I can not help it .
<NAME> ? ' ' Feeder , ' returned Mr Toots .
And it was done -- why , how old are you ? " " Thirty-five , " said the mender of roads , who looked sixty .
People are always calling other people something .
I asked <NAME> whether he had heard if any of the other relations had any legacies ?
<NAME> <NAME> , submitting herself to his judgment , the scheme was worked out with care .
The rosy children opposite run past with hoops .
' Quite a matter of form .
still fearfully disconcerted by Mrs. <NAME> 's eye .
I shall think of it with a melancholy satisfaction when I wake up in the night .
In point of fact , we were playing at <NAME> in the <NAME> .
It was a long room , with crimson-covered benches , and wax candles in glass chandeliers .
Do you believe that I was earnest in all that ? ' ' I do !
' <NAME> ' t you yourself declared that the fellow has heaped provocations , insults , and affronts on you , or something to that effect ?
<NAME> <NAME> darted a look of contempt , which might have withered an anchor .
Seated at table in the act of drinking , Mr Dorrit still saw him through his wine-glass , regarding him with a cold and ghostly eye .
" How do you do , <NAME> ?
' A score , ' cried my aunt , with a kind of indignant pride .
Make it your own time .
The centre of the street door was perfectly covered with a great brass-plate , on which was engraved ' Mrs .
I am screaming out loud all the time I write and so is my brother which takes off my attention rather and I hope will excuse mistakes .
My hopes and fears are both fulfilled to-night .
' Then he has no business to do it , ' said <NAME> .
If you have come here to thank me , it was not necessary .
I 'm not a going to be made unlucky by _your_ sneaking .
But you are such a little oddity !
<NAME> <NAME> held it for a little while in his , with his head bowed down .
As we were close to <NAME> then , I would have stopped as a matter of course , only <NAME> would n't stop .
She lost her colour , and the old and intent expression was a constant , not an occasional , thing ; otherwise , she remained very pretty and comely .
This device I executed successfully .
My duty prosperously ended , all between us is ended . "
<NAME> is it , besides fish , as they sometimes ketches in rivers ?
<NAME> was the singer , and he sang ' When the heart of a man is depressed with care ' .
That matter I place in your hands .
But they never blushed upon a change in the new manner of her thought and speech towards her daughter .
When you say THEY say , what do you mean ?
I remember almost hoping that some better change was possible within me .
' ' Cept <NAME> ' s <NAME> , ' observed the fat man solemnly .
In the meanwhile , <NAME> would wait alone by the fire for the Doctor .
<NAME> Leicester writes upon the slate .
' <NAME> ! ' cried <NAME> , rising too .
' The quarter ' s notice , ' said <NAME> , with the gravity of a man on the right side , ' is not yet half expired .
If ever that boy returns to this house , sir , I 'll eat my head . '
He sat himself down with a threatening swagger , and said : ' Give me a bottle of wine .
The moon is rising , and where she sits there is a little stream of cold pale light , in which her head is seen .
But the night covered it , and no one knew .
on the contrary , don ' t I see every reason why I shouldn ' t ?
Besides , <NAME> , you are such a conscientious master , and require so much , that I believe you make her afraid of you .
To these various attentions , Mr <NAME> submitted in a kind of grateful astonishment beyond the reach of language .

I haven ' t always occupied my present station of life .
' What names , sir ? ' said the man at the door .
This time he does touch her with his outstretched hand .
At length , she said , in a trembling voice : ' I hope not , <NAME> .
A man stumbled against him as he turned away , who mumbled some maudlin apology .
<NAME> was the hour when <NAME> stopped at the corner , observing the girl and the strange man as they went down the street .
There was a long hard time when I kept far from me the remembrance of what I had thrown away when I was quite ignorant of its worth .
You have got a twist in that bone , to the best of my belief .
We waited half an hour , walking up and down , but there were no signs of him .
A bird of the air ?
For the streets were so full of dense brown smoke that scarcely anything was to be seen .
" It is with exquisite pleasure , guardian -- with a heart full of thanks . "
What more the letter told me needs not to be repeated here .
What a companion you were ! ' ' Companion ?
' If the dog ' s teeth have entered the leg , <NAME> -- ' began <NAME> , with a display of his own .
When the time drew near for retiring , <NAME> took a glass of water .
What a novel illustration of the tender laws of <NAME> !
It was succeeded by a moment ' s pause .
So they looked , so would he ; so she , his weeping child , who should say when !
The gentleman in the white waistcoat appeared very much amused by this explanation ; but his mirth was speedily checked by a look from <NAME> .
No portrait that I have ever seen of anyone has been half so replete with those qualities .
What I happened to find there , about their secret way of coming and going , without you -- which was strange -- led to my suspecting something wrong .
' I have heard it remarked that she was a very fine woman , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , in a sympathising manner .
' What I have come down to be , since I first saw you in this house !
He was thought to have gone , but he was hiding .
Pleasant sheds tears deserving her own name , and her sweet delusion is at its height .
exclaimed <NAME> , turning a look of excessive surprise on his companion .
I shouldn ' t like to have it known that she was so much attached to me .
' Why , my dear Sir , our friend ' s in an unpleasant position -- very much so .
" He is very weak , " said the trooper in a low voice .
It 's my old girl that advises .
Taking a pace or two over the stone floor , he came back to the table and finished what he had to say .
' You are fairly in for it , ' said the jolly host .
Sincerely , honestly , indeed , <NAME> , I never thought so , before .
cries Mrs. Bagnet , looking at him curiously .
<NAME> and excitement extend further yet , and take a wider range .
It certainly did seem that the whelp yielded to this influence .
I have proved myself , and I know better .
' I could wish , ' said Mr Toots , ' to take this opportunity , <NAME> , if I might , of entering into a word of explanation .
I can desire no more .
<NAME> boy , I done it ! " I tried to collect my thoughts , but I was stunned .
But , whether she was afraid of singing before people , or was out of voice that evening , it was certain that she couldn ' t sing at all .
The imprisoned air , the imprisoned light , the imprisoned damps , the imprisoned men , were all deteriorated by confinement .
you alone are to blame , are you , sir ? ' said <NAME> ; ' I -- I -- see through this , sir .
' I have no patience ' ( which indeed was the truth ) .
' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
Now , does he do too much ? " " I think not .
I ses 'yes ' I ses .
How else COULD he be disappointed ?
" I am not sure , my dear girl , but that it may be wise and specious to preserve that outward indifference .
I began to be really afraid of him now and looked at him with the greatest astonishment .
But in the general tumbling up of the family , his tumbling out in life somewhere , was a thing to transact itself somehow .
Give my love to your aunt , <NAME> dear , and implore her not to curse the viper that has crossed your path and blighted your existence .
We are liable to be tumbled out neck and crop at a moment 's notice .
The fulfilment of the second has not yet arrived .
Being by this time a perfect <NAME> and a complete success , she made a dash at the door which I had fortunately locked .
<NAME> is a Copious Language , and Trying to <NAME> .
The search continued for five days .
I would tell him before breakfast .
' I regarded myself as a refuge , for her , from the dangers and vicissitudes of life .
But to no purpose ; for still no trace of <NAME> revisited the light of the sun .
Now it was <NAME> , now one of my old Reading friends from whom I could not believe I had so recently parted .
To be sure , I do n't know why I should n't be wished a hundred mile away , for I have not much to do with all this ! "
I bought it of an individual that he gave it to , and that lived here after him .
' O me , O me , my lungs is weak , my lungs is bad !
For how does it stand ?
A pleasant journey to you .
Is that so ? ' ' Yes , ma ' am ; indeed it is .
The atrocity in its full extent no longer exists , but there is enough of it left to give rise to occurrences that make the heart bleed .
It must not be supposed ( or it would be a gross injustice to Mr Quilp ) that he was tortured by any disinterested anxiety on behalf of either .
I could not afford to lose him , but you will bring him safe back. ' ' Well !
There was nothing of high mark in this .
Let us walk. ' ' But you will be so tired , my love. ' ' Oh no !
But you had better ask <NAME> if you want to know. ' ' I wonder he doesn ' t call , ' said <NAME> after thinking a moment .
" My amiable child , " murmured <NAME> , adjusting his cravat .
' Aha ! ' said the fat boy .
Now send me out feet foremost ! ' "
' Do you think of soon returning to the old country ? ' says I .
' You ' re wanted inside here. ' ' Has Mr Abel forgotten anything , I wonder ? ' said <NAME> as he dismounted .
' What is the matter ? ' exclaimed <NAME> , running to support her .
The bookcase , glazed and locked , repudiated all familiarities .
' <NAME> , young woman ; you know who this is ? ' ' It ' s Mrs. <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
Of which , to do her justice , she was wholly innocent , in thought , word , or deed .
" Look here , " says <NAME> , recoiling .
And this is his wife , Mrs .
You do n't know how well ! "
The Jew was no sooner alone , than his countenance resumed its former expression of anxiety and thought .
'The reason of all this , ' replied <NAME> .
" It 's just as likely as not , " said <NAME> , " one of these days ; though there 's plenty of time for that , my dear .
He could turn cramp-bones into chessmen ; fashion Roman chariots from old court cards ; make spoked wheels out of cotton reels , and bird-cages of old wire .
' From <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> .
The glazed hat made quite a show in the sun with its glistening , and the <NAME> continued to wave it until he could be seen no longer .
You have heard the dreadful nonsense he has been guilty of this night , and the manner in which he has gone on with that poor unfortunate little old maid .
I recommend you to take yourself off , and be talked to presently , you fool !
They ran to the window , downstairs , and into the street .
She was a woman of about forty , I supposed , -- but I may have thought her younger than she was .
Do nothing for me ; that ' s all .
She hired a crossing-sweeping boy to show it her .
He was a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before .
Really I didn ' t know that I had .
Your letter is like you , and what could I say of it that would be higher praise than that ?
He had repeatedly said he would have <NAME> ' s life .
<NAME> had made good speed while <NAME> was absent , and with his help everything was soon ready for their departure .
But his desire was to the utmost to satisfy <NAME> ( whatever that was ) , and take up all its drafts upon him for tribute .
' You have done me an unmerited service .
It is , perhaps , hardly in the nature of woman to receive such attentions as the Major once lavished upon myself without betraying some sense of obligation .
And the parlour couldn ' t bear straighter either .
' We ' d have had a young gentleman to meet you , if we had known you were coming , ' retorted <NAME> , nothing abashed .
The town , which was sluggish and uninteresting enough , was something like the back of an <NAME> watering-place , out of the season .
She gives me nothing but reproaches , my <NAME> , for all I have done for her .
He was always foremost among them .
I have seen it displayed with such success , that I have encountered some fine ladies and gentlemen who might as well have been born caterpillars .
" What else can be the consequence , " said <NAME> , in explanation , " if he will cut the cheese ?
If my time had run out , it would have left me still at the height of my perplexities , I dare say .
I have no hope of its being untrue , but at least I may verify it. " <NAME> nodded .
Being a great reader of all kinds of literature ( and never at all apologetic for that weakness ) , he sat down comfortably to read .
' This is unfortunate , ' said <NAME> .
He gives me the cold shoulder on this very matter as if he had had nothing to do with it , instead of being the first to propose it .
' I have put the words close to my heart .
" My friend the law-stationer 's good lady , over there , " says <NAME> , luring Mrs. Snagsby forward with the finger .
' If the young man comes to be a teacher here , let him understand , at once , that we don ' t want any foolery about the boys .
<NAME> , in its best sense , was for me no more .
I hope he does , I am sure . "
I WILL see her when I please .
' The very house I live in , ' sighed the poor gentleman , ' may be taken from me tomorrow .
'Oh , you little un-grate-ful , mur-de-rous , hor-rid villain ! '
' I don ' t know what to make of it , ' said <NAME> .
One of two remarkable circumstances is indisputably a fact , with reference to that class of society who travel in these boats .
That was their meeting , their conversation , and their parting .
They violate equally the justice that should belong to <NAME> , and the restraints that should belong to gentlemen .
I never commit myself hastily in any affair , and from what I see of this , I by no means like the appearance of it .
He can ' t help his likings and dislikings , perhaps .
' By no means , ' said <NAME> .
" My son , " said he , " it 's two o'clock .
' I expect him every instant , sir , ' said <NAME> .
' My brother <NAME> is a fine fellow , a great fellow ! ' exclaimed brother <NAME> as he shut the door and returned to <NAME> .
' Can I do anything more , sir ? ' I thanked him and said , <NAME> ; but would he take no dinner himself ?
His legs , which , being long , were afflicted with weakness , graced a pair of Oxford- mixture trousers , made to show the full symmetry of those limbs .
" Is he changed ? " <NAME> asked her .
I had come in with an idea of distinguishing myself rather , conceiving that I was very well prepared ; but it turned out to be quite a mistake .
' Again I think I may say , that ' s not impossible .
'It is hard , ' said the good doctor , turning away as he spoke ; 'so young ; so much beloved ; but there is very little hope . '
" How do I know it , <NAME> ?
" Your servant , gentlemen ; I 've been dozing .
When they reached the passage , he laid his finger on his lip , and drawing close to the girl , said , in a whisper .
he said , laying the bundle on the table .
<NAME> <NAME> was between <NAME> and me in the pew ; but I heard her sing , and the congregation vanished .
' Ay , ay ? ' cried the <NAME> , lifting up his bushy eyebrows a little .
'She sold it , ' cried Monks , with desperate eagerness ; 'did she sell it ?
<NAME> , you old man , grey .
<NAME> bowed his acknowledgments , and was unfeignedly glad to see the cloth laid .
' Then if I row up under the <NAME> and lay there , no need to whistle .
In that event , no doubt , he would establish the <NAME> and the <NAME> , and a little annual <NAME> to <NAME> .
Then I will tell you why .
" My instructions are that this boy is to move on . "
' You hear this , girl ? ' said Mr Dombey sternly to the black-eyed .
' They must not , indeed , ' rejoined <NAME> firmly , as he prepared to leave the house .
His Uncle and he lay under a great obligation to Mr Dombey , which was of <NAME> ' s own soliciting .
She stopped before a shabby little house , as closely shut up as a house that was full of cracks and crevices could be .
' I said , ' he began , ' when I saw you last , that there was something unexplained , which might perhaps influence you .
But as yet , the neighbourhood was shy to own the <NAME> .
While it was preparing , I went to <NAME> and inquired for <NAME> ; she was still very ill , though considered something better .
<NAME> thou know thot ? ' ' Oh , ah !
Many people are singularly like each other .
I watched him when you were laying on to little Bolder this afternoon .
He wandered on again , irresolute and undecided , and oppressed with the fear of another solitary night .
' Very well , ' said Mrs. Micawber .
It was but a day gone , and <NAME> had brought the tears into my eyes ; they had soon dried , God forgive me !
<NAME> , ' said <NAME> , solemnly , ' is more easier conceived than described .
He rambled through the scenes of his old pursuits -- through many where <NAME> lost him as she listened -- sometimes for hours .
<NAME> tell me thou bean ' t , efther yon chap at schoolmeasther ' s , " says I .
Mr Toots , to whom the question seemed perplexing , suggested ' <NAME> ' em. ' But Mr <NAME> did not appear to think that would do .
I saw you looking at it yesterday .
" I do n't know , " says Jo , staring moodily at the veil , " nothink about no papers .
I know him ! " He darkly closed an eye at <NAME> 's name , and shook his head .
He spoke in a slushy voice , as if much mud had washed into his throat .
I have the honour to attend court regularly .
<NAME> is the wild idea that flutters through her mind .
" You have my free consent -- a small gift from such a mother to her injured child ! -- but do not tell me of it .
I saw it. ' ' To be sure it was in the open street , ' she observed , after a few moments of less and less angry reflection .
Even this , though , when <NAME> looked at it with increasing steadiness , was not its strangest quality .
But Mr Tite <NAME> was a buttoned-up man , and consequently a weighty one .
She was looking wonderfully well when I quitted it. ' ' Mrs Merdle , ' said Mr Merdle , ' is generally considered a very attractive woman .
' And <NAME> ' ll_ take care , ' said <NAME> internally ; and they entered the house .
The life is more than she can bear .
And to breakfast with whom but his near neighbours , the <NAME> of <NAME> , who have imparted to him that he will meet his distant kinsman , Mr Fledgely .
A woman more angry , passionate , reckless , and revengeful never lived .
It was from the lips of such a tutor , that the child learnt her easy task .
Not bad quarters , either , " says <NAME> , looking round again .
The President rang his bell ; but , The <NAME> , warming with encouragement , shrieked , " I defy that bell ! " wherein she was likewise much commended .
And in the nod and in the firm set of her mouth , there was a vigour of purpose not to be doubted .
The burden of proof lay with <NAME> ; and he produced his evidence that very day at dinner .
Not so gaily , but that the brilliant furniture seemed to stare her out of countenance as if it insisted on being compared with the dingy furniture at home .
I was not wholly indifferent , for I had a hope of being pleasant and useful to <NAME> .
I pass to worse news .
' Have you many scholars , sir ? ' she asked .
<NAME> , but almost as dismal .
' We can never be too cautious , ' said Mr Brass .
<NAME> , if you have any love for your father , you had better not join that gang .
Should the <NAME> have refused the note ?
But when <NAME> told him what was really the matter , <NAME> , after a moment ' s reflection , started up into full activity .
It was past in a moment , and I listened again , and heard the footstep stumble in coming on .
She stole away to bed as quickly as she could , and when she was alone , gave free vent to the sorrow with which her breast was overcharged .
You must go. ' ' I would rather not , ' she said to the Doctor .
' <NAME> ! ' said <NAME> , suddenly turning to him .
That was a fatal blow .
' Now , godmother , ' she went on , ' I particularly wish to ask you what has taken place here , since I left the wolf here ?
Is there any light a-comin ? "
There was not one gleam of interest , parental recognition , or relenting in it .
" My Lady is looking charmingly well , " says Mrs. Rouncewell with another curtsy .
<NAME> was delighted to hear him express the opinion .
Then , what submission , what cringing and fawning , what servility , what abject humiliation !
I think -- but I really can ' t say , sir .
' No vay at all ? ' inquired <NAME> .
" You do n't mean that , I am sure ? "
And there would be no Circuit to go .
And drew a long breath .
' Though , by-the-bye , I suppose it was one of that family that pinted me out ? ' ' No .
Of course I was in love with little Em ' ly .
" Ah , but I do n't know , " replies Jo , shaking his head fearfully , " as he DO N'T hear . "
' " You will never leave me , " murmured the young lady .
Do not fear , Mr Boffin , that I shall contaminate the premises which your gold has bought , with <NAME> lowly pursuits .
' We ' ll try and find out. ' Mrs. Squeers , being out of breath with her exertions , complied .
" You do n't mean -- " <NAME> begins .
He is much too deep for me .
She looked at me , with some fluttering wonder in her face .
' YOUR varnish is fading. ' Mrs <NAME> descended and went in .
Seeing it , he poured out and drank another glassful .
' Be careful what you say , old boy , for this is a serious matter .
I encouraged <NAME> in this idea , because I felt that it might one day be consolatory to her .
He looked back when he had got the street-door open .
' The noose , sir ? ' retorted <NAME> .
Forasmuch as they hang in my memory by only this one slender thread , I do n't know what they did , except that they forbore to remove me .
Manners fit for a crown !
Those interests are now paramount in this office .
Shall I tell you on what accusation ?
<NAME> , after hesitating an instant , complied .
We were both very much surprised , coming higher up , to find my outer door standing open ( which I had shut ) and to hear voices inside .
He undid it slowly , leering and laughing at me , before he began to turn them over , and threw it there .
Not absolutely always , for she could recall some occasions on which her power had failed ; but they were few and slight , and she believed them over .
' <NAME> , my dear , ' taking her to the open window , ' where they live !
' It is him , ' said Mr Wegg , ' and he is capable of it .
The soldiers were in front of us , extending into a pretty wide line with an interval between man and man .
Tell your other friend to get his head painted for the sign of some public-house , and to get it done by a sign-painter .
<NAME> take <NAME> and me and <NAME> to Putney ! ' So they went , very soon after the funeral .
These were not the only members of the <NAME> family who turned it to account .
Once upon a time -- of all the good days in the year , on <NAME> -- old <NAME> sat busy in his counting-house .
" <NAME> put him in the hospital , guv'ner , and the hospital put him -- in a glass-case , I HAVE heerd , " <NAME> replies mysteriously .
And she is , no doubt .
' What he has on his mind. ' ' I ought first to see for myself that he has something on his mind , I think , ' said <NAME> .
Also , when we played at cards <NAME> would look on , with a miserly relish of <NAME> 's moods , whatever they were .
To this manoeuvre he accordingly resorted .
' There ' s <NAME> , little Bolder , <NAME> , and what ' s his name. ' ' So there is , ' rejoined <NAME> .
' There was a girl called <NAME> .
They have descended a gentle slope , and enter upon a level , as compact and dry as a solid block of marble , two miles long .
I want particularly to know all about her. ' ' I ' ll take care , <NAME> , ' said the boy .
" At least there is no opposition to YOU , " <NAME> asserts with confidence .
My own two hands , and feet likewise , being very cold , however , on this particular occasion , I crept below at midnight .
But he said you and I began it , and as he had me there -- for we did -- I put our acquaintance on the old footing .
' I ' m not a going to keep you , even , above an hour , ' said <NAME> .
' <NAME> , ' said Mr Rugg , taking him by the hand , ' you are a young man that it does one good to come across .
and Mrs. M ' Choakumchild never make any mistakes themselves , I suppose , <NAME> ? ' ' O no ! ' she eagerly returned .
But she had never seen so singular a smile as that upon this lady ' s face .
There are three meals a day .
' <NAME> early , no ! ' replied <NAME> .
Will you grant me time -- any length of time ?
' Mr <NAME> , sir , we should fall to work cheerfully , and not in a despondent state .
<NAME> ' t he , pretty ? ' -- or , when he got downstairs , making another trial at that verse of <NAME> .
At that instant -- ' Little <NAME> ! ' cried the voice behind him .
She was going to leave it in a fortnight ; the child couldn ' t recommend her to another , she supposed ?
They are sought by so many , and they are granted ( comparatively ) to so few !
The girl performed her office with such expedition , that in a very few minutes the coach was ready .
I could have no other motive , <NAME> , in keeping anything from you. ' ' I know that well , ' said I .
Who ' s got to say anything agin it ?
All right behind , and full inside ? ' ' All right , old feller , ' replied the embarrassed gentleman .
' I can ' t help it , indeed , sir , ' rejoined the boy , crying .
Not that I need mention it , for it hardly seems to belong to anything .
You signified to me , when I called t ' other morning , that you were .
<NAME> , he never came , all day , between the morning and the night .
See how taut the line is ! ' ' I must have it up , ' said Mr Inspector .
The other may be taste ; but this is reason .
'There is somebody else who should not be forgotten , by the bye , ' said <NAME> , ringing the bell .
' And he can hardly believe it , either , ' said <NAME> , when he returned , ' nor nobody will .
Back again it stole to the window -- then turned its head towards her .
Come the roll of wheels and a violent ringing at the bell .
I never was so much afraid of anyone .
You are reproaching me , underhanded , with having nobody but you to look to .
If his wife was present , she would throw oil upon the waters .
Of the common folk , that is merely bundled up in turf and brambles , the less said the better .
' I have had disappointments to contend against , ' said <NAME> , looking very grim ; ' <NAME> ' s father was two pound ten short .
As she gave way for us , she went softly in and put what we had brought near the miserable bed on which the mother slept .
I wonder whether it ever crept into his mind who that unfortunate some one was ! ' ' I wonder whether I shall sleep to-night !
What need to say that ?
' Then this garden , ' resumed <NAME> .
The driver wanted no directions , but lashed his horse into full speed , without the delay of an instant .
' " Disband them ! " cried the baron , in amazement .
The Major , in a fit of curiosity , has charged the <NAME> to watch the house sometimes , and find out what becomes of <NAME> .
She ' s your master ' s wife , ' returned the old woman .
There is no other principle distinctly , certainly , and consistently maintained through all its narrow turnings .
' It is all I could do for my children -- I have done it .
<NAME> ! ' -- as to that , they might perhaps speak of it at another time , but would say no more now .
His employer would see to that , sir .
The cart had very nearly given up , but labours on a little more .
Mr <NAME> shrugged his shoulders , and <NAME> sat rigid .
'To be sure it would , my dear , ' replied the Jew .
You have had more than two guineas from me , already .
' Putting both your hands afore your face too ! ' she went on .
Live and let live , we say to them .
" Being quite a child , sir , " said I , " and so different from other people -- " " You are right ! "
" With the greatest pleasure , sir ! "
How could she be otherwise than useful and happy ! ' ' <NAME> any -- ' I was thinking aloud , rather than speaking .
' How queer they ' re standing. ' ' Hush , can ' t you ? ' replied <NAME> softly .
Will you let me give it you ?
' This matter is growing alarming , ' reasoned <NAME> with himself .
I told him that we had but just left a coach and were going -- but then I was obliged to look at my companion .
" I went home , <NAME> , <NAME> , at night and found this young woman having supper with my wife , Mrs. Bucket .
'Bless their dear little hearts ! '
<NAME> ? ' ' He shall not , through any act of mine , come back wi ' the unmerited reproach of being brought back .
' Look at <NAME> , ' whispered <NAME> to Bella when this was done , and they stood over the roasting fowls .
He threw himself upon the chair .
" No ; but before I go on , " said <NAME> , shaking his head in his bullying way , " I 'll have this out with you .
He was a hard man , and would never bate an ounce of plate or a bottle of wine .
<NAME> , downright , faithful earnestness. ' ' If you only knew the earnestness of <NAME> , aunt ! ' I cried .
His removal , to make way for other accused persons who were to be tried , rescued him from these caresses for the moment .
He therefore hastily betook himself to the top of the house , and made the best arrangement of it that his imagination and his means suggested .
Or I could make you a handy little set of drawers , to keep your silks and threads and scraps in .
Never any other name. ' ( It was she who whispered it . )
Just what you used to be , now I look at you !
I have thrown these few notes together , because the subject of them was well known to me for many years .
The dignified old gentleman turned out to be <NAME> , who had been maintained by the <NAME> Office for many years as a representative of the <NAME> abroad .
<NAME> requires that he should gain by marriage .
Oh , we may give him joy !
No muffling up in furs and broadcloth kept it out .
The large <NAME> was our great attraction because she had come into the downs in the night .
" Say what you have got to say ! "
Good-bye ! ' The last words were spoken aloud , as the vigilant <NAME> stopped , turned his head , and looked at them from the bottom of the staircase .
It is <NAME> ' s birthday ; and , on our road , <NAME> discourses to me of the good fortune he has enjoyed .
Personally ! ' repeated <NAME> , in an impatient manner .
Being in for a penny , I am ready , as the saying is , to be in for a pound .
Which is he ? " This is he ; this helpless , inarticulately murmuring , wandering old man pointed out .
Tarrying here , only that day and night , to recruit after our late fatigues , we started off once more upon our last journey in <NAME> .
' I ca n't help it , ' said <NAME> , ' I ca n't help it !
The lounger had lounged out of view , and <NAME> and <NAME> were gone .
" After what you let out the other day , <NAME> may as well not know of it .
<NAME> will surely not deny to <NAME> what it concedes to the butterflies ! "
<NAME> suggests the law list .
" Let it go to the four winds for to-night .
A calculated , cast up , balanced , and proved house .
' Perhaps , my dear , <NAME> would like to drink our healths , ' said <NAME> , fumbling in her reticule for some small coin .
' I am still more sorry to hear that , ' said <NAME> , gently .
But enough of him , and of all the rest of them .
' Is it bright enough now ? ' said <NAME> .
' <NAME> ! ' said the old man fondling with her hair .
' I persuaded him to take a walk this morning .
<NAME> was dispatched to the different ale-houses in the village , furnished with the best description <NAME> could give of the appearance and dress of the strangers .
' Who then ? ' ' Can you not guess who then ? ' ' I do not choose to guess , ' she answered .
growled Coavinses with an appearance of strong resentment .
<NAME> is what that Somebody must look for , to sustain him and improve him , <NAME> .
Neither of us would do .
'Call a coach , somebody , pray .
' I am astonished to hear this news , ' said <NAME> .
But at night it had come on to rain in torrents , and all night long it had rained without cessation .
He is down upon the pavement ; and the crowd eagerly gather round him : each new comer , jostling and struggling with the others to catch a glimpse .
The doctor appeared much of the same opinion himself .
exclaimed <NAME> , " I am happy to meet <NAME> and to have the opportunity of tendering my personal regrets .
But there is no one there. " " What is the meaning of One Hundred and <NAME> , <NAME> ? " asked <NAME> .
" Never mind what you read just now , sir ; I do n't ask you what you read just now .
He is the most intolerable scoundrel on the face of the earth .
<NAME> enough to have his own happy home and his own household gods -- and household goddess , too , perhaps ? "
His head was sunk upon his bosom , and perpetual snoring , with a partial choke occasionally , were the only audible indications of the great man ' s presence .
But for no money ! -- Bosh ! ' What does <NAME> say ?
I hope so ; I am not disappointed. ' ' You know how I am loved at home , and how I love home .
It will warm your heart .
He has a motive , and of course his motive is a dark motive .
I could get nobody till five minutes ago ; and I 've run here all the way . '
If it had been in my constitution to be a lighter grubber , I might ha ' got into lighter trouble .
I 'm more cumfbler nor you ca n't think .
You needn ' t break with him altogether , but leave him .
I had heard them , alone at the bedside , striking their boots with their riding-whips , and loitering up and down .

I had come out of <NAME> , over one of the great passes of the <NAME> , and had since wandered with a guide among the by-ways of the mountains .
However that was , <NAME> ' s skirts were very speedily heard outside , coming along -- one might almost have said bouncing along -- with unusual expedition .
Do n't you take any pride out of yourself ?
If she could be translated to heaven to-morrow , she might be expected to ascend without any rapture .
To me , parting is a painful thing .
He is sharp enough , ' said <NAME> , impatiently .
They changed clothes at the cottage .
" I have had experience since .
He felt it so earnestly , that he turned quite rational , and positively interdicted any further allusion to <NAME> ' s adventures for some days to come .
Let all young men present mark this : ' The maidens all flocked to his boat so readily. ' ( <NAME> cheers , in which the ladies joined . )
The words were scarcely uttered when <NAME> darted across the road , slunk among the crowd , and disappeared in an instant .
Little Dorrit then put her arm round her father ' s neck , to bid him good night .
She made him her stately curtsey in the garden , one morning before breakfast .
" It seems unkind to leave him , <NAME> .
' Has he ? ' replied the widow lady .
' Face like a peach ! ' standing on tiptoe to pinch my cheek as I sat .
Shake the dust from thy feet and let him go .
I am not clear whether it was six or seven .
" They are great weaknesses -- <NAME> , sir , they are great .
' Good gracious , <NAME> , no ! ' returned the <NAME> , with tears in his eyes .
What reason have you to be morose ?
' My idea , ' exclaimed <NAME> , ' is now about the size of an orange .
<NAME> <NAME> , and all the great people , and all the morning water-drinkers , met in grand assemblage .
" May I ask you a question ? "
Says he , 'Sir , why did you eat spring lamb at eighteen pence a pound ? '
'Not a bit of it , ' replied <NAME> .
<NAME> searches the floor for some time longer , then looks up for a moment , and then down again .
' <NAME> ' t ye believe a bit on it. ' ' Yes , yes , it is , ' cried Mrs. Gummidge .
" It shall not be repeated .
Lastly , it was no one , and I was no one .
Mrs <NAME> also , as a leading lady rich in distinction , elegance , grace , and beauty , he mentioned in very laudatory terms .
They were calculating and reflecting persons , who had not yet been convinced by the arguments of either party , although they had frequent conferences with each .
<NAME> brought down his hands , looked over his shoulder , and begged to thank <NAME> for her vindication of his character .
But , at last I began , in a purblind groping way , to read , write , and cipher , on the very smallest scale .
If people are so silly as to indulge the sentiment , is it my fault ?
He would take the air there presently and get an appetite for his hotel dinner .
<NAME> by little you will know me better , and the time will come when you will know me , as I know myself .
' Happy she is , beyond all doubt , ' said Mr Garland .
However , here was a model before him .
What more he was , or what else he had in him , if anything , let him show for himself .
His notion was , that he would find the body ; he only found a shirt-pin sticking in some mud and ooze .
Therefore ( or you could not say so ) you must have set up some views as mine .
He glares at her as he smokes ; and then , his eyes becoming filmy , answers : ' That ' s the journey. ' Silence ensues .
' No ; I am not going to have that done , <NAME> .
screamed the Jew , starting from his seat .
Your reputation is high , and , as a young man with your fortune to make , you are probably mindful of your interest .
He fears he will die of joy , before he gets among them .
'This is pretty treatment , sir , ' said <NAME> , throwing down his hat and cloak , 'from my father 's oldest friend . '
' Soon the lady makes a singular and exciting discovery .
Now , pray say no more about it .
I have never broken the condition once .
' Stop till I come back .
He is a public offender .
But it was not I .
Not so the eyes upon the bed .
He smiled , said , ' I ask your pardon , my dear , ' and threw it out of window .
The whole structure is not yet finished , but it is already one of considerable size and extent , and is capable of accommodating a very large number of patients .
' I raly can not contain myself , ' said Mrs. Cluppins , ' when I think of such perjury .
With this , he whipped his sword out , and made a lunge at my uncle without further ceremony .
I had known , from the time when I could speak , that my sister , in her capricious and violent coercion , was unjust to me .
' The fame of the gentleman in question , never reached my ears. ' ' No , sir ! ' exclaimed <NAME> .
His curiosity was therefore satisfied , and putting on his spectacles he prepared himself to watch the play which was just commencing .
She is dozing probably , for she gives no heed to his steps as he comes toward her .
It was very cold , and , a collier coming by us , with her galley-fire smoking and flaring , looked like a comfortable home .
I quickened my pace , and knocked at the door with my hand .
As if he denied himself the pleasure of uttering it , lest he should soar too high ; and his meekness therefore preferred to be unmeaning .
Therefore I have no other object in this , than what <NAME> has mentioned .
It might be the making of our fortune to make a clean sweep of them both .
" To be registered ? " " To be registered , as doomed to destruction , " returned <NAME> .
I hear <NAME> and the rest of them say to the new faces , 'Here 's little Miss Flite .
' I am very sorry , indeed , for all this .
You will have no objection , I dare say , to your great expectations being encumbered with that easy condition .
' It isn ' t fair. ' ' You don ' t keep many cooks , and can easily apologise to them for the trouble , ' retorted <NAME> .
' Well , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
We make a feast of the event , and you will be made the hero of it . "
' That ' s kind of you to ask .
' I knew but too well what all this meant .
When does the gentleman return to <NAME> ? ' ' At six this evening. ' ' Bless ye and thank ye .
What colour , and what texture ! "
' So I was ! ' ' How was the bride dressed ?
' No , ' replied <NAME> , with equal abruptness .
" It is the fashion , " growled the man .
Has either anything to do with my wishing to live quite secret and retired here ?
' Nothing ! ' said the lady , looking up .
He referred to them , as if she were lying in our presence .
I am like one who died young .
The state expressly asks him to trust to <NAME> .
My head ached with wondering how it happened , if men were neither fools nor rascals ; and my heart ached to think they could possibly be either .
I wonder whether they called in <NAME> , and he was in vain ; and if so , how he likes to be reminded of it once a week .
And , he said , <NAME> forbid that <NAME> should be there in any other character than in his present voluntary character !
' <NAME> , steady ! ' said the <NAME> to <NAME> , ' what ' s amiss with you ?
They leave <NAME> , without a ruffle on the surface of his unfathomable depths , drinking his old wine , and go down into the streets .
" After not setting eyes upon you or hearing of you for so long a time , do I find you here ! " " Do n't call me <NAME> .
The same eyes followed her to the door ; and in their light , and on the tranquil face , there was a smile when it was closed .
They searched every nook and corner round , together and separately ; they shouted , whistled , laughed , called -- and all with the same result .
" I have no patience with him , " observed <NAME> 's niece .
Seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point , the gentlemen withdrew .
' Oh , indeed ! ' I observed faintly .
Not a bad notion though , if you want to look indifferent in driving a bargain .
I never stirred in all that time from the <NAME> side , whither I had gone at first .
I have no remembrance of the process. " <NAME> Attorney-General sat down , and the father and daughter sat down together .
And four wooden legs are more troublesome to you than two , when you don ' t want any. ' Mr Pancks concluded by blowing off that steam of his .
The baby soon appeared , carried in great glory by <NAME> ; while <NAME> , in custody of that active young constable , <NAME> , brought up the rear .
Get me a coach ! ' However much astonished I might be , I was sensible that I had no right to refuse compliance with such a peremptory command .
But there are such places yonder. ' ' And far from here ? ' said <NAME> .
' Here ' s my dear boy -- my dear boy , <NAME> , who brought us together , <NAME> !
You quite surprise me ! ' And again he uttered never a word .
' My dear love , ' said <NAME> .
Why , only think how old she looked .
Accidents , miseries , and offences , were never to be mentioned before her .
The time will come -- and soon enough -- when you will understand this better , and will feel it too , as no one save a woman can . "
I wish he was , poor man ! '
That makes no noise , and is quite as certain , and more genteel .
" Now , do n't echo , " I retorted .
I am born to be served .
They have a motive for exertion and becoming pride , in the desire to make these little chambers comfortable and decent .
' <NAME> is quite comfortable now , <NAME> , ' I remarked , for his satisfaction .
The supposed <NAME> descends , and the seamstress is lifted out next after him .
<NAME> , my love , your hand here. ' ' Oh dear !
' He always came into the garden to say good night .
Quietly , quietly , the reflected marks of the prison bars and of the zig-zag iron on the wall-top , faded away .
<NAME> tinge of damask revisiting cheek .
He belonged to the world again .
Who do you suppose is with me ? "
'Very much so indeed , ma'am , ' said the beadle .
We must tell papa about it either to-night or to-morrow , according to the opportunities .
I am proud to make your acquaintance .
" Regular rules ! " Here , he skipped from his right leg on to his left .
You have heard him say so fifty times .
Why , here ' s your father , <NAME> !
'Oh yes , I can talk .
" Thank you , <NAME> , " says <NAME> with his usual equanimity .
Give me something , or I ' ll call it after you ! ' croaked the old woman , passionately .
' Why , you ' ve been having the place cleaned up ! ' he exclaimed .
He quite enters into it .
A secretary is worth so much in the market , and I ought to give it and no more .
He had walked no more than twelve miles , when night closed in again .
<NAME> ' t ask me to desist ; there is a -- hum -- a general principle involved here , which rises even above considerations of -- ha -- hospitality .
The Captain therefore hemmed to clear his throat , and read the letter aloud .
' I know so little of the gentleman , ' said <NAME> , hesitating , ' I know you do , ' interrupted <NAME> , clasping <NAME> by the shoulder .
Everybody and anybody has been in my confidence as yet , but now I think I ' ll set up in business for myself .
said the girl , stooping over him , and pointing to the door as she looked cautiously round .
I wish you good night , Mr Clennam. ' ' And mind you don ' t forget us , you know , <NAME> , ' said the Father .
Words , sir , never influence the course of the cards , or the course of the dice .
The day seems different to me from every other day , and the light not of the same colour -- of a sadder colour .
I ' ll not accompany you , I ' ll not follow you , if you will reply. ' ' How can I , Mr Wrayburn ?
I started at every footstep and every sound , believing that he was discovered and taken , and this was the messenger to tell me so .
' I am as cheerful , father , as I usually am , or usually have been. ' ' That ' s well , ' said <NAME> .
However , I will never rest ( if only in remembrance of Mr Fledgeby ' s having kissed my hand ) until my husband does see it .
' Well I am sure , <NAME> , my dear , you ' re very polite ! ' replied <NAME> .
" From the Hulks ! " " Oh-h ! " said I , looking at <NAME> .
And even now , with this case , I hesitate .
Since the business is to be done by some hands , let it be done by mine .
Somehow or other—from its being so quiet , I suppose—I have taken it into my head that there is nobody there .
' I never heard of that , ' interrupted Monks in a tone intended to appear incredulous , but savouring more of disagreeable surprise .
Alarm-bells ringing , drums beating , the sea raging and thundering on its new beach , the attack began .
' This here red-nosed man , <NAME> , wisits your mother-in-law vith a kindness and constancy I never see equalled .
Mr <NAME> was the second , and jogged close after him , looking at no other object .
You ai n't looked slowly forward to this as I have ; you wos n't prepared for this as I wos .
" If you get into debt , you must pay your debts or take the consequences .
They drew him to my very feet -- insensible -- dead .
where did mine learn better ?
It was him as pointed out to me where <NAME> was .
" <NAME> , you 'll understand me , if you think a moment .
If you are not too headstrong to accept of a bit of dinner , here it is . "
said <NAME> , beckoning over the banisters .
You must make haste. ' ' Oh , I ' m in no hurry , ' said <NAME> , very sharply .
' <NAME> , <NAME> , ' cried the boy , still reddening and laughing , boy-like .
( He changed the leg he had crossed over the other , and tried the calculation again , but could not bring out the total at less . )
I know not what to liken it to .
<NAME> <NAME> gave his consent gruff -- but gave it .
There was a remarkable darkness of colour on it , and the brow was more contracted .
If you were to ask me who somebody is , upon my word I could n't tell you .
What do you go in for ?
At sight of their perjured relative , <NAME> turned faint and pale , and <NAME> rose majestically .
He turned white , as she held her hand up like an enchantress , at whose invocation the sound had come .
His confidential agent eyed it keenly .
We never could associate , never could communicate , never probably from that time forth could interchange another word on earth .
If I showed any trace of what I felt , my own sorrows were sufficient to account for it .
You have nothing to reproach yourself with .
' Now , sir , ' said <NAME> , ' all is safe and quiet .
He did n't make a very desperate resistance , miss !
With those words , the Jew , stooping down , placed the candle on an upper flight of stairs , exactly opposite to the room door .
He was mooning about , I suppose , taking liberties with people ' s chins ; but there he was , somehow .
Not a great fortune , forty and odd pounds for the inheritor of a hundred and odd thousand !
' Wery good , wery good , ' said <NAME> .
I hated that man with all a madman ' s hate .
' Not inside -- I ' ll be damned if you ' re going inside , ' said the strange man .
On deck , I took leave of poor Mrs. Micawber .
' Not the lad I speak on , ' said the <NAME> .
' Not even going ; gone. ' ' Has he turned girl or baby ? ' muttered <NAME> , with a fretful gesture .
As soon as he had apologized for the remissness of his memory , he asked me if he should send <NAME> for <NAME> ?
' I expect a letter from the solicitor respecting that mortgage of <NAME> ' s .
' There are many vessels leaving the port , I suppose , ' replied <NAME> .
HE was NOT an engraver. ' ( Here Mr <NAME> said , with no reason whatever , Of course not . )
" I hear you , sir , in the dark , but I 'm a-gropin -- a-gropin -- let me catch hold of your hand . "
' You are monstrous polite , ma ' am , ' said <NAME> .
Does he think to reduce me by long absence ?
And in this nation , there are fifty millions of money .
The fruits of the earth have their growth in corruption .
Why indeed , Mrs. Bagnet expresses with the umbrella .
' And I never was so glad to see it. ' ' Tell your master to make his box-seat wider , then , ' returned the passenger .
He put them , one by one , in the breast of his inner coat , counted out the money for them , and deliberately left the shop .
From this soft mood she was soon aroused , with a very wholesome and refreshing effect , by the voice of Mrs Pipchin outside the door .
' Run for <NAME> , ' cried <NAME> , menacing the page with both fists .
A movement of timid curiosity impelled her , when she approached the spot , to glance towards the fire .
Alone again , in his own room , Mr <NAME> applied himself to work , and worked all day .
He must have some object .
<NAME> for furniture of offices , so much .
<NAME> , brother Ned ? ' ' For nothing at all , ' said brother Ned .
' And somebody ' s beating a carpet , I think ? ' ' Mr Fledgeby ' s carpet , I dare say , ' replied the smiling lady .
That was his nephew , ' I replied ; ' whom he adopted , though , as a son .
' That ' s not an answer , sir , ' said <NAME> , ' to my remark .
" Bring your chair here , and speak on. " He complied as to the chair , but appeared to find the speaking on less easy .
" They 'd say , " returned my sister , curtly , " pretty well .
I saw him to-night , about eight -- helped him to shut up his shop -- and he had got the letters then in his hairy cap .
<NAME> , and taking pains , too , for I know what such pains are .
<NAME> <NAME> gently shook his head to impose silence on his friend , and resumed : 'Do you know where this poor boy is now ? '
' <NAME> and quiet as the <NAME> .
I can ' t find it ! ' All this time sobbing , and searching in the little reticule .
How easy my path , how much easier than his !
I came here to take leave of it before its change .
You saw my family with me , perhaps ?
Will you not let me come near you ? ' ' How can you ask me ?
<NAME> is steeped in money to the throat , and talks and thinks of nothing else .
Perhaps your friend in the city does .
He is much to me. ' ' What can he be to you ? ' ' He can be a rival to me among other things , ' said <NAME> .
Mrs. Micawber shrieked , and folded <NAME> in her embrace .
We must fight our way onward .
He opened his eyes after a few seconds , and looked anxiously round .
I trust I disturb no one ; but there _was_ a paper-knife—O , thank you , I am sure ! ' and disappears with her prize .
' Night after night comes and goes , and I have no rest .
I showed him , <NAME> , at his window , to <NAME> , who was often the spy in the day .
O poor thing , poor thing ! ' These words through her fast-dropping tears .
Or do you kiss my hand in the same spirit in which I once let you kiss my cheek ? " " What spirit was that ? " said I .
' For this reason , ' resumed <NAME> , ' I address myself to you , ma ' am .
He held her clasped in his left arm , and between whiles her low voice was heard tenderly imploring him to go away with her .
' Old lady , ' returned Mr Boffin , ' you keep still .
' Bitter poor , my deary , ' replied the old woman .
I couldn ' t do it ! ' ' Why not ? ' returned the <NAME> , gazing at him in astonishment .
Leaving them together , I went home to <NAME> ' s ; more melancholy myself , if possible , than I had been yet .
<NAME> , old boy , " kissing him , " one for yourself , three for the children .
She was a devoted creature .
' You look very well , <NAME> , ' I said , thinking he would like to know it .
In fact , <NAME> ' s establishment was a great hot-house , in which there was a forcing apparatus incessantly at work .
On one of the fore-most chairs , stands The <NAME> , looking about for her friend .
The <NAME> church is represented , in this remote place , as in most other parts of <NAME> , by a gentleman of great worth and excellence .
He got down , and looked eagerly inside for the beautiful young lady .
she said in a whisper .
' Yes ; I ' m going , <NAME> , if you please , ' said <NAME> .
They joked freely with one another , but seldom with him .
" It is <NAME> , " said madame .
" Pretty witness , " he muttered , looking down into his glass .
Half-a-dozen have gone by within as many minutes .
In some few months less than another year , you know , I shall carry <NAME> off from school as Mrs. Edwin Drood .
' What course for me then ?
He is a stoutly built , steady-looking , sharp-eyed man in black , of about the middle-age .
" That 's the thing , sir , " repeated <NAME> with the greatest enthusiasm .
How ' s that ? ' ' I don ' t want to deceive you .
Under existing circumstances , there is no place like a great city when you are once in it .
' There is nothing else in all the world , ' she said , ' that would have wrung denial from me .
<NAME> smiled , as he said to <NAME> , ' You see , my experience of these things does not begin with myself .
The cell-door has been closed too long on all its hopes and cares .
What of it ? ' ' When do you think he ever told her that before ?
Thus <NAME> in the morning , and it buried <NAME> still many fathoms deeper than he had been buried in the night .
' I would far rather not see Mr Clennam. ' ' Oh , fie , fie , my dear , that ' s folly .
My Lady , as on that day , sits before the fire with her screen in her hand .
' You needn ' t , if you don ' t like , ma ' am , ' was his answer .
And yet as I sit at work , I smell miles of flowers .
' I could not have done it , but for the fortune in the waterproof belt round my body .
I 'll point her out at the proper time , ' said <NAME> .
" Why do you write in the public streets ?
" I knew this person by sight very well , " says he .
And there really was a churchyard outside under some cloisters , for I saw the gravestones from the staircase window .
Every benevolent inhabitant of this retreat had his name inscribed upon his stomach .
' Hurrah ! ' echoed <NAME> , taking off his hat and dashing it on the floor , and insanely casting his spectacles into the middle of the kitchen .
' Come , boy , come -- ' and so submitted to be led away .
I am confident he wants strength of purpose .
I begin to think he ' ll never wake , ' observed <NAME> .
' I suppose he will be back soon , ' he replied ; ' he has cut out and left me expecting him back , in an odd way .
asked <NAME> with his hand to his ear .
They walked all day , and slept that night at a small cottage where beds were let to travellers .
If he could see the least sparkle of relief in her face now ?
On one side of the house was a little stable , just the size for the pony , with a little room over it , just the size for <NAME> .
He spoke <NAME> perfectly well , though he had not begun to learn the language , he told me , until he was a young man grown .
The demoniacal passion of this Neville Landless , his strength in his fury , and his savage rage for the destruction of its object , appal me .
The heavy pillars which support the roof engender masses of black shade , but between them there are lanes of light .
He started , made a short run , and stopped and looked over his shoulder .
To <NAME> , a hop-grower. ' I am terribly dejected for about a week or two .
<NAME> pretended for a little while to be busily looking among the papers .
Now I am going to tell you all I can about them , because I know that is what you most want to hear .
To them I wish to add the money as she come away with .
' We have a good many of them ; that boy ' s one. ' ' Him in the next box ? ' said <NAME> .
' Hush ! ' he said , in a low voice .
I hope everybody here will lead them to believe that I died defying them , consistently and perseveringly , as I did through so many years . "
" How many did they say ? " " I do not understand you. " " -- At the last post .
" That is quite right , " said the lady , " <NAME> . "
Every one of 'em 's doing of it , from the time when I do n't get up , to the time when I do n't go to bed .
' Well , what is it ? ' ' <NAME> and <NAME> have taken Mrs. Bardell in execution for her costs , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
I should be dead in a week .
The <NAME> gazed upon him mildly .
He married his second wife privately , because he was proud , and in course of time she died .
I am aware , sir , that it would not become me to carry on my little traffic under the windows of your mansion .
I can not resist your prayer .
<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> got into the bin ; <NAME> ascended to his perch , and deposited his feet on a floor-clothed shelf , erected beneath it for that purpose .
' The quick eye of affection is not easily blinded , when of the female sex .
I shook my fists at <NAME> , who was as frantic as myself .
Do you guess that I have come to remind you of a promise ? '
What will he like him to be called ?
If it had n't been for the girl , I might have died . '
The world , however , was not in fault in <NAME> ' s case .
<NAME> <NAME> had sent for me , to see if she could take a fancy to me .
Now , boys , ' said Mrs. Squeers , mimicking , as nearly as she could , the voice and manner of the usher .
They 're early with the kitchen fire , and that denotes good servants .
Scarcely that , for it was a look of astonished and keen inquiry .
' Not they , sir , ' replied <NAME> , touching his hat .
' Now there , ' said Mr Meagles softly , as he gave a turn to the dumb-waiter on his right hand to twirl the sugar towards himself .
" I am not at all surprised to hear it . "
Quite wondering at this discovery , <NAME> gave a single knock .
If they HAD called themselves rich , most likely they wouldn ' t have been so. ' ' They lived and died very miserably .
It ' s my leg , it ' s my leg .
That , here he had a plan of action to recommend , with a conditional clause .
The place was intolerably dirty , and the smell of tobacco smoke perfectly suffocating .
I must settle this before I sleep .
He raised his voice and called ' Eugene !
It was a song that imitated the measure of beating upon iron , and was a mere lyrical excuse for the introduction of <NAME> 's respected name .
The door-keeper will pass the note to <NAME> , and do you make any gesture that will attract <NAME> 's attention , and show him where you stand .
I felt that , at the time. ' He drew his friend closer to him .
We traversed but one side of the square , however , and at the end of it she stopped , and put her candle down and opened a door .
' It was all right. ' Again I answered , ' Oh ! ' ' You know who was willin ' , ' said my friend .
Where do you think of going , <NAME> ? ' ' I shall go back to the factory , ' said <NAME> .
Not unless he gets out , I wo n't ! "
'Nor heard anything about him ? '
" Half after nine , sir , " repeats <NAME> .
<NAME> , of my present , before I touch upon my future .
He is my uncle , but he is a villain , and has done me wrong. ' ' Has he though ? ' asked <NAME> , bending eagerly forward .
The young gentleman uttered this exultant sound with mysterious significance .
Who told him not to come ?
<NAME> <NAME> begged her to take his arm ; and as they moved on very slowly , asked her how the robbery had been committed .
What could I do t ' hinder her ?
Have you seen that ? ' ' Ah !
But she is proud , is she not ? "
" But would you allow me the favour of a minute 's private conversation ? "
He 'd set upon a post at a street corner eight or ten hours at a stretch if he undertook to do it . "
I have no time to waste . "
I think it came on " for further directions " -- about some bill of costs , to the best of my understanding , which was confused enough .
She was very fond of me -- made me this waistcoat , Tom. " ' " Did she ? " said <NAME> .
No trees were to be seen , nor any vegetable growth save a poor brown scrubby moss , freezing in the chinks of rock .
" And then I said <NAME> was thinning fast ; and so it was , my dear . "
We made no more provision for growing older , than we did for growing younger .
Let ' s get the scaffolding up , then , for a pair of whiskers .
It is much better as it is ! ' Agnes is downstairs , when I go into the parlour ; and I give her the message .
What does he do that for ?
The look and the action had occupied but an instant .
'And us come to bring him all these beau-ti-ful things . '
Cries in exaltation of the well-known good physician rent the hall .
Here the friends , for a short time , separated .
It was not that he was embarrassed , as on that first night with the <NAME> family ; he was habitually unembarrassed now , and yet the something remained .
Sit down on this chair , close beside me !
Oh , no , I do n't think so !
'That 's just what it was ! '
' It ' s light enough for me , ' said Mr Merdle .
Why is it ? ' said <NAME> , ' Won ' t you tell me ? ' For <NAME> was shaking her head .
So we were left to take leave of one another without any restraint .
' My mother lives in a most primitive manner down in that dreary red-brick dungeon at <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
' That is the principal , I may say the only difficulty , my dear <NAME> , ' assented his wife .
I have had some slight correspondence with your former friend , sir , ' addressing me , ' but it has not restored his sense of duty or natural obligation .
If you have a suspicion in your own breast , keep that suspicion in your own breast .
He had undergone the ordinary transitions from the height of conviviality to the depth of misery , and from the depth of misery to the height of conviviality .
Your good opinion is a consolation to me .
The thunder was rolling into distance , and the rain was pouring down like a deluge , when the door of his room opened .
He has a great liking for Mrs. Rouncewell ; he says she is a most respectable , creditable woman .
She remonstrates , laughing , and is a childish schoolgirl again .
I am ashamed to have brought Mr Headstone with me .
<NAME> see to it yourself .
You can say I am coming . '
' If you only knew how I have loved that man -- ' <NAME> ' t distress yourself by recollecting it , ma ' am , ' said the bodyguard .
<NAME> <NAME> picked up his hat , and having turned it over with a look of interest and welcome , began to polish it on his sleeve .
' <NAME> , ' he said , ' I know , and knew before to-day , that I have found no favour with you ; and I knew why .
' I have been lingering here these two hours .
<NAME> <NAME> was fast asleep in bed , when his early visitor , followed by <NAME> , entered the room .
Such a thought never came into my head !
His visitor observed the look , and proceeded .
There were few buildings then , north of the Oxford-road , and forest-trees flourished , and wild flowers grew , and the hawthorn blossomed , in the now vanished fields .
Can be and shall be , on your own terms , ' returned my aunt , ' if you say the word .
The world did put it about , that she admired my style .
My lot has been so blest that I can relate little of myself which is not a story of goodness and generosity in others .
' My dear <NAME> , ' said Mr Morfin , after a silence , ' I was not prepared for this .
We proceeded by appointment straight to <NAME> ' s house ; where , and at <NAME> ' s , my friend had been labouring ever since our explosive meeting .
Oh , the strong eyes , and the weak frame !
' <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> ! ' ' <NAME> , him , him ? ' repeated <NAME> ; staring about , as if for Him .
<NAME> taught him even that much ; he found it out .
That ' s the worst of you .
and not my <NAME> gentleman ?
' He has feigned it often enough to me , of late , ' said <NAME> .
' You saucy baggage ! ' retorted <NAME> , rattling at the handle of the door .
<NAME> man of the name of <NAME> !
He had a tree on his right , a tree on his left , a third before him , and a fourth behind .
Through the ragged window-curtain , the light of early day steals in from a miserable court .
You 'd better bring the boy here to-morrow night .
I always knew the real worth of such characters as yours !
Call it at the outside a week .
' Very well , my dear Sir , very well , ' said <NAME> .
' I says , at first , " This is illusion " ; and was composing myself off to sleep , when I heerd the noise again , distinct . '
I ' d ha ' licked a doozen such as him when I was yoong as thee .
A bitter sleet came rattling against us here on the east wind , and <NAME> took me on his back .
But , ' she said , looking hastily round , 'this fear comes over me again .
" 'Gentlemen , ' I returned , ' I am that Doctor Manette of whom you speak so graciously . '
" I wish to hear it at the window , then .
But you never have condescended to me , as much as I could have wished .
Then will you set about it at once , blacksmith ? " said the off-hand sergeant , " as it 's on his <NAME> 's service .
It may be that I shall yet stand your friend , if you deserve it , and repent in action -- not in words .
She has found it necessary to make a journey -- I trust will shortly return .
It is not in tameness of spirit that I submit .
' <NAME> , We say , ' returned Mr Podsnap , in a condescending manner .
' A good , contented , well-breakfasted juryman is a capital thing to get hold of .
Where does that responsibility rest ?
I must put something under the cushion for your head .
He had another reason for this .
If you do , well and good .
But , there was nothing there .
Girded round its middle was an antique scabbard ; but no sword was in it , and the ancient sheath was eaten up with rust .
They listen , and hear his footsteps go back to the gate , and hear the gate close after him .
They were a goodly company , and the <NAME> all but worshipped them .
Firstly ( in a spirit of love ) , what is the common sort of <NAME> -- the working clothes -- the every-day wear , my young friends ?
The night should have turned more wet since I came in , for he had a large sou ' wester hat on , slouched over his face .
Why , good gracious me , suppose the house was to be let !
He is on his last march , miss , and has a whim to see her .
" But it 's not my business ! " he would generally say at those times , and would briskly fall to his sawing again .
Would n't her child ? " " Yes , yes , thank God .
" And you 're doing well , Mr .
The officer turned suddenly from the path , and after climbing a paling , and scaling a hedge , entered a secluded field .
There -- see how this iron bar bends beneath my furious wrench .
' I must move rapidly , or I could not draw my breath .
There was the usual aspect of newness on every object , of course .
But <NAME> was not there to look on ; and <NAME> remained unrecognised , and sat staring at her fire , unobserved .
Not a single word did <NAME> speak .
What could I become with these surroundings ?
' Kit , they call him. ' ' Kit , eh ! ' said <NAME> .
<NAME> ' t take on , ma ' am , and be sorry ! ' It became intolerable .
' I will not go in just yet , ' said <NAME> .
' My Wal ' r , as I used to call you !
You 've been in low spirits this afternoon .
' My dear , ' retorted <NAME> , in a low voice : ' <NAME> , all over ! ' ' In-deed ! ' said <NAME> .
They all dropped softly on the ground within the gate , and lay there a little -- listening perhaps .
This sounded so like a falsehood , that the old gentleman looked somewhat sternly in <NAME> 's face .
At length , quite unexpectedly , he said something in a whisper .
' He ' s no more a monster than you are , ' returned <NAME> .
He wished to do anything as laid in his power to serve <NAME> , altogether putting himself out of sight ; and he hoped he did .
But I come up with ' em , and I crossed ' em .
What alone was wanting to the realization of a vast fortune , he considered to be More Capital .
Devil a word , gentlemen , the chair would say .
The sun was low -- near setting -- and its light came redly in above , without descending to the ground .
' Ah ! ' said the dwarf , smacking his lips , ' what a nice kiss that was -- just upon the rosy part .
She was in a state of lawful innocence , so to speak .
And at last he flung out in his violent way , and said , with a D , 'Then do as you like . '
Now , take a rest , and then we ' ll talk again .
Of my darling being almost smothered among the flowers , and coming out , laughing and crying both together , to my jealous arms .
The house in the city preserved its heavy dulness through all these transactions , and the invalid within it turned the same unvarying round of life .
' And whatever you do with your ink , I can ' t think , for you ' re as clean as a whistle after it .
He 'd find himself growing thin , if he did n't look sharp ! "
' More than that , you say , do you ? ' cried the other , pushing back his battered hat , and drawing his hand across his forehead .
They were not interchanging a word or a look .
Are you -- are you very poor ? ' ' I am but a wanderer , ' said <NAME> , ' making voyages to live , across the sea .
It was torturing to me to hear them talk of occurrences in which I had had no share .
Look at your boy : he _is_ your ' n , ai n't he ?
' Do you give lessons , ma ' am ? ' inquired <NAME> .
We shall never understand each other. " " Such a mean brute , such a stupid brute ! " I urged , in despair .
Mr <NAME> did not increase in favour with the Father of the <NAME> in the ratio of his increasing visits .
There were no other passengers that night , but we four .
With all her deference for <NAME> as contradistinguished from his portrait , Mrs. <NAME> had not the smallest intention of interrupting the descent .
' Now , you know. ' ' Yes , <NAME> , ' said Mr Boffin , meekly .
Something or somebody had superseded him as a source of interest .
' <NAME> ' t wait , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
He was very fond of pickled walnuts , gentlemen .
<NAME> : But you think that their abolition would damage a class of practitioners ?
His wristbands and collar were oppressive ; his voice and manner were oppressive .
There ' ll be beer to feth .
' How do you know I am old ?
When you are left alone here with <NAME> -- ' ' I am to be left alone here with <NAME> ? ' said <NAME> , quietly .
I believe I state your views correctly ; do I not , my dear Sir ? ' said the little man , turning to <NAME> .
I answered , most assuredly he did not .
Opening the door with all speed , he beheld the expressive countenance of Mr Chuckster , between whom and himself a fraternal greeting ensued .
His friends might advise him , you know ; now he is free .
Mr <NAME> was thus amiably engaged when a step was heard at the outer door , and the door was heard to open hastily .
I think of seeing her happy , and with friends about her , and brought up as she deserves , and as she ought to be .
As she stood behind him , leaning over his chair so lovingly , he looked with downcast eyes at the fire .
" Devil doubt him , " says <NAME> .
I hate your virtuous people ! ' said the dwarf , throwing off a bumper of brandy , and smacking his lips , ' ah !
' Come , ' retorted <NAME> , ' let ' s have no more of this !
He consumed it in putting his hand to his forehead and taking it away again , and in backing his chair into the corner behind him .
Those things would be the watch and shirt-pin .
Give her the letter , make her take the letter , put it in her pocket by violence .
' The prospect of an addition to your family ? ' ' The seventh addition , <NAME> , ' returned <NAME> , solemnly .
My fault is , that I have been true to you .
She held it up as if she were a beautiful <NAME> , looking on him , face to face , to strike him dead .
But we took a moonlight walk last Monday night , to talk it over at leisure , and I represented the case to him as it really is .
What is there you can not do , if you will ! ' ' Thank you , ' said <NAME> , ' you ' re very complimentary to say so .
" Your head is cool ? " he said , touching it .
Perhaps this is the reason why it is an article of faith with the servants , handed down from race to race , that the departed <NAME> was a hairdresser .
I could repeat this in my mind too , but I had not the least idea what it meant .
'As weak as water , ' replied <NAME> , with an imprecation on his eyes and limbs .
' Confound his impudence ! ' muttered <NAME> , rapping the stair-rail impatiently with his cane .
Then she ran to the old man , who folded her in his arms and bade God bless her .
It had been one of the first novelties and pleasures of his freedom , and was equally the delight of his wife .
" Are you a married man , sir ? "
The young woman seemed surprised at his appearance , and asked him where his mother was .
But bring him here , upon this crowded deck .
Soaking into this filthy ground as you lie here , is your own shape .
' Coach is ready , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , appearing at the door .
With which he hurried out of the room , down the stairs , up the coachsteps , and into the coach , without another word .
He held out his hand , which <NAME> clasped tight in hers .
Among them was a beautiful girl of twenty , who had been there nearly three years .
The man was not unnaturally cruel or hard-hearted .
' Will you try to teach me , <NAME> ? ' ' I must teach myself first , <NAME> , ' said I .
'Stupid enough , this , ' muttered the doctor to himself ; 'the boy must have made a mistake .
That 's the kind of man <NAME> is ! "
She put out her hand—a pretty little soft hand ; and her fingers closed upon her brother ' s , as if she would have carried them to her lips .
Our mother died there , when we were little children .
' Shovel and all ! ' said <NAME> .
That ' s the way it works .
And I have so many old parchmentses and papers in my stock .
' Look at his hang-dog air , ' said <NAME> , following .
My guardian lay at the <NAME> in the next room to mine .
Such a heart <NAME> carried under her rough robe .
" Faithful dear boy , well done .
Astonished for the moment , <NAME> fell back a couple of paces and surveyed him from head to foot .
" I do n't know who may not , if you may not . "
But of course I can ' t answer for the consequences .
" By heaven , he is the proudest fellow breathing .
That there was no hope of escape from it , unless the escape was my own act , I knew quite well .
' Bless the precious boy ! ' cried <NAME> , taking hold of me .
I have wronged her enough in fact ; I have wronged her still more in intention .
From <NAME> she looked at me , with a searching glance that seemed to pry into my heart and probe its wounds .
There was nothing revealed by the many eyes that looked at him but watchfulness and eagerness ; there was no visible menacing or anger .
You know what I mean .
" Not so easily as you think .
Let us love each other , <NAME> ! ' said <NAME> , fondling his shaggy head .
' And how do you think we are looking , <NAME> , -- I should say , <NAME> ? ' fawned <NAME> .
We ca n't take THAT in a court of justice , gentlemen .
<NAME> was quite at home here , in right of <NAME> , not to mention the <NAME> and <NAME> , and kept them in view with ease .
' They know what they ' re about , if ever people did , ' murmured <NAME> , drawing in her breath ' oh !
This , too , delighted <NAME> .
The amazement , suspicion , resentment , and shame , with which <NAME> looked on at all this , struck him dumb .
" Not enough , " says the trooper , shaking his head .
No wonder. ' ' No wonder , ' repeated <NAME> .
I was sent for , and the case was entrusted to me .
' What ' s come to you , <NAME> ?
I shouldn ' t have had the heart to put on gentleman ' s clothes .
<NAME> Grewgious being of opinion that she could not do better , she withdrew for the purpose .
Or so -- like a fried fish .
Finally , the worthy couple went away arm in arm .
' At what time will it be ready ? ' asked Mr Codlin faintly .
' I ' ll take down the heads if you please , sir .
'All that I could hope to do , and even more .
' A natural ambition enough , ' said <NAME> , coolly .
' It is truly painful to contemplate mankind in such an aspect , <NAME> , but our reception was , decidedly , cool .
This reply is cut short by <NAME> 's arrival .
Where are they all ! ' ' Whom do you speak of ? ' inquired <NAME> , wishing to rouse the poor half-witted creature to reason .
The breakfast was interrupted by very little conversation ; even <NAME> felt the influence of the weather , and the previous day ' s excitement .
When this same <NAME> was mentioned , <NAME> stopped me and herself , and stood looking at the speaker .
The wind , too , which was directly against them , swept in furious gusts down the narrow road , and howled dismally through the trees which skirted the pathway .
' The attorney bowed obsequiously , and glanced at a large packet which the gentleman carried in his hand .
' Good-morning , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
' See what , my dear <NAME> ? ' said my mother ; ' where ? ' ' He ' s got it ! ' cried <NAME> .
Shocking thing that , Tom. " ' " Dreadful ! " said <NAME> .
There are funds in hand at present .
My works don ' t all moulder away , and rot in the earth .
' I hadn ' t a shoe to my foot .
Another morning arrived , and she came alone .
' Let us be beggars , and be happy. ' ' Beggars -- and happy ! ' said the old man .
My guardian looked at us again , plainly saying , " You hear him ? "
They seem to come natural to me. ' ' Mr .
' Am I right , again ? ' inquired the <NAME> in a whisper , with the scarlet circle on his forehead swelling in his triumphant joy .
' I take quite a lively interest in you , my dear soul , upon my word , ' said <NAME> ; ' a sister ' s interest , actually .
Now , madam , I am troubled by noticing that <NAME> is not , so to speak , one of ourselves .
' What are you a-laughin ' at , corpilence ? ' ' <NAME> !
' I have been a good deal flurried , ' replied Mrs. Raddle , in a reproachful manner .
' I suppose there ' s nothing to prevent your going in for it ? ' said Mr Boffin .
<NAME> made in every direction .
<NAME> <NAME> is not in the library , but she repairs to the library .
Notwithstanding the lapse of time that had occurred since <NAME> ' s decease , she still wore weeds .
Among those few there may be one who loves you even as dearly , though he has not loved you as long , as I .
Shall I ever forget the manner in which those handsome proud eyes seemed to spring out of their languor and to hold mine !
why , she was always coming backwards and forwards .
" It is worthy of remark , " says <NAME> , " however , that these people are , in their way , very proud . "
I know nothing about seven and sixpence .
I see , I see. ' There was silence between them .
" Grandmother , " says the young man , changing the subject , " what a very pretty girl that was I found with you just now .
<NAME> is true to me .
The old chap gave <NAME> a look with his open eyes , as much as to say , " Is your name <NAME> ?
Yesterday ? ' ' This here blessed day , my lady lass , ' replied the <NAME> .
He knew these men , also , perfectly .
Does he ever think of his daughter , or wonder where she is gone ?
' I can ' t at all times keep out of my mind , mistrustings of some one .
" That is a more alarming person than the clerk .
By the moonlight , <NAME> can be seen in profile , perfectly still .
'The place should be somewhere here , ' said <NAME> , consulting a scrap of paper he held in his hand .
Agnes could care for no other. ' My aunt sat musing for a little while , with her chin upon her hand .
Upon his sacred word of honour , there was no cause of alarm .
Mr and <NAME> had found their search a difficult one .
" It 's all squared , you see , as I squared it myself , sir .
' <NAME> and snappish we are !
' I prefer being alone , ' replied the single gentleman .
So , she once more died away , and nobody minded her .
The prisoners were far from insensible or unfeeling ; their ways arose out of the condition of the time .
Here <NAME> 's mother fell into an extraordinary passion of rolling her head and smiling waggishly at anybody who would look at her .
That would obviously be inconvenient and unpleasant to the customers , besides entailing on the <NAME> Whatever-it-was , the risk of funeral expenses .
But I should not have been surprised , brother , if you had considered it anything but welcome news to hear of me . "
" Why , my angel , " returns <NAME> , " we shall see . "
' Ye ' ve smoked as many as five since ye come in at midnight , ' the woman goes on , as she chronically complains .
I thought perhaps you might have come in a cab. ' ' No , Mr Wegg , ' replies <NAME> .
While we were talking , he more than once called me <NAME> ; which brought <NAME> out again .
There you have the man !
And here I fell asleep .
Neighbours were as kind as they were wont to be of old , but she shunned their greetings with averted head .
'What do you mean by ca n't be ?
" Because , " said I , " <NAME> and <NAME> have fallen in love .
After a little more consideration and some backing and changing of the foot on which he rests , he mutters that he is " wery thankful . "
And <NAME> went about his daily pursuits .
' Look here , you sir , ' said <NAME> .
<NAME> had come down to the hall too , but did not advance : reserving her timid welcome until these nearer and dearer transports should subside .
The girl lingered a little while to talk , and tell her grievances .
' He ' s a very good fellow if you know how to manage him .
Before it could be given him , he would be gone again .
There was nothing particularly choice there , to be sure ; but I took the will for the deed , and felt that they were very attentive .
' Well , I ' m sure ! ' exclaimed <NAME> .
And you ? ' Mr <NAME> said in a low growl , ' Oh !
When the other three , who follow closely , take their seats , his face is hidden for the first time -- shaded by his cloak .
I looked at both of them .

Introduce him to me , and I 'll cultivate his acquaintance .
' <NAME> ' ever , ' said he , ' this isn ' t entertaining to <NAME> .
Mr Tite Barnacle never would have passed for half his current value , unless his coat had been always buttoned-up to his white cravat .

' <NAME> ' like it , ' replied his father .
' Here we are , ' said <NAME> .
And I looked so , I have no doubt .
" Do n't you think you can receive his evidence , sir ? "

' In fine , then , I name it the history of this house .
I should think it was a very pleasant life , the married one , eh ? ' ' I have not the least doubt of it , ' rejoined <NAME> .
" It was a rash one , " said she .
Not a man knows it better .
He fixed his eyes on Mary , and replied -- ' I knows a nicerer. ' ' Indeed ! ' said <NAME> .
Yes ; but you would never have thought of it , for all that , if I hadn ' t said so , ' replied his wife .
Dear me , <NAME> , that ' s sharp practice !
These are melancholy sounds to a quiet listener at any time ; but how melancholy to the watcher by the bed of death !

The old lady can do nothing but go in search of him .
And now I come to a part of my story touching myself very nearly indeed , and for which I was quite unprepared when the circumstance occurred .
How few of those who stiffened in her father ' s freezing atmosphere , suspected what a heap of fiery coals was piled upon his head !
It bent its head low again , and said not a word .
It were yesterday afternoon " ( with an appearance of mingled wisdom , relief , and strict impartiality ) .

<NAME> <NAME> -- <NAME> too , coupled with a <NAME> ' s Head : picturing to us by a double association of ideas , something stern and rugged !
<NAME> and dear little Twoshoes !
I may claim the merit of having originated the suggestion that the will should be looked for in the box .
' What ' s become of him ? ' asked my aunt .
You have a face to be remembered , and I remember faces well .
" Where was this coach , in the name of gracious ? " asked my sister .
' Like the startled fawn , ' said <NAME> .
' What ' s the matter ? ' he asked in plain <NAME> .
I gained the door , dropped over the banisters , and in an instant was in the street .
There is no such thing as such fulfilment on this earth .
But we don ' t live under leaves , and keep cows and sheep and creatures .
If not , by your own thoughts and suspicions. ' ' I have no suspicions , ' said the Manager .
' <NAME> , when you have found out concerning his coming home , come round to the window of <NAME> , tap twice at it , and wait for me .
It is the hottest long vacation known for many years .
' A tragedy. ' <NAME> seemed much relieved .
Throughout the remainder of the day , Mr <NAME> ' s What were they up to ?
Is that your fidelity to me ?
I am inclined to believe , from my uncertainty on this head , that it was six at first and seven afterwards .
I wasn ' t here myself above seven year before you .
Who made me " a fellow like this " ?
It would have been next to impossible to suspect him of anything wrong , he was so thoroughly respectable .
But even in this chamber there was a rocking-chair .
I thank you even more for the tone of the question .
On the last Sunday , they invited me to dinner ; and we had a loin of pork and apple sauce , and a pudding .
A fair girl with rich brown hair hanging free in natural ringlets .
You will allow me to order you lunch after your journey , sir . "

' Once make a giant common and giants will never draw again .

If not yesterday , why then today .
<NAME> came out of the hot mill into the damp wind and cold wet streets , haggard and worn .
<NAME> up the place , turn out directly , and send me the key by bearer .

Her eyes were closing , but they opened again .
I say , my dear Loo !
" <NAME> , surely ! " said <NAME> , who had left her in exactly the same attitude some seventeen years ago .
I acknowledge that I like it , dear boy , but I am not worth it .
He nodded when I said the subject was painful to me , clapped me on the back , put round the wine again , and went on with his dinner .
Their walk was the walk of a race apart .
'What has become of him !
' Ay ! ' exclaimed the Manager , ' what ' s that ?
it wasn ' t for him to betray his trust , was it ?
I may say that I do too , and always did .
After some quarter of an hour ' s absence , he returned .
' I never , never will , sir , ' interposed <NAME> .
The galley was kept steady , and the silent , eager look-out at the water was resumed .
Here he was searched ; and nothing being found upon him , locked up .
You are to understand , first , that it is the request of the person from whom I take my instructions that you always bear the name of <NAME> .
The grim sly faces in the squares and diamonds of the floor-cloth , relaxed and peeped out at him with less wicked eyes .
" Nod it ; that 's what I want to see you do .
The night was dark , and a cold wind blew , driving the clouds , furiously and fast , before it .
' The room was kept like this , <NAME> , ' said Mr Boffin , ' against the son ' s return .
But there was other trouble .
It was all gone now .
' " I have wronged you , " shrieked the old man , falling on his knees , and clasping his hands together .
' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> to his sister , ' any harsh words between us are , I hope , uncommon .
The boy shouted ; four birds flew out .
He came to take leave of us ; he had settled to do so beforehand .
' <NAME> , the process had been mechanical , and the success about as great as teaching a very knowing dog a variety of tricks .
'That man must be delivered up by you , ' said the gentleman .
Here IS the young man ! "
Next comes what you mean to say .
Has that fellow ' -- to the man with the wooden leg -- ' been here again ? ' ' <NAME> , ' was the answer .
'Make a bow to the gentleman , <NAME> , ' said Mrs. Mann .
Its legs and feet , most delicately formed , were , like those upper members , bare .
I go back at eight o ' clock tomorrow morning , and have got only three -- three oughts is an ought -- three twos is six -- sixty pound .
It 's the fashionable way ; and fashion and whiskers have been my weaknesses , and I do n't care who knows it , " says <NAME> .
Then she would take up another pen , and begin to write , and find that it spluttered .
" I am very grateful for all your kindness and consideration regarding our marriage , and so , I can assure you , is <NAME> . "
The appearance of everything on the lines denoted that the approaching ceremony was one of the utmost grandeur and importance .
' Is this all ? ' demanded the person of the house , when a confused heap of pence and shillings lay on the table .
If she should ever tell me that you are essential to her perfect happiness , I will give her to you .
Now I ask you fair .
My passion for her is beyond all bounds .
He was a true <NAME> , and hoped there were many like him .
" Never have -- " " Not <NAME> , <NAME> ? "
<NAME> coals to be relied upon ?
It was quite dark when he was awakened by a push from <NAME> .
The offer relieved him from considerable embarrassment , for his previous notions of loading a pistol were rather vague and undefined .
Say you know me , and I am sure they will not charge you for it .
' Not a bit of it , ' replied <NAME> ; ' only cheerful. ' ' Cheerful , sir ! ' ejaculated <NAME> .
' I should like , ' he said , 'to call in the aid of my friend <NAME> .
It is one <NAME> , it appears .
It was a very low fire indeed ; nothing on such a bitter night .
But I may be wrong. ' ' No , you are not wrong , ' said <NAME> , shaking her head .
' I come to know , ma ' am , whether he will keep his wured ? ' ' No , ' she returned .
At that time it was customary to carry <NAME> down to the dock-yards by stage-coach .
This chafing over , the ornamental part of <NAME> 's toilet is soon performed .
Can you lay your hand upon your heart and say that you are worthy of so hysterical a daughter ?
' Is <NAME> in ? ' faltered <NAME> .
No , " returned the stranger , " but once and away , and on a Saturday night too .
" <NAME> , " replies the other , " I am in the downs .
' You have got the address ? ' ' <NAME> , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , consulting his pocket- book .
' It was very thoughtful to mention it. ' ' Can I -- or <NAME> -- do anything ? ' asked <NAME> , gently .
Stopped speaking only ; her hand was still in motion .
I found him out , all in a flash as I may say , one night .
<NAME> <NAME> shortly afterwards took himself off , to prepare for his journey .
Of course , I understand THAT , my love , without your telling me ; and I said the same to <NAME> , and I AM very much pleased .
A lane of small boys beyond me , with the same interest in his eye , watch it too .
Soon afterwards the day began to dawn , and he softly detached himself from the clasping hand , and cautiously looked out again .
Do you know what my great grandfather ' s name was ? ' ' No , ' said <NAME> .
It was very possible that Mr <NAME> had not yet left the office .
" You have been a soldier , " observes <NAME> , " and a faithful one . "
I am sure you will respect it .
'Even if it had been the right place , and the right fellows had been there , what could I have done , single-handed ?
And as to being regarded in lights , there ' s bumpey lights as well as bony .
pursues <NAME> , pinching <NAME> 's cheeks .
Do you know him , Mr .
' I got it out of him , ' said <NAME> , with a stammer .
The fact is that <NAME> -- most extraordinary woman , Johnson. ' Here he broke off and whispered something in his ear .
Tom-all-Alone 's My <NAME> is restless , very restless .
' So should I , ' said <NAME> , speaking for the first time .
There ' s his full-length portrait , painted by himself and presented to you , warranted a likeness !
Ring merrily for births that make expectants writhe , and marriages that are made in hell , and toll ruefully for the dead whose shoes are worn already !
It could not be doubted that this was the truth .
<NAME> , all the world , to this creature of <NAME> !
' I AM miserable , ' returned <NAME> , evidently pouting .
If you had ever seen her sister , you would know her to have been as resolute and haughty as she . "
I did not understand it .
Having with a grave face touched the wounds upon the head , and the broken arms , he took the hand .
It and I have worn away together .
<NAME> single gentlemen pass and repass -- but there is no invitation for to inquire within or without .
' This is a device to keep him out of the way , ' said Mrs. Sparsit , starting from the dull office window whence she had watched him last .
I held his hand for a little while in mine .
They shone in every part of the dance like moons .
It is the <NAME> of <NAME> to him .
They were discussing this question , and were almost building up some weak structure of hope on his prolonged absence , when they heard him on the stairs .
' First of all , I ' m a-going to call you <NAME> , for short , ' said <NAME> .
In that one moment , every shadow of doubt or agitation passed away from <NAME> ' s soul .
Seated round the table were four or five boys , none older than the <NAME> , smoking long clay pipes , and drinking spirits with the air of middle-aged men .
The sensation is heightened as the tidings spread from mouth to mouth that the beadle is on the ground and has gone in .
There seemed to be no hope for him .
These all crowded about their associate as he whispered a few words to the <NAME> ; and then turned round and grinned at <NAME> .
I say I did not resent it , nor did I ; but I showed her , by not gratifying her , that I understood her .
But that was not to be thought of now , when they sat in the state-equipage with <NAME> on the coach-box .
I can ' t work you into a miscellaneous one , no how .
This is the garden of <NAME> 's <NAME> .
They both know what they want and mean to do .
And then , ' Fetch his daughter. ' On both of which errands , quick messengers depart .
It blows over the -- ha -- Surrey hills .
The matter being settled thus , little <NAME> began to cry most piteously , as if he had a foreboding that no good would come of it .
Then she would open it at the place where <NAME> had made it illegible last night , and call <NAME> up , to look at his misdeeds .
But , his long-cherished desire to know more about these matters , not only stopped him in his running away , but lured him back again .
He had half a mind to draw a line or two upon the board , and show himself what he meant .
Can dance , and play music , and sing ?
I know what it is , ' replied the friend .
We shook hands in a very cordial way ; and I laughed and laughed , until I pulled out my pocket-handkerchief and wiped my eyes .
it was but wishing that all he held against her in his hand might be flung to the winds and chance-sown in many places .
He has no respect for <NAME> .
It was Saturday , and he had gone to <NAME> .
But wot ' s the good of saying that to you !
But hold me the while , and stay with me afterwards. ' ' My child !
He wears his usual expressionless mask -- if it be a mask -- and carries family secrets in every limb of his body and every crease of his dress .
Who was it who , unaided by his love , regard or notice , thrived and grew beautiful when those so aided died ?
Something must be done with <NAME> too , who at present is -- ha -- barely respectable , barely respectable .
On one chair-back hang the old man 's hairy cap and coat .
" Naturally there was no end to his tongue then .
Not that I complain , ' he added , in his lively , animated , energetic way .
It is you I come to see. ' ' Me ? ' replied a soft voice .
Nor does it become less prepossessing on a closer acquaintance .
' He always prints , I know , ' cos he learnt writin ' from the large bills in the booking-offices .
' I thought so ! ' said he .
There were holidays at school on other birthdays -- none on mine .
There were some boats and barges astrand in the mud , and these enabled us to come within a few yards of her without being seen .
' From whom you are to exact the intelligence that is to be useful to me ? ' ' Yes , ' said the old woman , nodding again .
There was an execution put into our house , for rent .
cried the voice of the girl whom he had followed .
" It 's eleven o'clock striking by the bell of <NAME> 's .
It was of little moment , indeed , whether they were intelligible or no ; for there was nobody to care for them , had they been ever so plain .
He was a very hard man , and her mother had long been dead .
" <NAME> ! " " I will faithfully , " replied the man , " if you will come with me .
But , dear guardian , you are late too , and look weary .
' <NAME> ' t you think that , ' I asked the coachman , in the first stage out of <NAME> , ' a very remarkable sky ?
Not of the family in the present times only , but in the past times too .
' It ' s getting on towards our dinner time you know , ' said <NAME> .
' It ' s so stupid at home , ' she replied , ' and <NAME> is so absurd !
' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' I don ' t think you ' re well .
The officer crossed to <NAME> , and <NAME> went up to <NAME> .
<NAME> was within arm ' s length of <NAME> , when he took such deadly aim at him , that he never spoke .
He wants that <NAME> man. ' ' With whom I saw you in the <NAME> in <NAME> , ' hinted <NAME> .
His appearance and manner ; are they so honest ? ' ' Very honest. ' ' And her confidence not to be shaken !
" Well , sir , I suppose it is .
Then the going on again -- so fresh at first , and shortly afterwards so sleepy .
There is a press in the room , but its hinges have not creaked , nor has a step been audible upon the floor .
I was mentioning your perception of my weaknesses .
Now , you ' re aware -- are you -- that you ' re in possession of property to which you ' ve no right at all ?
<NAME> very well understood that this was held out as an additional inducement to her to preserve the strictest silence regarding the events of the preceding night .
There was something in that third-person style of being spoken to , that <NAME> found particularly recognisant of his merits and position .
She hurried off , and presently we passed her hushing and singing to her child at her own door and looking anxiously along the road for her drunken husband .
Has the picture been engraved , miss ? "
' You have heard it all , and you ' ll not forget it .
Observing that the hand was pointed to them , <NAME> advanced to listen to their talk .
<NAME> trees grew in corners of the cellars .
<NAME> gracious goodness heavins , I 've found him ! '
I omitted to ask the question , but I should think it must have been of about half a pony power .
Bless his heart ; it 's <NAME> alive again ! "
After all the trouble that has been taken with you !
<NAME> raised him so that she could hold him on her bosom , which was what he wanted .
She does not immediately enter , when they have parted , but remains looking after him along the street .
The family name depends wery much upon you , <NAME> , and I hope you ' ll do wot ' s right by it .
' It is short , no doubt , my dear .
You can ' t say more to me than I say to myself .
' It was her father that I got acquainted with first .
I ask you who done it and how you know it .
It was in vain that I asked her for her family name .
asked the sleepy <NAME> , shaking himself pettishly .
' And all friends round <NAME> ' s. ' He emptied and put down the wine-glass half-way through this ancient civic toast , and took up the box .
And <NAME> went home to brood upon it , and to meditate upon the charms of the unknown young lady , now as far beyond his reach as ever .
There is nothing in her manner to express weakness or excite compassion .
They made me laugh again by laughing at each other , and then we all three laughed until I was in danger of crying again .
However , the only thing to be done being to knock at the door , I knocked , and was told from within to enter .
' Come in , come in ! ' said <NAME> .
I have been in this trouble , and that trouble , and shall be again .
We shall know full soon .
That he was a suspicious , crabbed , cranky , used-up , J .
The streets are well paved , and lighted with gas ; the houses are large and good ; the shops excellent .
The breakfast languishes when that is done , the violated hatchments are avenged , and <NAME> rises to assume her travelling dress .
what strange things you fancy ! ' ' It wasn ' t fancy , <NAME> , my dear , I ' m certain of that , ' returned her mother .
Then I made an excuse to go in with my housekeeping keys , shutting the door after me .
I am going to <NAME> , having friends there .
When all this had been done several times , the <NAME> shook his head and seemed to think the matter had a bad look .
<NAME> , he observes that she has journeyed a long distance and is footsore and travel-stained .
<NAME> <NAME> saw losing cards in it that <NAME> knew nothing of .
These are the <NAME> 's impressions , my dear , all over <NAME> -- the children know them ! "
<NAME> ; he irritated it , with a kind of perverse pleasure akin to that which a sick man sometimes has in irritating a wound upon his body .
' That was the treatment , you see .
Is it really , though ? ' I replied that I liked it well enough , but that I certainly could not claim so much for it .
The back is <NAME> 's bedroom , and in it she 's a-carrying on , poor thing , to a frightful extent ! "
If it were my brother who had committed it , I would not spare him . "
And if you ain ' t the gentleman I took you for , may be my mind has call to be uneasy .
inquired the lawyer in a low voice .
It ain ' t much to boast of , genteel as his own is .
" My dear <NAME> , " said he , shaking his head pleasantly , " I do n't know .
There ' s not such a spring in <NAME> as the pump under the archway .
'Look how he stares , <NAME> !
This was not lost on the speaker .
Besides , they know where to find you , and I represent you .
<NAME> <NAME> kept his eyes fixed on his visitor during its narration , and directly it was concluded , took the word again .
So he remains for a minute or two , heaped up against it , and then staggers down the shop to the front door .
There was <NAME> , deceased ; there was <NAME> , deceased ; and there was Jo , deceased ; and they were " all in it . "
It wants constant attention in the littlest things .
that ' s not enough ! ' she cried .
One Christmas time , when yonder solitary child was left here all alone , he did come , for the first time , just like that .
I was just giving you up , sir , and going home . "
I often walked past it afterwards , and never for a long time without thinking of him and half expecting to meet him .
" I communicate to him that secret .
she asked , after they had walked a few hundred yards .
I have fear of this man .
' Come ! ' cried the subject of this admiration , returning .
' This is indeed an unexpected pleasure !
He ' d be sharper than a serpent ' s tooth , if he wasn ' t as dull as ditch water .
' Well , sir , ' said <NAME> , with the profound solemnity with which that great man could , when he pleased , render his remarks so deeply impressive .
What have I been and done ?
<NAME> proceeds to tell him all he knows about Jo , unto which the trooper listens with a grave face .
Did I not , <NAME> ? ' ' Well , never mind that now , ' said the boy .
I was so curious to know , that I made up my mind to have it out with <NAME> .
" He is changed , " he returned , shaking his head .
' Much better too , I hope ? ' <NAME> turned his eyes towards <NAME> , as if to spare her , and answered nothing .
" You ought to do it of yourself , " <NAME> answers ; " I know that very well , Mrs. Bagnet .
<NAME> educates ' em. ' ' The second daughter , perhaps ? ' I hazarded .
It ain ' t -- ain ' t catching. ' <NAME> murmured that she had something to do in her own room , and went away upstairs .
" Yet would you believe that it 's HIS name on the door-plate ? "
It is a way he has sometimes .
I was jealous of everybody .
I am old in years , and older still in misery and care .
Thus , the flush of the day , in its heat and light , would gradually decline ; and again the golden water would be dancing on the wall .
It is quite a bower in the summer-time .
They were clean and new , and I spread them out and handed them over to him .
' It looks as if the old man ' s spirit had found rest at last ; don ' t it ? ' said <NAME> .
' Only you ! ' cried the dwarf , stretching his neck to obtain a better view of his visitor .
His daughter , turning the bracelet on her arm , and now looking at him , and now looking from him , said , ' Very well , papa .
Moreover , I have done no wrong , and have injured no man .
I know it does. ' Of <NAME> and <NAME> .
Now what are you going to do ?
I doubt if she could have been induced to desert her post , by anyone else .
'My name is <NAME> , sir , ' replied the little invalid : with a look of great astonishment .
What should I ever do without you ! ' ' Me leave you , my precious ! ' cried <NAME> .
I should forget how to wear a whole coat now .
' First , he wants some water , ' said he , looking round .
The spy had kept his eyes open , but had been able to detect no sign .
' I 'll eat my head , sir , ' repeated <NAME> , striking his stick upon the ground .
This gentleman , ' said <NAME> , pointing out the apple-faced man , ' is the father .
' Who says so ? ' cried <NAME> , rising from his knee and confronting them , but still retaining <NAME> ' s lifeless hand in his .
This was frequently their theme of conversation .
I ' ve had my dinner. ' ' You dine early , sir , ' said the powdered-headed footman .
<NAME> said what anything was , but everybody said what the Mrs Generals , Mr Eustace , or somebody else said it was .
He knew me better than I knew myself .
" I am very glad to go there , sir , " I answered .
" My time is nearly gone . "
I was a nuisance , an incumbrance , and a pest .
It was a perfectly decent room , half parlour and half kitchen , but not at all a snug room .
' I was quite at your disposition .
" Even if I have grown so much wiser , what then ?
' Is anybody else a-goin ' , <NAME> ? ' said Mrs. Cluppins , arranging her pelerine .
You don ' t know how wet and cold I am , or how many times I have lost my way in coming here through this thick fog .
' You are very good , ' said <NAME> .
Then only was he permitted to be seen , spectacularly poring over large books , and casting his breeches and gaiters into the general weight of the establishment .
These two causes made him answer in a very low and hesitating voice ; whereupon a gentleman in a white waistcoat said he was a fool .
there are times when ignorance is bliss indeed .
' You have done a stealthy and unbecoming action , <NAME> .
' Why do you bring your prolifigate companions here ?
' What on earth has anybody to do with the -- with the -- Bones of my son ?
I seem , then , to be worthier of the eldest Miss Larkins .
by <NAME> , it ' s quite Minervian. ' ' It ' ll look well enough when it comes to be finished , ' observed Mrs Jarley .
As to whether your name is <NAME> , or <NAME> ? " The official turned towards him with sudden distrust .
' He never loved me ; he never loved <NAME> , who is next door but one to a cherubim .
<NAME> guineas , tea and sugar , and servants allowed to see male cousins , if godly .
" Well ? " cried my sister , addressing us both at once .
' I will remain here to light you up the stairs .
Perhaps , to observe whether he had any spectre on his conscience .
Then the curtain moved more perceptibly , and the woman in the bed put it back , and sat up .
Over this bib her dimples looked delightful , and under it her pretty figure not less so .
And of course I should. ' The subject of their dispute , who had seated himself , laughed aloud , and rapped his legs with his hand .
You went down to the river together ? ' ' Undoubtedly .
Not caring what she thought of you ( and <NAME> knows <NAME> was of no consequence ! )
' How much have we in hand ? ' ' Very little indeed , ' replied <NAME> .
' Then it was their own fault , ' said Mr Podsnap .
I can not bear ' t nommore .
' I can ' t speak to you just now , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
<NAME> all your pockets inside out , and leave ' em so ! ' cried the person of the house .
It added in a postscript that I would not be many hours from <NAME> .
To see how she operated upon him with a pen-knife !
' You don ' t say more than the truth when you say that , ' replied Squeers .
I know perfectly well why you have been taking such an interest in this Mrs Gowan .
The bed had not been lain on , but was smooth and empty .
I will engage that you shall be , and even that young Drood shall make the first advance .
' <NAME> to your names , gentlemen , that you may be sworn , ' said the gentleman in black .
'It was the <NAME> , I tell you .
' _Can _you ! ' repeated <NAME> , with a smile of pity .
" But I may ask you a question , <NAME> ? "
Here I sit at the desk again , on a drowsy summer afternoon .
He was well dressed , of a sprightly and gay appearance , a well-knit figure , and a rich dark complexion .
When not doing so himself , he may have some informant skulking about , in the person of a watchman , porter , or such-like hanger-on of <NAME> .
' Of course he proposed it , but how did it all come about ?
I do n't know nothink about nothink at all . "
I think an inn is a good sort of a place to propose to a single woman in , <NAME> .
' And very good ones too , I believe , haven ' t they ? ' asked the married lady .
Speaking of daughters , I have seen <NAME> Dombey. ' There was a sudden rush of blood to Mr <NAME> ' s face .
Is it <NAME> , <NAME> ? ' ' Well ; yes it is. ' ' Yes !
<NAME> little presents to Mrs. Nickleby , always of the very things they most required , tended in no slight degree to the improvement and embellishment of the cottage .
" Did you think of walking down to Walworth ? " said he .
Can you make a honourable lady of her ? "
' Yes. ' ' O , I could never go there any more .
He put it aside by merely repeating that he had a high regard for Mr Doyce .
On the whole , I would recommend you to take to <NAME> ' Commons kindly , <NAME> .
We have lived plainly enough here , <NAME> and I .
Up one minute and down the next ; now in spirits and now in despondency ! " " Ah ! " returned the other , sighing : " yes !
It was a little idea of mine .
" You are impanelled here to inquire into the death of a certain man .
' Thank you , ' replied <NAME> , showing all his teeth .
The old lady nearly blowed us into shivers and smithers , many times. ' ' Why ? ' asked <NAME> .
' I lost the boy , and no efforts of mine could recover him .
So , when the words were all spoken , he too kneeled on one knee on the grass , and the two men looked at one another .
In his dear <NAME> ' s name and in his own , thank you !
You know what they are ? ' ' Oh yes , I know what they are , ' said <NAME> .
' I ' ve a little something to trouble you with , Sir. ' ' Me ! ' exclaimed <NAME> .
Yet in that same moment he was the Secretary also , Mr <NAME> ' s Secretary .
How could they help it !
Then <NAME> hung upon her father and nursed his cheek against hers as if he were some poor dull child in pain .
Mr Carker in his own office was the first step ; Mr Morfin , in his own office , was the second .
Are you in the <NAME> , or where are you ?
you , of course , ' said <NAME> .
But I leave the ole to you , Mr Boffin. ' ' Come ! ' said Mr Boffin .
And get on , my lads ! "
' It is not funny at all. ' ' Oh ! ' said <NAME> , with all possible humility .
Then who so blest and happy as <NAME> , saving and excepting Mr <NAME> !
' Hip , hip , hip , and nine times nine , and one to finish with , and all that , understood .
For a moment only ; but with a transient gleam of scornful wonder on her face , not lost on one observer , who was smiling round the board .
He begins quite to amuse our little party .
" I will prove you , " repeats mademoiselle in her former whisper .
When you wouldn ' t give me nothing .
He will find some specimens there , by no means remarkable to any man who has been in <NAME> , but sufficiently striking to one who has not .
'Your master 's not at home ; there 's not a man in the house , and he 'll kick that door down in ten minutes . '
' Perhaps you are right , uncle , ' replied Mrs. <NAME> , submissively .
Not even to try to make some amends ? ' ' You are such a dreamer , ' said the boy , with his former petulance .
She could distribute , and did distribute pretty looks and smiles to every one among them .
Oliver retained his stool by the fire ; <NAME> wrapped in a blanket , stretched himself on the floor : close outside the fender .
Then I am here as soon as you , you see .
I might have been too reserved , and should have patronized her more ( though I did not use that precise word in my meditations ) with my confidence .
Everything was bolted and barred that could by possibility furnish relief to an overworked people .
' <NAME> ' s very fond of you , ain ' t she ? ' <NAME> once asked <NAME> when they were sitting by the fire with the cat .
" I advise him , then , to do no more business in that quarter .
What would <NAME> say ? ' At the mention of this name , his daughter stole a look at him , remarkable for its intense and searching character .
He replied , ' I am , ' 'Very well , ' said I , 'now let us be business-like .
He stopped at a door .
<NAME> <NAME> had ocular demonstration of the fact , that the rumours of old <NAME> ' s treasures were not exaggerated .
Very well , so am I shocked too ; so we are both shocked , and there 's an end of it ! "
Almost at the first word , <NAME> started and became deeply attentive .
So I thought when <NAME> married , and so I always have thought since .
Some of the people were eating , and some fanning themselves with handkerchiefs ; for the crowded place was very hot .
' Of course you have come back hungry ? ' ' Why , then , I do consider myself rather so , master , ' was the answer .
So you gave notice that you were going ?
<NAME> <NAME> emerged at early morning from the workhouse-gate , and walked with portly carriage and commanding steps , up the <NAME> .
" Yes , do , father , " says <NAME> .
Do n't look forward to variety , but you 'll have excellence .
As I came to myself ( with the aid of a heavy thump between the shoulders , and the restorative exclamation " Yah !
May God bless our endeavours ! ' They were now standing at his house-door , and a cheerful sound of voices and laughter was heard within .
' You didn ' t recommend her , you know , ' said <NAME> ; ' how could you ?
As to your gentleman-friend , he may take himself off , wherever he likes best .
He would be a valuable acquisition with such an assistant as <NAME> , and must ( thus <NAME> argued ) be secured without delay .
" Jo , " repeats <NAME> , looking at him with attention , " Jo !
'Of course they can , ' replied <NAME> .
The passive desolation of disuse was everywhere silently manifest about it .
Has no toes on the left foot. ' ' Ran away , a negro woman named <NAME> .
Oh no , for that would be too much !
' A proud fool ! ' said my aunt .
<NAME> <NAME> ' s head was usually decorated with a very round hat , unusually high in the crown , and curled up quite tight in the brims .
" Oh , no doubt , " said <NAME> .
You have a brother ; you know it , and him .
Once more , <NAME> , by a rapid motion of his arm , unaccompanied by any noise , checked him in his purpose .
We do n't pretend to do it . "
' He said I should object ? ' asked <NAME> .
' As I say , the end crowns the work .
Oh , my aches and pains !
He had given an address in <NAME> , had this chap ; but when it came to the point , of course nobody knowed anything about him .
We do n't know what may happen. " " Heaven knows we do n't , " returned <NAME> , " but have no fear for me .
' There I must umbly beg leave to differ from you .
We made a pleasant journey down into Lincolnshire by the coach and had an entertaining companion in <NAME> .
Well ; <NAME> took her home .
Mr <NAME> thinks not , and hints at a refuge in one of them genteel almshouses of the better kind .
<NAME> and sharp as flint , from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire ; secret , and self-contained , and solitary as an oyster .
For business or pleasure , in summer-time or winter -- I don ' t care which -- there ' s nothing like it .
you don ' t know , miss , of course you don ' t know .
The time allotted to a lesson having fully elapsed , there was a general putting on of bonnets .
' Pass the word , and there ' s another ready for you , ' quoth the <NAME> .
Nothing less than a repetition of that infallible remedy will relieve his feelings .
'Well , well , ' replied the Jew , with an attempt at pacification ; 'and , if you have , it 's your living ! '
Unnatural the hand that had directed the sharp plough , which furrowed up her gentle nature for the sowing of its seeds !
'Your late unfortunate husband should have taught it you ; and then , perhaps , he might have been alive now .
At length he returned ; and in reply to an anxious inquiry after his patient ; looked very mysterious , and closed the door , carefully .
I think of every little trifle between me and <NAME> , and feel the truth , that trifles make the sum of life .
' Since the above was written , we received a note from the clerk of the <NAME> , giving the following particulars .
Why , take yourself , <NAME> , <NAME> .
The quiet spot , outside , seemed to remain the same , saving that there was music in the air , and a sound of angels ' wings .
And I never will leave him now , till I have seen him with her. ' ' And when you have seen him with her ? ' said <NAME> .

But , the charm was broken .
" In short , " said <NAME> , " this is a desperate time , when desperate games are played for desperate stakes .
The greater portion of this assemblage were rather asserting their supremacy than doing anything else , as they had no particular business there , that anybody knew of .
It gave him a surprised look -- not to say a hearth-broomy kind of expression -- which , my apprehensions whispered , might be fatal to us .
Mr <NAME> was the first to lift up his head and speak .
There was another , and a darker object , to be gained .
Let us see the natives in their aboriginal condition. ' ' Though they ARE that sort of people that you mentioned , ' I returned .
If not remote enough , I can go remoter .
And of any new professional connexion too , for if I was to give a reference to-morrow , it would be mentioned and would sew me up .
" You see , miss , I have been handcuffed and taken into custody and brought here .
' There ' s small glasses on the shelf , ' said <NAME> to his daughter .
' My dear <NAME> , ' said Mrs. Micawber , ' of your friendly interest in all our affairs , I am well assured .
But this was not the effect of time so much as of the change in all my habits made by the helplessness and inaction of a sick-room .
' Ah , child , you pass a good many hours here !
I have often told you , <NAME> , you have no such sympathy . "
He did it with some flourish of ceremony , for a mail journey from <NAME> in winter was an achievement to congratulate an adventurous traveller upon .
He ' s a little dusty , but he ' s very like you in tone .
Well-seasoned timber is an expensive article , sir ; and all the iron handles come , by canal , from <NAME> . '
Yes , he came to the same end ; quite the natural end here , I assure you .
Why , wherever you are going , " said the gentleman .
' The appeal to him seemed necessary .
' And how is <NAME> , my good fellow ? ' Mrs <NAME> asked him .
Having made this arrangement with great despatch , he assisted Mary in the long-deferred occupation of shaking the carpets .
I am the man as is guaranteed , by unimpeachable references , to be a out-and-outer in morals and uprightness of principle .
I knew your father before you .
I was surprised to see that all this time everything was done by the child , and that there appeared to be no other persons but ourselves in the house .
" But now I have told you , you do n't think it wrong of me , do you ? "
Less remarkable , now that she was not alone and it was darker , <NAME> hurried on at <NAME> ' s side , unmolested .
I had a doll married , last week , and was obliged to work all night .
' And what did Mrs. Gummidge say ? ' I asked , when I was grave enough .
May it haunt their houses pleasantly , and no one wish to lay it .
I am sufficiently behind the scenes to know the worth of political life .
Perhaps yes , perhaps no. " " Listen then , <NAME> , " Number One of that name sternly interposed .
In which <NAME> falls in <NAME> .
The heaviest rain , and snow , and hail , and sleet , could boast of the advantage over him in only one respect .
" At poor <NAME> 's , " said <NAME> .
said <NAME> as we went downstairs .
We all took some , but our appreciation of it was gone , and we merely made a show of eating it .
He was shown into the little back study , where sat <NAME> and his friend <NAME> , with decanters and glasses before them .
Do you know what you have done ?
That ' s the Question. ' Mr <NAME> was so soothingly persuasive as to be quite pathetic .
When these people howl , they howl to be heard. ' ' Most people do , I suppose. ' ' Ah !
However , of course , you can do as you like .
" It shall say it , <NAME> .
What does it matter ? ' <NAME> seemed rather at a loss to understand the last four words ; replying , ' How , matter ?
Who so mindful of those he left at home -- albeit they were but a mother and two young babies -- as <NAME> ?
Nor is it your fault .
So I says to <NAME> when he has done , who is this old lady he has seen ?
' <NAME> , ' she said at length .
' His name ! ' cried <NAME> .
You made it all right , first .
I would walk back at my leisure .
I don ' t think that there ever were such people as those Peltiroguses .
And one other thing regarding him was whispered in the echoes , which has been whispered by all true echoes for ages and ages .
She knew of their existence by hundreds and by thousands .
' Is <NAME> with you yet ? ' I asked .
In the evening , sometimes , I went and sat with <NAME> in the kitchen .
<NAME> up to her , <NAME> .
Then I shall probably not see him for some little time to come .
The inexhaustible baby was two or three months old , when <NAME> began to notice a cloud upon her husband ' s brow .
Especially One Happy Afternoon IX .
' This is your doing , <NAME> , you cruel thing ! ' said my mother .
There is a reason against this matter , there is a personal relation concerned in this matter , not yet explained to you .
Did you open my packet , <NAME> ? ' ' Why , ay , ay , ' said the <NAME> .
Come on , and have it out in plain words !
" I know there is such a stationer , " returns <NAME> .
The woman looked very hard at the whole party ; and the red-headed man whispered something in her ear .
The big-headed babies were equally obliging in lending their grotesque aid to the general effect .
A bread-and-butter pudding entirely disappeared , and a considerable amount of cheese and radishes vanished by the same means .
A dim light shone at intervals from some bed-room window ; and the hoarse barking of dogs occasionally broke the silence of the night .
said Mrs. Mann , thrusting her head out of the window in well-affected ecstasies of joy .
Mr Dolls , accepting the shilling , promptly laid it out in two threepennyworths of conspiracy against his life , and two threepennyworths of raging repentance .
He will want it when he comes back .
<NAME> <NAME> sat looking down upon her , as inflexible as a figure of brass .
The old , white-headed father , too -- such deference -- such respect -- such devoted friendship -- he worshipped me !
The trooper falters and looks at him .
<NAME> <NAME> can never permit that assertion to pass uncontradicted .
<NAME> <NAME> inquired in what respect ?
<NAME> <NAME> , with manifest tokens of astonishment , took the diminutive document , and found it to run concisely thus : -- Dolls attended at their own residences .
<NAME> <NAME> thought so also ; but , under all the circumstances , he considered it a matter of sound policy to be silent .
Other people had thought of such things , if I had not .
I lie down now , to ease my head .
My aunt received a few lines next day in reply ; addressed , outside , to her ; within , to me .
' Does he requite her affection ? ' ' <NAME> kindness , considerate self-denying kindness , is not in his nature , ' returned <NAME> .
' He is , ' said the middle-aged lady .
I propose to consecrate this little retreat , by having a ceremony in which I take a great interest , performed there .
I am a keeping that young man from harming of you at the present moment , with great difficulty .
' What ' s this ? ' repeated Mr Dombey , almost foaming .
It is a retired situation .
'Go on , ' said the person addressed , turning away his face .
He had that good reason for sympathy with haughtiness and coldness , which is found in a fellow-feeling .
<NAME> could say no more .
Both gentlemen laughed for some time .
' Not on no account , ' replied the inexorable creditor .
As they abased themselves before him , <NAME> took a seat , and waved his hand in his most courtly manner .
My credentials , entries , and memoranda , are all comprehended in the one line , 'Recalled to <NAME> ; ' which may mean anything .
I Fall into <NAME> V. I Am <NAME> VI .
' What did you want to say ? ' demanded <NAME> , shaking him .
Having parted from her with what may be conjectured to have been a rather bony kiss of a cosmetic flavour , he gave his daughter his blessing , graciously .
<NAME> sharp , or <NAME> will think I 'm lost . '
I have never been in the streets with one of them. ' ' Heard me talked of among ' em , though ? ' ' No .
don ' t you understand ? ' And out of that look he vanished from her view .
' Pe-e-e-ill ! ' Horses make a desperate struggle .
That ' s exactly what I am incapable of doing .
Wherefore , he only muttered a brief defiance of his master , and did as he was ordered .
<NAME> , <NAME> , is not a bad or a degrading quality .
The way he ' d sit and chuckle over himself !
' Ah , ' said <NAME> , with great sharpness , ' Oh , them " Blimbers " ' ' Don ' t blame anyone , ' said <NAME> .
But you -- where are you going , where are you coming from , what have you been doing since you left me , what had you been doing before ?
I won ' t deduct for it ; I look to you to make it up handsomely by keeping the expenses down .
He was a sort of town traveller for a number of miscellaneous houses , now ; but made little or nothing of it , I am afraid .
<NAME> <NAME> received such patients here as his old reputation , and its revival in the floating whispers of his story , brought him .
There was a broad strong ledge of stone to this grating where the bottom of it was let into the masonry , three or four feet above the ground .
'If it was <NAME> , or the <NAME> , or <NAME> , or -- ' ' I do n't care who , ' replied <NAME> impatiently .
Nothing can be tided over now , <NAME> .
'She shall , ' said Mrs. Maylie .
Many a night and many a day had its inmates listened to the echoes in the corner , with hearts that failed them when they heard the thronging feet .
' <NAME> wants , ' she said to <NAME> , ' to go to London. ' ' Why to <NAME> ? ' returned <NAME> .
I would sooner send him away , though I know I am the only person who appreciates him , than have him , and not spend his money on himself .
So , keeping to byways , and shunning human approach , this troublesome old woman hid herself , and fared on all through the dreary day .
You 're a scorpion -- a brimstone scorpion !
I called to his recollection the <NAME> maid and the eager offer of herself she had made to me .
<NAME> combined with the attractions of her youth and beauty , a certain weight of self-sustainment as if she had been married twenty years .
She breathes quickly and heavily , but she stands as unflinchingly as ever he has seen her in the midst of her grandest company .
'Wot a precious strange gal that is ! '
Here , the moonlight is so very bright again that the colours of the nearest stained-glass window are thrown upon their faces .
A letter lay on his table .
" But the question , <NAME> .
When they take their inventions into foreign countries , that ' s quite different .
When he lay down on his straw bed , he thought he had done with this world .
What can YOU come for , because we are all very sure before-hand that you are not going to talk !
' Good man ! ' replied <NAME> ; ' bless your heart and soul , my dear Sir , <NAME> is at the very top of his profession .
<NAME> morning , sir , much obliged. -- Door ! " The last word was flung at the boy , who had not the least notion what it meant .
The break he set between his last two sentences was quite embarrassing to his hearer .
But to explain why Mr <NAME> reined in his horse quickly , and what he looked at in no small surprise , a few digressive words are necessary .
' They should be so , of course .
In the corner by the chimney stand a deal table and a broken desk , a wilderness marked with a rain of ink .
' I ' m glad to hear it , but I don ' t remember when .
' While I was foreman at the Bower -- afore it WAS the Bower -- I considered the business very satisfactory .
He had a reason for going away , though it was an insufficient one . "
' I wanted to speak to him. ' ' What did you want to say ? ' asked half a dozen voices at once .
And she handed me the key across the counter .
Give him the new bill to sign , <NAME> , and he 'll sign it like a man . "
His arm trembled as it raised her , and supported her head .
Now , it is of no use asking too much of me .
But it pleases me to hear the old music , though I am very bad. ' ' You are a traveller !
The floors were scrubbed to that extent , that you might have supposed the <NAME> blacks emancipated for ever , and gone out of the land for good .
' What wages do you get ? ' ' <NAME> what I could wish , ' replied young Blight .
' Now tell me I ' m a liar ! ' said the honest man .
<NAME> and wide lay a ruined country , yielding nothing but desolation .
It ' s the case with my own wife .
I squeezed it dry to-day. ' ' Nonsense , sir .
He was not singing as usual , nor was he seated at his desk .
Come in ! ' ' I beg your pardon , Mr Carker .
One of these expeditions led them through the churchyard where was his father ' s grave .
' Because I should change ; not those about me .
' That is my brave boy , ' said <NAME> .
Put it to her ladyship , if you think it right , from <NAME> of the Detective .
But as I mentioned to my friend <NAME> , I could not admit the criminality of my lovely and accomplished relative until it was perfectly established .
One of you is enough. ' ' You have an accurate memory of your own , ' said Mr Dombey .
' Prepare yourself for intelligence which , if you have any human feeling in your breast , will make even you shrink and tremble .
Oh dear , dear , what a man it is ! ' ' <NAME> of the bygones do you want to revive ? ' said <NAME> .
Besides , it is in the way of trade .
I don ' t feel quite myself .
' That is what alarms me so much. ' ' Instant measures must be taken , ' said <NAME> .
" I am glad of your good opinion . "
<NAME> tell me what it is. ' I replied that I had no complaint to make , either of my Mistress or to my <NAME> ; but I must go .
It was <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> .
Now , I hear <NAME> 's step coming to the door .
Stretching forth his flabby paw , <NAME> lays the same on Jo 's arm and considers where to station him .
' <NAME> to do it , were you ? ' said <NAME> .
There had been rain all day , and there was a damp feeling in the air .
When he left me for my good—he never would have left me for his own—I know he was almost broken-hearted with the trial .
I come up in a cab , and the cab ' s waiting to be paid .
" Very magnanimous indeed , sir , " observed my guardian .
<NAME> came round for me at dinner-time .
' To think of your going and attacking me , that have always been a friend to you !
However , he would n't be , and there was an end of it . "
She began to forget him soon after her discovery of the <NAME> family .
But never mind them just now .
" I know your engagements , " said he , " and I know you are out of sorts , <NAME> .
His adversary saw the advantage he had gained , and followed it up .
He introduces <NAME> , and then he is good friends with <NAME> and borrows five pounds of him .
<NAME> , now permanently heavy , did not release <NAME> from the survey of the house , until it had extended even to his old garret bedchamber .
It is late ; I need say no more to-night .
" Says you , 'Joseph , he gave me a little message , which I will now repeat .
See another reason for urging it on !
It is too insolvent a state of things for any one with any self-respect to entertain , and is universally scouted .
This was the utmost description <NAME> could give me .
I verily believe that her not remembering and not minding in the least , made me cry again , inwardly , -- and that is the sharpest crying of all .
' I could n't see 'em suffer before my very eyes , you know sir . '
That , my dear <NAME> , appears to me to be his true position .
' You ' re quite a sailor , I suppose ? ' I said to <NAME> ' ly .
' Oh , nothing , nothing , ' replied <NAME> .
And as to plate , <NAME> bless you , we haven ' t so much as a tea-spoon. ' ' All to be earned ? ' said I , cheerfully .
As they find the fact , they will judge me .
'He 's drunk it all up , every drop , ' said Chitling after watching the dog some time in silence .
" He 's an invalid now , " replied <NAME> .
It was solely the effect of his internal emotions .
' He can not answer for others. ' ' My dear , ' returned <NAME> with sudden seriousness , ' I have no desire to answer for others .
<NAME> <NAME> was a gentleman and a man of honour , and I put it to him first to give me his -- his own opinion .
" You may observe , <NAME> , that I abstain from examining this paper myself .
For whom , perhaps with some old instinct of his race , the gentle <NAME> had spread a carpet .
' Been out to-day , <NAME> ? ' Mrs <NAME> answered , for a short drive .
<NAME> and myself will constantly keep a double look-out together , on our goods and chattels .
' " Oh , the deception and villainy of the man ! " said the widow .
They asked me to look out for you , ' said the man .
' Mr Rokesmith goes with us ? ' he said , hesitating , with a look towards the door .
It ' s all owing to your precious caution that they got hold of it .
" Such as they were , of course . "
We never did look at this subject from the same side , and we never shall .
oh no , I have not been out of town , ' said <NAME> .
It appeared to have become a perfect passion with <NAME> , that the only son should be pitted against them .
He was still by the river-side .
<NAME> and <NAME> If the secret I had to keep had been mine , I must have confided it to <NAME> before we had been long together .
Continuing to chuckle when his laugh is over , as though remonstrant with himself on his drinking powers , he rolls to the door and unlocks it .
Let some be upon their guard .
" I was bred in this place .
' Yes , it is rather near , ' replied <NAME> , ' rather too near to be pleasant -- eh !
It was not , she remarked , so palatable to her , but it was the next best .
' <NAME> , I think , ' said <NAME> , still gaily , ' I must throw myself on the protection of the Court .
Surely they can wait , till I come back ! ' <NAME> looked all round the table as she said it , and appeared very uneasy .
' Forty-two , ' replied the driver , eyeing him askant .
<NAME> <NAME> , thus instructed , climbed into his saddle , with about as much difficulty as he would have experienced in getting up the side of a first-rate man-of-war .
<NAME> , poor me , the business is slack , is slack !
I am as free as the air .
There ' s a chill in the air , governor .
I have systematically devoted myself ( as you know ) to the education of the reason of my family .
<NAME> not soothing , but reverse .
He ' ll cut up so rough , <NAME> , at our talking together without him .
<NAME> o ' th ' kind , ma ' am , nowt o ' th ' kind .
<NAME> morning. ' Young <NAME> seemed discomfited at this , as not having at all expected him to go .
His brother ' s greatness , wealth , freedom , and grandeur , pleased him without any reference to himself .
She was by that time perseveringly dictating to <NAME> , and <NAME> was fast relapsing into the inky condition in which we had found her .
' What ! ' cried the <NAME> , in a terrible voice .
They shall be made an example of .
They tended their flocks severely in buckram and powder and put their sticking-plaster patches on to terrify commoners as the chiefs of some other tribes put on their war-paint .
It means your precious Mr Wrayburn ; that ' s what it means. ' ' Charley !
But the room was dark ; and as she made no answer to his call , he was fain to go back for the lamp .
" Whether by his own hand -- " " Upon my honour ! "
Oh ! ' ' But it ' s all over now -- all over for good , <NAME> .
In the first instant of alighting , Mrs. <NAME> turned her distracted eyes towards the waiting coaches , which were in great request .
She had done her work now , and her hand , faltering on the arm of his chair since its last tending of him , was hesitating there yet .
If the individuals in the <NAME> oblige <NAME> to sustain a great sacrifice , that is between themselves and their consciences .
' I am sure you do not , my dear , ' returned her mother , ' for you have a fine brave spirit .
' Of all the ruinous and desolate places my uncle had ever beheld , this was the most so .
' Shall I put it off till to-morrow ? ' said <NAME> .
" Thirdly , you can judge for yourself whether it is at all like that , " says <NAME> , suddenly handing him some sheets of written paper tied together .
I will be the mistress of <NAME> when you please . "
The guard was standing at the door , waiting for the letter-bag .
' These five sisters were all of surpassing beauty .
There never was such a house for noises .
A glimpse of the river through a dull gateway , where some waggons were housed for the night , seemed to arrest my feet .
No one answered ; but , from within the chambers , there proceeded a continuous spluttering sound of a highly singular and unintelligible nature .
' Thethilia , ' said <NAME> , who had brandy and water at hand , ' it doth me good to thee you .
You little fool ! ' ' I beg your pardon .
I find that I am heavy company enough for myself as I am. ' ' But the fame -- ' I was beginning .
'Smelling the grub like a old lady a going to market !
yes ! ' and nodded at the fire : to which , I am persuaded , she gave the credit of the whole performance .
Go and speak to <NAME> .
I must not leave it to be supposed that we were ever a great <NAME> , or that we made mints of money .
<NAME> , or <NAME> , walked at his side .
Truly , a proud and noble character that I describe in the supposed words of <NAME> , the uncle .
She did not weep ; she showed no greater agitation , outwardly , than when she was riding home .
Gets finer as she gets on .
Mr <NAME> was going to say , <NAME> , and had said <NAME> , when a grandiloquent change came over him .
' I can trust you as myself .
He had been so cruel to me , that I might have effected a separation on easy terms for myself ; but I did not .
The father , who once worked in a factory himself , will be a little disappointed at first very possibly .
No ! ' Comforting himself with this assurance , <NAME> closed his eyes and waited patiently till such time as he should wake up .
But I leave it wholly to you , sir. ' Mr Sloppy still continued his singular , and on the surface his incomprehensible , movement .
<NAME> ought to be possessed of the whole case .
' Did she ? ' ' <NAME> , you think not ? ' replied old Arthur .
Well spoken , <NAME> , so near your Mistress !
But there were other persons associated with these recollections , and many changes came about before they had being .
His feeling about the child had been negative from her birth .
She don ' t act as a vife , Sammy. ' Don ' t she , though ? ' inquired <NAME> , junior .
Thus I made the second discovery on that first occasion , that the nurture of the little <NAME> consisted of alternately tumbling up and lying down .
' <NAME> , ' I answered , with an involuntary imitation of his dark frown .
' Two parties , of course ! ' said <NAME> , nodding his head retrospectively .
Mr. What ' s-your-name , you were going to refer some question to Micawber .
I can ' t be more miserable anywhere , ' whimpered the whelp , ' than I have been here , ever since I can remember .
' If you had to die , ' said <NAME> , looking up into his face -- Mr <NAME> started , and seemed much disturbed .
She faintly shook her head upon the pillow , and kept her secret , as the boy had done .
" I am sure I do n't wonder at it ! "
The shadow attendant on <NAME> and her party seemed then to fall , threatening and dark , on both the mother and the child .
said the Jew , taking up a jagged and knotted club which law in a corner of the fireplace ; 'eh ? '
He stooped a good deal , and plodded along in a slow pre-occupied manner , which made the bustling <NAME> thoroughfares no very safe resort for him .
That would have been a change indeed .
I 'm going to take a liberty with you .
We don ' t mean money , bless you ; you ' re not to think of that !
we can talk it over now ; can ' t us ? ' Mr <NAME> bowed , thanked her , and said he hoped so .
' What ' s the matter here ? ' ' We were only asleep , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
' Then , I have got it , boy ! ' said <NAME> .
I -- ha -- need not trouble you , <NAME> .
' Bless you , yes , ' said <NAME> , ' and turned to with a will .
Come a very small and straggling congregation indeed : chiefly from <NAME> and the Precincts .
He knew , now , what he had done .
Only there ain ' t no Chicking in it. ' Here she shook herself , and fell asleep again .
I find that the image which I did suppose had been eradicated from my 'eart is <NAME> eradicated .
<NAME> <NAME> looked consciously at <NAME> , and heaved a little sigh .
" I shall be honoured , I am sure , " said <NAME> .
I assure you I have no desire to be controversial .
The <NAME> , & c. , is on sale .
Who would make the vulgar very picturesque and faithful by putting back the hands upon the clock of time and cancelling a few hundred years of history .
' <NAME> up , <NAME> ! ' cried <NAME> .
You were to go to the offices of the Haven of <NAME> , and put your name down as a Member and a Professing Philanthropist .
I was going for the one , and my darling was going for the other ; and my darling was right again .
D -- me , if my neck-handkercher a n't lined with beer !
" I should have said this sooner , but for my long mistake .
' <NAME> you. ' ' Indeed , ' said Mr Dombey , in his lofty patronage , ' anyone might say so .
He would find it was weak , he would say it was weak , and I was lost !
Returning with their jackets buttoned and their pumps stuck in them , they then produced packets of cold bread and meat and bivouacked under a painted lyre on the wall .
' I am very well , I thank you , ' he would answer .
But I hope I did it for his good .
I supposed the room was empty .
<NAME> <NAME> beamed at the books , but not so brightly as when he had entered .
<NAME> water , <NAME> ? ' ' No ; and take away the candle .
I am so soured. ' ' Yes , but hang it , ' says <NAME> argumentatively , ' a well-governed mind can be soured sitting !
' What are they doing now ? ' inquired <NAME> , adjusting his spectacles .
<NAME> ! ' said <NAME> , dragging off his skates with the impetuosity which characterised all his proceedings .
That lady acts as mistress of this house , and she is a highly connected lady .
They walked back together to the corner of the street where <NAME> lived , and as they drew nearer and nearer to it , silence crept upon them .
He had declaimed himself into a violent heat , and was as hoarse as he was hot .
I do n't know , " returned <NAME> , smiling .
You must pardon my finding fault with you , -- but why not have brought him ? '
Some of us can hardly expect , perhaps , in the natural course of things , to greet you on your return .
I have the most confused impressions of that walk .
' I know that , ' said the man , ' for I have been to the place they dwelt in , at the time of the inquest .
' Ha ! ' said he , very slowly remembering <NAME> , ' you were shut in last night ? ' ' Yes , Mr Dorrit .
She loved me dearly , but was never happy .
' And now I know what it is .
' <NAME> , won ' t you ever come and see me ? ' ' Yes , I tell you !
' That ' s wot he says , miss , ' replied <NAME> coolly .
' Is my peace nothing ? ' said the single gentleman .
Have I ever excused her for it ?
In hollow voices from <NAME> , <NAME> , and jail , this truth is preached from day to day , and has been proclaimed for years .
As it is , time must be lost .
I wonder at you , <NAME> , I do. ' All of which the <NAME> howled forth in a lachrymose whine , and backing carefully towards the door .
One might have said that the shadows of avarice and distrust lengthened as his own shadow lengthened , and that the night closed around him gradually .
' Would you , <NAME> ' am , would you ! ' said the Major , straining with vindictiveness , and swelling every already swollen vein in his head .
I say condoled , but her only words were " Jenny !
' God bless you , old fellow ! ' said <NAME> .
' Give me the one without a foot .
' About the land , grandma. ' ' What about the land ? -- Nothing the matter , is there ? ' ' <NAME> , no .
' I wish you had watched the play .
" Where will you put me ? " he asked , presently .
The accused explained that the citizen was his first witness .
He blamed himself exceedingly and told me in the most generous manner that he had been very wrong and that he begged my pardon a thousand times .
' Why , what lovely hair ! ' cried <NAME> .
' Another ? ' says this woman , in a querulous , rattling whisper .
'There is something in your manner , which would almost imply that she will hear me coldly , mother , ' said the young man .
After a short duration , the permission was most graciously conceded .
But the whole scene passed off in the breath of the last word spoken by his nephew ; and he and the <NAME> were again upon their travels .
This is not an inspiriting close to a dull day .
' One child dead , and one child living : one wife dead , and one wife coming .
to touch that passive hand in love and friendship .
When that person discloses , it will not be necessary for me to know anything about it .
They would not be moved .
I had had no purpose , no sustaining soul within me , anywhere .
' That ' s the happiness of you young people , ' she continued .
He meant his drawing the gentle head down to his pillow , and laying it beside him .
This must be very sore . "
You are a blessing to us .
very soon ! ' replied the child .
" Well , mother dear , I say again , I hope not . "
" Why , <NAME> is much the same , miss .
'The same reasons which influenced me then , will influence me now , ' said <NAME> firmly .
Mrs. Chadband composes herself grimly by the fire and warms her knees , finding that sensation favourable to the reception of eloquence .
There existed proofs -- proofs long suppressed -- of his birth and parentage .
I have not the least idea .
' That I see , ' observed the schoolmaster .
Hundreds of dead and dying .
" Circumstances , " pursued <NAME> , " over which I had no control , but quite the contrary , weakened the impression of that image for a time .
" And our lodger with you .
" You are out early , ma'am , " said I as she curtsied to me .
" No idea of money , " observed <NAME> .
And it 's run through my fingers and gone , you see ! " holding up his dripping hand .
' Why , I don ' t exactly know about perjury , my dear sir , ' replied the little gentleman .
Anything but his death , I told you from the first .
' Between such old and intimate friends as ourselves , ' pursues Veneering , ' there should in such a case be no reserve .
One lady ( a widow ) was quite certain she should stab him if he hinted at it .
<NAME> waited until the crowd had dispersed , and the bustle was over ; and then referred to a posted list of trains , and took counsel with porters .
I saw his finger uneasily going across and across his mouth during the whole of one long weary stage .
<NAME> Mrs. Wititterly broke ground next morning , during a pause in the novel-reading .
' You are a chit and a little idiot , ' returned <NAME> , ' or you wouldn ' t make such a dolly speech .
We were no longer alone .
He went down to the river last night , with <NAME> , to look at the storm , and has not been back .
Every description of <NAME> and <NAME> vegetable was got off the driest twigs of boys , under the frostiest circumstances .
I remonstrated , in allusion to the epithet and the vigorous emphasis <NAME> set upon it .
The village looks at him by stealth , for it is afraid .
Now you have begun to know me too , my young friend , and you may go .
'Are you going to sit snoring there , all day ? '
'She 's a shaking the shroud at me !
In came Mrs. Fezziwig , one vast substantial smile .
Of a Orse ? ' inquired the foreign gentleman .
" It 's what I seldom do myself , " says <NAME> with a grin .
He heerd it all , and see it all .
said <NAME> with a sigh .
' Again I ramble away from thinking it out to the end .
I have come down to look after the property ; it must be sealed up , it must be protected .
You can get me out , if you take me so .
You go and buy a tart -- <NAME> ' s man will show you where -- and mind you buy a rich one .
But , oh , it do n't matter !
'Now , you know what you 've got to expect , master , so call away as quick as you like ; the dog will soon stop that game .
Instead of coming up and being dead , let ' s come out and look alive .
' " Do ! " replied the client , with sudden vehemence .
The <NAME> said the same , and looked and spoke remarkably like an Irishman .
What will be , will be .
It is what YOU do .
She had been weeping ; for the traces of the tears were still wet upon her cheek .
' That I may be very kind to her , and take great care to try to please her .
I can say <NAME> , which is a most respectable title .
A doll she had dressed lay near upon the ground .
<NAME> , and the <NAME> Time be praised for this !
I observed that he doubled his right fist and delivered a secret blow into the crown of his cap , which was under his left arm .
' Can anything be finer or more delightful ? ' he inquired of <NAME> .
' Oh , that ' s nothing , ' said <NAME> .
The hand and the match and the voice were then seen by <NAME> to belong to Mr Inspector , once meditatively active in this chronicle .
There are various opinions on the merits , more or less conflicting with <NAME> 's .
Drink a little drop o ' this here , ' said the <NAME> .
" Have you anything to say to me ? "
He is surrounded by a mysterious halo of family confidences , of which he is known to be the silent depository .
Who forces it upon him ? ' ' Uriah , ' she replied , after a moment ' s hesitation , ' has made himself indispensable to papa .
<NAME> <NAME> was perfectly aware that a tree is a very dangerous neighbour in a thunderstorm .
Did they feel any of the wonder about her , that she felt about them ?
" You 're a nobleman , sir , " returns <NAME> with another taste , and his hot breath seems to come towards them like a flame .
Then , looking towards the glass front of the counting-house , and seeing two figures approaching , she cried with infinite relish , ' Papa !
You don ' t know <NAME> .
' I ' m sorry for it , ' said <NAME> .
A town so sacred to fact , and so triumphant in its assertion , of course got on well ?
It was such a powerful one that it seemed quite to lift him out of his seat .
I am here , in a position of trust .
' What ' s the use of this ? ' he demanded .
Next , our young friends begin to think , becoming mercenary , 'This is the man who HAD pounds , who borrowed them , ' which I did .
If there happened to be anything choice at table , she always sent it to me : but I always declined it , and ate of the rejected dishes .
At once a short cut and a broad road .
' Why so , my lad ? ' ' Why , ' returned <NAME> , looking about , ' I don ' t see his shaving tackle .
<NAME> <NAME> felt that as <NAME> ' s popularity increased , he ( <NAME> ) retired further into the shade .
Upon which <NAME> determined , that , come what might , he would develop the state of his feelings , without further delay .
It might be difficult to give an unselfish reason for being prepossessed against him. ' ' Not difficult for me , I think , <NAME> , ' returned his partner .
That every possible attention has been paid to his comfort , and that he is the object of every possible solicitude , I need not assure you , <NAME> .
There ' s nothing to be ashamed of ; it ' s a matter of mutual accommodation , nothing more .
'She has not moved , and will not till we are gone . '
' I can do that pretty well , I know , ' said <NAME> .
And if from them to my hat , how it came into the state in which you see it .
' Not that I want any inducement but yourself , <NAME> , I ' m sure .
There seemed to be a near affinity between us .
' A POOR widow , ma ' am , ' said <NAME> , with a powerful emphasis on that little adjective which conveys so much .
Well , say <NAME> -- I mean Georgiana. ' ' You were going to remark of <NAME> -- ? ' Lammle moodily hinted , after waiting in vain .
He had a momentary idea of knocking <NAME> down with it , holding him , and calling to the people in the court for help and a strait-waistcoat .
I might have felt happier if I had been .
" Was Miss Barbary at all connected with your ladyship 's family ? "
' Then you knew the man before ? ' ' Not before ; afterwards .
Tell her that I said I never could forget her gentle manner , or her beautiful face , or her sweet kind disposition that was better than all .
Show 'em how you scratch .
<NAME> 's clothes had been torn in the beating he had received ; his face was bruised and scratched ; and his hair scattered over his forehead .
He has told me in the strongest manner that he has never been his old self for one single minute since I first brought him to see you .
' No , sir , I haven ' t , ' replied the boy .
'Go up alonger this drivelling sick man , ' he says to his wife , 'and <NAME> , lend her a hand , will you ? '
On the first occasion <NAME> was left -- let me say , in short , in the lurch .
'Wot 's come of young Bates ? '
I have seen her married to a man who knew nothing of my fate .
' Have you come far this morning , gentlemen ? ' inquired <NAME> .
He is tough to a fault is <NAME> : " but it ' s a great name , <NAME> .
Everybody who comes in , is glad to know him .
But he immediately recovers himself , and cries ( still to the horses ) , ' Pill ! ' No effect .
<NAME> counted as nobody , and she was by .
We had sunk our voices , almost to a whisper , and continued to speak in that tone .
Quite a blessing , I am sure. ' ' Pardon me , ' returned <NAME> , ' but I am not in Mr <NAME> ' s confidence .
He broke off thus in answer to <NAME> , who addressed him as he came into the room .
So ' tis with her little bonnets and that .
You took him under your roof . "
' Do you decline it , sir ? ' ' I have no alternative but to do so , ' replied <NAME> .
' You will allow me , my dear , if you please , to judge for myself , ' said Mrs. Nickleby .
Why , take a look at ' em and see .
But no ; ' said <NAME> , stopping short .
This , ' referring to the little porch , ' is better than where you were .
The base word money should never be breathed near it ! "
His business with Mr Fledgeby will very soon be transacted , and then you can go up .
why not ? ' ' Because it would destroy all the delusion , and take away all the interest , wouldn ' t it ? ' replied the little man .
I have long been in <NAME> 's confidence , although he was not , until yesterday , a few hours before you came here , in mine .
'Yes , ' said the Jew , as suddenly rousing himself .
You heroine ! ' Her own eyes filled under his praises .
" You see what he is ! "
Three men , who had by this time advanced some distance into the field , stopped to take counsel together .
" I think I am , miss , " she replied .
I ' m sure she was the beautifullest creature ever was , ' said <NAME> .
<NAME> was the first to speak : " The last chance is gone : it was not much .
' Let him alone , will you , <NAME> ? ' cried <NAME> , pushing away her hand .
<NAME> , I never heard of him ! "
Issuing forth , then , upon the main , <NAME> took <NAME> round the waist , and bore her to the island also .
' Well , ' said that gentleman , ' if you leave me to suggest our destination , I say <NAME> .
This dashing young <NAME> , in a word , was likely to become a statesman , and to make a figure .
Then , it faltered , as if much surprised , and uttered my name , and I cried out , -- " Estella ! " " I am greatly changed .
What has brought Mrs. Rouncewell to town so unexpectedly ?
As I watched him in silence , he put his hand into the corner at his side , and took up a gun with a brass-bound stock .
'Lend a hand to the girl , ca n't you ? '
' To be sure , ' rejoined Mrs. Squeers , ' and he didn ' t take anything to eat with him ; that I ' ll answer for .
I hastened to inquire its name and purpose , and then my surprise vanished .
The trooper flushes angrily and hesitates a moment , but holds out his two hands , clasped together , and says , " There !
You never cared for me. ' ' Tharp ' th the word ! ' said <NAME> , at the door .
But if you have that purpose , you had better stop on the threshold of your scheme .
Not the least eager of the eyes assembled , were the eyes of those who could not read .
' " D , " ' the old woman read aloud , when he had formed the letter .
But I knowed you could n't be that. " " It is just the time , " said I .
This is a five-pound note , so you will have to bring me back , ten shillings change . '
The old man , in aiming a purposeless blow at <NAME> , or at nothing , feebly swings himself round and comes with his face against the wall .
I must get back quickly . '
Hastily cloaked and muffled , and stealing away .
All places are alike to me , sir .
It showed me many new occasions on which people triumphed over me , when they made a pretence of treating me with consideration , or doing me a service .
Her shoes came up at the heel , her hair grew bright and neat , her hands were always clean .
and I may say uncle too , all in one .
But I must go elsewhere and seek what I have not found here .
' I don ' t remember forms or faces now , but I know the girl was beautiful .
" He 's in all manner of places , all at wanst . "
<NAME> <NAME> 's eye comes back and meets <NAME> 's eye .
He appeared one morning in his usual agreeable way and as full of pleasant spirits as ever .
There was an universal cry of ' Alive or dead ? ' and then a deep , profound hush .
" The other patient lay in a back room across a second staircase , which was a species of loft over a stable .
' Oh , thank ' ee , <NAME> , don ' t it ! ' returned the sharp girl .
I would unhesitatingly mention <NAME> .
' Might you be looking for a Boarding-House ? ' <NAME> inquired , taking her observant stand on one side of the fire .
We thought you were dead ! ' ' Not yet , ' said <NAME> .
It is the first time that the house has been arranged for occupation since its late changes , and the happy pair are looked for every minute .
He immediately looked at the dish and began to carve .
It had remained so for a long time .
" To whom will our debt be transferred ? "
Only hear what I have got to say -- only hear me. ' ' How did you come in our garden ? ' faltered the housemaid .
If we had come up with them this morning , ' he continued , after a thoughtful pause , ' I was ready to prove a pretty good claim .
' It was crammed into my mouth. ' ' Who crammed it ? ' asked <NAME> .
replied the man , glaring at the opposite wall .
' I wish we had gone before .
<NAME> <NAME> ! ' Mr Quilp unintentionally adopted the very best means he could have devised for the recovery of his young visitor , by patting her on the head .
But that makes no difference in their following their own religion and leaving all of us to ours .
' Stand out of the way , dog .
Why should <NAME> be cross ?
But it might have done , if he could have read them .
Yes , I see my way now , right on . "
Mr Boffin wishes you to know that he does not expect you to stay at home any evening , on the chance of his coming .
I seemed to pay the deepest attention to him , but I was wandering in a garden of <NAME> all the while , with <NAME> .
' I have an idea upon this subject , ' said <NAME> , ' which I think may be very successfully adopted .
" I take upon myself , sir , " said my guardian , laughing as he rang the bell , " to reply to your proposals on behalf of <NAME> .
Is that it ? ' said the schoolmaster .
It was a dry cold night , and the wind blew keenly , and the frost was white and hard .
' I blame him for not living an hour longer .
<NAME> <NAME> goes upstairs , saying to himself , " These women were created to give trouble the whole earth over .
Condemned to a passage through the world by such narrow little dimly-lighted ways , and picking up so few specks or spots on the road !
" Oh , my dear Spyers , only let me have wengeance , and I shall die contented !
' You are there , are you , my friend ? ' he repeated , greedily biting his nails .
What we have said tonight is never to be said more .
" Nor I , " said <NAME> moodily .
Who did you want , ma ' am ? ' ' Miss Dorrit .
'Do you hear his worship ask if you 've anything to say ? '
After two o ' clock in the day , they are allowed to sing , a certain number at a time .
Now , my dear , put your arm a little further through mine , and hold it steady , and I sha n't hurt you ! "
" Take it in your right hand .
' Do you hear , cook ? ' said the lady abbess , stamping her foot impatiently .
We have all been mistaken over and over again .
The breakfast passed off in silence , for each of the party was brooding over his , or her , own personal grievances .
Mr Carker presently tried a canter ; <NAME> was still in attendance .
But she was so affectionate and sweet-natured , and had such a pleasant manner of being both sly and shy at once , that she captivated me more than ever .
In the meantime , it is always preparing , though it is not seen or heard .
I am not going to be eyed as if I had come from the <NAME> , and sit silent under it .
' You may consider yourself very fortunate in having escaped him so easily .
<NAME> nothing of money questions .
Here am I , content to receive things childishly as they fall out , and I never take trouble !
After that , she took the baby out of its little cradle , and nursed it .
' I am sure you would not .
If <NAME> ' r was here -- ' ' Ah !
That ' s aw enden ' twixt him and me. ' ' Have you left his work , <NAME> ? ' asked <NAME> , anxiously and quickly .
Desperately , but not wildly , for she knew that if she lost distinctness of intention , all was lost and gone .
" Among them odd heaps of old papers , this gentleman , when he comes into the property , naturally begins to rummage , do n't you see ? "
That was what I meant , I acknowledged , though he was a very harmless person , even when we had had more of him .
I had never , at that time , seen such a metallic lady altogether as <NAME> was .
She had obeyed without a murmur .
You ' ll ask me how I make out about the pockets ?
" I hope this marriage is for the best , guardian , " said I when we three were on our road home .
On the present festive occasion he emerged from his room , when the blithe bells were going , the picture of misery , in a full suit of Sunday penitentials .
'Look at his togs , <NAME> ! '
' Your husband , I take it , is not at home ? ' he said .
No gracious ray of light is seen to fall on <NAME> , kneeling at the altar with her timid head bowed down .
And I hope it is not at all unlikely that he may expand ( as a clerk of your acquaintance has expanded ) into a partner .
' This , sir , ' said <NAME> , ' is my wife , Mrs. Bounderby : <NAME> ' s eldest daughter .
<NAME> was my intimate companion and friend .
He made up his mouth as if to whistle , but he didn ' t whistle .
Oh , haven ' t I got him !
April Fool Day after that , I says , 'Now , old chap , you 're two and a eight in it . '
' I am not doing office-work , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
And <NAME> said , decidedly , yes he did .
' Of course you know the <NAME> well ? ' ' Yes , sir , ' rejoined Mrs. Sparsit .
I could myself have kneeled down then , so far away , and blessed him in my rapture that he should be so truly good and brave .
I seem to have been gone a twelvemonth !
' Now , my dear sir -- my dear sir , ' interposed the busy little man .
<NAME> <NAME> hereupon addressed me again .
I want to speak to you. ' Behold me , on my gallant grey , bending at the side of <NAME> , with my hand upon the carriage door !
" No offence , sir , " said <NAME> .
Looking after this man , <NAME> saw him go in at the door by which he himself had just come out .
' <NAME> , sir , ' he said , taking it back .
I had kept <NAME> 's flowers .
he ' s a doing beautiful ! ' responded <NAME> .
' Say what you like , ' answered <NAME> .
" I do n't know , " says <NAME> , opening his eyes , " why <NAME> should be worked to death .
I were a coming to ' t .
If , as your cousin <NAME> says , the sword wears out the what ' s-its-name -- ' ' The scabbard , perhaps , ' said <NAME> .
It was dated an hour and a half before dinner .
' Show me one , and try , ' rejoined <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> is down here. ' ' Who ? ' cried <NAME> , much astonished .
I am Mr <NAME> ' s Secretary .
Having delivered himself to this effect , <NAME> bowed again , looked into the crown of his hat , and stepped towards the door .
Nothing but your wife. ' The light hand stole about his neck , and the voice came nearer -- nearer .
I am afraid we present opportunities to people to do wrong , that never ought to be presented .
I will not tell you what misery he underwent , what agony of soul he knew , how great his mental struggle was .
The poor room was a happy room that morning .
' Ith a fact , ' said <NAME> , ' and even knowin ' it , you couldn ' t put your finger on him .
You needn ' t hurry back , my love , if there is , for we don ' t dine just yet , and there ' s plenty of time .
I am happy to report of this deserving gentleman , that his benches are usually well filled , and that his theatre rings with merriment every night .
I will mention the matter to-morrow morning when I take my seat . "
We have oftentimes the honour to entertain your gentlemen in their travelling backwards and forwards betwixt <NAME> and <NAME> , sir .
Every petty tradesman is to begin to pity her now , is he ?
I do assure you , father , that our first wish and intention is to consider your comfort .
But I have not the present means of raising the sum you have demanded .
' <NAME> friend ? ' ' Never mind , ' said Mr Fledgeby , shutting up one eye , ' any of your friends , all your friends .
' Oh , of course , ' said <NAME> .
How could they have a place in the shadowy conceptions of a gentle mind ?
His dread and hatred of the place became so intense that he felt it a labour to draw his breath in it .
Then , with a rapidity of transition very foreign to his usual character , he said , in pity for his former self , " Poor boy ! "
They was , to be sure and bring a note to you , Mr Carker , before you went out in the morning .
" What a number o ' cats you keep , <NAME> , " says I , when I ' d got intimate with him .
He had found Coavinses in his way .
<NAME> <NAME> immediately called to her husband that she would get them , and went , knitting , out of the lamplight , through the courtyard .
<NAME> about somebody else. ' As <NAME> took another cautious survey of the yard , the old woman made a secret motion to her daughter .
' Now , you see , <NAME> , ' he went on , ' a literary man -- WITH a wooden leg -- is liable to jealousy .
He is in his humble way a public man , but it is not in that sphere that he finds happiness .
There was another : a young man , whose madness was love and music .
' The old man uttered a loud yell which rang through the lonely fields like the howl of an evil spirit .
And yet he was so terrible a man !
No favourable leaning in that quarter to-day .
And why , my young friend ? "
" You wish you were going yourself ?
Everything seemed altered as he ran along the streets .
So the dream increased in rapture every hour , as Mr <NAME> felt increasingly sensible that this connection had brought him forward indeed .
She slightly showed me her arm , and it was fearfully thin indeed .
" Am I to read it now ? "
<NAME> was close upon him , and looked round the door too .
He was merely collecting himself to speak very plainly .
' If you knew what I am undergoing for you ! ' ' Of course he knows it , love , and will never forget it , ' said <NAME> .
I could not hear her disrespectfully mentioned , I added , without expressing my opinion in a decided tone .
In a few minutes she had ascended out of that clear field , in among the piled mountains of cloud .
" I sat with <NAME> last night , <NAME> , two good hours. " " <NAME> was <NAME> ? " " Dear little thing ! " said <NAME> .
The waiter retired , considerably astonished , and <NAME> motioned <NAME> to a seat .
Let us make haste back. ' ' Certainly ! ' cried <NAME> , ' the quicker , the better .
He sometimes took them to the street where she had lived ; but new improvements had altered it so much , it was not like the same .
" And I said , " I timidly reminded him , " but its mistress remained . "
' He went off dead. ' ' Oh , that indeed , ' said <NAME> .
Tracing it to its source , he discovered it to be caused by a sudden extraordinary rising and stiffening of all the risen and stiff hair on <NAME> 's head .
' I do , indeed , ' replied <NAME> .
Such opportunities as I have been enabled to alienate from my domestic duties , I have devoted to corresponding at some length with my family .
It is disgraceful to the electors .
All sorts of vehicles of burden are in attendance , from a tilted waggon to a wheelbarrow .
I have never pampered myself , and should not be ill .
I could have made my profit .
Then he laughed about her , and asked me if I had ever seen such a fierce little piece of incomprehensibility .
<NAME> had often wished to speak to this man ; yet she had never taken courage to do so , as he made no movement towards her .
Now it is even awful , stealing through it , to think of the live people who have slept in the solitary bedrooms , to say nothing of the dead .
Speaking as a sufferer by both , I don ' t know that I wouldn ' t as soon have the <NAME> lot as your lot .
Everybody was dressed for a Fancy Ball that was never to leave off .
Sing out , " good-bye , <NAME> , " when you ' re in the passage , and shut the door .
' You can , if you like , you know , ' said <NAME> .
Oh , you Jew ! ' The old man stood irresolute and uncertain for a moment , as if there might be further instructions for him in reserve .
It was all said in a moment , and they took me between them , wrapped in the cloak .
I am of your way of thinkin ' . ' ' <NAME> ' t make such a noise at this dead hour of the night .
' But I am not like you. ' The Father of the <NAME> said , with a shrug of modest self-depreciation , ' Oh !
She ' s a very taking and agreeable woman ? ' <NAME> smote the gentle Twemlow pale .
I shall come home when I please , and go when I please .
I counted up to high numbers , to make sure of myself , and repeated passages that I knew in prose and verse .
<NAME> ! ' They are in the act of ratifying the treaty of friendly move , by shaking hands upon it .
Is it true ? " " Too true. " " Can I only serve you , <NAME> , by serving your friend ?
' You can bear me out in that , <NAME> ? ' ' Eh ? ' cried <NAME> , looking from face to face with an expression of stupid amazement .
' I won ' t be silent , ' returned the nurse .
" He keeps his grog ready mixed in a little tub on the table .
'The cutting away when there 's anything wrong , and the eating all the wittles when there 's everything right ; is that his branch ? '
' I should have thought the deadness was a mild word for it , if it had been named to me when we brought you in .
" Did you know this morning , now , that you were coming out on this errand ? "
" An old acquaintance of yours , this road , <NAME> , " said <NAME> cheerfully .
A fish of the sea or river ?
So the time went on ; until it happened that <NAME> was called away from home by business which required his presence elsewhere , for three or four days .
" <NAME> , it _was_ I .
Do you never hear any haunted noises here ? ' ' <NAME> , ' returned Mr Flintwinch .
" Secondly , what will satisfy you for the trouble of producing it ? "
' Yes , ' said my mother , faintly .
As long as eating was a novelty and an amusement , <NAME> kept up pretty well .
Can you suppose there ' s any harm in looking as cheerful and being as cheerful as our poor circumstances will permit ?
Then , very strangely , I seemed to hear them , not in the reader 's voice , but in the well-remembered voice of my godmother .
And I went on at a mighty rate , as if it could be done by walking .
When is he coming , <NAME> ? ' ' What a question ! ' cried <NAME> .
' Did she tell you why ? ' I inquired .
You needn ' t tell me that , <NAME> .
' <NAME> ! ' said I , going to it .
Such brains are fertile in expedients .
At six in the morning , I was in <NAME> <NAME> , buying a bouquet for <NAME> .
And besides , ' added <NAME> , laughing as she pointed a rallying finger at his face , ' because I have got you in my power .
Nothing in the world , and no one in the world , could shake it or could move me . "
at last and at least , <NAME> must be told , ' thought <NAME> , with a sigh .
He came in and first tossed me some pieces of money ; then struck at me with a whip .
Whether they were or not , did not appear ; but they all had a weedy look .
' You know , <NAME> dear , ' she said , cheerily reverting to their former conversation , ' that I hope I may safely be trusted in great things .
I would have told him all my mother 's letter , but he would not hear it then .
I know what men they are from whom these schemes have come .
'It 's no good being proper in this world , ' said the first housemaid .
And how well that delightful old soul Mrs. Rouncewell is looking .
' For years , ma ' am , I was one of the most miserable little wretches ever seen .
You ' re a ready money man .
'There is nothing unusual in that , ' said the gentleman .
He turned into the <NAME> , and , having revived himself by twice pacing the pavements of <NAME> 's Bench-walk and Paper-buildings , turned into the Stryver chambers .
You don ' t think they ' ve gone to sea , anyhow ? ' ' Not gone for sailors , certainly , ' returned the mother with a smile .
'What do you think would suit me now ?
' Dear me ! ' cried that unfortunate gentleman again , ' I am worrited to that degree that I ' m almost off my head .
" Because you 'll come to that if you do n't look out .
' Oh Di , you bad , forgetful dog !
His getting on his box , which I remember to have been decorated with an old weather-stained pea-green hammercloth moth-eaten into rags , was quite a work of time .
I shall buy up some good Life Assurance shares , and cut into the Direction .
A merry Christmas to you , sir ! "
Now , <NAME> , examining this iron with a smith 's eye , declared it to have been filed asunder some time ago .
If you can ever give me help , rely upon it I will ask you for it .
What do we find , Mr Lightwood ?
' There was a very snug little party , consisting of <NAME> and her cousin <NAME> , and three or four romping , good-humoured , rosy-cheeked girls .
' I ' m sorry I should drive you there , ' said Mrs. Gummidge .
It was the queerest of rooms , fitted and furnished more like a luxurious amateur tap-room than anything else within the ken of <NAME> .
' The two youngest are only nine and ten .
inquired <NAME> , fixing his eyes on the Jew .
The silence was at length broken by <NAME> .
' You know who bricks and mortar is , I suppose , sir ? ' ' I do not , indeed , ' replied <NAME> .
Who would have thought it !
I have just been hearing of you .
" Well ? " said my sister , in her snappish way .
Upon my honour , I will keep your secret .
Either their beauty or the beauty of her arms is particularly attractive to <NAME> .
Nor do they see it any more that day .
'No , ' said the old gentleman , shaking his head ; 'it must be imagination . '
<NAME> confidence , so long preserved between us once , is restored , to know no further interruption .
<NAME> little thing , she 's liable to spasms , and it 's good for her to have her mind employed .
said the man , pushing her towards the door .
<NAME> ! " And he took another gentle little pinch of snuff , and lightly crossed his legs .
' You will not be rid of me so easily , I promise you .
What wonder that days became as years in knitting them together !
He knows his lesson , or he does not know it. ' ' He does NOT know it , ' <NAME> interposes awfully .
I fancied , indeed , that he sometimes chuckled audibly over this reflection , but the carrier said he was only troubled with a cough .
' Hoity-toity ! ' exclaimed <NAME> , shaking out her black bombazeen skirts , and plucking up all the ogress within her .
' What did you think of her , now ?
" And when she went from here , " I was proceeding , when <NAME> 's husband impatiently took me up .
I declare if I was Pa , I 'd run away . "
<NAME> was plainly disconcerted , and alarmed besides .

I will only say , at parting , that you do him a great wrong. ' ' I do him no wrong , ' she returned .
<NAME> , of your own noble will , to a ruined man !
He stood , half turned from the prisoner , lounging with his elbow against the bar .
' I find it so , ' replied the man .
Several doors were opened in succession , and finally his own .
' _You_ know you must keep up your spirits , mother , and not be lonesome because I ' m not at home .
Two ; four ; and two is six , ' measuring on the pavement .
He ' d take fire and blow up while he was about it. ' ' And so you would be rid of him , ' said <NAME> , humouring her .
Then <NAME> evaded and wandered away , while he was getting his man up to the mark .
My good mother lived in the country . "
' Is it possible that I had the honour , sir , of officiating when -- ? ' ' Yes , ' said I .
" What have I done ! " I knew not how to answer , or how to comfort her .
He reached the yard ; and his passion vanished in a moment .
' <NAME> ' t let him go alone ! ' screamed the females .
I was waiting for you , <NAME> , till it came down as <NAME> never saw it come down before .
Being left to himself , the savage had a dance , all alone .
' You decline to answer , do you ?
" I 've got a high pair as belonged to mother . "
' Your father can be free within this week .
I am only unfortunate to have come in the way .
<NAME> at them , " glancing at the sleepers on the ground .
' Yes ; uncle <NAME> , I would , ' returned <NAME> , with the energy of both her parents combined ; ' but not aunt <NAME> .
And so , as <NAME> observed , <NAME> bless <NAME> , Every One !
' <NAME> ' r ! ' cried the <NAME> , looking down upon him in amazement .
' My love , how you tremble ! ' ' Because I KNOW you ' re going to scold me , ' exclaimed <NAME> , in a piteous voice .
Filled with this idea , he advanced at once , but stealthily .
<NAME> mistrusts and suspects me -- goes to lawyers , and is taught to mistrust and suspect me .
I have not lived in a walking country , you know. ' ' True , ' says <NAME> .
' Take care he don ' t hear you , sir , or you may be sorry for it. ' ' Oh , pray , <NAME> -- ' said <NAME> .
Without waiting for a reply , he inquired of the boys whether any one among them knew anything of their missing schoolmate .
And then the dream grew dim , and faded .
The sun was down , the light had gradually stolen from the roof , and the shadow had crept upward .
But I -- I am afraid there ' s something the matter with them .
" I heard you were released , <NAME> .
I rather thought he might have been here today , sir .
As it so happened that I never saw <NAME> again , I may at once finish what I know of his history .
' And what then , pray ? ' ' Why , then you may go as soon as you like , ' says <NAME> .
The moment he ceased , she looked at him again .
Nickleby , there is terrible news for you , and I am sent to beg you will come with me directly , ' said a voice he seemed to recognise .
He shook my hand and said no more .
' Oh-h ! ' ' I should be glad to countermine him , respecting the handsome gal , your friend .
The swarm and buzz , and going up and down , endure for days .
Will you come and see me today , at any time you like to appoint ?
' That was my speculation , <NAME> .
" My physician , <NAME> , my dear , who was so exceedingly attentive to me .
So forget and forgive all round , <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> of the no surname , all shake hands with one another round , and with the doctor too .
They drew back from the window , and the <NAME> looked for explanation in his friend 's ashy face .
" 'Do you honour me with your attention , <NAME> ? '
Let me raise your head .
Why , here ' s a dismal face for ladies ' company ! -- my pretty sister too , whom you have so often asked me about .
So , Mr and <NAME> had to prompt , and this is how they prompted .
But here I am , left with all the ridiculous parts of the situation remaining , and , added to them all , this ridiculous dress !
Two taps were now heard on the outside of the window .
" Yes , so you did say about ten .
" <NAME> coarse and common ? " said <NAME> , playing with <NAME> 's hair .
From the blacksmith's. " " Halloa ! " said the sergeant , staring at <NAME> .
' You will take cold in the evening air , ' urged the spinster aunt affectionately .
' What ' s put marriage in your head ? ' She answered with such a start , that it quite awoke me .
She has rather a scaly appearance .
He had taken scarcely anything to eat or drink since early in the morning , and felt quite worn out and exhausted .
When there was any little hint of anything being in the wind , he got lost directly .
<NAME> <NAME> , slightly nudging his friend to take another look , makes a shuffling bow to <NAME> , who returns it with an easy nod .
And be sure that close to little Georgiana , also under inspection by the same gingerous gentleman , sits <NAME> .
The two shots were fired , as nearly as possible , at the same instant .
" It is close at hand .
Better than any novel-book _I_ ever see ! '
On charges of inviolable secrecy , confidences were interchanged respecting golden youth of <NAME> expected to call , ' at home , ' on the first opportunity .
<NAME> unconsciousness of what had happened in the home that existed no more , even the deep slumber of exhaustion could not produce .
" <NAME> , if I may speak plainly -- " " By all means . "
She does not care to go about with us ; she is lost in the society we have here ; our tastes are evidently not her tastes .
What are my agony and indignation next day , when I hear a flying rumour that the <NAME> have stood <NAME> in the stocks for turning in her toes !
How much more to hers !
He would bear nothing but his pride .
<NAME> on the part of <NAME> .
Mr Clennam , would you oblige me -- hum -- with a blue neckcloth you will find in that drawer at your elbow .
' Well , ' said <NAME> , as <NAME> and his companion drew nigh , ' you will see how your health becomes , and think about it meanwhile .
" Tony , " says <NAME> as they walk towards the court , " once again understand me , as a friend .
' There is only one phenomenon , sir , ' replied <NAME> impressively , ' and that ' s a girl. ' ' Very true , ' said <NAME> .
But all these occurrences preceded the final day .
Her pensive form was not long idle at the door .
I am getting old , <NAME> , and have lost nearly all my nails .
It will be better done without my being by .
It was sufficiently late in the year for the orchards to be ruddy with ripe apples ; and in a few places the hop-pickers were already at work .
The old man took off his hat -- he had no memory for the words -- but he said amen , and that they were very good .
He was left to himself , however , and there was comfort in that .
Shall we tell the lamentations that ensued when <NAME> found herself deserted by the faithless <NAME> ?
What would they have contracted ?
You fall into that habit , and then who notices or minds ?
They ' ll bother her head off , I think , before they have done with her .
It ' s a world of change .
He wants to see some fragment in <NAME> 's writing .
' Emma , ' he returned , ' that view of the question is , at such a moment , irresistible .
' Yes , yes , ' says the other .
Some injurious suspicion lodged itself in his brain , that she wanted to supplant <NAME> , and that she was given to drinking .
" Mrs. Chadband -- this gentleman 's wife -- Reverend Mr .
Whatever they could prove ( which is usually anything you like ) , they proved there , in an army constantly strengthening by the arrival of new recruits .
" If she is , she has reason to be .
<NAME> , my carpet- bag ! ' Bidding the other passengers good-night , in a rather snappish manner , the stranger alighted .
' Can ' t be done , sir , ' returned <NAME> .
As usual it was full of boarders , was very large , and had a broad colonnade to every story of the house .
When that person discloses , my part in this business will cease and determine .
They left her at the corner of the street , and <NAME> led the way to <NAME> 's , which was within a few minutes ' walk .
Now , for example , <NAME> , ' said Mrs. Micawber , assuming a profound air , ' a judge , or even say a Chancellor .
The water-wheel of the paper-mill was audible there , and seemed to have a softening influence on the bright wintry scene .
Give yourself a little treat ! ' ' No thank ' ee , <NAME> ' am , ' returned the Captain very humbly .
<NAME> <NAME> , having laughed heartily again , resumed his pipe with tears in his eyes .
By degrees they let him know that doubts have arisen , that inquiries are to be made , and perhaps he may be pardoned after all .
Not a fortified town that they passed in all their journey was as strong , not a <NAME> summit was as high , as Mr <NAME> ' s castle .
You come and ask me in the street to take you for a Secretary , and I take you .
Do n't deceive yourself , my dear .
This last discovery was made by the two friends in pursuing their inquiries .
' Do you know how this stone came here , my friend ? ' inquired the benevolent <NAME> .
As the wretched creature mumbled and chuckled in her hideous merriment , the undertaker turned to go away .
<NAME> James he began to be restless again .
" You will do me the kindness to remember , sir , that I am not at present placed ? "
We call this a state of childishness , but it is the same poor hollow mockery of it , that death is of sleep .
What is your remark on that proportion ?
' You were in the tiptop fashion , and all the rest of it , ' said <NAME> .
We were speaking of <NAME> Minster just now .
That I assert no cause whatever of complaint against her .
Will you go , <NAME> ? ' ' Will I go ! ' she repeated , turning very red , and breathing quickly as she looked round at her mother .
<NAME> to the defaulter whose appeal lay to the tribunal where those severe eyes presided .
All those lights were extinguished before I could sound the words. ' ' Light ' em up again ! ' said Mr Meagles .
Her little light curls were as crisp as ever , and she had already her spectacles on , which made <NAME> wonder whether she went to bed in them .
YOU have got YOUR nose out of joint .
' It ' s a deal too good to be married in , master , ' rejoined <NAME> , after a short inspection of the suit .
said she , putting her hand into her reticule , " I have nothing here but documents , my dear <NAME> ; I must borrow a pocket handkerchief . "
You ought to be ashamed of yourself .
Of such melodious strings is <NAME> formed. ' ' Then it IS the lady as formerly objected ? ' said <NAME> .
Of sunset once again , and nightfall .
O , I don ' t think so .
He says it is to you. ' ' Yes , I do say so , ' interposed the boy .
" But is the secret safe so far ? "
' I hope not , sir , ' said Mrs. Bedwin .
He then dressed for dinner , by taking off his glazed hat and putting on his coat .
On the other hand , she often looked at him , with interest and curiosity , if not distrust , but his face never showed the least consciousness .
Not near him ! ' ' What ' s his name , <NAME> ? ' inquired <NAME> , determined to be interested in the <NAME> ' s friend .
At least , if I could -- but I shall come to all that by and by , and it is mere idleness to go on about it now .
She is a very superior young lady , of very remarkable attractions , graces , and virtues .
' I ' m glad to hear it , ' returned the other .
' You ' re wanted , Sir. ' ' Who wants me ? ' <NAME> looked at <NAME> , and coughed .
' <NAME> to deprive you of a pipe , <NAME> , ' he said , filling his own , ' but you can ' t do both together .
<NAME> retraced his steps as quickly as he could , and entered the gloomy house with a sorrowful foreboding .
I found a great many foxes , disparaging whole vineyards of inaccessible grapes ; but I found very few foxes whom I would have trusted within reach of a bunch .
' I am bound to believe you , and of course I do believe you , ' said <NAME> .
' That ' s right ! ' It was from <NAME> ; something less legible than usual , and brief .
If you knew how I have looked for you , <NAME> -- ' ' Wery hard , indeed , I s ' pose ? ' said <NAME> drily .
' Talk of fairies ! ' cried <NAME> ' I never see anybody so light to be alive , never .
Let me explain to you what I mean. ' ' I think I don ' t want to know , ' said <NAME> .
" Where did you get swords from ? " " Out of a cupboard , " said I .
And his trust is not a very difficult one , for it is only an annuity of a hundred and fifteen pounds .
Yet there is something a little wrong about it in despite of its immense advantages .
' She is glad , glad , to be rich , that he may have the money .
There is a magic in the sound .
He looks to it , flushed and fitfully , to do something with his interests and bring them to some settlement .
<NAME> , with fresh tears , kneels at her feet and kisses her hand .
They saw the vault covered , and the stone fixed down .
It makes me shiver , <NAME> .
We are not accustomed to carry things with the same hand or to look at 'em from the same point .
' Naturally , Mr Headstone , I have a good deal of influence with her .
As he raised his head from stooping to do so , he found the landlady beside him .
It must be the theme of general conversation .
Then I feared that the young man would lose his situation and that I might ruin him .
Have no antecedents , no established character , no cultivation , no ideas , no manners ; have <NAME> .
<NAME> , the high priests of this worship had the man before them as a protest against their meanness .
'He has likewise attempted , sir , to murder the female servant , ' said <NAME> , with a face of ashy paleness .
She asked and gave no quarter .
' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> complacently .
I don ' t know how long we were going , and to this hour I know as little where we went .
' What have I been a-doing of ? ' asked <NAME> .
After a hearty breakfast , the four gentlemen sallied forth to walk to <NAME> , followed by a man bearing the stone in its deal box .
After several imperfect words , which vainly attempted to struggle to the surface , but were drowned and washed away by the strong tide of her tears , she spake .
Give him sixpence , or five shillings , or five pound ten -- you are arithmeticians , and I am not -- and get rid of him ! "
" Pooh ! " said he , " I did n't care much for it .
But thou know ' st our old agreement .
<NAME> <NAME> and his shadow had not stood near <NAME> , who held her father ' s arm , but in a retired place by themselves .
In this manner they were fed at the discretion of their master .
<NAME> <NAME> hurries to the landing and calls , " <NAME> !
The father opened the room door for us and bowed us out in a manner , I must acknowledge , worthy of his shining original .
And therefore I am very glad to get out of his way and to go home with my friend <NAME> . "
<NAME> <NAME> compares the faces with one eye shut up , while <NAME> smokes in stolid satisfaction .
And what ' s more , -- the boat ' s drove tight by the tide ' atwixt two tiers of barges .
' I ' ll tell you what , sir , ' he said ; ' the talent of this child is not to be imagined .
' You ' ll be asked the question down town , ' said the man .
' It ' s very kind of you .
I believe she conceals them , and always will conceal them , even from herself .
The blinds were all drawn down , and the inscription <NAME> and Co. seemed to doze in the counting-house window on the ground-floor giving on the sleepy street .
The passenger booked by this history , was on the coach-step , getting in ; the two other passengers were close behind him , and about to follow .
But he called till he was hoarse ; nobody paid the least attention to him .
The coach drives up to the door of an inn .
We do so too ; and passing through our little state-room , resume our seats in the quiet gallery without .
She tried hard to retain her firmness , but he saw it melting away under his eyes .
Let ' s talk ! ' ' Do you always live here , sir ? ' asked <NAME> .
All I desire , <NAME> , is , that it should be forgotten .
somewhere , anywhere , for refuge , never more to look upon the place from which she fled !
You are welcome to all you have kept from me. ' ' Are those of your own name dear to you ? ' said the man emphatically .
What was she a doing of , when you went in today ? " asked <NAME> .
Mr Chick , finding that his destiny was , for the time , against him , said no more , and walked off .
' Dead , <NAME> ? ' I hinted , after a respectful pause .
Here ' s a match , and now where ' s the candle ?
I am sorry to see you sitting in the street . "
' I am going up stairs to Mr Fledgeby ' s. ' ' You can not do that at this moment .
The storm soon began to pass upon its way .
Now , my dear , about that crib at <NAME> ; when is it to be done , <NAME> , eh ?
I could be here in the day , and turn in the night .
Receive at parting ; ' here he gave him a southern embrace , and kissed him soundly on both cheeks ; ' the word of a gentleman !
Now , the unfortunate deceased was himself a lawyer and had a pretty tight hold of me .
You and I are very different creatures . "
" My dear Jarndyce , " returned <NAME> , his genial face irradiated by the comicality of this idea , " what am I to do ?
I am sure I shall be very happy to show <NAME> to you .
* A remarkable instance of the prophetic force of <NAME> ' s imagination ; this dialogue occurring in the year 1827 , and the Revolution in 1830 .
As shadows of her fond imagination , she could give them equal place in her own bosom , and wrong them with no doubts .
I have started up so vividly impressed by it , that its fury has yet seemed raging in my quiet room , in the still night .
'You 're very , very kind to me , ma'am , ' said <NAME> .
The little man seemed rather baffled by these several repulses , and a short consultation took place between him and the two plump gentlemen .
Do n't believe that I 'll leave you or yours in the lurch , <NAME> .
" I intend to , <NAME> , " replies the other .
" Why do you point away ? "
Springing a Mine Refreshed by sleep , <NAME> rises betimes in the morning and prepares for a field-day .
' Pray , my dear , allow me to conclude .
I am prepared to do the usual thing which I have done regularly and to keep this matter going .
It is scarcely worth mentioning ; but , is it yet ? " " I had no intention , in the words I used , to claim it yet .
I think about a great many things , ' replied <NAME> .
I suppose they have not done trying on yet .
In the gallery opposite to the pulpit were a little choir of male and female singers , a violoncello , and a violin .
' Well , well , <NAME> , ' he said , with a disappointed air , ' this is not to the purpose .
Their entrance , whether by premeditation or a simultaneous impulse , was the signal of revolt .
He flung him in , bolted it , and turned the key .
' You are a happy fellow .
This short examination followed , for the court was quick with its work .
His cold and distant nature had neither sought one , nor found one .
" No , I don ' t , " says the man .
A morsel of bread. ' ' Do you see that ? ' returned the man hoarsely , pointing to a kind of bundle on the ground .
Diwisions among such must come , and must be met as they come .
He don ' t care for me , as I care for him ! ' cried <NAME> , lifting up her skinny hands .
It ' s Monday morning. ' ' At once , if you please , <NAME> , by all means , ' returned <NAME> .
There is an ordinary for ladies , and an ordinary for gentlemen .
You have not acquired , under <NAME> and Mrs. M ' Choakumchild , anything like that amount of exact knowledge which I looked for .
<NAME> on our staircase and read .
Where was I brought from ? ' Boldwig !
This is the separation that there is between us !
So , <NAME> ' s tombstone , with her father ' s record of his death , was almost of the Present , for she knew it was to be .
Have you no remembrance of what has been said between us ?
Finding that his watch has stopped , he turns into the jeweller ' s shop , to have it wound and set .
And now let me take the liberty of asking you a question .
' I was going on with the little I had left to say .
She ' ll never wake till it ' s all over , and there goes the clock again !
' You ' re very good , <NAME> , ' returned <NAME> , ' I am sure .
I only wish I wos , myself .
" I take it as a compliment . "
Still I don ' t say that I ' m going to keep ' em always there , for the sake of the beauty of the landscape .
He was the stateliest man in the company .
Her friendly indignation had an exemplary effect upon her husband , who shook his head at the trooper several times as a silent recommendation to him to yield .
' What friend o ' yourn is dead ? ' asks <NAME> .
Where did they go first , <NAME> ? ' The wretched <NAME> made a gasp , and a pause .
' I am sure I don ' t know what to do , ' said Mr Boffin .
It was <NAME> ' s hand , and he kept it on my arm as he said : ' What ' s this ?
There being plenty of gravy to-day , <NAME> spooned into my plate , at this point , about half a pint .
Some hopeful notion of seeing her , busily engaged in her daily duties , before she saw me , had been in my mind and was defeated .
What ' s she staring at ? ' he added , in allusion to the daughter , whose eyes were fixed upon the face that now again looked out behind .
Finding him so very friendly and companionable , it was then that I asked for the pen and ink and paper , to write to <NAME> .
The little expedition down the river was delightful , and the little room overlooking the river into which they were shown for dinner was delightful .
' Where ' s the reason for it ?
We tarried here three days .
There is a tie of many suffering years between us two , and it is the only tie I ever had on earth that <NAME> has not broken . "
There are three free-schools already erected , and in full operation in this city .
Get up , get up ! ' Her mother rose , and cried , and wrung her hands , and stood at a little distance gazing on her .
That room was their boat ; that audience were the maidens ; and he ( <NAME> ) , however unworthily , was ' first oars ' ( unbounded applause ) .
' And ye steer with a rudder , don ' t ye ?
He had divested himself of his brown paper parcel , but had made no alteration in his attire , and was , if possible , more loquacious than ever .
' We shall be happy , ' said <NAME> , ' to see <NAME> to dinner , every Sunday , if it should suit his convenience .
" Where are you going to , at <NAME> ? " I asked <NAME> .
Never done nothink to get myself into no trouble , 'sept in not moving on and the inkwhich .
But never mind him now .
It would n't have loosened the knot , or kept the drop up , a minute longer .
You see the rock that lies in his course .
Therefore <NAME> gave two knocks .
" <NAME> if I know , " said <NAME> .
' To hang himself ! ' cried <NAME> again .
I should not be at all surprised if he called to-day .
The banners were very well painted , and flaunted down the street famously .
' Here ' s somebody comin ' at last , ma ' am , ' said the short chairman .
" Then grant me this one great favour .
" Do n't say that , do n't say that .
' Think well of what you do. ' ' Yes , you had better think well , ' said Mr Boffin .
" And was christened so , my dear , " said <NAME> .
A dense justice in a corner is beguiled into a wink .
' Then give me your hand , ' retorted <NAME> .
' When we worked like the neighbours , we suited one another .
Thinking of this , she did not turn away with a delicate indignation -- too many of her own compassionate and tender sex too often do -- but pitied her .
After each sitting was over , and the patron had departed , Mr Wegg invariably saw Mr Venus home .
A <NAME> on My Way LXIII .
Nothing but a gentleman , <NAME> ! '
<NAME> <NAME> was much tickled at this : as of course he ought to be ; and laughed a long time without cessation .
I think nothing can be plainer than that ? ' ' Shall I marry him ? ' repeated <NAME> , with great deliberation .
Mr <NAME> also had been utterly discomfited , and quite unable to assert himself in any way .
' Having your likeness taken , sir , ' replied the stout turnkey .
<NAME> waited for the last stroke , and then knocked .
But as my aunt had swathed me up , I made no complaint of being inconvenienced .
All I have in the world is in this room , except the cottage ; and that I have left <NAME> to let .
" Repeal it , my dear sir ?
It was no nominal meal that we were going to make , but a vigorous reality .
' I know the stick to be his , and he carried it last night .
The low arched door then opened , and the face came out .
I have not the power . "
' To vich sum , he has added for the house and bisness -- ' ' Lease , good-vill , stock , and fixters , ' interposed <NAME> .
I knew I recollected the face. ' It was , indeed , <NAME> , the ugly clerk .
' Come on ! ' said the cab-driver , sparring away like clockwork .
My father , <NAME> , he were given to drink , and when he were overtook with drink , he hammered away at my mother , most onmerciful .
It is strange to know no more about either , and particularly you , than I was able to tell last night .
The Secretary would have attended her , but <NAME> advancing and saying with dignity , ' Pardon me !
asked <NAME> , anxiously regarding him .
The influence pervaded the spirit in which they returned to the previous question .
Go on , Sammy. ' ' " Lovely creetur , " ' repeated <NAME> .
The touch had its instantaneous effect .
' For the parents of a boy named <NAME> , who unfortunately -- ' ' -- unfortunately died at <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , finishing the sentence .
" In all other respects , my dear mother , I 'll be as tractable and obedient as you can wish ; on this one alone , I stand out .
I see her , an old woman , weeping for me on the anniversary of this day .
<NAME> as if she knew all about it , do n't she ?
' Forgive me ; I could not help saying that .
' You know whether the cap fits you , <NAME> , ' returned her brother sulkily .
' Please let me hold the pens , ' said <NAME> .
One beautiful evening , when the first shades of twilight were beginning to settle upon the earth , <NAME> sat at this window , intent upon his books .
We will never go away from here ? ' The child shook her head and smiled .
<NAME> <NAME> V. A Morning Adventure VI .
Therefore I have particularly begged of <NAME> , and I now particularly beg of you , my dear , not to move this subject with <NAME> .
' Halloa ! ' cried a voice inside .
<NAME> <NAME> merely paused in the act of drinking , and bade him either name his business or leave the table .
I shall never get its name now .
How do you do , <NAME> ?
Two friends of the young man , whom we had attracted to the doorway and who stood there with their hands in their pockets , echoed the laugh noisily .
Whether of questionable childishness or not in any other matters , <NAME> had a child 's enjoyment of change and bright weather .
I dare say you do , <NAME> ? ' ' _I_ remember ' em well enough , ' said the latter .
" In fact , I have just turned into my teens , " says <NAME> .
' I would rather go alone , thank you .
<NAME> , the uncle , commands the nephew to marry .
For more than a week she lay there , little altered outwardly , with her old handsome resolute frown that I so well knew carved upon her face .
Only don ' t crow. ' ' I crow ! ' exclaimed <NAME> , shrugging his shoulders .
' If there were any good , ' he said , ' I could do on this earth , I would do it , <NAME> , for you .
' Pounds for two , I think , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , solemnly .
' You keep with us , ' said Mr Meagles , in a threatening kind of <NAME> , ' and I ' ll introduce you presently .
It is possible that the gentleman may , on similar grounds , object to you. ' ' I hope so , ' returned <NAME> .
There are Podsnap the <NAME> , and <NAME> .
Her husband had no relations , and she was rich .
You 'll go down ? " " Yes , " said I , casting my eyes over the note , which was exactly in those terms .
As these works are pretty much alike all through the States , their general characteristics are easily described .
She made him our guardian , and he was a miserly wretch who grudged us food to eat , and clothes to wear .
' Yes , ' said <NAME> , biting his lip .
It hushed the eloquent , struck down the powerful , abolished the beautiful and good .
Mrs General conceded that high privilege , and here she was .
I have had unformed ideas of striving afresh , beginning anew , shaking off sloth and sensuality , and fighting out the abandoned fight .
But this was the origin of a series of Sunday excursions that these two curious companions made together .
She is the same bright vision to me , at present , that she was before I made <NAME> ' s acquaintance .
At last , the <NAME> read himself into a light slumber .
" That was when you never ought to have asked for the security , <NAME> , and when you never ought to have got it , all things considered .
There is no hurry or greediness apparent in the despatch of the meal .
My deary , show me a better !
' But it ' s worth the pain of hearing , only to know that Mrs. <NAME> recovered it , isn ' t it , <NAME> ? ' cried <NAME> .
We had , on our way out , to cross a paved hall , with glass sides and roof , over which a vine was trained .
You know that <NAME> is dead ; that <NAME> has confessed ; that there is no hope of any further gain .
At length , a low cry of pain broke the stillness that prevailed ; and uttering it , the boy awoke .
It will be like coming to the old <NAME> again . "
<NAME> faith in , and immeasurable admiration of , the <NAME> of the <NAME> , succeeded , and threw the <NAME> into a wondering trance .
And what more could I possibly do , if I did believe it ! ' ' You are a singular politician , ' said <NAME> .
I have no false pride .
I should think her like me .
All this was done with the greatest dispatch and without the waste of a moment ; yet nobody was at all hurried .
It is even difficult for me to believe that there was a gap of full two months between my return to <NAME> and the arrival of that birthday .
Every one must. ' ' I hope so , ' said the cherub .
' " " The man says ? " I observed , as <NAME> waited for me to speak .
Still <NAME> said , think of the situation !
' And vere is <NAME> ? ' inquired the old gentleman .
<NAME> <NAME> smoothed his head and face , and stood looking at the fire .
' I am pretty much as usual , sir , ' replied <NAME> .
' -- are not to be combated by any one , and I address myself to no such hopeless task .
" It does her credit , Mat ! "
I sit down by the fire , thinking with a blind remorse of all those secret feelings I have nourished since my marriage .
' I think , father , I require a little time. ' ' Papa is a preferable mode of address , ' observed Mrs General .
Here ' s the cottage , taking one time with another , will produce say seventy pounds a year .
The Courier , with agitation in his voice , announced ' <NAME> ! ' Mr <NAME> ' s overwrought heart bounded as he leaped up .
He wore a black velvet waistcoat , with thunder-and-lightning buttons ; and a blue striped shirt , with a white false collar .
Is she married ? " " Yes. " It was a needless question , for a new desolation in the desolate house had told me so .
" For to-day , I have , my friend .
They like me for his sake , as I do everything I do in life for his sake .
' I ha ' n ' t got a glass , ' said <NAME> .
The members of the deputation looked fiercely at each other , and afterwards at the member .
And he is making hay of the grass which is flesh , for his three daughters .
Why , he would answer , " Away with it ! " That ' s what he would answer , gentlemen .
' May I ask where it happened , Mr Twemlow ?
' Indeed , you have avoided me , Mr Carker , ' said <NAME> , with the tears rising to his eyes ; so true was his compassion .
In Fashion It is but a glimpse of the world of fashion that we want on this same miry afternoon .
' <NAME> , I am going home .
' <NAME> , <NAME> ! ' said the stout gentleman , when the citadel was taken , and the besiegers and besieged sat down to dinner .
' Send my fellow here. ' ' Gone to bed , sir. ' ' Tell him to get up , and pack up. ' He wrote two more notes .
" You know what you have got to do .
' You are a very old friend of my nephew ' s , <NAME> , ' said my aunt .
I thank you for the question .
As to the washerwoman pawning the clothes , and coming in a state of penitent intoxication to apologize , I suppose that might have happened several times to anybody .
He means plain <NAME> , <NAME> -- <NAME> -- Josh .
More striking still was some indefinable resemblance , in the face of <NAME> , to both .
' I am , sir , ' replied <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> had laid the child down on his own bed , and her head had gradually fallen on the pillow beside her pretty charge .
No child could have surpassed <NAME> in inexperience of everything but wind and weather ; in simplicity , credulity , and generous trustfulness .
Why , applause from the house when you first come on .
Ride on over all obstacles , and win the race ! ' ' And win what race ? ' said I .
<NAME> ' t be too proud to come and see us , when you have made your fortune. ' ' All right ! ' said <NAME> , and went .
Yet that would be energy. ' ' Precisely my view of the case , <NAME> .
'You may depend upon me , young man , ' answered <NAME> , bowing himself gradually towards the ladder , with excessive politeness .
' For the " How " I come to you .
So she was -- so she was. ' ' And our friend was soothing her anguish , ' said <NAME> , rather maliciously .
' <NAME> , sir , ' repeated the gentleman haughtily .
That he had his reasons for this , he knew full well .
That he himself had several times ' reckoned up ' <NAME> , but had never been able to bring him to a satisfactory criminal total .
His luck ' s got fouled under the keels of the barges .
He may not deserve it , for we know no certain ill of him .
We found that a steamer for <NAME> was likely to suit our purpose best , and we directed our thoughts chiefly to that vessel .
He walked on , and she did not appear to hear his steps until he was close upon her .
' I am sure I am glad to hear it , but I don ' t know how. ' ' Pitching somebody into a mud-cart , ' said <NAME> .
Then do the swains appear with tea , with lemonade , with sandwiches , with homage .
Then they repaired to the usual family room , to receive <NAME> with a becoming show of indifference .
Mr Plornish could not conceal his exultation in her accomplishments as a linguist .
None of them ever pay .
<NAME> , far more fully than the <NAME> Newsman ever did , a <NAME> ' s Party , given by <NAME> at his Lodgings in the Borough 33 .
' You have thrown yourself away , ' said <NAME> , shaking his head .
' I am unhappily a widower , ' said I .
' You know this gentleman , I believe ? ' I made my gentleman a distant bow , and <NAME> barely recognized him .
Brooding over the fire , with his dried little head in his dried little hands , and his dried little elbows on his dried little knees , <NAME> is melancholy .
I said , ' Near <NAME> , ' which was all I knew .
The old house had been long ago pulled down , and a fine broad road was in its place .
I make a respectable income by it .
' But I don ' t know your ' n. ' ' That ' s quite another thing , ' said <NAME> .
I was not aware that anything was wrong .
Suddenly the door was unlocked on the inside , and flung violently open .
The lamps across his streets had a portentously elastic swing with them .
And as to being common , I do n't make it out at all clear .
' Are you better now , mother ? ' asked one of the women .
Supported only by a sense that she was bent on conquering in her life-long fight , she went on .
But Mr <NAME> shook his head , and wouldn ' t hear of that being possible .
<NAME> ' ever , none on ' em answered ; so they gave out that he ' d run away , and she kep ' on the bis ' ness .
He had never conceived an aversion to her : it had not been worth his while or in his humour .
He ' s as like his Papa as he can be .
There was no divided responsibility now ; the whole burden of their two lives had fallen upon her , and henceforth she must think and act for both .
' No , my dear , no , not an atom from anybody ' s hand but mine if you please .
I looked at her , but I could not see her , I could not hear her , I could not draw my breath .
But that you have been trying me , and tampering with me , I am now sure .
Widows , gentlemen , are not usually timorous , as my uncle used to say .
I am ashamed to seem so selfish , but I don ' t really mean it .
' You ' ll have as much as I shall .
I thus became aware of the mutual relations between them and <NAME> , which were exemplified in the following manner .
' Oh I ' ve run such a way after you ! ' ' What do you want with me ? ' said Mr Abel .
A rap at the door startled him in this occupation .
' Do you know that person ' s name ? ' he inquired of the man in an audible voice ; pointing out <NAME> as he put the question .
He had made one step towards it , before he checked himself .
I am certain that you do n't forget by what a noble character , <NAME> .
She often moralized over her work on the tricks and the manners of that venerable cheat , but made her little purchases elsewhere , and lived a secluded life .
We ' re positively getting on , you know .
<NAME> would only say then , that he repelled the hon .
' Coolish ! ' observed <NAME> , stirring the fire .
If I were not dumb , you would be deaf .
Many and many a time had my fingers longed to tear him .
'Then you return my love ? '
So , whether he lives or dies , what does it come to ?
This reminds me that I have not been able to do so , and that I sometimes almost despair of ever being able to do so .
He spoke of it more than once on the remainder of the way home , and more than once when they got home .
Mrs <NAME> had kept watch and ward over little <NAME> and his sister for nearly twelve months .
But , somehow , it had all failed .
It seemed , too , that <NAME> and <NAME> had gone out upon a visit in the neighbourhood , and would not return before night .
My wonder is , that you are not in earnest yourself , by this time , Agnes. ' <NAME> laughed again , and shook her head .
Her strength held out to enable her to arrange the letter in her breast , so as that it could be seen that she had a paper there .
That 's my view of such things , speaking as a child ! "
' You ' re quite a stranger ! ' ' Yes .
' Why , <NAME> ! ' she added with astonishment , seeing him first .
All regret will be unavailing , and deep and bitter it must be .
In all these movements he was closely followed by the eyes of <NAME> , as if that young gentleman expected to see the thorn in action .
He is intent upon various new expenses , -- horses , and carriages , and lavish appearances of all kinds .
' No offence , sir , ' said <NAME> , humbly .
Many a time I 've heard my old fellow-serjeant of that name ; and a moderate man he was in all respects , as ever I come across ! "
" Did you hear me ask you where you have come from ? "
<NAME> there nobody else to come ? ' ' I beg your pardon , <NAME> , ' returned <NAME> .
<NAME> 's niece 's sisters , and all the other ladies , expressed the same opinion .
This is indeed an acquisition .
It ' s much better he shouldn ' t come to-night. ' The schoolmaster lighted a candle , fastened the window-shutter , and closed the door .
You observe that I say , I suppose .
He pushed against the garden-gate ; it was unlocked , and swung open on its hinges .
He made the cottage smaller than it need have been , by being so very much out of proportion to it .
Is that the reason , aunt ? ' ' <NAME> , ' said the lady , ' but not all .
Then I would make a fact so disgraceful known , and boldly challenge society to set it right .
' <NAME> ' t be hard upon him , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
You were talking of tampering , just now .
They are both written in good faith , I have no doubt , and without any collusion .
And all in the house did the same .
But what -- hey ? -- Lord forgive us ! -- Mrs <NAME> muttered some ejaculation to this effect , and turned giddy .
It was a very small establishment , wherein a decent woman sat behind the counter working at her needle .
And I hope that he may find it " -- <NAME> again looks grave -- " to his satisfaction . "
Their <NAME> bonnets , ornamented with plumes of jet black feathers , Mr <NAME> carried on his instrument .
I think I observed , myself , that it was highly creditable to all concerned .
' Very sorry ! ' said the furious magistrate .
Some man fell in with a splash , and was pulled out again with a roar of laughter .
Anyways we will hope so now .
The noble lady ' s condition on these delightful occasions was one compounded of heroic endurance and heroic forgiveness .
' No , my dear , ' replied the collector , ' no .
" So , as I happen to be in the habit of coming about your premises , you take me into your confidence , do n't you ? "
He ' s what you may call a rasper , is <NAME> .
We pushed off again , and made what way we could .
The account is now favourably balanced : my creditor has accepted a composition .
I see you there a many times , as plain as ever I see you on them misty marshes .
and the bedpost was his own .
Her colour came and went once more ; and once more , as she bent her head , I saw the same sad smile .
I thought of our house shut up and hushed .
' It ' s me -- Short ' -- a voice called through the keyhole .
There was a pair of trousers there .
What happiness was ours that day , what joy , what rest , what hope , what gratitude , what bliss !
The company had departed for another town more than twenty miles off , and had opened there last night .
He observed us with a genial interest , but there seemed , if I may venture on such a contradiction , nothing selfish in it .
" Thank you , sir , I am sure , " returns the stationer with his cough of deference .
The Evening of a <NAME> Day 25 .
" But nothing that might not be sent to a pattern young lady ? "
' Come away for tonight ! ' ' I will not , by G -- , ' he replied .
<NAME> is the best policy. -- I always find it so myself .
I _do_ understand you before you pint it out .
" Good day , madame , " said the new-comer .
And <NAME> ( you good little Pa ) , you don ' t take milk .
<NAME> him , when he theeth our horthe begin to danthe , not to be afraid of being thpilt , but to look out for a pony-gig coming up .
One reflection disturbed him far more than any selfish considerations arising out of his own position .
I am sure you know me better .
Agnes and hospitality prevailed , however , and I conducted him to my fireside .
Having closed the door , to prevent being overheard , he sank into a chair , and said , in a low voice -- ' " Hush !
<NAME> cries of ' Shame , ' mingled with groans and hisses , prevailed for a quarter of an hour .
But she soon cheered up , and we did wonders with it before we went to bed .
Oh , look at it , look at it !
And I said yes , and she said she knew only one or two places about here , but had lost her way and could n't find them .
' I , with poor father ' s grave not even cleared of undeserved stain and shame , and he trying to clear it for me !
Given out on the Wednesday night at eight o'clock , brought in on the Thursday morning at half after nine . "
He tries this , swings it , poises it , and lays it by , with the knapsack , on a window-seat .
From a very early age I have detected what those about me thought they hid from me .
' <NAME> , ' said the old gentleman ; ' it was not your fault that he fell in love with you , I suppose ?
' All of a sudden the coach stopped .
'If you are in poverty or affliction I shall be truly glad to relieve you if I can , -- I shall indeed .
The <NAME> was sitting in his easy-chair by the fireside , and his young wife was on a stool at his feet .
The poorest women fall back , as I make my way along the crowded pavement . '
' We have been quarrelling here a little , Mr Rokesmith , but not more than we used ; you know our agreeable ways among ourselves .
It was evident that something of great importance was in contemplation , but what that something was , not even Mrs. <NAME> had been enabled to discover .
To Mr <NAME> , in confidence , did Mrs <NAME> impart what she had known of the state of his wife ' s affections , in his reckless time .
You are shocked , I dare say !
The remainder of the party ( half-a-dozen perhaps ) turned , and went back at a great rate .
' Him ! ' said the little fellow .
She was in great agitation .
' Played together. ' ' Does she know your son as her admirer ? ' ' Oh !
<NAME> <NAME> , take an observation of your nevy. ' Following with his eyes the majestic action of the <NAME> ' s hook , the old man looked at <NAME> .
I have another motive in coming : a motive of humanity .
<NAME> delivered himself up to the authorities , _but changed his mind and escaped_ ! ' ' _Personal Encounter_ .
I 've got the upper hand over you , <NAME> ; and , d -- me , I 'll keep it .
' Not such a one as this , <NAME> wouldn ' t have liked , ' said <NAME> .
Indeed I don ' t reproach you .
Because her faults have been intensified by her place in my father ' s will , and she is already growing better .
' You have sat me by your fire ; you have given me food and money ; you have bestowed your compassion on me !
Would it not have been better for his peace that I should not have been so brought before him ?
But I suppose you ' re too busy pocketing the ready money , to think of the debtors , eh ?
" <NAME> is a young lady who deeply respects you , and our first desire is to consider your comfort . "
As the man rising from the deep would disappear the sooner for fighting with the water , so he in his desperate struggle went down again .
' And they take no care of their clothes , and they never keep to the same fashions a month .
He stored my mind with its first treasures , and stamped his character upon them all .
' It was the salmon. ' ( Somehow or other , it never is the wine , in these cases . )
He wore a loose black silk handkerchief round his neck , and such a very large coarse shirt collar , that it looked like a small sail .
' Have a roast fowl , ' said <NAME> , ' with a bit of weal stuffing and some egg sauce .
'But I will tell you , ' retorted <NAME> .
No line was indicated by any contrivance , but she wrote straight and freely .
I wish she was -- How have you been , <NAME> ? ' ' Ah !
They were <NAME> and <NAME> .
" My advice to you , " returns Mrs. Bagnet , " is to light your pipe and tingle that way .
I ' m a little hunchy villain and a monster , am I , <NAME> ?
Upon which door the turnkey knocked with the handle of his key .
I have been prescribed bark , but I don ' t take it , for I don ' t wish to have any tone whatever given to my constitution .
They need to charge for dooble-latthers .
' And to nothing else. ' They stood looking at each other ; <NAME> ' s face as white as the pursuer ' s .
' Well , I never ! ' ejaculated the cook .
' Oh not that disagreeable name , say Flora ! ' ' Flora , is it worth troubling yourself afresh to enter into explanations ?
And not silly ? ' said my aunt .
' A dependence upon him , ' said <NAME> , ' would embitter my whole life .
They were painted , I think , by the artist who had touched up the <NAME> doors with red and gold ; for I seemed to recognise his style immediately .
There was no other question that I knew of in the world , and only <NAME> could give the answer to it .
' Of course I did , ' said my aunt , ' and was therefore easily silenced .
<NAME> ' t you know she has ?
It does as well as anything else , for a time .
It was soon done , and the gate of the <NAME> ' <NAME> closed upon them .
How ' s that ? ' ' I supposed he had come home , ' Pleasant explained .
The handsome lady -- so like , oh so like ! -- regarded me with a fixed look , and put her hand to her forehead .
The conversation was here interrupted by a moan from the sick woman .
" What do you come snivelling here for ? " " I did n't go to do it , <NAME> Wemmick. " " You did , " said <NAME> .
You ' re casting your eye round the shop , Mr Wegg .
' Wot ' s that for , <NAME> ? ' inquired <NAME> , directing <NAME> ' s attention to the target in question .
That she couldn ' t help it .
Have I a friend here ?
Four hims and a her .
I was such a silly little creature !
I was a ' most as well as I was .
Mr <NAME> was resolved to show her that he was supreme .
Mr Carker the <NAME> drew a chair close before the fire , and fell to beating the coals softly with the poker .
You may wonder at my saying this so confidently with so little knowledge or experience , but I know it for a certainty from my own heart .
How you start ! " She did , indeed , start .
While I had been away from home lately , <NAME> had called twice or thrice .
Gentlemen , our friend <NAME> ( everybody looked at the individual in orange ) , our friend <NAME> has resigned. ' Universal astonishment fell upon the hearers .
In this same church , the pretty boy received all that will soon be left of him on earth -- a name .
There had been shrieks from among the women convicts ; but they had been stilled , and a hush had succeeded .
' A curse upon you ! ' she said , looking round at me , with a mingled expression of rage and grief .
' I am sorry to say , <NAME> , I can ' t advance your object , ' said <NAME> , nervously .
And I ' ll tell you why , <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> seats himself upon another .
The only article in which <NAME> dealt , that was not hard , was gingerbread .
<NAME> had known it , and seen it , without looking at her .
My <NAME> has been down at what she calls , in familiar conversation , her " place " in <NAME> .
The room smelt close and unwholesome ; the walls were dirt-discoloured ; and the ceiling blackened .
That ' s going according to the <NAME> , that is. ' ' Mr .
' You ' re thinking of a capital F perhaps ? ' said the <NAME> .
said I , pretending to consider .
' Come here , sir ! ' said <NAME> , beckoning to me .
You ' ve got half the property , haven ' t you ? ' ' Yes , yes. ' ' Well then , don ' t you be cowed .
<NAME> ' en name , <NAME> sim ' lar to <NAME> which is my own .
It may be that if we knew more of such strange afflictions we might be the better able to alleviate their intensity .
<NAME> ' r is a lad as ' ll go through a deal o ' hard weather .
'Ai n't you afraid of it , sir ?
Ever forgiving and ever affable .
She could have stabbed him -- poisoned him safely .
Now you shall fasten it on yourself , for good luck , if you will , <NAME> . "
To become a Guppy is the object of his ambition .
Would the lady object to my lighting the pair of candles on the chimneypiece , to throw a further light upon the subject ?
' Good evening , godmother ! ' said <NAME> .
' Have a bit. ' ' I couldn ' t eat a morsel , ' replied his wife .
' <NAME> him about the <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
And I considered whether , if it should signify any one of these meanings , which was so very likely , could I quite answer for myself ?
Remember them last races , Tommy. ' ' Will you never leave off aggravating a man ? ' said <NAME> .
" But how much would you tell him , <NAME> ? " " It is necessary to tell him very little .
' They wanted all the happiness to come together .
But that you have gathered already ?
After which , appears <NAME> ( whom <NAME> has seen twice in his lifetime ) , to thank <NAME> for counterfeiting the late <NAME> , broadly of <NAME> .
' His residence -- ' ' Is at present at the Angel at Bury. ' ' At <NAME> ? ' ' At <NAME> , not many miles from here .
' I speak to you for the sake of others .
He said to me , " <NAME> up to the top of the house , sir , and I ' ll show you a handsome girl .
' It was a vain threat. ' We drove away , out of town , to the churchyard at <NAME> .
At this the two innocents , with their brains in that apparent danger , laughed , and <NAME> laughed , and the orphan laughed , and then the visitors laughed .
So cold , so lonely , so dreary all !
I am not so unconscionable as to think it likely that you would accept me on trust at first sight , and take me out of the very street .
The continued kindness of her sister was this comfort to <NAME> .
They always praised the child , her sense and beauty , and he was proud to hear them !
' <NAME> and submissively , ' returned the tragedian , scowling upwards .
Slouching at his side with his eyes upon the towing-path , <NAME> held his left hand open , with a certain slight drawing action towards himself .
' Naturally , <NAME> , you know. ' ' Oh-h ! ' said <NAME> , with a severely unconvinced look .
Confine yourself to yours , and ask me no question. ' ' By <NAME> , ma ' am ! ' he replied , making her another bow .
I acquiesced , of course , knowing nothing to the contrary .
You don ' t know what my state of mind towards you is .
" Lift him , and come away ! " The door closed , and <NAME> was left alone .
It rushed away where it would , but it never , for an instant , lost itself in sleep .
All that I know is , your philosophy and your teaching will not save me .
' My master , sir , is a very artful man. ' ' I know he is , ' said <NAME> .
'It must have been something , love , ' urged <NAME> .
<NAME> made no reply , but played a little quicker , as though the words had roused her from some painful thoughts .
Has a small crop out of his left ear. ' ' Ran away , a negro man , named <NAME> .
' There ' s where she sits , you see , ' said <NAME> , when they were standing under the bank , roared and riven at by the wind .
Whenever I fell into a thoughtful state , this subject was sure to present itself , and all my uneasiness was sure to be redoubled .
said he with his bright clear eyes on mine .
' You have much too open and generous a countenance for that. ' ' What an extraordinary observer you are ! ' said <NAME> .
I can not rest until I know that we are not too late .
says <NAME> , transferring his cross-examination .
' Of course you do , ' retorted the dwarf , viciously snapping at his words .
It ' s his system. ' ' Formed his daughter on his own model ? ' suggested <NAME> .
But then , you see , you 're broad in proportion and do n't look it .
' Amen to that , ' replied <NAME> , ' and a fat and happy liven ' they ' d get out of it !
Apart from any inclinations of my own , I understood <NAME> 's hint now .
She closed the window again , and sitting down upon the bed , thought of the life that was before them .
The Captain never lost dignity , from having his ears boxed with the <NAME> .
" Whew ! " the chemist whistled softly , as he read it .
As if I were never to have done with <NAME> , I am reminded here of <NAME> and old <NAME> .
' Always at home. ' This would seem to be secretly agreeable to <NAME> , but he veils his feelings , and observes , ' Strange .
I am not speaking to you politely ; but , as you are aware , I am _not_ polite .
' She will try to do well , ' said little Em ' ly .
<NAME> , was that you calling me ?
' -- that I will make no pretence of concealment .
' But I doubt if he could tell many people even their past or present fortunes. ' ' Couldn ' t have told the <NAME> hers ? ' said <NAME> .
I could hardly make them quarrel with me .
The second , that her brother had not made an effort .
said the undertaker : raising the candle above his head , to get a better view of <NAME> .
But there was no confusion or disorder .
' He and she ? ' ' What , Mr and <NAME> ? ' said <NAME> .
Very few loose papers are about .
On the next day , fresh search was made , and the inquiries renewed ; but with no better success .
<NAME> <NAME> ' s first procedure was to shake Mrs. Sparsit off , and leave her to progress as she might through various stages of suffering on the floor .
because he suffered her to lead him .
The ironmaster repeats her expression with a little emphasis .
He swallowed a glassful and took up the paper again .
They would have scorned the action .
' This will soon be over now , dear Mr Clennam .
To be sure , how the neighbourhood poured into court that afternoon while the cause was on !
Another knock , and still no answer .
The walls were ornamented with the choicest specimens of <NAME> paper , enriched with a gilded cornice of elegant design .
Allow me to catch you round the neck .
This position I continued to occupy during the whole interview , and from it I now saw <NAME> and <NAME> enter the room .
The schoolmeasther agin all <NAME> .
I knew his voice very well .
But <NAME> said she was , and she said it decisively .
Nod away at him , <NAME> ; that 's what he likes .
" My own doing , " said <NAME> .
Wipe your eyes with the cuffs of your jacket , and do n't cry into your gruel ; that 's a very foolish action , <NAME> . '
You can come at night .
It was unnecessary caution surely , and might have defeated itself .
The deficient buttons on his plaid frock had evidently been supplied from one of <NAME> 's coats , they were so extremely brazen and so much too large .
<NAME> C. desires to be near his professional adviser , and I am far from objecting , for I court inquiry . "
<NAME> 's vigorous plunges against the bit of timber in question , rendered this occurance highly probable .
' What will you do ? ' she asked him .
But all is over with me on earth , and this must be an Angel .
All is for her sake .
He found a pleasure in setting up <NAME> as the type of elegance , and making him a satire upon others who piqued themselves on personal graces .
And <NAME> , " said <NAME> , " and his wild brother , <NAME> ; there they go !
I know my cue ; smart is the word .
A few faces hurried to glowing windows and looked after us , but none came out .
He has no idea of the value of money .
The simple circumstance of being left alone with her husband and <NAME> , was sufficient to stun this admirable lady again without collision between herself and any other fact .
We never make company of you .
In the miserable night he thought of it ; in the dreary day , the wretched dawn , the ghostly , memory-haunted twilight .
' The usual thing ! ' observed <NAME> .
' You won ' t run so gaily to your old shabby home , my girl .
But he was sleeping soundly , and she softly withdrew .
'What the devil made you stand lingering there , in the wet ? '
' I hope they may become so , ' replied <NAME> .
He made quite a sister of me .
This wretched life , my love , of daily labour and fatigue , is more than you can bear , I am sure it is .
<NAME> farewells were exchanged , and the party separated .
I had often passed it before , during my residence in that neighbourhood , though never when I could choose another road .
It was very extraordinary that she should come , under such circumstances. ' Not feeling quite so sure of that , <NAME> thought it best to hold his peace .
I have often thought , since , what an odd , innocent , out-of-the-way kind of wedding it must have been !
The lady happened to bend forward at the same time , and my uncle thought she looked more beautiful than she had done yet .
" It would be useless self-distress and torment to reckon up such chances and possibilities .
You know what I mean as well as any man . "
He then gravely repaired to another table , where his sister sat herself at her desk .
I am sure you would ! ' said <NAME> .
" It was a great change from <NAME> Swosser to Professor Dingo , " she resumed with a plaintive smile .
There is a tie of many suffering years between us two , and it is the only tie I ever had on earth that <NAME> has not broken ! "
' Now , <NAME> , ' says the Major , ' I am a man of the world .
' Have you anything to tell me ? ' ' To tell you , lady lass ! ' replied the <NAME> , meeting her eyes in confusion .
' Well , and how are you my buck ? ' said Mr Chuckster , taking a stool .
<NAME> <NAME> , however , was announced as a lesser star , yet visible above the office horizon .
I lost everything , and had a sharp struggle for my life , weak as I was. ' ' Did you get the parties punished ? ' asked <NAME> .
<NAME> was there , and in full force .
' Ho ! ' Horses plunge , and splash the black driver .
Also , the spoon is not generally used over-hand , but under .
I have told her so .
Speak. ' ' Why , if you will have it , miss , it ' s this , ' said the servant girl .
He is going towards the door with a candle in his hand when a knock comes .
The quarters of our soldiers at <NAME> , are finely and airily situated .
'Pop that shawl away in my castor , <NAME> , so that I may know where to find it when I cut ; that 's the time of day !
And <NAME> , M.P. , how are things going on down at the house , and when will you turn out those terrible people for us ?
' This , at least , is the light , my dear <NAME> , ' pursued Mrs. Micawber , ' in which I view the subject .
I will hear no more of the very genteel lady ; I will hear no more of you .
No , but she knew where the school was .
It ain ' t because I don ' t love you .

At last I find it .
' Never in my life , ' replied the cobbler .
I owe so much to him .
And now I can breathe again at last ! ' <NAME> darted in from behind the door , caught <NAME> by both hands , and said the rest for himself .

" She says many hard things of you , but you say nothing of her .
The greater the accumulation of deceit and trouble in the world , the brighter and the purer shone the star of <NAME> high above the world .
At the garden-gate of one of these he stopped , and <NAME> alighted .
" You 're a friend in need .
think of all I have given up , only this one night , for you .
Where ' s your more than mother ?
We sat in the dark for some time , breathless .
Who knows that better than I do ? ' ' Nothing will turn me from it , <NAME> , when I have justified it to myself .
And how shows this recreant conduct in a man on whom unequal laws are known to have fallen heavy ?
Without entering into further explanations , I may repeat that the idol is down .
<NAME> ' t ask how ; -- we may regain it , and a great deal more ; -- but tell nobody , or trouble may come of it .
' Do you recollect anything particular happening on the morning when you were first engaged by the defendant ; eh , <NAME> ? ' said <NAME> .
' You are very kind , ' said <NAME> , ' I shall be delighted to know them .
I must clear my unfortunate partner ' s reputation .
I ha ' seen an ' spok ' n wi ' yor son , one night .
The sea had ebbed and flowed , through a whole year .
' Why , will it never stop , <NAME> ? ' he would sometimes ask her .
' I have noticed , ' said he ; ' —my name is Tartar. ' <NAME> inclined his head .
Does the thought-contracted brow of the local Sage or the lustrous eye of local Beauty inquire whose fortunes ?
Shall I tell them to go away ? ' ' No , ' said <NAME> , rising .
I have never been in the way of learning compliments myself , and I don ' t profess to understand the art of paying ' em .
' You can easily have been kept away by business , and must not return till nearly midnight. ' ' Then he will come straight here , ' retorted <NAME> .
Show what clothes you have brought , and what money , and say that I will send some more money .
<NAME> <NAME> Jasper. ' ' Has he a calling , good gentleman ? ' ' Calling ?
The sound was too much for Mr Mantalini .
" I tell you , " said <NAME> , " that you buried paving-stones and earth in that there coffin .
' This is a pollis case , is it ?
It gave you the face-ache to look at his apples , the stomach-ache to look at his oranges , the tooth-ache to look at his nuts .
For who else would dig , and delve , and drudge , and do domestic work , and make canals and roads , and execute great lines of <NAME> !
" Oh , <NAME> , you would never guess ! "
It ' s no use my lagging on so far behind it .
To which Mrs <NAME> added , taking thought for him , like the championing little wife she was ; ' Oh yes , detained at the last moment .
To whom <NAME> made his obeisance , closing the door and standing near it , with his hat in his hand .
My uncle woke , rubbed his eyes , and jumped up in astonishment .
I should rather think I did .
" Indeed I am , my Lady .
After some helpless casting about , <NAME> brightened and began again : -- " He is dressed like a 'spectable pieman .
How CAN you ask such goose ' s questions ? ' ' Do you regret anything , my love ? ' ' <NAME> anything ?
<NAME> haste down , and come out .
We began badly , and went on worse .
I took the indentures out of his hand and gave them to <NAME> .
I went forth last night on compulsion , and I learnt a lesson which is working now .
The <NAME> sat in his study chair , covering his face with his hands .
We proceeded without a word being spoken .
I never see such a chap to eat and drink -- never .
" Yes , there ! " " Where is he ? " He crammed what little food was left , into the breast of his gray jacket .
' Well then , ' replied <NAME> , ' I ' m satisfied .
He was dressed in a smartly-cut snuff-coloured coat , with large brass buttons ; an orange neckerchief ; a coarse , staring , shawl-pattern waistcoat ; and drab breeches .
' By <NAME> , you are right , <NAME> .
Will you mind it , if I say something very , very silly ? -- -more than usual ? ' inquired <NAME> , peeping over my shoulder into my face .
" When she went from here , she went right away nor'ard by the high road .
<NAME> blood , hot blood. ' And the little man took a warning pinch , and shook his head doubtfully .
The girl drew closer to the table , and made no offer to leave the room , although she could see that <NAME> was pointing to her .
' I would rather not ask , but the question is imposed upon me .
I put such questions to <NAME> as , When did the man come in ?
All men are not gifted alike .
' No , indeed , ' returned his daughter .
' Who is it ? ' asked <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> looked serious instantly .
<NAME> will be a ugly customer to you , if you do n't .
That 's all I know , ' said <NAME> .
' -- K. then positively refused to sign .
' No , sir , ' said Mr Meagles , shaking his head ruefully .
No ; sight more unwonted still -- there is a butterfly in the square -- a real , live butterfly !
If not today , why then tomorrow. ' ' And <NAME> ? ' said <NAME> and I , both together .
' And yet you took it very much to heart , ' said <NAME> .
" It is fifty years old . "
He has taken the matter so much to heart that he has remonstrated ( in my presence he remonstrated ) with Mr <NAME> , if that be the name .
'No , ' replied <NAME> ; 'at least , as it 's a nasty business , we think you ought to take something less than the premium we offered . '
You ought to see it out , and I won ' t leave you .
<NAME> <NAME> alone could enter into my feelings thoroughly .
<NAME> ! ' exclaimed the old lady , starting .
When I looked round , I could see the other lights coming in after us .
It was -- what lasting reason have I to remember it ! -- a cold , harsh , winter day .
It shall and must be spoken .
' Ah ! ' replied <NAME> , with another groan ; this time not even disguised by a wheeze .
she said on a sudden .
The Secretary lost no time in getting to work , and his vigilance and method soon set their mark on the <NAME> ' s affairs .
It would be a poor thing to gratify a prejudice against him .
Defer this marriage for a week .
I would transact your business with people in your pay or employment .
I reply , 'My growling friend , I DO N'T defend them , but they are very agreeable to me .
' And what is your name , my pale child ? ' said <NAME> .
Would Mr Abel part with me , <NAME> , or is there anybody that could be fonder of the garden , ma ' am ?
' Pray , go on , sir -- disgraceful and rascally proceedings , I think you said ? ' ' I did , ' said <NAME> , thoroughly roused .
As they turned back , <NAME> ' s eye fell upon a small broken stone , partially buried in the ground , in front of a cottage door .
A <NAME> ( assisted by a <NAME> ) married the happy pair , and it behoved <NAME> himself to conduct <NAME> to breakfast .
Mr and <NAME> ' s house in <NAME> , <NAME> , was but a temporary residence .
I am glad to think I have been the instrument of good to <NAME> , and that I may be more so .
I half expect the real master to come home presently , and say he is glad to see me .
" What is to be done with you ?
You know Lagnier , the gentleman .
You are to understand that his second visit to <NAME> was for his own pleasure .
This sound being taken up by the <NAME> , swelled into a rapturous trio which gave general satisfaction .
" My friend in the city , <NAME> , has done a little business with a pupil of yours . "
" I beg your pardon , grandmother .
He is a child -- an absolute child .
My guardian asked him what he meant .
I wish you good night , sir. ' He comprehended everybody present , in the respectful bow with which he followed these words , and disappeared .
' I give you joy , Mr Toots ! ' says old Sol .
Unnatural emotion in a child , innocent of wrong !
<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> divide the dignity of the office .
I was at that time in our <NAME> <NAME> , and had been -- oh !
A considerable scuffling within ensued , but nothing else .
' My sweetest Edith ! ' cries an agitated voice upon the stairs .
Its deep fidelity and goodness were not to be adorned by me or any man .
" I want five hundred pound . "
' Is there room for me ? ' said I .
I see you are going back to it , ' returned <NAME> , wondering why .
Ally Loo ! ' Horses almost do it .
I am a honest man , that ' s what I am .
Can I be so weak as to imagine that <NAME> , wielding the rod of talent and of power in <NAME> , will be nothing in <NAME> ?
' <NAME> is your ward ? ' asked <NAME> , after a time , in a faint , fatigued voice .
<NAME> would bring Emily at the usual hour .
' It is but one room you see .
' Coketown , sir , ' said <NAME> , obstinately taking a chair , ' is not the kind of place you have been accustomed to .
By the powerful old gentleman ' s aid , even a hackney-coach gets over half a mile of ground .
' You know I have had losses , and am poorer than I used to be .
<NAME> given to detail are the beggars who make sporting ventures .
I should require to be crammed , sir. ' ' I beg your pardon , ' interposed <NAME> , doubtful whether he had heard aright .
Here is a glass of mulled wine ready to our hand at the moment ; and I say , 'Uncle <NAME> ! ' "
He never misses a chance in his practice , which is a mark of respectability .
" My landlord , <NAME> , " said the little old lady , condescending to him from her lofty station as she presented him to us .
They were close upon our heels ; every man for himself , and each from the gallows !
The two sons grew up as parsimonious as their sire .
Then why are we here , my friends ?
We must make amends for this as soon as we can .
He found a likeness to his misfortune everywhere .
You are a credit to the school , and you will be a greater credit to it yet , and they will help you to get a living .
<NAME> ' s letter had gone , <NAME> ' s letter had been delivered .
' I thought our good friend a little changed , and out of spirits , after he came this morning ? ' said <NAME> .
But she never could , and she never did , find a phrase satisfactory to her perhaps-too-favourable estimate of my intellect .
' I have communicated , both personally and by letter , with the club , ' resumed <NAME> , ' acquainting them with my intention .
Those who had been kind to them , did not escape his search .
He stops hard by <NAME> and reads a playbill , decides to go to <NAME> 's Theatre .
' Do you see him here now ? ' said the judge .
Behold him in pepper-and-salt pantaloons , with his watch-guard round his neck .
' This is it , ain ' t it ? ' ' Let me look , ' said <NAME> .
' What next ? ' The breakfast table at Mr <NAME> ' s was usually a very pleasant one , and was always presided over by <NAME> .
' Say he dreamt it , ' replied <NAME> coolly .
'Juries , ' said <NAME> , grasping his cane tightly , as was his wont when working into a passion : 'juries is ineddicated , vulgar , grovelling wretches . '
I ' d do more by you than the rest of ' em do , I fancy. ' ' What would you do ? ' he asked .
'Fill this glass again , ' he said , handing <NAME> 's empty tumbler to the landlord .
" You may read it in the whole room .
Remarkable documents , ' added the lawyer , raising his eyes to the ceiling , ' most remarkable documents .
There is a light in each .
'Work'us , ' said <NAME> , 'how 's your mother ? '
Whatever Mrs. <NAME> said , <NAME> repeated to us ; and just as he had drawn Mrs. Jellyby out , he drew Mrs. Pardiggle out .
Not that any one did , for Veneering , M.P. , was always the authority for their being very rich , and perhaps believed it .
It began to rain , heavily , at the moment .
' With <NAME> and his lady , I mean to say , <NAME> , and the young gentleman .
That part of the world is at a safe distance. ' ' Say here , then , ' rejoins the other , rising in a fury .
He was quick enough to observe ; he had a good memory , and did not forget a word of the brother ' s revelations .
For I was so little inclined to sleep myself that night that I sat up working .
Then , as I looked up at it , while it dripped , it seemed to my oppressed conscience like a phantom devoting me to the <NAME> .
He stops there , looks round , and beckons Jo .
" Now , mademoiselle , " repeats <NAME> , making no demonstration except with the finger , " you sit down upon that sofy . "
I could feel the muscles of the thin arm round my neck swell with the vehemence that possessed her .
This was only for a moment ; for <NAME> softly said to him , ' <NAME> !
He was on his way to dig some one out of a grave .
After a brief reflection , he called a hack-cabriolet , and bade the man drive towards <NAME> .
Shall we go away that morning , and stay in <NAME> until we go on board at <NAME> within a week ? ' ' If you please , <NAME> .
The sisterhood , the maidens , flocking round the young waterman , and urging him along the stream of duty and of temperance .
She had been to the theayter .
I am a very little boy , sir ; and it is so -- so -- ' 'So what ? '
On these occasions , <NAME> was knocked up by the policeman at a quarter before three in the morning , and rarely such before twelve o ' clock next night .
So the little crazy lodger goes for the beadle , and the rest come out of the room .
He mentioned to me as a secret , that he is courting a young lady who has , as no doubt you are aware , a bedridden Pa .
I can not breathe it. ' ' We have breathed it together , for a long time , ' said the old man .
Patches of poor rye where corn should have been , patches of poor peas and beans , patches of most coarse vegetable substitutes for wheat .
The church-clocks will strike the hours just the same , <NAME> , and the night will pass away just the same .
' And how did you know I was here ? ' inquired <NAME> .
It is not in my power , or in the power of my brother Ned , to save you from the consequences .
It was a rimy morning , and very damp .
' Thou and I are free of it now , <NAME> .
Do not leave us ! ' The child dropped her head , and put her hands before her face .
They let him have his wish ; and indeed he kept his word , and was , in his childish way , a lesson to them all .
You do see him , and mind you , it ai n't every one as is admitted to that honour .
' But can ' t we have one last night more ? ' ' Not an hour -- not a minute , ' replied <NAME> , impatiently .
The communication performed its errand so well , that within ten minutes of the messenger ' s return and report of its delivery , <NAME> herself was announced .
Pressed to fall back upon a nominative case , he opined that they wos about as red as ever red could be .
He turned over the leaves .
' I shall be glad to see it again , I don ' t deny , <NAME> , ' said the <NAME> .
" By the cathedral door , " said <NAME> .
' His dog Lion. ' Little Dorrit ' s hand was in his , as he spoke .
' My dearest <NAME> , ' replied Mr Toots , ' do , do , if you possibly can , remember the medical man !
By resolving not to set right the wrong he did you .
The old man had gained the street corner , before he began to recover the effect of <NAME> 's intelligence .
But not because I repent of what I have said to you .
When it was given him , he drank his <NAME> 's health and compliments of the season , and took it all at a mouthful and smacked his lips .
The sky had partly cleared , but was very gloomy -- even above us , where a few stars were shining .
Let me wet your lips again , and your forehead .
And looking up , he sees the clerk looking down at him and marking him as he passes a lamp .
<NAME> said he was ready for anything .
' What was it that you asked me ?
All doubts upon the subject , if he had any , were speedily removed by the young lady 's behaviour .
With which the head disappeared , and the door closed .
You are everything to her. ' ' Am I ? ' returned <NAME> , shaking her head .
I glanced towards the centre of the room , where <NAME> 's lover , now engaged with single pupils , was undergoing greater drudgery than ever .
" But , " said he , " that is not to be remembered now . "
' All right , <NAME> ! ' said <NAME> , ' your thon may be aboard-a-thip by thith time .
This garment hung so loosely on the figure , that its capacious breast was bare , as if disdaining to be warded or concealed by any artifice .
He was a brown-faced sun-burnt man , and appeared browner and more sun-burnt from having a white nightcap on .
I owe it , alike to others , and to myself . '
' You must knock again , if you please. ' There ain ' t a bell , is there , ma ' am ? ' said the short chairman .
I have got other plans for this house .
' It never could have been bewitching , <NAME> .
Take hold of this cup and saucer , ostler .
YOUR name now will be -- " " <NAME> . "
' <NAME> , ' said a gentleman in spectacles , who had not yet spoken , ' you complained last week , my good fellow , of the cocoa .
" You seem to forget , " returned <NAME> , " that I ask you to say nothing and have no interest in anything you say . "
Besides which , all that I could have said of the Story to any purpose , I had endeavoured to say in it .
<NAME> <NAME> has joined your father ' s muster-roll .
' What a game girl you are , to be such a first-rate sister , <NAME> ! ' whispered <NAME> .
Has been my late childhood ?
" Have you got it here ? "
I looked in , and saw him a sitting lonely by his fire , brooding over it .
Instead of proceeding with any more anecdotes , as he had evidently intended but a moment before , he gave a short dry cough , and said , ' Well !
<NAME> with your hand , what means might I not find of advancing your interests and pushing your fortunes !
' And <NAME> ' s friend. ' ' Here is a note from her , entreating you to accede to the request of Mr Mortimer Lightwood , the bearer .
A flash in the pan or a shot ? "
I can keep this from <NAME> , only by buying him off .
" I believe so , " said <NAME> .
<NAME> looked after him , until he turned a corner of the road ; and then set forward on his walk to <NAME> .
We must push on again tomorrow , for we are not rich enough to loiter .
<NAME> departs in search of the iron gentleman , finds , and produces him .
Therefore I want to get him , for the present moment , into any poor lodging kept by decent people where he would be admitted .
There was a snap of cold , last week .
<NAME> , ' quoth the <NAME> , ' human justice may err , but it must act according to its lights .
At last I come to the sea .
" Do this look like a forge ? " replied <NAME> , sending his glance all round him with an air of injury .
" IS he after his time ? "
<NAME> then betook himself up-stairs , and the other magnates gradually floated up after him until there was no one left below but Mr Merdle .
It would be sentimental , perhaps ?
He began to have suspicions of the prisoner , and to keep an eye upon him , soon afterwards .
I have never told you , <NAME> , of her mother .
'He gets worse instead of better , I think , ' said the elder lady .
' No , <NAME> , no supper. ' ' You shall if you like , ' said <NAME> .
' I ' ll try hard , dear mother , now .
To the home of <NAME> ' s Uncle .
<NAME> ! ' But no <NAME> replied .
' Other things are all very well in their way , but give me <NAME> ! ' ' Oh !
If so , the answer was indefinite and vague .
It plaited itself into whatever I thought of , as a bodily pain would have done .
repeated <NAME> turning round in his chair to confront her .
I persuaded her to give me a sitting or two , for the street-door case .
You remember objecting to a word I used , as being too strong ?
It was another and a stronger woman who was the victim , and there had been a struggle -- in a barn .
We stopped to dine at <NAME> , and being now in <NAME> , were waited on , for the first time , by slaves .
For the moment , <NAME> does not turn to them , but remains looking at <NAME> looking at <NAME> ' s portrait through his eyeglass .
The poor schoolmaster shook his head , and said that they barely filled the two forms .
cries the woman , almost breathless .
The fine little boy with the blister on his nose is the eldest .
" I know little enough , I am sure , thanks to Ma !
He said , ' No , no , he had done quite right , ' but that was all .
' I am sorry to trouble you , <NAME> , ' said the brother , gathering them up , ' but -- ' ' Oh !
Different from <NAME> t ' other side the court .
' Yes , my bed , <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> , ' I ' m a prisoner .
" I do n't know nothink about no -- where I was took by the beadle , do you mean ? "
Give me a rope , a long rope .
Its contents are known to nobody but himself and us. ' ' Are you certain ? ' demanded <NAME> , precipitately ; ' not even to my mother or sister ?
'Upon my word I was not , sir , ' replied <NAME> , earnestly .
' If you will take me for your wife , <NAME> , I will love you dearly .
I was determined to come through , and come to you. ' ' What is the matter ? ' ' Nothing ' s the matter , sir .
People to say that Mr Dombey -- Mr Dombey ! -- was separated from his wife !
Hoo much cash hast thee gotten ? ' ' Not much , ' said <NAME> , colouring , ' but I can make it enough .
' The more ' s the pity , sir , ' returned Mrs. <NAME> ; ' you are losing all your good old habits .
and the old girl herself , accompanied by <NAME> , appears .
The rope went out as before , the signal was made as before , and the windlass stopped .
'Of course I know that , my dear .
You are a far more competent judge of such affairs than I am .
Oh , dear me , I 'm out of breath .
I am always disengaged after four or five o ' clock , and I have time early in the morning .
How she got from story to story was a mystery beyond solution .
' You had better let him go .
<NAME> ' s the fourth. ' ' Is the mother living ? ' I inquired .
' I ' ll take care of you. ' ' You ' re very kind , ' I gratefully returned .
' If I had left myself any breath to cry with , I should have cried again .
I had some association with it , that struck upon my heart directly ; but I was thinking of anything else when it came upon me , and was confused .
You are going to try matrimony .
My fancy is not able to get that far. ' As the low fire gleamed upon her , it showed her smiling , mournfully and abstractedly .
' <NAME> vexation , <NAME> ? ' asked the benignant father .
At this part of the recital <NAME> held his breath , and listened with a face of intense eagerness , though his eyes were not directed towards the speaker .
The <NAME> had next to consider where and why ?
We found <NAME> at his desk , in the turret office on the ground floor , either writing , or pretending to write , hard .
I see you pitch your <NAME> ' s bundle into the river .
' As I supposed from his not sending ! ' thought <NAME> .
Full of such thoughts , they turned into the long and sombre street .
<NAME> ! " " Yes , sir. " " Is that horse of mine ready ? " " <NAME> round to the door , sir. " " I say .
<NAME> <NAME> merely nodded to <NAME> , who disappearing with great alacrity , shortly returned , pushing in Mrs. Bumble , and dragging her unwilling consort after him .
Then Mr <NAME> descended and bore down upon him , with his utmost pressure of steam on .
I have no address , sir .
I only put it to yourself , sir . "
' I came here , ' said the military gentleman turning to Mrs Jarley -- ' ' pon my soul and honour I hardly know what I came here for .
' And how did you leave <NAME> , reverend sir ? ' said <NAME> .
And was it a hopeful or a promising thing anywhere ?
He let it lie there for some time , as if he had not the courage to open it , but at length did so and turned deadly pale .
' Of something that has made you sorrowful ? ' There was a long pause .
No matter who invites you to stay elsewhere .
' What is the matter ? ' asked the visitor again .
She was not accustomed to think of herself , or to trouble any one with her emotions .
They exchanged one brief glance ; there was a fire in the eyes of both , which could not be mistaken .
' Oh , don ' t talk to me about poor , ' returned my aunt .
Now has he made atonement to you -- with his life !
" Not just at present , my Lady . "
Up from among the fern in the hollow , and winding by the bridle-road among the trees , comes sometimes to this lonely spot the sound of horses ' hoofs .
Naturally , we was both of us inclined to give such a subject a wide berth .
Had n't you better go to bed ? "
<NAME> <NAME> , putting a hand on my shoulder and walking me on at his side without saying anything to me , addressed himself to his followers .
' Thank you <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' thank you , I am sure .
It is for him to say , here and now , all he can ; or to go hence , and do all he can .
' That ' s my handsome daughter , ' said the old woman .
' Oh you beauties ! ' cried <NAME> , affecting to salute the door by which the ladies had departed .
We duly came back to breakfast , and Mrs. <NAME> sat at the head of the table and <NAME> at the foot .
Would that be it , Mr Wegg ? ' ' That would depend upon what it was , Mr Venus .
I showed it to him now , and he admired it highly .
You are , at least , as avaricious as you are revengeful .
That is according as the young gentleman has his original character formed .
The bedroom where the clutching old man had lost his grip on life , was left as he had left it .
More than that , we couldn ' t improve the mills themselves , unless we laid down <NAME> carpets on the floors .
' When did I come here ?
I had forgotten my threat .
Dear heart alive , how his niece by marriage started !
They provided <NAME> with materials for plying her work , and she had a little table placed at the foot of his bed .
" I generally am near , " returns <NAME> , " being so fond of children .
' Here he is ! ' Perceiving himself to be the antecedent , <NAME> looked from the watchman to the man .
' You are quite sure ? ' said Mrs. Pott , stealing a tender look at her visitor .
oh don ' t ! ' exclaimed <NAME> , who really felt a thrill of terror in seeing the old man weep .
She answered , looking all the while at her husband for leave .
Although <NAME> was not in <NAME> , its master was , and it was stamped with the same seal .
' Say you are sure I didn ' t mean to .
I rang the bell , the servant came , and <NAME> , laying his written card upon the table and making a dejected bow , departed .
But <NAME> is not alone to-night to ponder at his usual length .
We tried to comfort the mother , and we whispered to her what Our <NAME> said of children .
So ' tis wi ' Slackbridge every bit. ' Reverting for a moment to his former refuge , he observed a cautionary movement of her eyes towards the door .
That learned man in a few hurried words explained the real state of the case .
The dust storm , driving between them and the placid sky , parted for a moment and showed them the stars .
' <NAME> young man , his <NAME> , ' said the <NAME> of the <NAME> .
<NAME> looks aghast at <NAME> .
Mr Sownds the <NAME> has long risen from the steps , and is in waiting with his cocked hat in his hand .
" A solitary child , neglected by his friends , is left there still . "
' I have far other views in life , and why should you waste your own ? ' ' <NAME> ! ' said the Secretary .
You wonder to hear me say A lady .
Her face being turned away from me and towards him , I could not see it .
For I believed one of two other persons to have become possessed of it , and to have turned it to this cruel account .
'Now , ' said <NAME> , when they had left the room , ' I 'll go and get you that cash , <NAME> .
My husband had been a guardian angel to him and <NAME> , and he blessed us both and wished us all the joy that life could yield us .
' Now , my own Dora , ' said I , ' you are very childish , and are talking nonsense .
' Have you more than one clerk , you parrot , that you ask the question ?
It a little surprised me to find that she hesitated and was not so radiantly willing as I had expected .
Of course , if you do press me , sir , I shall know I am wrong and will tell you . "
' Do you see much of <NAME> ? ' I asked , to change the subject .
<NAME> ' t go prancing and capering about !
Has the difficulty grown easier because of so many failures ? "
His <NAME> married , in seventeen ninety-seven , <NAME> , who was the second daughter by the third marriage -- no !
If I went to see our young friends in their present ill-regulated state of mind , I should give them pain .
Perfectly calm and steady , he sometimes repeated them to himself as he walked ; but , he heard them always .
' Ah , ' said the new-comer , ' it ' s a good thing for both of us , isn ' t it ?
So we all are , down to the dog .
There are not many persons , I hope and believe , who , after reading these passages , can ever hear that name with indifference .
It is likely to induce people to contrast <NAME> in her relation towards my daughter , with <NAME> in her relation towards myself .
Let us go ; do let us go. ' ' Give me the money , ' returned the old man , ' I must have it .
cried the man ; 'it wo n't answer here .

In the afternoon my guardian walked with me to <NAME> 's <NAME> and left me at the door .
' Everybody knows that , ' said the corpulent host .
Almost as much a stranger here as you , though born here , I came from <NAME> a little while ago .
What did <NAME> say ? ' ' Oh , a likely thing , sir , that I am going to tell you everything , and be told nothing !
He yielded to my view of the matter , when convinced that I was honestly in earnest ; and so , with his full consent , I start to-morrow morning .
I could not find that he was worse than I .
They come to a building in the yard with an office on an upper floor .
I would die to help you .
That I was lost in blissful delirium .
The cloud settled upon the picture , and concealed it from the sexton ' s view .
<NAME> , my dear <NAME> -- brother Ned , sir , is a perfect lion .
' The snuff-coloured suit , ' said <NAME> , surveying a threadbare coat .
He married -- an <NAME> lady -- and I was one of the trustees .
We used to keep such hours !
said the old lady , suiting the action to the word ; 'you do n't see it now , at all events . '
It looks better. ' ' Mr Rugg , ' said <NAME> , in his dejection , ' my only wish is , that it should be over .
I could repeat the words in my mind , and I knew what they meant of themselves , but I attached no meaning to them in any other connexion .
<NAME> <NAME> ' s the man , <NAME> .
' Wot ' s the matter now ? ' ' Have a cup of tea , there ' s a good soul , ' replied the buxom female coaxingly .
' <NAME> , ' returned <NAME> with dignity , ' I accept the altered phrase .
<NAME> ' t try to go confounding the rights and wrongs of things in that way .
" <NAME> , indeed , " said she , " by another visit from the wards in <NAME> !
Upon my soul , I half believe he escaped in his terror , to get quit of me , not knowing it was me as had got ashore .
They had not traversed many steps of the long main staircase when he stopped , and stared at the roof and round at the walls .
' You ' ll find it much pleasanter , <NAME> , ' urged another stout gentleman , who strongly resembled the other half of the roll of flannel aforesaid .
Buy one of my pictures , and I assure you , in confidence , it will not be worth the money .
Taking her eyes off the book , to test her memory of something in it , <NAME> was the first to see herself observed .
' Kinder and kinder than I can tell .
But I may as well tell you that I can find nothing the matter with Mr Merdle .
We must trust to you and time to set him right . "
We are all going to the play , or coming home from it .
Tradesmen ' s books hunger , and tradesmen ' s mouths water , for the gold dust of the <NAME> .
' But , bless you , ' pursued <NAME> , ' if you could have seen him of a night , at that time of it !
No ; yet something like it .
' Ha ha ! ' he would cry .
echoed the Jew , leaning back in his chair .
If he forces us to it , they 'll be producible , wo n't they ? "
Their objects were as various as their demands .
But all that I have to say in this way , I have said .
When she did look up , the expression was not there .
" I know nothing of his life .
" Thankee ! " said <NAME> , rubbing his hands .
I am happy to see you .
No one who can read , ever looks at a book , even unopened on a shelf , like one who can not .
" Or unless she fancies it 's blood , " said the woman .
He held no station among the Hands who could make speeches and carry on debates .
" But to pass from one subject to another , " resumes <NAME> .
I mean , I am the more easily to be trusted ; and any little constraint that you might feel with another , may vanish before me .
Let me tell you , <NAME> has done without ' em ! ' ' What a load you take from my mind ! ' cried <NAME> .
I thought he had been dead ! ' ' Dead to me , ' returned my aunt , ' but living. ' I sat in silent amazement .
' What are you looking at ?
He took it in one of his , and kissed it , and withdrew .
If it only puts him in the vein to leave his poor clerk fifty pounds , that 's something ; and I think I shook him yesterday . "
cried <NAME> , raising his voice .
If you had only sent in to me when they were here !
It is such a beautiful place ! ' ' Is it ? ' ' It is like the inside of the most exquisite ship that ever sailed .
All the best means are at once in action , and everybody present lends a hand , and a heart and soul .
I doubt if he had ever once thought of it before .
Go to my lawyer ( you remember where ; you have been there before ) and show your independence now , will you ?
cried Mrs. Mann , starting back .
I have been thinking that the law is the boy for me . "
I knew a better way of going to work .
You repent of your determination now , do you ? ' ' My determination ! ' said <NAME> .
I should put 'em down at the figures of about eight and ten . "
Do you know , <NAME> , he improves ? " " I said to you I thought he was softened when I last saw him. " " So you did .
But <NAME> , in a spiritless unhappy way , only went whither she was led , and seemed to have no care for anything .
' ' Twas kind of you to meet me .
The cart is shaken all to pieces , and the rugged road is very near its end .
I happened to turn my eyes towards this place , as I was thinking of many things ; and I saw a figure beyond , dressed in a plain cloak .
We shall meet again soon .
" His son 's name is the same , you know , " said I .
And the <NAME> whistled , and stared , and wondered , and dodged about his room , and could make nothing of it .
The brothers give a Banquet on a great <NAME> .
' Nothing could be better , ' said the father-in-law , rubbing his hands .
' It would be particularly comfortable , I think , ' replied <NAME> .
I never knew such a thing .
When I had got rid of him , which I thought it well to do without prolonging explanations , my mind was much troubled by these two circumstances taken together .
On the man ' s stumbling into the room , <NAME> rose to leave it .
' And you have -- when you catch it -- the <NAME> .
Think how soon it will be over. ' ' How soon it will be over ! ' he repeats gloomily .
Throws his lordship 's papers into the fire , my dear , if he wo n't pay the jeweller ! "
<NAME> <NAME> wanted 'em and got 'em , but I looked 'em over first .
By the <NAME> , it ' s a great name ! ' said the Major , solemnly .
' You have been betrayed , as all betrayers are .
And in due course there was bed ; where , but for that resumption of the studies which took place in dreams , were rest and sweet forgetfulness .
" This is very discouraging , " said I .
No matter , <NAME> ; that would never do .
' What do you say , <NAME> ? ' inquired Mrs. Squeers .
' Mr Clennam , will he pay all his debts before he leaves here ? ' ' No doubt .
The landlady , by no means satisfied with this assurance , which she considered an ingenious evasion of the question , rejoined that he had his reasons of course .
You <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , bending her brows upon him angrily , ' you <NAME> ' s clerk !
<NAME> was , when a poet sat upon a stool in a public place , and mused in the sight of men .
This the landlady of the Break of Day chirpingly explained , calling between whiles , ' Hola , my husband ! ' out at the side door .
' What is the matter ? ' said <NAME> to the boy .
( Captain <NAME> 's claret to your mistress , <NAME> ! )
Your money has changed you to marble .
I should soon have made you a friendly visit. ' ' Ah ! ' said <NAME> , tossing her head .
<NAME> , with her innocent little scream , supposes so .
In the moment when I was withdrawing my head to go quietly away , I saw a great flaming light spring up .
There was not the right taste about the premature productions , and they didn ' t keep well .
<NAME> don ' t hurt the creature who is so fond of you !
Because she must have known whether it did or not .
* * * * * 'Stone dead ! '
' What -- the -- deyvle ! ' With which broken ejaculations , he fixed his glass in his eye , and stared at <NAME> in great surprise .
She restrained her tears by a great effort until she was alone upstairs , and then gave them vent .
Still , <NAME> , sir , I must stipulate that if you have any word with me , that word is spoken in the presence of my friend . "
<NAME> , both refer to Mr Clennam .
In busier periods of the year these bills disappear , and the houses swarm with legislators .
' <NAME> down , sir , ' said Mr Boffin , shaking hands with him .
" I begin to think I must be a swell in the <NAME> without knowing it . "
Unmindful of her stealthy tread , her victim holds his course in fancied triumph .
In this world you need meet no more . '
<NAME> was ever on any account to give anybody anything , or render anybody help without purchase .
Morning after morning they roamed about the town together , pursuing this singular research .
After several times falling short of my destination and as often overshooting it , I came unexpectedly round a corner , upon <NAME> .
He could pave the way , he said , in half an hour , and then they would go down to <NAME> .
You had no such thing in contemplation when I was with you. ' ' No , ' replied <NAME> , ' I hadn ' t then .
" I was standing by a minute , on the chance of company. " " You are late , " I remarked .
' I don ' t know of what—of everything , I think. ' ' Say not another word , ' returned <NAME> .
' To London. ' ' Have you any home to go to ? ' ' I think I have a mother .
' If so , he ought to know best. ' ' No , my dear ; nor it ain ' t that , neither .
He gladly agreed to hire it .
' Why do you answer it ? ' was his reception of his brother .
' I mean the gentleman up-stairs , ' said <NAME> , turning to <NAME> .
I know you send me away for my good. ' ' O , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> above us knows I do ! ' ' Yes yes .
Stretched upon a mattress on the floor , lay <NAME> , fast asleep .
<NAME> up , you crabbed image for the sign of a walking-stick shop , and say you saw him put it there ! "
But unless I had taken the life of <NAME> 's boy on that occasion , I really do not even now see what I could have done save endure .
Not <NAME> ? ' Then a second handsome face appearing .
He was the herald of the family procession .
<NAME> and <NAME> , together , upset the whole house directly .
" I see that I hold a sanctuary in their hearts , and in the hearts of their descendants , generations hence .
Mind my words , it shall be done. ' ' But how ? ' said <NAME> .
'It is never too late , ' said <NAME> , 'for penitence and atonement . '
Two other passengers , besides the one , were plodding up the hill by the side of the mail .
" May be , I have not . "
How should he , <NAME> , meet the eye of old <NAME> at the next quarter-sessions !
' Dear boy , I know it , but I can ' t give it .
Do I understand that you will take her with you ? "
In every Public Institution , the right of the people to attend , and to have an interest in the proceedings , is most fully and distinctly recognised .
The woman ' s was the first reached .
My dear , do n't you give your mind to that again , or I shall link your feet together at the ankles . "
I was bad enough there , but I have been so much worse here .
Can anybody doubt how all this has been brought about ? ' ' I should scarcely think they could , ' said <NAME> mildly .
' <NAME> finds it so , ' she returned .
<NAME> , will you step with us into the next room for a moment ? ' <NAME> assented , and the quartette walked into an empty apartment .
" Friend and legal adviser , " said <NAME> .
He looked in a hurried manner at the graves , then anxiously at the child , then pressed her to his side , and bade her stop to rest .
In its small proportions , it was not unlike the kind of place usually assigned to a gate-porter in <NAME> .
Oh ! " " Ah-h-h ! " growled the journeyman , between his teeth , " I 'd hold you , if you was my wife .
" No , you do n't do yourself justice .
<NAME> made the same impatient gesture with her crouching shoulders , in reply ; and he was glad and happy .
It was a cold hard easterly morning when he latched the garden gate and turned away .
' They have some business here ; and I took advantage of their coming , to come too .
Do you hear ? ' she added , waiting with some apparent inconsistency FOR an answer .
To which <NAME> says , " Who 's conspiring ? "
Which he did with his boots on , and an umbrella under his arm .
You ' ve seen this gentleman before , I think ? ' <NAME> shook hands with <NAME> , and his friends followed his example .
However , they were grown up and had their own way , and they made the most of it .
' Let him look to that !
cries <NAME> , who has started from his chair and unaccountably begun to sidle away .
The Jews with the fifty-bladed penknives shut them up in despair ; the men with the pocket-books made pocket-books of them .
' I said , now candidly , ' Mr <NAME> explained , a little put out .
A big , loud man , with a stare , and a metallic laugh .
At home , in my own room , I am sometimes moved to cry out , ' Oh , <NAME> ! ' in a transport of love .
' The reaction , my lord , the reaction , ' said <NAME> .
You ' re hammer and tongs , already , you two ? ' he said , coolly stroking his face .
It was difficult , however , to be sure of this ; the <NAME> having no trace of expression in his face when sober .
I never saw in any face there , thank heaven , on my birthday , that it would have been better if I had never been born .
I am very impressible myself , by nature .
I pass the greater part of the long vacation here .
I was afraid I had said something shocking .
" You had a child once , whom you loved and lost. " A stronger pressure on my hand .
'You do n't mean to say he died ? '
" I rose in life that way . "
Very , very , strong feelings. ' With a shaking hand , <NAME> took out his handkerchief and wiped his brow .
<NAME> was there , sitting by the bed .
She laughs and talks , and seems to like it .
If I could ever set this right !
His only trouble was , the swift and rapid river .
' What a prophet you have shown yourself , <NAME> ! ' pursued <NAME> .
I saw it move a little more , and a hand softly interpose to keep it open .
It was never so well worth your while to get me out of this country as it is to-night .
It was a strangely unreal ride through the old squalid streets , with a sensation of being raised out of them into an airy world of wealth and grandeur .
When <NAME> was released , you , his old domestic , had the charge of him , I know .
Her visitor watched her as she did so .
" Why is it best , sir ? "
Is it yet coming on ? ' ' Why , no , sir , ' retorted Mr Flintwinch .
Touch him upon money , and you touch no booby then .
It is <NAME> , I think ; is it not ? ' ' Yes , sir , ' returned <NAME> .
<NAME> , I kiss your hand. ' ' We will shake hands , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , extending his , as old <NAME> bowed .
<NAME> , old intriguer ? ' Jeremiah , with his eyes upon his mistress , made no reply .
Let all the lovers get out of the way , and talk among themselves , if they ' ve anything to say .
Therefore I make the entreaty I have now preferred , and I hope you will have sufficient consideration for me to accede to it . "
' I hope so , ' replied the child .
' We understand _that a severe rencontre came off_ a few days since in the <NAME> , between Mr .
' Oh no ! ' ' That ' s well , ' remarked <NAME> .
' Well , <NAME> ! ' said the Major .
It must often happen with miscellaneous ones. ' ' With ribs ( I grant you ) always .
It was with a heavy heart that <NAME> soon afterwards -- no , not retired ; there was no retirement there -- followed -- to his dirty and crowded dormitory .
We want to brisk her up , and brisk her about , and give her a change. ' ' That ' s it ! ' said the open-hearted Mrs Boffin .
' I must admit the wine .
We seem , to me , to have been months over <NAME> , and months more over the other stories .
We will look before we leap , and take plenty of time about it . "
She turned her head as the carriage came up to her , rose quickly , and presented herself at the carriage-door .
' You ' re a young traveller , my child , ' he said , laying his hand gently on her head .
These were additions to the list of entertaining incidents , but there was still another source of interest .
She did not raise her head .
With a part of this , it would be necessary to buy some clothes , for she had none but those she wore .
<NAME> that boy ; he ' s gone to sleep again .
When he was out of employment , I couldn ' t always keep him near me .
I apologise. ' ' Humbly and submissively ? ' said <NAME> .
' You wonder to hear me say that , ' remarked the old woman , shaking her head .
' <NAME> away , dear <NAME> , pray further away. ' ' We must go on , indeed , ' said the child , yielding to his restless wish .
She was absolutely without pity .
" I have n't begun insuring yet , " he replied .
' To-night we three will put up at a <NAME> .
said <NAME> , leading the way back .
' <NAME> ' t it prime ! ' ' This King had a daughter , who was the wisest and most beautiful Princess that ever was seen .
It was not that _he_ looked to them , but that <NAME> looked to them .
The keeper had brought her a chair on which she sat in the middle of the porch between us .
But I shall rally , my dear <NAME> , in the morning ; do not fear for me , or be uneasy on my account .
The last thing I saw was <NAME> ' s unruffled eye ; fraught , as I fancied , with the silent conviction that I was very young indeed .
' I am sure you must be very tired , ' said the mama , turning to <NAME> .
No Other <NAME> is so Favoured as This Country. ' ' And ozer countries ? -- ' the foreign gentleman was beginning , when Mr <NAME> put him right again .
' You don ' t like to hear the name of the cause ? ' said the little man , still busying himself with the knot .
'Not now , for the world , ' replied the young lady .
' Mr Boffin , I happened to be in Chancery Lane this morning , when I saw you going along before me .
But , he was not far off , for presently she heard a troubled movement and a shouting coming along , which filled her with fear .
So should I. I was wrong .
' We are not , ' roared <NAME> , in a tone which , to any dispassionate listener , carried conviction with it .
When the repast was fully discussed , the lion put his hands in his waistband again , and lay down to meditate .
' It ' s prime meat , ' rejoined his lady .
He was Mr Merdle ' s last gift to <NAME> .
<NAME> had been very pale from the moment of his entrance ; but that might have been the effect of her recent illness .
<NAME> <NAME> handed me in and took his own seat on the box .
' This plan , you see , <NAME> , has been gradually introduced into all the prisons for debt , ' said <NAME> .
A <NAME> , when he ' s a good un , is worth his weight in gold .
But yer must know , Work'us , yer mother was a regular right-down bad 'un . '
' That ' s real flesh and blood !
Or paid off -- like a ship 's company .
The scorer not committed , the scored debited with what is against him .
I am bound to say so now .
He would have taken his gaiters off his legs , to give away .
And that is my sensation , " says <NAME> , looking round upon the company , " at the present moment . "
' And the second floor ? ' said <NAME> , on finding the first satisfactory .
' Is your business done , <NAME> ? ' inquired the lady .
I say what I mean .
The poor relations caught the people who they thought would like it , and , when the game flagged , got caught themselves .
' I am the son of a country gentleman , ' returned <NAME> , ' your equal in birth and education , and your superior I trust in everything besides .
Ve-ry happy , I am sure ! "
I have put these considerations to you , my dear Sir , very feebly and imperfectly , but I ask you to think of them .
A pot of beer had appeared from the <NAME> , and they were sharing it by turns in a peaceable manner .
I should have gone to bed with a sore heart indeed under any other roof but that which sheltered little Em ' ly ' s head .
Do not think so poorly of me as to believe that I feign a love I do not feel .
It sent the most insurrectionary tune into the world that was ever composed .
The general opinion among this class of gentlemen was , that it was a weak thing in <NAME> , and he ' d live to repent it .
<NAME> faith in the deception was the first article of his creed .
Does her credit , under the circumstances , in my opinion ! ' She still looked faint and pale .
" And so have I , " cried <NAME> .
I 'll have no feelings here .
It is now inclosed in a gentleman ' s garden .
They ' re true to one another , faithfo ' to one another , ' fectionate to one another , e ' en to death .
Both these heads of information were in a list that <NAME> , while in prison , gave to <NAME> , of the possessions he supposed I should inherit .
<NAME> is quite clear that he had better not .
Perhaps that will be considered an acceptable course of proceeding .
'Yes , sir , rather thirsty , ' answered <NAME> .
This was bad , but not the worst .
Or if it was partly , was it wholly and entirely ?
' You ' ll find it a most amazing stool to sit down upon , you may depend , ' returned Mr Brass .
Thus <NAME> had no sooner swallowed another glassful than he smiled upon all present in happy forgetfulness of having exhibited symptoms of pugnacity , and proposed ' The ladies !
Perhaps we shall change that , ' said Mr Boffin with a threatening roll of his head .
In pursuance of this determination , little Oliver , to his excessive astonishment , was released from bondage , and ordered to put himself into a clean shirt .
Having no reply ready , he could do no better than embrace her .
then this is not my natural manner ? ' she rejoined .
The cry is taken up by a hundred voices , and the crowd accumulate at every turning .
It only wants attending to .
He is called to the bar ; and with admirable industry and self-denial has scraped another hundred pounds together , to fee a Conveyancer whose chambers he attends .
Still the restless mind went , following and counting , ever farther , ever higher , as to the summit of a mighty tower that it took years to climb .
I shall not fail to correspond .
Always Merdle. ' ' Very strange how these runs on an infatuation prevail , ' said <NAME> .
<NAME> said , " Don ' t come back , <NAME> , until you have seen Mr Boffin , and told him all .
' I am for <NAME> tonight .
' <NAME> back here , will you , and let me knock. ' Anything that makes a noise is satisfactory to a crowd .
' I am sorry , ' stammered <NAME> , confused by the strange man 's wild look .
<NAME> was that , <NAME> ? ' ' Yes , <NAME> Dean. ' ' He has stayed late. ' ' Yes , <NAME> .
<NAME> suggested that it was comfortable to know that <NAME> did not mean these destructive sentiments .
One : I remember his changing a small folded paper from one pocket to another , after we came out , which he had not touched before .
His door being shut , she softly opened it and spoke to him , approaching his bed with a noiseless step .
You have no young child ? "
No , <NAME> ! ' shaking his head .
He had a wonderful satisfaction in seeing him , and in commenting on his decayed condition after he was gone .
' Oh , quite enough to get , <NAME> , as the soldier said ven they ordered him three hundred and fifty lashes , ' replied <NAME> .
The meek man supposed he did , but supposed that had absolutely nothing to do with it , if its laws were well administered .
<NAME> will coom then ; and arterwards I ' ll see thee safe t ' thy <NAME> ' lodgin .
' You are very good , ' said <NAME> .
' Tell him I was hearty , and sent my respects .
' I heerd it now , quite apparent , ' resumed <NAME> .
But as this is the <NAME> , gentlemen , where the lights are , I recommend dropping the subject .
We must have our national schools to walk at the head of , and we must have our standing armies .
I have no occasion to relate that I succeeded .
" I presume this is your other ward , <NAME> ? "
' I mean , ' he explained , ' that young ways were never my ways .
<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> were left alone at the desk , in the general departure from the <NAME> .
Let him rot there. ' ' Certainly , sir .
With all that ruin at my feet and about me , it seemed a natural place for me , that day .
How do you suppose you are ever to get through life , if you ' re such a coward as this ?
<NAME> stock got into circulation .
You can ' t put any confidence in him , sir .
However , the permission was given , and was never retracted ; for when the month was out , <NAME> and I were ready to depart .
I ' ll be more communicative with you .
' The speculations of an Angular man , ' resumed <NAME> , still sitting and speaking exactly as before , ' are probably erroneous on so globular a topic .
<NAME> ' t that make a difference , <NAME> ?
And what do we live for but sympathy !
' See that the boiler ' s full .
All their worldly goods are a bag , a large chest and an old chair : one , old , high-backed , rush-bottomed chair : a solitary settler in itself .
' More care ! ' said the old man in a shrill voice , ' more care of Nelly !
There is no despotism here ; that ' s the great thing .
Take my word , it ' s nothing whatever .
cried the old gentleman , bursting out with the rage he had kept down so long , 'd -- n me !
" I 'm not a going back .
<NAME> <NAME> sat silent for some minutes , and then , turning round to the prosecutor , said in a towering passion .
I have seen it many times since then , by sunlight and by moonlight , but never free from the impressions of that journey .
As I recall our being opposed thus , face to face , I seem again to hear my heart beat fast and high .
Who was this , do you think ? ' ' Why do you ask me ? ' repeated <NAME> .
What are these suckers of cigars and swallowers of strong drinks , whose hats and legs we see in every possible variety of twist , doing , but amusing themselves ?
What if I were to turn too ?
' Little Kate <NAME> ' were the words that caught his ear .
' If you please , ' said she .
Mrs. Rouncewell might have been sufficiently assured by hearing the rain , but that she is rather deaf , which nothing will induce her to believe .
' Dear me ! ' said Mr <NAME> , ' you too !
All this time , the ringing at the bell was constantly renewed , and those without were beating at the door .
' You are better ? ' said the child , stopping to speak with him .
' She is a very charming girl , but she has a great deal of feeling .
You have stood of your own strength ever since .
In every little chamber that I entered , and at every grate through which I looked , I seemed to see the same appalling countenance .
" You girls are more trouble than you 're worth , by half . "
'That 's for your people , ' said the guard .
' Dear me ! ' said <NAME> .
<NAME> , your mother took this course with you .
There was nobody at the chambers but <NAME> .
' You just come away , ' said <NAME> .
You will please to answer no , it is not enough. ' ' A moment ! ' cried <NAME> , interposing , ' permit me !
Consequently you 're very far from wanting to give trouble .
<NAME> <NAME> is wild with joy , and my aunt remits me a guinea by the next post .
' What <NAME> was that , <NAME> ? ' ' Lor !
Mrs. Jellyby , sitting in quite a nest of waste paper , drank coffee all the evening and dictated at intervals to her eldest daughter .
Pausing from his work , he leant on his spade , and put his hand to his dull ear .
' Be mine , be mine ! ' cried the old gentleman .
Which is the man ? " " Here is the man , " said <NAME> .
' I called to ask this morning. ' ' Thank you very much ! ' the pleasant voice of <NAME> would reply .
The day changes as it wears itself away and becomes dark and drizzly .
Y. -- but really this was too bad !
Then the Major called at Mr <NAME> ' s house in town ; and came down again , in the same coach as Mr Dombey .
' Thank you , ' he returned , with fervour .
A fair profit is , of course , allowable . '
He is , I say again without disguise , a low mercenary wretch .
At least , Mr <NAME> seemed perfectly satisfied when he descried them on board .
' I have saved him , ' she thought .
According to your own account I ' m not worth much , ' Wegg reasons persuasively .
' You will not be long dressing , <NAME> , I presume ? ' said Mr Dombey .
The scamp has been obliged to fly , as I learn , for some knavery , and has found his way abroad .
' That ' s the witness-box , I suppose ? ' said <NAME> , pointing to a kind of pulpit , with a brass rail , on his left hand .
Con-fined , as the lady said. ' ' A prisoner ! ' exclaimed <NAME> , with unaccountable vehemence .
" Only a matter of form , miss , " returned the young gentleman .
'Meat , ma'am , meat , ' replied <NAME> , with stern emphasis .
<NAME> on my left ! "
Taking the bread under his arm , the young gentlman turned into a small public-house , and led the way to a tap-room in the rear of the premises .
If this young lord does dog your footsteps , and whisper his drivelling inanities in your ears , what of it ?
" Yet , you silly little thing !
He left here , ' said <NAME> , ' with his mother , who had been clamouring , and beseeching , and disclosing , the whole time .
' Good morning , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> ; very coldly .
But , the comfort was , that all the company at the grand hotel of <NAME> were perfectly dressed .
I pity you , and I despise you ! "
<NAME> <NAME> is mightily curious in respect of the room .
It was within half an hour or so of the time of closing .
The seconds retired , the gentleman on the camp-stool did the same , and the belligerents approached each other .
You know M. R. F. , but not as well as I do .
They are met at the very threshold with this mild appeal .
Let them rest though ; they ' re better gone. ' ' Much better , dear , ' replied the child .

' Well ? ' said the surly man , touching his hat to the old lady .
That he had dipped his hands in blood , to mark himself a miserable fool and tool .
He had been still writing in his hiding-place , and still dwelling on his grievances , hour after hour .
' Yes , for a licence. ' ' We ' re in time , ' exclaimed <NAME> .
' <NAME> well , my love , ' replied <NAME> .
I proceed to other passages of my narrative .
They took another quart apiece to drink each other ' s health in , and were staunch friends ever afterwards .
I wish that we should know and trust each other , Florence. ' ' You are very kind to me , ' said <NAME> , ' dear <NAME> .
She petted them , as I may say , and made the most of them .
" Mat , " said <NAME> , " you have heard pretty well all I have been saying to this lady and these two gentlemen .
Sparks that have been struck out during our intercourse have shown me this. ' ' Well !
' I was to pull through it , I suppose , Mrs. Gradgrind .
The fact was , that <NAME> had not , at first , been able to bring his mind to the avowal , that he had only shot a boy .
' Never you mind , ' retorted that gentleman , tapping his nose derisively .
" Are the <NAME> down here , <NAME> ? "
I ' ll beg it of her with kisses , ' said <NAME> .
They were both silent for a time ; she weeping .
How could I ever be worthy of those tears ?
' Why , I know that knife ! ' said <NAME> .
" Were you known in <NAME> , once ? " " Not over and above , dear boy .
The course of education is severe , but well devised , and manly .
' No , ' returned Mr Dombey , looking round over his shoulder ; ' you can come and go here , <NAME> , as you please .
Therefore when Mrs. Bagnet at last appears , rosy from the invigorating pail , and sits down to her work , <NAME> growls , " Old girl ! "
'Oh no , they ai n't , ' said the officer .
' Of great talent , ' repeated Mrs. Micawber .
There started up , from the gate , or from the rushes , or from the ooze ( which was quite in his stagnant way ) , <NAME> .
I shall pull through , my dear ! "
And , <NAME> be his witness that he has his humour thoroughly gratified !
Either of these gentlemen wish to go through the court ?
Lowering of the family in intention ! ' ' <NAME> ! ' cried <NAME> , pale and trembling .
'Certainly , my dear , certainly , ' rejoined <NAME> , making a quicker motion towards the door .
I returned to the inn yard , and , impressed by my remembrance of the face , looked awfully around for it .
That ' s not dutiful , Mr Arthur .
Is this the missis ? ' inquired <NAME> .
offences to expiate and peace to make , does not justify the desire to forget .
As to myself I ain ' t yet as <NAME> ' nable as I may come to be .
But though sight and hearing were gone for ever , the poor child ' s sufferings were not ended .
' She needs rest , ' said the old man , patting her cheek ; ' too pale -- too pale .
Through this little gate , she passed out of childhood into the care-laden world .
' After being so good too , and coming along so well !
At this juncture , <NAME> speaks to Mr Dombey : more distinctly and emphatically than her custom is , and moving at the same time , close to <NAME> .
' Repeat your words louder , sir .
The <NAME> family had for some time helped to administer the <NAME> Office .
Do you really and truly say so ? ' ' Why , of course I do .
Then how can I possibly give you the answer that I have not discovered ?
I must confess to feeling rather glad that he is not <NAME> himself .
The son had no watch .
There is something like a distant ray of light in thy muttered reason for this : " He wos wery good to me , he wos ! "
I must admit that I could not regard myself in an agreeable light .
No wonder that I shook my head !
An indubitable token of life !
<NAME> , it must be evident to yourself , as it is to me , that you have been this evening very different from what you were before .
This gave him a little comfort .
'No , ' replied the doctor ; 'of course not !
I have arranged it with <NAME> Victoria. ' ' Arranged what ? ' asked the Doctor .
It used not to be so , but <NAME> in all such things is changed for the worse .
<NAME> again sat looking at the rain .
' Watchman , ' shouted <NAME> furiously , ' stop him -- hold him -- keep him tight -- shut him in , till I come down .
Have you known my mother long ? ' ' I think two years , sir , -- The bell has stopped. ' ' How did you know her first ?
' What ' s the matter ? ' ' The law don ' t agree with me , ' returned <NAME> .
Because I saw it would be of no use , ' replied <NAME> .
A merry Christmas to everybody !
So to <NAME> we will go .
The young gentleman was her distant cousin , she told me , and his name <NAME> .
I thought I had killed her , this time .
<NAME> Leicester looks astounded and inquires , " Is the man in custody ? "
I have the face of this man , who was going to be released next day , before me now .
Here are footsteps too.—O <NAME> ! ' She ran back , and caught her round the neck .
Yes , you deserve 'em from me .
Encountering squally weather again in the <NAME> of <NAME> , we tumbled and rolled about as usual all that night and all next day .
" Where is your son <NAME> , Mrs .
Run and tell him that ; d ' ye hear ?
' No Fizkin ! ' roared the crowd .
" Now , <NAME> , " says <NAME> , keeping his forefinger in an impressive state of action , " bear in mind what I 've said to you .
<NAME> <NAME> , ain ' t I volatile ? ' Her tone and look implied something that was not agreeable to me in connexion with the subject .
'Not long gone seven , ' said the girl .
I will not suffer this tone of levity. ' ' My goodness me !
' Will any coach— ' ' I don ' t mean that he thould go in the comic livery , ' said <NAME> .
<NAME> for <NAME> , an old rip !
I want to say it earnestly , and with as plain a meaning as it is possible to express .
My Lady alights so quickly and walks away so quickly that <NAME> , for all his scrupulous politeness , is unable to assist her , and is left behind .
<NAME> muttered , with an unusual catching in his voice , that it was a pimple ; and begged the <NAME> to lead him where he would .
To which <NAME> would demur : ' Undoubtedly , <NAME> , but <NAME> acutely remarks , ' that .
' Theer ' s the very locker that you used to sit on , ' long with <NAME> ' ly ! ' said <NAME> , in a whisper .
This is a most important matter .
And heer ' s your old little bedroom , see , <NAME> ' r <NAME> !
I will consider my child !
I was looking back round the awning of the cart , and wondered what business it was of his .
' We are -- not younger , ' said <NAME> .
Of course , he entered at this juncture , into no explanation of his motives , and they walked on very lovingly together .
When he speaks , he does so without looking at her , and as if his thoughts were already roaming away by anticipation .
But I tell you this : -- when that young fellow ' s interest is concerned , he holds as tight as a horse-leech .
There was something gipsy-like and agreeable in the dinner , after all .
I have forgotten to mention -- at least I have not mentioned -- that <NAME> was the same dark young surgeon whom we had met at <NAME> 's .
I was frightened when I went away , and could not think .
Mrs Pipchin almost laughs as the fly-van drives off , and she composes her black bombazeen skirts , and settles herself among the cushions of her easy chair .
<NAME> God ! ' returned the old man .
' I only know her picture , downstairs .
Now , is it ? ' ' N-n-no ! ' replied <NAME> , faintly .
' <NAME> and smoked his pipe , and said the infant negroes were -- what did he say the infant negroes were ? ' said Mrs. Weller .
Little <NAME> rose and left the table .
" 'She has some recent association with the number twelve ? '
If I understand any noddle in the world , I understand yours .
Says he wants a pound , and knows a dog .
The younger brother , uneasy at his protracted absence , was watching at the door for his coming , when he appeared in the pathway with his little guide .
He had already glanced at his hands more than once .
And the fact is , my dear <NAME> , that we can not live without something widely different from existing circumstances shortly turning up .
' I am engaged at this moment , Sam. ' ' Beg your pardon , <NAME> , ' rejoined <NAME> .
Pull up here , ' cried the doctor .
" I hope so , " said he .
Nevertheless , <NAME> scraped out of his cogitating face a lively conviction that Mr Blandois would keep his word on this occasion , and would be seen again .
Not Ri -- -- ' Before <NAME> could finish the name , his comrade had got his hand under his chin and fiercely shut up his mouth .
here ' s this blessed phenomenon at last .
I wish to know on -- ha -- what authority , on whose authority .
" Very well , <NAME> , " returns <NAME> .
Mrs. <NAME> looked rather alarmed , relented a little and faltered , what did <NAME> mean .
I have an impression that for a long time , though I dreamed of being elsewhere and in a variety of scenes , it was always blowing in my dream .
I knew that I should not be worthier of the love I could not take if I reserved it .
You call me a lucky fellow .
And who is the dearest friend I have in the world ?
By whose hand do you think ? ' ' Why do you ask me ? ' said <NAME> .
It hid in doorways too , rubbing its horrible shoulders against doors , and drawing them up to its ears , as if it were laughing .
' Deary ! ' said the old woman then .
<NAME> and sickness are too common in many stations of life to deserve more notice than is usually bestowed on the most ordinary vicissitudes of human nature .
" Wolf , I 'll tell you something more .
" Spare no detail. " <NAME> saw that they understood one another , and proceeded .
' Why did you resist them ?
They ought to be ashamed of themselves for telling me. ' <NAME> crossed to the other side , and hurriedly opened the letters .
The rain fell heavily on the roof , and pattered on the ground , and dripped among the evergreens and the leafless branches of the trees .
<NAME> , sir. " " Show us where you live , " said the man .
<NAME> <NAME> , we ' ll part , if you please .
Perhaps you know it 's <NAME> ? " " Yes , " said I .
' How can that be hoped for ?
" And he IS a child .
Ladies and gentlemen , my daughter .
His spirits were elastic ; his good-humour was restored .
How I felt as if its might would push me from my ground in <NAME> ' s thoughts .
I don ' t know what other girls know .
Thee wath <NAME> , thee wath , and now thee ' th nothing—on accounth of fat .
( Musingly , as each gazes down the street . )
I never had this mysterious impression more strongly in my life , than before he uttered those words .
They had serviceable bonnets , good warm cloaks , and shawls ; and were not above clogs and pattens .
" Now , my friends , " proceeds <NAME> , " since I am upon this theme -- " Guster presents herself .
And there ' s another thing to be remembered , <NAME> .
said I in a whisper .
Can I have seen him abroad ?
I was so touched with pity for <NAME> that I could not reproach him any more , even by a look .
We will walk that way , my dears .
At that moment , he was interrupted by a loud knocking at the door below .
' But , if the four elder sisters were lovely , how beautiful was the youngest , a fair creature of sixteen !
The children , under the guardianship of <NAME> , blocked up the window , and dropped out oranges and halfpence all the way along .
I know you pretty well , you see . '
On our arrival in <NAME> , we found the king and queen of that country elevated in two arm-chairs on a kitchen-table , holding a Court .
' I never had such a turn in all my life ! ' ' Have you been to the <NAME> , then , mama ? ' asked <NAME> .
" Tell the <NAME> and the <NAME> where to stop ; not me ! " <NAME> entered , and the group was broken up .
For there had reached us on the wings of the wind and rain , a long shout .
You can form no idea , sir , of the number of times he kissed quite a scrubby little piece -- in comparison -- that I cut off for <NAME> .
' That ' s <NAME> , ' returned <NAME> .
' Where ' s <NAME> ? ' cried a dozen voices .
' You are right , ' returned <NAME> .
<NAME> number two , said they must take everything on political economy .
The cold light of morning had succeeded to night and there was already , in the sky , the red suffusion of the coming sun .
Without having undergone any decided second attack of her malady , the old woman seemed to have crawled backward in her recovery from the first .
' <NAME> ! ' said the stranger , ' that is my name. ' ' Mr .
I dig the ground , and plant things that are to live and grow .
" Yes , " said <NAME> , " well enough .
I hope <NAME> will excuse its painful nature . "
<NAME> was afraid to look at either her or the man .
Better than some real ones. ' ' Never fret about them , <NAME> , ' she answered quickly , and not without an anxious glance at his face .
Indeed , I show the greater confidence of the two , for I will pay in advance whatever you please , and I am going to trust my furniture here .
' Oh do come in and sit down a minute , <NAME> , please , ' said <NAME> .
He has got that bottle about him .
I am only one of the travellers from down-stairs .
It was just at the time of that discovery in the river .
He is quite sure of himself .
' There ' s a sheet of letter-paper , ' he returned .
She never turns her head until she comes to the crossing where Jo plies with his broom .
Nor was the occasional society of <NAME> himself wanting to complete their felicity .
Of coming down into a harbour when the tide was at its full , and seeing fishing-boats float on , and glad women and children waiting for them .
' For <NAME> ' s sake , ' cried <NAME> , ' don ' t do that !
Since the time of her leaving home , <NAME> had lived with the rest of the family on equal terms .
The noise and motion in the streets fatigued his brain at first , but he was not surprised , or curious , or pleased , or irritated .
Having bestowed a scowl upon the object of this warning , to increase its effect , <NAME> continued .
' Her writing ! ' said <NAME> .
It sheared off heads so many , that it , and the ground it most polluted , were a rotten red .
Do you know , <NAME> , I almost wonder that <NAME> never turned your thoughts to <NAME> . "
' In with it , Christopher. ' ' All right , <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> .
<NAME> tried to speak , but her tears prevented her .
'Yes , I am , ' replied the old gentleman ; 'but I am not sure that this boy actually took the handkerchief .
Little <NAME> ' s. ' So always as he sat alone in the faded chair , thinking .
I suffer for <NAME> , <NAME> .
I do n't know that it 's of any direct use my doing so , but it 's all I can do , and I do it thoroughly .
I study and get up abstruse No Thoroughfares in the course of the day .
Oh , where was <NAME> !
I 'll tell you what , though ; my lodger is so black-humoured and gloomy that I believe he 'd as soon make that bargain as any other .
Nor do I recollect its subject .
only don ' t expect me to stand between your mother and you , <NAME> .
<NAME> , dear , make me poor again and take me home !
There was , and is when I write , at the end of that low-lying street , a dilapidated little wooden building , probably an obsolete old ferry-house .
No light feet had pressed it for many , many a day .
' I don ' t know what I am to do. ' ' Don ' t be alarmed , ' said I .
' I never saw so beautiful a face .
Where ' s that rough total , Mr Rugg ?
" Well ! " she went on ; " you have a promising career before you .
We have reason to know by this time that there is no good in it and no hope , that there is nothing to be got from it but sorrow .
" Ca n't be a lawyer , then , " says <NAME> , folding his arms with an air of confirmed resolution .
' If it hadn ' t been for me , I don ' t know what would have become of him. ' What strange creatures we are !
Now move on here , come ! "
Then it flashes upon him .
He re-entered the shed , and shrunk down once more .
I turned him hastily on some pretence , and held him in conversation until it was gone .
' Patience , ' she croaked , laying her hand , like a claw , upon his arm .
' Indeed I am not going to be , my darling ! ' I assured her .
I ' m none the worse for that , am I ? ' ' Not a bit , ' replied <NAME> .
Nothing of this appeared , however .
If you will hear me through a very little more , all you can ever do for me is done .
And <NAME> again relates his experience , again suppressing the half-crown fact .
" In making some alterations , the workmen came upon an old dungeon , which had been , for many years , built up and forgotten .
<NAME> me. ' ' It ' s quite accidental , ' replied <NAME> , greatly perplexed by the curious and unexpected nature of the interview .
As he spoke , he seated himself at the other end of the table , and , throwing off his cloak and cap , disclosed his features .
It was clothed in one simple green robe , or mantle , bordered with white fur .
I owe that to you .
Nor were these the only tokens of dispersal .
And I am bound to bear in mind that I took <NAME> on , at a time when I had no thought of being fashionable or of leaving the Bower .
You must consider yourself in custody , <NAME> . "
<NAME> some of the boys had seen me coming through <NAME> , wayworn and ragged , and should find me out ?
A certain leanness falls upon houses not sufficiently imbued with life ( as if they were nourished upon it ) , which was very noticeable here .
But I may ask you two questions , may I ? '
Mrs <NAME> had been drafted home to the house in town , and <NAME> , now a smart young woman , had come down .
" You two were so close about him that I thought you would like me to be the same , " returns that old bird with a secretly glistening eye .
" He 's in the dining-room , sir , along with mistress .
Comes <NAME> with his large keys , and yawningly unlocks and sets open .
I believe that I began to know that there was something about my aunt , notwithstanding her many eccentricities and odd humours , to be honoured and trusted in .
' How are , you , my lad ? ' replied the <NAME> .
Even cousins may be sorry to part ; and in truth I am very , very sorry , <NAME> , though I know it 's for your welfare .
' I think I do , ' said the gentleman , breaking silence .
Struggles , <NAME> and <NAME> , were , each in his turn , the subject of unqualified eulogium ; and each in due course returned thanks for the honour .
What business was it of old <NAME> ' s more than anybody else ' s ?
That 's the kind of thing for _you_ .
So much the better for you .
You shall go. ' ' I ! ' returned the other .
' How ! ' exclaimed <NAME> , with sublime severity .
Few ways of life were hidden from <NAME> , and he was oftener in its darkest places than even <NAME> .
Both were bleeding and panting and execrating and struggling ; but of course I knew them both directly .
' What do you wish ? ' ' <NAME> ? ' hesitated Mr Dombey .
' I can see your features , godmother , behind the beard. ' ' Does the fancy go to my changing other objects too , <NAME> ? ' ' Ah !
' Wy don ' t you ? ' said <NAME> , urging his question strenuously .
His face was as fiery as ever ; his eyes were as small , and rather deeper set .
He makes it too secure , as it happens .
She 's a Tartar. " " Miss Havisham ? " " I do n't say no to that , but I meant <NAME> .
<NAME> is a stonemason ; chiefly in the gravestone , tomb , and monument way , and wholly of their colour from head to foot .
What ' s your message , Nelly ? ' The child handed him a letter .
You can contemplate your beauty at another time . "
Where are the graces of my soul ?
what are you up to , my dear ? ' said Mr Codlin , raising his head , and yawning .
From these she obtained a lamp , and a direction to the lady ' s room .
Her eyes were so red with waking and crying , that the <NAME> might have winked with greater consistency .
" Nothing but beggar my neighbor , miss. " " Beggar him , " said <NAME> to <NAME> .
<NAME> , ' said I , ' what is the matter ?
' Head , potry -- chapter , literary friends -- name , <NAME> ; ver good .
' Wish you luck , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , touching his hat .
Let me go back. ' ' I swear to you , <NAME> , you shall go directly .
' If I can redeem it , or hope to do so , you know I will. ' ' I am sure you will , ' was the reply .
Then it turned the handle , and went in .
On the haggard face of every man among these prisoners , the same expression sat .
' I suppose the <NAME> folks are rather rough and uncultivated ; that ' s all. ' ' But this person , ' urged Kate .
' It was wrong , ' said the old gentleman in a milder tone , ' very wrong .
You are his little pet , you are his favourite ; he ' ll do anything for you .
" I hear a voice , " says <NAME> ; " is it a still small voice , my friends ?
For old <NAME> 's deportment is very beautiful , you know , <NAME> , " said <NAME> , " and his feelings are extremely sensitive . "
<NAME> smiled with perfect composure , and said she had no doubt of my having been quite right , and of her having been very disagreeable .
' Accommodation , eh ? ' said that gentleman , consulting a large book .
In short , <NAME> , that is the object of my visit .
' Winkle -- Tupman -- I beg your pardon for the observations I made just now .
From which , " said <NAME> , " conjectures had been raised and theories formed .
Another minute , and it was suffused with a crimson flush : and a heavy wildness came over the soft blue eye .
I bred her and educated her , to be loved .
The brothers conferred apart for a short time : their manner showing that they were agitated .
The old man ' s eye was keen with the twinklings of avarice and cunning ; the young man ' s bright with the light of intelligence and spirit .
But neither mode of relief suggested itself to <NAME> ; so he solicited a private audience , and told his father .
Respecting the other certified copy , your wish shall be complied with .
' Nobody would if they did want to , ' said <NAME> .
' I beg and pray that no one will leave the room !
I have travelled out of the record , sir , I am aware , in putting the point to you .
" But really when the time came , and I knew no other ill of him , I was in doubts .
' Hurt his feelings , and lost him his situation. ' ' His feelings ? ' repeated <NAME> disdainfully .
' There ! ' said the dwarf , pulling him in .
The air struck chill and comfortless as it breathed upon him .
" 'She is my sister , <NAME> .
Except in that regard , we are all alike .
' Yes , ' I said , with some importance .
I sold them very willingly .
' I understand you , <NAME> , perfectly .
<NAME> <NAME> , standing on a cushion , surveying through the eye-glass , thus checks off .
He 'd make his fortun ' on the stage that dog would , and rewive the drayma besides . '
' No , <NAME> , ' said the Major , in a severe tone .
<NAME> repeated , as he scrambled out of bed .
I wish you good day , and I hope you 'll do well . "
' My daughter , <NAME> ' -- began Mr Dombey .
And now the void in <NAME> ' s own heart began again , indeed , to make a solitude around her .
' From Mr Garland. ' ' Oh ! ' said <NAME> , with extreme politeness .
Let him be at peace. " But the man continuing to exclaim , " <NAME> , <NAME> ! " the face of <NAME> is for a moment turned towards him .
' I bless the day ! ' said <NAME> .
They won ' t pass that werdick , they won ' t pass it , Sammy. ' And <NAME> shook his head with legal solemnity .
He felt the delicacy of his situation , and modestly replied , ' No. ' ' Are you , sir ? ' inquired <NAME> .
" Your granddaughter I have had the honour of seeing before ; my service to you , miss . "
He instantly jumped up , and it was not the same man , but another man !
' The Game Chicken , ' said Mr Toots .
' Very well , sir , ' said brother Charles .
' Her mother was , and she was poor .
There was one great source of uneasiness in the midst of this good fortune , and that was the having nobody by , to whom she could confide it .
There had been a wind all day ; and it was rising then , with an extraordinary great sound .
My parting love to uncle .
' No , ' said <NAME> , with the sunset very bright upon her .
You know you like this girl . "
I am sure you have enough to do , if that ' s what you want .
The <NAME> gardens blush with ripening fruit .
Nearly three hours of silence passed away .
There was a short pause ; the brandy-and-water had done its work ; the amiable countenance of <NAME> was fast recovering its customary expression .
Who else holds the door sometimes ?
<NAME> keeps her own little carriage now instead of hiring one , and lives full two miles further westward than <NAME> .
I am glad that , thinking I deserve to be thanked , you have come to thank me .
' <NAME> , ' said the magistrate , ' dear me , <NAME> -- pray take a seat -- you can not mean this ?
' I am not quite decided , ' returned Mr Dombey .
It is of my ward .
Then I playfully tried verbal instruction in domestic matters , as we walked about on a Saturday afternoon .
' You are , my love , you know you are ; one breath -- ' said <NAME> , blowing an imaginary feather away .
These were its brief contents : -- " Not wishful to intrude I have departured fur you are well again dear Pip and will do better without JO .
Why should I pause to ask how much of my shrinking from <NAME> might be traced to Estella ?
She filled his glass , put all the little matters on the table ready to his hand , and then sat beside him while he ate his supper .
' There ' s the light of her fire. ' ' I ' ll take a peep through the window , ' said <NAME> .
' All I ' ve got to say is , that it ' s well for you that the diwision of labour has been what it has been .
<NAME> , my lords and gentlemen .
Then we sits down , gradually gets cool , and holds a confabulation .
<NAME> coloured deeply , breathed quickly for a few moments , and then walked on with a firmer and more determined step .
<NAME> <NAME> objected to it very strong , and he is a good lodger , though his temper has been hard tried . "
<NAME> upon the ground , clinging to him , calling to him , folding her hands , praying to him .
There must be a splendid operation , though , to-morrow -- magnificent sight if <NAME> does it. ' ' You consider <NAME> a good operator ? ' said <NAME> .
But however that may be , <NAME> is gone .
" Why , get along with you , " said she to my guardian , " what do you mean ?
These latter words were addressed to <NAME> , who was sitting nearest to him .
" You know I do n't intend to be responsible .
For anything I knew , his animosity towards the man might otherwise lead to his seeking him out and rushing on his own destruction .
And what does this allusion to the slow coach mean ?
' I was dreaming at a great rate , and am glad to be disturbed from an indigestive after-dinner sleep .
I ' ll get a chaise at the <NAME> , and follow ' em instantly .
The wreck , even to my unpractised eye , was breaking up .
<NAME> as he was , however , he had sense enough to make a feint of feeling great regret at going away .
' No , R. W. Lavinia has not known the trial that <NAME> has known .
" It 's me , " returns the old man of the house , whose breath is in his ear .
Maddening church bells of all degrees of dissonance , sharp and flat , cracked and clear , fast and slow , made the brick-and-mortar echoes hideous .
' <NAME> ! ' said I , as civilly as I could , after a silence .
' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , smacking his lips , ' I hardly know , now .
'Well , you need n't be so cross , ' said his companion .
<NAME> <NAME> gently reasoned with him as he made a little drawing of his head on the fly-leaf of a book .
My dear young men , be easy with me , if you please .
I don ' t mean to say that I deserve to be the pride and delight of his life -- you believe me , I know -- but I am .
It is a broadsword to an oyster-knife .
' What , old Nobs ! ' ejaculated the son .
" Quite so , " says <NAME> with a calm nod .
' I knew you was a-going to say so .
It ' s a part of my character .
The day is then just breaking .
It ' s not much to bear .
Certainly not , my dear <NAME> , most assuredly not .
" Not much of a one , sir .
' I must go , ' she said at last , rising as she spoke .
I meant to have given you five shillings this morning for a Christmas box , <NAME> .
' Yes , sir , ' rejoined <NAME> .
The owners of such places as <NAME> , " said <NAME> with his usual happy and easy air , " are public benefactors .
Have you had many brothers , <NAME> ? "
Mr <NAME> ordered his carriage to be ready early in the morning that he might wait upon Mr Dorrit immediately after breakfast .
' Think better of him than to suppose it .
That concerned myself ; this concerns us all. ' ' Us all !
' Very great indeed , ' said Mr Dombey .
Much better to think of dead than alive , <NAME> !
I tell you , ' returned <NAME> , waving his hand in deprecation of any further wrath ; ' I wasn ' t in earnest .
' <NAME> dramatised stories which had previously appeared in print , it is true , ' observed <NAME> .
You keep half an eye on the newspapers , and I should n't wonder if you was to read something about it before long , if you look sharp .
But if he had cut the end of his nose off , he would have put a piece of sticking-plaister over it , and been quite satisfied .
As I told him yes , he laid it on the table , and resting his head upon his hand , began .
The servant-maids felt her inferiority , for they were better treated ; free to come and go , and regarded in their stations with much more respect .
<NAME> shook her head , and sighed .
It was no other than <NAME> who gave me this piece of intelligence .
" Not personally , <NAME> , " said <NAME> ; " merely through his solicitors , Messrs. <NAME> and <NAME> , of <NAME> .
A few lawyers ' clerks and others who know this suitor by sight linger on the chance of his furnishing some fun and enlivening the dismal weather a little .
He could n't say how long he might be , having a case on .
By your leave ! ' said <NAME> , knuckling his forehead , with a chuckle and a leer .
His gorgeousness was not unmixed with dirt ; and both in complexion and consistency he had suffered from the closeness of his pantry .
Shall I tell you what I think ?
It ain ' t because I ' m a servant and you ' re a master , that you ' re to go and libel me .
Neither of the three served or saved me .
The marine-store merchant holds the light , and the law-stationer conducts the search .
Then he stops , and with more of those inarticulate sounds , lifts up his eyes and seems to stare at something .
Advancing more and more into the shadow of this mournful place , its dark depressing influence stole upon their spirits , and filled them with a dismal gloom .
I ' d die degraded , as I had lived .
" Now lookee here , <NAME> , " said the man , turning quickly round upon him and tapping him on the breast with a large forefinger .
I spoke unkindly to him , and he can not bear it from me .
The light porter placed the tea-tray on it , knuckling his forehead as a form of homage .
Is mine less hard to bear or is it harder to bear , when my whole living was in it and has been thus shamefully sucked away ? "
It is longer than a travelling breakfast with us ; more orderly , and more polite .
" But , my dear , " she said , gaily , reaching another hand to put it upon mine .
He was so full of feeling too and had such a delicate sentiment for what was beautiful or tender that he could have won a heart by that alone .
Of her soon cheering up again , and our signing the register all round .
<NAME> was to be married to-morrow .
<NAME> , stop him for <NAME> 's sake , were it only in mercy !
We began to talk about my aunt ' s losses , and I told them what I had tried to do that morning .
His intention was rapidly communicated .
He has never uttered her name , since .
' Let ' s get back to the dodgerest of the dodgers , ' said he .
' " Pounds , shillings , and pence , " is my next note .
And he wears it , too , round his neck , I can tell you !
He looked out of the window -- it was very dark .
' Keep close to me all day .
It shall make me better . "
She , who so gloried in my fame , and so looked forward to its augmentation , well knew that I would labour on .
' You ain ' t poor , you know , <NAME> , as you pretend .
'That boy will be hung , ' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat .
Now , are you right there ? "
My Lady reclines in her chair composedly , though with a trifle less of graceful ease than usual perhaps , and never falters in her steady gaze .
' I mean I ' ll tell you nothing. ' Mr <NAME> sparkled at him , but frowned at him too .
She was right touching his destination .
I am tempted now to go away .
' Thank you , I would rather not , ' replied that gentleman .
I was going to remonstrate .
The earth shook when he walked -- he was so very stout .
' I ' ll step out by and by , <NAME> .
No , no ! ' As <NAME> says these latter words , he shakes his head , knowingly , and laughs again .
" <NAME> , " remonstrates <NAME> with his utmost severity .
' Here I am. ' ' Here you are , sir , ' assented Mr Venus .
" Then we may dismiss him for the present .
The old clergyman was present .
At least you shall not be wronged .
He must be very bad there , poor gentleman ! ' <NAME> ' s sympathy is such that she can scarcely speak .
Another surgeon then coming in , the two exchanged a whisper , and the second took the hand .
Receive me as your domestic , and I will serve you well .
So glad you came that day !
' The smallest encouragement thankfully received .
Whisper. ' Mr <NAME> whispered , ' <NAME> ' s Bower. ' ' <NAME> !
When I can ' t meet his daughter , I go where I am likely to meet him .
" -- That the friend with whom he had formerly been staying there was Mr .
I don ' t know , ' said the jolly old gentleman ; ' all very natural , I dare say -- nothing unusual .
I determined to ask <NAME> why he had ever taught me to call those picture-cards <NAME> , which ought to be called knaves .
I told him all about it and how her first entreaties had referred to his forgiveness .
An undeniable boy for a pupil-teacher ; an undeniable boy to do credit to the master who should bring him on .
' What ! ' cried the old woman , her nodding head bridling with a ghastly vanity .
I SAID hope , I think !
My anything ; pet -- secretary -- messenger -- I do n't know what . "
On the contrary , I saw him next moment , once more holding out both his hands to me .
Again he paused near the sisters ' house , and again he entered by the postern .
D'Aulnais is the name of his mother 's family. " <NAME> knitted steadily , but the intelligence had a palpable effect upon her husband .
' Not in intention -- no no , ' said he .
<NAME> , lying on the sofa in his room , playing the flute a little , was enchanted to see me .
The men were very ill-looking .
I says to myself , 'If I ai n't a gentleman , nor yet ai n't got no learning , I 'm the owner of such .
Am I to call in any assistance , or is the trick done ? "
He had seen it , with the expression of last night , timidly pleading to him .
It ' s quite private. ' ' Uncle Sol ! ' faltered <NAME> .
And he and <NAME> stood together , looking down with compassion on him .
' There is the inexpiable offence against my adoration of you .
He thrust his head out of the coach window at intervals , and bawled out to know why they didn ' t go faster .
I hope she is in no affliction ?
My Lady , do you object to the twilight ? "
Nothing national is exhibited for money ; and no public officer is a showman .
His mouth was such a post-office of a mouth that he had a mechanical appearance of smiling .
I should like to be able to say a word or two to my clerk just now .
There ' s nothing I should like better , but I must remain with these two fellows .
' Three ten and one ten is five .
You 're in the habit of shaking hands ? " I was rather confused , thinking it must be out of the <NAME> fashion , but said yes .
' There was , further , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> .
' Come nearer here , my dear Miss !
I observed <NAME> and <NAME> , when they first met ; and the impression made upon me then was not agreeable .
Last night , on being childishly solicited for twopence , to buy ' lemon-stunners ' -- a local sweetmeat -- he presented an oyster-knife at the twins !
<NAME> your eyes , sir , and let me take hold of your chin .
The <NAME> glided on into a street .
He led them into a stone kitchen , fitted with coppers for dressing the prison food , and pointed to a door .
He was <NAME> ' s unfortunate brother , to her , and nothing more .
Might I ask you why he made it ? ' <NAME> burst into tears .
<NAME> , may the present moment be the least unhappy of our lives .
" Here 's something to eat , poor boy , " says <NAME> .
She falls from the lowermost stair , and is swallowed up in the gulf .
The disregarded parrot only was in action .
' You run about the brink , and run across it , in this uncertain light , on a few inches width of rotten wood , ' said he .
<NAME> well , I ' m agreeable : I can ' t say no fairer than that , can I , sir ? ' ( <NAME> smiled . )
' I am , ' repeated the Dodger .
Loose then stabbed <NAME> with one of those never-failing weapons , a bowie-knife .
' Surely that must content you !
We do our best to polish -- polish -- polish ! "
At that point the object of his affections shut him up like a box with a spring lid , and sent him away .
I should say he knew nothing about her and had never seen her , so HE can give me no information .
She does her best to destroy my fortunes and her own , and she won ' t reproach me !
" I came to take these babies down to my room for an hour , " he said , going to them again , " and let them play about .
How often have I inquired for you , and been told that I should hear before long ! ' ' I know , I know ! ' returned <NAME> .
" I inquired because , coming from <NAME> , I of course have not yet been in town , and I thought some letters might have been sent down here .
You do look uncommon well , to be sure. ' <NAME> acknowledged the compliment , and cordially shook hands with the stout gentleman in the top-boots .
' That ' s it. ' ' What ' s it ? ' said <NAME> .
We took our leave early , and left together .
asked the doctor , following the young lady to the sideboard .
He wandered over them again .
<NAME> to see you , Sir. ' ' Thank ' ee. ' <NAME> emptied his glass , and placed the bottle on the coach-box , by his side .
Here 's her allowance of bread , and here 's her slice of cheese , and here 's her rum , -- which I drink .
<NAME> ? ' said <NAME> as he smoked .
I will address your mother , sir , who knows the world. ' ' Ah !
<NAME> <NAME> asks , conveying the expression of an artist into the turn of his eye and head .
She saw she had no father upon earth , and ran out , orphaned , from his house .
And very well indeed you are looking , Mrs .
' If <NAME> were a younger man , there ' s not a woman in the world whom he ' d prefer for Mrs Bagstock to that woman .
' Please ! ' ' He ' s enough to break his mother ' s heart , is this boy , ' said <NAME> , half appealing to <NAME> .
' And your vocation , <NAME> , may really demand this suit and service .
" I have not heard the particulars of my sister 's death , Biddy. " " They are very slight , poor thing .
My name is <NAME> , -- <NAME> Toots. ' The <NAME> remembered to have seen this young gentleman at the wedding , and made him a bow .
<NAME> , too , poor wandering shipwrecked boy , oh , where is he ?
I was very hot indeed upon <NAME> 's daring to admire her ; as hot as if it were an outrage on myself .
" Very well ; then you may go .
Thou knowest who said , " Let him who is without sin among you cast the first stone at her ! " There have been plenty to do that .
Bless you , my dear Sir , such a thing was never heard of , without a consultation fee being previously paid , and a consultation fixed .
' My secret was out ; and my only struggle now was for liberty and freedom .
I made acquaintance with an <NAME> railroad , on this occasion , for the first time .
' Lodgings ; up near Mr <NAME> ' s , ' returned <NAME> .
' Is there ony genelmen there as can len ' a hond here ?
The door opened , and a group of little children bounded out , shouting and romping .
They were two men who were seated in easy attitudes upon the grass , and so busily engaged as to be at first unconscious of intruders .
Then I don ' t know what it is , I am sure. ' ' What should you say to a young lady from <NAME> ? ' inquired <NAME> .
Whenever the sound reached his ears , he would immediately lay down his pen and fall to rubbing his hands and exhibiting the greatest glee .

Put on these clothes of mine .
There were three or four of us , counting me .
" I can guarantee that there is no secrecy in it .
She lay bereft of animation for hours ; and when life , look , and speech returned , her senses had deserted her , and she raved wildly and furiously .
' Lift him up , ' said <NAME> .
" But he might , you know .
" She died a woman , " said the <NAME> , " and had , as I think , children . "
I know his ways , and the likely nooks he favours .
It fell to <NAME> now , to be not quite certain how to answer .
Of my friend <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' who is a man of remarkable shrewdness , I desire to speak with all possible respect .
<NAME> <NAME> naturally asked why not ?
<NAME> <NAME> went down to let him in , and he said on entering , ' Affery , I am glad it ' s you .
You say the suit is changing me ; <NAME> says it changes , has changed , and will change everybody who has any share in it .
I am very glad to be so .
<NAME> , that class of practitioners would be swept from the face of the earth .
It describes her rapid mental growth and improvement during twelve months more , and brings her little history down to the end of last year .
<NAME> night , <NAME> ! ' On awaking in the morning , <NAME> became conscious , by slow degrees , of whispering voices in his room .
' I so hate him for saying it ! ' ' For saying what , my dear ? ' laughed <NAME> .
-- ' But I object to it , and that ' s enough .
' The gentleman took my card .
Then he slowly released his left hand from its pocket , and made that bush of his whiskers , still contemplating him in silence .
Having given in a hearty shake , he retired , growling , under a form ; just escaping the pewter measure which <NAME> levelled at his head .
<NAME> men passed above his head , and rose and rose ; but he was always at the bottom .
That may be eccentricity , or he may be proud of his legs .
The venerable baron caught his child to his arms , and shed a wink of joy .
' I do n't know what that means , ' replied <NAME> .
He had changed , himself , since then .
But my poor young cousins ! "
To consider , wrong as he was , that he could care so much for her , and that she had the power to move him so !
Do you know whether they 've sold the prize <NAME> that was hanging up there ? -- Not the little prize <NAME> : the big one ? "
There were no shortcomings anywhere , in anything but money .
' Good ! ' said Mr Meagles , cheerily .
For instance , it 's your object to take care of number one -- meaning yourself . '
' Because I have no other resting-place , ' was the reply .
'It is useless , ' said the gentleman , with a sigh .
Our little room was like a ship 's cabin , and that delighted Charley very much .
The peaceful serenity of the hour and place , having no reproaches or evil intentions within her breast to contend against , sank healingly into its depths .
asked <NAME> , hesitating as though he feared to vex the other man by being too sanguine .
<NAME> <NAME> had not yet sufficiently recovered the recollection of his evidence at the trial , to make any observation on any subject , so <NAME> paused in vain .
<NAME> to change the brooding mind , or raise it up .
He was stopped by his mouth being full of blood , and <NAME> had brought him home .
Though he is not acquainted with the name , I can help you to it .
She knew ( she said ) how such a nature as mine would turn affliction to good .
The old man , never bidden to sit down , stood with an earnest hand laid on the back of the young man ' s easy chair .
He has shown nothing but his shell .
But , I would not take it away while he was present .
We had not driven very far from our lodgings when we stopped in a by-street at a public-looking place lighted up with gas .
' Light-headed , aunt ! ' I could only repeat this daring speculation with the same kind of feeling with which I had repeated the preceding question .
'Not now , ' said the Jew , turning softly away .
You ' re very welcome I ' m sure. -- Mr <NAME> , sir -- ' <NAME> , who had by this time reached the door , turned round .
On coming back with the wine in his hand , he found that she had placed her father in his easy chair , and had loosened his shirt and neckcloth .
' Sit close to the fire , father , dear , while I cook your breakfast .
But matters were no sooner in this state , than he devoted all his spare time ( and got up earlier to make it more ) to these perambulations .
<NAME> <NAME> softly opens the door of communication between that room and the next and looks in .
The old sexton soon got better , and was about again .
' Well ! ' he said , looking to his bag , ' having seen you tonight , <NAME> ' r <NAME> ( and that doos me good !
Little Alick in a frock has already made arrangements for his union with a suitable young person at <NAME> .
' <NAME> ' t take on , old lady. ' ' But I can ' t bear to see you so , my dear. ' ' Nonsense !
So I break my staunch resolution , and think it may be , perhaps , as well to go to bed .
The institution never flagged for want of a story , I am certain ; and the wine lasted out almost as well as the matter .
You ask her to kneel at this bedside and be married to you , that your reparation may be complete .
Who moved uneasily on his feet , rubbed his beard a little , and at length said : " Well !
If he ' s forgotten ' em , they ' ll soon remind him .
extraordinary indeed , ' rejoined <NAME> , taking a complacent pinch of snuff , and shaking his head gravely .
You have only to choose a trade , <NAME> , and be it .
There is nothing of chance or doubt in the course before my son .
No , no , no , ' said <NAME> , shaking her head , and folding her arms ; ' not she , my dear .
We shall meet no more .
<NAME> stole over her at last ; her grasp relaxed , tightened , relaxed again , and they slept side by side .
What have you got to say ?
' Wo-o ! ' cried <NAME> , as the tall quadruped evinced a decided inclination to back into the coffee-room window .
And you recollect <NAME> , that wath thought to be rather thweet upon yourthelf ?
Some of the <NAME> ' s brethren had found themselves exceedingly uncomfortable in their minds , because they were required to bury the dead too hopefully .
He inquired , as he pointed to <NAME> , 'Do you know that person ? '
' Just about there. ' ' Does anybody open them , and shut them ?
' Well then , what ' s the matter , <NAME> ? ' said <NAME> , coaxingly .
' Ladies and gentlemen , ' said <NAME> , suddenly rising .
" <NAME> took it easy as a good riddance for both sides .
In this order they reached the magistrate ' s house ; the chairmen trotting , the prisoners following , <NAME> oratorising , and the crowd shouting .
<NAME> <NAME> , <NAME> , I should have lost the weapon .
" Your remembrance does me more honour than I had supposed it would , <NAME> , " he returned .
<NAME> by step , onward and downward , towards some end , yet so gradually , that she believed herself to remain motionless .
Next door at the back. ' ' O , ' returned <NAME> .
it were well to die , indeed , at such a time !
As he did so , <NAME> very hastily drew back .
replied the young lady : drawing her chair up to the table , and putting her elbows upon it .
And what are the young couple saying as they leave the church , and go out at the gate ?
' And then there ' s that woman with the <NAME> name , ' said my aunt , ' that <NAME> , she goes and gets married next .
<NAME> gave me some more gravy .
" Why , you see , my dears , " said Mrs. Badger , " -- you 'll excuse me calling you my dears ? "
Away in the moonlight lie the woodland fields at rest , and the wide house is as quiet as the narrow one .

We all do it in one way or another .
It is called The Thorn of <NAME> .
<NAME> drew his breath yet more freely , and looked round with a smile of triumph .
<NAME> ' t let me detain you , sir ; I stand in need of no assistance , I thank you .
Well , but I 'll answer you .
' So much humour , ' said <NAME> .
And <NAME> and <NAME> entered accordingly .
' No , I wasn ' t , sir ! ' cried <NAME> .
But that ' s just the way !
<NAME> <NAME> came to the gate , and positively reeled back when she saw me so changed ; her walnut-shell countenance likewise turned from brown to green and yellow .
' A good man , ' said the grandfather , looking after him ; ' a kind man .
I only ask to be free .
' No , my lady lass , ' returned the <NAME> .
' Good-bye ! ' said <NAME> , giving both his hands .
After a time he rose and rang the bell .
' There were five of us , ' returned his partner .
He then went on to tell her where Mr <NAME> was lying , and to request that a carriage might be placed at his disposal to bring him home .
Presently I saw his blue lips again , breathing on the tinder , and then a flare of light flashed up , and showed me <NAME> .
" He is called , I believe -- an -- ironmaster . "
<NAME> ! ' ( <NAME> was quite a rustic place to <NAME> . )
With a clink for the stout , -- Old Clem ! " I thought he had been drinking , but he was not drunk .

I know what I know .
" He IS the most wonderful creature !
You conspirators , and hiders , and runners-away , should know better than that .
I am quite bewildered by all this .
Em ' ly ' s alive ! ' He put his hand down firmly on the table , and set his sunburnt face into a resolute expression .
But he will perish ; there is no real hope. " " Yes .
I said to <NAME> this would be one of the great <NAME> 's boats now , and we stopped to look .
don ' t stare at me , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> ; ' I recollect your words last night , <NAME> .
Yet he 's like you , there 's no denying .
Last night , I went home .
" I saw one of <NAME> 's long effusions , I think ? "
<NAME> of your own strength now .
A. <NAME> , <NAME> , one pound .
<NAME> some bread and butter , <NAME> ; that ' s a love .
Her carriage towards <NAME> was as a carriage towards a young lady of good position , whom she had met in society a few years ago .
It was the Chief <NAME> .
' Yes , yes , he has , <NAME> , ' said the boy , reddening and laughing .
When he has walked out , <NAME> , in a great perspiration , nerves himself to the hasty completion of the taking down of the <NAME> , concluding with <NAME> .
<NAME> ' s servant ! ' said Mrs. <NAME> , turning pale .
' Leave go , I tell you ! ' thundered his master .
We had started from <NAME> at three o ' clock in the afternoon , and we were due in <NAME> about eight next morning .
' Two or three year older than <NAME> ' ly , but was at the school with her. ' ' I never heard her name , ' said I .
Swear it was not true ?
' You ' ll have no conception of the value of your prize until you draw close to it .
' Will you do as I do , <NAME> , my boy ? ' inquired his father , returning to his tea with new strength .
This became the purpose of her life .
I am very glad to do so. " " Glad to part again , <NAME> ?
' Only us two , ' said the man .
<NAME> , for the instant , lost its lustre in his eyes , for there were countless treasures of the heart which it could never purchase .
I ' ll give you a clue to my trade , in a game of forfeits .
You and your father and who else there may be of you ? ' asked <NAME> , speaking deliberately , and meditatively turning the watch over and over .
Call it madness , and I tell you I ca n't help it now , and ca n't be sane .
<NAME> taking no notice , the door was at length softly opened , and the dried face of a mild little elderly gentleman looked in .
" And you can refuse , you mean , eh ?
He has n't come home since the morning , so he may go without 'em .
I can understand what you tell me , so very much better than what I read in law-writings .
As long as her poor dear pretty was above the ground , she said , she would never desert her .
As the countenance of the stout lady began to clear up , she ventured to inquire how far it was .
' Vith the bills for the lease , and that , there ' s eleven hundred and eighty pound here .
' I told you , the last time you were here with a grievance , that you had better turn about and come out of that .

I have impressed upon <NAME> during many years , that I must have my meals ( for instance ) punctually .
I never heard of any. ' At this point of the dialogue <NAME> came in with a light step .
If I only had him here -- ' ' Oh Quilp ! ' said his wife , ' what ' s the matter ?
Whether it was done in good time , or not , will be seen hereafter .
We cut over the fields at the back , with him between us -- straight as the crow flies -- through hedge and ditch .
A very good school it is , and handsomely supported by this family . "
' And pilfering , mother ? ' ' Sometimes , <NAME> -- in a very small way .
Let me thank you for so considerately yielding to my disinclination .
I know that she forgives me , and is sorry in her heart .
The stimulant is <NAME> ' s voice .
Quarrelled and hinted about it .
As for <NAME> del <NAME> there , you would judge for yourself ; if it were not his later manner , the question was , Who was it ?

" Now , mind how you put it , <NAME> , " cried the old man anxiously with his hand at his ear .
' For all time to come ? ' asked <NAME> .
Where did you see her ?
The cant of the lying world is , that men like me compass our riches by dissimulation and treachery : by fawning , cringing , and stooping .
He then gave him another blow on the head , just to stun him till he came back again .
Though he thought them far too slight , he said , for such a service .

The whole composition before him , when he stood where he had stood last night , was clearly discernible in its minutest details .
His lordship gave me an indulgent look and acknowledged my curtsy very graciously .
<NAME> <NAME> , <NAME> , has had a fit -- apoplexy or paralysis -- and could n't be brought to , and precious time has been lost .

" <NAME> notice , guard , -- he tried to murder me , " were his first words .

Tables laid in the yard .
<NAME> <NAME> was always remarkable for extreme humanity .
" Bless your soul and body , no , " answered <NAME> , very drily .
How do you know ? ' ' <NAME> , sir , he was Pitching into our people the other day in the most tremendous manner .
The <NAME> are now dead .
Oh ! ' The pleasure of this discovery called up the old doglike smile in full force .

His face , his voice , his manner , all showed that too plainly .
'To the kind gentleman , and the dear old nurse , who took so much care of me before , ' rejoined <NAME> .
She became utterly and completely miserable .

cried the lady , ' I have been so dreadfully put out ! '
' <NAME> won ' t be long , ' said <NAME> .
<NAME> , <NAME> , let me know what my crime is , will you ? ' The stricken Grinder wept , and put his coat-cuff in his eye .

But the agony of mind , the remorse , and shame I felt when I became conscious next day !
You have got good measure , <NAME> What-is-it. ' ' Try Jenny , ' suggested that young lady with great calmness .
His constant height is of a piece with his immense abilities .
The little people could do nothing without dear <NAME> .

It would be hard , indeed , to part you now .
<NAME> ' t judge him , sir , as you would judge others outside the gates .
He saw that she was desperate , and that her unquenchable hatred of him would stop at nothing .
I am glad to hear you do .
<NAME> and he were very different now , he said , and very happy .

But he is not to be spoken of if you please .
When I awoke next morning , I was resolute to declare my passion to <NAME> , and know my fate .
Drawers , desks , pockets , all things belonging to him , <NAME> examines .
I have sat alone and unnoticed , half an evening , while he conversed with his young cousin , my pupil .
Next evening , down come <NAME> and my Lady with their largest retinue , and down come the cousins and others from all the points of the compass .
I leave them to you , at your desire .
I knew its tender nature very well .
A man of your mark ! ' ' It ' s not so much saying it that I object to , ' returned Mr Venus , ' as doing it .
Our friend <NAME> -- do n't be alarmed ! -- is arrested for debt . "
I am dismissed ! ' She looked as little shocked and as hopeful as she could , but it was distressing news , for many reasons .
The country round <NAME> is surpassingly and exquisitely picturesque .
So saying , he unlocks his door , gropes his way into his murky rooms , lights his candles , and looks about him .
" Is he dead ? " I asked , after a silence .
It was a public holiday , and <NAME> did not recover his spirits or his usual temperature of nose until the afternoon .
Nor were there wanting objects in the crowd itself to give new point and purpose to the shifting scene .

Therefore Mrs <NAME> asked no questions , and showed no curiosity .
" He is called among the neighbours the <NAME> .
Do you deserve your blessings ?
' <NAME> likely , ' replied <NAME> briefly .

But water [ ' specially when ' tis salt ) comes nat ' ral to me ; and friends is dear , and I am heer .
I may be wrong , but I have formed that opinion. ' Both Traddles and I applauded it highly .
Her face was hidden from his view , but <NAME> could see that she was weeping .
I was articled to <NAME> and <NAME> .
" Do it yourself , " returned the friend rather tartly .
<NAME> you good-night , Mrs. <NAME> .
My stall and I are for ever parted .
" Is my benefactor to be made known to me to-day ? " " No .
You will like to make some change , perhaps ?
There ain ' t so much in that , you ' ll say .
Little Em ' ly had stopped and looked up at the sky in her enumeration of these articles , as if they were a glorious vision .
A somewhat difficult feat , achieved with great dexterity , and with a prodigious splash .
You know her. ' ' I remember , ' said his companion carelessly .
But , for example , the sprightly little woman was very sure of it , she said .
" Little woman , " said he , " You have been crying . "
Behave yourself to visitors , my lady !
I was not sure you had a workman of your own here , my dear friend , or we need n't have employed this person . "
The trooper then takes from his breast-pocket a folded paper , which he lays with an unwilling hand at the lawyer 's elbow .
This has been a bad business , and may be worse , if we delay a moment .
Can you follow me , <NAME> ?
" And something else supports me , <NAME> . "
" Write exactly as I speak. " " To whom do I address it ? " " To no one. " <NAME> still had his hand in his breast .
But you ' ll never go on with it , ' said number four .
If I should prowl about the streets a long time , do n't be uneasy ; I shall reappear in the morning .
It was the first of their proceedings which had no heartiness .
At the stairs where we had taken him abroad , and ever since , I had looked warily for any token of our being suspected .

I ' m generally to be found here , gentlemen , but if I ' m not here , or over the way , that ' s my address .
' Not at all , ' said <NAME> .
We can do so , undismayed .
He winked -- winked openly and undisguisedly ; winked with his right eye -- upon <NAME> !
Her first proceeding there was to unlock a tall press , bring out several bottles , and pour some of the contents of each into my mouth .
'What if he turns against the others ? '
And then I know what would happen .
' I wonder whether THEY can hear it , ' said <NAME> .
Shall I tell you about the second time I saw her ?
I see her face now , better than I did then , I dare say , with its indelible look of regret and wonder turned upon me .
' I believe that he loves me , fully as much as I love him. ' ' Oh , what happiness ! ' exclaimed <NAME> .
With no consciousness of having moved , she gained the door .
There is no look of decent comfort anywhere .
Mr Wrayburn , I have had a bitter trial to-night , and I hope you will not think me ungrateful , or mysterious , or changeable .
He was a grotesque , fantastic figure , and the few bystanders laughed .
We must have that bottle. ' ' Why , you wouldn ' t take it by force ? ' said <NAME> , restraining him .
He rubbed it into my mouth and up my nose and down my throat -- Ow !
There were the hedgerows where the brother and sister had so often gathered wild flowers together , and the green fields and shady paths where they had so often strayed .

Most of the theatres keep an author on purpose. ' ' Indeed ! ' cried <NAME> .
' There , my dear ! ' said Mr Boffin when they came in to supper .
Fingers and toes. ' ' He pays well , I hope ? ' said <NAME> .
Her golden hair , which she wore in long curls , had been hurriedly pushed aside , and fell down over her neck .
' You would like to be a lady ? ' I said .
" <NAME> left us at a week 's notice .

You found him secret ? ' returns <NAME> , with a greedy relish .
I thought the simple confidence reposed in us by <NAME> and by himself , was , in itself , affecting .
' You see those two old houses , ' he said at last .
<NAME> of parents , devoid of relations , devoid of flocks and herds , devoid of gold and silver and of precious stones .
Anything. ' ' I don ' t like it , ' pettishly returned <NAME> as before .
I shall go down into <NAME> afterwards. ' ' Shooting , sir ? ' said the coachman .
Among the number was one stout , red-faced , elderly man , in particular , seated in an opposite box , who attracted <NAME> ' s attention .

' There ' ll shortly be an end of <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , threatening it with the hat-box .
' HE was a long time , ' replied <NAME> .
He has been so careless and said so much that he never meant .
I almost think he did .
His altered character had never been so grossly marked .

<NAME> on making one last effort to redeem her character , she breaks from Mr Toots and runs away to find the coach , and show a parting smile .
'Have I the lady 's promise for that ? '
' The talent of the other three is principally in combat and serious pantomime .
In moments of confidence too ?
' I said mine , didn ' t I ? ' returned <NAME> .

' You see , ' said Mr Toots , ' what I wanted in a wife was -- in short , was sense .
And , what is very strange , I found him -- " " Not to be any out-of-the-way person , I am afraid ! "
It appears to me , Mr <NAME> , that you yourself are too often and too much in that direction , that direction .

I forgive her , if I have any cause .
' How are the mighty fallen ! ' remarks <NAME> .
' But you don ' t surely mean to walk all the way back ? ' ' Oh , no , ' rejoined Mrs. Nickleby .

Here <NAME> recommended his master and <NAME> to seat themselves , while he reconnoitred , and ascertained whether <NAME> was yet in waiting .

" Middling , " replies <NAME> , taking a chair .
<NAME> <NAME> is not in a common way .
He was dressed for the pantomimes in all the absurdity of a clown ' s costume .
When he heard the step behind him , he turned round -- for he was walking away in the dark .
' This is a joyful occasion indeed , extremely joyful .
In this latter establishment there were two curious cases .
But dear me , I beg your pardon , you 're holding the fruit all this time .
<NAME> <NAME> answers , " Not exactly . "
<NAME> had come in , and we held a very serious council by the fire .
' The lady of the house , my dear , ' returned the <NAME> , in a gruff whisper , and making signals of secrecy .
There is only one outside passenger , and he sits upon the box .
In a little while he came .
This was all very pleasant and ingenious , but the system of forcing was attended with its usual disadvantages .
On Nicholas stopping to salute them , <NAME> laughed a scornful laugh , and made some general remark touching the natural history of puppies .
' What do you mean by that , <NAME> ? ' said <NAME> , with great asperity .
' That young <NAME> ' s had a fever. ' ' No ! ' exclaimed <NAME> .
' I begin to be afraid he ' s going at the knees. ' ' That ' s a bad look-out , ' said <NAME> .
' Where is there one of my size , you dog ? ' returned <NAME> .
I was not the man to touch the <NAME> , and bring down the country .
' You can go up to Mr Fledgeby as soon as you like , ' said the lady , moving haughtily away .
and why they talk instead of grunting ?
At this remark the face of Mr <NAME> gloomed considerably .
He trembled very much though ; for , even in his terror , <NAME> could see that the knife quivered in the air .
' Yes , ' replied <NAME> , ' we tried ' em at our table when they first come , but we couldn ' t keep ' em .
' Do you think he had planned this robbery , when he went with you to the lodging ? ' ' I fear so , father .
I am neither ; I am wretched .
Not till we give you leave .
The people stand out of the way to let her go by .
In the morning , he was up betimes , and went straight to his bench and to work .
<NAME> , price , quality , were of no account .
You are not Mr Merdle , any more than I am. ' ' No , sir , ' the Defaulter would reply .
With this , he retired ; and he had not retired two minutes , when he returned with <NAME> and his hopeful son .
I want him , when he comes home , to find no trouble in my face .
While he was thus employed , the closed eyes opened , and on the pale face there came a placid smile .
Mrs. Snagsby sees it all .
' Now jump into bed again , or you ' ll catch the rheumatics .
' Am I honoured by your instructions to mention as much to the gentleman , as I pass out ?
It ' s that dull glow near it , coming and going , that I mean .
He was pale and seemed agitated .
Else why have to do with you at all ?
<NAME> ' t let her have to look back to yours , as the event from which to date a happier life .
The washing accommodations were primitive .
" I 'll say anythink as you say , sir , for I knows it 's good . "
The hull of a ship !
'Well , then , look here , ' continued <NAME> .
Her father did not know -- she held to it from that time -- how much she loved him .
In another moment , <NAME> was in the arms of the weather-beaten pea-coat .
I may mention at once that this became an annual custom .
With another class of customers , <NAME> was again another man .
I passed the day in a ditch , and the night in a pigsty .
In proof of his really being the person he represented himself , <NAME> laid upon the table the papers he had brought to town .
Then came the chemist and druggist , with other tabular statements , showing that when they didn ' t get drunk , they took opium .
They had an infant with them , and had laid it down asleep upon a child ' s grave , in a little bed of leaves .
Would you do an old man that good turn , sir ? "
It affected us to see <NAME> clinging , then , to her deplorable home and hanging on her mother 's neck with the greatest tenderness .
She then hastily attired herself for walking , and leaving word that she should return within a couple of hours , hurried away towards her uncle ' s house .
Never again. ' ' She ' s very sensitive , ' said <NAME> , looking after her .
They suggested quiet places afar off , and rest , and peace .
At length the signal was given , and all the ring leaned forward .

LET us strike the key-note again , before pursuing the tune .
" Do not forget. " The initials of those words are within here now , and were within here then .
At length , and at last , the assembly left off shouting , but <NAME> being voted into the chair , they underwent a relapse which lasted five minutes .
He will be very glad. ' ' Very glad , ' said Mr Meagles , coming forward with his wife and <NAME> .
Why , this here old lady next me is a-drowndin ' herself in tea. ' Be quiet , can ' t you ? ' murmured <NAME> .
' It ' ll stand you in a pound a week .
' Come again ! ' ' Not <NAME> yet , ' returned the lady , with a serious smile , as she encircled <NAME> ' s neck with her arm .
Truly , it looked as gloomy that night as even it had ever looked .
He made nothing of the people about him as he tramped on , staring over their heads into the body of the court .
It was a habit with <NAME> , whenever he became thoughtful , to put his hands in his breeches pockets .
If dear Fanny were a Dombey ! -- But I daresay she ' ll make it ; I have no doubt she ' ll make it .
I developed her into what she is , that she might be loved .
The crisis ! ' He had sauntered far enough .
<NAME> got up from the table , making as if she had forgotten something , and went into the next room ; and I heard her sob there .
' I have considered the young ' ooman .
And he grew to be proud of the title .
Once , I opened the yard-gate , and looked into the empty street .
He ' d got an old newspaper with him , and some other account in print of the storm .
Who ' s number twenty-two , that ' s to put all the others out ?
The confidence there has been between us must be broken off. ' ' When ? ' cried <NAME> .
It is her and it a n't her .
A very valuable person , and deservedly respected . "
' What did the brother say ? ' ' <NAME> ' t say a word , ma ' am , ' answered Mr Sparkler .
We have in vain pored over the leaves of <NAME> ' s note-book , in the hope of meeting with a general summary of these beautiful compositions .
I want to set you more right with yourself . "
O let us be joyful , joyful !
It was quite an accident , and the way in which it came about was this .
" You are kinder to me than I often am to myself , " he returned .
But the second object of this interview , I must not forget .
" Such an unworldly , uncalculating , gossamer creature is a relief to him and an amusement .
I don ' t think what I said now .
I come regular , to tramp about the streets , and see the gentlemen. ' ' Only to see ' em ? ' returned <NAME> .
<NAME> ' r <NAME> bor ' , gen ' l ' m ' n ' s right .
'Let me go , will you , -- this minute -- this instant . '
Mr <NAME> stood aloof with his cigar and pencil , but Mr <NAME> was on the spot to pay his respects to the ladies .
The sapient pot-boy , looking on officially , then had the conviction borne in upon his soul , that the man was evermore outcast and excommunicate from the <NAME> .
" Secondly , what will satisfy me for the trouble of producing it , sir , " repeats <NAME> .
' A most admirable memory. ' ' Thank you , ma ' am .
I was very much changed -- oh , very , very much .
I always said it , long before this came out .
It announces itself , in the new <NAME> , as a novel enterprise , timidly beginning to spring up .
From <NAME> ' s , Veneering dashes at <NAME> ' s place of business .
' To say to me -- ? ' ' That I hope you will not misunderstand my father .

" <NAME> , " she repeated , flashing a look at me .
At length , a light on the summit of the rocky staircase gleamed through the snow and mist .
Mrs. Corney twice essayed to speak : and twice failed .
' <NAME> , ' he resumed , ' I have done with this .

glancing round upon the three bystanders .
But you are a deep man , and keep your secret close. ' ' My secret ! ' said the other with a haggard look .
" I am in town on leave just now , " said <NAME> .
He was rather reserved , but I thought him very sensible and agreeable .
Mr <NAME> seemed much relieved and gladdened by the acquisition , and chuckled rapturously during the remainder of his visit .
I should soon be eased of it , if I did .
Unless your mind is prepared for the stairs , it will lead to inevitable disappointment .
I tried to cheer my darling , and asked her what it was .
The man was dressed like a traveller , in a foraging cap with fur about it , and a heap of cloak .
That done , he shut down his window , and went to bed again .
<NAME> and Mrs. <NAME> coming one afternoon when my guardian was not at home , in the course of conversation I naturally inquired after <NAME> .
This little round table with the marble top ( it ' s two feet ten in circumference ) , I bought .

And may I represent to you that it ' s injudicious to say the bee ?
" Do n't tell me there 's anything wrong about that security of <NAME> 's !

The very first paragraph upon which <NAME> 's eye rested , was the following advertisement .
And I assure you , sir , the ladies are great observers .
The men who play the bells have got scent of the marriage ; and the marrow-bones and cleavers too ; and a brass band too .

' And it is very sinful to rebel against them , ' whispered the clergyman .
' It ' s very agreeable to hear .
This brought him to a stop .
At length the breakfast is ready .
' <NAME> ' t I told you what a mercenary little wretch I am ?
The <NAME> of <NAME> ever shone anywhere , he certainly never shone in the house of <NAME> .
I really don ' t know what would be best to do , and that ' s the truth .
In fact , she has very little left , indeed. ' ' You as-tound me , <NAME> ! ' cried <NAME> .
He read that he was dishonoured .
' Bless my soul ! ' said Mrs. Cluppins .
What should we do without strength , my friends ?
" O yes I shall ! " said he .
The absurdity of the situation put its pathos to the rout .
' Are you reconciled ? ' Looking fixedly at me , she puts her hand to her forehead , and moans .
That ' s the mark ; come up to the mark , sir .
I will be there and back , before breakfast. ' The old man shook his head , and sighing mournfully , drew her towards him .

Now , there must be no misunderstanding regarding what I buy for two hundred a year .
' Take down that scandalous red handkerchief , I beg .
' <NAME> d ' ye do , <NAME> ? ' said <NAME> .
She was miserably dressed , and carried some skins over her arm .
' Go back to them , ' <NAME> retorted .
' Oh , decidedly , ' observed the spinster aunt .
There is not a morsel of an old letter or of any other writing in either .
You want to keep the keys yourself , and give out all the things , I suppose ?
I have been familiar with every stone in the place .
But , whenever <NAME> spoke , he shut them again .
It was the quietest time the <NAME> knew , saving the night hours when the <NAME> took the benefit of the act of sleep .

When I was at home expecting to be rich , I thought vaguely of all the great things I would do .
' What is it , my dear ?
I am not going home now ; I have a visit to make alone .
that ' s nothing in such a service .
' Oh dear , yes , sir ! ' cried this hopeful penitent .
He rose and raised me with him .
" What 'll you drink , <NAME> ?
' I promise it. ' ' That ' s my dear <NAME> .
Only by times , because <NAME> is growing drowsy .
It would do that incorrigible creature : who was the most barbarous infidel in point of poetry : good to be in such company .
Oliver brushed away two or three tears that were lingering in his eyes ; and seeing no board but the table , fortunately bowed to that .
' Here we are ! ' said <NAME> , hurrying <NAME> into the little parlour , where <NAME> and his wife were taking a lobster supper .
And when I return , we ' ll have a cup of tea , and a chat over future arrangements .
So easy is it to move light hearts .
At last the day came for going home .
There was little pain , little uneasiness , but there was no rallying , no effort , no struggle for life .
But my blood boils to avenge this poor murdered creature .
A very brief conversation ensued .
Perhaps he never told you my story ? ' ' No. ' ' Oh no , why should he !
The spinster aunt could hardly believe her eyes .
That she was a young widow , <NAME> .

" She wants this boy to go and play there .
At length the same boy reappeared , and presented me with a note written in pencil , and headed , in a legal manner , ' Heep v. <NAME> ' .
' <NAME> , my love , you know Mr Clennam even better than I have the happiness of doing .
'Dear me , I forgot all about it ! '
The well-known massive gray square tower of its old Cathedral ?
' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' allow me to introduce my very particular friend , <NAME> .
I ' m sure I never was more serious .
As he happened not to be doing anything at all , he merely boxed his ears , and told him not to do it again .
If you wish to consult me as to your interests , you will find me here at all times alike .
<NAME> , business ! " They went up slowly and softly .
' Eh ? ' cried Mr Boffin , catching at the name .
Not an emigrant , he hoped , within the sense and spirit of the law .
" Wishermaydie if I do n't , sir , " says Jo , reverting to his favourite declaration .
Very kind of her too , all the folks said , and I said , along with all the folks .
How de do ? ' Mr Toots would say , with a chuckle and a blush .
" Thriving , grandmother , in every way . "
I hope my natur is _NOT _ a soft vun , <NAME> .

Not going to be done ? ' repeated <NAME> .
AN ' T it uncommonly jolly now ! ' * * * * * A <NAME> midsummer day .
I suffered unspeakable trouble while I considered and reconsidered whether I should at last dissolve that spell of my childhood and tell <NAME> all the story .
' <NAME> or other , I never can come right in these discussions , ' says <NAME> , sighing and becoming resigned .
<NAME> <NAME> has made a pause to suppress a groan .
' There , young man ! ' said the dolls ' dressmaker .
If she wounds you , love her .
But the very genteel lady ' s <NAME> chariot being already horsed and at the inn-door , the landlord had slipped up-stairs to represent his hard case .
To work a lot of power over you and you not know it , knowing as you think yourselves , would be almost worth laying out money upon .
' Did you ? ' said <NAME> , distrustfully .
' Winkle -- Winkle ! ' shouted <NAME> , calling into the inner room .
There was nothing worth mentioning in the material world , but <NAME> , to be astonished about .
'What 's the good of telling me that ; I can hear it , ca n't I ! '
' Let me entreat you not to say so , <NAME> , either now , or at any future time .
I was rather on the lookout for good fortune then. " " Indeed ? " " Yes .

They had won their household places long ago , and did not stand without , as she did , with a bar across the door .
All my efforts are vain .
The bolts of the door were rusty , and difficult to unfasten without noise .
' Here <NAME> walks by herself , ' I thought .
' As near as a toucher , ' assented <NAME> .
I am greatly , greatly , disinclined to profit by it .
Let me remember , then , what he said as to that .
What else do I remember ?

" You will find the young man next door then .
' My dearest Edith -- Grangeby -- it ' s most trordinry thing , ' said <NAME> , pettishly , ' that <NAME> -- ' ' <NAME> !
" I began to fear , " with timid tenderness , " as it was past the usual time , that <NAME> was not coming . "
I am not strong enough to bear him ! ' To use the cold language of the world , <NAME> rapidly improved the acquaintance of <NAME> .
