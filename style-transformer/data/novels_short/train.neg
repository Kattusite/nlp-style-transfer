`` Come then , sir , we will put on our diving-dresses . ''
It is not likely that we shall be forgotten .
M'Nicholl , wiping his spectacles , looked again , but made no reply .
Hours passed without any result .
During one of these visits , the captain met with a strange adventure .
The horse refused to advance .
Will he remain any longer ? ''
<NAME> <NAME> would have liked to read <NAME> 's eyes .
The castaways suffered cruelly , but they scarcely perceived it .
Did she perceive that they acted with a view to her interest ?
All was made ready for flight .
Let 's see : in these seas , what do we generally meet with ?
They , however , readily understood one another .
The land below could no longer be seen .
He bore his misfortune with his habitual tranquillity .
`` That is not so , '' exclaimed <NAME> .
`` To prove that I understand . ''
The time sometimes comes back to me , but very confused like .
A question of life or death was now to be decided .
Hold up , my cousin on the left !
He seemed to be awaiting an opportunity to accomplish his wicked designs .
No , for you yourself have said it !
There is the only difficulty that science need now seek to overcome .
They were no longer jealous of each other .
The presence of this intruder on the poop of the <NAME> was perfectly inexplicable .
But that night was to be a night of terrors .
Thus prepared , the bird was called delicious , even by <NAME> .
He had settled on the place where he would strike his victim .
<NAME> <NAME> was in a furious rage .
The most remote revolves round the planet at a distance of 1,192,820 miles .
I replied , looking fixedly at <NAME> , whose meaning was easy to guess .
Procure us some iron for the barrels , steel for the hammers , saltpeter .
The two dogs intended to accompany them had been already deposited in the Projectile .
But no , for what would life be without him ?
<NAME> also strongly advised cold ablutions every morning .
The length of day reduced one half !
His energy and courage increased in sight of danger .
below zero ; every outward part of the <NAME> was covered with ice .
“ My dear fellow , we are now upon the very track of <NAME> .
It was now about to penetrate to less-known realms .
How he laboured to recover himself by work !
Its past , present , and future had even given up their last secrets .
The whip whistled in the air .
<NAME> commanded the <NAME> , and Stanioukowitch the <NAME> .
From the club it soon got into the papers throughout <NAME> .
The travellers were getting too near to notice it .
Then , all at once , he plunged into the lake .
Besides the example is contagious .
There they will tranship passengers and cargoes .
I only make two observations beforehand .
There the vein had failed , between the schist and the tertiary sandstone .
This brought them nearer to the left shore .
The Projectile was certainly approaching the <NAME> .
And now , what can you expect from the new-born infant ?
It has its tempers and its gentle moods .
Who could tell what the future might have in reserve ?
The <NAME> , for <NAME> , had started three-quarters of an hour before !
But think of <NAME> island after <NAME> .
He then pressed a knob .
<NAME> <NAME> ought to have pressed the natives upon this subject .
`` We shall never get back , '' said <NAME> , dejectedly .
They set to work to explore its very bed .
Were they still there , or had one of their number just gone out ?
It told me that the <NAME> was floating on the surface of the ocean .
But let us wait and see what turns up . ''
Another bound and he was between the bear and the girl .
Can it give heat to a dead body ? ''
Refreshing drinks were the only remedies at the colonists ' disposal .
“ What ’ s happened ? ” questioned <NAME> , rifle in hand .
cried the latter , ordering the spectators to leave the deck of the <NAME> .
The <NAME> looked in my face .
The car was close at hand .
`` You are an apt pupil . ''
I then heard the panels shut .
Al-Hadji ’ s marabouts , no doubt , ” said the doctor .
The wire was there fastened to the rock .
But would the subterranean fires provoke any violent eruption ?
The sight of the monster froze the blood in the veins of the boldest .
And what would become of them ?
The forest of the <NAME> supplied the best oaks and elms .
The routes to <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> all meet there .
I knocked again , then turned the handle .
“ <NAME> at all , ” said <NAME> .
Here <NAME> completed the survey left unfinished by <NAME> .
My uncle coolly shook his head .
`` Oh , he would have plenty of company ! ''
We must attend to that above all things , '' continued the Professor .
He looked radiant and handsome .
<NAME> scarcely bent his head .
This point can only be cleared up later .
There was no light in the window .
That is a rare gift of nature , like all eminent qualities .
I inquired the cause of their visit .
<NAME> ! ” cried <NAME> , throwing himself down beside his friend .
Here begins what may properly be called <NAME> 's travels .
exclaimed <NAME> , with whom the verb took a higher intonation each time .
Then there was a general helter-skelter .
After all , they could not prevent it .
The brave boy was beloved by everybody .
<NAME> was an <NAME> , and forty-five years of age .
“ This is what had happened .
“ A sister should hide nothing from her brother .
Not a tree or even the smallest shrub is to be seen . ''
Have you any hope ? ” said the <NAME> .
Arrived at the turning , they saw that the situation had changed .
This led the commander to despatch a mission consisting of <NAME> .
<NAME> was one of those men who never give in while life exists .
<NAME> <NAME> was there , a few steps from her .
I saw no use in that .
When the <NAME> appeared it was assailed by a shower of stones and arrows .
It 's their habit , I think . ''
`` <NAME> is influenced by no one .
To this there was no reply possible .
asked <NAME> doubtfully , but unwilling to submit to M'Nicholl .
His people rejoiced exceedingly at seeing him again at work .
She knew that she was safe with him , under his protection .
The light gradually increased , and the horizon acquired a rosy hue .
He mechanically set about making the preparations for departure .
57 degrees seems more likely .
I invited them to follow me without saying where we were .
`` I have an idea , <NAME> , '' said <NAME> .
On the 26th , <NAME> paid a second visit , which was official .
But right has not always might .
`` The captain is <NAME> , my friend , until we receive another . ''
The boat capsized and filled .
A traveling rug , in which each rolled himself , was all our bedding .
To whatever nation explorers belong we find them guilty of the same acts .
`` Do not abandon your children ! ''
Harding examined it ; then seizing his telescope he rushed to the window .
“ Very sorry , you know , <NAME> .
`` And he has satisfied you ? ''
We held one another 's hands not to be thrown off the raft .
By means of the number Judge <NAME> interpreted the whole of the cryptogram .
But how had he been able to penetrate during the night into <NAME> ?
“ It is rather as if we were returning from exile -- voluntary exile !
`` Then one may smoke on board ? ''
On this subject the ingenuity of <NAME> was at fault .
quantities of rubies , quantities of emeralds ! ''
In my daughter 's eyes and yours , I have often read my condemnation .
The absence of the tenants of the cottage was quite unaccountable .
“ Well , did you see them fly ? ” he asked the Major .
Very likely I may find there some manuscripts from the hand of <NAME> .
But before entering the Gulf of <NAME> , about 45° of N .
<NAME> , cool and collected , was giving his final directions .
`` Then you believe that we really are going to Liverpool ? ''
`` Out of six , '' answered <NAME> ; `` you forget <NAME> . ''
`` What can he do in such circumstances ? ''
the unfortunate man had wept !
The horrible scene of destruction was continually before my eyes .
I accordingly rose to my feet .
Twenty minutes later we were on board .
No traces whatever of the Projectile .
Results so obtained could not be correctly calculated .
So , till to-morrow , sir , and early . ''
To answer this question was not easy .
said <NAME> , who felt enraged at the slight given to his authority .
A week before the <NAME> appeared on the <NAME> , earth-works had been raised .
<NAME> approached the old man .
<NAME> could not find a word of comfort to say to him .
`` At last the hour has come ! ''
<NAME> news here awaited the members of the expedition .
The ice took most surprising forms .
I half opened my eyes .
exclaimed the <NAME> furiously ; `` I have missed it ! ''
His head is full of old recollections .
let us look for him ! ” cried <NAME> .
He was obliged to go in again , after rubbing himself violently with snow .
I should think I did , indeed !
<NAME> regretted that they were not passing directly above this vast opening .
The doctor had got as far as the foot of the ladder .
As it was , we got away without any accident worth mentioning .
said the captain , with a faint smile .
He did not , he would not believe in the loss of <NAME> .
And what are you going to do ? ''
Was it the reverberation of the cannon still booming in their ears ?
I recognised the southern whale by its flat head , which is entirely black .
The sailors could not hide their discontent , and the service suffered .
It 's the only way to convince him ! ''
Every thing about this group has been said and written already .
`` I have made a very important discovery . ''
The next day , the 20th of March , the snow had ceased .
Here <NAME> passed his first winter before advancing into <NAME> .
His half-closed eyes were struck with a faint light running among the great trees .
I can hear , too , plainly enough , the whistling of the wind .
This is nearly a tenth of the whole of Europe—a good-sized estate !
On the 7th of July , preparations for departure began .
The air was very clear .
There is <NAME> !
<NAME> was rising in the east .
But we have not come into that part of the world to be prudent .
<NAME> was very proud of his success .
It was the month of October .
<NAME> fell , and the sheet of white soon vanished .
His name was <NAME> , and he was a native of <NAME> .
The <NAME> folded his arms , listened , but did not speak .
The saloon was dark , but through the transparent glass the waves were sparkling .
Perhaps he , the former convict , still felt himself unworthy to do so !
The year 1492 is an era in geographical annals .
What is the use of pestering our brains about it ?
Moreover , we could in no case avail ourselves of it .
That 's what 's got to be done !
Have n't we insured the <NAME> for 400 thousand years ? '
The sincerest pity was depicted on his face .
“ Ah , the robber ! ” cried <NAME> .
The skin was torn from the flesh .
Do you want me to fail in my great combination ! ''
How would the commander of this floating dwelling-place proceed ?
On their landing some hundreds of penguins looked fearlessly at them .
<NAME> was the everlasting conclusion to which he came .
he cried , in a frantic tone , `` are you coming up ? ''
The corral appeared to be absolutely deserted .
She belonged to the port of <NAME> . ''
The privations endured by the crews during this long space of time were excessive .
[ Illustration : Shores and boats of the <NAME> . ]
`` Certainly , if it interests you so much . ''
“ But what would be the use of new continents ? ” asked <NAME> .
This man 's coolness and energy never forsook him .
<NAME> ’ t let our spirits go down !
`` I should think so , '' said <NAME> .
Neither <NAME> nor <NAME> appeared inclined to yield .
`` Let us quit this snow-house ! ''
After some further discussion , I turned to another matter .
Further on was a portion of the globe he might not trample upon .
But observations had now become very difficult .
The night was pitchy dark .
<NAME> <NAME> pointed to a seat .
The grotto was a vast and magnificent hall .
His watching was in vain .
It was constructed to go before the blast .
And now he had done .
The whole plain was covered with huts , cottages , and tents .
It was the sound of footsteps !
Each day I walked about the port and its neighbourhood .
He knew exactly what he was saying .
[ Illustration : `` Two small sledges were selected . '' ]
It was past twelve when all preparations were finished .
They were driving right down on it .
The tide had begun to come up half an hour before .
When they turned towards the doctor , they saw his eyes full of tears .
Unfortunately his work , which would have settled the discussion , never reached <NAME> .
There the ice had accumulated very closely .
They were all still in good condition .
The devoted passengers had been seen .
Besides , there 's very little to be done to-day .
On the shore this time !
`` Savages who scour the prairies .
An inventory of instruments was then begun .
`` Well , what you see are the great sulphurous flames .
Then , what is the use of threats ?
To leave <NAME> by one of the breaches would not be difficult after nightfall .
`` Because we were shot up 30 times faster than sound can travel ! ''
He soon extricated himself from their grasp .
<NAME> gave him the lion ’ s share of this scanty meal .
After eight hours of repose , they got ready to resume their march .
Pencroft now stood off the shore , three or four miles across from <NAME> .
`` I will be the congress , '' cried <NAME> .
The fine season passed away in the midst of the usual work .
The dog <NAME> accompanied them .
The boatswain and he were great friends , and indulged in frequent talks .
do n't imagine you are dealing with a sot !
`` Will either take us anywhere that you know of ? ''
The scoundrel at last disappeared .
The 14th of February , eve of the departure , was Sunday .
The oars only dipped into the water at long intervals .
The animal sprang at his master 's call .
No doubt ; at least , it was worth considering .
With a deep sigh he nodded his head and acquiesced .
There is the <NAME> , coming from the northeast , on its left .
It was following exactly the same route as the <NAME> .
No , if we take that refraction into consideration .
We must , if possible , prevent his stirring out of it . ''
After all , these <NAME> dogs are kind beasts .
Why , then , did I remain silent ?
<NAME> this a second accident ?
The expedition visited the temple at <NAME> , which is far-famed for its sanctity .
I may admire you , but I 'm blessed if I understand you ! ''
This was not from any fear of being recognized .
Very cordially yours , J.B. HOBSON , Secretary of <NAME> .
This island was rightly named <NAME> ' <NAME> .
The disembarkation was splendid -- upon fine sand , with neither rock nor wave .
But I should dearly like to know .
<NAME> ’ s surprise became absolute stupefaction .
They penetrated as far as the scene of the attack .
Who could then foresee the minimum of time necessary for our deliverance ?
What did it matter that time had blurred the other letters ?
The requisite sum shall be deposited with the above-named Messrs. Marcuart & Co .
In the confusion , no one remarked them , although their garments were dripping .
We were unwilling to punish him , although most of us carried our guns .
`` No objections to a third term ! ''
I must fulfill my mission .
The open sea meant liberty for him .
But what has become of the <NAME> ?
This man appeared to be possessed of very great strength .
Nevertheless , <NAME> walked on rapidly , without showing any hesitation .
They were not ready to put to sea until July 20th , 1720 .
A suitable amount of provisions was made ready .
<NAME> had no other choice than to scud before the storm .
`` I must be very careful , <NAME> .
As to its size and quality , that must be determined later .
“ <NAME> , I am willing to follow you , ” replied the maiden .
<NAME> <NAME> and his companions rose at the end of this account .
I knew him and his habits too well .
The leather bottles were left with <NAME> .
We could make a cave for ourselves with pickaxes !
`` And have they not been seen again ? ''
Being answered in the negative , he appeared surprised , and continued silent .
The <NAME> Government was urged to interfere .
<NAME> could not escape from the fashion of travelling .
I could not answer him .
Any attempt would have been futile .
We allude to <NAME> von Humboldt .
This arrangement , however , could be only temporary .
“ Of <NAME> ? ” repeated <NAME> , opening his eyes .
<NAME> <NAME> had decided , very sensibly , to set off in the evening .
How many of their friends must have fallen in the struggle ?
`` Well thought of , M. Aronnax , '' replied the <NAME> , smiling .
“ Where is he going to ? ” asked <NAME> .
It remains in motion until some obstacle stops it .
asked <NAME> of the sailor .
It had been fired at the time stated .
Their shape is often circular .
When his horse fell , he waited until it got up .
Their hair was trimmed , and curled naturally .
Think of <NAME> , of <NAME> , of all who are left .
`` Do they fish for them in these days ? ''
They answered , “ <NAME> ” sailed on the 18th instant .
It was ever nearing that phosphorescent light which showed the presence of the <NAME> .
<NAME> got anxious , and almost reproached herself for raising the question .
`` Towards <NAME> , '' replied <NAME> .
“ I like them better than Tartars .
Their own Projectile was carrying them headlong into a bottomless abyss of fire !
The three friends still clung to the network .
What do you want ? ” he asked .
It is the air alone that makes a difference of weight .
`` Yes , snow , or rather glaciers heavily coated with glittering ice .
Besides , it is completely going down as far as wine growing is concerned .
The <NAME> commenced at the very foot of the <NAME> .
“ I must have more than that , ” the professor continued .
Do you know the history of <NAME> ? ''
`` And I advise you not to judge me , sir .
The tide being high at that time , rendered the channel impassable .
<NAME> <NAME> had some hundreds hunted .
asked the captain of the man at the wheel .
asked <NAME> of the second mate .
We know how perfectly he acted the part he had determined on .
She was going at the speed of thirteen knots and a half .
During the daytime , a damp , penetrating , unendurable humidity !
The crew and all the passengers were assembled on deck .
The sail flapped idly against the mast , and <NAME> had it furled .
Load the gun and give it to me . ''
`` What is the matter , '' asked <NAME> .
`` The animals are cared for , <NAME> , '' said <NAME> .
It is used in parts of the <NAME> very considerably by the natives .
64 A struggle between the <NAME> and a <NAME> prah .
At last the cold ceased .
Will you be kind enough to listen to me ? ''
`` It 's very simple , my friend , '' answered the doctor .
`` Coal , on this lonely shore ! ''
Those who understand <NAME> climbing will comprehend our difficulties .
How long the night appeared to the sailor and his companions !
`` Some one , '' cried the sailor .
<NAME> , having made all inquiries , stayed in the unlucky place till October .
324 `` Here congregate flocks of penguins '' .
`` It was in revenge , <NAME> , '' replied <NAME> .
[ Illustration : A <NAME> family . ]
The irruption of the lava had been complete .
it 's you , is it , <NAME> ? ''
Upon what seaman would the choice of the <NAME> Government fall ?
<NAME> ceased to breathe at all .
Several pirogues speedily surrounded the two ships .
<NAME> seemed to him to be falling rapidly into decay .
`` So , at any risk we must get out ! ''
He longed so to get well !
Let us form our syndicate. ” “ And after ? ” said <NAME> .
<NAME> Harding thus soon had every thing ready for setting to work .
The Jew still spluttered , and moaned , and hesitated .
[ Illustration : `` A loud explosion followed . '' ]
The <NAME> of A <NAME> .
We saw a faint light .
Forthwith <NAME> went to work at his vocation .

Can he ever tire of the emotions caused by such a chase ? ''
“ I am a poor man , ” began the Jew .
<NAME> was at this time under the dominion of the great khan .
“ Let us hide ourselves , ” at last said the engineer .
A gunshot suddenly pealed forth and shot its flame into the air .
Here , before his very eyes , was a cryptogram !
<NAME> , women , and children ran wildly about on every side .
There were many wounded , but none mortally .
The gas would burn quietly , and we should descend little by little .
`` We do not know , '' said <NAME> .
<NAME> of the Lachlan. ” Paganel was beside himself .
the Projectile -- well -- I think I must have made some oversight . ''
He has even uttered a moan .
`` Is the wind north or south ? ''
`` Well , '' remarked <NAME> , `` we shall fight against them . ''
289 View of the <NAME> of <NAME> .
“ <NAME> , ” replied <NAME> .
`` We ought to expect anything here , '' answered the doctor .
It was <NAME> himself .
He met only a few natives , with whom he had little intercourse .
A sail was in sight off the rock .
They were threatened with being detained in the ice until the next season .
We had nothing to do but to walk about the pretty town and bay .
<NAME> appeared to be the least self-possessed of the party .
<NAME> was delighted to see his pupil 's appetite returning .
Not only was he big , but he was tall .
They began by measuring its angles and diameters .
As the sea went down , they searched every little crevice with no result .
Not one trace of the metal existed .
His father ’ s innocence would have been recognized !
It was no longer a confused roar , but distinct reports .
`` But where shall we find him ? ''
The <NAME> was rushing on with great rapidity .
What would <NAME> do with the elephant when he got to <NAME> ?
Well , I will go alone to <NAME> . ''
344 `` <NAME> had given his verdict '' .
He ordered his chief officer to repair without delay to <NAME> .

Must we then charge D'Entrecasteaux with want of thoroughness in his work ?
I tried to make up my mind to think no longer .

`` The train leaves for Dover at a quarter before nine .
It was the <NAME> , of <NAME> 's <NAME> ' <NAME> .
<NAME> never quitted the <NAME> ’ s side .
But counting them is one thing , determining their nature is another .
It took <NAME> 's companion some time to digest this fine observation .
To the sea with our clothing ! '
They were like savages , almost inaccessible to the most natural emotions .
The struggle continued with the same deadly tenacity , but without apparent result .
The cold was great , the constellations shone with wonderful intensity .
He called the eider-duck hunter to his side .
Its summit evidently passed the level of the ocean .
The weather was fine , and the temperature inspiriting .
The boat , altering its course , came up alongside the right wall .
`` And when do we go ? ''
<NAME> was stormed with questions on all sides .
Doctors have taken six thousand years to discover that !
`` And he traded with the <NAME> ? ''
The sea was distinctly visible for a mile all round the <NAME> .

Does n't the glory of success belong to the head of the expedition ?
The construction of the <NAME> bridge lasted three weeks of regular hard work .

Do you not see a mass which seems to move ? ''
my friends , ” cried <NAME> , urging his companions by voice and look .
The animal gained on us , sporting with the waves .
To make sure , the doctor was anxious to question <NAME> again .
To the north-west rose <NAME> , which concealed a great part of the horizon .
But that was not all .
At that moment its needle oscillated between 25.24 and 25.08 .
Wishing to verify the course of the <NAME> , I went to the saloon .
Of the passengers ten only survived -- those in the last carriage .
<NAME> was locking away the gold in one of the drawers .
<NAME> <NAME> with his glass eagerly scanned the shore , though without perceiving anything .
My horse can not outstrip them .
He was the greatest human enigma I ever had known .
But did these adventurers complain of space ?
Selenographers are not quite agreed as to the nature of these colors .
“ Who knows ? ” answered the sailor .
Mary is most like him .
<NAME> reported to the colonists the questions and answers which had been made .
We must have been 5000 yards high .
It was a horrible wound .
Our very style of locomotion left in my mind no doubt upon the subject .
are we not fully prepared ? ''
<NAME> neither stirred nor spoke .
Sometimes we felt a light breeze .
`` Can not we talk very well here ? ''
He did not , however , abandon <NAME> .
Sometimes it looks like a body of cavalry manoeuvring .
and does n't the prospect delight you , too , <NAME> ? ''
I heard rattlings and scrapings .
“ I wish we had a sledge , ” said <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> had attentively observed him .
The resistance of the air is of little importance .
And after the interview J. T. <NAME> fled from the house in <NAME> .
The damage done was not serious , and was as easily repaired as forgotten .
It was of the greatest importance therefore to get in advance of them .
The interval between each lightning-flash and each thunder-clap diminished rapidly .
Please yourself about this insane expedition !
You will be ready , sir ? ''
<NAME> signs filled the air .
My companions and I then witnessed a curious spectacle .
<NAME> , prepared for all these questions , replied without the least hesitation .
A word from <NAME> explained everything .
cried J. T. <NAME> , mounting his steed .
And what is it doing so near the Pole ? ''
Map of the World as known to the Ancients .
However , it was their herds <NAME> wanted , not themselves .
`` But I am going to fight a duel with this gentleman . ''
<NAME> , my honest Jup , I make you a present of it !
The <NAME> had been carefully equipped for a long voyage .
Tai-One guided the <NAME> into the interior .
swore the usually serene <NAME> , now completely stunned by the blow .
“ Some animal in his burrow , ” said <NAME> .
His countenance showed that he had long and cruelly suffered .
[ Illustration : `` Two soldiers held me . '' ]
The night passed quietly , as did the day of the 12th of October .
Yes , two -- one to save the other .
`` Voyage in <NAME> of <NAME> , 1791-93 . ''
<NAME> ; for once he walked slowly around the room .
[ Illustration : <NAME> fleet off <NAME> .
Like the pictures of <NAME> di <NAME> , he was sketched in black .
I opened my mouth wide , and my lungs saturated themselves with fresh particles .
Our readers will never believe !
<NAME> whirlwinds of vapour obscured the sky , through which glimmered a few stars .
<NAME> scanned the list , but his master 's name was not upon it .
Hurliguerly called my attention to the fact . ''
roared the captain through the newspapers .
In another moment he fired .
It would be difficult to imagine a collection of greater ruffians .
But the crater could not afford a sufficient outlet for this vapour .
Therefore her heat should be so much the less . ''
I was paralyzed with fatigue .
<NAME> remained thus on the look-out for some time .
It seemed inadmissible that the concessionaries should have prepared for so hypothetical an eventuality .
Sometimes there could be no doubt that we were going downwards .
Towards three o'clock in the morning <NAME> uttered a piercing cry .
But up to ten in the evening , there were no signs of <NAME> .
But I protest against it .
`` How so , my dear Cyrus ? ''
Kublaï-Khan was much pleased to receive these strangers from the distant <NAME> .
The captain pointed to a spot near <NAME> .
This sally was too witty and too stinging to conciliate the minister .
<NAME> Harding ’ s attempt would succeed .
“ If you command me , ” replied <NAME> .
The rest of the community by no means shared in their uneasiness .
Would others let themselves be killed at this place ?
<NAME> drops stood on <NAME> ’ s brow .
`` Come along , <NAME> , '' cried <NAME> .
`` Only it is more expensive . ''
We bought no less than ten , which we brought to <NAME> . ''
The institution dates from 1722 .
“ Thank you , Torres ! ” he said , holding out his hand .
I scarcely dared believe what the eider-duck hunter was about to do .
His countenance expressed deep humility .
But to this simple explanation of the famous November meteors <NAME> would not listen .
His dreams carried him from joy to agony .
<NAME> immediately brought her some food ; she was evidently famished .
`` Why do you speak of the <NAME> seas ? ''
I 've often found them passing for the best kind of arguments ! ''
Had he succumbed in presence of these terrible events ?
Now the <NAME> weighed 1,500 .
The sea sparkled with phosphorescence .
On the whole I thought it safer to restrain my curiosity .
Let us , then , calculate our chances . ''
<NAME> was on the alert for her , and his bullet broke her shoulder .
No more plains ; no more seas .
Round his body was rolled a long coil of flax rope .

However , even yet we can predicate nothing positive .
replied <NAME> , whom no reasoning could have convinced .
No one forbade him to pass .
`` What are you thinking of , captain ?
<NAME> recommended the same course as <NAME> and <NAME> .
His bold , determined nature made it impossible to take failure quietly .
“ What ’ s that , captain ? ” asked <NAME> .
`` That is more than your duty . ''
How were we to prevent ourselves from slipping down the steeply inclined plane ?

At first everything was quite dark and gloomy .
Her eyes betrayed an infinite simplicity .
It was a hot , incandescent blast !
The tide had begun to come up half an hour before .
I felt myself being pushed into a little room contiguous to the wardrobe room .
One of the pointers , carried away by excitement , went up to him .
They were delicious words , but I had little hope .
The mention of such a foolhardy attempt made the boatswain shrug his shoulders .
He thought of <NAME> , <NAME> , and the brutal Pen .
He did not leave his masters , and evinced no wish to escape .
At last about noon , we were in the waters of the <NAME> .
The large boat was rapidly got ready .

When they arrived there , it was an hour after midday .
During all this time the necessary works had not been neglected .
But <NAME> had not even felt the <NAME> ’ s hand .
The party went on shore at once .
The spray was luminous , just as if lit up by sudden phosphorescence .
“ _Si , si_ ” ( yes , yes ) replied the <NAME> .
The next day ’ s journey was good ; there were no new calamities .
<NAME> <NAME> was terrible to hear ; he was still more terrible to see .
Why can not we launch into space through the scuttle ?
They were on board when the <NAME> made ready to weigh anchor .
He had not perfectly proved the impossibility of an antarctic continent .
This bird is peculiar to the country .
<NAME> liked <NAME> 's proposal and submitted it to the council .
I only desire to call attention to one point .
Now we were about to encounter unknown and fearful dangers .
Arrangements were made for disembarking the balloon upon the beach at <NAME> .

We want a crew of only eighteen men . ''

If there had been one , of what use would it have been ?
`` The same as the doctor 's , '' answered the boatswain .
“ What will become of you , <NAME> ? ” Paganel remained silent .
<NAME> instantly touched the discharging key of the little electric battery .
Then there was a general helter-skelter .
What a domestic and regular gentleman !
Their labors were now carried on with feverish ardor .
As if despite his wishes , he penetrated all the secrets of their existence .
That brave officer fell a victim to his sense of duty !
Never before had mortal eye beheld such a sight .
You are going to visit the land of marvels . ''
Who is he ? ” he thought to himself .
During this time <NAME> was completing his stock of fresh meat .
The population was massacred without mercy , and the town pillaged and burnt .
The onagers , unharnessed , roamed in the corral .
<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> waited there for me .
`` <NAME> is the word , '' answered the doctor .
From the first , the great defect of this country was apparent .
The bottom of the abyss was quite dry .
`` I care nothing about seeing , nor about magnificent spectacles .
Who knows whither we shall drift , or what we must suffer ?
He must have suffered agonies of hunger .
`` At last we have righted ! ''
The horizon was still very clear .
All at once the tall figure of the sailor appeared .
`` Yes , the last two days . ''
Perhaps we shall find the way longer than we suppose . ''
The cries and shots were constant .
The hunting party returned home , bringing their game with them .
Many years passed before the permission could be given .
When it emerged <NAME> , who had been astride on it , had disappeared .
Yes ; they often talked of all these things and formed still more plans .
I looked at my uncle with surprise and astonishment .
In a few hours the colonists would definitely know what to expect .
The complainants would not dare present themselves with such a charge .
“ I should think so , my boy .
His power was not manifested in any way .
So ended the first meeting .
`` Then do not let us lose time , '' said <NAME> , rising .
`` Where is he going to ? ''
The brig is making sail ! ''
One only wriggled in the air , brandishing the victim like a feather .

This plan settled , it had only to be put into execution .
`` All ashore who are going ! ''
“ What does it all mean ? ” exclaimed the count .
The spherical surface , however , had long since begun to reveal its convexity .
I no longer know where we are .
`` We have not come to that , luckily , '' replied the boatswain .
`` Much we shall gain by that !
The sudden apparition of a supernatural being could not have startled them more completely .
`` In order to leave this notice , '' added <NAME> .
It was singular enough that so few bodies floated .
These events occurred with the rapidity of lightning .
Where we are going matters little ; we shall soon see .
I sighed for my own <NAME> , and wished to be back with <NAME> .
The boat now contained only three able men .
He did not leave his masters , and evinced no wish to escape .
But night came on , and overshadowed the rough ocean .
`` Well , we must have patience ! ''
“ Our friend <NAME> will be the very man for him .
<NAME> uttered a cry of anguish , and fell into old <NAME> 's arms .
Had he not accomplished the bold projects which lay so near his heart ?
He would set foot where no human foot had been set before !
Thus navigators accepted their guidance with wise caution .
Beyond this barrier the lake stretches away out of sight in the west .
`` O , but there 's something else it shows ! ''
Corporal Pim must be sent for .
More than once he cried out , “ Oh , papa !
“ And who made this discovery ? ” he asked at length .
Where was <NAME> taking us to ?
She came near serving us an ugly trick .
<NAME> existence will be regulated with absolute precision .
But neither one nor the other had the courage to distinctly communicate this impression .
You have exposed yourselves to so many perils ! ''
The captain consented , and received him as a passenger .
And we had breathing time .
said <NAME> , bursting out laughing .
<NAME> and wild pigs which weighed about 2 cwt .
The <NAME> went up to him .
`` No , <NAME> ; but a danger still exists . ''
said my uncle , with very much of his old professional impatience .
Would he not take part with the <NAME> ?
Still in default of practical experience what was the value of mere theories ?
The natives armed themselves with stones , and became threatening .
All <NAME> subjects are forbidden to quit the province upon any pretext whatsoever .
There was no longer any doubt as to the pirates ' intentions .
`` We are blocked up then ? ''
<NAME> , consulting his map , recognized Eratosthenes .
And this man will not rewind it .
They did not , however , employ it in chasing guanacos or ostriches . ''
Several presents had been exchanged between the royal pair and the commander .
It suits me also to land , and without delay .
Near the table was the bed formerly used by <NAME> .
It became necessary to keep an eye upon the deputies .
They resolved to make the attempt .
<NAME> O ’ <NAME> related his history .
“ Those are the cataracts of <NAME> , in the third degree of latitude .
He foresaw that the whole future of the new excavations must depend upon it .
For how long a time had he been the guest of this brave <NAME> ?
`` Will you go to the ship in the boat ? ''
`` Well , the thing is easy .
I remember that <NAME> 's romance starts from <NAME> . ''
`` Archimedes could not have spoken more geometrically . ''
These soft words sent the blood back into the young girl 's heart .
Soon the conversation began again .
But this did not satisfy <NAME> .
I could not describe the impression those three words made upon us .
I was constantly on the alert .
These sailors , of various nationalities , displayed zeal and good will .

It was far beyond anything seen in the upper world .
A few small pieces of silver , moreover , jingled in his pocket .
Some of the women carried their children tied on to their backs with rushes .
He was a brave man , liked by every one , faithful , courageous !
During the night the temperature of the water rose to 1° below zero .
He communicated his ideas to old <NAME> , who decidedly appreciated them .
Consolidated beds of lava could never shine with such dazzling uniformity .
Neither the engineer nor the reporter could calm him .
<NAME> was heard shouting from aloft , -- `` A whale to leeward ! ''
A long silence followed these words .
`` Hans is leaving us , '' I cried .
It was seven months since <NAME> had started .

We are compelled to breathe just as it does . ''
It was the only error with which he could reproach himself .
<NAME> was sent , and on the 1st of November the prisoners were released .
Our hard-to-manage captain has given in at last .
But what was to be done ?
All the facts are united by a mysterious chain . ''
<NAME> heard a report , and felt a ball pass through his tunic .
You shall take my place .
And we were being carried away towards the south !
<NAME> , absorbed in his thoughts , did not hear him .
Next morning , <NAME> thus addressed his people .
But why was the ship coming there ?
I 'm sorry we killed him !
They themselves made the only sound to be heard in this dead city .
Even the roaring sound of the mighty column was lost to the ear .
Many reasons combined to decide <NAME> upon permitting this .
Laing 's trip through <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> was not without importance .
The ship soon neared the shore , and presently dashed violently against it .
They dragged themselves along , almost unable to walk .
<NAME> unclosed his eyes and fixed them full upon the orderly ’ s face .
said <NAME> , without betraying any astonishment .
Evening came , and still the scouts did not return .
At that moment , at six o'clock , the lunar pole appeared .
Will you not likewise do so ? ''
He then took up his station near the window and gazed through the foliage .
“ He is dying ! ” said <NAME> .
At noon they were obliged to let them rest for an hour .
In all probability the <NAME> first emerged into the light at this spot .
<NAME> took it for granted that the <NAME> was endeavoring to put in .
Before long , he would be called upon for his determination .
This was only a question of time .
They therefore knew who he was and what depended on him .
He did not put down the aspirations of this brave heart .
This was the boundary-line between <NAME> and <NAME> .
But no voice was heard , the door did not open .
“ We know of its existence for several centuries , which is our security .

Towards evening they saw <NAME> , separated from <NAME> by <NAME> 's Bay .
The storm was now at its height .

I looked around with surprise and incredulity .
This was a <NAME> estimate .

Why did Top so often run round this opening ?
They labored day and night .
Some other resort must assuredly be soon found , or they must perish .
I shouted , but there was no answer .

Here we were , then , after three months of this terrible voyage !
We are now six leagues from <NAME> . ''
They breakfasted then at two in the morning ; the hour mattered little .
`` Do you approve of my idea , <NAME> ? ''
As to religion , the captain found no trace of that !
He was used to all that .
They instantly obeyed , all quietly yielding them a passage .
The representatives arrived at <NAME> by different steamers .
“ You have , captain , ” replied the engineer .
But he hesitated to make a fresh start .
“ What is the matter ? ” asked the astonished mujik .
<NAME> , however , was not a bad man .
`` I warn you , the way will be tiring .
At the same time , the naturalists attached to the expedition , <NAME> .
Why linger over the perpetual sufferings of the survivors ?
`` What can be the cause of this peculiarity ? ''
The latter did not think it so simple , but he did not protest .
`` The elements of Olympus are definitively settled .
`` Is it to be believed ?
Its futile heat would but poorly compensate for its superior radiance .
Nor did the animal world assert the feeblest sway .
Are we advancing towards some mighty waterfall which shall cast us into the abyss ?
Has the world grown smaller ? ''
283 Entrance to <NAME> .
“ You can not leave the camp , my Lord , ” said <NAME> .
What followed was irresistibly comic .
Consequently they were equally successful in cattle breeding and farming .
The rocks were splintered , and cheers accompanied each discharge .
Still we were determined not to perish without a struggle .
The passengers landed without the least difficulty on an absolutely desert shore .
At ten o ’ clock the tide turned .
That remained to be seen .
`` We will show you something you have never yet seen .
Still , their plan of attack had evidently been altered .
They then busied themselves in placing all this cargo in safety .
`` Soon we shall have reached the Pole !
“ Will your Lordship listen to me ? ” returned <NAME> .
No ship had touched the bay for a week .
During the remainder of the month of July there was alternate rain and frost .
“ We must cross the barrier , ” he said in a low tone .
But whatever he was , his life , if possible , must be preserved .
`` Then it is an air-gun . ''
Would <NAME> be diverted from its proper way ?
The body of the martyred missionary was then solemnly placed in it .
It is only a blow of the harpoon lost .
This would have been obnoxious for many reasons . ''
His military career was cut short by the peace of 1763 .
`` Sir , would <NAME> 's family speak of it as you do ? ''
[ Illustration : <NAME> saw a man running and gesticulating . ]
After ten minutes <NAME> stopped suddenly .
15 `` I plunged my pike into his breast '' .
These sterile and deserted archipelagoes have no value for the merchant or geographer .
Hans never moved a muscle .
Her chemise lay folded on the ground in front of her .
And this was not all .
'The <NAME> for the <NAME> ? '
When the engineer stood still , <NAME> stopped also .
A long array of anxious ones formed itself in the square .
The <NAME> was built and equipped .
ascend it , my dear captain !
`` No , captain , with the aid of time and tempest .
Nothing but an immense sea .
The women on the right , and the men on the left ! ''
“ Had you a burning-glass , sir ? ” asked <NAME> of <NAME> .
<NAME> began to consider the various reasons which might have caused this delay .
It was a dark October night , and a light fog overshadowed the town .
<NAME> and his companions rejoiced in the north-wind .
I was losing my skepticism in the presence of these wonders .
said <NAME> , biting his lips till they bled .
These readings and writings and old papers have their interest !
These continual falls awoke echoes of singular power and effect .
<NAME> our courage and determination had overcome all difficulties .
They bargained over that which should enrich <NAME> !
Having lost their anchor , they were at the mercy of the ebb-tide .
What infinite variety nature lavishes on her great panoramas !
There was nothing of the sort .
A ghastly smile passed across the <NAME> 's lips , and that was all .
“ Yes , that I did , ” replied the overman .
One of the blacks went with them .
One idea was all the time impressed upon my brain .
This was the overman , <NAME> .
`` No thanks are necessary , '' replied .
His master could only calm him by keeping up a low , continuous whistle .
he exclaimed at length ; `` it must be pretty hot up there ! ''
330 `` Only by getting wet up to their waists '' .
This accusation is too absurd to need refutation .
His countenance had resumed its habitual imperturbability .
`` So much the better , '' thought I .
The members of the <NAME> of <NAME> visited him daily , and obtained nothing .
Like a genuine son of the moon , he let them keep on .
<NAME> , prolonged , is temporary madness !
“ You will find out some day , ” answered <NAME> , significantly .
The ascent of the mountain had ceased by an imperious command .
Does not this plain look like -- ? ''
Consider me most deplorably ignorant on the nature of these curves . ''
<NAME> was on his guard .
“ An important thing , truly , this eruption !
muttered <NAME> , crossing his arms .
He might , indeed , be obliged to remain in it for several hours .
The fault lay with the <NAME> .
The judge ordered them to be shown into his study .
“ Do you see anything extraordinary in it , captain ?
Finally , however , actual personal observation upset theory .
His orders executed , the <NAME> retired with his train .
The first day of the voyage was not marked by any incident .
`` You are sceptical , '' retorted <NAME> .
`` The same , sir , who is seeking his prize ! ''
This native general commanded at the outset 2,500 warriors , afterward increased to 8,000 .
The rabbit-warren still continued to supply the larder of <NAME> .
After all , you only offer moral presumptions .
No emotion was visible on his face .
Its nets brought up numerous specimens of polypi and curious shells of mollusca .
This was the height of happiness to them all .
Besides , <NAME> showed himself little , if at all .
A large gallery , black and deep , opened before us .
It was now seven months since they had left <NAME> .
The <NAME> hordes rose at the voice of Feofar-Khan .
Do you think there could be any tie between you and me ? ...
<NAME> , to less than 1,400 miles .
I saw my companion rise up before me .
However , <NAME> was not mistaken .
The country we had reached was already nearly a desert .
To them were added the <NAME> of 120 tons , and the pinnace <NAME> .
The settlers then pushed on .
<NAME> to the interior of the brig was now easy .
The colonel and the major stared at each other in blank astonishment .
`` You heard <NAME> , the advocate , and <NAME> , the doctor ? ''
Evidently on that subject his decision was irrevocable .
Why had our incomprehensible guide led us to the bottom of this submarine crypt ?
why had not <NAME> told him all before he left the jangada ?
Its commander was easily selected .
I did all I could to induce them to part with one .
It belongs to those ring mountains of the first class called <NAME> .
they are under full steam !
The <NAME> was still descending .
`` One would say it was the track of a ship . ''
Can its cannonade us at the bottom of the sea ? ''
O no , the trouble here is about -- inhabitants ! ''
repeated <NAME> , touching him with his hand .
So we progressed , incessantly charmed by some new marvel .
I examined my companion afresh .
From that day forth , <NAME> had not one moment 's rest .
The <NAME> blessing was first invoked on all present .
Listening evidently could do no good .
<NAME> <NAME> had not left the hall .
“ You protest your innocence ; but all prisoners do as much !
He fancied he saw an ironical smile playing about <NAME> 's lips .
“ Detestable old wretch ! ” replied the count , full of disgust .
At this period , we may almost say there was no trade in <NAME> .
`` Yes ; but we must get through this first . ''
<NAME> is hard to kill .
Could he have gone on board the <NAME> without us ? ''
The whole of it , my lad , ” answered the engineer .
I will be even with him !
Each one seemed afraid to pronounce the word .
He expected to find frequent communication between <NAME> and <NAME> .
The story was easy to read .
d'Urville and de <NAME> , were employed in this work , which MM .
On the 10th of October the vessel was launched .
`` A leper , '' explained my uncle .
“ <NAME> hundred , out of seven thousand ! ” murmured the girl .
The doctor 's companions followed his orders without clearly understanding his intention .
The boat disappeared , dragged down by the eddy .
He could never dream of resuming his former life .
<NAME> was their only chance of safety .
`` It is five thousand eight hundred and ninety-one quadrillions of tons . ''
They are five in number .
At length his companions understood him , and took their places at his side .
Above this embankment , the conical peak rose 7,000 feet high .
`` Well , are we really moving ? ''
Like the following islands , it belongs to the <NAME> group .
“ You see , <NAME> , I was right .
<NAME> , sea , and sky were plunged in complete darkness .
The site of the devastated forest was even more barren than <NAME> .
`` Ah , you take it thus ! ''
He put on a pair .
`` Three cheers for M'Nicholl and the <NAME> ! ''
What would become of these bold travelers in the immediate future ?
By what providential fatality had <NAME> brought them in the track of the fugitives ?
It was just that unknown hemisphere which was stealing from their sight .
From this time navigators increased .
answered his companions , in a loud and fervent whisper .
`` <NAME> , '' he says , `` appeared to us a terrestrial paradise .
<NAME> ’ s joy was therefore shared by all .
“ You are a courier from the Czar ? ” he asked .
It is an extremely dry wind which blows from the southwest .
We made all the preparation in our power for a prolonged hibernation .
An hour passed in this way without any result .
But from that moment <NAME> was exposed to the importunities of his former accomplices .
In fact , what less could it do upon so grand an occasion !
At these words , <NAME> rose suddenly .
`` Nothing will be easier ; but is this a really useful thing ? ''
“ Well , my boy ? ” “ The moment ’ s at hand .
`` The case is no better there . ''
“ Yes , fearless indeed ! ” replied <NAME> .
Who can say that they may not take a new course ?
The electric light added very greatly to the brilliancy of the effect .
But standing out here will never do .
We remained profoundly still , speechless with surprise .
They proceeded from that part of the <NAME> which lay in darkness .
asked the doctor , a little surprised at the <NAME> 's statement .
Was it of a nature to justify immediate action or not ?
The fragment included <NAME> and <NAME> , with the two English garrisons !
The breeze was very slight and might soon drop altogether .
replied <NAME> , `` for all your friends are near you . ''
Nothing now remained but to go !
<NAME> of blue flames ran between the two banks .
The <NAME> , or <NAME> , are the <NAME> of the <NAME> .
Thus provided , I can breathe and I can see . ''
Then he tried everything his excited imagination could suggest .
It was this , '' said the engineer , holding up the broken tube .
So I am delighted , enchanted !
said he , `` that animal goes quicker than the <NAME> .
It was putting a torch under a powder-barrel .
But it was not being tried , as yet .
The aeronauts were only one hundred yards high .
As to their crossing the river on the ice , that was not possible .
“ And even precede you , ” added Paganel .
[ Illustration : Fête in <NAME> 's honour at <NAME> . ]
<NAME> arose numerous fissures , and continual falling in of the upper earth .
Two sailors and <NAME> have succeeded in landing .
`` It 's the beast of <NAME> ! ''
“ There ’ s Jihoue-la-Mkoa , where we must halt for a few minutes .
<NAME> is a brave and energetic <NAME> woman .
Come to the boat ; <NAME> and I will wait for you . ''
long. , reckoning from the <NAME> meridian .
the <NAME> , ” said <NAME> , hotly .
The soil , as it were , slid under their feet .
How could they learn , how calculate , in the midst of this night ?
The brig <NAME> does not exist .
`` It is I , '' answered the captain simply .
The <NAME> seemed to understand the art of shaping the fireworks at their fancy .
There was no foreseeing what they might encounter .
<NAME> this material proof of the convict ’ s innocence irrevocably lost ?
The brig was a good sailer , for she approached rapidly .
<NAME> received the <NAME> directly .
The gunner hastened to him .
Now all that was the fault of Mrs. Scorbitt .
We shall presently relate the particulars of this interesting part of their expedition .
My uncle looked at me with a proud and triumphant glance .
This custom was rigorously observed .
Lat. , and 208 degrees 37 minutes W .
They did not clearly comprehend him .
I might just as well have kept my observations to myself .
Do not let us press him to tell us his history !
<NAME> silence reigned on the boats .
<NAME> warned them that the <NAME> was inferior in comfort to the <NAME> .
Scarcely recovered from his sufferings , he resumed his ascensions .
And so the <NAME> Government knew where <NAME> & Co. had commenced business .
`` The wind is changing , '' said <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> in the bows , with the lantern , lighted the way .
“ He is alive ! ” exclaimed <NAME> .
The crowd in front prostrated themselves on the ground .
I see it at a glance !
The question was asked by <NAME> .
The management of the vessel was very simple .
During the month of December , the heat was very great .
[ Illustration : View of the `` Seracs '' . ]
After that my life became insupportable to me .
Thus ended our memorable conference , which roused a perfect fever in me .
A dying light gleamed in those eyes once so brilliant .
He was forced to renew his negotiations with each succeeding prince .
Map of the <NAME> and the Gulf of <NAME> .
`` Forut , '' said the guide tranquilly .
It is unnecessary to say that <NAME> had been provided with this comfortable clothing .
The appearance of the land was monotonous , covered as it was with snow .
It was on this ocean river that the <NAME> then sailed .
Did the latter notice the feelings of aversion with which he was regarded ?
This was fortunate , no doubt .
`` But what will they find ? ''
All disappeared , except one who fell mortally wounded on the beach .
The tide began to recede , being quite full .
<NAME> was about to make some angry reply , when the doctor interrupted him .
The crew thought of nothing except this great operation of the launching .
You wish to live at the corral , so be it .
<NAME> <NAME> had won his wager of twenty thousand pounds !
Every provision against immediate danger had been made .
The heart of the army was the fierce <NAME> tribe under <NAME> .
[ Illustration : The <NAME> kill many of the <NAME> . ]
But the gas in his balloon was his blood , his very life !
will you not open the gates of the enclosure to all comers ? ''
`` You do n't object any longer to our shooting ? ''
`` It defends itself well , '' said <NAME> , rubbing his face .
said <NAME> , raising his finger to his lips .
The fine season was swiftly returning .
To my great surprise , I was in my own room .
<NAME> <NAME> and his companions remained an hour at the top of the mountain .
Is it for a sea excursion ? ''
That cry of `` <NAME> '' caused an immediate diversion of our thoughts .
and 214 degrees 39 minutes W. Long .
A few very timid animals were seen under the forest-trees .
I could find no name for these singular formations .
Steps were begun by the foremost guide , and completed by the next .
I asked , in spite of the <NAME> 's shrug of the shoulders .
The colonists spoke but little on the road .
“ Fool , idiot , that I am ! ” at last uttered Paganel .
The whole party then repaired to the <NAME> .
They rapidly destroyed the cairn .
<NAME> must still resign himself to wait .
Among the natives it was quite the reverse .
The forest of the <NAME> supplied the best oaks and elms .
By the middle of June the launch was far advanced and getting into shape .
[ Illustration : `` <NAME> accompanied me . '' ]
Everything was in the state in which it had been left .
“ He must not be moved. ” said <NAME> .
`` So I thought , '' said the doctor .
The mechanical part still remained .
<NAME> <NAME> indicated the place I was to occupy .
“ Well , <NAME> , the north wind is not blowing to-day .
The settlers awaited <NAME> 's return with much anxiety .
No , I can not describe the emotion that vibrated through me .
All seemed dead in the interior of this boat .
The boat touched the landing , place and <NAME> stepped on shore .
330 <NAME> RAISED HIS <NAME> TO STRIKE IT '' .
This was a charge which <NAME> did not need .
<NAME> <NAME> then understood why the health of his enemies continued so good !
“ Ha ! ” said <NAME> , “ blacks instead of crocodiles !
<NAME> attentively to what I say for the last time !
Perhaps we had better think of escaping in some other direction . ''
I 'm not particular about the form . ''
The fire was lighted , and it was easy to preserve some embers .
The <NAME> is one of the most important affluents of the <NAME> .
“ None of that miserable howling !
`` And if it does not ? ''
<NAME> was the credit of <NAME> & Co. , that applications flowed in wholesale .
It might be thought that this was <NAME> .
<NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , greatly astonished , let him proceed .
<NAME> <NAME> captured some cranes which had wandered thus far northward .
And <NAME> joined in with such vigour that at last <NAME> was scandalized .
The doctor had not been able to reconnoitre the country .
I questioned them ; they knew nothing .
Yet once more , on the 2nd March in S. lat .
`` But where is your master going ? ''
This was certainly a rough method of ascertaining the distance traversed !
Provisions , however , became less plentiful .
No firearms -- neither gun nor revolver .
He was a bold and generous man .
`` Well , M. Aronnax , that is wisely said . ''
`` Do n't you see a fine ribbon of light ? ''
`` But <NAME> said he had drifted there . ''
Whether he wished it or no , he had none the less saved <NAME> !
Nothing but the coasts , it will be said .
`` Yes ; everything is lovely and the goose hangs high ! ''
`` When <NAME> comes back he 'll be mightily pleased , '' said <NAME> .
For three days , <NAME> waited for the help which now came too late !
“ Why should there be coal at the Pole ? ” said some .
<NAME> stretched upon a divan in the library , I was suffocating .
<NAME> had imprudently penetrated to the interior of the island to make botanical researches .
he said in his calmest manner .
<NAME> and his party gave him no concern .
The travellers felt their bodies to be as buoyant as a hydrogen balloon .
“ I hope not , ” replied the reporter .
Our voyage now became monotonous and uniform .
`` I have constantly foreseen the likelihood of certain obstacles . ''
It is my opinion that we shall never again see the like .
And this day would make it worse .
However , the steward , during our sleep , had cleared the table .
I feared that the upper support would fail me .
God would do the rest .
Are you the master of the boat ? ''
The square was silent and deserted .
The <NAME> was a steam yacht of the finest description .
We are passing the frontier ! ” “ The frontier ! ” replied <NAME> .
`` He is quite right , '' I said .
`` Do n't you agree with me ? ''
`` Give me the thermometer , '' demanded Vasling .
But how about the <NAME> , <NAME> ?
I wished to leave him all his coolness .
Do not let us leave our geography incomplete . ''
`` It 's eighty feet beneath us , '' answered <NAME> .
Why do you tire your eyes by sitting up late ?
Let him beware who forgets this ! ''
What struggle was going on within him ?
It may be added that the weather had become detestable .
`` It is so , '' replied the general .
There he stopped , and his companions were able to join him .
His bristling hair gave him a sinister aspect .
The half-breed 's lynx eyes will see what we ca n't . ''
It was in the form of an altar , and apparently of artificial construction .
cif._ And this was meaningless !
lat. , and the next day discovered , in S. lat .
Perhaps they are waiting for nightfall to commence the attack .
The explorers could not discover one suspicious trace .
They stopped in the evening at <NAME> , on the edge of the <NAME> .
In <NAME> military uniforms appear on every occasion .
The foremast came down with all the fore-rigging .
They camped on the plateau that night , and next day the descent commenced .
Besides , I heard steps on the platform .
“ With not a soul to govern , ” gloomily rejoined the captain .
So one day he determined to be admitted as one of the travelers .
`` The question then reverts to this : Are these worlds habitable ?
there existed a creek , opposite to what appeared to be a large cavern .
IT WAS SEVEN o ’ clock in the evening .
These reflections , however , did not calm <NAME> .
What _had_ switched them off ?
Towards evening the trench was dug one yard deeper .
<NAME> seconds elapsed between the flash and the report .
It is transformed into heat , and the brake becomes hot .
He was one of the best fellows whose memory lingers at the school .
had not yet been reached when the presence of ice was ascertained .
Am I asking too much ? ''
<NAME> <NAME> again offered <NAME> his old rank on board .
The gas escaped without any possibility of retaining it .
`` Yes , yes , '' repeated the poor fellow , mechanically .
My uncle walked angrily and hopelessly up and down .
To meet would be difficult .
Still the learned secretary was silent .
[ Illustration : <NAME> abandoned by his crew . ]
and rendered even more so by the rays from the stars .
I looked in the direction of the vessel I had already seen .
It was compact granite , through which no living being could force a way .
`` That would be better than doing nothing here , '' returned the colonel .
At this precise moment they must act .
Stores of every kind had been collected in abundance .
Preserved and made into pies we shall have a welcome store !
`` But do you know whether to ascend or descend ? ''
There were drying several pairs of sailors ' trousers .
The horizon appears to retreat before us , more and more as we advance .
The ice had been coasted for a distance of 225 leagues .
Come to their help , or they are lost . )
Then suddenly he cried , “ Now for chance !
I agreed that I thought this a fair calculation .
Yes , -- I thought of another objection .
“ So far the villain had succeeded in his wicked design .
A relapse would be inconvenient to all parties .
<NAME> rain was dashed by the storm into particles like dust .
He found out one morning when he looked into the <NAME> .
We were seated on the platform , with a quiet sea .
So <NAME> and his followers visited this new island of <NAME> .
I had not the remotest idea .
`` Does <NAME> know where the shipwrecked men from the _Jane_ are now ? ''
said <NAME> , `` there is <NAME> with his ideas . ''
He suited all the required conditions ; no wife , child , nor relatives .
How would she reach it ?
A frightful sound was heard .
THE <NAME> <NAME> AT <NAME> .
Until they reached <NAME> the weather continued bad .
There was no water anywhere ; but everywhere absolute , awful drought .
His own sufferings had hardened his heart .
These courageous beasts were engulfed up to their flanks .
exclaimed <NAME> in a tone of perfect incredulity .
What had happened on board ?
oh you unfortunate boy , ” cried <NAME> .
`` No ; not unless you attack them .
No matter ; it 's enough to mention the error .
But the next event to be related is terrible indeed .
if <NAME> could only see us ! ''
“ You should go there one day .
`` <NAME> 's attack is over , '' replied <NAME> .
dear <NAME> , ” said <NAME> .
[ Illustration : The madman disappeared in space ! ]
`` Yes , '' said <NAME> , `` but he did n't succeed . ''
He also notices the skill in physiognomy evinced by the natives .
<NAME> <NAME> was nephew to <NAME> 's Minister of the <NAME> .
[ Illustration : `` A troop of bayadères came in . '' ]
<NAME> was all eyes and ears .
`` They have found the track of some animals , '' answered <NAME> .
What should we do in the midst of that flock of gigantic quadrupeds ?
“ What wound can I have received which could have thus prostrated me ?
Why did n't we hear the report ? ''
In less than an hour we shall be able to decide .
A few white sails enlivened the sparkling water .
What might not be expected of such a man !
the sound of human voices .
beware of the foul air ! ” said <NAME> .
<NAME> , messieurs , a last effort ! ''
I would rather lose an arm than a paw of my poor Satellite . ''
But still he went on teaching , instructing , and praying .
a little more coolness , <NAME> , and let us see how we stand .
`` Let us enter , '' said <NAME> .
Well , that is not quite true ! ''
[ Illustration ] <NAME> rushed towards him .
Upon this the <NAME> decided to give in .
`` Do you believe the captain exists ? ''
At that period the <NAME> were not utilized as they have been since .
Leaving <NAME> in <NAME> , 1797 , he went first to <NAME> .
Owing to the half-breed 's intervention the revolt was instantly quelled .
By one o'clock his glance alone showed signs of life .
<NAME> looked into his face .
exclaimed the sailor ; `` the masters of the island ! ''
cried <NAME> in tones of despair .
The weather was threatening and the breeze blew from the southeast .
It was now forced upon me , and I must tell him the truth .
`` But what shall we do for torches ? ''
At this moment a hard body struck me .
But <NAME> was still mounting .
A considerable share of his master ’ s renown was reflected upon him .
But after four or five years they relinquished all hope .
We were smothered in the tents , for lack of oxygen .
What it would do , I could not guess .
The officers comforted him by promising to be like fathers to him .
[ Illustration : Assassination of <NAME> . ]
The walk and excitement were too much for me in my weak state .
`` I had not thought of that ! ''
Another was on the west of the promontory of <NAME> , and named <NAME> .
Can not you call it to mind ?
This modification of the axis was evidently a public danger .
The <NAME> must not be confounded with the <NAME> .
The soil began to be marshy and boggy , and less favorable to progress .
He listened if his heart was still beating ... .
I 'm not in my senses .
They could not estimate it .
I should never get tired of looking at it ! ''
Not the slightest sign of movement could be detected .
Upon their return the monsoon had changed .
I scarcely had time to look round .
It is probable that , if the <NAME> .
By what right have you dragged me from my islet ? ... .
There he interested the <NAME> and the <NAME> Company in his discovery .
It was certainly less striking and romantic , but it was decidedly safer .
We had reached the coal strata of the <NAME> .
Moreover , we must advance with the age .
But is there such a continent after all ?
Besides there was no wind , which made it much more bearable .
Were they taken prisoners by the <NAME> ?
The steward blushed as he proffered the meager bill of fare .
He came to meet me as soon as he saw me land .
For my own part I believe they are . ''
They take in a vast circumference of the ocean .
<NAME> and unimpeded , the yawl scudded on with incredible speed .
“ What a language ! ” he said .
At last I got to the end of the tilled land .
“ That speech is not like yourself , ” answered <NAME> , smiling .
The doctor thought this an ingenious explanation .
The navigation of the <NAME> Channel was especially calm and pleasant .
No balls , <NAME> , but a triple charge of powder .
<NAME> did not fail to remark the sentiments entertained by <NAME> towards <NAME> .
The faces became as purple as those of <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> was a little chilly , it must be confessed .
On the 23rd of June he reached 60 degrees N .
On the opposite side towards the door , the enclosure remained dark .
`` I am not mistaken , '' replied the reporter .
Besides , the cipo bore away to the north , and toward the river .
In the expectation of the next day they could not but feel some emotion .
`` Time will show , '' calmly replied the president .
It was five in the morning .
[ Footnote 1 : The word _calotte_ here used by <NAME> is untranslateable .
This was , I thought , a question of some importance .
<NAME> and desolation were all around !
It was <NAME> , <NAME> .
He then comprehended that their search had been fruitless .
The island is not inhabited , ” said the reporter .
On what were they to live on the way ?
But in this indifference <NAME> was far from participating .
The <NAME> returned to <NAME> .
The crater was again boiling with lava which overflowed the back of the volcano .
To failure , therefore , our travellers had to make up their minds .
I have no right to speak . ''
All this is utter loss of time .
The axis was a perpendicular line cutting the <NAME> , and marked N.S .
Renewed and strict precautions were therefore taken .
The <NAME> of the Casting XVI .
Hitherto I had never known what hunger really meant .
But all their efforts were in vain .
The tranquil <NAME> waited , without betraying any emotion .
His friends no longer expected him there .
The crew received orders to enter the Gulf of <NAME> with the greatest delight .
Then all our past sufferings were forgotten .
Come now , <NAME> , consider a little , if you can .
They loved each other ; the parents desired nothing better for their son .
`` The captain questioned us , '' replied <NAME> .
But <NAME> was a brave and energetic man .
He never doubted of the justice of my cause .
Another difficulty was added to these perils .
But this atmosphere on fire suggested a thought to <NAME> .
I quivered all over with excitement and hope !
Since then , he always called him Dr Spilett .
`` Yes , our island is beautiful and good , '' replied <NAME> .
I already had sufficient of the mad and monstrous enterprise .
<NAME> <NAME> drew the first .
On the 16th of February , the <NAME> cast anchor near <NAME> .

The gate was shut as usual .
But that is impossible now !
It will support a man all the rest of his life . ''
<NAME> Vaillant however hastened to press on .
In a minute the corral was crossed , and <NAME> stood before the hut .
The moment <NAME> came on deck , he knelt down reverently .
The name of <NAME> had enabled him to discover it !
[ Illustration : Itinerary of <NAME> 's route in equinoctial <NAME> . ]
Suddenly the <NAME> uttered a wild , unearthly cry .
<NAME> was evidently ebbing slowly and his extremities were already cold .
It came upon me like a flash of lightning .
`` A tall man would hardly be twelve inches in his boots ! ''
Monkeys have the same habit !

It appeared to be well populated .
“ They are only wolves ! ” said he .
The beginning of an immense excavation could be seen under the water .
Did he come here voluntarily ?
What shocks upon these reefs when the wind drowns the breaking of the waves !
I determined as a last resource to examine the compass .
`` Very likely ; but useful to the whole world , '' said <NAME> .
We should run aground to a certainty ! ''
It was probably of meteoric origin .
I certainly should not ask you to brave its severity .
Their eyebrows are dyed the same colour .
`` It was fairy-like , my friend .
I seemed to be actually getting better under the influence of this novelty .
From them <NAME> had nothing to fear as he hastened towards the town .
The <NAME> knew whom he had to deal with .
It was now half past eleven .
His house resounded with the sharpness of his voice .

To drink , we had blanda , skimmed milk with water .
`` Aim carefully at the passage ! ''
This , however , is a question for psychologists to decide .
<NAME> 's courage did not falter .
<NAME> , with firm step , followed the <NAME> .

After some parleying , about thirty of the natives crossed the river .
“ Then I conclude— ” he said .
Two months later she was ready for sea .
“ Let us look for him !
The operation of launching it was extremely simple .
Thus matters went for an hour , without any end appearing probable .

It was quite an artillery museum .
It is magnificent , splendid -- an idea worthy of my father .

An encounter with the <NAME> would have been fatal to the <NAME> .
I could not remain quiet .
`` We manufacture air only partly , friend <NAME> , '' replied <NAME> .
Still the prompt maneuver of <NAME> succeeded in keeping the <NAME> off the breakers .
The gallery into which we had entered was very wide .
`` I am going to try it . ''
Who is this Silfax ? ” THIS name revealed everything to the old overman .
“ Have we any chance of escape , captain ? ” asked the sailor .
No painter could ever transfer a lunar landscape to his canvas .
Did a brighter light burn in the depths of that obscured mind ?
`` I can scarcely compliment you upon it .
The harbor was full of a very good tasting shellfish .
The same thought had occurred to both of us .
“ Bring it to Baltimore ! ” said <NAME> .
said <NAME> , taking it from him .
How long had this state of things lasted ?
A useless trip , entailing the death of one of his men !
`` What is the matter now ? ''
Soon the last of the twilight faded away .
The upper sails had been reefed .
The colonists hastened to the dockyard .
His silence , of course , did not last long .
“ Yes , ” said he , “ they are at a sharp trot .
How could I be otherwise ?
There were then three hundred leagues to be added to the grand total .
I proceed with my narrative as I did before I commenced my daily notes .
There was something solemn in this setting out .
`` But who is it that has played us this cool trick ? ''
The impassive <NAME> was superior to all circumstances .
`` So far the villain had succeeded in his wicked design .
Our imagination was kept at its height , interjections followed quickly on each other .
Could <NAME> still be that man ?
This man is <NAME> .
who comes here ? ” asked the engineer , stopping <NAME> .
“ We shall do everything in the world to find our lost friend again .
“ Let us go on with our exploration , ” said <NAME> .
Judge a little for yourselves .
Everything at last was ready .
The settlers hunted too the turtles which frequented the shores of <NAME> Mandible .
`` He ought to be in command of a flag-ship . ''
The engineer did not try to overcome the obstacle , and he was wise .
Had <NAME> 's ingenuity been attended with a fortunate result ?
“ What do you mean , <NAME> ? ” exclaimed <NAME> .
He will make us a bridge when we want one .
`` <NAME> , '' said he , `` I am dying .
`` God has come to our aid , '' said <NAME> .
“ And forty ! ” said the Major .
Why should we be unable to preserve a remembrance of them ? ''
I had no means of repairing it .
One contingency there was , almost too terrible to be taken into account .
`` Notice one thing , my worthy <NAME> , '' I resumed .
The bears , at first surprised , crowded about this new prey .
There was half a minute yet .
It was after the time of the midday distribution of letters .
A glass of wine perhaps ?
But such a decision could not be pleasing to <NAME> and <NAME> .
We were near forgetting our dear old Mother , the <NAME> .
The radiant orb was saluted by a triple hurrah .
It was nine o ’ clock in the morning .
In support of his request he adduced some very plausible reasons .
I shall cross the bay .
He seated himself close to the bed .
The horizon , free from fog , made observation easy .
I see a sort of sphinx surmounting the southern peak -- the sea-sphinx .
Means for hollowing it failed them utterly .
`` What difference is it to you ?
This diminution is considerable , but according to my calculations it is nothing less .
They had been completely stunned , but had sustained no injury whatever .
But <NAME> 's dexterity and the <NAME> 's strength surmounted all obstacles .
<NAME> undertook the task of rousing <NAME> from his grief .
<NAME> this a pirate vessel ?
Nearly seventy dollars to each man ; this was a strong temptation .
It was impossible to divine what future lay before them .
So the launch seemed hung in a bottomless abyss .
In less than a second the light gave place to the most profound obscurity .
Was he not justified , since the safety of the crew depended upon him ?
Therefore , do not economise the ammunition .
`` May the devil send it to the bottom ! ''
The task was an arduous one .
`` What is the matter now ? ''
And yet , when he saw <NAME> , he also recognized his mother .
We slept in the moonlight at a height of 1200 fathoms .
“ Fire-arm ! ” exclaimed <NAME> , with flashing eyes .
In another settlement a more friendly reception was met with .
<NAME> looked puzzled and uneasy .
After half an hour 's walk the soil became stony .
I had not got over the excitement of the discovery of water .
In a few hours <NAME> was much calmer .
The curtain slowly rose over the vast watery stage .
<NAME> <NAME> stood before him .
My muscles could not contract .
But there was no doubt that he was right .
The captain , shaking his head , answered nothing .
Do you propose to pursue the <NAME> ? ''
As for game , there was a complete preserve awaiting the hunters .
`` How is it that we can not see her ? ''
This was a very excellent proposition , and no doubt , a correct one .
shouted <NAME> , who had run forward .
Besides , he knows what awaits him if he budges .
It was later known by its native name of <NAME> .
They waited till the necessity of breathing would bring the manatees up again .

Hunting for game became compulsory to procure food in larger quantity .
<NAME> remained at the onagas ' heads to hold them .
Can you reproach me with a single blunder ? ” “ Not one .
Therefore , he awaited the next day with the greatest anxiety .
“ The surface of a sphere ?
But what would she do with them ?
retorted <NAME> , with an air of raillery .
The scoundrels took their measures accordingly .
That is why , sir , I must be on my guard . ''
`` Would you give your projectile a diameter of sixty feet ? ''
`` Willingly , '' answered the doctor 's companions .
in 1740 by order of the <NAME> de Maurepas .
Why , after all , should it not be so ?
<NAME> had a lively and reverent love for the engineer .
We must prevent their seeing us , if possible . ''
But this time when <NAME> reappeared , her look was full of hope .
He was listening to the history of the young gentlemen .
It was evident that the engineer and his companions had employed their day well .
`` Exactly ; sailing all around her . ''
A curious fashion not before noticed amongst the islanders of <NAME> prevails amongst them .

`` Will you carry me and three other persons to Liverpool ? ''
But where could that be ?

The crew fought with their axes .
Toward half-past six cries of joy arose .
`` I have nothing to say to that , '' answered <NAME> .
Addressing one of these authors who was waiting his turn , `` Capital !
In addition , the surface of the water is far from being completely clear .
<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> worked together , sometimes chemists , sometimes experimentalists .
A frightful sound was heard .
`` I feel no interest in the subject , '' said my uncle .
There was no third course .
And he did not find it !
`` You hope , then , that <NAME> will succeed in his projects ? ''
It was a long and fatiguing chase .
“ <NAME> on fast ! ” cried <NAME> .
It was a good Scotch dinner .
<NAME> signaled to <NAME> to resume his descent .
A loud whistle interrupted the discussion .
The whole distance by land from <NAME> to <NAME> is twelve days ' journey .
Temper your springs with your best steel .
Flowing thus from one to the other , it finally reaches the plain below .
<NAME> followed him without uttering a word .
They felt almost as if they had been suddenly deprived of their sight .
The <NAME> and his officers did not spare themselves on this occasion .
<NAME> forever to all weariness of arms or feet !
I have nothing more to say to you .
`` I have had a narrow escape !

At six o ’ clock the steward served up a refreshing meal .
They are situated in 40 degrees 5 minutes S. lat .
`` Will master let me make a slit ? ''
“ They will know when it is best to rejoin us .
It was absolutely without issue -- a mere blind alley in the earth .
Two hours later a large steamer exchanged signals with them .
It was only after some difficulty that he was dissuaded from the attempt .
But M'Nicholl could not accept the situation so coolly .
The huts of these savages were pretty and well built .
with such an ingenious education it is no wonder the natives submit .
Its depth is not known .
<NAME> <NAME> could not imagine .
Was n't it chance alone that favored him ? ''
My uncle wrung his hands with deep and silent gratitude .
“ <NAME> , I ask this as a favor .
“ An adorable creature , ” he called it .
The engineer 's companions , respecting the wish of the dying man , retired .
It takes but a little while to inflate a balloon with hot air .
`` My friends -- '' said the doctor .
The blackboard he struck with his back was hurled down in the corner .
It was quarter past six in the morning of Thursday , August 18th .
It contains the scientific conclusion regarding this great experiment of the <NAME> .
`` Certainly , '' replied the doctor , who wished to avoid useless discussion .
A fine breeze from the east carried us along gaily .
[ Illustration : The <NAME> of <NAME> . ]
Had he not concealed <NAME> 's errand from his master ?
Certainly his manner was not likely to frighten the game .
He lived with his family as the penguins lived in their rookeries .
Did you ever seen him eat anything ?
A few words only with respect to these Tartars .
He soon reached the clergyman 's house , but found him not at home .
Still worse than that was his conduct later .
It was impossible for me to pause to inquire .
What could be the cause of this phenomenon ?
The wind then became favourable , and three days later <NAME> was reached .
A quarter of an hour was passed in anxious waiting .
His name is Rajah-sultan Manzor . ''
<NAME> , at <NAME> ’ s orders , kept behind .
The bomb would not go off after all .
`` Are we shipwrecked , or what ? ''
<NAME> quietly and attentively watched him .
The <NAME> robbed him of all he possessed , and fled .
The other would talk a great deal , but say very little .
Why , that story is due to the powerful imagination of our great poet .
“ The shipwrecked men were taken prisoners , as they feared .
The night was very dark .

<NAME> was isolated from the rest of the world .
Thus he could not determine its nature exactly .
`` And you know where it lies ? ''
<NAME> then reached <NAME> , where <NAME> provided him with twenty-four native soldiers .
`` I will put it to you more plainly .
At the latter the <NAME> landed .
The young girl appeared to be about sixteen or seventeen years of age .
`` Yes ; because it was afraid of the Mexicans ! ''
`` Quicker , I mean , '' replied the <NAME> .
That flag was the <NAME> flag !
All their wishes were satisfied .
“ Do you know what I was thinking about ? ” said <NAME> .
[ Illustration : A kafila of slaves .
The sublime horror of this spectacle passed all description .
But he could not long continue so unequal a struggle .
<NAME> advanced toward him , and friendly relations were speedily established between them .
In vain the <NAME> Practical Association tried to stem the rising tide .
`` But are you not mistaken ? ''
According to <NAME> dogs and otters are the only quadrupeds of the country .
There were certain things of which they were perfectly certain .
He went outside , placed the instrument on the ice , and soon returned .
<NAME> <NAME> and his companions could therefore proceed in security .
<NAME> thought he would please his master by giving him a pretty large one !
In the meantime the explorers ’ situation was bad enough .
Who knows that they will not listen to us ?
It increased , and soon a ship appeared in sight .
If an accident happened , how we should regret it !
<NAME> , we have encountered this barrier ; but <NAME> is there beyond !
“ By-the-by , what o ’ clock is it ? ” asked the captain .
`` It 's impossible to go on . ''
The sky was literally on fire .
<NAME> called this archipelago the <NAME> .
This is a reef knot , and I always make a running bowline . ''
What was he doing at this moment ?
There the sailor developed his project , which was indeed extremely simple .
`` What pleases God , '' answered the boatswain .
All was ready for the start .
64 degrees 45 minutes and W. long .
At nine in the morning he reached the corral .
Most likely an encounter had taken place .
It was a refusal couched in terms as little polite as they were equivocal .
At six o'clock in the morning the little band set out .
they are coming ! ” said <NAME> .
It was a dazzling sight .
Yes , all these wonders have been wrought by the accumulator and the transformer .
For one hour a plain of sand lay stretched before us .
`` But what reason can he have had for acting in this way ? ''
Operations now commenced for preparing proper winter quarters .
[ Illustration : `` I plunged my pike into his breast . '' ]
The obstruction of the fissures was clearly visible by the light of the lamp .
<NAME> <NAME> first recognised this on the 6th of December .
`` Because , <NAME> , that beast is made of sheet iron . ''
If my astonishment increased , my patience was well-nigh exhausted .
Might his life , if not saved , be prolonged for some days ?
`` A curious place , this <NAME> ? ''
Soon they perceived the shadowy outline of the wood showing faintly through the darkness .
All this decided D'Urville against the further prosecution of this voyage .
“ We are on the right track ! ” he exclaimed .
Grands Voyages , <NAME> , part Assassination of <NAME> .
The most brilliant speaker of the gathering was a chief called <NAME> .
From this moment the state of things became intolerable .
And he made known to them the result of his observations .
My eyes soon accustomed themselves to this relative state of darkness .
She advanced across the straits , among which lay ice-plains thirty feet thick .
<NAME> , almost unconscious , saw or heard nothing .
Such going and coming , and running and riding and shouting !
They left the sledge in charge of <NAME> , and hastened after the captain .
[ Illustration : Exterior view of the house .
`` That is not admissible , '' replied the engineer .
And while putting the question his face was pale as that of a corpse .
A very hard nut to crack .
<NAME> <NAME> , the reporter , and the sailor , walked in front .
And then the scissors to do their work .
Who could tell that it might not prove some day their only refuge ?
I beg to be allowed to get out ! ''
A cry of fury broke from everyone !
I had some dealings formerly with a captain of that name .
His eyes flashed with excitement .
I felt a mortal cold freeze my stiffened and half-paralysed limbs .
<NAME> this the beginning of a massacre ?
We must not give up the game .
No murmurs , no recrimination disturbed these labours .
They asked for nothing more -- they gave thanks .
<NAME> , tempest , impracticable roads , rocks , icebergs -- nothing stops him .
But they 'll be destroyed first !
There was not a moment to be lost .
I opened -- or I imagined I opened my eyes .
It is hard to say .
`` You see about that , while I explore the coast . ''
It was also the most direct way to reach the mountain .
It was evident that the intruders had wished to guard themselves against a surprise .
A <NAME> cap was on his head .
Tall and well-made , their women are , comparatively speaking , pretty .
The unproductiveness of their labours was only too apparent .
`` To get within ten feet of him without his suspecting it . ''
76 degrees 8 minutes and E. long .
However , the past did not necessarily answer for the future .
cried <NAME> , pointing to a place about eight hundred yards from the boat .
The engineer knocked at the door .
When a toast was drunk to the <NAME> , <NAME> was simply silent .
The <NAME> had let his finger rest on the page of the <NAME> .
This last blow to the work of the colonists was terrible .
But the rosy light which guided us increased and lit up the horizon .
The geographer was thrown down the forecastle ladder and disappeared below .
Should the settlers fall into their hands , they must expect no mercy !
The same bulwark-surrounded hollows , the same abrupt projections of surface .
There is no harm done in getting as far away from them as possible .
It was impossible for us to say .
What I suffered it is useless to record .
<NAME> <NAME> recollected that this elevation gradually sloped towards the level of the sea .
replied <NAME> , returning to the car as coolly as usual .
<NAME> <NAME> must have gone in search of it .
The doctor acquainted his companions with the invitation .
I saw the haggard eye ; I saw the different phases of the fight .
The two detachments separated on the 24th July .
They were evidently ready to fire at a moment 's notice .
Soon fresher air was felt .
And we , who sail the <NAME> , should we venture to doubt it ?
you would not find an inn , not a tavern !
I began to understand my uncle 's anger .
Innocent ! ” ON <NAME> <NAME> of the judge the mournful procession halted .
No flag fluttered from its mast , and I could not discover its nationality .
I thought it time , but made no observations on that point .
“ Nothing , ” answered the clerk , smiling .
The <NAME> , propelled by her wonderful screw , went straight at the animal .
All business , work , and amusement are strictly forbidden during that time .
But we shall keep the skin as a memento . ''
Three days were occupied in repairs .
<NAME> time_ shows clearly the doctor 's character .
The soil we were treading had been ravaged , wrecked , torn by convulsion .
On my word , she 's a swift boat . ''
230 Map of <NAME> .
“ Fugitives are escaping from the town .
This sheet of water was christened <NAME> , or <NAME> , by <NAME> .
One man alone remained by <NAME> .
They knew that <NAME> was inhabited .
“ My father a murderer ? ” exclaimed <NAME> , rushing toward <NAME> .
He breathed a sigh of relief .
Had the object of the explosion been to discover a new vein ?
“ The country is superb ! ” said the doctor .
These errors had caused singular mistakes .
It was <NAME> who spoke thus , looking into <NAME> 's lovely eyes .
This fearful experience lasted seven weeks without intermission .
`` We can not alter the motion of the projectile ? ''
The plateau of <NAME> presented an encouraging aspect .
“ Go on ! ” shouted <NAME> to the engineer .
<NAME> implements had no value for these people .
While the tube was being built the enormous projectile was in process of manufacture .
For some minutes no one stirred .
No ; though not teetotallers , they never drank to excess .
Everywhere on the appearance of the ships , the <NAME> canoes took to flight .
On close examination I found that he was not mistaken .
It was <NAME> , which the map gave as exactly on the 38th parallel .
A violent movement of interest and surprise here greeted this remark of the speaker .
“ I hope so , ” replied <NAME> .
“ Therefore , my friends , ” rejoined <NAME> , “ no more parting .
The sun would soon altogether disappear .
As for the <NAME> , it seemed quiet and mysterious as ever .
This air we breathe is the air of the Pole !
why at the outset had he not told all to his benefactor ?
`` The iron boat should be there , '' said the engineer .
Now what country would afford the richest ornithological harvest ?
He saw the natives eating steatite .
Rather uneasy , I paused and looked eagerly around .
`` What do you conclude from this rigmarole of yours ? ''
Suddenly he grasped <NAME> ’ s arm , exclaiming : “ Look !
The bath was cool , fresh and invigorating .
“ This case which I held -- which I gave back to him !
Then we shall be sure not to be stopped on our journey ! ''
So still that I could hear the beatings of my own heart !
<NAME> <NAME> was ending the evening with one of these .
They gave him his way , and the wagon went on slowly .
At this moment the travelers once more entered the blessed rays of the sun .
Thus passed the 25th of March .
and had she now approached to be a satellite of the new-born world ?
But the coal-beds from which our carbon at present chiefly comes are not inexhaustible .
The sea was calm , and the winds were favourable .
We will build a decked boat , and I will undertake to steer her .
`` For how long a time ? ''
Decidedly , I am nothing but an ass ! ''
Looking upward , it was impossible to discover where the stupendous roof began .
He ate no more ; he slept no more !
But this done : “ <NAME> ! ” said she .
Was he reserved for some cruel torture at <NAME> ?
The deafening howls suddenly ceased : they seemed to be going away .
They are the vilest , I grant , of the human race .
`` It is going on , <NAME> , '' replied the burgomaster .
“ I beg your pardon ! ” returned <NAME> .
A black mass soon appeared .
I told my companions what had passed .
At last this long night passed .
`` But we are more than three miles from it , '' said <NAME> .
asked M'Nicholl a little crustily .
Had it gone back to the motionless bed of water ?
`` The rascal is off , after all ! ''
`` Where do you wish to go , sir ? ''
The intervention of Torres he had regarded throughout as being quite secondary for him .
The others were still thirteen to our ten .
At that time the position of the brig was interesting .
Let us have a good search . ''
There would be no storms , no lee-shore to fear .
During this time , <NAME> and I chose the best fruits of the bread-fruit .
`` An offence has been committed on <NAME> soil .
The life was , in fact , the same .
“ Go on fast , ” was the reply .
the balloon could not stand it .
It would have been too horrible !
`` He will be dead in two hours . ''
No one returns from <NAME> ; but still -- you know human nature .
`` Because the facts we are discussing are eleven years old . ''
You must be models of canine deportment .
In a few moments they were near the closed door of the house .
That worthy , however , shook his head .
Do you not reckon me ? ” “ Pshaw !
In fine , <NAME> felt that the doctor was slipping through his fingers .
His companions stared at each other , scarcely believing their ears .
There are no inns along this road from one ocean to another .
Above me was the calm surface of the sea .
The condemned man was lost .
“ <NAME> you the truth , man ! ” cried <NAME> .
He had nothing more to fear .
Indeed , the inhabited shores offered anywhere an easy refuge .
The chain of <NAME> appears in all its majesty .
<NAME> 's face seemed to have a singular expression .
`` Something very simple , and which is already half done . ''
But that is not the question .
<NAME> <NAME> spoke to him .
In my hurry -- I -- I forgot -- '' `` What ? ''
“ Let us have a glass of punch .
All means were legitimate that might secure the word of the enigma .
They must give up all idea of finding it .
The heat still remained at quite a supportable degree .
<NAME> <NAME> was full of the most gloomy forebodings .
`` How shall we start this experiment ? ''
Everyone would turn against me , even <NAME> , perhaps . ''
The whist-players were quite absorbed in their game .
`` What do you think , <NAME> ? ''
`` Perhaps I am , '' answered <NAME> , seriously .
His enemies and rivals knew that only too well .
It was he who had united his companions in exile in the common cause .
on every sheep , which would bring him in pounds 3,750 .
Presently , through the glass , they saw a boat lowered .
Then the rope plays its part .
`` But I ca n't see any fruit on this shrub ! ''
They could go to <NAME> and return rapidly without having to tack .
From their shoulders hung gay-colored cloaks .
<NAME> therefore decided not to stop .
<NAME> and <NAME> also watched by turns , and did not spare fuel .
The doctor obeyed him as a dog obeys his master .
In short , <NAME> believed that fortune had turned against them .
<NAME> , without a word , raised his arm , a shot !
<NAME> , through his glasses , observed these rifts with great attention .
The wind had died away completely with the twilight .
After this first operation , the metal was sent on to <NAME> .
And there is no confusion withal .
The <NAME> was announced to leave <NAME> at five the next morning .
To them all seems natural .
The burning liquid had then spread through the forest of the <NAME> .
In truth it was a magnificent work !
`` Or at the bottom of the Gulf of <NAME> ? ''
It was that of <NAME> .
However , one of them was not quite satisfied : it was <NAME> .
And his companions were just as cheerful .
Produced by <NAME> by <NAME> of Contents I .
The scene which followed , who can describe ?
What a heart , and what eyes !
Are you quite sure , <NAME> , that you are not mistaken ? ''
The carriage was reserved for President <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> .
The country was becoming more broken , and even mountainous .
Our boat was moored about sixty feet from us .
Was the <NAME> older or younger than the <NAME> in the order of <NAME> ?
They could not speak the <NAME> language , and their assistance was mercilessly refused .
There the fertility is splendid ; the pasturage is incomparable .
Each article was carefully examined , especially the books , instruments and weapons .
Whether she did so or not , she made not the slightest movement .
Have the convicts appeared in the neighbourhood ?
<NAME> , multiply the surface by the third of the radius .
Major <NAME> and his friends were on the terrace of their hotel .
<NAME> assumed a dead calm , and ceased to breathe .
The captain and the sailor made a trial trip in it during the day .
In fact , the mountain was a volcano .
She found her way by the light from the flashes .
Other misfortunes followed upon this one .
The interview had already lasted some minutes when <NAME> returned .
They waited , therefore , although they were anxious to be reunited at <NAME> .
The <NAME> usually floated between fifty and a hundred fathoms deep .
Let us examine these three forces .
He stood still and made no resistance .
The <NAME> 's signal did not come .
We have no ballast like balloon-men . ''
After a stay in <NAME> , situated in 47 degrees 51 minutes N. lat .
But there again they were all safe .
<NAME> , at <NAME> 's orders , kept behind .
`` <NAME> , '' was his sole spoken reply .
What good would all this wealth do you ?
This it was which was whistling in the mist .
Two hours after our departure it only marked fifty-four degrees Fahrenheit .
65 degrees and about W. long .
This northern hemisphere presented vast plains , dotted with isolated mountains .

A sort of uneasiness had seized <NAME> upon the subject of his vessel .
The kibitka was now only half a verst from <NAME> .

And what have we seen ?
“ At the beginning , ” replied <NAME> .
“ He will never come back ! ” exclaimed <NAME> .
I began , therefore , to listen again with the most breathless attention .
After he had received the presents brought for him , <NAME> became less friendly .
I am looking for a wind that will take me back toward the equator .
asked <NAME> , reddening at the sarcastic tone in which these words were uttered .

“ No , sir , but I will swim .
My good humor began to assume a mythological character .
Five minutes more and I should have lost my head !
Besides this , another reason by no means less serious presented itself to us .
They could not possibly know our real intentions .
They were about to start .
He traveled over the whole of <NAME> .
That is the first reason . ''
`` And what is the average pulsation you found ? ''
His complexion was attributed to illness .
Perhaps they were still there ?

This fact need surprise no one .
<NAME> <NAME> went to his post .
My advice , after some hesitation , was followed or attempted to be followed .
There was now eight feet of the opening above the water .
In the meanwhile the brig continued to advance towards <NAME> .

This sea we have crossed is the sea of the Pole !
`` And who knows where that is ? ''
<NAME> and he became most intimate .
Catch the idea now , eh ? ''
Those who were best off had only two juveniles on their knees .
I thought that , under these circumstances , escape would be possible .
A shower of balls fell on the raft .
But the latter was not an invariable part of their dress .
The following day was remarkable by its lack of any particular incidents .
Some natives attacked it with arrows , which fortunately hit no one .
cried <NAME> , whom this word seemed to excite prodigiously .
If he appeared more open with any one , it was with <NAME> .
The three travellers did not speak .

Perhaps the <NAME> may have attempted that which the <NAME> accomplished .
`` Why does your captain object to taking me on his ship ? ''
The sailors hastened to their places .
Here , too , lived the <NAME> , who so long resisted the <NAME> .
Every trace of the storm , even the faintest , had disappeared .
An hour afterward and the field of horns lay two miles behind .
They let the talk go on without making any change in their habits .
But this error would not influence the determination which it was necessary to take .
“ This is nothing , ” he said .
We had scarcely turned it when we uttered a cry of admiration .
Do you think such a question ever occurred to them ?
What do you mean by that ? ''
What they were no one knew , and the good-tempered fellow did not explain .
' I left him near here four months ago . '
In the atmosphere towards the southern horizon stretched a white dazzling band .
A discussion was going on when he entered .
“ What ’ s the matter ? ” asked the engineer .

`` Was n't I right in considering this pretended discovery as a mere hypothesis ?
`` They seem uneasy , <NAME> . ''

They do not profess <NAME> and have implicit confidence in their `` grigris . ''
But this was a delusive hope .
His hands and feet hardly caught the ratlines .
Had they gone to some desert island of the <NAME> ?
`` I said , ‘ And <NAME> -- poor Pym . ' ''
All blasphemy and swearing was to be punished with severity , and also drunkenness .
`` No , but in the suburbs of the city . ''
All had been taken away or destroyed , according to order .
`` Which must have been attended with a tremendous report ? ''
Why it is only a little walk . ''
<NAME> vapors , which could not have been clouds , were floating around them .
He lay down at the side attacked by the savage pack .
How they longed to be able to add that it would not return !
The <NAME> of <NAME> had instituted a competition .
`` And prepare our second cornfield ! ''
By-and-by they skirted vast salt lakes , rapidly evaporating .
At <NAME> we were attacked by seven boats , but succeeded in repulsing them .
Let me see your tongue .

The engineer , leaving <NAME> for an instant , came out ready to fire .
The circumference occupied by these 1,200 ovens presented a length of two miles .
“ I begin to perceive that they teach us nothing , ” replied <NAME> .
I allude to the original seamen who were so devoted to their captain .
What immense service he has rendered to geography !
was the overwhelming reply ; difficult , no doubt , but still quite possible .
This cavern was just as <NAME> had left it .
<NAME> has completely revolutionized the conditions of navigation .
said <NAME> ; `` one would want a portable crane .
We must think about it . ''
The engineer 's advice was good .
He is by no means confident !
But the whole question resolves itself into this .
“ Ah , what a day of agony that was !
shouted <NAME> , whose experienced eye soon detected it .
At the same time a treaty of alliance , offensive and defensive was concluded .
<NAME> had better take care !
I 'll even let up a little if you consider the expression too strong !
But this time the effect ought to have been a hundred times as great .

cried <NAME> `` But what in the world can there be in it ? ''
<NAME> gave an account of the <NAME> ’ S voyage across the <NAME> .
It was a desert , but a desert by order of the Czar .
Not a living creature was to be seen .
“ What a queer town ! ” said <NAME> .
What proof have we that an eruption is not shortly about to take place ?
Thus , the <NAME> quickly began to assume a more rounded form .
Still it was a positive fact that someone was speaking .
They both required food and rest .
We approached the surface of the sea rapidly .
Were these the first blows aimed by adverse fortune at the colonists ?
They reached their destination on the morning of the 14th of November .
Cutting a piece from it would have been like cutting off a limb .
<NAME> <NAME> hailed the invisible yacht , but there was no response .

The king came on board with six or eight of his principal subjects .
On reaching the island of <NAME> , <NAME> dropped anchor off <NAME> .

One inexplicable fact preoccupied <NAME> .
This change , which <NAME> verified , did not fail to surprise them .
What had become of them ?
The oars rested on the rowlocks .
He was a gentle animal , though very powerful and wonderfully active .
After visiting <NAME> , <NAME> of <NAME> went to <NAME> .
So <NAME> dreamt only of reaching the shores of <NAME> .
`` Let us have the splendid idea ! ''
`` Well , but it means nothing , '' was the angry answer .
These animals attacked one another with inconceivable fury .
Besides , what could he make of it ?
Our children know why I am now talking to you .
<NAME> was but just breaking , and the country was wrapped in peaceful darkness .
And that is why the secretary of the <NAME> was not hanged .
Gradually these animals became very shy and hard to approach .
<NAME> <NAME> counted on gaining twelve hours in the same way .
<NAME> engineers could not be troubled with such trifles .
What was he to do ?
said <NAME> , `` we shall not want for either furs or game ! ''
The animal had received two wounds , and still struggled desperately .
<NAME> and cock were reinstated in their coop .
`` It is our unfortunate dog !
The bell now announced the breakfast hour .
This was not included in their first plan .
About four thousand persons were present at this kind of national congress . ''
What could be going on there ?
For a few moments he paced up and down , much agitated .
For twenty-four hours they remained in sight of <NAME> without getting a foot forward .
It measured three feet in length .
“ Our poor companions ! ” murmured <NAME> .
The principal buildings it contained were two mosques and a <NAME> church .

The pirogues divided into two parties to surround the <NAME> boats .
The bait took at once , though the shark was full fifty yards distant .
<NAME> <NAME> ’ s soldiers halted at the outposts of the camp .

At heart , both were not without feeling some emotion .
To the hangman with her secrets !
A quarter of an hour passed without his putting any more questions .
By the <NAME> , you do little honour to your signature ! ''
It was the 20th of February .
Let us reflect a little .
And now , whence had this chest come ?

“ What is it , then ? ” asked <NAME> .
Two children were born to them , whom they tenderly loved .
Our sailor will live. ” “ Where is <NAME> ? ” asked <NAME> .
<NAME> was the first to speak .
`` I see how it is , '' said <NAME> .
But this journey was not destined at all to resemble the first .
At this time <NAME> had not yet proved the non-existence of an Antarctic Continent .
I could not all at once bring my brain to think .
All of life was concentrated in the heart and head .
There my eye fell upon the compass .
And such a map seen through a lens will appear reversed in all respects .
A kind of calm swiftly succeeded to the tempest which raged within him .
`` She ca n't be far off now , '' returned his companion .
`` I beg you , <NAME> , '' said the engineer .
“ This is but a passing fit of weakness .
watch the sheets ! ” An involuntary cry broke forth from all on board .
But no ghost or anything else appeared upon the ancient walls .
He it was who warned the dogs of the approach of danger .
[ Illustration : Kublaï-Khan 's feast on the arrival of the <NAME> <NAME> . ]
Thus ended this unfortunate expedition .
Baskets suspended from steam-cranes permitted them to satisfy their curiosity .
I am not asking you anything that could compromise you .
<NAME> <NAME> was with them .
`` But what 's in this chest ? ''
I asked , for I had resolved to enter into the adventure .
Even a Euclid or an Archimedes would have been proud of them !
“ Then what conclusion may be drawn ? ” asked the reporter .
The time for starting had arrived .
<NAME> , followed by the rest , urged on his horse .
If the expedition were skilfully conducted the results could not fail to be considerable .
It is an unpardonable mistake , one unworthy of a secretary of the <NAME> .
But the brave girl had not lost her presence of mind .
The role of conductor was therefore assigned to him .
No incident of any importance occurred that night or the following day .
On his breast glittered a cross and several medals .
After all , the island was large and fertile .
`` Engineer , put on more pressure . ''
It is much relished by <NAME> and <NAME> .
This dial hanging in front of us indicates the speed of the <NAME> .
The unfortunate <NAME> 's fidelity was now put to a hard proof .
`` What _can_ be going on ? ''
But they did not carry it without great loss .
The <NAME> carried sixty-eight men .
“ At last ! ” said <NAME> .
How is that for high ? ''
<NAME> only was prouder than he !
No roughness was found either in the channel or the green sea .
muttered <NAME> as he turned the tap for the first dish .
But I should be content if I could accompany her to <NAME> !
We were affianced , and loved one another very sincerely .
Was the island still inhabited by the castaway to whose succor they had come ?
“ Come along then ! ” said he .
The raft was quite twenty fathoms distant .
“ Keep cool , <NAME> , ” said his master .
Instead of a worthy and learned scholar , he found a dull ill-mannered peasant .
We shall have far to walk , and must climb a mountain .
It is our business to make a right use of them .
“ What is done can not be undone , ” replied <NAME> .
We have proof enough of that .
Here the trees were fewer .
They have put into the hands of man a power that is almost infinite .
<NAME> <NAME> was devoted , body and soul , to his superior officer .
70 Member of the body-guard of the <NAME> of <NAME> .
But the two betrothed did not even perceive the enchanting prospect .
For <NAME> and me it would be the definite abandonment of <NAME> .
At five o ’ clock dinner was served in the dining-room of <NAME> .
“ What is the matter , <NAME> ? ” asked the engineer .
From <NAME> la Vega .
I concentrated instead > on producing an accurate rendition of the text .
The authorities were informed of the discovery of the entrance .
His blood became calm , and returned to its accustomed circulation .
Our peculiar journey had no chance of being diversified by landscape and scenery .
`` A useless observation , '' said <NAME> .
No one , I tell you , no one .
`` Let us find my father ! ''
Will not the <NAME> again pass through the zenith of <NAME> ?

Here was a chance for the caricaturists !
said the <NAME> <NAME> .
It is now the ninth of the month of August .
<NAME> all the lower part of <NAME> in a ferment ?
said <NAME> , in a serious voice ; `` let us prepare .
“ That simply proves that the basis of the document is a number .
They resolved to set off without delay .
“ These , ” he said , “ are the advantages I ask .
`` Well , he did so before , for that matter . ''
Still , at long intervals , <NAME> would see the creature hovering above <NAME> .
“ Can you doubt it ? ” “ I—doubt it !
A journey worthy of the nephew of <NAME> .
Through the glasses objects appeared to be only four miles distant .

There ’ s no fear of losing our way .
Such as it was , it served us admirably .
Mounts <NAME> and <NAME> formed two separate groups very near the south pole .
`` This man seemed certain of the situation of his ship . ''
He was in the saloon , which I must cross to fly .
Yes , '' answered <NAME> , `` it is superb !

<NAME> <NAME> left the car , and the <NAME> followed him upon the platform .
Let him try , if he likes !
The next , the ocean had returned to its accustomed aspect .
Several blows were then interchanged , but nothing decisive was done .
For two days plains of low scrub succeeded each other without interruption .
They would shatter us like glass if we got entangled between them .
`` I do n't deny that fact , Mr .
After a short interval a shock was felt .
Had the animals discovered that they were about to be attacked from another direction ?
Now and then reminiscences of our lower world would flit across their brains .
It 's clear that you do n't know how large the sum is . ''
<NAME> and <NAME> made their appearance .
<NAME> <NAME> , second mate ; 4 .
The hermit crossed himself ; <NAME> became almost inanimate .
“ No , <NAME> , ” answered the young miner .
It is impossible to say how much they were moved !
In the middle of the commotion another loud cry was suddenly heard .
on horseback , and only a hundred paces in advance of his enemies !
Five seconds later the shell burst outside .
The attention of the <NAME> government shall be called to the matter .
Their language is difficult to learn , and their mode of pronouncing it extraordinary .
I had got the clue .
`` Not a doubt of it . ''
Such conditions may only occur once in twenty or fifty years ! ''
It seems to me that they have need of reforming a little ! ''
At that price they had a right to enjoy themselves a little .
<NAME> called <NAME> , who ran up hastily .
They never betrayed a wag of pleasure nor a snarl of wrath .
He was said to be very rich in gold and slaves .
It was translated into <NAME> by <NAME> .
The cries of `` To Virgamen !
Two ships , the <NAME> and the <NAME> , were placed under his command .
His throat and gums were lacerated and bleeding .
Surface of the Earth : 197,000,000 square miles .
<NAME> fancied he had made out their religion .
But on this day it was exchanged for another phrase not less incomprehensible .
This idea set <NAME> off again .
This man advised him to dismiss his <NAME> attendants and to personate a pilgrim .
Two men only knew the cipher -- the culprit and Torres !
“ And can we deliver our friend ? ” he added .
murmured <NAME> in my ear .
observed the <NAME> , now quite convinced .
`` There , it is wound up for a century ! ''
As to the receiver and manipulator , they were very simple .
`` Really , monsieur , you are very kind . ''
It traveled at a speed of one hundred and sixty miles in the hour .
“ I have an idea , <NAME> , ” said <NAME> .
“ What a man ! ” said <NAME> .
<NAME> made no reply , but went and fetched the document .
Just then a bright flash lit up the sky ; a loud clap followed .
`` All this is an evasion , '' cried <NAME> .
`` 'It is the groaning of the waves ! '
The topic of discourse was , naturally , the aerial voyage .
an idea occurs to me , <NAME> , ” replied <NAME> .
<NAME> and <NAME> were worn out with the fatigues of a ten-mile walk .
“ Here ’ s a go ! ” said he , looking at <NAME> .
It rounded into an open bay , with roadstead enclosed by the two promontories .
“ Yes , my Lord , ” replied the quartermaster .
He appeared exhausted with fatigue .
From this point it took an easterly direction towards the jagged <NAME> .
Their illusion was of short duration .
When , therefore , he found himself in S. lat .
`` Would you like to carry away more than the remembrance ? ''
No proof had been produced ; justice must take its course .
Then <NAME> added , `` We are now quits , Hatteras ! ''
“ As they will , ” replied <NAME> .
“ What is wrong ? ” inquired <NAME> .
My uncle and the guide moved as men in a dream .
It literally tore through the water .
[ Illustration ] `` Still , we are farther north , '' said <NAME> .
<NAME> justice , however , was paid to <NAME> .
Too-Wit , escorted by a hundred warriors , came out to meet the visitors .

`` In the proportion of one-third , <NAME> .
I made the time pass pleasantly by interesting studies .
( <NAME> is in N. lat .
<NAME> and <NAME> , by a similar movement , quickly drew their weapons .
He fought for a long time , and died only after receiving many bullets .
No sooner was anchor cast than fifteen or more pirogues surrounded the vessel .
`` Have you noticed , <NAME> , how deeply sunk his eyes are ? ''
One would say it was the noise of the sea . '
Where was <NAME> at that moment ?
The position of the projectile with regard to the sun did not change .
`` As I am in the habit of doing . ''
The cottage was a very quiet one .
exclaimed <NAME> curtly ; `` how to get back is indefinitely postponed !
But the change was intelligible .
They respect , above all things , coolness and courage .
Therefore there was no answer to be made .
Its mean depth is 1,500 fathoms , its mean breadth ten miles .
It appeared that <NAME> was to be attacked on the north side .
The matter promised to be curious .
I closed the book and returned to my walk .
`` But it is not nearly as good as <NAME> . ''
The latter , in spite of his imperturbability , grew pale .
A few hours sufficed to explore the whole domain of <NAME> .
The waters had suddenly broken through by an enormous fissure into the mine beneath .
It appeared to have exhausted itself .
It is situated between 13 degrees 15 minutes S. lat .
We then travelled over a plain of seaweed of wild and luxuriant vegetation .
His name was Kara-Tete , meaning “ the irascible ” in the native tongue .
They ceased to be master and servant , in order to become bosom friends .
“ Forty-six minutes ! ” announced the lieutenant .
I can not express my astonishment at the beauties of these new regions .
The projectile was to reach the moon when full on the 5th at midnight .
292 Native hut in <NAME> .
After the barrenness of the desert , vegetation was now resuming its empire .
He gazed , a prey to violent excitement .
<NAME> went to her accustomed bench , and kneeled with profound and simple reverence .
The first moments were given up to the happiness inspired by the safe return .
Truly , they came to our succour .
The secretary of the <NAME> was a remarkable calculator .
“ That peculiar point astonishes you , does it ? ” said <NAME> .
After leaving <NAME> 's <NAME> , the route was westward .
another person is responsible for your act . ''
This thought haunted him , and he never ceased cursing his miserable folly .
In intelligence the natives of <NAME> are clearly far superior to those of <NAME> .
Meanwhile , this disposition of all minds produced other curious effects worthy of note .
`` Nobody knows , <NAME> , '' was <NAME> 's reply .
With the crackling of the fire was mingled the yells of the <NAME> .
It was the sun of this cave , and it filled it entirely .
cried I , in a rage .
Anything more suggestive of gloom and of regions of nether darkness I never beheld .
The latter was awake in a moment .
“ <NAME> , barrels , which perhaps are full , ” replied the sailor .
And yet this was only the work of nature .
Imperturbable as usual , <NAME> replied coldly to the deference paid to him .
<NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , greatly astonished , let him proceed .
<NAME> made for <NAME> , which lay on the west .
Acknowledge that we owe our traveling companion a good turn .
I jumped into the sea , and attempted to make my way toward it .
The _dejeuner_ over , there still remained three hours of daylight .
No toasts were offered , no hurrahs were uttered .
My uncle , however , paid without bargaining .
Matters had a serious look .
To take them , they had glasses ; to correct them , maps .
who could tell what the future might have in reserve ?
Let me act for you , Mr .
Then a singular change took place in the demeanour of <NAME> Len Guy .
“ Silence ! ” replied <NAME> , with his finger on his lips .
I called the attention of <NAME> Len Guy and <NAME> to this point .
`` <NAME> said on the subject ! ''
Just then a terrific roaring noise was heard .
It was now seen how advantageous the engineer ’ s arrangements had been .
His companions uttered a shout .
There perfumes of the most varied kinds mingled together in tropical profusion .
The fires of the outposts burned brightly .
In consequence of the storm , we had been thrown eastward once more .
This manoeuvre did not escape the <NAME> .
Telegrams were sent to <NAME> and <NAME> for news of <NAME> .
<NAME> was the most southerly point visited by <NAME> , during this journey .
They descended <NAME> to its mouth .
<NAME> <NAME> seemed to be stupefied by the revelation .
My hair stood on end , my teeth chattered , my limbs trembled .
`` _r_ is the radius of the <NAME> . ''
He neither knew , nor cared to know , their names .
A mathematician should not want breathing time !
<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> reached the coast , which was entirely deserted .
`` Because that equality has only been determined by terrestrial attraction .
A man has proposed such a method to me . ''
It is actually at 73 degrees .
What do you think of that lofty comparison , hey ? ''
And the captain wanted to win them by kindness !
I ask it to be put differently . ''
The supply of powder and shot is also most important . ''
And he would not go beyond them .
do I not hear the whistling of the wind ?
Our weapons had wholly vanished .
“ And I have mine , ” replied <NAME> .
I go where duty orders me to go .
Take this carpet-bag , '' handing it to <NAME> .
It being impossible to decide this , <NAME> became greatly perplexed .
The contempt of the Russians for these barbarians was boundless .
How vain must such puny efforts prove !
The first vessel was destroyed almost immediately .
They had plenty of rugs which make good beds .

For several hours he roamed round the nearly-deserted square , surveying the apparatus .
What mechanism could be so adjusted as to inspire us with thought ? ''
I was , I admit , little prepared for this communication .
O , I 'm sure I do n't know ! ''
The storm now raged with redoubled fury .
The view they thus obtained was extensive .
All telescopes were instantly turned in the direction indicated .
These events all belong frankly to the realm of fairyland .
Judge for yourselves whether we can stop for a moment ! ''
`` Then , '' said the <NAME> , `` I ca n't guess . ''
The explorers could not discover one suspicious trace .
You only have taught me what happiness is .
<NAME> native cloth had been the sole medium of exchange .
“ I will find it , ” answered <NAME> .
The band had gone more than two hundred miles from <NAME> Bay to <NAME> .
“ We have no questions to put to you , ” said <NAME> .
Hitherto the settlers had nothing to complain of .
The ill-treatment inflicted on <NAME> was now redoubled .
Neither caresses nor threats could make him be silent .
But this was another question that could not be answered at present .
`` Your pity leads you astray , captain , '' I replied .
to each square two-fifths of an inch of its surface .
<NAME> <NAME> had herein preceded the <NAME> government .
They are excellent marksmen , and passionately fond of hunting .
This sentence ruined his master .
“ Nor I ! ” answered <NAME> seriously .
The congelation gains on us on all sides . ''
It should be said that he showed himself much impressed toward <NAME> .
A naturalist , named <NAME> , was associated with him .
But that which served as steps under our feet became in other places stalactites .
Here began the irregular coast , covered with lines of rocks and sandbanks .
At every hundred paces they were obliged to stop to take breath .
<NAME> was received by the <NAME> of <NAME> .
that was disaster , devastation , ruin .
`` Come , come , <NAME> , '' said I , `` you exaggerate !
All these events passed before my eyes like scenes in a drama .
We have nothing to fear .
`` The island is quite comfortable where it is ! ''
`` And what answer did <NAME> make ? ''
Soon I discovered by a hissing noise that the water was entering the reservoirs .
Millions of luminous spots shone brightly in the midst of the darkness .
They had erected prodigies of architecture , and they carved statues with amazing art .
The reception which awaited him in <NAME> was at first extremely cold .
The ship might double the island during the night .
prayed <NAME> , the others joining him with folded hands and bowed heads .
The faithful animal had voluntarily leaped out to help his master .
They discovered it one day when the queen dined on board .
The second ditch was at least eighty feet in depth .
<NAME> <NAME> began to scratch his head .
The flashes gradually became brighter and more rapid .
The town of <NAME> stands in a plain surrounded by lofty mountains .
and exhausted myself in vain attempts to turn in my granite bed .
What had happened was very simple .
There was no doubt whatever that Hunt really was <NAME> .
“ Who am I , thou askest !
Is it not far more probable that they all perished in the earthquake ? ''
He is turning toward us , '' answered <NAME> .
Then , without uttering a single word , he returned towards the beach .
The living or the dead ?
It might have been an island on terra firma .
If you want spectacles , here are mine ! ''
We advanced regardless of everything , drawn on by ardent curiosity .
It was only with great difficulty that the <NAME> entered <NAME> harbour .
They must be patient and wait .

“ Stupid idea that I had !
`` We 've still thirteen minutes and a half . ''
As they were shutting the door : “ And <NAME> ? ” said <NAME> .
Nevertheless I was determined to have an explanation with <NAME> about his detestable conduct .
it is an intelligent boat ! ''
Was not this an encouragement given to assassination ?
He alone replaced his son in the command of the brig .
The raft passed unperceived in the midst of these floating masses .
But no voice replied to <NAME> , who in vain repeated his vigorous shouts .
Here we are at the cottage .
If the survivors were many , they would all starve to death .
Had the ingenuity of the constructors of the projectile obtained any happy result ?
And from a danger too the most unlikely and the most unexpected .
<NAME> and <NAME> could not help laughing at their companion 's uneasiness .
`` And then , <NAME> , thou wilt be happy with him .
The pickaxe is everywhere at work ; the spade nowhere .
There was no occasion for any warning .
The quarter of an hour had elapsed , and <NAME> had found nothing .

There were few or no bridges or tunnels on the route .

The following is his description of this city , where the <NAME> rule begins .
He had consequently no difficulty .
On the contrary , they were talking , singing , laughing .
`` We attempted to win them over by small presents .
<NAME> to understand what he meant , I turned to obey his commands .
“ Shall we descend ? ” said <NAME> .
They were in 16 degrees S. Lat .
34 `` One of them tore the carrion with his teeth '' .
“ I am not alone ! ” said <NAME> at last .
But <NAME> drew very different conclusions from this absence .
The dry heat became severe .
He was a gentle animal , though very powerful and wonderfully active .
It was evident that he was quite close to the north-western extremity of <NAME> .
`` Who 's talking about the captain ? ''
An electric shudder of glad surprise shot through the assembled crowd .
Some of these springs were very hot .
He was the soul of it .
You may count on me . ''
The professor , however , had ascertained all that he wanted to know .
<NAME> ascribed this condition to the terrible perils he had gone through .
The king received Laing with special marks of esteem .
This was the scene of the battle of the 22nd of October , 1702 .
We now received a rather startling surprise .

<NAME> of <NAME> is the <NAME> country , called <NAME> by the Mahommedans .
At this moment <NAME> had other thoughts .
“ We ’ ll not fall , ” was his invariable reply .
`` It 's too much honor for me , '' answered <NAME> .
replied the former , in excellent <NAME> .
There was a moment 's silence .
Meantime the mission despatched by the <NAME> to <NAME> proceeded with analogous operations .
On the 7th March the <NAME> anchored in <NAME> Bay .
They never thought of such a thing .
This time there was no mistake !
By noon , the <NAME> had advanced only a few miles .
He did so in a book printed at <NAME> and called <NAME> introductio_ .
It was , in reality , a conglomeration of smaller clouds .
You do n't doubt this meeting ? ''
<NAME> <NAME> was under our feet !
Meanwhile , the last torch had flickered out .
The terrified boatmen uttered exclamations of despair and dropped their poles .
Already there was a slight movement among the men of the detachment .
We had quitted the <NAME> about an hour and a half .
asked the <NAME> , with peculiar emphasis .
But where will he touch ?
He was of iron—like his fore-arm !
Silently corrected typographical errors and variations in spelling .
The wind blew from the east , sometimes with the violence of a tempest .
It was the same with <NAME> .
34 degrees 16 minutes 45 seconds .
`` That is quite clear , captain .
You know more about the Moon than I do !
Do not leave <NAME> .
The bullocks would taste the water and turn back .
Did these flames really assume a human shape , as was asserted ?
“ And why not , captain ? ” rejoined the lieutenant .
[ Illustration : Battle in <NAME> ' Bay . ]
Had the young miner fallen into some crevice ?
The weather was still superb .
Facts , systems , doctrines , were grouped together .
Camps were established with great promptness when the times for repose came .
Many authors identify this group with <NAME> 's Prince of <NAME> .
Yes , that is indeed the hand of <NAME> .
After rather a long silence , the commander resumed the conversation .
<NAME> was summoned and appeared immediately .
`` I will show you an excellent shop for getting what you want . ''
The river was searched in vain ; there was no trace of the boat .
<NAME> made these reflections rapidly .
A loud barking was heard .
From eight to nine o'clock the <NAME> remained some fathoms under the water .
“ They are travelers calling for aid , ” cried <NAME> .
However , <NAME> had gone now to <NAME> .
He possesses several ships which trade up and down the river .
All that her young companion told intensely interested the old <NAME> .
But you could not do anything alone .
To-morrow we will come back here .
`` And who made this discovery ? ''
It was this current that the <NAME> was to follow .
Every one was delighted to make him a present .
The moujik would come out , smiling and extending his hand to his guest .
Then he would disappear and be seen again higher up in the rocks .

From an engraving in the <NAME> des Estampes of the <NAME> .
It was a fragment of the <NAME> !
It was because the projectile then `` weighed '' almost nothing .
The yacht was only a few cables ’ lengths from the sandbanks .
`` What is your opinion on this point , <NAME> ? ''
“ What matters whether it be <NAME> or <NAME> ?
`` Do you understand it at last ? ''
<NAME> tried to go after him .
`` Look out for the ice ! ''
`` <NAME> , <NAME> of the <NAME> . ''
All at once <NAME> exclaimed , “ Well , I declare !
“ Come , be calm , my dear <NAME> ! ” resumed the doctor .
`` We have neither <NAME> bark , nor sulphate of quinine ? ''
I might say the same of our ginger preserves .
She would do what she could .
The jangada , again started on the river , began to drift off diagonally .
`` I do , '' was my desperate reply .
The stranger listened with extreme attention .
The current did not seem to have diminished in speed or changed its course .
Moreover , we could in no case avail ourselves of it .
<NAME> <NAME> looked at me .
`` I saw him with my own eyes . ''
A town of the future ?
The Papuans themselves are positively repulsively ugly .
said <NAME> , `` slightly academical perhaps . ''
Why , hang it , one man is equal to another ! ''
This would take some time .
His sailors were worn out with fatigue , discouraged , and enfeebled by scurvy .
And what did <NAME> think of all this ?
How could Master <NAME> read the hour on this strange creature 's visage ?
`` Well , calm yourself , my Nimrod !
<NAME> was full of activity , a remarkable feature in these towns of yesterday .
But this land was still thirty miles off .

How long the night appeared to the sailor and his companions !

he asked , `` and what do you claim to be to me ? ''
We went around in a circle , and came across our own footprints ! ''
He wanted to judge for himself these emanations _sui generis_ .
It is shut up , and nothing to open it with !
I also noticed large medusae floating between the reeds .
<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> soon made their preparations .
-- '' In the <NAME> is hardly possible ! ''
Such a march was more that of a procession than of an army .
`` A frightful journey , was it not ?
The blacksmith had had the forethought to bring the shoes with him .
`` Let us go towards the sea .
I know you , M. Aronnax .
My uncle was cast headlong upon the deck .
They are constantly at war with the inhabitants of the neighbouring islands .
`` On the contrary , '' continued <NAME> .
After some delay , the Professor spoke .
There are but few <NAME> on the banks of the <NAME> .
How could they stay so long away from the mine without feeling homesick ?
Mrs. <NAME> trembled lest he should become the victim of the general mania .
<NAME> continued to steer between 46 degrees to 47 degrees lat .
Do not be in a hurry to reply by a formal refusal .
It was by no means a slight task .
The sandy bottom was clean and bright .
“ Let us go to it , then , ” said <NAME> .
The latter , after having observed the animal attentively , called the engineer .
The night came on very dark .
My mind was in a state of semioblivion .
The operation lasted forty-eight hours , and succeeded perfectly .
By an effort of his will he had again become master of himself .
<NAME> <NAME> tore it open .
His intercourse with the <NAME> family remained the same .
After all , the island was large and fertile .
Had they burned the ship ?
`` Let us three constitute the republic . ''
The stores were equally secure .
“ <NAME> to me , my friends , ” said the engineer .
`` Anything new , Monsieur the counsellor ? ''
<NAME> would have joined us sooner or later .
This _x_ is the secret of the promoters of this deplorable affair .
I can never tell all the sufferings we endured upon our return .
`` Yes -- and that is why <NAME> changed his name in the narrative .
This time the words were spoken close to my ear .
The doctor joined him on the quarter-deck .
We were prisoners to the iceberg .
<NAME> Vasling could not disguise the pleasure which this decision gave him .
Let me have a chance at them !
[ Illustration : A sail was seen on the horizon . ]
<NAME> <NAME> has proved capable of supplying us with everything we require . ''
But his slumbers were too much disturbed to last long .
Several passengers , shot or stunned , lay on the seats .
The sea still retains its uniform monotony .
On the 20th of July <NAME> was signalled .
Therefore , the vessel had not struck .
<NAME> estimates it at 100,000 .
There is a chance of it .
But an event soon afterwards occurred which awakened his keenest interest .
<NAME> was at last relieved .
That was sensible advice , and was followed out .
The evening repast was composed of fresh meat , pemmican , and hot tea .
The space continued to diminish .
This done , they were ready to proceed on their voyage next day .
From thence he could proceed to <NAME> .
This drew their interested attention to a new phenomenon .
`` Because he 's on board now , '' answered the doctor , simply .
Now , this is the serious proposition which I have to make to you .
“ <NAME> ’ t I know my man ?
“ And what are we to do , then ? ” asked <NAME> .
While I was watching intently , I observed that the tunnel was becoming dark .
In the course of his life , <NAME> had read a few books .
`` By three tombs which the <NAME> expedition found there in 1850 .
We have nothing to do with the whale-oil on board . ''
`` On the 11th , at seven in the evening .
<NAME> in hand , he clearly explained their situation .
`` I advise you not to , '' said <NAME> .
<NAME> was then thirty miles to the leeward .

This little river falls into <NAME> twelve miles above <NAME> .
Would some relation , some friend , await her arrival by the train ?
Afterwards each of us retired to his own house .
`` But what temperature has been reached above the <NAME> ? ''
What was this water , whence did it come ?
Swallowed up in the cavernous cracks , it is said .
Sometimes they catch them with a viscous birdlime that paralyses their movements .
The <NAME> dogs trembled from terror ; <NAME> remained motionless .
The stones were covered with sparse lichen .
<NAME> harder on my arm , <NAME> .
“ <NAME> ho ! ” cried <NAME> .
`` I hope he will refuse , '' exclaimed <NAME> .
Every morning I mounted the platform .
said <NAME> , brightening up , `` physics ! ''
continued the Professor in an anxious tone .
The police who brought the order conducted him without delay beyond the frontier .
He is a thief ! ” <NAME> looked sternly at <NAME> .
No one helped him to inflate his balloon .
And the square itself was hardly large enough to hold the crowd .
The combatants were soon parted .
We came with the _Breadalbane_ to carry supplies to <NAME> . ''
In the canoe was seen the figure of an old man standing upright .

At the same moment the gusts of wind redoubled their violence .
“ They have killed him ! ” he cried .
`` We are really off , then ? ''
None of the fugitives were visible .
`` And if he eats our dogs -- '' said <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> was not mistaken .
<NAME> and fatigue were forgotten in the face of this imperious necessity .
`` It 's very simple ; there is no explanation . ''
<NAME> <NAME> had not left it .
Its position was duly traced on the <NAME> ‘ s chart .
“ And how are you going to capture it ? ” asked the <NAME> .
Under the circumstances , a calm man would have been regarded as a monster .
He put on a pair .
“ We have stuck in the mud , ” replied <NAME> .
Everything is an event at sea .
His hesitation had not lasted half a second .
exclaimed <NAME> ; `` now or never !
<NAME> <NAME> suffered no pain , but he was visibly sinking .
`` Let us go on with our search , then , '' returned <NAME> .
The temperature fell very perceptibly , and no longer rose above twenty-three degrees .
That was difficult to say .
`` You shall give me satisfaction for this ! ''
The doctor wanted to get <NAME> 's opinion ; but <NAME> refused to answer .
What they could bear , they bore without murmuring .
`` That is difficult to explain , '' answered the engineer .
“ What do you want to-day ? ” asked the Jew .
`` Now , there you are again , <NAME> !
His feeling towards his beautiful and brave companion was rather respect than affection .
The origin of the catastrophe was a problem still to be solved .
“ Shall we never see each other again ? ” <NAME> called out .
The engineer obeyed at the risk of bursting the boilers .
The immobility of the blind man froze him .
Map of <NAME> and of the <NAME> of the <NAME> .
There are some cannoneers nearly as noisy as their own guns .
<NAME> this wonderful combat to end in the depths of the ocean ?
But if the fauna was poor , the flora was rich .
In fact , they could distinctly hear the creaking of the windlass .
The sand was heaped up with them .
I repeat , it is not only myself whom it concerns .
Singers and musicians broke away impetuously .
You ought to think yourself lucky in getting any price at all .
Now this substance was wanting on board , and nothing could replace it .
He must cross the steppe and turn to <NAME> .
No other articles or pieces of wreck could be found .
Just now , Mrs. <NAME> 's chamber has no occupant .
The faithful creature , having broken his chain , had followed his master .
The presentiments which had troubled <NAME> did not cease to agitate him also .
The gentleman who uttered the cries was evidently a belated Mormon .
<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> were visited in turn .
But <NAME> wished to remain above .
“ How magnificent ! ” remarked <NAME> , over and over again .
It was impossible to remain on the platform .
`` You might tell it by its thick , short spout .
I wanted to take him with me .
He therefore named the island , which is situated in N. lat .

They came within a hundred yards of them , and stopped .
[ Illustration : `` Only by getting wet up to their waists . '' ]
I was groping my way , when I suddenly saw a brilliant white light .
His countenance showed that he had long and cruelly suffered .
He would never have doubted him .
The ship 's course was then changed so as to reach this exact point .
Without knowing why it was a presentiment , perhaps <NAME> became vaguely uneasy .
My uncle and the <NAME> followed .
Why have the soldiers of the <NAME> invaded the soil of <NAME> ?
“ Do you want me ? ” asked <NAME> , getting up .
On a sudden the cry of `` Land ! ''
The unfortunate word would not come out .
said one ; `` steamers do n't usually carry so much sail . ''
Already their cheeks began to redden .
<NAME> called him in vain .
They risked nothing but their lives in its execution .
`` That is settled , then , '' said <NAME> .
Ten minutes afterward the pirogue arrived at <NAME> .
remarked Mrs. Smith , her countenance lighting up .
I must say , however , that there was neither bread nor wine .
How could they imagine that the Observatory men had committed such a blunder ?
`` And what are you going to do with the ruler , M'Nicholl ! ''
He was destined to die a member of the senate after a sixth metamorphosis .
<NAME> and <NAME> even rushed into the surf whenever any object attracted their attention .
The boat brought us back to the ship .
The eight months of perpetual daylight had begun .
“ And your companions ? ” said Kai-Koumou .
What will <NAME> say ?
Do you follow all this ? ''
have you not seen him ? ” asked <NAME> .
The vessel was within two miles of us .
They were evidently no longer masters of the machine .
`` <NAME> asserts that he is , '' I replied .
The robber meantime was pursued and killed .
Would he ever be a convalescent ?
The doctor , <NAME> , and <NAME> determined to explore the country .
said my uncle , with a smile .
This reached <NAME> 's ears ; he was much incensed , and reproached <NAME> .
Two of the dogs were dead .
`` He 's the cause of everything , '' they all exclaimed excitedly .
No man ever set foot in this sanctuary unless in the cowl of <NAME> .
It is a very extensive country , but miserable beyond expression .
He descended to the saloon .
“ Or a spy , ” replied the other , lowering his voice .
According to them it tastes like pork , with even more flavor .
Then , a feeling of vengeance to be accomplished came over him .
<NAME> did not know what to say .
The truth was that nobody had penetrated that reserved nature .
Then there came the important question of provisions .
We all returned to the saloon .
What could he say to the lad ?
On learning what was going on , <NAME> could not contain his joy .
Why do you think so ? ''
`` Had geographers merely guessed in making the <NAME> del <NAME> identical with <NAME> ?
<NAME> <NAME> and his companions could not understand it .
My mind was made up .
“ And yet we were mistaken , ” resumed the Major .
What palette is rich enough in colors to reproduce so magnificent a spectacle ?
No words can convey the slightest idea of the terrific sound !
It was a paper signed by the shipowners and <NAME> .
Had he changed his mind about `` his man '' ?
He spoke more like a negro belonging to a <NAME> colony .
The Major and the two sailors were some feet in advance .
At last Captain <NAME> recovered himself .
To complete the roll of passengers , we must name <NAME> .
You seize sentiment better when you get clear of nature .
There was no time to send messengers to the <NAME> to arrest <NAME> .
On the 24th August he re-entered <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> intersected these plains , and lost themselves among the tall grasses .
Did he see that the attempt had failed ?
The weather had become very fine .
This was explained the same evening .
replied the sailor , `` but that is not the question .
The natives are ugly , stunted , but well proportioned .
<NAME> did not hear him , but disappeared .
`` <NAME> , do n't let such sadness fill your heart .
`` Or , more correctly speaking , on our gigantic narwhal . ''
<NAME> left him no time to do so .
`` But I never see your master on deck . ''
It was a difficult and often perilous task .
Two or three planks only were wrenched away by the collision .
Suddenly a hissing noise was heard , and the dugong disappeared .
“ What you say is true , my boy , ” replied the sailor .
In 1857 the great sepoy revolt broke out .
Their progress was silent , and every one beat the ice with his staff .
I found this out about supper time .
At two thousand pounds the <NAME> yielded .
But all that could only be for a time .
They could not confide any detail of the life in common to their enemies .
After a great lapse of time , the rapidity of our journey increased .
he murmured ; `` I am dying ! ''
Dr. <NAME> , rising , declares the man to be dead .
The engineer was not mistaken .
`` Yes , it has been written about seriously .
But these charts are not sufficiently authentic .
He was succeeded in the command of the _Espérance_ by M. D'Hesminy d'Auribeau .

[ Illustration : <NAME> of a morai in <NAME> . ]
<NAME> cetacea with blows of a spur !
They had before them some days ’ respite .
answered the doctor , stooping down to escape being blown away .
The colonists ' uneasiness was great .
<NAME> <NAME> slept heavily , like an honest soldier overcome with fatigue .
<NAME> thus became the life of the cottage .
“ There , gentlemen , one hundred and thirty-three grammes !
`` But these parts had to be put together and arranged ? ''
`` Voyages du <NAME> de Champlain , '' p. 44 .
I could see that even my uncle had ventured too far .
They became seriously uneasy at this prolonged absence .
A revelation dawned on <NAME> 's mind .
What horror and stupefaction took possession of my soul .
And the hearts of all were animated by returning hope .
The captain was struck and fell to the earth .
The <NAME> family might well call itself the `` <NAME> family . ''
Ten minutes after they entered the <NAME> .
<NAME> became very anxious that their marriage should take place .

But a stiff breeze rising again , we steered quarter S.W .
I had had time to recover .
He then took up his station near the window and gazed through the foliage .
<NAME> was comparing his charts with the coast-line .
The whole day passed without my being honoured by a visit from <NAME> .
I must say she has arrived very opportunely . ''
The end of the expedition was attained .
It was afterwards colonized by a part of the mutineers of the <NAME> .
In 1864 another guide met his death there .
“ What ’ s the matter , my boy ? ” asked <NAME> .
Servants even of the female sex were not allowed to accompany their mistresses .

The <NAME> of <NAME> and <NAME> in the <NAME> VII .
Of course , I understand all about it ! ''
We were skirting the enormous base of the mighty volcano .

“ Hundred cents ! ” said the <NAME> .
`` Do be serious , '' said <NAME> .
`` I will freight it for you . ''
On the 20th of November the bridge was finished .
A ray glanced on the table placed near the bed .
Telescopes in hand , the explorers from the summit scanned the surrounding view .
<NAME> remains just as usual .
In the humble cottage which served for the village church ?
“ No , captain , ” replied the sailor .
An invincible dread had taken possession of my brain and soul .
We had no need to hurry , however .
These fresh provisions and the replenished fire raised the spirits of the weakest .
I must learn how the eruption is progressing . ''
And yet the present dangers are nothing compared to those she must undergo .
It is an elongated cylinder with conical ends .
We have certainly not enough water to last us five days . ''
But there was nothing to be seen on any side , absolutely nothing .
`` I know , it is true , your love for this island .
In the expectation of the next day they could not but feel some emotion .
`` Bring them forward then , sir , as many as you please . ''
But no advantage of this kind could compensate for the remoteness of the sun .
<NAME> barked angrily at these new enemies .
`` Because my name is <NAME> , or <NAME> . ''
He simply pointed to the instrument .
Three only of the recruits joined those faithful seamen ; these were <NAME> sailors .
All the gunners were assembled .
<NAME> took the lighted lantern , and all left the corral .
<NAME> cries now assailed his ears ; it was <NAME> 's voice .
roared <NAME> , suddenly striking his forehead .
At a height of three thousand five hundred yards we remained stationary .

<NAME> fully realized that either alternative involved the complete failure of their enterprise .
`` I am impatient to learn . ''
We must at least have a friendly glass on board the <NAME> . ''
Navigation in the <NAME> required a ship of special strength and excellence .
Glasses were used with feverish activity .
The colonists hastened to the dockyard .
<NAME> returned to the spot where <NAME> was waiting for him .
The counsellor followed a few steps behind .
However , it was impossible that this state of things could last .
replied an individual perched on the poop .
In this wild way I addressed my uncle .
<NAME> guessed that he meant <NAME> , whose disappearance had troubled the whole world .
Does that mean the <NAME> town on the banks of <NAME> ?
The indignant reply of an honest man .
I rushed towards the platform .
This was , as I soon found out , futile .
Several whitish ropes about five or six feet long were brought on board .
The <NAME> is still sunk in the soil of <NAME> .
With great precision and much labour <NAME> carried on the driving of his tunnel .
It would have seemed to them quite insufficient to carry them to the end .
`` Not that I know of , '' said the Professor , puzzled .
<NAME> this information of a kind to modify <NAME> ’ s position ?

No smoke curling in the air betrayed the presence of man .
The <NAME> may possibly appear above the waters as islands .
These poor creatures appeared quite resigned to their destiny .
“ You have seen how ready I am to obey you .
But where will he touch ?
Passing onwards he discovered another country , which the <NAME> called _the burnt people_ .
The appearance of the town is very pleasant .
The account is amusing , but are all its details accurate ?
He was particularly careful of the poor who lived in <NAME> .
It was all built with great solidity ; what more was to be desired ?
“ Yes , to <NAME> , ” answered <NAME> .
to a cape they named <NAME> , after the governor of their company .
asked the engineer , turning to the sailor and <NAME> .
Upon the eastern coast a pretty bay was perceived , which promised good anchorage .
the vein is there ! ” THE old overman ’ s experiment had succeeded .
he exclaimed ; `` one word only -- am I free ? ''
A family watch , monsieur , which has come down from my great-grandfather !
`` Let us go on a journey of discovery , '' I cried .
The rocks were splintered , and cheers accompanied each discharge .
“ It is time to say that <NAME> was a traitor .
He therefore resolved to try and rehabilitate himself .
There was nothing before me but poverty .
`` <NAME> , are you awake ? ''
During these few seconds then would come the moment for striking the decisive blow .
Both father and daughter showed the greatest kindness and good will .
Thus far , then , <NAME> ’ s journey had been accomplished satisfactorily .
On the whole , time passed indifferently well .
He raised his hand above his head ; the roof was perceptibly sinking .
<NAME> , <NAME> , thou pearl-faced goddess of night beloved of <NAME> !
<NAME> took the lead , and tried the ground with his feet .
`` Provided , of course , that there are Selenites in existence ! ''
The settlers soon became habituated to the use of this ladder .
Yet , what monsters these poulps are !
“ What a monster ! ” cried <NAME> .
It is situated in 128 degrees E. long .
Now we ’ ll take <NAME> first ; where are we at this moment ?
We made ten steps and then stopped , finding it absolutely impossible to proceed .
A steady breeze from the northwest .
“ Well , we will make matches .
<NAME> must be suspended for the present .
<NAME> ’ t her velocity all altered ? ” demanded the captain .
He did this towards the middle of April .
It was `` <NAME> felt , '' and <NAME> possessed yet another manufacture .
`` Well done for an Englishman ! ''
What if the chains should break under its enormous weight ?
The engineer ’ s advice was good .
I tried to look around me .
<NAME> this a time to seek refuge there ?
Four days later <NAME> reached the <NAME> archipelago once more .
He did not do so .
`` You must have mistaken the path , '' said the doctor .
<NAME> was some distance ahead .
Thus the enterprise of these generous Scots had failed !
Every place within this zone has the <NAME> in the zenith twice a year .
“ But we must see our way .
`` It was once , '' said <NAME> , in a low tone .
We are not strong enough to fight successfully . ''
“ Calm yourself , <NAME> ! ” he said .
`` <NAME> , '' was the reply .
cried the sailors , evidently exceedingly terrified .
<NAME> was witness when there of the Feast of the <NAME> .
And here the schooner began to feel in earnest the breezes of the <NAME> .
None the less , his descriptions should be received with great caution .
Where could they commence a fresh quest ?
No one has ever gone any farther . ''
It is mere undulating molecular motion , nothing more .
Soon a slight rolling told me that we were in the open air .
The <NAME> flag ? -- but that is tri-color .
In truth the sides were not well matched .
So <NAME> , compass in hand , gazed steadily at the north .
`` O , it does n't make much difference what one wears ! ''
This question occupied <NAME> 's mind .
<NAME> ! ” yelled the excited astronomer .
The workshop at the <NAME> would in that case not have escaped destruction .
`` You are going to put to sea ? ''
The couroucous were waiting the passage of insects which served for their nourishment .
His calmness put me out of countenance , and I had nothing to reply .
“ What will become of the <NAME> ? ” asked <NAME> .
The 1st of <NAME> was one of the gloomiest of these winter days .
We were frozen , actually shivered with terror .
Five or six of the <NAME> sailors did , however , murmur a little .
In the midst of his perplexities , a shock was felt .
This was the barrier to be crossed by <NAME> before he could enter <NAME> .
asked both rapidly in the same breath .
The ice , thrown high in the air , fell like hail around us .
<NAME> <NAME> 's name was once more at a premium on 'Change .
responded <NAME> , like a plaintive echo .
All showed a desire to possess red feathers , which were of considerable value .
`` O , when I think I have already forgotten how gin tastes ! ''
The very thought was stupendous .
Sometimes he thought of <NAME> , but no longer in anger .
O Astarte , thou favorite deity of the <NAME> hills !
H. D. Ruhmkorff , an able and learned chemist , discovered the induction coil .
<NAME> struck too slowly to keep pace with my impatience .
For all this , however , <NAME> brought <NAME> safely to the brig .
Do you come by tube or by air-train ? ''
After this , luxurious dinners became quite the rage at <NAME> .
He was convinced that our enterprise would in the end be successful .
A feeling of curiosity had doubtless attracted them to the anchorage of the raft .
The young birds which fall to the ground are opened on the spot .
It was necessary to regain <NAME> .
No ; it is better for us to wait for them as we agreed .
said <NAME> , still speaking <NAME> .
<NAME> instructions. -- <NAME> , <NAME> .
The sailor instinct rose above the stupefaction of the drunkard and roused <NAME> .
`` Very well , my brave boy .
<NAME> <NAME> set the example , and submitted first to this severe discipline .
[ Illustration : `` See this man , -- he is Time ! '' ]
The journey was accomplished without trouble , and , indeed , without fatigue .
This was only a question of time .
“ You could not face rain like that , <NAME> , ” said <NAME> .
`` Then we have nothing but the Halkett-boat ?
I wanted to set them free on the lunar continent , without saying anything .
Our descent was now resumed by means of the second gallery .
`` At <NAME> , State of <NAME> . ''
But the harbour contained a numerous fleet , and was defended by formidable artillery .
Both ascended , denouncing and raging at each other at every step .
Perhaps he has a life to be renewed .
These wandering bodies carry in themselves the principle of their incandescence .
I could not make it out .
<NAME> , my daughter , how these hands advance with certain step .
They lamented the deceased with a plaintive rhythm and doleful cadence .
She stepped lightly forward , and easily kept pace with <NAME> .
What happened in that year 1000 it may be interesting to recall .
We are going to realize the fable of the giants .
The `` good lady '' remembered having seen Kotzebue ten years before .
At <NAME> , <NAME> and Co. At <NAME> , The <NAME> .
At last he was obliged to stop short .
But with a raft allowance must be made .
[ Illustration : `` The mountain was in full eruption . '' ]
It was of the dreariest description .
hurrah ! ” shouted <NAME> , with wild exultation .
A few scattered plantations were perceived in the centre of the island .
There was nothing for him but flight !
all hope must not be abandoned .
`` Well , why should there be any more ? ''
“ You do not remember me , gentlemen ? ” he asked .
I joined them immediately , followed by the boatswain .
“ No , my Lord ! ” exclaimed <NAME> .
It was important to insist on the remarkable mathematical powers of J. T. <NAME> .
The hours thus passed away .
said she , `` you have made too much fire .
This work finished , every moment was devoted to finishing the schooner .
Possibly no other vessel could furnish an example of such continued effort . ''
`` Yes , Dr. Clawbonny , '' answered the boatswain .
It would overtop the <NAME> of <NAME> , and even the <NAME> of <NAME> .
I cried , more bewildered than ever .
But at sunrise they brailed their sails and were seen no more .
On the 15th of March we were in the latitude of <NAME> and <NAME> .
Another semi-Asiatic semi-European country was also now becoming known .
A never ending <NAME> and <NAME> .
`` The whole crew does not despair , surely ? ''
how are you getting on -- pretty well ?
`` More than that , I am now confident of ultimate success . ''
However , in all other handicrafts , <NAME> yields to <NAME> . ''
No , indeed ; we have only just begun .
Therefore there must be both water and air on the <NAME> 's surface .
Besides , I have full confidence in the aid of <NAME> .
He preferred keeping quiet to discussing this terrible possibility .
<NAME> , even <NAME> fraternizes with the charming beasts !
Some new combination had probably struck him while taking his walk .
`` A simple halt , '' replied my uncle .
nice little comet ! ” muttered <NAME> .
Thus we drift on the sea without hindrance !
“ No , your Lordship , ” was the reply .
Without making any reply , I rose .
The orang replied by a little grunt which did not show any anger .
`` Yes , but it 's on the other side of the river . ''
Did he designedly conceal some incident of his captivity ?
I must know how he became master of the secret .
And from whence could such an opportunity come ?
May God requite you , and bring you to your safe harbor !
All entered a magnificent tent erected on the center of the first terrace .
<NAME> 's plan appeared to him the simplest in the world .
The banks of the river abound in tamarind-trees and provide pasturage for cattle . ''
If he had only come back before <NAME> had left !
<NAME> had ever appeared so touching to him .
`` I want to ask you a very serious question .
“ Travels form the youthful mind .
The thermometer then stood at 7° outside .
On the 30th of June the brig cast anchor in that port .
Could <NAME> have announced to the world such a startling piece of intelligence ?
<NAME> , the lead was greased and lowered .
But how to account for the _grooves_ ?
The whole crew worked at this task for nearly twenty hours .
<NAME> ’ s life before everything. ” This was the colonists ’ saddest thought .
The same trouble attends the alleged disappearance of the water .
The colonists walked rapidly and in silence .
Supplies of wood and coal were also carted .
`` This is exactly the magnetic pole of the earth ! ''
“ But you have finished ! ” exclaimed <NAME> .
Perhaps this incident was connected with that of the bullet ?
That remained to be seen .
`` The day after tomorrow , at daybreak . ''
You will reach it April 20 .
There was a moment of fear .
`` Yes , very good things indeed are dollars ! ''
On the 8th of December , the coast of <NAME> was at last visible .
The <NAME> sailed along this coast for the distance of half a mile .
<NAME> had completely changed his countenance .
`` No man was ever nearer death , '' answered the captain , simply .
`` I have been looking for him for the last two hours in vain .
If <NAME> is still living , he is living on the <NAME> shores . '
The sea supplied abundance of salmon , trout , cod , and plaice .
The natives followed us to the door , but dared not pass the threshold .
`` Tell me again that you hope , Mr <NAME> , '' said <NAME> .
The importance of this calculation it is easy to see .
`` What made you bring with you so useless a weapon ? ''
When I finished , he said not a word .
The log indicated moderate speed , the manometer a depth of about sixty feet .
There <NAME> was barking near a body wrapped up in the <NAME> flag .
“ Come , <NAME> ! ” cried <NAME> , ready to jump overboard .
And <NAME> did not hesitate to pronounce upon it .
What was his bustling , honest , good-natured , impetuous heart at now ?
In a few moments the confusion was at its height .
Did he examine to see if there were any practicable outlet from his prison ?
I had not breathed a word on the subject to anyone .
The reporter lifted his gun to his shoulder and covered the door .
`` Here is the key of the clock , '' replied the horrible man .
And then you talk of the distance which separates the planets from the sun !
The awful combatants held each other in a tight embrace .
It was a monstrous bear .
A young man was leading it , with a dog beside him .
But how were we to reach it ?
We were ascending with extraordinary rapidity .
In the meantime the young men could do nothing .
The settlers certainly had reason to be pretty tired .
this was what I feared , and there was no remedy on that side .
For the present it was stationary , having apparently reached its height .
`` Will master tell me what this means ? ''
<NAME> and sheep had been largely imported .
A few strokes of the oars and the boatswain had rejoined the schooner .
“ How do you feel to-day ? ” asked the doctor .
Let us go to bed . ''
The feet were agitated by increasing frenzy .
<NAME> over , Dr. <NAME> wished to depart .
There was no change in its apparent path .
the voice that they so longed to hear , was far away .
By degrees we fell into regular ways and habits of life .
The selenite city , whether imaginary or not , had already disappeared afar off .
A few minutes after they were re-conducted to Ware-Atoua , which was their prison .
Our friends will want something when they come back .
It was not only life , but honor that he was about to lose .
Well , I will go alone to <NAME> ” “ No , no !
This epoch was by no means favourable to great maritime expeditions .
`` But that happened to the <NAME> , and not far from here .
That <NAME> was a great genius .
The partitions were nearing the upright .
I felt sure that <NAME> would not refuse to take me to the islands .
Their situation began to make them uneasy .
`` Yes , will you agree to take me to Yokohama ? ''
A cry from <NAME> recalled him to himself .
“ Do you hear ? ” said <NAME> .
It sank each moment more and more , till it seemed half under water .
It was but a series of days of joy .
Many of the officers were assaulted and robbed with the greatest effrontery .
When he opened them again , `` I love you ! ''
`` It was then a true palace ? ''

With little he could go far .
`` I have noticed the same fact . ''

The sick man was able to call his friends with a stronger voice .
He found that the mercury had scarcely undergone any perceptible depression .
Here the specific meridian is left out , which is not very informative .
These two were <NAME> and his son .
It was no easy job .
A whole quarter of an hour elapsed in painful expectation .
“ Plenty of air and water there , sir ? ” inquired the orderly .
It was then eight o ’ clock in the morning .
Without it no observations were possible .
“ Yes , if they had any interest in doing so. ” “ What !
Have you not enough to trouble you otherwise ?
It was narrow , rough , and therefore the more easily climbed .
The first care of <NAME> was to hide himself in a dense thicket .
The hours thus passed away .

I 'm getting decidedly too learned !
He carried with him letters of introduction to the chief persons in <NAME> .
`` They would be useless , '' he replied .
Did n't I rescue you from certain death with these two hands ?
Besides , do not trouble yourself about what I do . ''
But no shot could stay their course .
A few instants alone separate us from an eventful moment .
Millions of hurrahs hailed her appearance .
Meanwhile , the affairs of <NAME> had taken a bad turn in <NAME> .

Better delay half-a-day than not arrive safely .
And in this way a whole hour passed .
He introduced the quartermaster to him as a man worthy of all confidence .

Tempests and storms accompanied him to the shores of his own country .
Their thanks rose unanimously to <NAME> .
A few minutes longer , and the whole pack would be in the inclosure .

In 1809 Hedenstroem received instructions to make a map of this new discovery .
It seemed as if he were acting for someone else rather than himself .
`` Yes , land , '' answered the half-breed .
A few days only were left for him to live .
But how had these two men managed to disappear without leaving a trace ?
“ Say away , <NAME> , ” replied <NAME> .
He made land precisely at the boundary between the <NAME> and <NAME> .
<NAME> and hunger made me incapable of reasoning .

`` You wo n't find it so easy to cross the Polar Circle . ''
The contrast to the ordinary aspect of polar seas was very remarkable .
<NAME> looked at her father in terror .
He would not answer me , but once more gave the signal for departure .
“ Speak to me of her , <NAME> , ” said <NAME> .
The one looked back , the other forward .
<NAME> felt his claws entering his flesh .
Throw himself into the sea rather than return northwards ?
`` My name is <NAME> or <NAME> , whichever you choose ! ''
The <NAME> observed that the influence of Kara-Tete gave umbrage to Kai-Koumou .
He began by describing the circumference of the terrestrial spheroid .
`` Admitted , '' replied <NAME> , coldly .
The country rises gradually to the south and south-east in parallel terraces .
The phenomenon was still concentrated in the lower part of the central crater .
I will never forget it ! '
Then <NAME> was born in 1804 .
Such might have been the signal from the masthead of the <NAME> .
I could not help feeling a sense of melancholy come over me .
What is the use of wasting so much valuable time ? ''
With what respect and what confidence the latter received all his decisions !
After which <NAME> quietly continued his dinner .
We must be ready for anything and everything , captain . ''
It was he who concealed you on board ? ''
Who could have believed it possible ? ''
<NAME> had no cause to regret his generous action .

The gate of the corral was opened .
`` And you knew how to make that calculation ? ''
The noise increased , with perceptible violence .

The speed of the <NAME> was accelerated .

They therefore made a good store of the roots .
`` And the <NAME> , making sail , soon disappeared .
<NAME> ; `` but let us go . ''
His efforts , however well meant , were not successful .
`` There is then a means ? ''

This invention had turned the old man 's head .
It seemed that they must inevitably perish .
There were yet forty-eight hours to elapse before we made our final start .
in the midst of the water !
`` It 's delightful , '' thought the doctor .
To lie down and die the most cruel and horrible of deaths !
I stood on the platform and waited .
He believed he could bear removal to <NAME> .
`` Exactly , <NAME> ; we can call practice to the aid of theory .
We slung the lower masts by means of yards forming props .
The frigate might have been called the <NAME> , for a hundred reasons .
`` Nothing is wanting , indeed , '' murmured <NAME> thoughtfully .
Who had dwelt there none knew .
<NAME> <NAME> had given this explanation , which , no doubt , was admissible .
I collected my notes , placing them carefully about me .
On the 20th February the vessels were in S. lat .
Very different was the case with <NAME> .
The reporter prepared to follow him , but <NAME> stopped him .
I prefer seeing them face to face .
In this fearful ambuscade the <NAME> lost ten of her best sailors .
The origin of the ice , therefore , is a matter of no importance .
The distance to <NAME> was not now much over three hundred miles .
If his destiny be strange , it is also sublime .
<NAME> felt that he was lost .
As to the travelers which it enclosed , opinions were divided regarding their fate .
These anniversaries are much frequented , all those assisting at them being liberally regaled .
On Saturday morning the doctor again gave the signal for departure .
I will put the question formally .
The <NAME> soon perceived a little village above the mangroves which bordered the shore .
Had the animals discovered that they were about to be attacked from another direction ?
<NAME> was wrapped in uneasy dreams of the bouncing of the day before .
It was his duty , and he would fulfil it to the end .
An explicable phenomenon , but one which happily served <NAME> 's ends .
Everything accuses you in the proceedings that have already taken place .
I however made no remark .
<NAME> <NAME> betrayed no surprise whatever .
But he was only a secondary chief .
Suddenly his thoughts took another turn .
I thought that at about eight fathoms deep we should find a calm .
Of this phenomenon the present instance was a case in point .
<NAME> , the <NAME> general , had three horses killed under him .
Then he said in a low voice , -- “ Yes !
`` Yes , '' I growled , `` to the end .
He met with no misadventure and found no suspicious traces .
the boatswain said to me just as I was leaving the deck .
Two only of the helmsmen were in a fit condition for duty .
When no shadows are made , none can be measured .
Now , should they seize them with violence and master them by force ?
That evening he drank it so hot that his companions could not imitate him .
On they went , step by step .
It was a moment of palpitating interest , of deep anxiety .
We are conversing by means of some extraordinary acoustic arrangement of the labyrinth .
Under the direction of <NAME> the <NAME> displayed their incomparable ingenuity .
The <NAME> , who had swooned away , at length opened his eyes .
[ Illustration : `` A man 's skull was found . '' ]
“ Well , do you see nothing ? ” asked <NAME> .
Subsequently it displaces this Pole a little , as I just said .
Should he succeed in escaping from <NAME> , as he had escaped from <NAME> ?
Every one was thinking of the castaway on <NAME> .
When the axis became perpendicular these things would be different .
That was the secret of the future .
The night passed without incident .
The lightning filled the defile , and the thunderclaps had become one continued peal .
Their safety was at least provisionally insured .
<NAME> gave in to all these reasons .
`` Does she come directly from <NAME> ? ''
No indication of land being in sight .
The brave sailor shouted hurrah !
I was in a state of intense excitement .
I shut my eyes -- Some instants after , a damp warmth revived me .
It was certainly a very alarming situation to be in .
`` That comes from the volcano , '' he said .
Who dares to say the contrary ? ''
I am not going to waste my breath on you .
`` Nothing is easier , <NAME> , '' replied <NAME> .
Here and there were a few grotesque blackened and branchless stumps .
We were deeply attached to our brave eider-duck hunter .
And how we shall be able to laugh at the post-office administration !

“ Must get some more , ” he said very quietly .
There was nothing which the rich fazender refused his son .
They looked like a succession of sharp points lengthened into a tremulous line .
One would even say that -- '' `` That -- '' repeated the captain .
Well , good for the <NAME> ! ''
`` I have good hopes , captain , as I have already said .
Its absence made me uneasy .
<NAME> had brought reflection , reflection doubt , and doubt had resuscitated hope .
The convicts had left the plateau nearly half-an-hour before , having devastated it !
There was no shelter , and nothing for it but to bear it stolidly .
Their dread was great , but it did not last many seconds .
Had you thought of what might be done in the summer ? ''
Would not our first installation of discovery have been under circumstances decidedly extremely favorable ?
I heard all the time a strange rumbling outside the cave .
<NAME> seekest an uncertain help .
The gate of the corral was opened .
<NAME> must not see her ! ” <NAME> hesitated a moment .
`` We 'll soon see , '' answered the doctor .
<NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> dashed into the cave .
`` You will take that off at once , or we shall see ! ''
You know not the importance of your singular and happy discovery . ''
I did not wish to go ashore until the next day .
He it was who defended me in the trial at <NAME> .
I began to be considerably puzzled .
Come and engage your berth . ''
“ To talk about ? ” asked the sailor .
`` If you only listen , you will hear , '' replied M'Nicholl quietly .
The eggs were very welcome , and we eat them like lords . ''
The <NAME> was then some hundreds of miles from the nearest coast .
The rain had stopped , but the storm was raging with redoubled fury .
In this way bricks could easily be raised into <NAME> .
This was not the reporter 's opinion .
He drew it and returned a second time to the charge .
His abode was pointed out to me and I called at the house .
<NAME> and <NAME> became very uneasy .
I tried to resist sleep .
we must see if it will carry all five of us ! ''
An unhoped-for change in the situation had taken place .
Not a word passed his lips .
`` I 'd like to see you do it in eighty days . ''
`` I 'm glad _we're_ through it anyhow , '' observed M'Nicholl .
<NAME> <NAME> did not answer .
437 `` A <NAME> CARRIED THEM TO KIEL '' .
A shower of fire had succeeded the rain .
A frightful crash was heard above the tumult of the elements .
They had simply forgotten to allow a third for friction .
It seemed like a ship 's hull overturned , the keel in the air .
he added sadly , falling into a silent reverie .
`` I will not contradict you , '' replied <NAME> .
The Expedition were well pleased when the inhospitable shores of <NAME> disappeared from view .
Even a little Arabic I can digest !
At last , on the 12th February , in S. lat .
He only took with him moral proofs .
At this moment the sun passed the meridian .
All three arrived without difficulty on the opposite shore .
It was now one o ’ clock in the morning .
You have devoted yourselves to the common weal .
`` And you attribute this colour to the presence of a microscopic seaweed ? ''
It was then six in the evening , and <NAME> set about preparing supper .
But <NAME> went from one opening to another , still going higher .

Several expeditions were made about this time into the depths of the <NAME> .
A profound and terrible silence reigned around us -- a silence of the tomb .
A cry was about to escape her .
Listen to me as a friend .
The water was spurted up to a great distance in all directions .
Still all went on peaceably until the afternoon of the 13th .
It was when <NAME> was born .
<NAME> <NAME> and the boy walked near each other , without speaking .
He would have answered by some axiom from <NAME> .
The probability that suggested itself was that the schooner ’ s fuel was exhausted .
`` A little later a quarrel arose .
There was not an officer nor a soldier left in <NAME> .
He plunged in his staff , and felt no resistance .
But <NAME> would never think of occupying his until the very last moment .
<NAME> had become a thorough farmer , heartily attached to his crops .
No pity was to be expected at his hands .
“ They scampered off too quick for honest folks , ” said <NAME> .
<NAME> was the real object of <NAME> .
And I knew that by speaking one little word all this suffering would cease .
<NAME> <NAME> condemned them to a dozen stripes each .
We ’ ll carry him off in the very teeth of those <NAME> rascals !
How would you get at them ?
I turned to <NAME> .
I did not even dream .
“ I hope so ! ” was <NAME> ’ s only reply .
The fruits did not lag behind the vegetables .
Both are little frequented , and both will serve us .
`` Perhaps it is its reflection in the fog , '' said <NAME> .
Slowly and sadly the population quitted the yard .
All around , the lonely sea extended to the limits of the horizon .
He understood all about cooking well .
The weather was very unfavorable during the whole of the summer season .
They are fairly industrious , they know how to sew and weave .
“ What a large town ! ” said <NAME> .
The steward was quite crestfallen .
<NAME> kept the compresser always wet .
`` Who knows whither we shall be forced to go , <NAME> ?
His companions stared at each other , scarcely believing their ears .
`` More or less , '' answered the doctor .
The corpse of the drowned man which had been stretched on the sand arose !
and is it not that which is carrying us towards the <NAME> ?
His active spirit and love of movement rebelled against a garrison life .
cried <NAME> , who was the first awake .
I could not account for them .
At length he was obliged to stoop beneath the arm which threatened him .
After all , I began to think the document very absurd .
Two more hours passed and the balloon was scarcely 400 feet above the water .
Hence it is singularly fertile .
`` I am only due at <NAME> tomorrow before noon . ''
`` Then how did it manage ? ''
The colonists had as yet , therefore , no means of signalising their presence .
<NAME> , they 'll pay dearly for it ! ''
“ A young girl accompanied me , ” said he .
Only violent means could stop him , rushing to his ruin .
AN immense barrier lay across the route to the southeast .
The view was indeed well worth seeing .
Here is something to drink my health with at the nearest tavern . ''
<NAME> <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> did not leave their beds .
`` Well , take it into your hand .
<NAME> <NAME> and his second appeared at this moment .
“ I love it as I loved my poor mother .
I can swear to it .
<NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> and <NAME> posted themselves in impregnable line .
Was I wrong to trouble you ?
What matters it to you ? ''
`` Certainly not , '' replied the Professor with consummate coolness .
Meanwhile something had happened which cut <NAME> to the heart .
Would it not be running the risk of certain shipwreck ?
`` As you are so weak , do not speak .
Do the honors of the place a little better .
`` They proceed in various ways .
This remark proves that <NAME> was capable of doing justice to his predecessors .
asked <NAME> , astounded at his friend 's wonderful memory .
`` And he will certainly come . ''
The point of arrival seems to fly farther from our gaze .
We began at last to scale the last stage .
Have we eaten all the sheep we bought in <NAME> ? ''
His face wore its usual expression of firmness .
Therefore , she must accompany me .
“ There is one horse sound enough at present .
`` There 's the difficulty , '' broke in the major .
Twenty minutes afterward , the <NAME> stopped short with a violent jolt .
The fact was , Hans never troubled himself about much except his money .
was <NAME> 's only reply .
The inquisitive <NAME> ’ s enthusiasm alone had not been damped .
Watchers were placed among the ruins of the castle .
On the following day , before dawn , the <NAME> sailed .
`` My opinion is formed , '' replied <NAME> , sharply .
This was exactly what I wanted to know .
There his declaration was received .
`` But is the air replaced by nothing ? ''
<NAME> for some time sought <NAME> in vain .
exclaimed <NAME> , `` it is cold enough to freeze a white bear . ''
After many unsuccessful attempts , a narrow opening was perceived .
Nevertheless , after this repast each gave way to his own reflections .
It is vexing , for it would have been a splendid chase .
A mouse would not have made less noise , running over a thick carpet .
Perhaps it contained -- -- ” “ It is more than probable !
`` But what man has been sufficiently desperate to do such a thing ? ''
`` Yes , '' said <NAME> , going to the door of the saloon .
`` Do you perceive the château ?
The outside temperature was -50° .
Of the <NAME> she knew no more than what flowed before her eyes .
No time was lost before discussing it .
I could hear a pickax .
<NAME> also explored the source of the <NAME> .
`` Have more sense than to ask such questions .
They could easily excuse his excitement on the subject .
Have you taken note of how wonderfully sound is propagated ? ''
Has he ever said what he was doing here ?
It was of him they were speaking .
Improbable conjectures both , to a man who fled from inhabited continents .
It is not a piece of a planet . ''
Did not <NAME> know his business ?
<NAME> 's imperturbable coolness set me up again .
I must indeed insist on it .
At first I would not allow that I had been so grossly deceived .
What a spectacle was before our eyes !
The secretary of the <NAME> burst into the room .
Would not this be enough to infuse life into the whole continent ?
<NAME> and <NAME> stared at each other first , then they stared about them .
`` And does that not alarm you , Mr .
`` I will not forget , sir . ''

This was the <NAME> <NAME> 's establishment .
`` Are you going to the theatre this evening ? ''
To all these inquiries , the count responded in the affirmative .
“ Ah ! ” he screamed , raising himself with a superhuman effort .
It is difficult to understand such a resolution .
The <NAME> was thus razed like a pontoon .
`` Ah , my brave <NAME> , we are saved ! ''
`` On the way to Yokohama ? ''
We have no pity for these ferocious creatures .
<NAME> lilacs rose to a height of twenty feet .
“ <NAME> out of place ? ” repeated <NAME> , agitated with alarm .
In addition to all this , at least a hundred living animals . ''
For that he had his reasons .
`` You see , I was right .
A few straggling beams still fell on the field clear of trees .
`` How long will she stop at <NAME> ? ''
All at once his eye brightened .
<NAME> not <NAME> to have a voice in the matter ?

Happily these acclivities wound up the interior of the volcano and favored their ascent .
They re-entered their retreat ; but <NAME> first looked about him .
He reflected a moment , and his course was determined on .
They wore the national costume , and were adorned with a profusion of jewels .
No one thought of sleep .
It was within six miles of us .
What was her father doing ?

said <NAME> ; `` why should we not arrive safely ?
“ A splendid shot ! ” exclaimed the hunter .
His head sank on his chest , and he appeared buried in deep thought .
At last he reached the top , the yawning mouth of the crater .
Then it was that <NAME> remembered !
<NAME> retraced his steps , feeling them with his hand .
the Maories do not search their prisoners .
He felt a violent blow on his side and was thrown to the ground .
At the end of five months the <NAME> left the island .
It was a direct route across , and lay exactly along the 37th parallel .
“ The <NAME> Zealanders are incensed against <NAME> , and especially against the <NAME> .
Where was he going to ?
The next day there were but ten miles between the vessel and the land .
Was he playing upon my credulity ?
They had concentrated along the upper course of the <NAME> .
he cried in a loud voice , which was heard by all the crew .
We were about to descend farther into the interior of the earth .
But he was not idle .
Of water , not a drop .
<NAME> was right , it was too beautiful .
`` <NAME> is probably irreparable , '' said <NAME> .
He saw the <NAME> was right .
In 938 he was canonized by <NAME> .
`` Will they not come inside the <NAME> ? ''
answered <NAME> ; `` life or death depends upon our dispatch ! ''
I for one should have laughed the suggestion to scorn . ''
This is the 22nd , and we shall reach <NAME> in time . ''
He was fast recovering strength .
`` Do you think they fancy the same thing ? ''
<NAME> said nothing , but his silence covered serious irritation .
But what chance is there of success ?
A ray glanced on the table placed near the bed .

A second voyage made by the same explorers the following year was without results .
Let him come on , if he dares !
It approached , after having passed in stately procession along the shore of <NAME> .
About midnight , the whole city seemed to be in a blaze .
A black mass soon appeared .
`` I arrest you in the <NAME> 's name ! ''
His face , already changed by death , was a dreadful spectacle .
He gazed , a prey to violent excitement .
Who could rescue him from that powerful pressure ?
The hog , hit by the electric ball , fell stone dead .
`` He showed him to you ! ''
They appeared to have very little to do at this time of year .
There 's money in it , as you Americans say .
This , of course , made him redouble his attention .
I am aware that ships have often passed over the indicated bearings of land .
He gazed down into the dark abyss -- nothing was to be seen .

And each one gazed with terror .
`` The fact can be explained both simply and geologically .
<NAME> as the decree may seem , I will not repine .

No detail of the scene , therefore , escaped our notice .
This proposition was unanimously agreed to .
My first thought was to try and move the mortar with my hand .
His only idea was to go ahead .
<NAME> stood there , perfectly motionless , the very picture of amazement .
In any case , the survivors of the _Jane_ were not among them .
`` I acknowledge that , <NAME> .

But after what they had gone through , they were indifferent to trifling annoyances .
It contains two sandy creeks , into which two streams flow .
I felt <NAME> slipping a dagger into my hand .
<NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> were playing at dominoes !
Their geological researches were put off till the next day .
These were the tree-kings of <NAME> , as celebrated as the cedars of <NAME> .
<NAME> unpacked some dried meat and a dozen biscuits .

It was meddling with phenomena of which nature herself has the absolute monopoly .
All were indeed wonderfully well .
Here are maps on a large scale by which you may follow it .
`` Passepartout suits me , '' responded <NAME> .
`` <NAME> is the grandest name in <NAME> ! ''
replied the detective , shrugging his shoulders and turning on his heel .
I wholly forgot the past ; I utterly despised the future .
At <NAME> 's cry <NAME> , letting his gun fall , rushed towards him .
But surely they had some claim on this territory ?
`` I have lost , '' said <NAME> .
Not one can land there now without our permission ! ''
This last is a large town containing fine squares and shops .
The natives did not appear surprised .
They speak a different language .
That is the <NAME> 's favorite phrase now .
If it did not land there , there must have been some deviation .
`` That is exactly my opinion , '' said the reporter .
After a short interval the <NAME> arrived at <NAME> , where she was repaired .
The same insufficient light , the same solitude .
He was forced to reach <NAME> on foot .
He never used the cosy chambers which the <NAME> provides for its favoured members .
You know that curious cellular matter which constitutes the elementary tissues of vegetable ?
When the task was completed , they began to arrange the interior .
In this meeting at <NAME> all his judges were against him .
He sent in search of it , but only the rudder was found .
A frightful recollection came to my mind .
He was the most miserable of mortals .
He did not gesticulate as yet , but this could not be far off .
Hans listened calmly , and then nodded his head .
It is useless to describe the astonishing performances of the acrobats and gymnasts .
The train had then stopped .
<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> were grateful to <NAME> for the boon .
`` I know it , '' he said in a deep voice .
As he went along , <NAME> pondered deeply .
“ You lost no time at <NAME> , ” dryly observed the <NAME> .
`` <NAME> 's <NAME> , '' repeated <NAME> , mechanically .
No , it could not be .
who some years before had refused all support to <NAME> .
<NAME> aided him much , without being disturbed at the occupation of his mates .
But was he alone or accompanied ?
`` I know of but one , '' returned <NAME> tranquilly .
It was composed of numberless legions of that species of grasshopper called crickets .
`` If you attempt it , I 'll throttle you ! ''
A storm of acclamations greeted these words .
My uncle lay fast asleep -- or dead .
<NAME> <NAME> aware of the treachery of his first officer ?
No incident had yet occurred of a nature calculated to shake their confidence .
“ That is no reply , <NAME> , ” said <NAME> .
`` What do you call faults ? ''
No more land in sight .
The pressure was too great , and all our attempts were utter failures .

He tried to pierce the darkness .
<NAME> <NAME> continued , “ His sleep is getting more composed .
It was named <NAME> , in honour of the solemn anniversary of the morrow .
They started from <NAME> , on the 16th of May , 1735 .
“ What are they ? ” cried <NAME> .
The plain truth was , that there was no explanation possible .
What , then , hindered him from putting an end to his blind antagonist ?
Suddenly <NAME> uttered an exclamation which attracted the attention of his companions .
growled the <NAME> , attempting to respond with a vigorous kick .
Meanwhile , the sailor attentively observed the disposition and nature of the surrounding country .
The <NAME> had put on full speed .
<NAME> is more dreadful than private duels in <NAME> .
But to return to the question .
`` I have no doubt of it . ''
Neither Hevelius , <NAME> , <NAME> , nor <NAME> seemed to have known them .
A native came on board the <NAME> .
This privilege was justly reserved for that illustrious body .
<NAME> could not restrain a threatening gesture .

He therefore held himself aloof from his former acquaintances .
`` Doubtless , '' was my natural reply .
The road from <NAME> to <NAME> was easy .
The boat was not more than two cables-lengths off the islet when she stopped .

All observation of the lunar disc was impossible .
`` When shall we be there ? ''
An aide-de-camp came to the room , the door of which was closed .
But an unexpected incident disturbed my preparations for departure .
<NAME> <NAME> and its two islets were sighted upon the 13th of January .
Suddenly , close by he heard a pistol-shot .
`` And if you are caught in a hurricane ? ''
I could not understand the awful truth .
`` So that science is wrong by fourteen hundred and seventy-four degrees and four-tenths .
Suddenly , this crowd of people became violently agitated .
We may be sure they were too polite to refuse it .
`` I have two hours before me , <NAME> .
“ Are you going to forsake him , <NAME> ? ” asked <NAME> .
These words pronounced , the second descended .
352 `` I found the monarch seated on his throne '' .
The garments which we wore were quite white with frost and ice . ''
Hunters and dog ran in vain ; these rodents escaped them easily .
349 `` A <NAME> STRUGGLE WITH THE <NAME> '' .
this is what they were not able to say .
The rain was falling in torrents .
`` You are free , '' answered the engineer .
The <NAME> went back to <NAME> by way of the imperial canal .
The eyes of <NAME> , with a peculiar expression , constantly sought his father .
That done , <NAME> returned to his work .

The night was dark in the extreme .
`` Has all the game felt it necessary to go south ? ''
A boat was lowered , and seven men jumped into her .
What was the occasion of this excited assemblage ?
The nearest port was <NAME> , the <NAME> of <NAME> .
He had forgotten the past , its vexations and delays .
I came back to the house quite downcast and disappointed .
Where was he going to ?
`` They would make the voyage for nothing but to see the moon ! ''
`` Wounded by slights and caricatures , these asses ' kicks have finished me !
How could it be supposed that they had ?
The <NAME> limit had evidently been passed .
cried <NAME> , delighted at the happy augury .
`` And your master is -- '' `` He stayed on board . ''
“ It seems so , ” replied <NAME> .
My two companions , safe and sound , were near me holding my hands .
`` And that was -- '' `` Four days ago . ''
“ The convicts have disappeared ! ” said <NAME> .
But <NAME> did not appear .
Circumstances having brought them together , they no longer thought of separating .
Under these circumstances , the position of J. T. <NAME> became daily more critical .
At this period the earth sloped downwards ; the light took a uniform tint .
Here he sleeps , takes his meals , in short , lives .
those are two English words .
roared <NAME> , laughing till the tears came .
Their friends did their best to amuse them .
`` Where can they have crossed ? ''
asked <NAME> , hardly believing his ears .
And the box containing them was launched into space .
At noon we were no further advanced than at eight o'clock in the morning .
But before it fell a powerful hand stopped the <NAME> ’ s arm .

So then we two were agreed in our trust in <NAME> .
No rivers to stop one !
fire ! ” he shouted , scarcely comprehending what had happened .
It was just possible that the fugitives would escape this danger .
What , then , had this mysterious Doctor Ox done ?
`` These people are revoltingly dirty .
No one must even suspect what he really was .
`` I 'll attend to him in a jiffy .
The anticipations so skilfully conceived by <NAME> la <NAME> , were realized .
But a terrible cry from the crew interrupted them .
`` These recollections affected our way of dealing with the <NAME> .
It happened to be the day of a <NAME> festival .
`` Have our friends been told , uncle ? ''
The engineer examined this black granite .
Hence the point of observation was called <NAME> .
<NAME> , dangers , sickness , all were forgotten .
Perhaps she might at least gnaw through the meshes which imprisoned the lion .
It took more than half an hour to settle on a suitable landing-place .
The old globe is far , far away .
`` A peninsula -- very like a thighbone in shape . ''
Top , at that moment , barked in a strange manner .
“ You do see it at last , then , ” said <NAME> .
They soon returned with a load of brushwood .
Hans the hunter is indeed an invaluable man ! ''
“ I will tell you , my friends , ” said the engineer .
The whole region boils like an immense cauldron hung over subterranean fires .
But he knew little of these parts , and his charts were quite insufficient .
Lieutenant <NAME> was able to procure provisions without landing at the last named .
See , that ice looks impenetrable .

`` My word , you are difficult to please , '' answered <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> and his companions walked over this new ground with great care .
The profit , of course , would be enormous .
Herming descended the cabin stairs .
Perhaps the boatswain was right .
The geographer uttered no sound .
It was time , then , that their wintering was over .
The surface is all dazzling glare , or pitchy gloom .
With the tips of two fingers he gently pressed our hands and smiled .
<NAME> soon gained admittance to the presence of King O-Too .
I resolved however to show no fear .

<NAME> <NAME> 's glowing description of this island will be recalled .
how are you going to manage that , captain ? ''
<NAME> <NAME> had accomplished the journey round the world in eighty days !
`` I think so , '' said the guide .
The doctor contented himself with making no reply to this .
My very soul grew sick as my body shuddered with horror .
Happily for him , the station had neither gates nor barriers .
We are decidedly not upon the road followed by <NAME> .
For three days it continued thus .
His example was soon followed by a considerable number of natives .
A new life was peering through the melting snows .
[ Illustration : Fight between the <NAME> and a <NAME> galleon .
<NAME> then gave his attentions to the cares of housekeeping .
we should now have been mourning for one or other of you .
<NAME> could not rest , knowing the <NAME> was so near him .
<NAME> <NAME> turned quickly towards this ancient clock which still spoke .
His master , freeing his feet from the stirrups , began to swim vigorously .
The following evening the discussion was renewed .
Words struggled to escape from his lips .
A rigged vessel would have been entangled in the blocked up gorges .
The source of the <NAME> had been approached , but not reached .
`` I am sorry to hear it , sir .
“ The animals are cared for , <NAME> , ” said <NAME> .
Could they do so , even if they had desired ?

My uncle was fifty years old ; tall , thin , and wiry .
<NAME> <NAME> had accordingly been prudent .
`` We have made the circuit of our satellite , then ? ''
`` So it appears , '' replied <NAME> .
The works were then resumed .
`` Your relatives -- '' `` I have no longer any relatives . ''
The engineer and the reporter re-entered the house .
He took his chafing-dish , and once more attacked the narrow opening .
Their heads were in a ferment .
Still the mast holds good against the storm .
`` Yes , he 's a mile to leeward . ''

`` What shall we do , Barbican ? ''
I had nothing to object to these reasonings .
It was an alarming sight .
Were we , then , going direct to the interior of the earth ?
He had done his best to answer every question put to him .
Thus the colony was increased by a new member .
`` No ; a concert of morses . ''
`` Are we not arriving too late ? ''
<NAME> was then made acquainted with the facts which had occurred during his seclusion .
They are famous for the skill and honesty with which they do business . ''
And yet all this time he hesitated .
<NAME> was the sight that <NAME> brought before my eyes !
They were in the hand of God .
cried the <NAME> , who on grand occasions was not above a little slang .
<NAME> <NAME> was now on board the <NAME> , but <NAME> was there also .
A fortunate accident did much to aid his researches .
<NAME> had eaten nothing for twenty-four hours .
said <NAME> , with an accent of pride .
The town is divided into two well-defined quarters .
How prevent the devastations with which the convicts threatened the plateau ?
All darted down the opening .
`` That 's the kind of a man I am ! ''
The following is a short account of what he learned .
<NAME> <NAME> respected the captain 's silence , and waited till he should speak .
`` But never mind the <NAME> now .
The night was very dark .
Accompanied by <NAME> and <NAME> , I seated myself on the platform .
`` That is your wish , <NAME> ? ''
They managed their immense property with rare ability and uncommon energy .
During dinner <NAME> showed himself more talkative than usual .
The crew waited with folded arms .
`` My heart could not be mistaken ! ''
`` Hand the latter over to me , '' said the <NAME> .
In a few minutes the crew had abandoned the <NAME> .
`` Yes , '' said the captain , haughtily .
<NAME> was swimming vigorously , cutting through the waves , and was nearing <NAME> .
I will briefly explain the cause .
The natives were at first alarmed at the appearance of the travellers .
Unfortunately man can not produce it at will .
“ <NAME> , my Lord , ” repeated <NAME> , in a mocking tone .
The new combination only furnished a series of letters just as enigmatic .
He looked far from that .
he exclaimed , as the port clock struck .
Strike the body and it resounds like a block of wood .
For a while I lay in a sort of pleasant trance .
They were made purveyors to the colony .
You think our lease may last longer than that !

It is a perfect model of accuracy and system .
The steam came hissing out of the valves ; and this made <NAME> indignant .
`` From me more than from the others . ''
Once at <NAME> , he would find some means of going on .
`` Mutterings can be distinctly heard in the very bowels of the volcano ! ''
`` I really ca n't say anything , '' replied <NAME> .
`` Yes , instinct speaks through them , and instinct is never deceived . ''
`` What time did the last train arrive from <NAME> ? ''
In the meanwhile , <NAME> undertook to vanquish the resistance of the ruffian .
An undoubted case of combustion lies before us .
The half of their journey was now accomplished .
sang M'Nicholl , in the highest excitement .
“ Let go , or I ’ ll kill you ! ” repeated <NAME> .
Should they be in time to save him ?
The current bore him along and he rapidly receded from the shore .
`` I did , captain , '' answered <NAME> .
At <NAME> , old <NAME> awaited them in the little house of the Strogoffs .
The <NAME> of the <NAME> .
Since <NAME> 's attempt , nothing seemed impossible to the Americans .

<NAME> instincts succumbed to scientific pride and exultation .
`` And you should have been rewarded by a baptism , <NAME> .
He was gently drawn up to <NAME> .
<NAME> was also uttering piercing cries .
I will not allow one of you to expose himself in open day . ''
Here then was an interesting problem to solve .
He continued to listen , but without hearing the slightest noise .
This town trades with all the world .
But he had to resign himself .
But the ladder had quite disappeared .
They seemed to be cries of distress .
One might have heard the beating of their hearts amid this perfect silence .
`` I shall expect you at ten , '' said Mr Smith .
The neighboring coast had no anchorage on 27 @ latitude .
All rose at once and signed to the <NAME> to keep their distance .
Here is his description ; it answers exactly to that of <NAME> . ''
`` I think we must wait till night before acting . ''
Indeed , the hall fairly shook with it .
said the doctor ; `` after the rule we have the example . ''
`` And you will answer to me for this insult ? ''

They were now at the 4th of June .
`` And he often related these things to you ? ''
223 `` THEN A <NAME> EXPLOSION WAS HEARD '' .
Had not <NAME> and <NAME> spent three successive winters in the arctic regions ?
`` I do n't think he has any intention of coming ashore . ''
I followed him , and went into the large drawing-room .
<NAME> remained for us but instant flight .
With this he flung the book upon the ground .
“ Are you satisfied , old <NAME> ? ” he asked .
Indeed , a bright light appeared twenty miles to the north-east .
`` Where we are going , '' answered the <NAME> , quietly .
The moment had arrived for taking their places in the projectile !
My uncle has on more than one occasion , tried deep-sea soundings .
Rogers took him on board , and appointed him boatswain 's mate .
`` He is living , '' cried <NAME> , who was bending over him .
Every heart beat loudly while they advanced to the projectile .
But , <NAME> , why do you insist on Lunarians ?
They killed the smallest birds in our presence .
`` Then it was to procure fresh meat for my crew .
Do you know the history of <NAME> ? ''
This last supposition was only too probable .
<NAME> and <NAME> rushed towards the jaguar .
My flesh crawled as it became probable that he would discover the secret .
It is easy to understand how mortifying this condition was to <NAME> .
The calmness of the atmosphere was very threatening , the air being perfectly still .
Therefore , the vessel had not struck .
<NAME> 's uneasiness increased as he saw his projectile resist the influence of gravitation .
) : a temperature that at this depth seemed common to all latitudes .
After ten interminable minutes his clear voice reached us on the deck .
“ Burnt linen , ” replied the boy .
`` That is no reason , '' said <NAME> .
We will therefore make a few extracts from the description given by <NAME> .
`` Yes , forgotten by all else , but not by us .
We should have been back in <NAME> six months ago . ''
They were well made , their figures handsome , and their faces agreeable .
We were very unwilling to take this step ; but our guides were inflexible .

<NAME> foresaw that if they became drunk , terrible scenes would ensue .
The <NAME> was here very wide , and its wooded banks lovely .
More on your toe , <NAME> !
<NAME> , compelled to force it open , set to work .
They worked as desperately as if they were contesting in a Royal yacht regatta .
What was the language hidden in them ?
No matter , so that we did .
But fishing-up the projectile was not the only thing to be thought of .
Still the same fierce , implacable defiance towards human society !
And this is what had happened .
He must be fifteen or twenty years older than I am .

A magnet with prodigious power of attraction ! ''
Was the game , then , up ?
There the experiment will be more conclusive . ''

He was over six feet in height .
“ Well , lose no more time , ” said the Major .
`` The domain is limited , '' said <NAME> .
O Dr. Clawbonny , I never felt worse in my life !
The <NAME> made a motion to keep silence .
At six o'clock the travellers found themselves exactly over the north pole .
An end to useless recriminations !

Which being translated from <NAME> into plain English means -- '' After . ''
A chief and several men tried to snatch the oars from the sailors .
He forthwith devoted his talents and wealth to the service of this cause .
they never thought of how they were to get back .
<NAME> brilliantly-coloured butterflies hovered over the explorers .
`` I do , '' was the reply .
“ Do you dare to judge me ? ” exclaimed <NAME> .
Oh , tell me , ” said the girl , earnestly .
What course should he take ?

I waited , I listened , every sense was merged in that of hearing !
They weep all day and drink to intoxication all night .
A sharp pang shot through <NAME> .
His age was past finding out .
Numbers of bivalves were found there , especially small pearl oysters .
At any rate the sailor was not sorry to go to breakfast on board .
Indeed , my good friends , we shall not forget you ! ''
In short , the Quiquendonians have no need of anybody .
By daybreak the entire population of <NAME> was astir .
Their most compact union of power constitutes the province of <NAME> .

They returned to <NAME> on September 9th , without having lost a single man .
This is what <NAME> Harding wished to know .
About twelve o'clock a distant sound as of thunder fell upon our ears .
I set sail , and allowed the vessels to drift , taking constant soundings .

This was a great loss of time , and was also very fatiguing .

Who would attend him when he was sick ?
`` We shall take possession of the Moon ourselves ! ''
Her public contributions amounted to the sum of 216,000 florins -- a perfect godsend .

`` Having no better opinion , I agree with these gentlemen . ''
Besides , there we shall find the lamps that we left .
But speed was impossible in their serpent-like progress down this sloping crest .
He could say no more , but grasped <NAME> ’ s hand .
At that moment , <NAME> turned to me .
These last words justified the colonists ' presentiment .
<NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> -- did they still breathe ?
`` It is very clear , captain , '' replied the boatswain .
Despite his feverish gayety , even <NAME> was touched .
The <NAME> of the <NAME> .
“ What is it you know ? ” he asked .
After landing the carriage he would return and fetch <NAME> .

The old pilot of the <NAME> could be relied on .
By what means could inflammation be prevented ?
Just then the lieutenant drew the <NAME> 's attention again .
As to leaving <NAME> and <NAME> here alone , we could not do it !

It was the captain of the <NAME> .
<NAME> had thrown himself down under the brushwood at the side of the road .

The lightning blazed and the thunder continued to roll for some hours .
<NAME> led her father towards the more pleasant promenades of the town .
This man expressed himself with perfect ease , without any accent .
But what is this fierce wind ? ''
We will fly to-night , even if the sea should swallow us up . ''

<NAME> <NAME> is a character , is he ? ''
It was a fortune which had fallen from the sky .
`` Do not doubt it , <NAME> , for it was painful to him .
Was not his sadness only the result of his seclusion ?
But how happened it that <NAME> had recognised <NAME> ?
One would have thought he knew his way among them .
Is such a body in motion ?
The arrival of a courier from <NAME> interrupted the ball .
Things were now altered ; <NAME> spies swarmed in the <NAME> provinces .
And does he still follow under the ocean those frightful retaliations ?
The brave dog joined his master , barking .
`` What will the projectile weigh then ? ''
An hour later , <NAME> , the doctor , and <NAME> regained the <NAME> .
`` It is supposable , at least , '' said <NAME> .
Another thing that now struck <NAME> was the extraordinary contraction of the horizon .
I listened if I could hear him walking the room contiguous to mine .
The reporter could not refrain from embracing the generous boy .
To us what was that ?
And they have healed your bruises in the most marvelous manner .
<NAME> had torn up his shirt , and was mechanically making lint .
`` Should be at least 11,972 yards the first second . ''
Were these gipsies trying to show themselves as little as possible ?
`` That involves my telling you how the <NAME> is worked . ''
He remained motionless long enough to alarm his companions .
“ <NAME> , <NAME> ! ” he said in a low voice .
“ So soon ! ” exclaimed <NAME> in a piteous tone .
The clock indicated eighteen minutes to nine .
There was little or no humidity , and the heat was quite bearable .
It would be utterly impossible to depict the impotent rage of <NAME> .

Could he not rely on the sagacity of the faithful animal ?
`` An important thing , truly , this eruption !

Now , what will happen if a hungry animal swallows one of these baits ?
`` Aluminium '' > has a certain charm .
`` Very well , '' said <NAME> .
These two little peccaries are not more than three months old !
It is enough to know them .
They all took their places in the pirogue .
The latter was less abrupt , but the former more wooded .
`` The first case , '' repeated Judge <NAME> .
`` Has the resistance of ice been calculated ? ''
Had the unhappy man been dragged away by his former accomplices ?
I did not even dream of it .
“ <NAME> , <NAME> ! ” cried <NAME> , who was the first awake .
Of course I was at a loss to understand .
`` Yes , <NAME> , snow ; the surface of which is deeply frozen .
`` Can he change these pieces of ice into pieces of meat ?

“ <NAME> me the truth , <NAME> , ” said <NAME> , calmly .
And besides , how could he have acted otherwise ?
“ They burned it after they passed ! ” said <NAME> .

A sudden light flashed across his brain .
After some minutes of silence , the man was vanquished by the Professor .
At this moment the clock of <NAME> struck half-past eleven .
<NAME> had heard <NAME> ’ s call .
Next day when I awoke the change was magical .
Its aspect still remains unchanged .

The verdict of the jury was affirmative on all the questions .
at last exclaimed Professor Hardwigg between two savage growls .
They paid a visit to the spot where the camp had been pitched .
Talents , hitherto unrecognized , betrayed themselves .
According to my calculation we must have been very near <NAME> .
They still chatted , but the conversation had ceased to be general .
“ <NAME> yourself ! ” said the Major .
They are in our power !

The final sound was sooner heard .
One of them must fall .
It gives me an idea , dear boys .
There is southern blood in them .

A quarter of an hour passed while the boat advanced in this direction .
His first care was to reassemble his colleagues in the board-room of the <NAME> .

Four days later he again landed with two young officers , <NAME> .
As for <NAME> , he did not appear .

“ Well , I ’ ll undertake to cook it , ” said <NAME> .
“ Then the volcano is not totally extinct ? ” said the reporter .
What were the feelings which agitated the heart of the worthy magistrate ?
Twice in the evening he came upon the glacis of this gate .
Then immediately a loud voice shouted , -- “ Land !
I think I shall induce our captain .
Therefore there is not an hour to lose ! ''
“ What ’ s the matter , <NAME> ?
This question <NAME> could not cease asking himself .
All the houses were thoroughly searched .
`` Twenty men , '' says <NAME> , `` threw themselves upon me .
“ Where can he have come from ?
Five main lines connect <NAME> with <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> made up his mind rapidly .
All at once this agitation , movement and noise stopped as though by magic .
This information determined him to abandon his scheme of going to <NAME> .

His very look was an interrogation .
Not a living creature was moving in that desert region .
<NAME> <NAME> could get safely away .
`` Alone , but with his dog , '' said <NAME> .
Cost what it might , he must get at <NAME> !
How much do you want ? ” “ A pound .
`` Yes , <NAME> , '' answered the carpenter .
`` An argument of little value , since the poles are not inhabited . ''
It evidently formed the universal substructure of the new asteroid .
`` That is no reason , '' I replied .
`` Then we may form our opinion ? ''

`` Well , what difference does that make ? ''
While still young he was sent to sea as cabin-boy on board merchant ships .

To return to the <NAME> .
<NAME> began directly to make his raft .

The shadow of the stick was nothing but the needle of a dial .
`` About what age is he ? ''
All this was said in a tone as calm as it was firm .

The sacrifice of my life had been accomplished !
Some of the savages were running toward them , uttering ferocious cries .
Certainly a Government might possess such a destructive machine .
These were only suppositions -- very reasonable , are they not ? ''
He lived on a small allowance .
No , there has been a deviation .
His hopes , it is true , were concentrated upon his vessel .
<NAME> remained stationary in the same place , but did not sleep .
But then , the half-breed 's fixed idea !
Upon leaving <NAME> , the expedition sailed for the south-west coast of <NAME> .
There was half a day of anxiety for all .

`` A fine bay ; half choked with sand ! ''
In this manner each of them received a certain accurately-ascertained quantity of gas .
It was now a little past midnight .
They seated themselves at the table and spoke no more of <NAME> .
They did not , however , penetrate beyond 36 degrees N. lat .
When he had reached the end , he would return , walking backwards .
`` That 's a good habit , sir . ''
The lake narrowed very much as it stretched northwards .
Meanwhile we were advancing southward , and <NAME> had already passed from beneath us .
There remains but the third class , the superstitious .
So muttering , he followed his master .
It was capitally lighted with windows on all sides .
Harding then entered the <NAME> .
<NAME> knows what he 's talking about !
The inquiry was made with great care .
A second shot was heard .
“ What ’ s all this , <NAME> ? ” he asked .
Still he had not seen the precious liquid .
The brave animal could no longer have continued the journey .

The natives could scarcely be persuaded to go on board .
The compass was not reassuring .
Would they be right in the future ?
At noon they were still five miles from shore .
To-day is 4th January , and in five days the moon will be full .
But <NAME> , in his impatience , was often imprudent .
A shudder of terror seized the party and the heart of the young girl .
They were too close together to make use of their weapons .
An hour after , <NAME> was in her father ’ s arms .
`` Several of your colleagues have studied medicine . ''
Then “ Let this woman be conducted to <NAME> , ” he said .

His loquacious good-humour infected everyone .
There was every fear that the sick would not re-establish their health .
The works were then resumed .
<NAME> <NAME> will not let you leave her .
<NAME> , to save time , plucked the birds as he went along .
A national enterprise was at stake .
All looked like regular miners .
But the dog continued to bark more furiously than ever .
There is not a spot in all the province unknown to her .
I declared that I would go no farther .
He set out , therefore , and received from <NAME> a kindly welcome .
71 degrees 3 minutes and W. long .
The party uttered a cry of terror , and <NAME> hurried outside .

<NAME> , recovering her coolness , had plucked up courage to speak .
Selenographers are not agreed upon the nature of these colors .

The wire was there fastened to the rock .

But all they had to depend upon now was the <NAME> ’ s carbine .
The colonists even went the length of tapping every rock .
Their duties were slight and infrequent , so that they had plenty of leisure .
Having said this , I advanced toward the opening of the somber gallery .
<NAME> , she smiled upon him .
I repeat that I was just like the half-breed .
But what was to be done ?
Some wished to go , the others to remain .
He was the great partisan of all these superstitions .
But I quite approved of the <NAME> entering it .
Take your spear and do as I do . ''

“ Yes ; to-morrow I am going down into that abyss. ” “ <NAME> !
Not another word on the subject .

<NAME> and I took two hatchets ; <NAME> seized a harpoon .
I should have puzzled how to answer the question .
The log indicated a mean speed of between eight and nine miles .
<NAME> <NAME> was awaiting me .
Ten days after , on the 20th of December , <NAME> 's convalescence commenced .

We allude to the finding of the north-west passage .
His power was not manifested in any way .
replied <NAME> , his thoughts reverting involuntarily to a former invention of the <NAME> .

The colonists looked at each other , then at the engineer .
<NAME> conducted eight of these Patagonians on board .
`` Might it not be an excess of speed ? ''
Now that he was fully convinced , <NAME> had quite recovered his equanimity .
What was the mystery of his life ?
The day began to fade , and with the day the breeze fell also .

The part which heat plays in these transformations is known .
It was not a question of dead or dying .
So we must remain shut up in our Projectile ? ''
He tried to rise , but the effort was too great for his strength .
Why was <NAME> so much worse ?
`` That is just what I was thinking , '' answered <NAME> .
said the Captain at last to break the silence .
I ask you for your personal opinion . ''
As to the <NAME> , no trace either .

The <NAME> was furnished with long diagonal broadsides which carried it to all elevations .
The vast landscape before me was lit up like day .
He would not have changed it for any other .

It was <NAME> ’ s turn now to be amazed .
Rain now began to fall in torrents .
Two days later <NAME> found himself opposite the <NAME> , and encamped at <NAME> .

Answer me : who has exposed thee so often to so many dangers ?
But found no trace of <NAME> nor his sailors .
<NAME> advised her to turn in the opposite direction .
We shall go farther and higher ! ''
Another sign from <NAME> , who smiled slightly .
The storm had ceased during the night .
One might almost think so .
The mountains were lofty and covered with snow .
She was nearer , but in what direction was she sailing ?
“ It moves ! ” said he , at last .
How heartily did I wish myself with them !
To avoid altercation , <NAME> hurried the preparations for departure .
Was it the goal so ardently desired and so earnestly sought for ?
The direction of the current remained unchanged , always running from southwest to northeast .
The vessel was not more than three miles from us .
“ Oh , we will deal gently with you .
But on this day they sighted the <NAME> coast and <NAME> .
They had therefore to make use of the oars .

Were they then to be regarded as unfounded ?
The ground had evidently been convulsed by subterranean force .
The canoe was left here , carefully protected from the waves .
Then the hoist again ceased .
cried <NAME> , clapping his hands with pleasure .
`` Did Hearne dwell on this , boatswain ? ''
`` The sea -- the sea , '' I cried .
After all , I was not sorry for his obstinacy under the circumstances .
The reporter accordingly remained behind .
Hans shook his head in a terribly significant manner .
He , too , has noticed what we have to fear .
The two men then shook hands warmly .
`` But of what are we accused ? ''

From being coated with shining and resplendent lava , it became living rock .
`` Taste it , friend Ned -- taste it as you want .
`` It would be perfectly so , '' replied <NAME> .
They all rushed forthwith out of the <NAME> .

There was not a moment to be lost .

On this , <NAME> and the commissary accompanied the burgomaster into the parlour .
`` Those which we did not find ! ''
One thing I can say , my uncle never left off speaking .
He 's as prodigal as a thief !
The whole company started forward at once .
They eat them , therefore , by handfuls , and immediately experienced great relief .
They bore no apparent trace of any wound .
When we had slightly recovered our equilibrium , I proceeded to examine our cargo .
<NAME> need not fear to breathe it .
Every precaution was taken to keep the corvette almost completely motionless .
<NAME> <NAME> allowed himself to be convinced to a certain extent .

The prolonged absence of the <NAME> made <NAME> very uneasy .
`` Especially after a good meal . ''
We had now a day before us , a delay of about ten hours .

We were therefore compelled to defer the pleasure of being presented to him .

The gas , too much dilated , had burst the balloon .
A south or southwest wind generally puts to flight these little pests .

There was no time for the least delay .
The air was almost still .
His shipboard diet had turned his interior into a perfect gulf .
Soon the panels were shut .
Was he changed for the better ?
`` I doubt your having many competitors , '' was my reply .
At these words each one sprang to his feet as if moved by electricity .
For a hunter like you , sir , <NAME> ’ s a great country .

The world is big enough . ''
Some of them with a first floor !
It was a regular settlement on the banks of <NAME> .
He wished to struggle on to the end .
Another symptom also was marked .
The time passed in great anxiety .
To tempt the sea in a frail boat was certain destruction .
“ Look well at it , then ! ” said <NAME> .
We must redouble our watchfulness .
<NAME> <NAME> shouts the recitative which summons the <NAME> to vengeance .
They conversed less , and were more wrapt in their own thoughts .
`` And how are we to keep warm in the winter ? ''
`` Say a madman , and a dangerous madman , <NAME> .
There is what will make us handkerchiefs and shirts !
I sought for the awful white giant of the <NAME> !

The introduction of water had been the means of disturbing its equilibrium .

And now , whence had this chest come ?
Where in fact could they have found a spot more favorable for undisturbed repose ?

Several times our decks and rigging were covered with them .
This was what <NAME> had before him .
`` We must be before-hand with <NAME> of <NAME> ! ''
The secret of the <NAME> was impenetrable .

After one hour ’ s rest he resumed his course across the steppe .
`` But , captain , '' answered the sailor , little disposed to obey .
This expedition had other results which concern us more particularly .
[ Illustration : Map of the <NAME> . ]
`` I give it up , '' answered the major .
Then there was a moment of silence .
He found his friend <NAME> deprived of supreme authority .
Their companions returned to wait at the <NAME> .
The natives were black , with woolly hair , and perfectly naked .
If <NAME> should be in his room , he could see me .
“ That ’ s capital ! ” cried the sailor .
Now that he had found him dead he longed for him to be alive .

Would it do to tell the part the detective was playing ?
Several hours passed in this way .
Perhaps there is everything we want in there ! ''
His companions were profuse in expressing their desire to hear it .
<NAME> took a decisive resolution .
It was now a little after three o'clock in the morning .
“ Who is that ? ” asked <NAME> .
“ There is some painful mystery there ! ” said <NAME> .
He did not see me .
The surprise of the sailors of the <NAME> was great .
In such circumstances you do not choose your own thoughts .
Not in the least that they would expect to meet with any inhospitable rebuff .

The boat advanced with extreme caution .
For five days they worked busily .
`` It is <NAME> , '' said <NAME> .
The temperature fell a little , and the tempest abated .
No living being should ever know .
Again the day appeared and with it the tempest began to moderate .
What enthusiasm in the spectators !
I at last recognized the horrible truth .
The traveller was , therefore , obliged to go alone .
With pale face and eye of fire he strode up to <NAME> .
`` But what you are no longer , brave <NAME> ! ''
Such were the difficulties which <NAME> boldly confronted and prepared to encounter .

At five it crossed the passage of <NAME> at full steam .
This was the only actual discovery of the voyage .
`` What have you to say to that , <NAME> ? ''
Concerning his past nothing was known , but undoubtedly he had been a sailor .
On the 9th June the two vessels left the roads of <NAME> .
<NAME> uttered these words , and then he relapsed into his usual silence .
<NAME> had perfect confidence in his friend , and asked no question .
“ You think that he will recover his senses ? ” asked <NAME> .
“ The sister worthy of the brother ! ” said he .
