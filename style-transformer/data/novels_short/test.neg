He did not delay , and soon the <NAME> reckoned one conquest more .
The emotions of the day had left sad impressions on their minds .
Upon my word , this mountain is a paradise !
Never could I have looked for such an experience !
Nothing could be more rudimentary .
It was “ <NAME> felt , ” and <NAME> possessed yet another manufacture .
It was there that <NAME> had disappeared .
The same ceremonies were observed every time the captain landed .
`` Is that your opinion , <NAME> ? ''
It was impossible to reach the crater of <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> returned to <NAME> in the year 1849 .
The pilot arrived the evening before .
Would the captain put out a boat ?
At first only noisy and very lively , the natives soon became threatening .
And all dressing in haste rushed to the windows , which they opened .
His companions , bending over him , watched the operation with extreme interest .
`` I do not know , '' he replied .
`` Perhaps in <NAME> ; you know the <NAME> is a rapid traveller .
Hence the necessity of dispelling the darkness .
He was much surprised to see a strong current at this place .
They encounter <NAME> in <NAME> ; bushrangers in <NAME> ; and <NAME> in <NAME> .
I repeat that every sign of mutiny had disappeared .
Where were we to come out ?
These words stirred up his comrades .
<NAME> noon the wind freshened , and increased the force of the storm .
`` Poets like <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> ? ''
Still , not a single resort for refuge did the inaccessible shore present .
`` Have you formed any plan , <NAME> ? ''
Having made the tour of the world , he was behind-hand five minutes .
The report was sounded , and the bear rolled over on the ice .
`` But if any one seizes it in our absence ? ''
Dates of an excellent flavour are its most valuable export .
She was evidently not without an object .
<NAME> accepted the traveller 's presents with childish glee .
`` Wonderful instance of subsidence on a grand scale ! ''
The longest of the streets of <NAME> runs parallel to the shore .
Of the liquid surface of the sea there was no longer a glimpse .
This was a question which rendered me very uneasy and uncomfortable .
The engineer , towards whom all eyes were turned , shook his head negatively .
“ What , it was not you ? ” asked <NAME> .
The engineer was right in thinking that the guns were of excellent make .
`` What is it , then , <NAME> ? ''
And what changes might not have occurred in nine days !
The cavern widened here considerably , the sea forming a little lake .
I never was your son !
I can ’ t say. ” “ Why not ?
The detachment went at full trot into the narrow street .
The aeronauts took careful and complete note of the orographic conformation of the country .
The “ superb specimen of a chelonian ” was no longer there !
-- '' That there is no choice between them ! ''
`` To show that I can understand as well as interrupt ! ''
They now resorted to the only remaining expedient .
“ I will go , too , brother , ” said the young girl .
The consequences would have been his death and that of his companions .
The enormous heaps were melting away with majestic slowness .
Suddenly <NAME> , uttering a cry , pointed to the table .
`` The masters of the island ! ''
`` I know , I guess , what this pretended meteor is !
`` In the museum at <NAME> ? ''
This morning <NAME> awoke in very bad humor .
No reasoning could make him believe it .
he asked , touching a commutator .
<NAME> <NAME> is no more a robber than I am a murderer . ''
Thus they were condemned to close imprisonment .
<NAME> Nature forbid approach to the Pole ?
“ It is a fortunate circumstance , ” responded the <NAME> .
`` Certainly you have , <NAME> , '' replied the engineer quickly .
The travellers set to work at once and soon accomplished it .
Then crossing the <NAME> , he arrived at <NAME> on the 21st November .
He must go and wake him .
They also , during this season , made fierce war against the jaguars .
“ <NAME> me again about this Nicholas .
Strangely enough , the temperature was very high -- ten degrees above zero .
`` We shall not be able to reach the neutral point . ''
A week ago I went to ascertain the depth of this shaft .
He came out of the house in which he was hidden .
The tall tufts of gastrolobium were motionless .
They are about fifty in number .
I began to think him particularly lukewarm and unenthusiastic .
Why , madam , the Indians are not anthropophagi !
`` It shall be done , captain , '' answered <NAME> .
that is the perfection of vessels !
“ At a distance there ’ s no great difference , ” remarked <NAME> .
DURING <NAME> FEW days which followed nothing occurred worthy of note .
It could not fly ; it could hardly walk .
My two sailors received me half dead .
48 , would deliver a lecture on Mormonism in car No .
A decided resolution was therefore immediately taken .
for each man , for every degree .
<NAME> had complete command over himself .
Yes , and I had not been dreaming !
At present , the colonists had reason on their side against <NAME> .
The wish of the dying <NAME> was so urgent that resistance became impossible .
All regarded him with profound emotion .
But that is almost as much as can be said for it .
But after scaling the wall of the <NAME> , it did not terrify us .
What had fate in store for these daring adventurers ?
“ At the least , my Lord .
`` And I reply again , '' answered <NAME> .
Two days afterwards we were to start from the <NAME> de la <NAME> .
“ Look , father ! ” <NAME> was not mistaken .
`` Have you no need of my services , sir ? ''
<NAME> replied that he was astonished to see the plains so saturated with water .
The <NAME> went at a rapid pace .
On that day the thermometer fell to three degrees below zero .
An observation had just given 55° 7 ' latitude and 41° 13 ' longitude .
`` Perhaps for the travellers as well ! ''
The two were in incessant communication .
This fearful revelation took them like a stroke of apoplexy .
But it is not enough to have kicked him out .
Its left scuttle was even cracked by a violent shock .
Might there not be rather a malevolent intention to thwart <NAME> ’ s plans ?
At this juncture , thirty of the crew became incapable of performing their duty .
<NAME> and water were easily procurable there .
At midnight the steppe was profoundly dark .
You 're as bad as the rest of us !
A fact indeed ; and it was this counter-current by which the <NAME> profited .
He picked it up and turned it over and over .
It is really a city with straight rows of houses and quite wide streets .
The wind had died away completely with the twilight .
`` A convict vessel is not disciplined like a man-of-war !
It is the only injury the <NAME> has sustained .
And he drew quickly back , gliding like a savage into the thickest underwood .
It was just before we left <NAME> that I came to this decision .
Where should it be celebrated ?
Even the <NAME> would leave its bed and float away into space .
`` You are free , monsieur ; but I shall not go with you .
At the bottom of the ladder was a deck , lighted by electricity .
The officers of the quarter-deck hurried to the after-part of the vessel .
But they found nothing , some curious formations of the rocks having deceived them .
A profound darkness ensued , which favored his flight .
<NAME> <NAME> and his companions ran up to them .
said I , `` it no longer changes its place ? ''
Some were wrestling , others on horseback mixed with the pedestrians .
We shall follow his fortunes hereafter .
`` Not to anybody , '' I protested .
The heath began to show timidly its little pale , rosy flowers .
<NAME> <NAME> ever fall in with this great sheet of water ?
`` There exist several explanations on the subject , M. Aronnax .
The doubt caused me serious uneasiness .
At seven in the evening <NAME> had not returned .
<NAME> had evidently hit upon the only plausible reason of this deviation .
I too much feared the counteraction of disappointment .
In a mystery every one found himself upon the earth again .
And then , you will not escape the spur of the <NAME> .
They had one night in which to prepare for death .
To him I knew this would be the last fatal stroke .
74 degrees 15 minutes and W. long .
A new discovery was made on the 5th of September .
asked M'Nicholl , who was carefully studying the situation .
said <NAME> , moving his jaws significantly .
`` But Mr <NAME> and <NAME> ? ''
On the bed lay the body of a man .
But <NAME> loved it ; the pastime was congenial to his temperament .
<NAME> feeling , you will say .
But the joiners had soon to be replaced by carpenters .
We only thought of the future .
The reporter leaning up in a corner , watched these preparations without saying anything .
too late ! ” But by a superhuman effort he raised himself up .
I could no longer judge of the time that was passing .
A dozen horsemen dashed forward , and the kibitka was surrounded .
We must put ourselves on rations . ''
<NAME> <NAME> in a balloon !
`` Good beast , good beast , '' he would cry .
The second stranger merits a more detailed description .
Did he hesitate to speak ?
<NAME> fastened this to a well-feathered arrow .
`` Lost her tail you mean , '' said <NAME> .
<NAME> saw that he was locking himself in .
<NAME> care to have all our weapons close at hand .
Hence they were not averse to being put into harness .
But think of <NAME> after <NAME> .
<NAME> , more than mist , a thick yellow , mouldy-smelling fog .
`` You will be starved to death , '' she said .
<NAME> was buried with great pomp .
THE <NAME> DAVIS STRAIT .
Your pay will continue as before .
Their labours were now carried on with feverish ardour .
`` We have nothing to do but to go away , '' whispered <NAME> .
Besides , <NAME> would never consent to leave his vessel .
Send your men to the forecastle , sir . ''
<NAME> , all observation , chatted with the pilot and acted as manager .
`` I do n't know , '' he said .
His noble features , paled by the approach of death , were perfectly calm .
But hang me , if I can endure your Algebra ! ''
<NAME> friends , how is that for high ? ''
Their last hope , the vessel , had been shattered to pieces .
`` We should all fall into the sun ! ''
It was therefore lower in temperature than the preceding winter .
It was now seen how advantageous the engineer 's arrangements had been .
A tear glistened in the eyes of the dying man .
`` And where is he now ? ''
Whither are we going , I ask ?
The terrible fall had begun .
“ What did <NAME> do ? ” he repeated .
I felt an insurmountable horror for <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> was overwhelmed by this new complication .
The engineer ’ s thought was at once understood .
For some moments there was silence under that dark and gloomy vault .
The first of my perceptions which returned in full force was that of hearing .
murmured the engineer , leaping first up the ladder .
He was so good to me and my sister .
“ Does not <NAME> please you then ? ” asked <NAME> .
He had besides sworn not to see his mother .
Here , then , was a fresh mystery .
`` I begin to think that very curious things happen in <NAME> ! ''
In that latitude , the degree of longitude represents eight and forty miles .
<NAME> was discovered -- no human being emerged from the opening .
Did he understand that he had made a grave mistake ?
The balloon was raised to an immeasurable height .
People were restless who were never known to be restless before .
“ Ten. ” “ In an hour he may be here .
“ The truth is there ! ” he said .
`` Fear nothing , '' said the unknown .
<NAME> was evidently ebbing slowly , and his extremities were already cold .
But nothing could oppose serious delay to our travellers .
“ I am here , ” replied <NAME> .
The thoughts of each one were about their situation .
Yes , but not for everything !
His hand was lifted in a menacing attitude .
“ What reply do you want from me ? ” said <NAME> quietly .
At night the tempest increased in violence .
As to bottles and tumblers , that was only play .
He is to keep you at <NAME> as if you were his daughter .
Just then <NAME> passed near me .
<NAME> , delighted at having found her again , approached the girl .
This population , however , fluctuates very much according to the season .
A vibration quivered through the atmosphere .
Besides , we all began to get used to this kind of existence .
Now haul in the sounding line .
Eyes and ears could not surely both deceive me .
“ He is a brother that will never forsake us , never !
Yes , perhaps , and also appearances of land towards the south . ''
The time was then propitious for sowing this single precious grain of corn .
I hesitated before giving it .
It was a dead world , such as we see it to-day . ''
I was powerless , almost unconscious .
End of the <NAME> EBook of <NAME> , by <NAME>
<NAME> howling for her breakfast !
If free , would he attempt to fly , or would he remain ?
I am now in his game . ''
Upon its embattled walls floated the national colors of <NAME> .
The <NAME> still wore his uniform .
The hull of the <NAME> was just beginning to issue from the water .
Thus they maintained a profound silence during their journey to the corral .
<NAME> <NAME> made up his mind rapidly .
This was the conclusion at which <NAME> arrived , after mature reflection .
`` What on earth is the matter with us ? ''
replied <NAME> , checking the pulsations of her heart .
`` Why may not there be something plausible in such a hypothesis ? ''
O no , -- its wheels are good !
But this wager totally ruined him .
We may be very near the ocean . ''
returned the really astonished <NAME> , recognising his crony of the <NAME> .
The mystery was about to be unveiled .
The expedition lost sight of land on the 29th of May .
His fate was uncertain until it was discovered by <NAME> .

“ But that is not all , <NAME> .
All this was but a pretext for murders , raids , and pillage .
It would be too small for them , '' replied <NAME> simply .
Would you like to visit one of them , M .
His eyes were fixed on the top of the volcano .
Leaving the children to entertain each other , <NAME> began his address .
Certainly my trouble and agitation would have betrayed me to <NAME> 's eyes .
`` More than two thousand <NAME> leagues , '' exclaimed <NAME> .
The inhabitants were tall and well proportioned , alert , vigorous , and intelligent .
There is nothing more to do here . ''
I detected a restrained irritation in these words .
They had been wise in unloading the <NAME> .
The recollection of this book impressed him .
said I , looking at the leaden sky .
In my present state of excitement and enthusiasm , I was always first .
<NAME> was seized with a desperate rage .
`` But not by a single ship , '' said <NAME> .
<NAME> got up under our feet like birds in the long grass .
Two yards only separated us from the open sea .
Towards five o ’ clock day began to break .
All along this land there are other inhabited islands .
He was now in the latitude of <NAME> -- i.e .
The <NAME> was less than two degrees from the pole .
and 151 degrees 55 minutes E. long .
<NAME> fish and animals seemed to form strange conjunctions .
They left off rowing , lest they should get farther from the ship .
<NAME> indeed was now the joyful enthusiasm on both vessels .
All you had to do to understand the document was to read it backwards .
“ From the recitals of the <NAME> .
The supper was a dull meal , and neither appetizing nor reviving .
Doubtless he wanted to know to what <NAME> was coming .
Then imagine a fall from a height of four thousand miles !
The colonists left the <NAME> .
<NAME> profited by these events to accuse the emperor of perfidy .
He will find his master ! ” “ Who ? ” asked <NAME> .
The three friends looked and listened without speaking , and scarcely breathing .
`` By the bye , M. Aronnax you are not afraid of sharks ? ''
It was a run of eighty miles , and was accomplished in two hours .
Three miles to the south the dim outline of <NAME> was to be seen .
<NAME> computes the number of inhabitants at three millions .
`` Nothing at all , my boy .
Am I right , <NAME> , maestro illustrissimo ? ''
<NAME> made no immediate reply .
This , however , was out of the question .
`` We shall see , stupid beast ! ''
monsoon before reaching the <NAME> , which form the extreme north of the <NAME> .
A perfect concord ruled the little colony .
In vain <NAME> tried to calm <NAME> , whose head seemed on fire .
The <NAME> was no longer moving , the heat was becoming unbearable .
After my fall I lost much blood .
62 degrees 20 minutes and W. long .
356 FEAR , <NAME> ON CLAWBONNY 'S <NAME> , '' <NAME> .
Then they began to act , each one as he thought best .
The only quadrupeds were pigs , dogs , and rats , who multiplied rapidly .
“ To the water ! ” exclaimed <NAME> .
“ Would you like me to try and swim across ? ” said <NAME> .
A rope leads to the ground .
Some unseen and mysterious obstacle intervened and stopped me .
But no pleasant sound of falling water fell upon my listening ear .
Three parts of this day I spent on the platform .
The passage of the <NAME> was thus open to the besiegers .
The nearer we approached the more nearly vertical became its slope .
We must think of the present .
In a picture representing the poulp in question . ''
This reasoning calmed me a little and I began to hope !
Our road grew lighter and lighter .
These last words justified the colonists ’ presentiment .
`` You can go now , M. Aronnax , '' said the <NAME> .
With some imagination and a little artistic feeling the result was highly satisfactory .
The following days brought new discoveries .
cried the sailor , `` this is queer ! ''
The difference evidently depends on the conductibility of certain rocks .
I then thought of quitting my room .
[ Illustration : Captain <NAME> 's chart of <NAME> . ]
“ Will you reply ? ” repeated <NAME> .
The forepart had disappeared completely , and the hind part up to the axle .
`` Do not cry out before you are hurt .
The casting was to take place at twelve o'clock precisely .
“ <NAME> , ” said <NAME> , “ you need not reproach yourself .
“ <NAME> has given me a nosegay and I am quite content .
Beyond it we heard loud bellowings such as a troop of ruminants would produce .
The morning of February 13th arrived .
And <NAME> gave one more despairing cry .
asked the old sailor , who was always seeking information from the doctor .
The departure was fixed for ten in the morning , on the 5th .
Paganel could not stand any more .
“ You may count upon me !
Was the brig about to penetrate far into the bay ?
He tried to make out the words which the poor fellow could not pronounce .
Then their fears suddenly aroused , they disappeared , bounding over the rocks .
365 The Emperor of <NAME> .
<NAME> someone wish to prevent <NAME> from troubling himself either uselessly or otherwise ?
<NAME> maintained it was the parabolic ; M'Nicholl insisted that it was the hyperbolic .
The limits of the horizon , too , had become much circumscribed .
`` How much food have we left ? ''
The wind blew with extraordinary violence .
`` Well , a perfect vacuum as far as air is concerned . ''
In the face of this fact , so much had to be admitted .
The crew did not utter a word .
No ; these vibrations are due to the effervescence of the central fire .
Above us the crater seemed to gape like the mouth of a well .
Here a sad piece of news was awaiting him .
To the northwest rose <NAME> , which concealed a great part of the horizon .
I remember it as if it were yesterday .
`` Meanwhile the <NAME> had been sent to <NAME> for repairs .
Do you say to yourself , ` This prison may be our tomb ? '
His admirable discovery led to many another .
`` And thou art right , <NAME> .
I know where you are <NAME> , and I know where to find you .
Can he leave the island if he likes ?
<NAME> , you are taken ; taken , you are executed .
“ To land here would be a ticklish matter ! ” said the <NAME> .
<NAME> was named captain-general of the squadron , with unlimited powers .
Then settling himself firmly , he listened .
“ <NAME> , my heart is broken ; and sometimes despair nearly masters me .
`` What heat does the thermometer really indicate ? ''
Above her head rustled the white sails , which seemed like great white wings .
This was the signal for renewed cries of still greater intensity .
`` What will you do then ? ''
In a word , the crew had taken courage again .
Perhaps he , the former convict , still felt himself unworthy to do so !
This he could not now delay in doing .
The crew seemed to have returned to their habits of discipline and obedience .
`` The trap-hole alone would take ten or fifteen minutes to open . ''
Notwithstanding this , the examination is carried out , the vein discovered .
TEN minutes afterwards , <NAME> and <NAME> issued from the principal gallery .
“ Ay , sir , a <NAME> , ” said <NAME> .
They descended to the shop .
`` It was just because she was not an honest vessel ! ''
Make a start , like a good fellow . ''
Some of them were four yards and a quarter long .
The pieces which were cut off soon encumbered the hut .
Then <NAME> went up to <NAME> .
This proposal was agreed to , and <NAME> and <NAME> prepared to start immediately .
asked the sailors , turning to <NAME> .
<NAME> can not be far off .
A quarter of an hour later we were far away from that terrible monster !
`` I 've known all my men for a long time . ''
We were turning our backs on <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> gazed on it in silence .
As far as I was concerned , death had claimed me for his own .
Perhaps its springs were left to wear out , its wheels to get clogged .
“ This is what happened , ” he continued .
But I forgot I did n't come alone . ''
<NAME> was the first repast of the castaways on this unknown coast .
With a sigh I discovered that the bottom was still wholly invisible .
They were too surely the first victims of the frenzied natives .
`` Cut away , boatswain , cut away ! ''
<NAME> had no trouble in finding a tree suitable for the mast .
The old myth of the <NAME> realized !
`` After having passed the north pole , '' replied <NAME> .
`` Look here , <NAME> and M'Nicholl ! ''
It was evidently a block without any possible egress .
No , no ; it can not be .
`` We wo n't waste time , '' returned <NAME> .
But the most astounded personage in the town was <NAME> the burgomaster .
Did they mean to say that he had seen nothing at all ?
“ Everything is possible , ” replied <NAME> , who was getting uneasy .
<NAME> could have withstood the tenderness with which <NAME> spoke these last words .
'Well , then , give me some rum . ' ''
The main point is to complete our armament with the least possible delay .
`` But was it not a star ? ''
`` But once more on dry ground , we shall know what to do .
`` The story which he has told is true in every point .
Two hundred houses at the very least !
We caught some young kids , which soon grew quite tame .
Things hanging in the saloon were sensibly returning to their normal position .
You know -- the three turtles that were in the boat .
Who are you dressed up in that way ? ''
The envoy had not reached <NAME> when <NAME> landed at the fort on <NAME> .
Some leagues beyond are the ruins of <NAME> or <NAME> .
They refused to return to <NAME> .
He knew <NAME> and <NAME> quite well .
`` As you will , <NAME> , '' replied <NAME> .
`` But suppose she had run against this piece of iron ? ''
<NAME> <NAME> had taken no notice of her .
“ Delighted. ” “ And so am I .
I did not say one word .
Then another day passed without food .
“ <NAME> to the shore , <NAME> ! ” said <NAME> .
And then anger seized him .
<NAME> clasped his hands , and remained motionless .
This fatal region was only a desert , unfrequented even by animals .
“ Wherever you go I will follow you .
`` It is more than useful , it is necessary !
She was the cause of the disaster !
Would not their track betray them ?
The greater portion of this is laid out in gardens .
and I will show you mine ! ''
“ You are <NAME> ? ” asked <NAME> .
The doctor leaned over and looked out .
I tried to continue the conversation .
Soon hunting for game became more easy and its results more abundant .
This time his companions followed him in the new exploration .
He is going round the world . ''
His attitude was threatening , his countenance ferocious .
The whole region was bristling with spikes and circles .
In what condition was he going to find it ?
By what geological phenomena could this blazing coma have been possibly produced ?
As he spoke thus , <NAME> appeared superb in his vanity .
`` But , my good sir -- '' `` I tell you to come .
Top wore a necklace of teal and <NAME> wreaths of snipe round his body .
<NAME> for me , in my name only , if you like . ''
to 147 degrees 15 minutes E .
The same phrase was pronounced by the same individual .
Having described my uncle , I will now give an account of our interview .
I passed the evening reading , writing , and thinking .
And yet he was prepared to go still further in disinterestedness .
The death of the great usurper was followed by the decadence of the empire .
It is His own secret that <NAME> will tell us !
In a few minutes the engineer was made acquainted with the state of affairs .
shouted <NAME> ; `` there 's something wrong .
“ I think I should ! ” replied the young man .
[ Illustration : `` <NAME> fell , and was killed ! '' ]
`` Just one degree and a half above zero , <NAME> ! ''
The crew was exceedingly demoralized .
He was horrified , for on the evening before he could still stand upright .
Did escape occur to him ?
It is needless to say that <NAME> and <NAME> were happy .
Game was so scarce that for four days the explorers were without food .
Then an irresistible drowsiness crept over their brain .
He was everywhere received with cordial congratulations from officers , soldiers , and citizens .
<NAME> <NAME> and the <NAME> cook had quite surpassed themselves .
And she would certainly have fallen had not <NAME> ’ s arm supported her .
From a <NAME> print engraved by <NAME> , vol .
<NAME> was still following him .
<NAME> sank prostrate on the ground , and clasped his hands despairingly .
“ My master is lost ! ” cried <NAME> .
<NAME> struggled with his father .
I was perfectly up in the subject which was the question of the day .
There I should meet him for the last time .
112 A Fa-toka , <NAME> .
Pretty time to tell us so !
To fly is , therefore , the course to be suggested by ordinary prudence .
<NAME> again began to hope .
urged <NAME> , who was much disturbed by the servant 's disappearance .
`` But we must have a mill . ''
He could do nothing for them .
[ Illustration : `` Good-bye , <NAME> , '' said <NAME> . ]
Where was he at this moment ?
Across these openings were thrown bridges which could be easily destroyed .
Its fragments , placed carefully against a wall , might serve again upon occasion .
Then <NAME> seemed to grow enormously , his features to assume superhuman proportions .
Important operations were now entrusted to him .
We will now briefly describe the pompous entry of the <NAME> mission into <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> ’ s deep dejection was in strange contrast to his general hilarity .
Once arrived in that country , circumstances must determine his future course .
Our march had not been interrupted by this incident .
Their hair is black and woolly , curly , but not thick .
But no explosion , properly so termed , could be heard .
She will not doubt me for an instant !
`` Thirty-seven minutes six seconds past ten . ''
`` Has he got on the track of some animal ? ''
<NAME> was the wonderful structure which was going down the <NAME> .
<NAME> mists passed like clouds close to the ground .
`` And I answer in the negative , '' continued <NAME> .
The country was evidently habitable and inhabited .
<NAME> had its drawbacks , but it had some compensating advantages .
His attitude and mien were that of a man utterly stupefied .
There they found an empty house , the door wide open .
I became alarmed , and determined to discover what were our resources .
Avoiding <NAME> , whose inhabitants are fanatics and thieves , <NAME> entered <NAME> .
`` Then , M. Aronnax , I propose a curious excursion . ''
<NAME> , overcoming her repugnance , looked at all these corpses !
it was he who threw us the ladder ! ''
`` But that is the top of the volcano ! ''
In an instant we were by his side .
That makes twenty-five days of journeying .
`` Is the steam full on ? ''
<NAME> evening , <NAME> had his turn of delirium .
They have been observed in all the level portion of the <NAME> 's surface .
They felt an undefinable dread of the abyss !
In short , they had a supply for six weeks , and powder enough .
<NAME> looked over and greedily read the work as it proceeded .
there is the gulf of <NAME> !
Three of our men had perished , and in what frightful fashion !
But how the conditions under which they traveled were altered !
Though not very large , it appeared not likely to be filled for centuries .
At ten the moon will not be risen .
The first volley so astonished them that they remained motionless .
He had never thought of his proposal being met with any objection .
What _had_ switched them off ?
There was no longer any doubt as to the pirates ’ intentions .
The traveller was not to be deceived .
`` Do n't you know that the sea turned it over ? ''
The captain concluded the narrative of his life .
I appeal to your sagacity .
`` Are those from <NAME> of any interest ? ''
In 1504 and 1505 four vessels explored the Gulf of <NAME> .
It would be difficult to imagine a collection of greater ruffians .
Had not <NAME> seen the Projectile ?
It was a work of the higher mechanics , appreciable only by mathematicians .
One hour more , and the point of equal attraction would be reached .
There seems a <NAME> .
`` How have we forgotten them ? ''
`` Not more , captain , '' replied <NAME> .
At that moment the doctor and <NAME> came up to <NAME> .
Neither the accustomed bleating of the sheep nor <NAME> 's voice could be heard .
Thus perished the illustrious <NAME> on the 27th of April , 1521 .
`` To know what is going on in <NAME> . ''
`` We will begin our researches as soon as possible .
This occupied them until February 15th .
The danger lies there , and a terrible danger ! ''
Was he bent on a voyage of discovery ?
The flashes dazzled and almost blinded them .
asked <NAME> , trying to keep cool .
This Macartney rightly interpreted as his _congé_ !
It was a glorious night .
`` Yes , we will save him ! ''

In a few moments this prayer would ascend to the feet of the <NAME> .
The ice masses had just `` weighed anchor , '' as the sailors say .
Neither <NAME> nor <NAME> cared to attend .
The cart was waiting on the beach before the <NAME> .
But hope urged him onward .
But habit was too strong for him !
The cocoa-nuts from which it received its name were procured with difficulty .
`` Three cheers for the <NAME> ! ''
The <NAME> offered a retreat sufficient for the present .
But others found it after <NAME> , and others will find it again . ''
“ <NAME> ? ” asked the chief of the police .

The spectacle spread out before us was alike grand and terrible .
<NAME> had followed me for the last ten years wherever science led .
`` Not with you , <NAME> , '' was her answer .
<NAME> folded his arms stoically , and said not a word .
<NAME> had a great desire to play on it .
Many others succumbed , and twelve only returned from the expedition .
`` Why , do you think -- '' `` Why not ?
They would not start , therefore , until the morning of the 27th .

Even <NAME> would have surprised him by an exhibition of such stoicism .
Let us hold ourselves ready .
As soon as he had collected the needful troops , he marched towards <NAME> .
He looked like a man equally prepared to enjoy superfluity or total want .
Has he ever understood that my gratitude to him is overflowing ?
`` Look sharp also after our recruits , '' added the captain .
Was he engaged in a struggle with some animal whose retreat he had disturbed ?
the doctor said to him .

The <NAME> carries provisions for five or six years , and coal in proportion .
His companions uttered a shout .
Two years and a half were spent in this manner .
Several times ten or twelve united tried to crush the Nautilus by their weight .
Matters remained thus until the third week of February .

It was then the favourable season for attempting explorations in the <NAME> .
`` Do you know any who belong to the latter category ? ''
`` What do you intend to do ? ''

The inhabitants of <NAME> would not have taken them there at any price .
`` They would have roasted , '' said the doctor , laughing .
They tarried a moment , then resumed their descent .

They call their country <NAME> , and themselves the Irons .
The news was received with very different feelings by <NAME> and <NAME> .

“ That was an attack for you ! ” said <NAME> .
“ Oh ! ” ejaculated the astonished friends .
And so Mrs. <NAME> had access to the gaol .
Ought they not to fly to the help of <NAME> and <NAME> ?
Beyond the houses on the bank were in a blaze .
What human being would ever have conceived the idea of such a journey ?
<NAME> <NAME> 's wardrobe was amply supplied and in the best taste .

Unfortunately , they were not only to be found on land .
In a word , the <NAME> had to own their powerlessness .
`` He looks as if he was just going to grin ! ''
`` Can not you say whether you have slept well or not ? ''
`` They have been gone ten days , '' said <NAME> at last .
His first act was to vigorously wring the hand which <NAME> extended to him .

There was no doubt about it !
`` And all my limbs are sound and capable of new exertion ? ''
`` Ah , it 's you , is it , monsieur ? ''
An oath burst from the latter , whose features contracted .
They wished to put some further questions to him .
`` Still burning , and has been for the last three weeks . ''
How much blood had it not cost ?
The calculations of the Professor were perfectly correct .
<NAME> <NAME> was baffled by mother and son .
<NAME> is a universal practice .
We must see where we go .

This proceeding , as it turned out , might have cost him dear .
The noise was enough to terrify even the boldest of wild beasts .

Let us keep our minds free from every other consideration .
No one now spoke , even in a low voice .
He much feared that his anticipations would again be disappointed .
`` Much obliged ; it is all very clear , no doubt . ''
But for <NAME> this danger is not to be feared .
It is a question of time .
`` Are these cetaceans as large as those of the northern seas ? ''

Some moments after his continued bass supported the captain 's baritone .
<NAME> <NAME> went hurriedly up to the Major .
I can then judge whether or not <NAME> diverges from the straight line . ''
Since that time to our days the <NAME> work has been suspended .
The two bodies lay stretched side by side .

They were ingots of gold .
exclaimed <NAME> , falling into a chair .
`` Friend <NAME> , you say we 're moving ? ''
`` I myself have some pretensions to playing a good game .
Besides , the men always slept with one eye open .
There was so much uncertainty in their enterprise !
Another minute and the boat was ready .
It was nine o'clock in the morning when we were quite ready .
This great mass seemed to hold itself in equilibrium .
I felt ready to choke .
There can be no doubt about the matter . ''
<NAME> <NAME> did not return .
To this question there could be no answer .

“ Will you tell me where <NAME> is ? ” asked <NAME> .

At midnight , grandly illuminated , it would shine with the greatest glory .
The <NAME> and the negroes ran into their huts and cabins .
No incident marked the voyage to <NAME> .
The worthy Professor never spoke a word .
We are still going up . ''
<NAME> not the raft progressing with the most marvelous rapidity ?
`` But since the half-breed 's revelations about <NAME> -- '' `` Ah !
