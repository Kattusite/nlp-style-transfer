‘ Ma ’ am ! ’ said Mr <NAME> , in great astonishment .
‘ Not on any account , ’ said the visitor , hurriedly .
<NAME> was drawn with him .
Only her father and <NAME> were with her .
‘ <NAME> and <NAME> , ’ repeated his father .
What ’ s a fellow-man without honour !
I understand yours , ’ peeping down into his face .
Why does he look at <NAME> ?
This desk is your rock , sir ! ''
He left me , and I stood at the dark window watching the street .
`` My dear child , I intend to .
I positively say I can not do it .
Good-bye , <NAME> Parent ! ” in a cheery shout .
We found her , in her spectacles , sitting by the fire .
He is in the law and not much at home . ''
That 's about what YOU are , you know , ai n't you ? ''
‘ <NAME> and look in , <NAME> ! ’ said <NAME> to Mr Boffin .
‘ <NAME> ’ t I tell you it ’ s all right ?
Yes , yes , yes ! ’ slowly vanished from them into the mist .
Anything more about our friends in <NAME> ’ s Court ?
It 's more of a selfish reason .
You must see my daughters .
Be sure o ’ that , ma ’ am .
He looked astonished , but said not a word .
His mind was so exactly regulated , that he had no affections or passions .
‘ Understand me , my dear ; ’ thus she went on .
He loved the child as though she were his own .
I am very dear to him , and he is very dear to me .
See how they hang their heads , and droop , and wither .
Every thing in its perspective led to her innocent figure .
Can ’ t be buyer and seller too .
They came upon her more and more strongly yet .
‘ Your invitation , ’ returned Mr Feeder .
‘ And above all things mind this , <NAME> !
The harp had not been used for many and many a day .
She is an edge-tool , and requires great care in dealing with .
But they 're a wild lot in general , sir .
It 's not in my department , that ai n't . '
It must be now , or never , for I shall not return here .
I finished a large mourning order the day before yesterday .
You know what I am , my dear Mortimer .
' I do , indeed , ' answered <NAME> .
These encomiums bring them to <NAME> and to <NAME> 's house .
‘ I seem to want my right hand , when I miss you .
`` I had youth and hope .
I hope you didn ’ t take any cold .
Then there was Mrs. Jellyby .
‘ I will , if you will .
He had never quite recovered the separation from <NAME> .
`` Oh , <NAME> dear , never forget who did all this ! ''
'Monks would never learn how you knew what you do ? '
His attention then began to flag , and I commenced playing with him .
I never , to my knowledge , had the pleasure of seeing <NAME> .
that doesn ’ t matter at all , ’ replied <NAME> .
What do you see in it ?
'Just so , ' rejoined the other , nodding his head .
‘ As well be reproachful as wholly unreasonable .
My dear child , what distresses you ? '
Ask the little old lady there ; she has been always present .
With these words they disappeared down the stairs .
<NAME> , what was there to dismiss !
It ’ s almost time to hear Mr Pancks .
'It was a knock , ' said <NAME> , assuming perfect serenity .
‘ Not so well , ’ replied <NAME> .
‘ Did you call ? ’ he said .
Then I turned , and walked back towards <NAME> .
‘ I never knew anything happen so cross , ’ exclaimed the young lady .
What follows has another ( and I hope more disinterested ) purpose .
‘ Our <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
She was agitated , and told some money into his hand .
Will you please to enter the carriage ? '
She adorned and graced it so that it became another place .
“ Little more than skin and bone ! ” mused <NAME> , aloud .
'Would you like to see the pawnbroker himself ? '
<NAME> and <NAME> were already there , and sitting side by side .
I was not dispirited now .
‘ Why , I ’ ve been thinking of it , <NAME> .
Quite a coincidence , ’ said Mr Merdle .
‘ Why didn ’ t yer niver say so ?
' I 'll tell you what , <NAME> , ' returned his lady .
Perhaps you guess the person .
“ Not if to lift this glass would do it !
`` Good night , '' I said , `` Good-bye . ''
These words , in plain <NAME> , conveyed an injunction to ring the bell .
‘ <NAME> ’ t cry any more , ’ whispered <NAME> .
Let me have that to think of .
I said I was delighted to propose his health .
‘ I will not deprive you of them .
You have changed your manner to me , dear Mama .
`` I should n't wonder if we found a ginger-bread soldier downstairs .
What she did , I can do .
Let it remain upon that understanding .
<NAME> never said so. ’ ‘ I beg your pardon .
‘ Yes , please sir , ’ replied the little boy .
Why , I am ashamed of you !
<NAME> , we are pressed. ” “ One word , ” the <NAME> entreated .
Answer me one thing , if you can .
‘ There , there , there , <NAME> , all right my dear .
`` Then you can not be too discreet . ''
He claims the name of friend .
But <NAME> , what a child you were !
Will you once ? ’ <NAME> was immovable .
'Ten shillings too much , ' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat .
The italics in these extracts , as in the foregoing , are my own .
Not to stop there , ' replied the Jew .
He fell back upon his pillow and moaned aloud .
Do not report so ill of me , for THAT I could not bear .
To me , <NAME> ! ’ said <NAME> , looking up in astonishment .
gasps <NAME> , looking about him , breathless , from an arm-chair .
Are you tired , Nelly ? ’ ‘ No , sir .
In this exciting occupation , the morning lagged heavily on .
`` If I had the energy I once possessed , <NAME> ! ''
Respected solicitor , it ’ s not that .
<NAME> 's Narrative We came home from <NAME> 's after six pleasant weeks .
I should be very miserable and unhappy if anybody was to go .
<NAME> , wolf ! ” “ Yes , ” I answered .
I roamed from place to place , carrying my burden with me everywhere .
‘ And his beautiful wife is a star , ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> of <NAME> 26 .
That all the boys were at their several homes .
Not quite so bad as that .
‘ I won ’ t take ‘ em , ’ said <NAME> .
The wind was blowing drearily .
`` Gentleman so kind as to act as my solicitor , '' says <NAME> .
I have tracked you through it all , and I tell it you all .
Whenever we part with friends , Mr <NAME> , let us part liberally .
Mr <NAME> was not sure of that .
I hope you will be wiser than that , in a few days .
<NAME> <NAME> , as usual , was not forgotten .
‘ Where am I ? ’ asks Mr Wegg .
Robbed in an extraordinary manner .
Travelling was in a troubled state , and the minds of coachmen were unsettled .
<NAME> ’ t go on like this , if you please .
‘ Dropped , sir , as if she was shot when I told her !
Seventy-six thousand bags of money !
‘ Good gracious , <NAME> ! ’ returned <NAME> ‘ How very monstrous !
‘ <NAME> , <NAME> ! ’ interrupted <NAME> .
‘ We know it ’ s there ! ’ said <NAME> , glaring .
'Oh , Mrs. Corney , what an Angel you are ! '
Your wife have left me since some minutes .
Then <NAME> blushingly asked me how did I know that , my dear .
'And <NAME> is a heavy swell ; a n't he , <NAME> ? '
I have never been quit of you since I first saw you .
“ Where could you wait for me ? ” asked <NAME> .
The ground was measured , and preliminaries arranged .
Why the deuce can ’ t they come together !
I do not think so , and have shown that too .
'Yer doubtful of her , are yer ? '
He was as ill at ease as a gentleman well could be .
<NAME> to your employer ’ s business and your own .
Oh , my husband and father , break this long silence .
‘ I hope so , ’ returned the Secretary .
You shall read 'em to me , dear boy !
She was sure of that .
They were attended by young gentlemen of the same age .
‘ Let ’ s have some more , ’ said Mr Boffin , hungrily .
Up <NAME> went , not caring a button for that .
What delusion can this be ?
‘ You thought you were a widow , eh ?
cried the boy with a burst of tears .
<NAME> himself had come of age eight months before me .
'Think , dear <NAME> , think what you have heard to-night . '
Always gay ! ’ After which he knocked again .
The place had a soothing influence on him .
‘ <NAME> , <NAME> , ’ said Mr Toots .
‘ What did you take it for , then ? ’ inquired the cabman .
‘ The cloud is past from my mind .
‘ <NAME> ! ’ replied the <NAME> .
It ’ s well for you to joke about the poor !
A moment , and it was gone .
These are <NAME> and <NAME> .
said <NAME> with a humorous leer .
‘ How have you lived ? ’ ‘ By begging , my deary .
<NAME> whatever. ’ Mr <NAME> gave his reasons for the inquiry .
<NAME> , dead and gone , was my brother-in-law .
‘ How do you do , <NAME> ? ’ said Mrs. Kenwigs .
‘ Come in ! ’ cried the little man .
I went among young women next , and I found them no better .
I knew that , did I ? ''
It had nearly winged its flight away .
There was a little muslin curtain drawn across it .
`` Whether it is at all like that , sir .
They inquired was he too tall ?
You are going to her , I hope ?
<NAME> never was complimented with a finer pair .
‘ It ’ s the only thing for a proud stomach .
<NAME> , only for a moment .
In short , the less you <NAME> , the better , you know . ''
“ May I ask the name ? ” I said .
Then <NAME> , imperious , inflexible , and silent , never looked at her .
<NAME> is the power of demeanour and knowledge of mankind .
Mortimer <NAME> was soon gone .
They are all on their own level .
<NAME> , that will is dated months before this will .
The horror that is upon her is unutterable .
I leave <NAME> to-night .
Then you want to know what the terms are .
Had n't you better say two fifty ? ''
I can ’ t bear you , ’ replied his wife .
These stumps of trees are a curious feature in <NAME> travelling .
‘ I give him money , <NAME> ! ’ returned <NAME> .
Mrs. <NAME> burst into a flood of tears .
'No , he do n't , ' sneered <NAME> .
I want to have some talk with you , particularly , and in private .
Towards evening , strange boy calls .
`` <NAME> , <NAME> , '' said I , `` come away ! ''
said <NAME> , looking slowly round from the wail .
Go and see <NAME> acted .
I am heartily glad to see you .
‘ It is easy to talk and sneer .
‘ <NAME> wages , perhaps , <NAME> ? ’ said <NAME> .
`` Do you rub your legs to rub life into 'em ? ''
returns <NAME> with right good will .
At last he thought of the closet , and walked up to it .
‘ No. ’ ‘ Then I ’ ll tell you .
There I was comfortable , and not afraid of being myself .
“ Repression is the only lasting philosophy .
This made me think , did <NAME> 's face accidentally resemble my godmother 's ?
<NAME> <NAME> turned suddenly pale .
She shone in the miserable corner like a beautiful star .
Little Eyes casts about how best to pay you off .
I had my hands more full than ever , now .
‘ Anything old , I think you mean , ’ growls <NAME> .
He was my true son . ''
The great suit , <NAME> , '' returned his lodger .
‘ Pickwick -- <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> ; ‘ come up here .
I said just now , what good could come of it ?
‘ You had better do it at once .
“ It could not be otherwise , ” said the prisoner .
But he clasped him tight , and dragged him beneath the water .
‘ Dear me , no , ’ replied the M.C .
It seemed to me that we continued thus for a long time .
When she reached the house , she gave another proof of her identity .
This took place twenty mile from town .
A very pleasant routine , with perhaps a slight tinge of sameness .
You 'll excuse me , but I know better than you .
‘ <NAME> well , <NAME> , thank you , ’ <NAME> would answer .
I couldn ’ t bear it , and I wouldn ’ t .
The house kept itself , and we kept a page .
<NAME> is cheap , and <NAME> liked it .
`` I did n't know I was crying , sir , '' I faltered .
I thought I would give up that point too .
Only a moment was given him for consideration .
This proposition , like the other , was received with unanimous applause .
And a pretty creature too , ’ said <NAME> .
I shall always think so , as long as I live .
I replied that I remembered to have seen him once before .
'Suppose that lad that 's laying there -- ' <NAME> began .
You know that well enough , I daresay .
<NAME> and <NAME> were unquestionably tall .
Then why not go at first instead of at last ?
I am not fit to be pitted against you to-night .
cried <NAME> , very much startled by the idea of my doing so .
It was a hard parting , though it was not for long .
'Are you going to <NAME> ? '
I know you ’ re a treasure to your master , <NAME> .
She handed it over to her son .
I will never leave you ; nothing but death shall part us .
‘ Surely you did not hear them ! ’ she said bashfully .
It was his pet weakness , and he cherished it .
`` That 's the crowning point of unreason in the business !
And seemed to turn thoughtful and a little troubled .
Sometimes there is joking and a general roar .
They will accrue at that season. ’ Blurring pencil once again .
In the meantime his prospects in life are ended .
<NAME> is one of them , ’ said my aunt .
But the trooper fails to fasten the brooch .
‘ Not a bit on it , ’ replied his father .
I understand you to be now consulting me professionally as to your interests ?
The dog was very important .
‘ I had a visit from <NAME> to-day , <NAME> .
You shall see my gardens hereabout .
It was not his weakness that he had imagined .
I rather thought I would give up that point too .
Oh , why are they not driving on !
I am glad to see you . ''
He has gone to the demnition bow-wows .
The <NAME> stood among the graves , and pointed down to One .
retorted <NAME> ; ' I know better .
`` Rather so , indeed , sir , '' responds <NAME> .
Well then , you may tell her if she can keep a secret .
Mrs. Bagnet is not at all an ill-looking woman .
For , Mr Flintwinch awake , was watching Mr Flintwinch asleep .
“ But I must say more .
‘ I am not going abroad again .
‘ No linen that you want sent to the washerwoman ’ s ?
I listened in silence and looked attentively at him .
By and by we went to church .
‘ Now , <NAME> ! ’ said <NAME> , looking back .
I read what follows : I came to the cottage with two objects .
said <NAME> , a little consoled .
“ Know him ! ” repeated the landlord .
<NAME> , bah , old intriguer , crooked little puppet !
I wish you well , and I shall ever wish you well .
The foresight and affection of the dear !
“ Have you though ? ” said <NAME> .
He was in everything good , from banking to building .
‘ We shall be down directly , sir , ’ replied <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> ’ ee , my dear , ’ said <NAME> , senior .
The master was a fat , healthy man ; but he turned very pale .
said the elder , when I went in .
‘ Very unpromising , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Why no , <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> , rubbing his chin .
Then <NAME> was in her glory .
Begin by thinking well of me , ’ said the beautiful lady .
‘ Oh Lord bless me ! ’ said Mr Dombey , rising testily .
No , it must be sought within the confines of domestic bliss .
Mr <NAME> , on this occasion , pray face me .
I wondered whether I had better tell her my history .
And <NAME> poked the fire with a flourish .
`` It has given me pain , <NAME> , '' <NAME> weightily proceeded .
Naturally he would n't , under those contagious circumstances .
He could neither make it out , nor trouble himself long with the effort .
I ’ ll call <NAME> at six .
`` There is nothing <NAME> wants so much as a friend .
‘ Oh dear , no , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ There ’ s a gate here , ’ replied old <NAME> .
All was still and silent .
`` <NAME> told me of her .
Now don ’ t it ? ’ <NAME> said she didn ’ t know .
Can we fly , my friends ?
‘ Shall we have our supper , <NAME> dear ? ’ ‘ Ah !
In every rage of wind and rush of rain , I heard pursuers .
You know you are glad .
The confidence is not of my seeking , recollect .
I hope you were not inconvenienced by swallowing too much water .
He is not likely to forget his obligations to the cause of all this .
Indeed , you showed me his card .
They waited some time , but nobody came .
“ I do n't recommend him , observe ; because I never recommend anybody .
‘ I also ! ’ said the traveller .
She used to keep bank-notes there , ‘ fore she vos married , <NAME> .
The figure removes the right-hand glove and shows the hand .
‘ I appear for the defendant , my Lord , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ “ My hunting train , ma ’ am , ” said the baron .
Her fond father could not see her pine and droop .
I may render the same tribute , I am sure , to <NAME> .
<NAME> , you will perceive , sir -- <NAME> is my name .
`` I have nothing to say to you , '' rejoins <NAME> .
<NAME> is away next day , and all the cousins are scattered before dinner .
‘ Did you speak , sir ? ’ said <NAME> .
‘ I am off the <NAME> , Mr Clennam , and going out .
My uncle burned with indignation , gentlemen .
‘ Shout with the largest , ’ replied <NAME> .
‘ Oh dear , no , <NAME> ! ’ returned <NAME> .
‘ Two Kits ? ’ said <NAME> smiling .
‘ <NAME> , my birds ! ’ the pretty child repeated .
'How do you propose to deal with the case , sir ? '
Judy the twin is worthy company for these associates .
They must be gone to bed now .
You made your own snares .
I ca n't afford to it .
One needed youth and strength to bear it .
But <NAME> declares with much earnestness that he `` ca n't stand it . ''
`` With pleasure , my dear <NAME> , '' she was careful to explain .
Have I stolen any of the property ?
I hope he found some consolation in walls .
“ Come ! ” said the stranger , “ I 'll help you .
‘ You were not ? ’ said <NAME> .
I have done with my sister as well as with you .
‘ If you had only seen his looks and smiles !
That was her picture up in the corner .
He paused , and laid down his fork .
‘ Come in ! ’ cried the dwarf .
‘ Shortly after that , ’ replied the old man .
You goes out of his way this present night .
<NAME> knows it better than you do , poor fellow ! ''
It was a double house , with long , narrow , heavily-framed windows .
<NAME> <NAME> , stopping to bite her thread , looked at him very knowingly .
' I have not done this for money .
There was something fearful in the reality of it .
‘ He has had punch already , has he not , sir ?
<NAME> said no , too , and looked uneasy .
'Why are we brought here to answer to such nonsense as this ? '
But he looked handsomer than I had seen him look for many a day .
‘ Be seated. ’ Mr <NAME> became seated .
<NAME> before I looked upon her , the help had come .
Which this to you the true friend say .
He felt that he was not as open in his own dealing .
Yes , my compatriots , happily cast him out and sent him forth !
But I kept my own counsel , and I did my work .
<NAME> resolved , at last , to speak to <NAME> .
and becomes quite energetic about it .
She was happy and useful , was prospering as she had hoped .
‘ Humph ! ’ You had better come in here , <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , in a commanding tone .
There were five young Gradgrinds , and they were models every one .
‘ You mean to dance ? ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Where is <NAME> ? ’ said <NAME> to the servant .
I can scarcely bear to think of it even now .
'Hold your tongue , will you ? '
The old dear look , all love , all fondness , all affection .
I can have you under close inspection without that .
<NAME> is the defendant in <NAME> and <NAME> , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
“ I fear you are not well , <NAME> ! ” “ No .
When the boy knows this out of book , he goes and does it .
whispered the young man ; 'why did you not write before ? '
<NAME> had n't any more to do with it than I had . '
‘ You must have patience , <NAME> , ’ said she .
Smike , as he WILL be called , poor fellow !
‘ You have heard the “ counting-house ” mentioned sometimes , ’ said <NAME> .
“ Who let you in ? ” said he .
He sunk into a chair , and moved but once all that night .
'Number and date taken , I suppose ?
Her department appears to be , to clean everything over and over again .
I can ’ t keep it back .
I fell asleep in her arms , after that , and slept soundly .
She loves you very much .
He understands the catechism of his trade . '
<NAME> <NAME> gave my arm a squeeze and me a very significant look .
There were electors on horseback and electors afoot .
I will never see or know you more .
There was the dreadful shadow , pausing at the bottom of the steps .
‘ Mr Boffin , consider it done .
The trooper gasps as if he would admit it all if he could speak .
`` I am mistaken , I dare say . ''
‘ Are you sure of that ?
We are really spinning along .
‘ Tell the gentleman , ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> spoke with the same shade crossing his face as before .
You have to ask a favour !
They had now come up .
‘ You don ’ t know what she has said to us .
<NAME> was the last time .
‘ <NAME> , ’ said Mrs. <NAME> again .
He said what he had to say manfully and well .
( <NAME> was <NAME> ’ s mortal name . )
All this time her eyes never once release him .
‘ What an impudent thing that cook is ! ’ said the thirty boarders .
Her breath was faint and hurried .
<NAME> <NAME> received the answer with favour .
`` You ca n't be too well , my dear friend . ''
This is that written paper .
and such facetiousness as was displayed by the married ladies !
But my aunt wouldn ’ t hear of it .
`` You are such good company . ''
He said he wished to see you , sir .
What a start that was !
It ’ s HER age I speak of .
Do n't tell stories , <NAME> . ''
‘ He mustn ’ t go , ’ he cried .
‘ Why should I not , <NAME> ? ’ said Mr Dombey .
Now , stop , and so far think it out , <NAME> .
But the household troops , though considered fine men , are built so straggling .
I was useful to him , and he was useful to me .
<NAME> <NAME> 's eyes were again attracted to his face .
says <NAME> , soothing him .
I have brought one of them with me .
<NAME> ! ’ with a heavy sigh .
Let us shut him up .
Next day I set myself to get the boat .
What shall I do without you !
And we seldom have a child there .
Produced by <NAME> , and <NAME> By <NAME> 1 .
But less and less often as the months went on .
There were you , respected and esteemed .
You wo n't cool yourself so easily ; do n't think it ! '
At length the hour of shutting up the counting-house arrived .
‘ <NAME> was such cards , ’ said the fat gentleman .
‘ I ’ ll drag him from it , ’ cried <NAME> .
That ’ s human , ’ said my aunt .
Consider , <NAME> , how many appropriate characters are open for your selection .
I am like one who died young .
‘ <NAME> ’ t play the tune of the trade , Mr Riah .
‘ What are you doing with the child ? ’ she said to <NAME> .
Who could have thought of seeing you !
‘ And a very good way it is , too , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Peggotty ! ’ repeated <NAME> , with some indignation .
It was a take in .
And <NAME> ’ s here. ’ ‘ Indeed ! ’ cried I .
'Did n't know , you white-livered thief ! '
At half-past five , remember , <NAME> !
<NAME> was the reward , and <NAME> must be won .
A contented spirit , Mr <NAME> , is the sweetness of existence .
For <NAME> wore her black frock yet .
Do you imagine I am in my second childhood ?
`` Of course you have not .
‘ <NAME> ! ’ cried <NAME> joyfully ‘ Ah !
So it lies , long years , in its hiding-place .
They sat , listening , and afraid to speak , for hours .
The jury returned , and passed him close .
Sikes pouring out a glass of brandy , bade the Jew drink it off .
<NAME> <NAME> , thanking him , casts an eye about .
I shouldn ’ t have thought it could have been half the size .
`` Well , and you never heard any harm of it ! ''
So let ’ s have another kiss on it , my dear .
He had acquired mechanically a great store of teacher ’ s knowledge .
<NAME> <NAME> sits , facing round , on a stool at the desk .
<NAME> , then , the pang in his heart ?
‘ Bearer waits. ’ ‘ True , ’ replied old Arthur .
And how goes the wooden Midshipman in these changed days ?
You were stricken with astonishment when you saw me at your door just now .
<NAME> Mr <NAME> hardly felt that she had any reason of complaint .
`` Why did you get married ? ''
‘ <NAME> , <NAME> , has high qualities .
To throw the murder on her ladyship . ''
‘ Look out for a fall , my <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Poor dear ! ’ said Mrs. Cluppins .
Perhaps it ’ s part of the philosophy of dreams that one never does .
Having arrived at this conclusion , he betook himself to the tap .
Why are we not more natural ?
said the old man , laying aside the chalk .
In the note I wrote to <NAME> , I bitterly quoted this sentiment .
I take my allowance and my certain weight of coals .
Mr <NAME> , <NAME> , is fortunate enough to have your friendship .
YOU know better than that , at all events .
I am happy in the sight of you .
I -- ha hum -- I gave my family a position there .
He could descry objects enough at such times , but none correctly .
'The gold I stole was -- ' 'Yes , yes -- what ? '
‘ <NAME> pounds a year , ’ replied <NAME> .
Since then , darling , I have seen them often .
In the silence of the night , too ! '
‘ It would come dearer , ’ Mr <NAME> returned .
‘ If they all go to bed , why I must go .
`` Without any clue to anything more ? ''
He looked robust in body .
My <NAME> was too high for me ; I was too high for her .
‘ You ’ re quite right , sir , quite right .
<NAME> happened , however , worse than morning .
<NAME> was recommended to me by a professional friend .
I can think of nothing .
His whole existence was a scuffle .
But somehow she wants heart .
I assure you I have no idea what foundation for it there may be .
‘ No , no , no , ’ said <NAME> ‘ How can you !
‘ Winter came , and with it weeks of cold and heavy rain .
I want you for that . ''
'Man or woman , pray , sir ? '
You 'll get nothing. ” “ No indeed , <NAME> .
What does my brother mean to do ?
<NAME> have done ; but did not .
returned <NAME> with his gay laugh .
`` Thank you , miss , '' said <NAME> .
`` I can attest your fidelity , sir . ''
What are you doing there ? ''
He had been so different , <NAME> .
'What business is it of yours ? '
Why , damme , now , the girls 's whining again ! '
They jump and start , as I cough and cough , like live things .
I waltz with the eldest Miss Larkins !
‘ Would you give <NAME> B. the go-by , <NAME> ’ am ?
But , keep in the way .
‘ Meaning <NAME> , sir ? ’ said the literary gentleman .
inquired my guardian , rubbing his head , a little at a loss .
I am perfectly aware of that .
I stopped that though -- ha ha ha !
“ I play my Ace , <NAME> of <NAME> to the nearest <NAME> .
<NAME> followed the old man downstairs , with a candle .
But I encouraged <NAME> at the time .
The waters are out in <NAME> .
She dressed them now , still without showing her .
Mathematics ? ’ ‘ I never heerd it called that .
Declines to explain further , though much pressed .
I saw a man examined as a witness in Westminster Hall .
You know what her consideration for others is .
But I do n't mind them. ” “ See !
‘ I have been here once before , to-day , <NAME> .
`` <NAME> lost both her parents ? ''
You do me justice , I assure you .
‘ Oh , she ’ s gone away , ’ said the old gentleman .
`` Not much time for it , I should say ? ''
I had never hoped for this .
“ Yes ; so they tell me .
He is clear that every such person wants to depose him .
‘ Well , old Buck ! ’ said Mr Feeder with a laugh .
<NAME> , tap , tap , to try it better .
`` Not at all , '' I would assure him .
But seeing me , she called me her dear <NAME> , her own boy !
But it 's a very fine head .
`` More shame for him , Fred ! ''
There was also a jack-towel .
I shall keep them till I die .
In course of time , he married her .
How do you like it , and what do you think of gin instead !
Mrs. Snagsby repeatedly inquires of herself .
How do you come here ?
I was obliged to confess that I did not quite know what she meant .
But , she only replied , ‘ Thank you , thank you !
It was a splendid example .
‘ The fact is -- ’ said <NAME> , stopping short .
He thought she stood in awe of him .
<NAME> affair_ grew out of a nomination for <NAME> of <NAME> county .
Mrs General at length retired .
‘ <NAME> likely , ma ’ am , ’ said the magistrate .
interposed the Jew , drawing up his chair .
No one knows it , but I am sure he did .
It has all come out .
‘ The brightest and most genial weather !
It is hard in him not to think of them a little more .
‘ I am very fond of children. ’ ‘ Oh !
“ But he is accused of it .
One could not even say he has been thinking all this while .
They were so desperately sharp , that they quite frightened him .
I want to be a better girl than I am .
No doubt I am disappointed .
`` I hope you are well , <NAME> .
Not remain at <NAME> !
I think I do understand .
But she never uttered a word .
‘ Such charming times ! ’ cried <NAME> .
She presently revived , however , and was really pleased to see me .
How very dreary , cold , and still it was !
Had I better see <NAME> to-night ? ’ ‘ I think not to-night .
The last he brought in , cool and dripping , from the river .
Though he no more sees the portrait than if it were in <NAME> .
`` I have scarcely a friend there now but you .
Drink it , you perwerse imp ; drink it ! '
I mean , I could n't undertake to say it was at first .
‘ He is doing very well .
Open the door of one of these cramped hutches full of sleeping negroes .
It was Mid-summer weather , and the evening was very pleasant .
I have been confiding all my cares to it .
I said a man was .
Call yourself a religious woman ?
“ <NAME> here , old chap , ” said <NAME> , bending over me .
Answer what I ask you .
`` What has he done with his money ? ''
I shall be rendered <NAME> , by my own sister .
said the child , clapping her tiny hands , and bending down to laugh .
<NAME> things prospered , and they were united .
He ’ s out of everybody ’ s depth , he is .
One or the other of you is for ever in the way .
‘ Oh ! ’ said Mr <NAME> , watching him , wonderingly .
`` <NAME> is mistaken , my dear , '' he would say to her .
There are large drops of rain falling , and they made me start .
‘ Where is <NAME> ? ’ was her first question .
Not even he could have told , for such misery can only be felt .
I forgive that woman. ’ ‘ Forgive ! ’ repeated <NAME> , angrily .
<NAME> naturally asks what kind of man he is .
In another moment , <NAME> was in the arms of the weather-beaten pea-coat .
I have no purpose but to die .
You have your troubles at home , you mean ? ’ she said .
‘ But it ’ s two to me , let me tell you .
<NAME> sat at the piano ; <NAME> stood beside her , bending down .
If ever you went home fast in your life , go home fast to-night .
That was Mrs. Chillip ’ s remark to me , only last week .
I read her letter many times .
There is a passion <NAME> _hunting_ _something_ deeply implanted in the human breast .
Do you ? ’ ‘ Yes , sir ! ’ from one half .
Where does she live , <NAME> , that ’ s all ?
Howsoever it may seem to you to touch me , disregard that .
“ I should ask that question .
‘ There ain ’ t no vurks in it , ’ whispered his father .
Has she a father -- mother -- any brothers -- sisters ?
His life is forfeit to the people .
`` Mrs. Smallweed 's brother , my dear friend -- her only relation .
‘ It ’ s a conspiracy , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ I want to speak to you very particularly .
There are no smooth skins where I live .
I will give you more money than you ever had in your life . ''
I began to think I would put it off till tomorrow .
‘ Oh ! ’ said <NAME> , ‘ here ’ s the very sum .
said <NAME> to the grave-digger .
Then she slightly beckons to him and says , `` Come here ! ''
I will not deny , but I have no unaccommodating prejudiced habits .
‘ A mixed fiddlestick , ’ returned my aunt .
There must be time for these late affairs to blow over .
`` They 're better now again , '' said <NAME> 's wife .
But there ’ s some supper getting ready , so <NAME> ’ s expected .
Then once more taking his hand , he walked on with him in silence .
`` I am very sorry , I am sure . ''
No matter , any other time will do .
Was it you , sir ? ’ ‘ It was , ’ said I .
I am <NAME> of <NAME> .
It 's not mine ; it 's yours .
Not the slightest trace or clue could be obtained .
<NAME> saw , but too plainly , that resistance would be of no avail .
V. The Wood-Sawyer One year and three months .
Come and dine with ‘ em .
‘ Have you seen him ? ’ whispers <NAME> .
I don ’ t know this part .
When he came back to his chair , I saw tears in his eyes .
I shall like to see her weep , I shan ’ t mind it .
But that is past -- long past .
So much the worse for me .
I can not reveal it , or divide it .
I am not warped by prejudices , as an <NAME> baby is by bandages .
One is enough to lose at a time . '
I could thank God that it was not a shock to me now .
This old man is always a little old man .
A great deal of business was transacted in this short period .
‘ He understands us , I see , ’ said <NAME> .
Listen to me , you drab .
There is something bulky in <NAME> ’ s pocket .
‘ “ Is the fare paid ? ” inquired my uncle .
`` You are too quick for me ! ''
‘ Are you a stranger in this place ? ’ asked <NAME> .
`` Very well observed , my boy ! ''
<NAME> <NAME> , I wish you good night .
‘ I knew you would be , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Your definition of a horse. ’ ‘ Quadruped .
‘ You are working late tonight , <NAME> , ’ says I .
`` You called her <NAME> , did n't you ?
‘ Pe-e-e-ill ! ’ Horses make a desperate struggle .
But I could not remember where .
It ’ s <NAME> ’ l ! ” and I went in .
Several berths are full of water , and all the cabins are leaky .
I humbly hope it ; but I daren ’ t believe it .
It is but a whim of mine .
In the meanwhile , <NAME> would wait alone by the fire for the Doctor .
I want to be told all about it .
It may have been the cheering , or it may have happened sooner .
It ’ s all ready for cooking , and only been waiting for you .
It ’ s my intent to be a gentleman .
‘ I wonder at that , ’ said the manager .
The real hues are delicate , and need a clearer vision .
He raised <NAME> ’ s tumbler to his lips and drank off its contents .
' I hope I have not hurt you ! '
How did you come by it ?
He has openly mentioned it in many places .
`` You are not looking at it , '' said <NAME> .
Whatever they do , there they sit from the first moment to the last .
<NAME> , ' replied <NAME> , who had prepared himself for such emergency .
<NAME> <NAME> see these things ?
Our dearest <NAME> is a favourite child of nature .
In his agony , he caught the spectral hand .
You are guilty of mockery .
I saw a tear of surprise in her eye .
“ <NAME> again , and let me look at something else .
Everything the dear child wore was either too large for him or too small .
`` Then they do not know it yet ? ''
His son cried lustily that night , at all events .
She has no name , I have no name .
He stood at a little distance from them .
`` Not so much as one short prayer ? ''
Nobody but a child would have thought of YOUR having the money !
<NAME> ’ t you think it ’ s time you roused yourself a little ?
‘ You had better say he won ’ t , ’ replied the chairman .
‘ We mustn ’ t make a show of being disturbed .
Now , you know the lad , and can guess the rest .
`` I do n't care for that , '' said Mrs. Guppy .
And she cast down her eyes , and whispered , Yes .
‘ No , thank ’ ee , ’ said the <NAME> .
She has been dead a score of years or more .
On this point they were both agreed , and behaved in unison accordingly .
We have settled that , just now .
So do I , ’ said Mr Toots .
'More likely on that wery account , ' said <NAME> .
Who needs to be told that THEY were happy ?
said <NAME> , bending over him .
Her hands should be the first to touch her .
These preliminaries adjusted , <NAME> and <NAME> returned home .
'And he _will_ be a sweep , will he ? '
‘ Keep off ! ’ cried the trembling wretch .
This pale young gentleman quickly disappeared , and reappeared beside me .
You were many years at my school .
It 's a fight to get back again .
The wedding is sure to be lucky !
They had been strangers too long .
She won ’ t hear of it ; but I am .
He ’ s been in hiding about here , this week or over .
How was my daughter found , <NAME> ?
The rings are as coldly viewed as the bracelet .
Still , it was not a disagreeable position -- and it was a position .
“ <NAME> , ” said I , “ how do you manage it ?
‘ They must be townspeople , ’ said the magistrate .
‘ A cost , my own ? ’ ‘ In money , dear .
Never had such a commotion agitated the town before .
I have been a <NAME> prisoner .
<NAME> <NAME> is not within at the present moment but will be back directly .
Please to let me know. ” “ Yes , sir .
<NAME> <NAME> is a wharfinger , <NAME> , at the canal , sir .
What is the matter , gentlemen ?
You can not shut it out .
You seem to breathe quickly. ” “ Perhaps I do , <NAME> .
So did his father , and his grandfather , and his great-grandfather ! ''
'Of course the lady knows that , do n't she ? '
Why ? ’ ‘ I think uncle wants a companion , father .
says the trooper in a quiet voice .
There you place me in a difficulty , Mr Boffin .
Suppose there should be any mistake -- any scratching out !
“ I call myself the <NAME> of the firewood guillotine .
‘ Enough and more than enough of the subject , ’ said she gloomily .
Then I shall acknowledge it and make him reparation . ''
'Have you shot anything particular , lately , <NAME> ? '
The one word , <NAME> , he muttered millions of times .
<NAME> followed him with his eyes .
So bad ? ’ ‘ I don ’ t say that .
Have you been here ever since ? ''
“ Two things I can tell you , ” said <NAME> .
Having given utterance to which remarkable sentiment , he occupied himself as before .
Still the <NAME> pointed with an unmoved finger to the head .
These artifices <NAME> deemed inscrutable by any uninspired observer .
<NAME> <NAME> was unfortunately a little vulgar .
‘ Designed to surprise you , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> such a man too , grown such a fine strong man .
The stores are poorer here ; the passengers less gay .
<NAME> got made a sexton by being umble .
It went on a few paces , and stopped again .
was he insolent to her too ? ’ asked <NAME> after a struggle .
‘ Windows are closed that never used to be by day .
Which a deferential satellite produced .
`` I had no such thing .
She was always grave and strict .
‘ Pretty situation for the general chairman of the <NAME> .
Here we are , sir , '' says <NAME> .
<NAME> Leicester doubts his hearing .
<NAME> <NAME> , the best of her sex !
In Marseilles that day there was a villainous prison .
“ She is going to be married. ” “ Going ? ” echoed madame .
Back agen ever and ever so often .
“ 'She has some recent association with the number twelve ? '
The mature young gentleman is a gentleman of property .
My butcher says to me he wants that little bill .
Down poured the wine like oil on blazing fire .
‘ What did you say ? ’ asked <NAME> , very sharply .
As <NAME> , and Caddy herself , and many others .
But it will be all left behind .
this is a good beginning .
The day after to-morrow , if you please .
I see you rise up <NAME> , <NAME> , where you sat down <NAME> .
You never can tell how she ’ ll head , you see .
It ’ s awful enough to BE <NAME> , without being called so .
`` Why do YOU come here ? ''
<NAME> , you 're a-staring at the pocket-handkerchiefs !
Now , these tumbling tenements contain , by night , a swarm of misery .
This rock we must leave to time , chance , and hopeful circumstance .
His knock is immediately answered by <NAME> himself .
She would lead them to me and coax them to me .
<NAME> to the best man !
They are not going to-day !
<NAME> <NAME> ! ’ cried <NAME> , ‘ God bless you !
See what the prisoner is .
He has no expectations , no property to come into .
<NAME> replies with excellent temper , `` Ah !
‘ What have you been doing ?
‘ Well , it don ’ t matter , ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> wilt be faithful , little <NAME> ? '
For the time being at least , I was saved .
‘ I said , letting alone the risk , ’ replied <NAME> , evasively .
You have a friend in me , <NAME> ; a staunch friend .
‘ Where do you come from ? ’ inquired the clerk .
I appeal to you -- is this quite respectful ?
This was at the expiration of about six weeks .
‘ What do you take a pleasure in ruining a cove for ?
I was haunted by the file too .
Mostly they come for skill -- or idleness .
To help his memory I mentioned my name .
This interesting communication was addressed to Mrs. Maylie , who received it very graciously .
You have poured balm into my anxious soul .
There was a clock too , an old clock , in one corner .
'What am I to do ? '
‘ I am impatient of our situation .
I do n't think that wise , mind , but it 's my trust .
I only ask for him that his life may be fairly remembered .
`` Not related to her , sir ? ''
On the appointed day <NAME> arrived .
And how did you like Mrs. Jellyby , my dear ? ''
The Wanderer can only speak of the case as if it were his own .
I have a question to ask him as we go .
`` I am sure of that , '' said I .
That went round the letters .
Go home with this intelligence and come to <NAME> 's by and by ! ''
<NAME> leaned upon his pillow , holding his head upon her arm .
I would that all our people remembered it !
“ Did that other creature come to the same end ? ” I asked .
‘ Thank you , sir , ’ replied the collector , buttoning his waistcoat .
It 's a pity but what we had seen the other woman . ''
His eyes are sometimes closed and sometimes open .
You are <NAME> , ’ said the gentleman .
<NAME> version by <NAME> .
But I did ; and I saw him no more till last night . '
There was greater reason than before to do what I had resolved to do .
It is as active in other people ’ s minds as in his .
'Pray do n't interrupt just now , ' said <NAME> .
Everybody was pleased and interested , and <NAME> was well repaid for his trouble .
The whole party , and especially the ladies , are very frolicsome .
I am walking calmly beside you to the house .
Take away those letters , and throw them in the fire .
‘ Oh ! ’ he said , turning round , ‘ yes .
You may act for yourselves , _you_ may .
The purport of the muttering was : ‘ that <NAME> , by <NAME> !
From the time when he was left in the loft-room , he vanished .
‘ Now , wait a bit , <NAME> ; there ’ s something more .
We all do that , all the colony over .
‘ Ah ! ’ he said , after a brief silence .
<NAME> for the <NAME> prisoner in front there !
'Is <NAME> at home ? '
<NAME> <NAME> was laid up with an attack of rheumatism .
It 's death to come back .
Put down your hat ; and speak to my young friend . '
A tremble , a rumble , and a fall of some light dry matter .
`` And how did you like the ride ?
I have a presentiment that it must be a girl .
The door was partly open .
When I had complied , he said , `` Ah ! ''
<NAME> <NAME> took her hand , and congratulated her upon her marriage .
He panted for breath , and looked benignantly round upon his friends .
Bring me the professor 's goblet , <NAME> ! ''
Let me find my brother. ’ ‘ Stay !
The nearest voices took up the cry , and hundreds echoed it .
I was certain it was he .
‘ His blood on his own head , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Passionate with you , sir , I admit I am .
He always treats you with such delicate gallantry and attention .
Mr <NAME> begged that it might not be touched ; it was perfection .
`` I do n't know , '' replies Jo .
Then he came out of his meditation , and drank more wine .
“ Will you answer me a single question ? ” “ Perhaps .
I feel that I have no right to mention this matter without his concurrence .
'Has the boy ever been here before ? '
A cool calm medium always .
You have been mean and shabby . ''
said <NAME> , coming laughingly behind me and clasping me merrily round the waist .
In turning to at last , we turn to in earnest .
Would you like to see 'em ?
But I wish you ’ d call me <NAME> , if you please .
I do n't particular complain of that .
You are a great gainer by me .
`` Would it not be better to rest now ? ''
<NAME> , my dear , I am ready ! ''
‘ Never better , <NAME> , never better in all my life .
`` A rat , '' says my Lady .
And you 're to be a man ! ''
I am the bearer of a letter of introduction to <NAME> , the banker .
It might be poor , mean , shabby , stupid , dull .
Why at the <NAME> , do you think ?
‘ You say you have seen her .
It 's me wot has done it !
It struck eleven , and he made believe to compose himself patiently .
‘ Going to be ? ’ ‘ Not that I know of , deary .
I am your son ’ s obedient servant .
'And you ARE a beadle , are you not ? '
I will not so violate what I call the sacred rites of hospitality .
My aunt being resolute , I went out and got the ale myself .
‘ If she is not found , perhaps she never will be found .
‘ Certainly not , ’ replied <NAME> .
That was <NAME> , the blackbird .
he inquired , glancing at <NAME> 's usual chamber .
He do n't notice me , but I notice him .
I called out , “ <NAME> ’ t be afeerd !
He tried to say `` Humbug ! ''
In going , he had to face <NAME> .
`` Or a haughty gentleman of <NAME> ? ''
‘ Oh , that ’ s it , is it ? ’ said <NAME> .
“ How are you living ? ” I asked him .
Why did he never come ?
‘ <NAME> ’ t come near me ! ’ she cried .
they 'll find him guilty , ” said the other .
They might get their living by robbing and murdering travellers .
While doing it , too , with the purpose of easing and serving her .
The <NAME> offered no violence to the wholesome monotony of the town .
By degrees , though very slowly , I at last overcame my strange emotion .
At your time of life too !
The bigger it gets , the more stupid I get .
<NAME> takes him by both hands .
`` Here is <NAME> , sir , '' he said .
‘ I repeat , <NAME> , does not please me .
If I had any money , I do n't know anything about it .
'Lord , that 's the very thing ! '
You buy her , at the same time , a small annuity .
Not so was <NAME> seen on this occasion .
say you love me. ’ ‘ Mr .
‘ I left a note for you , ’ resumed <NAME> .
But the individual wasn ’ t any ways equal to him .
I like your looks ; they please me .
Then , they moved away on their hands and knees .
I am always at your disposal .
We can have dinner in from just across <NAME> .
You are so good , and so sweet-tempered .
‘ I was not shown these rooms the other day .
That he would be leniently treated , I could not hope .
inquired the matron , taking up the sugar-basin .
<NAME> <NAME> has eyed his man narrowly .
In came the housemaid , with her cousin , the baker .
said <NAME> , shaking his head .
'Why , my dear -- ' urged <NAME> submissively .
'Never , ' rejoined <NAME> ; 'nor against me either .
You do n't doubt <NAME> ?
<NAME> , what ’ s the matter with you , woman ?
Again <NAME> coughed -- louder this time than he had coughed yet .
Day after day passed , and she did not return .
“ You cost me that place .
And what were his thoughts meanwhile ?
I shall be given up .
<NAME> , of course , resolved to go direct to Mr Casby ’ s .
They appeared to be always excited about canvassing and electing .
‘ And turn the key and stand by it !
This seems incredible , even of <NAME> , but it is the law .
It is so very difficult to keep her from the door . ''
The noose was on his neck .
‘ Were you ever there ? ’ ‘ Oh no !
‘ How dare you do this ? ’ said Mr Dorrit .
`` Where is he , my love ? ''
‘ Come in , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Very well , sir , ’ replied the waiter .
‘ Is it a bargain between us , <NAME> ?
I had forced it out of them .
This was the morning of the day appointed for <NAME> 's departure .
He was not merciful with her , and he made her do it .
The <NAME> lubricates his nose .
Have you any objection to be known as <NAME> ?
asked <NAME> 's good lady .
‘ First , I spent all I had of my own .
It was their turn to laugh now at the notion of his shaking <NAME> .
I therefore have not come to the consideration of <NAME> as a neophyte .
cried the Jew , in amazement .
He repeated what he had already said .
But I have found nothing the matter with him .
‘ Are you sure , <NAME> ? ’ said <NAME> .
There ’ s nothing against _them_ , ’ said <NAME> , comforting himself .
Then why should HE escape ? ''
‘ Put down his name , <NAME> , ’ said the magistrate .
<NAME> <NAME> takes his leave , and Mr Carker takes his leave .
It may have its effect on others , and may be meant to have .
The discovery of this Behoving <NAME> was the discovery of the political perpetual motion .
There never was such a hard case !
<NAME> , ’ said the manager , presenting him to <NAME> .
‘ Here ’ s a handkerchief , ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> was next questioned .
I was now certain of it .
“ Well , but I mean a four-footed Squeaker , ” said <NAME> .
It 's not worth much to him .
<NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> Mrs General and <NAME> .
We had another odd specimen on board , of a different kind .
<NAME> , no : you know I make no pretence with you .
I resolved to go out to <NAME> next day , and I went .
At all which moral reflections , <NAME> howled the louder .
‘ There ! ’ rejoined the married lady .
Naturally. ’ ‘ If so be , my lad , ’ returned the <NAME> .
There was no luxury in his room .
<NAME> <NAME> crumpled up the licence , and thrust it into his coat pocket .
You do n't know him , ” said the spy , quickly .
‘ To the Angel at <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> , speaking very quickly .
He knows his old games and his old ways .
Their young families , I am told , they usually leave at home .
`` Will you open the case ? ''
<NAME> ’ t mention it , ’ said <NAME> .
And yet he has received a round half-dozen within the last twenty-four hours .
I forgot myself half a minute ago .
<NAME> good-bye to your father , <NAME> .
Are you blind , deaf , senseless , dead ? ’ said <NAME> .
'Do n't make such a row , ' said <NAME> , bolting the door .
I know every change of his face .
What cheer , my lady lass ! ’ ‘ <NAME> !
‘ You ’ re deep and you ’ re ready .
‘ Now , my dear friend -- ‘ I began .
She had to sacrifice her sinful and shameful affections ; no more .
‘ Nothing has been omitted , I hope ? ’ said the <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> has been in bed -- oh !
cried the young lady , listening .
O save him to me !
He drank a quantity of wine after dinner , in vain .
Is it you ? ’ exclaimed <NAME> , raising herself a little .
You are too great a man , <NAME> , to be thoughtful .
You are dear to me , <NAME> .
She was , at that time , within a few months of her confinement .
But he happens not to be in a business mind .
‘ That is the house I mean .
‘ It must be done , <NAME> ’ am , ’ he says .
Our hour is half-past six. ’ I bowed again .
‘ I said I had pledged my word as a gentleman to skin him .
Do you know a man named <NAME> ? '
Run your eye over it .
‘ Humph ! ’ said <NAME> , looking at us both , I thought .
She 's gone up to <NAME> . ''
You confirm my own impression .
`` You are right , my child .
It is built upon a height , commanding the harbour .
‘ Well , well , well ! ’ murmured the old man .
It has been open a long time !
‘ Now you must really bear with me , because I ask for information .
Is your father so universally despised ?
We lived with a stepfather there .
These results are probably attained through a grand composure of the spirits .
‘ <NAME> for ever ! ’ echoed <NAME> , taking off his hat .
You had better call at our house , if you are going that way .
No knocking or ringing for <NAME> .
I meant as to <NAME> .
I do n't like the name on it .
“ You and your luck , <NAME> !
He appeared to enjoy beyond everything the sound of his own voice .
How does he pass the hours , alone ?
What did he call himself ?
‘ I forgot , ’ said <NAME> .
Blessings on it , how the <NAME> exulted !
He speaks of you in such terms , sometimes , that , oh dear !
‘ The very thing we say ! ’ cried Traddles .
But <NAME> does not go on to the Fields at present .
'He 'll do , ' said the Dodger .
“ The man says , ” <NAME> assented .
Did she call ? ’ ‘ I heard no voice. ’ ‘ You did .
Do you know , I have often wished myself back again ?
The leprosy of unreality disfigured every human creature in attendance upon <NAME> .
The man took strong sharp sudden bites , just like the dog .
<NAME> ’ t put yourself in a passion !
What a disappointment for little <NAME> , and for his darling mother !
<NAME> till to-morrow , sir ; double the chance then .
And I have seen a quantity of good company too ! ''
<NAME> care of me if I faint , <NAME> .
with a sudden revival of his late hostility .
We went on next morning , still by railroad , to <NAME> .
I was trodden upon and fallen over .
‘ <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Copperfield , ’ said <NAME> .
Tilly , here be <NAME> .
<NAME> , ’ was the slow and sad reply .
Mr Lammle , himself a man of business as well as a capitalist .
<NAME> ! ’ ‘ Keep your seat , Mr Venus , ’ said <NAME> .
It was piercing cold , too ; all was gloomy and black .
‘ I would rather you chose for yourself , ’ said <NAME> .
I have never doubted it ; I never shall .
<NAME> never painted out <NAME> 's name .
Near day. ’ ‘ Near day ! ’ she repeated in surprise .
She had lost his name , and could only signify him by his hammer .
Mr Swiveller out of sight , <NAME> immediately withdrew .
This waiting for the latest mail-bags is worse than all .
‘ No , no , ’ said <NAME> , with a smile .
The visitor talked , the Pickwickians listened .
That visit not succeeding either , you will go again perhaps ? ''
She was dead , and past all help , or need of it .
I am not coming in .
I shall return to Mr Dombey almost immediately .
I have him periodically in a vice .
`` He will never pay it ! ''
‘ Is <NAME> at home , my dear ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
said <NAME> , swinging the lantern to and fro in the dark well .
Shall we ever see such a night again , together ! ” Perhaps .
I believe I should have been almost stupefied but for one circumstance .
Meanwhile he took the mutton off the gridiron , and gravely handed it round .
I may well pass that little and go on .
The woman , however , is still inquisitive .
‘ No ! ’ said I , looking from face to face .
with all his might , made off after him , book in hand .
It is all the same to me , sir .
A joint of meat did not grace their board for twenty years .
Some amiable gardener sells them .
One of them was my chosen friend .
Whatever falls out , say nothing ; and do what he bids you .
`` I helped him so far , but that 's little .
<NAME> ’ t say it don ’ t do good .
That there was no immediate cause for -- what ?
“ Monseigneur , the man. ” “ May the Devil carry away these idiots !
When did I ever cringe and fawn to you .
“ Wot have you been a-eatin ’ on ? ” says the doctor .
It was always possible ; the sex being so charming .
'No , it is not , ' replied the man , with a smile .
One keeps a secret better than two .
Jaggers left word , would you wait in his room .
It is a large key , but the keys of prisons are larger .
‘ Much as you was dressed that night .
Whence the low expression , <NAME> ?
<NAME> nodded an expressive assent .
<NAME> would attend to you if you did .
`` Who is that , <NAME> ? ''
She hastened to him , and sat there till he slept .
'Then , they are in the ditch ! '
When she stopped to close the side-gate without noise , Mrs. <NAME> stopped .
Not a doubt about it .
I was reading aloud , and she was listening .
And then I put it to myself , “ Regarding the money .
‘ Judge if I come back from <NAME> as I went !
Where would it buy him such a treasure as <NAME> ?
‘ You will be going early in the morning , <NAME> !
This was explanatory , but not satisfactory .
Perhaps , his brotherly conscience is touched—if there are such things as consciences .
‘ A matter o ’ fower days , ’ said <NAME> .
We had been little lovers once .
My father was struck all of a heap .
It was , and yet was not .
Your honour told me to call you. ” “ Oh !
It was the fortunate legatee .
‘ Are they bright , though ? ’ returned <NAME> , laughing .
Their evening walk was by a river ’ s side .
They laugh and pick him up again .
Because the dearest friend I have in the world has bought it .
<NAME> <NAME> was roused , and his mind was made up .
“ You stock and stone ! ” exclaimed <NAME> .
His eye grew bright , and his face lightened at the thought .
No , it was black , cold , and lifeless as before .
‘ Give way , by <NAME> ! ’ repeated <NAME> , before shoving off .
‘ Why , when did you come here ? ’ asked <NAME> .
Five shillings in the pound , six and-eightpence , ten shillings ?
‘ I don ’ t mind them any more than you do .
‘ <NAME> , ’ said R. W. , ‘ how de do to-night ?
Nothing worthy of special mention occurred during the journey .
Behind the scenes , the same unwonted excitement prevailed .
<NAME> ’ stupid o ’ me , that ‘ ere !
<NAME> asks , a little dashed by the suddenness of this turn .
‘ The press is a mighty engine , sir , ’ said <NAME> .
It was dressed and trimmed into no ceremony of expression .
I was full of eloquence .
`` One half hour , <NAME> , only one ! ''
There ’ s no knowing what might happen .
`` Old girl , '' says <NAME> .
Them were her words ; 'Mrs .
Think betther o ’ us , <NAME> .
After a short interval , a tap at the door .
‘ Good-bye , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , stretching out his hand .
It was at <NAME> that the cause was to come on .
`` You are right , my dear , I wo n't .
Suppose the man says to me seven and sixpence ?
'Good-night , <NAME> , ' said the Jew , muffling himself up as before .
You can make your way anywhere , I believe .
`` Will you be more so when you have sent me away ?
They are very slight , perhaps .
I wonder he committed himself without seeing more of his way first .
I am going to stay with my dear husband .
‘ <NAME> society , sir , ’ remarked the powdered-headed footman .
He was dressed in the very fullest and completest travelling trim .
‘ It must be Mr <NAME> .
'Two hours ago , she was quite well . '
Where the birds sing melodiously .
And without doubt the lady so crushed with gifts would find them irresistible .
`` Why should you ever have been otherwise ?
So with the curiosities he had brought home from various voyages .
‘ Or the <NAME> ! ’ cried Mrs. Nupkins .
‘ Where ’ s <NAME> ? ’ said <NAME> .
‘ That ’ s lucky for you , <NAME> .
‘ Hope she has ! ’ he replied .
‘ Heaven bless you ! ’ she said , giving me her hand .
There was no speaking among the string of riders .
'Tell them to fetch a hackney-coach , and be ready to go with me .
You to marry without connexion !
To-morrow comes , the savoury preparations for the <NAME> come , the evening comes .
He has n't left it to me .
said <NAME> to crown all .
<NAME> formed no part of <NAME> ’ s character .
‘ A word , ’ said the dwarf , ‘ before we go farther .
And thus suspicion gets into <NAME> 's Court , <NAME> .
With a full heart , for the love of him you once were . ''
He had fallen into a doze .
Of the swell , and flash , and murmur of the calm sea .
What shall I put you down for ? ''
<NAME> got off the box , and said yes , he was .
‘ I had rather be a child , ’ replied <NAME> .
‘ Three or four weeks , <NAME> !
He came yesterday , on my blue-eyed daughter 's birthday .
`` You may go into <NAME> , without precaution , and be run over .
‘ Because it ain ’ t one loss , but a round dozen .
The whole country rings with it .
‘ She is in a state of frenzy , ’ I whispered to him .
‘ And where afterwards ? ’ asked <NAME> .
You must not suppose it to be a fine endowment .
'It 's a the -- ; you 're one , are you not ? '
Do you see any objection ?
cries mademoiselle with a toss of her head and a laugh .
‘ I didn ’ t stop a moment .
Where two or three marked ones go , all the rest follow .
I was still less able to speak than before .
says the young man , resuming his examination .
This really is not what I expected of you ! ''
Besides , I never disparage , sir .
‘ Oh , my eye , how prime !
`` No , miss , '' <NAME> replied .
`` And what does the sergeant say about this business ? ''
`` Your duty as a child -- '' `` Oh !
I thought I heard her voice . '
They often `` came down '' handsomely , and <NAME> never did .
Sure you 're not a going to favor only one of us .
We soon found the chandler 's shop .
He was born in the market-town , and so was his young widow .
The shaken diamonds in her hair started and trembled .
Put your hands to them ; put your will to them .
'What 's your name , you hardened scoundrel ? '
I can wake many nights , when I am put to it .
How could my character fail to be influenced by them ?
I canna coom in wi ’ ’ em .
He ’ s a very respectable man , with children of his own .
<NAME> <NAME> quietly shakes his head .
I 'm only master of my own trade .
<NAME> had everything it could want , and could not want , for dinner .
I see nothing to succeed us but a race of weavers . ''
‘ <NAME> , how could you have acted so mean and dishonourable !
‘ I ’ ve heerd somethin ’ on it , ’ replied <NAME> .
People are not bad because they come there .
‘ Something like practice that , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ It ’ s well I am a liverer .
`` Old <NAME> has got his own at last , hey ? ''
Upon it , <NAME> resolved to encourage him .
It was only this timely appearance that kept <NAME> from swooning .
You carry his knife and you wear his coat .
I remember that <NAME> takes no interest in the game .
<NAME> was talking to an old gentleman with a grey head .
inquired the jailer , nudging the silent Dodger with his elbow .
I want you to think of it quite differently .
He writes with that intention , and in that hope .
I don ’ t like him , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Good-morning , ’ said <NAME> , bowing and passing by .
At <NAME> ’ s , they give up the <NAME> and <NAME> for lost .
The remembrance of last night added a barbed point to it .
There is no finer air and no healthier soil in the world ! ''
“ Murder ! ” says the old gen ’ l ’ m ’ n .
<NAME> jumped the driver , and out got <NAME> .
<NAME> had been working cheerfully .
( A dozen good fellows dispersed to get it . )
He had all our names in his hat .
We read of it with the truest interest .
‘ But what else are we made for ?
The madman ’ s cunning had overreached them all .
It was an office still , but not his .
Do n't say you do n't know that , <NAME> .
Now you mention it , <NAME> , I shouldn ’ t wonder at all .
She never told me that .
`` Not much , but her voice was hoarse . ''
‘ Oh dear , dear , how many of them !
‘ I am glad to hear you say so .
'Hard weather , <NAME> , ' said the matron .
<NAME> , rivers , lakes , and ponds .
And yet he had changed very little in his progress through life .
It was in vain for Mr Flintwinch to try another screw at him .
‘ Every club and gaming-room has rung with it .
We have been counting on your return these three or four days past .
‘ Why didn ’ t you tell me ?
A hazardous and perilous journey , over abysses where a slip would be destruction .
And then we should be angry , besides. ’ Another silence fell upon them .
`` If you know what you mean , that 's quite enough . ''
The <NAME> goes to Pieces 34 .
‘ Pretty well , <NAME> , in general .
What is it you call him ? ” “ Pip , ” said <NAME> .
'Why do n't you put yourself under <NAME> , <NAME> ? '
`` The time is not come for your standing pledged to one another .
I leave it to your discretion , <NAME> . ''
All adust and athirst , the two entered the wine-shop .
That was when she saw me .
It made no difference to him .
‘ I want to take counsel with you .
It ’ s a gratification to me .
Bless you , _I_ have no business , ” said <NAME> .
I always thought that , ’ said <NAME> setting down his glass .
All that he said was quite true .
‘ Not so much so as I could wish .
‘ Oh yes , you may come in , ’ returned her brother .
I would rather that they never did ; I hope that they never may .
‘ I do indeed , ’ replied <NAME> , with a bitter sigh .
Never told the old parson where they were .
Now , you know what the <NAME> is .
This way I kep myself a going .
A few words more , <NAME> , and I have said my say .
Is old Joe your friend ?
His eyes stood still , and settled into that former intent unmeaning stare .
I have suffered for it in kind .
`` You have brought your bird with you , I suppose ? ''
His cane alone would have told it long ago , if nothing else had .
His bright face seemed uncommonly attractive to Mr Pancks .
Something you have got into your heads about her , of course .
Only <NAME> knows how much .
‘ He must be made , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
Was it my own wrong I remembered ?
‘ And how is <NAME> ? ’ he says , kindly .
‘ What cheer , <NAME> ? ’ cried the <NAME> , heartily .
I love her ; and He knows how well ! '
What sympathy should a holy preacher have with either ?
She does not languish for you , and it might have been dangerous .
I am accustomed to be seized with giddiness .
“ Good day , madame , ” said the new-comer .
On the contrary , I thought he seemed the fresher for it .
‘ Be this as it may , a church bell struck two .
Yes , yes , that ’ s the way .
But the gentleman , he give me something !
It seemed a great relief to him .
‘ <NAME> news ! ’ cried Mrs. Sparsit , blandly .
‘ Oh yes ! ’ cried Mr <NAME> , with bitterness .
I shall pay the same , if not more .
You told me you had a proposal ; what is it ?
‘ She slighted that , I think ? ’ said <NAME> .
He covered his eyes with his hand and turned away his head .
This was his little housekeeper , his daughter <NAME> , <NAME> said .
‘ Go on , ladies , go on , ’ said <NAME> .
I act as a friend .
So commences the new philosophy !
‘ Yes , she is a widow , ’ replied the lady .
‘ Do you know the suspicions to which your father makes himself liable ?
He had no resource but to remain where he was until daylight appeared .
Oh no ! ’ replied <NAME> , shrinking back .
‘ Poverty and pride don ’ t go at all well together .
No , I see there 's no way out .
Em ’ ly is very bad , but they were fond of one another .
`` The old girl , '' says <NAME> , acquiescing , `` saves .
So I don ’ t care for your present eyes .
Have I been remiss in anything ? ''
I have heard it many times , sung by the little children .
But he will perish ; there is no real hope. ” “ Yes .
‘ Perhaps you wonder who I am .
'Young boys have been smothered in chimneys before now , ' said another gentleman .
The cook and housemaid simultaneously ejaculated 'Lor ! '
Would they keep me long enough to spend seven shillings ?
Why no , not quite well .
It must be broken to him , before the town-crier knows it .
`` So she had , '' cried <NAME> .
No more evasions. ’ ‘ That <NAME> was the beginning of it all .
‘ I know all about it .
I have always dreamed of myself as a child learning to do needlework .
Where are you going to , <NAME> ?
Perhaps I did want you .
You may trust me , for I took your son .
So , having come there against my inclination , I went on against it .
You have no family , sir ? ’ I shook my head .
That the bond , due today at twelve , is now waste paper .
Our wants are not many .
He is quite right , ’ said <NAME> emphatically .
`` Responsibility , my dear <NAME> ? ''
‘ Well , <NAME> ! ’ said <NAME> , meekly turning to me .
`` Why , he is not in this place . ''
‘ What thall it be , <NAME> , while you wait ?
Here was one of the advantages of having lived alone so long !
Imperceptibly I became conscious of a change in <NAME> , however .
Bring out some of the gold you sold yourself to the devil for .
`` You wish to be anonymous ? ''
‘ I think not , Mr Wrayburn .
My lips are closed upon the past from this hour .
It might be brought about .
“ When shall I have you here again ? ” said <NAME> .
<NAME> and spiritless as they were , its streets were insupportable .
However , the last remark had better be answered .
How anxious , how dismal , how long !
‘ Yes , for my nephew , ’ said my aunt .
‘ Very well , ’ said the magistrate .
‘ So you said that day upon the bridge .
`` I have been here very often , sir .
‘ <NAME> , I suppose ? ’ said the lodger .
Servants gliding up and down stairs rustle , but make no sound of footsteps .
`` They vary in their number , sir .
You must know <NAME> 's <NAME> in <NAME> .
‘ Yes , he did , ’ returned his sister .
The bill is down -- but there is no tenant .
In making it , he revoked .
Keep her under your thumb .
The appointment _was_ a device to keep the brother away !
'Well , well , ' said the old gentleman , composing his features .
He tells Edward he is , I believe .
I am not very learned in noses .
I hardly thought he would ; but it was better for us both . '
You see all I have got about me .
‘ Here he is ! ’ said <NAME> , rising with great glee .
‘ Now , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
Oh , what shall I do !
He received the communication with perfect calmness , and acquiesced in its propriety .
You have the advantage of me . ''
<NAME> , my dear , I must have him found .
‘ Hollo ! ’ said the old gentleman .
I am off the volunteer list altogether .
<NAME> makes his military bow .
<NAME> ’ t be uneasy for me while you are gone .
There ’ s not another man alive who could carry it off like that .
I was only present in one of these establishments during the hours of instruction .
Why , good Heaven , we are nothing but forms !
Spurn it ! ’ With a similar action .
‘ Very happy indeed , thank you , aunt , ’ I said .
He is a blunt old blade is <NAME> .
You are a little before your time , sir .
Well , next mornin ’ , the husband was missin ’ .
All this is true , but the <NAME> Office went beyond it .
But I 'll offer to go , if anybody else will .
Go along into your corner !
`` I ought to imitate you , in fact , Mr .
'Fagin , ' said <NAME> ; 'what of him ? '
At first they were not awake , though open .
<NAME> in remembrance , and indulgence in forgetfulness .
‘ When did his old master come or send here last ?
‘ You wouldn ’ t mind selling it , now ? ’ ‘ Ah !
I know them to have been as honestly under my delusion as I myself .
They must have been easily satisfied in those days , I should think .
Perhaps not , for women understand women .
No occasion to inquire who YOUR father and mother is .
Think on it when the winds is roaring and the waves is rowling .
' I will not suffer the young lady to go any farther .
But , there was one remarkable piece of evidence on the spot .
Let him turn those eyes of his on me .
‘ What a pleasant thing filial piety is to contemplate !
`` Good heaven , and it is really <NAME> ! ''
‘ Now I see my little friend .
`` All this , my dear , '' said I .
I am quite satisfied of it myself .
‘ Ah , my poor dear pretty little <NAME> ! ’ exclaimed <NAME> .
`` Or he may have been taken in , in some pretended bargain .
I am devoted to it .
`` Yes , '' said the old man abstractedly .
`` Do it , then , '' observes the constable .
`` I have had one of <NAME> compatriots in my time , sir . ''
Oh consider what you do .
`` Oh , dear me , what 's this , what 's this ! ''
Private and confidential ; relating to <NAME> .
I 'm sure you will , on account of the family credit . ''
<NAME> remarks of the deceased that he was the trustiest and dearest person !
His admiration of the widow increased as she spoke .
But it 's not my business .
What does this mean ? ’ Again the woman said she could not tell .
The just indignation of a gentleman has sent the blood boiling to my head .
I shall be better alone .
What do I show ? ’ demanded Mr Merdle hurriedly .
You are envious , <NAME> , and grudging .
‘ Run to <NAME> ’ s , <NAME> .
There is no such person .
What new occurrence is it that makes this tranquil old woman tremble so ?
‘ You had better send for something to cover it .
‘ Why are you encircling me ? ’ she asked , trembling .
All the world knows that . ''
From the <NAME> ( <NAME> ) of yesterday , we learn the following particulars .
I was in a state of perfect rapture .
In your employment is an under-handed sneak , named <NAME> .
<NAME> don ’ t , ’ Mr <NAME> interposed .
And he was the proprietor of the place .
‘ He is better , ’ returned <NAME> .
Neither did he say one word .
‘ Dear me ! ’ cried <NAME> .
The deepest and strongest affection of both their hearts settled upon one object .
The night was bitter cold .
I have determined that you shall not .
`` Dreadful apparition , why do you trouble me ? ''
‘ Quite , <NAME> , thank you. ’ ‘ Are you sure ?
‘ Mais oui , ’ said the foreign gentleman , turning towards him .
<NAME> <NAME> fell into an enchanting and delicious reverie .
‘ Let me be shaved ! ’ said <NAME> .
`` A threatening , murderous , dangerous fellow ! ''
<NAME> , come up , ’ said the stout gentleman .
I am quite as much attached to it as if I believed it .
Let him know what it was !
This evening the <NAME> give a banquet .
‘ She must just hate and detest the whole set-out of us .
For years after it occurred , I dreamed of it often .
The trooper beckons as he calls him .
And he was too far gone to be helped out of that . ''
Kissing the tips of his left fingers .
Always the same with you people .
A sluggish ditch deposited its mud at the prison walls .
`` Yes , dear lady , I will , and tell you true .
She ’ s the “ <NAME> ” now .
says <NAME> in friendly converse as they descend the stairs .
You can not be more ready to speak than I am to hear . ''
The prospect was worse than before .
At last the enemy retreats , and then <NAME> fetches <NAME> up .
Do you remember me ? ’ ‘ Yes , ’ she answered , wondering .
I will leave you no escape .
<NAME> , you ’ re a needy chap .
`` But he was along with me , sir , '' says the woman .
`` I have no doubt of it , '' said <NAME> .
It was his second offence .
‘ And all ill go with it .
What I wish is , to be perfectly business-like , and perfectly punctual .
And another circumstance invested this old lady with peculiar terrors .
`` Yet what can I do ?
I knew the piteous face I had seen in the little child .
“ I _do_ know the Bailey. ” “ Just so .
‘ Well ? ’ said that young gentleman .
You did well to send .
They said I was so gentle , but I am sure THEY were !
‘ Oh it is such a dreadful thing !
What am I to dodge her for ?
<NAME> <NAME> loved that craft for my sake .
There was a short silence .
Perhaps he had come out with the express intention .
‘ You don ’ t take water , of course ? ’ said <NAME> .
‘ All right , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
Who made the <NAME> Bailey a judge of beauty ?
A queer moral to derive from antiquity , yet older than any traceable antiquity .
You will not refuse to do this , mother ? '
<NAME> has not heard of anything .
I am not clear what to do or how to act next .
Now , this was an interesting thing .
I heard him give the order .
All ’ s well , all ’ s well , my dear .
Promise me ! ’ ‘ <NAME> , I do .
‘ Devil a bit , sir , ’ returned <NAME> .
I can faintly remember learning the alphabet at her knee .
‘ Can I assist you , sir ? ’ asked <NAME> .
‘ Good ! ’ said <NAME> , when this was brought .
`` <NAME> , too , '' cries mademoiselle furiously , `` by her ladyship !
When will you resume ? ’ ‘ Never , sir. ’ ‘ Never ?
`` I hope so , '' adds my Lady .
inquires <NAME> , adjusting her cowl over her head .
`` I have no peace of my life .
<NAME> to-morrow , and no doubt open verdict .
Yet I know the face. ” “ I think not .
<NAME> , my darling , are you listening ?
The service comes to an end , and the servitors disperse to breakfast .
I 'll not be played with .
You ’ ll stand behind that door , and judge him for yourself .
My Spy will find a place for me .
‘ What was that you said , <NAME> ? ’ he demanded .
‘ You are a piece of caustic , <NAME> , ’ retorted <NAME> .
I do n't know where she go 'd .
“ Tar ! ” cried my sister , in amazement .
A glass of srub and water , now ?
It always kept me company .
Suddenly we are all right by some extraordinary means , and stop to breathe .
‘ Allow me to introduce myself -- <NAME> .
She lives , you observe , in the very first style .
My dearest Edith ! ’ she cried archly .
‘ I have thrown my fame and good name to the winds !
If the young lady would condescent !
‘ Silence ! ’ roared the mayor ’ s attendants .
There was not much to look at .
<NAME> , look once more upon the prisoner .
he demanded , in a faltering voice .
She has done it in a ridiculous fancy of giving herself up to another .
Did you never see such a shape soaked into your boat ?
So it will be with her to the end .
‘ Or taking any ? ’ added <NAME> .
`` Accept my blessing , <NAME> , '' said <NAME> in tears .
as he goes in again and lies down with a gloomy yawn .
Upstairs <NAME> did step accordingly , leaving <NAME> below .
<NAME> care of yourself , jockey of <NAME> !
‘ Not a morsel , ’ said my aunt .
My life tends that way , now .
“ Estella of where ? ” said I .
‘ Try it. ’ ‘ Stop a bit .
This lounger is not shabby yet , but that may come .
I do n't know what I said now .
But this was not the worst of it .
won ’ t there ! ’ replied Mrs. Sanders .
The stranger seemed a little more fatigued than before .
said a girl , appearing as she spoke .
I recognise no such thing .
In many great respects he was essentially below them .
And walked with a settled step , down-stairs .
The deadly statistical clock very hollow .
It was a happy circumstance for me that <NAME> came back first .
The notion of her managing !
“ 'What strength there is in these common bodies ! '
Which <NAME> , of course , would immediately do .
“ I said nephew , boy , ” said he .
‘ The search has been quite unsuccessful then ? ’ ‘ Quite , master .
'To-night 's paper says that <NAME> 's took .
‘ But come ! ’ said Mr Meagles .
'Have n't you done it , with other boys , scores of times ?
What do you want to do ?
A gull comes sweeping by their heads and flouts them .
That ’ s the way we ’ re taxed in this country .
'So it is , ' acquiesced <NAME> .
' A boy was born there . '
It ’ s only a temporary arrangement , you know .
We will journey from this place together , before the week is out .
You know , you know , it 's true ! ''
What right have you to be merry ?
Out with it , lad ! ’ <NAME> happened to glance towards Mrs. Sparsit .
For a little while they are silent .
We must quarrel with him , brother Charles. ’ ‘ We must .
And the parson ’ s health too if you like .
‘ In confidence for how long ?
‘ Come here , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Yes , it is , ma ’ am , ’ said Mrs. Crupp .
We may know what it is. ” “ It will seem nothing to you .
‘ Ah , <NAME> ’ s <NAME> , ’ repeated the fat man .
‘ The bell , ’ said <NAME> , as though in explanation .
Who could bear to drag out a life in such a spot ?
<NAME> and <NAME> , thinking him indisposed , whisper , ‘ Man faint .
‘ I heard it from your father-in-law ’ s sister .
I am happy in the prospect of all I can achieve so easily .
‘ I am going through <NAME> ’ s Practice .
She was uncertain in her mind , and not happy .
The <NAME> of <NAME> rose .
Broke his heart of the <NAME> mines , mused Mr Dombey .
By the <NAME> , you _may_ suppose so .
‘ It is as you think ; not as I do .
I know of nothing I reserve that can affect your son .
Mr Meagles , however , thoroughly enjoyed <NAME> .
Had she not seen her brother to-night ?
He is a match for my Lady there .
<NAME> care of my Uncle !
I came on purpose , but I had not the courage .
said I , kissing her bright hair , which was all I could see .
There he was , of course .
“ What 's all this ? ” said <NAME> .
Still , the doubt may be gently insinuated .
you vicious old thing ! ’ ( This to Mr Boffin . )
Fellows who go in for <NAME> must take the consequences .
I give it very serious consideration , and I speak to you accordingly .
' I do n't know , ' replied <NAME> , pettishly .
It is our natural progress , I have heard. ’ ‘ Well , well !
<NAME> shook her head , still smiling .
‘ Let us see how we stand .
They couldn ’ t begin till it was off my mind .
We meet tonight , and part tonight .
You may like to see her before you leave .
Ten or a dozen years a stranger .
You are very kind , <NAME> , but I must beg to be excused .
Mrs. Micawber was amazed , but very glad to see me .
It was all one. ’ ‘ Pardon !
O let us be joyful ! ''
You have no trouble , I hope , to keep you waking ? ''
`` Do you mean in point of reward ? ''
'That 's very likely , ' returned <NAME> with a malicious grin .
‘ Yes. ’ <NAME> shook his head .
<NAME> ’ s the word , and steady it is .
‘ Oh dear me , dear me !
I don ’ t particularly favour mysteries .
I thought I would say no more about it .
‘ Will you let me give you one , Mr Clennam ?
‘ This sagacious pig was fond of bathing in rich , moist mud .
Now , excellent Boythorn , let us go to dinner ! ' ''
<NAME> <NAME> , sir , your health .
I continued to live at the Cross of <NAME> .
`` My darling child , if you insist upon it !
The air there was charged with the scent of gathered grapes .
<NAME> , until you know how to behave yourselves better , I leave you .
Do you think she ’ ll weep ?
‘ But fashions are like human beings .
‘ Just , ’ replied the fat boy .
Then , <NAME> came from the window cautiously , and stood by the bed .
<NAME> and day , Mrs. <NAME> kept it standing .
Now , my boys , fight away .
‘ Mrs Boffin will be sorry to hear this , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> , has grown tame since he has been well off !
‘ And do you recollect them ? ’ <NAME> said .
I was put in the next room not to see you .
‘ I fear not , ’ replied <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> was lying back on his sofa , winking at his ceiling .
‘ Because it was so endless , so hopeless .
And sat flat down in the garden-path .
While they were doing so , <NAME> still sat staring disconsolate .
‘ Certainly not , ’ replied the little doctor .
‘ Good-night , Mr Headstone , ’ said the <NAME> .
Neither did he offer any consolation whatever .
He was to come and tell me all that passed , and he did .
They are sharp thorns , but they are such comfort .
`` Nothing has been the matter .
‘ Not at all , my dear , not at all .
All his fellows stooped to look under the carriage .
Mrs <NAME> took the friendliest interest in <NAME> ’ s making a good match .
‘ <NAME> ’ t he growed ! ’ said <NAME> .
'What if I pay it for nothing ? '
‘ <NAME> down , ’ said the fat boy .
' I would rather he was alone with me at the time .
In fact , I found him . ''
<NAME> Leicester indistinctly answers , `` Officer .
Then said Mr Merdle , ‘ Allow me , sir .
‘ Not without sneezing , ’ replied <NAME> .
You have been very ill , I know .
They make a fool of her , they spoil her .
<NAME> has money , and wants no more .
‘ At least she _must_ hate the <NAME> ?
worse luck , poor lamb ! ’ said Mrs. Sanders .
I asked , `` Does he give lessons in deportment now ? ''
<NAME> says he ’ s as fresh as butter .
It ’ s made him quite poorly .
‘ These are yours , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
He owed us immense sums all round .
I 'm away to <NAME> to bring that old lady here . ''
you know what I mean .
‘ I admit that I was accessory to that man ’ s captivity .
She blushed slightly , and cast a grateful look on <NAME> .
The <NAME> of keeping a Snuff-box .
inquired Fagin , parrying the question .
Now , you ’ re coming out and looking alive !
‘ My dear fellow ! ’ said <NAME> .
said <NAME> ; ' I do n't care . '
‘ Does the person want me , <NAME> ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
I can ’ t abear a meanness .
If your father had not died when he did -- Do n't be frightened !
said the book-stall keeper , looking in .
`` I wish to be left alone , '' said <NAME> .
Ben we call him , and so may you , if you like .
`` I am glad of it on the whole .
And there it lay alone .
<NAME> , ha ! ’ which was all the explanation <NAME> deigned to offer .
`` I do n't mean absolutely that , '' he returned .
`` And I ca n't , '' said <NAME> .
I do not see that anything is to be done .
But surely they were very quiet !
It is getting late , and they are not come .
With another stare at his comrade , <NAME> sought and found the place .
‘ Why , goodness gracious mercy , where ’ s your taste ?
You may consider that you do , but you do not , <NAME> .
Somebody always does it for me .
You know he is , <NAME> !
It struck cold and damp , but was not dark .
'Not a soul , ' replied the woman ; 'we were alone .
There are some books to be taken back , too . '
‘ I don ’ t care who objects to their being called the <NAME> .
The single gentleman ’ s door burst open .
I also felt that I had committed every crime in the <NAME> .
In general , more no than yes .
Have you no choice ? ’ asked <NAME> .
‘ There ’ s no time to tell you now .
And now , hosts of bewildering and confused ideas came crowding on his mind .
returned <NAME> in his easy light vein .
He was not reading now , but walking up and down despairingly .
But however , but however , he might have had amiable intentions .
‘ Talent there , sir ! ’ said the savage , nodding towards <NAME> .
Do n't stop here a minute .
`` It 's impossible to say whether she knows it or not .
‘ That ’ s well , ’ said the Secretary .
‘ Becoming. ’ ‘ Becoming what ? ’ said <NAME> , sharply .
Is there anything I can order for you ? ''
The difference is merely in a lawyer 's mind . ''
I rejoice to see you .
The <NAME> was all alive .
'Gentleness and care , ' exclaimed the doctor .
But I read it through three times before I laid it down .
<NAME> , upon this , starting up , demanded what I meant by that ?
I could not bear the presence of that woman <NAME> .
But I say she is so high , so very high .
‘ Nothing , darling ; nothing , ’ returned <NAME> .
`` They was a-eating of it , I expect , '' says <NAME> .
But it 's better than nothing , and better than enlistment .
If I were weak now , what had I profited by those mercies ?
It must be <NAME> . ''
‘ I am merely passing on , like the shadow over the sun-dial .
Moving On It is the long vacation in the regions of <NAME> .
I had tried hard at it , but had made nothing of it .
Do I excuse her for it ?
‘ <NAME> astonished ME ! ’ returned <NAME> , with a very serious countenance .
‘ You make my blood run cold , ’ said <NAME> .
Let me take your arm , <NAME> .
`` The very thing we both said yesterday , Esther ! ''
<NAME> green-peas were produced at <NAME> , and intellectual asparagus all the year round .
Consider it addressed to yourself , if you choose .
I know how she was lost. ’ Here he looked majestically at <NAME> .
There was a kind of settled trouble in the face .
A smooth-cheeked , fresh-coloured , sandy-whiskered man of thirty .
I am limited as to situation .
This was an unanswerable reply , and silence prevailed again .
I won ’ t answer anything else ; I can ’ t .
<NAME> ’ s of no use to me no more , except to live .
To <NAME> , as usual .
<NAME> home , sir , strike home ! ''
I am yours anywhere , everywhere !
I felt sure that some uncommon eye must have picked that girl out .
I am <NAME> of <NAME> , and that ’ s enough for me .
‘ You shall smart for this , ’ gasped <NAME> .
How much apiece was it ?
His eyes may never look at me again .
‘ This is the room , is it ? ’ said the gentleman .
‘ How is <NAME> , <NAME> ? ’ asked Mrs. Sparsit .
`` You shall have a dinner , old girl , '' says <NAME> .
I never saw him such good company .
Do n't try on useless measures .
There must be no mistakes in life with <NAME> .
`` <NAME> ought to consider it in the rent .
It was quite spotless in its cleanliness .
‘ I had got over it , sir , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Oh , don ’ t cry , ’ said <NAME> piteously .
It ’ s no use asking me .
‘ We must have a habeas-corpus .
“ Bad taste , ” said <NAME> , laughing , “ but a fact .
After tea , they had some music .
I have been walking these seven days . '
My opinion of those accessories was not favorable .
‘ It ’ s gone now , ’ said <NAME> .
You 're pretty sure that I 've got a motive .
I break down before the knowledge of what I want to say to you .
‘ You may go , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
I tried to say something soothing .
The advantage was too great to be recovered .
'Directly I leave go of you , do your work .
‘ I have seen the gentleman myself , and spoken with him .
Say it is thus with what you show me ! ''
But they were not tears of regret and sorrow .
Describe your father as a horsebreaker .
I know what web is wound about you .
Wititterly , ’ said her husband , ‘ is <NAME> ’ s favourite patient .
Likewise , for Mrs <NAME> NEE Tapkins .
<NAME> there reproach to him in the quiet figure and the mild eyes ?
‘ I shall see you soon .
Still she was going on before .
‘ Very well , ’ replied <NAME> , gravely .
It caught his sight again immediately , and he concentrated his vision upon it .
<NAME> <NAME> had not exaggerated the resources of <NAME> .
With a thump and a sound -- Old Clem !
<NAME> is like <NAME> in <NAME> ; at least its townspeople say so .
'Be quick , or it may be too late ! '
Do so much for my sake , and thus all ends between us ! ''
Two strange travellers embellished one of his rooms .
The parting interview has overpowered me .
He would never accept of help from me now .
You are not aware of half my humours yet .
I didn ’ t mean to stop you .
“ Stop half a moment , <NAME> , ” said the strange man .
“ You apprehend me very clearly , <NAME> .
<NAME> is also visited by a perception to the same effect .
‘ Where ’ s <NAME> ? ’ He couldn ’ t say .
`` What 's this they tell me ?
The deer , looking soaked , leave quagmires where they pass .
‘ <NAME> upon me , kill me !
<NAME> Jobling confirmed this with a sliding movement of his legs .
Nothing could be done but cut and run .
As I read it , I seemed to hear <NAME> speaking to me .
I wonder where they do go , by the by ?
'To what use can I turn this communication without you ?
So there can be no competition or perplexity between you and me .
`` I 'm something with a eight in it , '' says <NAME> .
I pledge you , but I deny the beauty .
‘ I am deeply sorry too , <NAME> .
Upon my soul , he ’ s a true knight .
All such circumstances were indifferent to him , so that he did his duty .
I wish his grandfather were alive this day !
The name of this article was <NAME> .
‘ No , sir ! ’ from the other .
It may be that he sounds a note of preparation .
‘ Well -- come in ’ -- he said , after a little consideration .
‘ Warm weather , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
Before she has gained the surface , she throws a summerset .
It don ’ t glimmer where <NAME> live , the sun don ’ t .
‘ I hope that wasn ’ t pride ?
`` I do , '' said I , `` quite confidently . ''
‘ Waiting , ’ returns the <NAME> in responsive confidence .
Let there be good fires .
They conversed for some time in whispers .
Who have found out the perpetual stoppage .
To this he hastened , as soon as it caught his eye .
As a child , I knew it as well as I know it now .
Neither , by-the-by , will he apply it to his friend <NAME> .
_I_ know him well , your worship . '
Not only was he not there , but his box was gone .
But , I saw nothing that in the least explained him .
‘ But such a woman as Mrs. <NAME> was , afore she was married !
‘ <NAME> out , <NAME> ’ am. ’ ‘ Gone out !

This desirable property is in <NAME> , of course .

‘ Would you like to see a whistling-shop , <NAME> ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
There was a good deal of dust , I believe .
`` No , no , my love , '' said he .
I have come too suddenly upon you. ’ ‘ No , no !
‘ What is the matter ? ’ I cried .
No , but that is not what I mean .
You have n't had the trouble of coming to ask for the little bill .
`` God knows , '' said the first , with a yawn .

'It 's not -- you 're not the person , <NAME> .
Do as you have done ; do no more ; and trust to J .

Alive or dead , that 's all I know about him . '
What more can we do ?
“ I will always remember it , dear Heart !
Leave me , ever dearest <NAME> , to <NAME> and to my fate .
You do take a reference sometimes , I see ? ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Yes , ’ said the girl , ‘ first floor .
‘ Of course. ’ ‘ At nine , ’ said she .
Do you mind that time when <NAME> was robbed of his money , though ?
`` Then vagabondizing came natural to YOU from the beginning . ''
‘ From <NAME> the schoolmaster ? ’ exclaimed <NAME> .
I do n't like your associates .
And soon afterwards they were realised in practice , and the board was spread .
One exquisite unhappiness that would have far outweighed this , <NAME> was spared .
She didn ’ t understand what Christopher meant .
What I wanted , who can say ?
For it only happened yesterday . ''
‘ Certainly not , ’ returned my aunt .
There was silence between us for a little while .
`` Do you know my -- guardian , <NAME> , ma'am ? ''
Then what 's a fellow to do ?
`` Then I s'pose she ai n't . ''
‘ From bad to worse , from worse to worsen .
I thank you very much indeed .
That ’ s your partiality ! ’ laughed <NAME> .
‘ I shall see you soon , <NAME> .
It may be inseparable from the discrepancy in their years .
My dear , noble , stately boy !
And I have the same feeling often -- often .
And still there is the same , eternal foreground .
He threw himself on Monseigneur for clemency .
'Do not speak thus , pray , ' returned the young lady , sobbing .
Permit me , for one moment ! ''
Mr <NAME> retired to nurse his wholesome thoughts in his own way .
Perhaps I am not as nice to him as I ought to be .
<NAME> and I were sitting one night by the parlour fire , alone .
Those are the antecedents , and the culmination .
`` Anything to vary this detestable monotony .
To men like me , they are sometimes useful .

cried <NAME> , starting off again , and going round the fireplace .
<NAME> made a running noose and called him again .
`` I am sure , Ma -- '' began <NAME> .

‘ <NAME> , sir , ’ replied the landlord .
‘ You know what I mean .
The <NAME> was playing cribbage with Mr Toots .
When I had gone to bed again , I heard him groan .
something so different -- ’ ‘ But your sister , <NAME> .
I passed at <NAME> six happy , quiet years .
‘ Yes -- the dry arches of <NAME> .
You to the middle , you to the right , you to the left .
‘ Why didn ’ t I ! ’ replied her husband .
Can it be so ? ’ She made him no reply .
said one of the women , stooping over her .
None at all , sir ! ’ said Mr Rugg .
‘ Nor the tiny woman hers ? ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> this as soon as read .
But it always went before me , and I followed .
You are not wanted here .
`` She could not find those places , '' said I .
‘ A nautical phenomenon , eh ? ’ laughed <NAME> .
Who had come from <NAME> over-night .
‘ And have you not been to bed ? ’ said <NAME> .
I know no Finching of either sex. ’ ‘ Ask your pardon , sir .
'It is supposed -- ' 'Now , <NAME> , ' replied the coachman impatiently .
Says his name is <NAME> .
If you please , I will finish the sentence .
But if you are not quite certain , never send .
I hope you 'll cheer up .
I tell thee it never retreats , and never stops .
The pipe is falling from his mouth .
I am perpetually turning , like a demd old horse in a demnition mill .
`` You are a jewel of a woman , '' said my guardian .
`` What were the swans doing on the grass ? ''
When <NAME> came home , he usually groaned and went down into the kitchen .
‘ Very low , ’ said <NAME> , shaking his head ; ‘ reaction .
What ’ s come of my milk of human kindness ?
`` Assuredly ; mademoiselle , I am thankful for your politeness .

I would n't hurt you for the world . ''
`` Nor the man to allow his junior to be walked over either ? ''
' A lady who is stopping in this house , ' answered the girl .
I want to speak to <NAME> .
His indecision was soon gone .
Nothing straightfor ’ ard , nothing on the square .
`` Yes , he took legal proceedings , '' said <NAME> .
I ’ ll throw myself out of window .
You ’ ll never guess , my dears .
Dumkins confidently awaited its coming with his eyes fixed on the motions of <NAME> .

‘ I think you are wrong , <NAME> , ’ I said .
‘ I ’ ll never come again , <NAME> .
I am violent , I know .
My picture was in her room , and I was in her prayers .
‘ There has been no opportunity. ’ I thought <NAME> was disappointed .
I am not the master .

For the truth of this , I appealed to <NAME> .
<NAME> appeared , pulled off his hat , and smiled .
‘ I do not know that .
‘ Won ’ t it do in the morning ? ’ said the woman .
They always die when I 'm at meals .

'No , no , ' replied <NAME> , 'not so bad as that .
Had not procured them himself , for instance ?

‘ <NAME> away ? ’ said the waiter .
I beg and entreat of you not to do it .
-- Let him never come nigh me .
I clasped my arm about her waist .
What shall I be next ?
It is Mr Carker the Manager who sits in the easy chair .
He very seldom spoke to her , and never to me .
So ended my last attempt to make any change in <NAME> .

I am particularly interested in his address . ''
It was the most mysterious and unaccountable thing that was ever heard of .
As to sleep , you know , I never sleep now .

I have forgotten that ) was suited to us both .
If I had had it , I should have hurried away .
It has been upon my mind , night and day , this long time .
Ashes , and dust , and ruin !
He did not seem at all disappointed ; quite the contrary .
'Brittles always was a slow boy , ma'am , ' replied the attendant .
“ Now lookee here ! ” said the man .
‘ Not likely that a man like you would .
‘ There he is ! ’ cried <NAME> .
B. shortly afterwards proposes Mrs <NAME> .
But I do n't know him , and he do n't know me . ''
<NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , or Death !
‘ Go on , go on , ’ almost shrieked the old gentleman .
But Mr <NAME> is in another sitiwation .
It ’ s clear <NAME> feels that they are all subservient to her father .
`` I have none to give , '' the <NAME> replied .
No harm will be done to the others .
I have written , gone there , entreated .
Give me your authority , like a dear good man .
`` Some other prospect has opened to him , perhaps ? ''
( I had come out of <NAME> last on a vagrancy committal .
‘ Only <NAME> , father. ’ ‘ Amy , my child , come here .

Now I know it wasn ’ t ! ’ ‘ Yes , it was .
I opened it and read it .
Besides , you have seen them only once .
We agree that you scarcely seem at home here .
Not the way to get on in life , you 'll tell me ?
‘ But you have followed the treasure of your heart .
I declare ! ’ <NAME> looked up inquiringly .
I do n't know what he can have done with the money .
It was the most conveniently organized place in the world .
she cried after a while , ' I never thought of this . '
<NAME> <NAME> was uncommonly convivial .
I find it was a false alarm about the wind .
Goodness me , it ’ s on , the end of my tongue .
‘ Now is this D. N. F. ?
She was worse at home than she had been at school .
‘ <NAME> down , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
`` Here 's that horrible cat coming in ! ''
<NAME> <NAME> had ceased to mind what he did .
Do you see this furniture , <NAME> ?
Mrs. Woodcourt never would let me change it .
The old gentleman laid one gun on the ground , and loaded the other .
<NAME> , you are up and away to-morrow .
`` Then she had better go . ''
You supposed he had come home ?
<NAME> , dear friend ! ” Nothing would induce him to speak more .
Where are grace , beauty , and blandishments , like those ?

‘ Why <NAME> ? ’ said <NAME> .
Oh , I am frightened again .
‘ Holloa ! ’ said the man roughly .
Not always the same thing , by the <NAME> !
'This is the woman , is it ? '
I ask your pardon for troubling you , sir .
There 's a cruel attraction in the place .
We all confirmed it from our night 's experience .
I could think of no one but my guardian .
‘ Would you take a merry-thought , my dear ? ’ ‘ Thank you .
<NAME> muttered some unintelligible words , but wavered still .
Will you excuse me if I forget your name ? ’ ‘ Readily .
`` Now my dear , you 're steady and quite sure of yourself ? ''
says <NAME> , resuming his breakfast .
‘ You are not likely to forget it now , I hope .
Of course this is not its best aspect .
‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ you are exceedingly obliging .
The night is bad , and yet how cheerful and gay in his eyes !
After listening a few moments , he made light of it .
why will they leave us some regret ?
That , however , still , is not the point .
It was a truth to me .
It might set Mother thinking about <NAME> ; she ’ s a soft-hearted woman .

`` I have had some difficulty in approaching it , and I still have .
No , Mr Clennam , I beg , sir .
But I am here pretty well every day , sir .
To every endearment and attention he continued listless .
‘ For a time , ’ Mr <NAME> submitted .
said <NAME> in a broken voice , `` remove me from this place . ''
What are you thinking of ? '
‘ I don ’ t know him. ’ Had he suffered from law-suits ?
What fine places of slow torture they are !
So sunken and suppressed it was , that it was like a voice underground .
Traddles in our room at <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Oh !

At nearly the centre of the bridge , she stopped .

There is no diversity of character .
'Decidedly not , ' added the other members .

‘ Hollo ! ’ replied a faint voice from within the bed-clothes .
‘ Wonderful man , <NAME> , ’ said Mrs. Leo Hunter .
Those are the last words I send him !
`` How curious of my cousin <NAME> to send us here ! ''
The name is such a good one .
I forget. ’ ‘ Loved me ! ’ answered <NAME> .
Well then , I ’ ll tell it .
‘ ’ Tisn ’ t <NAME> ; ’ tis his wife .
‘ Lie on ! ’ cried the usurer , ‘ with your iron tongue !
It runs in our family , gentleman -- so am I .

But don ’ t go out -- don ’ t go out !
‘ My name ’ s <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
Full of these meditations , she reached the church .
‘ Are you going to show ‘ em to-night ?
‘ <NAME> is your patient , nurse , to-night ? ’ said <NAME> .
Both our healths ! ’ Drinking the toast with tremendous stiffness .
To keep my little business all snug , I depend upon you .
'Did you see any of these pretty things , my dear ? '
<NAME> <NAME> refers to me in public as a promising young scholar .

'You 're a falsehood , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
She gratefully thanked him but remained inexorable .
said <NAME> , leading me to a chair and seating himself beside me .
`` The fog is very dense indeed ! ''
When I got better , I went to look at the monster .
‘ Not here , I should imagine , ’ said Mr Dombey .
By-the-bye , that lodger of yours is a most extraordinary person .
There ’ s a son gone : pretty little creetur .
'No more it is , ' replied the <NAME> ; 'Charley will talk .
At all events , it might have been borne by <NAME> .
‘ A blow , <NAME> ? ’ stammered <NAME> .
'What more of the man she had told them of before ?
Her look was very intent .
You are hedged round and round .
Becoming a sadder and a wiser man , he mused and held his peace .
<NAME> <NAME> has become your bosom friend .
He had already locked up his safe , and made preparations for going home .

From this she took the key , and put it on the outer side .
‘ Yes , Mr Blandois , ’ he replied tartly .
Taken in and done for .
“ <NAME> me in my ear , ” said <NAME> , bending down .
It was a hot summer Sunday evening .
I hope you will employ me , sir .
`` Excuse the apparent curiosity , '' says <NAME> .
That ai n't the way to get out of being common , old chap .
“ Will you take charge of the letter ? ” said <NAME> .
‘ Yes it is , ’ said <NAME> .
What did you think me after “ at first ” ?
Once , I kiss <NAME> in the cloak-room .
‘ Who had bade them to do so ? ’ she asked .
She drew near and asked one of them whose grave it was .
So strange to turn from the chimneys to the birds .
That was all she told me of herself .
‘ Shall we go ? ’ ‘ <NAME> here , let us stay .
<NAME> , starting at unwonted footsteps , creaked and shook .
That ’ s reasonable enough under existing circumstances .

All he asked of society was to let him live .
‘ I don ’ t know what ’ s the matter .
She is somebody ’ s child -- anybody ’ s , nobody ’ s .
<NAME> help him sometimes with your companionship if you can .
They were all leaning their arms on the counter close together , speaking low .
`` Old <NAME> 's wife , <NAME> ? ''
'Not at all , ' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat .
‘ Shall I read the passage to you ? ’ inquired Mr Toots .
‘ And such a man to speak , ’ said <NAME> .
They had shrunk past homeless people , lying coiled up in nooks .
Let the girl understand the fact .
‘ Time -- for what ? ’ said the spinster aunt coquettishly .
‘ Oh , <NAME> ! ’ remonstrated my mother .
Not knowing what to say , I sat down again .
Mrs. <NAME> then changed the subject and began to flatter me .
<NAME> <NAME> , dismissing his sudden anger , checks him .
“ The veil shall never cast its shadow on thy young brow .
This was in a whisper .
One other thing I felt it needful to touch upon before he left me .
Pleasant answered with a short dumb nod .
‘ It is apparent to me that I am in your way at present .
( You will find a fine sea-coal fire , sir . )
‘ It may have been his unfortunate destiny .
‘ It wouldn ’ t surprise me at all .
' I think not , ' replied Mrs. Maylie , taking it back .
<NAME> , '' returned the old man impatiently .
‘ I should think it would be a very good thing .
' I know his whole history : but we can talk about that presently .
`` It IS gratifying , '' said Mrs. Jellyby .
‘ Put my shoes there , ’ continued <NAME> .
‘ Nothing , ’ said Mr Dombey , ‘ but this .
‘ I have a pound for you , ’ said <NAME> .
I saw no other officers or attendants , and none were needed .
There it remained , motionless as she .
He wished it were , but no such thing could be .
Your coming here is an affront , an impertinence , an audacity .
‘ She may be safely trusted now , ’ returned <NAME> .
But the sprinkling was a swarm in the <NAME> cottage , and filled it .
Quite celestial ! ’ ‘ It often sounds to me quite devilish .
He said it was the very thing for <NAME> .
'Those persons are indemnified by me .
He was perpetually pegging at the floor the moment she left his sight .
It 's not as if I wanted a profession for life .
A good-looking fellow , and , in his way , civil and obliging .
It was long and thick .
“ I take no answer from you .
`` I have been sitting with him since ten o'clock last night . ''
The reservation was not intentional .
Though she was always staring , she never acknowledged that she saw any individual .
She said she must be hup and hout o ’ purpose .
`` <NAME> , why should you not speak to us ! ''
‘ Just so , ma ’ am -- and relating what I knew .
I am told people now call him The <NAME> .
Mr <NAME> laughed , and turned upon his heel .
'You will decide quickly , ' said <NAME> , with perfect firmness and composure .
Then came the dessert and some more toasts .
No , ’ she cried out , seeing the other .
She made him no answer .
<NAME> , my dear , you recollect ?
‘ Suppose she should be murdered .
What have you done to my best friend ?
We sat round the fire , and talked delightfully .
But what interest have you in recommending her to such a step ?
You have a good scent , <NAME> , -- cats , boy , cats !
<NAME> <NAME> lay at our house that night .
‘ Mama ! ’ cried <NAME> , joyfully meeting her .
I know you have one yourself too often .
She has been spoiled by <NAME> , and is amenable to nobody .
And pressing her son 's hand , affectionately , she hastened from the room .
‘ As a bandit , ’ repeated <NAME> , mildly .
Something he had long forgotten , appeared to struggle faintly in his mind .
If the funeral had been yesterday , I could not recollect it better .
Something had made her keenly and additionally sensitive just now .
<NAME> leaves in the <NAME> ; fourteen in company all told .
Mr <NAME> went up to the window , and hoped <NAME> was well .
Thousands of his compeers could talk much better than he , at any time .
<NAME> , could I have the honour of being your domestic ! ''
<NAME> has been said , but it is quite understood .
When I presented my bouquet , he gnashed his teeth with jealousy .
' I never heard the name , ' said <NAME> .
It wo n't take a minute !
‘ What do you mean ? ’ said I .
`` But do n't you know that people die there ? ''
The baggage of <NAME> is in his room .
I Corroborate <NAME> , and Choose a Profession XXIV .
What then ? ’ ‘ Can words hurt a dead man , <NAME> ?
You will find them at the <NAME> <NAME> .
May Heaven reward the old man for his forbearance !
I again inwardly repeated , wondering , `` That I could readily understand .
<NAME> characters to be whispered away like this ?
From him the child learnt many other things , though of a different kind .
“ Have another glass ! ” “ With you .
`` Bless you , and thank you , '' says Mrs. Rouncewell .
‘ You can not possibly be angry with him , ’ remarked <NAME> .
He looked up at the house -- all was dark .
‘ Two days and nights ! ’ thought the child .
My dread was lest he should turn his head , and see her too .
He did not know how much she loved him .
So now I am ready even for the lawyers .
`` I do , '' replied the <NAME> .
A girl came hurrying in , frightened .
What ’ s that game at forfeits ?
Now , I ’ ll tell you what , young man .
<NAME> listened again , thinking that the explanation might lie here .
I don ’ t know what ’ s come to me .
I would recommend a hasty sandwich . ''
My young friend , stand forth ! ''
So happy in this meeting !
`` What do you think will be best , <NAME> ? ''
This is a common case .
‘ My own Little Dorrit , ’ said <NAME> , compassionately .
That ’ s your voice ; merely your voice .
But that they both are .
`` Do n't you be afraid of hurting the boy , '' he says .
‘ Bad for business , bad for business .
<NAME> on ; there are but a few words more. ” He dictated again .
Whatsoever he looked at , grew into that form sooner or later .
I say she is sacrificed in being bestowed upon him .
But he is , ’ said <NAME> .
There , we left the river , and went on by land .
'You harden your heart against me , <NAME> , ' urged her lover .
He took his seat in silence , and motioned them to continue their speech .
Try a little inwention , <NAME> .
She darted to him , and caught him by the hand .
The door was ever closed , and he shut up within .
We shall hear more in the morning .
His face was turned towards her .
`` Let me see , '' said she .
On the third day of her being there , he noticed her .
“ I judged the person to be with him , ” returned the watchman .
`` Is the wind in the east to-day ? ''
'You _shall_ go , my dear , ' said the old gentleman .
But he says that he has two mamas , and I am one .
I have no interested views of my own to serve in coming here .
‘ This here Stiggins -- ’ ‘ Red-nosed man ? ’ inquired Sam .
He turned away , and tried the Lock-house door .
I live here peacefully and respected , and I am well employed here .
This delighted Charley , and her face was brighter than before .
<NAME> has announced <NAME> , which is the cause of her appearance .
‘ I am , sir , ’ interposed <NAME> .
I have a husband , wretched and dishonouring creature that I am ! ''
‘ I should be proud to know it .
I am glad it ’ s no worse .
The more retired we live , the better I shall discharge it .
<NAME> <NAME> utters a little sharp scream .
But I leave my partner to represent the firm .
`` From <NAME> and <NAME> 's , surely ? ''
`` He is not , my lord , '' said <NAME> .
Our venerable instructor was a great deal older , and not improved in appearance .
The immense relief of finding this a false alarm !
‘ I open at <NAME> the day after tomorrow .
`` No -- but she died to him .
And he 'll be in the same scrape again next week ! ''
Say I inquired after ‘ em , will you ?
On again by the heavy <NAME> roads for <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> nodded approvingly , and <NAME> resumed .
“ But you do n't know it equal to me .
you know me , do you ? '
And in obedience to the doctor 's impulse , home they went .
‘ Well , it is a curious coincidence , ’ said <NAME> .
' A pick-pocketing case , your worship . '
“ I told you you 'd get on .
<NAME> and <NAME> exchanged glances .
'Boy , ' said the gentleman in the high chair , 'listen to me .
Well , then , I 'll tell you something .
The cast was made in <NAME> , directly after he was taken down .
What could that old fashion be , that seemed to make the people sorry !
“ I can eat no more .
They do n't belong to him , and they never did .
Recollect we are not our old selves .
Then it soared higher , and grew broader and brighter .
I may not be able to face it out gravely enough .
The old housekeeper wipes her eyes .
<NAME> , and <NAME> , ’ were the next arrivals .
He was a sexton. ’ ‘ What is he now ? ’ I asked .
I Visit <NAME> at His Home , <NAME> .
<NAME> ! ’ ‘ From whom and what about ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
It was taken some seventeen years ago .
One day I was informed by <NAME> that <NAME> would be home that evening .
What to do now , I could not tell .
“ Very much. ” He said it with an involuntary shudder .
He said that was very doubtful .
Let them rest in it , and let <NAME> rest in hers .
Is it Mrs. Rouncewell 's grandson ? ''
P'raps not be there at all .
asked a grinning countryman , pointing to some composition-cakes in one corner .
She was the cause of our first little quarrel .
It was a deep plot for a large sum .
What is there on the reverse side of the picture ?
But he never was , quite .
`` That 's the <NAME> in <NAME> .
Everybody blessed the gentleman with the beautiful teeth , who wanted to do good .
You ’ ll hear his voice in a moment , <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> ’ t aware you had one , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
and wishing to speak to me ! ’ cried <NAME> , trembling .
No barrel-organ mended the matter , and no big drum beat dull care away .
<NAME> , you know , of course .
Oh , yes , it 's all right enough .
A life-thirsting , cannibal-looking , bloody-minded juryman , the <NAME> of <NAME> .
What you wish to be done , can ’ t be done .
' I never heard of such a thing ! '
`` Here 's the fever coming up the street ! ''
Here , carry me off to prison !
They shook hands with excessive cordiality .
You remember his remembering <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Oh yes !
Is this fellow NEVER coming ! ''
I am supported from above : do n't suffer for me .
I forget the precise circumstances .
Let ‘ em have that deed .
‘ Have you known them long ? ’ ‘ No , ’ rejoined <NAME> .
‘ No , no , indeed , ’ cried <NAME> .
And was affected with a cough in her throat .
'Come on , ' said the jailer .
Be crafty , <NAME> , and not too bold . '
Whatever I am , I am affectionate .
'It 's naughty , ai n't it , <NAME> ? '
Four horses out there for the next stage up !
‘ How should you be acquainted with any of her family ?
<NAME> and myself had quite a gossip while you were out with <NAME> .
What has he been guilty of ?
I laughed ; and <NAME> laughed and blushed , and went on .
You needn ’ t at all mind alluding to that .
What are they ? ’ ‘ <NAME> should I know ?
But how ? ” “ I am going to tell you how .
There never was such a curious man .
' I have seen you often , ' returned <NAME> .
‘ Why , what ’ s the matter now ! ’ said he .
‘ What wonderful thing is that ? ’ said I .
‘ She is an old friend of Mrs <NAME> ’ s .
‘ And wery creditable in him , too , ’ interposed <NAME> .
‘ I must go home , ’ said <NAME> , rising hurriedly .
By this time the news has got into the court .
He , too , is pointed out .
`` Do n't leave the cat there ! ''
My dear friend , will you come and see the gentleman ? ''
<NAME> ! ’ A very low and gentle rap received no answer from within .
Who was it who could win his wife as she had won his boy ?
He wishes to have a messenger at hand .
‘ Perhaps he ’ d better come in here , ’ said Mrs. <NAME> .
' I ca n't help it , ' whimpered the lady .
‘ That ’ s what I said myself .
`` Never , I hope , cousin <NAME> ! ''
How am I to get through the next four or five accursed months ? ''
‘ He speaks <NAME> ? ’ said the surgeon .
‘ But I tell you what .
( They all encouraged me ; they were determined to do it . )
You will spare me so far , and spare my husband .
Come in , <NAME> ; come in .
<NAME> answered with a little nod , and smelled the flowers .
Your poor sister is much the same as when you left .
They sat at his feasts , and he sat at theirs .
<NAME> , my dear , you may get ready .
'And so it was you that was your own friend , was it ? '
Anything wanting to the bonnet ?
<NAME> is unable to report .
`` But I do n't know it . ''
I bear it , and I hide it . ''
You 're weak and nervous after your illness .
'No ' ; said <NAME> approvingly ; 'no , you could not .
‘ To go on a little rational now .
<NAME> ’ t let go my hand .
<NAME> was not a man to be frightened by echoes .
Passing the evening with me. ’ ‘ Oh !
It ’ s put into his head to be made useful .
For many months I travelled with this ever-darkening cloud upon my mind .
‘ I should take more for granted if I were .
But I ’ ll drink it , if you like .
That your contemplated fraud shall be discovered yet .
What an idle time it was !
If they have so , tell me , and the good Lord forgive me !
I ’ ll be married in the bottle-green .
<NAME> without further ceremony entered a room there , and we followed .
‘ That ’ s your misfortune , and not your fault .
It now shone brightly , through the door of communication .
<NAME> <NAME> yielded his fullest assent to the proposition .
‘ We are older , Mr Clennam , ’ said <NAME> .
Why , or whither , none can tell . '
‘ <NAME> out of the shop !
‘ Me ! ’ he at length said aloud .
I ’ ll not allow that , sir .
‘ Am I going ! ’ echoed <NAME> bitterly .
But it war n't <NAME> as did it ; it was you .
There was a good deal of affection in poor Caddy .
The 'prentices giggle internally and nudge each other .
What are you thinking of !
‘ Isn ’ t it the truth ? ’ demanded <NAME> .
But this boy , you know ; we must have him bound .
He prayed a lot , but I could n't make out nothink on it .
'But you ca n't do all that , dear , ' said <NAME> .
`` This a most infamous coach .
<NAME> passed him as if she were in a dream , and hurried upstairs .
‘ A man of wrath ! ’ exclaimed <NAME> .
‘ One good turn deserves another , ’ said <NAME> .
With you , sir ! ’ cried <NAME> .
`` Distinguished , '' said <NAME> , `` by <NAME> 's presence . ''
He hoped she was not incommoded by the fatigues of the day .
No one attends on her but <NAME> .
Thursday arrived , and there was no alteration in the old man .
‘ Who will talk to me in those long nights !
`` You may tell me that I over-excite myself .
<NAME> news travels fast , and they will know it soon enough .
‘ It ’ s very unfortunate , ’ said my aunt .
`` He is the most tiresome of men ! ''
‘ But tell me , dear , ’ said <NAME> , soothing her .
I think I may shorten the subject .
It was of no use raging .
You can ’ t change the relationship , ’ returned the other .
He took his leave immediately .
‘ “ Disbelieve it then , ” says the figure .
Has an indistinct impression of his aristocratic repute .
‘ Much obliged to you for reminding me .
I reasoned with him , and pointed out his mistake .
‘ <NAME> much obliged for your good opinion , sir , ’ replied <NAME> .
He gravely touched his lips with his forefinger .
My wants are few and simple .
What is the intention of this fool 's play , say then ? ''
You find the long vacation exceedingly long , do n't you ? ''
The fat boy had by this time finished the pie .
‘ You were going to speak to me , mother. ’ ‘ Eh ?
Let us look at his infamous name .
For whom everything must be languid and pretty .
Get on your bonnet and come back .
I mildly entreated him not to be despondent .
He looked vacantly upon the crowd , and fell heavily to the ground .
‘ Does it rain ? ’ asked <NAME> .
It was at my corner .
`` Very like me before I was set up -- devilish like me ! ''
So would Miss Peecher have gone round his neck and taken care of him .
Add that. ’ ‘ Justified it to yourself ?
`` Everybody knows her , '' says <NAME> .
The moment he addresses himself to the Government , he becomes a public offender !
`` Why do n't you get out ? ''
‘ What if I put off in her and take a look round ?
But how quiet the streets are !
<NAME> <NAME> ran to the spot .
`` What , you have not forgotten it yet !
‘ What name ? ’ said the girl .
Under the President sat <NAME> , in his usual quiet dress .
`` Yes , <NAME> , '' said <NAME> , `` almost quite bright . ''
It was so thoughtful of you , so penitent , so good .
`` You know what you related .
Would she hear of his being slapped and beat by drummers demnebly ?
The <NAME> and the <NAME> XLV .
I knew it , I was certain .
They jumped into the gig .
`` Think you , '' she answers , `` twice two hundred times ! ''
The children drank the toast after her .
How can that be here !
‘ For those reasons assuredly , <NAME> , but for another too .
‘ How I should like to go , ’ said <NAME> again .
I couldn ’ t indeed , after that dreadful interview ! ’ said <NAME> .
The surgeon deposited it in her arms .
‘ What do you want here ?
Only me , ' replied a tremulous voice .
‘ He _is_ a fine little fellow , ain ’ t he , sir ?
“ Yes , ” said he , “ all of it .
`` The boy makes it one .
`` I wish it was , '' growls <NAME> , without changing his position .
Let them not hope to taste it !
He shall go with you , if you like .
The more <NAME> drew him out , the finer he came -- like wire .
‘ God bless you , dear <NAME> .
You ’ d say so , if you saw his moustachios .
‘ You shall be satisfied by seeing it .
I call it whatever THEY call it .
Who are such a relief from the crowd that are all alike !
I can not therefore condescend to speak of them as the <NAME> .
and retires to his former place .
It was some one else .
‘ Ay , and indeed plenty to think about , too .
says <NAME> aside , with his hat already on and buttoning his coat .
He had never thought <NAME> half so beautiful before .
Surgeons were sent for , and she sat supporting his head .
“ It is she , ” observed her husband .
‘ But IS the story done ? ’ said <NAME> , pondering .
' A regular right-down bad 'un , Work'us , ' replied <NAME> , coolly .
It wo n't lower your opinion of <NAME> 's powers .
On the grounds that I knowed his ways .
My wife and a lodger constitute my family .
'What name am I to ask for ? '
The <NAME> viewed the subject in quite a different light .
Mr Dombey and the World 52 .
The strong hand will never do ’ t .
I said , 'You are a man of business , I believe ? '
said <NAME> , the last of all .
`` Are you not going in , sir ? ''
`` What has been done to-day ? ''
My brother is <NAME> ; I am <NAME> .
he asks of Grandfather Smallweed after looking round the room .
He was only sauntering by and stopped to prose . ''
and take pains about it too -- before she got seated .
The bright moon is high and clear .
‘ Scraps of the <NAME> Prince ’ s nails .
Indeed it probably would be so .
I -- I mean to think of , and arrange .
I saw them begin in <NAME> .
Did you ever see a crocodile overcome ? ’ inquired my aunt .
Let us never think about them , lest they should pursue us again .
`` I do n't know what to do ! ''
‘ I suppose you ’ re <NAME> , sir , ’ said the servant-girl .
But I 'm a-moving on now .
Why , how you sob , <NAME> , how you sob ! ''
More clattering upon the pavements .
It ’ s nearly ready for ye , deary .
My name is painted on the door outside , with that object . ''
How is my little friend now ? ’ said <NAME> , encouragingly .
The wharf is some distance from the city .
But he wishes to see my Lady .
‘ I believe <NAME> found it dull too .
‘ Well , I ’ m afraid she IS poor , ’ rejoined <NAME> .
To give in ? ’ said the <NAME> , with contemptuous emphasis .
I can guess ! ’ cried Mrs. Gummidge .
When <NAME> speaks , _his_ speech is also thick and indistinct .
He was mortally jealous of me , and persisted in barking at me .
`` I pray to heaven it may end well ! ''
‘ I only make pincushions and pen-wipers , to use up my waste .
Almost as celebrated as myself ! ''
`` Though I forgot how much it was and when it was .
'If it be necessary , ' replied the old lady , 'certainly not . '
<NAME> friends with your new mistress .
With a sad and pensive air , he retraced his steps homewards .
‘ Any such ! ’ rejoined the mistress ; ‘ a-dozen-such .
I never saw her more .
What is that upon your face ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , ’ I said .
<NAME> , then , I want to know where those letters are .
He comes of a bad family .
“ Well ! ” he said , “ I was , and got convicted .
I had read of <NAME> in <NAME> 's letters , but not of <NAME> .
I 'm a man of business , and I took a squint at 'em .
`` You make too much of it , little woman .
‘ <NAME> ! ’ <NAME> was heard to exclaim , from the passage .
‘ How does that happen ? ’ asked <NAME> .
‘ No , my dear ! ’ cried <NAME> , elevating her hands .
The lame foreigner with the stick wants a top room down the <NAME> .
‘ You are enough to make me desperate .
Mrs. Snagsby indignantly expresses her belief that he is a limb of the arch-fiend .
‘ I am far removed from you , and may I ever be .
‘ <NAME> , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
It was the very house they had attempted to rob .
'No , ' replied the girl , shaking her head .
This is my little bedroom ; rather musty , but <NAME> 's is musty .
'What I say , <NAME> , ' replied the lady collectedly .
Communicating this by similar means to my guardian and <NAME> , I rose .
To-morrow , ’ said the old man .
<NAME> ’ s eyebrows resumed their inquisitive and perplexed expression .
The trooper thanks his informant and rides slowly on , looking about him .
<NAME> , do you go first .
‘ Say you have no such thought , dear Agnes !
A man of property , like me , is bound to consider the market-price .
So perfectly removed from commonplace !
Another , and he saw the face .
If they want a man to box at , let 'em box at me .
Tears are in his eyes ; the best part of his nature is aroused .
As to the first figure now .
What is there in her memory that we should dread ?
It had not lasted a minute , when he nodded and went out .
‘ Why , what else is it ?
The circumstance occasioned no alteration , however , in the behaviour of his benefactors .
Now , I know what to do !
“ We should look at this ! ” he said .
`` Harder than I could have supposed you would be . ''
Its destination was the old church of <NAME> , far off in the fields .
'Now , look alive in there , will you .
“ See ! ” returned the mender of roads , with extended finger .
There is intelligence in his eyes .
Anything would suit the purpose , written in the hand . ''
But don ’ t be frightened , I am not going to try .
Nothing more than that he would see me to-morrow or next day ?
'Put down the light , ' said the girl , turning away her head .
But he said with a struggle , `` You think not . ''
I hope so , ’ said the old man with something like a groan .
It is a portrait ! ” said madame , laughing .
‘ <NAME> has altered with me , sir , ’ said <NAME> .
I have heard of <NAME> being married .
I can do no more .
‘ It ’ s the finest idea that was ever started .
YOU would n't like it , I think ?
‘ He is sorry you are going , I am sure .
They are all accurately right .
How can you be such a fool as to provoke him !
I -- ha -- make it a personal request that you go to bed .
The means are ready , and shall be set to work .
‘ No , not a bit of it , ’ rejoined <NAME> tartly .
Restrain your youthful ardour for eight-and-forty hours , and leave her to the father .
`` That can do little for an unhappy mind , '' said I .
So uncommon grand with it too !
If I spoke sharply , dear , I didn ’ t mean it .
And I confess to the secret chamber .
`` What does he do anything for ?
Here ’ s a Stone ; three to me .
‘ I have always worn it round my neck !
There were some children staying in the house .
It ’ s too late to find another now .
<NAME> , are you a <NAME> ? '
‘ <NAME> ! ’ said the bald man , politely .
‘ So I should be disposed to imagine , ’ replied <NAME> .
‘ As a woman , ’ returned <NAME> .
I AM proud of this free and happy country .
My dear Daisy , ’ said <NAME> , laughing .
Though his services were rendered quite gratuitously .
Mrs <NAME> set that resolute old face of hers , and darkly nodded yes .
I told him that , without deep trimmings , the family was disgraced .
I assure you , Mr Dombey , <NAME> intended me for an <NAME> .
`` What name shall I say to my father ? ''
Covering a Multitude of <NAME> IX .
What does it matter , so that I have it safe ?
He is gone away , and there is no present expectation of his return .
Pressure came on , and you were done for !
He was an embodied inquiry .
Yes , he might and must ; Mr <NAME> insisted on it .
<NAME> would withdraw the expression he had just made use of .
How that word would have struck to my heart , many years ago !
It came to an end , and I was relieved .
He couldn ’ t have thrown a word at a mad dog .
‘ Splendid morning , gentlemen , ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> -- <NAME> of the <NAME> , <NAME> .
All you have to do is , to keep back the truth .
It stood before my disturbed sense of sight , but it never moved .
Keep a good heart , sir ! ’ said Mrs. Crupp , nodding encouragement .
‘ You are nothing better than a sphinx !
The morning among the trees .
You know what you are here for ?
Regularly executed , regularly witnessed , very short .
But is it good taste , is it good taste ?
Though I never could have been so rude , no , no !
So I said to myself , `` <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> !
It was almost ten o ’ clock before we heard the sound of wheels .
That 's what he and I agreed . ''
“ Unless you call <NAME> a he .
His countenance had resumed its usual benign expression , ere he concluded .
Now see if we don ’ t pay you out for that , sir !
He is now something under fifteen and an old limb of the law .
I think he knows it , though he pretends he don ’ t .
‘ Are you ? ’ said <NAME> .
‘ The fact is , I am not their father , <NAME> .
The other is his brother , the worst of a bad race . '
‘ I have been hasty , too , ’ said he .
I was but a servant and a minister .
`` Why , I never heard of such a thing !
He was apprehended -- committed -- tried -- condemned -- to die .
But I can not , and I revolt from the pretence .
‘ <NAME> , hush , my own dear !
The gauzy little bridesmaids appeared to suffer most .
There was a smile upon the youth ’ s face as he advanced .
There was a general start .
‘ And in the matter of fact besides , ’ interrupted <NAME> .
There , and through it all , my dear physician was a hero .
‘ But there are many places of shelter near here .
He was too penitent , too remorseful .
I was interested , but not curious .
And here is Conversation Kenge .
That was written , '' said my companion , `` when she rested there .
‘ I want to go a little more into buying-up queer bills .
<NAME> as it was , I heard it fall like a plummet .
Here is the parade , always at your service .
That 's what 's the matter with me .
Blessed Sunday Bells , ringing so tranquilly in their entranced and happy ears !
tittered the matron , parrying the question .
<NAME> , theer come , one day , that snake .
‘ I think I ’ ll wait , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Oh ! ’ replied <NAME> , looking about him .
`` What do you think , you two ? ''
Mr Merdle ’ s is a name of -- ha -- world-wide repute .
‘ What has he heard ? ’ urged <NAME> , colouring .
‘ He ’ s delightful company , that man is , sir .
‘ I wish you ’ d come and see me , ’ said <NAME> .
Come away -- out of the public road -- down the steps yonder ! '
Can ’ t we , united , pretend to the world ?
returned <NAME> with unspeakable warmth .
A fifth did nothing but spit .
So they both laughed , till they were tired .
The conversation was almost entirely sustained by <NAME> .
my life ! ’ said <NAME> , hurriedly , ‘ listen to me .
'Do you hear the gentleman , <NAME> ? '
Ever since my eldest brother left our cottage to enlist into the army .
I should think it very likely indeed . ''
And I asked her which burying ground .
I made him a bow and felt very much overawed .
Oh , what a state of virtuous jollity !
‘ I ’ ll tear your eyes out ! ’ ‘ Oh !
As he says himself , what is public life without private ties ?
The latter gentleman at once burst into the exclamation : ' A beadle .
I never know anything about money . '
‘ Hush ! ’ replied <NAME> ; ‘ a most melancholy history .
The subject of their only long conversation had never been revived between them .
I don ’ t remember who was there , except <NAME> .
The evening deepened into night ; midnight came ; no Edith .
He read that she was gone .
It is neither of the town nor country .
She had joined her at the window and was leaning on her shoulder .
You are young ; may you never outlive your feelings !
It 's certainly true that she came on here , <NAME> .
cries <NAME> with an arch look .
`` How do you know he was n't here ? ''
<NAME> , or <NAME> , walked at his side .
I am an adventurous character .
But that was long afterwards , when his god-daughter was past sixteen .
In short , whatever I knew , <NAME> knew .
‘ <NAME> , you fool ! ’ said the dwarf .
And still her former self lay there , unaltered in this change .
'Shall I shut the door , ma'am ? '
‘ <NAME> indeed , <NAME> ! ’ replied her maid .
Three days after that , he bolted .
<NAME> <NAME> was struck motionless and speechless .
As it ’ s not that , let me hear what it is .
Even <NAME> 's gallantry has some trouble to keep pace with her .
An unfulfilled impression , for he goes in again .
<NAME> <NAME> , here was <NAME> .
‘ The defeat may now be considered perfectly accomplished .
It 's wholesomer and comfortabler , and better for the health altogether . ''
I know very well you two did show to advantage , and managed capitally .
'Make room there for the gentleman ! '
<NAME> him that I never loved him half so dear .
He is the friend of my brother .
I have but one ; I can have but one . ''
I never saw people so happy .
It was a fancy to get it out of you .
She must have gone very early and very silently .
And I waited seven more days , and he never said a word .
What would you have ? ” “ <NAME> , ” replied the other .
`` I must shake hands over again with <NAME> 's godson .
Well may you say brazen , <NAME> ! ’ returned <NAME> .
In every single thing I went for , I went for you .
‘ Upon my word , I ’ m very sorry , very sorry .
Why should he do that , but that Mrs. Snagsby sees it all ?
‘ What cheer , bright di ’ mond ? ’ said the <NAME> .
‘ What , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Judas ! ’ cried <NAME> .
And your sister , she 's no worse than she were .
I heard you out ; hear me out , if you please .
I ain ’ t going to tell her .
`` She looks to me the t'other one .
in sleep -- and rose quite brisk and gay .
A sad story , sir , however you come to know it .
It may be years hence .
'Well , ' rejoined <NAME> , smiling , 'you can do as you like .
Can it be a truth ?
‘ I leave for <NAME> again , to-morrow .
Will you return with me and try to prevail with him ?
‘ Not to me , dear Mr Fledgeby .
All buttoned-up men are weighty .
Mrs. Snagsby silently lays trains of gunpowder .
I feel more than other people do , and I show it more .
Did you know I did not ?
He broke down again , endeavouring to bless her !
‘ <NAME> , sir ? ’ said Mrs. Sparsit .
<NAME> had never risen from his little bed .
<NAME> acted as fugleman , and gave the time .
The father urges , the daughter consents .
‘ You were formed for society , ’ said <NAME> .
I had no hand in it .
You ’ re the best judge of course .
This rather put me out , very often .
He certainly meant it at last .
‘ Never ! ’ said the girl passionately .
`` My <NAME> , my dearest son !
Why have you kept so retired from me ?
I have been looking forward to knowing you .
It is all , all over .
Sometimes the way so widened that she and her father could ride abreast .
He has no ears for this .
He looks into the second : not there .
said <NAME> , rising when he saw me rise .
<NAME> down. ’ He stooped , and she whispered in his ear .
‘ How long have you been cooling your eye there ? ’ said <NAME> .
being in a mind to go through life together .
At last , “ <NAME> ’ s carriage !
I did not know how to prepare him .
That 's about your intentions , if I understand you ? ''
Through such scenes , the family procession moved on to <NAME> .
But he always WAS a cheat , con-found him !
‘ I should be glad to exchange a word with him , tell him .
“ Ah , I dare say I did .
What wrong have I done ?
‘ Clara ! ’ said <NAME> , in her warning voice .
Who knows it better than I ?
He remained like this for days and weeks .
‘ What ? ’ ‘ <NAME> his rum-and-water , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> ’ t sweethearts call it so ? ’ she asks , pondering .
I expect him back every minute .
The gentlemen of the juries might not understand him as <NAME> and me do .
‘ If I cared to know , I should know already .
So he said : ‘ I must decline to pursue this painful discussion .
Never ! ’ ‘ Thank ’ ee ! ’ said Mr Toots .
how easily I carried <NAME> up and down stairs , now !
To know things otherwise were to be unfashionable .
I really , think it ’ s all for the best .
‘ I repudiate it with disdain -- with indignation .
<NAME> haste. ’ ‘ Come along , <NAME> .
‘ There ’ s a room , young man , ’ observed <NAME> .
‘ My love , you have had a life of hardship here .
; or grunting along in quest of hidden dainties .
What those treasures were , Mrs. <NAME> knew as little as they did .
`` To come up to it ! ''
‘ It looks like bride-cake , ’ replied the dwarf , grinning .
Everything expressed the abode of a poor student .
said old <NAME> , stopping in his work , and looking up .
‘ How you talk ! ’ ‘ Talk , miss !
`` My dear , I CA N'T think so .
gasps the old man , prostrate in his chair .
He comes to the dark door on the second floor .
`` Oh , guardian , what have I done ! ''
Six shillings and ninepence halfpenny on the very first day !
I have not been able to give it to him .
`` Cruel miss , '' said <NAME> , `` hear but another word !
It began to be rumoured that the jury would be out a long while .
why , with that head , is he not a benefactor to his species !
‘ The next verse is still more touching .
And they found it , as people generally do , difficult to believe . ''
It seemed so , but things are not always what they seem .
`` You are very hard with me , sir , '' said <NAME> .
`` No , my friends , it is neither of these .
Have you been advising him since ? ''
I am not a match for you gentlemen .
I felt quite apologetic for <NAME> .
“ This is a pretty pleasure-ground , sir .
Take me anywheres. ’ ‘ All this is nothing , ’ said <NAME> .
`` I think so , '' said he , laughing .
<NAME> was now announced , and we went downstairs .
Did you know another poor person of the name of <NAME> , miss ? ''
'So it is , ' said <NAME> .
It ’ ll be broad day afore three .
When I had done , he shaded his face , and continued silent .
‘ And I don ’ t regret it , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Not been to bed , sir , since it began to get about .
But is immediately frowned down by Mrs. Snagsby .
What do you say , <NAME> ?
What all we fellows do , we do to sell .
Why not that way as soon as another ! ''
There was nothing that a beetle could have lunched upon .
You are going for your own good .
‘ Bless your heart , sir , servants always do , ’ replied <NAME> .
And always gliding down , down , down !
You would if you could .
The children and their father were all in all .
`` I do not quite understand you . ''
<NAME> ’ t pull me back , and hold me down .
Consequently he always knew exactly what Providence meant .
Let 's go and look for him ! ''
And shark-headers is open to misrepresentations .
‘ Already discharged , is he ? ’ returned <NAME> , surprised .
“ I says , ' I hope it may be so .
Chancery justice is so ve-ry difficult to follow . ''
‘ Not once. ’ ‘ And not heard from her , eh ?
<NAME> <NAME> was not a man of this stamp .
‘ You know nothing about it .
' I should know her among a thousand . '
<NAME> had engaged to break the intelligence in <NAME> .
Going to have him under my wing , ma ’ am. ’ ‘ Indeed ?
I hope not. ’ ‘ False pride ! ’ repeated <NAME> .
‘ You are altered in a moment .
You know how dreadfully susceptible I am to boredom .
He had judged of his friend ’ s feelings by his own .
`` I 'll never take pains to dress you any more . ''
WHERE IS IT ? ’ growled the coachman .
Could I count them on my fingers ?
The road wound gently downward .
All wandering and lost , <NAME> .
`` I wish I had him here .
'You think women never can keep secrets , I suppose ? '
It was not the schoolmaster , <NAME> .
Not I , my loving cousin !
‘ I knew you would , my own , observed the latter carelessly .
There being nothing eatable within his reach , <NAME> replied in the affirmative .
Who is our friend , my dear friend ? ''
‘ I say , <NAME> , ’ cried <NAME> , reappearing at the door .
But when I buttoned my jacket , that was not much .
`` I have heard it before . ''
<NAME> <NAME> was an exception .
“ Wait and hope , ” we always say .
Your acquaintance with figures is very limited .
‘ You are wery obligin ’ , sir , ’ replied <NAME> .
Now I am cooler. ’ ‘ You have been ruffled , Mr Meagles .
‘ What did he do for you ? ’ ‘ Mr .
'And what about the other fortnight ? '
You 're used to it , and you ca n't do without it .
He bit his lip , and took a little time for consideration .
She has slept so very long .
He could make nothing of her face .
“ 'At last she is dead ? '
It was all that I had left myself , and it was a treasure .
for <NAME> 's sake let me go ! '
I loved her at that minute to distraction .
‘ I have already said , I fear <NAME> has not been understood .
‘ What is this about husbands and detestations ? ’ inquired the captivating <NAME> .
`` I suppose you ai n't in the habit of walking yourself ? ''
But if you do , I ’ ll kill you .
‘ Easy to say haul in , ’ answered <NAME> .
Ca n't you never let such an unfortnet as me alone ?
‘ Do you know what a cathedral is ? ’ he asks , jocosely .
'No more than nobody , ' replied <NAME> .
The vouchers have all been examined and passed .
And so she would have done .
‘ You want me , it seems .
`` Would you be so good ? ''
`` And they cling to me , appealing from their fathers .
<NAME> sat waiting in a corner .
In your heart you can not mean it .
‘ Ye be noice chaps , ’ said <NAME> , looking steadily round .
said the man whose duty it was to conduct them .
Oh do do do say somebody else !
I am to have a carriage , and you are to take me .
It was <NAME> ’ s lot to wait upon both kinds of change .
Let me hear it stated .
I never meant it to be known to anyone .
The ribbon ’ s round my little <NAME> ’ s neck now .
‘ I hope it ’ s enough , child , ’ said my aunt .
‘ What ? ’ said the old man .
<NAME> , <NAME> has ; capital , <NAME> has not .
`` In the north as we came down , sir . ''
He did so shortly and distinctly .
Who can gossip of an evening , under that shadow !
From mere force of habit , <NAME> in saying `` My friends ! ''
<NAME> <NAME> to himself , <NAME> ’ am .
‘ <NAME> way ? ’ asked <NAME> , wistfully .
We came from a quiet part .
<NAME> that humiliation to be put upon him by his own blood ?
Those lines and stays shall be rigged before you turn out in the morning .
But it ’ s not to be burnt on a Sunday night .
'Now , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> with a laugh .
Did you tell her where I had seen her ?
‘ Is he afraid of me ? ’ he muttered , knocking .
`` Have many people been kind to the children ? ''
'Yer a sharp feller , ' said <NAME> .
And you doen ’ t ought to watch and work both .
‘ Do you know how mama is , <NAME> ? ’ I said .
‘ You know me better , ’ said Mr Dombey .
says <NAME> , shaking his head and still composedly smoking .
Never been himself in this house since .
‘ The ball seemed so thrown into my hands by accident !
' I liked to see it .
‘ Not an atom , ’ chimes in <NAME> .
`` Do you know the name ? ''
<NAME> , come ; no more trifling .
‘ <NAME> ’ t you see ? ’ said <NAME> .
There is no change in my affection , admiration , and respect .
‘ Leave me , sir , pray , ’ said the young lady .
She went the way I had shown her .
I thankee , sir , most kind !
He approached the old seat ; it looked cold and desolate .
I 'll show you up-stairs , if you please . ''
‘ There is very little , ’ returned <NAME> .
‘ But I have said enough for the present .
Thus <NAME> passed the night before her bridal .
Agreed. ’ ‘ We come smoothly to thirdly .
“ I must think a moment .
Let us hear no more of this , we pray you .
‘ Why , he is a sort of monkish attorney , ’ replied <NAME> .
What 's the odds where it comes from ?
said <NAME> , not quite following the stranger 's excited description .
Here , there was another hysterical laugh , which frightened <NAME> very much .
‘ Yes , every one , ’ repeated <NAME> .
As to <NAME> , the affection he conceived for him knew no limits .
So he whistles it off and marches on .
‘ Well , then , he won ’ t , ’ retorted <NAME> .
I beg that you will NOT go on .
`` I ask you pardon , '' she mutters hurriedly .
We are hemmed into a corner .
asked the Jew , laying the same emphasis on the pronoun as before .
‘ Ha ! ’ said <NAME> , ‘ no matter .
‘ Enough to give a baby cold , ’ Mrs. Gradgrind considered .
You only undo what he does , and does well .
I have taken such an odd fancy .
I ’ m not going for long .
You never saw our dear father , sir ? -- A charming gentleman .
‘ I am here , at last .
The gentlemen cluster round him , and shake hands with him .
There was a change in it , but not of that kind .
‘ A citizen of the world has no habits .
what did THEY know about countesses ?
It was past midnight when I crossed <NAME> .
What weakness is this , my dear !
growled the man upon the floor .
I implore you -- I beg of you -- to rise .
The smile passed from his face , and he became graver than before .
‘ <NAME> ’ t I better work the while ? ’ she asked .
You haven ’ t eaten any breakfast .
‘ Nor I , ’ rejoined <NAME> , as he clasped it heartily .
You have heard my answer , sir .
‘ What have you learnt of her history ?
It is <NAME> , and <NAME> ’ s eyes are red .
‘ If you want me you ’ ll find me here .
That is , if you frighten him enough . '
Because he was told not to come .
I found the wadding of the pistol with which the deceased <NAME> was shot .
Help the gentleman to take her out .
I don ’ t think I have any other .
Whether I am deep or not , never mind .
Then comes the question how to meet it . ''
Em ’ ly , my darling , come here !
“ Can this be possible , uncle ? ” asked Mrs. Joe .
No worse would have befallen you .
And O there are days in this life , worth life and worth death .
But my straw really does belong to my business .
'This is a smash , ' observed <NAME> , biting his lips .
All this took place in the hall .
‘ Agnes ! ’ I said , thickly , ‘ Lorblessmer !
His visitor looked down with a surly nod .
In which some more <NAME> are made on the Stage of these Adventures 5 .
I do n't care an <NAME> Twopence for myself .
I haven ’ t any energy left .
First , our father was drawn -- slowly .
‘ There ’ s a back lane , too , from there .
It ’ s like old times. ’ ‘ Well !
‘ Who ’ s he ? ’ asked <NAME> , in his careless way .
I am under constant apprehensions , and in constant difficulty .
‘ How do you do , <NAME> ? ’ said I .
It is not worth one of them .
Nothing clear without , and nothing clear within .
<NAME> upon us ! ’ sighed my aunt .
Her father had seen the discovery being towed in the river .
with other pleasantries of that nature .
There never was a more unlikely possibility .
And a lively delight was in his eyes as he spoke to her .
When that man was a boy , he went to Westminster School .
<NAME> <NAME> , nevertheless , was glad to see the Member .
Five minutes hence we may be at daggers ’ points .
‘ To dinner ! ’ thought <NAME> , ‘ that ’ s another circumstance .
‘ In the snuggery , ’ rejoined <NAME> .
I couldn ’ t make her faster than she is .
This is my sister to whose charge you confide her .
‘ A very beautiful young lady , ’ said <NAME> , gravely .
' I shall see you again , <NAME> .
But do n't lose your temper .
There was a wharf behind , opening on the <NAME> .
‘ How goes it , my cherished friend ! ’ said he .
Mr Rugg , also , pantingly produced from his pocket a bundle of papers .
<NAME> Leicester considers himself evoked out of the sanctuary by these remarks .
' I 'm an Englishman , ai n't I ? '
‘ It would be so unkind to Jip !
There may be some motions of fancy among the lower animals at <NAME> .
I have ceased to carry my light burden up and down stairs now .
It was well that you should act the kind good lady to me !
Who is it , and what 's wanted ? ''
I haven ’ t made choice of one yet , but I shall soon .
“ ' A crazed young common dog !
It was a very dark night .
I ’ ve got into the way on it , you know .
If a murder , anybody might have done it .
And soon his actions made a most extraordinary reply .
What are you trying at ?
Transport him would be better ! ''
Well , I am so glad to see you .
I am glad to tell you so .
‘ Can you get it at waste-paper price ?
‘ I think that she is living , ’ I replied .
‘ No , ’ he said , ‘ it was not that .
‘ -- A chair ? ’ said <NAME> .
[ Picture : At the piano ] The song went on .
I know you like it .
The gentleman I speak of is one <NAME> Pocket. ” Ah !
Now , let me determine to think it out as I walk home .
replied <NAME> , pointing eagerly out of the window .
'You wo n't be -- ' 'Well , ' replied the other .
I do n't think she loves her husband at all .
`` Why did they separate , guardian ? ''
<NAME> ventured to look at the girl as they moved away .
‘ Get out , sir , this instant .
‘ What ’ s the matter ? ’ inquired the clerk .
The rest referred to me .
Can there be any sympathetic reason crouching darkly within him ?
But ’ tis too bad a night for that .
Have I the pleasure of addressing another of the youthful parties in <NAME> ? ''
Of anything like a youthful laugh , she certainly can have no conception .
The scar sprung into view that instant .
I might have expected nothing else from you .
‘ I have , ’ said the dismal man hurriedly ; ‘ I have .
That gentleman was fast asleep ; the restoration was soon made .
‘ Old clothes , ’ said <NAME> .
I can break it to <NAME> , <NAME> , to-morrow . ''
Do n't stand there , letting the cold air in , do n't .
I had thought of this very often .
‘ <NAME> Upwitch. ’ ‘ Here , ’ said the greengrocer .
'But she 'll come and see you sometimes . '
‘ He has friends here , no doubt , ’ pursued <NAME> .
`` And pray has he done so ? ''
‘ Let me out , ’ cried <NAME> .
I ca n't throw myself into an object so completely without expense .
<NAME> , overhearing , looked round , and flushed indignant scarlet to her hair .
‘ Dear me , my dear ! ’ said Mrs. Snevellicci .
Upon my unfortunate townsman all these incidents accumulated with playful effect .
How very acute you are , <NAME> , in finding my weak place !
‘ Not this time , ’ is the careless answer .
He is a rich man .
I have almost done enough , I think .
We spoke of <NAME> and Ada the whole way .
I am a man of business , <NAME> .
She changed as the door opened , and broke into a beaming smile .
But I longed so much to see you , my dear <NAME> .
It was a great objection , but not an insurmountable one .
‘ Good night , <NAME> , ’ returned the boy .
That shall be in <NAME> ’ s good time .
It always does at the sight of such .
‘ <NAME> ! ’ shouted the fat boy .
' I never saw you before , ' said <NAME> faintly .
<NAME> ! ’ and tapping at the wall , by way of applause .
This IS a gathering of the clans .
‘ Heaven bless you ! ’ said <NAME> .
He lived for it , married it , died of it .
‘ I want to know -- ’ ‘ Look here .
You will not think I speak for myself only , because I speak first ?
It 's a wonderful knocker ! -- Here 's the <NAME> !
You ’ re a taking me with you , now .
It was followed by another , and another .
You must expect no leniency here .
Open it with one of these here keys ?
It ’ s much better not to .
There , in the back street he found one , the Break of Day .
Is the teaboard still there , <NAME> ?
‘ <NAME> did he do it for , <NAME> ? ’ reiterated <NAME> .
‘ Certainly I will go , my dear .
There were times when <NAME> was not sure of her .
‘ Why not ? ’ ‘ You are sure to break it .
<NAME> him so , sir ! ’ ‘ Hear !
‘ Old Bounderby ’ s quite ready , ’ said <NAME> .
That money was no object to . ''
It was a part of her father ’ s misfortunes that they did .
With these words he disappeared among the crowd .
Do n't say it was n't done ! ''
Is it the town-talk yet ?
He had evidently told them all .
‘ Why , of course , I will _let_ you say anything .
‘ The letter about the mortgage has come , has it ?
‘ I have been tolerably well educated , ’ said <NAME> .
Hearts confined by cobwebs would burst at last , and then <NAME> was avenged .
These proceedings will come to a termination , and then I am provided for .
Are or are not our interests conflicting ?
<NAME> ’ thy oath o ’ thot .
'Just so , ' said <NAME> .
`` Just so , sir , '' said <NAME> .
`` I 'm a reg'lar one I am !
It was one child no more .
I like to know my fellow-men in general , <NAME> .
said the strange boy , when <NAME> had at length concluded .
said the matron , sipping her tea .
There she lay upon my har-stone !
'That was something in this way , war n't it ? '
Not prisoners. ’ ‘ Yes , there is , ’ said <NAME> .
Nevertheless , all the world knows he did it .
'Now , first : do you know wot this is ? '
I have many weaknesses , but none greater .
<NAME> to the time , appeared the carriage and the Secretary .
I think not , ’ replied <NAME> .
Several letters for <NAME> are upon it .
I demand to be sworn .
Those were the two little words , more capital .
After a long silence , he ventured to speak .
But I trusted to things coming round . ''
‘ What I say , <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> .
‘ Do you think it pretty , <NAME> ? ’ says <NAME> .
I hardly know which is best .
I wish you good evening . ''
said Mrs. Dilber and the man together .
But then she ought to get it .
I could not reply at the moment , for my voice failed me .
‘ Once more , ’ said <NAME> , and knocked again .
She had never seen him softened , and was much distressed .
He must have been asleep .
With the intention of restoring them to liberty .
The room was lighted for their reception .
why , where have you been ?
<NAME> had already started up .
In the meantime , days and weeks slipped away .
‘ <NAME> ’ r ! ’ said the Captain at last .
'This is a very comfortable room , ma'am , ' said <NAME> looking round .
He was sitting reading by a window in which he kept a few plants .
<NAME> have a moment 's patience , my dear .
`` But his deportment is beautiful . ''
I ’ ll pray for all , often , on my knees .
She had meant to be so different , that she reproaches herself bitterly .
“ What makes you weep , mama ? ” says the child .
The two look at each other again .
She wouldn ’ t , she wouldn ’ t , she wouldn ’ t !
We are bound to think of that .
was not at all discomposed .
I have observed her to-day , and I have observed her other days .
They spoke to him in very loud voices as if he were stone deaf .
<NAME> <NAME> is no credit to <NAME> , and he knows it quite well .
Or , for instance , how he set about it ?
‘ <NAME> , ma ’ am , ’ interposed <NAME> , very quickly .
They do n't know of him , but he does know of them .
Whether <NAME> knew where I was , I am unable to say .
`` But I see it , '' said the <NAME> , `` notwithstanding . ''
The mother was young and pretty .
The checks in the waistcoat are but the wires of the cage .
<NAME> no more about the lists ?
'No ; and neither he nor any of them suspect me . '
`` Not know what , my dear ? ''
`` Anywhere , my dear sir , anywhere !
Not a word was spoken in either boat .
`` Have n't I come to it , Mr .
O the days that he had seen her careful and laborious for him !
‘ Oh , pray don ’ t , Mr Toots .
<NAME> took down the address and gave her his .
‘ Well , I am sure , ’ he said .
he said as he did this .
Have they done it , or have they not ?
Shall we have some bread , dear ? '
‘ He-he-he , ’ tittered <NAME> , affecting cheerfulness , and gasping with agitation .
Then the little old man is drunk .
‘ I am not as good a girl as I ought to be .
‘ I have nothing to report , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
Have you heard of it , either of you ? ''
In this society , and where not , my <NAME> reigns supreme .
He now gave me a rouleau of gold .
It was impossible to restrain him , and the trembling child followed close behind .
said I , smiling , for I saw she wanted to go on .
The opinion of the <NAME> was divided respecting the derivation of its name .
The third man brought the dispute to a close , most philosophically .
Mrs. <NAME> saw what she could do -- always knew it from the first .
Certainly not to be expected to look well , poor thing .
The fact is , I do n't care much about it .
‘ Well ! ’ said the lady , watching her .
‘ Oh , yes , it ’ s all yours .
“ <NAME> soon what ? ” asked <NAME> .
There is something grotesque in it .
These qualities are natural , I implicitly believe , to the whole people .
‘ I can ’ t be buyer and seller too , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Quite cruel , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ I am at your disposal .
‘ No ; I dare say not .
We have both a great deal to learn .
This has made me secret and revengeful .
<NAME> , look upon the prisoner .
The pinched and meagre aspect of the place would have killed a chameleon .
there he is , d ’ ye hear him ?
said <NAME> with a droll look .
Would they be forgiven in the morning , or turned adrift again !
We ’ ll sit down and talk it over again all the way through .
‘ I ha thowt on ’ t , above a bit , sir .
`` I knew you would tell me so , <NAME> . ''
Thinks it was the plaintive 's air in which that report originatinin .
But what I do know I 'll tell you .
I think I will go down and see my old nurse .
“ You are a little late , <NAME> , ” said <NAME> .
‘ And now they are partners , ’ said I .
Daylight at last found them before the wall of <NAME> .
No , I was not a shoemaker by trade .
A very superior gentleman , <NAME> .
Mrs General rose and left the table .
`` Strange to have forgotten it for so many years ! ''
<NAME> thought how different from her own sunny little wedding , and wept .
They wouldn ’ t have owned me , and had nothing to give me .
Five-and-forty green parasols , at seven and sixpence a-piece .
He has been in the hospital , I believe ? ’ ‘ Yes .
‘ It is closing in , <NAME> .
Suppose it should break in turning out !
‘ Say nothing for him , if you please .
It was one of the wooden chambers upstairs , with the tide flowing underneath .
“ By the cathedral door , ” said <NAME> .
I knew that very well , before she told me so .
Her wall ’ s thicker , but say Mrs. Sapsea .
At least I do n't think I know why .
But this was not the change in her that startled him .
She spoke to me fur to tell him her trew story .
<NAME> tremblingly protests that she will observe his injunctions to the letter .
‘ What did he say his name was ? ’ whispered <NAME> .
‘ Here is the entry , ’ resumed <NAME> .
‘ A mere nothing ! ’ he replied .
`` You all think something else , I see . ''
I say , come to me .
‘ Such destructive extravagance , ’ reasoned his wife , in a low tone .
Ai n't it awful to see her so mad ? '
A few of these took affable possession of the establishment .
‘ Oh , nonsense ! ’ replied <NAME> , laughing .
I am quite confident you will be tender with me .
Then resuming his encouragement , he pursued aloud : `` Worn out , <NAME> ?
That your schemes are known to man , and overthrown by <NAME> .
“ I were , ” said <NAME> , with emphasis and solemnity .
That was the cot of _my_ infancy ; an old egg-box .
As I remember , it was almost midnight when we took our leave .
‘ I am very sorry , Mr Twemlow , ’ said <NAME> .
There are a couple of benches and a higher bench by way of table .
But I will say a word upon the truth. ’ ‘ Yah !
‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ Mr .
`` How do you mean , settled ? ''
‘ <NAME> word was that ‘ ere , <NAME> ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
‘ And do go on , there ’ s a darling .
My affliction might otherwise have had no meaning to me .
'You always gave that to him ' replied <NAME> .
The West-End destination of the coach , is the <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> was proud of making people acquainted with people .
For <NAME> 's sake stop a moment ! '
I never had such a night in my life ! ''
A charity to come to me , my love ! ''
‘ This is quite early for us .
The present is one of those momentous stages in the life of man .
One hour longer would have been long enough .
And to-night he was quite -- quite short with me .
You know what a house ours is .
<NAME> will not persist , my dear , ’ said Mrs. Crummles .
The dinner hour was half-past one .
“ <NAME> , ” said the imperturbable master .
‘ Oh ! ’ said the dwarf after a little consideration .
You can confuse the case , and turn aside the circumstances .
But I can not help it .
Then , there was nothing to be smelt but rum and sugar .
Mortality itself , sir , is a wisitation .
don ’ t speak to me , ’ replied his wife , sobbing .
<NAME> <NAME> , <NAME> , I will .
And the sweet pretty creature too .
He slowly drew forth the letter , and unfolded it .
We must get on by degrees , but we have begun .
‘ Matter , sir ! ’ cried <NAME> .
I think they are the colour of mine .
<NAME> _he_ been a-purwidin ’ for you ? ’ asked <NAME> emphatically .
What is it ? ’ ‘ See that now ! ’ cried the other .
“ To-night , ” said the man , putting the pipe in his mouth .
‘ That ’ s right , ’ said <NAME> .
Mind you take care of yourself .
‘ I want <NAME> to come for me , ’ said <NAME> .
she said in a quick , natural way .
A sumptuous man was the Farmer-General .
They persisted in withdrawing for the specified time .
And little <NAME> had brought it home for inspection only two nights before .
She had been dead two days .
`` No , '' said <NAME> , softening .
An exceedingly ill-conditioned , levelling person .
Then Mr <NAME> evaded , and wandered away .
Let us be just to him .
The pretty village face looks brightly up .
She determined to go to her guardian , and to go immediately .
Am I to call my own son-in-law , <NAME> !
What am I but another dreamer , <NAME> ? ''
‘ It ’ s all ready , ’ said he , offering the pistol .
Why , he formed Me that way ! ’ said <NAME> .
I know her sly manner of feeling her way with those gloves of hers .
`` But he do n't , I suppose ? ''
Why , who could long resist his lofty will and pleasure !
I don ’ t ask to speak to you .
‘ He is a kind soul .
‘ Because I ’ m happy too , ’ said <NAME> .
I dare say I do .
I must retain nothing for myself .
“ Yes , dearest. ” “ Yes , citizen. ” “ Ah !
The room is strongly flavoured with it .
The cruel mark was on her bosom yet .
The sisters had gone home , and she was alone .
Its deplorable peculiarity was , that it was the faintness of solitude and disuse .
`` If you believe you are a good prophet , '' said I .
Over and over again No .
It seemed a very world that I must search through in a moment .
‘ Who can help liking it ?
I never means to plead to no name , mind yer .
<NAME> <NAME> must have been born to be a blessing to us .
Never mind them , don ’ t look at them , but me .
Here ! ’ But the long gallery ceased to re-echo the sound of footsteps .
‘ Now , the second point , <NAME> .
Put them on the mantelshelf , if you please , <NAME> .
That poor lamb bowed in return ; polite , and terrified .
'You wo n't do nothing of the kind , ' rejoined <NAME> .
Yes , I had an uncle then .
‘ It was never bewitching , ’ she said , laughing .
`` Not with care and prudence and good help , '' said my guardian .
But what I have declared , I take my stand by .
‘ And never without a dog .
When I ’ m equally lowered all over , lethargy sets in .
At all times , <NAME> , speak the truth .
He walked about the room -- it was very lonely .
‘ Oh , I beg your pardon , <NAME> ! ’ said <NAME> .
exclaimed the gentleman in the white waistcoat , stopping short .
‘ And all of no use .
This was a hard hit at <NAME> , who was a bachelor .
There is not much affability in her tone .
‘ No one knows me there .
That my soul recoiled from punch particularly .
The underwriters suffer a considerable loss .
When they were gone out , I drew my arm round her waist .
The worm is at his work , and will soon dispose of his victim .
You doen ’ t know what it is to lose your child .
'What has the name to do with it ? '
`` <NAME> , '' said I , `` are you so cold ? ''
‘ Of course , ’ assented her son .
She ’ s my handsome and undutiful daughter .
<NAME> does a fine business .
‘ Now look here ! ’ repeated <NAME> .
`` In life I was your partner , <NAME> . ''
When I say you , I mean such men as you .
I tell you , sir , not a word .
Last of our visitors , there was <NAME> .
I lived in that valley , and its neighbourhood , all the time .
‘ We will try , tomorrow morning .
It would be blame to me and not praise , if I had .
There goes Friday , running for his life to the little creek !
`` I am sorry -- '' I began .
-- ‘ My pet. ’ ( The two last words were to the dog .
He was the sentimental son of a turnkey .
They stop and interchange a rather heated look .
<NAME> <NAME> came silently forward , leaving the daughter by the door .
`` Do you consider him in present danger , sir ? ''
But what was a girl to <NAME> and <NAME> !
This time , I write from <NAME> .
He can ’ t bear his name .
‘ What do you think of that for a kite ? ’ he said .
`` I think it is ready , '' said I .
cried <NAME> , greatly pleased and with the brightest of faces .
I 'm an orphan ; I live at <NAME> . '
`` Why , sir , it is under remand at present .
He is almost always insensible .
“ I do n't say anybody is .
Lived on a pair of boots , whole fortnight .
'None at all , sir , ' replied <NAME> , with much gravity .
‘ About three mile from here , ’ replied <NAME> .
No , I do n't never mean for to go to church .
I stopped , and <NAME> came up .
We are men of business .
<NAME> <NAME> and his friend were already there .
‘ Quite happy now , ’ she answered .
Suffer them and forbid them not .
<NAME> <NAME> puts on her approving face , and it 's done ! ''
It was natural that he should .
My gracious me , don ’ t you understand anything ?
<NAME> DRIVER ( to the horses ) .
‘ Your worship won ’ t mind her .
exclaimed <NAME> , alarmed at the serious tone of the old gentleman 's commencement !
But he is resolved on payment to the last farthing of his means .
There , as elsewhere , they had an interest in <NAME> .
<NAME> , too , took pains to present me in the worst light .
That I do so is no subject for regret or grief .
To the pleasure of seeing you once more !
Send one of your madmen to get me a bottle of wine .
'He said he wanted to . '
‘ Of their manners , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ I say nothing .
And then they went on arm-in-arm , very lovingly together .
<NAME> followed him with her eyes , and looked intently in his face .
Several People delighted , and the Game Chicken disgusted 57 .
‘ Paint at all ? ’ ‘ Not at all , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ They all ask the same question .
A dread falls on me here .
`` You are right , little woman , '' he answered .
‘ This is the country , <NAME> , ’ said the writer .
‘ No , <NAME> , ’ returned my mother , ‘ but you insinuated .
Having got so far , <NAME> needed no second bidding .
You do n't mind sleeping among the coffins , I suppose ?
He would listen neither to reason , feeling , nor justice .
We should have no peace in our place , if that got touched upon .
said the housekeeper , watching the direction of <NAME> 's eyes .
<NAME> , she have twenty pound down .
<NAME> , right reverends and wrong reverends of every order .
The <NAME> of a Dunghill -- “ ’ ‘ Eh ?
‘ I can wait , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Devilish little , I ’ m sorry to say , ’ replied <NAME> .
I must n't look to individuals .
That 's a Blazing strange message .
‘ You wouldn ’ t have me go away again ? ’ ‘ Oh !
<NAME> returned at this juncture .
‘ Then I believe that ’ s all , ’ said the lady .
<NAME> circumstances , too , had occurred to increase his suspicion .
I can ’ t bear to hear it .
They closed ; opened again ; closed once more ; again opened .
Indeed the mistake was mine , and I ought to apologize for it . ''
He never spoke otherwise than interrogatively .
<NAME> right opposite the stairs . ''
In all the public places of <NAME> , this filthy custom is recognised .
Without presuming to give my opinion on this question , I delivered my message .
Consider yourself accountable to me .
You have addressed <NAME> , <NAME> .
'Hold your tongue , sir , ' said <NAME> .
How I come to be interested , I need not explain .
<NAME> care what you ’ re about , in this new half .
`` But I mean in professional attendance , medical attendance . ''
`` Do you mean what business have we come upon ? ''
He said nothing at all .
<NAME> , dust , and waste-paper were all over the house .
‘ Now , how do you feel ? ’ said Mr Boffin .
But he may have merited it .
‘ The gal , ’ returned the boy .
‘ I don ’ t know what to call it , ’ I replied .
‘ And what are you now ?
`` Most willingly , '' he retorted , `` if I could .
Except one man , who got up and went out .
The door and window of the vacant room being open , we looked in .
‘ What ’ s the matter , sir ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
( <NAME> yer hi on his ears . )
<NAME> ’ t I ? ’ ‘ Yes , <NAME> , yes .
<NAME> and pick a bit , my pretty .
-- Wished <NAME> only to know what would be serviceable to her .
He blushed very much at finding himself among strangers , and chuckled aloud .
‘ <NAME> to me , Wally , listen to me .
His lips were bloodless , and his bones sharp and thin .
You know why , and you are her father .
Do you want to rob me , or to murder me ?
<NAME> , I assure you , to the bone ! ''
I should think so , deary ! ’ cried <NAME> .
cries <NAME> , cutting him short .
Alice got up , took off her wet cloak , and laid it aside .
When she pressed me to take wine , I took water .
‘ “ Is she gone ? ” he eagerly inquired .
I beg your son to receive the assurance of my profound consideration .
He 'll have no more on you .
‘ Why , yes , ’ said the attorney , with a slight cough .
she has been at her glass since she recovered .
‘ They ’ re playful , <NAME> my dear ; they ’ re playful .
Oh , it 's all right enough !
Oh yes , you 're eligible ! ” said <NAME> .
`` He is alive , at any rate , '' says <NAME> .
This fellow , <NAME> , presumes to be impertinent to me , <NAME> .
<NAME> , ’ said the spare waiter .
‘ But we have much to be thankful for .
‘ I am very sensible of this attention .
Such a woman as she ought to be , after all this .
I like it very much indeed .
<NAME> <NAME> was a master now , in another school , under another head .
‘ Did he though ? ’ inquired another cabman .
‘ I positively sometimes can ’ t believe it , ’ said <NAME> .
Where is he ? ” ’ ‘ Who ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
<NAME> and he were partners for I do n't know how many years .
There was an uneasy movement among them , but nobody spoke .
I saw you doing it . ''
He goes to his crossing and begins to lay it out for the day .
The irascible <NAME> scratches the air .
‘ Nor from me ? ’ said <NAME> .
‘ A most engaging little Beauty ! ’ said <NAME> , taking my arm .
‘ <NAME> ten minutes. ’ ‘ Done ! ’ responded <NAME> .
<NAME> has been in such a state of impatience to come !
'And make your fortun ' out of hand ? '
Anything that I had seen in <NAME> Havisham ?
No such hope dawned upon me .
We must all agree in that .
The housekeeper has dropped her voice to a little more than a whisper .
`` Now , be happy , child , under better circumstances .
I don ’ t know who would have a child , for my part !
Little Jane is the same .
‘ What will she ever do ! ’ sobbed Minnie .
' I should not let you depart from me thus . '
He had left his card three times .
<NAME> <NAME> , if it comes to that , let _me_ go .
I so dread being awful .
<NAME> sign on door-post ; chequered human life .
‘ We WILL be happy , ’ replied the old man hastily .
‘ Trained you down very low , it has !
Of course he knew about my father from his connection with <NAME> .
My dear , face Mr Chivery .
We 're all suitable to our calling , we 're well matched .
I ’ m too sticky to be kissed .
I have never seen her since .
‘ More than three hundred pounds .
That 's a question I must not be asked .
'So do I , ' rejoined the undertaker .
‘ You _are _swindlers. ’ ‘ Very good , ’ said <NAME> .
No , <NAME> , I should think not .
He has answered , ‘ Not exactly. ’ <NAME> was adopted by his mother ?
`` <NAME> , I am quite aware of it .
What will be , will be .
‘ Just wait a moment , <NAME> !
We are a prosperous community , <NAME> , a very prosperous community .
<NAME> is a witness what nervous jerkings I have in my legs .
she says , touching her shoulder with her two forefingers .
He was there. ’ ‘ Who is he ? ’ said <NAME> .
The child involuntarily did the same .
‘ I saw the sudden change that came upon him beneath my gaze .
What DO you know of him ? '
Exactly what was perfectly manifest to me at the moment .
But she answered him very steadily .
`` I have only waited to see that you have everything you want .
<NAME> <NAME> and he interchange a word or two .
<NAME> <NAME> lent me the knife and fork , with his compliments to <NAME> .
‘ I have written to him , ’ said my aunt .
‘ Then you were -- ’ faltered <NAME> .
'Three Cripples , ' repeated <NAME> , 'and a very good sign too .
‘ Oh yes , ’ rejoined the child , clasping her hands earnestly .
No father , no mother , no any one .
We shan ’ t be legally for a day or two .
<NAME> , and begs -- ' '' said <NAME> .
‘ See where he lounges so easily , <NAME> !
‘ My grand-nephew , that is to say , ’ observed my aunt .
<NAME> <NAME> inquires , getting his hat and thick wash-leather gloves .
Neither , I felt convinced , had Mrs. Strong then .
Go you in alone ; I wait near .
cried the man , fixing his eyes on <NAME> , and suddenly recoiling .
I ’ m coming into my property , that ’ s the fact .
Gradually I slipped from the chair and lay on the floor .
‘ Open , you Bob ! ’ <NAME> opened .
You ’ ll want six , ’ said the dress-maker .
I thought I knew why .
We may as well part .
`` How glad am I to see you , <NAME> ! ''
‘ She don ’ t care for me !
'Good , ' said the <NAME> ; 'there 's no moon . '
I have heard of such means sometimes .
He had been more than five hours gone : where could he be ?
And she is so very pretty !
‘ All right , sir , ’ said <NAME> .
His feelings are worked upon .
I know you do , I know you do .
My wife was a foreman 's daughter , and plainly brought up .
We waited for <NAME> , and he made no sign .
cried the matron , with a gesture as if she would call for help .
What have I done ? ’ ‘ Let me go away , <NAME> .
'He ought to have been , a many times , ' replied the jailer .
She was quiet once more .
`` What of that , my dear ! ''
<NAME> took out her handkerchief , and rather angrily wiped her eyes .
That would protract the mental uneasiness of Mr Venus too long , he said .
For a few moments they stood motionless .
I think he loves me , ’ cried the child wildly .
“ And his wife and child .
I have often seen these among old <NAME> people and <NAME> .
The means of corruption , wretchedness , and misery .
Its internal accommodations amply fulfilled the promise of the outside .
Have you rung the bell ? ''
I ask you nothing but what your own emphasis suggests .
Is this public business ? ’ asked <NAME> junior .
‘ Dinnot be afeared on it .
But at all events , <NAME> -- I may call you <NAME> ? ''
‘ It is , as you say , quite a form to ask .
‘ My dear , ’ returned the <NAME> , stopping short in his trot .
But what did I think ?
I scarcely knew him again , he was so uncommonly smart .
How do you find <NAME> C. looking , <NAME> ? ''
The address was solemn and impressive ; the sentence fearful to hear .
The rigid , upturned , marble feet too , he remembered well .
At this moment , the bell rang .
Upon my soul I am not .
`` No doubt that 's the cause .
‘ Are you unwell , <NAME> ? ’ whispered <NAME> .
They are much inclined to moralise .
`` So much the poorer you ; so much the richer I !
I am going straight home , and shall remain at home to-morrow until noon .
said the Jew , turning rather pale .
Have you found it ? ” “ Here it is , ” said <NAME> .
Well , <NAME> , and how are you ?
My sister 's bringing up had made me sensitive .
‘ I am ruined , my dear Trot !
Would <NAME> be considered intrusive ?
I wish I may die if I do !
‘ When was it , that I first began ?
'What a precious muddle-headed chap you are ! '
And the man came on .
I really don ’ t know what is the matter .
<NAME> and <NAME> has been in a dreadful state for some weeks .
What ’ s that ? ’ demanded Mr Boffin .
Both father and son salute the trooper heartily .
Who was that , that dashed it from his lips ?
But I have no such tenderness .
'Do you hear me , some of you ?
In these discussions , <NAME> bore no part .
`` And how do you get on ? ''
'Good , ' said <NAME> , regarding her attentively .
And she IS an inconvenient woman .
Who so unconscious of all associations connected with the spot , as he !
As between yourself and myself , I know I may be .
‘ <NAME> was they ? ’ ‘ <NAME> ’ to this here effect .
They began to speak of their separate plans .
‘ Ah Heaven , then , ’ said she .
This was a T , -- Twist , I named _him_ .
‘ I did not think of it .
‘ She has met with some large losses .
<NAME> DRIVER ( louder than before ) .
You brought your adoration and your portmanteau here together .
It ’ s a capital prescription , sir .
How could I forget it ?
‘ I see , ’ said <NAME> , with dignity .
Might I ask the favour ?
`` Do n't drop that oil upon the blankets , now . ''
‘ “ It was _not _the echoes , ” said the goblin .
‘ I have made no bargain .
I -- I always understood so , ’ said Mr Fledgeby .
‘ No , ’ replied <NAME> , ‘ not yet .
‘ We shall not make this the better by being grim .
‘ The licence ! ’ said <NAME> , blushing .
' I have nothing to disclose , ' rejoined <NAME> .
‘ How came you to think of resting there ? ’ he said .
‘ Why , you know not , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Even have the honour of being a connexion of yours .
<NAME> ’ t I say so now ?
This is the acknowledgement I WILL HAVE .
‘ Give him that card if you please , ’ rejoined <NAME> .
The quiet house had grown more dismal since she came down .
says the constable , eyeing him aside with ineffable disdain .
<NAME> or servant , she has a purpose in her and can follow it .
You oughtn ’ t to be anybody ’ s proprietor , Mr Clennam .
To have something in for my money . ''
Mrs. <NAME> shook her head and put her handkerchief to her eyes .
exclaimed <NAME> , darting an angry look at his pupil .
All things considered , therefore , <NAME> was not so very , very bad .
‘ <NAME> ’ t fly from unfortunate man in shattered state of health .
But he is so sick and miserable that even hunger has abandoned him .
I am determined to do it .
‘ Beg your pardon , sir ? ’ ‘ Where does he sleep ?
‘ He has no particular walk ? ’ said Mr Dorrit .
`` Do n't say nothing done , sir , '' returns the placid <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> , what is that stone arm raised to strike me ?
‘ Not a bore , I hope ?
They leaped the gap in a moment , and went upon their way .
<NAME> ! ” The night comes on dark .
Probably at about the period when they began to dine on the <NAME> charity .
‘ This is my sister <NAME> , this is .
Nor am I so much ashamed of the place itself as might be supposed .
`` This is wonderfully fine wine , sir ! ''
and she felt that it could never more come back .
Let me stay here , and be a servant .
But it _is_ so ridiculous ! ’ <NAME> ’ s eyes demanded what was .
I answered in all earnestness , `` Quite . ''
Everything held in confusion and indecision until then !
You bring the lot to me , at that old Battery over yonder .
The Chief <NAME> , erect and calm , replied in these memorable words .
‘ Sweet , indeed ! ’ said Mrs. Wititterly , with a sigh .
What do you want with me ? ''
‘ <NAME> up , old Mawther ! ’ ( <NAME> meant old girl . )
My ‘ First Half ’ at <NAME> VIII .
Let the <NAME> rest. ’ ‘ Yes , rest !
`` There 's the saucepan that the gruel was in ! ''
‘ Two years ago I came to <NAME> .
You ’ re so like him , <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> seemed gruff , and answered drily .
Not much in that , you 'll say , <NAME> , <NAME> .
They were seated now , near together .
You can ’ t do it too soon , ’ said Mr Meagles .
But I thank her for it .
‘ Curious circumstance about those initials , sir , ’ said <NAME> .
He was not there , and she was sleeping soundly .
‘ ’ Tan ’ t that I forgive her .
The next day but one was Saturday , and a holiday .
I purposely abstain from extending these observations to any length .
The next question was how Mrs. Jellyby should be dressed on the occasion .
This state of things had been brought about by divers means and workings .
‘ You alter it every day , ’ said <NAME> .
“ A so-and-so , ” says the man .
I Am a <NAME> Boy in More Senses Than One XVII .
Did you think I did ? ’ <NAME> shook his head .
Unless I am much mistaken , I saw that I did so .
He is not come yet .
<NAME> <NAME> emptied his glass and recalled the ladies .
Once. ’ ‘ What kind of man ? ’ ‘ Not young .
No price could make it do .
But now I was frightened again , and ran home without stopping .
I claim to deserve it .
‘ We may rely on your friendly help ? ’ she said .
Beyond these manifestations of anxiety , he stirred not hand or foot .
And his father is dependent on him in the <NAME> of <NAME> .
I was so far right , that she had no other companion .
He looked at the speaker and recognised Mr Meagles .
Say what you have to say , if you please . ''
‘ You ’ ll be the oldest inhabitant soon .
“ I salute you , citizeness , ” from the Doctor .
“ I made it , ” said <NAME> , “ my own self .
The barriers were too many and too high for such a leap .
I knew how she loved him .
Descriptive of an affecting <NAME> between <NAME> and a <NAME> .
I heard her steps proceed to the pantry .
Yes , my dear sir -- half a dozen of ‘ em here .
It beat the other one , all to nothing .
But I am worn out .
I thank you , no , not a morsel .
No ! ” imperiously stopping me as I opened my lips .
That first unlucky obligation , I have paid .
So I held my peace .
‘ Quite soon enough for you .
<NAME> sat up in bed , and rubbed his eyes to dispel the illusion .
`` For you , miss , if you please , '' said she .
In the twilight they were always together .
<NAME> observed that the situation was exposed on a sharp night .
Therefore I glanced at him as we walked on together , but said nothing .
`` Snagsby , '' says <NAME> , `` look over the room for him .
I didn ’ t intend to tell you to hold your tongue .
`` There has been a discovery there to-day .
‘ Well , I ’ m very glad to hear it !
I knew she always was , to all .
The vehicle was not exactly a gig , neither was it a stanhope .
But he loved his son with all the love he had .
I think we had better not enter into particulars at home .
She had but then known that her child was living .
'He 'd be cheap with nothing at all , as a premium .
exclaimed <NAME> , imprinting a kiss upon his ugly face .
`` Pray be seated , <NAME> . ''
She was gliding timidly away again , when she was arrested by the governess .
‘ Oh , ah , I forgot that , ’ said <NAME> .
They can do anything they like .
‘ Oh , it ’ s not her <NAME> name .
Then I go among the <NAME> .
‘ Is that <NAME> ? ’ said <NAME> , looking towards it .
Let us go , my angel .
It seemed too good to be true .
‘ I should imagine not , indeed ! ’ said <NAME> , quietly .
It was a mean , shabbily furnished room , with a bed in it .
‘ And what becomes of you , my pretty one ? ’ ‘ Me !
Not to anyone but you .
The contracting parties were R. <NAME> , and <NAME> .
`` My love , you know these two gentlemen ? ''
I declare again it ’ s a shame !
The two robbers issued forth with <NAME> between them .
cried <NAME> , running up to the chaise-door .
Do not blame the mother for her share .
The work she did that day !
She sat up at night still , and watched .
You 're half the fun of the fair in the Court of Chancery .
'Now , sir , tell him what you want .
He ’ s honest , you know , quite honest .
You have interrupted my little project .
“ O yes , I dare say ! ” said the turnkey .
‘ I have been to him , and he is not at home .
Such an inflexible little woman , too , through all ! ''
At first , the man is stunned .
‘ <NAME> , sir ! ’ growled the schoolmaster , turning round .
An equipage for a <NAME> .
'In good time I 'll tell you . '
I was sure of it .
Mr <NAME> had been a little fidgety , and now struck in .
I found my aunt , in our house , sitting up for me .
They sat at lunch in Mrs <NAME> ’ s own boudoir .
But you would have heard of him , even if he were dead !
Presently she asks again , is he gone YET ?
‘ You won ’ t go home till morning .
‘ Here he is again ! ’ said <NAME> .
‘ There is some unfortunate division between them , ’ I replied .
This referred to a specific page in the printed book .
I COULD answer your questions , miss , but duty forbids it .
Is it only a small crack , or a out-and-out smash ?
my life ! ’ rushed into Mrs. Micawber ’ s arms .
But not without a certain uncomfortable sensation gliding down his back .
But she remained in her own chamber , and <NAME> saw nothing of her .
`` A little too boisterous -- like the sea .
I will know where they are .
I passed that off , and brought <NAME> on the carpet .
But , gradually the change stole upon him that it became dreadful to himself .
There was a clock in the outer wall of this house .
You appear at a good time .
`` Remiss in anything , my dear ! ''
‘ Now I have found it .
It 's not all Jarndyce , in fact as well as in name .
That ’ s why I should like so much to be a lady .
Let us make one more round of the garden , and then go in .
‘ She ’ d find me out , wherever I went .
returned the old man with a wonderfully suspicious flash of his eye .
`` That 's time enough for me , father , '' said <NAME> .
<NAME> had not been home .
Such a noble figure of a man ! ’ And here <NAME> is overcome .
‘ Where are the books ? ’ he cried , with a frightful face .
They had a dreadful time of it with her .
‘ Well ! ’ she said , relapsing into stone .
“ Good day , gentlemen ! ” said <NAME> .
I shall put myself in your hands when the time comes .
‘ Speak to him , dear , ’ the old man whispered .
`` What has been done , '' repeated <NAME> .
The timid little beauty promises in all earnestness to be trustworthy .
A stroll and a cigar , and I can think this over .
Sometimes my difficulties have -- in short , have floored me .
`` Well , to be sure , <NAME> ! ''
It was within an hour of midnight .
I am going to lie down .
Not but what he 's artful , even in his defiance of them .
She has never believed any ill of him , never .
“ ‘ Money , or no release , ” ’ repeated <NAME> , firmly .
`` He 's always in the same scrape .
But it was idle speculating thus .
I have observed his face .
She thought upon the way down , would she dare to kiss him ?
When I joined <NAME> , he was walking slowly and thoughtfully down the hill .
So are you , my dear .
What else do I make ?
She passes close to him , with her usual fatigued manner and insolent grace .
Did you ever see such a brute ?
Not having them , he substituted the will for the deed .
Their tone of disgust amounted to being offensive .
‘ “ Show him some more ! ” said the king of the goblins .
You forget , my good <NAME> ; I _have_ put it by .
For I ’ ll never forget you .
‘ I dare say you remember them , <NAME> ?
By and by , his door opened and he came out .
And where is the lady gone ?
But she said never a word .
`` Do you want to see it ? ''
I am satisfied to go , <NAME> ; I am satisfied to go .
Then it can ’ t be helped , ’ said the manager .
`` If you please , <NAME> ; if you will be so good . ''
‘ <NAME> vithin veels , a prison in a prison .
`` I am very glad indeed to hear that , '' I returned .
Here 's a penny for you .
These were its contents : “ Prison of the <NAME> , <NAME> .
You have heard him speak , and have looked upon his face .
I have no more to say . ''
We all became very anxious and impatient , when we sat down to breakfast .
‘ <NAME> , ’ said Mr Toots .
‘ A good place , <NAME> , eh ? ’ said she .
‘ Are you married ? ’ inquired the dirty-faced man .
Let him give no heed to what I ha had ’ n to bear .
'And the least given to peaching , ' added <NAME> .
I felt then , for the first time , that I had lost <NAME> .
I should have said , “ <NAME> !
The unkindled lamp stood on the table .
Only say you ’ ll try him .
<NAME> way shall I use it ?
He was very , very ill sometimes .
His arm trembled as it raised her , and supported her head .
Whether their separation -- ’ Mr <NAME> said no more , but sat silent .
When shall we give <NAME> its mistress , little woman ? ''
<NAME> my body , make haste !
But I do not repent , nor am I unhappy .
They both smoked , for some seconds , in silence .
It is muffled and dreary .
How does that tune go that the sailors sing ?
You 'll be a fine young cracksman afore the old file now . '
You are playing <NAME> with my clerk , are you , <NAME> ?
I ’ ll borrow ’ t for t ’ pay ’ t back .
But they are blotted out .
No , I must say that much , <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> , tell me that you ’ ll stay amongst us .
<NAME> , split and crushed under foot , lay about everywhere .
‘ I am quite afraid of you , ’ said the baronet .
And with his cumbrous and uneasy action he stiffly offered her his arm .
Near <NAME> , ’ was <NAME> ’ s answer .
‘ I try your love too much .
It certainly did seem rather dull and out of spirits .
‘ No , I should rather say he wouldn ’ t .
There 'd be two sides to it .
Here will we stay , till morning blushes .
‘ <NAME> here , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> and I had two upper rooms with a door of communication between .
cried the Jew , stamping furiously on the ground .
I tell you ! ’ said <NAME> , continuing to warn me .
`` Let me look at your forehead , '' he says , bending down .
<NAME> is a wild young fellow .
<NAME> blue , you have begun well , <NAME> !
There was nothing about them which could be called in question .
‘ Yes , sir ; yes , yes , yes .
He felt calm and happy , and could have died without a murmur .
‘ Not yet , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
Think of that , before you send him .
Oliver raised the candle above his head : and looked towards the door .
<NAME> Wrayburn. ’ Tapping his forehead and breast .
<NAME> , see to them bundles . '
What could they do , did she think ?
You want t ’ know where she lives .
His was not a lazy trustfulness that hoped , and did no more .
‘ No thank you , ’ I replied .
I , <NAME> ’ ard <NAME> , see it .
I fluctuate a little ; that 's the truth .
He says is very different from they say , remember .
<NAME> Micawber then delivered a warm eulogy on <NAME> .
How different I felt in one short minute , having <NAME> at my side !
There is nothing for it but to drop him .
They seemed never to have heard its tones before .
It first came on after two years .
Add our two selves , and that ’ s eight .
‘ I ’ m glad to hear it , ’ said <NAME> .
But I am not for you .
`` Are you going back to our young friend ? ''
You understand what I say ? ” A gentle pressure on my hand .
It ’ s as much as to state , you begin .
‘ What then ? ’ said the <NAME> .
<NAME> bears down upon them according to his usual tactics .
<NAME> day ! ’ said Mr Carker , nodding his head .
But it may have been the heated fancy of a friend .
`` This is where he lives , sir , '' says the law-stationer .
`` Esther , '' he returned , `` it is indeed .
I have known it very fashionable indeed .
Or , so he told him .
‘ I can not deny it , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
The chief waiter had had enough of me .
<NAME> habit for a young man .
<NAME> and dark , beside him stood the <NAME> , with its outstretched hand .
It was not far , only at the summit of the hill .
Point the first is this .
A ghost in it , <NAME> hopes ?
At first , neither of us could speak a word .
Several doors were opened in succession , and finally his own .
With Mr <NAME> in my mind , I spoke to you just now .
At last the dishes were set on , and grace was said .
‘ Here ’ s an affair about your friend <NAME> .
‘ There seems no ray of hope , ’ said <NAME> .
I ’ m pretending to be an electioneering agent .
It was a lovely spot to which they repaired .
<NAME> , with a look of assent and sympathy , makes another bow .
‘ I have nothing to say just now .
<NAME> , ’ returned Mrs. <NAME> , with much solemnity , ‘ I have .
He was unreasonable and unpersuadable and used intemperate language .
Will you let me try to mend it for you ?
<NAME> tread of laden men .
I replied it was not the stature , but the intellect was too lofty .
I looked at him and shook my head .
That ’ s very true , ’ returned <NAME> .
<NAME> , my love , is altogether unpresentable .
Oh yes , he was there .
We have astonished them already .
There is hope yet , <NAME> . ''
Must have been such a master of humbug .
I never do. ’ ‘ You know my position , <NAME> .
I thought I had seen you somewhere . ''
That it suggests comparisons to him which are not favourable to himself .
Not his capital that ’ s invested in the business .
How slight a thing will disturb the equanimity of our frail minds !
‘ A fine evening , <NAME> , ’ said the <NAME> .
Mr Dombey prefers remaining in the church .
'Very indeed , sir , ' said <NAME> .
An old silk watch-lining , worked with beads !
No matter , you shall see how soon I ’ ll mend it .
replied <NAME> , referring to his watch .
But I came on here , directly afterwards .
`` Because it needs it most . ''
The baby ’ s dead. ’ My wounds broke out afresh at this intelligence .
<NAME> orphan-stock was surreptitiously withdrawn from the market .
Always the same number in the paper .
`` Is n't the gentleman concerned yet ?
Do n't cry , if you please , miss ! ''
We were once so happy and he so cheerful and contented !
And still there was the same shade between me and my darling .
`` Do n't mind this gentleman , '' says <NAME> in his quiet way .
I love this young person dearly .
Can this be <NAME> ?
With this strange expression on him his thoughts had wandered away .
But , to Pleasant he said good-night kindly .
'Now , you are a nice young fellow , ai n't you ? '
Like all his other speculations , it was sound and successful .
But it is the same with any life .
<NAME> followed to the window : desperate in his curiosity .
Accordingly he said it , and the day was fixed .
I tried reasoning , and reasoning failed .
You HAD got the lamb , and I have <NAME> got the money .
It was at the top of the house nearest to the gateway .
I 'll do as much with it as him , ” said <NAME> .
<NAME> what would , its bricks and bars bore uniformly the same dead crop .
A detestably unhappy walk , sir .
Do try him , if it is only for old acquaintance sake .
'If it is n't him at this time in the morning !
Did I take his sister ’ s money ?
`` Do you recollect the lady 's voice ? ''
The escort and the universal watchfulness had completely isolated him .
Never in a debtors ' prison ? -- Come , once again .
I do not allow it .
It will be all right at last , and then you shall see ! ''
A good tone , mind you !
The boy murmured a reply of intelligence : and hurried downstairs after his companions .
‘ Yes , sir , ’ replied the child .
Therefore if you object , I object .
When I came here , it was bleak indeed .
Her thoughts still turned , as they always had turned , to him .
‘ <NAME> way ? ’ said the child .
<NAME> knew the men , and looked towards the <NAME> for an explanation .
‘ What sort of a one ? ’ asked <NAME> , with a smile .
I was far from sure that I was not in a dream .
‘ Ask these good people who ’ s the hard man here .
`` A virtue in which few Englishmen are deficient , '' observes <NAME> .
‘ You know , I go and call sometimes , on <NAME> .
He ’ s disowned his own father .
`` You can not do these things ?
'It 's not a sight for children , sir . '
‘ Very true , sir , ’ said <NAME> , in a soothing tone .
I do n't say he will .
‘ <NAME> sassage factory , ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> can choose for yourself .
'And what be that stoof ?
The next one comes will be <NAME> , and the next Vilkins .
Something to eat was proposed .
`` And how old are you , child !
`` <NAME> , <NAME> , I 'll find her .
You have found it out at last , have you ?
‘ No , ’ returned the old man thoughtfully , ‘ no .
Then wet umbrellas began to appear , draggled skirts , and mud .
Just turn that into <NAME> , and put your name on the title-page .
‘ I am sure it ’ s done , ’ said <NAME> .
I will forget it as soon as I can .
`` I have known nothing of it .
he repeated , catching at the word with the pleasantest smile .
To lead a life of self-correction is not the way to forget .
I was too cunning for them , madman as they thought me .
He , not to give it up !
Sally , <NAME> , will be delighted I ’ m sure .
<NAME> , the portable property certainly could have been saved .
It don ’ t make either of them able to do a walking match .
How can you be sure of any such thing ?
<NAME> got through it with extraordinary expedition .
You are not fit for this sort of thing .
‘ <NAME> up , my pritty mawther ! ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Is she ? ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> ’ t this a prosperous nation ?
The arrivals quickly became numerous .
Seeing her intent upon the occupation , he sinks into his former attitude .
‘ Oh dear me , don ’ t suppose that I think anything !
‘ At <NAME> ? ’ Veneering inquires .
All the gentlemen say so . ''
My poor , dear , sweet , innocent little brother ! '
And he sat for a little while pondering .
`` I 'll go up to him , then , '' says <NAME> .
My guardian said directly he would go too .
The search was all in vain .
`` It 's the only name I know for the thing .
He lived in <NAME> and clung to his business .
The entertainment was not as agreeable and natural as it might have been .
But when so , not so .
<NAME> ’ t be out of spirits , <NAME> .
“ Look the thing in the face .
<NAME> <NAME> was ejected but not conquered .
‘ Are we going to lie here all da-a-y ? ’ said the lord .
But it isn ’ t worth my while -- fortunately for him .
adds <NAME> , very ill at ease .
Very soon afterwards we stopped .
What will we please to call for ?
His serving-maid entering , and announcing ‘ Mr .
‘ Oh ! ’ said the manager , ‘ the little ballet interlude .
‘ I am much obliged to you .
When I got theer , I wandered on as I had done afore .
I have felt them even drawing my rest away in the night .
Read that description again , <NAME> Nickleby. ’ Kate complied .
‘ It ’ s all over ! ’ thought <NAME> .
Its steady hand was pointed to the head .
We went downstairs , one behind another .
said the gentleman in the high chair .
‘ I hope not , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ How can you till you ’ re told !
‘ Oh my eye ! ’ cried <NAME> , struggling anew .
Let me see <NAME> , let me kiss her .
<NAME> <NAME> looks again , to convince himself .
`` I am sorry to hear it . ''
<NAME> nodded his head thoughtfully , and pulled out his watch .
Have you forgot your old sweetheart ?
<NAME> <NAME> 's voice trembles and his grey hair stirs upon his head .
Beneath that black mud , bubbled the hot springs of <NAME> .
I never knew it fail .
It ’ s a clever idea , really .
“ Why do you write in the public streets ?
Who has brought you here ? ’ ‘ No one .
“ <NAME> , <NAME> ! ” said <NAME> .
‘ I tell you , <NAME> , I will speak .
‘ Fitz-Marshall , ’ said the mulberry man .
'No other question , ' replied <NAME> .
My husband , the forester. ” “ What of your husband , the forester ?
why do we meet like this ?
We used to walk between the two places at all hours .
‘ <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Ha ha ! ’ laughed <NAME> .
They wouldn ’ t crush and wither , if you please , sir .
He has no suspicion of the truth .
And then , you see , you had the papers , too .
<NAME> laughed in his face ; and summoned the landlady .
‘ <NAME> , pooh , my dear Sir , ’ returned <NAME> .
You have made up your mind ?
<NAME> <NAME> followed him , and the ladies screamed .
<NAME> <NAME> ’ s explanation having already been partially made , was soon concluded .
Lying helpless on the ground , I was turned over by a foot .
‘ A young man ! ’ exclaimed <NAME> .
Leaving him standing there , we went up to the top room .
‘ The son of my lady ?
It would ha brought ’ n trouble upon trouble if I had stayed theer .
We are all desperate here .
‘ You must know that , <NAME> .
Quite a shower-bath of ‘ em .
`` <NAME> , '' says <NAME> , `` tell the old girl .
There goes the hour by the clock !
The conference was a long one .
I 'd rather be a baby .
'They have passed me often . '
<NAME> ’ t let her be brought in question .
‘ And yet I know right well it is so , <NAME> .
How do you do , my little gentleman ?
If there ’ s little business to-day , there ’ ll be more to-morrow .
Some <NAME> , and Some New People XXIII .
I take it as it comes , and make the most of it .
The children idolise him , and so indeed does the whole neighbourhood .
Then his face became composed .
<NAME> ! ’ ‘ No , sir , <NAME> , ’ I said .
<NAME> was the wa ’ thou knocked at schoolmeasther ’ s door , eh ?
That he must make an effort .
' I 'll soon do that , if you do n't keep off . '
I put my veil up , but not quite .
‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , bestowing it upon his son .
There was its living copy .
as well as you do -- that such misconstructions are foreign to your nature .
I don ’ t know what to do with him .
You 're surprised to see me , my dear friend . ''
I have avoided him and everyone .
And in the most friendly manner , let me mention one thing more .
We followed to the door .
‘ I will not be answered , <NAME> .
They were in number as the weeks of the year .
‘ Always the same , always the same ! ’ said <NAME> .
The two men looked at the old gentleman as if for instructions .
<NAME> , '' in a low whisper behind his hand .
The name has died out .
Yet Pa and the lovely woman were not going out together .
<NAME> , we must hold our own .
So I make four pounds -- in a lump -- by the transaction ! ''
<NAME> had been sojourning at the undertaker 's some three weeks or a month .
‘ Me handsome , <NAME> ! ’ said <NAME> .
The first was that she could not understand it .
I call their dinner-table , the <NAME> .
The way with all of you. ’ ‘ The way with all of us ?
‘ I have forgotten my flowers , ’ said the spinster aunt .
And where did Plornish live ?
And I hurried on so swiftly that my little maid was surprised .
‘ There ! ’ said Mr Boffin , gloating over them .
When we came to <NAME> 's , my sister bounced in and left us .
<NAME> Leicester is distinctly heard to gasp before speaking .
That he would ever have one , no .
She was a most wonderful woman for prowling about the house .
‘ Nothing more to arrange , I think , ’ said the officer .
<NAME> and contentment must be kept up .
‘ Dear Nicholas , ’ cried his sister , clinging to him .
There was first a game at <NAME> 's buff .
'Dobody but <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> .
So much the worse. ’ ‘ Stay , madame !
'Why , you 're quite a literary character , sir ! '
I never told them at <NAME> and <NAME> ’ s .
`` I am delighted that you approve .
Finally , one strong voice called out , ‘ Is the man heer ?
‘ Recompense him for his toils and disappointments .
He has done the same by me .
‘ I am , sir , ’ replied <NAME> .
A mere habit in me , sir .
'Not now , ' rejoined the lady ; 'one of these days .
He seemed to receive quite a shock from the force of the argument .
`` Nor yet within the walls of <NAME> , my dear . ''
‘ What is it ? ’ inquired <NAME> , looking at <NAME> .
'This has n't go anything to do with young Green here . '
But seeming may be false or true .
That was before my time here , sir .
“ And what 's happened to you ?
Yes , to be sure ! ’ said <NAME> .
‘ I know better than that .
Look at him ! ” An involuntary shudder passed over both of us .
<NAME> <NAME> is very complacent over this <NAME> explanation .
No stopping now : no slackening !
Jobling nods intelligence and acquiescence .
‘ He has kissed another , ’ gasped the excited manager .
Her way of forming a mind was to prevent it from forming opinions .
‘ Forgive me. ’ ‘ No ! ’ cried the Secretary , eagerly .
I don ’ t know it , ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> before you leap , you know .
The secret was safe now !
Conversational and acquiescent on both sides .
And why couldn ’ t you say that at once , <NAME> ?
It is all over here . ''
And why should she say she didn ’ t know ?
A fine old-fashioned watch , ’ he said , taking it in his hand .
It ’ s because I thought it better for you .
says the other woman to her .
There were no other passengers that night , but we four .
‘ Is the other specials outside , <NAME> ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
‘ Who with ? ’ Your friend , <NAME> Fitz-Marshall. ’ ‘ _My_ friend !
Knowing what I knew , I set up an inference of my own here .
Nothing that ministered to her disdainful self-possession could fail to gall him .
`` And Mrs. Snagsby , '' <NAME> introduces .
You ’ re all right , are you ?
She can dominate it even when it is wounded through her sympathy with you .
I tell you yes , ’ said <NAME> .
`` Paying the money , I suppose ?
“ Do n't be so terrified , my love .
I have shaken him till I have made myself giddy .
What can I do for my friend ?
He was indeed , we said .
We are not so mercenary as that , sir .
It is right that I should be chastened in some penalty .
It was right that I should pay the forfeit of my headlong passion .
Can it be used against me ? '
<NAME> ! ’ ‘ And that gentlemanly creature , <NAME> ?
We were a pretty tall time coming that last fifteen mile .
Some weeks passed without bringing any change .
`` No , indeed , '' said Mrs. Dilber , laughing .
Charming <NAME> ! ’ She starts up again .
Those three words conveyed the one idea of Mr <NAME> ’ s life .
The case was desperate ; for the pony was quickening his pace .
And you wo n't find such another .
'Then keep quiet , will you ? '
I saw him over your shoulder. ” “ <NAME> ! ” I thought .
I don ’ t know where they may come down .
‘ I have looked at ‘ em for five minutes , ’ said <NAME> .
You accept favours from him .
'Stand upon one of the hall chairs .
‘ Only to father and <NAME> , sir .
She was a good girl .
It was , at that very moment , going off .
‘ A thousand pardons ! ’ said he .
‘ Red-nosed chap ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
The story is completer and rather more exciting than I supposed .
‘ <NAME> and daughter , ’ replied Mr Dombey .
Kiss me ! ’ was all she said to him .
`` I never heard of such a thing !
Let me dry myself at the fire for five minutes .
For he was still reading it with knitted brows .
She did not know that the girl was dead .
‘ Oh ! ’ cried <NAME> , in a burst of admiration .
screamed <NAME> , in a distracted manner .
It is also my character to govern .
On these national occasions <NAME> finds the cousins useful .
‘ Will you give him house-room , Mr Gills ? ’ said the Manager .
‘ _Was_ the suspected fellow the thief ?
Is that it ? ” I stammered yes , that was it .
<NAME> <NAME> looked hard at him , biting his fingers .
“ You mistake me for another .
‘ But he _can_ be found , ’ said the ardent <NAME> , interposing .
You do n't object to that ? '
There was some one here that needed looking to , she said .
Asks me , as if he hadn ’ t got his hat on ready !
' I wish yer 'd ordered her to make some buttered toast first .
“ An urgent case in the <NAME> , he said .
<NAME> street and down street .
what a turn you have given me !
'Rose , my own dear <NAME> !
We passed but one man .
I come into <NAME> 's property .
I mean to deal with .
The plot was evidently in execution , as <NAME> had foretold .
‘ How fast you walk ! ’ said he .
demanded <NAME> , grasping her by the arm , and shaking her roughly .
I took up a book , and tried to read .
But you know what I mean .
He gazed stupidly about him for an instant , and obeyed .
The <NAME> exists no longer .
`` Do you know the relief that my disappearance will be ?
‘ Her grief , ’ replied <NAME> , with a serious look .
‘ I know its value , sir .
Mrs Boffin next suggested application to their clergyman for a likely orphan .
I have no purpose to serve now but burial in oblivion .
'Light him down , ' said <NAME> , who was filling his pipe .
said the boy , fitting two of the spikes into his chin .
‘ And so it ’ s a secret ? ’ said <NAME> .
‘ What hurt can it do you ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , none .
I kiss her by you .
‘ I shan ’ t be very long , ’ said <NAME> , retiring .
The time seemed to pass very quickly with all the party .
‘ <NAME> is Mrs. Micawber now , sir ? ’ I said .
I did not expect he would be .
‘ That explains it at once .
She must be got to do it somehow . ''
For the future there is no apprehension .
If you keep within our bounds , you can not well be wrong .
‘ Not the man ! ’ said <NAME> .
very good ! ’ ‘ Smoke away ! ’ cried <NAME> .
They all crowd to the door , to see <NAME> off .
<NAME> , intimacy , friendship , fast followed on each other .
And we do n't find them , easy .
`` I would love to tear her limb from limb . ''
It 's quite a story , and shall be saved till dinner-time .
“ I come upon her from behind , as I come upon you to-night .
After last night , I thought I could .
She is a lady and very beautiful .
‘ Lord bless you , then he began !
<NAME> was aware of Mr and <NAME> .
Liberal terms , <NAME> , liberal terms ? '
`` If you like , '' she answered hurriedly .
He proposes to frank me down and back again .
<NAME> cried stop , again , but <NAME> was gone .
I had no letter , and I never saw him more . '
Never. ’ ‘ O Lord ! ’ gasped <NAME> .
I don ’ t miss anything in you .
She could not have suspected me to be that child before .
<NAME> was set at large .
At which my guardian only laughed the pleasantest laugh I ever heard .
‘ I never could a-bear that Job , ’ said <NAME> .
But I think the solitoode done her good .
`` And do you always lock the babies up when you go out ? ''
Wherever my son goes , he can claim kindred with Ap-Kerrig .
The whole jury , as a jury of dogs empannelled to try the deer .
It was a thoughtful evening with both of us .
Crisparkle entirely agrees , you say ? ’ ‘ Entirely .
To wind up all : -- You have shown temper today , <NAME> .
she said , looking at him again .
‘ She is very pretty , ’ she said to herself .
‘ Not suspicion , Mr Clennam , <NAME> .
Mrs. Gummidge did not appear to be able to cheer up .
Who could have been reduced to sudden extremity for the company of that griffin !
‘ What do you mean by these insulting words ?
‘ For myself. ’ ‘ But -- pardon me -- ’ suggested the gentleman .
A man of facts and calculations .
Come up to me to-morrow morning at ten o'clock , my dear . '
As it is , time must be lost .
`` And what two reasons , <NAME> ?
I devote myself to it .
‘ <NAME> ! ’ ‘ <NAME> ? ’ ‘ What _is_ the matter ?
I told her so , earnestly .
“ You know I never shall be , so that 's always .
replied Fagin angrily ; 'what are you blubbering for ? '
But some caution is necessary .
`` Have you anything new to communicate , officer ? ''
Pack it up , <NAME> .
I would infinitely rather destroy myself -- infinitely rather ! ''
Why was the object of his hope removed instead of her ?
`` No I do n't , my dear .
She wrapped her , hasty , in her clothes .
My whole manner of thinking of our late misfortune was changed .
‘ That looks unpromising , ’ said <NAME> .
Say what I would , I could not unsay it .
Why should my landlord quarrel with <NAME> ?
‘ I THINK I am , ’ said Mrs. Wititterly , smiling .
She never interferes , is all for peace , and her disposition easy .
I ’ ll stay with you till I am a cross cranky old woman .
The suffering , quiet , pretty little thing !
Do you observe the extraordinary likeness , my lord ?
A reward of a hundred pounds is proclaimed by Government to-night . '
He was then dying fast .
But she hardly touched it . ''
I don ’ t know but what I do myself .
And why do you ? ’ ‘ Won ’ t do so any more .
‘ Making a cock-shy of him , ’ replies the hideous small boy .
<NAME> , and we ’ ll find it presently .
It 's devilish odd that he need go and die at <NAME> place ! ''
I ’ ll wait for you here. ’ <NAME> needed no second invitation .
Nor was he alone excited and eager .
‘ I worked it out for myself .
“ See the old villain bound with ropes .
Jo never heard of any such book .
But I confide in you .
<NAME> , saving for a curl of her lip , was motionless .
There 'll be no noise and no disturbance at all .
You are always my good angel .
would he let it drop ?
You can talk as you smoke .
‘ I have no hesitation in saying , that ’ s the fact .
‘ What a fancy ! ’ said I .
'The prices allowed by the board are very small , Mr .
She told me she was very well and very happy .
'So I do , ' replied the man .
‘ Yes , ’ replied the small servant .
‘ Exactly so ! ’ said Mrs. Micawber , preserving the same logical air .
c. iii , v. 6 & 7 .
It fell on Mrs Pipchin , and extinguished itself in her black dress .
The jovial party broke up next morning .
It is long -- very long , <NAME> , since you drank the waters .
Do n't talk to me , and stand farther from me !
I lifted my veil and spoke to the woman .
I begged for her in the streets : and they sent me to prison .
I rely as much , or more , on you than him .
‘ Too dry for you , eh ?
What have you been and done with your money ?
“ I ai n't a going to be blest out of house and home .
No , <NAME> , not the worst of it .
There was a light inside .
You may know it ; you may not .
Would you be so good as help <NAME> and myself with these books ?
‘ You are a young man , sir , ’ said <NAME> .
It 's inconvenient -- and it comes expensive .
I should like to know you , <NAME> , very much .
The audacity to enter my house , and open upon me !
Pretty loud smell of varnish , sir ?
There ’ s a lady in the case. ’ ‘ Mrs .
You alarm yourself with old-story fears , mother . ''
inquired the Jew with a forced smile .
I have another reason for this step .
That ’ s the way I spent my tenth birthday .
‘ Certainly not , ’ said <NAME> .
Oliver lingered no longer , but meekly followed his new mistress .
‘ What else ? ’ demanded the master , sternly .
So , all the valuables I have .
I do n't mind if I have a drop there with you ! '
Also very regular , my charming girl .
I have no hope that I shall ever call you mine , <NAME> .
<NAME> ’ t speak to me now .
`` And when the smell of hay was in the air ! ''
<NAME> ! ’ exclaimed <NAME> , with severe philosophy .
‘ That ’ s more to the purpose .
‘ Not by any means , ’ assented <NAME> .
‘ Why not ? ’ said Mrs. Nickleby .
‘ Nothing seems to cost him any trouble , ’ said I .
How can the ancient <NAME> tower be here !
This seemed to draw his attention to him anew .
‘ Informers ! ’ shouted the crowd again .
‘ You think so , don ’ t you ? ’ said <NAME> .
Accordingly , towards this spot , they directed their weary steps .
You shall know by and by .
'Near , I hope , ' said <NAME> .
I am another man now , <NAME> .
What are yer talking about ?
A film came over <NAME> ’ s eyes .
‘ <NAME> , young genelman , ’ said <NAME> .
I considered them mine by right .
There was a sound behind them , as of an imperfectly suppressed chuckle .
‘ You have overpowered me with gratitude , that ’ s all .
The ill-will of <NAME> had lost nothing of its virulence in the interval .
Looking back upon his own poor story , she was its vanishing-point .
Why did he not go on ?
He seemed to be girdled with an iron ring .
control yourself , always control yourself !
And so soon ? ’ I shook my head .
‘ <NAME> to the <NAME> , my dear ! ’ she returned emphatically .
My father , <NAME> , wos a coachman .
‘ <NAME> ? ’ said my aunt , with a glance at me .
‘ Would it come dearer ? ’ Mr <NAME> asked .
`` It has not changed yours , guardian . ''
‘ My niece , my lord , ’ said <NAME> .
'All right , ' rejoined his companion .
I am a wretched being , cut off from everything that makes life tolerable .
Was you ever modelled now ? ''
<NAME> on one side , wife on the other .
On this branch of the subject I have a voice and an opinion .
was the impatient reply ; 'Mother , I have considered , years and years .
' I hope you are not angry with me , sir ? '
He had a right to please himself ; so let him do .
It was the sign of the regeneration of the human race .
There was a brief pause .
I , a poor girl who used to row poor father on the river .
You must call up all your fortitude , and try to bear it .
‘ My dear <NAME> , ‘ Ever your most affectionate , ‘ P.S .
In the village , taxers and taxed were fast asleep .
He could had dispensed with <NAME> .
`` None of the jar and discord of law-suits here ! ''
I thought you gave a start like , as if you did . ''
The little woman herself is not the least item in his difficulty .
‘ <NAME> is not a name , ’ said <NAME> .
It must descend upon me too .
‘ I am afraid , <NAME> , you ’ ll be vexed this time .
`` Take care you do no harm by this . ''
I wants a end of these liberties took with my place .
Where I hate , I bite .
On those points he was ever open to correction .
`` Can you -- can you sit down ? ''
All unconscious of her presence , he chants and sings .
‘ I will , ’ said <NAME> .
I am not going to sleep here .
I Look About Me and Make a Discovery XX .
This is quite understood now. ’ ‘ Thank you , sir .
We have to thank you for that . ''
She was his innocent friend , his delicate child , his dear Little Dorrit .
‘ An abstruse subject , I should conceive , ’ said <NAME> .
I said I would stop till I had gained it .
However , you did bother yourself , and you have since bothered yourself .
again ; and followed it up with `` Humbug . ''
“ Is he living ? ” One other nod .
‘ They never speak to me about you .
<NAME> <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , a little abashed .
And you do so much , so unpretendingly !
‘ I am sure I don ’ t know .
The penny would be an awkward morsel -- but the crown -- ha !
There ’ s a liquorish devilry in your face .
<NAME> up the warrants , <NAME> .
He entreated <NAME> to compose herself .
_that ’ s_ it , is it ? ’ said the young man .
Yours is a ‘ spectable calling .
‘ I said so , didn ’ t I ?
A pretty thing , indeed , to marry a philanthropist .
<NAME> at that dark water .
I might have known that such would have been your opinion .
And have these pets got anything on THEIR minds , eh ?
‘ And twenty , ’ said <NAME> .
I do n't care who says contrairy ; I tell you so .
He took <NAME> ’ s card and appropriate pecuniary compliment .
The clerk promised that he would ; and <NAME> walked out with a growl .
'Will you take yourself off , before I do you a mischief ?
That 's all I have to say to you , my dear ! ''
How can _I_ help laws ?
`` And I can never forget it , '' said <NAME> .
`` <NAME> unanimously , '' I repeated , going on with my work .
Am I always to think more of <NAME> than of my own self ?
<NAME> <NAME> , I believe ? ''
Both smooth heads were alike beaming , blundering , and bumpy .
We say Ritch. ’ ‘ Reetch , ’ remarked the foreign gentleman .
And the two youngest that <NAME> educated are with us .
Bless me , how much some people know of some subjects !
<NAME> <NAME> ’ s accomplishments were all of a masculine and strictly legal kind .
‘ Try it now , ’ said <NAME> .
`` You 're very near , sir , '' says Mrs. Bagnet .
It was as if they had tacitly agreed to take their different provinces .
You may help each other .
Let ’ s be a comfortable couple .
`` You must have a lawyer , '' pursued my guardian .
No ; never heard of it. ’ ‘ So it is , I believe .
' I repeat that I firmly believe it .
He dismissed her , and she glided out of the room .
' I think I know that , ' replied <NAME> , looking up .
‘ Thethilia my dear , kith me and good-bye !
‘ He will come here. ’ ‘ We shall see , ’ said <NAME> .
I Fall into <NAME> XXVII .
We are prepared for you ! '
'Just as I expected , Mrs. Bedwin , ' said the doctor .
'Was n't he always the top-sawyer among you all !
From this slight occasion sprang two meetings that I have now to tell of .
And where will they go together ?
<NAME> that , you impudent old harridans .
‘ Drive on , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Let ’ s know what to make of you .
They occupy the place of years in my remembrance .
She is not such a mite now , but she is deaf and dumb .
She has taken mine , you know .
<NAME> ’ t go out of my sight to-night .
'Another room , and this , ma'am , would be a complete thing . '
`` And a very important document , <NAME> , '' said <NAME> .
Let me suffer , and let me have what alleviation belongs to my condition .
The hand he gave me was the hand I had bitten .
I am going to have a family dinner with <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> to the friends you have not forgotten .
Those who were at play , were gleesome and noisy as other children .
‘ Well , <NAME> ! ’ said <NAME> .
‘ You are always so , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
`` <NAME> , you are so amiable !
`` I know him by sight , '' says <NAME> .
My dear love ! ’ expostulated his wife .
We could go back in it before you paid it , if you liked .
'By and by , ' replied the lady ; 'when I leave <NAME> . '
'Yes , I see it is , sir , ' replied <NAME> .
That ’ s what it ’ s about. ’ ‘ Come nearer the table .
She come , white and hurried , upon <NAME> ’ ly in her sleep .
‘ Talk of your <NAME> universities , ’ said the little old man .
‘ Invisible insects of diabolical activity swarm in this place .
I am sure I am not ungrateful .
‘ It ’ s against all rules , but I don ’ t mind .
I look to you for advice , <NAME> .
I ask them what news in <NAME> , of foreigners arrived .
Still , no new cause for fear arose .
That ’ s the way with you whining , puny , pitiful players .
“ They are very numerous and very loud , though , are they not ?
<NAME> asked him , had he any notion who that unknown friend might be ?
cried Fagin , half mad with fury .
But what a very good-proportioned yard it is ! ''
Will you come and see me ? ''
The contest , however , was too unequal to last long .
He found no pleasure or relief in the journey .
There , they found two women ; one , knitting .
And I was afraid he might know what my face meant .
says <NAME> with a gloomy enjoyment of his injury .
‘ Please I have found out something not yet mentioned .
'You have a right to know them , ' rejoined <NAME> .
What she is , she is , and shows herself to be .
You have heaped insults upon me .
He had already glanced at his hands more than once .
He was stupefied , and he was wearied to death .
‘ We must go back , ’ said the old man , hurriedly .
You will be very much better half an hour hence. ’ ‘ Ah !
`` A <NAME> of my <NAME> 's , '' observes <NAME> .
I landed in <NAME> on a wintry autumn evening .
And I ’ m often so pressed for time !
Mrs <NAME> overflowed with pity , and wept too .
<NAME> broke out of his chair .
‘ Mr Quilp , ’ said the single gentleman .
Try to be better , pray to be better !
<NAME> <NAME> negatived each with a shake of her head .
It appeared to me that his industry was all misdirected .
He must go to <NAME> .
‘ I ’ ll do the same to you .
‘ That ’ s about it , ’ said the carrier .
Say this to herself , and to every one .
<NAME> , tranquil night was reigning in its stead .
When my judgment should be given .
<NAME> , look forward to our meeting again someday !
How could I be arrogant , and you before me !
<NAME> , as if to avoid making a noise and attracting attention .
You do not know your power , <NAME> .
It saves me money to turn him to some use .
Not a word about the money while he 's here , <NAME> .
‘ I have not so much as the slightest predilection left .
Which I sincerely felt , and which indeed it was .
‘ Dear me ! ’ he said , ‘ it ’ s past one .
Let him keep always at it .
What do I want here ?
<NAME> , <NAME> , ” said his wife ; “ Mr .
Just step into this corner a moment , will you ? '
There is no better girl in all this London than <NAME> .
Spies ! ” with many compliments too numerous and forcible to repeat .
'Have you given him any nourishment , <NAME> ?
<NAME> to see you , sir .
“ Nothing that we do , is done in vain .
We ate a good deal , and slept a good deal .
' I do n't belong to them .
If not , marry her without me if you can .
Where had <NAME> heard those words ?
‘ Is it so difficult to get work ? ’ asked <NAME> .
There ; it 's all over now ; and I 'm quite comfortable . '
‘ You are very kind , <NAME> , ’ returned <NAME> .
‘ Blessed indeed ! ’ cried <NAME> , catching at the word .
‘ That ’ s the time of day ! ’ said <NAME> .
‘ What do you go naming names for ?
‘ <NAME> ’ t presume to say so !
Are they to be shirt-makers , or governesses ?
‘ Your wages I shall continue to pay .
For this I came and brought my sister even into your presence .
<NAME> him what it is . ''
What did you take last ?
<NAME> stares at him , and unfolds the paper .
It was not an agreeable idea .
I said I never would , and I never will .
`` <NAME> , it is very kind of you to come to see me .
I 'll pull him down , like a bloodhound .
I have thought of him by day , and dreamt of him by night .
“ I said , ' I have seen her . '
ho ! ’ ‘ Did you go far ? ’ asked <NAME> .
Now I tell you what you want .
Nothing national is exhibited for money ; and no public officer is a showman .
I don ’ t complain that you design to keep me here .
'Do n't stand chattering and grinning at me ! '
If I go , you go ; so take care of me . '
They are fast married , and can ’ t be unmarried .
<NAME> , thee lotht her huthband .
Circumstances have separated us since .
`` Confide fully in him , '' she said after a little while .
The air had been warm and transparent through the whole of the bright day .
I should have thought you was a regular blue-jacket myself . ''
If you are not quite certain on that one point , never send ! ''
There you have <NAME> in little .
We don ’ t ask to be believed on trust What !
I wish you or anybody would .
Oh , I am very miserable tonight , aunt !
You ’ re thankful to her , and you love her .
And amidst the yo-yoing of the whole four , the chaise stopped .
Oh , you call her <NAME> , ’ returned Mr Casby .
Has it come to this ! ” I frowningly sat down to my breakfast .
'Wud of <NAME> 's lads , ' exclaimed <NAME> , with a grin .
<NAME> was the insane act of her late husband .
She lay there , a distressed , unsheltered , senseless creature .
It was a mistake , a mistake .
I know their tricks and their manners .
‘ <NAME> , ’ said Mrs. Micawber , ‘ God bless you !
Besides , it clears the way .
' I never knew her like this , for such a little cause . '
Put up that , to begin with . '
Will you let me lend you all I have ?
The very houses seemed disposed to pack up and take trips .
This was welcome news to <NAME> , who started up directly .
The guests all go away .
So in his bed , whither he repaired with no hope of sleep .
I found in it two hundred pounds .
`` What <NAME> has displaced you ? ''
Then she said , “ Why not tell you the truth ?
I 'm shaken all to pieces ! ''
But he merely asked me what I thought of her .
But I was saying If I should be able to have your company .
‘ Then you shouldn ’ t ask , ’ retorted <NAME> .
`` You want a description of my cousin <NAME> ? ''
`` You know why not , <NAME> .
‘ You told me to try , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Very well , sir , ’ said <NAME> .
But nature or inheritance had implanted a good sturdy spirit in <NAME> 's breast .
This short examination followed , for the court was quick with its work .
My Lady carelessly and scornfully abstracts her attention .
‘ Is she , though ? ’ said <NAME> .
Was it a double tooth , hey ?
This is the end of the first stage of <NAME> 's expectations .
‘ “ What are you ? ” says the baron .
Then , <NAME> and <NAME> came out of their concealment , and exulted tearfully .
As if her eyes and her chin worked together on the same wires .
angry ! ’ returned that young lady with a flounce .
<NAME> coloured a little , and went to the piano again .
I call it my garden .
‘ No. ’ With a rather sad shake of her head .
She made towards the door .
There are a good many of 'em , ai n't there ?
The chair and table merchant never engaged to pay my landlord my rent .
<NAME> little public-houses -- and smithies -- and that .
‘ Dear me , <NAME> -- ’ ‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
He carries with him this coil of rope .
Why , public opinion in the slave <NAME> _is_ slavery , is it not ?
She lay there all night , and started as soon as it was day .
‘ Why , <NAME> ! ’ said the turnkey who admitted them .
I hope I can do without my old face very well . ''
They make a lay-figure of my dear .
When the coffee was done , the <NAME> drew the saucepan to the hob .
I belong to <NAME> 's <NAME> .
Oh , it was so much better as it was !
'It 's very natural that he should be thirsty .
Did she expect <NAME> ?
His bright buttons , too , were of the largest size .
‘ Hah ! ’ Mr <NAME> chimed in , as before .
`` My angry friend from <NAME> !
Had she been oftener thus in older days , she had been happier now .
I ’ ll be their evil genius yet .
You like plainness , I believe ; there it is .
You have anticipated it long since .
He would be very willing indeed .
He is not to be supposed to know it ’ s hopeless .
`` Do n't you be afraid of that , '' returned the woman .
They ca n't have got into trouble .
But one obvious course was left .
‘ Eh ? ’ said <NAME> , turning smartly round .
May you be very happy ! ''
You will profit by the failure , and will avoid it another time .
When I told him , he laughed .
I am very sorry to part company so soon .
‘ Have you been there long ? ’ ‘ No , ’ he returned .
“ The idea of its being you ! ” said I .
Open your mouth and say wot you 've got to say in plain words .
And how are your Boffins ? ’ ‘ Peace ! ’ exclaimed <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> answers with a cool nod , adding , `` Go on .
The trial was very short and very clear .
But if you have friends in adversity , stand by them .
Will you decide what men shall live , what men shall die ?
‘ You are a fine scholar .
Then to <NAME> , ‘ Is he at home ?
It has been smouldering like that ever since it was lighted . ''
The girl was lying , half-dressed , upon it .
The round game comprised the rest of the company .
I hope you will , ’ returned <NAME> .
'Hold your tongue , you doting idiot ! '
<NAME> income twenty pounds , annual expenditure nineteen nineteen and six , result happiness .
<NAME> , tailor , wife , and two children .
Mr and <NAME> have joined the party , among others .
‘ That ’ s the lad , ’ said Mr Witherden .
Do not tremble and cry so much for me .
At last the day turned her waning candle pale , and she fell asleep .
The short man did knock again several times , without producing the smallest effect .
‘ As if that was a crime !
`` He is past relenting , '' said her husband .
She stood still , to look at this maid .
`` It looks like <NAME> . ''
Let us see that , and then to bed .
Are you not well , Mr Rokesmith ? ’ ‘ Yes , quite well .
cried the girl , shaking her head .
For it was quite delightful to me , to find him so pleasant .
The sobered man was brought up and leaped out briskly on the grass .
`` Not the least in the world .
<NAME> , my dear , don ’ t you let yourself be put out .
<NAME> started , and looked at her .
The man ’ s heart swelled as he crossed the stile .
‘ <NAME> PRosa— ’ <NAME> began by way of recovering himself .
`` I know perfectly , '' said I .
‘ Go before , you fool ! ’ said <NAME> .
She was laid upon her bed .
`` 'T is so well known here , is it , comrade ? ''
‘ Well , I tell you what .
“ Bring me hither that fellow ! ” said the <NAME> to the courier .
I had seen it somewhere .
He is in the confidence of the very bricks and mortar .
“ Who seeks him ? ” answered <NAME> .
But no <NAME> was in all the view .
I am afraid I shall disappoint you .
Good-bye ! ’ They shook hands , and <NAME> strode out pondering .
‘ Then bring him here , ’ said the single gentleman .
When you come to me this evening , not a word of last night .
Ve-ry happy , I am sure , to have the honour !
'The only thing she had .
‘ You have fallen on <NAME> days and sensual rest , too soon .
'That 's when they 're ill , Mrs. Mann , ' said the beadle .
Some difficulty had for some time existed between the parties .
“ Pray what is your business ? ” I asked him .
The <NAME> was but another illustration of the truth of this position .
‘ <NAME> ! ’ said the old woman , with a shrill laugh .
Let me wet your lips again with this brandy .
I ought to have had more faith in you .
A minute more , my lady lass !
But no one knew It .
`` To decided rejection , if you please , '' returned my guardian .
It would affect my daughter greatly , sir , if she heard it .
But can you restore him back to life ? ''
A more outrageous person I never did see .
And indeed he has no such wish at present , by any means .
To which <NAME> replies , `` Why , YOU are ! ''
‘ Prime ! ’ ejaculated <NAME> .
Six tumbrils roll along the streets .
“ Very well , ” said <NAME> .
‘ Somebody to the lodger eh ?
`` Not an idea of them ! ''
‘ Yours , sir. ’ ‘ Thank you , ’ said <NAME> .
Sometimes I would come upon him lingering at the door of <NAME> 's office .
And lord , how the gentlemen in the Court talked about it !
And I mean to be !
Such long lashes , such delicate fringe !
`` Is that the chance and hope you mentioned , <NAME> ? ''
`` Ye-es , '' is <NAME> 's reluctant admission .
We set off again immediately .
replied <NAME> , confronting him with a steady look .
They were men of business : very wealthy , and of great importance .
a moral funeral , quite ! ’ ‘ Mr <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
He may brush his hair too regular , or too un-regular .
<NAME> lives there , <NAME> , ’ said the watchman , pointing further in .
They shan ’ t be wasted , ’ continued <NAME> , turning to <NAME> .
he knows a great deal about it .
Produced by <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> By <NAME> 1 .
“ <NAME> , ” she said , touching him with her cold hand .
`` And yet I am here now , '' <NAME> admits .
We dined alone , we three together .
‘ Why , who are you ? ’ said <NAME> .
You doen ’ t understand what ‘ tis we has afore us .
you are the ruin -- the ruin -- the ruin -- of me .
Hereby they made for themselves a shining little reputation apart .
The wind sawed , and the sawdust whirled .
We have been mentioning Mrs. Jellyby .
My fault is , that I have been true to you .
He knows his mother very little if he does .
‘ Yes ! ’ cried <NAME> , laughing and crying together .
But I knew it , I knew it well now .
It ’ s clear to me that I am done for .
Nicholas ! ’ cried <NAME> , starting in great astonishment .
What would you wish me to do to-day , brother ?
he cried , 'hard , fast , full gallop !
Quart of double stout a head .
Nor was even this the worst .
The <NAME> was nothing to me but an insensible blunderer .
Mrs Chivery considered the latter precaution superfluous , but said she would try .
“ Do n't be nettled , <NAME> .
These repeated visits inflamed the curiosity of <NAME> to the very highest pitch .
‘ That ’ s all , ’ replied <NAME> .
Did we go by this alley ?
'Yes ; I 'll help you , you young rascal !
Charming house you have here .
‘ I think of setting up a doll , <NAME> , ’ he said .
‘ <NAME> , <NAME> ! ’ said <NAME> .
`` Still I ask you , what is this to me ? ''
<NAME> requires that he should found a handsome establishment by marriage .
My young people all go out a good deal .
‘ This is <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> to me .
The wonder was , it was there at all .
I will have some talk with my old friend , <NAME> .
She disgraced herseln everyways , bitter and bad .
She remains here , in her home with me .
He looked around him , and knew that it was so .
`` He died seven years ago , this very night . ''
<NAME> <NAME> makes three distinctly different bows to these three people .
‘ This I also had it in charge to communicate .
<NAME> ’ s State of Mind 28 .
‘ Door , <NAME> ! ’ ‘ Good-morning , sir , ’ said <NAME> .
A rattling noise at a little distance attracted their attention .
said <NAME> in a tone of confidence .
‘ Yes , we would rather walk .
Is it for him that I have declined and falled , night after night ?
Presently afterwards , <NAME> disappeared into the jail .
“ Is that the exact substance ? ” “ Yes , ” said <NAME> .
If it had been my ears , what should I have done ?
You recollect that first night , when I was so unpolite and inky ?
This visit was , as has been said , a grand event .
‘ Oh you naughty thing ! ’ rejoined <NAME> .
Her expression air then as follering : 'Mr .
Do you think that you could find her ?
It was while they were preparing to sing , before the sermon .
Now , father , you have brought me to this .
You might as well live dear . ''
<NAME> <NAME> must gather them all up and begin again .
Have you come to give us information where he is ?
<NAME> terms in <NAME> jail .
<NAME> from here with an air of cheerfulness and courage , for his sake .
S-q-u-double e-r-s-Squeers , noun substantive , a educator of youth .
says <NAME> with a sigh .
‘ I didn ’ t marry to be reasoned with .
‘ She should have thought of that , before she caused so much misery !
It shall be seen to .
I informed him in exchange that my <NAME> name was <NAME> .
The wigged gentleman sitting opposite , still looking at the ceiling of the court .
Left for town suddenly last evening .
I didn ’ t expect he would have thought of me .
I have promised never to leave ye .
‘ Why don ’ t I say , being poor !
A Little Cold Water XXXVIII .
It lay back on the pillow of Monsieur the <NAME> .
I shall not strike too soon .
You are welcome , sir ; ’ with a low bow .
And so , in truth , it was .
But a chuckle saved him on the brink .
How miserable I was , when I lay down !
`` Say at <NAME> 's , <NAME> 's <NAME> . ''
Wot are they , then ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> .
Have you any objection to see him in my presence ? '
Perhaps I shall find you here when I come back .
I may have succeeded ; I may not .
<NAME> seized the moment to touch her hand .
‘ That is enough , sir , ’ said <NAME> .
'What do you think now ? '
I have discovered that the sixth seal mentioned in the <NAME> is the <NAME> .
I would n't like to lose anything by being learned wrong now . ''
Her wrong is my wrong .
Yet the something never left it .
She had crossed him every way and everywhere .
But no one saw them glistening save <NAME> .
Well , it ’ s fur our little Em ’ ly .
He had picked up the captain at a neighbouring race-course .
`` My dearest , '' returned <NAME> , `` daily and hourly .
I found his house dark and silent .
I wish mother had come here .
The results may be guessed .
'Ca n't exactly say ' wo n't do , you know .
And he 's the downiest one of the lot ! '
My dear <NAME> , I have told you why . ''
You do n't take kindly to that idea ; I do n't mind it .
‘ He has quitted those works .
See how hard you wos upon me .
<NAME> listened to this dialogue in horror .
He took my hand and kissed it .
A cheque for twenty pound for <NAME> , <NAME> .
‘ Summer and winter , ’ he replied .
He ran home and came running back again .
‘ A fine day , sir , ’ remarked <NAME> .
The back kitchen ’ s empty , <NAME> .
You know they live at the <NAME> , perhaps ?
In this , his prosperity consisted .
`` I hope , sir -- '' said I .
I -- I hope you will not misunderstand me , sir .
I accept the offer at once .
and What did they mean by it ?
‘ He is , ’ rejoined the collector .
So you have carried your intention into effect .
Mrs. <NAME> rose to get another cup and saucer from the closet .
‘ You had better not , ’ replied the dressmaker .
Can I take you anywhere , sir ?
The child made a strong effort , but it was an unsuccessful one .
my dear <NAME> , how can I answer you ?
Now , let me be a warning !
‘ What ’ s the matter now ? ’ said <NAME> .
Mr Feeder , after imbibing several custard-cups of negus , began to enjoy himself .
But this was not the worst of it .
A labouring man opened it .
‘ Grummer , ’ said the magistrate , in an awful voice .
replied the girl , raising her head languidly .
This done , <NAME> proceeded to business .
I have often sat with <NAME> near me , and thought about it .
I was sent away from this country .
Well , how extremely natural that is !
All bright with love of you , my boy .
‘ That night when it snew so hard ? ’ ‘ That night .
Is it lonely , down-stairs , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Very !
End of the <NAME> EBook of <NAME> , by <NAME>
Still I don ’ t believe it .
<NAME> <NAME> neither entered nor left the old man ’ s house , unobserved .
Boys are very like men to be sure .
<NAME> <NAME> partook of pudding .
`` Are you well wrapped up , <NAME> ? ''
Still there was no reply : so she spoke .
Put your poor little feet on the fender .
‘ Dear me ! ’ said Mrs. Dowler .
‘ Shall I go on ? ’ said <NAME> .
`` Not in his usual spirits ? ''
“ What for ? ” “ What for , <NAME> ?
But take care , take care .
But it is mere impertinence in me to offer any recommendation .
And that was another most consummate vagabond !
`` And A <NAME> ! ''
‘ Can ’ t you speak ? ’ said the boy sharply .
It was fifty-five years ago .
‘ <NAME> water- works is nothin ’ to you .
‘ He is indeed , sir ! ’ said <NAME> .
‘ I have not a brother ’ s claim .
And as he thought of this , the day broke -- Sunday .
‘ No , thank you , ’ replied <NAME> hurriedly .
When the day broke , it blew harder and harder .
Some more rational said , let us have a better one .
‘ An _unfortunate affray_ occurred in <NAME> county ( <NAME> .
All the rest is hocus-pocus .
I am very much obliged to Trimmers .
‘ Wot ’ s your usual tap , sir ? ’ replied <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> cuts an old Acquaintance .
said <NAME> , at length .
They tell me downstairs that your wife is here .
said <NAME> with an air of vexation .
Not so very uncommon , you 'll tell me .
<NAME> in again , as you come down-stairs , <NAME> .
‘ “ Hark ! ” said the old man .
‘ Found myself among the young ladies , by <NAME> !
I never do swing a cat .
Is it a foot or a claw ? ''
Now , I won ’ t go down before them .
This I leave to yo. ’ <NAME> was troubled and asked how ?
‘ I am as well as I usually am .
Any way out of that yard , now ? ''
Who was it that cried “ No ” ?
I redden , tumble over half-a-dozen words , and stop .
said <NAME> just as heartily as before .
I have no right to tell you even so much .
‘ I say , <NAME> , not a word !
But the very looks of you are unsettling , '' Mrs. Bagnet rejoins .
* * * * * Edwin Drood passes a solitary day .
‘ No more did I , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Her father , ’ replied the other softly .
Another , <NAME> calls it tucker-edging .
By facing round as she has moved , he stands a little behind her .
You may as well go again me one way as another .
Is it a secret , sir ? ''
<NAME> cast down his eyes on his own besprinkled clothes .
We dined together by the fireside .
`` When are we to hear more of this ? ''
At first her uncle was stark distracted .
And how it could do all , that could be done .
‘ We shall be ready directly , ’ said <NAME> .
The truth then came out .
<NAME> , name first mentioned to my proprietor by <NAME> in the <NAME> .
A dread and faintness fell upon me , and I called to <NAME> .
How did you come by it ?
<NAME> shillings were taken by Mrs. Grudden in the first ten minutes .
“ 'She has a husband , a father , and a brother ? '
<NAME> in hollow ; and inside solid , hollow again !
I have never seen my aunt in such state .
I hardly know how I have strayed into this story .
‘ Oh , I forgot ! ’ replied <NAME> .
“ It is very high ; it is a little difficult .
‘ I feel rather serious , ’ returned <NAME> .
And what did it matter ?
For we don ’ t mean no harm .
`` You have roused my curiosity , and now you must gratify it . ''
' I thought you did n't want to hear , my dear .
<NAME> till the greens is off her mind .
This was no very great consolation to the child .
She is going home , a little way into the country .
We should be as gay as larks , Mr <NAME> -- why not ?
I never mentioned this to anyone .
' I suppose yer the new boy , ai n't yer ? '
It was , in effect , that the cook had mislaid the beef .
You do n't deserve help , but I 'll help you .
Oh there ’ s Ma speaking to the man at the piano !
There was a small chimney , heavily barred across , a few feet within .
Thank you heartily for all you have done and all you mean to do .
Oh <NAME> heretofore the <NAME> , I pray you be you true to me !
And I understand she leads him a terrible life .
My sweet companion , my own dear girl ! '
I am not your man .
But there ’ s nothing like work .
He was born in the same scrape .
<NAME> <NAME> or <NAME> can have been reading anything ?
`` Excuse me , our time presses .
`` Well enough to know what his intentions were .
`` You hear what she says , and I know it 's true .
<NAME> , <NAME> , is this my house , am I a child ?
<NAME> , mother , if within my means , let _me_ make it .
<NAME> <NAME> again mentioned the address .
It is quite right to know these people .
They shook hands upon it laughingly , but in deep earnestness .
When does this match come off ?
I knew they told the truth -- I knew it well .
Oh no offence ! ’ said the old man .
‘ And I thought it was you , young man .
'He shall have all he wants , ' continued the Jew .
“ You know he is as ungainly within as without .
‘ You , ’ said <NAME> , without the least reserve .
returns <NAME> , shaking hands with him quite affectionately. ``
<NAME> <NAME> made <NAME> 's bow again as a response to this liberality .
You should have more patience .
Now , Nolly , dear , are you ready ? '
<NAME> <NAME> knows more of <NAME> and <NAME> than anybody .
‘ Take his skates off , ’ repeated <NAME> firmly .
The latter he was intimate with , and affectionately embraced .
This is in fact all but freeing him .
But the horses is coming round the corner .
My hand upon that , too !
With <NAME> he was gossamer .
‘ Gog and <NAME> , <NAME> and <NAME> .
‘ Well , <NAME> ! ’ said <NAME> .
A sad loiterer to be sure !
After tea there came another knock at the door , announcing <NAME> .
Oh , she was so frightened !
It was his , thank God !
My uncle could make nothing of it .
‘ Yes , <NAME> , ’ said the Major .
<NAME> handed it to him .
`` Have you made any new discoveries ? ''
But there was a certain dash and glare about him that caught her .
‘ My dear Josiah ! ’ cried Mrs. <NAME> , trembling .
‘ Oh my goodness me , ’ said she .
Listen to what is to follow .
Well , that adds to my pain , but not to theirs .
‘ You don ’ t understand. ’ ‘ I understand too well .
'There are a good many books , are there not , my boy ? '
But <NAME> shall come back no more .
`` Of your guardian , <NAME> , '' said <NAME> .
Oh , how had I strayed so far away !
I am afraid I have been very complaining , and very capricious .
We so much regret it !
But he led me to the shore .
O let us be joyful ! ''
He was ever the same to me .
Of that group I was one .
`` Tramping high and low , have they , <NAME> ? ''
She seemed to be able to speak or think about nothing else .
A light shone in upon me all at once .
But <NAME> ’ s <NAME> had been cut up root and branch .
‘ Forms going up -- carpenters coming down -- lamps , glasses , harps .
Towards the marshes I now went straight , having no time to spare .
They ’ re not any ways complaining. ’ ‘ Hum .
Mr <NAME> ’ s face denoted <NAME> and <NAME> .
He knew them every one , and called them by their names .
There ai n't such a thing in nature . '
The breakfast-parlour door was partially open .
I had no particular love for <NAME> ’ s father .
`` No , <NAME> , '' she returned , `` I wo n't !
In one of these starts the cry of ‘ Lock , ho !
She is now decided , and prepared to throw it off .
Fortune seemed determined to favour his design .
returns the old man shrilly and sharply .
Come again after six days .
Everybody was dressed for a Fancy Ball that was never to leave off .
Well , I _am_ glad to hear that -- very .
We shall be gone directly. ’ ‘ I asked her to do it .
Where was the wit of the sharp-sighted men of sound mind ?
‘ It was only yesterday evening that I came to <NAME> with my brother .
Mr <NAME> was going to take up the <NAME> .
“ The chateau and all the race , ” returned <NAME> .
To the satisfaction of the lady and the gentleman , it never will be .
There let ‘ em be , merry and free , toor rul lol le .
`` You shall have the paper , '' says <NAME> .
And <NAME> was right .
Again came <NAME> close upon it , and absorbed his whole attention .
He was drowned in shipwreck on his voyage , ’ said <NAME> , sobbing .
'Yes , she will , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
`` There 's the door , by which the <NAME> of <NAME> entered !
I fare to feel sure on ’ t .
' I am a foolish , excitable , weak creetur . '
See here -- look , look , my dear ! '
I ’ ll be friends with him tomorrow .
I obeyed , all in a tremble , and was conducted into another room .
Mrs. Snagsby consciously asked why .
I had never heard of such a thing .
' I should say , three pound ten was plenty , ' said <NAME> .
‘ Why , how thin you are !
<NAME> , you have n't found <NAME> any work yet ! '
The clerks within were not a whit behind-hand in their demonstrations of respect .
After dear <NAME> died , we said we would be brother and sister .
She was in great agitation .
By this time he has finished and is putting up his case .
He walked to the door , and looked wistfully out .
`` And who is W. Grubble , <NAME> ? ''
Not at all ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , my dear .
<NAME> <NAME> knitted her brow at him , as he darkly leered at her .
‘ My dear sirs , he has said all he has to say .
`` Not much of that , I should think . ''
It is modest and retiring , it lies in ambush , waits and waits .
where did you suppose she was going to ?
A shilling of mine is going your way to-night , Deputy .
I never could have been set right without you , sir . ''
But there are more of ’ em in it .
I never saw so remarkable a look in a young person .
You are like your cousin <NAME> , my dearest <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
And I to you. ’ ‘ Pa and Ma ! ’ said <NAME> .
By the light of the moon <NAME> can be seen , perfectly still .
‘ However she got to it , she graced it , ’ says Mortimer .
She was so young , too !
What she gave her , I don ’ t know .
‘ At least , you can if you like .
‘ No , no -- it ’ s over now , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Sticking to him is the word , ’ said <NAME> .
His was a bad case too , in a different way .
They are but secrecy , fidelity , and perseverance .
‘ To a mast-maker up town , ’ said <NAME> .
Shall I recall yet something more to you ?
It was consolatory to know that he had found such a resting-place for it .
<NAME> has an assignation elsewhere .
So I have made up my mind .
It is the region of song and smoke .
The door opened and <NAME> appeared .
<NAME> ye , I am used to it .
The women work in covered sheds , erected for that purpose .
<NAME> , Alice. ’ ‘ Stop , <NAME> ! ’ cried the distracted Grinder .
`` You do not think he is ill ? ''
<NAME> <NAME> replied that I had hinted as much to him .
'Twenty pound , though -- it 's a lot of money ! '
We all echoed , `` A very fine head ! ''
not a soul , ’ says <NAME> .
My mother was another exception .
The name of this old pagan 's god was <NAME> .
There was no variation in the order , or the manner .
Some people , <NAME> , would have been all flintiness and granite .
What ? ” “ I mean of him .
`` Yes , sir , I am his distressed mother . ''
I have been much concerned to hear it . ''
Back to the <NAME> , and <NAME> within four-and-twenty hours !
Do I look as if I mean it ?
‘ I thought I knew the step , ’ she answered , hesitating .
Mrs. Blinder is entirely let , and she herself occupies poor <NAME> 's room .
‘ You don ’ t know that ? ’ cried Quilp .
And we were silent again until she spoke .
`` Is this will considered a genuine document , sir ? ''
I wish I had asked him sooner .
C-l-e-a-n , clean , verb active , to make bright , to scour .
‘ Room for you all , gentlemen , ’ said the stout man .
‘ Is that the spot ? ’ asked <NAME> in a whisper .
But mind , not a word of this to anybody else .
`` Not like your ladyship 's family ? ''
‘ What is it ? ’ inquired <NAME> , interrupting him with some impatience .
<NAME> <NAME> looked a little curious too , but quite comfortable and unsuspecting .
‘ Dora is coming to stay with me .
It ’ s his only compensation for the outward restraints he puts upon himself .
replied <NAME> , from the inside .
But , as he was not there , she came back again .
<NAME> , from information I have received I understand you are a medical man .
<NAME> ’ t come a step beyond the door .
'God Almighty help me , I am ! '
You forget your dependent position. ’ ‘ I don ’ t care for that .
' I could n't swear to him . '
Let her get those first , those first .
My boots might be placed in any collection of instruments of torture .
‘ Oh not that nasty ugly name , say Flora ! ’ ‘ Flora .
‘ No number , my dear Clennam ? ’ returned his friend .
Now I go along with you .
It has faded from the air , before he breaks the silence .
returned the old lady shortly .
<NAME> had ever appeared so beautiful in his sight .
I provide you with valuable assistance to do it .
‘ Stand by , <NAME> ! ’ said the <NAME> to himself .
He is free to go .
Mr <NAME> welcomed the visitor with the highest urbanity , and most courtly manners .
Perhaps I ought to do so .
Is it private business ? ’ ‘ I really am not sure .
Not a minute must be lost . ''
The <NAME> will go to pieces if he don ’ t .
The man only answered with another shrug , and showed no symptom of confusion .
He was under Government -- high in the <NAME> Office .
`` You mean about the man ? ''
He hid all manner of things away , everywheres .
‘ No , but IS he ? ’ said <NAME> .
Now if it could be done again , it must not be so done .
<NAME> eyed him furtively from time to time .
Or at least if I do now , I thought I did not then .
And then sobbed out , `` With all my heart I do !
After being silent for a few moments , he pursued his story .
rejoined <NAME> , knocking the table also .
‘ The infirmities of nature -- ’ ‘ Nature ! ’ said Mrs. Nickleby .
What is to come of it ?
He is not worth his salt , ma ’ am .
`` Before I married my present husband , '' says Mrs. Chadband .
He tends to meekness and obesity .
For <NAME> is a little place .
“ <NAME> and <NAME> ! ” said the other five members .
My love , she 's clearer than any counsel I ever heard ! ''
‘ And enough to make wigs for all the dolls in the world .
But these are intangible points .
`` You think I have begun ill , sir , '' retorted <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> ’ s advice , my darling .
<NAME> is a dear fellow , and in his profession faultless .
You ’ re a wonderin ’ what that ’ s fur , sir !
I struggled , and got out of it .
‘ Look ’ ye here , then , ’ said Mr Clark .
`` And again , '' repeats mademoiselle , cataleptic with determination .
How dare you set up superiorities against all these characters combined in your sister ?
this pulse is beating curiously !
“ Not a bit on it , dear boy !
I asked him how <NAME> was ?
But , I jealous on that account ?
No followers. ” ’ ‘ Oh Lor ! ’ tittered the client .
‘ There ’ s nothing there , my beauty , ’ said the <NAME> .
He supposed he was right ?
He says you will understand .
‘ “ My dear , ” said the baroness .
It seemed , to her inexperience , a comical vagary of the imagination .
`` <NAME> , my love , <NAME> , my dear , you are welcome .
‘ I think that ’ s prudent , ’ returned Mr Groves .
The proctors employ the advocates .
He pressed her in his arm , and kissed her cheek .
It is a mercy he did n't shake his arm off .
‘ Here ’ s sixpence for you , <NAME> .
‘ Ven is it expected to come on ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
I loved <NAME> to distraction !
The sole consideration in this unhappy case is <NAME> . ''
My tears will make their way .
‘ It ’ s the same ! ’ cried <NAME> .
And so you fancy yourself in love !
The Jew looked blank at this information .
I write it at stolen intervals , under every difficulty .
‘ Come in ! ’ said Mr Dombey .
‘ And this is the <NAME> prison for debt ! ’ said Mr Flintwinch .
There were several second-hand bags , blue and red , hanging up .
‘ I am not hurt , dame .
‘ A-do , <NAME> , ’ said the old gentleman .
I mean it , ’ replied <NAME> .
I wish he was dumb .
`` But I want , in the young lady 's name , to know .
The box was taken out to his cart , and lifted in .
‘ I hope not , ’ said <NAME> .
What drunken brawl keeps him away ?
Mrs General was not to be told of anything shocking .
‘ He has a remarkable head-voice , and will commence as a chorister .
What did that fellow <NAME> say to me , <NAME> ?
<NAME> , thou shouldst have ‘ em a ’ .
It was a worthy place .
Not <NAME> ’ s , I perceived .
‘ Dear Papa , oh don ’ t look strangely on me !
Among them piles of bones , and close to that there kitchin winder !
‘ <NAME> natural to you , eh ? ’ said <NAME> .
I will see it done .
I said so. ’ ‘ To whom ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
I have met with a variety of allusions to it .
‘ <NAME> , we must lose not a moment .
They were as kind to her as they were to me .
‘ A fraud on the <NAME> of <NAME> ? ’ I asked .
He has fallen on his legs , has <NAME> .
said the Jew , who had entered unseen by <NAME> .
'Take him away to bed ! '
‘ I recollect her quite well ! ’ ‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
she asked behind her veil .
But you shan ’ t be annihilated , <NAME> .
All through school hours I make mistakes .
‘ Five pound a year , ’ said <NAME> .
I forgot what we are to pretend .
'Imagination , ' said the gentleman , soothing her .
Pancks instantly made fast to him and hauled him out .
He knows it , <NAME> , as none can .
I don ’ t know what they would have .
‘ Stay here , ’ repeated <NAME> .
The supposed <NAME> descends , and the seamstress is lifted out next after him .
Yet you seemed to want to make a man mollancholy mad .
'Perhaps they will take something to drink first , Mrs .
I thought it would be better that I should come than somebody quite strange .
‘ I know I must be right .
' I want it in the street . '
You have kept your own room when you ought to have been here .
<NAME> <NAME> , ’ said the landlord with an air of great deference .
‘ Oh beautiful , sir , beautiful indeed , ’ said <NAME> .
I remember them in your case .
“ I wish I was a frog .
‘ Not bitterly disappointed , I think , ’ he said aloud .
`` Are division and animosity your natural terms , <NAME> ? ''
Bending her head she looked another way .
‘ <NAME> , ’ said Mr Meagles , listening .
She turned faint and sick .
Preparations are afoot , measurements are made , ground is staked out .
I went , with my wife , at about ten .
‘ Take that , sir. ’ Take what ?
‘ She is still asleep , ’ he whispered .
‘ Mrs Quilp , ’ he said at last .
Did you happen to think of me in the night ?
‘ Every letter , ’ said the <NAME> .
‘ Half-past two o ’ clock in the morning , ’ muttered <NAME> .
But answer the question , ” said <NAME> .
I don ’ t want to back out of the consequences .
The society of girls is a very delightful thing , <NAME> .
It is as clear as crystal that <NAME> is that boy 's father .
He saw a hand come forth and grope about a little .
If you shut your eyes , perhaps you ’ ll go to sleep .
I would that it had ended there .
The chain he drew was clasped about his middle .
“ It 's bad about here , ” I told him .
returned the robber with an incredulous air .
But -- my faith ! -- still what does it matter to me ? ''
And yet I could not trace this to <NAME> .
‘ I wouldn ’ t be hard with her for the world .
“ It brought me here , it brought me to my grave .
Has her keeper been for her ? '
The young lady who is to give you her hand hates and despises you .
said <NAME> , `` Ve-ry correct .
An unnatural silence and desertion reigned there .
said <NAME> with his whole face in a glow .
I have nothing about me by which I can be recognized .
‘ No , ’ said the old lady .
‘ <NAME> , we must do the best we can , my dear .
`` I have come to look after the property .
`` I am not a lady .
`` And so <NAME> , my dear , you are happy for life .
It IS all left behind .
‘ He is at home at present , ’ said the latter .
But it is useless to discuss the question .
'Did you redress yourself to me , my man ? '
Neither did that gentleman address his eyes towards his wife otherwise than by stealth .
`` You had better turn him out , '' said <NAME> .
I must be going now .
There are very few now .
`` How happy that would make me ! ''
<NAME> looked at nothing and cared for nothing .
Take my hat. ’ He obeyed each instruction , as it was given .
He told me that he would look about him for such an orphan child .
Surely an unaccountable sort of expedition !
I hardly got any sleep .
I never knew much of him .
‘ What do you mean by that ? ’ demanded his friend , fiercely .
‘ Oh my goodness , ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> Heaven that I am going away from , have compassion on my uncle !
I have no earthly hope any more , that is not you .
But what I do in my trade , I do to sell .
He repaired to her chamber , straight .
But <NAME> was all the worse for this .
‘ “ No , I do not , fellow , ” rejoined my uncle .
I would have had that fellow shot without the least remorse ! ''
‘ Here ! ’ replied a feeble voice .
‘ Ungrammatical twaddler , was it , sir ? ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Is their peace nothing , sir ? ’ returned <NAME> .
`` There you are , my partner , eh ? ''
Who can read the heart , Mr .
Man to be identified by broad nose , and legs like balustrades of bridge .
<NAME> has had proofs of it .
`` Have you got the pipe ?
‘ Really does ! ’ ‘ What is her history ? ’ asked <NAME> .
He sat down in the chimney-corner and smiled .
The housemaid wishes it wasn ’ t wicked to wish that one was dead .
We parted company , and left the youngster lying in a ditch .
'Like a lamb , ' rejoined <NAME> .
That 's the little window that he got in at , eh ?
‘ The poor bereaved little baby , ’ said Mr Chick .
In short , it 's in total confidence . ''
‘ Because you show it , ’ replied <NAME> in unintentional rhyme .
He had established a confidence with her , from which her husband was excluded .
YOU would n't be talked over if you were used so .
He ain ’ t the only one in the same fix .
<NAME> called him `` her dearest cousin , <NAME> . ''
' I kicked , ' replied the charity-boy .
‘ No , I did not , sir , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ It ’ s enough to make a man smoking hot .
Oh , try to forgive me ! ''
Certainly , my companion could not , for my position was the best .
You was too quick for me .
Who else rustles about it , making signals by dropping dust so softly ?
‘ It ’ s a very nasty one , ’ said <NAME> .
Here there was another laugh , and another cry of silence .
How does it come about at all ?
‘ Bring him in ! ’ ‘ Yes , <NAME> .
‘ I think I hear it now , ’ said <NAME> .
But <NAME> is not a part of Mr <NAME> ’ s world .
As it is , let them talk till they are hoarse .
‘ <NAME> , my dear , ’ she said .
Being so very regular in his attendance . ''
I have had enough to bear myself , in my time !
“ Why , if it ai n't your footstool ! ” cried <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> , ’ said the scorbutic youth , in a loud voice .
`` What , the one as big as me ? ''
<NAME> sighed again -- the letter was so very affecting .
But do not come soon , do not come often !
But is that your truth to me ?
`` No ; have you really , my dear ? ''
‘ Let me have them , and I ’ ll send you a cheque .
'No , ' replied a voice , which <NAME> thought he had heard before .
<NAME> hold of me somewhere .
Take it , monsieur. ” <NAME> took it in his hand .
Another beadle had come into power .
‘ I didn ’ t take it , ’ said <NAME> indignantly .
<NAME> <NAME> did the same .
‘ What do you mean ? ’ <NAME> polished his knife in silence .
‘ There ! ’ said Mr Dorrit , slowly shaking hands with him .
<NAME> , <NAME> , tough is <NAME> .
Once , nobody was ashamed -- never mind that .
‘ Come in and sit ye down , girl , ’ said <NAME> .
What is NOT the matter ?
There will be a deplorable scene , whenever we are married .
From the first , I had anxiously considered what I ought to do .
No fireside couch was there , to invite repose and comfort .
All this was very snug and pleasant .
<NAME> <NAME> begs him to remain there while he speaks to <NAME> .
The lawyer looks down over the hand-rail .
That he would have allowed .
He seemed bewildered and amazed .
Never mind , don ’ t let us talk any more about it .
You must be refreshed and cheered .
I forbid the house to <NAME> , and I forbid the house to <NAME> .
You ’ ll want ‘ em all , perhaps , for another time .
“ I believe it is something of that sort , ” said <NAME> .
It was <NAME> , the mother of the dead child , who was absent .
No favourable leaning in that quarter to-day .
He was own brother to a brimstone magpie -- leastways Mrs. Smallweed .
<NAME> <NAME> had been busy with the river that day .
They turned into the breakfast parlour .
`` And travelling all the time ! ''
“ And will continue friends apart , ” said <NAME> .
`` How do you do , Esther ? ''
Take it in your own hand .
`` A pretty way that would be !
She wished there was somebody to take her love to <NAME> .
He pointed impatiently to the papers as he spoke .
that there is no fear of my saying it unless I have your leave .
`` You have no inclination in <NAME> 's way ? ''
<NAME> , sir—peremptorily Thomas—Thomas Gradgrind .
I tried to lay my mind before her , truly , and entirely .
whispered the voice from the stair-head .
‘ He ’ d walk the journey in two days .
Do not look at me as if you thought me sorrowful .
‘ It has fetched a penny .
She dotes on poetry , sir .
said <NAME> to the <NAME> .
<NAME> Leicester dozes , starts up suddenly , and cries , `` Eh ?
With a stamp of her foot and a menace .
And they played many hundred thousand games of cribbage together .
With compliments to the Rev .
‘ They say , “ We know , Mr Riah , we know .
<NAME> , <NAME> , I am ashamed of you !
<NAME> <NAME> ! ’ ‘ I have seen some one , ’ returned <NAME> .
I had almost forgotten <NAME> 's poor little girl .
said Mrs. Mann , hearing the well-known shaking at the garden-gate .
‘ What is it ? ’ asked <NAME> .
It was all gone now , I remembered , getting up from the fire .
I do it to myself !
<NAME> <NAME> , who comes from Baden-Baden , purposely to talk to him .
At her chair , as usual , was <NAME> .
`` Thank you over and over again , father ! ''
Not for the first time to-day .
I only knew two sort of boys .
In <NAME> 's <NAME> XLII .
I was obliged to admit that <NAME> had considered it probable .
There never was a slave at once so devoted and ill-used by his mistress .
The town had been on fire ; in a blaze .
‘ I desire to make it a question of wages , altogether .
I ’ ll answer for it ’ s being all over with father .
‘ I ’ ll direct you from the door , the best I can .
he returned with a glance of something like apprehension at <NAME> .
For instance , I can teach your children something .
Shall we extract <NAME> ’ s masterly description of that heartrending scene ?
‘ Here , pretty ? ’ returned the <NAME> .
The only use you can put him to , '' says the venerable sage .
'Why , what should he say ? '
They knew that I fully understood her .
Oliver opened it , glided away , and gave place to <NAME> .
I assented with a smile .
But it brought no change of expression into the set face .
How did I know it ?
‘ I am nothing any more , that is not you .
`` I am rejoiced to hear it 's thriving , <NAME> . ''
cried the two young Cratchits .
<NAME> came to him in an ugly shape .
He looked at her with a real sentiment of remorseful tenderness and pity .
That would have served me right , though .
Although not an open face , there was no pretence in it .
‘ Do you stay here long , <NAME> ? ’ says <NAME> .
You know , you know I do ! ''
<NAME> too , I am told. ’ ‘ Indeed !
You have sustained a loss here .
Let me finish wot I was a telling you , dear boy .
I am not so much to look at , am I ?
he inquired , clearing his throat .
The desolate feeling with which I went abroad , deepened and widened hourly .
Do you hear ? ’ ‘ I hear , ’ replied <NAME> .
If so , that is their misfortune .
I am here , in a capacity of confidence .
I asked <NAME> if Mrs. <NAME> knew that her wedding-day was fixed .
The barrier was closed and strongly guarded when they rode up to it .
'Is -- is that a likeness , ma'am ? '
`` She 's as handy as it 's possible to be .
Agreed. ’ ‘ Carried at once , you see !
His men resumed their muskets and fell in .
Then she calls him vile impostor .
How truly gentlemanly he was !
'This war n't a put-up thing . '
It quite astonishes me , upon my word it does .
“ Come on at a footpace !
“ ' I do not address her brother ? '
‘ See here , <NAME> , ’ said the <NAME> .
<NAME> true to <NAME> , and Co to Pubsey ?
I stood face to face with <NAME> !
But that it should have been you who saw me !
‘ <NAME> impossible , ’ said <NAME> .
That 's where your temper got the better of you .
'It 's very comforting , ' said Mrs. Corney .
<NAME> crept softly upstairs , and entered it without any previous ceremony .
Oh , no , I do n't think so !
The <NAME> dropped a curtsey .
<NAME> , driving , lighted a cigar ; <NAME> declined one .
His attention in calling had been quite extraordinary .
Soften it as they would , their hearts were lighter .
<NAME> <NAME> liked this idea very much .
I sat listening for a long while , but there was not a sound .
The run of luck went against <NAME> .
But he turned even this against her .
Mr <NAME> agreed , and back they went .
That is not my fancy , <NAME> .
It was n't liked in the yard .
Not with the greatest urbanity , I must say .
‘ Easy to say somewhere ; not so easy to say where !
'In death , ' replied the woman , with something like a shudder .
said <NAME> ; 'try him , do ; only this one . '
So drooping her head again , she remained silent .
That image is shattered , and that idol is laid low .
Her colour , which had just now faded , returned , and faded again .
<NAME> and kind of you , and like you , deary !
‘ Do they use you ill here ?
‘ Nor do I wish to complain .
<NAME> <NAME> was sure to come back that evening before the bell rang .
I tell them that if I did restrain myself I should become imbecile .
I love and study the picturesque in all its varieties .
Of the strangers , he took no heed whatever .
<NAME> and appoint the evening after to-morrow , at seven , for the meeting .
Take my arm , take my arm .
you needn ’ t wince ! ’ said my aunt .
I have a great mind to say I wish I hadn ’ t .
There ’ s not much for you to do .
It was his amiable nature .
Now I 'm away into Lincolnshire after <NAME> 's mother ! ''
She shall have a dose , she shall have such a dose !
`` Listen then , my angel , '' says she after several sarcastic nods .
‘ And a ladder and basket if you like .
He inclined his head to <NAME> and me and spoke to my guardian .
She has expressed herself to me as wondering exceedingly at <NAME> .
The <NAME> 's <NAME> does a brisk stroke of business all the morning .
She rose from the bed , still gazing fixedly and steadily on me .
`` Why , what a laborious life ! ''
I was merely employed by a friend , my friend <NAME> , of <NAME> .
And she don ’ t know how she does it .
I have said that boldly -- oh , a score of times !
It 's turned wery dark , sir .
Oh , certainly not , ’ replied <NAME> .
To yourself and your merits , ’ was Mr <NAME> ’ s rejoinder .
‘ Now that the <NAME> is done with , it is .
‘ No , <NAME> , thank you ; good , good .
What money have we , <NAME> ?
And , little woman , do you likewise .
Consternation sat on every face .
I confessed that she had surprised us all .
‘ Now , <NAME> , what is the matter ?
A man so fond of his daughter , that he runs away from her !
`` Have you seen <NAME> , this morning , guardian ? ''
You won ’ t object to <NAME> .
Why , I have been ashamed of your moroseness there !
‘ <NAME> ‘ Tilda ! ’ sighed <NAME> , compassionately .
I know the way out perfectly .
‘ <NAME> , eh ? ’ cried <NAME> , affecting surprise .
In front is a green enclosure , called the <NAME> .
Mrs. and <NAME> Nickleby. ’ ‘ Oh , indeed ! ’ said <NAME> .
Oh yes , for I know his heart !
And if they are , it 's worth nothing to me . ''
<NAME> ’ t let it put you out of the way .
<NAME> <NAME> raised his eyebrows , and looked much concerned .
The instant she is on her legs , she rushes backward .
It is quite true that this is the case , my dear child .
These were my thoughts about <NAME> .
I have my Leave to <NAME> .
My child , ladies and gentlemen .
<NAME> <NAME> suddenly kneeled down before it , and began to loosen the dress .
That story never goes about .
‘ YOU know , ’ returned poor little Miss Podsnap .
I would rather that it might be so !
The journey has been its own reward .
‘ Oh , our Amy , our Amy ! ’ said <NAME> .
Whoever came about me , still settled down into <NAME> .
Why should you conceal it from me ?
'You 're a going to be made a 'prentice of , <NAME> . '
Upon my soul , you are a pretty piece of disinterestedness !
It must be done , as I may say , on the sly .
Fainting of D. and glass of water from public-house .
A foot of water in it , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ I am quite a solitary man now .
How long could I bear it ?
We ’ ll soon see about that , <NAME> , ’ grinned <NAME> .
But this is of no interest to you .
It is unfair , almost unkind , to urge it . '
<NAME> hard , but requiring to be shod with iron .
‘ Very , <NAME> , ’ responded <NAME> , looking intensely sage .
It was now midnight of the first day .
The letter gave me only five days ' notice of my removal .
`` Why -- not to-night , <NAME> , <NAME> . ''
<NAME> on coachey , drive on .
He never would leave him alone .
‘ Have you quite recovered that scoundrel ’ s attack ? ’ asked <NAME> .
Should I hasten from it altogether , pity -- forgive me .
<NAME> <NAME> , ’ interposed <NAME> ; whereupon <NAME> and <NAME> laughed in concert .
says <NAME> , drawing nearer to the fire and biting his unsteady thumb-nail .
This is our young church-keeper ?
“ Well ! ” cried my sister , with a mollified glance at <NAME> .
Take up the pen and finish .
`` My meritorious , distinguished , honourable officer ! ''
We all unpacked our baskets , and employed ourselves in getting dinner ready .
‘ Not above three-quarters of an hour , ’ was everybody ’ s reply .
But it has been my own mistake , <NAME> .
uncle ? ’ ‘ Ah , to be sure ! ’ sneered <NAME> .
His confinement is a hideous vision ; and his old life a reality .
<NAME> , ’ said <NAME> in explanation .
“ You may be certain that I laugh because they fail .
He seems half inclined for another voyage .
<NAME> fell one bird , and off flew the others .
If he were a common child , there would be nothing in it .
I was always being disappointed , for I got none .
Even in her sleep she is sobbing for <NAME> ’ ly .
<NAME> ’ s Introduction to a <NAME> Scene 12 .
<NAME> ’ t come here to-morrow , for this place will be shut up .
It persists in flitting and chattering about town .
Ill-treating the boys , you covetous , avaricious , in-sa-ti-a-ble old fence ? '
'How dare you say this of me ? '
I come to the level then .
It might seem like taunting her with her own poor fortunes .
No ; the confidential friend , <NAME> !
`` Pretty well so , <NAME> ; I do n't complain . ''
I ’ ll know what it means !
Might he ask , was dying of destitution and neglect necessarily <NAME> ?
‘ My Heart ’ s <NAME> ! ’ said the trembling Captain .
God bless both my children !
He is very like his sister .
Here is my hand on it .
<NAME> , <NAME> , though six weeks in arrear to my proprietor , declines .
‘ It may be done by degrees , <NAME> .
‘ That <NAME> ; has he been here ? ’ said <NAME> .
exclaimed the matron , in a much sweeter tone , 'is that Mr .
A moment ! ” He was tearing himself apart from her .
Call me Georgiana. ’ ‘ Dearest Georgiana , ’ Mrs <NAME> began again .
It was not my act ; it was yours .
What am I to do !
'That 's lucky -- for one of us .
cries mademoiselle , referring to <NAME> with ineffable disdain .
Both ate and drank , but <NAME> much the more abundantly .
You never could walk in mine !
said the stranger , with a sneer .
The parents here were elderly people : people of station , and rich .
To go on , my dear .
‘ A new one , ’ said <NAME> .
If you ’ ll only be so good as try me , <NAME> !
When I play , he never moves his eyes from my hands .
It certainly was plain -- threadbare -- almost shabby .
We had a temporary lodging in <NAME> .
‘ We shall see , ’ she assented .
She is sitting there before me .
<NAME> in that cool way of a fellow 's living there ? ''
This is MY lady , <NAME> . ''
‘ I should think it is ! ’ cried Mrs. Sparsit , exulting .
It was a fine night : not moonlight , but sultry and fragrant .
That 's the way I 've got the ill name of Chancery .
No , to be sure , and he would n't have , of course .
The woman has a good figure .
I know this service would be less distinguished than that which I have quitted .
`` You must have two lovers ! ''
They are not at all alike .
‘ There is an inscription here , ’ said <NAME> .
I have begun dreadfully ill. ’ ‘ Too true .
I have never known how to be .
`` And in very embarrassed circumstances . ''
You wouldn ’ t hear a word there , he said .
`` To keep 'em safe , sir , do n't you see ? ''
As he closed the door behind him , she looked round at her mother .
‘ What is the matter ? ’ ‘ <NAME> !
I ! ’ returned the other , with ready self-disparagement .
‘ Father of <NAME> ? ’ said he .
You have laboured on it , since .
'You see he knows me ! '
The pigmy to impose upon the giant .
‘ That ’ s like me -- I often do .
It is no worse , because I write of it .
The report that the great man was dead , got about with astonishing rapidity .
Therefore I undertook the commission .
Presently the honoured parent appeared to be adjusting some instrument like a great corkscrew .
I had far better have stated it to the bird .
‘ To be SURE ! ’ he says , then .
Another struck , before the voice of the previous hour had ceased to vibrate .
how many sad and unhappy beings had he left behind !
I even thought she felt this want a little , almost without knowing it .
‘ Now vere am I to pull up ? ’ inquired the driver .
cried the gentleman , as if his breath were taken away .
By degrees we appeared to contract our search within narrower and easier limits .
' I hope not , ' rejoined the old gentleman .
And now a last word , dearest and best of friends !
Yes , second day , ’ repeated the lady with an air of impatience .
They only want to have their rights explained to them , they do .
Then the <NAME> said , <NAME> me why .
<NAME> so well a kept house is not known to our men .
<NAME> <NAME> and Jo are sent out immediately on this work of improvement .
<NAME> ’ t tell me about <NAME> .
‘ Yes , I play picquet a little , ’ said Mr Carker .
The repetition of the word , brought <NAME> to a dead stand-still .
A bad bruise , and the skin sadly broken .
It 's rather jog-trotty and humdrum .
`` My Lady , I beg your pardon .
I ’ ll sit by you , you know .
It would have done you good to see how green a place it is .
A plot in the prisons , of the foreigner against the <NAME> .
‘ You say that as I describe them , they are perverted .
She merely proposed herself for your maid , you know .
‘ And are you sure you like me very much ? ’ says <NAME> .
<NAME> at her now she moves to put the kettle on .
Still , no communication was made to <NAME> .
He may tell you he is not .
Over yonder across the yard , at our fire ?
Never heerd of sich a think .
<NAME> is on your side , and hunger and thirst on mine .
`` <NAME> , be so good as to ring .
<NAME> come and see my lodging .
Our meeting was not cordial .
‘ And it ’ s <NAME> , is it ?
I shall never have such a ride again .
But neither of these resources was approved of in the parlour .
Think of this now , both of you .
‘ I rather believe I am , sir , ’ replied <NAME> .
<NAME> good-bye ! ’ ‘ Good-bye , ’ said Mr Boffin , shortly .
They put ‘ em in albums , I believe .
It bears out what I made of it .
Ai n't that a funny name ? ''
What is the matter ! ’ cried mother and son together .
That is so , is it not ? ''
<NAME> <NAME> ’ s positive refusal to gratify the company occasioned another silence .
But indeed she seemed disappointed that I was not .
He is light and active , I suppose .
At length she spoke again .
Better for our sakes , and better for yours , too .
Contents of chapter , “ His birth and estate .
'Good by , ' said <NAME> , stoutly .
‘ I shall require good bail , ’ said the magistrate .
“ <NAME> or small ? ” “ <NAME> , ” said I .
You know what honour he has always done me .
‘ My friend concerns me , and <NAME> is my friend .
So long as a servant was present , no other words passed between them .
You ought to have been in bed long ago .
‘ <NAME> , we DO ! ’ returned <NAME> , with great animation .
He was born in this town . '
I want to present you to my mother , Mr Clennam .
`` Quite a fate in it .
`` Aye , your ladyship , that 's the question !
“ What has gone wrong ? ” said <NAME> , calmly looking out .
You are not to associate with servants .
His banker ’ s was in the <NAME> .
‘ The wery same , miss , ’ replied <NAME> .
You understand how those things are managed ? ''
<NAME> , that they will : Mr <NAME> says he will .
Why should the young man be so calumniated ?
`` Your lip is trembling , '' said the <NAME> .
‘ I must have money , <NAME> .
You may depend upon it , <NAME> means something there .
Not a sound escaped from him .
<NAME> _as though_ crippled in the back. ’ ‘ Ran away , <NAME> .
Whereupon the footman disappeared , reappeared presenting <NAME> , and retired much disgusted .
‘ Go on , ’ said the judge .
The first object of consideration was to secure quarters for the night .
The house , when I came up to it , looked just the same .
She had never been a positively disagreeable object to him .
Ai n't there any other line open ? '
'What was the fate of the other -- the child ? '
But I was quite unsuccessful .
‘ Yes. ’ ‘ This is why , then .
A dead silence prevailed for some moments .
I should have missed forming such a friendship if you had n't come ! ''
' I told you I should interest you before long .
I shall sleep it off .
`` I beg your pardon , <NAME> .
`` These are very fine , '' said my guardian .
Here am I in the <NAME> .
Then we says , “ What will content you ?
Oliver hastened to comply with her request .
‘ Those who take money , take it to keep .
<NAME> nobody of it , and perhaps we may regain it .
‘ Exactly so , <NAME> ! ’ assented Mr Toots .
I ’ ll think maturely of it .
‘ Oh , certainly , ’ replied <NAME> .
‘ Whew ! ’ cried the <NAME> , looking round him .
Perhaps you may carry it out at some other time , forsooth .
What was a man to do ?
How she caressed the dog , and how the dog knew her !
A gold watch-chain , and seals , depended from his fob .
You are all wrong there , though otherwise as right as can be .
<NAME> <NAME> has always refused permission . ''
The old lady can not make enough of the old girl .
Miserable little propitiators of a remorseless <NAME> , how abject we were to him !
That is to say : Firstly .
It has gradually augmented , until it assumes the appearance of aberration of intellect .
Give me your arm again , Mr Nandy .
It ’ s <NAME> , ’ said the young fellow , pushing him in .
‘ He HAS a beautiful smile , ’ thought <NAME> .
‘ This accusation of yours must not be left half made and half unmade .
And how are you , my dear boy ? ''
Mrs. Sanders then appeared , leading in <NAME> .
`` No , '' said I , as she seemed to wait for me .
‘ How happy we should be ! ’ cried <NAME> with enthusiasm .
`` No , my <NAME> , I 've seen him ! ''
“ I have learnt next to nothing , <NAME> .
She is the pivot it all turns on . ''
‘ Let ‘ em tap , ’ replied his father , with dignity .
He sends his myrmidons to come over the fence and pass and repass .
On <NAME> , sweet , gentle girl !
`` No , guv'ner , '' returns <NAME> , shaking his head .
‘ He is just going to supper , <NAME> , ’ replied the girl .
I am very sorry indeed to hear it .
I , ’ he took out his pocket-handkerchief again and dabbed his face .
Let there be an end of the nonsense .
If ever you tell of me , I ’ ll tell of you .
Yes , <NAME> , long removed from the scenes of this poor history !
It was an elderly lady .
I said so all along . '
This is your son , as you can prove .
I can not say how glad I am to have this opportunity .
“ I am glad to see you , <NAME> .
A shake of the head from Mrs. Snagsby -- very long and very tight .
or should I brile a rasher ?
And I have a liking for rust and must and cobwebs .
‘ There are many people employed in the <NAME> .
‘ Hallo ! ’ replied <NAME> , turning round .
And , dear boy , how good looking you have growed !
He saw how anxious and timid she was , and appeared sorry .
‘ Do you suppose I am blind ?
Is there a chimney on fire ? ''
You wo n't answer the question , yes or no ?
‘ It ’ s nothing , <NAME> ; it ’ s nothing .
`` That I have heard , '' returned my guardian .
`` You -- you have found her so ? ''
‘ Now , <NAME> , see here , ’ said <NAME> .
Oh , take her to <NAME> , and go away , please !
( Must not D. C. confine himself to the broad pinions of Time ?
Then , O great Heaven , I saw it , close in upon us !
You two made the money up , you know !
‘ In the hat ? ’ cried <NAME> in a sort of shriek .
cries <NAME> , still more excited .
Burglary or pocket-picking wanted ‘ prenticeship .
And , once again , I am glad to see you , Watt ! ''
There are <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> .
<NAME> replies , `` As good as you can expect . ''
Do n't cry ; this is to be a day of joy .
Man with cork leg , from <NAME> ’ s .
But it was no bodily illness that affected her now .
We understand each other , you and me .
And Mr Wrayburn , <NAME> here !
Would she ever forget it ?
There was a wonderful air of benignity and patronage in his manner .
‘ <NAME> , by all means , ’ said Mr Dombey .
`` Answering my very thoughts -- always the same dear girl ! ''
The grey <NAME> pressed his hand , and tears rose in his eyes .
“ How much ? ” I asked the coachman .
I know its staid repose within .
This sacrifice of you must be ended .
Let him remember it in that room , years to come .
Brothers <NAME> and <NAME> struck in .
All were sincere and truthful in their sorrow .
`` I wish you could have gone .
'The question does not arise , and never will .
`` Yes , indeed , '' repeats <NAME> .
An Opinion Worn out by anxious watching , <NAME> fell asleep at his post .
‘ As you unfortunately find it to be , ’ returned the <NAME> .
<NAME> for yourself and take a seat in the chimbley-corner .
and to be ready to meet her when she comes out ?
'Where do you mean to stop for the night , <NAME> ? '
Then began the rarely lightened toil of the day among the village population .
Yes , I remembered that too , very well .
‘ And <NAME> , <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> .
rejoined the guard , touching his hat .
' I wish to serve you indeed . '
I own no particular country .
And I too , but a little while ago . ''
I waltz with the eldest Miss <NAME> once again .
He has got a power over me .
‘ Mr Wrayburn , pray , pray , leave me with this protector .
They wouldn ’ t add up , she said .
Mrs. Crupp then said what she would recommend would be this .
They ’ re the best schemes afloat .
`` I have quite recovered my health and my cheerfulness , '' said I .
'Do my hi 's deceive me ! '
`` I would rather be hanged in my own way .
To be sure , ’ rejoined the landlord .
'You 're getting too proud to own me afore company , are you ?
‘ You have said your say ; I am going to say mine .
But my little body will soon fall into the background now .
As he grows warm , the doctor and the four men cool .
Now , <NAME> , we 're ready for you . ''
“ A pleasure 's a pleasure all the world over .
‘ Better here than in the streets , ’ said my aunt .
They are cheerful , tranquil , and healthy .
<NAME> made his small eyes smaller in taking special note of his manner .
‘ Oh , do you think he won ’ t ?
‘ -- Hear me out ! ’ said <NAME> .
There is the truth for your comfort , however you like it .
'You know I was an only child .
<NAME> <NAME> , after some consideration , thus replied : ‘ Mr .
In a little carriage following it , <NAME> and the owner Mr Chick .
It was a night of tears .
Then she asked me if I had seen <NAME> .
I had let it go by , and had deservedly lost her .
He ’ ll never benefit himself in that way , patient and preoccupied workman .
I am aware that it is so prominent as to be discoverable immediately .
'Are you a weak creetur , Mrs .
And how I sped in it is all I have left to tell .
He was in <NAME> , of course .
Even <NAME> ’ s being here , is unprofessional .
It was <NAME> , and his faithful attendant , the fat boy .
‘ It ’ s all the same , my Lord , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Why do you talk to me of combining together ?
‘ Nothing escapes their notice , sir .
It is a settlement of the <NAME> Indians who inhabit this place .
`` Go on to the next ! ''
<NAME> was thoroughly exhausted , and he had lain him down to die .
Here is my Beauty daughter , married these three years .
What ’ s your name ? ’ asked <NAME> .
‘ I see you are in earnest .
“ Are you dying for him ? ” she whispered .
In all of which particulars he was very like the dog .
`` Do you think it will ever be in a settled state ? ''
‘ You are stupid enough , I suppose .
Where is my brother Ned ?
It ’ s just the same principle as the use of the globes .
<NAME> at that boy -- himself a pupil .
But we ’ ll soon see all about that .
‘ They allowed me the stage-coach-hire -- outside stage-coach-hire all the way .
I won ’ t talk to you without wine .
Why , you went to the <NAME> .
And she kept her word ?
‘ No , <NAME> , ’ I replied .
Is its pattern strange to you ? ''
I wish to have a word with him . ''
‘ By all means , ’ said <NAME> .
`` Now , what do you say to that ? ''
And so saying she resumed her work , as did the others .
He may sleep on while he may .
Shirking wo n't do for me .
He ’ s a liberal sort of fellow .
‘ Why it ’ s as black as jet !
He had even begun to haunt the court .
As they passed <NAME> , the clock struck seven .
I heard all kinds of things about the school and all belonging to it .
Yes , time was nearly out .
An oyster of the old school whom nobody can open .
You have not come to say that , I know . ''
<NAME> <NAME> ’ s little bedstead is carried off in a donkey-tandem .
You are a good , thoughtful girl .
All I have to live upon , in my old age .
You never heard of anything of that sort ? ''
‘ Be it as it may , <NAME> approved of me .
I 'm a going -- as your mother knows -- a fishing .
<NAME> ’ s ship was still unheard of .
Shortly afterwards , his mouth began to widen again .
It was lonely and wild , but oppressive in its barren monotony .
<NAME> <NAME> promptly walked forth , to execute his commission .
What a beautiful , mild face that lady 's is ! '
I am very fond of your sister .
‘ Merely going on in the old way , ma ’ am .
`` It is not for me to come here to complain of my Lady .
`` You appear to know a good deal , '' <NAME> retorts .
‘ You will come home with me , <NAME> , and see my baby .
Now wait a bit. ’ <NAME> wiped his head again .
`` Very proud to have the honour !
‘ I can ’ t keep away from it .
As it is , the task is a difficult one .
They all came together at the door-steps .
He then begins to clear away the breakfast .
“ It is enough , my husband , ” said <NAME> .
He was afraid of me .
God save the king ! ” ‘ The prince remained to hear no more .
But the brilliant and distinguished circle will soon do that .
And poor you and me , too , ’ returned <NAME> , rather sharply .
There was a round of applause every time he spoke .
‘ Not much , ’ said <NAME> , rubbing his back very hard .
It had no variety but in depth .
<NAME> <NAME> laughs and drinks .
You swear it ? ’ ‘ Certainly. ’ ‘ Sworn !
‘ Severe weather , <NAME> , ’ observed <NAME> .
She is not quite prostrated by fatigue ? ''
She was then just abreast of the rotted bride-cake .
“ This is altogether a Walworth sentiment , please. ” “ I understand .
But custom , combined with science -- particularly science -- inured me to it .
It is the earnest face of a woman who is young and handsome .
I can bear it ; anything but suspense !
And yet it ’ s a fine thing not to understand ‘ em .
‘ So loving , so confiding , and so young !
<NAME> ’ s mind throughout the last six months had been stormily confused .
How can I say , when I never knew ?
Say it for goodness ’ sake , ’ returned the young lady .
'No , ' replied the old lady , giving it to him mechanically .
In face she was no less remarkable than in manner .
‘ Touts for licences , ’ replied <NAME> .
Him that shall be nameless is liable to be talked over .
`` What work are you about now ? ''
We have been together ever since , sharing my small means .
He was full eighteen minutes and a half behind his time .
She left him , and they parted .
‘ What ’ s the matter ? ’ asked the man .
I was a real country boy , once .
But we love one another truly , I am sure .
What is this dark mystery ?
They were within sight of the lights in his windows , and he stopped .
‘ What did she say ? ’ inquired <NAME> eagerly .
The bar of <NAME> is scattered over the face of the earth .
He would be as likely to believe me guilty as not ; perhaps more .
He kept him small on purpose , and let him out by the job .
`` Thank you , '' said my guardian .
I shall send <NAME> for the letter . ''
Mrs <NAME> had her books open on her little table .
You 'll do yourself a mischief .
I answered <NAME> , and told him that <NAME> had introduced his name .
I shall be better presently. ’ He closed his eyes .
‘ Restless without the little girl , ’ the <NAME> whispered Mr Dombey .
‘ The miser ? ’ ‘ Ah , people called him a miser .
He repairs to <NAME> , and knocks softly at the door .
He shuddered and tottered to his feet .
You shall hardly feel it. ’ ‘ Not yet .
'But at so early an age ! '
Have you money for your lodging ? ''
I may become so , but I can not bear it yet .
She knew how trial and emotion would exalt and strengthen it .
<NAME> took his road ; we took ours .
He tells it as he does it in mere simplicity .
So let us always do a kindness , and be over-rejoiced .
One of these particularly touched me .
<NAME> <NAME> accordingly withdrew ; and left the party to their repose .
said the Jew , with a threatening look .
He felt it necessary to explain himself .
A very regular feature on the face of the country , <NAME> was .
Within a year , I married him .
A gentleman can bear a shock when it must come , boldly and steadily .
If I had only known it yesterday I could have told -- drive there !
‘ Oh dear no ! ’ said <NAME> .
It ’ s not yet brought to an exact allowance .
You are never so to me .
‘ Somebody ’ s knuckles , <NAME> , ’ answered Rob the <NAME> .
‘ Tight in the arms and legs , you know ?
I can not look upon my book , for I must look upon <NAME> .
But you shall say no more , sir .
In that giddy whirl of noise and confusion , the men were delirious .
Is there danger of another ?
`` Only for the best , guardian , '' said I .
says <NAME> , looking up the staircase .
`` He has n't forgotten the appointment , I hope ? ''
‘ Has there been no night ?
But it ’ s all over , a long while .
`` <NAME> is in attendance upon <NAME> , I believe ? ''
'Never mind which part it is .
So he stops short : cries ( to the horses again ) ‘ <NAME> .
too , joined in the pursuit like good citizens .
<NAME> had already clattered down-stairs .
‘ What ’ s the last bulletin about mother-in-law ? ’ ‘ Mrs .
said <NAME> , smiling brightly .
Durdles with his dinner-bundle in his hand , is indeed beheld slouching towards them .
He looked strong , but he wasn ’ t .
And downstairs she was led accordingly , accompanied by her affectionate son .
`` I am up to all that . ''
But <NAME> gallantly maintains her point .
Mrs. <NAME> shook her head , sighed , and looked in the glass .
“ He is not , ” returned the clerk .
‘ Stop , sir ! ’ cried Mr Dorrit .
<NAME> used to fly a kite .
I 've put away money , only for you to spend .
‘ I shall be charmed , ’ said Mr Dombey to <NAME> .
“ Yes , thank you. ” “ Come , then !
Consequently , <NAME> beasts seldom fail to find a ready market .
‘ And <NAME> has he gone ? ’ said <NAME> .
Are they locked ? ’ The turnkey was discomfited .
‘ Are you there ? ’ said <NAME> .
`` Out of the question , '' says the coroner .
It wants a bit of youth as much as it wants fresh air . ''
There was a <NAME> .
‘ Hollo ! ’ repeated <NAME> , still more gruffly .
‘ I am safe here , ’ was her last benumbed thought .
I am so very miserable , and I like you so much ! ''
A butcher I once dealt with occupied that very ground .
No , no , that he wouldn ’ t .
I caught at the name directly .
'Shall I go downstairs , sir ? '
'The old gentleman over the way ? '
‘ It is not possible , ’ said Mr Abel .
I finished by saying , ‘ I ’ ll give you Steerforth !
`` Now , why do n't you take my advice ? ''
As if on purpose to prevent his doing any good for himself !
And will they in the sight of heaven -- ?
‘ I ’ ll saunter on by the river , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Contemplating the scene ? ’ inquired the dismal man .
said <NAME> , receiving this new light with a most agreeable jocularity of surprise .
I say , with him , let this quarrel be adjusted now .
At sight of the gentleman in the office , <NAME> turns very red .
<NAME> is full. ’ ‘ Full ! ’ thought <NAME> .
I liked her better in the Desert of <NAME> .
`` You act according to my opinion ? ''
‘ That you could hurt anyone I love !
In short , it is business .
The three most obtrusive houses near at hand are the three meanest .
I have suspected young <NAME> of this bank-robbery from the first .
‘ <NAME> ? ’ said <NAME> , stepping up to his master .
'What should he have to mind ? '
The tailor ’ s daughter replied in the affirmative .
‘ Now old gentleman , ’ said <NAME> , looking round .
My dear <NAME> , welcome back !
We are all so happy now , dear !
‘ Yes , and mine first , ’ replied Mrs. Lillyvick .
`` I am your guardian and your father now .
‘ Hollo ! ’ was the sound that roused him .
His shop is called the Court of Chancery .
The jailer shrugged his shoulders .
It is such weary , weary work ! ''
She was about to say ?
Not a copper farthing 's worth of it !
‘ There , there , there ! ’ said he .
‘ All ready ; nobody at home .
Why does the <NAME> ’ s eye read them , one by one ?
So I have. ’ <NAME> ’ s brightened face brightens still more .
Why do you wish to return to companions you paint in such terrible colors ?
Mrs. <NAME> could not help ruminating on what <NAME> ’ s friend had said .
' I suppose you do n't even know what a prig is ? '
I could not undo that .
`` Could I speak to you alone for a moment ? ''
Who would put the devil out . ''
I would write your letters , under your direction .
The cell had been built for many years .
‘ Yes ; dear in his self-made prosperity , madam , I dare say .
<NAME> ’ t blame me for this public interference .
In a trice <NAME> snaps a handcuff on her wrist .
‘ How shall we live without , <NAME> ? ’ said I .
I ask it in all honour and respect .
“ What would present company say to ten pound ? ” demanded <NAME> .
I will ! ’ The wretched creature seemed to suffer acutely under this renunciation .
'We do n't want any of your interference .
I could have told you that , a month ago .
‘ About the glimpse of the better world , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Leave the room ! ’ said <NAME> , glaring upon the bewildered youth .
Sometimes I thought of telling <NAME> .
It has come to other men who do nothing but waste and riot .
`` They dies everywheres , '' said the boy .
We shall rouse up that nest of sleepers , mark my words ! ''
Bless you , man alive , I ’ m everywhere .
Do we need refreshment then , my friends ?
Is <NAME> cold , that she should tremble !
`` He looks very ill. Dreadfully anxious . ''
Mr <NAME> opined that he painted anything , if he could get the job .
‘ Shut your eyes up tight , <NAME> .
You are ruffled by the want of another cigar .
The robbery was committed by another boy .
He had had a very good bed .
‘ Take his hand before my very face ! ’ ‘ Mr .
Whether he did get anything important out of him , will immediately appear .
<NAME> bears the concise testimony , `` A few ! ''
‘ What have you been dreaming of ?
`` We must engage a good one for you . ''
‘ Right ! ’ exclaimed <NAME> with another chop .
I subscribed to this with all my heart , <NAME> knows .
Again it seemed to look upon him .
There are various public institutions .
‘ I came here by the <NAME> coach , today .
‘ Ha , ha , ha ! ’ rejoined the collector .
It was n't approved by the other lodgers .
They were yet seated in the same place , when the grandfather approached .
I am not alone , you see .
It must not be left imperfect .
I put the question personally , but there ’ s nothing personal in it .
Show him that shoe you are working at .
‘ And you have such a cheerful spirit ! ’ he said , fondly .
But it did just keep us on , the two together .
says he , catching it as it drops and looking round .
‘ You have children of your own , ’ said Mr Dombey .
he 's out , or he would have murdered him , ' replied <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> was very anxious that I should stay to dinner .
'Yes , I do mean to tell you so , ' replied <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> out of town ! ’ said <NAME> , slowly .
`` I am behind my time . ''
Never you mind what I say till it 's given in evidence .
‘ I ’ ve right good friends in <NAME> .
If they know me to be that , they know enough .
A mistake , a mistake , ’ said <NAME> .
Then he is to have her taught .
`` Could you trust in him ? ''
Every word from you is a blow for me .
I worship the eldest Miss Larkins .
I thought I heard you call me twice before !
Four of these have for their subjects prominent events in the revolutionary struggle .
`` Receive the assurance of my devoted gratitude , dear sir . ''
I was clearly on my way there .
He was sententious and didactic that night .
The folks call me a miser , my dear .
‘ Show the lady in. ’ Lady shown in , comes in .
Not finding it at number one , they come to number two .
‘ He has , <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> .
I happened to bring <NAME> and <NAME> together .
I should think there was somebody suspected .
`` Those are about the facts . ''
you men are such vain creatures ! ’ cried <NAME> .
Take it away , my dear .
And I felt absolutely certain that this woman was <NAME> 's mother .
<NAME> , daughter of <NAME> and <NAME> .
She said so , last night , when I showed her your letter .
What can be expected of him ?
I beg that you do not .
I do n't think your friend 's there . '
‘ Now let me see what becomes of you .
‘ Why tolerably , I should think , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Not after a week ’ s grace to consider ? ’ ‘ No !
There is excitement in the Veneering mansion .
'Do n't fret your eyelids on that score , ' said the young gentleman .
‘ But he brought me back before , and will again .
repeats Jo , something troubled in his mind .
said the young woman , ' I have found him !
most gracious <NAME> heretofore the <NAME> , where is that emigrant ?
<NAME> by was a small stone-quarry .
He ’ s a little pulled down , our friend here .
Perhaps you can hardly understand it .
‘ I shall never be better any more .
He then referred to a memorandum .
I wish to compare his writing with some that I have .
He was overawed by the <NAME> , and profoundly courteous to the attorney .
<NAME> , sir ? ’ abruptly turning to <NAME> .
Stay with your uncle , <NAME> ?
`` What 's the use of that ?
‘ <NAME> fishing for motives , when they ’ re on the surface !
<NAME> ’ t you been a little strict with Mr Rokesmith to-night ?
'Or he wo n't , and that 's the same thing .
You ’ ll go along with me ? -- Well !
She too studies something at her leisure .
`` I should have some fashionable conversation , here , then . ''
The twins testified their joy by several inconvenient but innocent demonstrations .
Here was this poor lad .
Much obliged to you for your attention .
‘ I ’ ll tell you how , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Half a crown , ’ said <NAME> , meditating .
‘ An ’ t you happy ? ’ she asked him .
`` Have you come merely to say so ? ''
`` Oh , that he is a great man !
`` Repeal this statute , my good sir ? ''
‘ Add the evenings so occupied together , and what do they come to ?
But , the truth is , talent is not wanted in the <NAME> .
‘ But I know that they are always saying something .
I 'm going to take a holiday .
Then the grand funeral moves slowly down the street .
Are you better ? ’ ‘ Much better .
‘ Not more than any other place .
<NAME> is now highly connected .
It might seem like reminding her of her having cast herself away .
It was long before <NAME> awoke .
But it is soon over .
Mrs <NAME> made leading remarks to <NAME> , only requiring monosyllabic replies .
We have nothing to do with disastrous voyages here , my good fellow .
How he was suffocated with questions , <NAME> .
COULD you give us 'British <NAME> , ' my fine fellow ? ''
He wonders where he is .
I will be plain with you both .
The constraint that had been put upon me , was quite abandoned .
‘ Have I made you unhappy , father ?
'Oliver , ' said <NAME> ; 'Oliver what ?
'By me , ' said <NAME> .
He can ’ t say nothing but cheek .
What a fuss there is !
‘ Oh ! ’ said the boy , colouring .
They are not sure , but they are safe enough .
If you must know , of course there ’ s no escape for me .
‘ Oh , drat the man ! ’ cried <NAME> .
This appeal of <NAME> ’ s made a strong impression on me .
‘ To dinner , ’ answered the dragon .
He was very much attached to me , was <NAME> .
I make the house uncomfortable .
Was it a sharp tooth , hey ?
I do n't mind telling you .
<NAME> : Can you instance any type of that class ?
`` Oh , you do n't know me ! ''
Where is the man who was here ?
Folded roughly like a letter , and directed to me at my guardian 's .
No doubt her life is darkened by the cloud that darkens yours .
‘ No. ’ ‘ It is a pity , ’ she returned .
‘ That ’ s right ! ’ said Mr Boffin .
I hope you will excuse my want of acquaintance with the polite world . ''
I have no hope at all .
The little old man took up a candle and went to open the door .
Her situation was , indeed , one of no common trial and difficulty .
She ’ ll come through it , the true golden gold .
That ’ s nothing , that ain ’ t , ’ said <NAME> .
Dear me , my love ; Mr Carker , too !
Bless you , they know ME ! ''
<NAME> <NAME> takes the opportunity of a pause to be heard again .
‘ You shall find her out yourself .
'Did she say any more , <NAME> dear , while I was gone ? '
‘ No , <NAME> , ’ said my aunt .
<NAME> <NAME> shall be rewarded .
I thanked him with my whole heart .
I feel as if I should die : it makes me tremble so . '
`` Who could be encouraged by <NAME> ? ''
That ain ’ t no part of my duty .
'They fired and hit the boy .
<NAME> <NAME> proposed <NAME> ; <NAME> proposed the old lady .
<NAME> , will you leave us for a few minutes ? '
“ Have you ? ” “ Of late , very often .
‘ He is nothing to me now , <NAME> -- less than nothing .
' I am afraid you have got yourself into a scrape there , Mr .
It was not until then that <NAME> silently resumed his place in the choir .
But it 'll do as well as anything else ! ''
Oh , that very bad child !
What will become of her !
The name of that lady by the teapot , is Mrs. Sparsit .
The <NAME> of a Gentleman 32 .
It is not for your ears . ''
But I give you warning that this mean calculation is wrong .
‘ You learnt a great deal , <NAME> , and so did your brother .
“ And what coarse hands he has !
'Could n't you hear the noise ? '
We shall be very poor .
‘ Ah , it does , indeed , ’ replied <NAME> .
The boy replied , at one .
I never thought of that. ’ ‘ Oh !
<NAME> 's miserable , and no wonder !
When the clock struck eleven , this domestic ball broke up .
I am happy in it .
Now , I want to ask you something else .
‘ As many words as you like , sir , ’ rejoined <NAME> .
<NAME> ’ ever , that ’ s neither here nor there .
‘ I ain ’ t , ’ returned the young man , grievously oppressed .
It 's a tainting sort of weather . ''
<NAME> says it ; <NAME> knows it ; J .
‘ The boat brought you word , I suppose ? ’ said my aunt .
They have a higher right than ours . ''
Oh , he is going to tell something at last !
‘ Small-clothes certainly , and -- and -- rough grey stockings , too .
My name is <NAME> , sir , ’ said the stranger .
<NAME> , you see me and you hear me .
‘ Dogs is not viewed with favour .
And the old name in the old tone fell so naturally on my ear !
You 'd have thought ! ” said <NAME> ; and <NAME> left off .
“ <NAME> , ” said <NAME> , mournfully , “ put the salt on .
`` I thought you might like that better , '' says <NAME> .
They ’ ll not object to me .
The coaches are something like the <NAME> coaches , but not nearly so good .
He passes close by them , seeing nothing but the ground .
‘ I have not had that pleasure , <NAME> , ’ rejoined the landlord .
The streets were thronged with working people .
You were quite right in that , ’ said <NAME> , interrupting .
I don ’ t speak of your digestion .
`` You had better dine out comfortably somewhere , '' said his son .
`` Was you a party in anything , ma'am ? ''
I am not at all pleased with your looks .
They filled a tumbler with wine , and held it to his lips .
<NAME> <NAME> was no longer a beadle .
I therefore observed I was not quite sure of that .
“ Eighteen years ! ” said the passenger , looking at the sun .
The child ’ s heart beat high with hope and confidence .
He fancies that she feels a slight , when there is none .
‘ Where ? ’ ‘ At his journey ’ s end .
There is a very halo of delight round his glowing forehead .
If this fellow is a gentleman , I _don't_ understand him .
The <NAME> battlements arose upon my view at eight o'clock .
The house was quiet , and all the lights were out .
It was soon a funeral procession .
I turn hot when I remember the cravat I bought .
‘ That ’ s just his age , ’ he said .
“ They shall be yourn , dear boy , if money can buy 'em .
The intelligence is of a singular kind , and singularly obtained .
It was a mere shell .
This is them two young sisters what tied themselves together with a handkecher .
What do you make of it ? ’ said <NAME> .
At length the long-expected knock was heard .
It seemed such an extraordinary thing to have <NAME> always there .
I don ’ t mind trying him again , at your request .
'Quite perfect , ' rejoined <NAME> , clapping him on the shoulder .
Of the stealthy comers , <NAME> was one , and <NAME> Noggs the other .
Call to mind that I am a very helpless and defenceless little thing .
I never leave my room .
I would not suffer it .
‘ Put my meaning into any words you like , ’ said I .
She perceived it in an instant .
It seems to me to be a general rule .
It is but one more link to the strong chain that binds us together .
Most welcome to Ba -- ath , sir .
Do I not know that ? ''
Yet she might not have thought him old .
`` <NAME> , you see she 's universally admired .
I acknowledged his attention incoherently , and began to think this was a dream .
What a load off my mind !
‘ Just so , ’ said Mrs. Micawber .
Little Eyes thinks of <NAME> .
I rouse myself , and look out of bed .
Is it because we are invited ?
I noticed that these bonds were all portions of a gentleman 's dress .
Forgive my having wronged you so much .
It ’ s the best news I have heard for many a day .
‘ I am resolved to be .
Take me as I am .
It may have been my birthday .
<NAME> , anticipating the last movement , was on the staircase .
‘ I am not , ’ returned <NAME> , with a sob .
I was there at seven o ’ clock this morning .
That is one of my boys , sir .
I know no <NAME> .
The light was the joint product of a fire and a candle .
I consider that a dangerous proceeding .
No , I a n't read the little book wot you left .
<NAME> <NAME> came to the gate .
‘ I will , ma ’ am , ’ replied <NAME> .
‘ She shall find me go her way .
I only want to be consulted sometimes .
I ’ ll tell you what has happened by-and-by , when I can .
Much needed , madam , ’ he added , in a lower voice .
‘ Done her a world of good turns , and the children too .
They have brought in both their people .
You remember ? ” “ Remember ! ” said he .
You find him in my house , you find him in my business .
‘ She ’ s in the front parlour , all ready .
The young surgeon examines the dress on the law-writer .
`` You are right , '' says <NAME> .
`` Probably , '' returns <NAME> , quietly blowing his nose .
Besides , I was too ill-looking , and their wives complained of me . ''
Do you -- ’ ‘ My good soul , ’ interposed <NAME> soothingly .
‘ <NAME> ’ ee , my love , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ No harm in a handkerchief <NAME> , whatever .
The entrance of the lost child made a slight sensation , but not much .
`` <NAME> , '' said the <NAME> .
Why , my dear boy , she ’ s behind the window curtain !
What was it you were not ?
The old lady dropped a curtsey .
‘ But who do you call a woman ?
I felt my own attracted , no less steadily , to his .
“ I hope you want nothing ?
Likewise , for Mrs Tapkins at <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> .
But do n't look at me in that way , man .
`` Oh no , you wo n't , '' says our overseer . '
“ Meant to be so , ” said <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> and myself live but to be united .
He will write to her ?
You notice where he is now , and how engaged ? ’ ‘ Yes .
‘ Yes , I should think so !
‘ Mrs Boffin you ’ re already acquainted with .
Then , he softly called , “ Enter there !
He do n't usually cut his time so fine as that .
‘ <NAME> , <NAME> ! ’ said the spinster aunt emphatically .
`` Not if it 's <NAME> , <NAME> , I have not . ''
The <NAME> , the <NAME> , the Boffins !
‘ <NAME> ’ r ! ’ said the <NAME> .
On this question there arose the edifying brow-beating , customary on such points .
But really , I am afraid I am too -- No ?
There 's no simile for his lungs .
Well ? ” “ What next , I mean ? ” said <NAME> .
I observed the young woman , Mr Clennam .
‘ Oh ! ’ said Mr Rugg , looking up .
They dies more than they lives , according to what I see . ''
You have not come here to hear this .
The satisfaction of the <NAME> was now complete .
'What do yer talk about such things for ? '
‘ Have you any news ? ’ said <NAME> .
‘ What is it that ’ s amiss ?
In reference to <NAME> 's pursuit of his interests -- '' `` Oh !
'You do n't happen to know any good of him , do you ? '
With a bottle-nosed captain that any man might have considered himself safe from .
‘ In fact , could not be better .
I never can do worse than I have done here .
They say they are , but they all say that .
‘ I hope so , ’ answered <NAME> .
‘ “ I came to dig a grave , <NAME> , ” stammered <NAME> .
‘ Yes , <NAME> , my good Angel !
NOW tell me I am a liar ! ’ said the honest man .
The footsteps approached nearer ; they reached the landing .
‘ She is very dangerously ill , ’ she added .
You must make up your mind to remain <NAME> , I think . ''
‘ Nor even most people , it may be hoped .
They examine the door-posts of number one , seeking the name they want .
‘ Never again , ’ said the child .
He ’ ll never love his father , he won ’ t .
cried <NAME> , struggling in the man 's powerful grasp .
'We thought we 'd lost you , Jo ! '
I had put an end to the pardnership .
<NAME> Tulkinghorn looking at the law-stationer .
`` Go on , sir , go on .
‘ To secure Mr <NAME> ? ’ The lady placidly assented .
‘ See what a situation you have placed me in ! ’ urged <NAME> .
Pay up , or produce your property !
`` This is my grandson , '' says <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> merely pointed to the empty measure .
Do you know this young lady , sir ? '
‘ A what ! ’ exclaimed <NAME> .
He was Chairman of this , <NAME> of that , President of the other .
`` What were you going to tell me ? ''
‘ Except the sisters , ’ says Mr Perch .
I have not strength or spirits now . '
You are such great people , my lady , ’ said I .
There were three ladies in the room and one gentleman .
‘ Where have you sent her to ? ’ asked the fat lady .
<NAME> DRIVER ( louder than before ) .
You must excuse the <NAME> name. ’ <NAME> stared at her .
“ It comes slowly. ” “ It comes surely , ” said <NAME> .
What an insubstantial , happy , foolish time it was !
'Blathers and <NAME> , themselves , could make nothing of it . '
Why do n't I know him ?
I should be glad after that , and proud and happy .
There are three meals a day .
My aunt sits with my hand in hers all the way .
The child meekly raised his eyes , and encountered those of <NAME> .
I will have no youth and truth dragged down to my level .
Is that the sort of fellow ?
I am sorry to say , I am not a favourite with Mr Dombey .
As long as that certainty shall last , I will befriend him .
To the Devil with yourself !
`` Not coming upon <NAME> Day ! ''
The debilitated cousin only hopes some fler 'll be executed -- zample .
‘ This , ’ replied <NAME> , shaking the parchment .
'What the devil do you come in between me and my dog for ? '
‘ There is my past and my present wasted life .
'Have it your own way , ' rejoined the girl , affecting to laugh .
At length he raised his head .
struck up `` <NAME> de <NAME> . ''
A generous thing , a noble thing , a delightful thing .
I was to have dined out along with <NAME> .
He did so , and came back again .
`` Bless you , and thank you , my worthy soul ! ''
I have welcomed many gentlemen to these walls .
I find the nights long , for I sleep but little and think much .
‘ I ’ m in wonderful feather , sir .
I was quite unable to speak , at first .
And that would be very unjust. ’ ‘ True , ’ said <NAME> .
“ Then it must be a shilling , ” observed the coachman .
‘ Your face is changed , ’ cried <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> and <NAME> , ’ he repeated mechanically .
I never can make that perfectly clear .
The <NAME> before the Marriage 31 .
The wicket opened on a stone staircase , leading upward .
'And who can wonder if it be so , mother ? '
At length I obtained possession of it .
‘ At <NAME> , <NAME> is , ’ observed <NAME> .
You won ’ t catch me at that just yet , sir .
Recomposing himself on the sofa like the second gentleman in <NAME> .
So I come round to <NAME> .
`` I am responsible to no Lord Chancellor in her case . ''
And this is the eternal law .
You speak rather sadly , Mr Rokesmith. ’ ‘ It sounds to me so .
He began to look at them as soon as it was light .
<NAME> <NAME> acknowledged the compliment .
I can ’ t play to you , or sing to you .
`` Very well , you ungrateful , naughty , hard-hearted boy ! ''
‘ I have just skimmed it .
‘ Let me see , I must recollect a bit .
He grinned vacantly at <NAME> .
However , it seems to be extremely desirable in every point of view .
But , nobody is half so much amazed as <NAME> , <NAME> , M.P .
He had scarcely moved since her arrival .
He has been in my house .
are you nothing ? ’ he returned .
What words could better define the fact ?
He seemed quite delighted with it on my account .
The court was paved , from floor to roof , with human faces .
But I can do one thing , <NAME> , I can hold my tongue .
What would you say to our Secretary ? ’ ‘ My dear !
I will begin this very day .
<NAME> rub uds too , ' added <NAME> .
<NAME> idiot , rushing to a precipice !
He stepped in ; <NAME> followed him .
It may do you some good , <NAME> .
‘ Your niece. ’ ‘ What of her ? ’ asked <NAME> sharply .
‘ Will you show yourself to them , Mr Dorrit ?
Not a word was spoken .
They are brothers , those men .
He falls asleep sometimes , you know .
He was made of sweetness .
‘ I am thankful I stayed !
‘ <NAME> _you_ , ma ’ am , ’ returned the light porter .
‘ But look here , ’ quoth the turnkey .
‘ I don ’ t know how it comes about .
In fact , as yet she has n't favoured them at all . ''
I was writing to you , Esther . ''
There were three reasons for his doing so .
They -- they ’ re a metaphysical sort of thing .
I am not the man I was .
‘ Who have you got in <NAME> ? ’ asked <NAME> .
The third day came and went , the fourth , the fifth .
'This poor child can never have been the pupil of robbers ! '
‘ Have you lived much alone ? ’ asked <NAME> .
The swollen lead-coloured under lip trembled with a shameful whine .
That 's the arrangement , is n't it , <NAME> ? ''
What else can I call home ?
The few foot-passengers start , stop , and stare about them .
Where is my wife ? ” “ Eh , well !
Your time shall be mine .
Why , you little wretch -- ' 'Stop , Mrs. Mann , stop ! '
This is an important subject .
But this is not encouraging , ’ thought <NAME> as they turned again .
With that gentleman ’ s assistance , <NAME> raised <NAME> to his feet .
Here is the country road , and here is the day .
He couldn ’ t remain here then .
<NAME> hear one word from me before you go !
Now that 's very creditable , you know .
Had it a deep prong , hey ?
I am looked upon about here as a second <NAME> defying the lightning .
It was impossible not to notice the change in the cherub ’ s appearance .
‘ You know <NAME> ? ’ peeping round into his face .
What 's my head running against ! ''
I don ’ t know , ’ said <NAME> .
Do n't mind him , my dear ; do n't mind him .
And my hands seem nailed through to the sculls .
`` They have no consciousness of us . ''
I am glad of it , and so are you , with reason .
He always chews and always spits , and never encumbers himself with a pocket-handkerchief .
‘ Thank you , ’ said <NAME> .
The gentleman who spoke last was unconsciously right .
I ’ ve daughters of my own .
A longer look than that , <NAME> .
These exertions were but ill repaid .
A knell from the church bell broke harshly on these youthful thoughts .
cried <NAME> , appealing to the bystanders .
‘ And is as trustworthy as the <NAME> of England. ’ <NAME> laughed .
‘ Order in the diwision under your charge , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Surely you don ’ t doubt -- ’ I began .

I do not say she does repent it .
Before service , intellect , and so on .
He will turn his face in a moment .
<NAME> had come upon the crowded city .
No ; yet more like that .
Let her rest , and forget them , ’ said the old gentleman .
Remember this , and keep my confidence .
said the master at length , in a faint voice .
`` And what is that upon your cheek ? ''
He never could have stood upon his legs , that bird .
The temptation to take the stranger with him was equally great .
“ Have you been to the Grove since ? ” said <NAME> .
‘ Dost thee know where thee livest ?
‘ Please to walk in , ’ said <NAME> , haughtily .
‘ You know where to find me ? ’ Reserve again saluted .
He told me I did not do myself justice .
Let him 'ware them , when he 's lost his nevvy !
`` I see <NAME> every morning , <NAME> . ''
Could I possibly go down there , labelled “ ELIGIBLE .
‘ Why then , I tell you what , ’ said he .
In this altered form , the <NAME> received Mr Toots .
<NAME> <NAME> is a young lady who deeply respects you , father . ''
‘ Your health ! ’ He took another sip .
You have invariably been treated very kindly .
<NAME> rustled , feathers waved , lights shone , and jewels sparkled .
We lay there seven hours , to deliver and exchange the mails .
‘ You villain of ill-omen ! ’ said <NAME> .
‘ You tell him so now .
‘ You may retire. ’ <NAME> did retire accordingly .
She ai n't one to blab .
of course they would , ’ replied Perker .
Wot did the lady say to her ?
'Yes , yes , ' urged the girl .
<NAME> <NAME> dines alone in her own room to-day .
The buzz of the great flies was loud again .
“ The question is , Would you want anything ?
Do you remember the nights in the bedroom ?
He was so very sorry for me that he could scarcely speak .
We will state where he was , in the next chapter .
With the flies a falling into the gallipots by fifties !
Boys have generally excellent appetites .
I really had some thoughts of breaking my heart for the inconstant creature .
Scrooge did as he was told , and held it fast .
There is no doubt about it .
It is mostly in shadow .
<NAME> applied her handkerchief to her eyes .
The service is pretty well advanced before <NAME> can discern <NAME> .
Peggotty ! ’ cried <NAME> , opening the parlour door .
He knowed <NAME> , he said , well .
No one waits at home for me .
Is it a gentleman ? ’ said <NAME> .
She crouches on the parapet outside for hours and hours .
‘ I should think you could !
It ’ s pretty nigh the time to wait upon the old woman .
‘ I hope it may prove so .
inquired <NAME> , taking up a pocket-pistol which lay on the table .
But at this instant a most remarkable phenomenon occurred .
‘ What is it to me , sir ?
And we all had cake and wine on gold plates .
The idea of his managing hundreds !
I repress myself and force myself to act a part .
This is not your proper occupation .
‘ He wouldn ’ t look at me , ’ replied the boy .
‘ Many , many , many , happy returns , ’ said the <NAME> .

<NAME> back to our Department , and <NAME> into me .
inquired <NAME> and <NAME> , together .
`` No , my dear <NAME> ; no . ''
'But wo n't you take one look at him , first , miss ? '
As the punch disappeared , <NAME> became still more friendly and convivial .
He was fallen , never to be raised up any more .
A prisoner having declared upon the poor side , pays neither rent nor chummage .
‘ He is one of the <NAME> .
It was whispering and babbling .
_I_ don ’ t think you ’ d go on with it .
I have not suffered quite in vain .
I told her she was tired , and I was sorry .
'Who are you that 's not to be told ?
“ It is <NAME> , ” said madame .
He whistled on the dog , and walked rapidly away .
I learned in a moment that he loved me .
She hoped <NAME> might like it , but really she didn ’ t know .
Also referred to Patience on Monument .
‘ I should have expected it of you .
Was it likely I should be talking of his attention to anybody else ?
If I could hunt her to her grave , I would .
I ’ m proud to see you .
<NAME> is sorry to say that he is not prepared with the money .
‘ <NAME> ’ s out , and his boat ’ s out .
‘ Well , I say , <NAME> ! ’ he proceeded .
I thought it was sluggish in its course , and cool , quite cool .
The morning luminary is built out , and don ’ t shine there .
You are right , '' says <NAME> .
The object is a good one , and that must be our excuse .
Might she not look for her old Esther and not find her ?
‘ Good-night. ’ ‘ No , but <NAME> -- ’ said <NAME> .
A singular circumstance then arose in the case .
<NAME> , poor little doll ’ s dressmaker !
Mrs. <NAME> was in good spirits , and inclined to be conversational .
M ‘ Kane immediately fled _and at the latest dates had not been taken_ .
I will write anything , here and now , that you will dictate .
<NAME> walked with them to the lodge gate , and took a dutiful leave .
But <NAME> know , <NAME> bless you !
`` An amiable bull who is determined to make every colour scarlet ! ''
But should she ask <NAME> ?
‘ Then go straight up there , will you ? ’ said <NAME> .
Which we came and saw .
<NAME> ; there 's more to tell .
<NAME> <NAME> , <NAME> , think again .
I go on duty soon , and ca n't overstay my time .
To these good people <NAME> was presented with much formality .
`` I hope I have not driven her away ? ''
She looked up in his face once more .
‘ What does he say , what does he say ?
He is a poor man , and they are not paid for .
`` How are you , my Lord Chancellor .
‘ But I never heard such odd noises .
‘ Whose question is ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , ’ said Mr Meagles .
I ’ d not believe it , if you told me so .
And how are you , sir ( to <NAME> ) ?
And she said , the poor burying ground .
'This is him , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> ; 'my friend <NAME> . '
A person like myself had better not aspire .
If I win , I get ‘ em .
“ Why , we are not going fishing ! ” said I .
‘ Grummer , you will bring these persons before me , this afternoon .
`` <NAME> may gain , out of this , the quality he wants .
Your relative depends upon you .
All as they should be .
When am I to make a bid ?
‘ Going away , <NAME> ? ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> makes the latter remark to himself as he nods to <NAME> .
Through having met with an accident .
‘ The trousers pockets empty , and turned inside out. ’ <NAME> nodded .
The bell rang gently as he spoke .
Never ! ’ ‘ No , I am sure you won ’ t .
‘ Now , what are you waiting for ?
‘ But so-so , <NAME> , ’ returned the Instrument-maker .
`` No one had attended on him .
‘ What ’ s your name , fellow ? ’ thundered <NAME> .
‘ I believe so , ’ said Mr Carker , showing all his teeth .
The collector fell back in his chair in the intensity of his astonishment .
‘ No , no , ’ returned Mr Meagles .
She might feel a little wounded , but her care was not for herself .
My birthday was the most melancholy day at home in the whole year .
‘ What ’ s the matter , <NAME> ? ’ said <NAME> .
`` And what do YOU say , '' <NAME> inquires , referring to it .
‘ What could the baron do ?
‘ A son of two or three-and-twenty .
<NAME> affects Mrs. Rouncewell little .
‘ More , the day after to-morrow .
<NAME> make room , to let <NAME> Fitz-Marshall pass .
Now , this is not promising .
cried Fagin , holding up is hands .
She is the prettiest and most engaging little fairy in the world .
said Mrs. Maylie , laying her hand on <NAME> 's head .
‘ Straight and swift I ran , and no one dared to stop me .
He 's going to ask your pals , too .
It is a little hard upon us , but it is the truth .
The child sat by , and watched its progress with a troubled mind .
He come out first ; I come out last .
“ What is easier , you know ? ” assented <NAME> .
`` Now , '' she adds , `` show me the spot again ! ''
he asked me as his eyes met mine .
How very good he is !
‘ What I have been thinking of , this month back !
I call him my <NAME> !
And HE wanting to marry <NAME> too !
he is your servant , is he ? ’ said <NAME> .
GOD bless you , <NAME> reward you !
‘ No , I thought not ! ’ said <NAME> .
`` And was it there , my dear -- '' I began .
`` This is a place to make a man 's head ache too ! ''
The moment I could land , I came back to you .
It 's about nothing but costs now .
My mother was <NAME> by blood , <NAME> by birth .
'In the workhouse of this town , ' was the sullen reply .
There are the inspired beggars , too .
What is he , after all , they would say ?
3 , which rolls back upon No .
He is a barbarian and a hypocrite , <NAME> .
<NAME> at that handkerchief , sir , <NAME> 's .
`` My dear Jarndyce , '' he returned , `` you surprise me .
But <NAME> might as well have glanced at the face of a clock .
The climate , as I have already intimated , is somewhat of the warmest .
How do you dare to act like this ?
‘ I leave all that ‘ ere to you .
You think it IS worth YOUR while , and IS important to YOUR position .
‘ You shall be taken there , and be publicly seen .
But it was pure , earnest , joyful reality .
You ’ ve not been intimate with <NAME> , I think , <NAME> ?
The guard , the coachman , and the two other passengers eyed him distrustfully .
I should think it was t'othered myself .
‘ I have not a doubt that ’ s best .
You are another self to me .
<NAME> your appetites , my dears , and you ’ ve conquered human natur .
This , however , is forbidden ground .
Of course she would , ’ said <NAME> approvingly .
She will still grow old .
returned <NAME> with his bright smile .
In the meanwhile , be silent ! ” <NAME> acclamations were again raised .
<NAME> <NAME> reiterated his former determination .
I had seen the harvest , but had never thought of the seed .
He gave him his hand , and <NAME> gently pressed it .
The crow flies straight across <NAME> and <NAME> 's <NAME> into <NAME> 's <NAME> .
‘ Here we are at last .
Let them know that she is expected .
No one thought of it .
The fever was at its height .
There , too , I was again left to wander about as I liked .
`` Please to stop the carriage . ''
They are no ordinary houses , those .
Even to you I can only touch upon it , and no more .
He will never see sixty-five again , nor perhaps sixty-six , nor yet sixty-seven .
Mrs. <NAME> had got company .
‘ Repining is of no use , ma ’ am , ’ said <NAME> .
I must now be guided by circumstances .
<NAME> -- a friend of mine , ’ said <NAME> .
Sights of extra strength with the chill on .
‘ I could not take it , if I was starving .
Did you treat anybody , sir ?
He was asked if he remembered this , or that .
`` Not coming , '' said Mrs. Cratchit .
‘ Had she got to be old ? ’ <NAME> asked .
No bell or book for me !
And he offered his hand .
These are mounted and ready to start on the highway to affluence .
My right arm was tolerably restored ; disfigured , but fairly serviceable .
asks <NAME> , anxiously biting his thumb-nail .
I sits me down and says it .
“ Shall I go on , sir ? ” Another blank .
were a fortification against sweetness of temper , natural affection , and gentle intercourse .
‘ Ay , ’ replied <NAME> , turning upon him with an angry look .
Her eyes were fixed on mine .
The room was very neat and orderly .
‘ And what brings you here , you jade ?
Another time , I 'll tell you their names .
Give poor invalid honour of your company .
That was your handiwork , <NAME> , I understand . '
“ But at least there was dogs , <NAME> ?
The prospect near at hand was no better .
‘ I—yes , I called it eloquence , ’ said <NAME> .
oh thank God ! ’ ‘ Amen ! ’ returned the Captain hurriedly .
Withers is more a child to me than you are .
‘ <NAME> , ’ she said , in her most coaxing tone .
This circumstance , at least , you know already . '
I sat in the ball-room in the interval , contemplating the apprentices .
Anywhere in <NAME> , I mean .
'That , sir , ' cried <NAME> , pointing out of the carriage window .
He saw the glimmering of a fire upon the old walls , and entered .
What do I myself deserve ! ’ ‘ Better luck , ’ said <NAME> .
Honour me by walking in .
‘ He grows more like <NAME> every day , ’ said <NAME> .
' I will wait until to-morrow . '
It never will be more .
<NAME> potentate replies in effect , 'This is a sensible fellow .
Then I told her all our story -- ours -- yours and mine .
<NAME> touched her cheek gently with his finger -- and it was a tear !
Certainly none until afterwards when I held the clue .
‘ It warn ’ t him , ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> tried to do honour to the meal , but unavailingly .
They are in danger of denunciation by <NAME> .
<NAME> _he_ think of his neighbour too ?
O pity us , kind Heaven , and help us !
Was he struck by lightning ?
“ Astonishing ! ” said <NAME> , when I had finished .
You may have a sister ; make much of her .
I HAVE carried it out ; I do carry it out .
<NAME> and blood can ’ t bear it .
What are my feelings when I see her pining !
And then they took a last cup of tea in the lonely house .
He appeared before the dolls ’ dressmaker , sitting alone at her work .
‘ You answer each of them .
And as he thought it , felt ashamed of himself . )
They walked arm-in-arm , showily enough , but without appearing to interchange a syllable .
‘ But I am growing too serious !
`` To be sure she did !
Was you never on the mill ? '
`` Dear <NAME> , when you are strong enough , '' returned my guardian .
Yet hitherto our star has been a vacillating and wavering star ?
Another silence succeeded this short dialogue : which was again broken by the stranger .
'Did your worship speak to me ? '
‘ <NAME> ’ t you ! ’ retorted <NAME> , with a diabolical look .
Where shall we meet ? ’ They both started .
“ Pretty well ? ” <NAME> repeated .
<NAME> took it up , and there was a folded paper in it .
You know the dream as well as I do .
It has long been mine , and must remain mine. ’ ‘ Agnes !
It was very handsomely furnished .
`` See here , I have brought a little brooch along with me .
There were people there -- men and women -- light , bustle .
What I said had nothing to do with you .
He is touched , is <NAME> !
To which <NAME> retorts , `` Yes , indeed ! ''
No fight could have been half so terrible as this dance .
<NAME> gall <NAME> ! ’ She gently shook her sleeve to arouse her attention .
I , <NAME> , and so do I , <NAME> .
`` That would be very foolish . ''
With which remark he finishes his brief attendance and returns to finish his dinner .
`` Now , come hither , '' says the housekeeper .
<NAME> <NAME> ’ s brother had said he admired <NAME> .
But we ’ re out of sorts for want of a smoke .
“ ' I am a doctor , my poor fellow , ' said I .
Why should I dread your doing your worst to all about you ?
I am not to mention the suit .
Never mind five pounds -- what ’ s five pounds ?
but it is all of no use .
'You mus n't say you saw me , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
‘ I hope you ’ ve had a pleasant ride , sir .
You need n't be distressed no more .
‘ <NAME> , old chap ! ’ said Mr Pancks .
It was a cold and dismal scene .
I ask because I always want to be informed , when I am ignorant .
I will call there now .
' I have walked a long way .
Whatever the subject of the conversation , he keeps a tender eye upon him .
‘ That ’ s wot my sentiments is .
I am so dreadfully frightened .
I will never do it ! '
She hangs her garden-hat on her arm , and goes out .
'Must go before the magistrate now , sir , ' replied the man .
<NAME> <NAME> had been knocked , head first , down the ladder .
He walked on tiptoe across the moist gravel , and tapped at the door .
The Collegians were not envious .
No implicated man or woman took untimely courage , or made a self-betraying step .
Let us talk about something else . ''
The latter gentleman was obliging enough to direct general attention towards her .
Go on , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , with a sigh .
`` Did she die at ninety , guv'ner ? ''
Where did he come from ?
Now , was there some one in the hopeless unattainable distance ?
I had previously been presented by my aunt , and had been courteously received .
‘ Ay , ay ; I know that , ’ rejoined <NAME> .
Politeness and little gallantries are inseparable from my character .
I have a business charge to acquit myself of .
Private feeling must yield to the common cause .
‘ I must speak to her .
I felt so yesterday at about this same time , miss .
`` To be sure , '' said my guardian .
<NAME> <NAME> will do me the honour of taking some wine ?
‘ Do not press it now , I beg and pray you .
And there <NAME> always was , upon it .
You are turning crazy , I think .
I hope <NAME> is as well as his friends could wish him ? ''
She was quite a child when he went away , then .
Look at your clothes ; better ai n't to be got !
‘ We call it tobacco. ’ ‘ Honoured sir , I thank you .
cried a sleepy-faced carpenter , casting an approving look at the garret-window .
‘ Yes , <NAME> , ’ was the reply through the same channel .
`` <NAME> of <NAME> is not married ? ''
‘ Not for this mischance , ’ replied <NAME> .
I had known him up in <NAME> yonder .
`` My instructions are that you are to move on .
There are three clean wineglasses in a tray on the table .
`` How do you do , all of you ?
<NAME> ’ s further Progress , <NAME> , and Character 9 .
As one of the dogs celebrated everywhere , <NAME> ’ amselle would observe .
It came on briskly , and came up to the front of the chateau .
As the lark rose higher , he sank deeper in thought .
`` I am listening to everything you say . ''
returned the trooper in his off-hand manner .
I have nothing to ask you , nothing in the world . ''
‘ It is powerful , <NAME> , ’ said Mr Dombey .
I said I had been down to hear the <NAME> .
Never mind the sister , ’ remarked <NAME> , a little impatiently .
<NAME> <NAME> did the same .
‘ I should like it very much .
‘ To the page , ’ sobbed <NAME> .
Perhaps it is a grammar , perhaps a history , or geography .
No , <NAME> , I won ’ t .
But no softness or humility ensued on that .
Think what a lot of our forms you have gone through .
Again and again he listened ; again and again the same wearisome blank .
Then I shall release my birds , you know , and confer estates . ''
‘ The heart of this fair girl bounded with joy and gladness .
‘ A very good name for the <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
It is not a phantom of his imagination .
I dare say , ’ rejoined <NAME> .
She can ask , and he can answer , nothing connected for a time .
The coachman ought to be put to death ! ''
You will excuse me , gentlemen ; I was imprudent .
<NAME> ’ cated at no end of expense .
And so he had come home .
<NAME> was pig ’ s whole mass of blood so turned .
How the impertinences , ignorances , and insults went through the multiplication table .
said the child , brimful of glee .
`` Understand me , my dear girl .
They have been very quiet as yet , because they mean to surprise you .
'And <NAME> has been gone upwards of an hour , has he ? '
And you must not be surprised .
You have studied <NAME> ’ s character , and you understand it .
A yellow overhanging plaster-fronted house at which he stopped was quiet too .
She thanked me , and said I was a good fellow .
`` I hope it may prove so .
‘ Sometimes I have risen superior to my difficulties .
His watchfulness of my guardian was incessant .
‘ Is <NAME> within ? ’ I said .
`` Hear me , my love , but do not speak .
They followed paths and tracks , however slight .
They seemed to gag and bind him .
<NAME> mounted her gloomy throne upon the <NAME> ’ s brow in consequence .
Now , do understand that I am entirely at your service .
It ’ s all right. ’ ‘ Well ? ’ said <NAME> eagerly .
Here 's my friend <NAME> , and here am I .
asked <NAME> , looking doubtfully at him .
<NAME> <NAME> is gone for an airing .
We were once slightly acquainted .
I have , I have , ’ <NAME> admitted .
He fortified himself with a little more sherry .
‘ It ’ s gone ! ’ he returned , looking over his shoulder .
I will go to his room and ascertain how he is .
But there was no help for it .
But this was when his mind was in its most distracted state .
But I see what you are driving at .
I went one afternoon when you left me alone .
I know I do ! ’ she sobbed .
Once again , an unaccountable expedition this !
The stars are shining as they shone above the turret-leads at <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> has been a-winking , has he ?
I ’ ll leave it all to her .
‘ And why do you sometimes look so strangely on me , dear <NAME> ?
Of course he could have come to our house .
Mr Wegg , I love her .
Next day we went to <NAME> .
But hope was strong in her breast .
The ladies go up stairs .
<NAME> Tippins with a skittish little scream , attracts the general attention .
' I tell you I do ! '
What more can I do ?
‘ This here ’ s <NAME> , your Wash-up , ’ said <NAME> .
'Take his other hand , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
‘ Let me see , ’ said the good lady .
But there was greater game than this .
He always played the tune .
<NAME> <NAME> smiled , and shook his head .
Was it that as frightened you , love ? '
You and your wife both .
She took her home , ’ said <NAME> , covering his face .
Just the same ! ’ ‘ Indeed ! ’ said <NAME> .
`` I want to set you more right yet .
I have come from <NAME> , ' replied the girl .
I see it in your faces .
`` I 'm surprised at the indiscreetness you commit .
I never see any difference in boys .
He had displayed the one , and vindicated the other .
I am sorry you have been inconvenienced .
This however is not interesting to you .
Why , of course it ’ s not .
It is duly executed and attested .
But what did <NAME> care !
‘ Is this the room ? ’ murmured the little gentleman .
We must break it to them cautiously , but they must be informed directly .
This dinner today closes <NAME> .
<NAME> ’ at in the pooder-plot wa ’ ?
‘ Or drunk , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Hearty , <NAME> ’ am , thank ’ ee , ’ replied <NAME> .
‘ You are not gone mad , after all , <NAME> , I hope ?
I was roused by the silent presence of my aunt at my bedside .
He had only one night more to live .
I forget these chains of association in the interest I have .
They have no need to trouble themselves to send .
It is considerate and right to avoid doing so .
‘ You talk very easily of hours , sir !
When have you found me unmindful of your lessons ?
`` Have they no refuge or resource ? ''
exclaimed the other , collaring him , without a moment 's reflection .
'Now , just a leetle drop , ' said Mrs. Mann persuasively .
said <NAME> , raising his eyes beseechingly .
First and foremost , are you <NAME> and Co. , or are you either ?
The Chancery prisoner ! ’ exclaimed <NAME> .
`` And when <NAME> 's tired , he puts her to bed .
Is not this to be rich ?
‘ To-morrow night will be too late .
The prohibition does not extend to us , does it ? ''
‘ Leave the house , for <NAME> ’ s sake !
‘ Let me see , ’ said the manager cogitating after dinner .
`` Hortense is not one of that sort .
She reappeared with them directly .
who so smooth and silky as <NAME> at first !
`` Who 's that at my door ?
None that I could readily understand ! ''
‘ See these ! ’ she said , contemptuously .
'Why , the sight of you , <NAME> , would cure the hoptalmy ! '
There was something in its touch that gave <NAME> a check .
‘ How are you getting on ? ’ ‘ Very well , <NAME> .
R. W. , this is the gentleman who has taken your first-floor .
‘ In the cause of the right it would .
‘ <NAME> , ain ’ t he ? ’ said the <NAME> .
I was considered tall ; perhaps I was .
There is nothing adulatory in <NAME> , <NAME> .
Well enough pleased , excessively enchanted , and with all their hearts ravished .
You couldn ’ t get at it without shutting the door first .
From the shining heights she has scaled and taken , she is never absent .
Have you sold no friend ?
<NAME> brightened at the name .
That <NAME> supported her on his arm .
No stranger to your worship .
I demand of <NAME> , will he not come to deliver me ?
‘ Never mind , ’ said <NAME> , after a short pause .
<NAME> ’ t I love you now , <NAME> ?
‘ I am sick of my life , <NAME> .
Dear me , they are inexpensive , but they are quite wonderful !
They had always been estranged .
You never said anything about danger .
But there was small cleverness in HIS keeping out of the way .
The face of <NAME> 's boy !
<NAME> <NAME> proposed <NAME> ; <NAME> proposed <NAME> .
‘ Really I don ’ t know about that , ’ observed Traddles thoughtfully .
Policeman seen to smile to potboy .
Then , in a rush , it cruelly taunts him .
That ’ s what I told you just now .
‘ All scout it as a fable .
She kept her hair short and crisp , and wore spectacles .
Her account was stated on the wall in the same manner .
‘ I hold a trust here , <NAME> , under <NAME> .
‘ Or two hours ? ’ inquired the post -- boy on the wheeler .
He knew it was the mark of tears as well as I .
He never has what you would call a regular breakfast .
A river 's its natural depth , and he 's his natural depth .
You have never heard any name but <NAME> .
‘ A sweet lady , <NAME> ! ’ said <NAME> .
“ What is the matter ? ” asked <NAME> .
Out with the truth ! ’ ‘ Charley ! ’ said his sister .
‘ My dear aunt ! ’ cried I .
They were happy days , those of <NAME> 's recovery .
He pressed the work-worn , hunger-worn young fingers , and touched his lips .
What is threatened ? ’ ‘ I don ’ t know .
`` Thank you , <NAME> , '' says <NAME> .
' I never see such a hardened little wretch ! '
The dark blot on the street is gone .
‘ Then it ’ s all true and they really do !
You are a pretty fellow to object and advise ! ” exclaimed <NAME> .
I 'll give you punch , and not bad punch .
I have seen her married to a man who knew nothing of my fate .
I know not what to liken it to .
‘ Why ! ’ returned the disconcerted old lady .
My health , severely impaired when I left <NAME> , was quite restored .
Mrs. Wititterly is of a most excitable nature , <NAME> .
( “ This is the way to have him !
‘ Now , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
`` Principally rags and rubbish , my dear friend !
<NAME> <NAME> is a very gentlemanly man indeed -- very gentlemanly . ''
And our dear <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> , ’ said the old gentleman , taking the gun .
‘ I believe you , ’ rejoined <NAME> .
‘ But she ’ s very frugal , and she ’ s very deaf .
Perhaps you brought a canary-bird ? ’ <NAME> smiled and shook her head .
And so earnest a character must be very earnest in that passion .
‘ How old are you , <NAME> ? ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> then , if you please .
“ And here he wrote ' a poor physician . '
`` He was all but married once .
‘ You would sleep the better , ’ replied <NAME> .
interposed Mrs. Mann , inflaming her left eye with the corner of her apron .
Oh , my lungs , get out of the shop !
I told her I should die without her .
<NAME> was a charity-boy , but not a workhouse orphan .
said <NAME> , `` show me no more !
But what is a difference in age of half-a-dozen years or so ?
Her blood seemed to run cold .
`` He might have undertaken to do it and not done it .
‘ I am glad of it .
‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> again , as if with a desperate effort .
What he is now , you see .
I think I have not .
‘ No , <NAME> , I can not forget it .
<NAME> <NAME> thought of the widow at <NAME> , and his mind was troubled .
The prisoner obeyed , and a guard of two armed patriots attended them .
I am sure it must be when I see these things .
There ’ s law to be had , there ’ s law .
Softly and slowly , he opened the coat and drew it back .
says <NAME> to a smarting client .
‘ How brisk we are ! ’ said <NAME> .
I can not admit that I implied anything . ''
I began to lose the identity of the sleeper resting on me .
`` Certainly an advantage , '' returned my guardian .
‘ Well , it don ’ t much matter .
I have made him my executor .
'However , you have found me out , ' you says just now .
‘ Do it. ’ So pale , so trembling , so impassioned !
I am always willing to defer to your good sense .
I went down again next morning to see that they were away .
Oliver , put on your cap , and come with me . '
It was your Ladyship 's beauty . ''
As to the first letter of that lawyer 's name now .
I know ’ em all pretty well .
‘ So I am told , ’ was the answer .
‘ This is very strange , ’ said <NAME> .
I was well behind my table and not much frightened .
Do not seem to have been tampering with anybody .
Is that the common cause I make with you ?
I never saw such a fellow .
Many of those pigs live here .
However , this is not <NAME> talk .
‘ There ’ s the bell , ’ said <NAME> .
But I -- Oh , I am well enough , ’ said Mr Merdle .
To call me his standing counsel and his banker would be nearer the fact .
the old man gives him both his hands .
<NAME> gracious , what is the man ? ''
There must be no trifling with <NAME> affections , poor dear .
`` Why , no , my dear , '' he replied .
I had the honour of knowing him there .
Now , sir , we entered into a bond of confidence .
A little teasing , a little humbling , a few tears .
You must get hold of him somehow . '
He felt that it could not be done .
What did I do to her ?
I am excellent friends with you .
' I shall find you out , some day , my friend . '
' I tell you he is , ' retorted the old gentleman .
'How came that dog here ? '
<NAME> <NAME> ’ s pipe fell from his hands .
<NAME> , come , <NAME> , put a brighter face upon it ! ''
I wish you good night . ''
It has its pictures too .
<NAME> off gentleman 's boots in <NAME> .
I shall soon get in the way of it , <NAME> .
`` No , my love , '' said I .
With the same grey cloak .
He knows me , and I know him .
‘ What now ? ’ she said again , impatiently .
Picking up his hat , he looked towards the door .
‘ Dear me ! ’ replied the Doctor .
Now I see why them men yonder held aloof from me .
‘ My own ! ’ said <NAME> , with infinite compassion .
As quiet as a monastery , and almost as roomy .
‘ Why , that , ’ replied the pretty housemaid .
Then the other man came up .
Oh I know she ’ s going to bring him to me !
The senior partner took the coach , and the junior partner took his walking-stick .
The guilty man , brought to justice , would poison her name .
<NAME> ; ’ introducing the monument of that devoted wife .
There was a fitness of things in the whole that carried conviction with it .
<NAME> <NAME> took them systematically .
The waiter appeared to be particularly affected .
You ought not hastily to do that .
I hand the first book to my mother .
<NAME> <NAME> , struggle for your life .
<NAME> <NAME> draws his chair a little forward and seats himself again .
She is daughter of a widow in the village .
‘ That ’ s my way , ’ repeated <NAME> .
‘ So I ’ m a going to , <NAME> .
He was at home now , and suffered himself to consider it .
`` Yes , you , '' he said , turning round .
How do you like her , my dear ? ''
Now , make me one promise .
<NAME> Linkinwater is excited , but he is justly excited , properly excited .
I shall be a body .
‘ Who ’ d have thought it , from the looks on it !
“ This is Mam'selle ! ” said he .
To <NAME> , the bankruptcy was quite a calamity .
How is he to be saved from justice ?
exclaims <NAME> , striking his hand upon the table .
“ Good stuff , eh , sergeant ? ” said <NAME> .
`` Do n't be ruffled by your occupation .
It had been written in portions , at different times .
And Fitz-Jarndyce lays the money out for me to great advantage .
Mrs General had no opinions .
My story shall have some reference to it .
I controlled my generous indignation , and said so .
Evermore I will see thee there .
You will not be discomposed by the <NAME> , I dare say ? ''
'He stands committed for three months -- hard labour of course .
Having availed herself of it , she resumed her toast and her discourse together .
<NAME> ’ t say so ! ’ returned <NAME> .
We begin to close in upon 'em about dusk .
<NAME> was an undersized footman , with a long body and short legs .
Do n't hurry yourself on my account . ''
You must tell me all about it , <NAME> dear , immediately .
‘ Is she quite recovered ? ’ said <NAME> , impetuously .
‘ A little hand indeed , ’ said the poor schoolmaster .
I never want the two to clash if I can help it .
You do n't blame me , I hope , <NAME> ?
'It 's very likely it _will_ be troublesome .
My idea , my dear Sir , entirely .
`` You are truly kind , '' I answered .
Then , and after that , I took it .
<NAME> reminds me of <NAME> .
My husband would conduct him up-stairs .
He won ’ t be lost if he does land , ’ said <NAME> .
With the usual exception , ma ’ am , ’ repeated <NAME> .
A very good profession , <NAME> , a very good profession . ''
‘ <NAME> and <NAME> , you both take sugar , I know .
‘ It matters very little ! ’ said <NAME> , with a faint smile .
<NAME> laughingly believed he had been thinking of <NAME> .
`` Because -- '' said I with a little hesitation .
‘ Who is with you , <NAME> ? ’ said the judge .
‘ Thank you , ma ’ am ; that ’ s well .
<NAME> term lately over , and the <NAME> Chancellor sitting in <NAME> 's <NAME> .
The visitor gradually broke into a smile , and sat down again .
‘ Let them know my humour , ’ said the single gentleman , rising .
‘ <NAME> woman , look here , ’ exclaimed the husband .
There is no merit in being that , ’ said <NAME> .
She gave him her hand .
“ Take a chair , <NAME> , ” said my guardian .
‘ Mr <NAME> , ’ he repeated .
Nor can I tell you what I would .
I see you 'd been a reading of 'em when I come in .
Now , will you take a little drop of somethink , Mr .
For , suppose he were apprehended , we have no proof against him .
'Bless us , and save us !
Mrs. Grayper ’ s going to have a lot of company. ’ Oh !
But this is a very remarkable document , <NAME> , '' said <NAME> .
'Crape , keys , centre-bits , darkies -- nothing forgotten ? '
There is a noise of tongues , and tread of feet , inside .
'And what the devil 's a put-up thing ? '
He slightly inclines and advances his head as not quite understanding the question .
I was -- ha -- universally acknowledged as the head of the place .
<NAME> condescension on our brother ’ s part !
'You will tell her I am here ? '
I forget what you were accused of ? ” “ Plots .
She can do justice to it , <NAME> .
`` <NAME> , '' he repeated , and looked at me again .
‘ Oh , it was nobody , ’ replied <NAME> .
He has decayed in his prison : I in mine .
“ His what ? ” demanded <NAME> , quite savagely .
I think I ought to do it , poor man .
'Wide , ' replied <NAME> , after peeping in to satisfy himself .
And the glasses were set down empty .
There is not a secret place in the whole house .
‘ Why , he ’ s going up it ! ’ said <NAME> .
said <NAME> , bending over the bashful beauty .
<NAME> , ’ said <NAME> ; ‘ this way , if you please .
<NAME> is ready to receive her father and her new Mama .
‘ Benighted man ! ’ said the <NAME> <NAME> .
Do n't you tell no more of 'em , <NAME> .
said <NAME> , calling to our post-boy .
What do we want more to touch us ?
I was afraid I might not be able to support so great a change .
A deal too stout , my dear ! '
But her influence was so quiet that I know no more .
These fellows are coming from the wilderness , are they ?
`` And so have I , '' exclaimed another .
Mr Clennam , you and I made a bargain .
Mrs <NAME> was an excellent but rather venomous old lady of three-score .
The wine was passed , and a fresh supply ordered .
My constitution will be giving way next .
Perhaps I may be , perhaps I may be .
“ But what did I know ?
I thanked him , and apologized .
To bring her to this declaration .
A dozen voices , until now unheard , called aloud to part them .
‘ I have nothing more to say , ’ replied that lady modestly .
But there was a curious noise inside .
Who can anything about him concern more than me ?
Wotever I done is worked out and paid for , ” he insisted again .
“ You made a vow , ” said she .
You and your suspicions of my suspicions of him !
The public-houses , with gas-lights burning inside , were already open .
The passengers were all dressed so oddly too !
‘ What is the matter , mother ? ’ ‘ Matter !
But she did what they all do -- took a husband .
He looks at <NAME> the moment he comes in .
I left him there with <NAME> .
'There , there , ' said the Jew , coaxingly .
‘ Bless me , cook , I forgot you , ’ said <NAME> .
After a few minutes , <NAME> rang his bell .
Call the waiters , ’ said the old gentleman .
<NAME> , my darling , hear me out .
The visitors stopped a long time .
I ought to know it .
`` <NAME> and <NAME> 's , <NAME> .
My dear , how you are trembling ! ''
I should like to know whether she left this herself .
I was pained to find him taking this tone , and he observed it .
In such a case as yours , the object is a fitting establishment .
‘ Oh my eye ! ’ cried <NAME> .
It was a Sunday evening in <NAME> , gloomy , close , and stale .
‘ Speak louder. ’ ‘ Miss Rachael , ’ roared the fat boy .
'Come , I know you ; it wo n't do .
We stopped in a high-street where there was a coach-stand .
He was also hotter than at first , and breathed harder .
They remanded him till to-day , for they thought they knew the owner .
It was a slip of mine .
That you should have met her in the country !
The bowls never wanted washing .
This was the first time he had taken his leg from the chair .
`` This is a lovely place , '' said <NAME> , looking round .
‘ What a wonderful thing for me that I am here !
He had not much hair .
The boy was off like a shot .
`` And that 's the lad , sir , is it ? ''
I Am Shown Two Interesting Penitents <NAME> .
'Come in , ' said the old lady ; and in walked <NAME> .
'What 's it worth to you ? '
You are mellowing -- losing body and colour already .
Will you give me a light ?
It ’ s no satisfaction to be done by two men instead of one .
The four members of <NAME> looked at one another , and paused .
My <NAME> 's out , ai n't she ? ''
The child made a hasty sign to them with his hand .
She spared me the trouble of considering , by dismissing me .
It becomes a clear case that they must all go .
‘ Thought to be , ’ said <NAME> .
How could I ever have know happiness again ! '
I never did ‘ aggle and I never will ‘ aggle .
`` <NAME> and devil by turns , eh ? ''
'But , I say , she 'll be back if yer lose time . '
Everybody had gone , and the house door was closed for the night .
Over the sofa , Mrs. <NAME> when Mrs. Dingo .
I warmed the ale and made the toast on the usual infallible principles .
<NAME> up the dear old lady to help ; knock her up .
`` He will never do violence to the sunshine any more . ''
But it was not to be done .
There ’ s an <NAME> family with a charming <NAME> motto .
`` Name of any collateral or remote branch of your ladyship 's family ? ''
‘ Well , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , for self and partner .
In short I will have it .
<NAME> <NAME> , I love your daughter fondly , dearly , disinterestedly , devotedly .
‘ Is it , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Certainly not , ’ replied <NAME> .
Let us have no false delicacy .
( To the stout gentleman in the rocking-chair . )
I haven ’ t meant any offence .
I generally go to bed late. ’ ‘ Thank you , <NAME> !
Then a short gallop ; it was all one to the boy .
A man of business had a small property in trust for me .
It certainly looked as if he had hung out a little too long .
Hey ? ’ said <NAME> , pinching my ear with ferocious playfulness .
‘ What dog is that ? ’ said Mr Dombey , displeased .
We all looked awkwardly at the tablecloth while this was going on .
T'other one 's was one syllable .
`` We are to meet as usual ? ''
‘ Mr Carker , ’ he said , addressing himself to the Manager .
But , after you have gone home , do n't go back here .
‘ One thousand guineas to the little beauty you slowly hunted to death .
sneered Mrs. Bumble , with ineffable contempt .
You 'll get your living without it , and put more to it .
Still , the <NAME> of people did not present themselves .
He was very timid of his father .
can you suppose that any one so wrapped up in another—Mrs .
‘ And what ’ s that ? ’ asked the manager .
She is a very good girl , <NAME> .
Your nephew is a noble lad , sir , an honest , noble lad .
It is the same with all these new countries and wonderful sights .
‘ Needs must , you know , when somebody drives .
‘ That ’ s a clincher , ’ said <NAME> , aside .
My <NAME> is the son , of course .
`` Strike home , '' murmured <NAME> .
What a change you have made in yourself !
He had not found himself more favoured by fortune there than here .
A wicked rascal , <NAME> , but droll !
How much of the future might arise before _her_ vision ?
`` I know quite enough about it , '' returns <NAME> .
I didn ’ t mince the matter with him .
All these discoveries were now related to <NAME> , circumstantially , and in detail .
‘ It is no matter at all , ’ said <NAME> .
said <NAME> clapping his hand upon his pocket .
Take me to Mr Witherden ’ s first. ’ <NAME> shook his head irresolutely .
I stay here of course .
‘ Oh , sir ? ’ said Mrs. Sparsit .
Yet the portrait was to see it all out .
Her arm trembled very much .
`` It is quite a story for twilight .
<NAME> were days of wholesome repression , punishment , and fear .
And yet it sounds like him. ’ A ring at the yard bell .
‘ Certainly not ! ’ shouted <NAME> .
inquired the unsentimental <NAME> .
I can at least guarantee that the river shall not suffer from his visit .
He is an impetuous youth .
Little <NAME> ! ’ ‘ Little Kate Nickleby , ’ cried the other three .
I gave him those directions , '' says my Lady .
' I wish to go back , ' said the girl .
‘ I will be your faithful hard-working servant , I will , indeed .
'Bring them bits of timber , <NAME> .
Raising the same face to his , as on that miserable night .
I suppose it was , for he went away . ''
The touch was still upon his arm .
“ I am weary , weary , weary -- worn down by misery .
If he takes me anywhere , I must go .
I suppose he never has written !
That 's about where it lights ; here we are !
Do you know that he loves YOU , yet ? ''
He will mind what _I_ say .
‘ What have YOU got to do with holidays ?
But we DO N'T get on in life .
You see I am not constrained or forced .
said <NAME> , laying his hand on <NAME> 's knee .
But it was all dim and clouded to her now .
‘ I promised my sister I wouldn ’ t. ’ <NAME> hastily confirmed .
“ Yes , you will , ” says they .
'What do you want , then ? '
What could have caused it ?
If ‘ tan ’ t , I ’ ll bide it .
‘ He had better have something to eat , immediately , ’ remarked Emily .
Those whisperings and counsellings , <NAME> , that you have spoken of .
“ Oh , what shall I do , what shall I do ?
'Go on , go on -- yes -- what of it ?
‘ You know that you are lacerating me in the cruellest manner .
‘ Ha ! ’ cried the jealous dwarf , ‘ What ’ s this !
“ You was always in <NAME> 's way since ever you was a child .
That was a foolish question of mine .
But he wrote me a letter .
`` You 're a baron of the land . ''
You take the butcher 's position .
<NAME> , we have not a moment to lose .
<NAME> also meets with new Acquaintances .
“ Doctor Manette at home ? ” Expected home .
‘ He must leave his boat behind him .
And that 's all he does ! ''
‘ By the <NAME> , it ’ s a high quality !
It fell off very much .
“ My business ? ” he repeated , pausing .
I have no means of knowing .
' ” I felt my face fire up as I looked at <NAME> .
‘ He can ’ t be here , ’ thought <NAME> .
It is not to be thought of . ''
My dear , next to myself he is the most constant suitor in court .
Their quick ears caught the sound of an approaching footstep .
<NAME> would not put up to be put down by clamour .
Shall I ring for them to carry you down ? ''
The doors of the rooms within , appeared to be standing open .
You have barely half an hour before dinner .
‘ Very well , ’ replied <NAME> , looking round him .
and a great deal more out of the fullness of her grateful heart .
Her manner was short and abrupt , yet faltering and timid .
‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , <NAME> .
And how do you do , Bella ?
`` By heaven , he is the most astonishing bird in <NAME> ! ''
‘ A strange man ! ’ shrieked the lady .
Contemplation of Mr <NAME> ’ s waistcoat buttons by Mr Merdle .
`` At least you always tell me so . ''
Mrs Miff curtseys and proposes chairs in the vestry .
`` I thought he 'd never die . ''
‘ Pretty well , ’ returned <NAME> with a grin .
He makes ready to secure that object .
Whether or no , I wo n't be prayed agin , I tell you .
Not to speak to her .
<NAME> <NAME> retreats behind a chair .
It was a sweet and happy dream .
‘ Upon my word and honour she is , ’ said Mr Toots .
‘ Oh , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ I see .
They arise , roll up and stow away their mattresses .
Listen now ! ’ His influence upon her was complete .
'He will be taken to-night ! '
`` Take care they do n't spoil you by flattery . ''
He had no heart to beg .
They have got the gift of the gab , they have .
Let them not encounter , through me .
I wish to preserve the good opinion of all here .
His manner to me , alone , would have won her .
Left the <NAME> , '' <NAME> delicately suggests .
<NAME> would thank him , and say she was very well .
Your worship doubts the room behind the door ?
<NAME> <NAME> was very rich and very proud .
You know what a witty , humorous , elegant , accomplished man <NAME> is .
You have been very good to me , and I owe everything to you .
Look after your grandmother , girls ; she has fainted away .
I never could have believed -- ’ ‘ Pardon me , ’ interposed Nicholas .
'It was all Mrs. Bumble .
Until the Day of Judgment .
It wanted a quarter to eight when they reached <NAME> .
Get out of his sight , <NAME> !
It was obviously the weakness of the position .
He went out to his Lock to sum up what he had seen .
I say he was a child of seven year old .
On the contrary , my Lady prefers it .
So , I called myself Pip , and came to be called <NAME> .
I am convinced of it .
<NAME> till I shut the door of the shop .
‘ I owe you a thousand thanks , <NAME> , ten thousand thanks .
‘ I persuaded you to it , Mr Clennam .
Here am I. Didn ’ t you hear me knock ? ’ ‘ Oh !
‘ And I my clothes , ’ said <NAME> .
said the Jew , laying his hand upon it after a short pause .
At last <NAME> came back , looking something the worse for the conference .
‘ Come in , ’ said a female voice .
<NAME> ’ t it a dozen ? ’ said Mr Meagles , addressing <NAME> .
It appears an age , <NAME> .
<NAME> was knitting , and <NAME> was looking on .
Is not that enough for me ?
Are you sure you can do it carefully , my worthy man ? ''
‘ <NAME> ’ t ask me anything , <NAME> .
said my guardian with a passing shade of vexation on his face .
Two things are especially observable as <NAME> proceeds to a conclusion .
Where is he sitting now—with his face to the light ?
It ’ s freedom , sir , it ’ s freedom !
“ Old Bailey spy , ” returned his informant .
I had at first intended going South—to Charleston .
said <NAME> , surveying <NAME> contemptuously from head to foot .
<NAME> Micawber ’ s answer expressed the disturbance of his mind .
We may look better here .
<NAME> <NAME> , my brother Mr Dombey .
There was dust , I believe .
Still more so , by its contents .
How can I be bribed ? ''
It should be eaten on the instant .
Very likely that was a mistake of mine .
Living or dead , where is she ?
A very strongly-marked countenance for the purpose , sir .
They put him wery nigh the top .
‘ Well ! ’ said <NAME> to himself , as the man approached .
‘ But ’ t an ’ t sommuch for that as I stands out .
There is change enough for twenty in me .
It has been already stated that <NAME> , not being philosophical , wept .
‘ Page a hundred and nine , Mr Boffin .
She can not mean young Gay , I think .
`` -- if I WILL go to dinner ! ''
' I 'm doubtful about it , ' replied <NAME> , with a sigh .
It was gold , I tell you !
Our relations were business relations , but confidential .
‘ I am proud of her .
‘ I can do it without assistance .
“ We come next , to mere details of arrangement .
What reason have you to be merry ?
As if , being turned out of that mould , it must be sharp .
He says it with a groan that wrings her heart .
I can sketch it and alter it .
I can ’ t contain myself when I look at him .
Sometimes I would meet him in the neighbourhood lounging about and biting his nails .
There was two in the coffee-pot at breakfast time .
‘ I thought it might be .
'You 're a lie , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
Mrs. Snagsby Sees It All XXVII .
‘ It ’ s of a piece with the rest of your behaviour .
Give the word , and I 'll sell off every morsel .
O the long , long night , with the moans of the poor wife !
So we agree to keep the fact to ourselves .
Is it because we are calculated to walk ?
But be particular to a word . ''
To <NAME> 's Court , therefore , he repairs .
'Do n't turn me out of doors to wander in the streets again .
It has been said that <NAME> was pining in her bower .
<NAME> , eager and sharp , looks out .
I should like to catch her at it !
Some think it must be <NAME> , some say the <NAME> .
<NAME> Voices in the Waves 42 .
<NAME> says nothing , and goes on .
There was no other news in <NAME> ’ s letters .
When he went to it again , <NAME> ’ ly was nigh him .
I like to know people ’ s affairs likewise .
All applications to be made to the committee .
His heart and soul were in the scene , and with his former self .
`` Pray be seated -- here near me .
She knows nothing about ‘ em .
‘ Not all of us , ’ said <NAME> .
Outsiders cultivate Veneering , <NAME> , and <NAME> , W.M.P .
<NAME> Mrs <NAME> raised her eyebrows for instruction from her husband .
‘ I come from <NAME> , ’ I said .
I came to call upon Mr <NAME> myself .
‘ <NAME> shillings a week is not much , ’ said <NAME> , mildly .
Why should I ask it ! ''
I know I may trust you two .
Would they incur a risk in her ?
<NAME> drew nearer to him in the twilight of the room .
‘ If I am grave about it , I am not at all sorrowful .
'It 's dreadful to think of ! '
I shall live here for two years .
<NAME> ’ t you know she has , <NAME> ?
Touching the glass with his cheek , he listened again .
cried <NAME> , looking round .
And there was science to an unlimited extent . ''
‘ Do you think they would come ? ’ ‘ Oh !
<NAME> said <NAME> ’ s work punished him a little .
‘ Why , then Altro to you , old chap .
Under the circumstances , I didn ’ t expect it yet .
It was a glorious supper .
`` Well , you do surprise me !
<NAME> reservations and artful mysteries grew out of these things .
‘ What is it ? ’ inquired <NAME> carelessly .
said the good doctor , patting him on the shoulder .
What a very nice backyard , ma'am !
Tom-all-Alone 's is still asleep , and nothing is astir .
‘ <NAME> , <NAME> may be living .
My Lady is quite well .
exclaims the servant , recoiling from him .
`` I ca n't say anything about him .
‘ You hear what this lady asks .
These stipulations having been concluded , <NAME> locked the door and departed .
You 're not a skater , I suppose ? ''
`` I ask your pardon , sir .
The porter 's seat was vacant .
<NAME> looks about for an apothecary 's shop .
And yet , <NAME> , think how terrible the fascination of money is !
Do you want to be let in ? ''
You 've got a mark upon you somewheres or another , I suppose ? ''
‘ He was the assailant , ’ <NAME> submitted .
I was soon too many for him . '
‘ My dear Sir , ’ urged the little man .
Are you going to keep the gentleman expecting us all day ?
I cried out , rising hastily .
“ He answered with great contempt , 'No . '
“ Do n't say fit for nothing. ” “ What am I fit for ?
I know I am not fit company for our company .
‘ “ <NAME> -- devil ! ” murmured the convict between his set teeth .
'Are you mad enough to leave this house ?
I am as immoral as need be .
‘ That ’ s what I ’ m to do , is it ?
‘ Is that its—his—name ? ’ ‘ Deputy , ’ assents <NAME> .
`` It is not likely to occur again , '' said I , smiling .
<NAME> Smallweed nods and appears greedy to be sworn .
How can the women and the children draw water !
<NAME> has brightened in a moment .
I would spare the feelings of his -- of his sister .
But of course I know you will .
‘ Never be one of those , <NAME> , in anything .
The stranger was young , and the widow was flattered .
‘ I am afraid to kiss her , lest I should make her ill .
‘ I am very unwilling to speak , <NAME> .
-- Never more , oh God forgive you , <NAME> !
The houses are chiefly of wood .
I am quite ashamed of him .
<NAME> , I don ’ t object to anything .
So did <NAME> when he came .
`` I hope he does , '' says <NAME> .
' I knew it all along .
Was she not very much surprised ?
‘ And little he cared ! ’ muttered her daughter , between her teeth .
-- <NAME> 's voice , no doubt about it .
“ Yes. ” “ You saw him , sir ? ” “ Yes .
She was not kneeling now , but was down upon the ground .
“ Speak well of the law .
This immense conversational achievement required time , but was effected .
`` Art in heaven -- is the light a-comin , sir ? ''
I will write to you .
'British <NAME> ' -- there 's a tune to warm an Englishman up !
‘ What does this mean ? ’ ‘ Nothing , my darling , nothing .
'Very much so , indeed , my dear .
‘ Say that hammer of mine ’ s a wall—my work .
<NAME> ’ t abear to make-believe as I meant it !
And I do love a newspaper .
Indeed you may ! ’ ‘ I am sure I may .
After a while he took out his handkerchief and wiped his forehead and hands .
We have no such feeling .
What can I do to serve you ? '
Probably he had that much foreknowledge , knowing his men .
`` I am sure you are .
I saw her haggard , listening face distinctly .
But I have no other reason to complain of her .
returns the other as if he were not over-fond of the subject .
What object ? ’ demanded <NAME> , in a wrathful tone .
All of which is very true , my dear , but is no justification .
Not proud in his wisdom .
If your first teacher ( dear !
Who are to rejoice at nothing and be sorry for nothing .
`` <NAME> was often in here .
But he silenced the distant thunder with the rolling of his sea of pride .
‘ You -- ha -- habitually hurt me. ’ ‘ Hurt you , father !
And what may be the ages of these two , ma'am ?
I beg your pardon , ’ said <NAME> , with humility .
<NAME> was selected to do the same kind office for the hitherto unconquered Podder .
I hope you never may .
“ A Doctor with a daughter .
There 's a obstinate pauper for you ! '
Had her father enjoyed his walk ?
The two discoverers stare at the <NAME> , who return the compliment .
Well , of course ; such people always are .
Do not mind shrinking openly from me , lady .
Besides , the others are all too big . '
<NAME> , show the gentleman the handbill .
`` I thought we had done with him . ''
and Chickweed himself keeps on shouting , all the time , like mad .
<NAME> <NAME> 's children have tumbled up somehow or other .
Happily it was so quick that I had not put my head out .
Oh , who can tell how much she needed help at first !
Not one brass farthing. ’ ‘ Expect ! ’ said <NAME> , haughtily .
We have no choice , you and I , but to obey our instructions .
‘ One of her romantic ideas !
Who ’ s he , to be favoured along of his daughter ?
'Have you anything to say at all ? '
After another absence , he again returned .
Something else to think of .
‘ Delightful ! ’ echoed Messrs. Snodgrass , <NAME> , and <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> .
I could almost have settled down to my fate but for this woman .
‘ -- Hear me out ! ’ said <NAME> .
Of all my books , I like this the best .
What did he die of ? ’ asked my aunt .
There is but one way that I know of .
You appear to me to be the very touchstone of responsibility .
I felt so grateful to <NAME> , and admired her so !
That something , comrade , I discovered to be a small flat oblong cash-box .
Not a word to your loving mother , who was growing older too ? ''
I can hardly hope to be remembered by <NAME> , except by name .
‘ Now , what do you complain of ? ’ asked <NAME> .
`` Well , not quite yet , '' says <NAME> .
I beg you 'll excuse me .
The streets looked small , of course .
I am his wife. ’ ‘ Yes .
<NAME> and <NAME> are inside .
Will Jenny be here soon ?
And regarding that name of <NAME> , likewise .
‘ Not yet , ’ said <NAME> , sarcastically .
‘ I have had enough of that. ’ ‘ Ay ? ’ cried <NAME> .
‘ I am sensitive and brave .
`` Are you sure you 're quite so much as six foot three ? ''
Mrs <NAME> was , of course , a tall woman and an angular .
Listen to what I say to you .
But it didn ’ t hurt him .
What did he do before he went ?
It made me run away to you .
As he spoke , it closed with a loud noise .
'Three pound ten , ' repeated <NAME> , firmly .
He was in the <NAME> , necessarily .
<NAME> admitted the soft impeachment .
This is <NAME> , whom I love .
‘ I am very , very sorry , ’ said <NAME> .
I am not of an inhuman disposition , sir . '
Then the figure ’ s disposed of .
They were still face to face .
‘ I see what ’ s the matter with you , ma ’ am .
Had he ever been a spy himself ?
After a short pause , the <NAME> reappeared , and whispered <NAME> mysteriously .
Not in that tumbler , pray .
But I am quite convinced that this would never be the case with Mr .
I trip over a word .
‘ Do you suppose nobody is ever to look at me ?
‘ Please Heaven , there will be many such opportunities , ’ said <NAME> .
All new-comers were presented to him .
The second frightening incident was this .
Then wait at the corner of the street ‘ till you see me .
I have said enough , and more than enough .
The hand was pointed straight before them .
“ What is it ? ” cried <NAME> , affrighted .
<NAME> night ! ’ So <NAME> went home to his town house to bed .
`` Spoken like the best of little women ! ''
Particularly , <NAME> said , sir. ’ ‘ Tell him to come up .
Late that night , <NAME> arrived .
‘ You ’ re sure of what you tell me ?
I went one day to dine with them while I was under this impression .
`` Did she eat or drink here ? ''
`` I should have thought there might have been .
' I did n't mean to do it ! '
What was it as you named , agin ?
We should have cake and wine , too , before we go !
‘ Fetch him ! ’ cried the stranger .
`` How do you do , my dear old fellow ?
<NAME> ’ t you found that out yet ?
How many years , old girl .
‘ I know it , ’ said <NAME> .
Speak the truth , and you shall not be friendless while I live . '
what ’ s parents got in their heads ?
‘ As bonny as a rose !
We had a quiet day .
Is it true , or a lie ? '
<NAME> knows what he sees .
‘ I won ’ t be trespassed upon .
B. ! ’ cried the Major , seeing that she faltered for his name .
<NAME> shook his head , and wished he knew himself .
‘ <NAME> happy in your own reflections !
' I 'll not hear another word .
Mr <NAME> has been so good. ’ She changed suddenly .
She ’ s full one minute , and round upon you next .
'No , ' said the doctor , with a very shrewd and satisfied look .
All day , she seemed to pervade the whole house .
‘ Do , my boy. ’ ‘ You misunderstand me , ’ said <NAME> .
I thought it would. ’ ‘ Wrong , ’ replied <NAME> .
Mrs. <NAME> 's got the key ! ''
Save the prisoner <NAME> at <NAME> ! ” and a thousand answering shouts .
`` And I am very well indeed , and very happy . ''
‘ I am glad you think of it so pleasantly .
I have all these facts right ?
“ In <NAME> 's room. ” They stared again .
<NAME> being the family name of the apple-faced family .
What am I thinking about !
Such Characters , <NAME> , such Characters !
‘ But I have , ’ rejoined <NAME> , rubbing his hands .
As it fell away , he shook it off .
“ I did so , raising the boy 's head against my knee .
‘ No , not an old woman .
It 's a poor thing , you know , but it 's a keepsake .
`` Nor to hear , miss , '' returned <NAME> .
`` But he meant to be ! ''
Traces of its course were visible on every side .
A black friend of the black driver is sitting on a fence .
Let me do myself justice , however .
I laughed at the accident .
you want me ? ’ said the count , turning back .
<NAME> is not to be trusted .
But I mean with a will. ’ ‘ I have no will .
Sometimes I thought , should I frown at him or shake my head .
Therefore , to my patron I will be scrupulously true .
The <NAME> made answer , <NAME> !
‘ I can ’ t , upon my life .
He rejoined with another short dumb nod .
It is he who encourages me .
I ’ ll ruin him , if you do .
<NAME> day again , my good woman . ''
<NAME> and escaping would be the construction in either case .
‘ You and I never had a word .
‘ I won ’ t ! ’ screamed the woman .
`` Constable , I have no doubt he 'll move on .
‘ That ’ s the thing , that ’ s the thing .
I know ! ’ said <NAME> , immediately catching at the sound .
I merely named the time . ''
How did I lose her ?
‘ Yes you do , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ It ’ s retaliation perhaps ; perhaps whim .
‘ This kiss for your child !
My uncle descended from his perch in a twinkling .
It ’ s a very small property , it is indeed .
‘ Ho ! ’ Horses plunge , and splash the black driver .
`` Some weeks , I am afraid . ''
This was the probable destination of his sister Kate .
He was too unfortunate even to come through a supper like anybody else .
To which <NAME> retorts again , `` Yes , you are ! ''
The present representative of the <NAME> is an excellent master .
‘ It ’ s a great quality after all , ’ said the Major .
‘ What is soon done , sir ? ’ returned <NAME> .
he returned inquiringly , raising his pleasant eyebrows .
‘ What are these lads for ? ’ inquired <NAME> abruptly .
The elder sees it in him .
‘ What is the present need , <NAME> ?
‘ Oh ! ’ returned old <NAME> feigning to be suddenly enlightened .
No , she war n't up at the house now .
Spies ! ” He asked another man .
‘ Good-night ! ’ said <NAME> , running up to <NAME> .
‘ Not yet , sir , ’ I said , flinching with the pain .
‘ We shall be sure to succeed , ’ said the schoolmaster , heartily .
Now , good-bye , <NAME> , and be very happy ! ''
‘ If I wasn ’ t soured , my answer would be no .
‘ In <NAME> , ’ Mr <NAME> answered .
But what turned out to be the case ?
`` Of course , <NAME> , you know what she says here ? ''
Our father and our brother had a builder 's business .
Then I have only done my best to keep my promise to <NAME> .
<NAME> ’ t let me wander till I have spoken .
' A great number , sir , ' replied <NAME> .
<NAME> to the thundering in the chimney , and the surging noise !
“ The brothers were waiting in a room down-stairs , impatient to ride away .
The visitor came in accordingly .
Mr <NAME> was charmed , of course .
Ring , and take me to my room ! ''
‘ Oh , my eyes and limbs , what do you want ?
You said I had been exaggerative .
That seemed to have been determined among us from the first .
‘ I am wrong , perhaps , ’ rejoined <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> ’ laud ’ num in it , ’ replied <NAME> .
‘ If you could , you ’ d have done it long ago .
It shook one house , or so a man says who was passing .
The praise of mankind was his swing ; philanthropy was his insurance office .
‘ Now we must sit close , ’ said the stout gentleman .
Passionate with you , sir , I respect myself for being .
“ Is there any Miss Havisham down town ? ” returned my sister .
He ca n't look uglier than he did in that one . ''
To a defined extent , ’ observed Mr Dorrit .
‘ “ Who calls so loud ? ” ’ repeated <NAME> .
‘ I endured it all in silence .
My brother is , but I am not .
“ I would n't lend one of you a sixpence .
But I have nothing more to say .
I thought that with her I could have been happy there for life .
Is this just towards her ?
‘ Really , this child ’ s manners have become very boisterous .
So you never clapped your eyes upon the country -- marshes and dreams excepted .
‘ That ’ s the house , ’ replied <NAME> .
I believe the very same slow horse that <NAME> drove was still at work .
Why does she come so close ?
They affect fashion too , and wonder where the <NAME> is .
I ’ m only their father-in-law. ’ ‘ Oh !
The <NAME> stillness of the time ( the day was so like Sunday !
‘ My life ! ’ and kissed her hand .
What a great age , '' said my guardian .
Very few whispers broke the mournful silence .
It was not her fault , if the warning were fruitless .
<NAME> asked him what he thought he heard .
It appears to me that it doubles while I touch it .
His hands began plucking off his coat .
IS my day past , and is this indeed the coming on of night ?
<NAME> says the cat , Quack-quack says the duck , Bow-wow-wow says the dog !
‘ Why not ? ’ said <NAME> .
He pointed there , as he replied , with trembling lips .
On striking into it he turned his lantern off .
Oh , <NAME> , what have you done ?
‘ Is he at home ? ’ ‘ Why ? ’ rejoined <NAME> .
No power on earth should stop me , while I was standing here !
All the rest , by some extraordinary means , has melted away . ''
‘ But , indeed , I am in a most enviable state .
Where have you been , this long , long while ?
‘ Was he young or old , healthy or sickly , tractable or rebellious ?
Both my sister and myself have endeavoured to correct his vices , but ineffectually .
She saw that the mute avoidance had begun .
‘ Looder still. ’ The boys obeyed .
Mrs. Leo <NAME> looked round her in triumph .
It was a bit of the printed description of your house at <NAME> .
But you can ’ t get beforehand with me .
<NAME> said he thought not .
Here he paused , and looked about for the inn .
Who sent you down here ?
But as the day declined , the life seemed to go down too .
It was late , and we were alone together -- for the first time .
It Was Bestowed Upon <NAME> By Providence .
You do n't intend to tell me you 've been out of spirits .
A fell , uncompromising , murderous business-meaning there .
It is not a large world .
And do n't let me suffer more for you , just now .
‘ Well , I can spare the evening , ’ said the schoolmaster .
He was so quick that he saw it in an instant .
“ The time has not gone by , <NAME> , has it ?
`` We 're a-going to mark this person down .
<NAME> confirmed her with two nods , as <NAME> looked to him .
`` What do you wish me not to have ?
I ’ d have had that bottle out of him .
said Mrs. Mann , whimpering pathetically .
The three looking into each other 's faces , seemed to breathe more freely .
Again and again it rose .
HE do n't find no fault with it .
They all try to quiet him , but he points again with increased agitation .
'Do you hear me call ?
‘ From your partner ? ’ returned <NAME> .
`` What a great age , <NAME> ! ''
‘ Has my dream come true ?
‘ That is the device , ’ returned <NAME> .
‘ How do you do to-night sir ? ’ said <NAME> , peeping in .
But first I went downstairs to see <NAME> and <NAME> .
Why , this is a private asylum !
‘ Also professional ? ’ said <NAME> , looking at <NAME> through an eye-glass .
<NAME> , call down <NAME> -- and not his daughter .
But <NAME> knew better than that .
That shall be my way out .
‘ Little Em ’ ly , ’ I said , glancing at her .
When had she ever shown him duty and submission ?
I got up despairing , and went out despairing .
‘ Mr Twemlow , I think ? ’ The dried gentleman seemed much surprised .
You 'll say something that 'll be used against you , you know .
I will have it done. ’ Miss Murdstone gave a hoarse chuckle .
`` My love , '' said I , `` it quite confuses me .
I was too late , and they was gone .
inquired <NAME> , after a moment 's pause .
' A great deal better , thank you , sir , ' replied <NAME> .
The guns have been going since dark , about .
`` I will not trouble you , <NAME> .
The bell did ring in due course , and <NAME> presented himself .
‘ Dear me , child ! ’ exclaimed <NAME> , recoiling in surprise .
The salute was acknowledged with : ‘ Morning , sir !
Not a word was spoken , not a sound was made .
He bore an animosity towards the deceased gentleman .
Parents boldly represented themselves as dead , and brought their orphans with them .
'Nothing to-night , ' said the Jew , turning away .
There were voices within the house .
I hope you are well , <NAME> .
Never was such a blaze of beauty , and fashion , and literature .
I 'm wrong in these clothes .
`` Why , here 's an extraordinary thing ! ''
That it was a great comfort they continued happy .
‘ I have been shown so too , ’ said <NAME> , coldly .
So they both did better than before .
cries Grandfather Smallweed , screwing up his eyes .
<NAME> and his friends are strangers .
`` Only a little , '' <NAME> explains .
Jaggers. -- And ( I added ) , I would gladly try that gentleman .
have -- a commodity to sell to my lady your respectable mother .
I ’ m a second father to you , ’ replied <NAME> .
‘ So I am off , ’ added Mr Merdle , getting up .
Not the other. ’ ‘ Altro , altro !
I am tickled and twitched all over .
`` You forget how long I have been here . ''
‘ I am really afraid he does not , ’ says my mother .
`` I think I know that much of him .
Her father saw them glistening , though he appeared to look at <NAME> only .
Or it may frighten her .
Let any one who doubts this , compare the two .
( To the company in general . )
And I must consult you a little more , as I used to do .
They look at each other , like two pictures .
‘ Very good , ’ said the magistrate , signing the warrants .
But Deputy is not to be so easily brought across .
A honouring and obeying wife would let his trade alone altogether .
He has come from Baden-Baden on purpose .
upon my soul , you know ! ’ before his presence of mind returned .
Perhaps <NAME> was going to be a sailor .
As to mine—but the less said of that commonplace commodity the better .
Am I to open it ?
The supper table being small , it pleased him very well .
But this occasion , being special , is a source of pride to me .
`` Are you the boy I 've read of in the papers ? ''
Do n't you KNOW that these arm-chairs were borrowed to be sat upon ? '
They had all turned from him and deserted him in his very first need .
I ask your pardon , sir , if I intrude .
The youth of the streets could not endure it .
In the Queen of <NAME> ?
No need to be bought out , sir .
`` Her gratitude to you , <NAME> , is delightful .
They need send nobody to me .
I stayed away , loving you .
The landlord reciprocated the old man 's laugh ; and returned to his guests .
He could see the light of the fire shining through the window .
I am , as you say , at a disadvantage .
`` I dare say you would !
<NAME> eyes her as if some of us would be enough for him .
`` What do they say of him ? ''
As dearly as he loves me .
But it ’ s illustrative of the neatness of <NAME> ’ s humour .
He finished by genially kissing my hand and thanking me .
`` I was born in the country , <NAME> . ''
You know the kind of document , sir -- wanting employ ? ''
We were all bewildered , <NAME> , more or less .
<NAME> of us two is the better man ?
I attended him in his last illness .
‘ Consider why the very same words ?
What a use for the money , and how worthy of its old misuses !
To <NAME> and to me , that above all appeared the pervading influence .
They would rather <NAME> have a man of <NAME> ’ s abilities .
`` Do as well as anything else ! ''
`` I am sure that what I recommend is necessary . ''
‘ Oh ! ’ ‘ Yes , sir , ’ returned Mr Dorrit .
`` To which I shall pay , of course , my usual attention . ''
`` I ca n't help it , <NAME> . ''
and drew their chairs closer together .
Oh don ’ t bring him , don ’ t bring him !
inquired <NAME> of the girl who opened the door .
' A couple of pocket-books , ' replied that young gentlman .
My dear Copperfield , she is the only starry spot in a miserable existence .
The whole business shows the child from beginning to end .
Not having <NAME> to look at , he looked straight before him .
Consequently she is like a thoroughly fine day .
‘ <NAME> , you have a couple of horses down here .
Perhaps he has something else upon it -- some young lady , perhaps . ''
I am not a great impostor .
Considering the differences and distances betwixt us , more so .
‘ No doubt he was gone .
Talk of the cordial that sparkled for <NAME> !
`` Real good friends of mine , they are , '' sald <NAME> .
‘ The new boy , ’ said the <NAME> .
That was in the old country .
I said , certainly we would have him .
I am much obliged to you , sir , for all .
But , when <NAME> opened her arms , he repulsed her afresh .
Oh , yes , it was expressly understood ! ’ said <NAME> .
My old lady has got so used to the property .
Yet , what I suffered outside was nothing to what I underwent within .
‘ You _must_ paper it , ’ said the gentleman , rather warmly .
‘ That ’ s <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
He gave me something and called it commission .
'It would be too much for one , ' murmured the lady .
‘ The monarch was frantic at the loss of his son .
But tell me again , <NAME> .
She was always gentle with children .
Having done this , he retired .
‘ We will -- ha -- not pursue the subject .
‘ What did he say ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
It ’ s convenient to have you at all times ready on the premises .
‘ Well ? ’ says <NAME> , smiling , ‘ are you quite ready ?
‘ I ’ m a going So and So .
“ Keep it for me until to-morrow .
‘ Who ’ s that , I wonder ! ’ said <NAME> .
I am delighted to see you .
‘ Very laudable indeed , ’ said <NAME> .
Wherever you went , <NAME> , you heard of nothing but <NAME> and <NAME> .
She had no inducements to go back , and had rarely gone .
It was into this place that the Jew turned .
<NAME> ’ t let that influence you , sir .
All I 've got ai n't mine ; it 's yourn .
I struck him , and he knows why .
He started up , and stared eagerly in my face .
`` Why , <NAME> , '' remonstrates his friend , `` how you look !
<NAME> <NAME> is thinning fast . ''
‘ Where ’ s <NAME> , ‘ Tilda ? ’ said <NAME> .
I have followed him with my eyes , In the broad day .
‘ It is my aunt. ’ ‘ Dear me ! ’ said <NAME> .
He received us very affectionately , and we sat down .
And what 's six weeks of it ?
You did a great deal truly ! ’ said <NAME> .
What a lovely woman you are !
What I look at is the sacrifice of so much portable property .
‘ Stop him ! ’ cried <NAME> , bolting out in pursuit .
His regard for <NAME> , however , overcame every other consideration .
rejoins <NAME> with extreme cordiality .
'He ca n't live a week , the doctor says , ' pursued <NAME> .
Her father had to do with the victualling of passenger-ships .
robbers ! ’ ‘ For what are these cries raised ?
The two were formed to become intimate .
‘ What ’ s the matter ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
<NAME> Sally complying , he desired Mr <NAME> to accompany them .
Why , isn ’ t it a beautiful sacrifice ?
I had not mistaken the expression of his face .
He might see it and speak of it , otherwise , by some accident .
I wo n't go to the berryin ground .
If it said now , `` Do n't go home ! ''
Do you consent to the terms , and will you take the money ?
<NAME> closes his eyes , muttering , `` I 'm wery thankful . ''
`` Will you tell us that ? ''
The <NAME> moved away as it had come towards him .
I have found no trace of her down about us. ’ ‘ Stay !
‘ I indited a letter to my master .
When this despondency was at its worst , I believed that I should die .
You won ’ t let me love you when I want to .
The other , similar in effect , to <NAME> .
It was not the money. ’ ‘ Bah , bah , bah !
<NAME> sets us all right .
‘ But it ’ s not the sum ; it ’ s the fact .
I felt it when I was examining the quality .
‘ Such things happen every day , ’ remarked the lawyer .
‘ Quite true , constable , ’ assented <NAME> in the same mournful tone .
He wanted nothing but his whip .
I say to this Rokesmith here , much he cares about the truth .
‘ Now , <NAME> , I put it to you .
‘ He was rather a low sort of pony .
Expect the first to-morrow , when the bell tolls One . ''
<NAME> <NAME> taken , my sister !
`` Then make it easy for her ! ''
I mean to be serious and earnest. ’ ‘ Thank you , <NAME> .
He answered ‘ Yes , ’ and she came in with Mr Meagles .
( In a very surly tone . )
Now , <NAME> , you have been knocking about in the world some time .
‘ You ’ re going in ? ’ said <NAME> .
That is self-evident on the face of it .
Consider what a connexion it is likely to be .
If he should be accused , you must keep him silent and save him .
We must have our head-quarters in <NAME> now .
But to return to your brother .
There were no children , no servants , no fowls .
I have forgotten all my old ways .
said <NAME> : 'Oliver , sir , -- <NAME> has -- ' 'What ?
It was a woman ’ s voice , too .
There are so many houses .
`` That 's the state of the case , '' said <NAME> .
`` He will stand by the low boy , always .
How well I recollect the wintry ride !
At length <NAME> rises to depart .
The candle was burning low in the socket when he rose to his feet .
I don ’ t think I was much astonished .
Not done a stroke of work these ten days .
`` I was looking for your father , sir .
They met for that purpose .
I wonder you are not ashamed to mention the name of <NAME> !
`` Of course they are not ! ''
When the choristers chaunt , I hear <NAME> .
You are her best friend .
Her reception of him is not flattering .
There 's a very bad sort of fever about him . ''
‘ Come in ! ’ calls <NAME> ; meaning come round by the door .
‘ Nothing to fear if they took me from thee !
“ Is he alone ? ” the latter whispered .
And still the riot went on .
Then why did n't you say so at first ?
said Mrs. Jellyby , quite weary of such little matters .
‘ OH , my friends , the down-trodden operatives of <NAME> !
Mrs <NAME> did the honours of the first glass by proclaiming : ‘ R .
with a smack and a relish suggestive of the very finest oysters .
‘ Let us see what it is , ’ cried the dressmaker .
You see how it moves me .
The stout figure commenced the dialogue .
‘ Yet I don ’ t see <NAME> , still ! ’ said he .
A round dozen of ’ em , sir .
There is a fascination in you. ’ ‘ O !
Call it four and ninepence -- call it four pound nine .
nothing to grumble at , you know , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ No doubt you are well acquainted with the writing .
<NAME> appeared to be the only exception to this rule .
The old girl , '' says <NAME> .
‘ I ain ’ t got no call to go and tell her so .
‘ Mr <NAME> , sir , good morning !
<NAME> might have looked as lonely and avoided .
To that she emphatically said “ God forbid ! ” and no more .
The news is sure to overset him .
What might you want with me ?
I hope we are not late .
There 's the window where I saw the wandering Spirits !
The <NAME> returned immediately , with two men .
Do n't think I 've kept anything from you .
We neither of us quite knew what to answer .
‘ Get along with you ! ’ said Mrs. Weller , pushing him away .
Political friends ’ ll do it sometimes .
<NAME> <NAME> was very partial to gingerbread .
It is his humour to be a helpless , crushed , and broken man .
‘ Nothing , I believe , ’ returned my aunt .
When she went on , Mrs. <NAME> went on .
`` They 've got her ladyship 's watch among 'em .
Then he should have held his tongue .
Her colour still came and went , but she breathed more freely .
‘ But the visitor , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> will never let her die so young . '
Throughout the day the old house within the gateway remained untroubled by any visitors .
She would n't hear of it .
`` Why to a poor one most ? ''
I had been a seaman too .
You make your bed , and you must lie on it .
‘ I am far from it .
What hurt have you got ?
‘ You are the <NAME> in the <NAME> , the wicked Wolf !
I am sure it will be natural and right .
I am ashamed to speak the words , but I relent .
`` I know as well , <NAME> -- what shall I say ?
‘ Sometimes you ’ re all for a chat .
‘ Not so much as I could wish .
That I never will relax in my secrecy or in my search .
The sound of approaching footsteps roused him .
He objected to their being worn .
‘ But hearken , missus , hearken , ’ said <NAME> , astonished .
Here we stand , all three , before me now .
<NAME> <NAME> , <NAME> , was more than aware of Mr and <NAME> .
`` Lie down , and tell me .
He was a dog sufficiently well known .
( All very well of course , but not altering the case . )
‘ I beg your pardon , ’ repeated <NAME> .
The woman sat with her arms crossed and her eyes upon the ground .
Sit down and take your breath . ''
What he could save for the owners , he saved .
'That 's the only way of bringing him to his senses ! '
He was modestly impressed by <NAME> 's professional eminence .
And yet <NAME> was in the Rules of the King ’ s <NAME> !
Two score and twelve were told off .
'Wanted to get assistance ; called for the police ; did you ? '
She ’ s the faithfullest of creeturs .
A farm ? ’ ‘ A brother and sister .
What can you have to do with my knowing or not knowing any name ?
A very good song , Mr <NAME> , very good .
‘ Do you see this , monster ?
‘ You have seen him , sir ? ’ said <NAME> ’ s papa .
I am thankful -- quiet -- humble -- anything you like .
The young lady is <NAME> .
I love you ; you know I love you dearly .
‘ Very well ! ’ said <NAME> .
`` Flat as ever so much swipes , '' says <NAME> .
Supposing the first blow had been truer .
Give me back the money. ’ ‘ Alice !
I abridge nothing I have ever bestowed upon her .
‘ What do you mean , <NAME> ? ’ said <NAME> .
‘ I wants to make your flesh creep , ’ replied the boy .
In some respects , he treads in the footsteps of his sainted mother .
Let her look at this !
‘ Yes , <NAME> , on my word , and you shall see it .
<NAME> <NAME> ’ s brother had thrown a knife at <NAME> .
‘ And doomsday , ’ said the daughter .
<NAME> <NAME> touched me , and whispered with much awe and reverence .
she said with some disdain .
Where 's the gal going to at this time of night ? '
That inscription is now erased .
Which he soon forgot to do .
<NAME> Leicester replies , `` All times are alike to me . ''
said the Jew , turning quickly round , 'is that -- ' 'Yes ! '
But he overheard her , and called out who was that ?
and to me too ! ’ replied the dwarf .
There may be no occasion for it .
The clerk observed that it was only once a year .
`` Look at the son 's dress ! ''
Yes , she said , <NAME> had taken the place .
Then let us partake of the good things which are set before us ! ''
All this I have done for your sake . ''
All day long , it blew without cessation .
‘ <NAME> , cats , water , drains , ’ said <NAME> .
I know you , <NAME> ; I saw you before the <NAME> to-day .
‘ You skate , of course , <NAME> ? ’ said <NAME> .
This is human natur , is it !
Your mistress is a little unwell .
The old man laughed , and gave her his arm to lean on .
We shall have YOU taking fire next or blowing up with a bang . ''
What is it that I naturally turn my thoughts to ? ''
<NAME> , look after the shop .
But I know no more about them , and I tell him so . ''
He walked to <NAME> .
‘ Step in , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
Of one thing you may be perfectly certain .
Am I not now bound in honour to repress these thoughts ?
The fact is , I see , you mean to offer me advice .
My uncle caught her up , and bore her to the house door .
He could force nothing upon himself but a cup of tea .
returned the woman , laughing and leaning forward on her crossed arms .
`` Let the young man wait . ''
Have the kindness , <NAME> , to open the door for me . ''
Here , <NAME> , take my child , for goodness ' sake . ''
I never saw the old girl 's equal .
Where shall I take you ?
It was the ingenuous , confiding , loving child he saw and heard .
I am glad to believe you have repented and recovered yourself .
What ’ s more , he said that he done the deed .
I possess a noble nature .
You need do no more than think , “ Ah !
I meant to be , <NAME> knows , ’ said the poor schoolmaster .
He is generally so -- so very attentive and respectful .
I ’ d never thought of it .
“ And only he , ” said <NAME> .
‘ You saw me load them .
In consequence of the necessity of attending on the Chancellor .
In short , everything here. ’ ‘ Must it ?
I don ’ t profess to be clear about dates .
“ I do n't want to get into trouble .
‘ Yes , ’ he said placidly , ‘ good-bye !
How do you call the man ?
What ’ s the use of considering ?
I Enlarge My Circle of <NAME> VII .
<NAME> <NAME> answers with a suppressed groan , oh , do n't he !
I have nothing more to say to this young man ! ''
I have no head for papers , sir .
Upon my word , that ’ s very clever now !
‘ Yes , my pretty , ’ answered <NAME> .
She had suffered the wreck of her whole life upon the rock .
I shall keep my own side , ’ said Mrs. Nickleby .
He looked unprepared for my being so earnest , and even a little alarmed .
He did not know me , but I knew him in a moment .
I am not sure that it is dark enough yet , but listen !
It was a habit of his .
‘ <NAME> , hurrah loike men too .
‘ You will convince yourself ? ’ said <NAME> .
It was not a lady .
‘ One of Mrs. Chillip ’ s most impressive remarks .
Besides , apart from its being politic , it is right .
‘ <NAME> and <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , musing .
She has youth , you have money .
‘ I take a great interest in her , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
What fragrant coolness revived him ; what gushing sound was that ?
I wish I didn ’ t feel ‘ em , but I do .
‘ <NAME> ! ’ said <NAME> , coughing delicately behind her black silk mitten .
What I am to be depends on you .
The nondescript had known her many years .
‘ Yes , ’ said <NAME> ; ‘ they are well .
The house swarmed with inmates .
That boy ’ s father and myself , <NAME> , were sworn friends .
It IS the Dictionary ! ’ How could it be anything else !
She had found it all out the night before .
No , not for the first time .
You ’ ve been seen in the act of ferreting about this yard .
‘ Bad thing for a young man to lose his father .
The very genteel lady -- ‘ Silence ! ’ cried Mr Dorrit .
`` Ma , I always hated and detested Mr .
‘ How do you find yourself this morning , sir ?
`` Yes , <NAME> , '' said I , quietly putting up my hair .
‘ I hope so , ’ returned her brother .
He came upon the spot .
This always pleased the eminently practical friend .
<NAME> , I go to Plornish .
‘ How can you say such a thing ?
‘ A right you little dream of .
‘ Theer we are , <NAME> ! ’ Mrs. Gummidge slightly groaned .
`` No , sir , '' replies <NAME> .
They didn ’ t buy anything , ’ said <NAME> , quietly .
`` I do n't want to argue with ladies and gentlemen .
'What have you done , old fellow ? '
`` It goes to my heart .
‘ She don ’ t know what she means .
He entirely agrees with my Lady .
‘ We met Mr Carker the <NAME> in the street , queerer than ever .
'None , your worship , ' replied the policeman .
`` I have no doubt of it , '' said <NAME> .
I will be a friend to you , in spite of you .
‘ Or how clever , ’ said <NAME> .
'Turn them away , ' said the woman , drowsily ; 'make haste !
“ Are we not going too slowly ?
I should leave you nowhere now .
‘ Not at all , ’ replied <NAME> .
`` Take a little care of <NAME> while I am gone , <NAME> ! ''
But I only drank my coffee .
`` When I married <NAME> I was not insensible to what was before him .
'What do you watch me for ?
‘ How ’ s Pussy getting on <NAME> ? ’ ‘ With her music ?
`` Very requisite , no doubt , '' returned <NAME> .
‘ It was cold , ’ returned Mr Dombey .
At least , I only knew her as such .
It ’ s impossible to bear it .
‘ <NAME> forbid him the house and ordered him out of it .
“ He 's a liar born , and he 'll die a liar .
His principal anxiety was about his wife .
I agree with the poet in every particular , ma ’ am .
They ’ ll not mind what I do , if it ’ s wrong .
says Mrs. Bagnet with a mother 's pity .
I suppose such a creature goes where there is occasion for him .
‘ He is a vagabond , <NAME> , ’ said the magistrate .
It had a rich sound .
‘ Mottled-faced man , p ’ raps ? ’ asked <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> , ’ said the gentleman , ‘ pray walk in .
It was clear that the whole establishment was roused .
The book fell from her hand .

`` I made ten pounds , clear , out of <NAME> ' business . ''
‘ I want to talk to you .
‘ <NAME> out of the question , ’ observed <NAME> .
He was roused by a loud shouting of the post-boy on the leader .
I don ’ t wonder at it .
There were very many of them .
I shouldn ’ t be surprised if you did .
<NAME> ’ s <NAME> was uncommonly incredulous .
Let us have done with that .
‘ I may say before it .
<NAME> ’ t tell me ! ’ <NAME> seemed quite frightened .
‘ I hope so , ’ said Mrs. <NAME> .
Was he not an emigrant then ?
‘ But very soon to be , ’ cried <NAME> .
'Suppose he did all this , what then ? '
That 's the time of day . '
Whatever my wishes might be , I could not respect them .
`` Speak up ; none of your brimstone tricks .
What faces are the most distinct to me in the fleeting crowd ?
'Some people are nobody 's enemies but their own , yer know . '
That sort of vanity don ’ t pay , <NAME> .
‘ Good evening , ’ said Mr Flintwinch .
Durdles seats himself upon a step .
‘ Do you deny your old chum !
`` You live down in Tom-all-Alone 's .
She said she did , and I have no doubt she did .
She saw him in the street , constantly .
I put it to him , 'This is unreasonable and inconvenient .
The two friends rise and look at one another .
`` And about your wardrobe , <NAME> ? ''
‘ How do you presume to come here ?
She was an audacious woman , and openly looked compassionately at me .
I don ’ t state any opinion .
She took her , faint and trembling , on her arm .
No matter , <NAME> remarked .
But the sentiment of all this was as boyish and innocent as could be .
<NAME> step back into the next room. ’ Into the next room they went .
'Who would have thought it !
‘ He recollects what it is , does he ? ’ said <NAME> .
‘ This is a most extraordinary request , ’ said the magistrate .
It would puzzle me to tell you , it would by <NAME> .

She came on a visit of a fortnight to the <NAME> ’ s .
‘ Is that all ? ’ asked <NAME> .
You must instantly be obedient , still , and quiet .
At last we entered , only this to-day , and now you see him !
‘ You oughtn ’ t to like it in any case .
I thank you fifty times .
Mrs Wickam having clinked sufficiently among the bottles , now produced the mixture .
The command was not to be resisted .
So I get a little practice with -- who do you think ?
‘ Who ’ d stay there , without making any noise !
Wititterly is quite a martyr , ’ observed <NAME> , with a complimentary bow .
Look to yourself , and heed this warning that I give you !

I know the man , sir .
returned the coward , overwhelmed by these accumulated charges .
Some boy ’ s definition of a horse .
'Keep back the dog ; he 'll tear the boy to pieces . '
‘ And you come here from her ? ’ said the <NAME> .
I say it on my knees , old <NAME> ; on my knees ! ''
‘ Well , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , eyeing him maliciously .
A halfpenny an hour shan ’ t part us .
That is , no misfortune has happened .
Here , he indistinctly resolved to tarry and rest .
Mr <NAME> had only three stages of existence .
'The will , ' said <NAME> , as <NAME> 's tears fell fast .
Remember that I confide in simple love and truth at last .
He can not bear to see a cloud upon her face .
You may go into <NAME> , with precaution , and never be run over .
I am no more guilty than any one of you .
But you must dry your eyes first , and compose yourself .

That there could be no such beauty without it .
‘ To the devil with this plain that has no end !
<NAME> , draw me back a little .
`` A young scholar of mine , my Lady .
I am here for that purpose .
That was my case with the idea in question .
Older folk than you have wondered at the same thing before now .
For why ? ’ said the <NAME> .

Now , you wanted to see <NAME> , <NAME> .
The <NAME> surveyed them , remained in his corner , and surveyed the messenger .
He several times spoke with an emphasis , similar to the vulgar manner .
At this quiet time , Mr Pancks softly appeared before her , urbanely nodding .
It is speedily done , and <NAME> appears .
As to the amount of strain upon the intellect now .
I know what I owe you .
“ I hope I know my poor grandpapa 's position .
<NAME> in more ways than one , I think !
But <NAME> soon made the discovery that <NAME> didn ’ t read fairly .
NOT being Mrs. <NAME> , who _was_ <NAME> ?
Those little things are so sharp !
‘ A sudden spasm , ’ said <NAME> , glancing at <NAME> .
‘ He goes down with me tomorrow , sir , ’ said <NAME> .
said <NAME> , rubbing his hands with great satisfaction .
My darkening the light made her look up .
In the afternoon he turned his steps towards his nephew 's house .
The finger pointed from the grave to him , and back again .
“ You should know , ” said <NAME> .
He was not mistaken in his impression of the place .
And they call <NAME> Rumty. ’ ‘ How dare they ! ’ exclaimed <NAME> .
It ha ’ shined into my mind .
‘ It ’ s oh do and oh do .
<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> with their heads together !
Bless the dear laughing children !
Three in that room , ’ said <NAME> , pointing .
Or , at all events , with one drawback .
‘ It ’ s no one particular , sir , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ My God ! ’ he suddenly exclaimed .
My patroness , too , might hear of him , and not approve .
‘ Of course it will , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ I was determined , I suppose .
‘ Everything on our side , ’ repeated the boy with boyish confidence .
‘ Very good , ma ’ am , ’ returned <NAME> .
But presently I discovered underneath it , <NAME> .
He had been to see us several times altogether .
Just as a matter of form , ’ replied Mrs. <NAME> .
<NAME> quietly remains at the bedside , waiting to be spoken to .
<NAME> stealthily descended the kitchen stairs .
It can be brought about , it shall be brought about .
We must begin to drink out of glasses to-day , <NAME> .
`` I 'll send it to <NAME> 's ! ''
“ Done with their buttons ? ” returned the <NAME> .
He looked again , and he was sure it moved .
‘ I say , delicious , ’ repeated <NAME> .
An introduction which overwhelmed the M.C .

He grunted something or other that meant yes , and I sent .
But by that time he has made her out , in the shade .
She was so singularly earnest that I drew back , almost afraid of her .
That was all passed , all forgiven , all forgotten .
I might have guessed as much before .
He required no further attendance that night .
Which the Court confirmed , to his great satisfaction .
I ought not to murmur .
‘ Two by honours -- makes us eight , ’ said <NAME> .
The universal stare made the eyes ache .
‘ He ’ s very deaf , poor fellow ! ’ cried the sexton .
You remember what I told you .
Then there was a profound silence .
my lungs is wore away to cabbage-nets ! ’ until the fit is over .
`` If you please , sir , '' said I .
I was always thinking of you , in my troubles .
I looked over the books , and formed my own opinion .
`` How are your spirits now , <NAME> ? ''
'They are not , ' replied <NAME> .
Why has n't he thirty thousand a year ? '

But I have such need of your advice and support .
Yes. ’ <NAME> waits for its effect on a common mind .
‘ Let him remember it in that room , years to come !
‘ Not a halfpenny , ’ replied <NAME> .
Have you no regard for true merit , you malignant fellow ?
“ _I_ go through no streets and past no fountains .
I must always be much worse than poor , with you distressed .
`` WHAT do you call him ?
fell upon my neck and kissed me twenty times .
I assure you none are needed .
I should think so. ’ Mr <NAME> did not ?
Tell me something , immediately , about the married pair .
<NAME> , and hope , and beauty are very seldom there .
What do you call that ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , ’ said the <NAME> .
Veneering expresses his inability ever to acknowledge this last service .
‘ There is one friend ! ’ he said , putting up his pocketbook .
Will you have nothing to remember him by but his ruin and decay ?
The spectral voice repeats more solemnly , `` Go away ! ''
It wakes <NAME> of the shooting gallery and his familiar .
The joy , and gratitude , and ecstasy !
Little Dorrit let herself out to do needlework .
Who could tell what the secrets of those two handsome and proud women were !
‘ Is that your penitence ? ’ cried <NAME> , with stinging sharpness .
Therefore , what has become of yours , I leave you to guess .
‘ <NAME> alive ? ’ inquired <NAME> , stepping up to him .
‘ She is the most disagreeable thing I ever saw , ’ said <NAME> .
Mrs <NAME> was married before , and he is her son .
My clothes were rather a disappointment , of course .
Oh , men and <NAME> , the down-trodden operatives of <NAME> !
Her father sat at his old table in the middle room .
‘ Where is Mrs Dombey ? ’ she would say to her maid .
he cried , tight clutching at its robe , `` hear me !
I took a hasty copy of it , while he was out .
How did I learn to love it afterwards , when the harder time came !
One other establishment closes the catalogue .
You know a compatriot who has found a Refuge there ?
But there is nothing to be done in opposition to the <NAME> interest .
Now you pays for it .
`` Oh , I like it well enough ! ''
‘ I hope it never will !
'Because you know it well . '
‘ I am not such a heretic as that .
<NAME> had not lost a word of this .

‘ I knew you wouldn ’ t like it , sir !
It 's stuff and nonsense , <NAME> . ''
If there is an angel anywhere , it ’ s <NAME> .
With this good understanding established between us , it is better never done .
'Or the millingtary , ' suggested <NAME> .
You might as well give me a pair of iron spectacles ! ''
What a man it is !
Is it possible ! ’ ‘ Possible , my dear ?
He was perfectly exhausted , and they were careful not to rouse him .
‘ They kept me very short , ’ said the small servant .
`` Would n't you give them a week ? ''
<NAME> shillings a week not much , young man ? ’ cried Mr Gregsbury .
Fasten the collar of my shirt , my dear .
‘ I should have known her among ten thousand , ’ thought <NAME> .
For I love him , I love him , I love him !
You expect a cove to be a flash of lightning .
Did he look upon his own successful rival in that son ’ s affection ?
It is all one for any sign he makes .
Now , has she deserved this punishment ?
`` And could you not take the same means of rendering a Conversation unnecessary ?
There ’ s wonders in the deep , my pretty .
‘ <NAME> , have you anything to tell me ?
Associations thus awakened , opened floodgates of sorrow .
‘ What did you think of <NAME> ? ’ asked Mr Lammle .
“ Who taught me to be hard ? ” returned <NAME> .
`` Could you fetch me a pinch from anywheres ? ''
‘ What a lovely work that was of yours !
He doted on her boy -- tenderly doted on him !
I want to know ’ waited for his answer .
Where am I to go ? '
<NAME> <NAME> ’ s appearance was not prepossessing .
'Will you go along with me , <NAME> ? '
When is it to come off ? '
Rob the <NAME> loses his Place 56 .
‘ Excellently , and like the true and zealous friend you are .
He is as well acquainted as myself with the subject on which I speak .
But I ’ ll talk to you no more , my lad .
‘ Certainly not , ’ responded <NAME> .
‘ Talk to me of fiery dragons !
<NAME> <NAME> calmly finishes the sentence .
There is only one outside passenger , and he sits upon the box .
‘ There ’ s a small allowance of money , ’ said the schoolmaster .
‘ We draw the line there .
Be seated again , my lord , pray .
My gentleman must have horses , <NAME> !
I want to know your real thoughts , my dear .
‘ Ma shall destroy me first , and then she ’ ll be contented .
The signal was given and the windlass stopped , with abundant rope to spare .
She heard me patiently and smilingly , but was ready with her own answer .
‘ I am much obliged to you , sir , ’ returned <NAME> .
'Bring in your body then , ' said <NAME> .
<NAME> and friend ? ” Identity of <NAME> and friend confessed .
What a light , now , on the protecting manner I had thought about !
‘ A question that naturally follows , ’ said <NAME> .
I hope you succeeded yesterday .
She stopped again , and gave him an earnest supplicating look .
The woman at first gazed at her in astonishment and then burst into tears .
‘ I was there all those years .
`` He had no other calling ? ''
'Nothing when you _are_ used to it , my boy . '
Mrs. Maylie being fatigued , they returned more slowly home .
Then he has been some time out ?
‘ Do I speak and look as if I really had ?
Get in , Nickleby. ’ <NAME> obeyed .
Shall I name it the history of a house ?
she shortly and unexpectedly asked me in the same sulky way .
returned the robber , suppressing his breath .
Mrs Higden goes before all .
I did not know how to excuse myself and looked to <NAME> for aid .
‘ “ How are you , old boy ? ” said <NAME> .
<NAME> ’ t go away , old nurse !
I don ’ t want to say I might , if I chose .
`` A word from <NAME> is so powerful . ''
I have nothing but his signature .
My dear girl was to arrive at five o'clock in the afternoon .
He was glad to leave them , and go wandering higher up .
‘ I will see this man .
‘ It ’ s a gentleman , ’ said Mrs. Raddle .
I will speak as long as you like if you are not sure .
I can give you plenty of forms to fill up .
‘ What place is this ? ’ inquired Mrs. <NAME> , pausing .
You will find it very curious .
‘ A man may do anything lawful , for money .
‘ I am <NAME> ’ s laundress , ’ replied the woman .
She ’ s like a goblin to me .
<NAME> <NAME> , how glad I am to see you , sure-ly ! '
I hastened to inquire its name and purpose , and then my surprise vanished .
Oh , that was a wretched day for me !
But , that circumstance too , had had its influence in his course .
That is among my very earliest impressions .
One would like to know more about this . ''
The fare was very good , and served with great cleanliness .
remarked <NAME> , after he had swallowed it .
‘ No , Mr Boffin , not you sir .
`` That is only for their steps , of course ? ''
‘ Confounded , ’ assented the <NAME> <NAME> .
She had no fear of setting up a rival in her breast .
We shook hands and struck up a sort of friendship . ''
‘ Are you deaf ? ’ inquired the little old gentleman .
Within a single year all this was changed .
The next morning he began his journey .
There was his little scanty travelling clothes upon him .
But I do not know .
I then bound myself once more to the prescribed conditions .
`` Ages have passed since we were in the habit of meeting , Mr .
Mrs <NAME> turned to him laughingly .
And for someone else besides .
They reside in various boarding-houses near at hand .
‘ Is this <NAME> ? ’ ‘ It is , ’ replied <NAME> .
Oh , my friends and fellow-sufferers , and fellow-workmen , and fellow-men !
I ’ ll carry it myself , ’ returned <NAME> .
It was a school for all ages , and for both sexes .
Oh yes , I brought ‘ em together that very day .
But it can be fetched .
Oh , what a scene of horror ! ''
Might it not prove a little worse than she expected ?
You have a face to be remembered , and I remember faces well .
<NAME> seemed equally at a loss .
You knew _me_ , ’ she interrupted .
Mr Toots and Mr Feeder were the next arrivals .
the effect was absolutely dazzling .
<NAME> wishes of all things to know what is doing ?
‘ I should call that almost final , ’ observed <NAME> .
Thus the day cometh , whether or no .
`` Have you nearly concluded your argument ? ''
He was open to conviction .
We were all startled by the fervour of this warning .
‘ I beg your pardon , ’ he said .
`` So I thought , according to what he mentioned to me just now .
`` I scarcely ever looked at it before .
‘ But good gracious me ! ’ cries Mrs Chick blandly .
When I sing , he never moves his eyes from my lips .
Who giveth this woman to be married to this man ?
‘ Tie it to the lattice .
It 's remarkable what mere force of grip there is in these hands .
I helped to bring up <NAME> , her ladyship 's daughter .
‘ I dare say I can , ’ replied Nicholas .
She was rather diminutive altogether .
<NAME> is so delicious to <NAME> as to sit and talk in the dark .
Bless you ! ’ With these words Mrs .
I was afraid of her from the first time I saw her .
Her face was buried in her hands .
You had better stand by the fire here , and dry yourselves a bit .
‘ Was this boy running after you , <NAME> ? ’ asked <NAME> .
And which is the factory ?
‘ I can ’ t say , I am sure .
It was not likely that I should forget it .
`` I have a hand at liberty .
Do not allow yourself to receive a turn unnecessarily .
You would have been if I had been , any way . '
It was one of those colourless days when everything looks heavy and harsh .
You see I have recovered myself .
It ’ s wery unpleasant keepin ’ us vaitin ’ here .
What good had it ever done to him ?
<NAME> and <NAME> was to be sure to remember it . ''
Without doubt , ’ said the gentleman .
'You think like a child , poor boy .
Orses and dorgs is some men ’ s fancy .
and nobody called respecting it ? ’ inquired <NAME> , pausing .
This caught the girl ’ s eye , and she shivered .
`` You are a jolly servant ! ''
<NAME> <NAME> paused not an instant until he was snug in bed .
I find no entertainment here , but quite the reverse .
The fact is , that his mind is too much for him .
‘ These fellows are an immense time with supper , ’ he drawled .
Whether he could rush to the next assizes , and proclaim himself a lawyer ?
I entreat you to forget that I have done so , inadvertently .
‘ I don ’ t know , ’ rejoined <NAME> .
And in <NAME> ’ s arms was an iron box some two feet square .
`` These are peaches , these are .
I wish to see you on another subject .
“ Of ladies ' company , ” said <NAME> .
There was no cause for immediate alarm , he said .
As if <NAME> was a fighter ! ''
We left them full of joy ; and drove away together .
We usually observe the same routine .
What was the <NAME> to him except the King ’ s <NAME> ?
The beauty of the fields ( so small they looked !
I forgive you your part in to-morrow ’ s wickedness .
<NAME> <NAME> has come over from abroad , expressly to attend the marriage .
All very odd , and very satisfactory !
<NAME> <NAME> turned abruptly round , and led the way in silence .
You have made sure of me because you knew that .
Why , I stop here too .
‘ Not light-headed ? ’ said my aunt .
So , with great perseverance and untiring industry , he prospered .
My friend is a regular dab at it .
‘ Very good my lad , then , ’ said the <NAME> , relenting .
‘ There ! ’ said <NAME> , putting the plate before her .
<NAME> <NAME> was one of the chosen .
<NAME> , accompanied by <NAME> , sallies forth to seek his Fortune .
‘ What a man HE is !
‘ I never doubted her , ’ said <NAME> .
I have tidings for him .
That 's where I 'm going to .
He had seen them , but appeared quite incapable of interest or curiosity .
That may be your religion , but it ’ s my gammon .
Yours , _Pickwick_. ” Gentlemen , what does this mean ?
What would he do , whether or not ?
‘ Bless you for thinking o ’ the poor lad wi ’ such tenderness .
‘ I hope so , and father said I was .
<NAME> <NAME> wrapped me up , and immediately we were in the street .
But , as the fingers went , the eyes went , and the thoughts .
Oh , I am not as good a girl as I ought to be .
`` My kind soul of a darling , '' returns the trooper .
<NAME> <NAME> never minces matters .
She will be inveigled and married to that connexion of yours .
<NAME> 's hand moved back to his breast no more .
Her friend had begun his labours only on that day .
Now , my young friends , what is this Terewth then ?
Then I spoke to <NAME> , and I told her what had happened .
Every man thinks for himself , and we are not to be easily overreached .
I lay in that separate building across the courtyard .
<NAME> bless you , my Lady .
‘ Mr and <NAME> ’ returned the young man , rising into a roar .
This difficulty overcome , he took his seat at the desk .
Perhaps I may be , Mrs .
I am stronger than you , I bless Heaven for it .
‘ Not a particle , ’ adds <NAME> .
I can not let you leave me so !
`` Equally of course , '' said she .
‘ “ Don ’ t be frightened , ” said <NAME> .
‘ How ’ s my Jenny ? ’ said the man , timidly .
<NAME> , stir the fire , and make it a brisk one !
‘ I came here , because I was shown the way by your servant .
There are no threats in it .
Do what you think necessary .
‘ Not in generosity ? ’ ‘ Jews and generosity ! ’ said <NAME> .
‘ In short , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ I want <NAME> everywhere .
I never have , my dear , since I believed you .
I hope you are very well . '
Then , we were all happy together .
‘ I do , of course , ’ said <NAME> , eagerly .
How came you to see her ?
<NAME> was closing in when I went downstairs into the natural air .
There was something very awful in this manner of reading .
In this , the people seemed too poor ; in that , too many .
What she always had been to me , she still was ; wholly unaltered .
I could not tell him heartily enough how ready I was to receive her .
For he now opened his eyes .
‘ My dear Sir , I am highly honoured .
<NAME> exclaimed , `` I can not bear it ! ''
I made a perfect victim of myself .
How handsome her eyes looked when she was stooping over him !
I recollect it very well .
“ Not at all , but I hope to know it better .
`` I ca n't say , '' returns Mrs. Snagsby .
They say of her that she has lately grown more handsome and more haughty .
You have not forgotten the provisions of the will .
This is the case all through <NAME> .
But it immediately clears , as he resumes his singing , and his way .
There is no change in him , of course .
Now , my independence as a man is again elevated .
They were not meteors ; they were too low .
Besides , ’ said <NAME> piteously , ‘ look here !
I mistrusted a design to entrap me into some admission .
It is quite a relief to me to hear you say it .
The whole town seemed to be frying in oil .
'The loss of their own good name , ' replied <NAME> .
There is no doubt that she perfectly idolized him .
<NAME> cloth , and the heavy swell cut !
But he had said his last word to him .
The sun was high when they sat down to rest .
‘ Bless my soul , not more than fifty-two !
The best and the worst are known to you , now .
`` Had you known him long ? ''
‘ Dear old thing ! ’ said <NAME> .
There is no harm at all done .
I asked your mother , sir .
I have had no almanack where I have been .
I have tried hard for you , but all to no purpose .
Mrs. <NAME> was in the highest spirits and the most agreeable humour .
Beckoning the man to follow him , he led the way upstairs .
Their eyes met , and the Jew scrutinised her , narrowly .
For <NAME> 's sake , look at this ! ''
They never come to play with us , or talk to us .
And shut up his eye again .
And ‘ deed she was right .
Her eyes by accident met <NAME> ’ s at the moment .
that ’ s got about already , has it ? ’ muttered Mr Boffin .
Why ? ’ ‘ Some suicides happened here , when it was first built .
I held out no promise , and leave you to judge for yourself .
Inquiries were set on foot , and strict searches made .
‘ He is conscious , <NAME> , ’ murmured <NAME> for himself .
<NAME> to see ‘ em , my dear ?
‘ Have I sat upon you ? ’ asked the passenger .
To go back now 'ud be as bad as to stand ground -- worse .
He hastily descended , as the room-door opened , and the girl came out .
“ I have found out who my patron is .
It was all of no use .
I attached no value to them .
I indicated that I had nothing more to say .
‘ <NAME> ’ t be foolish , <NAME> .
You ’ ve know ’ d me afore , <NAME> .
Nevertheless , it was looked for again , and still not found .
‘ But I crave pardon , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ I have seen it very cruel to some of our men .
I had struck him hard enough to give him the toothache , I suppose .
I do n't go anywhere for pain , because I was made for pleasure .
<NAME> not unnaturally answered , “ Well ?
Think what beautiful things we have seen , and how contented we have felt .
'Speak out , or I 'll throttle you ! '
<NAME> <NAME> may ‘ go up ’ with an address .
He now stepped up to where <NAME> and <NAME> stood upon the pavement .
‘ <NAME> did you say ? ’ asked <NAME> .
<NAME> of ingratitoode to his earliest benefactor , and founder of fortun 's .
Owners , <NAME> and Co. , ’ cried <NAME> .
inquired <NAME> , stepping forward as the Jew seized the note .
As yet , of no use .
said <NAME> : 'stradegers id the next roob . '
I hope it was a double one .
Did you say how passionately I have longed to speak to her ?
‘ Peggotty ! ’ said I , quite frightened .
He was delivered to you .
‘ Like the ivy , ’ Mrs <NAME> assented .
Call out for <NAME> , will you ? ''
‘ Now , I must follow him , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ I heard no dog last night , ’ thought <NAME> .
I am charged to find her .
She continued to forget him up to the time of the christening .
He came bearing <NAME> ’ s earnest hope that <NAME> would see her married .
Mrs. <NAME> looked up with an expression of considerable wonderment .
Why should <NAME> , for such no reason , look out of window ?
What would he do then ?
said <NAME> , with quivering lip , and glancing over his shoulder , 'Blood !
Who wears such armour , too , bears with him ever another heavy retribution .
`` Was it <NAME> 's voice I heard ? ''
I got down to <NAME> in the evening , and went to the inn .
There 's no more to be got by it .
I ’ ll die , and make no sign .
He almost said as much .
I never had , I do assure you , sir ! ''
But <NAME> had some little position and connection in <NAME> .
`` I was a ward myself .
`` What do <NAME> care for that , you think , my angel ? ''
He put her gently from him , and looked at her unconscious mother .
Your arm , if you please .
The <NAME> skilfully carries a vein of the prevailing interest through the <NAME> nights .
‘ Ring for the housekeeper , my dear brother -- call <NAME> !
‘ It always IS a steamer , <NAME> , ’ cried another .
He looked at everybody coldly and sarcastically .
‘ For the <NAME> of <NAME> , <NAME> !
She did not call -- unless she did so in her slumber .
How those stains were dispersed about the room !
`` I hope number two 's as good ? ''
he asked , scarcely above his breath .
`` I mean in point of everything , sir . ''
Throw me away , as all the world does .
They only sought permission to retire .
Pegler. ’ ‘ A widder , I think ? ’ said <NAME> .
‘ As I say , <NAME> proposes , <NAME> disposes .
Our time of starting from the <NAME> was two o'clock .
<NAME> had been silent all the way , but she said so too .
‘ I hope I have not disturbed you .
( <NAME> lady , don ’ t you cut in .
She had been <NAME> ’ s stay and comfort during the whole time .
Cautioned me against him before I got into his claws .
He has not been able to get abroad for years .
What use is it of , to anybody !
‘ Heaven bless you , you good man ! ’ cried I .
‘ He he he ! ’ cried <NAME> .
Whether I was at all in danger of being hanged ?
‘ Let us be stirring , <NAME> .
I wish he was deaf .
Betimes in the morning I was up and out .
A parish beadle , or I 'll eat my head . '
My dear , I have told you all . ''
And this was what prevented him .
It may be that he had other views for his son .
This is a bottle. ’ ‘ I see it , ’ answered <NAME> .
Could he be the object of it ?
<NAME> <NAME> appears , greasy , warm , herbaceous , and chewing .
Now , <NAME> , I address myself to you .
‘ Here he is again , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Oh , no , <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> eagerly .
The air was bright and dewy and the sky without a cloud .
‘ My late governor made a mess of it , ’ said <NAME> .
It is your house , and you are master at your own table .
There was no mute sign of a woman in the room .
It was almost dark when they arrived at the <NAME> .
It would be the life I am fitted for .
Please to ring there for <NAME> ’ s nurse .
‘ Mister be blowed ! ’ cried <NAME> , yielding to his honest indignation .
`` I am well enough , '' says <NAME> .
They laugh at me , but don ’ t harm me in it .
He had had a fright. ’ ‘ Ay , ay !
`` Yes , if you please , my Lady .
The greater part of my slaves are much attached to me .
Bewitching Mrs. Copperfield ’ s encumbrance ? ’ cried the gentleman .
Perhaps you ’ ll introduce me here , <NAME> Crummles. ’ ‘ Mr .
‘ “ My dear preserver ! ” exclaimed the young lady .
The children in the lanes here say he has sold himself to the devil .
What complaint ? ’ ‘ A complaint of you , ’ said <NAME> .
You ’ ll say we are a humbug .
When it was finished he came to me looking very busy and very attentive .
It was very unfortunate. ’ It was nothing , he returned .
<NAME> , we must scrunch or be scrunched .
‘ What ’ s that to you ? ’ retorted Mrs. Squeers .
Why does she say that ?
<NAME> <NAME> was stupefied with astonishment .
But now came the most remarkable part of the dream .
He finds it as he speaks , `` <NAME> . ''
I see , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ I am rejoiced , I am sure , ’ says Mr Carker .
`` I never know 'd nothink about 'em , '' says Jo .
‘ Forced to send for me .
‘ “ Because it gives me pain all over , ” replied the figure .
Thank you , and God bless you , in her name ! ''
‘ I hoped to have seen him on the green to-night .
<NAME> had only shrunk and shivered .
“ You are a noble heart .
‘ Certainly , my dear <NAME> , ’ faltered my mother , meekly .
At last <NAME> came .
And a <NAME> ; I may as well take that , too .
`` Do n't look quite healthy though . ''
the old-fashioned little soul ! ’ cried <NAME> , in a whisper .
‘ I ’ m much obliged to you .
He therefore resumed his brisk pace , and advanced , staring straight before him .
‘ Do you think he will come round ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
`` However , '' said <NAME> , `` to return to our gossip .
They changed clothes at the cottage . ''
But all was in vain .
If not , pray do not seek to turn us from our purpose .
She ’ s so faithful and tender-hearted !
`` How old ARE you , Phil ? ''
For some little time the jurymen hang about the <NAME> 's <NAME> colloquially .
I was ready to go. ” They were both silent .
What world does a dead man belong to ?
I laid my hand softly on her shoulder .
Remember , I was with my father .
I know you have intended to make me happy .
`` Do n't be agitated , my dear .
<NAME> ’ t be angry with me .
Then I took up my little portmanteau and walked out .
‘ Ah , by Jove he has ! ’ replied <NAME> .
The outsides did as outsides always do .
‘ Did the old man say it , or did little Nell say it ?
Thus reminded of it , I broke the seal and read as follows .
It ’ s allowanced here , you know .
Let them all lean upon him .
<NAME> dear , did you kiss Ma and <NAME> ?
She would be presented at court , of course .
It is his humour : nothing more .
How should I know it ? ''
Mr <NAME> was just come home .
‘ It was a journey , a difficult and dangerous journey .
Our poor devoted <NAME> was deaf and blind to all .
‘ I take that liberty , ’ he answered .
The fault is not yours .
She would be glad to see her bird , he knew .
‘ <NAME> and myself were present .
`` Of course I do , '' cried <NAME> .
He 'll have drunk himself blind by that time .
‘ I should have known it .
You saw nothing in <NAME> but what was severely workful .
There was a stool , and table , and a straw bed .
And you ’ ll try to let us be a comfort to you ?
Or that <NAME> invited him to dinner that day .
Should <NAME> come to life ?
‘ Yes sir , yes ! ’ cried <NAME> from the coach window .
'Anything new up in town , <NAME> ? '
Mr <NAME> frowned , and looked anything but pleased .
Utterly confounded , <NAME> awhile stands looking at the knocker .
I think we may safely put it down at that .
‘ Well , <NAME> , ’ said the trembling old lady .
And here again , I had great misgivings .
‘ Look at the light of day .
‘ And I think , ’ said <NAME> , in conclusion .
His great power seemed to be his power of indiscriminate admiration .
It had held out for this , and it departed when this was done .
The strength of a giant comes upon me when I think of it .
I had thought beforehand that I knew its purport , and I did .
You ’ re kindly welcome , sir ! ’ ‘ Mr .
So I went outside , and sat down in the shade in a corner .
Each was silent for some time , leaving it to the other to begin .
Oh Lord ! ’ And then rolled and spluttered more than ever .
There is a gentleman with him .
'And to take that ugly thing away from her ? '
Indeed I am sure it must .
`` He was in arrears with his rent , it seems .
I am none of your strollers or vagabonds .
‘ When you ’ re requested to call , sir , and not before .
‘ Men are such deceivers , ’ she softly whispered .
It was in vain to take refuge in gruffness of speech .
<NAME> in the course of a week or two .
I will not go away from here in anybody ’ s debt .
I have heard from <NAME> that you still preserve that bottle .
The short-lived delusion begins to fade .
`` You found that out long ago . ''
How you do go on !
( Oh dear me , dear me ! )
said the gentleman , who seemed fully prepared for this answer .
But , <NAME> had sanctified it , and I had believed in it .
Your preparations have been completed for some days , to return to <NAME> .
'Your reason in your own words .
‘ But I don ’ t mind telling you how .
<NAME> and wife I know , from this playfulness .
Another cheer , far more vehement .
<NAME> indeed is what I ’ ve done .
I am sure you do. ’ She answered not a word .
We have nothing to conceal .
I will come at four o ’ clock .
The second day was sultry and oppressive .
‘ No , no , ’ interrupted <NAME> , ‘ the fault was mine .
Analytical Chemist again bends and whispers .
B. keeps him to the mark .
He was not of this part of the country .
You don ’ t mean chimneys ? ’ said my aunt .
My mother bent her head , and begged her to walk in .
What was the nameless shadow which again in that one instant had passed ?
Then I begin to comprehend that the state-room is standing on its head .
And yours will be there !
It was no good sending any letter there .
Into this narrow , grave-like place , men are brought out to die .
‘ Mr <NAME> , ain ’ t it ? ’ said <NAME> .
`` It a n't done it much good if it is .
It was evident that he had a very large castle in hand .
But I have no such thing .
I had never worn a black frock , that I could recollect .
'No , ' replied <NAME> , 'not very .
A scaly crumbling vegetation sprouted round the window-sills .
Were you ? ’ said <NAME> , shutting up one eye .
You go home and turn in .
There was neither door nor seat to the coach .
And he meant it too .
Oh , it ’ s a rare place !
Now , does he do too much ? ” “ I think not .
‘ <NAME> , I remember what you come for .
<NAME> <NAME> looked on , in mute astonishment .
far worse ! ’ ‘ Of what then ? ’ demanded <NAME> .
Sikes and the Jew were talking , but they paused to listen .
Is this no injury ? ’ <NAME> tried to soothe her ; again ineffectually .
<NAME> , I believe ? ’ <NAME> inclined her head .
Pretend to look out of window—Mrs .
But still she found them all too far advanced to learn from .
Thee ’ st gotten him at thy loodgin ’ ?
I may have sent you there on purpose . ''
This young fellow , <NAME> , stood in need of some instruction .
‘ Careering and prancing about with a Pauper ! ’ ( air-gun again ) .
`` That is scarcely fair , sir , scarcely fair ! ''
Mr <NAME> issued invitations for a <NAME> dinner .
Then says <NAME> , <NAME> , if he could but prove so !
`` I think I do , <NAME> , though not by name . ''
A slight bustle in the court , recalled him to himself .
Do you understand ? ’ ‘ Too well , sir , ’ he replied .
The brothers interchanged looks , and coughed some half-dozen times without speaking .
Here 's more of this hateful soot hanging about , '' says he .
‘ Is THAT all ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , sir .
'Then do n't forget it another time . '
And that is our street in <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> ’ , old friend , ’ said <NAME> .
We are not accordant ; we differ on that occasion .
'It is gone , you see . '
I had nothing to say .
You are forming an excellent habit of arranging your thoughts clearly .
He decided , however , in favour of stratagem .
‘ I am in the oil and colour way .
‘ He ’ s gone too , ’ replied <NAME> .
‘ I know you never will , ’ returned the lady .
What should I have done as soon as I was hard and fast here ?
<NAME> , what superiority of intellectual strength !
I ’ m very fond of peaches .
‘ Wy , <NAME> , my dear ! ’ said <NAME> .
`` I envy you your power of doing what you do .
<NAME> give it to me .
I feel , I know it .
cried the relict of <NAME> deceased .
cried Mrs. Maylie , rising hastily , and bending over her .
‘ <NAME> , not make a show of her .
`` I wish we were all dead .
One brings another , you see ; that 's the way of it .
Only say where you ’ ll have it .
A poor boy , <NAME> said .
You buy the young woman a boat .
If this will not do either , die !
End of the <NAME> EBook of <NAME> , by <NAME>
He seemed to save up his Misers as they had saved up their money .
You must accept all consequences of that hypothesis .
Day after day uttered this speech ; night after night showed him this knowledge .
Sometimes it lay in the bottom of his boat .
<NAME> new wooden legs now , and drinks nothing but water and weak tea .
‘ I would talk of her as an old woman .
It is indeed , ’ said Mrs. Nickleby .
‘ What name ? ’ inquired the lady .
There live here , let us suppose , an uncle and nephew .
But virtually the same , virtually the same .
My dear brother , you will break my heart .
‘ <NAME> , man , there ’ s no occasion to say that .
<NAME> makes perfect , you know .
Will you begone ? ’ ‘ Do forgive me .
I could not support being what is called <NAME> , sir .
There ’ s a golden ball at your feet .
It was not adapted to the cheek of the young person .
And where do we go next , <NAME> ? ''
Let me speak to you !
'You feel as a mother , Mrs .
`` I have a great secret to tell you ! ''
'My true and faithful pledge . '
He sits there to administer the system .
I thought I ’ d mention it .
Where has there been a murder ? ''
( You thee how it ith , <NAME> ! )
To which she answered in the affirmative .
You did , I suppose , and understood it ? ’ pursued Mr Dombey .
If you are , why haven ’ t you mentioned it to me ?
‘ No , surely not ? ’ returned the other .
Not of her alone , but of him too , poor fellow . ''
‘ Here is no number , ’ said <NAME> looking over it .
The idle people improved the occasion in a similar manner .
‘ It is a very large sum , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> , sir , take care of <NAME> at half-past five .
Why , I say so , openly .
<NAME> knave and half fool , and detected in both characters ?
You generally know things of that sort. ’ ‘ She is better , <NAME> .
She was taught too late , and taught all wrong .
I do not dispute your hypothetical case .
'Nothing , ma'am , nothing , ' replied a man 's voice .
My own abode is lodgings at <NAME> , <NAME> .
What can it be worth to me ?
' I must see the lady . '
cried the desperate ruffian , throwing up the sash and menacing the crowd .
As they turn towards the hall-door , <NAME> addresses <NAME> for the first time .
<NAME> , I really do feel hopeful of bracing exercise and wholesome fatigue .
Open the blinds. ” It was done .
`` Oh , dear me , he is ill ! ''
<NAME> and <NAME> enter the same carriage .
Just let me ask a question .
As to <NAME> , he gets what he can and goes to the office .
Let him make a tool of me afresh and again ?
Such spirits as he had in the outset , <NAME> soon lost of course .
So she tried to do .
‘ Here just before us , you see , ’ said Mr Inspector .
‘ -- And his romantic manner of acquiring it , make him conspicuous .
Sheds coat in the spring ; in marshy countries , sheds hoofs , too .
I feel myself as far above suspicion as <NAME> 's wife . ''
`` And disgrace , grandmother -- '' says <NAME> .
This young lady is that young lady . ''
Come along with her , will you be so kind ? ’ said <NAME> .
Why does no one answer ?
The time was at hand when the coach was to call for us .
<NAME> restrains the woman , merely by a quiet gesture , but effectually .
I may have my opinion of you .
Articled clerks have been in the habit of fleshing their legal wit upon it .
Such an understanding is nowhere expressed .
I should like to make you something. ’ ‘ Much obliged .
'My friend wants somebody who would do that well , very much . '
I felt the madness rising within me .
I ’ m in the humour now .
I want to know who 's got 'em .
`` Not of <NAME> and <NAME> ? ''
‘ You were always a pet and favourite of mine .
‘ <NAME> , what is this ? ’ said <NAME> , bending over him .
As wet as a sop .
`` But not always , dear <NAME> ? ''
‘ It was Alfred who sent me to you , Mr Boffin .
She died soon after daybreak .
and `` Who gave you that name ? ''
cries <NAME> , scrambling to his feet .
‘ I do , ’ said Mrs. Crummles .
<NAME> ( that 's her brother ) is an accountant and agent .
‘ I am extremely sorry to hear this , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
But he had two consolations at the close of the performance .
He then made bold to inquire what business brought him there .
‘ You must speak for yourself .
Here all the people were so much changed , that he scarcely knew them .
The word was appropriate to the moment .
From him I looked back to the slight gentle figure of the child .
But the sun shone brightly , and the birds sang on .
'Did you want a coffin , sir ? '
Perhaps you have forgotten. ’ ‘ Oh no , ’ replied <NAME> , hurriedly .
“ The time has not gone by .
What would I not have given to be one of them !
Can you hear ? ’ ‘ Ye-ye-ye-yes , <NAME> ! ’ I sobbed .
I don ’ t think I am .
Happiness or misery was now the question .
A good night for business this . '
and how smart she is again !
‘ Your mother , sir , ’ replied <NAME> , motioning towards her .
`` His wealth is of no use to him .
And would you please to shut the street door first ?
‘ Faults ! ’ she cried , bursting into passionate tears .
I am not the principal here .
You know it is , <NAME> .
‘ You like town , ’ says <NAME> .
'At least it ca n't be a put-up job , as we expected . '
‘ <NAME> thee down , <NAME> , sit thee down and look on .
I have lived in the house ever since. ’ She was gone .
There was a still greater obstacle in <NAME> 's youth and childishness .
what a vale of tears we live in .
The day is then just breaking .
‘ What do you call the doer of that deed , sir ?
After a few cheerful words , <NAME> left us together .
What revenge ? ” “ <NAME> , <NAME> ! ” said he .
He neither changes his dress before the journey nor talks of it afterwards .
‘ “ A genius , ” replied the figure .
This dreadful accusation comes upon her like a new torment at his lifeless hand .
It ’ s no use leading me to that , and there leaving me .
While <NAME> spoke in these words of her absent lord , her lord returned .
Who are not to be disturbed by ideas .
Has begged the servant to be particular not to mistake her name .
They are always in earnest .
So much the better , so much the better !
She trembled , and her eyes were dim .
`` Not of one of the greatest Chancery suits known ?
`` Do you remember me , <NAME> ? ''
Though I ain ’ t no scholar .
‘ Gay as ever , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ of course .
Who would I prefer for mistress of the ceremonies ?
`` I should think not , '' rejoins <NAME> .
`` So you may have , my dear , '' he returned .
It was opened by a young girl of thirteen or fourteen .
How many more of them ! ” exclaimed the man with the bloated face .
I was going to say , we really are going on worse than ever .
‘ I do forgive her , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
I tell you , my little reptiles , I am born to be served .
Now , Mr Riah , here is Mr Twemlow .
<NAME> <NAME> is quite well .
I always propose that toast to the company , and drink <NAME> to myself .
<NAME> yet , and the door stood open , inviting her to enter .
So , there ’ s a tame bird to kiss the little hand !
And ‘ Fact , fact , fact ! ’ repeated <NAME> .
They won ’ t like me , _they_ won ’ t .
He could have believed she had .
The <NAME> streets , the death-carts rumble , hollow and harsh .
‘ I observe that you have an attachment to low and common company .
Is she to come to work here for ever ?
'That 's what it means , ' said <NAME> .
It 's the best he had , and a fine one too .
‘ You were telling me , ’ she said , ‘ about your gardening .
For whom , knife and loaf in hand , she opens the street-door .
'My best hand was taken from me , yesterday morning . '
`` So I gave him notice , '' said Mrs. Blinder .
‘ Can not undertake to say , sir , really , ’ replied <NAME> .
My guardian patted me on the shoulder and seemed much amused .
‘ Why not , sir ? ’ demanded <NAME> .
‘ Your soul is too large for your body , ’ said <NAME> .
'Jump up , ' said the man .
<NAME> felt as if her heart would break when she saw them meet .
The other three sat up at the inn all night in great suspense .
‘ Why do you tremble ? ’ rejoined Alice , with an eager look .
`` No , no , my dear friend .
All this time <NAME> knitted on .
More than that , it was always the same , always the same .
‘ <NAME> ! ’ cried <NAME> , at this moment .
Let us get quit of it equally .
Put it outside the cloak .
‘ But what ’ s been the matter ? ’ said Mrs. <NAME> .
Not at the present moment .
I am ashamed of you .
'Is that what you expected to get from me ? '
come here ! ’ and looked at mine .
The <NAME> of the <NAME> 8 .
If they had known it , would they have saved her ?
If she comes again , send her here . ''
The lantern was still burning in the loft-window .
It made a stupendous uproar .
Oh , <NAME> , my love , the little thing !
‘ I dinnot know what they lads mightn ’ t do .
In Mrs. <NAME> , who every morning bathes in <NAME> for nothing ?
pooh ! ’ said <NAME> , ‘ don ’ t tell me .
I hope you ’ ll go soon !
It is what he always does .
The trooper looks at her with a troubled visage .
I have no time for them , no chance of them .
The <NAME> stood unnoticed , looking on with her lips very tightly set .
You say I am lucky .
Half a minute , Mr Boffin .
Need I say that this necessity had been foreseen by -- HEEP ?
Would you mind describing him to me ? ''
What do you make of that , <NAME> ? ''
The longing of her heart resolved her , and she thought she would .
I thank you better with these tears than any words .
`` Why , you do n't mean it ! ''
I can afford to be liberal .
Because , in my lower nature I am more worldly and less delicate .
Now , the sun was full up , and movement began in the village .
I ’ ve been your slave long enough .
‘ Wery glad to hear it , ’ said <NAME> .
This sausage in a vine leaf is for <NAME> .
I am certain that what I say is right .
I shook my head , wondering even what it was .
A man with keys appears , to show us round .
By you , mind -- you , my dear !
demanded the gentleman in a tremulous voice .
‘ I ’ ll bring this young man to book .
‘ You know my general history .
And what does she care !
`` And they have shot him . ''
He always carries with him this coil of rope .
No , he said , over for good .
<NAME> ensues upon the proclamation .
He walked up to one of the presses .
A very pretty little purse .
Would you like to have a look at <NAME> ?
And I say now , that I think ill of <NAME> .
<NAME> Winkle eagerly watched his opportunity : it was not long wanting .
It is a ponderous chain ! ''
He returned as hurriedly as he had gone , with the bottle still empty .
Of course I ask for no secrecy at <NAME> . ''
said the officer ; 'he 's in the gig , a-minding the prad .
He had his laugh out .
They were right ; they had no business to do anything else .
'Surely there is no danger of anything so dreadful ? '
When he appeared , the dealers in those wares fell off respectfully .
‘ I detest this mongrel time , neither day nor night .
<NAME> <NAME> could not undertake to propound any theory about it .
I can ’ t submit ; I must govern .
It was twilight when we reached the cottage .
He was unrobed , and was none the better for it in appearance .
‘ Well , shake hands , won ’ t you ? ’ said <NAME> .
But this is sure ; he does not think that he has lost her .
`` You have an unusual amount of correspondence this morning ? ''
‘ You have not spoken to me by my right name yet .
‘ Tis a quiet place , and they keep away .
Where are they going to ? —Come from !
<NAME> remained but the appeal to his old friend <NAME> .
In short , the wily old <NAME> had the boy in his toils .
'That 's right , that 's right , ' said <NAME> .
You tried it in the <NAME> .
If that 's responsibility , I am responsible . ''
<NAME> says he knows a man who married a bathing-woman , and bolted .
I know the signs , my dear .
Turning towards the door , he now caught sight of us .
She has a letter somewhere that I particularly want .
Suicides are rare among these prisoners : are almost , indeed , unknown .
Does he keep them yet ?
<NAME> went last , and closed the door .
But commit myself to a solitary female statement , no , <NAME> !
The reserved <NAME> took up Mr Meagles in his last remark .
While these affairs were in abeyance , our visit to <NAME> 's was postponed .
Do n't put him out , sir .
`` Not a morsel of it . ''
He has written the letter B , and there stopped .
The sun is shining down , upon the golden letters of the ten commandments .
It was more rounded and flowing .
It ’ s in the way of school ! ’ cried <NAME> .
She ses to me she ses 'can you show me all them places ? '
‘ I can do anything with the old lady .
I meant it as a pleasant surprise for the little mistress of <NAME> . ''
`` Ask me who I was . ''
I described my precious commodity , and fixed my price .
It was not for his friend to abate that confidence .
You have her fast , and you are not to let her go .
‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ I mean it .
You come o ’ purpose to take the journey .
‘ Anything Cathedraly , now , ’ <NAME> suggested .
What a stupid thing she must be !
But with such a face as I never saw .
<NAME> <NAME> ! ’ cried <NAME> , rubbing his hands .
Will you mind the office one minute , while I run up-stairs ?
<NAME> , here is a family name compromised .
<NAME> was the serenest of the party .
‘ Wind and water sets in that direction , you see .
What was that you told me before we left the old house ?
I perceive you have acquaintance with another lady .
‘ Let me have a word with you , sir , ’ said <NAME> .
We are so dreadfully artificial. ’ We were , indeed .
We shall return home this day week . ''
‘ I must have time to think of it .
Or haven ’ t you ? ’ demanded Mr Boffin , rather angry .
‘ He will be glad to have you on my recommendation .
‘ You must excuse my telling you .
Within Mr Riderhood ’ s knowledge all daggers were as one .
‘ I know what I am .
‘ I feel no tenderness towards you ; that you know .
“ What is that ? ” she cried , all at once .
‘ I was almost going to say , is it good feeling ?
<NAME> has its occasional vagaries ( what school has not ?
How selfish I must have been not to have thought of this before !
“ <NAME> hard , <NAME> , ” he says .
Shall I repeat it ? ’ ‘ If you please , ’ said <NAME> .
What if I do love and reverence this good and lovely creature .
It was not so much a reproach as an irresistible thinking aloud .
And that the money is made , or making . ''
Did she presume on my birth , or on my hire ?
So was not <NAME> , for he had grown jealous of <NAME> .
You know the young lady 's father , <NAME> ? ” said <NAME> .
‘ Gone out to dinner , ’ said <NAME> .
I should n't have been fit for it .
‘ No , Mr Wegg , ’ said <NAME> .
Something comes into my head .
<NAME> above bless you , and bless all !
'Send her here , ' said <NAME> , pouring out a glass of liquor .
‘ I never wear gloves , ’ it was his custom to say .
They parted , heavy and sorrowful .
‘ Good fortune and happiness go with you ! ’ said the poor schoolmaster .
Were you not talking yonder ? ’ ‘ Yes , ’ the child rejoined .
‘ That I could speak with you , and not know you !
‘ No , sir , ’ she replied timidly .
I ’ ll tell you what it is .
‘ You will not forget my mother ?
`` And how did little Tim behave ? ''
These things are a question of beefsteaks and porter .
On a twig , making up his mind to hop !
Let me read the first : “ <NAME> , twelve o ’ clock .
‘ Yes she has ! ’ ‘ All night ? ’ cried <NAME> .
‘ You may well smart , young man ! ’ exclaimed <NAME> .
He thought this , and forbore to say another word .
‘ Bless us ! ’ said Mrs. Cluppins .
It was a thing to look at .
She began once more to think that he was not ill-looking after all .
Let me hear what they say .
The building is handsome ; and is remarkable for a spacious and elegant staircase .
‘ Peggotty ! ’ I cried to her .
‘ What a complication of misery !
‘ Ay , ay , ’ cried the neighbour .
`` <NAME> , '' returns <NAME> , `` will never desert .
As they go upstairs , <NAME> lifts his eyebrows inquiringly and looks at <NAME> .
The weakness is past and over sir , and moral strength returns .
It 's all right as far as the boy 's concerned .
to be sure , ' replied the doctor , 'so there is .
Such a calamity never happened to me before .
'If it had n't been for the girl !
`` O my child , my child !
The patient shook her head , and stretched out her hand towards the child .
You must see them all .
( Your birth , you know ; you must not forget your birth . )
Very good. ’ ‘ Very bad , ’ murmured the Secretary .
‘ <NAME> is full of lodgers just at present !
I can not use the expression that he looked old .
Let them do it at some other man .
‘ There is no time like the present , <NAME> , ’ he returned .
But I must decidedly beg to be excused from anything of that sort . ''
The public- house had a fascination for him which he could not resist .
Never on seeing me , no matter when , no matter where .
They are staying with us .
The stable-yard exhibited unequivocal symptoms of the glory and strength of the <NAME> .
<NAME> and Tupman he had already held to bail .
‘ I am as bad as you , love. ’ ‘ Ah !
wicked guesser ! ’ replied <NAME> , shaking her head .
Do you hear ? ’ ‘ Yes , Quilp. ’ ‘ Go then .
Do n't speak loud , my dear .
I have come back to ask forgiveness on my knees .
‘ I did not , ’ said I .
<NAME> was never yet billeted upon a household more unlike him .
I 've a brother in service , AND a brother-in-law .
He has shown neither patience nor impatience , nor attention nor abstraction .
whispered <NAME> , drawing my arm tighter through her own .
There are several grades of lawyers ’ clerks .
But that 's not what I mean .
`` Does he still say the same of <NAME> ? ''
“ What ! ” said <NAME> , looking out of bed for a boot .
Mr <NAME> smiled assent again .
You and me can keep a secret together , eh ?
'The prerogative of a man is to command . '
If you ai n't , sell 'em . '
After many attempts , I wrote , ‘ My dear Agnes .
You remember what I said to you about sleeping dogs and missing ones .
They were better off in their youth than I was , however .
<NAME> <NAME> says nothing , looks nothing .
‘ Ah ! ’ returned his mother , ‘ what style of nose ?
All that day , again , the search went on .
A banker , whom we would call A .
His only pride is in his daughter and her husband .
We shall mount to a hundred soon .
“ I forgot them in the surprise of your visit , ” explained <NAME> .
You haven ’ t any right to call a poor cove names , <NAME> .
I never saw such a world .
As <NAME> dropped into hers , she bestowed the old look upon him .
You are deceived by the representations of the emancipationists .
My poor <NAME> , have they both designs against you , either way ?
I am heated and excited , sir , I know I am .
‘ It ’ s only one of our young ladies and her mother .
The child answered her bravely , 'Yes ! '
‘ Send the landlord , ’ said the stranger .
That figure in the room .
Sloppy they left behind , relieving his overcharged breast with a paroxysm of mangling .
<NAME> ! ’ vibrated in his ears .
But it ’ s a queer world ; oh !
`` She supposes we have family affairs to speak about , I dare say .
‘ I shall save by it , you know .
The <NAME> shook his head .
'How do you feel to-night , <NAME> ? '
<NAME> accompanied us at night to the scene of our morning expedition .
Hope I thee you well , mith .
“ Forgive me if I notice that you are affected .
Three times five ; will that do ?
`` Sit down , my dear , '' said <NAME> .
May that be truly said of us , and all of us !
In his condemnation he is all ferocity .
She yearned towards him , and yet shrunk from his approach .
`` Where did you say the wind was , <NAME> ? ''
He was never tired of watching .
<NAME> and freely , you see there is no anger in <NAME> .
The telling fact that <NAME> is related to <NAME> , must be let off .
I am prepared to defray all charges .
What was it ? ’ ‘ You wanted to tell me something , <NAME> .
‘ “ Since yesterday night , ” she replied .
I know that it will involve many privations and inconveniences .
‘ No , you did not , brother .
All this I see as I sit in the little stern-gallery mentioned just now .
`` Do they look like that sort of thing ? ''
You ca n't think what good companions they make .
‘ “ He ’ s a tall man , ” said <NAME> .
Never collect anything but advertisements relative to next of kin .
`` I am sure it is .
`` Is it safe now , dearest mother ? ''
When he grew weary , I grew weary .
I then asked <NAME> whether he had thought of any more congenial pursuit .
`` Will you see my mother safe there in a coach , Mrs. Bagnet ?
For these sufficient reasons I resolve to fight the butcher .
For this he thanks her kindly .
He looks into the first of them : not there .
My dear girl was the great consideration that made me bold .
A ring of a very responsible appearance .
‘ This is a long call .
The baker is ill , and so is the pastry-cook .
At this , he laughed again , and they both laughed .
What he heard need not be repeated here .
I have mentioned my illness .
The <NAME> 9. little Mother 10 .
I never knowd what it wos all about . ''
A very odd-looking old fellow altogether .
‘ Then I tell you what , <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> , I have but one chance left to soften you .
There was a disparity in their ages -- some twelve years .
If I spoke a gentle word in your hearing , may it deafen you !
said <NAME> , shrugging his shoulders .
<NAME> to see but streets , streets , streets .
It ought not to be , perhaps , but what can I do ?
These , in some astonishment , I also read ; and he laughed again .
There is no stone at her grave ’ s head .
These people hated me with the hatred of cupidity and disappointment .
I know you would not .
I always carry ‘ em about .
I believe that <NAME> ’ s management of children is quite astonishing .
`` But we are plotting nothing against him , <NAME> . ''
It was another half-hour before I drew near to the kiln .
No , ’ screamed both the young ladies .
I would n't be you for something !
'It is a pity , for I 'm in the humour too . '
He shut it up , rather quickly .
You remember our friend <NAME> , <NAME> ? ''
She listened at her own .
We did not come down again .
said <NAME> , passing his hand across his forehead .
‘ Never heard of such a thing. ’ ‘ But I did .
Mr <NAME> made a similar reply , and <NAME> explained his reason for inquiring .
‘ <NAME> indeed , ’ replied <NAME> .
‘ His usage made a Devil of me .
‘ For good , ’ said Mr Boffin .
They found her there , at last , and took her home .
So did <NAME> , at my side .
The schoolmaster stated on what terms .
I don ’ t forget that I am <NAME> of <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> addressed the stranger .
But it was not vanity ; it was only harmless delight in my admiration .
‘ Stay ! ’ cried <NAME> , spreading out the handbill on his desk .
‘ I was engaged in receiving them .
But there was nobody abroad .
Why would it never do ?
It is shame to see him .
Slowly , on <NAME> ’ s part .
I 'll put 'em on the outside of the row .
Where is the child you have here , my good fellow .
They spoke to me from afar off .
<NAME> <NAME> 's gravity becomes yet more profound .
‘ Good heavens , <NAME> , do you see ? ’ exclaimed <NAME> .
' I am very sorry if I have disturbed you , sir . '
It would be no better , if I stopped my most unwilling hand .
I will give her her due , and not deny it .
Mrs Veneering , during the same eventful hours , is not idle .
repeated the old man in a whisper .
I won ’ t disturb you while they ’ re here , you know .
‘ Let me think ’ quoth he .
<NAME> ’ s public position , I think you know .
Here is Mr <NAME> ’ s letter , Edith. ’ ‘ Thank you .
It an ’ t above ten minutes out of your way .
The appellation was not flattering , but not unmerited .
Similarly , I must have my smoke .
I take my leave. ’ His leave he took accordingly , in dudgeon .
`` Five dozen rifle and a dozen pistol .
I tell you it won ’ t do with him .
But he is still alive .
I have pinted out the way .
To tame a certain severity apparent on the part of Mrs. <NAME> .
I repeated every word of the letter twice over .
I tell you what , <NAME> , once for all .
‘ Go out a bit , and let me tell him what I must .
It came about in the simplest manner .
We had quite forgotten all such petty restrictions as chapters , we solemnly declare .
I shouldn ’ t be surprised if that was it .
Let him turn that over in his memory , and make sure of it .
Do you hear me , you fairy spirit ?
‘ Is that you , Smike ? ’ cried <NAME> .
They seemed so like the rats he had seen outside .
'Oh , my wig , my wig ! '
Suppose this way , that way , the other way .
<NAME> , I only want one word from you .
Why , you doen ’ t mean to ask me that !
'What is it , <NAME> , dear ? '
‘ Let us go away from here .
I did it over and over again .
‘ Very , ’ said <NAME> , opening the door .
'T is MY case , sir , I assure you . ''
This caused me to remain until all the company were gone .
’ <NAME> not wi ’ _them_ ’ t commences .
Speak out or be choked !
The <NAME> rarely answered to the actual tread of <NAME> .
‘ “ What are we to do ? ” inquired the man of business .
I was flying too high , and should never get on , so .
‘ I hope so , ’ returned her father .
<NAME> proceeds to a description of them , which has been anticipated by <NAME> .
Mrs. Rouncewell is constrained to admit that he is in the house .
<NAME> this way , <NAME> ; my dear , will you follow me ?
‘ Oh do , my dear boy !
'If you do it well , a pound , my dear .
“ He remains up there in his iron cage some days .
I don ’ t make much , but I don ’ t spend much .
He now cried out : ‘ <NAME> !
‘ Now , do you want any more ? ’ said <NAME> .
Perhaps you 'll set your mind upon THAT next . ''
This , however , never came to pass .
`` The message was for the attendant . ''
asks <NAME> , pausing with a frown in stroking the recollection of his moustache .
None of you need stir .
<NAME> at having the honour of being admitted to see you .
‘ I am the <NAME> , ’ said the man .
‘ There are his boots , Mr <NAME> ! ’ said <NAME> .
It was Saturday morning , and I went straight to the <NAME> .
‘ We need detain you no longer , I think , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Indeed I think he has too. ’ ‘ Oh !
I can not tell you to-night , if I ever can tell you .
The vivid imagination of <NAME> presented the scene before him in too strong colours .
Use yourself to ’ ousekeeping a bit .
I know what I took her for , as well as you do .
A wisitation , sir , is the lot of mortality .
Oh-h-h you naughty , wicked creature !
`` My father expected a judgment , '' said <NAME> .
It was past eleven o'clock , and the door was closed .
She was absolutely without pity .
He 'd have all he could get .
‘ This is indeed a pleasure I did not expect .
<NAME> <NAME> had married Mrs. Corney , and was master of the workhouse .
He steals away to look at her , in her sleep .
No other attendant than the housekeeper appeared .
cries <NAME> with her little withered scream .
<NAME> of advancing voices , sound of advancing steps .
‘ “ Hark ! ” cried the young lady , starting .
He won ’ t disturb me at all .
Mrs. Bagnet , quite charmed , hopes <NAME> has a family of his own .
It is a weakness , and soon passes .
I gave him a little time to recover .
`` The business of the day requires a great deal of thought .
I have taken with fear and trembling to authorship .
Little <NAME> was deeply anxious that he should lie down to compose himself .
They ought to be prosecuted and fined , them Mails .
That there are eyes in its own map , hanging on the wall .
His only hope of restoration !
<NAME> <NAME> foamed with rage and excitement .
‘ Hoi -- hoi -- hoi ! ’ was the only reply .
Besides , have I no confidence in myself ?
‘ No , really I never did , ’ replied Nicholas .
<NAME> was depicted on every countenance .
<NAME> o ’ that ! ’ Job Trotter looked amazed .
It has always a sweet sound to me .
He did not know why .
The very children scarcely noticed him .
Why , what a dull blockhead this fellow must be !
‘ All is shut up , <NAME> ? ’ said Mrs. Sparsit .
So does Wickam. ’ ‘ Who is <NAME> ? ’ asked <NAME> .
He had had a trying day , and wanted a little brightening .
‘ I have not heard that anything is the matter , ’ returned <NAME> .
I want to know what is to be done .
But main roads stretch a long , long way .
I should wery much like to see that system in haction , <NAME> .
Loose gave the first blow .
By-and-bye , they went into the house .
‘ What are you waiting for ? ’ said <NAME> .
dear me ! -- and he died ! ’ ‘ Hey !
They are not my spies , not my rascals. ’ ‘ Hark !
He has been took , miss ! ''
Mr Dombey alone remained unmoved .
‘ Hollo ! ’ cried <NAME> , twitching one end of the dragged veil .
From the mistress of the house , the visitor glanced to the house itself .
`` Just so , '' said <NAME> .
He stood still : she too : the table and chair between them .
The place had no other adherents .
Manifold are the cares of wealth and state .
'Well ; and what 's come of it ? '
She grew pale and thin , even within a few days .
‘ <NAME> ’ t put it upon <NAME> , sir .
journeys are very perilous -- especially outside the coach .
‘ Quite true , my dear <NAME> !
Either you know it , or you do n't know it .
`` We are all sure of that , '' said I .
But don ’ t you comprehend her on any account .
I rose ( for I had been sitting down ) .
I dust n't , '' says Jo , relapsing into the profile state .
This is a serious matter for both of you .
This is the triumph I was to have , is it ?
Yes to the first question , and Certainly Not to the second .
Let us make haste in , ’ cried <NAME> .
<NAME> sets it a-going -- music and all .
She had what they called an amiable temper , an affectionate temper .
‘ I have got a chariot-cab waiting on purpose , ’ replied the clerk .
She really is a marvel .
Oh , too late to know it now , too late , too late .
Containing the <NAME> of the <NAME> ’ s Disaster 11 .
They all stood still , and gazed upon each other .
`` How do you know that ?
This abandonment of the second topic threw him on the third .
I have n't a word to spare .
<NAME> me. ’ ‘ Matter , you little Mole , ’ said <NAME> .
Twice ; it was not the schoolmaster , <NAME> .
No glimpse of daylight was to be seen in it .
But , why not , why not ?
Now does <NAME> become worse , restless , uneasy , and in great pain .
'But not mine , ' said the Jew , submissively .
‘ I am outraged and insulted by it .
But the life I lead , <NAME> , is not conducive to health .
He looked from one to another in silence .
<NAME> ’ t you remember who first made us friends , <NAME> ?
And now he did look at <NAME> , and with an evil eye .
As to having been weak , you must begin to be strong .
says <NAME> , but not appearing to see quite distinctly .
Her first act was to shut them .
It lies in the smallest compass , however .
Mr <NAME> had been to <NAME> to pass the day .
I kept it down ; and no one knew I was a madman yet .
`` I hope you forgive me now . ''
He sat down beside her , with a glance at her face .
‘ We mustn ’ t use it carelessly , <NAME> .
in the name of <NAME> ! '
That she was of a fine family , <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> says so , too , ’ said <NAME> , pleased .
That was the only answer he received .
‘ Oh how glad I am you have not ! ’ exclaimed <NAME> .
“ <NAME> spoke hardy , but he was always a coward .
The horses stopped at the stable-gate .
He will want for nothing .
‘ I can ’ t imagine , ’ replied <NAME> .
I am astonished at it , sir .
<NAME> touchingly appealed to <NAME> .
Then lay on hot water , and call it tea .
And yet look here -- and look here !
'He 'd have been in the way . '
‘ Oh , no , no ! ’ cried <NAME> .
“ 'She is my sister , <NAME> .
I know what passed. ’ ‘ You do ?
So take this in confidence .
Not without some , I hope , on his or hers .
‘ Who is it ? ’ said the woman .
Yes , of both of you , '' said <NAME> kindly .
'No , sir , <NAME> , <NAME> . '
`` Am I that man who lay upon the bed ? ''
Seventeen people were made defendants to that simple suit !
I knew it quite as well as I know it now .
All the world and his wife and daughter leave cards .
Will that do , or is it too genteel ?
What think you of them now !
‘ Against the rules , ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> at his face ; ai n't it written there ?
‘ Yes , I does , young bantam , ’ replied the cobbler .
Did you ever hear of <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Another miser ?
<NAME> <NAME> was slow in coming to the plants , this morning .
‘ I should be even that , if I met him about here .
That Mrs Dombey must have been happy .
The old <NAME> biled ‘ em , she did .
I hope you may not mistake me .
In plain uncomplimentary <NAME> , so I am .
<NAME> for <NAME> up the stairs , sir .
‘ I tell you no , ’ cried the dwarf .
Still no one knew of this .
‘ I didn ’ t know what I did .
I don ’ t want to be Patronized .
Kicked on that occasion for cheating at dice ?
‘ Not at all , ’ returned the other .
There , I was roused by <NAME> 's hailing me .
`` I am much obliged to Mrs. Jellyby .
'You look like a corpse come to life again .
If the dead know what we do -- but you understand me .
‘ No doubt of it , <NAME> , ’ replied the landlord .
' I ca n't help it , ' said Mrs. Corney .
And get away from here as fast as you can . '
<NAME> quantities of flour form the chief item in the freight of these vessels .
There was no vestige of either carpet , curtain , or blind .
Others have only half thrown themselves into it .
My -- hum -- conscience would not allow it .
I -- I wish I was dead ! ''
Some of them are ready , some of them are not ready .
But why not say so ?
It was in the same degree to be avoided , in either aspect .
You need n't be afraid to order the pipe .
‘ <NAME> , they are friends of your son the prisoner .
‘ Much use that , ’ growled the fat gentleman .
We have been here , ’ said Mrs. Micawber , ‘ three days .
‘ You are too expensive , <NAME> , ’ said Mr Dombey .
I promise nothing , you know . ''
I want to speak to Agnes by herself .
said <NAME> , clasping his hands together , as he looked about him .
<NAME> another , young man , will you ? ’ ‘ “ Mrs .
I ’ ll tell you what , <NAME> .
Go tell her that I wish to see her .
‘ Pray be seated in my chair .
<NAME> was now the first to speak .
There is nothing I could desire more . ''
‘ Fine scholar , ’ said <NAME> , touching me with his finger .
<NAME> was about eight-and-forty years of age .
'He has n't as good a one as himself anywhere . '
' I am chained to my old life .
“ To me , women ! ” cried madame his wife .
`` It is a person 's name .
‘ About keeping house , for instance , ’ said <NAME> .
They parted without more conversation , merely interchanging a 'good-night . '
No charge made , except for rations .
‘ Ah ! ’ said the old gentleman quickly .
and Mrs. <NAME> said she supposed eighteenpence would neither make me nor break me .
When I went to bed , I cried .
Of blighting everything with his black mood as he was carried on and away .
You have made great improvements here already .
<NAME> <NAME> soon espied us and came to where we sat .
I won ’ t know your story professionally , for nothing , old lady !
Everybody hurried to do something towards facilitating the preparations .
He came back after a very short interval indeed .
So is <NAME> ; <NAME> is quite a lion .
They took it very well .
`` And this is brother , is it , my dears ? ''
And the landlord said so too .
Wants , at the core of so much that is good ! ''
The fruits of the earth have their growth in corruption .
‘ You were in a mighty hurry a minute ago .
If it had been a speculation , sir , it would have brought money .
All of which we wondered about , over and over again .
‘ It don ’ t matter , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ It must be coming to money .
I had better go into the house and die .
<NAME> was immediately taken away , and locked up in the coal-cellar .
She wo n't see it there . '
His tone relented , and he drew her arm through his .
Or something of that sort ?
Are you looking for any one ? ''
`` <NAME> here when the lady come ?
Not one word passed the lady ’ s lips .
‘ Dear me , how slow the gentleman is , ’ exclaimed Mrs. Rogers .
I am working up towards a partnership , you know. ” Poor fellow !
I had nothing to say against it .
'What did she die of , Work'us ? '
You are a humane woman , Mrs .
To these limits had his world shrunk .
you have seen her already , have you ? ’ His friend nodded .
‘ Not as I knows on , ’ replied the fat boy .
‘ I don ’ t know , sir , ’ replied the pretty housemaid .
“ Say that likewise , ” retorted <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> , the Jew in the <NAME> , has thousands of fancy-dresses .
'He might have become of use to me .
‘ Very much so , ’ the <NAME> assented .
'Is it for <NAME> , too , ma'am ? '
‘ There is a man in the passage now , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ I ’ ll never believe it of him .
I do n't know what I said , or even that I spoke .
said the <NAME> , glancing towards him .
‘ Let us understand each other ; I see we may safely do so .
‘ We all came back again , ’ replied Mrs. Micawber .
<NAME> looked at me , and laughed and nodded ‘ yes ’ .
Mostly they 're but a small lot to live by . ''
What would be the good of letting ‘ em ?
`` Because he IS the consideration .
But think of my dear son wrongfully accused . ''
‘ Here we have the beginning and the end .
That ’ s more to the purpose .
Have you heard if he was much hurt ? ’ <NAME> shook his head .
He set the others on .
<NAME> stooped to pick up the coat , which lay almost entangling his feet .
‘ Who ’ s that ? ’ she said , looking over her shoulder .
‘ What are you going to do about your lodgings ? ’ said <NAME> .
We all expressed our admiration .
And he could get that anywhere for nothing .
Now I ’ ll tell you , <NAME> .
‘ She has fainted , sir , ’ said <NAME> , darting eagerly forward .
My heart warms , gentlemen , at the sight of you .
said <NAME> , quite astonished , to <NAME> and me .
<NAME> workman , ai n't he , Oliver ? '
But it was too much to expect .
I have been treated and respected as a gentleman universally .
‘ What is the matter ? ’ cried <NAME> , bouncing into the room .
Therefore he sulkily supposes that the young man must come up into the library .
Do n't be too hard on a poor man .
<NAME> passages of Mr Merdle ’ s hand over his forehead .
I shouldn ’ t charge you nothing , being a friend .
At the sound of it , a thrill went through my frame .
“ 'She heard me , and ran in .
He was dead ; he had killed him , and had kept his oath .
‘ Mr Boffin , sir ? ’ he remarked .
‘ I can spare no more , ’ returned my aunt .
He never takes any pleasure , which is another mark of respectability .
‘ What should there be more than that !
You know how little I do claim , but I will go that length .
`` Yes , '' snarls <NAME> , `` my wife 's deaf . ''
How is it that you always know ? ’ ‘ How can I say ?
Her old bold life and habit instantly inspired her .
`` Why , great heaven , I was there last night ! ''
<NAME> <NAME> and Kimber there was a sickly sort of feeble-minded alliance .
I thank you , <NAME> . ''
You may leave the room , Mrs. Bedwin .
'The only friend I ever had , ' cried <NAME> , clinging to her .
I didn ’ t forget that old sore , trust me .
<NAME> <NAME> has recovered himself and stands up like a soldier .
A cove had better drown himself .
`` How dare you ask me if I knew him ? ''
here ’ s Mrs. Tope ! ’ cries the boy .
And now to unwind the last ring of the coil !
It must be a strange state to be like Jo !
<NAME> clerks go a good deal on the water .
It is not addressed to you . ''
I wish to call your attention to myself for a moment .
But , for all this , he worked at his castle in the intervals .
<NAME> : Most assuredly they can not be gone through for nothing .
‘ Hope I see YOU well , ma ’ am .
I can ’ t check off my happiness as it takes place .
<NAME> at me , father , kiss me , father !
She had put herself beyond all hope and beyond all help .
I have told your ladyship my object .
Be dutiful and affectionate towards me , and I ask no other return .
In short , I was not a favourite with <NAME> .
<NAME> ’ t say anything to me .
I was very much in earnest .
The history of every family we had on board was pretty much the same .
My prospects are very good , and I mean to follow them alone .
What am I worth to anyone ?
An expressive , one might say handsome , face .
She will be a lovely widow .
I give information , then , that he told me that he done it .
‘ You are no use to me at all .
They stopped before its low arched door .
What squeezes him into <NAME> ?
Standing hand-in-hand , they both looked down upon the solemn countenance .
What do you call me when I sometimes do ?
'It may be nothing ; it may be twenty pounds , ' replied <NAME> .
He manifestly chuckled over it for some time .
he brought me , ’ cried <NAME> .
We went home early in the evening .
The whole vista had no one in it now but himself .
What a disordered state you are in !
You won ’ t believe anything I say , of course .
‘ Depends upon the person ! ’ quoth Miss Wren , snapping him up .
Do n't let her throw it over my shoulders .
But I had better go home !
‘ How do you find yourself arter it ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , <NAME> .
<NAME> had shrunk out of my view .
It would not detain me , he had a coach in waiting .
‘ To resume once more , my dear .
Or if I was to deny— ”
Give me back my son , to work for these helpless children .
‘ That is of the greatest consequence .
Even make him better off , if you like .
`` Pray say no more about it , <NAME> , '' returned my guardian .
Well , I don ’ t know , sir .
Would Bishop favour him with half-a-dozen words ?
I would do anything for her , bear anything for her .
'Keep back the dog , <NAME> ! '
<NAME> is a wonderful fellow over there .
Well , I like a little wildness .
Was you thinking at all of poetry ? ’ Mr <NAME> inquired , musing .
I do n't understand these places . ''
<NAME> ’ t make a noise , my dears , her head aches .
He was as good as his word , and started directly .
‘ I am heartily glad to see him , notwithstanding .
‘ After he was killed. ’ ‘ Killed ?
Shall I send him ? ’ ‘ If you please , ’ rejoined <NAME> .
asked <NAME> , laying his hand on <NAME> 's arm .
Well , I 'll tell you wot the lady said to her .
He has been the -- the -- somehow the cause of all this .
Nothing can be better. ’ ‘ I am glad you approve , <NAME> .
he said , resuming his former position .
‘ I say , coot awa ’ , ’ repeated <NAME> , hastily .
Keep we or do we keep always at it .
The cloth was laid by <NAME> .
`` Also , that I am what I am . ''
The bargain was a short one ; and the horses were soon sent for .
Here he left her , and retired .
She seems to need it . '
`` Can I save the poor girl from injury before they know it ? ''
She had no other light than the light of the fire .
<NAME> , you will not repent it , and I will serve you well .
‘ Such grace , coupled with such dignity !
‘ Oh , you ARE here , ’ said <NAME> , tossing her head .
But you are both of you so like your poor papa .
‘ Why , of course , ’ said she .
‘ Yours , A footstep was heard without .
‘ Just that , sir , ’ replied <NAME> .
And how did my wife get that black eye ?
So he did not say ; it was too late .
‘ The womin , ’ said <NAME> , in the same tone .
He was very chatty with the Apothecary , and they parted excellent friends .
O running stream of sparkling joy To be a soaring human boy !
'Ah , there 's promptness , ' said the undertaker .
‘ What ’ s that about six pound a year ?
he thought he heard the Jew say ; 'it is he , sure enough .
‘ To the hangman , ’ I returned .
Perhaps it was near <NAME> .
'What do you talk about his having neither honour nor glory for ! '
‘ <NAME> ’ t mind him , <NAME> .
‘ Yes , I play chess a little , ’ answered <NAME> .
So <NAME> was sent there .
Take down the shutters , yer idle young ruffian ! '
We are capital company here to- night .
She , looking at him still , takes it to her and unlocks it .
I am nothing of the sort .
No one else ever beheld him in the details of his humiliation .
At length it broke upon his listening ear .
You deserve it , I am sure , for yours is a trying life .
He walked away ; and <NAME> ’ s countenance resumed its customary benign expression .
His bright dark eyes glanced at me for the first time .
As she listened , undecided , all was silent .
‘ When are you going to sea again ? ’ asked <NAME> .
'No , no , my dear , ' said the Jew .
`` Have you given this man work before ? ''
You have not the man to deal with that you think ; try me !
There was wonderful expression in it .
That ’ s _her_ way out of a difficulty .
'Oh , is this the boy ? '
said <NAME> , setting his teeth .
It were vain to conceal it .
<NAME> shivered , and wiped the perspiration from his brow .
We believe that <NAME> was the <NAME> of <NAME> .
'Very happy , sir , ' replied <NAME> .
Make a clear beginning altogether .
What set me off , now , upon that ! ''
I thought it dull , ’ said Mr Dombey .
<NAME> visions of rook-pie floated through his imagination .
But the feeble arm dropped powerless down .
But they were motherless like her -- and had a father .
said the old gentleman , following his eyes .
There is only one judge in town .
But to return to this boy .
I know it too well. ’ ‘ E see you ? ’ asked <NAME> .
I let her into the garden over the way . ''
‘ A man of your appearance couldn ’ t be .
My friends , why with us ?
Somehow , it would make me easier , I fancy .
He is a little longer about this than usual , his hands being numbed .
<NAME> <NAME> eyes him with some surprise .
‘ Through the what ? ’ said <NAME> .
that turned an old man to clay.—Halloa , <NAME> !
within there , ’ said <NAME> , in a deep voice .
‘ The rooks -- what has become of them ? ’ asked <NAME> .
I think I would have gone through a great deal to kiss her cheek .
‘ Toor-ru ! -- such is life , I mean .
The suburbs are , if possible , even more unsubstantial-looking than the city .
‘ Who cried stop ? ’ said <NAME> , turning savagely round .
Would n't they , <NAME> , eh ? '
This description applies to the river-frontage of the <NAME> .
‘ Wide as the distance may seem between us , it is so .
It is polite and it is obliging ; but why do it ?
‘ He is very like <NAME> ! ’ said <NAME> .
She and her husband came in immediately afterwards .
‘ Yes , ’ said <NAME> , whose manner was a little troubled .
Nor do I believe anything whatever .
Why should I disguise it ?
The formation went on very slowly .
‘ What a melancholy confirmation : ain ’ t it ?
‘ My love , I know it .
'Perhaps there may , ' was the composed reply .
“ Shall I do well , in the mean time , to show myself ?
Such an establishment as your relation , <NAME> ’ s , now .
They were coming back , even poorer than they went .
‘ <NAME> , mother , to a word or two .
My Lady is at present represented , near <NAME> , by her portrait .
In almost every yard and blind-place near , there was a church .
This ought to be my nephew , if likenesses run in families .
`` You must have a cab . ''
I never see such a fine creetur in my days .
‘ Be silent yourself , you wretch .
Now , pray don ’ t , pray don ’ t .
I think it must have been to you that he made that promise .
It brought no <NAME> .
The people in <NAME> Place look down upon <NAME> , and think <NAME> low .
He did not look at her , but at <NAME> .
I do n't think he will .
Or how could she postpone the journey without exciting suspicion ?
‘ A proper spirit ? ’ said the Father .
‘ I have nothing in the world .
I saw , and do see , many reasons to make it desirable .
At which point the figure in it gasping , `` O Lord !
‘ <NAME> that he is a beggar , <NAME> ? ’ cried <NAME> .
'Another word , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
`` Every one of them , miss , '' said <NAME> .
‘ They have subpoenaed my three friends , ’ said <NAME> .
That is an inexpiable offence in my eyes .
‘ Very often , <NAME> , ’ answered the second .
My aunt , patting her cat , looked very attentively at <NAME> .
Her mistress was up , she said , and <NAME> was with her .
For he 's too old to be your boy , ma'am . ''
<NAME> has made the very houses prematurely old .
She couldn ’ t say fairer than that .
And you go about , sowing it and raising crops .
‘ No man knows till the time comes , what depths are within him .
His boat ’ s hauled up for three days .
There was no other word to express it ; drivelled .
<NAME> is just come here .
It was a fine dry night , but it was most uncommonly dark .
‘ I was looking at the pictures in the fire , ’ he returned .
My overcharged heart found the same relief , and I cried too .
‘ With shame for myself , and with shame for you .
I was low ; that 's what I was ; low .
With doubts , because the aspiration had been so laid waste in her youth .
And of course I shook my head .
`` You are very hard with me , sir , '' said <NAME> .
‘ Why remarkable , <NAME> ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
‘ How are you ? ’ said the discomfited student .
‘ Take my hat down for a moment from that peg , will you ?
She needs no further escort .
I work for a doll with three daughters .
“ I believe you they dread him .
<NAME> : I have no doubt of it .
It rarely happened now that <NAME> accompanied them .
‘ Then why don ’ t you go ? ’ bawled <NAME> .
She started , stopped , and looked in .
See again , on the table here !
Perhaps she was thinking about them .
Am I always to be baited , and beset , by your mean suspicions ?
‘ Glad to see you , sir , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ To <NAME> first , ’ replied <NAME> .
‘ I believe you she does !
‘ Humiliation I have happily been spared until this day .
Do you ever say so ?
‘ No , but they would indeed .
<NAME> <NAME> got up , rubbing his head , and began to walk about .
Teach these boys and girls nothing but <NAME> .
They would be done long before Sunday , he said .
So did the plump sister when she came .
Another time ! ’ was all I could distinguish .
You may be certain that I will be compassionate and true to you .
‘ I have known it from a boy .
Our chambers were in Garden-court , down by the river .
'Give him something to drink , <NAME> .
I had asked leave to enter of course .
I couldn ’ t help coming up , tonight .
And <NAME> war n't as late last Christmas Day by half-an-hour ? ''
why can not I speak out ?
`` Made her way home once from another quarter of the world .
The man from <NAME> ventures another remonstrative `` My lord ! ''
‘ All right , ’ replied <NAME> faintly .
we are going home soon ; going back .
<NAME> , I wish with all my heart to serve you .
‘ We are mud , underneath his horse ’ s feet .
We then come to -- ha -- to Mr Clennam .
`` Was n't that <NAME> talking to you , <NAME> ? ''
<NAME> <NAME> reposed under a patchwork counterpane , like a Harlequin at home .
I have money and full power , but I want something else .
‘ Heavy for use , but massive and genuine .
I was hateful in mine own eyes .
Allow me to say that I am here for two purposes .
To think of that old gate now !
‘ I have been hasty , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ very hasty .
‘ What is it , <NAME> ? ’ said he .
I must tear myself away , or Pa and <NAME> will both find out !
Five men , as many women , and a little girl .
“ <NAME> , or <NAME> ?
The object of our lives is won .
She then placed herself before the door of the chamber which <NAME> had occupied .
<NAME> and wide lay a ruined country , yielding nothing but desolation .
“ She was pretty enough to have been married long ago .
A very hard poke from the old girl 's umbrella .
' A drain for the boy , ' said <NAME> , half-filling a wine-glass .
‘ But <NAME> -- ’ the bald man hinted .
And I got up , determined to have my share of it .
‘ <NAME> , always ! ’ returned <NAME> , clasping her hands .
Not so low as that .
‘ What are you about , <NAME> ? ’ her brother sulkily remonstrated .
No direct answer could have been half so forcible .
Did it remain there long ?
says <NAME> , glancing at his wife .
'You 're like yourself to-night , <NAME> .
Make the betht of uth ; not the wurtht .
'You 're right for once , ' replied <NAME> gruffly .
There was something additional to look for .
I hope you will not think of me with displeasure now .
‘ Fetch a doctor , ’ quoth <NAME> .
‘ A fresh night ! ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Thankee sir , no sir , ’ said <NAME> .
O my dear , my dear !
And her twin brother could n't wind up a top for his life .
‘ It ’ s shameful that such things should be allowed .
‘ Here ’ s a subpoena for you , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> de do , sir ? ’ said <NAME> , nodding to <NAME> .
He only shook his head .
‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , re-telegraphing in the same manner .
‘ What ! ’ said <NAME> , with a sudden start .
And that aid was his own .
‘ Let me see , ’ said <NAME> .
The agreeable young <NAME> , and <NAME> , were the talkers of the party .
But <NAME> was both , and took them to be complimentary .
‘ But the confinement , ’ said the grey-haired gentleman .
‘ You shall hear from me again .
From the dreary , blighted wilderness of <NAME> , whose only crop is <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> , ’ said the dwarf , glancing from brother to sister .
She started , coloured deeply , and turned white .
Why , do n't I know him ! ''
<NAME> in my own room , I read the letter .
'Oh , there yer are , resting again !
‘ They will all be coming out directly ; let us get away .
It makes me hope that you may be able to bear the connection .
said <NAME> , with a sentimental sternness .
`` Upon the whole , very proper .
'Mine , if you like , <NAME> . '
`` Why , it 's true , '' returns one of the policemen .
‘ You two should be of one mind in all things .
The chief butler was the next magnificent institution of the day .
He sat very close to his father 's side upon his little stool .
‘ It is done in a moment ; there is nothing in it .
He little thinks I know ; he little thinks I care .
<NAME> <NAME> turned her head disdainfully towards him .
‘ What did she say ? ’ ‘ Look , ’ returned the visitor .
‘ That was a tough commencement .
<NAME> <NAME> frowned and shook his head .
I come in behind yourself .
They are here at last !
I am very well , ’ replied Mr Merdle , after deliberating about it .
‘ <NAME> so , ’ replied his companion .
<NAME> and brave through everything .
Oh , Mr <NAME> , you know me better .
said <NAME> , to whom he happened to address himself .
‘ What does that mean ? ’ I asked him , over her shoulder .
As if _they_ had any help for anybody in their absurd baskets !
<NAME> ’ at be that shadow ootside door there ?
Now for what , my dear friend ? ''
We have been married above two months .
ho ! ” repeated a voice which sounded close behind him .
“ I heard you were released , <NAME> .
Neither of them hinted at it .
<NAME> <NAME> came down soon after .
Now , I hear <NAME> 's step coming to the door .
I must really shake hands with you again .
‘ I said , save them , ’ returned the latter .
It is but a moment .
Since you ask me , my love , I reply that I have not .
<NAME> and me is a goin ’ by <NAME> !
says the woman with abhorrence .
And another coming , I ’ ll lay half-a-crown .
`` Then I 'll die in the streets ! ''
Mr Riah is his mask .
Is it -- eh ? -- because he thinks you young and innocent ?
Will you be so good as shut the door ?
<NAME> , with the eyes of the world upon you !
I understood him and waved mine in thanks .
It was like hearing his voice in a strange country .
I have no feeling either way .
No , I find I can ’ t .
“ My name is on the first leaf .
‘ No-n-no , my darling , ’ returned <NAME> .
We might oust the girl herself ? ’ Mrs <NAME> shook her head .
‘ It ’ s so unsportsmanlike , ’ reasoned <NAME> .
His way lay directly in front of the cottage .
'That she died last winter , ' rejoined <NAME> .
`` I have finished my professional visit , '' he said , coming forward .
“ Do n't look ! ” cried <NAME> .
`` No , <NAME> ; not the soldier . ''
‘ Good-bye , dear Mr Lammle -- I mean <NAME> .
I can dream of them .
<NAME> ; for she had saved a little , and added to it .
I couldn ’ t do it , <NAME> , indeed .
Why , I see it every day of my life .
‘ Lor , <NAME> , dear , ’ said the other nine-and-twenty boarders .
He reunited them in his thoughts , and they were never asunder .
‘ My daughter , sir , ’ said Mr Rugg .
Let them set the chafing-dish upon the floor , and go .
‘ Is <NAME> at home ? ’ said I , entering .
He was very communicative last night , and told me more of his life .
‘ <NAME> long is this to last !
'That 's the boy , ' replied <NAME> .
`` When did he come here ? ''
‘ Now , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ sit down .
No , I don ’ t mean to encourage him .
She stole down the stairs and passage again .
asks the trooper , pausing as he conveys his smoking saucer to his lips .
I was chubby myself , and ought to know .
<NAME> has his weather-eye open , <NAME> .
It is possible , my friend , that your ardour is a little compromising .
I don ’ t blame it ; but I no longer understand it .
But she goes no further away from it than the chair upon the hearth .
I have no desire to read it , ’ was her answer .
`` Certainly and surely I do , guv'ner , '' is <NAME> 's reply .
Now , <NAME> , only half a dozen words more .
Both you and <NAME> are .
I do not know that man .
He looked like a foreigner .
‘ The old man seemed instantly deprived of speech .
They were loitering somewhere , talking about him .
Is there THREE of 'em then ? ''
What do you suppose was the worth of them clothes you had ?
`` <NAME> , you are going to <NAME> ? ''
So be it ; it won ’ t last long .
‘ Nothing at all , unless it was the behaviour of that old bear .
I feel my troubles , and they make me contrary .
Never knew her do such a thing before .
‘ You ’ re not going to lodge ‘ em for nothing .
`` But you have not mentioned that party 's name .
<NAME> ’ us thee hond agean , yoongster .
‘ I only mean , not happy with us .
Give me a glass of water .
I know that you move in the whole Society of the country .
said <NAME> ; giving Oliver a shake , and a box on the ear .
Why it stands to reason .
It isn ’ t his place to grumble .
‘ Oh , indeed , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ You mistake it in the beginning .
Each was looking out to take the other at a disadvantage .
<NAME> <NAME> was affected ; the two men looked so very miserable .
`` You can scarcely be strong yet .
‘ He is greatly better , thank you .
‘ I let it off. ’ ‘ Well done .
`` Never , '' <NAME> made answer to it .
You needn ’ t mention her name .
Mr <NAME> was in capital spirits , and talked much .
“ And the maker 's name ? ” said <NAME> .
The <NAME> Office is a very compact and very beautiful building .
I have picked up a little since .
He got up , and rushed into the field without .
A man of a very low character of mind . ''
And she hates me , ’ said <NAME> , moodily .
These slippery smooth walls would give him no chance .
That out-dacious <NAME> had demogalized them all ! '
<NAME> is the irritability of sudden poverty .
“ What 'll I do with it !
It puts us in a new position , <NAME> .
`` You are quite safe here .
<NAME> <NAME> shrugged his shoulders , and was silent .
Long-suffering and loving <NAME> , you never complain .
All my life might have been. ” “ No , <NAME> .
‘ To drink ? ’ returned <NAME> , stopping to slap his cheek .
The old unhappy feeling pervaded my life .
Let go , mother ; let go .
‘ Why not ? ’ asked Mrs. Nickleby .
I told thee I had had a fright .
God love it , so it was !
I visited both houses nearly every day , during my stay in <NAME> .
<NAME> , I am in a horrible mess .
For a long time , <NAME> remained motionless in this attitude .
‘ A double , sir , ’ said <NAME> .
You have the devil ’ s luck in bargains , always .
He reddened a little through his brown and made me a trooper 's bow .
Her hand was just within it , when she drew it back .
He turned away his head , and appeared absorbed in melancholy reflection .
I will do more for you than you figure to yourself now .
‘ I know you both a great deal better than you know yourselves .
‘ She knows wot ’ s wot , she does .
`` And how do you live , <NAME> ?
‘ Oh , hold me to your heart , my husband !
What right have they to butcher me ? '
<NAME> , too , I 'm afraid , sir . '
On the road ( except at <NAME> ) he had heard absolutely nothing .
I now began very quietly to make such preparations as I thought were necessary .
‘ Something against him ? ’ repeats <NAME> .
Do _you_ want to be trampled upon and stoned ?
We make a point of it .
‘ “ Prove it , <NAME> ! ” we says , ’ repeated <NAME> .
The next thing to be done was to unharness the horse .
Let me say how much I feel for you !
I mean your servant-girl. ’ ‘ Peggotty , ’ said my mother .
You would have admired him as much as we all do .
‘ Is it likely that this nephew can know anything about that beautiful girl ?
If I have the misfortune to be under that influence , so has he .
That entreaty is the second object of my call .
Therefore , they repaired , with fluttering hearts , to the well-remembered booth .
‘ I feel that I am weak .
A spirit ! ’ ‘ Where is she ? ’ demanded <NAME> .
His private position rests solely with Mr Merdle .
“ Shall if I like , ” growled <NAME> .
For I asked him to go there with me .
‘ Fine women , sir ! ’ replied the collector ; ‘ ay !
‘ Or would you be persuaded to try a new-laid hegg ?
<NAME> <NAME> was at home .
On the whole , I myself consider it the best .
She tried the garden with no better effect .
You will be charmed with it .
‘ For I remember thinking she was very near our age .
‘ Some of ‘ em were talking about it in the office today .
Do n't you know the devil when he 's got a great-coat on ? '
Recommendation is not the word , <NAME> .
'Bow to the magistrate , my dear . '
Before my eyes he grows suspicious , capricious , hard , tyrannical , unjust .
`` All is still in readiness , <NAME> ? ''
‘ Quite so , ’ replied that gentleman .
The worst was past with you , mother .
Mr and <NAME> had come to breakfast with Mr and <NAME> .
I left you such a child , and find you -- oh !
No , no , I wo n't be contradicted , Esther dear !
'Do n't worry me now , <NAME> ! '
That ’ s as it may happen .
Everything was wet and clammy to the touch .
'Do you see anything -- hear anything -- feel anything -- eh ? '
What else can you make her do ?
It was the easiest way , and , beyond all comparison , the properest .
what was that ? ’ said <NAME> , in a low tone of voice .
With whom Mr Dombey immediately took wine .
‘ To make you change your religion , ’ said <NAME> .
She will be mourning and grieving .
It quiets me for a moment , but does not make me unhappy .
`` They are my weak point .
She 's got the fever coming on ; that 's it . '
‘ You very seldom see your sister , ’ said Mrs. Gradgrind .
The tickets we have received on board the steamboat are marked No .
‘ But always ? ’ said the child .
`` I have thought it better not to mention it to her . ''
<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> against <NAME> and Mrs .
He would make a delightful mute , my love . '
He falters an awkward excuse or two for his failure .
<NAME> , with his hands in his pockets , slouched heavily at my side .
I never noticed it before . '
`` And do n't you occupy yourself at all ? ''
It was an awkward corner .
You won ’ t be long away. ’ ‘ No , no , no .
Again -- this veal in savoury jelly is for <NAME> .
In the <NAME> of <NAME> ?
`` And refused all proposals , '' said my guardian .
I hate my <NAME> , of all my heart .
We were thus a good while in getting to the <NAME> .
I have no doubt that my poor dear mother thought him so too .
says the trooper , looking down upon him like a giant .
‘ Do I ? ’ said <NAME> .
This again made the excellent woman vastly sentimental .
So there is hope for the old ship yet .
Have I read the little book wot you left ?
Let us drink to somebody .
‘ Let me see , ’ said <NAME> .
It was of no use asking myself this question now .
<NAME> looks up for the first time , quite frightened at the thought .
We proceeded to the top-storey of the house .
But , <NAME> , I know what will happen .
The business was all Fact , from first to last .
Would she show him some ?
What was behind Mr Pancks on <NAME> ’ s Hand 36 .
My aunt , with her own watch in her hand , did the like .
Everything was conducted on the most liberal and delightful scale .
`` I want to know his name , if you please ? ''
But this is nothing to laugh at .
It ’ s a most extraordinary cure -- a most extraordinary cure .
‘ Wot box ? ’ said the long-legged young man .
It rose under my hand , and the door yielded .
I hold myself quite at your disposal .
<NAME> <NAME> gave me her chilly finger-nails , and sat severely rigid .
Why do you injuriously introduce the name of my mother by adoption ?
' I never told him so , sir , ' returned <NAME> in amazement .
But I am not clear about the drug .
My eldest daughter and my son , Mr Clennam .
No more was my Uncle ’ s <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
Do n't cut my throat , sir , ” I pleaded in terror .
I only want to buy my poor little two shillings ’ worth of waste .
‘ Take this , ’ cried <NAME> , putting money in her hand .
`` It was admirably said by <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> beckons her , with even an appearance of interest .
‘ I hope so , ’ said <NAME> .
`` But every man 's not obliged to be solvent ?
They turned and she turned .
They took me upstairs to a warm room and left me there .
Accept them if you like .
The day was cold and wet , but she scarcely knew it .
‘ Just so , ’ said <NAME> , pulling up his neckcloth .
‘ You look very pretty to-day , Nelly , charmingly pretty .
‘ I dare say it ’ s none the worse for keeping cold .
Why , bless my soul , <NAME> , transparently so ! ''
The Courier in the rumble was not altogether comfortable in his mind .
Except in my bad side of human nature , ” murmured <NAME> .
`` Take courage , '' said <NAME> .
He had appointed the time himself , and we were alone .
If so , it were better that he knew nothing .
‘ Monday would suit me to perfection , ’ replies <NAME> .
'Ah , to be sure , my dear , ' replied the Jew .
what was it ? ’ Florence heard her father demand like a madman .
I had considered the question , and had resolved to accept nothing .
It was not his fault that we were married .
‘ Noised in all directions , ’ replied <NAME> .
I have his father here , ’ retorted <NAME> .
For , so he took possession of him .
You will be tender with me , I am sure .
`` I hope you will persuade him , Mrs .
'When is it to be done ? '
I have done so myself .
<NAME> , my dear , comparatively speaking you ’ re safe .
The effects of which movement it is impossible to calculate .
I hinted that the climate -- `` The finest climate in the world ! ''
‘ Do you really believe you know better ?
‘ Place chairs. ’ The page placed them .
And I saw her yesterday .
<NAME> says anything , at any meal , to anybody .
‘ A couple o ’ sawbones , ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> had regarded these proceedings , at first , in perfect bewilderment .
All buttoned-up men are believed in .
You always have held up your head and fought low , <NAME> .
and drop me a line where to forward it .
If you long for it now , that 's enough .
`` Whatever you desire , my dear .
First , because the Court don ’ t think it fair .
Theoretically , she was already as good a blacksmith as I , or better .
<NAME> <NAME> has no objection to an interminable Chancery suit .
But now I 'll ask you a question .
<NAME> there any poor pretence of any in our bargain ?
<NAME> <NAME> has some confidential Intercourse with another old Friend .
Do you know the place where he was buried ? ''
A good endearing creature she was .
I shall put him in the advertisement , this time .
just six-and-twenty years , it was time to have tea .
Is it possible ? ’ It was <NAME> !
I shall make myself so disagreeable -- and so will Jip !
‘ Gl -- ’ ‘ Eh ? ’ cried <NAME> , turning sharp round .
`` I assure you we found it so , '' says <NAME> .
“ Not feeckle , <NAME> , ” says she .
Nothing but these little incidents occurred on the way .
‘ To think that I should be such a noddy !
This was not the least pleasant of <NAME> ’ s employments .
It 's him ! ” <NAME> , without a doubt !
Within this space , he now slouched backwards and forwards .
My comfort is , <NAME> understood me .
The figure showed itself aware of me , as I advanced .
It can not be , ' said the old lady energetically .
In my mother ’ s room , in fact .
There 's a pitcher of water in the corner by the door .
It was , properly , a half-holiday ; being Saturday .
I said I wished you had not followed me , sir .
But it was in vain to urge them to adopt some other course .
As to <NAME> , whither _he_ tended , he neither considered nor cared .
Whenever you want me , you will find me here .
‘ Yes it is ! ’ cried <NAME> .
That 's the sort of thing ! '
believes it is here , one believes it is there .
Then he would n't have got himself into these troubles . ''
‘ Never mind , ’ said <NAME> , gasping for breath .
'There 's more than one will go with this . '
She would do anything for me .
There was that in her manner which prepared <NAME> for what was coming .
It is little to relinquish .
'Just at dinner-time -- two o'clock this afternoon .
‘ <NAME> ’ t speak to him for the world .
You know <NAME> , I think ?
‘ But there ’ s another sort of girls than that about .
<NAME> hold of your money .
'What do you mean , sir ? '
‘ Why , like forty hackney-coachmen , ’ replied the clerk .
'Now , my boy , which house is it ? '
This he was used to , and could take soundings of .
All that you have given me , is at your command to have again .
Left ear cropt. ’ ‘ Taken up , a negro man .
Do n't have what , dear Pa ? ''
’ <NAME> done now , when I have put this on .
Then , the noise again , more clamorous and importunate than before .
<NAME> , <NAME> , and many of ’ em !
‘ You won ’ t do for ladies ’ company , dripping wet .
‘ Capital ! ’ echoed both <NAME> and <NAME> .
I have been true to you , upon my guilty soul I have ! '
The stately residence of <NAME> was altogether blighted and deserted .
The housebreaker freed one arm , and grasped his pistol .
How was I to know ?
You understand what I mean .
You are gone to try to do me some good , I know !
And they prepare to bear the venerable burden to the <NAME> 's <NAME> .
I am a great deal better now ! ’ he answered .
I never believed that the paragraph had any foundation , my dear -- impossible .
‘ Bight you are ! ’ cried <NAME> .
<NAME> and distrust were exhibited in his countenance .
They must be paid , ’ said my aunt .
`` In the same mind , sir . ''
`` If you have anything to say , say it , say it . ''
And what is it , <NAME> ? ''
The inexorable finger underwent no change .
Often. ’ ‘ And where is my old nurse ? ’ said <NAME> .
Going to <NAME> ? ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> looked good-humouredly at <NAME> , who , taking the hint , disappeared .
It was a very cold day , with cutting blasts of wind .
Be as cool as you can .
He seemed neither to advance nor to recede .
They carry savings : to hoard up ?
‘ What has given you offence ? ’ ‘ Offence ! ’ repeated <NAME> .
The mature young lady is a lady of property .
‘ So <NAME> died , and <NAME> disappeared , and <NAME> was born .
Four-and-forty year ! ’ <NAME> closed the book again .
‘ Suppose we had never been born ! ’ said I , gaily .
‘ You positively must , ’ urged Pluck .
The walls and ceiling of the room were perfectly black with age and dirt .
'Hush , pray ; there 's a good man ! '
You know that , as well as I . '
You ca n't think how kind he is to <NAME> .
'He 'll eat his head , if he does n't , ' growled <NAME> .
I shall see him , as my poor mother saw him long ago .
What are you doing of ?
I can ’ t make out when yesterday was .
Should I go to <NAME> 's by myself ?
He is dying now , of want of presentation to <NAME> .
`` I do , '' said <NAME> with great vigour .
If I have hurt you , I hope you will forgive me .
No doubt it would distress her greatly .

I tried to haul in last time , but I couldn ’ t .
`` Air you in the maydickle prayfession yourself , sir ? ''
Still , he clung to it .
Spiritual revelations were conceded to <NAME> at that favoured period , as at this .
A roar of applause that rent the air .
‘ The message is from him , ’ said <NAME> .
I -- I -- don ’ t know what comes over me .
‘ <NAME> them all to go away .
I have influence , <NAME> , to help or oppose .
Swiftly and darkly , Mr <NAME> ’ s face changed .
‘ What do you want here , scoundrels ? ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Nothing , my dear boy , nothing , ’ said <NAME> .
I took his hand and kissed it .

'You do n't mean to deny that , I suppose ? '
The harder the gusts , the better progress they appeared to make .
But that did not discourage me .
Next night , she found him walking about the conservatory when she came down .
“ How should I know ? ” returned the other .
But it had a preponderating tendency , when considered , to become fainter .
The others are so dark .
If it fails with her , my power is gone . ' )
I need not dwell on this to you , mother .
This is the <NAME> , ma ’ am .
‘ I ’ m a going to seek my niece .
Let <NAME> look to it .
Now the boat was out at sea , but gliding smoothly on .
I only know he 's dead . ''
How did <NAME> tame her , <NAME> ? ” “ That 's his secret .
He was immediately handed to the front , to speak to him .
“ No , my dear , not ill .
You really must be careful .
<NAME> ’ t let me disturb you .
‘ Why , my gracious me , what is there that does not change !
asked <NAME> , brightening more and more .
For this was a new light to me .
‘ It won ’ t do , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
If it was worth my while , I ’ d pull his nose .
And no wonder in this evil place . ''
With a deprecating smile , the host gently raised and gently lowered his shoulders .
<NAME> had no such thoughts .
In remarking that your friend has shown impatience , I say no such thing .
'Do not conceal that from me , at least , <NAME> . '
Mr <NAME> , with the fortune of a prince .
Do remember the medical man !
<NAME> , Mr Clennam will excuse any household business you may have together .
The June weather was delicious .
Bless my soul , I forgot !
‘ There he goes ! ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Oh it ’ s you , is it ?
<NAME> <NAME> and her feminine graces .
So well done of you , <NAME> dear !
<NAME> ’ t Fanny me , you mean little thing , don ’ t !
It ’ s not my fault , <NAME> .
Certainly , <NAME> would think again .
People were justly interested in the dog .
‘ Shall I go to him again to-morrow , dear grandfather ?
I shall call you to an account for this .
<NAME> , that man has made friends with our articled clerk .
What relation will this young fellow be to <NAME> now ?
<NAME> can ever be better friends to me than Mrs <NAME> ’ s been .
I am putting a case .
‘ There , there ! ’ said the soothing voice of <NAME> presently .
You will be much better to-morrow , <NAME> .
So well-timed , is it not ?
‘ How is the old rough and tough monster of <NAME> ?
He is always in extremes , perpetually in the superlative degree .
'Let him be ; let him be . '
It was evident to me that this was the duty assigned to her .
Talk of not being qualified to be miscellaneous !
I could n't keep my eyes off him .
‘ What was that ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
And what was the young man ’ s reward ?
As dusk draws on , he paces the <NAME> ’ Vineyard .
Can I do anything for you ? ’ ‘ Many thanks .
‘ No. ’ The man shook his head .

Her <NAME> name is Clara. ’ ‘ Is it though ? ’ said <NAME> .
But this is from the purpose .

Respecting attendance ; two is kep ’ , at liberal wages .
‘ Sheer off , ’ said the <NAME> .
`` I suppose you have some settled home .
‘ Hold me here , dear fellow , if you can .

But <NAME> said , sharply , “ Give him wine , <NAME> .
Different gangs and different ships .
‘ My life , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Nothing ? ’ repeated <NAME> , indignantly and amazedly .
<NAME> <NAME> 's eye follows <NAME> 's eye .
It does me good fur to look at you , <NAME> .

<NAME> beef and plum-pudding for every one .
I can ’ t go anywhere without being Patronized .
Let them look abroad and contemplate the scenes which were enacting around them .
To <NAME> , he commended them all , and explained his worldly affairs .
Out of sight , out of mind .
the workman wants to know .
I have told you so .
If he comes to half-hours , it 's as much as <NAME> does .
' I hope I shall know her better very shortly . '
Among the loiterers here , was <NAME> of <NAME> .
You are a human boy , my young friend .
He was eccentric -- he was very eccentric .
I said to <NAME> , I knowed as I had been low .
`` <NAME> , miss , '' returned <NAME> .
A man must be himself .
And my head is much better and cooler , and I am quite comfortable .
`` Oh , yes , indeed they do , <NAME> !
‘ You are the picture of independence .
‘ How it hurts one ’ s shoulder , though .
'You are afraid , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
This news about the fellow , Mr <NAME> ?
She never turns her head .
Do n't be uneasy for me !
He had left the signs of his misery upon it . ''
<NAME> Mr <NAME> was also well .
I have money enough , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ What are you talking about ?
After a while , <NAME> turned away his head again .
And then they both looked at <NAME> .
This is a great deal worse , and a great deal more embarrassing .
Just now and then , ’ he answered , slightly .
<NAME> <NAME> summed up , in the old-established and most approved form .
`` Now , did it strike your ladyship that she was like anybody ? ''
Let me see thee setten by the bed .
Besides , he had taken <NAME> in .
<NAME> woman , dear Dame Durden ! ''
<NAME> <NAME> asks , triumphant in his admiration of his lady 's genius .
<NAME> ’ s the friend , not Short .
<NAME> <NAME> is by no means friendly towards the inflammable young spark .
God bless my soul ! ’ and seemed extremely glad to see them .
I had it all from him in the first five minutes .
Your mistake makes my position a very delicate one .
Bless the bright eyes of your sex !
No outward reason is apparent for it .
`` You do yourself an injustice .
<NAME> is persuaded that he must be a <NAME> .
‘ The very next , ’ replied <NAME> .
‘ How can you talk such nonsense ?
He was so well seasoned , that it was mere child ’ s play .
‘ Yes , <NAME> , ’ said Mrs. Sparsit .
‘ Then I can ’ t go , ’ said he .
‘ Here it is , ’ said the pretty housemaid .
That ’ s what I mean , ’ said <NAME> .
Now , tell me -- do tell me .
The excitement does me good .
We tarried here three days .
‘ I wish you would repeat it , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Compose yourself , my own angel , ’ said <NAME> .
She coom back , she coom back , she coom back .
I will not have him here .
The staircase was short , and they were soon at the top .
<NAME> and nonsense ! ’ said my aunt .
Of course , except the two that died last week .
Mrs Blimber was a little condescending , but extremely kind .
‘ Not at all , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> ? ’ said <NAME> , inquiringly .
‘ Perhaps it ’ s kind. ’ ‘ Pooh , pooh , Mr Pancks .
<NAME> ’ s mother offended her family by marrying <NAME> ’ s father .
Wonderful ! ’ ‘ Not at all , Mr Wegg .
My man comes from the country where they make the <NAME> .
Tell me why you wished to see me .
‘ It would be well to reflect .
‘ Lud ! ’ exclaimed <NAME> , staring .
If an eye were furtively raised and met his , it was instantly averted .
‘ It an ’ t a fit return .
It was so opposed to your interests .
What business had I to make myself known ?
<NAME> ’ t know anything about it , ’ said Mr Wobbler .
That ’ s what I want to know .
I am old and timid .
said <NAME> , kissing his hand .
And so , to do him justice , he did .
The novelty of my doing anything in the least useful , had its charms .
How I almost look upon you now as my protector and guardian !
It ’ s Mr Mantalini I am confident. ’ ‘ Do make sure !
You have all been slow but me , ’ said the old man .
My conscience was not by any means comfortable about <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> rang the bell , purchased the tickets , and ordered chamber candlesticks .
The one great principle of the <NAME> law is to make business for itself .
Yes ; he had better be taken to her .
'Never mind wot it is ! '
Still , <NAME> was lonely , and at a loss .
‘ Shall he be brought here , ma ’ am ? ’ asked <NAME> .
`` She lives the same life yet ? ''
cried the lad who held the door .
He answers to the name of <NAME> .
I ate umble pie with an appetite .
I shall be soon forgotten so , and shall disgrace him least .
Yes , sir ; nigh upon two hours .
I could not be his death . '
You recollect what pavement is said to be made of good intentions .
He was a man of the world , and knew some great people .
When they returned , Mr Inspector looked considerably astonished .
They saw him , even as it was , crushed .
'And his missis , ' interposed <NAME> .
I have considered , ever since I have been capable of serious reflection .
cries Grandfather Smallweed , stretching out both hands to embrace him .
It would be no pain to sleep amidst them .
We will discuss it no more now .
Nobody belonging to you shall be wronged .
Let him alone for that . '
Emboldened by this happy change , mention D. C. upstairs .
But the <NAME> nation had so grand a genius for punctuality .
One and one ’ s two ; not one .
‘ We will dine alone , then .
‘ Only a cobweb , ’ replied <NAME> .
“ Rum. ” “ Rum , ” repeated the stranger .
I hope you have nothing on your mind , ma ’ am .
Alone , he did not try .
'You think so now , <NAME> , ' replied his mother .
‘ But a change came upon the view , almost imperceptibly .
I told my aunt that indeed she was mistaken .
And then again : you saw that ship being towed out by a steam-tug ?
<NAME> loved me , first , for her sake .
Mr Clennam I heard was here , from Mr Dorrit .
said <NAME> , looking in at the coach-window .
`` I 'm everyways agreeable , sir , '' says the hapless Jo .
‘ Mr Twemlow. ’ He answers , ‘ I beg your pardon ?
‘ We were iron , <NAME> , and it forged us .
What work did he do ?
“ Go on , <NAME> , ” said <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> !
Admirable in his way , his way was a back and a bye way .
‘ Who is it ? ’ said <NAME> , in her Act-of-Parliament manner .
They are awaiting him , he knows .
‘ How should you ? ’ repeated <NAME> with a sneer .
His friend looked at him with a braggart air , and sang to himself .
_I_ don ’ t know anything about it .
There was little roughness in the sport , and much playfulness .
<NAME> would be quite sufficient , I should say , ’ returned his sister .
I wish <NAME> could have that comfort , but he sets it at defiance .
You don ’ t know how you haunt me and bewilder me .
`` Not in the least , '' said he .
A little voice , very pretty , very innocent .
A great many back-payments are included in it , I assure you .
‘ Take that thing off your face. ’ She put it back .
She sat by the bed , watching and tending his wife .
`` Your ladyship , I conclude with that . ''
But what would you have ?
‘ A -- and how is <NAME> ? ’ said <NAME> .
I demand to see her .
<NAME> <NAME> shakes his relentless head .
Was it this voice , or at all like this voice ? ''
Clearly , he did not know .
‘ Have you got everything ? ’ said <NAME> , in an agitated tone .
‘ Von Koeldwethout never saw it again .
‘ You mean well , no doubt .
‘ Nothing ails me in body but old age .
She detaches herself from her simple-hearted companion and leaves the room .
<NAME> <NAME> is not well .
What I have got to say is about her ladyship .
At which you never see a man so frightened as my <NAME> was .
They little thought they had married her to a madman .
'Then take something , ma'am , ' said <NAME> soothingly .
You do n't know what may happen to him .
‘ <NAME> <NAME> about the flight. ’ ‘ Mr .
‘ However , I think it ’ s all for the best .
`` But I suppose you must have the whole day .
There ! ’ said poor Mr Toots .
I am making a study of him .
‘ Oh , <NAME> , ’ exclaimed <NAME> , through her sobs and tears .
Now you are coming to what I do n't understand . ''
‘ ’ E went and lamed isself .
I do n't like to see an old acquaintance giving in like this .
If you doubt that in the least degree , I will never write it .

‘ Just that , sir , ’ replied <NAME> .
I have never said I was your mother .
My dear <NAME> , <NAME> ’ s is not a common case .
He is a cousin , several times removed .
‘ I am glad to see it again .
( His organs of vision had been closed nearly twenty seconds . )
Arriving at the house ( the cleanest place , my dear !
There 's no great odds betwixt us .
‘ Yes , sir , ’ said the girl reluctantly .
In their name I bear her hence .
‘ No , <NAME> , I will not .
He remained silent for a few moments , that she might regain her composure .
I hooked your <NAME> ’ s bundle out of the river .
said <NAME> , with a comical effort to look humane .
The maid replies , that <NAME> never asked the question .
And with you and me leaning back inside , as grand as ninepence !
‘ Mind what I say to you , ’ whispered <NAME> .
Every object was obscure at one or two yards ’ distance .
And what do you suppose it 's made of ?
He watches it as it falls , throughout the whole wintry day .
But as the little woman feelingly says , many thanks she gets for it !
‘ Yes , and why we are face to face for the last time .
There was another thing that <NAME> observed .
`` It shall not be wanting , mademoiselle . ''
‘ I want to go away .
‘ Where ’ s there ? ’ inquired the carrier .
I ’ ll lock it up for her , <NAME> , and lose it .
Why neighbour , what ’ s the matter ?
Noble natures under such circumstances become enraged .
<NAME> looked up hastily , and as hastily looked down again .
‘ The silent tomb ! ’ repeated <NAME> .
‘ A ’ most made up her mind !
But no word issued from the majestic matron ’ s lips .
His spirit inspired me with great respect .
Oh , take comfort in thinking that I am so bad .
Her visitor , standing quite still , looked at her attentively .
It ’ s a <NAME> ’ s suit of clothes .
'And a dreadful murder it was . '
‘ Why , I don ’ t know , ’ said my aunt .
Let me hear one of ‘ em -- the best .
I keep a shooting gallery , but not much of a one . ''
‘ He ’ s extremely pleasant ! ’ cried the obsequious <NAME> .
‘ Is anything the matter ? ’ inquired the three ladies .
Do come back , ’ said his wife , earnestly .
‘ I have received pupils here .
I ’ ll give up it , and I ’ ll give up you .
But , all this was at first .
<NAME> , mistress , this is the key of my wine-cellar .
No oblivion , and no rest .
I looked in to ask you who copied this . ''
<NAME> 's head looks out of window too and nods to Jobling .
I exclaimed involuntarily , `` What will he do when you are gone ! ''
The man obeyed , and <NAME> followed the light closely with his eyes .
You had gone , for a friend perhaps .
“ Is she , uncle ? ” asked my sister .
‘ Not at all , <NAME> , ’ returned Mr Toots .
‘ I , ’ said <NAME> , stepping forward .
‘ Tozer , ’ said the young gentleman .
They tell me I owe more than that .
It is at the bottom of three fourths of their troubles .
But is it so far beyond all others that it is altogether unapproachable ?

‘ This restlessness began with me , long ago .
'Of course , ' replied Mrs. Maylie .
`` Might not that have made her still more proud , grandmother ? ''
There was another : a young man , whose madness was love and music .
That ’ s more like the word .
You have no reason to think so , ’ observed <NAME> .
I had not looked for him .
The pretty girl of whom <NAME> had told us was close by her .
‘ <NAME> is the next , sir .
Very glad to make two public characters acquainted !
let me reply to you .
His eyes glistened as he raised the lid , and looked in .
Yes , she wos here when the lady come .
‘ They asked permission to call , ’ said Mrs. Wititterly .
I have been , and I may be again .
But that is neither here nor there .
‘ But don ’ t you think it means more ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
They are always sending for her to come and try something on .
Then she took from her bosom a sealed paper .
And how can a man put a price upon his mind !
‘ I won ’ t hear of <NAME> .
My own appetite came back miraculously .
He rose up as she advanced , and stood with his head uncovered .
<NAME> ’ t frown at me , man !
Your good lady is quite composed .
And I won ’ t leave her .
All girls ; ten in number , including me .

The <NAME> ’ s a smart man .
‘ Far more comfortable here , than ever I was outside .

It was an innocently credulous and a much ill-used world .
<NAME> ! ’ said <NAME> , folding it up , ‘ a delightful letter .
I saw her stooping over her , and putting money in her bosom .
‘ So much trouble for nothing ?
‘ You needn ’ t return , ’ repeated the superior , sharply .
You have done me a world of good .
Now , <NAME> , my love , quick , quick !
‘ Because it ’ s not polite , ’ said <NAME> , snappishly .
Two young ladies of the highest respectability .
‘ I wondered at what house the <NAME> coach put up .
<NAME> <NAME> met the lifted eyebrows and forehead with a cold , impassive stare .
'Why , sure you 're not afraid of it ? '
<NAME> gave it me , but was thoughtful .
<NAME> that. ’ ‘ D ’ ye think not ? ’ said <NAME> .
She pressed her lips together , and hesitated .
‘ You ’ re a-taking notice , are you ?
To begin at the beginning .
But where could she take refuge , and how could she go ?
‘ So you shall , ‘ <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> .
she missed me that time .
All round the clock it labours up the broken steps , shattered and worn .

‘ It was no doing o ’ mine .
'Walk in , ' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat .
‘ To do neither , ’ she returned .
The long , low , white house there .
A baronetcy was spoken of with confidence ; a peerage was frequently mentioned .
You were always her favourite .
`` My dear , I never saw him . ''
‘ <NAME> , my darling , ’ said <NAME> , tartly .
There was a boy singing a Christmas Carol at my door last night .
nothing came of the late struggle .
He promptly replied in <NAME> , ‘ No .

'Some mistake , ' said <NAME> .
An amazing creature that , sir !

‘ Gentlemen , and madam , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ good morning !
‘ I ’ m ready , sir , quite ready .
‘ Why should you be inconvenienced ?
‘ I didn ’ t mind what I was , then .
‘ My dear Sir , ’ remonstrated the little man .
If corn is not to be relied upon , what is ?
<NAME> returned , and she too remained quiet .
And did you take milk ?
And , through so many and such close teeth , he could mutter well .
muttered the Jew : changing countenance ; 'only two of 'em ?
“ Do n't look ! ” cried <NAME> , absolutely desperate .
`` They were taken and secreted .
‘ The jade ! ’ said the same voice which had spoken before .
I never can be happy more , without it ! ’ Unchanged still .

In the absence of the active and intelligent , the coroner converses with <NAME> .
Mr <NAME> explained that it was no friend of his .
Besides , the children of the poor know but few pleasures .
‘ Pictures at the <NAME> , quite divine ! ’ said <NAME> .
`` We know it better than to trust to it .
In the midst of my distress , I had no notion of going back .
‘ How I should like to see him ! ’ exclaimed the friend .
‘ Oh ! ’ said Mr Toots after long consideration .
`` He shall bring it down .
I doubted whether he could have dined without her .

However the cat jumps , HE ’ S a liar .

And how did you pass your birthday , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Delightfully !
They have gone out for the day . '
“ It is the fashion , ” growled the man .
It had begun on Monday , and here was Wednesday come .
I have been a dupe and a fool to him long enough .

Her married life glided happily on .
‘ Did you think I wanted a situation now -- eh ?
`` That is no light part of my penance , '' pursued the <NAME> .
I could n't be guilty of the meanness of coming back without it .
I said , what would be the expense of this young female ?
Now , you see , what I want to talk about , is this .
Thus rumour thrives in the capital , and will not go down into <NAME> .
I assure you there is nothing , my dear sir .
`` I call her Esther Summerson , '' says Mrs. Chadband with austerity .
“ I can bear it , dear <NAME> .
It ’ s no use shaking him .
`` Have you gathered any intelligence ? ''
We tarried here , four days .
In any case we must not be hard on him .
They left the room , and the door was again locked .
But I forgive you. ’ ‘ You forgive me ! ’ I repeated disdainfully .
I must have one or two of the best of ‘ em to-night .
But she preyed upon our minds dreadfully .
not a word , <NAME> ; not a syllable .
<NAME> was not surprised to hear her say so -- not he .
There was no change whatever in <NAME> .

He cross-examined his very wine when he had nothing else in hand .
When I came back , <NAME> kissed my hand and seemed quite touched .
<NAME> <NAME> had forgotten this .
You do not , or you would not be bound on such a journey .

We would make him as rich as a Jew if we knew how .

I am sure you mean to be kind to us .
She was accustomed to wear odd weedy little flowers in her bonnets and caps .

It further happened that <NAME> , not being philosophical , was intelligible .
`` How are we getting on ? ''
'Come ; you should know her better than me .
He actually seemed to serve as a zest to <NAME> 's wine .
Tell me what man that was whom we saw lying dead ? ''
Much obliged to you for recalling it so accurately and anticipating me .
‘ Who is the owner of this house ? ’ said <NAME> , hastily .
I have been thinking about my old looks -- such as they were . ''
‘ You must take this matter in hand for them , my dear sir .

`` My little retreat is made a paradise . ''
I have now merely to apologize for trespassing so long upon your attention .
No , no ! ’ returned Mr Slum , elevating his hand .

Did he not feel quite well ?
I am well , I am strong and constant .
‘ Well , well ! ’ said <NAME> .
You had better ask <NAME> .
Her room was clean , but very , very bare .
‘ Mr Rokesmith , pray stay one moment .
His feelings are not like yours , <NAME> .
But I lay down , self-deceived , in that belief .
The matter is simply this .
We must spare nothing that will restore her .
I was wrong to expose a young man like you to this trial .
And an old dog is generally in their company .
At this rate they 'll be at it these seven years . ''
I am here with another object. ’ ‘ What can I do , child ?
Shall I loosen it for him , and make him more comfortable ?
Sometimes his eyes were open , sometimes closed .
I wonder at you , <NAME> .
‘ This home is gone from you and him .
‘ This is a longer-headed schemer than I thought him .
`` Trying to learn myself to read and write , '' said <NAME> .
‘ Bet-ter em-ployed ! ’ with another and the three nods added up .
I should not have known you , <NAME> .
‘ Have you no spirit at all ?
We were to stay a month at <NAME> 's .
‘ I have been much engaged lately .
<NAME> , I know what it is , <NAME> !
‘ <NAME> ’ t you hear the governor a-callin ’ ?
said the old lady , looking after him .
<NAME> and fear , pain and fear for me , alive or dead .
‘ Ladies -- dear ladies , ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> , you never saw such a face as he carried it with !
`` I am glad to hear you say so .
You do n't like <NAME> , I hope ?
It ’ s a capital little gipsy sort of place .
<NAME> , the boy went there to play .
The accused explained that the citizen was his first witness .
They were to gather fresh leaves and berries for her bed .
‘ Quite. ’ ‘ Glad of it , ’ said <NAME> .
`` I 'll have no more of your pipe-smokings and swaggerings .
What a delightful and magnificent entertainment , <NAME> ! ’ <NAME> laughed heartily .
`` Yes , '' said my guardian , nodding his head .
‘ Bless them eyes o ’ yourn ! ’ said <NAME> , looking up .
‘ It is them , ’ exclaimed <NAME> .
My mind was still running on some of the expressions used .
You perwerse creetur ! ’ exclaimed one of the vixenish ladies .
It is a term we use .
She can not , therefore , go too fast from <NAME> .
‘ Oysters , dear , ’ said <NAME> , timidly .
<NAME> <NAME> looked inquisitively in his face .
Everybody we had anything to do with seemed to cheat us .
She was in his room ; not in her own .
‘ There ’ s a friend , if you talk of friends !
`` It was at their house I was taken . ''
‘ There was great feasting at the castle , that day .
‘ Run to the justice ’ s ! ’ cried a dozen voices .
Such numbers of them too !
Oh , I ’ m so much obliged to you for this confidence !
‘ So I should think , ’ rejoined <NAME> drily .
He had sat there , awake , but dreaming .
Quite to settle here for a while , in short . ''
‘ I must go and break it to Mrs Boffin .
She ’ s married now , you know .
Godfather and godson do credit to one another .
That 's the kind of thing for _you_ .
But however , I ain ’ t going to fling mine away .
And we like 'em all the better for it , do n't we ? ''
It was two or three hours past midnight when I got home .
‘ <NAME> ’ t look there. ’ ‘ Why not ? ’ asked <NAME> .
‘ This is looking alive indeed ! ’ cried <NAME> , rising .
It was fastened on the inside .
‘ That was kind of me .
I have only come to justify myself .
'But what can I do ? '
the old lady angrily exclaimed .
‘ <NAME> , pooh , my dear Sir , impossible .
I will not detain you .
But this was nothing to me .
With which they requested a stamped receipt , and remained his obedient servants .
<NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , giving his hand to <NAME> .
Is he fit for the journey ? ” asked <NAME> .
<NAME> objected to any part of the plan .
‘ It ’ s all beautiful , <NAME> , in its regularity and order .
But <NAME> ’ s letter is plainer still .
‘ Good-looking , too ! ’ whispered <NAME> .
Some good and some bad goes , no doubt , to all callings .
‘ Perhaps not , ’ remarked <NAME> .
It is not likely that he has any new meaning in him to-night .
You have business before you ; useful business .
But what the <NAME> was I to do ?
I thought often of this , but I gave it up at last .
‘ <NAME> to -- ha -- to mountains , ’ said the Chief .
When she was brought back , his place was empty .
‘ You exactly hit it , ’ returned <NAME> .
<NAME> for her , then , and for me !
‘ I wish I had the ordering of his dreams , ’ said I .
anticipating some self-denying objection on his son 's part with a great air .
I duly observed the same .
‘ <NAME> ’ t tell me a lie , ’ retorted the schoolmaster .
`` I am not more sure of anything . ''
‘ Mama ! ’ They stood looking at each other .
said <NAME> , addressing her spouse .
Why do I speak of this to <NAME> ?
We can ’ t think of asking him , without asking <NAME> .
She was seated at her dressing-table , and looked round at us immediately .
I wish we could have had him buried in town .
They all expected a judgment .
Do I tell it , fur you to feel a obligation ?
‘ I hope you ’ ll keep so .
‘ On your way ? ’ replied his smiling brother .
‘ Tell him so , ’ retorted <NAME> , looking out of her apron .
You know me now , I am sure ?
I have watched her bringing-up , and I believe she is worthy of me .
They were hand in hand as usual .
A wild destiny for that mother to have foreseen !
A threatening , murderous , dangerous fellow . ''
'Not a farthing more , ' was the firm reply of <NAME> .
‘ Have I got all my traps ?
You have mentioned that , in your quarterly letters to me .
This is the public-ouse where I was took to . ''
Have you never been taught to associate <NAME> with property ?
Why , it was your doing , <NAME> .
This groom is the pilot-fish before the nobler shark .
‘ They ’ ll both come nat ’ ral in a minute .
I ’ m not a bit troubled now .
I was resolved that they should not .
I see him now , going away in custody , despised by the congregation .
But look here ! ’ <NAME> produced a bundle of keys .
‘ A very little one , ’ replied the small servant .
in a voice of sonorous complaint on the instant of his rising .
This appears to be a pleasant spot , miss . ''
Unquestionably Mrs <NAME> had an inventive genius .
Looking for Mr Dombey somewhere , I know .
<NAME> then , good-bye ! ’ Remonstrances were useless .
To all other intents and purposes he was alone in <NAME> ’ s Place .
The great majority were silent and still , looking fixedly at the ground .
`` And will he get this appointment ? ''
‘ And congratulating yourself on being up so soon ? ’ <NAME> nodded assent .
'Nothing , ' replied the woman ; 'it was a pawnbroker 's duplicate . '
`` Not quite a dead halt , I think .
`` Then , '' says <NAME> , `` let 's hear <NAME> .
‘ Down vith it ! ’ said <NAME> peremptorily .
That was all he thought of .
“ Oh ! ” said she to <NAME> .
I have returned what you see me .
I have never taken to either , since I was bound .
You 're a chattering clattering broomstick witch that ought to be burnt ! ''
He wanted somebody to look after <NAME> .
‘ It runs thus , ’ said the grave man , still more gravely .
said <NAME> , tossing the card contemptuously away with the newspaper .
‘ You approve , sir ? ’ ‘ Impossible not to approve .
<NAME> <NAME> was in a very abstracted and contemplative mood .
<NAME> to it ; for what I say I ’ ll do .
All the rest keep on doing , and let <NAME> keep on doing .
<NAME> stopped ; not at all disconcerted .
But he only filled his glass , and laughed in derision .
‘ You ought to have told me so before , ’ <NAME> complained .
And who should be with <NAME> , but Mr Lammle .
However , her temper was greatly improved , and she was patient .
My first wild thought had died away .
‘ I see her now ; I see her now !
Besides , it is in the way of trade .
cried <NAME> , his face brightening with pleasure .
But she is more than a mother to them ; ten times more .
‘ Roast pig ; let me see .
You won ’ t mind ? ’ with a gentle look .
`` He is obstinate , '' says <NAME> .
Wheel that table away , and place a chair there -- further off .
My answer was , that I had heard of the name .
‘ Who is it that you stare after ? ’ asked <NAME> .
‘ He ’ s my lawyer , <NAME> , of <NAME> ’ s <NAME> .
She instantly suppressed that manifestation , however , and became fixedly solemn .
Some other and pleasanter theme is in your mind .
And so I am , ’ said <NAME> , desperately .
My dear friend , your workman is very strong -- and very prompt .
I set this steadily before myself .
You 'd be as young as ever you was .
Listen to him ! ” cried the same scowling red-cap .
The people even praise me as the doctor 's wife .
said this strange young gentleman to <NAME> .
If you ca n't do anything better than that , cut off altogether .
She chooses you , <NAME> .
‘ Janet , ’ said my aunt , when her servant came in .
And will you have the goodness '' -- here <NAME> whispered in his ear .
<NAME> care of that , <NAME> , literally for <NAME> ’ s sake .
The dinner-hour arrived , and still he did not appear .
Dinner-time , and still no Hundreds of people .
They exemplify what I have said .
Would you like this room , sir ?
You see them in the act of passing ; they will be gone directly .
We have got <NAME> in this book .
‘ Why , of course I will !
‘ Just your old headlong way !
I am well , and your father has influence around me .
A solemn hush prevailed , as Mr <NAME> passed through the outer office .
This company wants a little fixing , _it_ does .
You can look without seeming to .
We may sleep to-night with light hearts , <NAME> ! ''
It appears , however , that <NAME> means five hundred .
Blows over the Surrey hills .
Light-hearted and unsuspicious as ever .
Even that is more probable to me , than the other event .
I remained there , I dare say , two hours .
'Have they done work , sir ? '
`` Are these your good men , my dears ? ''
Its special feature was a foregone family confidence and sympathy .
There is no despotism here ; that ’ s the great thing .
But it is , as I have told you , next to impossible .
A swift thought shot into his mind .
With <NAME> appeared <NAME> again .
' I recollect , ' said the undertaker .
I must not think of it .
I am the most deplorable wretch .
Still , it is a great pursuit .
I have overheard high words between you two .
We ’ ll go , as we came , directly it ’ s shut .
In like manner , his physiognomical expression seemed to teem with benignity .
`` Come , then , '' returned the nephew gaily .
<NAME> -- <NAME> -- rough and tough <NAME> J. , <NAME> .
It was a sombre day , and drops of chill rain fell at intervals .
The eyes , the head , the mouth ; every feature was the same .
Mrs MacStinger faded into nothing before it .
If anything , go on with it .
These were the schoolmaster , and the bachelor .
I am going ! ’ ‘ Not yet , not yet .
But I think she did not .
‘ Jist vot I told you , my boy , ’ rejoined his parent .
Who 's the <NAME> ? ” “ The spider ? ” said I .
I shall be here again in an hour .
Heavily for him , I mean .
She stood for some time at the bedside before she slowly moved away .
A kind of angry smile just dawns upon my <NAME> 's face .
The dinner-party was at the great <NAME> ’ s .
Why , of course it would .
What a study for an artist did that exciting scene present !
‘ Other people have dozens , scores , hundreds .
She seats herself beside him , ready to refill the pipe .
I drank to your papa .
In twelve hours she was very ill .
She not only sinned grievously against the <NAME> , but she wronged me .
‘ I come here just for a whim , ’ he said coolly .
quite well , and very happy ! ’ said <NAME> .
But Mrs. Gummidge was not the only person there who was unusually excited .
Again <NAME> said , `` Very much so . ''
Whether <NAME> is gone yet ?
<NAME> is not a particular case .
‘ Her husband _is_ an object to _me_ , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
“ <NAME> , if you wish to take something to eat , you can .
Get to bed. ’ <NAME> deserved Mr Alfred <NAME> ’ s eulogium .
No , I replied with the profoundest respect ; nor from him .
Is not this the same place twice over ?
`` Scratch you out of her will , I think you mean ? ''
Now , is not that reasonable ? ''
‘ I hope you may be unexpectedly detained , ma ’ am .
<NAME> was there , and <NAME> bark at me again .
“ ( How do you do , Pip ?
I will let it lie there , sir .
<NAME> is the best practice .
`` Just so , '' said <NAME> .
‘ It ’ s a serious injury , I suppose ? ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> coughed again , and slightly smiled .
But it is to such delights that <NAME> is hastening .
The <NAME> released his hold , and they rushed tumultuously from the room .
' I am , ' replied the Dodger .
‘ <NAME> , my Lord , ’ replied that gentleman .
‘ Oh , my friends , what but this did I tell you ?
Nothing at all to do with it .
Seeming would be quite enough : I ask no more .
Good-night , sir. ’ ‘ Stay , ’ said <NAME> earnestly .
The woman know what it is , does she ? '
Throwing open the doors , he followed , almost instantly .
‘ Whew ! ’ said Mr Meagles , dressing again .
He is a great reservoir of confidences , not to be so tapped .
There he sat , quite still and collected .
My husband , <NAME> , can conquer even your mother .
He remained in the same place during the whole fourteen years .
‘ <NAME> at <NAME> , ’ briefly responded <NAME> .
`` Still looking up at the window . ''
I have to insist upon a total change in all these respects .
Her mistress kisses her on the cheek and makes no other answer .
`` <NAME> , '' said the boy .
I ’ ll back you , my boy .
‘ For these and all other blessings , brother <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
The magistrate looked at <NAME> again , and beckoned <NAME> .
Perhaps he has chosen it .
'The first is , what may the communication be worth ? '
‘ Those were great times for the four-and-twenty ; but , alas !
`` That has nothing to do with it ! ''
Such manners too ; so playful , and yet so sewerely proper !
The <NAME> instantly ejected and excommunicated him ; but the thing was done .
`` This is <NAME> , '' said my guardian , evidently surprised .
‘ O <NAME> ! ’ said <NAME> , faintly .
‘ What is it ? ’ demanded <NAME> , becoming upright in his chair .
If I had him for my brother now ! ’ cried <NAME> .
That , he called with confidence on the jury to come and do likewise .
`` And when did mother die ?
I don ’ t think I am in the way of it .
Do you call this flat ?
“ Why , of course ! ” cried <NAME> , with an exultant face .
' A little of the wine ? '
`` They were presented to Mrs. <NAME> when she was in the <NAME> . ''
I can not keep them back .
I think I am in a happy dream .
To wound him through his own affections and fancies -- .
All things were as quiet in the Temple as ever I had seen them .
Heavily enough to oblige me to sell some trinkets .
<NAME> to <NAME> across the <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> ’ t keep on suspecting an innocent lad , <NAME> .
‘ He was nowt to me now .
‘ Is <NAME> in ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
“ Know that a petition was presented to the King and <NAME> .
`` What do you say , <NAME> ? ''
But as he looked , he softened to her , more and more .
“ I ain ’ t a-doin ’ nothing , ” said the child .
The dog looked up , and growled .
He beat me then , as if he would have beaten me to death .
‘ My dear child ! ’ he then panted , incoherently .
Gets treble the business of any man in court -- engaged in every case .
‘ You did , <NAME> ! ’ returned my mother .
She sat wrapped in her shawl , perfectly still .
Yet you ’ re always doing it .
<NAME> false to <NAME> , and Co to Pubsey ?
<NAME> ’ t judge me by a little thing like this , <NAME> .
‘ Mr Clennam , Mr Rugg , ’ said <NAME> .
'Sneaking in and out , so as nobody hears how you come or go !
It was beautifully clean inside , and as tidy as possible .
The Matthew whom <NAME> and Mrs. <NAME> had spoken of .
I don ’ t complain of you .
She has nothing to do with that , nothing to do with that .
He is not going back into the country , therefore , just yet .
Say I applaud her wisdom and admire her discretion. ’ I will .
So we sat down to cards .
Now , it was looking at the bottom of the door , and thinking .
( <NAME> , that the benefactor came to no good . )
'Denial to me is vain , ' replied <NAME> .
You may set me quite right .
A speck in the mist , at last !
This is not for you to inquire into .
I should like to see 'em . '
Upon my word , I am not so sure of it .
growled <NAME> , marking the tear which trembled in her eye .
But this the <NAME> said could not be done .
If you 're a religious woman , give me a irreligious one !
<NAME> appeared at the carriage-door , bearing the little insensible figure in his arms .
I suppose it will go in , one of these days .
But now you ’ re a universal mistruster .
<NAME> here till I return .
All this happened now , for the first time since their accession to wealth .
‘ I do not say that , ’ answered <NAME> .
One figure reposed upon the bed .
The schoolmaster heard her with astonishment .
If so , excuse my giving you unnecessary trouble .
<NAME> moved on , and <NAME> came up .
Now , tell this gentleman all that you told me ; and be particular .
And yet I don ’ t find business slack , or clients scrupulous .
But , my dear <NAME> , I have no art , no disguise .
Everything was gone , down to the little mirror with the oyster-shell frame .
‘ <NAME> , what ’ s the matter ? ’ ‘ Oh !
How well you look ! ’ <NAME> seemed to think so .
<NAME> there ever such a fright as he is ! ''
And thus we danced an hour by the clock .
‘ Besides , ’ said she , ‘ your digestion is nonsense .
Do n't you be afeerd on it .
<NAME> ’ s little store of trinkets became quite dazzling ; and for company !
It ai n't wery likely I should want him to be inkwhiched .
‘ O yes ! ’ Here Mrs <NAME> brought her handkerchief into play .
`` There you come back to <NAME> ! ''
“ I hope she will do well now , ” said <NAME> .
They ARE rather out of sorts .
I undertook to tell you on my way .
‘ I can ’ t help it , ’ replied <NAME> .
As to a fish-kittle , Mrs. <NAME> said , well !
‘ Oh DEAR ! ’ said <NAME> , ‘ I am SO sorry !
Not for the satisfaction of my injury .
‘ Shall I do it ? ’ said the schoolmaster .
Since his sheet-anchor had come home , <NAME> had been sparing of speech .
‘ _I_ am not dreaming , ’ said <NAME> , smiling .
The devoted <NAME> can not bear this treatment .
But he don ’ t know what ’ s good for him .
A light. ’ <NAME> got up , and gave him what he wanted .
said <NAME> , rising with the porter .
Draw the rose-coloured curtains close !
This was Carker the Manager .
The girl clearly comprehended it .
`` I have seen this in your face a long while . ''
It was the second in <NAME> ’ s week of suspense .
‘ All right , ’ replied <NAME> , in high glee .
‘ <NAME> does it , betwixt us .
Let him eat up every morsel .
I was rather alarmed again .
‘ No , sir , ’ said my aunt .
A slight frown and a laconic “ Yes , ” were the answer .
But that appears like casting such a man away . ''
Rather slack just now , <NAME> .
I have had it once before .
He thought of everybody ’ s claims and strivings , but his own .
‘ <NAME> before , <NAME> ? ’ <NAME> repeated in a tone of wonder .
‘ If you loved any one , all this feeling would change .
rejoined the man , administering another blow , and seizing <NAME> by the collar .
That he had long iron-gray hair .
I come to a question that may shorten the business .
Mr Toots ’ s eyes are red .
‘ And yet I don ’ t know .
Why can we not fly , my friends ? ''
`` Ask me no more , child ! ''
Had I ? ’ <NAME> made no reply .
Come and put this horse up .
You know you 're an orphan , I suppose ? '
<NAME> ’ t be afraid of that .
' I 'll swear he is not , ' replied <NAME> , warmly .
Bored out of the place , and going in for camels .
'No , my love , ' replied <NAME> , looking sadly back .
He throws himself upon his bed , and lies there abandoned to despair .
‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , once more .
'Well , it is a honour that is ! '
Not at present. ’ ‘ Go in for a tip , ’ she urged .
`` No , my dear , '' said I .
'His worship will be disengaged in half a minute .
<NAME> is my reward and doom .
I 'm worse than the chattering , clattering , brimstone pig at home ! ''
‘ Not at all , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
sneered the Jew , catching the boy by the arm .
I wish he had never been sent out .
<NAME> fell upon his knees , and clasped his hands before his face .
‘ What ’ s that ? ’ inquired Noggs , pointing to the parcel .
At supper , we were hardly so gay .
Let them be brought forward .
And as to that , they may live for ever .
<NAME> <NAME> , with a suppressed cry , threw her apron over her head .
I 'm old enough to be your grandfather .
`` Leave me to pass downstairs , great pig . ''
“ Good ! ” said the sleeper , rising on his elbow .
‘ Asks me if he is going ! ’ exclaimed <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> arrived within an hour afterwards .
Perhaps twenty people would be staking at the same time .
<NAME> and <NAME> , come here !
In other words , quite well of course .
I fear I _am_ ill , aunt . '
“ This is not at all the kind of thing for my voyage .
<NAME> <NAME> has never known this until now .
‘ You seem to like it , ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> ’ t you think we might do something for her ?
‘ Hurrah ! ’ shouted the mob , in conclusion .
I do not know how long she has been ill .
`` I do n't take kindly to the breed , '' said <NAME> .
‘ Not a bit on it , <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> .
<NAME> order , cleanliness , and comfort , pervaded every corner of the building .
I am long past that .
I thought it was a common quarrel . '
I have come this evening to explain it .
But that is not my motive .
‘ I would rather not do that either .
It was a beautiful night .
<NAME> ’ t let me detain you , Mr Wegg .
<NAME> <NAME> paused , and <NAME> snuffed the candle .
I thant undreth him , nor yet wath hith paint off .
‘ Very remarkable ! ’ thought Mr Swiveller .
But think of the whole Yard having got it .
‘ Like two young mavishes , ’ <NAME> said .
In this crouching attitude she watches him .
What , you 're looking at my lodger 's birds , Mr .
‘ Ay , with me , ’ replied the old gentleman .
‘ But here ’ s a lark ! ’ cries Deputy .
Our conversation turned on Ham .
I have come out myself to take him there .
‘ To be sure she is , ’ replied <NAME> .
`` I thought she had left this neighbourhood altogether , <NAME> . ''
‘ That would include the married ladies , you know , ’ said <NAME> .
I am much of the same mind myself . ''
She scarcely makes a stop , and sweeps upstairs alone .
I began to think there was more in the <NAME> than I had supposed .
<NAME> was out of the question .
<NAME> has dressed her , and is there to look at me .
Let no expense be a consideration .
With your permission I am going on .
What was they a doing in the <NAME> ?
The Father of the <NAME> in two or three Relations 20 .
-- To speak of ; none worth mentioning .
said the doctor , after a long silence .
`` Not a bit on it , '' said the strange man .
Mrs <NAME> hastened to spare the feelings of her afflicted friend .
‘ Are you a prig ? ’ ‘ N-no , ’ I said .
Because you are so strong .
‘ Oh , <NAME> ! ’ she remonstrated , with a smile .
But what I look at is this .
‘ Remember that you come near me at your peril , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ His acquaintance with <NAME> History too is surprising .
So he sat , with a steadfastly vacant gaze , pausing in his work .
Is she here ? ’ The young man became more interested .
looking at <NAME> , and retreating a pace or two .
We 'd have got something warm for supper . '
‘ Not much , ’ said <NAME> , slightingly .
‘ Oh , cruelly unjust ! ’ said <NAME> .
I ’ m very much obliged to you .
‘ Before I sit down , I wish to make an observation .
But look up yonder , <NAME> !
But he was early at the office next morning .
‘ Let some look to it .
Customers ? ’ ‘ Ay , ’ returned <NAME> , with a sigh .
`` Thank your ladyship , '' says <NAME> ; `` quite satisfactory .
A confused sound of voices , mingling with her dreams , awoke her .
`` <NAME> , will you ring ? ''
‘ But I am delighted to see you , ’ said <NAME> .
exclaimed the matron , 'what a very curious question from a single man .
In one of these , they stopped .
Why don ’ t they whip these creatures ?
I could not go beyond that , sir , without wronging some one .
And as he did like , I let him .
Do n't mind me now ; it 's all over for this once . '
<NAME> ! ’ exclaimed <NAME> , blushing as red as the watering-pot itself .
That there is a what ’ s-his-name -- a gulf -- opened between us .
`` I shall love it , as long as I live ! ''
Here I wait to see him and his daughter .
It ’ s a perfectly and equal transaction .
if you mind them young imps of boys— ’ <NAME> gruffly interrupts .
'Yes , sir ' ; replied the servant .
The change was made in me ; the thing was done .
<NAME> bless you , of no use to nobody ! ''
He was never even in the room .
It aggravates , and yet it soothes , the sorrow of the separation .
‘ Well done you ! ’ said <NAME> to himself .
`` Is that young woman mad ? ''
The bright , frosty day declined as they walked and spoke together .
Was it a five-pound note ?
It ’ s to be hoped she is not likely to hear of it .
You should sustain yourself better . ''
<NAME> ha ! ’ ‘ Oh certainly , ’ replied <NAME> .
‘ Where do you come from ?
`` He said that <NAME> was a humbug , as I live ! ''
Oh , it was a merry life !
Your father was gifted as few men are .
The surgeon leaned over the body , and raised the left hand .
She has been acting a part the whole time . ''
Nor yet lettin alone will never do ’ t .
Mrs Flintwinch goes on Dreaming 30 .
A strong , busy , active , honest-faced woman of from forty-five to fifty .
The boy answered that he had not yet quite worked out that little calculation .
I took her to myself when her character was scarcely formed .
What , you -- going to -- eh ? ’ stammered <NAME> .
' I was standing at a bookstall -- ' <NAME> began .
I congratulate you. ’ ‘ Thank you , <NAME> .
Which is he ? ” “ I am he .
Another difficulty that I have will seem very strange to you .
‘ And now you say the same of me !
The tea was made , and handed in silence .
‘ Now girl number twenty , ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> to tell , the supper had been waiting a most unreasonable time .
No , no , I know my sitiwation !
It haunts me day and night .
<NAME> delusion for <NAME> .
laughed <NAME> , as if he were relieved by even this concession .
I know I can trust to it for that .
Pressing business called me here .
“ You with a uncle too !
`` It did n't affect your appetite ?
They were the strangest pair at such a time that ever firelight shone upon .
‘ Except <NAME> ’ s enemies , ’ replied the bagman .
But , how much of the <NAME> ?
I must see Lorry. ” He stopped .
Crush them ! ’ With another repetition of the action .
They look at one another for a moment .
Go you to your kitchen , and keep there .
I accept her congratulations with gallantry and politeness .
‘ <NAME> was what done ? ’ moodily answered the son .
I fully intended to have done so .
‘ Ah , poor thing ! ’ replied Mrs. Sanders .
“ You know me , my dear friend ?
There was an anxious expression in them , but it cleared directly .
‘ <NAME> , sir ! ’ responded <NAME> , looking up .
I passed on to the gate and stooped down .
‘ A bachelor is a miserable wretch , sir , ’ said <NAME> .
Mrs General gravely inclined her head .
As she did so , I saw what happened and drew her back .
Oh , my eyes and limbs , what do you want ?
‘ <NAME> ’ was the authority for everything .
<NAME> ! ’ said <NAME> , with dread severity .
He rises ; she rises too .
The darkness also found Mr and <NAME> knocking at his door .
`` It might open a new world to him , '' said I .
‘ This morning , sir , ’ replied <NAME> .
I saw as plain as I see now , ’ was the answer .
He looks older than he is , as dark men often do .
`` Vholes will tell you so .
‘ If that is what you mean , I grant you that .
‘ The young lady ’ s considered the very picture of innocence and discretion .
`` Very good , '' said my guardian .
My fellow-citizen here would have it forty-two ; ten more heads are worth having .
‘ No , sir , ’ said Mr Dorrit .
' I 've got 'em , ' replied <NAME> .
‘ He has given his friends the slip .
‘ That ’ s fame , sir , ’ said the literary gentleman .
What could have divided you ?
I can ’ t say what I wish to say .
‘ He was here last night .
You han ’ t said what you want of me .
“ Magnificent ! ” croaked the man with the craving .
Of being madly hurried somewhere , whither he must go .
I should not have permitted it .
I ha ’ gotten decent fewtrils about me agen .
She feels the intention , and draws her hand back .
Oliver , more dead than alive , gasped out , 'Yes . '
There were many such on board the dear old <NAME> , I assure you .
‘ You ’ ll say that presently , ’ retorted <NAME> .
“ Do n't be afraid to hear me .
‘ I hope I have done right , ’ he said .
cried the <NAME> , stretching out its hand towards the city .
‘ Very good , indeed -- capital , ’ answered <NAME> .
<NAME> thinks he is writing letters in the library .
I am too wicked to write about myself !
‘ There , my dear ! ’ she said .
To which she answered ‘ Eigh sure !
<NAME> <NAME> immediately withdraws his eyes from her face and looks anywhere else .
“ No thanks to you in brown , if she does .
I thought then , growing uneasy , that I ought to write an answer .
That 's how he looked when we were tried together .
“ One , two , three , and now I am in for it .
The fellow erects a gate in the night .
I know these things have been done .
What do I call her for it ?
`` What should YOU be kept by yourself for ?
‘ Deuce a bit ! ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Well , <NAME> ’ en <NAME> ! ’ said <NAME> .
‘ No , I should hope not , indeed ! ’ returned my mother .
He thinks you young and innocent ; and so you are his friend .
It ’ s what you ought to do yourself !
His digestion is impaired , which is highly respectable .
There is great force in that .
The sister became a dancer .
<NAME> <NAME> also , if she will do me the favour . ''
'You know , you she devil ! '
`` And it comes to the same thing . ''
Change that cravat for this of mine , that coat for this of mine .
'Wipes , ' replied <NAME> ; at the same time producing four pocket-handkerchiefs .
He is not far out .
Of course , little <NAME> is not married yet ? ’ ‘ Not yet .
‘ Good ! ’ cries <NAME> , polite little gentleman that he is .
I waived that question , and returned to the <NAME> .
She whispered in his ear one short word of a single syllable .
'Yes , thank you , sir , ' replied <NAME> .
`` And she really never heard of the cause ! ''
You were walking along in the sun . ''
There was an end of the subject . ''
“ He had 'em stowed away somehows .
I am ready to do it . ''
I beg you to do this , for my peace . ''
‘ <NAME> ! ’ said <NAME> .
‘ I haven ’ t any notion of a lover .
His own child , his own child !
And went on sawing his wood .
The fatal accident had happened at a party of pleasure .
I never made a pretence to him or you that I loved him .
But has she any lover who is worthy of her ?
Mr Boffin is anxious on the subject .
“ All right , ” said the sergeant .
Grace having been said by the <NAME> , dinner began .
The officer who steered the galley gave the same account of their going overboard .
<NAME> that , I have nothing .
Nothing can undo it ; nothing can make it otherwise than as it was .
All these strings intertwining made Pancks a very cable of anchorage that night .
That 's what I estimate in a man in your way of business . ''
The dark young man says yes .
These are the two Jemmys .
To the very last , and even afterwards , her frown remained unsoftened .
He was the first boy who returned .
“ <NAME> , called <NAME> , ” was at length arraigned .
For , he was staring at them in the strangest way .
You are a terrible fellow , ’ returned <NAME> , airily .
We know you better. ’ ( As if this were a home-thrust . )
‘ Her eyes were decidedly red last night .
It is not necessary to quarrel with our right . ''
This is about a <NAME> particular NOW , ai n't it , miss ? ''
He had no thought for himself in this .
‘ Our faculties must not freeze with grief .
`` To bring you home , home , home ! ''
‘ Out of the vay , young leathers .
‘ Who ? ’ demanded Mr Flintwinch , with another screw at him .
It was very lucky it was only me . '
`` You are not free from the toils of the law yourself ! ''
What did we say of her ?
But what ’ s this ? ’ cried <NAME> .
And then , ‘ But why not ?
‘ I think not , my dear Dombey .
`` You are very pleasantly situated here ! ''
‘ Was I long in the water ?
The bedstead is much about my size .
Why should you allude to anything that is NOT a pleasant matter ?
‘ Oh , you dear -- ’ said Mrs. <NAME> .
‘ They all belong to monuments .
<NAME> is a great deal better .
and looking about and meeting <NAME> 's glance , again stretches out both hands .
He debated all this until he was tired ; and still no Bunsby .
It was really calculated to break his spirit , he said afterwards .
'By mine , ' replied <NAME> .
<NAME> was afraid of <NAME> .
here is the young gentleman .
‘ But really and truly , you know .
I am too far gone for that .
That ’ s the advantage of asking .
She calls you <NAME> , and she must know , being your sister .
Next morning , after breakfast , I entered on school life again .
This time he does not touch her .
My daughter <NAME> , Mr Dombey .
And that figure was her husband .
You are almost a man already. ’ ‘ Almost , ’ returned the child .
Get it filled next door -- <NAME> 's <NAME> -- the <NAME> 's fourteenpenny .
‘ To the <NAME> ? ’ asked <NAME> .
Not a doubt of it .
`` How has that contest gone ? ''
The lady was not proof against this burst of feeling .
‘ I like to look at her , ’ she breathed to herself .
You claim a right to ask me do I mean to tell you .
`` He is hiding at my place .
She is coming home with me the day after tomorrow .
`` And she was getting medicine for him , <NAME> ? ''
It is out of the question. ’ ‘ Mr .
‘ I dare say it will , ’ replied his friend dryly .
‘ And patient , <NAME> ? ’ I inquired , with a little hesitation .
I ’ ll not hear of it .
`` When will he awake from his delusion ! ''
‘ Why we were that wery moment a-speaking o ’ you .
‘ What is it ? ’ replied <NAME> .
More <NAME> Than One XXVIII .
“ Him ! ” says she , quite screeching .
‘ He is admirable , ’ replied the lady .
The firm are cut-throat Shepherds both , in appearance .
Let us say no more of that , for a few years to come .
( There is an ogreish kind of jocularity in <NAME> Smallweed to-day . )
No man 's life here is worth purchase .
How have I been conducting of myself ?
“ I salute you , citizen. ” This in passing .
Supported by a small subscription of the -- ha -- Collegiate body .
‘ Because you and I are very different people , ’ I returned .
No , Mr Clennam , don ’ t tell me so .
He had been thinking for hours .
‘ <NAME> down , ’ said <NAME> , cheerfully .
‘ Well enough ! ’ said Mr Slum .
‘ The attorneys for the plaintiff , ’ said <NAME> .
The one thing is not more unnatural than the other .
B. tougher than ever , and puffing his rich friend <NAME> wherever he went .
‘ He ’ s the <NAME> of <NAME> !
We lodged at a most excellent hotel , and were admirably served .
But <NAME> rose , to take leave for the night .
Thus , <NAME> in this vinous feature of his , until midday .
You are the gentleman of whom we have heard .
Let me out , I say ! '
‘ Half a minute , sir , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> up , sir ! ’ said the apothecary .
returns mademoiselle in a jocular strain .
Thus , when the boy returned , she was sleeping peacefully .
Is he much worn away ?
Both these young persons of distinction were something the worse for late hours .
The last man in the world .
‘ What a delightful young man ! ’ cried Mrs. Kenwigs .
He raised them , and saw her face .
If I say anything to give you pain , mama , forgive me .
There never was such a good fellow as <NAME> is .
Is he ? ’ ‘ Yes. ’ ‘ Allow me to be frank .
He stopped there , and faced round .
I am putting an extreme case , but it might be so .
Let him never put his head inside that door .
‘ But it was to be expected ; ’ thus she spake .
He must have committed it to memory , and slowly got it by heart .
‘ Oh , he ’ s lifted his-self off .
<NAME> , tell ‘ em to let <NAME> know -- and mother .
‘ This fellow , <NAME> , is monopolising your niece , ’ said <NAME> .
Just come into the corner of the wall and I 'll tell you ! ''
I take her sternly from the side of <NAME> .
My self-approval when I ticked an entry was quite a luxurious sensation .
Think you ’ re vinnin ’ a cup , sir .
‘ Send down word that he ’ s to spend the change in cigars .
‘ Oh dear , such a naughty Whisker ! ’ cried the old lady .
I could n't keep her away .
The society with which I mingled , was intelligent , courteous , and agreeable .
‘ What is there , <NAME> ? ’ said Mrs. Cluppins coaxingly .
<NAME> at the t ’ other scull gone .
It was quite true , as it soon appeared .
‘ <NAME> happy to see her , ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> ’ t be afraid to name it , man .
‘ He was in <NAME> a week before me .
`` I am very rich in hate .
`` Do n't you read or get read to ? ''
`` <NAME> really is my ward , '' said <NAME> .
`` He never spelt it out .
'The prosecutor was reading , was he ? '
It was a very bad night ; to which succeeded a very bad morning .
<NAME> go away from you ?
was the reply , accompanied with a scornful look .
His very hair seemed to sparkle as he roughened it .
I am a kind of example .
The trooper stands in the doorway , still and silent .
What <NAME> is , I need not say .
Ah now they wave it from the little boat .
`` That accounts for your pitching your voice so high .
He had not dreamed them .
‘ <NAME> , sir , ’ replied the waiter .
`` You ca n't speak too low .
‘ Who are they ? ’ whispered the landlord .
But he might have answered ‘ weary , weary !
If <NAME> were in his best humour , I checked him .
To you , nothing ; to me , all .
‘ I ain ’ t indeed , <NAME> , ’ whimpered <NAME> .
Mirrors were dim as with the breath of years .
‘ Of my old nurse , who has been dead a long time .
My poor bad , bad boy !
Now when the night came , he could not even persuade himself to undress .
<NAME> downstairs , little bag o ' bones . '
Do you think it ’ s enough ? ’ ‘ Thank you .
asked my guardian in a new tone of interest .
‘ Never let me hear of it again , ’ retorted <NAME> .
It 's business , and I do n't know business .
I am disgusted with my calling and with my life .
‘ She is , indeed ! ’ rejoined <NAME> .
' I never saw so many . '
Then , the old days before the second marriage rose up in his remembrance .
I said I would be careful not to do it .
‘ How can you ask such things , <NAME> !
You understand me ? ’ <NAME> replied in the affirmative .
<NAME> DRIVER ( to the horses ) .
Say this to my face !
Unless I greatly mistake , it is addressed to you ?
<NAME> no violence would be committed .
“ My father ! ” she called to him .
'He is always slow , ' remarked the old lady .
I squeeze among the crowd , and I look about me .
'It 'll be no sham frightening , mind you .
said the Jew , rubbing his hands .
I will not gainsay it , <NAME> .
I tell you what , <NAME> .
`` And what is THAT to me ? ''
He has some manuscript near him , but is not referring to it .
<NAME> <NAME> is one of these .
He 's as obstinate a young gonoph as I know .
Neither was she ever seen by human vision to go at a great pace .
I pass my days in court , my evenings and my nights here .
The more we listened , the more gaily <NAME> talked .
said Mrs. Badger , shaking her head .
He is away from town .
‘ They are known to him .
Of their appearance , I say nothing .
I assure you he would approve of anything you could say .
<NAME> on , got another , get a living by it ! ''
But never mind , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ never mind .
I was so brought up .
'Hold your noise , ' remonstrated the <NAME> , looking cautiously round .
<NAME> <NAME> nodded in the affirmative .
It has made them very happy .
Loose then stabbed <NAME> with one of those never-failing weapons , a bowie-knife .
‘ I feared you were ill , ’ she said .
<NAME> , my dear fellow , will you mention what we agreed upon ?
The distant smoke very black and heavy .
Would have sent in a card , but has none .
But the pupils -- the young noblemen !
What do you suppose me to be ?
<NAME> 's asleep , quite worn out .
“ I 'd have spent 'em on a Man , in wittles and drink .
‘ She ’ s living at a relation ’ s , far enough off .
Such are the evils of delay .
I like the sentiment of it .
J. M. ) D. , <NAME> and J. took airing in carriage .
‘ I wonder what they ’ ll give us !
I resolved to kill her .
There are conflicting opinions respecting the original of his picture .
The same that Mr <NAME> was at .
As if there were any other in his life !
‘ You are as strong and well as such little people usually are ?
It is the unfortunate destiny of <NAME> to damage a cause by espousing it .
But they wouldn ’ t laugh sometimes , and then father cried .
I demand -- I think it was a thousand pounds .
As if that honour would obliterate any remembrance !
‘ I bless the day ! ’ said <NAME> .
And to be sure it was very extraordinary .
Can you get the direction ?
‘ You know what I want ? ’ said my aunt .
Mrs. Chadband shakes her head .
I ’ m determined to forgive you .
At the little ceremonies of the bath and toilette , she assisted with enthusiasm .
What world does money belong to ?
By and by I went to my old glass .
Never mind ; wait and see .
He is always at it. ” “ At rum ? ” said I .
Here it is , written out .
<NAME> means or foul means , are all alike to me .
On conviction. ’ ‘ I am glad to hear it , ’ said <NAME> .
Now , it is of no use asking too much of me .
O Lord , he is very prompt !
‘ Your son , ’ replied <NAME> , ‘ chooses for himself .
It was a retired spot , on the borders of a little wood .
The principal pleasure of your life is to remind your family of their misfortunes .
Has he many creditors ? ’ ‘ Oh !
But certainly <NAME> admired him , as well as feared him .
He do n't get no iron rust here ! ” II .
A doll she had dressed lay near upon the ground .
Many men with families too .
'To sweep the cobwebs out of the sky . '
“ I do n't suffer it to be spoken of .
Is it possible for a dead man to have money ?
Still , something must be done .
I had no idea there was anything so attractive here . ''
<NAME> appeared to me to be an inquiry of unnecessary strength .
'Do you know this here voice , <NAME> ? '
Nothing. ’ ‘ Worse than nothing , I fancy , <NAME> .
‘ My father ’ s wery much in that line now .
`` And what are you crying for ? ''
“ Ah , my cherished ! ” cried The <NAME> ; and embraced her .
Whatever might befall now , he must on to his journey 's end .
They ’ ll tell you it ’ s your father .
This does not tend to the greater legibility of his notes .
‘ In this blessed Little Bethel , ’ returned her son , peevishly .
I found no pleasure in it , I expected none .
Not for many and many a day .
‘ Ah ! ’ exclaimed the old lady .
I thought <NAME> would know of it ! ’ he quietly returned .
‘ No more , ’ replied <NAME> .
When have you found me false to your teaching ?
‘ Joe it is ! ’ said <NAME> .
He asks to see him , my dear !
‘ It will be our turn to giggle soon .
`` For what is he in prison then ? ''
'What can I do for you , Mr .
‘ <NAME> was this done ? ’ asked the father .
And I did. ” “ More fool you , ” growled the other .
In the midst of which they went to supper .
<NAME> ideal picture of D. C. on verge of tomb .
‘ -- Dead , <NAME> ? ’ I hinted , after another respectful silence .
<NAME> says he wouldn ’ t have done it under twenty thousand pound .
We put each other to the torture there , <NAME> .
‘ He will be overjoyed to see you , my dear sir .
I am of the law .
‘ She shall have you , or I ’ ll know the reason why .
In the family there was an aunt who was not fond of me .
My son is getting on , <NAME> .
‘ The pain of parting is nothing to the joy of meeting again .
‘ <NAME> ’ r , my lad ! ’ said <NAME> .
Her retaliation was the most singular I could have imagined .
He was there secretly , and had not shown himself at the house .
Any unpleasant bygones between us are bygones , I hope .
Mrs <NAME> had observed it , and went on to take up the cue .
`` No , indeed , I have plenty in hand . ''
<NAME> care o ’ the archvay , gen ’ l ’ m ’ n .
'Are you fond of pictures , dear ? '
<NAME> ’ raps he ’ d resign if you disappinted him .
`` Is it not dangerous to sit in so exposed a place ? ''
cried <NAME> , at length perceiving what he meant .
`` And there 's not such another .
Suppose you were not satisfied with the <NAME> , what did you do then ?
See what they are and what thou art .
<NAME> , I wish your fathers and mothers had known my uncle .
She nodded several times , and her face became overcast and gloomy .
A nice business we made of it then !
‘ And an unreclaimable blaygaird , ’ added the gentleman in purple .
`` 'Sir <NAME> , <NAME> , ' '' <NAME> reads thoughtfully .
'We shall see , ' said <NAME> , checking his rising anger .
Get along with you , do ! ’ said my aunt .
It was the custom to beat a little track , and take exercise there .
You seem to have resolution and power enough to crush me .
Our way lies in very different directions .
‘ What can be the matter ? ’ ‘ Oh !
`` Give me some water or I shall cut my hand off . ''
You have been bred up in this country .
The only thing I ask of you in the world , my child !
How should he , when their possessors so seldom know themselves ?
Or would I have all the daughters at once in a perfect nosegay ?
I didn ’ t say much to her .
‘ Now , look at that lad , sir , ’ said the bachelor .
In return for which she kissed his watch-chain .
she repeats with fierce disdain .
‘ He went out and left me here .
‘ Nothing , sir ! ’ exclaimed <NAME> .
And looked down at his leg .
I must see what can be done .
The line ’ s breadth further , lay beyond .
<NAME> and freedom for you .
At this meal they arranged their daily habits .
‘ This is a glass. ’ <NAME> saw that too .
You find me just going .
Nicholas feared he had offended him .
‘ Yes , ’ said the collector ; ‘ certainly .
<NAME> warmed himself at the fire .
All this I undertake to show .
He came here twice , and asked for you .
‘ Then , good-morning , sir , ’ said <NAME> , angrily .
Under those circumstances even , I do not offer my testimony .
You shall leave me -- hum -- the whole establishment shall leave me .
Why we swarm with ‘ em .
‘ Reduced counsels , I s ’ pose , ’ replied <NAME> .
Mr <NAME> sat silent , and looked at the table-cloth .
‘ You need not fear me , ’ said <NAME> kindly .
Commotion in the office of the hotel .
I can set it to music .
Let our brother <NAME> and his wife have their society .
I observe you are more astonished at present .
‘ Oh , won ’ t she though , father ? ’ replied <NAME> .
`` Where are you going to take my mother , Mrs .
You could hardly have expected mine. ’ ‘ I did not expect any .
You have done so well to-day , <NAME> , that you must be tired .
This time , he was entirely changed .
‘ You had better take some rest , ’ returned <NAME> .
<NAME> , I have been mistaken in you .
In their housekeeping they were penurious in the extreme .
I had not been drinking , you understand .
You see where the little feet went bare upon the ground .
It showed the little parlour to be dingy , but orderly and clean .
<NAME> , however , moving to me , I moved to Kimber .
<NAME> and unreal in the moonlight , the river floated them away .
Gentlemen , how does the case stand , upon the present occasion ?
A thousand Miss <NAME> haunted me .
It don ’ t matter how much ; enough to live on .
Do you call that confidence , my love , towards <NAME> ?
`` Out , you silly little puss ! ''
The schoolmaster was willing to undertake the charge of such a pupil .
The room they turned into was even more odd-looking than the porch .
I was curious to find out next morning , whether she had been .
Oh , if they had only been to me ! )
He is not to be blamed for being in need , poor love .
It 's a great deal for what he has done . ''
His condition was that of a young gentleman .
‘ God bless my soul ! ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> sat down in the window .
‘ Just so , ’ returned Mrs. Micawber , ‘ It is precisely that .
I must finish my record to-day .
I ventured to ask him .
‘ He used to draw my couch .
Here is my friend <NAME> 's excellent house .
replied <NAME> , drawing a chair towards the fire .
I can not tell him very well .
No , it was not to be borne .
‘ Then do so at once , sir , ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> solitary , and the <NAME> mysterious 24 .
‘ Let him have hospitals , because they ’ re so comfortable .
Two or three miles more , and the cart stopped .
That was but natural curiosity .
Even the sky itself was changed , and had an execution in it plainly .
I shall never take advantage of it . ''
'Why , what 's the matter with the boy ! '
‘ We will make an example of half a dozen Slackbridges .
‘ Somebody ’ s a-tappin ’ at the door , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ When you say that , no further inquiries are needed .
'Do n't hurt him , ' said the old gentleman , compassionately .
‘ Cause I see him do it , ’ said <NAME> .
I practised in the trenches .
How well you do look to be sure !
We ’ re patient too , an ’ wants in general to do right .
It shall not be lost .
She was there , sitting beside her father .
‘ No , I didn ’ t , ’ replied <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> it with the muzzle to the ground , ’ replied <NAME> .
I derived that , from the look they interchanged .
And a Still-born <NAME> ; four to me .
He hardly knew his wife .
“ Do you see him ? ” pursued my convict .
I swear to you , you shall go alone .
<NAME> -- '' <NAME> stops his hand .
Shall I ever forget those lessons !
`` I was quite well but a moment ago , <NAME> . ''
With only one ; but that one certainly involving much .
And yet it did trouble him .
I hope we dine together ? ’ ‘ With pleasure , ’ replied <NAME> .
What are they to me !
`` Only for their steps , '' said <NAME> .
‘ Ought to ha ’ know ’ d better !
`` My instructions do n't go to that , '' replies the constable .
That boy , <NAME> , is not a common production .
‘ The halfpenny be demd , ’ said <NAME> , impatiently .
And so was this one ’ s .
‘ Instead of that , he ’ ll now have all .
<NAME> , the wife of <NAME> ; is it not ? ” It is .
‘ Perhaps you were too jealous , or too hasty with him ?
You may leave the room . '
‘ Well , gentlemen , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Should I -- should I -- tell me that again .
'To-morrow morning , ' replied <NAME> .
We had half-an-hour , I think , for tea .
From the community it is hidden .
O my child has been such a bad , bad child of late !
there ’ s no help for it , I suppose , ’ said <NAME> .
I thank you very gratefully .
‘ How long you have been ! ’ said <NAME> .
‘ So bad as that ! ’ cried <NAME> .
That is the great question .
That ’ s four years and a half -- four years and a half .
‘ <NAME> ! ’ said the little old man .
He never used to go there .
Further Adventures of <NAME> <NAME> , <NAME> 40 .
My reputation stands quite high , and would be a shield for yours .
`` Why do you doubt your senses ? ''
He wore a man 's coat , which reached nearly to his heels .
You have chambers ? ’ said I .
'Wery pretty indeed it is , ' remarked <NAME> , in an undertone .
Or are you in the same mind ? ''
‘ It ’ s nothing to you what ’ s the matter .
‘ Give us a description , sir .
Why did n't you write , my dear , and say you were coming ?
I was the happiest of the happy .
There he stands , you see .
It 's all right , it 's all true , it all happened .
‘ <NAME> ! ’ coughed <NAME> interrogatively .
and having made this obliging promise , the voice began to whistle .
You see the millstone that he is about my neck .
I shall be gone before you wake in the morning .
The old conspiracy to make me happy !
whispered <NAME> , not thinking she could hear him .
I must pause yet once again .
‘ And that ’ s very true , ’ said the placid one .
`` Make your cat go down .
We were very happy. ’ ‘ We were , indeed , ’ said I .
I should always love her , every minute , to distraction .
<NAME> and <NAME> might have married on the same speculation .
You can do nothing worse to me than you have done .
A little reserved at times ; but I will say extremely gentlemanly .
I have set it down too soon , perhaps .
‘ There goes your pet , <NAME> , eh ? ’ ‘ Ah !
To any death that could have been invented .
“ Very interesting remembrances ! ” said the spy .
`` Then <NAME> is not come in yet ? ''
‘ Yes , <NAME> , ’ says <NAME> .
He hasn ’ t been himself since you ’ ve been gone .
What is the letter that she holds ?
'And about what I was saying , my dear ? '
`` Oh , my dear , '' he returned with a hopeless gesture .
‘ Where have you put my friend , <NAME> ? ’ said <NAME> .
What is it that I tell you ?
<NAME> ’ t mind what I said .
Her daughter had no information on that point .
Let there be nothing amiss , and the question is superfluous .
“ It was you , villain , ” said I .
Many a day did <NAME> thoughtfully observe these children .
That sets me off again !
In the wake , appeared <NAME> ’ s boy , bearing umbrellas .
You owned to an old admiration of her .
'Carry that in one hand .
The night was dark and foggy .
‘ What end ? ’ I asked , possessed by my former fear .
‘ What have you been doing ?
`` How should I know why ?
Not one of them letters was ever delivered to <NAME> ’ ard <NAME> .
I believe the theme of this incomprehensible conundrum was the moon .
<NAME> for what you made him ; not for your love .
Now , she began burning blue-lights .
<NAME> Leicester rises from his chair and staggers down again .
''Cause it is n't on the rec-ord , is it ? '
`` I hope you are the same . ''
Not bodily so much as nervous , nervous !
From your own lips , let me hear it ! '
replied <NAME> ; with a tremendous oath .
The culprit falters excuses , and professes a determination to do better tomorrow .
The lady turned her head .
‘ I giv the promise to <NAME> ’ ly , afore I come away .
My reflections on this theme were still in progress when dinner was announced .
It was closed and dark .
I do n't say but what he 's as free as ever .
You are a brimstone pig .
ask if it was bloody .
Then it was too late. ’ ‘ Too late , indeed , <NAME> .
'Cept a centre-bit and a boy .
Much obliged to you , <NAME> .
I know nobody here , and nobody knows me .
<NAME> gave an anxious glance at <NAME> but said nothing .
'You know what became of them . '
The other presided over the ROUGE-ET-NOIR table .
If <NAME> was not the thief , let him show himself .
What you must always appeal to , is a person ’ s self-interest .
`` What are you doing here ?
Of being parched and giddy , and half mad .
‘ What was it that you asked me ?
Many half-forgotten emotions were awakened in the sister ’ s mind by this visit .
He visits his old chief sometimes , but seldom .
' A new pal , ' replied <NAME> , pulling <NAME> forward .
Let <NAME> get ready for HIS fate , when that comes about .
‘ Accordingly , ’ resumed Mr Toots , ‘ I acted on my own .
'How do yer see that ? '
‘ A wild evening , <NAME> !
what do you mean , sir ? ’ was the tart rejoinder .
They looked fearfully about them , without moving , but could see nothing more .
“ <NAME> , <NAME> , ” said he ; “ how do you do ?
The interval afforded time for <NAME> to be announced .
It 's a system of harmony , in short .
`` Left it to his company , perhaps .
Many captives were brought to me in this way .
‘ What a pretty little <NAME> ! ’ cried <NAME> .
They have long been audible to the younger ears of her companion .
<NAME> twice , before it goes over you .
' I am not , ' replied <NAME> , greatly alarmed .
I have very little reason to be proud , and I am not proud .
But you changed to me a little , shortly before you left home .
said he in his pleasant voice .
Any one carried home by the people to-day , may be condemned tomorrow .
The coroner 's jury found that he took the poison accidentally . ''
‘ Make no further visits to the girl in the meantime .
Forty teeth , namely twenty-four grinders , four eye-teeth , and twelve incisive .
‘ I couldn ’ t doubt it , when you told me so .
A lame foreigner with a stick. ’ ‘ Ay , ay .
It happens , unfortunately , that that single blemish is a want of taste .
It is necessary that I should proceed in this .
‘ How can we ever show ourselves in society ! ’ said <NAME> .
Friends came forward and paid it all up , honourable . ''
For , that had been his term .
A little , muscular , brown man , with black hair and white teeth .
Or at least -- but it do n't matter .
‘ Look at the <NAME> !
‘ Let it lie there , father .
He constrains himself to touch him .
My thanks and duty to <NAME> and <NAME> .
'She hesitates , I am sure . '
He was so composed , that I fancied he must have some other meaning .
Where are you going <NAME> ?
‘ Why not ? ’ asked <NAME> , in reply .
I could barely show her my letter .
`` At work so late , my dear ? ''
He manifestly objected to communicate with Mr <NAME> ’ s solicitor .
How much of futurity did _he_ see ?
Her name was <NAME> .
We can give <NAME> seventy-two , sir , if it would be preferred .
It was now summer-time ; a grey , hot , dusty evening .
I am obliged to you for the temporary accommodation .
‘ Get on your bonnet , ’ repeated <NAME> .
There , the report was , <NAME> away , and Mrs. Bounderby in town .
There were sad hearts at <NAME> 's that night .
‘ Bof -- fin ! ’ he called through the keyhole .
Where are the sentiments of my heart ?
And at length the great day arrived .
“ Therese. ” “ Louder , ” the woman recommends .
‘ <NAME> my cloak to dry there by the door .
He is always vigilant and always near me .
All that can be acquired , he has acquired .
'Not _you_ , ' replied <NAME> , sharply .
I ’ ll bring them together , boy .
There was an absence of the finer touches of humanity in it !
`` But that 's taking trouble , surely .
‘ Now , ’ said the milkman to a very youthful servant girl .
We must learn to act the play out .
<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> partook , in their way , of my joy .
`` <NAME> 's shop , left hand side , name of <NAME> . ''
‘ The old man was ghastly pale .
<NAME> was a light sleeper and started up directly .
How I treasured up the entries , of which I subjoin a sample -- !
What a discreet pony when he chooses !
The poor , benighted innocent had never seen such a man .
‘ Yes , sir , ’ rejoined the waiter .
‘ I never , never , never was so used ! ’ she sobbed .
They were putting up the scaffold .
At this command , or by this gracious permission , the lesson went on .
<NAME> , to this wretched hour I am ignorant of both .
'The promise shall be kept .
‘ He ain ’ t been here this many a long day .
`` Shall I call him down ?
They both involuntarily darted to the door , as <NAME> entered .
‘ My dear <NAME> ! ’ exclaimed Mr Dorrit faintly .
`` Yes , commander , I took the business .
This was so far convincing .
‘ Stuff and nonsense , <NAME> ! ’ replied my aunt .
<NAME> , you honest tradesman , it would n't suit _your_ line of business !
Come to the pump. ’ They adjourned to the pump .
I recollect this lad some time ago being brought before the coroner . ''
‘ Then he is well now ? ’ said the Secretary .
Footsteps in the stone passage outside the door .
You are as bad as they were , every bit .
<NAME> , with his right hand in his breast , stood close beside him .
Hardly a night passed without my dreaming of it .
He ’ s a going out with the tide .
‘ I am lost , if you please ! ’ said <NAME> .
‘ There , ’ said <NAME> , turning to his noble friend .
You really ought to see their gold and silver camels .
There was no flinching about the girl .
I am not sure why you may ha ’ come that night .
I will speak plainer , if you wish it .
It ’ s a surplice , that ’ s what it is .
I know I was too young and foolish .
Besides , I shall be one-and-twenty in no time almost .
There is inquiry made at various houses for a boy named Jo .
Only you do put me out so .
‘ I merely refer to my visits , which are few and far between .
‘ I shall go back in an omnibus .
‘ I don ’ t ask about him .
Give him the chances of the time .
‘ <NAME> ? ’ said <NAME> , shaking her head .
‘ Pray allow me , ’ said Mr Dombey .
So he said it , and the paper burned away .
Will you not speak to me ? ''
`` Dining at his expense , <NAME> ? ''
Would my Lady wish to see him ?
`` I do n't see it myself . ''
End of the <NAME> EBook of The <NAME> , by <NAME>
‘ Most extraordinary female this , ’ thought <NAME> , popping in again .
‘ Believe me , I have held myself aloof , and kept alone .
Their delicacy is not to be shocked , or hurt easily .
And oh do please make haste , because it ’ s of consequence .
Her letter was hopeful , earnest , and cheerful .
The house seems to have been violently entered when <NAME> was out .
You are men of honour , and have feeling hearts .
Still , no violent rupture took place .
‘ We must take care of the names .
‘ Excuse our troubling you , ’ said <NAME> .
'Tell <NAME> at once , about <NAME> ! '
Mrs Wickam often said she never see a dear so put upon .
All this together has been too much for her .
Mr Dombey and the world are alone together .
Now , how does it strike you ?
Not a hand like that . ''
‘ <NAME> has flown over to the <NAME> for supper .
The latter mode of pronunciation is perhaps the most in favour .
One instant , and it would have beat against his breast .
I knew when I said it , it was all lies .
But , as that year wore on , <NAME> was not strong .
‘ It doesn ’ t matter , ’ returned Mr Dombey .
In these , the better kind of paupers live .
‘ Because I told her. ’ ‘ Ay , ’ replied <NAME> .
This was a favourite mistress with the poor pupil .
says <NAME> , giving him his hand .
when the entrance of the gentlemen consigned him to the tomb .
Our friend the <NAME> , ” said <NAME> , “ has played his cards .
I have brought it myself , guardian , '' I returned .
There is no sound , but other prisoners may be near for all that .
Three pint pots of half-and-half are superadded .
Beg your pardon , learned governor !
None of her relations may .
I reckon that ’ s Judge <NAME> , an ’ t it ?
‘ Nor prepossessing then ? ’ said <NAME> .
Perhaps it drew him on to look in .
I do n't feel any vulgar gratitude to you .
Quit them all , while there is time and opportunity ! '
‘ You let my mother alone , will you ? ’ said <NAME> .
So the quarrel goes on to the satisfaction of both .
Standing beside it , I count these slumbering passengers , and get past forty .
I don ’ t , and that ’ s a fact .
Then she came out , and took a seat beside me .
Why don ’ t you go and do it ?
`` I am quite at your service . ''
What is it that we call it in our grandiose speeches ?
Oh , let me learn from you how to become dearer to <NAME> me !
‘ To the lady , sir , ’ <NAME> answered , laughing .
'No , she wo n't , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
`` I know it very well , '' said I .
I ’ ll walk into the next room here .
‘ Has <NAME> been back ? ’ said Mrs. Weller .
‘ Here he is ! ’ said <NAME> .
‘ I thought <NAME> might like to know , that ’ s all .
Do no more than look at me , and listen to me .
Do n't distress yourself ; it 's of no use .
<NAME> was evidently giving way .
The two gentlemen hastily separated ; each in a fever of excitement wholly uncontrollable .
‘ There is nothing left out .
He winds it up with another `` Your servant , sir ! ''
It was only rain , beginning to fall fast , in heavy drops .
My heart is linked to yours .
It matters very little now .
The ghost of a cry .
Here 's old <NAME> , bless your eyes .
‘ No more you never ought to , my dear , ’ replied <NAME> .
‘ You are impatient , sir , ’ said <NAME> .
Women understand women , ’ said her husband , rather disappointed .
‘ You can afford to say so , ’ returned <NAME> .
‘ And good-bye , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ The <NAME> and <NAME> has not been spoken , ’ returned <NAME> .
`` It 's probable he wull have been dead aboot three hours . ''
‘ She is very clever , is she not ? ’ I asked .
He had not reckoned on their seeking his name , or <NAME> ’ s .
Let me again say , there is no cause for the least alarm .
She answered not one word .
It has been said that I treated <NAME> with cruelty .
‘ It ’ s very easy to talk , ’ said Mrs. Mantalini .
‘ Old enough to be his grandfather , you willin !
`` Yet you have a large establishment , too , I am told ? ''
All this passed in a few seconds .
He breathed heavily , but in all other respects was motionless .
‘ You can , ’ replied <NAME> .
They were timid , but on the whole disposed to attach themselves to me .
‘ I will not have it .
`` And what is he to do then ? ''
‘ Dear fellow , I am wandering away .
Do me the justice to remember the condition .
Then I won ’ t give it you .
`` ) , he pinched me and said , `` Oh , then !
Still there was no answer , and I knocked again .
The old man turned aside and muttered to himself before he drank .
They were succeeded by a gentle tap at the door .
Remember the danger to which you are exposed .
‘ But , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ that is over .
Do you think so now ? '
‘ Hallo ! ’ said my aunt , after a long time .
That is the proper document , <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> quite well ? ''
<NAME> , scarcely better ; splashed to their very blinkers .
There are pen and ink and paper on this table .
He had great confidence in my opinion , and what did I think ?
‘ I hope not , ’ said <NAME> .
I think I ’ ll give ‘ em a treat here .
I shall be happy to set you down , or send you on .
‘ Do you know how he is tonight ? ’ I asked .
I felt as if she challenged him to run away .
‘ Two inside , and one out .
The well-worn wooden stool was ‘ beyond him , ’ he complained .
Just so , '' repeats <NAME> .
<NAME> has nothing to do with them .
‘ Who is this man , <NAME> ? ’ said the magistrate .
said I , taking the woman aside .
I was waiting in the court-yard for <NAME> when she came out .
‘ I shall go as a bandit , ’ interposed <NAME> .
The landlord was sent , and came .
<NAME> anxiety and remorse are bad companions to be barred up with .
'These women at least shall continue to respect the prerogative .
`` If you please , he told <NAME> that ! ''
<NAME> was before it , and is before it . ''
It will pass over very soon .
However , he had thought proper to do otherwise , and <NAME> was outrageous .
‘ <NAME> is twenty-seven , my good fellow ? ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Who ’ s that yonder ? ’ he said .
Weary with watching and anxiety , he at length fell asleep .
A great deal of steam !
Could it by any means be that , I wondered !
<NAME> <NAME> and Pa aboard an early steamboat for <NAME> .
Oh , he was early there .
You went to-day , then , <NAME> ? ''
<NAME> and I looked at one another again .
‘ What a thorough-paced goer he used to be sure-ly !
`` I get , '' he repeated gloomily , `` so tired .
‘ Past seven , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
Still that don ’ t make it right to let him have his way .
`` He is such a cheery fellow .
Where ’ s there a fire ? ’ demanded the schoolmaster , sharply .
‘ A hundred and fifty odd pound , ’ resumed <NAME> .
But you surprised and started me from my subject , which was your brother .
I took out <NAME> 's letter and put it in his hand .
But , ’ said Mr Chuckster , ‘ I ’ m not meek .
The realization of my boyish day-dreams is at hand .
‘ All taut and trim here .
`` But more persuadable we can , I hope , '' said I .
I gave it to him .
How has society respected those qualities in me ?
‘ Pickwick ! ’ said the old gentleman .
He stopped , as a last test ; and they all stopped .
<NAME> was to go to the wedding .
asked <NAME> , a little recovering .
‘ Did it change her much ? ’ we asked .
I am wholly unacquainted with it .
I incautiously gave a qualified assent to this .
Meanwhile the round game proceeded right merrily .
'Nobody but me , ' replied the child .
What have you been pouring out of window ? ''
‘ What ’ s amiss , dame ? ’ said <NAME> .
In shrinking from it , she shrinks into her seat again .
‘ Only in the kitchen , sir , ’ replied the boy .
<NAME> , I am a professional man .
Like <NAME> , your father , the gentleman was of repute in <NAME> .
How I have been rattling on !
The address , turned into <NAME> , ran : “ Very pressing .
You don ’ t blame me for requesting that <NAME> might not be present .
‘ Are you satisfied ? ’ <NAME> inquired of <NAME> .
‘ THE greatest blessing , ’ said <NAME> , correcting himself .
I ’ d far better be a walking than a getting numbed and dreary .
The disclosure must be made .
He walked up and down , softly repeating their names to himself .
In short , I should make that choice .
Behold the manner of it .
‘ I AM at home , young gentleman , ’ returned the dwarf .
' I meant no harm , young man , ' observed <NAME> , majestically .
I can admire her without envy .
If you have , do n't expect me to keep your secret .
Tell me when to fire .
Looking down at her face , his eye meets hers , and he stops .
In a word , they were all very well pleased .
<NAME> <NAME> , perhaps , is better . ''
He is reserved and serious , which is another mark of respectability .
If such a wind could rise , I think it was rising .
You 're beginning to get more yourself now , ai n't you ? ''
When my temper comes upon me , I am mad .
<NAME> <NAME> gave a guinea , and the follerers made up a little purse .
Remember that ! ’ ‘ I ’ m witness , ’ returned <NAME> .
‘ Why , sir , his father giv it him , ’ said <NAME> .
Her bright quick eye catches the truth directly .
The hum from the streets , likewise , seems to swell into a shout .
<NAME> replied in the affirmative .
They are the finest people in the world , these fellows are .
You mean it ’ s not ! ’ returned <NAME> .
That he should succeed , was no matter of surprise to me .
'Then what do you talk of ? '
‘ Exactly so , ’ replied <NAME> , ‘ all to be earned .
I am a fortune-teller. ’ <NAME> now began to think he was mad .
You are honouring me with your attention ? ''
says <NAME> , turning his head in that direction .
Early in the morning I was to go .
I knew I could rely upon you .
But not in your way .
Your position , as my brother , is a very fine one .
This momentous pocket-book was a timely reminder to him of another transaction .
<NAME> care of this poor cold hand , <NAME> .
<NAME> bent over his loom , quiet , watchful , and steady .
Having thought a bit , he looked up again and resumed .
‘ Of course not , ’ replied <NAME> .
I was not aware that you were here , <NAME> . ''
<NAME> and enchanted to show him many .
‘ <NAME> good -- devilish good , ’ said the Seidlitz-powder man .
Where were the traces of her early cares , her sufferings , and fatigues ?
Is there anything I can do for you here ?
`` Had he committed any crime ? ''
She went on a long way .
Her infant was a boy too .
‘ That the said proposal has received the sanction and approval of this Association .
Indeed , you may be sure that is the truth .
‘ Practice ? ’ said <NAME> , pointing to the stilts .
<NAME> upon it he 's a safe one , <NAME> . '
Few Englishmen are prepared to find it what it is .
And the lark was never gayer than that excellent woman .
This was market-day , and Mrs. <NAME> was out on one of these expeditions .
‘ Now the sooner we ’ re off the better .
‘ What cheer , my pretty ? ’ said the <NAME> .
‘ Not a word of it .
What ? ’ cried <NAME> , with a face of terror .
The night was particularly dark and it rained hard .
I must hope that he will let me thank him some day .
I shall then go engineering into the <NAME> , and <NAME> with me .
‘ That ’ s the way with ‘ em all .
He does it on purpose .
We certainly must have a quarrel with <NAME> , ’ said the other .
I ’ ll talk to you presently. ’ ‘ Mr .
She chooses as we , her dearest friends , would have her choose .
She says I waltz so well !
He admires the size of the edifice and wonders what it 's all about .
`` Here is a new game , '' said <NAME> .
Let ’ s have no pretending that you discharge yourself .
I have always feared that I should tell it you in vain .
He went to the house in town .
But he has his revenge .
`` You 'd like to see the room , young man ? ''
He had a wild , hungry eye ; and they implicitly believed him .
he says when <NAME> has nearly disappeared .
I did it in a moment .
It is such a conventional superstition , such parrot gabble !
But I -- you wo n't think me premature if I mention it ? ''
“ Wa ’ at ’ s the matter ? ” says I .
Up to mischief , I ’ ll be bound .
They had not been at home many hours , when he presented himself .
I am again with <NAME> , in our cottage .
The ladies are singularly beautiful .
He set forth the table for his own dignity .
The shadows of night were gathering , and all was still .
The <NAME> , also , highly approved .
‘ Of all others ! -- a hated rival !
<NAME> on a blood mare .
As often as the boy resumed , <NAME> resumed his fixed face .
It was a very transparent business , that meeting as cousins only .
What did it matter , she said still .
<NAME> of <NAME> , thy childish essence was from God !
We went on again , picking up shells and pebbles .
`` Did you imply that he has children of his own , sir ? ''
<NAME> then came undesignedly sidling in the direction of the sideboard .
Several weeks elapsed before I saw the least change in her .
Book the Third -- the Track of a Storm I .
But in that moment <NAME> started up with a suppressed cry .
`` <NAME> and me knows it full well . ''
Three pair , if you please .
I shall get off the stone an hour arter daybreak .
On the following evening I went into <NAME> in quest of him .
‘ Supposing she was tender-hearted , and they came over her .
It was time to finish him .
Escaped. ” Administering the definition like Tar-water .
The people had all poured out to the show in the streets .
<NAME> has been crying and is yet in distress .
So did I too , for that matter .
Nothing more so , my dear Sir , nothing .
The very basket that you slept in , the tide washed ashore .
No idea of retort upon his cruel brother came into his mind .
<NAME> <NAME> is a boarder at the <NAME> ’ establishment .
The plain breakfast made a cheerful show , and <NAME> was perfectly charming .
We swept on , and I felt that I was highly obnoxious to <NAME> .
Her little family too , and <NAME> ?
Never mind so long as you are come , '' said Mrs. Cratchit .
And then we contemplated one another afresh , and laughed again .
‘ Dear little Dombey ! ’ murmured <NAME> .
A thousand thanks for the permission .
Yes , <NAME> , it ’ s all very well for _you_ .
But I said he had looked very nice .
I could n't tell till I tried .
`` That , '' said <NAME> , `` makes matters easier .
I neither worked nor thought any more that night .
and so you shall find <NAME> , so you shall find .
You 'll know where to find me !
‘ Now , <NAME> , ’ said Mr Dombey .
<NAME> <NAME> goes to his gatehouse , brooding .
`` Would it apply to any kind of dinner on this day ? ''
It is thoughtful , gloomy , concentrated .
If anybody ought to be indignant , who is it ?
`` And there you are , my partner , eh ? ''
Mr <NAME> had met with an accident in riding .
‘ Not you ! ’ returned <NAME> , with a cunning look .
`` It looks as if it was born yesterday . ''
Keep me here a few moments , <NAME> .
The patient had raised herself upright , and was stretching her arms towards them .
‘ But no , that can never be !
It ’ s because you are like no one else .
I tried coaxing , and coaxing failed .
I mean it , and I had better say it at once .
You are worse than a child .
‘ Shall we walk together ? ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> 's conduct on being left to himself , was rather inexplicable .
`` Merely to say so , your ladyship . ''
Then , propitiatingly and crawlingly : ‘ You sir !
There ’ s a dog in the lane .
‘ Not tonight , sir , but it ’ s just the same .
Nothing here , Mr <NAME> , <NAME> , all perfectly satisfactory .
<NAME> <NAME> bowed to <NAME> , and <NAME> bowed to <NAME> .
He spoke , and moved forward beside Fanny .
‘ I ain ’ t one of the supposing sort .
I sat gazing at him , spell-bound .
This young woman is honoured with my <NAME> 's notice and favour .
‘ And look here ! ’ pursued <NAME> .
A late , dull autumn night was closing in upon the river Saone .
Oh , shrewd people , Mr Clennam : evidently people of business !
Of course I have come back harder .
Find him , find him out , that 's all .
So away they went , leaving <NAME> snoring most comfortably in the shade .
I inquired of <NAME> .
Age known by marks in mouth. ’ Thus ( and much more ) <NAME> .
Then it slowly arose , and sat in the window looking out .
`` Just so , just so , '' the old man nods .
‘ Well ! ’ muttered <NAME> as he marked her earnest look .
‘ To be on the spot .
'Yes , yes , ' replied the other .
The Beginning of a <NAME> XXXIV .
‘ You are quite right , ’ she said .
‘ Send young Gay. ’ ‘ Good , very good indeed .
I shall also do a little in the mining way .
Indeed , indeed , it is not my fault !
I want to carry you up with me .
The <NAME> recess was at hand .
You never will do that -- never while I have life .
‘ Any luggage , <NAME> ? ’ inquired the coachman .
‘ Now , boys , this is a new half .
I will do it , I will , I will , I will !
Let me finish my pipe , and I shall sleep like a child .
I proposed to him to lend me the money on my note .
Now what do you think of that ?
I can not bear all this . '
I hope you are well , sir .
`` But natural affection , <NAME> , '' hints <NAME> .
We had left <NAME> on Friday .
Luckily the two calculations agreed , so Mrs. <NAME> had no excuse for talking .
inquired Scrooge : observant of its dwarfish stature .
The countenance of <NAME> fell , and he gazed ruefully at the fire .
'Not a bit of it , ' replied <NAME> .
Here is <NAME> , fresh in my mind and under my eye .
Uttering shriek upon shriek , she sank upon the ground .
No love , no hatred , no hope , no threat .
I am quite sure it is .
<NAME> , take me on your arm .
Its finger pointed to two persons meeting .
And have told each other so . ''
‘ And we are both widows too ! ’ said <NAME> ’ s mother .
‘ _He ’ s_ not poor ; _he ’ s_ doing well enough .
Is that about the sum and substance of it ?
He did not seek it , but repeated them and went on .
‘ Yes , <NAME> , ’ said Mr Meagles , in a lower voice .
‘ That ’ s not all , ’ said the man , eagerly .
‘ Good-evening , ’ said that young gentleman , all unconscious of his conquest .
‘ Only a poor little joke .
how I thank <NAME> for having taken our boy !
<NAME> mak ’ st me see it wi ’ a better eye .
‘ Fanny ! ’ said <NAME> , glancing round , with a gathering alarm .
<NAME> ’ t spurn me with your heel ! ’ A silence ensued .
Let <NAME> give me my toast and water ! ''
I ’ ll not detain you long .
It ’ s of no use remaining shut up in his own rooms .
Accused of the murder of Mr .
'May be said to live in jails , this boy . '
`` Not what everybody has been talking of , my beloved <NAME> ! ''
My heart yearned towards him .
I had become attached to the day . ''
Set your mind at rest on that point .
The baron grew weary , and wanted excitement .
‘ They were becoming civilized when I left <NAME> , ’ says <NAME> .
<NAME> , ’ returned Mrs. <NAME> , ‘ you can .
‘ The baby , ’ said my aunt .
Were they expected at <NAME> ?
I ’ ll help <NAME> too , though he _is_ asleep .
The jewels showed to the richest advantage .
Not without much dear remembrance on my side .
I shall be on the look-out for you , when you come back .
‘ Oh , don ’ t , <NAME> ! ’ cried the <NAME> .
The <NAME> brothers were watermen ( cheers and laughter ) .
“ And I am very happy to-night , dear father .
<NAME> <NAME> said more ; he said there never should be .
‘ He knows a task if he only looks at it .
What d ’ ye mean ? ’ he inquired .
And you a Frenchman born ?
I asked him when I had hummed it quietly all through .
<NAME> -- introduce us. ’ <NAME> did so , in a kind of desperation .
He is the terror of the youth of <NAME> .
That 's what I look at . ''
I am fresh again now , and fit for talking .
`` There and then she died .
What would he say to the returned convict ?
<NAME> , grandma ! ’ screamed both the young ladies together .
In <NAME> 's <NAME> XLIII .
But what ’ s his other name , his true other name ?
I have no right to expect that it should be otherwise with me .
I was affected by the story altogether .
The shadow of the wall was on every object .
Likewise could swear to clothes .
I opened it , and read the writing of <NAME> .
So insurmountable , as you must well know , would be his objections .
The time is drawing near . ''
'Do not press me to reply , ' answered <NAME> .
I ask where is this certain place .
She was far above me in all respects at all times .
‘ Even from him , you see !
<NAME> had a sharp eye , verily , at picquet .
After a long time , I looked towards <NAME> again .
One I have told her of .
Now , suppose I had killed him .
`` These are my <NAME> 's rooms , just as she left them . ''
<NAME> at the window there .
Let our good friend here , assist you on that side .
‘ I hope so , ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> was very cheerful with them , and spoke pleasantly to all the family .
It was a large room , with a great window .
asks the trooper with a glance before him .
In fact , to Veneering they owe their union .
He was calculated to BE a deprivation , I 'm sure he was . ''
The gentleman nodded to me .
‘ Why , <NAME> , woman -- Affery ! ’ said Mr Flintwinch .
But it 's well I never made that evolution of matrimony .
<NAME> bless you , how healthy you look !
<NAME> <NAME> with a nod goes on his way .
‘ Except the <NAME> , ’ says <NAME> .
`` Not heard of him , perhaps ? ''
It was their favourite walk .
But never ask me to receive <NAME> , never do it , uncle .
“ There , sir ! ” I timidly explained .
Such lives as are led here , bear the same fruits here as elsewhere .
One of them had some connection with our family .
A man , being poor , has nothing to be proud of .
It is enough that he was glad to hear her .
' I said the word , ma'am , ' said <NAME> .
I knew I was mad , but they did not even suspect it .
<NAME> Heaven you have ! ’ Mr <NAME> was silent for a long while .
Responsibility ! ’ said the <NAME> .
'What 's become of the boy ? '
But that is quite beside the question .
I was very merry , I know ; but it was hollow merriment .
They had scarcely taken their seats when there was another double knock .
There ’ s my answer to your trash .
“ Stop a moment , I am coming to that .
In point of meritorious character , the two things seemed about equal .
Produced by <NAME> and <NAME> .
‘ Nobody sleeps in the other bed , of course , ’ said <NAME> .
I hardly know which was the better pleased , <NAME> or I .
“ I could do nothing but comply , and I entered it in silence .
<NAME> was precisely in this condition .
I wrote to her before I slept .
It was only a burst of light that had been so radiant .
She 's got the shroud again .
‘ How dull you are tonight ! ’ sneered <NAME> .
I charge you , then , with being some way concerned in the <NAME> .
You see what the place is .
‘ He beareth off a lamb , a precious lamb !
I felt them. ’ ‘ Touched them ? ’ ‘ No .
She shall have no pittance , but a fortune -- <NAME> !
Provision of oranges , apples , and nuts was also made .
It was gone in a minute .
<NAME> was to be married to-morrow .
The dinner was quickly despatched , and they walked out together .
Each cell door on this side has a square aperture in it .
‘ Is it -- ? ’ inquired <NAME> , hesitating .
But it ’ s all show , bless you .
‘ You shall know him better .
And went away singing to himself .
‘ We shall see him , ’ returned her mother .
They had to look all over the place for the hat .
`` I do n't mean anything of importance .
Twice he passes the gatehouse , reluctant to enter .
‘ That ’ s as much as to say you agree ?
‘ Do you see her now ?
‘ It will not be ample time ! ’ cried <NAME> .
That ’ s the message , ’ I readily undertook its transmission .
It was very unfortunate that she should marry such a vagabond .
<NAME> <NAME> made a bow .
‘ Hollo there ! ’ repeated <NAME> .
She will if she can .
'So you wo n't let me have him , gen ' l'men ? '
You don ’ t know half of what I do to accommodate <NAME> .
I don ’ t want no sleep , I don ’ t .
<NAME> writes threatening letters about money to this place .
He will be gone directly .
How else was I to get it ?
‘ Stop ! ’ said <NAME> ; ‘ allow me .
But it was otherwise , and that was well .
My guardian had come home and was standing thoughtfully by the dark window .
I say , sweep it off the face of the earth and begin afresh .
`` What about those rings you told me of ? ''
She distrusted and disliked him .
Perhaps , they became the restless people they were , in consequence .
Can you follow me , <NAME> ?
‘ Perhaps you won ’ t be able to help it .
' I would , if I was in your place .
No , I don ’ t want it ; look into it .
She had been alone some hours .
For she was under no restraint with us .
‘ I shall see him as I never saw him yet .
It opened softly on its hinges as <NAME> gave a low whistle .
I know what these things are .
I beg to assure you that there is nothing the matter .
That 's neither here nor there .
<NAME> man as I am , I am not hard enough for that .
‘ You preach , about as consistent as they did .
There was nothing troublesome against <NAME> ; yes , he might come in .
It led to our being engaged to be married .
‘ Vere ever I can , ’ replied Sam .
‘ I promised that I would not accompany you , nor follow you .
‘ <NAME> little sister , <NAME> , thou hast not forgot her .
I have told you so five hundred times . ''
This has been unsought by me .
It was the touch of a hand ; of a man ’ s hand .
He saw that the rules of the service were imperative .
cried the little man , calling after him .
At any hour , at any minute .
‘ It ’ s quite an infatuation with him .
No stint of omnibuses here !
‘ No Adorable at the club !
' I ca n't manage any more , ' said <NAME> .
He reached it ; he was close upon it .
<NAME> 's it all about , <NAME> ?
He 's as thin as a lath .
I have stayed for him , your Reverence .
Now , what do you want with me ? ” “ Not very much .
All it said was , ‘ My dear Trotwood .
He is doing duty as a model to-day .
There ’ s a gentleman to have run to seed in the <NAME> jail !
Neither his father nor his mother will ever interfere with him .
<NAME> trade with seafaring men gets a bad name through deeds of violence .
Perhaps you do right to get used to one . ''
`` Coavinses has been arrested by the <NAME> , '' said <NAME> .
‘ Thank you , <NAME> , quite well .
Mr and <NAME> were reported sitting in this room , when <NAME> got back .
`` Are you in debt again ? ''
It is so at home , and it is so abroad .
My dear , how much improved you are .
His little failings would only have endeared him to you the more .
‘ Is <NAME> ’ s nephew with him ? ’ the <NAME> asks .
‘ I saw it in the <NAME> , <NAME> , ’ continued <NAME> .
But when the cottager died it would be discovered there .
Says the coroner , go and fetch him then .
“ Openly , President. ” “ By whom ? ” “ Three voices .
`` We wanted to get in , '' pleads <NAME> .
O <NAME> , think again !
Who passes by this road so late ?
‘ Bless us ! ’ said the lady .
What <NAME> would have been without that blight , I never shall know now !
‘ What ’ s the matter ? ’ whispered <NAME> .
' I shall show you that I know more than that . '
Sisters , it is nearly noon .
‘ Shall we make a man of him ? ’ repeated the Doctor .
There were great changes in my old home .
`` So far that 's satisfactory , and it does you credit .
Is it anything about a picture ? ''
‘ It is no affair of mine .
Mr Clennam , I am quite unreserved with you .
‘ Ah , Mr Carker ! ’ returned <NAME> .
‘ Or <NAME> will do it better , as he understands these things .
‘ Not at all , ’ returned <NAME> .
I congratulated Mrs. Micawber on the approaching change .
Then you can do as you please with me .
`` But I think <NAME> is right . ''
equally like smoke , if not more so .
But if he is a changed man -- - ’ She stopped .
'You 're a good boy -- a very good boy .
I want to speak to you , <NAME> .
He ’ s the man for a difficult question at law .
‘ Now I begin to know my old customer indeed !
Among those secluded nooks there is very little stir or movement after dark .
'That is the bastard child . '
`` I am the <NAME> of <NAME> . ''
I am too unsettled even for that .
‘ <NAME> ’ t call it home , my child ! ’ he entreated .
Or not you so much , perhaps , as your friend in the city ?
‘ Do be quiet , <NAME> , ’ interposed the lieutenant .
Resolved speedily , to the daughter .
the whole country was awake , and the dogs upon us . '
‘ I thought you ’ d come back directly , <NAME> .
He is a ward in <NAME> , my dear .
Mr <NAME> resumed his spectacles therefore .
<NAME> weather did n't know where to have him .
You have told me I can urge and press a point .
You can sit down or stand up as you please , sir .
See where your father is .
<NAME> B. has had his day , <NAME> , but he keeps his eyes .
She and her father came together .
Is this your dreadful news ; this your terrible intelligence ?
‘ <NAME> ’ t be frightened , ’ said the host .
What ’ s the order of the day ?
‘ I knew he did , ’ said <NAME> .
He had plucked it off again .
'That 's well , ' said the doctor .
I asked <NAME> if he brought her papa out much .
As far as I am concerned , I have no price .
I am not to be trifled with .
‘ Fond of reading perhaps ? ’ ‘ Yes .
‘ <NAME> , ’ said Mr Lammle , when the servant had withdrawn .
No one was near me when I went in and went home .
`` I do n't know , '' said <NAME> .
A family-box carries double always .
What you have forgotten you must now begin to recall , my dear <NAME> .
Which ’ ll make five on you .
To see the action of the wind there. ’ ‘ What followed ?
Then , so much the greater reason for having our assistance !
<NAME> care , <NAME> , take care .
<NAME> God I acknowledge none !
<NAME> a wish and gratify it , my daughter .
'There 's enough light for wot I 've got to do . '
You ’ ve been unlawfully ferreting about this yard .
Have her to live with us ?
‘ I can -- I can -- guess the cause .
We ’ ll pay you out for three-and-sixpence a week .
I shot him , miss ; and <NAME> held the light . '
<NAME> , do I make myself intelligible ?
Such a heart <NAME> carried under her rough robe .
But he had used the word in the sense of <NAME> .
The game had not yet commenced .
Mr <NAME> was taking counsel as to his hand , of <NAME> .
<NAME> things ! ’ ‘ They are old-fashioned , too , ’ said <NAME> .
Our treasure was warranted sober and honest .
<NAME> , hope , to the last ! ’ <NAME> needed encouragement .
‘ My dear Copperfield , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ this is luxurious .
Let him remember it in that room , years to come !
‘ <NAME> ’ t begin with me. ’ ‘ Mrs .
‘ Shall I take you there ?
he says as he comes in .
I am sure he has not forgotten it .
<NAME> is steady but the red light .
I think that first put it in my head .
I ’ ll stone yer eyes out , s ’ elp me !
<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> came up at the moment .
I am not setting up to be sentimental about <NAME> .
You know he has none. ’ ‘ Whose then ? ’ returned the daughter .
There are <NAME> , our neighbour <NAME> , <NAME> , and I .
‘ He never does me the honour to speak to me .
The jury looked suspicious , and <NAME> smiled as he sat down .
‘ Let us talk about it .
I can ’ t help thinking of it , <NAME> .
<NAME> prevails below stairs too .
As to the result , it 's a toss-up .
‘ Who is that ? ’ said the boy , seeing <NAME> .
I should never wish to intrude where I were not welcome .
“ Nothing worth mentioning , ” replied <NAME> .
Let us ha ’ this , right understood .
'Call after him , ' said <NAME> ; 'it 's particular .
Her <NAME> 's handsome eyes regard her with astonishment , almost with fear .
‘ Oh , hush if you please ! ’ said <NAME> .
Let us talk about something else . ''
Accordingly , we went on board , with as little delay as might be .
It was early in the evening , and late in the spring .
What 's to be done with him ? ''
My involuntary start occasioned her to lay her hand upon my arm .
Nothing but rain -- and no family here ! ''
‘ Who else could compare my brother ’ s baby with your boy ?
She would have been less and less a companion for him .
by all means , ’ rejoined <NAME> .
Should I find <NAME> at the factory , do you think ? ''
To be sure , Mr <NAME> , to be sure , sir .
He will hear either me or you if we beseech him .
You are the commander of the <NAME> !
‘ What are you laughing at , <NAME> ? ’ said the magistrate .
‘ Oh yes , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ she is alive .
'She did , ' said Mrs. Sowerberry .
Then came the trim-hedged fields on either hand , and the open road again .
<NAME> , let us go on .
I am married to your daughter .
'Let him lie there ; he 'll soon be tired of that . '
Mr <NAME> rushed in and saw him , and stood still .
I mean , <NAME> , the Tombatism .
Whatever the old girl says , do .
We consign the whole thing to oblivion .
He waited for another , and for another .
‘ There ’ s a great fuss , I think , about it .
We got hot brandy and water , and it revived us wonderfully .
Is there anything that you require of me ?
‘ “ Blood and thunder ! ” roared the other gentleman .
That ’ s yours. ’ ‘ Mine , <NAME> ? ’ said <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , as <NAME> was following .
‘ He ’ ll like your way of talking , I know .
I am as poor as when I lived here .
<NAME> nothing else , and root out everything else .
“ The chateau , and all the race ? ” inquired the first .
The <NAME> of all Three shall strive within me .
The ceremony was performed in an admirable manner .
‘ It ’ s a veal and ham pie , ’ said Mr Boffin .
<NAME> was the fire replenished , and again went the wassail round .
What I always tell him ! ''
They would not look at one another .
They wo n't interfere with you , sir .
Nothing could be done without a smart match being played out .
I beg your pardon a thousand times .
`` I ca n't imagine , '' said I .
Find me a good condition !
When he called at my lodgings in <NAME> .
and burst into tears for the first time .
<NAME> , with the basket , walked at her side .
But even that may be my vanity .
It is the same with people that I left in <NAME> .
If <NAME> cuts the <NAME> ’ s nails , she must be all right .
‘ Successfully , ’ said they both together .
He makes his usual bow and goes quietly back again .
This is the new discovery .
`` I will begin the world ! ''
‘ You are right , my dear Sir , she is rather old .
You remember her dead child .
‘ Why , someun even made offer fur to marry her !
Do what I will , you can ’ t be got to fit .
Prosperously , but not noticeably otherwise ; he thought , in black .
There is the Chairman , travelling three thousand miles per week .
“ Who taught me to be proud ? ” returned <NAME> .
‘ Is the gray mare made over to anybody ? ’ inquired <NAME> anxiously .
Do put something to my back and arms , and legs and shoulders .
'They 'll be able to make us useful some way or another .
‘ To leave him ? ’ said brother <NAME> .
And the clerk of <NAME> ’ s sister -- clerk to a female Dragon .
They were overpowered afresh by his uncommon generosity .
<NAME> , <NAME> ; let me walk home with you to-night .
He is content to take me as I am .
<NAME> ’ t understand him if he does ask .
<NAME> came to my assistance with a confirmatory murmur .
At length she said , 'You 're going by coach , sir ?
I am afraid to think so ; it seems too bold .
Now , I am dumb ! ” <NAME> .
‘ Not a bit of it , ’ said <NAME> .
It was not difficult to read the blushing , startled face .
Open the street door , <NAME> ; put these blusterers out !
‘ Coming , <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> , running upstairs .
<NAME> <NAME> with her face to the window , held her arm up .
`` Refused all proposals , '' returned <NAME> .
And her voice had softened too .
A pretty exhibition my grandmamma must have made of herself !
<NAME> outstrips the <NAME> , and comes up with it .
But , however , if you have no sense of decency , I have .
She wants to go there !
He seemed to purr , he was so glad .
Mr <NAME> meekly followed .
No matter what I think it now .
This pleasantry was received with a general laugh .
Mrs. Micawber and our offspring will accompany me .
‘ It is far more <NAME> ’ s question , therefore , than mine .
And they both groaned at the atrocious conduct of the elder <NAME> .
A shiver in the negative from Mrs. Snagsby .
She draws off her glove to get some money from her purse .
Do n't go and tell me that you buried <NAME> .
I had been the means of injuring your hopes and prospects even then .
But by and by I mentioned <NAME> .
It was the pleasantest tea-table in the world .
It has long been my wish to be so .
`` Tell him my opinion of it . ''
The air was difficult to breathe for a length of time consecutively .
‘ No , I have not , ’ replied the clerk .
`` Now , you men , what do you want ?
We Englishmen are <NAME> of our Constitution , <NAME> .
And are who what ? ’ said <NAME> .
The infernal old jail was a respectable one to this .
But you had better not be seen about here .
But , all the bodies agreed that they were never to wonder .
I don ’ t know where , among whom , or how long .
`` Let the charwoman alone to be the first ! ''
<NAME> was broad awake upon his post , and waiting for his little mistress .
Why should you linger about it any more than I ?
Thinking that might be too melancholy , he corrected it with a chuckle .
But it was a summer night , fortunately , and fine weather .
Is there not ? ’ ‘ Yes. ’ ‘ Check it ; divert it !
The other man repeated , `` That 's all about it . ''
`` No word of any kind ? ''
Let me get back ; that 's a dear . '
You are well and happy , my dear ?
My friends , I doubt their doin ’ yo onny good .
‘ <NAME> came out , till last night !
‘ Hoi ! ’ shouted the officers of the advancing line .
Be a <NAME> sportsman and enjoy the pleasures of the chase .
‘ Nothing to send , <NAME> ? ’ said the man of teeth .
‘ You really must consider yourself , my dear , which you never do .
The master-millers had already departed , and the journeymen were departing .
Say who shall meet you .
<NAME> till I run to <NAME> .
‘ What does this mean ? ’ ‘ Nothing , my darling , nothing .
A moment afterwards we are again eyeing him .
“ Who is it ? ” said the lady at the table .
Are you a beast of the field ?
He couldn ’ t have a better nurse to bring him round .
The <NAME> makes a Discovery 50 .
‘ My head aches with these scenes , and my heart too .
<NAME> images of grown people !
<NAME> and I were engaged .
'Take it up for her , <NAME> ; ca n't you ? '
<NAME> still sat and listened , with his eyes cast down .
I knew it , readily , to be the figure that we sought .
The world was very busy and restless about him .
He spoke in a softened voice and kissed the letter as he asked me .
Next morning <NAME> came back .
Let her rest in peace , <NAME> bless her ! ''
We want wine , among the rest .
And my mind requires to be so very clear , you know !
‘ —Raw material—where <NAME> , the banker , might reside .
I know I am , Mrs. Bagnet .
I know it , but I know not how .
I hear my man ringing at the door .
She was a nice 'un she was .
Perhaps he inherits that misfortune .
‘ Then just state the particulars , will you ?
A faint voice answered something .
' I shall interest you by and by .
It was a mercy he didn ’ t emigrate .
I have a communication to make that will surprise you .
‘ The governor distinctly said it was to be done .
‘ I ’ ve got it ! ’ said <NAME> .
‘ I ’ ll take care of her , Wally !
Her name is <NAME> .
<NAME> was <NAME> 's sister .
see how he changes colour .
Mrs. <NAME> ’ s mama was a lady I took great delight in .
That the discovery of my birth gave him no shock .
But I was relieved of them in an unexpected manner .
“ Never , ” answered the mender of roads , recovering his perpendicular .
' A glass of water , <NAME> , dear .
There never can have been , there never can be , a pleasanter manner .
'It was the partial disclosure of your secrets , ' replied <NAME> .
No one cared to stop him , if any were so disposed .
Here ’ s a chance for you .
I hope you ’ ll look in to see us now and then .
you know best , sir , ’ I returned modestly .
‘ Thus much I know , ’ he murmured .
You were beadle here , once ; were you not ? '
We are too near to stop , and be at rest .
and would count up to twelve , and say , 'Hush ! '
<NAME> ? ’ ‘ A cur , sir. ’ ‘ Agreed !
‘ He must have been fast asleep , ’ whispered <NAME> .
sir , do n't , do n't pray be cross to me ! '
“ <NAME> ! ” he said , with a start .
`` No , he do n't teach anything in particular , '' replied <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> perceived it , and followed up his advantage .
“ How say you , <NAME> ? ” demanded <NAME> .
you 've thought better of it , have you ? '
‘ We don ’ t part so , ’ he said .
‘ Now came the difficulties of our position .
Where the devil have you been ? '
Or , if to myself , certainly not to anybody else .
‘ Mr Carker ? ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Come , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ a song -- a Christmas song !
It would be better not to keep them now .
He shall see to the boat being fresh named .
I had been reading to Peggotty about crocodiles .
Such a thing has happened here , often , and too often .
The blow sounded as if it had fallen on wood .
<NAME> <NAME> was smoking his pipe .
The two so very much alike , and yet so monstrously contrasted .
'The sin and wickedness of the lower orders in this porochial district is frightful !
<NAME> <NAME> had him christened <NAME> in remembrance of the <NAME> .
A gentleman must expect reverses , ’ said <NAME> .
`` Do n't be so malicious , '' says <NAME> .
The washing apparatus is forward , on the deck .
Do n't know that everybody has two names .
One , two , three , four , five , six -- go !
She submitted to walk slowly on , with downcast eyes .
She looked down again , and put out her trembling hand .
‘ What did you think of that , sir ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
<NAME> , sir ? ’ ‘ Nothing now. ’ ‘ Very good , sir .
Illegible except to the scorer .
‘ Uncommon gentlemanly , really , ’ said <NAME> .
Why , THE document , ’ replied <NAME> .
'His hand was not in .
Mrs. Copperfield , sir , I hope she ’ s getting on .
‘ Yes , I know that -- out of your anxiety for my death .
‘ That ’ s the name , ’ said <NAME> .
We are giving them no rest .
‘ Now you see her , ’ said <NAME> .
`` Been along with your friend again , <NAME> ? ''
is that all ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
One would think you believed in the <NAME> .
‘ Not more dull for me than <NAME> , sir .
Well , you _do_ look tired .
What power this woman has to keep these raging passions down !
‘ Why , what does the man mean ? ’ cried <NAME> , colouring .
<NAME> is asleep. ’ It was <NAME> now .
‘ Why adopt a circuitous form of speech ?
“ She lingered for a week .
<NAME> sharp for old Bounderby , <NAME> ! ’ <NAME> remonstrated .
<NAME> , you must know , was a spoilt child .
I should have been in the artillery now but for the old girl .
‘ It is down , ’ said <NAME> .
Again <NAME> nodded his head .
He , too , shrinks from them .
`` Yes , '' says the man , coming in and closing the door .
And do n't he know me ?
I know what these girls are , <NAME> , well .
that Chancery is what it is .
How is it with us all to-day ? ''
‘ We haven ’ t got anything for you , little girl .
I ’ m low enough without that .
<NAME> , woman dear , good night !
‘ Is yours a strong constitution ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
For the first time the hand appeared to shake .
<NAME> ! ” The prisoner came forward directly .
‘ Oh , quite well , thank you , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
It was down in <NAME> .
Some said heer , some said theer .
‘ Of course you know the alternative , ’ replied the visitor coolly .
I thanked him and said I hoped so .
It is into one of these booths that our story takes its way .
We must take care of our dear <NAME> , <NAME> .
There ain ’ t no bis ’ ness done , you see .
The advantage of this fortification is obvious .
The woman shakes her head .
‘ “ What now , what now ? ” said the old man .
`` By my life and honour , yes ! ''
Never leave off hoping ; it don ’ t answer .
She had wept to see him dull and quiet .
‘ There is no one waiting ? ’ repeated <NAME> in majestic accents .
‘ To be candid with you , tolerably .
Take ‘ em in no time , and always exact .
I am just as proud as you are .
‘ Is he ? ’ replied the widow lady .
‘ <NAME> , my dear <NAME> , ’ returned my mother .
`` I may now perhaps mention what I wished to say to you ? ''
I am well used to travelling ; I want no attendance .
Not yet. ’ Susan and Mr Toots are of the same opinion .
You haven ’ t a chance , old fellow .
‘ Ever in trouble ? ’ said <NAME> .
Immediately afterwards , a great spirt of blood burst from his nose .
What sort of person now !
‘ Well , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ I ’ ll see him .
'You _are_ a great deal better , are you not , my dear ? '
Promise me , my child , not a little man .
`` He fully believes he is one of the aristocracy !
‘ Hush ! ’ she said , with her finger on her lips .
said <NAME> , with a sneer .
He will tell you all .
This is not inapplicable to my uncle and his fencing .
“ <NAME> at home ? ” Expected home .
Facts alone are wanted in life .
`` <NAME> had any visitors this morning ? ''
‘ Ah , to be sure , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Here ! ’ ‘ Oh ! ’ said Mr Swiveller .
I was glad to see it .
We were so exceedingly genteel , that our scope was very limited .
come in , <NAME> , ’ said Mr Witherden .
<NAME> understands him as I do ; nobody knows him as I do .
Take him , you silly fellow !
Though I DO attend court regularly .
‘ You asked me to hear you out , and you will not speak .
Sufficient answer to all ; Shares .
This is what I came to say .
‘ Far be it from me to say otherwise .
I thanked <NAME> and said he was quite well .
“ Well ? ” said she , fixing her eyes upon me .
“ Well , well , well ! ” she said .
He looked up at the house .
<NAME> <NAME> has lost everything .
The boy was exact respecting colours and everything .
I see , by your meaning smile , you think not .
It is morally impossible that his name can be <NAME> .
'Yes , there 's some half-dozen of 'em gone in , that I knows .
‘ Eh ? ’ whispered <NAME> , with a momentary gleam of hope .
We have all said it , and we ’ ll all do it .
‘ How can you ask me ?
<NAME> was no light youth of sinful gaiety and pleasure .
The sound resounded through the house like thunder .
I never said I was .
<NAME> , and only <NAME> , is the mainspring of that machine .
A grand review was to take place upon the lines .
I shall be charged with that next . ''
You have been getting out of bed in your sleep , my dear !
‘ I thought you had called and merely left your name and gone .
A brilliant morning shines on the old city .
<NAME> haste , here , whoever you are !
`` And do n't YOU know , my love ? ''
I am not to blame .
‘ Not in justice ? ’ ‘ Bother justice ! ’ said <NAME> .
Yes ! ’ cried the old woman , quite delighted .
<NAME> had worn on , and it was growing late .
Go along with t ’ other loving art !
He took a few turns up and down and sunk upon the sofa .
`` No one , sir , '' said <NAME> .
`` I am in the presence of the <NAME> of <NAME> To Come ? ''
‘ I shall never do that .
No matter with what other words we parted ; we parted .
No , she had never seen him .
isn ’ t it ? ’ said the small servant .
“ Do n't go , <NAME> , ” she said .
There are tears stealing down your face at this moment .
It is very cold and wet .
‘ “ I don ’ t believe it , ” says the baron .
I see my follies , now , sir .
Then , a pause ; as if those who knocked had stopped to listen .
( <NAME> ’ s doubts were resolved .
‘ Is there anything you want that you have not ?
‘ <NAME> , ’ said that gentleman .
‘ Ah , <NAME> ! ’ said <NAME> , presenting himself .
‘ -- Then , we could weather this ? ’ ‘ No doubt .
He was at home in five minutes .
However , did I find you out ?
“ Well ! ” said <NAME> , in a hail-fellow-well-met kind of way .
I might have foreseen what would happen .
But what is a man to do ?
The night was dark and raw , and the way dreary enough .
said <NAME> , knocking the table .
What was he to you ? ’ ‘ He was my brother , <NAME> .
He waited , but she had eluded him .
Leave all else to time , truth , and steadfastness .
Always the same fixed face .
My Lady a good temper ? ''
That his age was about sixty .
' I am but a woman ; alone here ; and unprotected . '
‘ I am most anxious that he should , mama , ’ rejoined <NAME> .
‘ At any hour , ’ replied <NAME> fiercely .
<NAME> looks out of them .
Moreover , his spectacles greatly interfered with his powers of vision .
‘ I keep his nails in order for him .
<NAME> was satisfied with this arrangement .
the white house was empty , and there was a bill in the window .
I know it must fall .
I am going out to dinner .
They are caged up with all the others .
‘ A deceitful , bad-hearted girl , ’ said Mrs. Joram .
He went up to the door too , and ascended the steps too .
“ No , I can not spare him !
‘ Oh welcome home , dear Walter !
His practised eye saw it , and made the most of it .
I know it from her own lips .
But it was not so , at all .
He will be back at <NAME> ’ ‘ Nothing could happen better .
They <NAME> NOT vary the rheumatism with amusement .
Perhaps you know the plaintiff too ?
“ As punctual as ever , ” he repeated , coming up to us .
said the old woman in a loud whisper .
When would they be , Mr .
‘ <NAME> ’ t revive it by a single word .
It is morning in the great world , afternoon according to the little sun .
It is one that does not admit of delay .
the old woman said , quickening hers , too , quite easily .
‘ How very nice ! ’ exclaimed <NAME> .
<NAME> asked me for the introduction , and I gave it .
‘ Theer ’ s these here banknotes -- fifty pound , and ten .
“ I would recommend him to sacrifice it .
It is in the present mode .
I understand and share the wise consideration with which you regard his errors .
A subject of proper pride and congratulation , <NAME> .
I feel my want of learning very much , <NAME> .
‘ You are an old man , and I leave you to the grave .
‘ Good gracious me ! ’ stammered Mr Toots .
I took him in hand and gave him an object .
<NAME> <NAME> has his hand on the bell-rope .
‘ Mr Inspector at home ? ’ whispered <NAME> .
Did I ever use any art to win you ?
The passage was perfectly dark .
But there was no opening of the <NAME> ’ s windows that morning .
Not this one. ’ ‘ Why not ? ’ the same gentleman asked .
I never knew my Lady swoon before .
‘ Why does <NAME> light the fire ?
Forth from the shelter of a neighbouring wall , Mr Venus then emerged .
cried a looker-on , from a garret-window .
‘ To -- ? ’ ‘ To your father-in-law , ’ said my aunt .
The fat boy almost laughed again when he heard this suggestion .
What a different Sunday morning from the old Sunday morning at <NAME> !
“ And mind you ! ” said <NAME> .
‘ Not at all , ’ says <NAME> .
When they were alone , <NAME> asked him what he had done ?
<NAME> and sale , bless you !
' A word from me , and the alternative has gone for ever . '
`` Indeed , I think so , <NAME> , '' replied <NAME> .
`` What will you take yourself , miss ?
I also am going to <NAME> and perhaps to <NAME> .
It was up the great staircase on the story above .
asked the doctor in a whisper .
‘ The ties of nature are strong .
The lady said she was aware she might be unknown by name .
‘ So cheerful he is ! ’ said <NAME> .
'You understand what that means , landlord ! '
Still , it 's not right , you know ; is it ? ''
Would he have been doing that ?
It has remained a secret , however .
I have now answered your unaccountable question .
<NAME> is going to faint .
`` Are spirits ' lives so short ? ''
He showed her into a darkening room , and left her .
And crushed it must be .
Somebody else said it was <NAME> .
The evening arrived ; the boys took their places .
The <NAME> continued to stare and whistle .
You are willing enough to listen to <NAME> .
`` To be sure , '' returns <NAME> with a nod .
“ I was startled , and asked , 'Is it a pressing case ? '
Perhaps I did believe it .
You shall hear me ask this man a question .
If that was it , I was quite ready to go .
' I think I would rather read them , sir , ' replied <NAME> .
`` Was the boy 's name at the inkwhich Jo ? ''
<NAME> fired two pistols without effect .
said <NAME> ; 'say four pound , gen ' l'men .
She kissed and welcomed him ; but was afraid to ask him any questions .
At length he follows the men with the carpet caps .
‘ I should indeed , ’ replied <NAME> .
'It was in that character I saw you .
It an ’ t along o ’ you ! ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> inclined his head .
He brings actions for trespass ; I bring actions for trespass .
<NAME> came out of his corner .
“ You wish you were going yourself ?
Mrs <NAME> changed her ground .
That was the captivation of it to me .
After a time she rang the bell .
A pleasant Day with an unpleasant Termination 20 .
‘ Yes , ’ cried <NAME> , looking a little closer .
`` Confide in me , my child .
‘ He has told you what has passed between himself and my husband ?
‘ Why not , my love ? ’ I gently asked .
‘ I have been swallowing too much of that word , <NAME> .
It pinted out this writing , <NAME> .
But it is easy to say that when you have told me so . ''
And take some of the old walks ?
<NAME> ’ t you think ill of me because I use her help .
And what do you think about father ?
‘ To what ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
He hoards her in his heart .
' I will not do it !
'Are you the party that 's been robbed , sir ? '
She listened , but no sound replied .
‘ I thought I ’ d wait for you here .
Here he is. ’ As <NAME> spoke , <NAME> walked up .
<NAME> got into no coach , and was already gone .
‘ “ Anything else , my lord ? ” inquired the domestic .
'Try 'em again , <NAME> ; try 'em again . '
“ Gentlemen , ” said <NAME> , “ I am proud to see you .
`` Of <NAME> reputation , '' added <NAME> in an undertone .
I am sorry to observe you are in mourning .
Some of his periods quite majestic ! ''
At last I hope you have got your wishes realized -- by your Boffins .
In this dilemma <NAME> bethought himself of his new friend , <NAME> .
In whose hands does the power of any restoration lie ?
You 've been a-trying to do it , have you ? ''
‘ I have no use for money , I have no wish for it .
They have been half mad about you .
It contained at that time about two hundred prisoners .
`` She means well , '' said <NAME> hastily .
DAY and night again , day and night again .
‘ What ’ s the matter ? ’ I involuntarily asked .
To see the eyes droop as from some mean and odious object !
`` Yes , little woman , pretty often . ''
<NAME> <NAME> rather sternly rejoined that he was glad to hear it .
`` Have you changed your mind ?
“ You work hard , madame , ” said a man near her .
We might be so much oftener together—mightn ’ t we ?
<NAME> <NAME> was fairly taken by surprise , and fairly beaten .
‘ In your room now. ’ ‘ Good , ’ rejoined <NAME> .
<NAME> knows I would ! ’ said <NAME> .
The country round <NAME> is surpassingly and exquisitely picturesque .
<NAME> <NAME> ! ” exclaimed the wild voices again .
Mr Venus , sir , take a chair .
‘ But the plaintiff must get it , ’ resumed Mrs. Cluppins .
'We have none of us long to wait for <NAME> .
And what would have been your destination ? ” turning on me again .
had brought him his breakfast .
Not a joyful style of house within , but quite the contrary .
I had no grain of hope left .
'And have done none , ' said the stranger .
I say so to the gentleman .
I have risen in a few months , over several heads .
It was not exactly comfortable below .
‘ Ah , she ’ s poorly , ’ said the first old woman .
‘ How do you do to-day , sir ? ’ said Mr Rugg .
‘ Did she laugh that night , was it ?
And here they found <NAME> awaiting their arrival .
“ Given to government , ” said <NAME> .
I thought I ’ d tell you , because really you ought to know .
<NAME> nodded in the affirmative .
No doubt she has suffered deeply in those same streets where you suffered deeply .
says <NAME> , clasping her hands .
Any Cratchit would have blushed to hint at such a thing .
But then he turns to <NAME> , and bursts into a fit of laughter .
<NAME> Mr Plornish at home ?
‘ Who may the four be ?
Its system of equity is a very great system , a very great system .
I will observe your very proper request .
‘ <NAME> and miserable as ever .
`` As you have done so many years .
I call it my Little Guillotine .
Then I remembered the woman .
But you may be , and my dear boy has been .
Your ladyship is very affable . ''
There was a long pause .
In a moment the butcher lights ten thousand candles out of my left eyebrow .
And what right had she to be cross ?
`` You know him by sight .
I spoke as to a stranger .
Mr <NAME> had scarcely come out , when <NAME> came out .
‘ No , ’ said <NAME> , shaking his head .
He ’ s immensely rich , my dear .
Can ’ t you see I am as umble as I can be ?
Everything postponed to that imaginary time !
Your sister <NAME> expresses herself strongly , but not without considerable reason .
Blow the fire , blow the fire -- Old Clem !
They are the same as ever .
‘ Shall I recall something to you , worthy madame ? ’ said <NAME> .
But as <NAME> ceased , she looked at Mr Dombey for a moment .
‘ No he ain ’ t , ’ said <NAME> .
We never have a servant who do n't drink .
‘ Look at him , ’ he said .
“ 'She is dead , ' said I .
Here are twenty thousand pounds .
My uncle ’ s wife couldn ’ t bear it .
'Not by flash <NAME> ? '
You 'll take a morsel of something ? ''
Every day found her something more retiring than the day before .
<NAME> me. ’ ‘ I am better here .
‘ Door , <NAME> ! ’ said <NAME> , as the boy appeared .
It is the best you can do for everybody 's sake .
‘ Why do you rest in the rain ? ’ said <NAME> , gently .
I call it quite my monomania , it is such a subject of mine .
‘ No ! ’ returned <NAME> , with a most rotund and glowing negative .
I could not be rich , and you here .
To be hanged by the neck till he was dead .
‘ Bad manners in a host ! ’ says <NAME> .
‘ What is it , <NAME> ? ’ demanded <NAME> .
‘ Not till she run away from me .
She was with him all day .
‘ But wot ’ s that , you ’ re a-doin ’ of ?
Well , but I 'll answer you .
After we got home , he haunted a post opposite our house .
I bought it soon after we were cool to each other .
So was the old lady , for she had been winning at whist .
Was I making any observation ? ’ ‘ About <NAME> , ’ I suggested .
She manifested no surprise in seeing them , nor any other emotion .
What then , when that 's once done ?
They will be found there .
‘ No , of course not , ’ retorted the <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> was as good as his word .
I intend to marry. ” “ _Do_ you ? ” “ Yes .
<NAME> seemed uneasy in his mind ; and answered briefly , `` Yes . ''
' I shall be carried out if I go ! '
Because it is decidedly the case with us .
I don ’ t approve of it .
I have very much to ask of you. ’ ‘ That ’ s well !
You will allow me to send the carriage back for your two wards .
returned Mrs. Jellyby , opening another letter with the greatest complacency .
Without entering into more minute particulars .
‘ What , <NAME> ! ’ exclaimed the father .
I can hear the watchman .
`` I must know more , and approve it . ''
`` Do let me hear the story ! ''
Is <NAME> , and the wolf Co ?
It ’ s ebb at half-arter three , slack water half an hour .
How dare you bully a magistrate ! '
Then <NAME> growled , and wouldn ’ t smell them .
Little more than a single syllable could have been spoken on either side .
‘ Wheel him to the devil , ’ replied <NAME> .
We were at the foot of the <NAME> .
Worldly goods are divided unequally , and man must not repine .
The gentleman , shortly afterwards , addressed himself to her .
The whole course of her thoughts appeared to stop , and change .
<NAME> and peace were there .
'You must talk on if you will . '
‘ <NAME> , perhaps ? ’ observed the Major , hesitating .
But you 'll see it often .
‘ I am very glad indeed to see you .
Commissions in the service are distributed on the same principle .
'Regarding this boy , my dear ? '
I am so weary of it .
`` Tony , '' said <NAME> to his friend after an awkward silence .
Of Walter she thought often .
Where are you got to , brave boy ?
Less interesting portraits had appeared .
What ’ s let loose upon us ?
But it 's well enough for the time .
Not so much as that , ’ urged <NAME> .
How can you expect that he ’ ll love his father ?
You may trust in me , cousin <NAME> .
And where was <NAME> !
I hate it and detest it .
‘ I shall never forgive myself , <NAME> , ’ said Mrs. Nickleby .
As to <NAME> , his father made no show of artifice about it .
The <NAME> raised his head pretty smartly , to hear what it was .
I will take leave to say a few words when you have finished . ''
But I never own to it before her .
They are in a devil of a hurry .
The honour is almost equal to the pleasure .
`` To rummage , '' repeated <NAME> .
'Sit down , ' said <NAME> , earnestly .
It ’ s so true ! ’ he cried .
He said that poor Frederick -- ha hum -- drivelled .
'Only through me , ' rejoined <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> from head to foot !
He was like himself again , and I felt still more encouraged .
Now , policeman , what is this ? '
Nothing in the least unusual was remotely shadowed forth .
“ Ask who is arrived. ” It was the nephew of <NAME> .
They so harnessed him and drove him .
“ <NAME> , dear darling of my soul .
Is n't that enough for the old wretch , without blows ? '
`` Do you mean it though , <NAME> ? ''
‘ Why , let me see , ’ said <NAME> .
I was making rather merry yesterday , sir . ''
cried she who had entered first .
I was betrayed into it by another .
That the mother was still living .
Not sounded , unless in the most respectful and tuneful manner .
Those menials having obeyed the mandate , <NAME> , <NAME> , proceeded .
`` It 's impossible that I can on this subject , my dear girl .
I have come to dinner .
<NAME> ’ t be croth with uth poor vagabondth .
Your concentrated <NAME> is seldom comparable to your concentrated Ass in money-breeding .
He is a man of attainments and of captivating manners .
What Mr <NAME> said was , wery well then .
Mrs. <NAME> will be glad to hear from her .
'Obstinacy ; woman 's obstinacy , I suppose , my dear . '
`` Are they still in operation ? ''
`` Not at all , '' says <NAME> .
But a good workman too , at the work he does .
He added that he was now upon his way to see the prisoner himself .
He made a damaging effect , and has great influence .
‘ A disgraceful imposition , ’ observed the old lady .
Let me see thee as I see thee when I coom in .
I ask for information , and I am glad to know it .
It was not quite destitute of furniture .
‘ I have been in a dream for ever so long .
‘ It ’ s all right , ’ whispered <NAME> .
Has a scar on one side of her cheek , by a cut .
No , no ; we have begun .
`` It 's his tea-time , is n't it ? ''
You two ( very young , my dears ) are cousins .
It looked in mine , passed across the narrow lane , and disappeared .
No , I have no secret , ’ said <NAME> in some trouble .
Everybody knows how unerring <NAME> ’ s judgment is .
This must be thought of , well , to-morrow .
Mrs. Gradgrind , stunned as usual , collapsed and gave it up .
‘ It ’ s only an adopted child .
said <NAME> , with a threatening look .
This is the witness encountered by appointment , by me , <NAME> .
He ’ ll take care of you. ’ ‘ But , <NAME> ?
I ca n't bear to have him about me .
' I did n't intend to -- I 'm going , my dear !
When he is in the yard , he dreads to re-enter the cell .
Finding it a false alarm , the Captain instantly slipped out again .
<NAME> <NAME> adjusts them in a moment .
‘ What does he say when he comes ? ’ asked Mr Carker .
‘ I have been talking to her this morning .
‘ <NAME> , house , house ! ’ cried <NAME> .
The old man 's not there . ''
‘ Something ’ s the matter , I ’ m sure .
Well or ill done , excusably or inexcusably , it was done .
I held on tight , while Mrs. <NAME> and <NAME> ran to him .
<NAME> , have I ! ’ said Mrs. <NAME> , with indignant pride .
Now we have talked this over comfortably , and may go to bed .
I know it meets your approval ? ''
I ’ m a brown forester , I am .
Where was the man , and why did he not come back ?
`` Anywhere , my dear , '' I replied .
As soon as I could creep away , I crept upstairs .
‘ On accounts of his never agreeing with nobody .
'Now , you must put your best leg foremost , old lady ! '
`` I have said nothing to <NAME> , <NAME> .
‘ Well , my Slider , ’ said <NAME> , jocularly .
This will be found at night , many hours after , instead of me .
The features of <NAME> they were , but strangely altered .
I want to talk to you . '
And <NAME> , what did he ?
“ Surely a very poor one , Estella. ” “ What do you mean ?
But they made no reply .
‘ There , I again say , you are wrong .
‘ Why about Mr Wrayburn ? ’ <NAME> asked .
They were close by the side of the first chaise .
I came alone. ’ ‘ Lord bless me ! ’ ejaculated <NAME> .
They were all merciful to me , and I lived .
`` She 's worth her weight in gold , '' says the trooper .
‘ I assure you there ’ s an objection , <NAME> .
‘ It was in an evil hour that you ever came here !
inquired the clerk in a low voice .
‘ <NAME> , my dear Sir , ’ replied the little man .
If not now , before long .
Why does she give me notice when it ’ s too late ?
‘ I said I was sorry .
<NAME> , I want to get a bed for this gentleman tonight .
`` I -- I think I 'd rather not , '' said <NAME> .
But he won ’ t see you .
`` <NAME> , '' said <NAME> submissively , `` conduct me where you will .
‘ How can you ask me ? ’ said that gentleman .
Have I been silent all these years , and shall I not speak now ?
‘ What do you advise , Mr Carker ? ’ said <NAME> , smiling .
‘ She got nervous , and couldn ’ t hold out .
He then rang a little bell , and the young gentleman came in .
<NAME> promised , and I lay down , for I was very heavy .
`` Quite orderly and right , <NAME> . ''
“ Do you know the young man ? ” said I .
‘ <NAME> , if you please , ’ said I to the waiter .
‘ <NAME> _in silk stockings ! ’ exclaimed <NAME> jocosely .
It was a bare room , partitioned off from the gallery with unpainted wood .
Be here to take him to-morrow , if you please .
Yes , he said ; at different times of the night , three .
‘ What more could I do ? ’ returned his wife mildly .
‘ Lor , brother ! ’ said <NAME> , with a deprecating smile .
At <NAME> they procured a conveyance to <NAME> .
'They 're the board 's choosing , sir , ' returned the matron .
‘ I spend my savings so , once every year .
‘ I have , ’ said his Uncle .
In the matter of gravy he is adamant .
I had no evil design in it , sir .
You did not say so then . ''
'Here 's one with such a beautiful , delicate beard ! '
Get out of the room !
returned <NAME> with tears in her eyes .
<NAME> and <NAME> drones on .
'Cut my limbs off one by one ! '
I object to the assertion made by my son .
‘ <NAME> ’ t run after him on any account .
And Jo and he , upon this little earth , shall meet no more .
‘ Yes ! ’ said <NAME> , with a hopeful smile .
‘ I have not been sent .
‘ You have no commission from him , perhaps ? ’ ‘ I ?
It was agreed to be done ; and a most melancholy day I passed .
‘ You are incomprehensible this morning , ’ said <NAME> .
'Is the young gentleman to come too , sir ? '
You ’ re about right there , ’ replied <NAME> .
‘ That ‘ ere young lady , ’ replied <NAME> .
Allow me to have the pleasure of taking you by the hand . ''
as if he had never heard of ubiquitous Jacques in his time .
In fact , he had not been to bed .
Do you think she ’ ll miss you ?
‘ It only wants two minutes , <NAME> .
<NAME> and happy , as she said that day !
<NAME> will be , I suppose .
`` And your brother , <NAME> !
He has a good many years before him , no doubt .
‘ You don ’ t know that girl ’ s passionate and proud character .
‘ Have a blow at it , ’ said the old woman , coaxingly .
“ I am not a shoemaker by trade ?
The two children ’ s faces , and they get older .
Being shown out , they repair to <NAME> 's residence to dine .
The crowd grew light with uncovered heads ; and again the shout uprose .
But it is all one to both ; neither is troubled about that .
'They -- they 're mine , <NAME> ; my little property .
There ’ s a deal of sin outside .
He said a man was not to be dictated to .
<NAME> copies to be written ?
Did Mr Pancks know anything about her ?
A cool , waxy , blown-out woman , who had never lighted well .
Nohows ? ’ said the <NAME> , ruminating , and staring all round .
‘ This is indeed a meeting !
`` Expect the second on the next night at the same hour .
Mr <NAME> chuckled , consequently , when he heard the tidings .
`` Observe the case , my dear <NAME> .
`` That is what I mean , '' said my guardian .
The simple fruits of the earth .
All was close and still .
I followed her at a distance , and saw her go up the staircase .
‘ There ’ s nothing to be afraid of .
Next moment , Mr Wegg is stumping under the gaslights and through the mud .
I say so now , again .
It was natural that he should look at it , unknown to <NAME> .
I am quite at your service . ''
With this project formed , we went to bed .
'We compromise her safety , perhaps , by staying here .
The cushion had been removed , and the <NAME> was not there .
On the contrary , the coach begins to roll back upon No .
They both pass out , and Durdles relocks it , and pockets his key .
'As nails , ' added <NAME> .
says <NAME> again after going through the ceremony with some stiffness .
‘ You are a villain , ’ said <NAME> .
What I did you can do .
It ’ ll look but a poor dead flat without the <NAME> .
‘ Pshaw ! ’ <NAME> muttered , forcing a laugh .
‘ I don ’ t think you consider -- ’ I began .
<NAME> <NAME> looked at him .
`` My time grows short , '' observed the <NAME> .
I never thought there was harm in the girl .
“ I am going to <NAME> , ” she told me .
<NAME> was out at a little supper most nights , with fascinating company .
And he then spoke , looking straight into her kindling eyes .
Why should you , Mr Riah ?
Or the Speaker of the <NAME> of <NAME> ?
‘ Remarkably so , indeed , ’ replied <NAME> .
One should name a history .
Be so good as to go on .
I observed all day that <NAME> was graver and steadier than the two gentlemen .
<NAME> those dry old bones of yours this way .
That ’ s all. ’ ‘ I have answered it .
The journey was then resumed .
I had <NAME> in my arms .
‘ Is <NAME> ’ s <NAME> here ? ’ asked <NAME> .
`` I believe it , now attend to <NAME> .
He was so good and wise to ask ME whether he was right !
‘ I assure you she is , my lord , ’ returned Mrs. Nickleby .
`` The colour hurts my eyes , '' she said .
One beneficial effect , however , the encounter had upon him .
He had a word to say to me .
You alone say you can ’ t do it .
I am hard to wake , odd times . ''
And this was his whole stock of knowledge or suspicion on the subject .
They was all dug out under my eyes .
The red cap and tri-colour cockade were universal , both among men and women .
My dear , let us go in . ''
`` He has never hurt anybody but himself , '' says <NAME> , smiling .
Only one face , familiar of old , was in the Lodge .
‘ Perhaps so , ’ replied the old man doubtfully .
But I so arranged it , as that I should meet <NAME> first .
A whisper circulates that this is <NAME> .
Go out and ask who is the chief person in the place .
'All the better for you , you have . '
He made her another bow .
She is a most affectionate creature , as I have reason to say . ''
Surely he will never harm us , <NAME> .
Played it , I understand , like one o ’ clock -- beautiful !
I say nothing to <NAME> , but we understand each other .
I hope you are the same. ’ ‘ Yes , <NAME> ; yes .
There is no trace of any , elsewhere .
'No , no , ' replied the old gentleman .
<NAME> sat at her needlework in her old place .
And so she says to her , why do you keep it there ?
So they parted until dinner-time .
He is always dirty , sullen , and taciturn .
until he absolutely wept with sentiment .
But to be sure there were rum everythings .
She did not greatly alter in appearance .
Was I right , or was I wrong ?
I have said you managed capitally .
How merry little Em ’ ly made herself about it !
A positive light appeared to issue from <NAME> 's calves .
'Let it rest with <NAME> , then , ' interposed <NAME> .
‘ He is , ’ said <NAME> .
If _that_ was beginning it -- ” said <NAME> .
Customers seldom went in to purchase , except perhaps out of curiosity .
But which of us is sad now ?
Words never to be answered , those , upon the earth-side of the grave .
The lights and shadows dance upon the horses ’ heads like imps .
‘ How do you do , <NAME> ? ’ said Mr Dombey .
‘ But this is not all .
Thus <NAME> , who had never struck a blow in her life .
‘ Indifferent , my dear sir , ’ returned <NAME> , sighing .
The sound of the familiar voice seemed to calm her again .
<NAME> was hard with him or with me .
A sense of his injustice is within him , all along .
‘ Shall I go on , <NAME> ? ’ said the <NAME> .
'You can talk as you eat , ca n't you ? '
Is the lady so very alarming ?
<NAME> <NAME> disappeared this afternoon and left a letter for him that looks bad .
The time of leaving <NAME> for <NAME> is noon .
' I may be too late , even now . '
‘ Do I love thee , <NAME> ? ’ said he .
The excitement into which he had been roused was leaving him .
He was shot last night .
‘ You owe me half of this. ’ ‘ Yer lie !
They look at each other again , still more seriously than before .
<NAME> <NAME> , when <NAME> himself unconsciously enlightened me .
<NAME> <NAME> was as agreeable at breakfast as he had been overnight .
Give it a little gruel if it is . '
She has as good a head-piece as the best .
'Go home , do , you little brute , ' said the other .
The heavenly bodies is philosophy , and the earthly bodies is philosophy .
‘ It goes off of its own accord .
`` I hope it is , little woman .
‘ I will join them , ’ said <NAME> .
The whole house is yours above there , ’ said her father , slowly .
`` Bless your heart for a true woman !
Mrs. <NAME> instantly burst into tears , and <NAME> evinced great emotion .
There is encouragement in the sound to him .
'Not a bit of it , ' replied <NAME> , interposing .
Here ’ s a collection of ‘ em .
Did you find the letter , my bird ?
‘ And <NAME> and <NAME> are like <NAME> .
What has my life been ?
I call to mind the time her daughter died .
The young woman had better go .
‘ What is the name of the house ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
But I never own to it before her .
Then , seeing how serious my Lady is , looks puzzled and surprised .
She held the cup in her hand even now .
It came under my particular notice when I sold off Kimber by auction .
Nominated , constituted , and appointed him .
'Softly , but not so slow .
And let us tranquillize ourselves by making a compact .
‘ Look round here , <NAME> , at them red curtains .
This was rather too violent exercise to last long .
All has broken down beneath me .
‘ I thought I ’ d give you a call , ’ he said .
‘ Then how capital must it be to Me !
I ’ ve been a Grubber from a boy .
‘ She always comes for it .
To this effect , in as few or fewer words , the <NAME> .
‘ Come , come ! ’ said the Secretary .
'Yes ; well , what of it ?
cried <NAME> ; 'drop the kid , and show 'em your heels . '
Except one , which was apart from his necessary progress through the mill .
Ve-ry mortifying , is it not ? ''
'It 's natural and proper to be afraid , under such circumstances .
I was brought here , I was brought to my living grave .
‘ <NAME> is <NAME> , ’ said the man in the stockings .
‘ No , by the <NAME> !
He did n't call it a particularly curious coincidence ; most coincidences were curious .
said <NAME> ; 'there 's more things besides tills to be emptied . '
The very best of news .
‘ But dear me , there was a good deal of fun going on .
But they are very eloquent , very , very eloquent .
inquired the gentleman in the white waistcoat .
She never spoke a word to me but what was pleasant and right .
“ Now , I tell you what ! ” said <NAME> .
There is the <NAME> of <NAME> .
And as yet the better nature had the stronger hold .
and Mrs. Micawber ! ’ I repeated .
Whether he believed it was dangerous ?
‘ And an old man besides , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Did you ever lodge at <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> ?
<NAME> was in the <NAME> near you ? ’ said I .
I saw <NAME> soothe and please you by his praise of her !
It is your only hope of safety . '
I have told you you shall live to see .
This train of indecision must surely be worked out now or never .
Gracious Powers , where was this to end !
Give us a kiss , my pets .
‘ N-n-no , I don ’ t know that , ’ replied Squeers .
What can you anticipate when they 're so handsome as that ?
I have nothing to defend , or to explain away .
I can not breathe the air that he corrupts .
See how patiently and methodically he goes to work .
‘ And well I may , ’ rejoined the manager .
The 'prentices think somebody may have been murdered there in bygone times .
<NAME> says he must think of his poor mother .
Now , that momentary look had said , ‘ You , of all people !
I can take only three , on account of the Mangle .
‘ <NAME> ’ s mad ! ’ said <NAME> .
His fear was for the child .
‘ <NAME> ! ’ said the boy in a low voice .
It sets my teeth on edge to think of it .
I don ’ t know what you mean. ’ ‘ Pardon me .
‘ His Honour the Mayor does me too much credit , ’ returned <NAME> .
‘ There is no deception now , <NAME> .
‘ Only a quarter , and a month or so , ’ replied <NAME> .
<NAME> indulgence has ruined me .
To 60 <NAME> <NAME> 67 <NAME> , and its Solitary Prison 81 <NAME> .
And a great deal more to the like artless purpose .
“ The <NAME> , called <NAME> , ” said the first .
We had a servant , of course .
said he with a melancholy smile .
It has aroused all the dogs in the neighbourhood , who bark vehemently .
I mention this because I am coming to <NAME> again .
'The very book he has in his hand . '
'Is this the boy , sir ! '
He was embellished with spectacles , and wore a white neckerchief .
‘ Have you been seeing any spirits ? ’ inquired the old gentleman .
Presently my Lady calls her .
What are you stopping me for ? '
He looks across his arm at my Lady .
‘ Yes , I am as happy as it ’ s possible to be .
It 's your throw , my dear ! ''
`` My dear , I think so now .
the President desired to know .
said the man , seating himself deliberately .
He seemed to breathe more cheerily .
Another day ’ s sun saw him at <NAME> .
so all the world of love and hatred and indifference around them !
Surely these facts were strong against a fancy that scarcely dared to hint itself .
<NAME> this way , sir , if you please . ''
‘ It will do you good , sir .
( The idea of my wisdom ! )
‘ I can tell it for myself , ’ was the reply .
<NAME> ! ” <NAME> was already calling at the door when he got there .
`` Why , who can she be ? ''
Now , come in and shut the door .
where is , where is it ?
We had our pea-coats with us , and I took a bag .
It arrested his steps , and he looked all around .
`` For you , '' said <NAME> with a kiss .
But do you think that I would have been enticed to say a word !
Here there was another pause .
‘ Here you ’ ll find yourself , as large as life .
He is so kind and tender to me .
After this long delay , every minute is an age .
‘ Pretty Polly ! ’ said the <NAME> .
`` You know me , and I know you .
Why did you do it ?
<NAME> <NAME> was expected back presently from the <NAME> .
No , nor did he believe it even now .
The door was not fastened within , and yielded smoothly to her hesitating hand .
‘ Yes , this is it , ’ said <NAME> .
It is a considerable advantage to a man to have so inexhaustible a subject .
`` I would sooner go -- somewhere else . ''
On this day , of all days in the year ?
And <NAME> called her Julia .
I ’ m going to tell you .
All this wasteful , wanton chess-playing IS very strange .
The little <NAME> had cabinets in various departments of science too .
<NAME> <NAME> brings the finger into play as an emollient .
The second , you know what .
I will dispense with excuses .
He turns away and stands for a while looking out at the covered passage .
‘ Indeed you shall not trouble yourself , ’ said Mrs. Nickleby .
'The lying-in room , I suppose ? '
Well ! ’ he paused a moment , then went on .
Quartered in this dingy hatchment commemorative of <NAME> are the legal bearings of <NAME> .
<NAME> ’ t be afeerd , <NAME> ’ otherest , ’ said <NAME> .
But to return once more .
Your father will be free within a few days .
Did n't make you at all uneasy ? ''
It is quite dark now , and the gas-lamps have acquired their full effect .
Why should he go to <NAME> , except to harass me ?
Who knows what he is doing , who is careless what he does !
'Nor sold him anything , perhaps ? '
I ’ m in a business.—Ah , me !
‘ This is odd , <NAME> , ’ said Mr Meagles , softly .
It ’ s nothing new to me .
<NAME> was the name which many people delighted to give him .
He was willing to believe that <NAME> had conceived a personal dislike to himself .
What can we do for ourself ?
'Well , my dear , ' replied the Jew. -- 'Ah !
'Say it again , you wile , owdacious fellow ! '
Nothing short of flying will keep pace with me , to-day . '
So they stopped for a moment , looking about .
I doubt if I should abuse the permission .
I think of a great many things .
No , he ain't. ” “ Nevvy ? ” said the strange man .
<NAME> is outside , is he , my dear ? ''
The whelp went home , and went to bed .
A staring baronet , with a truncheon , gets a dimple in his chin .
Now , what did she answer ?
There was no fish for breakfast , and not much of anything else .
‘ <NAME> ; ’ introducing the <NAME> Gentleman ’ s broken column .
‘ A fine morning , <NAME> ! ’ said <NAME> , entering the office .
I was the means of sending him abroad .
Mrs General was in her pure element .
‘ No , sir. ’ ‘ Then listen , if you please .
Why should I go to see them , therefore ?
‘ I have claimed nothing ; and I claim nothing .
‘ Not caring what becomes of me !
The notice was too short after so long a prepossession the other way .
`` Does <NAME> think so too ? ''
cries Grandfather Smallweed , rubbing his legs .
His mother had died , years before .
I ’ ve run from it too many a year .
But we can ’ t make it right among us to have it so .
‘ If Mr <NAME> will honour us , we shall be happy .
`` Do you know this turning ? ''
Come to the pint at once .
The lights were turned out , and the work went on .
‘ What a mooney godmother you are , after all ! ’ returned <NAME> .
His snuff was princes ’ mixture ; his scent _bouquet du roi_ .
I see ! ’ said my aunt .
It dropped into the till , I suppose .
I spoke without consideration when I used it .
‘ You are very good , ’ said <NAME> .
The shambling figure , and the scanty great-coat , were not to be mistaken .
I wish I had died then , with that feeling in my heart !
You are following what I say , my child ? ''
nothing like it , sir , ’ replied <NAME> solemnly .
<NAME> replies , “ No such orders. ” <NAME> argues point .
They did not , as yet , look at one another .
‘ You are welcome to the <NAME> , sir .
Belonged to the <NAME> , didn ’ t he ?
‘ You are very right , sir , ’ he rejoined with spirit .
‘ I appeal to the company .
<NAME> <NAME> took Mrs. Waterbrook .
The voice was soft and gentle .
<NAME> seemed just what Mrs. <NAME> had expected him to be .
What are you listening at my door for , <NAME> ? ''
If so be as he ’ s alive , my opinion is he will .
The effect of this act of jaculation is twofold .
Those , too , were written at another time .
So , he took up his hat and rambled out again .
I am ready to go . ''
`` I thought the <NAME> were a polite nation , I did , really .
And she must be turned for , must Mrs Higden .
Do not be hard upon me , but take that into account .
I am glad to hear it ! ''
I have n't the art to do it .
You may pay for him , if you like .
He had brought <NAME> out in his arms -- poor fellow !
I know that ’ s much more in your thoughts than mine .
‘ Will she be able to go home today ? ’ asked <NAME> .
Not a vestige of it was to be seen .
One called the <NAME> was the best recommended .
You can ’ t wrest from me what I have not got .
You really are going it at a great pace , you know .
‘ My dearest love , ’ said he , ‘ what could I do ?
‘ To make , ’ said <NAME> .
She merely moves her head in reply .
I plucked at my hair .
<NAME> bless you , my dears , an infant , an infant ! ''
‘ Where she brought out , ’ said Mr Toots , ‘ this newspaper .
He was astonished , but by no means dismayed .
`` Yes , I will go , <NAME> ! ''
He alights first , and passes immediately into his own room .
‘ Nothing can be fairer , ’ observed <NAME> .
'Has his housekeeper gone too ? '
‘ A long way , <NAME> , ’ the child replied .
Sit down , and let me hear it all .
says <NAME> in some discomfiture .
He replied , certainly not , and that the lodger was <NAME> .
were you waiting there , brother ? ’ demanded the <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , impatiently .
<NAME> <NAME> , followed by Mercuries with lamps and candles .
I dare say you know it .
that 's the boy , is it ? '
Such are the Institutions at <NAME> !
Talk of orange flowers indeed !
She has not many gentlemen left .
‘ She is found. ’ ‘ <NAME> found her ? ’ demanded <NAME> hastily .
The thing is worth nothing to me .
I gracefully departed. ’ Her face neither acquiesced nor demurred .
And she glanced for an instant at the shawl she wore .
So far as I could understand , they rarely presented themselves at all .
I think you do already , ’ said his master .
`` I do n't know , I am sure ! ''
returns the lawyer , rubbing his nose with the key .
I should never be safe not to be off again .
Wot are you a-settin ’ down there for ?
And adds , `` But it do n't matter .
Her poor heart ? ’ said <NAME> .
What are you talking about , <NAME> ?
Everything was as it used to be , in the happy time .
Indeed I will , ’ said the boy , earnestly .
Do not shut me out of what concerns your happiness so nearly !
Now , near that house of entertainment there 's a piece of water .
I have answered it for you -- and now they are out of sight .
I hope there is nothing amiss with the sister of my old pupil ?
It was saved by an accident .
‘ You my father , <NAME> ! ’ retorted <NAME> .
<NAME> was <NAME> in person .
You may naturally think that my immediate object is money .
‘ Very difficult to fit too , because their figures are so uncertain .
Now , what do you think the lawyer making the inquiries wants ? ''
and go through with it , ’ murmured <NAME> .
'Yes , sir , ' replied the servant .
‘ I know the rascal , ’ replied <NAME> good-humouredly .
‘ Then stand up against them !
I am sensitive , ardent , conscientious , and imaginative .
<NAME> in help if they do n't go .
‘ The lady not being a widow , ’ said <NAME> , smiling .
`` And what do you know ? ''
The servant did not know ; but would go and inquire .
‘ Be quiet , <NAME> , ’ resumed <NAME> .
'Always interrupting , you are , partner !
‘ <NAME> , <NAME> ? ’ said <NAME> .
A gentleman must be waited on , I hope ?
' I have not slept under a roof since I left the country . '
More bewildering to him than his misery , far .
“ Good night , <NAME> , ” said the man of business .
No motives but motives of sheer patriotism ?
<NAME> was very difficult to move from the beaten track .
‘ They are only opened in both shells , ’ said I .
I wonder which way did we take when we came out of that shop .
‘ Then see here , sir , ’ said his uncle .
I ’ m used to it , and use is everything .
No ; he loved her in his old way .
Let me know , and I ’ ll give you something .
<NAME> <NAME> expected the reverse ; ‘ and is married to a silver-chaser .
But of course you don ’ t mean what you say .
While he remained , not a word was spoken .
Who suffers by his ill whims !
She is a timid little thing , and easily disturbed and frightened .
‘ You made me jump , Charley. ’ ‘ Jump !
`` That is a good fortune , '' said I .
“ Woman imbecile and pig-like ! ” said <NAME> , frowning .
I am one of the roughs . ''
He smokes gravely and marches in slow time .
There ’ s no change in her .
`` But why should she walk shoeless through all that water ? ''
I must have written half-a-dozen answers at least .
Nor does it become less prepossessing on a closer acquaintance .
I ’ m not going to forgive you .
`` To be sure , to be sure ! ''
This was his great theme .
‘ To whom then ? ’ demanded Mr Carker .
I recall these things that I may be contradicted if I am wrong .
“ Put it on , put it on , ” said the other .
There is no hurry or greediness apparent in the despatch of the meal .
The women were out of the question .
A great deal better , ’ said <NAME> quickly .
replied the Jew , looking round as he plied the bellows .
<NAME> , freely , both by <NAME> and by me .
She can ’ t have been gone long .
Mr <NAME> ’ s rooms were reached .
I mean any minor point . ''
And you know little Flite ? ''
The fog may clear in an hour or two .
‘ Oh , come you know , this is too barefaced .
It ain ’ t <NAME> as <NAME> ’ VE been giving your mind to .
Her very limited intercourse with Mr <NAME> rendered this hard to find out .
‘ Good plate this here , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> to his friend .
‘ Her health. ’ He took a sip .
Vould you , sir ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
I ask you to think of it .
`` You 'd bite her , I suspect , '' says <NAME> .
cried a faint and feeble voice .
But I made a modest reply , and we shook hands warmly .
With the highest respect for you. ’ ‘ Thankee , ’ said Mr Boffin .
‘ How ’ s the pie ? ’ he said , rousing himself .
Where can I move to ! ''
Mrs <NAME> had three ideas upon the subject of the terrible reverse .
Scores of men must have passed their last hours there .
'The board allows you coals , do n't they , Mrs .
‘ A drop of comfort here .
'Poor <NAME> , where have you been , <NAME> ? '
nonsense ! ’ said <NAME> , reddening .
‘ No , <NAME> , not a word !
`` Worth a mint of money , Mr .
`` <NAME> , '' he answered , `` back .
There ’ s plenty belonging to me .
‘ Poor me , poor me , my head is so bad .
The time is early in the evening ; the weather moist and raw .
The deed was not then accomplished , neither did he confide in me .
‘ Now , wait a bit , <NAME> ; there ’ s something more .
<NAME> listened , with his eyes cast down .
What do you think of it ?
An old gray-headed man tottered forward to slake his burning thirst .
You are a hard-hearted Miser .
‘ I doen ’ t know but I am .
said <NAME> , raising his hat to me with polished politeness .
“ I am tired , ” said <NAME> .
Under submission , might it be worth thinking of at any odd time ?
'No , ' rejoined the matron , slightly colouring as she spoke .
<NAME> <NAME> inclines his head again .
“ He is in <NAME> at present .
He is in the meanest and closest of small rooms .
No , says <NAME> , I have not , but I will .
“ Show me the <NAME> ! ” said <NAME> .
The rest of its features were voluntary , and they were these .
After that , I came here to see the sister for myself .
She saw it not , and cared not whether it was there or no .
<NAME> <NAME> seemed to approve of this even more .
You follow what I say. ’ He moved his head in assent .
No such adjuration entered <NAME> ’ s head .
I had been telling her all that had happened overnight .
‘ We have even exceeded that number .
responded the girl , with a laugh .
‘ <NAME> was paralysed , and could make no reply .
In the name of wonder !
And what do you call these , my darling ? ''
<NAME> , I trust to your truth , in this thing as in everything .
Six years I hammered at the fiddle .
A Plea in the <NAME> 30 .
‘ I thank you many times .
How do you do again ?
I want some information from you .
I couldn ’ t think of agreeing to it .
Arrived at his destination he looked out , and surveyed it carefully .
And so we were married , ’ said my mother simply .
‘ Then what do I recommend ?
Here 's the new boy a murdering of me !
It comes on to blow a boisterous gale .
'Do you want to be grabbed , stupid ? '
The city watch-house is a part of the building .
They are met at the very threshold with this mild appeal .
Do n't you see all this ? '
We will not stop here another day .
Mr <NAME> , crushed and submissive , obeyed .
But <NAME> could not forget the old design of so many years .
`` <NAME> 's pardon -- victim of rash action -- brains . ''
[ Picture : Sleeping it off ] ‘ What ?
she said with a parting curtsy .
‘ O ’ course it must , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Well you ARE going to do it , mother !
‘ I am waiting for him , sir , ’ returned Mr Fledgeby .
'Why everybody lets him alone enough , for the matter of that .
Always agreeable to see that relation playfully maintained .
You take it where you can find it .
Used to drop your head , and sing yourself off like a bird !
You are not unknown here , you are not unappreciated .
‘ Kidderminster , stow that ! ’ said <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> , ’ rejoined <NAME> , ‘ I will .
<NAME> <NAME> ’ s domestic circle was limited to himself and his wife .
He is a very creditable artist himself .
<NAME> 's colour had entirely left her , and <NAME> was scarcely less pale .
My enemy can not know it better .
‘ All right , ’ he said in a low voice .
‘ I would have his house pulled down .
At length he neared the wreck .
‘ You will never let me serve you as I ought .
She , the child of the <NAME> ; he , the lock-keeper .
He felt the <NAME> 's glance , and stopped .
Mr <NAME> was quick to do so , and <NAME> was quick to return .
I -- I would rather not press the case . '
‘ <NAME> ! ’ said <NAME> .
I ’ ll tell them you ’ re come back .
He would ’ n ha ’ suspect ’ n me .
‘ What is it ? ’ I asked with a smile .
'Yes ; that 's all you women think of , ' answered <NAME> .
Her father rose with her , and kept her hand drawn through his arm .
<NAME> , with his eyes darting fire , seized him by the collar .
‘ I am tired to death , ’ said she .
He walked as softly as the <NAME> in <NAME> , and more slowly .
The old housekeeper leaves her with the letter in her hand .
<NAME> was better than his word .
‘ Grant me the favour of half-a-dozen words .
Well , I ’ ll tell you again .
<NAME> <NAME> accepted this trust , too ; but was not sanguine .
‘ What do you say , now ?
<NAME> knows , she might have set her mind at rest , poor child !
said <NAME> , leaning back in his chair .
‘ You pair of madmen ! ’ said <NAME> , facing about .
`` Was it at all like this ?
I come straight from his bedside .
You draw me to you .
I felt very sorry. ’ ‘ Forced upon him , <NAME> !
Have I been made the bye-word of all kinds of men ?
'All that , my dear , you shall hear from me .
I little thought then that I left it , never to return .
'He is so jolly green ! '
What is it after all ?
‘ I have no right to feel hurt at what you say .
'It must have been a dream , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
“ You deceive yourself , monsieur , ” returned the keeper of the wine-shop .
I haven ’ t much to boast of .
I ’ ve shown my confidence in the lad .
He is gone to that bourne from whence no traveller returns .
Exclusion itself ! ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> so alone in the bleak world that nothing else remained to her ?
He attends to me much more than my own daughter .
He said I was to do it .
I think the best side of such people is almost hidden from us .
’ <NAME> not by _them_ the trouble ’ s made , sir .
He had established his right to the corner , by imperceptible prescription .
cries <NAME> , slapping his thigh .
The day comes like a phantom .
She ’ s always full of mystery ; I hate her .
Now take my arm , will you ?
`` It is a rare wine now , '' says <NAME> .
It would ill become me to bear malice .
The jailer touched him on the shoulder .
I thought I heard you call me twice before ! ’ No response .
There is nothing in you to like ; you know that .
The master resumes his march , and the man resumes his preparation of breakfast .
`` Next , as to your case , '' observed my guardian .
It was a happy release .
We had next to find out the number .
He appeared to be only too conscious of it himself .
They are having a regular confab together up at the <NAME> .
The latter you must develop in her , if you can .
I never saw my aunt unbend more systematically to anyone .
( He drew it towards him . )
So they passed away into the shadow and were gone .
So out went <NAME> ’ s head again .
But don ’ t be hard in your construction of me .
So the day wore on .
<NAME> stood at his pillow .
It ’ s like verbs in an exercise .
Nicholas ought to be the best judge , and I hope he is .
Is she come ? ’ <NAME> seemed to go in quest of her .
‘ I came into it without enough consideration .
We know one another perfectly .
The dog is very important. ’ <NAME> was right .
So passed the night on which the happy pair came home .
<NAME> pig ! ’ cried the visitor .
But what I ask is this .
Time for what ? ’ Another pause .
You can leave me with <NAME> , while you are gone .
He might have been gone ten minutes , when his son succeeded him .
‘ What is that ? ’ ‘ Where , dearest ? ’ ‘ There !
‘ Cap ’ en , ’ in a deep hoarse whisper .
said the undertaker 's wife , 'he 's very small . '
'Not at all , ' replied <NAME> coldly .
I involuntarily returned for answer that I perceived <NAME> knew him .
Here ’ s the Proprietor , and here ’ s his Grubber .
A great deal , if we did but know it .
‘ I am quite alone , ’ <NAME> explained as they walked on .
'No , ' rejoined the old lady .
`` But you answer like <NAME> . ''
‘ You needn ’ t take your hand away to do that .
I will live in the <NAME> , the Present , and the <NAME> .
I am not the last boy in the school .
<NAME> knows all their windings and turnings , and we are upon them everywhere .
‘ But do you really think so , <NAME> ?
`` And do you live alone here with these babies , <NAME> ? ''
My dear , the poor emaciated creatures all but worshipped him .
‘ Can I ? ’ said the old woman .
And here he was , close following on the heels of the message .
`` The whole time , '' said the <NAME> .
<NAME> protests to <NAME> , 'What 's this for ?
I am without money to-night , by chance .
‘ When is she coming again , <NAME> ? ’ asked the fat lady .
Their replies did not encourage him .
Of course they stopped too , instantly .
<NAME> , your mother took this course with you .
<NAME> in and speak to her , sir !
I left him here when I went home , ’ returned <NAME> .
I 'll not deceive you , <NAME> .
‘ Yes , and all boys , ’ replied the stranger .
What was he to do ?
They walked through the <NAME> to the other end .
I wonder she was never afraid that something would happen to her .
<NAME> <NAME> 's eye comes back without any new intelligence in it .
thought <NAME> , turning sick with fear .
She extended her hand again .
He passed twice through the <NAME> while I was there .
These are not its only artifices .
You should know , <NAME> .
They express themselves , and I leave them to themselves .
I say , you do n't happen to have heard of a murder ? ''
Ve-ry absurd , to be a little rambling , is it not ?
Why , my goodness ! ’ ‘ Ah ! ’ says <NAME> .
But perhaps it is only temporary .
She was distressed in mind ; and the cause of her distress was <NAME> .
she added , disengaging her hand , 'why should we prolong this painful interview ?
Mrs. Micawber put on her brown gloves , and assumed a genteel languor .
As inquisitive as secret. ’ ‘ Ah !
Already the snow had begun to be foot-thawed again about the door .
it was late , and Mr <NAME> feared he must .
It was a gentleman of a dark complexion -- a young surgeon .
`` And this is not a conspiracy , perhaps ? ''
said the old man , coming slowly out of his abstraction .
Can ’ t I bring up , nohows ?
Suppose it should not be done enough !
‘ Mr Casby and his daughter are with her .
‘ Wo-o ! ’ echoed <NAME> and <NAME> , from the bin .
I knew it , on the instant , quite as well as <NAME> .
It contained quite a show of beautiful geraniums .
I know it , and have heard my father say so .
He seems to want it . '
I wished to call to his remembrance the look he had given me then .
One more look -- one little look -- at that sweet face .
here is my bold friend !
When he came , my aunt performed the ceremony of introduction .
I expect you 'll have an invitation to-morrow .
‘ Thank you , sir -- thank you ; ’ exclaimed Mrs. <NAME> hysterically .
‘ You see I have him secure here .
‘ Then begin at once , ’ said <NAME> .
Now I have said all .
Some of them may see it there .
Owing to some confusion in the dark , the door was gone .
To which <NAME> retorts , `` Who says so ? ''
Doctors ’ <NAME> was approached by a little low archway .
Mr <NAME> was serenely gazing at the stars , quite absorbed in celestial contemplation .
<NAME> ’ s the word. ’ List and the gipsy acquiesced .
‘ Your Reverence , he has gone home quite himself .
This morose journeyman had no liking for me .
'The kindest , best of friends .
You can easily knock them off ; one part helps the other so much .
How am I to live ?
“ <NAME> 's brother , sir , ” said <NAME> .
Everything within his view was lovely and placid .
<NAME> <NAME> almost fainted with horror and dismay .
Little <NAME> had been thinking too .
There were but two , but they were everywhere .
‘ Little mother ! ’ ‘ She is the grand-daughter -- ’ said <NAME> .
Why didn ’ t you come and have a pipe or two of comfort ?
‘ I hate our landlord ! ’ said <NAME> .
It was very bad in me , but indeed it was not wicked .
I admire it the more in others .
But there was no confusion or disorder .
‘ “ I will , ” said my uncle .
<NAME> for it , Wegg. ’ <NAME> took the book and turned the leaves .
pray have mercy on me , and do not make me steal .
`` Now , will you come upstairs ? ''
You are candid , honest , open-hearted , fair-dealing men !
You know , a perfect general ! ''
They were not glow-worms ; they were too high .
<NAME> <NAME> tapped her foot upon the floor and wiped her eyes .
or is he walking to and fro ?
' I never heard the name before . '
`` You intend to give me no other notice ? ''
said the gentleman , 'he has hurt himself . '
I said , ‘ How do you do , Miss <NAME> ?
You having got security , and there being enough to pay you ?
'The disclosure of to-night , ' -- <NAME> began .
I withdrew them softly , and they fell listlessly on her bosom .
It ’ s all the fault of you two wretches .
I will not go from you with him .
He rushed forward with fury in his looks , and fire in his eye .
‘ Be as rich as you honestly can .
‘ Then who puts such things into his head ? ’ said Mr Dombey .
‘ Ay , he is thriving , ’ said the mother .
In this particular , his influence upon her was equally powerless with mine .
Two nights and a day exhausted it .
He is a tremendous fellow . ''
You may be certain that I will save you at whatever cost .
This is she ? ” She and no other .
‘ Perfectly right , dear <NAME> .
The day soon came for our going .
‘ Not so easily , ’ returned <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> professed himself much flattered and honoured .
Do n't shrink from anything I say .
It would be better to allow her for her keep . ''
stop one instant , ’ returned the other .
He always worries about me , and moddley-coddleys in the merest trifles .
said the doctor , waving his hand .
‘ Now <NAME> , wake up ! ’ ‘ <NAME> ?
Not to be done , sir !
muttered the Jew to himself as he turned homeward .
‘ I won ’ t have it read out .
I only tell it you , as I can recollect it .
Walking , <NAME> would recommend for that .
The last day of the appointed week touched the bars of the <NAME> gate .
Give it a name , <NAME> ! ’ said <NAME> , with hospitable ease .
my dear -- ’ interposed Mrs. Pott .
I demand of you , why ?
'Of course , of course , ' replied <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> alone was silent and reserved .
Do your duty , but be careful not to overstep it .
It was now intensely dark .
That is not in question between us now .
‘ That ’ s a dear , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Is my present endurance none ?
That it could soften or relent , appeared next to impossible .
But there was no shadow thrown upon it from within .
And your prayer is mine. ’ ‘ You ha ’ a father .
He was full of eloquence .
`` And where did you see her , <NAME> ? ''
So he said , and I did not contradict him .
Wo n't he be glad to see you ?
The principle is the same , I think ? ''
Why should he be vexed or sore at heart ?
That ’ s all they ’ ll have to do .
‘ Good-bye , my dear ! ’ said <NAME> .
You need be at no loss to guess why , my dear .
Laughingly , <NAME> looked to <NAME> for an explanation of this odd visit .
Take the case of the slaves on <NAME> plantations .
cried the gentleman , 'Better or worse ? '
<NAME> <NAME> is very difficult to move from the beaten track .
I am not clever enough .
I hoped it was true ? ” “ It was .
`` College , '' returns <NAME> in short sentences , bassoon-like .
He was seven years older than I .
What do you say to this , <NAME> ? ''
I have left my Lady .
said <NAME> when we got upstairs .
The first is your number one , the second my number one .
‘ <NAME> ! ’ exclaimed <NAME> , rising from his chair .
I can still walk twenty mile if I am put to it .
<NAME> stops in the middle of a bite and looks petrified .
It meant , considering her virtues , sacrifices , and so forth .
‘ I should like to have a look at it .
The garden was cool and solitary .
To <NAME> ’ s son , or daughter ?
said the keeper , who , with his wife , was looking after her .
It was a rewarding of sin ; the wrong result of a delusion .
And I saw that he was very sorry for me .
'She took it , did she ? '
The village looks at him by stealth , for it is afraid .
‘ Nothing the matter , ma ’ am , ’ replied the stranger .
Why did you never give those confounded papers the lie ?
Nevertheless , not a moment was lost ; not a moment !
Is it not another carriage at a gallop ?
Time and place can not bind <NAME> .
`` No , guv'ner , no ; not so bad as that .
I knew what the devotion of her nature was .
I would n't have done it , sir .
<NAME> , madame , I don ’ t know .
I did it millions and billions of times .
‘ But you are not dead , you know , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ On that point we always agree .
He had no notion whatever .
'Come , get up , ' said the man , roughly .
The ship was clearing fast of strangers .
`` No doubt , '' is <NAME> 's composed reply .
Next day the knitting and watching began again , and lasted all day .
She never left off , or left us for a moment .
‘ <NAME> , that ’ s all right , ’ said <NAME> .
'They want to shut up the yard . '
inquired the Jew , with a disappointed countenance .
<NAME> also smoked , with his eyes negligently turned on the informer .
<NAME> , lady of piety , it must be !
`` They were left behind by somebody . ''
‘ <NAME> here half an hour. ’ ‘ Two of them ?
I ’ m smothered if the opera house isn ’ t your proper hemisphere .
I know all about it .
She now steadily pursuing her train of thought at her window , considered thereupon .
How does the mortal world go ? ''
‘ Holloa ! ’ <NAME> cries out , unmeaningly alarmed .
`` I want half a word with you , <NAME> . ''
‘ How ’ s this ? ’ said <NAME> impatiently .
I had seen at first that she was changed .
You see I am only just emerging from my lowly station .
We are going to cross here .
Without it I must have disclosed myself .
And yet a coolness grows between <NAME> and myself .
This will supply the rest of them here with something new to talk about .
You ’ ll hit something next time , if you look sharp .
'No more they have , ' acquiesced the undertaker .
I made her do double duty in one night .
<NAME> sense did it address ?
‘ Very obstinate-looking articles they are too , ’ quoth <NAME> .
Let the man listen to what I say !
I must take you as I find you .
I have the pleasure of drinking his good health . ''
‘ That ’ s it , ’ said the old gentleman .
I ’ m the wrong sort of man for ’ em , <NAME> am .
At last it is all gone .
‘ I make him wince , and smart .
His daughter ’ s at home , sitting a-looking at the fire .
I wo n't have my wittles blest off my table .
Let me go. ’ ‘ <NAME> ? ’ exclaimed Mr Dombey .
I ’ ll do the best in my power for you .
I will spend all I have , and thankfully , to procure it .
Then would you have the kindness to -- to go ?
'What 's the meaning of this ? '
I myself was born in <NAME> .
‘ Very good , <NAME> , ’ responded Mrs. Raddle , with lofty politeness .
‘ Twas kind of you to bear him company down .
Papers ! ” The papers are handed out , and read .
Oh , look at it , look at it !
‘ To doctor his own moustachios with , you know .
'You put yourself beyond its pale , ' said the gentleman .
‘ He has no command over the horse , mind .
( Those original expressions were Mr .
I went away a girl , and have come back a woman .
Now , he is almost here , now he is far away again .
‘ Bodily illness is more easy to bear than mental. ’ ‘ Ah !
In came all the young men and women employed in the business .
On second thoughts , you may enter , ’ observed <NAME> .
I distress you ; I draw fast to an end .
I never thought of lessening the distance betwixt us , I am sure .
<NAME> be calm ! ’ ‘ Who is it from ? ’ asked <NAME> .
'What are you up to ?
‘ Something in the yard , ’ replied the stranger .
and he don ’ t know me , he don ’ t know me !
To remind ’ ; and passed the intervening period in a state of dotage .
'What are you crying for ? '
How could it be his ?
Put your boot against it .
We keep to it together , mind !
A complaint of me , ’ said Mr Merdle .
<NAME> may be , but is the property ?
‘ You never do anything else , except your work .
“ Wery ill , ” says the patient .
You have lost a bow .
To think of the brightest and most fortunate accidents of life .
Supposing he had been shot .
He has to work hard .
Even so does he darken her life .
‘ I am much of your opinion , Mr Wilfer .
‘ I don ’ t know what to think .
`` Is this place of abomination consecrated ground ? ''
Sing us an <NAME> song , <NAME> !
May I venture to congratulate you ?
I am quite ready to stay behind .
‘ You are too sensitive. ’ ‘ I am sensitive , ’ he returned .
I hope I never shall be otherwise than umble .
This lasts all day and three days following .
‘ I had nothing to do but work , and so I worked .
How could I , when it was her as wanted to find it out ?
My father is greatly admired . ''
But that is not the present point .
I will take care that this is brought to a close without delay .
'It 's a fine day , after all . '
Through the desert that lay before her , she must go alone .
‘ Yes , it ’ s pretty fresh , ’ assented <NAME> .
`` I have no doubt you did .
But still the luck resisted ; wouldn ’ t come .
said the old lady , apostrophizing him with infinite vehemence .
‘ There can be no action for breach , that ’ s one comfort .
A sound of craving and eagerness that had nothing articulate in it but blood .
These are the weapons of <NAME> .
The <NAME> make various Declarations for themselves and others .
The rest is all a more or less incoherent dream .
I will not say another word upon its merits .
Its no good looking at his horse .
‘ He wants <NAME> Tomkins. ’ Here there was a general scream .
Ha ' n't you no such relations , Mr .
It is a fine quality in a young woman .
`` What set me on about country boys , and runaways , and good-for-nothings ?
'He 'll come to be scragged , wo n't he ? '
Then who , if not <NAME> ?
And <NAME> will be despatched in a wink , and she not here !
A large glass , ’ said <NAME> .
That is not the <NAME> vein , <NAME> .
I have told you I did mean it .
'Where she met two people . '
Everybody seemed to be in it !
They never called themselves rich neither .
_it is_ so ridiculous ! ’ says the apparition , stopping and shrinking .
`` What made him such a child ? ''
‘ I shall be proud -- delighted -- to execute your trust .
‘ I wonder how you can !
He prospered in his object .
We met some of these poor Indians afterwards , riding on shaggy ponies .
You asked me what harm .
This here proposal o ’ you ’ rn takes me a little aback .
<NAME> ’ s state of mind is similar .
‘ Come in ! ’ cried a voice inside .
`` Jarndyce of <NAME> , my lord , '' said <NAME> .
“ To return to poor <NAME> , ” said <NAME> .
We found it very difficult to get away from the house .
I looked surprised and inquisitive .
<NAME> and forgive all round ! ''
<NAME> <NAME> immediately became spasmodic .
`` We are never to get out of Chancery !
When it warn ’ t Em ’ ly , I went on agen .
All we think , here , is how to live .
After this little bit of philosophy there was another pause .
The bearings of this observation lays in the application on it .
I have never had such another .
he made the acquaintance of this gentleman .
‘ This is weak and foolish , weak and foolish .
How comes <NAME> in the stable , of all places in the world ?
But I shall be to and fro .
`` For two good names , hey ? ''
I begged <NAME> to ask his landlord to walk up .
The tormenting humour which was dominant there stopped them both .
The only one of that name left in the <NAME> now .
It was midnight when I arrived at home .
A shade crossed <NAME> 's face .
`` I am of a quarrelsome temper .
‘ I fear he never will be again .
‘ What a thinking steam-ingein this old lady is .
What are you up to ?
If it failed to interest him , it might send him to sleep .
If you was to leave me a doll , I should n't nuss it .
I Have a <NAME> Birthday X. I <NAME> , and <NAME> For <NAME> .
Now , my lad , try a gallop ! ''
I ’ ll never forgive you if you don ’ t .
<NAME> often remembered it , and laughed himself whenever he did so .
'Do n't play booty with me . '
The doctor shook his head .
And her make is such , that she does it credit .
“ Enough of this parley , ” said the sergeant .
In all his life , he had never made a friend .
She would like to see poor Kit , she had often said of late .
Was it you , thus buffeted as you lie here in a heap ?
Two half-pence is all the same , and four farthings is received with joy .
‘ Never mind touching your hat , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> hastily .
What should my feelings be , do you suppose ?
But even in this chamber there was a rocking-chair .
<NAME> <NAME> ! ’ ‘ Ah , ’ replied <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> never did , sir .
‘ Or that he will , to-morrow .
This broke up the party .
‘ Navy , sir ? ’ suggested <NAME> .
‘ And a Jew brought down with it !
<NAME> that. ’ ‘ Where have they gone ? ’ asked <NAME> .
Then do the frozen <NAME> thaw .
<NAME> held his knees and looked at me .
‘ Five doors farther on , ’ replied the pot-boy .
It was a loud report and echoed and rattled heavily .
<NAME> <NAME> inclined his head .
‘ Please wave it at the window , ’ was the faint reply .
Oh Mr Walter ! ’ ‘ <NAME> ! ’ cried <NAME> .
No J. D. weeping bitterly , and inconsolable .
‘ O the poor lad , the poor lad !
and the dear old lady at home , <NAME> ?
'Yes , sir , ' stammered the boy .
It would be uncommonly jolly ! ’ Her thoughtfulness baffled his cunning scrutiny .
I replied it certainly could not .
<NAME> was less audible than below , I found <NAME> comfortably settled .
‘ How are you ? ’ said Mr Meagles .
<NAME> , ” said Mrs. Pocket , “ will you ring for <NAME> ?
I know <NAME> and <NAME> a'most as well as you do , sir .

And here she sobbed too .

His other hand was locked in that of <NAME> .
'To be sure , to be sure ! '
Upon my life , I thought they had taken to lying !
who would have thought it likely , <NAME> ! ’ returned <NAME> , enthusiastically .
He would only show the deficiency of the others .
<NAME> between he says and they say ?
‘ And you really want one ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , ’ answered <NAME> .
Very glad , I 'm sure , to make your acquaintance .
It has waited for you two whole days . '
‘ Not I , ’ said the elder <NAME> .
Now it was thinking again !
'Here 's a delicious fat one , <NAME> , dear ! '
The three gentlemen spoke together apart , for a few moments .
But , <NAME> looked at her father with more boldness than <NAME> did .
‘ He doesn ’ t know her well enough .
‘ What are you then ? ’ demanded <NAME> .
‘ What a prowokin ’ little wretch it is !
But I will not submit to it !
The new-comer was introduced to <NAME> as <NAME> , the editor of the <NAME> .
<NAME> appeared to receive this communication with great interest .
With the drawback of hope deferred .
`` No offence , I hope , miss .
He had never seen her so before .
And so she said <NAME> bless you , and went . ''
Do I look like a robber !
‘ His own way ? ’ returned <NAME> .
He comes upon me too late in life .
What if we have but one home ?
He looked at father , and didn ’ t do it at once .
I will encumber you no more .
‘ Because I lay no claims to a speaking countenance .
<NAME> was the day on which I did so !
A good riddance to me , whether as clerk or client !
Near the bottom , somebody fell , and rolled down .
They embraced , and kissed each other on the cheek .
I 'm afraid I have caught cold . '
The third gentleman now stepped forth .
She could not hear it fall .
If it should come to nothing after all , he will respect my confidence .
she said over her shoulder to my guardian .
Could you point a person out for me , I want ?
Mrs General , however , observed it for her .
`` <NAME> a n't a-going to say nothink to me to-night . ''
`` You never heard of such a thing , my dear !
You shall have some eggs , and judge for yourself .
No one can understand him better than I do .
‘ I hope you won ’ t think anything about it .
‘ I was younger then , ’ tittered Mrs. Kenwigs .
‘ I want to get away .
The city can ’ t produce his equal .
6 , in the court , is there ? ’ said <NAME> .
We trust each other in about an equal degree .
<NAME> not to sink out of sight in <NAME> ’ s breast .
Of course I got out directly and took his arm .
It startled her , for it was like a sound of blows .
But there are reasons which make me very delicate of accepting your assistance .
Why do n't you let the boy alone ? '
‘ Give me your attention , <NAME> .
It ain ’ t so wonderful a case .
'At last , ' he muttered , wiping his dry and fevered mouth .
‘ But when is this to be done , <NAME> ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
A day makes no such odds . ''
‘ Oh Lillyvick ! ’ cried the bride .
The third , the Olympic , is a tiny show-box for vaudevilles and burlesques .

I love hard work ; I enjoy hard work .
It may be curious , but it is true .
‘ Your Wash-up , ’ replied <NAME> , with the smile of a favourite .
“ <NAME> has told you , ” said Mrs. Pocket .
<NAME> received him in a courtly manner , but they did not shake hands .
‘ Of course , ’ said <NAME> .
I 'll look in again , as I come down , Mrs. Maylie .
‘ Dear me ! ’ he said , considering .
`` His language is as sounding as his voice .
‘ I AM rather comfortable , sir , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Is that so ? ’ ‘ Is it so ? ’ returned <NAME> .
An opening happened to present itself that very night .
‘ You have been to <NAME> often , unfortunately ? ’ said Mr Dombey .
‘ He has shaken hands with the men , ’ cried the little agent .

He turned round : and the dismal man was at his side .
I shall be cruel when I like .
I must learn them of you .
We then took a hackney-coach and drove away to the neighbourhood of <NAME> .

‘ Can Jupe be sent here , <NAME> ? ’ asked <NAME> .
When they were worn out , he wanted them back .
Then <NAME> pokes <NAME> once , and <NAME> pokes <NAME> once .
I am styled “ gentleman ” by Act of <NAME> .
And wasn ’ t he well acquainted with the deceased and his ways ?
‘ What ventures ? ’ ‘ These <NAME> enterprises. ’ ‘ Oh !
I do not conceive that this discovery gave me much pain then .
‘ Let me be sure I ’ m right .
He keeps me on a constant see-saw .
It was long before the child closed the window , and approached her bed .
I have not by any means a quick understanding .
This family fiction was the family assertion of itself against her services .
'He is a nice-looking boy , is he not ? '
You want to be the death of me .
‘ Two of us were detained .
Instantly the ghost passed once more and was gone .
I say I do a little in that way myself .
The Father of the <NAME> 7 .
‘ No , ’ said <NAME> , with a chop .
It was past two when he went to bed .
‘ How strangely you speak , dear !
Not yet , ’ answered <NAME> , decisively .
This particularly obtains in all Parliamentary affairs .
Persons might be seeking for them even then .
‘ Now we might be in the old infernal hole again , hey ?
‘ Here is your patron , your master .
‘ Here ! ’ sneered <NAME> , stepping forward .
‘ Well , sir , ’ replied <NAME> .
‘ We shall meet again soon !
‘ To bring back <NAME> !
exclaimed <NAME> , taking the answer on himself .
‘ I shall give you neither , ’ replied <NAME> .
The <NAME> , & c. , is on view .
‘ Oh , dear me , I quite forgot , ’ said <NAME> .
Oh , what a dull dog of a pawnbroker !
‘ It is most demnebly particular , ’ said <NAME> .
Let her find it out for herself .
'My amiable friend , ' said I , ' I never have any money .
He stood up sometimes , and asked me what I thought of the prospect .
Yes , but we do n't know what reason there is in it .
To say ‘ How do you do , <NAME> ?
When you go to <NAME> , do as <NAME> does .
<NAME> <NAME> rolled it up again , and gave it me back .
No flattery in him , <NAME> .
And now I have found that -- oh , my goodness !
Your sister <NAME> would have told me what she thought of anyone , directly .
And he ever cared for her , she ’ d tell me .
‘ I believe you , ’ added <NAME> , with a moral sigh .
You do n't belong to <NAME> . ''
‘ I believe you , my pet , ’ replied <NAME> .
The success of <NAME> 's ingenious speculation , exceeded even his most sanguine hopes .
‘ Clara ! ’ said <NAME> sternly .
He quite eludes the most vigorous comprehension , you know .
Did he suppose that he had terrified her into silence ?
I was not bought , body and soul .
`` I ca n't do anything hardly , except write .
`` Then we 'll face it out .
They knocked once , and they rang once , without any response .
cried <NAME> , patting it with his hand .
That her suitor is an old man ?
Her eyes occasionally filled with tears , but those she repressed .
Were at a considerable disadvantage . ''
For fifty pounds he had seen his mother that day .
You must not allow your father to take such a mad step .
said <NAME> ; ' I remember him , of course .
‘ Attend to me , ’ said <NAME> , bending forward a little .
said <NAME> with a delighted countenance .
‘ Only gone home to clean himself , ’ replied the friend .
Do I say he will ?
`` It matters little , '' she said , softly .
To proceed under the present circumstances is out of the question .
Little <NAME> coloured under such a gaze , and looked down .
You were betrayed into it by another .
These little ones are always right ! ''
`` Anywhere 's nowhere , '' said <NAME> , stopping perversely .
The conversation still turned on the receipt of rents .
She does not even know that I live here .
<NAME> was delighted with her success , and rose to take her leave .
How can I go home when everybody ’ s miserable to see me !
You know our league and covenant .
‘ I think highly of her. ’ ‘ I am so glad of that !
‘ If you please , I was born here , sir. ’ ‘ Oh !
He had been a sickly child .
There was plenty of room for us all .
‘ Yes , yes , directly , ’ replied <NAME> .
‘ He is an odd-looking man , ’ thought <NAME> .
<NAME> was busily engaged in preparing breakfast .
Whether it was a son who would some day avenge his father .
<NAME> was life at <NAME> ’ s .
'God be good to me ! '
For he has his pictures , ancient and modern .
It would afford me pleasure so to come .
‘ I am bad , I am lost .
‘ Now , I am complete , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ I think you ’ re right , ’ whispered <NAME> across the table .
On his face there was his own smile .
She was always with him .
I have explained that to him , and he understands it .
‘ So it is , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ It has done me harm , my friend .
whispers <NAME> , going up a step or two .
Do n't do it , <NAME> , on account of the children ! ''
‘ I wish you would , ’ said <NAME> .

Mrs. <NAME> closed the door , and <NAME> resumed his writing .
Now , take this paper that <NAME> has carried about him .
`` I do n't speak of advice , '' returns <NAME> .
`` And who told <NAME> as there was anybody here ? ''
`` I doubt if he expects much of the old world .
‘ Wot do you mean ? ’ said <NAME> .
W. I drink to you .
Yet so things come round .
‘ Have you made no remonstrance about it , <NAME> ?
The prevailing influence was too much even for his sister .
The lady , as we have already stated , was near the door .
said <NAME> with a light in his eyes .
The letter had fallen on the ground .
<NAME> on , my men , -- as quick as you like ! '
Every master in <NAME> has had a reference out of it .
‘ <NAME> ; and we may be so happy , ’ said the child .
I shall never learn , ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> let me keep it for father till he comes back !
Age or change should never wither it .
`` But what did you think upon the road ? ''
In half an hour ’ s time the entries were concluded .
‘ I don ’ t mean I ’ ll tell you that .
The little old lady 's hearing was remarkably quick .
<NAME> and brown paper , vinegar and brown paper , from morning to night .
‘ Past ten , ’ said <NAME> , consulting his watch .
I am not polite , I know .
She gave me her hand .
`` <NAME> was , '' says <NAME> .
‘ Why ? ’ ‘ Because I am a fortune-teller .

‘ It can ’ t be. ’ But there it was .
‘ I am uneasy about Harriet. ’ ‘ Harriet who ?
`` <NAME> is his disinterested friend , '' I answered .
I am a disappointed drudge , sir .
It was couched in the following terms : ‘ <NAME> .
Was that like his having really done so ?
`` A dreary name , '' said the <NAME> .
‘ Mister Muntlehiney , ’ said the man .
It was perfectly natural that in looking for one , he should look high .
said my guardian to us two .
Did you say papers too , sir ?
‘ All this past summer , you have been withholding something from me .
He was waiting for me with great impatience .
It ’ s a bad job ; that ’ s what it is .
Come here , <NAME> , and I 'll kiss yer . '
he cries like the hobgoblin in the story .
But <NAME> soon settled the account .
It was a song that always made him cry , he told us .
<NAME> <NAME> was reserved until the last .
'Good-bye , boy , ' said the man .
And still , not a word of the robbery .
Mrs. Micawber will attest it .
<NAME> <NAME> uttered a groan .
`` I AM rich , '' she returns .
I intend to continue stating that , sir .
An astonishing number of men always _are _getting disappointed there .
I slept at night near the door of the house .
'Why have they taken it away ? '
This gentleman likewise knows me , and his name is <NAME> .
The schoolmaster had already told her story .
‘ Oh , certainly. ’ By this time they had reached the road .
‘ If you do such things by accident , you should be more careful .
You relate everything to me , Mr .
This I had never thought of .
Gradually , I became used to seeing the gentleman with the black whiskers .
‘ Very much obliged to him , I ’ m sure .
Send him out with the <NAME> and <NAME> ?
Other changes had come to pass too .
`` <NAME> takes certain interests under certain wills disputed in the suit .
‘ Who could entreat a child to desert her parent ?
The old girl 's weight -- is twelve stone six .
`` He has got your name , <NAME> , in his hat ! ''
You had better take a lot of forms away with you .
‘ I believe you ! ’ said <NAME> .
She spoke of nothing but him , thought of nothing but him .
“ Dear Miss Havisham , ” said <NAME> .
When I was his pardner , I couldn ’ t never give him satisfaction .
Changed as it was , he knew it well .
He was all but killed , ma'am , when I come in . '
‘ But perhaps you will let me , instead , say something to you .
'Speak to her kindly , ' said the young lady to her companion .
'Send Mrs. Bedwin here , if you please . '
`` Man of the worldly mind ! ''
The room was destitute of carpet or of curtain .
‘ I would rather not , Mr Boffin , unless you particularly wish it .
I really can not express how uneasy this made me .
Another instant and the house would be alarmed .
And what did it matter whether she was cross or not ?
<NAME> has not made me idiotic , <NAME> .
Do I show it so plainly ?
But he never come nigh himself .
He resented Mrs. Cruncher 's saying grace with particular animosity .
You go and get ready .
I performed the burial service over her remains .
says <NAME> with a nod .
‘ Oh yes , ’ returned her friend .
Not to be tedious , they had many other beliefs of a similar kind .
But on that same evening , I felt that I was stricken cold .
‘ Fire away. ’ <NAME> advanced , and levelled his gun .
They have come to have a peep at <NAME> .
Another , as he picks his way along !
‘ I have made up my mind that I must have money , <NAME> .
<NAME> , and fear , and shame .
‘ His name ’ s <NAME> , ’ said the <NAME> .
'Oh , it 's sickening , ' replied the beadle .
You are gone away for my sake , I am sure !
I am amazed. ’ ‘ I was tired , father .
And yet the world is full of such heroism .
Mrs. <NAME> , you embellish the rooms .
Am I to kiss you now ?
‘ We must talk about this .
It ’ s like a limited game of cricket .
‘ This is a unpleasant bisness .
The same defiant , scornful woman still .
‘ I didn ’ t quite mean that , my dear .
'You know the fact , and that 's enough for me . '
You know you knew what I meant , <NAME> .
‘ He certainly has , ’ added <NAME> .
It was tolling for the funeral service .

‘ But I never thought so , before .
The man went out with a lantern .
`` She does not expect a judgment ?
<NAME> those two pair out here for a crown a man .
‘ Going outside ? ’ said the red-haired man .
‘ I did what I hope was right .
‘ Let the servants know that no further steps are necessary .
By these means a friendship sprung up between them .
`` That is my desire , mademoiselle .
“ You have it. ” “ I have not , ” said <NAME> .
They did not creep far , before they stopped and stood upright .
“ I have delivered that letter , ” said <NAME> to <NAME> .
A <NAME> of the <NAME> XXXV .
‘ A dozen year , ’ he told her .
‘ Won ’ t it go ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
THE <NAME> party wanted assistance in cutting the throats of the Graces .
“ Ha , ha ! ” she laughed , “ you poor wretch !
‘ Well , and what a thing that is , ’ returned <NAME> .
They had books and papers in their hands , and bowed to him .
<NAME> has it come to this , indeed !
To these scanty means of improvement , she added another of her own contriving .
But I can ’ t get on with less believing .
‘ That ’ s him , ’ whispered <NAME> , greatly excited .
<NAME> <NAME> will do his best , the whole family will do their best .
I am young and active , and could be useful in many ways .
'Hoist him up ; I 'll catch hold of him . '
It is a mere question of figures , a case of simple arithmetic .
There was a stifling smell of hot oil everywhere .
See her dear Papa indeed !
‘ How can you ask me anything so foolish ? ’ pouted <NAME> .
'We must let him in , ' he said , taking up the candle .
Just throw out half a crown if you have got one to spare .
<NAME> , do n't lag behind already , Lazy-legs ! '
‘ Her ring , ’ he went on .
I only wish Mrs. Squeers could catch hold of him .
They were a long , long time alone .
My dear boy , I can ’ t speak .
No one can answer for him .
Shall I read it ? ’ ‘ If you please , ’ replied <NAME> .
`` Her manner was strange , '' said I .
On the road I have suffered a great deal .
‘ What now ? ’ she said with displeasure .
'That was the fever , my dear , ' said the old lady mildly .
That ’ s the way of it .
God bless that stewardess for her piously fraudulent account of January voyages !
Thus , you were to hammer boys round -- Old Clem !
Besides -- excuse me -- I do n't know that . ''
It is a melancholy truth that even great men have their poor relations .
<NAME> knew this , not even <NAME> .
Bad indeed , ’ replied Mr Vuffin , contemplating the fire with a sigh .
I lost forty-seven pound ten by being honest this morning .
‘ Of course there isn ’ t , ’ said <NAME> .
When shall Ada come to see you , my love ? ''
She has such a strong attachment to you and reliance on you .
‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , smacking his lips .
‘ I suppose not. ’ ‘ _I_ suppose not , ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> looked at <NAME> , and shook her head gravely .
‘ It does not take long .
We were married within a fortnight .
‘ I believe I am ! ’ said <NAME> , sarcastically .
<NAME> and its Factory System 52 Worcester .
demands <NAME> in some considerable doubt .
‘ I can ’ t allow things to go on in this way .
quite away ? ’ ‘ Yes , ’ returned Mrs. Nickleby , ‘ certainly .
Now let 's see you eat 'em . ''
<NAME> , help me in , and fill me a small glass of brandy .
To this the captain also assented .
<NAME> likes me less than he used to .
Whether they pay , or whether they don ’ t pay .
`` I am the <NAME> of <NAME> , '' said the <NAME> .
and such sympathy as was shown by the single ones !
There 's no east in it .
‘ Nothing whatever , ’ replied <NAME> .
I look at my mother , but she pretends not to see me .
He sadly and sorely missed <NAME> .
'Why did n't you come here before ? '
I am happy to say it is advancing .
That is just the mistake .
Let him look to it ; let him look to it !
No one should come between us .
Let us , in a spirit of love , inquire . ''
<NAME> gold , that might have saved her life ! '
'After I am dead , but not before .
He leaves him for <NAME> at any rate , and hopes she is better .
did you say ? ’ asked the client in an altered tone .
always joined in the same report .
They had newly agreed to set up a joint establishment together .
‘ Perhaps he might , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Nothing to fear ! ’ returned the old man .
But for that appointment there would have been no discovery .
He was altogether splendid , massive , overpowering , and impracticable .
<NAME> controverted the prophetic gentleman 's opinion .
‘ Your face is like a ghost ’ s , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Is this Cloisterham ? ’ demanded the passenger , in a tremendous voice .
Nor were these the only uninvited clients whom the advertisement produced .
<NAME> <NAME> -- that was the prevalent idea .
‘ Here she comes , Mr Headstone !
<NAME> uttered a scream , and hid her face in her apron .
‘ No , ’ replied <NAME> , dropping on his knees .
I would not vex my darling , for the wide world ’ s riches .
These young men will respect you , when they would listen to nobody else .
I began to think I would put it off till tomorrow .
<NAME> , my dear ma ’ am , <NAME> is her devoted slave .
<NAME> deep , and spare not .
There were two buyers directly , and more of the listeners plainly hesitated .
`` That 's what it means , my dear friend .
'Come , let go o ' me , will you ! '
`` How changed it must be now ! ''
He gently patted me on the head , and I sat down .
He found favour in the eyes of <NAME> .
It was a question of feeling .
‘ I should scarcely think so , either , ’ rejoined her mother .
However , go to <NAME> 's I must , and go I did .
He foresaw where they were going as soon as their feet touched the staircase .
‘ Not ready for more ham yet , <NAME> ?
Be equally good-tempered to me , old boy !
He is not a schoolmaster now , <NAME> .
‘ -- We must not lose sight of you .
A strong card -- a certain Guillotine card !
says <NAME> , coming up .
`` This is a bitter wind ! ''
'Nobody suspected them , in this case , ' said Mrs. Maylie .
I don ’ t agree with him , you know .
he said , looking down at her with some curiosity .
There was no concealed or half-expressed meaning in his face .
But you always were strange .
You see the door there .
‘ Is there anybody hardy enough to disbelieve it ?
I have told you , dear , that I have had bad dreams .
In fact , they all have .
Would he ever marry again ?
Let me say one prayer .
‘ Certainly not , ’ replied <NAME> eagerly ; ‘ not on any account .
<NAME> nodded in return to thank him , and hurried out of the room .
`` Do you think my cousin <NAME> knows , dear Dame Durden ? ''
‘ I won ’ t press that just now .
`` Just so , '' assented <NAME> again .
A Letter from <NAME> Dorrit 5 .
I ’ ve looked in upon you , and empire resumes her sway .
She shows the house already , very pretty .
<NAME> can it come , whither can it go ?
Mr <NAME> took up his hat and buttoned his coat , and walked out .
A venerable building -- grey , even in the midst of the hoary landscape .
But why do I ask ?
'You must do more than that , ' said <NAME> .
You ease my mind so much .
‘ I shall try for a berth in some ship or other .
But , of course I do know .
‘ I can ’ t imagine why. ’ ‘ I will tell you .
<NAME> smiled , and moved towards the door .
‘ But I doubt if he is .
<NAME> reports that he is at present shut up in the library alone .
<NAME> had taken <NAME> on a journey to <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> , ’ said Mr Plornish , addressing the old gentleman .
Mrs. <NAME> appeared to understand the reference better than I did at the time .
He 'd have their lives , and the lives of scores of 'em .
And so was that one ’ s .
‘ I love you , love you , love you !
I can put it by .
You were to be exactly what you were before .
I shall be sure to be somewhere. ’ ( It did seem likely . )
It makes the world of five miles round quite merry .
The court-yard received them at last , and there he said goodbye to <NAME> .
You have done well , <NAME> .
You have called me an adventurer , <NAME> .
The case of this unhappy man might be my own .
`` Is that <NAME> 's waggon ? ''
The <NAME> clutches the aggressive hands , resists , gasps , and protests .
Be assured that he does not ! ''
‘ Devil a bit , <NAME> ’ am , ’ said the Major .
‘ But I have some experience of <NAME> , <NAME> .
‘ I have seen him , ’ replied the middle-aged lady .
says <NAME> , pausing , with his finger at his ear .
I was a captive and a slave .
All in the <NAME> , eh !
‘ I should think so , ’ chuckled Mr Toots .
`` How I envy you your constitution , <NAME> ! ''
‘ Indeed , indeed , this is my fault solely .
‘ You ’ ll mention that I called , perhaps ? ’ said <NAME> .
‘ No , but listen to me , ’ said the young man .
Not an ambitious note , but still he sings . ''
The <NAME> of Mrs <NAME> thicken 11 .
‘ Yes , sir , ’ said <NAME> , following his glance .
‘ I didn ’ t know it indeed .
They will say , “ She had a blessing .
‘ Are you a Quaker ? ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> , months , seasons , pass along .
‘ It ’ s not far , ’ said the man .
Both in face and figure , she is quite uncommon .
'Often , ' answered the first woman .
All that she dreams comes true .
I know what I know ! ’ chuckled the mother .
‘ All of ‘ em , <NAME> ’ am ? ’ said <NAME> .
And I give him up to you , and I want him took .
O glorious to be a human boy !
`` She has no need of it , '' said he .
He 's just the boy for you .
When had <NAME> seen her look like this ?
Her own delight was no set-off to this .
‘ Yes , for debt , <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> .
‘ You always believe , ’ returned her father , petulantly .
‘ Why , that ’ s right ! ’ cried Quilp .
He was in a Decline , and was a shadow to look at .
It was a lucky suit too , this bottle-green .
I believe I have been very much to blame .
<NAME> is my out-of-luck ways , you see !
‘ It went the half hour as I came through the Polygon .
‘ You ’ ll take me in ? ’ said the benevolent old clergyman .
A man who was the <NAME> of humility .
`` Has he decided to do so ? ''
This reminds me , godmother , to ask you a serious question .
In the yard , were the <NAME> and turnkeys .
'It beats anything I could have believed , ' observed the matron emphatically .
The dead and buried lady was awful in a picture-frame of ghastly bandages .
'Appears against the boy , does he ? '
There is no doubt whatever about that .
`` And how do you find yourself , my poor lad ? ''
‘ It isn ’ t a dream ! ’ said <NAME> .
You know what they say of my lodger ? ''
<NAME> , the man must never be pursued .
<NAME> when he see the ghost .
I wo n't have 'em disappear so quietly .
As to <NAME> , we know what <NAME> is .
I do n't know whether to me or to my companion .
I do n't know what it was .
There are no dreams here .
‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ he ’ s the next .
Its rapid little pulse beat twelve : and stopped .
Bless you for a dear old lady .
The chateau was left to itself to flame and burn .
Oh she looked very pretty , she looked very , very pretty !
`` <NAME> , '' says that old girl , `` I wonder at you !
They live at the <NAME> .
Mr Toots merely requires that it should be mentioned mysteriously , and with feeling .
‘ But now I mean to do it , ’ returned the Doctor .
For I know how he has altered , in his devotion to me .
Her name is <NAME> now , <NAME> .
ha ! -- to disown <NAME> , I present myself here tonight .
I may have a conviction that <NAME> ’ s manners -- ’ ‘ Hem !
The mistress not being enough to deal with , here 's the maid now !
I suppose they are mine .
Rather a bad look-out for me ! ''
They would have treated him better , if they had known it all ! '
There it stands , to remind me that he died .
'He knows the alternative , ' said <NAME> .
said <NAME> , when he had recovered himself , and <NAME> had returned .
The canker is in the flower .
<NAME> ’ t tell _us_ you wouldn ’ t paper it .
‘ Her mother let down two tucks in her frocks only last week .
The key was in it .
Mr <NAME> took it up and began to rub his nose with it .
What sight was that which met her view !
He clasped her in his arms , and none of us spoke .
She _will_ do as she likes .
inquired <NAME> , with a preliminary sob .
<NAME> ’ s wife plays cribbage ; all-fours likewise .
Perhaps he seemed as old in her eyes as she seemed young in his .
I was not sorry to go .
I—I want to speak to you , my dear .
<NAME> <NAME> shook his head in the most emphatic manner .
The laced coat , and the cocked hat ; where were they ?
“ What 's in the bottle , boy ? ” said he .
<NAME> signs too , but unapplauded , for her hand shakes .
It will be too late very soon . ''
‘ No , <NAME> , ’ he resumed .
‘ Stand by ! ’ returned the <NAME> , thoughtfully .
He was restless to-night , and seemed dispirited .
I believe , with all my soul , that we shall see the triumph .
We want more painstaking and search-making into this murder .
Is he a good doctor , my love ? ''
The figure like myself was assailed , and my valise was in its hand .
‘ Two L ’ s , old feller , ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> , <NAME> coming out of the house !
How can I know without seeing them , when he do n't know himself ?
At that moment the knocking ceased .
<NAME> approving , Mr <NAME> was satisfied .
That both your debts are paid in the one great debt of nature .
‘ No , no , curse it , ’ said <NAME> .
It was his school , and he intended it to be a model .
The men were occupied directly .
‘ You can ’ t be a gallivanting dodger , ’ said <NAME> .
No , they said there was not .
‘ I , ’ replied <NAME> mildly .
We are not in a flourishing state of circumstances here , sir .
I shall not weary you with good advice .
Where does he come from ?
How odd things come about , now !
I will go and see him this morning .
'Nor catching any thieves , nor identifying any house-breakers ? '
I seem to be there , by permission of somebody else .
‘ I do not reproach you , father , I make no complaint .
To whom he returned , whistling .
Dead men never repent ; dead men never bring awkward stories to light .
Yes ? ’ said Mr Merdle , turning towards her .
The gleam of lights increased ; the footsteps came more thickly and noisily on .
It is the point of view that is the essential thing .
I feel that I am never safe from him .
Will you have the goodness to stop a moment ?
At last , up comes father and takes us home .
The house was dark , dismantled : and the all appearance , uninhabited .
You want him made a thief .
If they were ever to get away unseen , that was the very moment .
‘ What ’ s that ? ’ said <NAME> , softly .
This is very like me before I was set up .
You may , perhaps , have abandoned this project a long time .
‘ Is she ? ’ said <NAME> .
Bless the dear children for his sake , anyhow !
‘ Are you dumb ? ’ said the old woman , angrily .
“ <NAME> ’ t do that , my boy , ” said the father .
`` He 's just as dead as <NAME> ! ''
`` Not at all , my dear , '' says <NAME> .
You know what I told you of the attraction on the <NAME> 's table ?
He has been very silent and doleful of late .
<NAME> rushes in , and finds his mother clinging round his neck .
-- and at last it was settled that his application should be granted .
You shall go out oftener .
'_Real ones_ , ' rejoined the girl .
Again and again it rose and fell , like the waves of ocean .
This is not a professional attendance .
After each of these interrogatories , she has inclined her head .
Because I am not poor .
I ’ ve never slept out of the back-attic one single night .
`` How do you know he was there ? ''
But I can not shake it off .
“ Good ! ” said <NAME> conceitedly .
‘ How shall I tell <NAME> ? ’ said <NAME> , ruminating .
`` Next term , <NAME> , will be next month , '' said <NAME> .
‘ Well , and do you see THIS ? ’ bawled Squeers .
There will be time to find some better place for him in the meanwhile .
`` Surely , none in the world , child . ''
They would not know me .
Got a beard besides , and presumes upon it .
Mr <NAME> did the like with <NAME> .
What a quantity ! ’ ‘ Call THAT a quantity ? ’ returned <NAME> .
If he don ’ t like that , let him get one for himself .
‘ “ Middlesex , <NAME> , <NAME> , v. <NAME> PICKWICK .
<NAME> looked round , and smiled involuntarily .
Chaotic combinations of furniture also take place .
At any rate , he counted out the change , and gave it her .
He understood the state of things at a glance , and he understood me .
‘ Thank you , <NAME> , thank you .
I won ’ t , I won ’ t , I won ’ t !
They turned a corner , and met Mr Lightwood .
‘ Why I think it is , my dear , ’ said <NAME> .
But , however , here 's five shillings for you .
I am thankful ! ” said <NAME> .
There was a fiction that <NAME> “ examined ” the scholars once a quarter .
Let me see you play cards with this boy. ” “ With this boy ?
'What name am I to say ? '
It ’ s a joke of mine .
He was out of temper ; and he looked up with an angry scowl .
His hand was cold , and loose , and scarcely closed upon her .
“ <NAME> , and not do it ?
Give him an inch , and he ’ ll take an ell .
‘ Nothing has been left undone , my dear sir -- nothing whatever .
‘ Will it come back to me ?
‘ Yes , my dear ; but of our own accord .
<NAME> , dogs , and drink had brought him there , pell-mell .
In fine , your admirable mother vexed me .
' I should like -- ' faltered the child .
This is not all the wonderful good-fortune , my dear Little Dorrit .
He is not to blame .
And nothing can be won without anxiety and care -- nothing .
`` I waited to be told . ''
‘ He is still there ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , ’ said Mr Inspector .
‘ The chair remained motionless , and spoke not a word .
‘ What ’ s this ? ’ asked <NAME> , taking up the key .
‘ Then , <NAME> , you wrong him very much .
‘ I can read ’ em off , like books .
‘ But breakfast is waiting , <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> quietly sits down to write .
‘ Quite ready , ’ returned the father .
This game was constantly playing .
As she stooped over him , her tears fell upon his forehead .
You have been among them . ''
I was very meek and umble -- and I am .
‘ Lord bless you , I know that .
‘ What ’ s the matter now ? ’ said <NAME> , looking up .
`` I give it , '' was the reply .
<NAME> <NAME> had risen when <NAME> demonstrated , and had backed near the door .
( I was the creditor who had issued the writ .
It is eight o'clock now , and the day is fast drawing in .
“ Not all of one kind , ” resumed <NAME> .
‘ Perhaps so , <NAME> , ’ he replied .
‘ <NAME> much so , <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> .
Yes , ” was the grim reply of <NAME> .
We all lived together and were educated together .
‘ That I don ’ t know , ’ returned her son .
I understand these subjects much better than you do .
‘ Or even one before her , ’ said the bachelor .
“ So you were never in <NAME> before ? ” said <NAME> to me .
‘ Think of that now ! ’ said <NAME> .
You will only die with me .
He is the most peculiar man I ever saw .
Once , among the heterogeneous crowd of inmates there appeared a dancing-master .
‘ What HAS come , then ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
‘ Remorse and misery , ’ replied the stranger .
We entreated Mrs. Badger not to mention it .
To the Devil with your produced !
He was beset in his house by an enemy , named <NAME> .
‘ Ah Jenny , is it you ?
Now to the point , '' addressing me .
They see my <NAME> 's face .
‘ Did I ever tempt you to seek my hand ?
`` And that was like me ! ''
“ I do n't hear you , ” said <NAME> .
I got out of it .
She disappears , leaving me alone with <NAME> .
<NAME> , but not an <NAME> woman .
You shall win , however the game goes .
‘ ’ Tis true , and you shall find it so .
You went partners in the mischief , and I hope you like it .
‘ Yes , my dear , ’ replied <NAME> , filling a fresh pipe .
‘ It ’ s always the same , <NAME> ; nobody can decide .
‘ Throw some cold water over her , ’ said the old gentleman .
`` Of other and very different things I come to speak to you .
He was otherwise quite self-possessed , bowed to the Judge , and stood quiet .
There are diamonds glittering on the hand that holds the screen .
By <NAME> , he is a man to fear !
We drive away together , and I awake from the dream .
He did n't drop out of the clouds , did he , master ? '
‘ You are not the godmother at all ! ’ said she .
‘ Missed your letter , sir ! ’ bawled <NAME> .
“ Do n't you know ? ” said <NAME> .
The kennel was stagnant and filthy .
`` He might have done worse , '' I heard my guardian soliloquize .
repeats <NAME> , walking him on again .
And now I will ask you a question in return .
That I am , in my poor way , a gentleman , by <NAME> !
Her papa was with her -- and <NAME> .
The eldest Miss <NAME> knows officers .
‘ I almost feared you thought otherwise , ’ returned the schoolmaster .
“ You do not find it easy to advise me ? ” said <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> up in front , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
How ’ s your very clever and agreeable wife ?
On this present birthday , <NAME> has accomplished the usual preliminaries .
'Nothing , my dear , nothing , ' said <NAME> .
‘ Is that all ? ’ repeated my aunt .
‘ You never tasted this , ’ said <NAME> .
What am I to do , I ask you ?
`` It had better declare us poor at once , '' said <NAME> .
And yet , be it observed , he disappeared before that gentleman appeared .
‘ In which I sat to-day !
And his poor sister too , ’ said <NAME> .
He was very little changed .
<NAME> dull , I 'm blessed if I a n't ! '
‘ I never , never , never was so glad !
Your lodgings , <NAME> , ’ returned the old man .
What account does he give of himself ?
<NAME> lived in Bleeding Heart Yard .
There was no harm in it though he did say son .
`` Ah , my God , you are an unhappy idiot ! ''
See now how deep that is ! ’ exclaimed old Arthur .
Indeed , he married her for love .
But they shall not move me .
<NAME> loses interest and undergoes reaction .
It is not likely ever to recover its tone .
Surely an unaccountable sort of expedition , therefore !
Mr Carker didn ’ t deny it .
Say the ten shillings , and we ’ ll close the bargain .
Good-bye ! ’ ‘ God bless you , dear !
I am a ruined man .
‘ And what are you thinking about me ? ’ asked <NAME> .
‘ Something has gone amiss with him to-day .
‘ Any room will do , ’ said the single gentleman .
‘ Hope I see you well sir , ’ returned that gentleman .
There is my peace ; there is my despair .
He asked where the suppositious party was ?
‘ Instantly , sir , ’ said the lady .
exclaimed the absent old gentleman , innocently .
But , the measure of his degradation was not yet full .
He ’ s more welcome to go than to stay .
Why , gentlemen , who _does _trouble himself about a warming-pan ?
`` You have been strangely importunate .
<NAME> said that he would see him -- yes , indeed he did .
I saw <NAME> balance his knife .
As to sparing the girl , of what importance or value is she ?
On the second story you will find <NAME> 's apartments .
‘ <NAME> ’ t talk about happiness till you see <NAME> .
<NAME> before me , of course .
The convict drew closer to him .
'You did well yesterday , my dear , ' said <NAME> .
Coming in for Pocket-Breaches. ’ Man says , ‘ Ah !
Was it breakfast , lunch , dinner , tea , or supper ?
Oh load of love and trustfulness that lies to lightly there !
She 's an apt scholar and will do well .
How adwersity does change people ! ’ said the lady , looking upwards .
Affectionately , He rang the bell .
I don ’ t want you to do so .
But my present purpose is not to expatiate upon my walks .
'Take the boy back to the workhouse , and treat him kindly .
But she never thought of the house .
Nor was Mrs. Weller behind-hand in doing justice to the composition .
Now , <NAME> , never you stir from that fire till I come back !
<NAME> comfort to me , <NAME> ! ''
I felt called upon to propose an individual .
`` This is strong language , <NAME> , '' returns <NAME> .
There 's such a goose , <NAME> ! ''
I gave it as my opinion .
said <NAME> , mastering the emotions by which she was agitated .
The <NAME> , and a Glimpse of the <NAME> .
‘ Quite near enough , ’ said <NAME> , rousing herself .
You must be followed up , you know .
Yer never get time enough over yer meals . '
<NAME> ’ t be hurt by my words .
So it was when he first saw it .
Some other novelty will spring up one day , and you will be released .
The tree is struck , but not down .
‘ Not woman yet ? ’ said <NAME> , with a smile .
You are associated with my position and my reputation .
<NAME> <NAME> never set her cap at <NAME> when he was a bachelor .
`` It was a troubled dream ? ''
It was of no use .
She had told me that she knew <NAME> was ‘ too clever ’ .
'Is n't that boy no better ? '
Yet his mind was not relieved of <NAME> .
<NAME> , <NAME> and Prism 8 .
There was no sound within : so she coughed and listened again .
`` Precisely the same , '' said <NAME> .
Her glance at parting showed _that_ .
'Bill , dear <NAME> , you can not have the heart to kill me .
Very remarkably , neither <NAME> nor <NAME> looked at all at the boy .
<NAME> , but you look charming !
I did so , as I thought .
The lamps across his streets had a portentously elastic swing with them .
‘ May I go on ? ’ said <NAME> , mildly .
But men ARE so different at different times !
It has now this new unfortunate association connected with it .
<NAME> n't I take the liberty ?
We must pay a visit to <NAME> and caution him on these points .
So glad to know you .
‘ This is hard to see and hear .
<NAME> wants you here , ' he ses .
I must keep her near me .
<NAME> , who had quite forgotten the subject , looked up surprised .
‘ I hope you may be happy , <NAME> .
But I couldn ’ t manage it .
'But what do you want with me ? '
exclaims the young man , rising from his chair and walking about the room .
`` A quarter of a minute , miss !
‘ I should think so , ’ replied <NAME> , with a patronising wink .
said <NAME> , shaking her head .
<NAME> , see the party safely there . ''
And that stumbling-block he never got over .
A dirtier or more wretched place he had never seen .
‘ Is it a large school , aunt ? ’ I asked .
It would be idle to expect that they should have .
Lay me down , lay me down .
Be careful how you cross , <NAME> .
<NAME> Leicester could desire to know by whom , and what for .
How curious you are , <NAME> !
He wants to ask a question .
I did not expect to see this in you .
And off _her_ head comes !
‘ Oh dear no ! ’ returned <NAME> , shaking her head .
`` Do n't be alarmed , miss , '' he returned .
Oh , pray send them back ; send him back the books and money .
A shrill noise quivered through the trees .
‘ <NAME> is my sweetest friend ! ’ exclaimed <NAME> , with open arms .
At midday , the roll of drums .
‘ This is but a flying visit .
<NAME> <NAME> picks up his hat and rises .
“ This lasted twenty-six hours from the time when I first saw her .
‘ You are penitent ? ’ ‘ No , ’ she answered .
Your father will be free within a few hours .
Plainly dressed , very quiet , very pretty .
‘ I speak to <NAME> ? ’ she said , when they were alone .
There must be something short-sighted in the eternal arrangements , surely !
‘ Now <NAME> , run ‘ em out .
Beat it out , beat it out -- Old Clem !
You never saw such a good house , <NAME> .
But they were as serviceable as they were precious to <NAME> .
The Court objects for two reasons .
'We 'll cure you of that , my young master . '
‘ The damage and waste question shall be settled first .
`` I think we may have done with the growlery for one day !
An unhappy culprit , found guilty of imperfect exercise , approaches at his command .
In manner , close and dry .
<NAME> looked older , but he had had a hard life .
“ He must take his chance , ” said <NAME> .
If I were dead , that could not be surer than it is henceforth .
‘ <NAME> ’ t trouble <NAME> about an old creetur like me .
He always was a infernal cheat , was <NAME> .
It is never too late to repent .
You repaired to the place of his birth .
Sam having stationed himself on the box , it rolled away .
He 's not safe , you know .
<NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ is known to <NAME> .
said Mrs. Woodcourt , pressing my hand .
‘ I am a gentleman , I am , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ I can not , will not leave you thus , ’ returned <NAME> .
I may in a minute .
The sooner you understand that , <NAME> , and admit that , the better .
my dear sir , ’ snapping his fingers .
I never stopped for a word .
Everything about the <NAME> was spick and span new .
To be sure we did .
If it had been my eyes , what should I have done ?
<NAME> , show <NAME> to bed . '
he said from his corner .
<NAME> <NAME> is ingenuity itself. ’ ‘ My dear <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
It was a large long room with some large maps in it .
' A very good-looking boy , that , my dear . '
No ! ’ says <NAME> , with some dissatisfaction .
‘ It ’ s oncommon kind , ’ said <NAME> .
But <NAME> can not read tonight .
It will not scratch and claw , but pet and comfort ?
His manner was uneasy and astonished , and showed a sense of humiliation .
<NAME> <NAME> started back at sight of it .
The dog wagged his tail , but moved not .
I have done with it .
‘ You ’ re a character , sir , ’ said <NAME> .
`` Only round the corner , '' said <NAME> .
But it is so very strange !
‘ You know he has bought me , ’ she resumed .
'Hours ago , ' replied the <NAME> , throwing open a door .
<NAME> ! ’ she answered , I could not conceive why .
They are not at an end , sir .
said <NAME> , laughing , with her pretty face on fire .
‘ Why , bless me , so it is !
One , two , three , and there you are !
‘ I beg your pardon , <NAME> , ’ said Mr Feeder , reddening .
The wonder is , that it isn ’ t much worse !
never more refreshed in spirits .
‘ You know what I mean , and you trifle with my impatience .
Here is this boy which you brought up by hand .
It was a green spot , on a hill , carpeted with soft turf .
“ I do it because it 's politic ; I do it on principle .
Then , what do we find ?
I ask your pardon for having done you an injury .
He stood bare-headed in the road , watching her quick disappearance .
said the old man , coming to the door .
‘ Because I was in the humour .
‘ <NAME> , sir , ’ replied the testy little judge .
If we bought a lobster , it was full of water .
This was all the information <NAME> could obtain about the picture at that time .
I need not tell you to be punctual .
<NAME> is a beautiful city ; cheerful , thriving , and animated .
‘ Will you allow me to detain you one moment ? ’ said he .
But nothing unexpected , ’ he replied .
‘ Did you hear him say that he was resolved to disappoint us ?
<NAME> <NAME> was called to confirm it , and did so .
My mother is likewise a very umble person .
‘ Really I am not aware that there is , in particular .
Besides which , he quite scented the dining-room with bear's-grease and other perfumery .
I think I heard him say , ‘ my gardener ’ , several times .
Cries in exaltation of the well-known good physician rent the hall .
He shall hear from me , <NAME> .
You like it so , I suppose ? '
‘ To be sure you must .
A very little more and it must have entered her skull .
“ The last time. ” He nodded .
‘ It must be some mistake , ’ said <NAME> , carelessly .
If my grief were selfish , I did not know it to be so .
He was lying on a sofa with his eyes closed when I went in .
What are you doing here ? '
<NAME> ’ t ask me , Mr Wrayburn .
‘ And so comic ! ’ Susan sobbed .
It was that as turned me .
I left him there resting himself a little .
It runs in the family . ''
As <NAME> greeted them , <NAME> tripped into the room .
‘ You drew her portrait perfectly , ’ said <NAME> .
`` Forgive me if I am wrong .
I won ’ t provoke my betters with knowledge , thank you .
We will not wring the public bosom , with the delineation of such suffering !
I have made up MY mind .
<NAME> , after drawing out the round table , withdrew to execute them .
It closed in an incident which I well remember .
No matter how unreasonable the terror , so that it be terror .
‘ That ’ s all , ’ said Mr Dombey , resuming his letters .
'Shut the door , ' whispered <NAME> from the end of the passage .
‘ It may be ; but I did not say so .
Come back , you young villain !
‘ He would be truly sorry !
But she lost it then , and wept over him .
His face was stern , and much flushed .
As she passed the school-house she could hear the busy hum of voices .
`` Let me try to make it more comfortable .
You 're afraid of our getting the better of you , are you ? '
Rub your eyes and look at me .
I believe it at last .
<NAME> <NAME> thinks that 's all .
Is there any other witness ?
How I wish we could be real friends !
I don ’ t want them , mama , indeed , ’ said <NAME> .
By <NAME> , they are at the top of the tree , though !
It all happened just as he related it .
‘ Perhaps you are a little hasty in your judgment , ’ he said .
Two to me , was it ?
I ’ ll get back to <NAME> then , and trouble no one .
' I 'm here , miss , ' replied <NAME> .
Do now , at last , dear godmother , if you please !
‘ We shall get on by degrees , I des-say .
My brother some time afterwards claimed his legacy .
‘ Is he mad ? ’ said <NAME> .
‘ You are right. ’ ‘ You are not offended , ’ said <NAME> .
The driver reiterated his former statement .
‘ Yes , I can though , ’ rejoined her father .
<NAME> <NAME> took him persuasively by the coat .
I tried to assure her that this was not so .
I shall be sorry if he don ’ t .
`` Strong enough to be told a secret , I think , <NAME> ? ''
That 's a card not to be beaten .
‘ Get off , I tell you .
<NAME> was drawing away from it .
'There , ' said <NAME> , smacking his lips .
You were exacting , proud , punctilious , selfish .
You ’ re a devilish amiable-looking fellow , <NAME> .
Jaggers is your guardian , I understand ? ” he went on .
'Did you mind me , dear ? '
They listened intently : a profound silence reigned throughout the house .
He listening , with his face turned away .
`` You will excuse my having mentioned my daughters , '' he said .
<NAME> by , my pretty one , stand by !
You have often carried my spare gun at <NAME> , <NAME> .
Where have I been brought to ? '
He sees no more of her .
This flood of tears left <NAME> no alternative .
Mr Veneering welcomes his dear Twemlow .
angrily pursued the poor half-witted dupe .
‘ But I am not to be got at in that way .
But I never own to it before her .
<NAME> ! ’ said the sister with the letter .
<NAME> attends with the key .
<NAME> <NAME> , any song but that !
I , who shower money upon it in this way ?
‘ What is it that you have to sell ? ’ said <NAME> .
I hope to preserve it .
I am going to the <NAME> . ''
`` He knows as much of the cause as the real salaried Chancellor ! ''
What was I to suppose , when I found myself molested by eight people ?
‘ The most unexceptionable references are given and required .
‘ You shall not be oppressed by the receipt of favours , <NAME> .
She often carried it in her hand , often refreshed herself with its fragrance .
Now , it will be too heavy and too long .
Very much , ’ said <NAME> , drily .
‘ Say what the hour is , ’ grumbled the first man .
To make variety in my position , and to amuse myself -- what !
There were no directions for him to give .
I have scarcely seen you since , you know .
His imperturbable face has been as inexpressive as his rusty clothes .
'Nothing good , ' said the Jew .
‘ Why not ? ’ said the chairman .
It may do her good. ’ ‘ And <NAME> .
My wish is that everything should be openly carried on .
You leave the more for me .
Although an infant barrister , he was a full-grown man .
'He shall be kept in the Stone Jug , <NAME> , like a gentleman .
‘ So bluff ! ’ cried <NAME> , ‘ wasn ’ t he ?
You want to know who 's got 'em .
That ’ s the word for it .
O my child , O my child ! ''
But that ’ s the way you cheat yourself .
'Nonsense , ' rejoined the girl coolly , 'Go on , <NAME> .
'Certainly not , ' replied the matron .
Let me tell you that , for your guidance .
I hope , for the sake of that poor lad , it may .
“ It is necessary to register him .
‘ To move a box , ’ I answered .
Bring it out. ’ ‘ Miss Potterson !
‘ A vistlin ’ shop , <NAME> , ’ interposed <NAME> .
You just pay us , d ’ ye hear ?
Instantly , he absconded , and came over here .
Then , she withdrew to the foot of the bed .
She consents to hear you speak for yourself .
'Home , lady , ' rejoined the girl .
He paused a little , biting his lip .
As yet , you are nothing more .
‘ Mr Headstone , what ’ s the matter ? ’ ‘ <NAME> ?
4 , and so on , until No .
Thus the sun found her on her bridal morning .
But how much better it was now that this had never happened !
<NAME> Twist being uppermost in his mind , he made him his theme .
Some has had daughters as was dead .
His time was nearly out .
Dead of course , my dear , '' said she .
<NAME> , take your hands off .
‘ The girl ’ s name ? ’ ‘ Oh deep , deep !
Several before your ladyship condescended to favour me with an answer . ''
But Mr Dombey -- <NAME> uttered a sudden cry .
Could a repetition of it be prevented ?
`` Tulkinghorn , I beg your pardon .
Really , my dear , ’ interposed <NAME> .
You have always adored her , ever since I have known you .
‘ Mr Headstone , let me go .
‘ But how was she found ?
‘ We thank you very much , but we can not stop so soon .
Perhaps the eldest Miss Larkins may be about thirty .
‘ Where was this child ’ s sister , <NAME> ?
I loathe and hate it now , but I can not leave it .
You can soon come up with him .
Once she saw tears in his eyes .
We then took leave of each other .
You have n't got anything on your mind , you know . ''
There they are , ” said <NAME> , “ coming out of the <NAME> .
says <NAME> , turning gloomily upon him .
It is of no moment .
If you want leave , ask for it. ’ Again the Secretary bowed .
'Bet will go ; wo n't you , my dear ? '
‘ There is little left to choose now .
Oh ! ’ groaned Mr Fledgeby , with his hand to his head again .
I did n't know the cause .
And oh , take her to <NAME> , and go away , please !
We left them to their system and themselves , and went home wondering .
‘ “ Are you ? ” inquired <NAME> .
I looked for <NAME> with unusual interest .
I have remembered Who wept for a parting between the living and the dead .
echoed the matron , bending eagerly over the woman as she fell back .
“ What are you about ? ” demanded <NAME> , with the utmost indignation .
‘ Ay , and <NAME> ? ’ added <NAME> .
Be as cool as you can , <NAME> .
He has suffered much , and is worse this morning .
It ’ s nobody ’ s minding that keeps sike men as thou afloat .
<NAME> let me put this wrapper of mine about you .
‘ Now you begin to look like yourself , ’ says the woman approvingly .
It was then about high-water , -- half-past eight .
Within a little while afterwards , <NAME> came down .
Which is she ? ” This is she .
‘ YOU think so , do you ? ’ retorted the father , angrily .
You do me the honour to ask me what to advise .
If I had been patient , I should never have called him names .
He took no notice of the baron , but was intently eyeing the fire .
‘ Asks me , as if he didn ’ t know his own purpose !
<NAME> boy , how do you do ? ’ I gave him my hand .
The sooner done the better .
I answered that it was a beautiful one .
'Nothing , sir , ' rejoined the girl , weeping .
`` You are so much better now , '' sald I .
It 's time you were on the lay .
‘ Poor , poor Eddy ! ’ thought <NAME> , as they went along .
How is <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Very well , ’ replied the old gentleman .
Not at all well , <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> , I think they will , ’ returned the dwarf .
How could I ? ’ He was very quick upon her with this retort .
‘ We came in a coach .
It is because you know how weak I am !
He was on his way to dig some one out of a grave .
<NAME> subjects , these , sir , very painful .
‘ Pretty well swelled out , an ’ t he ? ’ pursued <NAME> .
‘ I know your tricks and your manners , ’ cried <NAME> .
It haunted me when I got home .
You 're an independent dragoon , too !
He now interposes , addressing the young surgeon in his unmoved , professional way .
I ’ m going to have tea in my own apartment .
His arguments were brief but satisfactory .
“ To-night ? ” said the mender of roads .
He has not that positive interest in it which makes it his vocation .
Shall I put a coat over you ? ’ No answer .
Such a brute and a wretch as she must think me !
How should a repetition of it be treated ?
‘ Very good , sir , very good ! ’ cried <NAME> .
said I , in an agony , and grasping his hand .
That 's a great fault in this place .
These arms upon my neck for the last time !
‘ “ The room , ” replied the baron .
‘ <NAME> , send up <NAME> .
‘ How do you expect I can help it ?
says <NAME> , examining the wards of the key .
Is it , sir ? ’ asked Mr Boffin , turning to <NAME> .
`` Why is it so difficult , my dear ? ''
‘ So would I , ’ added the sporting one solemnly .
<NAME> Micawber then smiled , settled his chin again , and looked about him .
‘ Why , the <NAME> ’ s better than him .
‘ In the pound , ’ replied the mob .
‘ They ’ d make a difference in course , ’ said <NAME> doggedly .
<NAME> and all her family were full of grief at our going .
He gave up his hat , and held out his hand .
<NAME> <NAME> adored the <NAME> on account of his deportment .
They stopped at the summit of the stairs .
“ I communicate to him that secret .
Before the last clock begins to strike ten , there is a lull .
Does he show any turn for any musical instrument ? ''
‘ Shall I ask ? ’ he added quickly .
I must call him something .
The dog did as he was ordered .
‘ I want to get on , ’ observed <NAME> , hesitating .
‘ And will improve still more , ’ added Mrs. Nickleby .
<NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , looking up as he pursued his occupation .
And dying thus around us every day .
Besides , if they _are_ poor , you can ’ t help it .
only you and <NAME> -- when it is just ripe .
There was no light nonsense about <NAME> .
But most like you meant to it and forgot to it .
And <NAME> did not die .
<NAME> looks at him inquiringly .
I don ’ t pretend to know positively how a prisoner might feel .
‘ Pretty close ! ’ But he didn ’ t say _so_ .
Look at your linen ; fine and beautiful !
'None , ' replied the landlord of the <NAME> ; for it was he .
I am conscious of my own past follies .
Indeed ! ’ said my host , with much diminished interest .
<NAME> exchanged a look with <NAME> , and darted out .
I told him , “ You are a barbarian , sir. ” I did .
<NAME> , come in ! ’ She called <NAME> again .
But , all to-night , and last night too , it was the same .
<NAME> , your own <NAME> , your own old faithful Newman !
says the trooper , swallowing his fire .
‘ The loss has been ours , <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> , I confess , ’ replied <NAME> , wondering more and more .
Well , <NAME> ! ’ said I , giving her a kiss .
O Heavens , it had come at last !
‘ <NAME> ’ t tell me of it !
<NAME> like a pilgrim , with wallet and staff .
Says the coroner , is that boy here ?
“ The amiable old Proctor ” -- who ’ s he ?
This was prepared for her .
`` Dear , unfortunate , mistaken <NAME> , '' said I .
You to marry without dignity !
I could not have believed in such rage without seeing it .
‘ I ’ m glad of it , ’ said <NAME> .
It ’ s all imagination. ’ ‘ Traitor ! ’ thought the spinster aunt .
'Did he awake before you returned ? '
‘ Not -- eh , not bear ME ! ’ exclaimed <NAME> .
There is no Peggotty now , as in the old time .
The first impulse of the <NAME> was to run away .
I gave him my hand again .
With a clink for the stout -- Old Clem !
I had no idea that there was any selfish reference in my doing so .
Let ’ s be a comfortable couple , and take care of each other !
In short , we quite enjoyed ourselves .
she said `` Do n't talk to me , <NAME> .
`` It a n't indeed , '' replies the woman with a sigh .
I told her that I idolized and worshipped her .
Waiters never walk or run .
Can I spare this Doctor to my husband ?
<NAME> else has anything whatever to do with it .
`` I have now my instructions , '' he says .
This is your pay , on your discharge .
I was , a minute ago .
‘ But my education was completed long ago .
But come in , come in .
Never was such a dinner as that , since the world began .
‘ So I was , ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> detained her , and drew her to a seat beside him .
There was one young man sketching his face in a little note-book .
‘ To oblige me , you will , ’ resumed <NAME> .
Do you think I am though , eh ?
said <NAME> , gently nodding his head .
But it ’ s the heart that lowers me , it is the heart !
He lived in chambers which had once belonged to his deceased partner .
There is no patriot in <NAME> -- in <NAME> ?
Her husband smoked at his door , looking after her with admiration .
Where angels might have sat enthroned , devils lurked , and glared out menacing .
Again as large as life .
I mun go th ’ way as lays afore me .
‘ Very like that -- only more genteel , ’ replied <NAME> .
It might -- hum -- it might distress her .
She was not alone , she said .
‘ <NAME> old was <NAME> ? ’ asked the sexton .
‘ It is certainly very cold , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Now you are a scholar , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
Do n't speak of me to her .
It isn ’ t the waistcoat that I look at .
She bends over him , and speaks in his ear .
A Trifle of Management by Mr Carker the Manager 23 .
I might as well be twenty miles off .
Let her have <NAME> .
Get out of the way. ” “ Mithter Jaggerth !
But where was she to go ?
If he breathed , certainly he never spoke .
However , I have got over that mope .
<NAME> constrained himself , however , and replied that his master was extremely well .
What follows ? ” observed <NAME> .
<NAME> saw him look at it .
‘ To look at these heer flowers !
‘ This is a blessed relief , my dear , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Yes , ’ replied <NAME> , willing to soothe him .
He is struggling to come back .
<NAME> looked from one to the other in some surprise .
‘ We call it <NAME> , ’ said Mr Podsnap , with forbearance .
We ’ ve got the all-overs , haven ’ t us , deary ?
I Make Another Beginning <NAME> .
We shall soon find out .
She was the bosom friend of <NAME> .
I felt curious to know more concerning this person .
'He has gone , sir , ' replied Mrs. Bedwin .
It is not easy to walk alone in the country without musing upon something .
I went to his room , and he was not there .
“ Love her , love her , love her !
<NAME> boys , and beef-faced boys . '
‘ My darling girl , ’ said <NAME> as he embraced her .
`` Yes , <NAME> , please God , '' returns the stationer .
“ But you ca n't help groaning , my dear Handel .
But what could I do if I stayed !
Can I restore him to you ? ” “ Alas , no , <NAME> !
'Nothing , ' replied <NAME> , 'nothing to you .
We found out that , and saw it given you .
He made no allusion to these clothes , neither did I .
I reminded him , at the hopeful change he had made in <NAME> .
Would you take a seat , sir ? ''
I find it wery hard to hold that young man off of your inside .
`` Tolerable sober , my angel , '' returns <NAME> .
I said that I would die , and make no sign .
People have noticed it in the streets .
But it 's great good fortune , is it not ?
But upon my soul I drawed this here bundle out of a river !
What should she give it him for ? ''
‘ What ails that man ? ’ asks the foremost officer .
I think you and <NAME> had better take a walk . ''
‘ They are great scoundrels , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Why ? ’ inquired <NAME> , without looking up .
Well , I thought I could .
We arrived at his house on a Saturday .
Like <NAME> , your father , the gentleman was of <NAME> .
`` I do n't like this , <NAME> , '' he said thoughtfully .
‘ I haven ’ t seen you for -- oh !
Is that what you want ?
You can have a dozen if you like .
I had not once looked up .
`` Always the same dear girl ! ''
“ But there is another question , ” said <NAME> .
I released the leg of the table , and ran for my life .
I told you that before , ' rejoined the girl .
'Something that was taken from her , ' said <NAME> .
‘ You would not have seen them , ’ he returned .
On Florence inclining her head , he added , ‘ My name is <NAME> .
Well , that 'ud be imposing , too , on <NAME> 's .
The general belief was very slow .
Leaving old <NAME> behind us , Boys !
I read it every word -- every word .
`` Give me leave , sir , '' said <NAME> .
Some reddened at the sight of visitors , and some turned very pale .
I proclaim it to all here !
says <NAME> , and goes home to <NAME> and meditation .
She fixed her eyes upon the little teapot .
‘ What ’ s the matter ? ’ inquired Perker .
And ever the wind sawed , and the sawdust whirled .
Thus , he stole on to the gate of an inn-yard .
‘ This is the young gentleman whose teeth are to be filed !
'It 's no fault of yours , if I am not !
I was a boy here ! ''
She stands looking out at the same stars without a word .
‘ <NAME> as good as a hospital .
‘ <NAME> , my dear. ’ She took his hand .
You may well look tired of me .
These precautions well understood by both of us , I went home .
Oh , no ! ’ cried the child .
He feels that the world is looking at him out of their eyes .
As to escaping , what chances there were of escape ?
<NAME> <NAME> quickly looks to the other for his retort .
Right again , though a madman !
I said I supposed not ; and THAT was settled .
‘ What a shocking scene ! ’ said the spinster aunt .
Which is the case with so many of us !
The <NAME> sighed again , and resumed his pipe : as did <NAME> .
replied <NAME> in his vivacious way .
‘ You find it Very <NAME> ? ’ said Mr Podsnap , spaciously .
<NAME> ends this with a groan .
I have done so , and now my visit ’ s ended .
I always came to the conclusion , finally , that I could do nothing .
<NAME> walked sadly back to their lodgings in the <NAME> .
There are people enough in the world , <NAME> knows !
Such an entire revolution in my mode of life !
His mug is a fortin ' to him . '
‘ I am delighted to hear it , sir , ’ said <NAME> .
`` I have had great deal of trouble to find you , sir . ''
`` Not rings a bit like them .
`` I think he might -- I am afraid he would .
Here she was , in the tiled kitchen , cooking dinner !
But she remained before me as plainly as if she were still there .
‘ I myself should recommend it , governor , ’ assented <NAME> .
She told me , with assumed commiseration , that I had an unhappy temper .
The sound of retreating footsteps were audible and the voices ceased .
The debilitated cousin supposes he is `` 'normously rich fler . ''
Make 'em your models , my dear .
`` You romantic child , '' said she , lightly patting <NAME> 's back .
By-and-by the noise of the key in the lock arrested them both .
The system of inveigling continues , I believe , to this day .
I felt that I made them as uncomfortable as they made me .
`` Many ca n't go there ; and many would rather die . ''
‘ Who is he , you scoundrel , ’ interposed <NAME> .
It is not a great deal , that !
‘ You ’ re wery good , sir , ’ said <NAME> .
I can not trifle , or be trifled with .
‘ I wonder who that is , ’ said the queer little soul .
He could not think to any purpose .
`` Where can I lodge him hereabouts for the present ?
The whist-players were <NAME> and the old lady , <NAME> and the fat gentleman .
‘ <NAME> ’ t tell me , ’ said Mrs. Sparsit , aloud .
It is a most miserable thing to feel ashamed of home .
And do you cool yourself in that stream now , my young friend ?
And I have done so .
<NAME> creetur , I think I hear her now .
‘ Oh Lord ! ’ gasped Mr Fledgeby .
shrieked the boy in a voice that rent the air .
'Well , what have you got to say to me ? '
‘ Your mother-in-law ’ s vill , <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> .
‘ What a bad disposition you have , <NAME> ! ’ returned my mother .
“ You have heard of the name .
`` It 's not my business , '' <NAME> returned .
And to think of a sweet little cherub being born inside the lock !
`` I beg your pardon , '' interposes <NAME> 's son 's father .
‘ So are you , sir , ’ said <NAME> , addressing <NAME> .
<NAME> replied with a nod of his head in the affirmative .
And she is NOT a grateful woman , <NAME> .
You can ’ t have any spite against Mr Twemlow !
said <NAME> , forcing a laugh as he finished the sentence .
It ’ s a long word for it .
observed the Jew , keeping his glistening eye steadily upon her .
It was a bitter day .
mercy indeed , ma'am , ' was the reply .
Went down into a modest life of usefulness and happiness .
When the day broke he was shut up in his rooms again .
This is a secret service altogether .
The Chief <NAME> the <NAME> of Office 26 .
I have infected everything I touched .
`` <NAME> , '' he returns , `` do not mention it .
You 're sure to come to it .
They must put their names down .
I tried to thank him , but couldn ’ t .
It is a duty that I must perform .
I am robbed , I am ruined !
'Do you see her now ? '
His eyes were turned towards the door , and lighted up as I entered .
`` Sir , you have not use me well .
`` What follows is without prejudice , miss ? ''
That I am not satisfied with her conduct .
We belong to the <NAME> .
‘ Ay , ’ said the old man .
Mrs Gowan , however , received him with condescension .
I dare say her husband wo n't object .
I will not stand by , and see it done .
_You_ have never been disappointed .
‘ I think it vill , mum , ’ replied <NAME> .
said <NAME> , with a fierce gesture .
<NAME> , harassed by more anxieties than one , was among this devoted band .
Will you please to enter the carriage ? '
You ’ ll think better of it tomorrow , sir .
On the other side , <NAME> .
What money has she got ? ''
I should have cried out , if I could .
I can sympathize with the objects .
We said yes , we had passed one night there .
It was brief enough on <NAME> ’ s part .
‘ Why , you have , ’ returned <NAME> .
‘ They have actually been devouring their food here .
said <NAME> , in a broken voice .
Why should I mind telling you ?
said <NAME> , holding out his hand .
She was wooed , not won , and they went their several ways .
Then , Mr <NAME> ’ s gentleman calls <NAME> , and <NAME> appears accordingly .
‘ You surprise me ! ’ cried <NAME> .
He 'll be eighty-two next birthday .
`` You may be assured of it . ''
He understood my feeling and entirely shared it .
That ’ s a fair and gentlemanlike division of labour , anyhow .
<NAME> , come in. ’ ‘ Come in , ’ cried <NAME> faintly .
‘ Old ! ’ repeated the other peevishly .
`` Marrow puddings , '' says <NAME> instantly .
'Good stuff that , ' observed <NAME> , smacking his lips .
It was a world in which there was no other sort of bankruptcy whatever .
says the stationer , stopping to speak .
Up with you on your pins .
None of you need show .
He had a very agreeable face , and , I thought , was handsome .
She 's coming to the bed .
‘ There , there , there ! ’ urged Mr Boffin , not unkindly .
‘ Exactly so , ’ returned my aunt .
<NAME> of time. ’ Kate retired as she was directed .
‘ Will you like that ? ’ said <NAME> to Mr Dombey .
you can ’ t think how short they kept me !
You have found her , you say .
Ve-ry happy to receive <NAME> of <NAME> beneath my humble roof ! ''
'Is the old 'un here ? '
`` Very good , '' says <NAME> .
`` I have learned a lesson now , sir .
And what was <NAME> 's business in which we was to go pardners ?
'Come , sir , ' said <NAME> , tartly ; 'suppress your feelings . '
And I ’ ll tell you why .
I wish to meet my uncle face to face .
I am afraid I have none to spare , even now .
The children know him by no other name .
I am sorry of it .
He is no more like flesh and blood than a rusty old carbine is .
May I remove it from the outer case ?
<NAME> came to his side while he was in the height of his wonderment .
For its author. ’ ‘ Oh , indeed ! ’ rejoined <NAME> .
‘ Precisely what made me consider the thing so fair and easy .
`` He is a singular character , '' said I .
But I found I did not disturb it at all .
cries Mrs. Bagnet in the most natural manner .
I mean who are able to go outside .
`` Has he asked for me ? ''
The difference between our ages , tastes , and habits , forbids it .
that innocentest creetur <NAME> , ’ returned <NAME> hysterically .
`` There we go again , <NAME> ! ''
I was in the <NAME> with him ; I am quite a sailor .
Is there any of the <NAME> ’ s ware here ?
‘ It ’ s a bargain , sir , ’ said he .
‘ It was the first occasion of every unhappy moment I have known .
You must try some other establishment , sir .
`` On account of the grass , I think .
‘ I want to talk to you so much ! ’ said I .
I wouldn ’ t have him if he was made of gold .
You are a man of family .
I ’ ve my reasons for knowing , if I can .
There was a library in <NAME> , to which general access was easy .
When he has finished his story and his bread , they go on again .
<NAME> <NAME> , adjusting his cravat , then looked at us .
Then he commanded him to bring number five , and number eight .
He felt his disadvantage , and he showed it .
I gathered them as I came out of the garden .
I had to pass through that part , to get at the other .
Shall I wait , while you ask if <NAME> has left for my place ?
‘ <NAME> , <NAME> , it never does !
Why , I do n't know which I want .
I cry in my sleep where is he ?
He was more unlike himself than I could have supposed possible .
<NAME> defames me , and her guests defame me .
<NAME> had by no means overrated the measure of the good doctor 's wrath .
You know already that I come from somewhere , and am going somewhere else .
'The room-door is open , is it ? '
I engaged to pay him , sir .
I shall have to dispose of him , I fear .
When I love a person very tenderly indeed , it seems to brighten .
‘ I was thinking of you , at that moment , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Your guardian has spoken to me too , <NAME> dear .
`` I am ready , '' says the trooper , coming back .
‘ Clear-headed , strong-minded person , ’ added <NAME> .
No , I have not been able to dispose of <NAME> yet .
‘ “ Set me down , <NAME> , ” she said faintly .
‘ Have you read the papers , <NAME> ? ’ inquired the <NAME> .
Here is my Hotel-note to be paid , according to contract .
<NAME> <NAME> roused at the name .
When will you come to see me ? ''
I should think it must have been as much as seven feet high .
‘ Oh , my heart on fire , show the jacket to us !
They wouldn ’ t vex you much , I ’ m sure .
Why , I could tell you a story -- with <NAME> 's permission . ''
‘ And that ’ s how I come here by myself .
‘ Never mind me , <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> .
But , otherwise , how far above the human listener is the brute !
said the old gentleman , 'you look pale and alarmed .
‘ <NAME> , ma ’ am , true , ’ cried Mr Brass .
`` He might n't mean it -- or he even might .
I am anxious about mother .
'How precious dull you are , <NAME> ! '
‘ No , my love , ’ said Mr Sparkler .
`` I can , and I do , '' I said .
We shall catch them yet before they reach the next stage .
When he laughed , certain jerks occurred in it , and the rattle sprung .
That he had a specific object <NAME> could not doubt .
Your gov ’ nor can ’ t do no good here , <NAME> .
Make the best of your way .
She ’ s an idiot , a wanderer in her mind .
`` This is the end of it , you see !
It lighted up the room where the murdered woman lay .
To confess in that way that he IS a little slow for human life .
His wife , too , they placed on her usual ground .
“ You had better stand aside , ” said I to the poor creature .
‘ We are such a ridiculous couple .
‘ About HER ! ’ cried Mrs. Nickleby .
You want the last word .
I beg to recall them .
‘ Are you hurt ? ’ inquired <NAME> , with great anxiety .
‘ <NAME> here ? ’ he said cheerfully , as he closed his book .
My dear <NAME> , how can you be so blind ?
Eleven years of solitary confinement !
In the bunk in the corner , her brother lay asleep .
You ’ re a chap that I pick up in the street .
‘ Do not let me derange you ; pray be tranquil .
`` She is very fortunate in her guardian . ''
We must get him to do something for your mother .
I see the brass underneath <NAME> silver plating .
‘ <NAME> us where to look. ’ ‘ Ah !
With the new life , came new purpose , new intention .
‘ I have not a brother ’ s right , ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> is a part of my character .
They must be reared , I suppose ? ’ <NAME> nodded his head .
‘ <NAME> is <NAME> ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
But I shall be able to give myself fair-play by and by .
Well , dear me , it IS a pleasure , this is !
I hate myself for this ; you are all so good and kind .
“ Heads , ” as the pieman says .
What good does it do ? '
His countenance fell as he replied , ‘ Certainly , sir .
She has worn herself away by constant sharpening .
‘ <NAME> , ’ returned the passenger , in a ferocious voice .
‘ <NAME> pale nose , with a red knob in the middle .
What was it I said just now ?
‘ Those are not mine , my dear , ’ said I .
I never was blind to hers .
“ Do you call the whole reckoning ? ” said <NAME> .
`` Will you take any other vegetables ?
says <NAME> , throwing out the coin , which <NAME> catches neatly .
<NAME> took rose-colour to mean the colour of roses .
<NAME> , my pet ! ’ ‘ Not dead , too !
<NAME> withdraws to inquire , leaving man alone with J .
<NAME> <NAME> was there , and in his most engaging state .
`` We have got it at last .
`` Say that he wants to patronize me , '' pursued <NAME> .
‘ How do you find yourself , <NAME> ’ am ?
‘ <NAME> , ’ he said , laying his hand on his shoulder .
I thought I had better go .
‘ <NAME> , I resolved to come here alone , and appeal to you .
It seems wider and more busy than it used to be .
Better for you as it is .
He paused to look round before entering .
There were no present symptoms which could be deemed conclusive .
But , it was bound too tight for that .
But what would they gain by this ?
Provide somebody to take care of you .
Consequently , I rely upon your ladyship 's honour . ''
<NAME> say no more , <NAME> .
Old familiar declining and falling off the <NAME> ?
I shall need a long rest .
‘ You are too solicitous about him .
We have pretended well enough to one another .
Do you think you could ?
‘ How ? ’ asked <NAME> anxiously .
And there ’ s sure to be some business in it !
Odours , as from vaults and damp places , came out of the chimneys .
The very words he had been on the point of suggesting .
He carried me about with him when I was quite a baby .
But he seemed to listen , I thought , too .
All beyond the pitiless stone wall , is unknown space .
`` Let me leave it alone , then , '' said <NAME> .
I think I am better , ’ responded <NAME> .
`` Shall I run 'em over , <NAME> ? ''
He sat down by me on the sofa , supporting me with his arm .
‘ Thank you , ’ replied <NAME> .
The sanguine reaction manifest in <NAME> was proof even against this unlooked-for declaration .
It is of no consequence , and I am very much obliged to you .
`` You wo n't repent it , <NAME> .
‘ Lor , I ’ ll tell you what , ’ said Mrs. Kenwigs .
<NAME> <NAME> bullied and beat , eh ?
For there was something very comfortable in having plenty of stationery .
‘ It was at <NAME> where we last met .
The schoolmaster can ’ t attend to me and the boys too .
‘ <NAME> situation this , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Do you like it ? ’ asked Mr Boffin , turning suddenly .
'It 's only about young Twist , my dear , ' said <NAME> .
‘ What is the matter ? ’ he said , sternly .
<NAME> <NAME> , at which Mrs .
Either <NAME> , or the strange man who had shown me the file .
‘ Is it possible ? ’ said <NAME> .
He knew her story , and it was not that .
Why , how slow you are !
cried <NAME> almost in a yell .
‘ You closed my heart against the whole world , years and years .
They 'll make the <NAME> nothing less than a lifer . '
If there is any better place for such things , where is it ?
Mary , apparently much relieved , hurried away with her message .
There had been some talk on occasions of my going to boarding-school .
He dared not think of what he feared .
‘ Cat ! ’ repeated the old gentleman .
Twenty years , my friend , twenty years in this hideous grave !
Here are some people <NAME> knows , going out to <NAME> shortly .
‘ Drink with me , my dear , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ How ’ s <NAME> ? ’ inquired the <NAME> .
Come Mrs. Tope and attendant sweeping sprites .
So the <NAME> said , I never will betray you .
Because he did not love <NAME> .
‘ No word has passed between you ?
<NAME> , dear <NAME> , don ’ t stop there .
In fact , <NAME> was in love with <NAME> .
Will Jenny be here soon ?
A great crowd assembles in <NAME> 's <NAME> on the day of the funeral .
It was a family hotel in a quiet but handsome street near <NAME> .
cried the girl , whose passion was frightful to see .
Months upon months over the sea , and far away even then .
‘ All the way where ? ’ inquired the carrier .
The beating of my heart came back again .
He has known her ever since .
After tea there were exercises again , and preparations for next day by candlelight .
The Spirits have done it all in one night .
‘ A regular plant , ’ added <NAME> .
‘ Because I was so tired of you , ’ returns <NAME> .
‘ Money is scarce , ’ said <NAME> .
I pitied her so much .
The turnkey followed him with his eyes .
`` Here I am , '' says <NAME> .
Would I come and look at it ?
Why , he sees those chimneys -- the tallest ones !
Suddenly , <NAME> turned to retrace his course .
Much obliged to you , I ’ m sure .
I must look to myself here . '
`` It 's hanging there now , '' replied the boy .
where do they come from ?
you are acquainted with him ? ’ asked <NAME> .
Kiss me once more , <NAME> .
‘ Is <NAME> an orphan like me , aunt ? ’ said the child .
I was a posthumous child .
He used to nod , at first , and then we came to speak .
I am grieved to hear it .
‘ <NAME> ’ t ask me no more .
`` It did better than that .
Now , who should receive me , he asked .
‘ It is dated very soon after the son ’ s flight .
<NAME> ’ r <NAME> , speak to him for me !
‘ So has Mrs. Leo Hunter , <NAME> .
His delight in his own name over the door , is inexhaustible .
They found <NAME> at home , and alone .
I believe <NAME> belonged to a <NAME> .
His dismissal of himself from his description , was hardly less remarkable .
‘ Really comforting , because you must have had a large experience of them .
In fact , can ’ t be surprised .
At the great iron gate of the churchyard he stopped and looked in .
The ball itself was always changing too .
A dish of sweetbreads now , or a bit of mutton .
‘ Is every boy here ? ’ asked Squeers , in a tremendous voice .
Are you there ? ’ ‘ Who speaks to me ?
'What foolery are you up to , now , again ?
‘ What do you want ? ’ said Mr Dombey .
No , she didn ’ t see why it was of course .
The spinster aunt heeded not the remark ; she thought it applied to <NAME> .
'What makes you look so flurried ? '
My <NAME> will receive him now .
You air in correspondence with Mr .
`` What a Dame Durden it is to read a face ! ''
All weathers saw the man at the post .
I am no such thing .
'Well , here I am , ' returned <NAME> .
And I tell you what we ’ ll do .
‘ He is your brother , ’ said my mother , fondling me .
Sometimes , it seemed to stop altogether , and then the soldiers stopped .
‘ It did , ma ’ am , ’ he returned .
I heard you were writing in the library .
So they rode on characteristically enough .
I was alone , and had a dull sense of being alone .
‘ Oh dear , no ! ’ said <NAME> , stroking his chin .
I want to talk to you , my dear .
He had only made an innocent and natural mistake .
( Decisively , as he puts up his watch . )
The usual dinner-hour is two o ’ clock .
He ’ s worst when he ’ s quiet .
I was always your little favourite at home , and you were always mine .
This lady is the mother of sweet <NAME> .
‘ My name ? ’ returned the man .
She lives about twenty miles from here , <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> ; you think them strange , because you know nothing about it .
In crossing the bridge , she dropped the door key in the river .
There ’ s somebody wants to see you there .
Now , why should you press Mr Twemlow ?
‘ Attend to the poor girl , ’ said the first surgeon then .
I am going to say something I have often thought of saying , lately .
But I want my Noddy to consult with us .
To the Guillotine all aristocrats !
Your position -- ’ ‘ Eh ? ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Where does she live ? ’ cried <NAME> .
A man was standing there , in parley with the watchman .
I ’ ll see Mr Gills directly .
They are here. ” “ They are here .
You shall never keep it from me again .
My heart 's in my mouth .
What business have I in this present world , except to stick to business ?
We had then merely to dispose of <NAME> .
All this time , my leg and foot were in the air .
Do n't know that Jo is short for a longer name .
This is taste. ’ The girl curtseyed , and sat down .
`` I can take a morsel of dinner standing and be off . ''
'What 's the matter with you , porochial <NAME> ? '
You have seen <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> ! ’ said <NAME> , harder than ever .
It made me for some part of that night uncomfortable .
I 've often wondered what his name might be .
“ Rely upon the patriotic <NAME> , dear citizeness .
He had never entertained the possibility of its arraying itself against him .
You must stand by me , <NAME> like a good man and true .
‘ _I_ completely mistaken on that subject !
<NAME> <NAME> ’ s renown was not long confined to us .
So did every one when they came .
If <NAME> and <NAME> could wait , <NAME> can wait .
How can money be a corpse ’ s ?
I saw them both , as plainly as I see you now . '
What ’ s the matter ? ’ cried the sleeper , starting .
I only want a little rousing ; that 's all . '
‘ I am hungry and in want .
I give him up to you !
My Lord knows nothing of it .
I think there can be nothing else .
`` What have you been doing here ?
‘ You reside here , <NAME> ? ’ said Mr Dombey , addressing her .
‘ Good-night , my dear Sir ! ’ said <NAME> between his set teeth .
He carries its people too .
“ The younger brother impatiently rejoined , 'With twelve o'clock ? '
And round went the poker again , more fiercely than before .
He went over it all again .
That is not my name .
`` What do you call this ? ''
'Certainly , my dear , certainly , ' replied the old gentleman .
There was such a thing sometimes , even in <NAME> .
Is there any one in view at present ? ''
‘ What ’ s the matter , <NAME> ? ’ said Mr Boffin .
There are still a few trifles that we could part with .
and condemned as a traitor. ” At this the crowd roared approval .
This is a great trial to me , a great trial .
‘ Not a bit of it. ’ ‘ Handford then , ’ suggested <NAME> .
‘ It appears as if you don ’ t know , one the other .
Under that pretence he began to retort upon me .
I an ’ t a <NAME> , I an ’ t .
If my mother-in-law blows him up , he whistles .
They are all indescribable alike .
‘ Nothing at all , sir , ’ replied <NAME> .
May I imprint a -- a one -- upon it ?
He attended on us , as I may say , in sackcloth and ashes .
It was all your father ’ s doing .
`` It has been very near discovery .
I can never grow out of that .
They could just make out that the <NAME> <NAME> stopped to breathe .
Is your business urgent ? ’ ‘ It is very urgent , returned Carker .
We are very much obliged to you ! ''
<NAME> over and swear the jury !
‘ If there should be someone listening and watching , ’ whispered <NAME> .
He had an intuitive perception of <NAME> ; he knew him at once .
'Does you good , does it ! '
What do you mean by risk ?
‘ Has he ? ’ cried the old man .
What the Waves were always saying 17 .
And she was tried , and she was sentenced .
‘ <NAME> ’ t be longer than you can conweniently help , sir .
The astonished fashionable intelligence hardly knows where to have her .
Why , how soon you rust in my absence !
Why , they would have it so !
I encouraged her and praised her with all my heart .
<NAME> was very pretty , and it is pleasant to admire a pretty face .
But he only gloomily thought it , and said nothing .
<NAME> 's <NAME> had a run upon it in the mail .
'We should n't like to lose you .
`` Oh , dear no , sir , I 'm sure of that ! ''
A month or so will make years of difference .
So that 's <NAME> , is it ! ''
‘ The elder brother married her .
<NAME> , his face flushing suddenly , strikes the desk with his clenched hand .
‘ “ What is it , my dear ? ” said my uncle .
<NAME> any one you see , and every one what has happened .
It was eight o'clock now .
‘ Are you faint ? ’ inquired the anxious <NAME> .
Suppose you were going to carpet a room .
<NAME> way have they taken ? '
‘ He takes too strong and direct an interest in the case .
This is some of your tricks !
You must never breathe this to any one .
I tell you no more of him beforehand .
<NAME> raised her lips to his face , and kissed him .
I have often thought I should like to have it .
But he had n't , because nobody had taught him .
You 're a gentleman of experience , and ought to know .
If I utter a threat , stop me , and fasten it upon me .
Bending low among the dewy grass , Mrs. <NAME> advanced closer to them .
You are part of my existence , part of myself .
I did not know what to think .
<NAME> , or at the most thirteen , might be near the mark .
You ca n't make <NAME> responsible .
‘ <NAME> , ’ said Mrs. Leo Hunter .
I will produce myself , only too quickly .
said the housebreaker wiping the perspiration from his face .
‘ I hear him now ! ’ cried <NAME> , starting .
Do you mind so little what I said but now ?
‘ Such things are not much in demand hereabouts .
We were soon equipped and went out .
He was always anxious to increase his stock of experience .
May it flourish for ever !
<NAME> <NAME> therefore soon proposes to walk singly .
Yet he was enjoying it in his own way .
It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five .
‘ Not just yet awhile , <NAME> .
‘ Then I will , ’ said <NAME> .
The prejudiced public had stood out against it obstinately .
`` Why , what age do you call that little creature ? ''
<NAME> knows when your poor child will see <NAME> again .
‘ It ’ s—it ’ s ridiculously mild , ’ said <NAME> .
Hence I would forget , and I do forget , nothing .
He bent down , over his boy , and kissed him .
There were no other visitors at <NAME> ’ s .
<NAME> <NAME> was at his lunch .
He knocked -- gently at first -- then loud and vigorously .
You are looking charming , <NAME> .
But that sword looks awful gleaming and sharp .
‘ Do you want him ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , ’ replied the visitor .
<NAME> , to be sure , so there is !
<NAME> don ’ t be rough with him .
is your mistress a <NAME> ? ’ said <NAME> with a chuckle .
'He appears against this boy , your worship . '
`` Why , it 's a wonder , <NAME> ! ''
here you are , sir ! ’ said <NAME> .
“ I forgot it , ” he said .
“ A which ? ” says the <NAME> ’ en .
This is a very trying wind ! ''
I am not quite trodden down .
I will not help him , or those who help him .
What do you say now ? ''
What is that in your hand ?
‘ I KNOW you have , ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> , being a particularly Angular man , I should not have intruded here .
Come to the money stolen , or I will !
It was very pleasant to see the Doctor with his pretty young wife .
At one while my journey looked hopeful , and at another hopeless .
said <NAME> , bursting into the room .
She had meditated and taken comfort .
‘ Oh you naughty <NAME> , ’ said the old lady .
There was a look of interest for him again .
‘ How are the two poor little Minders ? ’ asked <NAME> .
I was not prepared for it .
‘ No such a thing , sir .
The more cracked it was , the more Mrs General varnished it .
'You see the stairs afore you ? '
Why wouldn ’ t you ? ’ A pause .
I , who forfeited mine long ago !
Nicholas could say no more , and silently withdrew .
`` You do n't believe in me , '' observed the <NAME> .
How do I make that out ?
<NAME> is a most excellent man , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
In this room , which was never used , a light was burning .
And as she looked upon him now , a smile was on her face .
<NAME> and nob , ” returned the sergeant .
‘ Mama ! ’ said <NAME> , hurriedly advancing .
‘ <NAME> , can you guess , <NAME> ? ’ said <NAME> .
My eyes are opened , all at once .
The state of the man was murderous , and he knew it .
‘ <NAME> said so ? ’ <NAME> replied .
Conceive the fancies of a feverish brain , in such a place as this !
I shall not be without means .
In consequence of the judgment I expect being shortly given .
‘ Yes , ’ she said , with a kind of laugh .
You ca n't answer for him ? ''
‘ It _is_ very warm , my Lord , ’ replied the M.C .
There was no answer , and the sound went on without any interruption .
‘ There ! ’ said <NAME> , thrusting his pocket-book in his side pocket .
We had now seen all there was to see .
That , of course , I know you would not abandon .
Suppose we make up a party and volunteer ? ''
Come back no more till you hear from me or see me .
`` You do n't quite credit me , my dear !
‘ Nearly ready , sir ? ’ I inquired .
‘ <NAME> ’ t assure me ! ’ said Mr Dorrit .
The figure-head had not yet disappeared , but remained in its old place .
<NAME> 's last report was that the boy was quiet .
‘ A tidy shot that , I flatter myself , ’ he then soliloquised .
I have never been unfaithful to you or your schooling .
<NAME> : <NAME> is considered , in the profession , a respectable man ?
“ She is an Angel ! ” said The <NAME> , and embraced her .
And he smeared his ragged rough sleeve over his eyes .
He was bolder in the daylight -- most men are .
He keeps very close to him .
I like it on account of its name .
‘ And this , ’ said <NAME> , looking up .
I hope you can tell me so ?
So she called him guardian , and has called him guardian ever since .
‘ I see the shadow of him in her face !
In the drawing-room , there was the mother knitting and watching again .
<NAME> each other. ’ ‘ Welcome to Ba -- ath , <NAME> .
said <NAME> , looking after the beadle as he strode down the street .
‘ Do you know me , man ? ’ inquired the stranger angrily .
Let me confess exactly with what feelings I looked forward to <NAME> 's coming .
We shall call it Saint Clare and <NAME> day .
<NAME> to see you , glad to see you ! ''
`` More than eighteen hundred , '' said the <NAME> .
‘ You ’ ll know better by-and-by , my man , ’ he said .
‘ Davy who ? ’ said the gentleman .
yer a cunning old codger ! '
This pretence , much favoured by the lady-visitors , led to the ghastliest absurdities .
<NAME> can take it easily .
`` What do you want with me ? ''
“ Good-bye , <NAME> ! ” <NAME> called out as we started .
‘ There you ’ re right , ’ assented <NAME> .
Your childhood was like mine , I suppose .
‘ I came round to him in time , ’ said <NAME> .
He had been some few leagues behind <NAME> , early in the afternoon .
‘ But this is a lady ’ s card , ’ said <NAME> .
`` Anything you please , sir , '' returned <NAME> .
‘ Not yet , ’ assents the <NAME> .
They was obliged to stamp upon it to git it in .
She pretends I am not .
‘ You , resent his self-will ! ’ she exclaimed .
‘ What ’ s in training , <NAME> ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
I hope you are well .
He points again , in great agitation , at the two words .
`` Oh , yes you do , I think .
`` Put that shawl on me . ''
‘ What is to come of it ?
“ You will naturally be anxious to hear of the witness , <NAME> .
Well ! ’ when somebody had done so .
‘ <NAME> me , ’ said the gentleman .
The clerks were there , but nobody was doing anything .
Nor were these the only dismal feelings which depressed <NAME> .
he said , `` this is a fearful place .
You have nothing to do with it .
‘ All right , sir , ’ replied <NAME> .
‘ It might have been twice twenty .
My memory may be bad , but not with me , I think .
Or rather , I thought you might be busy too .
They stopped at length , and <NAME> alighted at the gate of the Fleet .
Of a want of custom ? ’ said the <NAME> , suddenly reappearing .
`` Have a spirit , if you 're fond of <NAME> ! ''
‘ Does <NAME> live here ? ’ ‘ Mr .
It was not asked , and you see me here .
Showing how <NAME> got into Difficulties 44 .
He had never yet altered his old manner .
`` You are a fine young fellow .
How could it be otherwise ? ’ exclaimed the irrepressible Fanny .
And was gone with great speed .
what are these to me ?
No , she tells him ; he is in <NAME> .
Could I possibly support it ?
How sorry I am , to have been the unhappy cause of all this !
Had no notion who he was .
he cried in an unearthly screech .
She was not past seventeen .
what did you strike him for ? ’ demanded the others .
Mistress Affery makes a <NAME> , respecting her Dreams 24 .
‘ This is <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ I don ’ t think that would do .
<NAME> draws nearer to the housekeeper .
Her face was innocent and youthful , and its expression remarkably pleasant .
It was paved and clean , but grass was growing in every crevice .
Is this the gentleman ’ s little purse ?
‘ Have you seen my gal , then ? ’ cried the old woman .
said <NAME> , clasping both my guardian 's hands eagerly .
`` But it was n't handsome in you , Mr .
The house in town is not prepared for her reception .
“ That 's the man , wrapped in the cloak .
There may be such contagion in me ; I don ’ t know .
‘ A little , if you please , ’ replied <NAME> .
`` I was coming to you this morning , '' observes the trooper reluctantly .
Your feelings do you honour .
Are you going away soon ? ’ ‘ <NAME> ? ’ I repeated .
‘ How dare you address me , as dear Sir , <NAME> ?
Why should I hint , and beat about the bush ?
`` <NAME> , '' said <NAME> , `` this is <NAME> . ''
And shall then confer estates . ''
Wished to know how he was .
<NAME> DRIVER ( with his eyes starting out of his head ) .
‘ And <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Yes , and him too .
He knows he is at home there , I suppose ?
I that was her little maid when she was a little child !
There 's nothing the matter ; I will come to you presently . ''
I have added to my collection of birds . ''
<NAME> <NAME> took up a fresh piece of toast , and groaned heavily .
she inquired , watching <NAME> 's thoughtful face .
`` But its mistress remains , guardian . ''
It had not been clouded , except for a passing moment , until now .
You know you might fall sick , ’ said Mr Boffin .
' I hope so , sir , ' replied <NAME> .
`` You will think of many little things perhaps , by and by .
After a silence he is asked , `` In which room ? ''
<NAME> <NAME> thought I could .
I am here to be bought off , and I have named my figure .
You know that , my dear , perfectly well .
God bless you ! ’ ‘ Clara ! ’ <NAME> repeated .
<NAME> <NAME> has no eyes for either of these magnates .
“ What vapour is that ? ” he asked .
' I am not afraid of your wife . '
'No imagination , ' replied the girl in a hoarse voice .
Matter of life or death .
Perhaps <NAME> knows there is .
They both stopped and looked at me .
cried the voice which belonged to the legs which had kicked at the door .
That is done with , and disposed of .
She went on forgetting him with compound interest after that .
Not only was the portrait there , but we found the original there too .
The lady that was here last night , you know . ''
`` I should hope I did , '' replied the lad .
Why , look at you , dear boy !
He slowly shook the shadow off , and turned to her .
Now , as to a letter .
he retorted with the same glance behind him .
`` With the lawyer , '' I returned .
I am not accountable to <NAME> or Mr .
‘ Let us have a look at the husband of the remarkable lady .
she has money in her own right in any case .
He had struck fire out of her , and was surprised .
‘ So soon ! ’ said the dwarf .
All the natural charm of the previous day was gone .
‘ I can , ’ replied <NAME> .
Which the housemaid says is very true .
It is not my capital that is invested in the business .
“ I hold another card , <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> ’ s <NAME> ’ ly ? ’ said <NAME> .
He appointed him to go abroad .
‘ I am going to speak to you , <NAME> .
Nelly ’ s very fond of me .
My guardian said no more , and <NAME> arrived .
But this was a question of taste .
Mr and Mrs <NAME> .
replied <NAME> , looking vacantly at his questioner .
‘ I don ’ t know , ’ said my aunt .
she asks , still looking at the distant sky .
‘ It agrees with me ! ’ said Mr Toots .
<NAME> , I will be plain with you .
Not to mind me when I come and go .
Now I 'll tell you something more , wolf , and this ends it .
Gi ’ us thee hond , mun .
`` <NAME> is here , '' replied <NAME> .
'Well , what 's that to me ? '
‘ <NAME> ’ t be too sure of that , ’ said <NAME> .
And what do they want here , is it ?
<NAME> , though , ’ added Mrs. Nickleby , pausing to consider .
A breakfast-stall at a street-corner suggests the first thing to be done .
Her conduct was surprisingly bad .
‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ ask your own heart .
But I have no sympathy , ’ whimpered Mrs. Nickleby .
Is the hand not always pointing there ?
It 'll do as well as anything else .
It had been an immoveable idea since he first set eyes upon her .
Take time. ” It was a poorer hand than he suspected .
But no more of business on this day .
And again blew off that remarkable sound .
‘ No one can ’ t reproach my darling in <NAME> .
‘ But it ’ s not for you at all .
‘ To-morrow , then , ’ he suggested , at last .
If you ’ re an eel , sir , conduct yourself like one .
But you can ’ t see <NAME> .
The peerage contributes more four-wheeled affliction than has ever been seen in that neighbourhood .
( This with a cow-like lightness . )
It is only a question of a few hours .
She is as insolent and false as any woman in the world .
We shall make good our title .
Receiving none , he turned towards his more familiar acquaintance .
But Mr Dombey frigidly lifts her off , and hands her to a chair .
‘ And you know where she is gone , ’ hazarded <NAME> .
You have no business here .
Soldiers with lanterns , at the guard-house there .
And these qualities are not regulated in him , somehow .
‘ I should like to have seen that dog , ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> this way , <NAME> .
'The thieves -- the house they took me to ! '
I carry it no further than that .
This accidental circumstance was the signal for some very decisive proceedings .
She is all in all to me .
But he could do so now when she entreated him .
exclaimed <NAME> , looking at <NAME> .
That he has no right to do it ?
I am very glad you have changed it -- very -- very . '
Now a word about affairs that are not exactly mine .
And _I_ know you 're <NAME> , you know .
`` How does my own Pride look , <NAME> ? ''
<NAME> , <NAME> , ’ replied the attorney .
In his own expressive language he was ‘ floored. ’ So was <NAME> .
‘ Such a one-er , ’ returned the <NAME> .
What have I been and done ?
‘ The truth is , it ’ s my wife .
`` Neither , '' says Mrs. Chadband as before .
His eyes were filled with tears .
“ Yes , ” says I , “ feeckle , dom ’ d feeckle .
‘ It is , ’ replied the host .
By <NAME> ’ s side on the table are a writing-desk and writing materials .
Still the power to hint a wish !
‘ Half our work is done already .
Who was he ? ” “ Your clemency , <NAME> !
`` Did she go last night ? ''
interposed <NAME> : with a gleam of pleasure in his metallic eyes .
Mr <NAME> meant him to be racked .
‘ I think I can do you a good turn .
Well-behaved young gentleman reduced to such a necessity !
I will go so far as to say it is an odious one .
It dated from that very night .
But it wo n't do to think of it !
“ He is well hidden , but at last he is unluckily found .
I rejoice to see you !
<NAME> <NAME> 's situation is all one , whether or no . ''
‘ No , ’ returned <NAME> , bending a severe look upon him .
<NAME> and <NAME> XXVI .
Why should she spare others ? ''
`` Excuse me , <NAME> , '' says <NAME> , quite unmoved .
Now , where DOES she live ?
Dismiss the <NAME> patronage from consideration ?
‘ Why , of course I did , ’ replied <NAME> .
An icicle must have got into the works .
It is no longer your secret .
<NAME> <NAME> , you and your brother are twin children .
Every man must live , and ought to it . ''
‘ Come , sir , ’ said <NAME> , laughing in spite of himself .
What an honest expression it has in its face !
`` And in the meanwhile leave <NAME> ? ''
Here it is , a perfect instrument ! ''
I know what it is ! ''
“ I listened to the patient 's breathing , and avoided answering .
‘ I believe the <NAME> ’ s is an excellent establishment .
And leave his old comrade .
<NAME> ’ s Place is changed into <NAME> in the winter time .
whispers Grandfather Smallweed , rubbing his legs .
I asked <NAME> what he considered the best sort of professional business ?
said the doctor , as <NAME> joined him and <NAME> at the breakfast-table .
A profound silence , quite contrary to <NAME> ’ s expectation , succeeded .
<NAME> dropped her , Mr Lightwood .
whispered a voice close to his ear .
A watch was evidently kept upon the place .
People might not think so well of him outside as they do there .
How do you feel , my dear ? '
I called <NAME> to me and gave her her last charge .
One thing only , was clear to the girl ’ s mind .
‘ You understand it now , <NAME> , ’ said my aunt .
His comrade replied that this was the chicken in question .
However , I am not going to bear it , I am determined .
Here is a man lighting the lamps .
“ I am told you had a remarkable breed of tumblers .
‘ Oh , he is , is he ? ’ said <NAME> .
Yet that can scarcely be , for they are older than himself .
From that moment , his heart began to fail him .
`` Not the least doubt of it , '' answered <NAME> .
I seldom take it. ’ ‘ Well ! ’ said Mr Dorrit .
‘ Done pretty taut and trim , hey , shipmet ? ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Yes , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ I understand there ’ s money .
It is cold and dark .
I have not seen much of ‘ em .
O boofer lady , fascinating boofer lady !
‘ They may be put on , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
It is not a professional course of proceeding .
‘ I beg your forgiveness , ’ said the visitor .
They were a boy and girl .
She threw herself upon the bed heavily , and soon was snoring hard .
‘ How can that be , <NAME> ? ’ said Mr Dorrit .
I told you I was going out of town ?
‘ The regular chummage is two-and-six .
It lay nearly under there .
An air of retreat and solitude hung about the rooms and about their inhabitant .
Little <NAME> was passing that day at <NAME> ’ s .
I explained that I knew nothing about it .
My sweet D. still much depressed .
You didn ’ t nod to anybody , <NAME> ?
We were quickly ready and went out .
Have I lured <NAME> from his happy home to expose him to this !
Saying which he turned into the house and banged the door after him .
It ca n't be , ” said the spy .
Accordingly he nodded , and made as though he would shake hands with him .
`` And <NAME> 's address , Mr .
“ Oh dear me , sir ? ” repeated <NAME> , drawing back .
‘ Speculate with it , ’ said Mrs. Nickleby .
You know what a hard-working , steady-going chap he is .
He rang the bell a great many times , and yet nobody came .
The blockhead mustn ’ t leave the law at present .
‘ Mr Clennam , I am glad to see you .
Dear me , you know that quite as well as I !
<NAME> at <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> !
They seem little more than a summer day and a winter evening .
<NAME> is this here business ?
But the boys sometimes— ’ ‘ O !
I have come here on purpose .
<NAME> over toe -- cut and shuffle -- pay away at it , <NAME> !
‘ <NAME> those papers away , if you please .
Mr <NAME> interposed to prevent that consummation .
‘ How you do take up a cove , <NAME> !
`` We look afar off , sir , '' returned <NAME> .
<NAME> , I am a <NAME> -- a <NAME> ( cheers ) .
Not more than other gentlemen do .
‘ This is a singular visit , Mr Pancks .
I am sorry because I believe there is contamination in such a scoundrel .
‘ Who told you so ? ’ said <NAME> .
With that he rose , as if to depart .
So there he stood , and there he listened .
‘ For <NAME> ’ s sake don ’ t do that .
`` A bargain , '' said <NAME> .
'You 're a genius , my dear . '
`` He has had a long day in court .
Once again , let me pause upon a memorable period of my life .
‘ Where was the woman ever seen who resembled you ?
On this occasion , he was the last arrival .
<NAME> plate , my dear , such plate ! '
“ Well ; it 's a good thing , you know .
says <NAME> in a low voice .
<NAME> those ! ’ producing two other large keys .
`` Your son is indefatigable , '' said I .
I had it , and it was perfected .
Suffice it that <NAME> can never justify it to the grasp of _mine_ .
You could sing it once , in another jail .
I determined therefore to try the latter .
said <NAME> , determined not to be offended .
It was a slight knowledge , I know .
Now , what do you think of this rascal ? ''
How those three proud , overbearing brothers humbled themselves before me !
I have the misfortune of not being a fool .
It is not pleasant to my feelings ; it is repugnant to my feelings .
I assure you he is making out his case like a house a-fire .
‘ She has it when she comes of age , or marries .
<NAME> creatures , ’ murmured the Secretary .
At last he began to think he need not go at all .
You want a promise from me .
What do you always go out at my dinner-time for then -- eh ?
<NAME> said they thought it rather probable .
Oh yes -- dear me , how very good !
<NAME> was said on either side , for a minute or two afterwards .
‘ You spoke to me , miss , ’ he replied .
How very foolish of them , ’ said <NAME> , rising .
‘ Yes , it ’ s me , ’ replied a gruff voice .
<NAME> is now opening ahead of me .
‘ There was no city where <NAME> stands , then .
Only one room is empty .
‘ It wasn ’ t <NAME> only that was in it .
<NAME> <NAME> knows what <NAME> means .
‘ Thank you , <NAME> , ’ said Mrs. Sparsit .
And , <NAME> be his witness that he has his humour thoroughly gratified !
‘ How warn her father , and not tell him ?
<NAME> ’ t take on to mind me .
‘ Who , indeed , pa ! ’ replied that young lady , spitefully .
‘ What ’ s the matter ? ’ roared the master of the house .
She will be full of sympathy with its enemies .
Then I felt I could not do it .
<NAME> began in earnest next day .
I ’ m sure I gave you every opportunity .
Perhaps you saw it , and were not sorry .
Every facility was afforded me , that the utmost courtesy could suggest .
I can scarcely believe it now .
said the old lady with great stateliness .
‘ Are you really serious , Mr Clennam ?
‘ Where is <NAME> ? ’ said brother Ned .
‘ You surprise me ! ’ ‘ Bah ! ’ <NAME> retorted .
‘ His health ! ’ He took another sip .
“ Do n't you know ? ” “ No , ” said I .
The sight of him turns me against myself , and all of you . '
'Reminds me of being nabbed by the devil , ' returned <NAME> .
‘ No ? ’ ‘ No. ’ <NAME> stood in his favourite attitude .
I have felt something sharper than cold .
‘ Is <NAME> here , ma ’ am ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
`` I do n't know , <NAME> of <NAME> ! ''
Why do n't you go and fetch things ?
‘ Even the girls are happy .
‘ What sort of a fellow IS Our Mutual Friend , now ?
The sound of voices succeeded , and the tread of feet .
If she don ’ t , very well still .
‘ “ Lor , sir ! ” exclaimed the widow .
“ I think it might , ” says the doctor .
'Yes , ' replied the Jew , 'wherever she lays hands on him .
Why , what do _you_ know about tumblers ?
Thank you a thousand times .
We never know what o'clock it is , and we never care .
‘ And she suffered him ! ’ exclaimed the old lady .
‘ Are you avake , now ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , ’ rejoined <NAME> .
'You 're a woman , ' retorted <NAME> , plucking up a little .
Much marked with irons. ’ ‘ Ran away , the negress Fanny .
The next instant he subsided into his old state .
‘ From <NAME> ? ’ inquired the old man .
Is he dead ? ’ <NAME> shook his head .
He kissed her many times with ‘ Bless you , my love .
I tells her , “ O no , nothink wrong .
Nevertheless , I will answer the question presently .
‘ I have parted with the plate myself , ’ said Mrs. Micawber .
‘ <NAME> is a nice boy ’ ( thoughtfully ) .
Where is he going to ?
To whom , in their absence , <NAME> presents himself .
What <NAME> did , her sister did as a matter of course .
<NAME> stood alone beside the body when death came over it . '
Why should I be penitent , and all the world go free ?
'Now then , where are the witnesses ? '
<NAME> was of no consequence at all .
Presently , the dock became the central point of interest .
<NAME> will get no harm from me .
Is your profession really so engaging and interesting as to absorb your whole attention ?
This done , the companion hand appeared , and clasped the other ankle .
“ Now , <NAME> , ” said <NAME> , “ put this case .
It is an ascertained fact .
So , <NAME> comes to me , and I go to <NAME> .
Mr <NAME> was again agreeably embarrassed .
The dusky room was lighted by the fire .
He turned the dialogue to that point , and thanked him for it .
I only know that so it is .
The sharpness of the retort was next to telling the Secretary that he lied .
He saw <NAME> first , as he had heard her only .
mere fancy , ’ cried <NAME> , stooping to throw up the cinders .
Now , my dear sir -- cheque from <NAME> , <NAME> .
The door was closed and locked .
<NAME> 's countenance fell almost as low as the <NAME> 's had done .
Impossible ! ” “ You ca n't try , <NAME> ? ” “ No .
He could only bite his nails and puff away to the next Defaulter .
<NAME> at these here lodgings o'yourn , fit for a lord !
‘ Not Number Nine ? ’ asked <NAME> , hesitating .
‘ Many new ledgers since then .
I don ’ t find you looking at all well .
It ’ s nothing to me to go and find him .
' I must go back to her .
Both rose up , on seeing who it was .
It was a cheque for one hundred pounds .
‘ Take it away , take it away , ’ cried <NAME> .
Our friends at <NAME> Dell. ’ The toast was drunk with loud acclamations .
‘ Because he can ’ t , ’ said <NAME> .
`` Well , gentlemen -- '' the coroner begins .
This occasioned its terrors to be received derisively .
You must not be ill. ’ ‘ Oh !
‘ There , there , there ! ’ said <NAME> .
Where ? ’ ‘ Mr Headstone , have you heard the news ?
<NAME> knew that voice too well .
It was not addressed to him .
You are an unthankful dog of a Jew .
Once again I say it matters not .
Lying hidden in her bosom , was a loaded pistol .
<NAME> <NAME> had left him pretty well .
'It 's of a woman ; the hag that nursed his mother .
Let me hear it all .
‘ I beg your pardon , sir , I was directed to come in .
Why , she ’ ll be a fortune to you as an exhibition .
Hears I have conflicting interests , claims clashing against his and what not .
And I ’ ll take as much care of your mama , <NAME> .
“ My opinion is , it 's a sedan-chair .
‘ You had better let me have the key then , ’ says <NAME> .
It was a bright frosty morning .
‘ Thank you , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Better be quiet. ’ ‘ Better be quiet ? ’ repeated <NAME> .
' I 'm rather hoarse this morning , Mrs. Bedwin .
The <NAME> of Florence 49 .
inquired the gentleman in the white waistcoat .
And so he dines to-morrow and goes to the Opera with us .
You know the most I make of it .
<NAME> has been hardly used , <NAME> ’ am .
My entrance , and my saying what I wanted , roused her .
It is not the birthday of one of the three children .
‘ -- And <NAME> in the same breath ? ’ said the collector .
I can ’ t bear to see you striking with it .
‘ What are you a talking on ?
My human boy , come forward ! ''
`` Where have you come from ? ''
‘ What a delightful studiousness ! ’ said this accomplished gentleman .
<NAME> : I am not prepared to say that .
‘ Been in front tonight ? ’ said <NAME> .
Look after your legs if you do ! '
She laughs and sobs , and then is quiet , and quite happy .
Mr <NAME> -- have the goodness , sir , to take that arm .
You are the <NAME> of my <NAME> .
We were to drink tea at the <NAME> ’ s .
‘ In this , I know I speak the truth .
The thing is worth nothing in itself .
' I know that boy will be hung . '
All <NAME> had to start him in the race of life is ventured .
‘ <NAME> ’ t be alarmed , my darling .
More nor three shillings and sixpence for a thimbleful !
I usually walk here early .
By <NAME> , you ’ ll be corrupted in some of your notions here .
Oh the suspicion of you rich gentlefolks !
‘ That ’ s her , and so she is .
cried <NAME> , triumphantly , 'that 's where it is !
won ’ t they ! ’ said Mrs. Sanders .
She stayed with us nearly three weeks .
I 'll pound it , that <NAME> 's managing properly .
‘ Well ! ’ says <NAME> , after a lengthy silence .
He chafes and goads me till -- Bah !
It was clearly ill-timed after dinner .
Do you give me a minute 's calm attention , without looking at <NAME> .
‘ All right , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Mama ! ’ cried the child sobbing aloud .
And thus the night crept slowly on .
<NAME> make the best use of your time .
‘ Bless his heart ! ’ interposed Mrs. <NAME> , with a maternal sob .
‘ That is the last of Mr Lammle .
<NAME> contented without more ruin .
Let them lie unspoken of , in his breast .
Unfortunately for my peace of mind , I adore but too readily .
‘ Yes , <NAME> , ’ said the gardener .
You know all the men of this part of the country .
As far as it goes , it 's property and portable .
But don ’ t take <NAME> of <NAME> , nor yet <NAME> of Gloucester .
Let us see how fast we can travel !
She was close before him with extended arms , but he fell back .
‘ Now , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
When it becomes due , it will not be taken up .
Now , my dear , my friend , good-bye for ever in this world .
‘ “ Thirteen children , ” shouted the genius .
‘ She has an immensely strong hold upon them both , <NAME> .
‘ Very true , indeed , <NAME> -- hem -- very true .
But I am not surprised to hear it , I am sure .
Shall I tell you how this is ?
I know the world , and the world knows me .
‘ The man had moved into a sitting posture .
<NAME> ’ t think the worse of me for these tears .
The rooms were sparely furnished , but with good store of books .
‘ Forgive me , pity me , help me !
I should say , mellers it .
‘ That ’ s twopenn ’ orth , sir , ’ replied the waiter .
‘ You did not expect to see me ? ’ said the single gentleman .
'That would n't quite fit , ' replied <NAME> shaking his head .
He drank off two more glasses of wine , one after another .
‘ It is a melancholy pleasure to recall his traits .
but stopped at the first syllable .
you really expect him to come back , do you ? '
<NAME> <NAME> listened with interest and expressed his regret .
But she never was polite unless there was company .
My brother is so unkind , so unreasonable !
<NAME> , he said , required his immediate attendance .
There is no use in going further , so I begin to undress .
I do not understand you .
Back I came again , and waited behind the men that called the carriages .
My spelling may have gone with them .
But let him never come back .
An instance happened before dinner was done .
They make my head ache so .
returns the other , eyeing his companion with a bloodshot eye .
What are you up to ?
‘ “ To please me , love , ” replied the baroness .
'You are on the scent , are you , <NAME> ? '
I do n't know how this was .
I wonder what they thought of me !
He must be found , <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> and his followers rose as one man .
I have seen water like it at the Filter-shops , but nowhere else .
‘ Nothing is the matter ? ’ Thus <NAME> accosted him , rather quickly .
I admit that I was poor ; I had been ill .
He knew it to be his due , but his due was acceptable .
‘ I haven ’ t been here half an hour .
He is tired , and not quite well .
<NAME> believes it , but we do not .
But you ’ re young ! ’ and resumed his narrative .
In rowing costume ? ’ Mortimer looks gloomy , and declines to answer .
I ’ m not to be trampled under-foot by a dustman any more .
I ’ ll tell you what though .
So , by chance , he had found his niche .
<NAME> <NAME> turned sharply round .
'Nothing particular , sir , ' replied <NAME> , colouring up to the eyes .
He is subtle and watchful .
Time flies ; it 's getting on for one o'clock .
<NAME> care of the pigs .
( You liked your bit of game , did n't you ? )
At the appointed time , my three visitors arrived together .
I gave directions for <NAME> to be dismissed .
‘ What do you hear ? ’ asked the lady , altering her phrase .
They have been traced to that place , and there lost sight of .
You ’ ll find the money quite correct , I think .
It might have done me good . '
`` <NAME> , there is nothing to be done .
‘ Coachman , I get down here .
Arrived at the church steps , they were received by a portentous beadle .
‘ Not the ghost of one , ’ replied <NAME> .
‘ Have YOU breakfasted , sir ? ’ inquired Mr Boffin .
‘ A better kept house is not known to our men .
“ I 'd never do it again !
I have made the identical observation to <NAME> .
`` Did she go last night ?
Lately , as I used to be .
oh , cry , here he is !
`` Oh , do pray tell me something of her .
`` <NAME> , '' he said , `` consider my case .
‘ Be quick and short about it .
She ’ s going to stay for a fortnight with Mrs. Grayper .
<NAME> <NAME> does so with deference and holds it open while she passes out .
`` Thank you , <NAME> , '' returned my guardian .
Get a word with the young Thquire .
But after this I ask you nothing .
‘ No , ‘ Tilda , ’ replied <NAME> , shaking her head vehemently .
She is sly and full of malice .
I will not detain you .
Never mind , I ’ ll thwart him -- I , <NAME> .
`` I know wot she 's come for ! ''
exclaimed <NAME> , valiantly , pushing the tinker into the background .
`` I do n't know it , sir . ''
Little <NAME> is treated on several hands .
‘ To think that so little should go for so much !
<NAME> put him down , <NAME> ! ''
With such a snarl at him , that <NAME> absolutely could not bear it .
I am sorry to hear you putting any such extraordinary questions .
It was not she , but a strange servant .
But there was no staving off the question , What was to be done ?
Whatever is wrong in this business is no fault of mine .
It was in the early morning after my arrival that I entertained this speculation .
‘ <NAME> and free ! ’ said <NAME> .
There 's the corner where the <NAME> of <NAME> , sat !
So she is , ’ observed the dwarf .
He may have some deep-seated recondite complaint .
[ ‘ Very happy , <NAME> ! ’ from Mr Lammle . )
We have all our trials , and this is one of yours .
I know what I am .
Do try , <NAME> , do try .
So I promised I would ask you .
The widow rocked herself to and fro , and wrung her hands .
and gone away and left me .
He said that you were not -- ?
I only ask a question .
So did the Jew himself , toasting-fork in hand .
It ’ s a large sum of money .
As true as there is a heaven above us , this is my case .
Esther , my dear , do you wish to ask me anything ? ''
<NAME> had heard the term Queen of <NAME> applied to the <NAME> .
It is of no moment ; not the least .
if I had him here !
Do please to go now , ’ said the dwarf .
So they told him yes .
That 's a very good card .
There 's some of the birds flown from the cages .
They told me , afterwards , that the stones had cut and bruised them .
Let me go by ! ’ ‘ Mama ! ’ said <NAME> .
There ’ s nothing the matter , said Mr <NAME> .
It might be -- any age almost . ''
When we used to have the suppers ?
`` Therefore you kept your visit to yourself last night ? ''
Last night he came again .
‘ How are you , <NAME> ? ’ croaked the dwarf from the coach-top .
‘ Dear Nicholas , pray , ’ urged the young lady .
I can not call him <NAME> , for the name is insupportable to me .
He is very much respected .
And she caught his wrist with both her hands .
Why , she is trembling now !
Might I ask why ? ’ ‘ O !
I am rather his adviser than his proprietor .
She 's coming out of the corner .
<NAME> <NAME> had certainly picked him up at a dart .
It was a little purse : and there was money in it .
But nothing happened so vulgar as play .
In the rouge way ? ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Mr Dorrit , I hear you are going to <NAME> .
Do you kiss it ? ’ chuckled the old woman .
Every pig knows where he lives , much better than anybody could tell him .
Now it attained a height which was sheer wild lunacy .
What came to that girl comes to thousands every year .
‘ If they disturb me , they lose a good tenant .
Once before , and -- ’ ‘ That once , ’ suggested Mr Flintwinch .
She stood behind my chair with her hand upon it .
'Is there no help wanted , but yours and <NAME> 's ? '
That was the question , and nothing else .
The party was admirably selected .
The example is followed by <NAME> and even by Mr Dombey .
`` I think this may be easily arranged , <NAME> ?
‘ Why , I do , ’ said <NAME> .
that turned a young man gray , and <NAME> , dull Care !
Yes , I was at chapel .
‘ No , we have been to a great many places .
<NAME> Bagnet suddenly interposes , `` Plays the fife .
He 'll be very merry and very happy , I have no doubt ! ''
My daughters may know me better ; my aged father may know me better .
And I could not respect your sorrow more , if you were my father .
‘ If I must do it openly , I must , ’ thought Kit .
I enter on it now .
‘ Mivins ! ’ said <NAME> , with a passionate air .
A gentleman ’ s watch with two cases in the old fashion .
They both knew too well what it meant .
‘ You are going that way ? ’ asked the manager .
<NAME> till she comes back ?
‘ Quite so , ’ assented the Doctor -- ‘ and vigorous effort .
'And he shall have it , too ! '
Thus , madame , I am here for the last time .
'But what is this ? -- of whom do you speak ? '
He knew that he idled and moped .
I had been thinking of that too .
‘ Yes , yes , <NAME> ’ l ! ’ said Mrs. Gummidge .
`` I 'm a-watching for my master .
If I feared you , should I not have avoided you ?
Four pigeon-breasted retainers in plain clothes stand in line in the hall .
said the old man with a start .
It seemed to lie before him .
He besought <NAME> not to enrage himself .
'You -- you -- ca n't prove anything against me , ' stammered Monks .
Monks is too much of a gentleman to attempt any violence on porochial persons .
I had been unwilling that he should see my altered looks .
The boy had no friends to care for , or to care for him .
The rude coffin was borne slowly forward on men ’ s shoulders .
This model composition is limited to the three words `` And wishing yours ! ''
`` To all professions , '' observed <NAME> .
‘ Put my hat down , ’ said <NAME> , imperiously .
His nearest way lay through the churchyard .
The subject of it had a peculiar interest for her directly .
He remains in close order , clouded and depressed .
But favours past , <NAME> , is never to be forgot .
<NAME> <NAME> played the melody of one of <NAME> 's favourite songs .
‘ I should have been glad to thank him , ’ returned <NAME> .
“ It would n't do for you , <NAME> .
“ I should have thought -- ” <NAME> began .
I have made some stand against it .
`` It 's hard at my time of life . ''
The journey is nothing to me .
Yet the general character of his countenance was pleasant and agreeable .
It ’ s important we should report progress and compare notes .
‘ A necklace , ’ replied <NAME> .
Mr Merdle is the man of this time .
<NAME> to her , I suppose ?
‘ Mrs <NAME> , ’ said the old woman .
He signs to him with his hand not to go away .
‘ Who is that ? ’ demanded <NAME> , sharply .
<NAME> must have been happy .
<NAME> subjects is best awoided .
‘ He ’ s warm , ’ said <NAME> in the same tone .
‘ They have been gone a week .
Admit it for your factious purposes , and make it worse .
<NAME> assents , with a grateful smile .
Therefore I checked myself , and made my meaning plainer .
‘ Well , well , ’ says <NAME> , ‘ you might do worse .
`` Is it what you people call law-hand ? ''
M. ! ” croaked <NAME> , as he read greedily .
Now I understand all this very well , and so does Mr Headstone .
<NAME> , my God , oh yes ! ''
‘ There ’ s my lodgings , ’ said <NAME> , producing a card .
There was nothing in them but a piece of bread .
‘ That ’ s all I know , ’ said <NAME> .
What ought I to do !
'The crack failed , ' said <NAME> faintly .
She has been looking at the table .
‘ <NAME> ? ’ asked the old woman .
inquired <NAME> , proffering the glass .
It gave him no reply .
‘ Then let him instantly retire , ’ said <NAME> , struggling .
`` What does the horrible creature mean ? ''
`` Can you show me the place as I go back ? ''
`` <NAME> will be here directly .
`` Why do you do it ? ''
It ’ s very interesting , ’ replied <NAME> .
He saw no Little Dorrit on his way down , or in the yard .
I worked early and late , patiently and hard .
Gentlemen , your hands and names .
Let his children have that clue to what he was .
That ’ s my manner of diffusing ‘ em .
On the grounds that I will swear he done it .
`` But the mere truth wo n't do , '' rejoined my guardian .
‘ I allow you , and my will is his law .
Why so ? ” “ That is what you are not to ask me .
said <NAME> , raising his voice .
It must be something unusual indeed to bring him out of his shell .
J. B. ’ s even with you now , <NAME> ’ am .
They are utterly dissimilar in all respects .
‘ I wish to see it jintly with yourself .
I have not quite expressed what I mean .
Having distributed these little specimens of his tact , <NAME> rubs his hands .
‘ Pretty busy , eh ? ’ said the little man .
I wish somebody ’ d take and chop my head off .
“ I have not bestowed my tenderness anywhere .
‘ What ’ s the matter with the boy ? ’ exclaimed <NAME> .
“ Have you recognised him , monsieur ? ” asked <NAME> in a whisper .
‘ “ Keep off ! ” said the baron .
Come to fetch your property , <NAME> ?
<NAME> Leicester is twenty years , full measure , older than my Lady .
The <NAME> would have been content to sit so for a week .
My instructions are , <NAME> , to put this placard on your back .
I deferred to his opinion , though I had great doubts of it myself .
I thought of the oddest things .
Mrs. Crummles rang the bell .
rejoined the man ; and strode hastily , away .
<NAME> , who am here alone , designedly ?
In all his life he has never bred a single butterfly .
She has never reproached you .
He was not excited by it , but he was not excited by anything .
And still it was like the horror of a dream .
A more primitive state of society would be delicious to me .
She was in <NAME> before long , and left him with an infant daughter .
‘ No , don ’ t ! ’ <NAME> caught him by the arm .
Your message reminded me of it again .
He was , indeed , every inch a king .
As he slowly seated himself , he looked at the lady .
<NAME> ’ t let her go , if you please .
Wherefore I perceived that the obligation was upon me to leave this service .
His manner and his look quite terrified them all .
said <NAME> : 'do n't try to make a fool of me . '
No such thing came into my mind , or near it .
The next point was , did <NAME> know the schoolmaster ’ s name ?
Bless you , they grudge me nothing .
I wish I was the electric fluency , ’ muttered the bewildered Grinder .
'Oliver Twist you knew him as , ' replied <NAME> .
There was so much Powder in waiting , that it flavoured the dinner .
This is where the bird lives and sings .
inquired <NAME> , following with his eyes the interesting process of mixing .
`` Upon my soul I wonder at you ! ''
‘ <NAME> Monday do for leaving town ? ’ says Mr Dombey .
‘ You do not ? ’ sneered <NAME> .
'Hard , indeed , ma'am , ' replied the beadle .
'What do you think , then ? '
‘ “ I write in the— ; ” In the what ’ s this ?
'Quite enough for both of us .
The reality is rather different , but by no means to be despised notwithstanding .
He do n't do any good with it .
‘ Stop him , <NAME> ! ’ exclaimed <NAME> earnestly .
For instance , where he found things ?
‘ How goes the enemy , <NAME> ? ’ asked <NAME> .
And young Gay -- Walter -- what of him ?
`` That 's Jo , '' says <NAME> .
Her brother took a book sometimes , but never read it that I saw .
Who seemed fated to work out that doom ?
`` And do you often go out ? ''
It was difficult to doubt her with the father and son before me .
“ I do n't want to know .
The favour is , at least , as unwelcome as it is unexpected .
For again <NAME> saw himself .
There 's a little -- a little something else in it . '
<NAME> day , sir ; good day , <NAME> . ''
He has such ways as I never see .
‘ We must take them by surprise. ’ ‘ Oh , of course !
To him , <NAME> repeated her request .
I can not say what was in my whirling thoughts .
The <NAME> was very fond of music .
`` He sha ' n't know who sends it .
Oh no , it isn ’ t , I remember what it was .
I have already taken occasion to request that it may be corrected .
‘ And your father , your poor father , <NAME> .
Why do you look at me so hard ?
Of such is the salt of the earth .
He set his heart upon it .
I say be happy , too , ’ assented the still pensive Mr Boffin .
I must try what that will do . ''
At last , one day , I meet the <NAME> ’ establishment out walking .
I asked her if that were not our destination ?
‘ I thought you would be .
He is a very good speaker .
You didn ’ t tell it right when you were sitting there .
As they find the fact , they will judge me .
Some time in the night , while this young fellow snored—Mrs .
‘ I was , ’ said <NAME> .
“ Hold ! ” said <NAME> the <NAME> .
The coroner frequents more public-houses than any man alive .
There were two ladies there ; and <NAME> stopped .
Then the chin dropped musingly upon the hand again .
Her eyes were liable to a similar affection .
He laughed , with a nod towards <NAME> .
My Lady is so high , so very high .
What 'll he do with it ?
Keep up a good heart , pretty .
But it did one piece of good .
‘ Reproach me , sir , or I ’ ll do myself an injury .
They turned into the passage , and my uncle followed .
Never breathe a word of such destructive nonsense any more .
They talk to me of my penitence .
‘ He knows nothing of what has happened , ’ he whispered .
As it was -- As it was , the rain fell heavily , drearily .
Lived universally respected , and died lamented .
‘ No , ’ replied <NAME> , interrupting him .
<NAME> <NAME> , my eyes are opened to you all at once .
‘ It was <NAME> , and <NAME> only. ’ I nodded assent .
'Swear the man , ' growled <NAME> , with a very ill grace .
‘ I think it is , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
We return to town to-morrow. ’ ‘ To-morrow ! ’ exclaimed his admiring followers .
On the whole , I resolved to leave the <NAME> behind .
She had no time to lose , but must get ready at once .
We got aboard easily , and rowed out into the track of the steamer .
‘ I entreat you to be quiet , <NAME> , ’ said the other .
‘ I am very sorry , sir , ’ said <NAME> , humbly .
‘ You are as young as I am. ’ <NAME> gravely shook her head .
The magistrate opens his court at five in the morning .
Perhaps he did not even know that she was in the house .
Mrs <NAME> began to wonder how long the master-mind meant to stay .
Supposing he had been strangled .
‘ No , no , I won ’ t have your help .
How you start ! ” She did , indeed , start .
’ Deed we are in a muddle , sir .
‘ Good-night , dear heart , ’ said <NAME> to her at her chamber-door .
But look around you at this place .
We have done all we undertook to do for Mr Clennam .
How do I know what injury you have done my horses .
I forgot ; your eyes are rather red .
‘ I ’ ll tell you the whole truth. ’ Newman did so .
It was the fat boy ’ s .
Is it the <NAME> of the Law ?
Not to mention that you are always welcome. ’ ‘ Thank you .
Shut the door. ’ With his former action the old man obeyed .
I can hardly believe that .
<NAME> smiled , and said they ’ d try .
‘ How can I tell , <NAME> ! ’ answered <NAME> .
A nod for each shilling .
You may wring his neck if you please .
Oh , tell me I may sponge away the writing on this stone ! ''
is alive , and will return .
I am ashamed to have been betrayed into this warmth of feeling .
Say you ’ re quite well and never better .
Mr <NAME> had never been quite so radiant since the marriage as before .
This is what his learning has brought him to .
‘ What now ? ’ said <NAME> , soothing him .
I really don ’ t know what to say .
Most willingly , said the little woman .
Ve-ry friendly little party , are we not ? ''
You have no idea how many people want to be left alone .
No one but your old servant .
Scarcely one is to be encountered in the deserted region of <NAME> .
<NAME> , morning , morning ! ’ And so departed , without looking back .
Indeed , <NAME> expressly said so to me , and so did <NAME> .
We might live very comfortably together now , <NAME> , eh ?
‘ A very agreeable change , indeed , ’ returned my mother .
But little cared Kit for weather .
It is not a Preparatory School by any means .
says <NAME> with folded arms .
<NAME> , my dear sir , you will make one .
I hope she may be .
`` Oh , dear no , miss , '' he said .
Now who was <NAME> , we all thought .
In a thick crowd of sounds , but still intelligibly enough to be understood .
You mustn ’ t be cast down , <NAME> .
They went to the closed gate , and peeped through into the court-yard .
They began with the practice of an attorney and they ended with it .
The last four-and-twenty hours had produced a frightful alteration .
He eats without appetite , and soon goes forth again .
This demonstration was not lost upon <NAME> .
It was all you , miss . ''
`` I do n't think I have , '' said <NAME> .
As though a lunatic should trust in the world 's `` coming '' triangular !
But I have heard him constantly .
You packed him off , yourself .
‘ I was going to say -- but you put me out .
The fish were small and bony , and the potatoes were a little burnt .
`` It began in your coming to our house , '' she said .
‘ Four year just turned , sir , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Swear the gentleman , ’ said the judge peremptorily .
‘ <NAME> , hush , don ’ t cry , <NAME> .
Have you heard of her good fortune ? ''
She loved him dearly , and he knew it , and I knew it .
‘ It opened out so naturally before me , ’ said <NAME> .
No , I think I ’ ll be pulled through by <NAME> .
`` You ask me what is this to you , <NAME> .
`` Why have you come here now ? ''
And he could not forget it , now .
The nearer the place , the better .
He says it was not his fault .
Of a certainty they will do it .
Barsad. ” “ <NAME> ? ” repeated the old gentleman , “ <NAME> ?
I am very , very glad . '
<NAME> pervaded it throughout , but never appeared in it .
He is the best cricketer you ever saw .
'Pay attention to the reply , constable , will you ? '
<NAME> <NAME> received him kindly , and so did <NAME> .
It ’ s another sort from <NAME> .
What place is this , to which the squalid street conducts us ?
‘ Here he is , ’ growled <NAME> , ‘ and somebody with him .
I had better not go .
said <NAME> , summoning up all his native dignity .
‘ How can we face the <NAME> ? ’ cried Mrs. Nupkins .
‘ Can you eat a bit ? ’ ‘ No thank you , <NAME> .
The subject was a German who kept a liquor-shop and was an inveterate drunkard .
<NAME> <NAME> makes another spring .
<NAME> suspicion hides in that peaceful region .
‘ No , <NAME> , none , ’ said <NAME> .
Would they have confidence in her ?
‘ Only to start the game , ’ replied <NAME> , laughing .
She had had one husband .
‘ I don ’ t think I have , ’ said <NAME> , archly .
<NAME> saw it too , I think , for she shrank from him .
But perhaps you bring <NAME> , eh ?
I showed her there was one to help her , and it was I .
`` Because , '' said <NAME> , `` a little thing affects them .
' I 've thought of it all , ' said the Jew with energy .
We should grow proud on such neighbours !
‘ My landlord has a daughter named <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> is with my Lady and is happy to see <NAME> .
“ I do n't know , ” I moodily answered .
I ’ ll scream Fire and <NAME> !
I would give the world to go to sleep .
You are qualified for many good things .
<NAME> stopped , and peeped into the garden .
Fourteen women ; I wish you could ha ’ heard ‘ em , <NAME> .
The second tumbril empties and moves on ; the third comes up .
Did he leave them here ?
In a public-house kitchen with a large fire .
A small body of electors remained unpolled on the very last day .
There is nothing mercenary in that with him .
Releasing his arm , she laid her hand upon his shoulder .
‘ Do you know me , you old madman ? ’ asked <NAME> .
‘ It is nearly time for tea .
There 's <NAME> , and there 's <NAME> , and there 's you .
'Why did n't you come in afore ? '
‘ I have no doubt you know it very well .
‘ How sound she sleeps ! ’ said <NAME> .
Why , you went into the <NAME> .
`` No , '' he says , `` there 's none in that hand .
It was a town on the <NAME> .
Not to the coroner , though it might appear so .
Give us some water for him ; he has run himself faint . '
He read it through half-a-dozen times .
It 's such uphill work , and it takes such a time ! ''
‘ It was among the varieties .
`` Pray what has been done to-day ? ''
‘ I don ’ t mean that , <NAME> .
`` This is the even-handed dealing of the world ! ''
‘ Ha , I am _not_ tired .
Again <NAME> shook his head .
I wish in business to be exact and open .
`` <NAME> <NAME> is present ? ''
‘ ’ Twould be of no use , my dear , no earthly use .
‘ You pay yourself by defrauding her .
<NAME> when you ’ re called upon to answer .
The solitary young lady all this time had said no more .
'About the crib at <NAME> , <NAME> ? '
‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , turning over some leaves of the ledger .
How , with some such look , he would counsel and cherish his daughter .
When night comes , there stands the phantom in the corner .
‘ Indeed they often help it .
<NAME> Leicester is devoted to you almost to infatuation .
I ca n't hold myself still .
The proprietor , in a low voice , bade <NAME> good-day .
He begins to revive almost as soon as it passes his lips .
said the impetuous doctor , when they had rejoined the two ladies .
I will tell her what you say .
‘ What the devil ! ’ cried <NAME> , drawing back .
`` With a couple of sticks .
He had gold and silver , diamonds and rubies , riches of every kind .
He stepped back a pace or two .
My solicitor will be here presently to protect the property .
But I know it , and what then !
`` I am astonished at it . ''
<NAME> , business ! ” They went up slowly and softly .
It was deposited on every lip , and carried into every ear .
‘ Now , stop a bit ! ’ cried <NAME> again .
We shall come to it presently .
P. <NAME> , ’ he cried faintly .
‘ I make it mine ; I will make it mine .
You have no idea what obstinate hair mine is , <NAME> .
‘ You should have joined us last night , ’ said <NAME> .
ten thousand times ! ’ cried <NAME> .
‘ You ’ re very good , ’ said <NAME> .
said <NAME> , putting down his wine-glass , and clinking the handcuffs together .
with him , on the strength of that assistance .
These are late hours for working and thinking .
`` We are doing very well , '' pursued <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> will be with Mrs Finching this morning .
Go on , my dear Sir , in your Eagle course !
Will you come down ? ’ said <NAME> fiercely .
‘ Permit me , ’ Mrs <NAME> interposed , with outstretched glove .
`` I see him at his worst every day .
You may get to bed now , ’ said <NAME> , with a grin .
`` I do n't know yet , '' said <NAME> in the same tone .
“ You thinks <NAME> , <NAME> ? ” said the landlord .
Fevers are not peculiar to good people ; are they ?
This was a hard thing to bear , but this was nothing .
<NAME> , standing over him with his hand in his breast , looked down .
Mrs <NAME> was herself , and that did not improve him .
‘ But he is a man of family , ’ he added .
Why was he rejoiced beyond all bounds to see them !
No , thank you ! ’ <NAME> inquire <NAME> was suspected ?
<NAME> , he 's wonderfully like you !
All is lost ! ” cried she , wringing her hands .
I am so far literal and exact ?
You know it taints everybody .
Here is a solitary swine lounging homeward by himself .
The workhouse authorities replied with humility , that there was not .
I and two paupers , Mrs. Mann !
There are no medicines to be obtained in this lonely place . '
We then turned back towards my chambers .
‘ What did I say to them at home ?
‘ A few hours , sir , ’ he returned in a sudden passion .
The light softened , <NAME> brought her chair closer to his side .
The driver stopped beside me , and my aunt was sitting in it alone .
My dear niece , ’ he repeated steadily .
But you teach me my duty , notwithstanding .
'Think it 's the same boy , Stupid-head ? '
There was dignity in the bars and stones of that place .
Is he here ? ” “ I am here ! ” I cried .
I don ’ t know the time that makes much difference to us .
No , Mr <NAME> did not .
Squeers entered at the moment , and he shrunk back into his old corner .
Just as well and more , my pretty poppet .
And as to feeling sleepy !
That appeared to be the last thing about which they had anything to say .
His words had given me a start .
‘ I will go straight to <NAME> ’ s , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ The consideration evinces your delicacy of feeling .
I looked up , quickly ; being curious to know .
‘ Hoo-roar Pott ! ’ shouted the populace .
I will outlive this danger , and outdie it , if I can .
‘ Bless my soul , ’ cried the astonished <NAME> ; ‘ Mrs .
He surely might become so , with a wife like her .
I was told nothing more .
`` Why , sir , '' returns the trooper .
<NAME> ! ’ With a twirl of the nut-crackers at the portrait .
But what a capital world it is ! ’ cried <NAME> with warm enthusiasm .
My guardian knew where we were going and therefore was not with us .
have I set the house a-fire ?
It ’ s an old-fashioned notion , I daresay .
Yes , I will ! ’ returned the <NAME> .
‘ What do you think of him ? ’ said my aunt .
“ She 's such a manager of fowls , you have no idea .
<NAME> <NAME> mostly lives abroad , Mr Clennam .
You need n't get up ; I 'll sit down by you .
He was so soon left behind .
External heat and cold had little influence on <NAME> .
He subdued it , took up the candle , and examined the room .
The man started , and turned round upon the Jew .
‘ My dear girl , my old friend !
Your mistake in life is , that you do not look forward far enough .
His nephew lies asleep , calm and untroubled .
The deed of settlement he had executed on their marriage , and a letter .
YOU will not ? ’ repeated <NAME> , solemnly .
I wish you good night. ’ ‘ Good night ! ’ said <NAME> .
She occupied her old seat , but there was a vacant one beside her .
`` God bless us every one ! ''
May you be happy in the life you have chosen ! ''
‘ Not to remember ! ’ Here was a coincidence !
‘ How are you , <NAME> ? ’ said <NAME> carelessly .
If they do n't stop , why should I ?
And then I said my prayers and thought a little more .
Oh , it is a long time ! ''
I am far from being so well informed as you suppose me to be .
<NAME> <NAME> went down with <NAME> ’ s aunt .
‘ You recollect this young fellow , <NAME> ? ’ said <NAME> .
‘ For six mortal weeks , the bears and boars had a holiday .
Then she cried out , ‘ Oh , <NAME> , may you be happy !
“ <NAME> ; and a little bit of him .
'Now , ' said <NAME> , 'what 's the charge against this boy ?
She ’ s gone , and well got rid of .
Mrs. Mann shook her head .
Why , <NAME> bless your soul , what times we have had together !
He had waited but a short time when Mr <NAME> appeared .
She must have been at work from her cradle .
‘ You ’ re all abroad , seemingly , ’ returned the other man .
‘ Does he know that he is dead ? ’ asked <NAME> .
As he says it , <NAME> leaves off sketching , and looks at him .
I know she has , ’ he rejoined .
The other cousins soon disperse , to the last cousin there .
‘ I have heard you with shame , ’ said <NAME> .
But you know we ’ re so very umble , ’ he returned .
To see the lighting of the haughty brow !
It ’ s na ’ but a Poast Office !
It might seem as if costs were my object .
They will never punish the girl .
Not that it matters at all. ’ Mary <NAME> again hailed .
`` I mean to try hard , '' she answers , wiping her eyes .
Why do you ask me ? ’ ‘ Why , for this reason .
The length of an arm is not much .
At last he got away , and shaped his course for <NAME> .
‘ I will not occupy any salon .
I have not nearly made up my mind , but it may be .
He ca n't be in sight , ” said <NAME> .
She thought of that , too .
Did she grace his life -- or <NAME> ’ s ?
My young friends are the wards in <NAME> . ''
“ As to anything I say , you know , ” he insisted .
Some were lamenting , and in restless motion ; but , these were few .
There was nothing to attract attention , or excite alarm in this .
But do n't catch hold of me .
I rose long before my usual time next morning to finish it .
<NAME> to the <NAME> ’ s credit ?
`` Very honourable , I am sure .
What I have to do as the confidential agent of another , I do .
<NAME> to see you well again .
In his affable unconsciousness , however , he took no heed .
<NAME> at that paper you hold in your hand .
I could not think of letting you have it on any other terms .
I have been shrieked at through the streets .
<NAME> said ‘ Exactly so , ’ and became pretty red in the face .
‘ Why not , <NAME> ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
Her shawl looked particularly like a tea-leaf after long infusion .
“ Be a brave man , my Gaspard !
`` It 's about -- '' said <NAME> in a whisper .
‘ Of course they will , ’ replied <NAME> indignantly .
' I 'll never lie down again alive ! '
We passed not far from the house a few minutes afterwards .
My pretty , little , startled <NAME> !
‘ Very much , ’ said the <NAME> .
Felt them in the air .
This accumulated testimony effectually staggered <NAME> .
Awaking suddenly , he listened , started up , and sat listening .
That ’ s the way the song runs , isn ’ t it ?
Perspective I proceed to other passages of my narrative .
I have been away to fetch it .
‘ Who is she ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
It is not here , it is not there .
‘ What a weary girl ! ’ said I .
‘ Is she in want of employment also ? ’ said <NAME> .
It has almost the effect of drink upon me .
‘ You know I am not , sir , ’ replied Mrs. Nickleby .
And particularly every Sunday night .
`` Most thoroughly , '' said I with my whole heart .
This morose person lent them , and we wore them out .
`` In that case you will send me to the prison , perhaps ? ''
Am I addressing <NAME> ? ” I signified that he was addressing <NAME> .
It dropped at the wrist , as if it were broken .
'No , ' replied the voice ; 'God forbid . '
She was singing in a low tone .
And I went softly into the room .
‘ Really I begin to think things are very well as they are .
‘ I am glad to see you , sir .
By that murder me and <NAME> mysteriously profit .
I was turned over by other feet .
But that comes right , sir .
At the appointed time in the evening , <NAME> reappeared .
<NAME> <NAME> lifts his hat and returns to his little woman and his tea .
‘ It is given to you , and is obtained by you .
`` You sha n't say you do n't .
You do put me in such a state -- into such fits of crying !
The <NAME> laughs and dribbles at the mouth .
'Nothing could save him , ' cried the girl .
But he is checked by his sweet mistress .
There was the usual aspect of newness on every object , of course .
`` Is it <NAME> that 's wanted ? ''
I besought her to look up .
Going Away 3 The Passage out 10 An <NAME> .
‘ God bless you , sir , ’ he said in passing .
Now , go to your room .
Ai n't there nobody here but you , Mr .
For any reliable information I receive , I will pay .
‘ Widders are ‘ ceptions to ev ’ ry rule .
“ Ah , ” said he , shaking his head gravely .
Wait a moment , and I ’ ll go on with the lecture .
And so the amiable couple parted .
Then my sister was drawn .
It looks more respectable , my dear . '
I never could have got here without her !
Why repeat it a thousand times ?
And how dearly he loved her now , what words can tell !
But Mrs. Guppy positively refused to come out of the gangway .
That ’ s what I ’ ve always said .
‘ What does the idiot mean ? ’ cried <NAME> , testily .
Neither were they connected with fear : he was conscious of no fear .
'Is n't there any help for it ? '
And are human labourers to have no holidays , because of the bees ?
Of having a deadly quarrel with the whole world , but chiefly with himself .
‘ We expect her today , ’ replied <NAME> .
Where would be the good of Mrs Boffin and me quarrelling over it ?
Now , prepare to come with me , dear girl .
I beg to hand to my friend <NAME> my I.O.U .
`` Why , do you know how pretty you are , child ? ''
‘ Are you the landlord ? ’ inquired the gentleman .
‘ <NAME> ’ , <NAME> ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
I really am in want of a friend , I am .
‘ I would rather not. ’ Had he any personal objection to Mr Lightwood ?
I used to fear that I was so unsuited to your learning and wisdom .
Whenever the old girl says , I 'LL do it .
‘ You must not be ruled by my suspicions .
We return to <NAME> to-morrow .
Among the men , not one .
I ’ ll tell you what , ’ said <NAME> .
That ’ s the watchword down the <NAME> .
but the <NAME> , being aware of him , has dexterously vanished .
See how bright these stones shine ! ’ opening the case .
He is a gentleman of high honour and integrity .
<NAME> has nothing to do with the declaration , for his admiration worried me .
If I am older , it is not above a year or two .
<NAME> nothing to me , sir .
Say no more , sir , not a word more .
<NAME> ! ’ coughed Mr Wegg to attract his employer ’ s attention .
He was wery quick about it .
‘ It occurred in <NAME> ’ s <NAME> .
That was fortunate ; Mr Merdle would take him into the <NAME> .
‘ I observed it once before , when I was in this town .
‘ It ’ s so dreadful in families .
Again he falls upon his bed , and lies there , moaning .
The year was out , and the great <NAME> was down .
My guardian now came every day .
<NAME> , good morning , sir . ''
I give him my hand , which he holds in his .
The man drew a deep sigh .
‘ They ’ ll be of much more use to you than me .
'Pockets , women 's ridicules , houses , mail-coaches , banks ! '
are you mad ? ’ ‘ Are you ?
It 's near ten , and nothing done yet . '
Here , <NAME> , dear. ’ ‘ Well , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Now , <NAME> , ’ said Mr Dombey , exultingly .
<NAME> ’ t leave a stone unturned .
Thank you a thousand times !
She was a lady of a haughty temper .
She had seldom been there since her marriage .
What else did you expect ? ’ ‘ <NAME> to me !
the constable observes to the audience .
‘ Selfish brutes ! ’ said the girl , sobbing and heaving between whiles .
‘ No , thank you , ’ said Mr Merdle .
<NAME> had raised himself on his elbow to look into the darkness after him .
‘ <NAME> ’ t go , <NAME> , if you please .
Is it honouring your husband to dishonour his business ?
‘ Where did they go to first was it ?
It ’ s -- it ’ s of no consequence , thank you .
The men 's consent I bought , but her help was freely given .
‘ I am disgraced enough , my Little Dorrit .
Indeed it is so plain and obvious that it could hardly be otherwise .
Let me think what I have achieved .
“ <NAME> ? ” asked <NAME> , inquisitively raising her dark eyebrows .
the waters had been his death .
I ’ ve been in a dream for ever so long .
That 's real enough. ” “ It 's very massive , ” said I .
I shall have you yet ! '
while there ’ s time to retreat .
I went to be henceforward lost .
I cried about it from breakfast till dinner .
Renewed reference to young Gazelle .
‘ What you say , my dear <NAME> , is perfectly reasonable .
<NAME> -- ’ ‘ God bless him ! ’ cried <NAME> .
Releasing his again after a time , the sick boy laid him gently down .
What have you got to say , sir ? '
Can you do without rest and keep watch upon her night and day ?
Not to make too much of them .
‘ I dreamed it , first of all my dreams .
These three rooms opened upon one another .
‘ The <NAME> , by <NAME> .
`` He did at first , sir , but not afterwards .
‘ Oh dear , no , sir ! ’ I replied , most decisively .
The former held a light in his hand .
‘ I shan ’ t be wery long avay , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ How dare you come here , you hussy ?
He had alluded to the honourable gentleman .
Look to yourself ! ’ she said , and smiled again .
<NAME> put a few necessaries in a carpet-bag , and was ready for starting .
<NAME> de la <NAME> ; Who passes by this road so late ?
At length , by slow degrees , they became indistinct and mingled .
The stranger filled , and emptied .
His arm lay on it now .
Mrs. <NAME> was sitting there .
‘ Waiter , ’ said the gentleman with the whiskers .
Standing hard by the building was a plain hearse .
You ’ ll hire that of me , I suppose ?
Not I , <NAME> , trust me .
I speak , of course , merely of wealth , <NAME> .
You may not know it .
<NAME> knows I write this , in no spirit of self-laudation .
‘ At home ? ’ ‘ At home , ’ said Mr Dombey .
He would have seen me if I had .
`` Yes , sir , '' returns one of the women .
But your mother mentioned that you had been suspecting your father .
‘ Eh ? ’ said <NAME> , starting from his seat .
‘ If I grow up , ’ said <NAME> .
Then , a consequence ensued which <NAME> had too well foreseen .
I never asked to go at once , <NAME> .
However , I did not trouble <NAME> with these particulars .
‘ There was no time to make it longer .
I then found that <NAME> was the clerk in the next room .
Mr Nickleby against all the world .
The woman is discharged and paid .
The solemn stillness was no marvel now .
‘ Suppose then , ’ said Mr Dombey , ‘ we say from here .
Toast his cheese with 'em and then come back for more .
‘ I beg to wish you good day , <NAME> .
Not that it meant anything , but that <NAME> seemed to like it .
‘ <NAME> , ’ said that versatile gentleman , taking the hint at once .
It seemed like quiet music for the repose of the dead .
Neither could they do anything without <NAME> .
'No doubt at all of that , my dear . '
who ever heard o ’ the loike o ’ that noo !
‘ Was-it-Ev-verajail ? ’ asked Mr Wegg , holding on .
cried my guardian , quite astonished .
said the <NAME> , turning over more leaves .
I have <NAME> for my partner .
Is anybody in attendance who knows anything more ? ''
I wish I had died .
She were in poor elth , and quite broke .
If my advice had been asked , I should not have been here .
I hope I cherish no other. ’ ‘ For yourself , ’ he said .
‘ Was father ever there ? ’ ‘ Hem ! ’ coughed the turnkey .
But with all my heart , I wish it was so . ''
I have no objections , I ’ m sure .
cried <NAME> , looking up for an instant .
What are yer made for ? '
If he went before , he looked back .
‘ I am very glad to hear it .
Never more eminently , he added , than after what had passed .
`` By no means , my Lady .
‘ And did you know it , <NAME> ?
Mind me ! ’ The daughter looked at her for an explanation .
‘ Is <NAME> your county , sir ? ’ asked <NAME> .
'Yes , yes , ' said the undertaker , 'of course .
Though <NAME> seemed to like it .
Evidently <NAME> had taught <NAME> to write .
Give me a little more wine. ’ <NAME> complied .
asked <NAME> in a low voice .
“ Here 's a couple of pair of gloves !
cried <NAME> with fervour ; `` I could walk it blindfold . ''
At last , an answer came from the two old ladies .
I was so sickly , that I was always moaning and groaning .
He put up his hand as if to stop me .
<NAME> has it come to this !
‘ You ’ re the new boy ? ’ he said .
‘ You ’ re a nice lawyer , an ’ t you ?
Therefore , my friends , peace be with us !
What should you be out of spirits for ?
Not wonderful , for there <NAME> none in his hollow empty heart .
And the next great pleasure of your existence is to keep low company .
But now about this other matter .
The Opening of the <NAME> of Mrs Chick 30 .
I hate to come to this place without <NAME> .
`` I think he would , my dear friend .
`` Do , for <NAME> 's sake , pull my hat forward . ''
‘ Yes , indeed ! ’ replied the fat boy , with unwonted vivacity .
I am not very ill indeed .
Nothing but the strength of his purpose enables him to make it .
interposed <NAME> ; 'he do n't know what you mean . '
The young gentlemen were prematurely full of carking anxieties .
cries Mrs. Bagnet , something shrilly .
Oh yes , to be sure .
`` And how is your mama , <NAME> ? ''
I ’ ll state the fact of it to you .
I wish you could make a friend of me , <NAME> .
You can call for what you like if you want anything .
`` I know of nothing I can do .
In this , no time was to be lost .
Her face was ever frowning , attentive , and settled .
<NAME> qualities out of them .
To whom , with deference , they presented themselves .
And what will you take next ?
inquired the driver : seeing that <NAME> was out of breath .
That will be fair on both sides .
You ’ re come out of the country , I suppose .
`` But how do you make it out ? ''
`` Who do you suppose would teach you wrong ? ''
Plashwater Weir <NAME> looked tranquil and pretty on an evening in the summer time .
There ’ s a compound fracture above the knee , and a dislocation below .
`` You wo n't have a lawyer ? ''
I saw him steal a glance at her , and slightly smile to himself .
That 's the tragedy for you . ''
he cries , and strikes his iron candlestick against the door .
If you ’ re a man , control your limbs , sir !
`` You were found in a doorway , were n't you ? ''
What is your own experience of him ?
The fat boy shook his head .
<NAME> here by yourself and see how YOU like it . ''
<NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> of St <NAME> .
Mrs. <NAME> appeared to be a long way off .
But her innocent imagination was too full of one theme to admit them .
‘ I will not , sir , ’ rejoined <NAME> .
‘ The stomach is the primary cause. ’ ‘ Mr .
<NAME> had thought he might have been employed .
I don ’ t know what ’ s the matter with me .
‘ No , sir , ’ replied the <NAME> , ‘ but expected .
says <NAME> with a plain appearance of exasperation .
‘ Surely not , ’ returned the dwarf .
I must get the better of this before bed-time .
I hope they will ever remain so .
I will help you well , and with a good will .
And there ’ s another hour good yet !
I can remember nothing that I know , without remembering him .
Mrs. Nickleby , after stopping a little for consideration , resumed .
I have come out in another way .
If no such gentleman were there , he begged pardon for being mistaken .
He is more than an artist : he is highly connected .
‘ Yes , yes , pray ! ’ cried <NAME> .
I don ’ t say that I have any particular penetration in such matters .
<NAME> <NAME> ’ s mode of proceeding was professional , but peculiar .
‘ <NAME> , fellow jail-bird ! ’ said he .
I will not shut out the lessons that they teach .
At the same time his brother withdrew nearer to the door .
Hold your noise , little <NAME> .
‘ He goes on , up the river , at six in the morning .
No , Mr Dombey , let us understand each other .
Otherwise , all will go ill. That 's the end of my preaching .
My dear Copperfield , how very much you have improved !
His face brightened up , and he began to feel quite convivial .
<NAME> <NAME> ’ s brother had thrown a bottle at <NAME> .
Oh , my eye , what a game !
‘ I hope I always was .
`` Let me see , '' said <NAME> , looking at his watch .
We shouldn ’ t be together , if you were not .
'They do not , ' replied <NAME> , colouring deeply .
To which he replied , “ Ah !
`` Ca n't you make them hear ?
’ Tis kep ’ down that way .
‘ I didn ’ t know that you were suffering from a complaint .
I don ’ t deserve to be so treated .
I am going to take young Tom into my office .
The day dragged on uncomfortably enough .
he said , sitting down and wiping his face .
I hope you are pretty well ? ''
poor indeed ! ’ rejoined Mrs. Nickleby .
‘ <NAME> , my boy , ’ returned his uncle .
‘ I am her father , am I not ?
`` How do you know that , sir ? ''
`` How do you do , Mr .
In the ordinary acceptation of such language , it should have been a blow .
‘ No , ’ said <NAME> shortly and decisively .
`` <NAME> , '' returns the angry client .
'Then why do n't you send this new cove ? '
I wish not to misapprehend you . ''
‘ Yes , <NAME> , ’ she replead meekly .
And do n't he hate other dogs as ai n't of his breed !
They had all dropped off .
As it drove up , we saw that there were two people inside .
`` Am I to read this ? ''
‘ Oh , pa ! ’ remonstrated <NAME> .
‘ Prove it , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> warmly .
Twice five ; will that do ?
This is the right course of a true man , <NAME> .
All sorts of horrors were supposed .
‘ The dog whose name ’ s called , eats .
I couldn ’ t wish to see a sweeter .
I have been tired a long time , ’ said <NAME> .
After some calling , <NAME> was discovered .
I recollect a few chilled people passing in the streets .
Because you have known perfectly that I was en-r-r-r-raged ! ''
‘ Oh Lord , yes ! ’ moaned <NAME> , rocking himself .
'Did she drink the hot wine the doctor said she was to have ? '
There was a general moralising upon Pressure , in every street .
`` I shall make the order .
‘ Oh , he ’ s the artfullest creetur ! ’ cried <NAME> .
`` Devil a bit , '' returned the first man .
I am sure I wish it could be so .
Show the gentleman in , <NAME> ; wake up first , if convenient . '
The dear , sympathetic old fellow likes to keep us in sight .
No extras , no vacations , and diet unparalleled .
‘ Well , what is the matter ? ’ said <NAME> .
The little boy had spoken of him , almost at the last .
Still , he said he would , all the same .
‘ I ’ m glad to find <NAME> knows of it .
Mr <NAME> thought it possible .
There ’ s ruin in store for you .
Such things were to be .
“ Now , I return to this young fellow .
A little before dusk , my orders are .
But the folly is committed on both sides .
‘ <NAME> , <NAME> , with best wishes , ’ said <NAME> .
Now , pray observe what I am about to say .
They are as correct , ’ returned Mr Riderhood , ‘ as I am .
inquired Fagin , shrugging his shoulders .
I do n't like his trade the better for that .
I am playful ; playfulness is a part of my amiable character .
'Do you think I do n't know what 's good for you ?
These objects lie directly within his range .
Sometimes brighter visions rise before me .
Of what ? ’ asked the astonished father .
No doubt I am hurt .
He knew no more , for the <NAME> neither spoke nor moved .
“ <NAME> , brother ! ” cried <NAME> , bursting into tears .
To be sure it was !
whispered <NAME> , rubbing his hands , and splitting with a laugh .
She will do very well .
‘ And the pigs ? ’ said <NAME> .
But my plans are made .
Only the fair little man ? ’ said her father .
We have been silent , and there is a smile upon her face .
There has been only one child in the <NAME> family for several generations .
'Do you see that old cove at the book-stall ? '
<NAME> don ’ t say that , <NAME> , ’ interposed <NAME> , angrily .
‘ It is for whom you will , ’ she answered .
Let me show you a light .
'Hush , my dear , ' said the old lady softly .
said <NAME> , glancing from the other gentleman to the one who had spoken .
There ’ s no love between us .
<NAME> appeared , handed it in , and disappeared .
`` And how did you reassure him , <NAME> ? ''
I knew nothing of him .
I am a marked and disgraced man , and here I am .
I have seen it many times .
‘ <NAME> , <NAME> ! ’ repeated <NAME> .
‘ Just as well , ’ replied <NAME> .
'And no news of <NAME> ? '
Just to show you , <NAME> , that I have always stood your friend .
But <NAME> has a way of stating his objections which often deceives people .
To him they brought despair .
Since then , you have seen my sister often .
Upon that he speaks , as if she had spoken .
It was indeed a glad hearing to him , he replied .
'What time to-morrow shall we say ? '
I inquired about my aunt among the boatmen first , and received various answers .
`` So I was right , you see ! ''
Suppose I say to a man , how much ?
‘ Her heart -- is given him , with all its love and truth .
`` Remarkable assemblies those , <NAME> , '' said <NAME> reverentially .
But they were very decently kept .
“ Do n't tell Her of this interview , or this arrangement .
You have not taught me quite in vain .
‘ I mean the gentleman named Traddles. ’ ‘ Oh !
But your slave is politic .
‘ That ’ s it , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> , stay here a moment .
'Nothing , sir , ' replied the child faintly .
'Did n't know I was here ! '
No , he knew he was too safe .
<NAME> him any such things of me ; they will all be true .
<NAME> , was that you calling me ?
There the boy remained , with a palpitating heart , for half an hour .
If she had been a woman she would have died long ago .
‘ It ’ s a little inconvenient , ’ said the man .
However , we need say no more about that .
“ Might a mere warmint ask what property ? ” said he .
‘ <NAME> , then -- ’ coolly observed <NAME> , stopping her outright .
‘ Here , waither , ’ said <NAME> , briskly .
‘ <NAME> important -- very important , my dear Sir , ’ replied <NAME> .
That was well done to tie a bunch of grass upon his back .
They gathered to a crisis .
I had a double-caped great-coat on , and over my arm another thick coat .
How does our service sound to you ? ’ ‘ Beautiful !
And there is your father at the door ! ''
It ’ s not such an enormous distance .
My former acquaintance , the carrier , was at the door .
Do n't mention it to our diminutive friend when she comes in .
He pauses , but she makes no reply .
‘ Little humbugs , ’ replied <NAME> , deeply affected .
Likewise you 've been very often there .
The man thought he was dreaming , but he was n't .
<NAME> was the labour ; priceless the reward .
‘ Anything more ? ’ ‘ Yes , sir , yes , sir .
In agony , in sorrow , in remorse , in despair !
Sometimes , at long intervals and on rare occasions , I saw her .
`` I know , I know , my darling . ''
'That is no excuse , ' replied <NAME> .
And your wife another , I ’ ll lay a crown .
' I never saw him in all my life , ' said <NAME> .
`` The <NAME> , sir , whose story I have heard ? ''
It 's the mace and seal upon the table . ''
It certainly was , for there was quite enough water in it already .
`` But fen larks , you know .
‘ I can anticipate all you would say .
A very merry party they had been .
“ These are two celebrated ones .
It is an annuity of two hundred and fifty pounds .
‘ What ’ s the matter , <NAME> ? ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> Leicester is generally in a complacent state , and rarely bored .
He was anxious to see if she had relapsed since the previous evening .
I will watch over you .
That there blue water as she used to speak on .
<NAME> <NAME> stops at home now , ’ rejoined <NAME> .
He was lying dead upon the stone .
<NAME> number one , said they must take everything on trust .
<NAME> of justice , were these things to last !
'Who pitched that 'ere at me ?
`` Oh , hollow from the beginning .
They could have better spared a newer-fashioned child , and that alone was much .
`` What are you doing here ? ''
'He has been pretty well everywhere else .
I am pretty sure it ought to be .
You ’ re like my own son , <NAME> ! ’ ‘ Oh !
You will be sure to hear when the jury come in .
You have to do with me .
Probably had been upon some little game .
‘ Why not do ? ’ retorted Peg .
Their places are a blank .
“ Would n't say it to anybody but yourself , ” he answered .
Allow me to ask your pardon .
‘ Pray is Mr <NAME> here ?
'Let it be strong and hot .
I must ask you that -- I must indeed , <NAME> .
‘ My life with this lady has been very happy .
‘ Oh yes , ’ rejoined Mrs. Browdie .
My duty is to my country and the People .
‘ What ’ s that in <NAME> ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
‘ I wish it was , indeed , ’ said I .
“ Take off his head ! ” cried the audience .
said <NAME> , shaking her head .
‘ I am something of a doctor .
Shadows of the <NAME> and Future 27 .
As to a rolling stone , why , what you say is true .
The thing was incomprehensible to <NAME> , and altogether a fanciful notion .
‘ Is <NAME> at home , <NAME> ? ’ said my aunt .
You may well say like that , indeed ! ’ <NAME> sobbed pitifully .
‘ I really think you had better , ’ said <NAME> .
Could he believe his eyes !
‘ I know who profits by it .
<NAME> delivered to him last night .
It ’ s a red house standing by itself .
‘ Four-and-forty year , next May ! ’ said <NAME> .
Enough that I saw no gate then , and that I saw one now .
We must drink Many happy returns to her .
‘ I am glad to hear there ’ s any doubt about it .
I gave my word of honour to our dear Flintwinch that I would return .
Probably the whole occurrence had not occupied two minutes .
“ But the question , <NAME> .
Remember that , if you please , ma ’ am .
Why couldn ’ t I never give him satisfaction ?
So much the worse for both of us .
<NAME> down. ’ ‘ Thank ’ ee , sir , ’ said <NAME> .
I know many names and I have forgotten many more .
Mr Inspector stepped into the boat .
Bust 'em , and you 'll bust five-and-thirty shillings .
They impel her to say , `` <NAME> has something on his mind ! ''
It was a very small place .
‘ I tell you I will speak to you alone , ’ she said .
‘ Not he , ’ replied the landlord .
“ Not for use ? ” “ That depends .
Because , whoever did , the labouring people did not .
Her garments rustled as she rushed towards the door .
<NAME> <NAME> walked homeward from the school , in a state of considerable satisfaction .
“ Now , ” he pursued , “ concerning <NAME> .
'Now , what do you think ? '
<NAME> , girls , come and see your home ! ''
Curses on your head , and black death on your heart , you imp !
‘ You are to step in here , if you please .
I said you should find me stick to it .
‘ I was very near it .
cries the trooper with the tears springing out of his eyes .
‘ Ay , truly , ’ says the Doctor .
Of course <NAME> said the same .
The <NAME> ’ s compliments were never heard of any more .
‘ So men say , ’ replied <NAME> , drily .
But in the meantime don ’ t go out of the matter .
He took her by the arm .
You have been dreaming again , mistress .
I asked him if this were all he wished me to tell <NAME> .
As of course , being a landlord , he would say .
‘ We ’ re capital hands at likenesses here .
‘ <NAME> , ’ says <NAME> , one day after dinner .
He reasoned with himself : What was it ?
A word in earnest is as good as a speech .
You have acted and recounted faithfully .
It was in a state of dilapidation quite equal to our expectation .
I never spend the copying money .
‘ We have no news , ’ said <NAME> .
I have been down there .
‘ I must indeed , ’ said the patient , looking round the room .
What is the use of your contradicting ? ''
‘ No odds , ’ returned Mr Chivery .
What does it matter to me ? ''
‘ You are quite right , Mr Gills , ’ says Mr Dombey .
He came to the window by that means .
Oh , <NAME> , I am shaken to bits ! ''
He wanted more persuading than I expected .
There they were yonder , by the felled tree .
And this is your establishment ?
Now , welcome poverty ! ’ cried <NAME> , shedding tears .
Not <NAME> , I should say , nor yet <NAME> ? ''
‘ I was passed over for you , ’ said <NAME> .
I have said that he had reason to fear us .
I can see with the naked eye that you gets stouter under the operation .
After some minutes he makes an attempt to rise .
They walked on by the river .
He set down his glass untouched .
I frankly tell you , <NAME> , I give it up altogether .
I never saw such a picture of forlorn affliction and distress of mind .
You English are cold , it seems to me. ” “ Oh !
'No , not near , ' replied <NAME> .
‘ I will , ’ said the aunt .
I will , at any cost .
We ’ ll agree that way , then , ” he says .
'Thank you , sir , ' said <NAME> .
'Here 's her health , and wishing they was all like her ! '
`` Where would you wish to go ? ''
A needle and thread we do n't know how to use .
Round by the <NAME> to <NAME> .
At other times she pictured to herself her mother yet alive .
‘ Dear me , what ’ s that ? ’ exclaimed <NAME> , starting .
I saw no more of <NAME> , until the day when <NAME> left town .
It ’ s very unfortunate for both of us. ’ ‘ Oh !
And as to the crown of his hat , it ’ s high .
'Then _don't_ think of it , ma'am , ' rejoined <NAME> .
`` Truly I 'm old , <NAME> , '' says <NAME> .
Oh he ’ ll be my partner with his glass in his eye !
His fingers is al-ways rusty ! ” muttered young <NAME> .
‘ What answer was sent ? ’ I inquired of <NAME> .
`` Your servant , sir , '' says <NAME> with a military salute .
The <NAME> replied with reticence , couldn ’ t say .
cried the old lady , embracing him ; 'it is my innocent boy ! '
Generally , what kind of man ? ''
`` But you do n't keep it . ''
I 'm a-going to tell you what I want you for .
`` I am not yet placed .
‘ To love me , perhaps ? ’ pursued her brother with a sneer .
<NAME> still retained the other .
‘ There ’ s two Governors , ain ’ t there ?
‘ Come down a step or two .
I -- hum -- I caused you to be respected there , <NAME> .
`` Let us go somewhere at any rate , '' said I .
But both master and pupil understood it so .
‘ Try the thing , and see how you like it .
He does not look back before disappearing , with a wavering step .
I believe I am truly cosmopolitan .
If he could only be there first , and catch <NAME> coming late !
‘ I count upon his coming , ’ said <NAME> .
I don ’ t believe he knows himself .
‘ Never be a <NAME> won ’ t she ?
but these people are always howling .
All this was in a second .
‘ Hand it over , ’ said the gentleman .
There 's the roll of them dreadful carts !
The <NAME> was in permanent quarters under the <NAME> ’ s roof .
One a fat sleek man ? ’ ‘ Ay , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ What do you say ? ’ asked Mr Boffin , snapping at him .
‘ We shall see ! ’ ‘ We shall , ’ rejoined <NAME> .
What time might it be ?
responded <NAME> , winking one of his little eyes .
`` How can I , my dear Esther , with nothing settled ! ''
Summon me anywhere , and I will come .
‘ But what a nice hospital !
'So we are , ' said the beadle .
`` Read it , my dear Watt , '' says the housekeeper .
But as yet he had not heeded .
There was a beautiful fire .
'That 's it , master , ' replied <NAME> .
What can come of this ?
What more can a man expect ?
‘ She is watchful enough , I dare say .
You achieved distinction , you know , when you were with us .
Nevertheless , they are a part of the occasion of my being here .
‘ Who has ill-used him , you girl ? ’ said <NAME> .
You can see the winder from this corner .
‘ Of course I was ! ’ said <NAME> .
The finger still was there .
I must have him down a peg .
It was difficult to determine what it was .
‘ <NAME> ’ , <NAME> ! ’ said the father .
‘ <NAME> me ; I have not even that merit .
No answer still , and I tried the latch .
‘ You astonish me , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
B. file , you do find him .
But I ’ m not afraid in this way .
[ Perpetual Vice- President -- Member <NAME> ] , presiding .
‘ Mrs Gowan is well , <NAME> ? ’ said <NAME> .
‘ That is what I mean .
'Steady , ' said the turnkey , still holding him down .
<NAME> <NAME> leant over before it was quite said and whispered .
I have your leave to speak .
This is the earthly punishment I have brought upon myself .
“ My wife did , at the very moment when you came in .
We never speak about you .
B. was the boy to make his acquaintance .
She answered nothing , but sat weeping -- weeping very much .
‘ He does me no good , ’ said Mr Merdle .
I am always avariciously scheming. ’ ‘ Lor !
<NAME> party , wonderful games , wonderful unanimity , won-der-ful happiness !
Once , twice , three times , and the horses is off .
General burst of cousinly indignation .
‘ Why would you go , dear <NAME> ?
‘ Now I ’ ll tell you what , <NAME> .
There was <NAME> .
This man was a returned transport , and his name was <NAME> .
I am the sworn servant of both , against you .
‘ But don ’ t you think it can be brought about ?
‘ He he he ! ’ laughed Mr <NAME> , ‘ oh !
I had never heard my mama spoken of .
Never were such rakes as the people about where we used to live .
‘ I will relieve him of his trust , ’ returned <NAME> .
I should be very sorry to have justified it .
It ’ s not what <NAME> would have .
‘ He has got into bad ways .
<NAME> drew up his chair , but his appetite was effectually taken away .
He had got his name already .
'All right , ' cried <NAME> , glancing cautiously about .
‘ Go you below , my love , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ It rankled in your baby breast , ’ he said .
so sh ’ is ! ’ cried <NAME> .
`` <NAME> , <NAME> , how did my calculations come out under these circumstances ?
`` Not without notice , <NAME> .
Always a pipe out of the two months ' interest !
I felt as if I did not even dare to hear it .
Now , don ’ t come back to us .
‘ No , no , <NAME> ’ l , not as you are now .
She sees me -- she sees me !
At the first stroke of the hour , the new clerk disappeared .
Does his daughter know of the relapse ? ” “ No .
<NAME> ’ t be so violent with me .
' I know the way there .
I took it from his hand , but laid it on the table .
But the day was declining and she had no time to lose .
Why , you have always told me all day long .
Altogether one might guess <NAME> to have been a trooper once upon a time .
said <NAME> , taking her hand .
‘ Good hand at accounts , ’ said <NAME> .
You , so young , untried , and beautiful , <NAME> !
‘ I was muddled , but not with fair drinking .
Let him have the Bethel minister to comfort and console him , <NAME> .
sir , not at all , ’ replied <NAME> , with extreme civility .
Suddenly they rushed upon him .
“ Ay , what CAN we do ? ” says the faithful servant .
His arrogance contrasted strangely with its history .
Not the slightest fear , I pledge you my honour ! '
And besides , I felt my responsibility as a mother , so much .
He did not want it at all .
But who is this that breaks upon me ?
It took a new shape , but it was the old sad shadow .
<NAME> him that , tell him that . '
An awful company , mysteriously come together !
He replied with the high-shouldered bow .
It is perhaps my duty to impart to you the little I know . ''
`` You do n't remember me , Mr .
Look out , look out , and see if we are pursued .
He looked at her , long and earnestly .
<NAME> could not but glance at <NAME> in the ensuing silence .
We shall do it in time . ''
`` But it is a terrible misfortune , guardian . ''
<NAME> <NAME> came up at the moment , and touched <NAME> on the arm .
‘ Much better said , my dear ; laid it up as a remembrance .
I am a man of business .
inquired <NAME> , surveying <NAME> 's lank form with much disgust .
But that was afar off , <NAME> , afar off ! ''
Then there was an interval of rest under boughs ( such rest ! )
And who is that boy ? ''
I only want your authority .
‘ What is the matter ? ’ said the child .
Well , I could n't have believed it ! '
That is , of course , unavoidable , being in <NAME> .
I am very glad you think so .
‘ Why , nothing , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
My loving loving , bright bright , <NAME> !
`` Will somebody obleege me with a spittoon ?
No one else shall hear . ''
You will judge from this that he has been brought very low .
What can you want to know for , Mr .
‘ All right , sir , ’ replied <NAME> , pausing .
They don ’ t romance , you see , on such pints .
<NAME> is his state when they begin to come down .
I was swallowed up in an abyss of love in an instant .
Yes , uncle had gone home .
By this time his arrangements are complete .
It was so classical , she said .
He had resolved to conquer her , and look here !
<NAME> gracious ! ’ said Mr Meagles , ‘ this is not <NAME> !
I 'm <NAME> , and you can trust me .
‘ No , sir , ’ rejoined <NAME> ; ‘ No , sir .
‘ It isn ’ t any business of his .
His humour is so extremely playful !
This was my first gain from my illness .
So awful , so transcendent in its beauty , so divinely solemn .
They perish before this fatal discovery .
<NAME> <NAME> received the compliment with complacency and dropped a general curtsy to us .
You were asking , sir , <NAME> told me , about our lodger .
“ Do name it , sir , ” says <NAME> .
He felt in his pockets for his latch-key , but had forgotten it .
Their way lies yonder , but what business takes them there ?
<NAME> <NAME> had a great idea of his oratorical powers and his importance .
And <NAME> , she 's ever right and ready .
He closed the book , and laid it on the bed .
You are more flushed than you have been for many days .
`` I wish I was dead ! ''
<NAME> dear thing ! ’ He gave way more .
I do n't wish to see it .
‘ Permit me , ’ said the <NAME> , ‘ one moment .
<NAME> looked searchingly at him ; he returned the look .
But a description of one day will serve for all the rest .
Then the child says : ‘ What , grandpa !
At last , they halted and confronted each other with blank and rueful faces .
Are you desirous to come to terms ?
cried Nancy stamping her foot upon the ground .
`` I have not let him into this , you know .
<NAME> looked at the coins , and then at <NAME> , and hesitated .
“ Pray come in , ” said <NAME> , <NAME> .
`` And yet you never said a word about it ! ''
You would be infinitely better in <NAME> 's house , small as it is .
‘ A most admirable old house , ’ smiled Mr Blandois .
I think so , no longer .
`` I really do n't know but what I WILL take summer cabbage . ''
‘ ’ Twould come easier to me too .
‘ I ’ m a going So and So .
‘ With all the pleasure in life , ’ replied <NAME> .
It 's quite as becoming to the body .
I judged from your sunburnt face that you might be .
<NAME> <NAME> sniffs and tastes again .
I am sure I don ’ t want a protector .
Said he wanted to , did he , my boy ? '
'This must be stated to the board , Mrs. Mann .
`` Do they look like that sort of thing ? ''
‘ I have the father ’ s address .
‘ I want <NAME> , ’ replied a voice .
The cane descended harmlessly upon the ground .
‘ <NAME> , what do I see ?
and again `` Ha , ha , ha ! ''
<NAME> , you undutiful little thing , go and lie down .
I know that my mistake has caused you some distress .
Ai n't my son good enough for you ?
WE know very well how it was .
Did you ever care , <NAME> !
'You shall have it immediately , if you will . '
They entered , without noise ; and the door was closed behind them .
‘ As you please , ’ said <NAME> , shrugging his shoulders .
Let me stay with you .
`` I think so too , '' said my guardian .
‘ My company will be there before me !
She loves to talk like that .
<NAME> affliction has but strengthened and refined them . '
'The one little , little , little word , my blessed <NAME> ? '
<NAME> , but he was a brave boy to smoke !
`` I hope he approved , <NAME> ? ''
Oh , <NAME> , look at him !
‘ But not at all too strong for the facts , ’ returned <NAME> .
( Still swinging ; speaking very slowly ; and without any emotion whatever . )
‘ He defies the usurer , does he ?
( Loud on the part of <NAME> . )
<NAME> and misunderstanding were the fault of the suit ?
Why , it 's an unreasonable proposal !
‘ Do you feel the bottom there , old fellow ? ’ said <NAME> .
At least I want to try .
<NAME> , and revenge me on him !
<NAME> lady outside , sir , wishes to see you. ’ ‘ Outside ?
He was detained two hours .
<NAME> <NAME> was at home .
I never meant to leave you .
Everything was bowed down , dejected , oppressed , and broken .
The Story of the <NAME> .
Think more of yourself , and less of others .
You can tell me nothing that will change me .
In effect , that Power of <NAME> is abroad .
it ’ s true , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ I forgot her .
She had left the table half an hour , and was at work alone .
“ You do n't know ? ” She shook her head again .
A fine night , and a bright large moon , and multitudes of stars .
The time was evening ; the scene the garden .
Until the judgment I expect is given .
“ Wot ’ s the last thing you dewoured ? ” says the doctor .
‘ ’ Tis concerning <NAME> , sir , ’ said <NAME> .
There 's no lady in this house that signs <NAME> is there ?
‘ Well ! ’ he resumed at length .
“ I could not believe it to be you .
We ca n't cook anything whatever .
It was broad daylight now , and he looked about .
‘ I hope so , ’ returned Mr Dombey .
‘ Why look at me , ma ’ am !
‘ <NAME> ‘ ull never cease , ’ added <NAME> , speaking to himself .
You must be hungry after your ride .
`` I suppose you were an excellent son , Mr .
She waves her hand again !
‘ You will do him no hurt that he will not repay .
I am sure I managed very well before we were married .
It ’ s a mere question of price with others besides him .
That secluded sister is my first remembrance . ''
Another , <NAME> calls it gloves .
He clasped his hands together , and involuntarily uttered a subdued exclamation of horror .
<NAME> for the <NAME> prisoner 's kindred in <NAME> Force !
and were as happy as the week was long .
I have sat invisible beside you many and many a day . ''
Have n't I seen you in the Fleet over and over again for contempt ?
<NAME> , hear ! ’ cried <NAME> , in the excitement of his feelings .
This is the signal for a general settlement of the audience .
You must prevent mischief , my dear Sir .
It is wholesome to have you here .
I am not afraid , dear Trotwood .
Oliver replied in the affirmative .
No word was ever spoken between <NAME> and <NAME> now , on these subjects .
The name was mentioned to you , and you passed it on .
But I know <NAME> was impatient of me .
‘ There is no one waiting , <NAME> , dear , ’ said <NAME> .
Not thoroughly pleasing himself with either mode of reply , he breathed hard .
“ Look among those fragments with care , <NAME> .
And do you remember when I got caned for crying about <NAME> ?
<NAME> stillness ensued -- not a rustle -- not a breath -- Guilty .
This is a public-house , that ’ s all .
He mentioned several instances of boys in <NAME> at about the same age .
`` You know I am the Chancellor . ''
But our ways are different ways , none the less .
‘ It is not necessary to prolong these observations .
It shall be here directly . ''
Keep close at my heels , and come along . '
‘ I have no doubt at all about it .
It matters very little how he gained it .
‘ Oh , <NAME> knows , ’ said <NAME> .
'How is the patient to-night , sir ? '
So , <NAME> merely observed that he shouldn ’ t wonder if he was .
I was not aware that Mr <NAME> was a gentleman of landed property .
The speaker who struck in , was <NAME> .
And wine , ’ she added timidly .
I don ’ t know how ever I shall go through with it .
He saw them now about him .
It isn ’ t that I bear malice .
Is immediately referred to innumerable people who can tell nothing whatever .
'You will be prompt , ' said <NAME> .
I am not curious to know your meaning .
‘ Yes , I did , ’ replied Sam .
It was gone as he glanced back .
Put that down , <NAME> Jinks. ’ <NAME> did so .
<NAME> wildly exclaimed that he was badly hurt ; that he was killed !
You have been the soul of generosity .
‘ It ’ s a good step , ’ he said .
I have recently come home to <NAME> after a long absence .
His room was shut up close .
‘ Certainly not , Governor , ’ Mr <NAME> acquiesced .
‘ That ’ ll do , ’ said <NAME> .
I seemed to have been dozing a whole night when the clocks struck six .
He had been drinking , and his eyes were red and bloodshot .
It happened in this wise .
She is dead too now , and has been for many years .
‘ Anybody with you , <NAME> ? ’ inquired the court .
Messrs. Blathers and <NAME> looked very knowing meanwhile , and occasionally exchanged a nod .
This gentleman looked barely thirty .
‘ Yes ! ’ cried <NAME> , in high glee , choking him again .
She might as well have been dressed in a violin-case .
<NAME> Mr Doyce ( who really _is_ growing old ) depends upon you .
`` And how do you get on , <NAME> ? ''
Do not be angry with me for saying this .
`` <NAME> , I have done !
<NAME> pigeon ’ s nothin ’ to it , Sammy. ’ Again <NAME> nodded .
It has been , for years , the utmost height of my hopes .
I ’ ll wink him when I get back .
I ’ m much obliged to you .
I always know what the hour is , and where I am .
( A cry of “ It is , ” and great cheering . )
‘ No man serves him but me .
<NAME> and shame upon your head !
returned the boy , with all his might of wonder .
We are not particular here ; hey , <NAME> ?
<NAME> , however , felt neither depression nor misgiving .
I was intoxicated with joy .
‘ There ’ s a man suspected , ’ said <NAME> .
Do what I want , and I will pay you well . ''
'What direction did he take ? '
You have been badly hurt .
‘ Why , you are strong and quite well , ’ returned Mr Dombey .
“ What a night it has been !
What are my suspicions of you ?
“ Draw on these boots of mine .
Then she 'll set you up . ''
You had better try him in his own house .
You never see such a sight !
Mr <NAME> had had him under inspection pretty well every day .
It was a cover for his book-table that I happened to be ornamenting .
'Wait till <NAME> tells you , then . '
I went through the dreary house , and darkened the windows .
But he resolved that he would come back early in the morning .
pursues <NAME> , coughing his cough of mild persuasion behind his hand .
‘ What did you say , <NAME> ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
`` You are quite a woman , little Fan ! ''
He almost saw it , going on before .
‘ <NAME> cruel , ’ said <NAME> .
We -- we haven ’ t leisure for it .
‘ <NAME> ’ t you know , demmit ? ’ asked <NAME> .
<NAME> on , building on , busily , busily , from morning to night .
It is only what I often say to myself .
'Well , that is a good one , too ! '
<NAME> is with her and has been writing for her and reading to her .
It is somebody 's birthday to-morrow , I think . ''
<NAME> bind , safe find , partner ?
‘ Theer ! ’ said <NAME> , cheerily .
It was no sooner light than it began to rain heavily .
And she does encourage him .
‘ That has been your life .
`` It 's the beautifullest thing that ever was seen ! ''
That was quite another thing , I said .
“ You remember the place , my father ?
So , so ! ’ The whelp was presented , and took his chair .
If I do so , for the time , whose fault is that ?
‘ I am defiled by breathing the air with such creatures .
asked the woman , as collectedly as before .
Firstly , there is a joint-stock piano in a great many of the boarding-houses .
‘ I thankee agen , sir , ’ he said , heartily shaking hands .
‘ The lady , eh ? ’ said <NAME> .
I have made a will .
But I said to <NAME> that we must not leave the boy to die .
Misses <NAME> ! ’ remonstrated the <NAME> .
‘ Alone ! ’ he said , ‘ and <NAME> here this morning !
‘ A pretty and a hopeful picter ?
“ Do you know where <NAME> lives ? ” I asked <NAME> .
A n't I unfortnet enough for you yet ?
‘ You can ’ t have forgotten <NAME> .
that was but a glimpse ; that ’ s scarcely fair .
I know , far better than they do , when the attraction has begun .
‘ You ’ re early , <NAME> , ’ said a voice behind him .
She is hardly more curious in couples than in coffins .
And he laid his hand lovingly upon my head .
‘ Walking about ? ’ repeated <NAME> .
you think she wouldn ’ t have run away ? ’ said <NAME> .
Then he lifted himself up hard , and was dead .
‘ We shall easily arrange that matter , I hope .
‘ I tell you so , ’ returned <NAME> .
<NAME> , one , two , three o ’ clock was nothing to us .
I am past all hope , indeed . '
The faintness of the voice was pitiable and dreadful .
Then it all burst out .
I add no more than this .
I have no resources beyond myself .
It pleases him to have her come , and wake him in the morning .
With precaution , '' said Mrs. Jellyby .
<NAME> , my Lord , ’ replied <NAME> .
Mrs. Sparsit , ma ’ am , I appeal to you .
The foreign gentleman found it very large .
‘ I never saw such a rude creature ! ’ exclaimed <NAME> .
`` I am obliged to you , '' returns <NAME> , squeezing his hand .
I should have loved her under any circumstances .
It ’ s a honourable title , and you fully look it .
<NAME> <NAME> regulated her feelings by the models before her .
Such tears in her eyes , and such love in her face .
Little <NAME> opened the door from without , and they both entered .
‘ Now you ARE a clever old boy !
For what did it bring him in ?
'What advantage would it be to me to be anything else ? '
‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , with great mystery .
growled <NAME> , as <NAME> hesitated , and looked round .
‘ A little dyspeptic ? ’ Mr <NAME> hinted .
`` Why , that you were a good wife , '' replied <NAME> .
In little things , I am a little thing myself -- I always was .
You ’ re not mistaken , and I ’ m not mistaken .
And what have you got on your mind , <NAME> ?
I hold you in contempt for it .
My young conductress locked the gate , and we went across the courtyard .
What follows ? ’ ‘ <NAME> and misery , ’ the bride bitterly replies .
‘ In -- in <NAME> ? ’ pursued <NAME> hastily .
‘ I beg pardon , ’ said Mr Carker , ‘ a thousand times !
Is he not with you ? ’ ‘ No .
‘ O , yes , <NAME> ; let us go for a walk !
' A murrain on the young devils ! '
And what did the lady say to her ?
‘ Oh don ’ t and oh don ’ t , ’ pursued <NAME> .
'The books are on a chair by my table .
<NAME> <NAME> went down on his knees .
‘ How dare you tell me a falsehood ? ’ said <NAME> .
`` I know and deeply feel how sacredly you keep your promise . ''
`` But was she here when the lady came ?
Where he was , something real was .
But I can ’ t summon the vanity to think so .
I am quite alone. ’ ‘ Florence ! ’ said <NAME> , passionately .
He now spoke in a voice rather less steady than usual .
'Speak out , and let me know which . '
`` But I must be fed , if I make one . ''
The <NAME> lived in a shady angle adjoining <NAME> .
What I knew before them , blends with them , too , so curiously .
And so would she , she said , if he were there .
Once more he speaks , as if she had spoken .
These sort of people , I tell him , are glad to sleep anywhere !
<NAME> had no idea that there was anything significant in the occasion .
We went to bed greatly dejected .
It lives in my memory , with the fascination of a remarkable picture .
“ You should n't have lost your temper. ” “ Mr .
<NAME> , my dear <NAME> , has become insupportable to me .
you won ’ t hold that noise , won ’ t you ?
It is a very proper thing .
‘ No , it ain ’ t , ’ said the groom .
'He is an earnest man when his hatred is up .
But it ’ s <NAME> that we were speaking of. ’ ‘ True .
The suspected prior attachment rankled in his heart .
Yes. ’ ‘ And t ’ other on ’ th daughter .
Let it go by with these tears .
'This is all about the robbery , is it ? '
`` Happy to hear it , sir .
The only difference was , that he kept his character to himself .
Then she went on softly playing , but without removing her eyes from me .
Good-bye ! ’ They kissed each other fervently .
He was an universal favourite , and his ingenuity in little things was transcendent .
Let me speak to him .
Every button in his clothes said , ‘ Eh ?
<NAME> <NAME> , after considering , referred the point to his wife .
‘ My dear Bounderby , ’ <NAME> began in reply .
Mrs. Rogers whispered Mrs. Raddle that he was really an elegant young man .
What fears their absence might have occasioned already !
But what is the matter !
I carry about me , not a scrap of writing openly referring to it .
None of your black looks at me !
And yet he ’ s as gentle as any child .
Turn them over in your mind as long as you please .
‘ Eh ? ’ said he , mistrustfully looking in at the door .
He is much marked with shot in his right thigh .
<NAME> , good Florence ! ’ cried the child .
“ The idea of its being you ! ” said he .
<NAME> , I ask <NAME> as a matter of business for information .
Yet I dared not express my anxiety , lest it should give her offence .
`` God knows you are right , master , '' she returns .
‘ And it chanced so with me , ’ said <NAME> .
But I overheard some of it before I left the room .
`` You 'll see her there , my dear . ''
There , he turned his face westward , and left him .
‘ And your little boy -- ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Has he been here since ?
He never thought as I used to give <NAME> the Police-news in different voices !
There is an eminence ready for him to mount upon .
<NAME> ’ t drop that one under your arm .
In the stable the <NAME> found jugs full of old dollars and shillings .
said <NAME> , whom the gin-and-water had rendered facetious .
This boy who brings the information , is young Gay , from the office .
Here 's <NAME> , a fine young fellow full of promise .
I hastily ordered my dinner , and went back to the yard .
‘ I have no doubt it will be a girl .
`` Draw people on , my dear .
<NAME> do ! ’ begged <NAME> .
Oh , very like it indeed , my dear ! ''
A man would die to-night of lying out on the marshes , I thought .
<NAME> , come under my direction .
As I said just now , the world has gone past me .
The more I raved , the more <NAME> barked .
The colonel ’ s son was Mrs Merdle ’ s only child .
No man is better known in <NAME> .
‘ And with too good reason , ’ added Mrs. Weller gravely .
Out of sight , <NAME> , quite out of sight .
‘ The askings , <NAME> ! ’ repeated Mr Toots .
Who would not have hoped in such a cause ?
It was known directly , to the furthest confines of the crowd .
The cloth that covered his cage at night was not removed .
<NAME> ’ t he growed ! ’ said <NAME> .
'Let me see , ' pursued the merchant , reflecting .
You ca n't be too quiet , <NAME> . ''
He entreated Mr Flintwinch to receive the assurance of his profoundest consideration .
And the solemn idiot really believes that he does remember .
I pause for her reply .
‘ Yes , ’ said I , ‘ something. ’ ‘ Ah !
Then , the ground grew marshy and unsettled .
<NAME> 'ye hear what he did ?
The house was very close , and had an unwholesome smell .
‘ I hope it is not I who have distressed you .
I perceive I awaken your sympathy .
Always one for every day in the week .
Welcome to all as knowed you , as the flowers in May !
But why did <NAME> so much want him to remember that ?
said <NAME> , in a majestic voice .
`` You are very good , sir , '' returns the trooper .
Ith over twenty mileth to the rail .
‘ To <NAME> ’ r and his wife ! ’ exclaims the <NAME> .
You should never keep things as may lead to discovery .
demanded <NAME> in a savage voice .
Yet surely there was nothing to be jealous of in the old miserable poverty .
<NAME> ! ’ said <NAME> , laying down his pen .
His nephew left the room without an angry word , notwithstanding .
I find it gives me the horrors , '' returns <NAME> .
Do I know what I know , for that ?
But , I would not take it away while he was present .
Both might be as pale , both as intent .
I have been always tyrannically held down by the strong hand .
'That I leave you to discover , ' replied Mrs. Maylie .
and winks monitions to her to find out what 's the matter .
`` Why did you wish for secrecy ? ''
<NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , in as many sentences .
What might I not get to know , nearly concerning you ?
‘ Could you begin to night , <NAME> ? ’ he then demanded .
I have had the plague continually , ever since I have been here .
‘ <NAME> was all very well , but this is another matter .
‘ <NAME> ? ’ repeated her parent , ‘ Brisk ?
but , <NAME> , you can never feel it as I do .
Re- markable ! ’ ‘ Anybody here ? ’ inquired <NAME> suspiciously .
<NAME> <NAME> thought about me ? ’ said <NAME> .
He is , in sense and attachment , a phenomenon .
‘ You _are _drunk , ’ returned the magistrate .
How goes the world with you , <NAME> , at the present moment ?
And thus ended his first interview with <NAME> .
So much the worse for her .
‘ A watch ? ’ repeated <NAME> musingly .
<NAME> <NAME> reflects for some time .
“ Answer him one question , and he 'll ask you a dozen directly .
`` You are so sprightly , <NAME> , '' returns the venerable grandfather .
‘ Have I detected you in another feast , you Sybarite !
‘ Not an inch , ’ said Mr Carker .
I , of course , and very properly so .
‘ Why , bless my heart ! ’ exclaimed <NAME> .
I never thought of anything about myself , distinctly .
The child has taken leave of her senses .
Stooping , she saw that the grass was bloody .
She clasped me in her arms , and I clasped her in mine .
A merry Christmas to you ! ''
He said he had heard it mentioned .
Jinks. ’ ‘ Sir , ’ said <NAME> .
He stared very hard at <NAME> , and <NAME> stared very hard at him .
why had they stopped in that strange place ?
Of old scenes starting up among the novelties through which he travelled .
Her grandfather ate greedily , which she was glad to see .
I do n't care for eating wittles nor yet for drinking on 'em . ''
‘ Perhaps it ’ s holler and full of something , ’ whispered <NAME> .
you ’ re gone ! ’ The lady sighed .
“ Not if I can help it .
‘ The name has always been unfortunate .
That ’ s the first article of the treaty .
We 'll let in the full light . ''
You bind yourself hand and foot on her account .
I had robbed them when I came of age .
'It <NAME> about Oliver I was going to speak , sure enough .
It doesn ’ t enter into the correspondence of the <NAME> .
'What made you tell the magistrate your name was <NAME> ? '
They could not keep it from me long .
They disliked me ; and they sullenly , sternly , steadily , overlooked me .
You saw and heard the case .
<NAME> glanced towards the <NAME> .
It quite lights up these old rooms .
‘ All that is over , and I have turned my face from it .
He was a boy of about fifteen .
‘ You ’ re late , <NAME> ? ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> won ’ t come to him .
'Bless me , yes , my dear sir , ' said <NAME> quickly .
‘ Who ’ s there ? ’ cried <NAME> , undoing the chain .
However , I thought that being there , I would go through with it .
I do ; and I release you .
<NAME> do not speak harshly to him .
What ’ s the matter ? ’ ‘ Nothing , nothing .
Ever borrow money of the prisoner ?
‘ The C. of B. ’ s ! ’ said <NAME> .
“ Really your business powers are very remarkable. ” I thought so too .
'Well , ' said the doctor , 'you are a queer fellow .
You want me to accept of half a guinea .
‘ Awake at last ? ’ says <NAME> , coming up to him .
‘ If you do , you ’ ll do it at your peril .
`` I was a boy , '' he said impatiently .
Over at Blunderstone it was , of course .
I firmly believe there is nothing .
Put your question. ” “ <NAME> 's name .
It would be of no value at all to me but for your sake .
I hope you are the same .
Though you are a devil still . ''
But my search after her must be begun out of hand .
But I know my partner , <NAME> .
You should be sleeping now .
‘ Then you have never seen acting yet .
The picture on the left is his father , the late <NAME> . ''
<NAME> was the hour appointed for the departure .
‘ And you , ’ benignantly returned the Father of the <NAME> .
The disclosure was made , and the storm raged fearfully .
You can only follow suit .
Very extraordinary thing. ’ ‘ Very , ’ said his three friends .
You are oncommon in some things .
It is a slow , expensive , <NAME> , constitutional kind of thing .
‘ You come to the point , my dear , ’ said my aunt .
`` Bring him here to my room .
The day is now beginning to decline .
I wouldn ’ t be mean if I was you .
`` Father , <NAME> ; <NAME> . ''
Let us make that bargain .
There ’ s a deal of sin in mother .
“ I shall not rest satisfied with merely employing my capital in insuring ships .
<NAME> don ’ t go with me , let me go by myself .
<NAME> know , <NAME> ; tell him that .
‘ Now , about <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
He looked piteously , but slowly rose and did so .
As I am told , certainly not .
`` I have brought my granddaughter Judy .
I 'll save you the trouble .
At the most , he has only his own way for a little while .
<NAME> , you know. ’ ‘ Miss Jenny !
I hope , <NAME> , you will excuse my sending round .
`` This is a <NAME> particular . ''
‘ Sure of it , <NAME> ’ am , ’ rejoined the Major .
“ 'Now , lift me up , <NAME> ; lift me up .
But without looking at him .
We haven ’ t fared nohows , but fared to thrive .
‘ What ’ s this ? ’ exclaimed <NAME> .
I ought to give her the opportunity .
' I ca n't see her face well , ' whispered <NAME> .
Rely on my not wronging your forbearance and consideration .
A chair to Mrs General .
You have a -- ha -- responsibility imposed upon you by your position .
‘ Every step of the way , ’ replied <NAME> .
<NAME> ribbon in every wollume , to keep the place where you leave off .
He could make a boat out of anything , from a skewer upwards .
You are over-tired. ’ ‘ No , I am not at all tired .
“ Yes , of course I saw you .
He repaid her by breaking her fortune , and nearly breaking her heart .
Here are two gentlemen , <NAME> , one of whom you have seen before .
‘ Yes , <NAME> , I know it was , now .
‘ Please to read that , ma ’ am .
Though never so cold and hungry , the timid things would fly from us .
Some men want legs of beef and mutton for breakfast ; I do n't .
Was his face at all disfigured ?
'Now , with regard to this here robbery , master , ' said <NAME> .
It ’ s that as animates you .
There are fifty doors by which discovery may enter .
I always go to chapel before I start on journeys .
The poor old fellow is a dismal wreck .
So far I approve of schools .
I shall not be dead , mistress , and that ’ ll comfort you .
`` Oh , my dear , my dear !
Upon these tenements , the attention of the child became exclusively riveted .
‘ Now , <NAME> my dear , ’ said <NAME> .
Our darling is altogether as stout as we could wish .
And recollect you wo n't get off so easy next time .
I ’ m going on duty there .
Champagne to <NAME> Tox. ’ There was a toothache in everything .
She thought he was chilled with the wet .
Mrs. <NAME> uttered a gentle ejaculation , as having received a moral shock .
Now , candidly. ’ ‘ Eh ? ’ cried <NAME> .
Let us hold to that faith , or none .
I like it exceedingly. ’ ‘ Come ! ’ said my aunt .
No ; not mine , _I_ know !
<NAME> , ’ said my aunt , ‘ you have heard me mention <NAME> ?
There was an error in your calculations .
On the one hand , the young woman has the boat .
You have money , and <NAME> has beauty and worth .
It said nothing of her weariness and watching , and praised him highly .
I want to speak to him .
Well , you played your round game out again .
‘ A widow , ma ’ am ? ’ said <NAME> .
‘ But I might do it .
Her sorrows were known to man ; her virtues to God .
So I told papa last night I must come out .
Then you haven ’ t got the money for a deal about you ?
He drew back the bolts with a trembling hand , and opened the door .
Two subjects I forbid -- must forbid .
The supper passed off without any attempt at a general conversation .
On each of these occasions the patient winced and winked .
“ Allow me to lead the way .
`` I 'll tell you my own case .
She is the dearest friend I have , positively ! ''
he returned with a smile .
They took me , by the same conveyance , to the jail itself .
The staunch old gentleman was still in his trust ; had never left it .
I thank him kind , for all he done , I ’ m sure !
Where is the nearest man—upon the right , or on the left ?
I have had no rest since I left here .
‘ Come , my dear Sir , draw up your chair to the table .
‘ Dashed if I know ! ’ said Mr Boffin .
It came on slowly , like a cloud when there is no wind .
It would only be like you .
But we do n't , not the least .
In this position he could not help overhearing what followed .
‘ Are you mad , sir ? ’ demanded <NAME> .
How does each one of the three get through the day ?
I have thought it over , I can tell you .
The passengers were landing from the packet on the pier at <NAME> .
Mis- ’ ‘ Placed affection ? ’ suggested <NAME> , timidly .
He had attained one of the greatest objects of his ambition .
‘ Three weeks to-morrow , ’ replied the servant .
He ’ ll drop down on me any way .
But we grow affecting : let us proceed .
Let no one know where I am !
‘ The old gentleman was well known all round here .
As the time drew nearer , she could hardly breathe .
‘ You know Mr Gowan ? ’ he said in a low voice .
‘ You worry me to death with your chattering .
He , <NAME> , himself , had sometimes repined at the existence of <NAME> .
‘ I suppose I must , ’ said <NAME> , looking at <NAME> .
And <NAME> , I see him a-forced to turn away his own self .
Indeed , my dear , it ’ s not a whim .
Nevertheless , I do not go with Mrs. Jellyby in all things .
`` The wind 's in the east . ''
He had not put them there first .
And some uncles , in large families , are even younger than their nephews .
That if this story was true , it was only in part true .
‘ I am going on , ’ returned the daughter .
`` Did she though , really , <NAME> ? ''
‘ Oh , the river ! ’ she cried passionately .
‘ Yes , sir , ’ returns <NAME> , ‘ all !
A sinking , a depression , a lowness , a lassitude , a debility .
I 'm not a going to be made unlucky by _your_ sneaking .
It was some time before they left the prison .
<NAME> to us , the winds , the only listeners left you !
* * * * * Into how much of futurity ?
You know it ca n't be . '
Here , catch hold ; there 's plenty more where they were took from .
His manner towards Mr <NAME> was deeply conceived and perfectly expressed .
You are extremely deficient in your facts .
At length the morning dawned .
‘ Counsel ’ s Office , ’ replied the executor in a whisper .
Mrs. Rouncewell folds her hands again .
‘ He is trying to deceive himself , even before our eyes , already .
`` And , <NAME> , I am in this difficulty about him .
You know I had an old interest in you .
I simply canna coom in .
<NAME> , my dear friend , there 's a chance for you .
`` Have you anything to sell ? ''
Would she go with me ?
<NAME> , as rich as Mr Boffin .
said <NAME> , caustic and cold as ever .
It was the last day of the year .
I tell you what I should like .
The waggoner was at our coach-door .
Must we tell the truth ?
He then resumed his employment .
He broke down all at once .
There 's no now for us suitors . ''
I shall be always glad to think so , <NAME> .
He is a good child , this mender of roads , called <NAME> .
But I have forgotten one thing .
'Never let me hear the boy 's name again .
<NAME> caught him up , and walked at his side .
The fat boy pointed to the destination of the pies .
‘ He desired me to give his kindest love , ’ said <NAME> .
We left him at a milestone .
But we would agree to make him rich enough to live , I suppose ?
Of course he married , and who should be his wife but <NAME> ?
‘ This is very curious , ’ thought <NAME> .
I was very sorry for it , afterwards .
‘ The noise behind grew louder .
‘ That ’ s a very good arrangement , ’ cried <NAME> .
`` Do not dismiss me so soon , mademoiselle ! ''
'Have you got anything in my line to-night ? '
‘ I never have forgotten it .
“ <NAME> , ” said I , “ let me hear more about you .
At this juncture a considerable noise of voices is heard in the hall .
I have told you what to do .
Sure you have not forgotten ?
The coldness of her hand when I touched it , I can feel yet .
But it was all done as a breath passes from a mirror .
‘ And did I say I wasn ’ t , miss ?
Is it necessary that I should defend myself for expressing my displeasure ?
he asked me with a keen glance .
But I put <NAME> first .
‘ There are no more at present , ’ returned Mrs. Micawber .
So far as I can tell , you seem to be a deserving object .
“ Bless my soul , ” everybody says , “ somebody taken suddenly ill !
‘ It ’ s of no use , ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> would not have relinquished his post of candle-bearer to anyone alive .
She lies in our little churchyard .
Mr Toots would run headlong at anybody , too .
`` <NAME> , my dear <NAME> , my good <NAME> , my kind <NAME> !
‘ There is the answer , sir , ’ said the powdered-headed footman .
I know my failing full well .
`` Certainly , certainly , '' returns the other .
<NAME> bends down on the footstool at my <NAME> 's feet .
’ <NAME> better not to walk too much together .
They had cleared the town , as the church-bell struck two .
He left a bundle of old letters . ''
‘ How awkward you are , ’ said the pretty housemaid .
Indeed , upon Mr Dorrit likewise .
My aunt and I did not attempt to disturb him .
Then , he stood intently listening to the water .
So might you or I be .
“ <NAME> , <NAME> ! ” said <NAME> , staring at me .
His general description is easily abridged .
‘ She was very ill last night .
`` Yes I will , yes I will !
<NAME> Kit live a single man all his days , or did he marry ?
The servants were recalled , and the meal proceeded to its conclusion .
At times Mrs Lammle would lean forward to address Mr Lammle to this purpose .
‘ A chance ! ’ echoed the dwarf , ‘ a certainty !
‘ These children look healthy , ’ said Mr Dombey .
I thought those were high and great emotions .
I had almost made up my mind that he was dead . ''
<NAME> my stars , I know my sitiwation . '
You were much the stronger , mother , and directed him .
She cared nothing for you. ” “ So !
All his relations let him have his own way pretty well .
‘ There ’ s wery little trust at that shop .
<NAME> <NAME> was fonder and fonder of him every day .
‘ No , ’ he returned , ‘ not at present .
Neither of these names belongs to it .
In lieu of springs , they are hung on bands of the strongest leather .
‘ I press for no confidence now .
He looked worn and solitary .
It is better as it is , my dear sir .
‘ What does she want ? ’ asked <NAME> .
It is their station to work .
Does it not seem cruel ? ’ said <NAME> .
I really couldn ’ t think of it ! ’ said Mrs. Nickleby .
‘ Hollo ! ’ was the red-headed man ’ s reply .
On a Sunday night , <NAME> comes home .
the arrangement this day concluded and my ( GOOD-bye to you , <NAME> ! )
There is a hat lying in the grass. ’ They went forward together .
‘ <NAME> ’ ee , <NAME> , ’ said Mr Boffin .
Would n't She weep for you ?
‘ Do you know me ? ’ demanded the gentleman .
‘ I ’ m a-going to seek her , fur and wide .
<NAME> still entreats <NAME> to accept it .
I do admire them -- as bright prospects .
`` Nothing , thank you , '' said I .
`` I saw a young lady of that name not long ago .
I counsels him to speak to <NAME> ’ ly .
Look at your boy : he _is_ your ' n , ai n't he ?
The <NAME> won ’ t run away .
Now , let me hear what it ’ s all about .
I do pity him , that I do ; he ’ s so deluded .
I knew no strength could equal mine , and I was right .
I have been looking at the weather-cock .
I only say that I am certain he does not like me .
‘ Yes , <NAME> , I ’ m small , ’ returned <NAME> .
'It was n't anything particular , dear , ' said the lady evasively .
Umble as I am , I know it is so true !
He can not easily touch his face , his arms being bound .
‘ What does it matter whether I eat or starve ?
‘ And two pound of that was trust , ’ repeated <NAME> .
‘ Well , well ! ’ said my aunt .
I know he spoke of her that evening .
‘ <NAME> to bear me company here ! ’ thinks he .
The latter fact being never so much as suspected by the good Captain .
There is a very young lady who may perhaps come to see him .
‘ Charming women , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ In here , my dear sir .
Never saw such a likeness in my life ! ''
‘ You too , R. W. , are welcome , though late .
‘ <NAME> , not quite that , ’ returns the lumbering auctioneer .
The chimes were ringing the three quarters past eleven at that moment .
I was not sleeping , nor what a person would term correctly , dozing .
They did not know that she was dead , at first .
Not <NAME> ; or <NAME> would have flown out to meet him .
‘ My dear Kate , ’ said Mrs. Nickleby , kissing her daughter affectionately .
`` Keep your temper , my good fellow , keep your temper ! ''
The horn sounded a few cheerful notes , and the coach was gone .
She lifts up her eyes and looks at him .
He was much worn , and so were they .
Yes , that 's wery good , sir . ''
She waited yet some quarter of an hour , as she judged .
‘ Yes , sir , ’ replied the boy .
It had no effect upon the cries ; no pendulum could be more regular .
Thereupon the ladies cast indignant glances at <NAME> .
I ask you how you come by ‘ em ?
He has been but a little time gone yet . ''
I have done quite sufficient for my purpose .
Now you know you are , '' he said .
Now , <NAME> , <NAME> , why do I relate all this ? ''
There was no such Being in the world .
<NAME> , <NAME> wept afresh , and they bemoaned themselves together .
Why , he might be robbed fifty times over !
We are playing in the winter twilight , dancing about the parlour .
The letter was written , and next day Mr <NAME> was advertised for .
At length he stammered out , ‘ I ask YOU where she is ?
‘ The same as ever , ’ said <NAME> .
`` Hope you 're well , <NAME> ?
Shall I put any of those little things up with mine ?
`` My dear friend , will you shake me up a little ? ''
<NAME> , I 'll tell you something .
<NAME> <NAME> improves an Old Acquaintance 39 .
‘ No , thank you , sir , ’ said <NAME> .
Another , <NAME> calls it a fan .
His <NAME> sat looking at him for some time in silence .
But your friends are proud and rich .
’ <NAME> not me as should be looken to for that , sir .
A smell like a washing-day !
'Do n't sigh , Mrs. Corney , ' said <NAME> .
If she requests it , I will do it .
He was punctilious in the exaction of this ceremony .
Presently , she resumed her staring round the room .
He was taken ill in the library this morning .
I have arrived at maturity . ''
<NAME> solidity was the characteristic of the <NAME> plate .
It is far more difficult to say than what I have said .
‘ Surely not. ’ ‘ Yes there is !
All to save a woman .
‘ My old master ! ’ said <NAME> .
Do I know , now , that my child-wife will soon leave me ?
Oh , what a day it was !
'Very sweet , indeed , ma'am , ' replied <NAME> .
It is not right , and I must not recognize it .
By-the-by how DO you take the air at the top of the house ?
‘ We were trespassing , it seems , ’ said <NAME> .
It may perhaps stop his fiddle-playing , if he has a gift that way .
‘ Yes , a proper spirit ; a becoming spirit .
You summon no energy and purpose .
It was , that he purposed first seeing Mrs. Steerforth .
'But not for two , ma'am , ' rejoined <NAME> , in soft accents .
My narrative proceeds to <NAME> , with a thankful love .
These blandishments have entirely won the family heart .
‘ You will be sure to come ? ’ said <NAME> .
They must be presented to-night , or the poetry is gone .
We wouldn ’ t have touched you if you hadn ’ t forced us .
This feud between you and young Drood must not go on .
‘ -- Unless at a high price .
You ’ re right ! ’ said <NAME> .
'Come on , you young villain !
O dear yes ! ’ cries <NAME> , laughing with great enjoyment .
‘ Good night , young <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
Mr Dombey , in his friendlessness , inclined to the Major .
His face quite altered as he looked at me .
“ What did you say ? ” cried my sister , beginning to scream .
I also communicated to him another caution .
We must be further away -- a long , long way further .
My pleasure 'ull be fur to see him do it .
‘ How do you do , Miss <NAME> ? ’ said Mr Dombey .
'What do you think he 's thinking of , <NAME> ? '
What 's the name of the house -- t-h-r -- three what ? '
Ruminating on this strange chance and strange glimpse , he turned into the court-yard .
He told us Jarndyce and <NAME> .
They live with us now. ’ ‘ They ? ’ said I .
In consequence , he came down , looking rather wild .
He does to this hour .
How harshly and unmusically need not be described .
Her name is <NAME> or nothing .
`` Is <NAME> 's presence necessary to-morrow , <NAME> ? ''
It was not in good taste .
<NAME> ? ’ ‘ One sister , ’ rejoined <NAME> .
`` What may YOUR game be , ma'am ? ''
<NAME> <NAME> has been the subject of one of these dedications .
Now , would it be possible for her to change them ?
‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ I am glad to hear it .
My Lady removes her eyes from him no more .
‘ That was a great mistake of yours , ’ observed <NAME> .
Giving him a dark glance in acknowledgment of his answer , <NAME> knocked loudly .
<NAME> <NAME> looks at him in stern inquiry .
<NAME> Slammer -- <NAME> of the 97th rejected !
But it could never alter as his own did .
She very soon determined upon turning the discovery to account .
Then she don ’ t lay it upon me ?
With a passing gesture of his hand at the picture -- what !
'Where did he come from ? '
would it though ! ’ rejoined the small servant , with a horrified look .
<NAME> here , sir ; here ’ s a oyster-stall to every half-dozen houses .
Well , we ’ ve done everything that ’ s necessary .
‘ Silence yourself , ’ said <NAME> , turning red .
Give me a moment , because I like to cry for joy .
‘ I am not afraid to die , ’ he said .
<NAME> with her covered face obeyed , trembling and weeping as she went .
<NAME> ? ’ An average witness would have been seduced by the <NAME> ?
‘ I know nothing of summer and winter , shut up here .
I shall come home when I please , I tell you .
He thanked me and ran to his mother 's again -- and back again .
His work and me are parted .
`` Why , what was the matter with him ? ''
‘ Our brother the matter ? ’ returned <NAME> , with airy contempt .
In came the six young followers whose hearts they broke .
It was within half an hour or so of the time of closing .
`` To be sure , '' says <NAME> .
‘ For a journey , sir ! ’ cried <NAME> .
‘ Say that again. ’ ‘ He ’ s very deaf .
She was leagued against him now .
<NAME> there any such record here ?
Will you take port wine , sir , or sherry wine , sir ?
I should like to have him compelled to swallow one of every <NAME> coin .
He heard all this and more .
I am deeply sorry for the reproaches you have borne on my account .
`` May I go with you ? ''
“ Hah ! ” he went on , handing me the bread and butter .
I thought of the blue-eyed child who had enchanted me .
`` Indeed it is not so , sir , '' said <NAME> .
However , we ’ ll have that all settled tomorrow .
<NAME> ’ t I know she wouldn ’ t ?
'Please , sir , ' replied <NAME> , ' I want some more . '
But you won ’ t be , will you ?
`` He is a poor abused ! ''
Unopened letters and unsorted papers lay strewn about the desk .
I mean , that he feels the degradation .
<NAME> at seven , dinner at half-past twelve , supper about six .
She might have seen this coming on .
Feeling that certainty , I befriend him .
demanded <NAME> : 'are you sure ? '
Is there any particular feeling on that head ? ''
She also spoke with great distinctness .
They were at her bedside for weeks .
The face was gone from the door .
The look and the action had occupied but an instant .
He asked me what I would have for dinner ?
‘ “ Scolding wives , ” snarled the genius .
‘ Pretty child. ’ ‘ Pretty , indeed ! ’ cried <NAME> .
“ You have a visitor , you see , ” said <NAME> .
! ’ cried Mr Boffin , with a cunning wink .
She , equally discreet , busies herself with her needlework .
‘ <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> , ‘ had her own maid .
‘ Why , we have not been idle , sir .
I come from <NAME> Manette. ” “ And what says he ?
'He knows what I mean , <NAME> ; do n't he ? '
But in regard to wisiting <NAME> .
<NAME> , gentle , patient , noble <NAME> was dead .
Permit me , <NAME> , to shake it , ’ said the grave man .
We should then have known what we had to expect .
<NAME> enough to work with tolerable peace of mind ?
No , no , no , do n't go away .
I say to you , a million of times over , it is .
What do you want , <NAME> , when I have company ? ''
'Yes , sir , ' replied <NAME> , weeping bitterly .
<NAME> image has ever since been fixed in my breast .
You have my name very correctly .
I ’ d trust him with untold gold .
It is no fault of his , that he did not .
'There , my dear , ' said <NAME> .
The three persons were <NAME> and two male guests .
<NAME> <NAME> takes the light .
<NAME> is heard of him , nothing is seen of him .
Being at last touched on the shoulder , I started and turned .
“ What place is that ? ” <NAME> asked me .
<NAME> <NAME> nodded his consent .
‘ Good-bye , my little friend , ’ returned the Doctor .
P. ! ’ said his astonished lady .
We could have spared a -- hum -- gondola for that purpose .
If they try to know more , it ’ s a notice to quit .
“ A carriage will have to be sent for , <NAME> .
He saluted his intended mother-in-law , and his intended bride .
I shall be watched or seen .
<NAME> nodded an expressive approval of this mode of treatment .
When I go anywhere , I go for pleasure .
But the figures had the old obstinate propensity -- they WOULD NOT add up .
<NAME> at last begs <NAME> to return .
Objects began to take a bleared and russet colour in his eyes .
'How can I find her ? '
You are beaten out of all reason .
And here , the cart stopped .
‘ Poor thing ! ’ said the woman .
‘ I beg your pardon , sir , ’ said <NAME> .
Next morning <NAME> and his feeble companion began their journey .
Let him profit by the means as I found out ?
Red <NAME> made his salad ( I wondered how they could eat it .
‘ Far from it , ’ assented <NAME> .
I wish you ’ d be a little rational , <NAME> .
Have you paid <NAME> ? ” “ O yes , sir !
‘ I know not where to begin .
Is this our previous understanding ? ''
And you HAVE brought him through it , noble ! ''
‘ You had better not ! ’ said <NAME> , with a threatening aspect .
What name is wrote upon that craft indelibly ?
And it has been renewed no end of times .
‘ Something like a look out , _that_ was , wasn ’ t it ?
‘ I ’ ve no objection to take you that way .
The prisoner was like a young child in his hands .
<NAME> ’ t I been his pardner ?
‘ Three serious footmen , ’ replied <NAME> .
‘ Shut the door after you .
As if I had n't had enough of THAT ! ''
a very respectable way of doing It .
'Yes , ' replied Mrs. Corney , bashfully .
<NAME> <NAME> ’ s eyes are red , and her pocket-handkerchief is damp .
I think to express sympathy .
But they did n't devote the whole evening to music .
We all four went back together and went into the place where <NAME> was .
‘ What is it ? ’ ‘ Papers , deeds .
He takes orders for us on commission , when he can get any .
The first is <NAME> .
`` Bear with me for a moment .
‘ <NAME> ! ’ her young mistress exclaimed .
I can read your signals , my lad .
'You feel sleepy , do n't you , my dear ? '
<NAME> ’ s parents were poor people who lived in a court .
Under an accumulation of staggerers , no man can be considered a free agent .
What do you want of me ?
Such a thing was to be .
<NAME> alive here with them horses .
By and by , I roused myself , and went to the play .
Quite as he might have kissed her , if she had been conscious ?
`` What is it called , dear guardian ? ''
So he took care of <NAME> , and <NAME> and I went first .
‘ Oh , pray , aunt , try to help me !
‘ What else do I make ? ’ ‘ Pen-wipers , ’ said <NAME> .
“ He had before offered me money , which I had postponed taking .
Proud as these nobles are , he is afraid to see me .
‘ Can you suppose I doubt it ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , no .
That was April Fool Day .
They are neither of <NAME> ’ s inclusive regulars , nor of her extras .
They talked of hope and comfort .
Tell her that more depends upon it than she dare believe , or hope .
“ Good-bye , <NAME> ! ” said <NAME> .
'Go on , ' said <NAME> , signing to Mrs. Maylie to approach .
He isn ’ t forced to run upon the <NAME> , but he may .
And you , ma ’ am ? ’ returned <NAME> .
The time is flitting by ; the hour is coming with an angry tread .
`` My dear friend , he is not to be depended on .
It was his own room .
`` Is this true concerning the poor girl ? ''
`` I will give you no further trouble about this little wager . ''
But I like business , ’ said <NAME> , getting on a little faster .
Not very strong , that hope , if you went soldiering !
They was letters from the lodger 's sweetheart , and she signed <NAME> .
Let us have <NAME> and Mrs. Micawber back .
‘ Why did I come here ! ’ was his second .
'Going on to <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> .
( <NAME> tears the dewdrops of the heart ?
He has cleaned me out .
Not a servile one—these Hands will never do that !
Why , not much , <NAME> ; not much .
They are no such thing , sir .
Her eyes were fixed upon her face .
The growlery is the best-used room in the house .
Thus <NAME> grew to be nearly five years old .
Little <NAME> , blushing , shook her head .
`` And how do you come to be the messenger , <NAME> ? ''
Mr <NAME> ’ s air was crestfallen and submissive .
But he is a good , good man .
`` Not many an <NAME> leaf or berry that I could n't name .
‘ This must be where my sister lives , sir .
<NAME> till the greens is off her mind .
What a lazybones yer are , <NAME> . '
“ My dear Biddy , they do very well here -- ” “ O !
There is a little talk about Mr Dombey , but very little .
`` Do you happen to carry a box ? ''
'What do you mean by this ? '
P. , mind , ’ observed the other .
What became of <NAME> Dorrit between the two eights was a mystery .
Mrs <NAME> made their plans for every day , and executed them .
`` I remember faces very well . ''
I am a little too fond of freedom for _that_ , sir .
I have been waiting for you some time .
‘ You are awake , sir ? ’ The dwarf nodded .
I say it , though I am his mother .
So now I am a going to tell you .
At no time did I dare to utter her name .
<NAME> is shyer than ever .
Would you not ? ” “ Truly yes , madame. ” “ Yes .
And I would ! ’ This was followed by another walk .
‘ Very , ’ replied <NAME> , with some vehemence of manner .
<NAME> lightly descended , and ran in after her .
I will walk here until the pride of this house is humbled .
Since he has your orders to come , I will not interrupt you . ''
‘ No , no , I beg your pardon , ’ retorted the <NAME> .
‘ Oh yes , <NAME> , I am going to give you warning .
Some intense associations of a most distressing nature were vividly recalled , I think .
Then <NAME> ’ <NAME> said he would try me again .
Why have I cultivated you in the manner I have done since the morning ?
growled <NAME> , as <NAME> started up ; 'half-past five !
They seized it , and fled .
‘ Very well , ’ said <NAME> .
The opposite party followed up the attack .
It was like new life to him .
It was not too late for that .
‘ Ye-yes , ’ I said , ‘ he was well taken care of .
To be buried alive for eighteen years ! ” IV .
In another was the inscription <NAME> BOUGHT .
I ought to apologise for looking in so late .
You would n't mind being at once introduced to the <NAME> , would you ?
I ha ’ seen thee , aw this night .
I felt rather disappointed with it .
They descended into the passage , and thence into the cellars below .
Her enemy he is , even in his grave .
‘ I see no difficulty if you wish it .
‘ We have more cause to think of my aunt than of anyone .
`` To-morrow or the next day . ''
`` It 's not agreeable , is it ? ''
He do n't lose much of a dinner . ''
The little man , with a low growl , stood still .
said the surgeon at last .
So I ’ ll be a benefactor to society , and go .
‘ I didn ’ t think much about it , ’ returned the beauty .
It was a relief to have got free of the room .
I was very careful indeed as to that .
Or he 'll be drawn to ruin . ''
‘ I know wheer you ’ re a-going .
Well , this was a great relief .
You had better by far keep still .
We went out one morning and were married . ''
He thought he saw the curtain move .
‘ Oh yes , ’ said <NAME> .
There are ladies with ‘ em ; cover me up with something .
To what use do I devote them ?
<NAME> has some recompenses for her many privations .
‘ <NAME> thanks , ’ said the stranger .
It ’ s suits o ’ clothes. ’ <NAME> ’ s face changed .
At dinner she maintained her watch , with the same unwinking eyes .
They should not be looked at .
Here ’ s a miserable orphan for you .
Now , I ai n't alone , as you may think I am .
'Yer speak as if yer were in earnest , ' replied <NAME> .
And an infinitely dreary person he appeared to me to be .
You have had the money and must refund it .
<NAME> my face to him . '
An open door afforded a perspective view of the Aged in bed .
‘ Bear a hand and help me .
You mustn ’ t let that child make that noise either .
`` Here I am , you see ! ''
‘ Spirited contest , my dear sir , ’ said the little man .
Here the position of affairs had not at all improved .
Mr Merdle ’ s undertakings are immense .
‘ Nothing , ’ said the spinster aunt .
We were now down in <NAME> .
from her , is it ? ’ said <NAME> .
‘ That ’ ll never do. ’ ‘ Why not ? ’ asked <NAME> .
<NAME> accident in these parts .
You know what they were .
I was not grieved for myself : I was quite contented and quite happy .
‘ Yes indeed , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ the discovery was hers .
What is better , I don ’ t feel so .
This , with the tears coursing down her fair old face .
‘ To be sure you could , ’ replied <NAME> .
Here was a crying child , and there a noisy wife .
It was altogether such an astonishing event to see her do it !
And with a violent effort he tore himself away .
After a short delay , however , <NAME> tottered in , followed by <NAME> .
<NAME> was in the first stage of a high and dangerous fever .
She said it exasperated her .
It 's easier to give it than to withhold it .
`` Who was that lady -- that creature ?
`` I was thinking of something so different !
Everybody is ready to dislike and ridicule any invention .
`` No man does , sir , '' returns <NAME> .
He was fast asleep directly .
‘ I am most delighted to hear it , ’ said <NAME> .
Oh , horror , he IS here !
The <NAME> religion , introduced here by the early <NAME> settlers , prevails extensively .
He presented <NAME> , in form .
For your difference from all around you. ’ ‘ Well !
It would have been far better not to have detained me .
who talks to the child of funerals ?
In the evening , after tea , I heard that he was come .
<NAME> said nothing at all .
I have not told you all , have I ? '
He stopped idly , and looked at them .
I am sorry I can not offer chocolate .
Yo ’ r not fearfo ’ o ’ her .
'What did <NAME> say ? '
`` How did you know it was the country ? ''
`` You find the rent too high , do you , sir ? ''
“ This really is a very bad side of human nature !
said Mrs. <NAME> sweetly .
You have your remedy in your own hands .
<NAME> was not used to confinement .
he said , leaning back in his chair .
Yes it did , <NAME> replied .
If it were a poor thing , I knew he would pass it over .
He was not to come down till he saw us .
He rarely removed his eyes from his face .
‘ Mr Lightwood and I have met before , ’ he said .
But one point at a time .
Under the Prerogative Office , the country had been glorious .
and another thing I forgot to name !
returned <NAME> with playful admiration .
There was no more breaking up of the strong old face into weakness .
‘ Everything is so at sixes and sevens .
<NAME> <NAME> was very cheerful at the little supper .
The lady will not detain Mr Twemlow longer than a very few minutes .
End of the <NAME> EBook of <NAME> , by <NAME>
He is the chartered libertine of the place .
He 'll join his old friends the thieves , and laugh at you .
'Yes , the other gentleman 's paid , ' replied the girl .
He is deceiving you , my good friend . '
She is just the same .
We stayed up there all the evening .
Whom I had not heard .
Now , I ’ m a-coming to the other , which is much worse .
He of course stopped too .
‘ Oh , he ’ s a precious piece of goods !
`` She will succeed , my love ! ''
I do n't take to it .
‘ Ah ! ’ echoed <NAME> , with a long-drawn sigh .
‘ <NAME> , turn you about and take yourself home .
Oh , what a dreadful opinion to have of me !
The only visitors I ever saw , or heard of , were creditors .
<NAME> <NAME> glances over his spectacles and begins again lower down .
Only one of the two names left to give him !
Try to sleep in the chair there , while I watch .
“ <NAME> , of course ? ” said he .
I never thought this of him. ” “ My husband , it is so .
‘ Em ’ ly , my dear , ’ cried <NAME> .
‘ My dear , how do you do ?
‘ <NAME> crooked , ’ said <NAME> , writing as he spoke .
May I go and tell him you are here ?
Like a speeches of chaff .
`` My dear <NAME> , most joyfully !
Let her take her time -- her own time .
‘ Very , ’ said the gentleman with the camp-stool .
We had a visitor next day .
And yet consider the contrast , <NAME> .
‘ “ Hem ! ” said the baron , stopping short .
‘ Who passes by this road so late ?
cries Krook in high glee .
‘ And I shall hear of my Rosebud from <NAME> ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
‘ Dear me , how slow you are ! ’ ‘ Oh !
Do you know who you are , and what you are ? '
Order a private room , and do not mention my name .
As the day advanced the rain increased .
On the opposite side of the broad hearth , my Lady at her table .
All wished <NAME> good-night and <NAME> wished good-night to all , except <NAME> .
‘ Look here , child , ’ returned <NAME> .
If I must , I must .
Mr Barnacle would see him .
“ I don ’ t know , ” says the doctor .
This was <NAME> and <NAME> 's .
says <NAME> , divesting himself of his wet dreadnought in the hall .
My very bones is rendered flabby by brooding over it .
‘ Let them be at the door by eleven , ’ said <NAME> .
and letters from <NAME> ! ’ said the Doctor .
‘ So you do , so you do , no doubt .
If his nose had been upside-down , he would have made that respectable .
That way , sir , if you please .
I might almost say fiercely .
Their ride was six or eight miles long .
‘ No ! ’ said <NAME> , monotonously .
said the girl , after a short pause .
Then , such an oracle as she became in reference to the localities !
I saw her pass me on the road .
Never had pupil a more patient , unwearying , considerate , kindhearted master .
An animated discussion took place .
I despised them , to a man .
'_That_ was not my doing , ' observed <NAME> .
His own heart laughed : and that was quite enough for him .
‘ Or the <NAME> ! ’ cried <NAME> .
I have been an instrument of severity against sin .
We wo n't be so cruel as to send you away , my dear .
<NAME> , having read it , asks him what he thinks .
It made me sigh to think of him .
She recoiled from this figure , as it smiled at her .
Of all the turnkeys , he ’ s as much my friend as yours .
‘ That ’ s right , ’ said the other .
No pleasures of the chase in this part of the country ?
<NAME> made a motion with his head , as if she were outside .
I mean what a pity ! ''
I ’ ll follow him up , <NAME> !
‘ Were you his mother ? ’ said the child .
‘ I ’ m not nervous any more .
‘ Ay surely , ’ returned the old man .
Fill your glass while I ’ m gone .
<NAME> ’ t look towards me ; look towards him .
`` His dressing-room is on my <NAME> 's side .
The occasion was not long in coming .
Several curious little circumstances transpired as the action proceeded .
You musn ’ t really , you know ! ’ urged <NAME> .
You was favored , and he was bullied and beat .
The book-stall keeper got into the coach ; and away they drove .
`` It has become quite a novelty to see her here .
Which is all about the <NAME> , and sundry <NAME> learned therein 32 .
The night was very dark .
says <NAME> , shaking hands with him .
A profound silence came upon all , for <NAME> was dignified beyond expression .
“ Us two being now alone , sir , ” -- began <NAME> .
The last man died here .
That 's a case of deformation of character , any way . '
`` I do n't know what day of the month it is ! ''
That accounts for your having so much time to give to interceding .
‘ The gentlefolks can ’ t hear themselves speak , <NAME> .
‘ Ah ! ’ he said , slowly turning his eyes towards me .
It was a hurried breakfast with no taste in it .
‘ <NAME> as handsome. ’ ‘ Oh Christopher !
Shall I keep you in view ?
‘ All us man-servants at <NAME> ’ Lodgings is named Deputy .
This took me to the <NAME> , where I saw a light .
The domestic obeyed , and the baron locked the door .
“ Tom ! ” softly over the coach roof .
Very handsome , indeed ! ’ cried Mr Dorrit .
‘ It appears to be her native part of the country , sir .
I would not forget it , for the world .
I knew he would be worse by and by .
All was silent and deserted .
The second call produced <NAME> , once <NAME> .
He saw they were coming to the subject .
You remember whether I took him out or not .
As I have told you before , I am the mere agent .
I have lived here many years .
A face that I don ’ t know .
And she wouldn ’ t go into the <NAME> , and so she died .
I have tamed that savage stenographic mystery .
Mrs Flintwinch has a Dream 5 .
Her father was a little impatient , and a little querulous .
‘ Are they here ? ’ was the first question he asked of <NAME> .
‘ Well , I suppose it would though. ’ And sat staring and ruminating .
I am sure of that .
<NAME> <NAME> appeared to revive .
<NAME> ’ s face fell , and he paused a moment .
‘ He is a dreadful reprobate , ’ said Mrs. Weller .
'And what good would that do ? '
See here , ’ said <NAME> , producing a shilling .
You won ’ t give me nothing ? ’ cried the old woman .
<NAME> Micawber is going to <NAME> .
‘ Who dares apprehend me ? ’ said <NAME> .
Terms moderate , and could be taken for a month only , if required .
Oh , no , I do n't think so ! ''
As if the estrangement between them had come of any culpability of hers .
but I hain ’ t a willin , ’ replied a voice .
‘ But I might have known that , from the uncommon likeness .
<NAME> <NAME> had by this time alighted , and was offering his hand .
‘ Look ! ’ he said , holding up his shoes and gaiters .
'That 's a pleasant life , is n't it ?
You are ready at all times to go anywhere , and do anything .
Only a few feeble stragglers said Yes : among them <NAME> .
But he is denounced -- and gravely -- by the <NAME> and <NAME> .
“ Now , I 'll tell you a piece of information .
One man spends his fortune in one way , and another in another .
She negligently calls him back .
It 's twice the size of <NAME> .
She stepped forward , and pressed the passive hand that lay upon the coverlet .
He scarcely seemed to be the prisoner .
I make it the object of my life . ''
Here is <NAME> , too , loves music from his soul .
<NAME> shook the hand warmly .
'Do n't you -- do n't you know me ? '
`` And you do n't think the patient would object to him ? ''
‘ It removes a mountain from my breast .
With which she presented it sulkily enough .
Where are we going , <NAME> ? ''
So glad to see you .
cried a tremulous voice in the rear .
‘ The one I was always going to write to .
It knows that that poor unfortunate man , <NAME> , has been sadly used .
But with a doubtful glance at <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> soon afterwards appeared and made us merry for an hour .
‘ But you are tired , sir .
My <NAME> 's place has been extremely dreary .
But some of the girls made game to be their brothers .
‘ To find bail , sir. ’ ‘ Yes .
It was as blank a house inside as outside .
‘ Nobody but you , ’ retorted Mrs. Pott , with asperity .
I have no doubt he is surprised that I do n't .
I suppress names for the present .
‘ Not at all , I thank you , ’ answered <NAME> .
I have never forgotten it .
I have none to make , and nothing to hope now .
I know he has a room to let .
now I -- ’ His flying off at a tangent was indisputably natural .
`` Husband a law-stationer and a friend of my own , '' says <NAME> .
Or perhaps this IS the Desert of <NAME> !
<NAME> ’ t I said , Take me and get me sworn to it ?
I can ’ t say fairer than that .
`` <NAME> , '' continues <NAME> , `` wait a bit ! ''
My poverty will not bear competition with their money .
I am a great deal better , thank you !
‘ I -- I have so much to do .
<NAME> <NAME> returns early in the day .
It is for me to speak now .
‘ Indeed ! ’ replied his new acquaintance .
Of the disinterestedness of their intentions towards <NAME> , I say nothing .
It ’ s all along of you .
Here , if you please , ’ was the reply .
`` What right have you to be dismal ?
`` It has never been more than a family anecdote . ''
‘ Now you sir ! ’ cried <NAME> .
Rough-shod if need be , smooth-shod if that will do , but ride on !
‘ Was that <NAME> thought ? ’ said I , delighted .
Accused of robbing a live man ! ’ said <NAME> , with great indignation .
‘ I could have loved him , and asked no return .
‘ You have just come home from <NAME> , ’ said I .
`` May I ask , sir , what is -- '' `` Coavinses ? ''
Then old <NAME> stood out to dance with Mrs. Fezziwig .
‘ I love them too , sir , ’ said <NAME> .
He paused for any expression of interest , but paused in vain .
The entry was scarcely completed when they reached the <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> ( by a very remarkable coincidence ) is of exactly that opinion .
I had put them at a distance , and accepted my inevitable place .
<NAME> <NAME> says nothing , but stands , ever , near the old portmanteau .
<NAME> remained silent for some minutes , with <NAME> sitting close beside her .
Any what ? ’ said my aunt , sharply .
<NAME> , la , la ; <NAME> , la , la !
Oh , I assure you to the greatest advantage ! ''
`` I do n't say that , '' returned <NAME> gravely .
Not only is the day waning , but the year .
‘ My dear Jane ! ’ cried my mother .
'To be able to do that , you depend upon me .
My young heart had no room in its homage for any such poor reference .
The associations with me would be disagreeable .
Good-evening , <NAME> ! ’ and the lieutenant bounced out of the room .
‘ <NAME> down ! ’ cried Mrs. Sparsit .
Quoted verses respecting self and young Gazelle .
‘ Circumstances conspire to help him .
I never was so happy .
‘ Pray do not take it , dear .
I know nothing about times .
She has been greatly missed there , I understand . ''
‘ Oh , thank you , <NAME> !
But I 'll follow the other .
She went through with whatever duty she had to do .
‘ Is the gentleman from <NAME> indoors ?
So we get on , we do n't know how , but somehow . ''
‘ He is to be pitied , ma ’ am .
The parlour-fire ticked in the grate .
It is by agreement included in his fare .
‘ Where am I to sleep to-night ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
Sometimes he hung it loose round his neck .
It was like your ill nature .
The seats , instead of stretching from end to end , are placed crosswise .
From our marriage day I was his dread , and that she made me .
‘ Well then , all in to begin ! ’ cried <NAME> .
‘ Besides , <NAME> , ask yourself what he would be without his sister .
I am the head-boy , now !
`` It ca n't last for ever , <NAME> .
Two in family , and see very little company .
‘ He has such extraordinary spirits !
<NAME> <NAME> 's grandfather is likewise of the party .
And what occupation does this young woman pursue , <NAME> ?
As if he felt himself full to the throat with affronting sentiments .
‘ Score it under , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> ’ t ask me why , for I don ’ t know .
The street ’ s lined vith ‘ em .
That ’ s what he calls running me up , he do .
I want you to consider .
My work is my business .
I tell you it rankles in you .
‘ He is going , ’ murmured <NAME> .
Not a word had been exchanged .
`` Did he do it on purpose ? ''
Not the least. ’ Here the small servant had another cough .
<NAME> at us -- look at us ! ''
“ I 'll tell you , <NAME> .
‘ Yes , it ’ s always so ! ’ she said .
cried <NAME> , breaking fiercely from the Jew .
‘ I neyver heard such an insufferable riot .
'Ay , I do , ' returned the girl , meeting his gaze .
Light it at mine , which is in perfect order .
‘ In the afternoon , tell them .
<NAME> blushes among the fruits of the country of the magic bean-stalk ?
It was the pattern of room always to be found in such a house .
I don ’ t think this is to be done by one man .
`` She 's been at it pretty well all night , sir . ''
It may take time , but we shall have ’ em .
‘ Oh , pretty well , ’ said <NAME> .
For what purpose opened , I will mention presently .
I asked <NAME> what had made their parents choose this profession for them .
<NAME> , come , <NAME> , we must not fence and parry now .
‘ I was only thinking , mama , ’ answered <NAME> .
‘ Hold your tongue , ’ interposed <NAME> .
Allow me -- <NAME> , will you permit me ?
The name of the sister of an old pupil of mine .
‘ Oh no , she has not chosen .
Mr Toots and <NAME> had arrived at last .
Be sure to tell them , that you left me calm and happy .
Mrs. <NAME> has known trouble .
“ Laws of the game ! ” said he .
Therefore I accept of <NAME> 's proposals .
Three of the doors she opened swiftly , and looked in .
This was a courage that <NAME> so little comprehended as to mistake for weakness .
Half a year had passed over , and he was still undiscovered .
'Press on , press on , ' cried <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> much , <NAME> , dear , too much !
<NAME> said he knew it .
Here 's old <NAME> on the flat of his back , by the <NAME> .
‘ I hope you are well ?
He could not deny this , and indeed was very reasonable throughout .
`` You mean of me , sir . ''
Here , <NAME> ! ’ ‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
I may never see her again .
I had not seen <NAME> for some time .
You now know all , both worst and best .
Perhaps , to observe whether he had any spectre on his conscience .
‘ But I was his pardner .
‘ Where are you going ? ’ said <NAME> .
I can not shut my eyes to those facts .
He referred to them , as if she were lying in our presence .
I should wery much like to see your mother-in-law born again .
<NAME> and <NAME> has passed into a joke .
`` I trust implicitly to you , '' I said .
a sight presented itself that struck him dumb and motionless .
‘ Didn ’ t you see <NAME> ? ’ ‘ No !
We were all of us up to that .
The female prisoners were occupied in needlework .
He answered , as if she had spoken .
<NAME> , lass , and a bright good law !
what is to be done ? '
Now , are you contented , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , <NAME> .
Mr Wegg , I ’ m thirty-two , and a bachelor .
But we must look at <NAME> house now .
‘ What have you done ? ’ retorted <NAME> .
If he likes to fly a kite sometimes , what of that !
`` All right now , '' returns the trooper .
Consequently , that new light had gone sputtering out .
But , my friends , have we partaken of anything else ?
Whom I had looked for , I do n't know .
How do you do sir ?
I , I , to deceive <NAME> !
And if so , was not that a proof of its baselessness ?
<NAME> 'ticed him away to-night .
`` Who , and what are you ? ''
And there ’ s one thing more .
I did so , as I am sure .
‘ His father ’ s name , <NAME> , and his grandfather ’ s !
‘ You had better see , ’ said the invisible female .
And why do we need refreshment , my friends ?
Says you just now , <NAME> here .
Your mother succeeded ; she forgot it soon .
I could not deny <NAME> and my own heart .
She wrote , by return of post , to me .
Can I do nothing for you ? ’ ‘ Nothing just now .
‘ I hope you have , too , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
`` I dread one person very much . ''
This timely reminder effectually stopped the conversation .
This idea , however , he abandoned .
`` These are very long lies , '' mademoiselle interposes .
What am I to do ?
Has a dead man any use for money ?
`` A quarter to it , '' said <NAME> .
He is so droll , that <NAME> .
‘ Partly open , my Lord , ’ said <NAME> .
You -- you would n't perhaps object to admit that ?
His heart was wounded ; he was touched ; he was in love .
‘ <NAME> d ’ ye do , <NAME> ? ’ said Mr Toots .
How can I , imperceptibly , have changed , I wonder !
She admired her daughter , and was afraid of her .
<NAME> ’ t cry ! ’ said <NAME> .
All the servants in the meantime , have been breakfasting below .
<NAME> and Mrs. Kenwigs were at supper .
Do you know ? ’ urged <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> quite a family building ; don ’ t it ?
You will know little or nothing about me .
Warrant of attorney -- take care of that .
I can ’ t say what you may ha ’ done !
‘ Seen her ! ’ cried the small servant .
‘ <NAME> Poll Parroting ! ’ he vociferated , in return .
'Yes , he does , ' growled <NAME> .
Do you ? ’ ‘ Do I ! ’ returned <NAME> .
The visitor , however , brought himself up safely on the door-mat .
She was as true and earnest in the matter as <NAME> himself could be .
'Everything you have had , has been well aired , sir . '
Prove it , will you -- that ’ s all .
It is hidden with great pains , but it is in him .
No father and mother were bound up in her , poor soul .
Now , what should she give it him for ?
he gruffly cried to her .
‘ Never mind ! ’ thought <NAME> , resolutely .
<NAME> <NAME> is a stranger , and you should respect the obligations of hospitality .
'Oh , <NAME> , such fine young chaps as them ! '
‘ It ’ s not above-board and it ’ s not fair .
Tears never yet wound up a clock , or worked a steam ingin ’ .
‘ Deputy , ’ says <NAME> , with a nod .
said <NAME> , with a smile .
`` A levelling age is not favourable to deportment .
Again our charge was the least anxious of the party .
The phrase , rendered into plain <NAME> , signifieth , cleaning his boots .
Of course you have , ma ’ am , ’ said my aunt .
It induced me to hope that <NAME> meant us for one another .
Which one that is , do n't matter . '
there ’ s the other gone next !
Half a quarter of a moment !
There has been chattering and clattering enough between them , but to no purpose .
The chink of the money has an attraction for her greedy ears .
‘ Said the infant negroes were little humbugs , ’ repeated Mrs. Weller .
Something of the same spirit pervades all the Institutions at <NAME> .
‘ To business , ’ he then continued .
For now , indeed , it was no fancy .
There was a charming idea in that .
‘ How can you , <NAME> and <NAME> !
Of dawn , and daybreak , and the rising of the sun .
If he had known , if he had known !
I an ’ t a <NAME> .
I still saw the snow drifting in ; but nothing else was there .
<NAME> , take three of them boys between you and the gentleman .
To my knowledge I never heard it .
I have endured everything here but humiliation .
He had a kind face .
<NAME> movements come upon their features as the shadows of leaves play there .
You are their champion , and assert their rights .
But he could not look at her , and not be afraid of her .
‘ What <NAME> do you mean ? ’ answered <NAME> .
‘ Lord bless me , ’ said the lady of the caravan .
<NAME> , but he was a brave boy to drink .
What order of architecture , if one may say so .
‘ Live and learn , you know .
‘ She is a remarkable woman .
What did you say his name was ? ’ ‘ Wrayburn .
replied Mrs. Bolter , extending her hand .
Will you begone ? ’ Mrs Quilp durst only make a gesture of entreaty .
It will not surprise you , it will not displease you .
Mr <NAME> , on recognising him , immediately stopped the coach .
It was off my mind .
‘ <NAME> ! ’ said the <NAME> , tenderly taking her in his hands .
‘ No , but are you ? ’ said the old gentleman .
There will be an inquest , and you will be asked the question .
you seem to have been very systematic in your proceedings .
Mrs. <NAME> was so nervous that she could hardly remember her part .
‘ “ Of course it is , ” rejoined the guard .
‘ Come , <NAME> ! ’ said he , with great suavity .
You are completely mistaken. ’ ‘ I mistaken , sir ! ’ said <NAME> .
Yet she knew that he took a great interest in <NAME> and her fortunes .
It beckoned <NAME> to approach , which he did .
`` Why , now I 'll tell you , <NAME> , '' he replied .
He could hardly trust the evidence of his senses .
‘ An only child ? ’ ‘ No there was another .
`` I shall not put him to the proof , '' said my guardian .
A knife and some odd halfpence are all he finds .
Oh , dear me , dear me !
But I will not be quite tamed , and made submissive .
‘ I think you ought to see him , ’ replied Mrs. Cluppins .
We were much relieved , under these circumstances , when Mrs. <NAME> left off .
Here ’ s May the -- ’ ‘ Pshaw ! ’ interposed the other .
You must let me put you in a room at the back here .
You do n't know how much need I have to-night . ''
The dinner was a most doleful breakdown .
Day and night again , day and night again .
I propose , ’ returned that estimable man , ‘ to insult him openly .
This was all the establishment .
I suppose there was nothing in ‘ em .
It 's neither , my friend , neither .
Look at your tenants down the <NAME> here .
'Nothing , ' said <NAME> , releasing his hold of <NAME> .
His expectations were disappointed , however , for the picture had been removed .
I am very glad to take your hand , sir .
I never attested any such document .
‘ I am very sorry , ’ she said .
'Could you give my boy and me a lift as far as there ? '
Eight and six in half a sovereign , <NAME> , and eighteenpence out ! ''
‘ Hi , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> ! ’ <NAME> make another effort .
Let me share its felicity sometimes , and what do I sacrifice ?
<NAME> , impelled by innocence , she asks , `` What for ? ''
<NAME> ’ t say I said you did .
I never said nothink to you .
<NAME> <NAME> , it turns me cold to see you ! ’ ‘ What !
And oh , she was so frightened !
I wish he was blind .
We have been more like sisters than <NAME> and child. ’ ‘ J .
It is past ten when <NAME> begs <NAME> to ring for candles .
‘ The wery same , ’ replied <NAME> .
You all know this man <NAME> .
<NAME> ’ t you mind about me .
I know many parts of the country well .
<NAME> -- Mis- ’ ‘ Demeanour ? ’ suggested <NAME> .
Not in regular government pay and employment , to lay traps ?
Then the sick woman was ready for bed .
Death of my life , that ’ s a criminal indeed .
It was for me to guard this sisterly affection with religious care .
Now , <NAME> , though not shabby , did look mean .
They turned , and <NAME> said , Here was <NAME> coming !
‘ I see you want it .
‘ Go along with you this minute .
Can I live anywhere else ?
Let me ask you a question .
The strangest thing I ever heard !
There are five-and-twenty guineas in this bag .
And what ’ s this with a grey gown and a black velvet cap ?
‘ I am glad to hear it .
If he lives , he will , <NAME> .
‘ Not by inquiry , ’ said the gentleman shaking his head .
‘ I am not worth it .
‘ What ’ s the matter ? ’ inquired Wardle .
He obeyed , and took the tripod recently vacated by <NAME> Stiltstalking .
<NAME> <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
Say I was very well and very happy .
I wondered how he knew that .
There was no light in the room save that which the fire afforded .
cried <NAME> ; 'let me run away and die in the fields .
He is indifferent to everything but his calling .
<NAME> stands staring and is still staring when she recovers herself .
'Wot do you look at a man so for ? '
<NAME> <NAME> is a very respectable man .
It can not be real -- and yet I -- I am awake !
I entreat of you let us walk round this place again .
It is impossible to describe the thrilling effect produced by this striking ceremony .
You must discard the word <NAME> altogether .
As if I didn ’ t know better than that !
`` What 's gone of your father and your mother , eh ? ''
The faster , the more money there will be to drink .
<NAME> , I am ashamed of you !
I am certain of success .
In everything that made my love of any worth or value in your sight .
This boy must be put through a few preliminary paces .
asked the gentleman , who seemed to pity her .
And so does Mr Headstone !
‘ Not chops ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , ’ I said .
As well she may , to find herself dressing under the circumstances .
‘ Is it a good road ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
I love <NAME> to that extent -- ’ ‘ Pooh !
I considered <NAME> wretched company .
‘ Hope I see you well , sir .
I say to you it is .
I am not going to begin to be polite now , about old Bounderby .
Do have a mug of beer .
After a long silence between them , <NAME> resumed the talk .
of course I mean in <NAME> .
I feel obliged to him for possessing it .
He said , what was it after all ?
I can not permit you to say so. ’ ‘ Thank you , madam .
`` I think I does , '' says Jo .
‘ Oh , my loved husband ! ’ said <NAME> .
What do I know , <NAME> ?
THE <NAME> slowly , gravely , silently , approached .
I remember that evening well .
‘ <NAME> ? ’ cried <NAME> , taking out his purse .
‘ This does you credit , <NAME> , ’ returned the questioner .
I hope you are well , sir , I hope you are well .
My troubles has made me contrary .
’ <NAME> ’ t kep ’ up that way .
I would if I was them .
I don ’ t know what I could say more if I tried .
‘ Where ’ s <NAME> , then ? ’ He didn ’ t know .
I will try to pin myself to mine .
‘ <NAME> , I am self-repressed again .
I promised him that I would walk there on a Sunday .
It did n't worry me , ma'am , ' said <NAME> .
My place and use are here .
‘ My dooty here , sir , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ is done .
<NAME> <NAME> says nothing either way .
There were reasons for its increase ; it had grown and strengthened gradually .
‘ <NAME> said ! ’ ‘ So mild and gentle , ’ said <NAME> .
May you long live to share it with me ! ''
‘ Well , it is owing to him , ’ returned <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> , <NAME> ! ’ said <NAME> , ‘ what is it ?
You don ’ t know old <NAME> yet , I find .
But , for all that , they had a very pleasant walk .
`` Must have cost a sight of money .
‘ <NAME> , you were , ’ said Mr Venus .
Have you quite forgotten her ?
She was very kind to me .
Little <NAME> was sitting by the fire , with her hands before her face .
Low voices close at hand .
The assistants were paralysed with wonder ; the boys with fear .
'Tell him to let me go , <NAME> .
‘ There your expressive countenance speaks indeed ! ’ cried <NAME> .
My friends , why do I wish for peace ?
‘ Well ? ’ echoed Mrs Flintwinch again .
O , look at her , dear <NAME> !
Say good night ! ” “ Good night !
‘ And your fare down , I have paid , ’ growled <NAME> .
Why do you not cool yourself in that stream now ?
‘ I believe that is your writing , <NAME> ? ’ said <NAME> .
He never told them what he thought , or where he went .
‘ Why not sheer off ? ’ said the <NAME> .
‘ You ’ ll throttle me , master , ’ whispered the boy .
'Bill had him on his back , and scudded like the wind .
a boy of no merit whatever !
‘ Where but here in this house ?
<NAME> <NAME> takes upon himself to reply , `` Yes , ma'am .
He don ’ t know what it is to have a father .
This is an occasion that makes a man speculate on all he has lost .
<NAME> barked madly all the time .
‘ I should like to know how we should ever get on without her .
And the birds I hear !
‘ Everybody , ’ he said , ‘ shall be remembered .
All eyes were turned in the direction of the sally-port .
She won the game , and I dealt .
Then she remembered him , and hoped his lady-mother was well .
‘ In company with me and my friend in the next room .
‘ Better now , my pretty ! ’ said the <NAME> .
It was but the hand of a dead child .
‘ What work , then ? ’ I asked .
They were all expressions of pain .
‘ I had , at one time , certainly , ’ said <NAME> .
The circumstances are hardly favourable .
Thus we held on , speaking little , for four or five dull miles .
There ’ s been a gen ’ lm ’ n too .
'Then what the devil is to be done ? '
‘ Not aware of being different ! ’ retorted Mr Alfred Lammle .
<NAME> ’ s in the next room .
cried the <NAME> , making a note of the statement .
' I will do my endeavours , sir , ' replied <NAME> .
One thing troubled me much , after we had fallen into this quiet train .
‘ I beg your pardon , ’ interposes <NAME> .
She took him by the hand and led him on .
He touched me gently on the forehead , and went out .
I rang to tell you that .
What else should I have expected ?
<NAME> another question of the subordinate before his first is dry !
<NAME> and my reparation before all !
She commended him on her death-bed to her child ’ s care .
‘ I thought you would have been pleased , ’ said <NAME> .
We have been visiting , and resting here and there .
says <NAME> , smoking on .
‘ “ Stand off ! ” shrieked the old man .
‘ The moral influences are beginning to work .
`` And where might it be now ? ''
'You were not here last Sunday night , ' he said .
You ’ ll go down just as if I was there .
I require it as my right .
Neither of us spoke of the boat , but we both thought of it .
Let us stretch the hour or two .
Both the women followed ; the second woman being The Vengeance .
<NAME> high society , ’ he said , warming his legs .
‘ Bless us ! ’ exclaimed <NAME> , with a start .
His missus dies , and leaves him four hundred pound .
‘ Not another word , ’ said <NAME> .
'Then you wo n't have it , ' replied <NAME> .
‘ Hast thou come back again ! ’ Such a woman !
‘ Shall I go away , aunt ? ’ I asked , trembling .
I have been longing and longing to tell you .
‘ <NAME> into the office , my -- my -- dear .
<NAME> relaxing , took a little more of the chair , and smiled graciously .
Not being that yet , I said no very freely .
He put his hand suddenly to his heart , and looked at <NAME> .
‘ No , no , no , ’ added Emily hastily .
You have spoken of my mother .
As open as I was to <NAME> , I am to you .
It showed them only the empty staircase , and their own white faces .
There ’ s no chance of his comrade and friend returning .
He repeated the treatment every hour , being very determined with <NAME> .
‘ I am very confident , <NAME> .
‘ The <NAME> Mayor , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ for ever !
The smiles became mutual , and the milk-punch was gradually and cheerfully disposed of .
Scraps of old copy-books and exercises litter the dirty floor .
<NAME> , late Nockemorf , sent for .
'Nothing at all , ' replied the doctor .
I think he must be going to look for it .
Besides which , <NAME> do n't like it .
A wretched evening is beginning to close in .
Take with her the little home she brings you .
‘ Well , ma ’ am , how do you do ?
‘ I didn ’ t take it , ’ the dismal youth replied .
Did you ever hear of <NAME> and <NAME> ?
‘ And how ’ s father ? ’ said <NAME> .
‘ How could it be ? ’ replied his nurse .
To be vigilant in making themselves respected .
<NAME> Tippins rises to go , and <NAME> follows her leader .
Take it away from her , take it away ! '
<NAME> laughed , and fell to smoking with his eyes shut .
‘ On the spot. ’ ‘ I know ’ d it !
I put it away , as well as I could .
‘ No ! ’ said <NAME> , plumply .
I am quite a little serious thing now , and not teasing you .
<NAME> was quite as earnest as he .
Now you are afraid of what 's coming . ''
<NAME> to yourself , ma'am , for being so ready to pay 'em !
I thought it was always usual to send them paupers in carts . '
She will not speak , it is plain .
I pulled through it , though nobody threw me out a rope .
What else are you made for ?
pursued <NAME> , mad with rage .
‘ Beats the chimbley-pots , <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> , touching his hat .
He sat , with folded hands , upon his pedestal , silently listening .
Let us see who tires first .
‘ Ask Georgiana , my soul , ’ replied his wife .
She and her three fair girls , all so busy about me .
`` You know <NAME> , my dear , '' said my guardian .
I stood still , and hung my head .
Your time and mine may be a long one yet .
<NAME> <NAME> in the meanwhile takes a pinch of snuff .
suggests <NAME> , composedly drinking .
He was very poor , I suppose ? ''
O yes , <NAME> shyly believed she could almost answer for it .
‘ <NAME> where did a circumstance so very extraordinary happen ? ’ Twemlow hesitates .
His own father ain ’ t good enough for him .
`` He has purchased opium of me for the last year and a half .
My dear , I will wait upon him with the greatest pleasure . ''
She has settled down to the life , and _she_ don ’ t mind .
Not <NAME> -- <NAME> , you know .
I strove against the knowledge , but quite in vain .
Em ’ ly told her , and she -- took her home .
I was puzzled how to answer , but he helped me with a word .
Be sure you always give father his full due .
( Now , attend here , <NAME> , my dear . )
I can not bear to see this grief .
And when he 's tired he goes to bed himself .
‘ What I want to say , is .
‘ They seem to know your ways here , ’ observed <NAME> .
'Take care of that , and do the most you can with it .
<NAME> Evans his name is , sir .
‘ Has anybody seen <NAME> ? ’ ‘ I have , ’ said <NAME> .
It ’ s as well known to me as he was himself .
‘ So I do , ’ replied <NAME> .
Did you hear what he let fall the other day when we were there ?
Let me stay too ! ’ ‘ No , no , ’ said <NAME> .
You will save them all. ” “ Heaven grant I may , <NAME> !
Range the books upon the shelves , <NAME> .
‘ You ’ re a very small chap ; ’ said Mr Toots .
`` Tell her and cut it short . ''
There are the nobly independent beggars too .
And I saw them end .
<NAME> , come ; say you would n't . '
But never mind , sir , never mind .
He had never thought of going away , when he sent me for it .
<NAME> flushed and started , and <NAME> put her finger on her lip .
‘ You know how it is .
<NAME> , so beautiful and stately , but so cold and so repelling .
‘ <NAME> amputation ? ’ ‘ Just so , ’ says Mr Wegg .
`` Yes , I know something of it .
Little <NAME> ’ s lover , however , was not a <NAME> .
'Lie down , you stupid brute !
I know it is so .
‘ So much the more necessairy is a Peck , ’ returned <NAME> .
I kissed him and dried my eyes .
‘ You shall proceed in your own way .
The good lady ’ s surprise , however , did not end here .
She came for money to-night .
I never went out at all .
‘ No ! ’ rejoined <NAME> , wringing his hands .
‘ That can ’ t be the spot too ? ’ said <NAME> .
O ’ course there was though , and to cut off with it arterwards .
‘ There , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ it ’ s too late now .
‘ And well , I -- I trust she will be soon .
Now , is there anything more ? ’ ‘ Nothing , ’ rejoined <NAME> .
They 'd have wasted it , if it had n't been for me . ''
He begged me to present his compliments .
`` I ref-use his money all togezzer . ''
He is a negro—very black indeed .
<NAME> , rage , defiance , recklessness , look here !
Another sign that you attend to me. ’ She moves her hand once more .
‘ Only <NAME> of <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Don ’ t say that ! ’ he replied .
‘ Gentlemen , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ rise for <NAME> !
I know I need but ask of their generosity , to have .
It will never do , sitting here .
My mind hangs about her ring very uneasily to-night .
She ’ s too good a creetur for me , <NAME> .
I don ’ t know where to begin .
‘ It ’ s nothing to me , sir , by rights .
I confided in you about her .
`` No , no , I know , I know , sir .
I was not allowed to call him uncle , under the severest penalties .
'Where do you think the gentleman has come from , <NAME> ? '
It will not last much longer .
‘ <NAME> ’ partickler , <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> .
We ’ ll look about for a second-hand stool , sir .
The schoolmaster ’ s abroad. ’ ‘ The schoolmaster ? ’ ‘ Ay !
You ’ ll be sure to be stirring early and go with us ?
<NAME> saw no reason why he should not say ‘ Halloa ! ’ too .
She stopped , and listened to it as if it were music .
<NAME> <NAME> did as he was asked and seemed to read it every word .
<NAME> knights and warriors looked scowling on them .
Having settled this with myself , I fell asleep .
And it was my mother , cold and dead .
<NAME> can go and whisper secrets to a mad bull .
We were speaking of <NAME> .
You will excuse me , I know , being so much occupied .
But this is a sort of dignity that may be thrust upon one .
Well , I am afraid I am not . ''
To this letter , I received an answer by return of post .
Where in the world was there a room so full of quiet joy !
‘ This is your room , sir , ’ said the chambermaid .
These were perplexities and contradictions that I could not account for .
‘ Why do you come here ?
Something of the awfulness , even of Death itself , is referable to this .
‘ I am not dreadful now , <NAME> ? ’ said I , tenderly .
And they stole cautiously towards the house .
I knew her father well .
‘ So th ’ are , so th ’ are ! ’ cried <NAME> .
‘ Either in February or March , ’ replied Mrs. <NAME> .
With Mr <NAME> in my mind , I went on .
I followed next to her , and <NAME> came last .
But I am sorry to repeat , it is impossible .
‘ I want to know his name ! ’ I heard said once more .
<NAME> <NAME> 's gravity has now attained its profoundest point .
`` Why , what had you been doing ? ''
I undertook the delivery of this invitation .
Lying hidden at her waist , was a sharpened dagger .
As I went down stairs I distinctly heard them give a suppressed cheer .
She has nothing left but her husband ’ s income .
It had not even that recommendation , ’ said <NAME> ‘ Mrs .
<NAME> who had no restraint upon their love , and freely showed it .
Even yet I could not recall a single feature , but I knew him !
<NAME> , also , silently withdrew and came back no more .
Some windows and doors are opened , and people come out to look .
Mrs. <NAME> pushed forward by Mrs. Perkins .
‘ Come to take you home to-morrow , ’ replied <NAME> .
'Now stop quietly where you are , will you ? '
It would be night again before they reached their place of destination .
It was very dark ; why did n't they bring a light ?
That ’ s all. ’ ‘ Stop ! ’ cried <NAME> .
Would I take that weight -- in any metal -- for the old girl ?
In the same poor girl !
You ’ ll see something rather worth seeing , in there .
I know it very well .
Not in the intended and expected way .
Do n't let her lift me up to get it round me .
‘ And me , ’ interposed his wife .
‘ Positively not. ’ ‘ And did I say it WAS enough ?
‘ Can there be anybody there ! ’ asked <NAME> , in alarm .
The other object , to elude pursuit and to be lost .
As it is , you did wrong .
<NAME> is my name , sir -- <NAME> of the 43rd .
'No one else , <NAME> , ' replied the beadle .
Really surprised , my dear <NAME> ? ''
It is my secret , in trust for <NAME> and the family .
‘ I ’ m pretty sure of that .
<NAME> ’ s grave. ’ But he did not respond with any tenderness .
<NAME> is frightfully expensive and dissipated .
‘ <NAME> ’ t hurry , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
You came for me , no doubt ? ''
<NAME> has quite departed from my breast .
‘ I thank him from my heart , ’ said <NAME> .
Everything prepared for holding his Court .
My dear , what has brought you here ?
You see that I am occupied with these gentlemen .
`` He was drowned long before .
`` I dare say it is , <NAME> .
<NAME> has made his retort with an abruptness not at all polite .
The watch is set at seven in the evening .
You must keep them secret .
All else grows dim , and fades away .
And is not that making an admission that his nature is a generous one ?
I will write too , and -- But stay !
‘ <NAME> , widow , one child , and one eye .
And now he ’ s come into the business .
To be sent in three weeks ’ time .
And <NAME> is come back a woman .
He stands precociously possessed of centuries of owlish wisdom .
`` I ordered it to be put up there , '' replies <NAME> .
‘ Ay , ay ! ’ said <NAME> , greatly relieved and pleased .
‘ I am not above a parcel. ’ ‘ Above a parcel !
All the other furniture is plain and serviceable , you perceive .
No time ain ’ t been lost , on any hand .
I entreated <NAME> to see me , that evening .
I almost feel as if she had . '
He locked himself up as carefully as he locked up the <NAME> debtors .
And so said Mr Abel .
She was found lying in the street .
'That 's it , my dear , ' replied the Jew in a whisper .
It was right not to give way before him .
But they are not going to-day. ’ ‘ Oh !
The market was ‘ rigged ’ in various artful ways .
‘ Him who is coming to court and marry me , ’ returned <NAME> .
She could always answer , she replied , for my meaning nothing wrong .
Do n't I never mean for to go to church ?
But the child was puzzled , and could not tell what to say .
‘ That sprung up between us .
<NAME> was glad to be rid of them .
‘ I see what ye mean now .
'He has been hurt already , ' said the old gentleman in conclusion .
She motioned to <NAME> to be seated .
'Wery easy disposed of , if it is , ' remarked <NAME> .
You haven ’ t got any appointment , you know , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> detained at <NAME> ’ s , ’ replied <NAME> .
‘ Fever , ’ he sullenly replies , without looking up .
“ <NAME> knowed <NAME> that way .
`` Nemo is <NAME> for no one . ''
I am used to this .
He felt inclined to speak to her , and call her to him .
Close after her came <NAME> in a flaming rage .
Mrs. <NAME> repeated , with <NAME> .
'So you wanted to get away , my dear , did you ? '
‘ I forgive you , my dear boy .
There , eat it up. ’ This was soon done .
'He did , sir , ' replied <NAME> .
There was nothing I could tell her .
'Thank you , sir , said <NAME> .
said <NAME> to the girl .
‘ A long way off , I believe ?
'This is unkind , mother , ' said <NAME> .
<NAME> got the monitor-medal by being umble .
‘ Are they pointing ? ’ ‘ No , no ; not now .
Such relations was no good to me , then .
I felt quite wicked in my dirt and dust , with my tangled hair .
His clients want <NAME> ; he is all in all .
and why they talk instead of grunting ?
I don ’ t reproach you , father .
`` And patience has sat upon it a long time , '' said <NAME> .
If they were ever to get away unseen , that was the very moment .
All the boys blew before their time .
‘ Or both , ’ said <NAME> .
Is that the case ? ’ but said never a word .
‘ I require no assistance but yours .
‘ That can ’ t very well be , ’ observed <NAME> .
<NAME> , and groan , and look at me !
I instantly proposed his health .
He 's a gentleman , if you please , this villain .
to purchase her redemption from endless misery , if she could .
That 's all the good it is , Mrs .
What a fascinating child it is ! ''
Hoo be all wi ’ ye ?
Well , you generally know best .
‘ To be sure it was , ’ replied <NAME> .
‘ Come , sir , ’ said Mrs. Crupp .
‘ They are all under the same parental and affectionate treatment .
You are so extremely brown , my dear Copperfield !
The sole remaining question then is : Shall I marry him ?
Still , the red light burns steadily .
I have felt the cold here .
He must have been a green one .
I thought so , ’ said <NAME> , more affably than before .
‘ Look here ! ’ taking something out .
You mean well , but are tiresome .
<NAME> could have doubted their being twin brothers .
A novelty would be very desirable .
In my troublous sleep I ha ’ known thee still to be there .
There was a heavy lumbering of wheels within hearing .
‘ And when did you leave <NAME> , reverend sir ? ’ That morning .
‘ I might as well have stated it to the wall .
‘ Indeed , I know she is .
Even these clerks were laughing .
Some pride is left in me even yet . ''
You tell me <NAME> got killed .
'If you please , sir , ' said <NAME> .
It was the first glimpse of sociality the host had had for many days .
That was very kind of him ; so like him too !
rejoined the other , getting into his cart .
‘ You air , air you , sir ? ’ inquired <NAME> firmly .
He would try the signal again .
<NAME> was likewise always modest and self-depreciatory -- in his way .
“ <NAME> , it _was_ I .
The dwarf shut himself up again , and sprang once more into his hammock .
They have prepared him for this , all day .
You know what I mean , ’ said <NAME> .
She had not thought about it .
My guardian begged them to be seated , and they all sat down .
If YOU think so , ’ said I .
“ What do you say , <NAME> ? ” They both listened .
You may tell him so , with my compliments .
Many of the shops were shut , and the town was dull .
That you must never forget me .
How can we stand amazed at poor <NAME> ?
A weak conclusion which , however , derived some appearance of strength from disdain .
‘ Is there -- ’ ‘ Well ! ’ said <NAME> .
The finding of a treasure .
Mrs. Micawber was quite as elastic .
Some -- and they were not a few -- knelt down .
I see them speaking to her in the street .
‘ Yes , I think it is , ’ resumed <NAME> .
'Will _he_ be here to-night ? '
But he discreetly affected to see nothing , and addressed <NAME> .
Of Steerforth I said nothing .
Who is this young butcher ?
`` Seems a fate in it , do n't there ? ''
added the <NAME> , with a grin .
I suppose we were company to each other , without talking .
said the Jew , patting her on the neck .
‘ ( She hadn ’ t written her cutting refusal at that time . )
Produced by <NAME> By <NAME> I. I Am <NAME> .
You mean it kindly , I know , but it hurts rather .
His mistress had forgotten him .
And giving up what was offered him here ! ’ exclaimed <NAME> .
Do you know , I think it MUST have been a five-pound note ! ''
I asked <NAME> if any one knew of their coming down together .
‘ I ’ d be torn to pieces first .
<NAME> gracefully held out her hand , in acknowledgment of <NAME> ’ s presence .
She was all Heart And that charming father of hers !
Do you want a good situation for your grand-daughter , master ?
“ <NAME> strike you dead if you do n't ! ” said the man .
It had set in snowing at daybreak , and it now snowed hard .
<NAME> , good-bye ! ’ ‘ Good-bye , Mr Carker .
Seeing it , he poured out and drank another glassful .
<NAME> let us wear it silently .
A person is never known till a person is proved . ''
<NAME> would not deceive her father and mother .
‘ Oh , yes , ’ said the manager ; ‘ a common thing .
‘ Something old , ’ said the gentleman .
‘ How do you do , <NAME> ? ’ said <NAME> .
Will you stand upon your legs , you young devil ? '
The world is all before him where to choose .
She come to <NAME> , and was set ashore at <NAME> .
She called again and listened ; still no answering sound .
‘ Of everything , ’ returned <NAME> .
But not quite , for they never did it .
The <NAME> of the Night 44 .
‘ No , he ain ’ t , ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> forth , <NAME> , in uncompromising colours !
The preparations for my marriage are making , and I shall be married soon .
You have made up your mind ? ’ ‘ Yes , <NAME> have .
‘ You are a highly offensive scoundrel .
‘ What are you Poll Parroting at now ?
‘ <NAME> thot ? ’ said <NAME> ‘ Thot be thy doin ’ .
<NAME> would have been nothing -- <NAME> was well used to that .
“ I ought to give you a reason for fighting , too .
It looks timidly for an explanation .
`` Encourager would perhaps have been a better word , '' said I .
But <NAME> has had his day .
I proposed to <NAME> that morning that we should go and see <NAME> .
All that he has of certainty will be expended when he is fully equipped .
<NAME> , don ’ t come back to us .
‘ You don ’ t regard it from the right point of view .
It is now inclosed in a gentleman ’ s garden .
No other than the poor schoolmaster .
He said so to me , plainly .
You positively must excuse us .
I can answer for one of them with my heart of hearts .
for my heart , or propose to yourself to win the worthless thing ?
A sister ’ s happiness against her husband ’ s gold .
My guardian noticed it and respected it .
laid aside his hat and coat and came up to the fire .
What an insubstantial , happy , foolish time !
‘ You are not really going ? ’ said he , taking <NAME> aside .
`` Old <NAME> , tell me more .
‘ Some unhappy cause of separation .
Oh ! ’ ejaculated <NAME> , suddenly jumping up with a short scream .
Mr Rugg , you know how long ?
“ But it 's not my business , ” said he .
Mrs <NAME> looked suddenly up at him .
I am a <NAME> man .
‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , looking out from under the bed-clothes .
Keep me my usual chair .
<NAME> rose and looked to <NAME> for his escort .
With a weird peep from the doorway , she watches for his looking back .
We have both been biting , and we have both been bitten .
Still you were not satisfied .
`` Heaven bless her and her husband ! ''
Now you ’ ll go , won ’ t you ?
<NAME> , schoolmeasther , show thyself , mun ; dinnot be sheame-feaced .
`` I have n't been out for many months .
I am told on all hands , it 's the system .
I had no resource but to comply .
The figure was behind him .
<NAME> and <NAME> looked on .
says <NAME> in a whisper .
And why does he give it you ?
It was very accurate indeed .
‘ Pray go on , sir , ’ returned <NAME> .
‘ Your servant , sir , ’ said the stranger gentleman .
It made him shudder , and feel very cold .
`` Old girl , '' says <NAME> , `` never mind .
I would have it come and go .
He has been made away with .
My <NAME> 's eyes look at him full .
To which <NAME> retorts , `` Oh , indeed ? ''
‘ Serve it right for being so dear .
Really the person should be more care- ’ ‘ Wait !
`` <NAME> says , ' I do n't know . '
Therefore I can ’ t be put to any inconvenience .
We had first to find out <NAME> 's <NAME> .
<NAME> is <NAME> 's remedy for all things , and why not Legislation 's ?
‘ One of your fine gentlemen he was !
<NAME> both ate and drank almost voraciously .
`` I have just left <NAME> , '' said <NAME> .
'Now it 's loaded , ' said <NAME> , when he had finished .
‘ How would you have had it ?
‘ It sounds less as if you wanted a missionary .
But you and I feel sure that we think of him as he deserves .
On her stupid , cross old <NAME> ’ s arm again .
“ She lived , and found powerful friends .
`` I quite understand that , '' said I .
It is an awful thing to bear .
You must keep it forsooth .
‘ What is money , <NAME> ? ’ he answered .
For an instant , I supposed that the <NAME> was ill .
‘ And never wears your club-button ? ’ said the lieutenant .
I chop it down and burn it in the morning .
Not a word of this ; not a word must be said .
‘ And to talk about birdcages , too ! ’ whimpered the <NAME> .
‘ The very day is auspicious , ’ says Mr Carker .
‘ Yes mum , ’ said the sympathetic Sloppy .
Stepping before them , he looked into the room .
<NAME> _is_ in , and he ’ ll see you , I know .
`` Let her fly away in a high wind on a broomstick ! ''
<NAME> <NAME> was the first to see us .
No , dear love , I am glad of it .
she said with an involuntary contraction of her fine black eyebrows .
‘ I hear a step coming .
‘ I doubt if you ever will .
said <NAME> with no diminution of his rage .
So great the success , so great the imposition .
But it had undergone a surprising transformation .
<NAME> re-entered the <NAME> .
The boys shouted in triumph ; and on they went .
I saw reawakening appetite in the <NAME> nostrils of <NAME> .
I am the son , Mr Meagles , of a hard father and mother .
`` He 's extra-drilled , '' says <NAME> .
'What a delicious thing is a oyster ! '
`` He ca n't say better than that , <NAME> , can he ? ''
and confound you for two wild beasts !
I have seen the world .
Let the <NAME> take care of itself .
‘ I come heer with no hope , and I take away no hope .
I follow it alone to the end , whatever the end be .
‘ So do I , ’ says <NAME> .
His carving is his livelihood .
“ Never you mind , ” retorted <NAME> .
`` That 's such advice as your father would have given you , <NAME> .
‘ He can ’ t remember anything about her , you know , <NAME> .
‘ Nothing but joy to us will come of that marriage .
We have all heard of great surprises of joy .
‘ Let it be as you desire .
'If <NAME> has not done it this time , he will another .
Twenty-four , <NAME> , <NAME> .
Here , he skipped from his left leg on to his right .
‘ But I am afraid I am wandering from the subject .
On the ground of your own merits ?
Early in the afternoon a barge came down .
‘ My name ’ s <NAME> , ’ said that gentleman .
Well ; but do n't cry , ” said the gentle <NAME> .
‘ My sister <NAME> ? ’ said <NAME> .
I did not know what to reply , and glanced dubiously at <NAME> .
Would I do this for every man ?
I said so , and he took me down .
And so it was. ’ ‘ Certainly , ’ interposed <NAME> .
‘ Indeed , I have no doubt of it .
‘ How did I do it ? ’ he inquired .
A loud and violent knocking .
said <NAME> , looking triumphantly at <NAME> .
‘ I have no assistant , my Lord , ’ said the chemist .
( He is so very absent . )
‘ Has it been a busy day , <NAME> ? ’ asked Mrs. Sparsit .
<NAME> road are you takin ’ ?
Are there no itinerant bands ; no wind or stringed instruments ?
‘ Rather a good marriage this , I believe ? ’ said <NAME> .
He had loved <NAME> from the hour of his danger .
Whether he could do anything , without being brought up to something ?
‘ And what is to happen next ? ’ asked <NAME> of the skeleton .
<NAME> anybody present related to him ? ''
But , otherwise , she was quite unchanged .
The last door shuts behind them .
‘ <NAME> ? ’ said the little white-faced boy ( <NAME> in fact ) .
She is fatigued with reading .
‘ Not more than other men , ’ was his short answer .
The stranger was returning , and <NAME> was beside him .
‘ Why , it an ’ t necessary to mention .
`` And who have we got here to-night ? ''
In that gloomy place all the long , dreary night .
'You 're an insolent impertinent fellow .
I think I have seen her so .
`` I was his heir , and this was his house , <NAME> .
Did you ever know a prayer ? ''
'What 's the matter with the boy ? '
Cut it short and tell her . ''
‘ Ha , ha ! ’ laughed <NAME> .
‘ Why shouldn ’ t Mr Cheggs be jealous if he likes ?
It goes to no more than that you suspect this man of the crime .
‘ Well , sir , ’ said the waiter , with an apologetic air .
‘ I went away , dear <NAME> , loving you .
‘ How ’ s your Ma , sir ? ’ said <NAME> .
`` It had been called , before his time , the <NAME> .
`` Yes I do , '' replied the woman .
I hope you don ’ t know what. ’ ‘ Know what !
he little thinks we have parted .
I could only look at him .
The <NAME> becomes an Orphan 1 .
The first is situated in the green and wooded country near <NAME> .
So shall we know the angels in their majesty , after death .
He was very , very , very fond of <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> employed , ’ with another nod .
This is only half the love- making and plotting that have been going forward .
<NAME> acted upon the direction .
A Dissolution of <NAME> XXXIX .
The distance seemed interminable , and the walk was most laborious .
The bed was his own , the room was his own .
The advantage of this particular man is that he never wants sleep .
But he 'll grow , Mrs. Sowerberry -- he 'll grow . '
‘ And then you ran down stairs ? ’ ‘ No .
That , such as it is -- ’ Oh !
The wretched whelp plucked up a ghastly courage , and began to grow defiant .
For I can not see you , <NAME> ; I am blind . ''
“ Look over your hand carefully , <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> atop o ’ that ‘ ere flower-pot , <NAME> .
‘ No , <NAME> ? ’ cried her old friend with some archness .
‘ <NAME> , I said I didn ’ t know .
You think so because I am a little rambling .
All fellow-students of yours , <NAME> , once .
<NAME> , my dear girl ! ’ I said , bending over her .
'No boy in half his senses could venture to speak so to you . '
But no sleep hung upon her own eyes .
I am glad to see you .
‘ Not rebels , nor yet rascals .
<NAME> sent him the particulars , I understand , by return of post .
None but the tough fellows could live through it , <NAME> , at <NAME> .
Them two come in after ye .
I trip over another word .
He therefore responded , with a considerable accession of dignity .
Mrs Podsnap by no means objected .
`` You have not congratulated me on my physician .
It hovers about <NAME> 's door .
‘ I have no such purpose .
“ <NAME> , man , with whom I have exchanged .
Here , <NAME> , wrench the shutter open .
But you shall see some others .
‘ Pray allow me to -- ’ chink , chink , chink .
On Thee his hopes to fix ?
‘ From <NAME> ? ’ said the Doctor .
`` I -- I am glad of that . ''
The old gentleman fired by way of reply .
There had been a violent struggle , perhaps a fight .
said <NAME> , raising his hands and eyes with most impressive solemnity .
`` You hear what she says .
Employment of all sorts is going a-begging , and wages are capital .
Let us hear what it 's all about in presence of <NAME> , <NAME> .
'Then why inflict it on yourself ? '
Yet her voice was just as quiet as before .
' I shall see you again to-night ? '
' I do n't think that would answer my purpose .
The blow , which had no aim , fell upon the air .
<NAME> was my principle in the case of <NAME> and <NAME> .
And he is very great this day .
There , upon her little bed , she lay at rest .
I have had it so long , and I have prized it so much !
And you will not think me unkind because I begin , will you ?
‘ Who ever saw me with her ?
“ Whew ! ” the chemist whistled softly , as he read it .
Whatever I know , you shall know .
`` I dust n't do it , sir .
'You 'll do , <NAME> ; you 'll do now . '
‘ Now , I ’ ll try you again .
Therefore , <NAME> , be careful what you say .
‘ <NAME> , leave it to me , if you please .
‘ My senses ’ idol ! ’ said <NAME> .
‘ I want your sister , ’ she said .
I was going to tell Ma when you interrupted .
‘ Who said it wasn ’ t Number Nine ? ’ said <NAME> .
Or nat ’ ral name ? ’ said <NAME> .
After the lectures you have attended , and the experiments you have seen !
<NAME> comes to ME when it wants me .
Their struggles are towards it .
Too bad , is n't it , <NAME> ? '
<NAME> attention to J. as being beautifully sleek .
Roaring dryer , soaring higher -- Old Clem !
Come in through the shop if t'other door 's out of order ! ''
Very often was no clue .
<NAME> made cowards of us both .
What was it we were talking about ?
‘ I didn ’ t , my Lord , ’ replied <NAME> .
You are of that opinion ? ''
She was in her room , the woman said .
‘ I will not be assured by a domestic .
<NAME> <NAME> inclines his head .
Bolts a bit of bread and butter .
First of all , you see our smoke .
<NAME> said she would go too , and was soon astir .
There was no such place as <NAME> ’ s <NAME> .
‘ We will not wake her .
It seems to be one of the kind smoothings and preparings of the way .
‘ Mantalini ! ’ exclaimed his wife , in an awful voice .
said the <NAME> , drawing forth a handful of shillings and halfpence .
Once in her grandfather ’ s room , she would be safe .
no one else to say a soothing word to such deep sorrow ?
<NAME> entered after him , and they drove away .
You know the poor result of all my search .
<NAME> ! ’ He looked in again .
‘ Where the risk ? ’ returned <NAME> , rubbing his knees still harder .
I supposed that had been thoroughly settled , long ago .
Then the following circumstances occur .
The draught was at her lips .
His name is <NAME> , <NAME> .
Not a bit of it .
‘ What did he say his name was ? ’ asked the captain .
‘ No , ma ’ am , ’ returned Mrs. Crupp .
“ My name is <NAME> , and I keep a wine-shop in the <NAME> .
`` Name of <NAME> , '' said the boy .
We 'll talk of this again .
“ A bad business this , madame , of <NAME> 's execution .
That ’ s gammon. ’ The Pickwickians gazed on each other with wondering eyes .
'So-so , Mrs. Mann , ' replied the beadle .
‘ But where ’ s my brother-in-law , <NAME> ? ’ inquired Mrs. Nickleby .
The wind had quite gone down , and nothing moved .
He answered in the affirmative .
I don ’ t pretend to know anything more about it than I saw .
‘ No , ’ rejoined the other , ‘ no ; none for me .
I knew better than that .
I bounded forward , and clutched her by the arm .
`` Why , what 's the matter with you , <NAME> ? ''
'Open the door , will yer ? '
I am not calculated to show to advantage under that sort of circumstances .
That ’ s what I want to do , and mean to do .
‘ Now , I am Chairwoman of <NAME> ! ’ cries <NAME> .
Do n't go on in that way with a subordinate .
And home seems such a shelter after out of doors !
She was always cheerful from that time .
‘ <NAME> was drowned , <NAME> , ’ pursued the Major .
`` You ai n't angry with <NAME> . ''
<NAME> slackened ; throbbing feebly like a fainting pulse ; stopped .
' I fear not , my dear , ' said the gentleman .
‘ This cursed high room takes one ’ s breath away .
His picture , as a boy , was there .
<NAME> entered timidly , and hung his head before this Spirit .
‘ That effort , ’ said the family practitioner .
He offered no interruption , but remained throughout perfectly still .
Of course this has all been very inconvenient to me , and very disagreeable .
I know I have been your favourite child .
cried <NAME> , throwing himself before her .
Thousands upon thousands do it , according to their varying manner , every day .
‘ I ’ ve come according to promise , ’ roared <NAME> .
“ I am not bullying you , sir , ” said <NAME> .
I ca n't breathe where I am . ''
As if his whole career and character were not being dyed one colour !
I wish you had a better employed brother than <NAME> .
Of our all being so merry and talkative in the carriage going back .
‘ The nobility , of course , ’ said <NAME> .
He wished to be unselfish ; and he hoped he was .
Concerning Mr <NAME> ’ s scheme of such another date to such another effect .
‘ Your daughter is present , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
An old house is a weakness with me .
I like it for a time .
cried <NAME> , checking me as I was about to ring .
“ And why was <NAME> there ?
It refers to the second obligation , which is not yet due .
‘ <NAME> ’ s gone , <NAME> , ’ <NAME> told her .
The question is the usual plain , straightforward , common-sense question .
quite , sir , quite , ' replied <NAME> .
<NAME> straight to the room where the light is .
<NAME> <NAME> paused in the street , not quite decided where to go .
‘ There ’ s the young lady ’ s footsteps .
So you keep my confidence , and I ’ ll keep yours .
As she remained silent , he left her .
'It 's not a large sum , either . '
Draw a little nearer , <NAME> .
`` So you think he might be hard upon me , eh ? ''
‘ “ ‘ Why ? ” inquired the young lady .
‘ And so it is , sure-ly , ’ said a third fat man .
Truly it is against rule .
I abstain from it , because I deem it just to do so .
What can I say more !
Justifications are unnecessary , I hope , on either side . ''
How could I BUT believe him ?
‘ I tell you what , <NAME> .
‘ Are they very theatrical people here ? ’ asked <NAME> .
‘ Is there anybody in the kitchen ? ’ Not a soul .
You have met here by appointment !
‘ I dare say not , ’ said the one-eyed man .
But what you may call the <NAME> ordered him into it again .
They haven ’ t a word to answer .
He ’ s changed , I dare say .
‘ “ You seem in a hurry , ” said the baron .
Mr <NAME> was the first to stir .
‘ I am going on from the point where we broke off .
A few oranges formed the greengrocer ’ s whole concession to the vulgar mind .
A young woman whom he had never seen stood there .
Blessings on ‘ em , on you , and on everybody , <NAME> .
“ <NAME> , ” said he , “ and fearful to reflect upon .
‘ Nobody knows how , nobody knows when , nobody knows where .
We are all of us a little low sometimes .
'He is waiting in a coach at the door , ' replied <NAME> .
The deal fell to <NAME> , and the hand prospered .
And then the charities , my <NAME> brother !
lady lass ! ’ cried the <NAME> .
“ I do n't spell it at all , ” said <NAME> .
By the same degrees his attention became concentrated on the knife .
To the devil with these stones that cut like knives !
Yes , she thought if she were dying , he would relent .
He does me more good than anybody .
Do you see these premises , <NAME> ?
‘ A choker ! ’ said <NAME> , quite aghast .
Some feeling was abroad which raised the child above them all .
<NAME> ; you are <NAME> ; that is another thing .
‘ What should I do without you !
They were just visible from her window .
‘ <NAME> , my dear , ’ he repeated .
After a long pause , Mr <NAME> nodded his head .
You 're not one of the weak-legged ones , you ai n't .
<NAME> and <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , with an almost venerable air .
The child asked how he was , and hoped he was better .
So I said I would go into the outer office and talk to <NAME> .
Have you never heard of <NAME> and determination ?
Some dozen or so of expert strokes sufficed .
Still the footman said ‘ Walk in , ’ so the visitor followed him .
He was now relieved from his perplexity by <NAME> .
'It will be dark by that time . '
‘ You are not well ? ’ rejoined <NAME> .
The richest young man in <NAME> -- ath at this moment .
‘ <NAME> , <NAME> , stay ! ’ roared the preacher again .
One evening he had arranged to meet me at eight o'clock .
One who is too passionless to be either .
I think it is rather our way to be in earnest . ''
Working it round like. ’ ‘ Doyouknow-Mist-Erboff-in ? ’ asked <NAME> .
`` Has he so little pity or compunction ? ''
The President asked , was the Accused openly denounced or secretly ?
‘ Very good notion that indeed , ’ whispered <NAME> to <NAME> .
I am obliged to you for that remark .
He joined their hands , and they were married .
<NAME> is decidedly of opinion `` much more so . ''
Suddenly stopping , he called him by his name .
Anyways I says it again .
‘ Is everything ready ? ’ said the <NAME> to <NAME> .
Did you speak to me , sir ’ ?
‘ What is it that you want ?
<NAME> lays his hand upon his pulse and on his chest .
No , <NAME> thought I had better not go by myself .
And consequently three cheers for the <NAME> !
That is so , father , is it not ?
“ Tried to murder him ? ” said my convict , disdainfully .
Have you any reason to believe that <NAME> loves you ? ” “ <NAME> .
More than that ; I 'm going to take a walk .
‘ However , ’ said Mr <NAME> , ‘ enough of that .
<NAME> <NAME> in a troubled voice repeats , `` <NAME> ? ''
‘ You never said you were .
Our old intriguer said that you were not -- and you stopped him .
'No , I will not , sir , ' replied the beadle .
So the fire nursed me -- the same fire .
'It does me good to hear you . '
<NAME> , but you look young and fresh as the flowers of Spring !
‘ There you are , you see .
<NAME> approved of him highly , and told us he was a <NAME> .
Grandfather Smallweed rubs his legs .
I began to carry her downstairs every morning , and upstairs every night .
Time would bring his death .
<NAME> , these particulars have only lately become known to me .
'Have you made up your mind ? '
Oh , do have mercy upon me , and send them back ! '
My dear <NAME> , I am delighted .
not safe ? ’ said <NAME> , in a tone of great alarm .
‘ I have come to see you .
To which inquiry <NAME> returned a most decided negative .
That is the only good that has ever come of it .
There are more reasons than one for that .
She will put her hands together and pray you to be merciful .
How much will you give me to tell it , then ?
' I spoke as plainly as I could , ' replied Mrs. Bumble .
Have mercy upon a poor boy , sir ! '
‘ Visions of many butchers ’ shops , and public-houses , and much credit ?
So much the more precious , I thought .
`` I would sooner take her opinion than that of a college . ''
‘ A nice person to know , I should think !
‘ Eh , <NAME> ? ’ I shook my head .
But I will be short with <NAME> jade at least ! ''
`` I have looked well into the papers , <NAME> .
‘ Tell me more about <NAME> .
`` May I come in , guardian ? ''
We had never seen such dissatisfied children .
The last police-officer with whom he had conferred was standing silently behind us .
‘ Drat the child ! ’ muttered Mrs. Cluppins .
‘ Come , <NAME> , ’ said the <NAME> .
That ’ s where I am a going to , ’ said <NAME> .
Suddenly the crowd set up a great cheering .
‘ This is where it is .
The room darkened as they went out , and the sun was clouded over .
I don ’ t expect or desire anything of the kind .
and my right dinner-time two !
‘ Please to take a seat , sir , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ It ’ s one of her bad days .
He never knew how that was .
<NAME> people have fevers sometimes ; have n't they , eh ?
<NAME> gave a short nod of intelligence , and left the room .
`` I recognized you in church on Sunday .
There are strings that must not be played upon .
`` She is indeed , miss , '' answered <NAME> , peeping .
`` So I have understood , <NAME> , '' returns <NAME> with great deliberation .
We were all tenants of his -- that man 's who stands there .
You want to tell us so .
‘ You are no great reader , I suppose ? ’ said <NAME> .
‘ You will see me again , young man , to-morrow .
Your receipts are not up to the mark .
'Not a word , ' replied the other .
I feel certain of it .
‘ I know wot ’ s o ’ clock , <NAME> .
‘ Is your father at home ? ’ said he .
No one could pass in or out without being seen .
Little <NAME> , confused under the touch , stood faltering .
I loved thee all the while , indeed I did .
' I want a breath of air . '
‘ Will you step forward ? ’ said the officer .
‘ He might have done worse , ’ said my aunt .
‘ I always had , sir , ’ replied <NAME> .
Little <NAME> had no conveyance there : which rather surprised him .
I was sitting wrapped up at the other end .
I hope you will be stronger to-morrow .
`` I wants it done , and over .
‘ How does the world go ?
<NAME> coach. ” And then follows this very remarkable expression .
Try me as a real friend .
He wore clean linen too , and had had his hair cut .
‘ Quite a coincidence ! ’ said <NAME> .
He said he thought it was human nature .
‘ He ’ s coming up tonight : I wrote to tell him .
The best you can , the best you can ! ''
I used to say it was a great thing to be so highly connected .
And it is so awful !
<NAME> understood the loving pretence , and her heart smote her .
observed the Jew , ruminating or pretending to ruminate .
<NAME> , if I do n't deceive myself ? ''
<NAME> <NAME> saw losing cards in it that <NAME> knew nothing of .
Is not quite healthy , <NAME> informs him .
Why can ’ t you let bygones be bygones ?
They say a hundred thousand pounds. ’ <NAME> had heard two .
is she so wery fond on you ? ’ inquired Sam .
He went over a ship 's side .
The clock struck ten , increasing her impatience .
‘ You may well be sapparised , gentlemen , ’ said the coachman .
`` I am very sensible of your kindness .
I can not see the lighted windows now , but they are there .
May I fold it over this shoulder without injuring your dress ?
<NAME> <NAME> cast down her eyes , and reflected a little .
I left that house that night .
`` Yes , sir , '' she says , `` really and truly . ''
`` I beg your pardon , Mr .
To return to the man and make an end of him .
You might have heard a pin fall -- a pin !
said the gentleman in the white waistcoat .
We are obliged to you for the plainness with which you have spoken .
She stopped , and withdrew her arm .
He waits to walk home with him .
‘ <NAME> ’ t let me detain you .
It would be best to be away from here before I see her .
These are the great actors for whom the stage is reserved .
He smiled with a high-shouldered bow again .
That ’ s a kindness , I should call it !
‘ <NAME> , my love , here is my friend .
‘ I understand , sir , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Who has done this ? ’ exclaimed <NAME> , succouring her friend .
They would have reminded me of old times and made me miserable .
It is not my fault that so unusual an occurrence has taken place tonight .
Do you mind me , <NAME> ?
Let me behold what I shall be , in days to come ! ''
‘ It ’ s as well to keep up appearances .
But you didn ’ t , and you can ’ t .
‘ Any more ? ’ said the whistling gentleman .
He said , “ Not at all , ” and resumed .
`` Where have you sprung up from ? ''
The last I ever had from him . ''
<NAME> <NAME> laughed in his sleeve .
`` Thank you , sir , I am tolerable , '' returned <NAME> .
Well , dearest little woman , we must look forbearingly on it .
`` And one returned , '' said <NAME> , `` and one went on .
<NAME> <NAME> looked on in silent wonder .
<NAME> utters another little scream .
It 's near the offices and near <NAME> . ''
This stepfather of ours was a cruel brute as well as a grinding one .
‘ Give him a meal of chaff ! ’ ‘ Oh !
said <NAME> to the donkey .
<NAME> ’ d never coom near it ‘ gin you thried for twolve moonths .
They die in prison , though .
You would care nothing for it , if I did or could .
‘ No , ’ said <NAME> , shaking his head .
'You have the story there . '
`` There you have the man !
‘ Bless my heart ! ’ exclaimed <NAME> , turning round again .
' I feared for a time he might be otherwise .
What do you say , <NAME> ? ''
<NAME> had not thought Edmund a marrying man .
You will be able to advise us .
I have this morning ’ s paper here .
‘ But I see no way out of it .
The <NAME> goes before all .
<NAME> sets us all right .
I had now leisure to examine the purse .
I desire to leave a good name behind me .
<NAME> , we must not be alone any more .
Stepping back , he put his hand upon the lock .
Indeed , I know he did , because I introduced him to <NAME> . ''
He sat on the box , and Mr <NAME> graced the rumble .
You ’ re none o ’ my raising .
Mrs Veneering equally resents the imputation of being the wife of <NAME> .
Do n't send me back to the wretched place I came from .
This isn ’ t my house. ’ ‘ No .
‘ How do you feel now , my love ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
Ologies of all kinds from morning to night .
They are almost all kind-hearted to one another .
I gave him the name of <NAME> .
‘ Tomorrow morning , ’ replied <NAME> , mending his pen .
‘ I am retained in that , am I ? ’ said the <NAME> .
‘ Isn ’ t it customary to leave the amount open ?
‘ Rather weak upon his legs , ’ returned Mr Vuffin .
‘ I am sure , <NAME> , I am sorry too .
“ Good night ! ” said the uncle .
`` I do n't care for that .
It is not <NAME> 's birthday .
From this digression , let me proceed to <NAME> .
You 've got a dutiful mother , you have , my son .
If you win , you get ‘ em all .
‘ I think he will , ’ rejoined <NAME> .
‘ Go away from me , go away from me !
‘ She wants some brandy and water !
There can be no doubt about it .
City there ; terrace gardens blushing with the bella donna .
Have I my commodity on sale , for that ?
Some people suppose me to be wealthy .
`` As nat'ral as possible , '' says <NAME> .
What am I to DO with this ? '
I suppose we must go home too ?
I was the scourge of both , and that is referable to her .
Few men would ; but he of all others ?
‘ He is very rich , I have heard , ’ rejoined <NAME> .
Perhaps I might have been better friends with your poor father .
<NAME> <NAME> has asked for more ! '
‘ I have made my confession that my love is mad .
I would sooner have cried , but I did neither .
<NAME> , my faith , a pretty ladyship !
He went forth into the world , a lover of his kind .
‘ Quite bright enough now , ’ said <NAME> .
That 's the rule now , Mrs. Corney , all over the country .
She did not know it .
<NAME> fell into discussion with <NAME> concerning courts-martial .
`` Yes , sir , and to-night , too .
‘ Shall I -- be -- given up to him ? ’ I faltered .
`` Military time , sir , '' he replied .
<NAME> and <NAME> ’ s at a ball .
Now , I 'll try you again. ” Throwing his finger at him again .
`` <NAME> is him that was brought here in a chair ? ''
She ’ s my wife , my doting little wife .
`` Then , will you come to the lawyer ?
says <NAME> , nodding to his familiar .
“ Very few men have the power of wrist that this woman has .
Their fallen leaves lie strewn thickly about .
‘ I ’ m not quite small enough to get through key-holes .
I 'll split the diff'erence , gen ' l'men , ' urged Gamfield .
These things were to be .
Would you go and be dependent on your friends ? '
I have no more words to waste .
‘ “ You , ” said the old gentleman .
I think continually about my age .
`` Is this all you have to say ? ''
‘ I have been hunting about all day .
‘ Let me see him do it again .
But that , you have interrupted .
you 're a brave boy , <NAME> . '
His first impression was that his coat had been stolen .
'They -- they certainly had a boy . '
says the Chancellor with a slight smile .
‘ <NAME> is like you , <NAME> .
`` Very gentlemanly indeed , '' said <NAME> .
I might have known as much at first , knowing you .
He is a veterinary surgeon , a farrier , and horsebreaker .
When is it to be done ?
And yet they awakened something in me , bringing promise to my heart .
Rising , he disclosed to view the form and features of the <NAME> .
Instantly , <NAME> turned likewise , and they went back side by side .
Mr <NAME> ’ s station was on the opposite side .
<NAME> , in her different way , sat looking at him too .
They ca n't spoil MY beauty .
<NAME> of one hundred pound premium also ready to be made over .
'Of course it is , ' replied <NAME> .
If these shadows remain unaltered by the <NAME> , the child will die . ''
Still , the reference to <NAME> by name mastered everything .
In short , they could abuse everybody , because everybody was there .
The old man saw him coming , and vainly strove to elude his grasp .
'This is him , sir , ' replied <NAME> .
‘ Would you do me the honour ? ’ said <NAME> .
She had admirers without end .
There they were , matched , ever afterwards !
You to marry a second time without family !
Again and again his fancy heard it , coming on louder and louder .
These letters have been falling about like a shower of lady-birds .
A third man got up and went out .
But he was _not _suffered to remain there in peace .
‘ But I was going to say , <NAME> , ’ said Mr Toots .
I have said we are now arrived at our last sitting .
‘ Knock him down , if he don ’ t , ’ said <NAME> .
The saying is , that home is home , be it never so homely .
I said to myself , `` Esther , my dear , you surprise me !
‘ <NAME> , this is <NAME> ’ s brother , <NAME> .
You do n't happen to have heard of a murder ? ''
<NAME> here ! ’ ‘ <NAME> ! ’ cried the Doctor .
He slightly waved his hand and fell into his usual manner .
But if you could oblige me , I should take it as a kindness .
The four rough fellows , seeing , shed tears .
I have no wish that people should step in between us .
‘ A woman ’ s tact is invaluable .
The little front room up stairs is very pleasant .
I saw many of these rafts afterwards , but never one so large .
‘ He must not make a plaything of a treasure .
‘ You told me one before ! ’ ‘ Two ! ’ cried <NAME> .
Not ten minutes , my dear . '
'Ah , poor dear , so it is ! '
' I am a porochial beadle , gentlemen , ' rejoined <NAME> proudly .
‘ I ’ m in <NAME> or <NAME> .
There he goes , ’ replied <NAME> .
‘ She ’ s a fine woman , ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> , at the same time , stamped upon my toes .
<NAME> , and I will tell you .
The child herself almost wonders at a certain secrecy he keeps in it .
'Yer are ; yer know yer are ! '
So you ’ ve been spilt , eh ?
Did n't see what that had to do with it .
He could not master his own attention for a minute together .
If you died , indeed , the people you hate would make her happy .
I do strongly feel it .
<NAME> , my good fellow , here -- take my purse .
“ What fresh misery is this ?
'What sort of a noise ? '
says the trooper with a pleasant smile .
‘ A most extraordinary accidental likeness , certainly , ’ says he .
He might be more deserving than he thought him .
Jo follows her a pace or two into a quiet court .
He walked on tiptoe to the door , and gave a gentle tap .
the more you ’ ll want me .
My own boy never could be dearer .
He could not hear or bear the word .
“ That 's what I told you not to do , ” said <NAME> .
The President required the name of that citizen .
‘ What does she mean ! ’ said <NAME> .
I think you had , you know. ’ ‘ Me my suspicions ?
So his mother thumped him , and he cried melodiously .
To the last , I 'll show myself in that court to its shame .
‘ I bought the dog yesterday .
' I 'll swear I saw it ! '
There are only two ways of accounting for this extraordinary proceeding .
Did you ever hear him mention how he found it , my dear friend ?
Somebody else had come in quietly by the folding-doors .
<NAME> glanced at me and looked unwilling to pursue the suggestion .
That Mr Pitt , upon the bookcase , represents it .
Give me the run of your ‘ ouse .
<NAME> <NAME> arrives hastily in his grey coat and his black sleeves .
`` The picture on the right is the present <NAME> .
‘ It was impossible ! ’ <NAME> was of another opinion .
<NAME> those women ; they never do anything by halves .
Never was such a contest known .
‘ I ’ m always ill after <NAME> , ’ said Mrs. Wititterly .
Oh , don ’ t be dreadful ! ’ I dreadful !
‘ Does it ? ’ replied the other pettishly .
Living on the mysterious premises , one would like to know .
‘ Not another word with him shall pass my lips .
‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , turning fiercely upon him .
' I never saw a sharper lad .
You know my vagabond and restless habits .
`` <NAME> is in court now .
And you are going to visit our interesting <NAME> wards ?
There were not even the traces of recent footsteps , to be seen .
Not half a mile to run .
'No , she ca n't , ' replied <NAME> .
I shall take no step without forewarning you . ''
'Barkers for me , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
By the way , let me ask you .
‘ Me who dote upon her with the demdest ardour !
All day , <NAME> toiled as such people must toil , whatever their anxieties .
I do n't regret it therefore . ''
They drew near the house .
They may be made quiet , ” said the baron .
You are the children of a worthy gentleman !
Why , I r-r-r-ruin my character by remaining with a ladyship so infame ! ''
‘ I have rincontrato him. ’ ‘ Im ?
“ <NAME> would seem to imply verbal communication .
But betray the lovely woman , and you shall find her a serpent .
The tide will serve pretty nicely at about two in the afternoon , sir .
`` And if I were to say to-day , 'Go !
<NAME> for once at fault ; out , quite out !
he said , fixing his eyes on me with an angry stare .
That weapon was a gentleman 's .
Clearly , it was not made for him , or for any individual mortal .
she said with the same knitted brow and in the same uncivil manner .
He met it with his blandest and most deferential smile , and went on .
<NAME> <NAME> went with us and quite enjoyed the expedition .
While I deciphered it , <NAME> continued to eat and drink .
<NAME> Winkle modestly repeated his suggestion .
`` You often think you know me as I really am ?
'Everybody who could have helped me , had joined in the pursuit .
Similarly , it might be said that the dress was the Queen of <NAME> .
These arrangements is made by mutual consent between Mrs Boffin and me .
‘ Ay ! ’ said the old man .
I consented , and he was fervent , and then sat down again .
They were in the gateway .
And not you , I swear ! ''
That done , she fell into her former attitude .
They were not agreed , and wished to retire .
But oh , what a clammy hand his was !
How CAN people do that !
He appears to me to have lived in a hail of saucepan-lids .
Pass me one , and take the other. ’ Crack .
Further , that I require you to bring obedience here .
‘ In a jiffy , ’ retorts Mrs Pipchin sharply .
‘ You are not so well to-day .
The <NAME> of the <NAME> 28 .
‘ Ah ! ’ said <NAME> , ‘ going to bed ?
‘ Good-morning , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , bowing obsequiously .
Will you come and help me with him ?
Not near ; so do n't think it . '
‘ She is sleeping soundly , ’ he said ; ‘ but no wonder .
replied <NAME> , whose temper had been considerably impaired by walking .
He could touch its smooth and slippery surface with his hand .
‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , with a nod .
`` The blunderbus is loaded with slugs .
truly , yes , I think I have !
‘ All necessary means will be provided for you .
Where will she wait for him ?
I like it now though .
“ The news is of him .
I doubt if he can hold out long , though .
`` Complimentary to our distant relation ! ''
‘ Go on , my dear Sir !
<NAME> ! ’ I cried to him .
But having done so , let me do something .
‘ Five year older at the very least ! ’ cried the other .
It 'll blow a gale in the course of the night ! ''
Quite a phenomenon of a fowl .
What your broken plaything is as to birth , I am .
They are still in the first year of their marriage .
She was like <NAME> embodied , to me .
All made over to the public and <NAME> , I suppose !
Which I meantersay as sech if you 're a man , come on !
<NAME> , and uncle , and <NAME> , and Mrs. Gummidge .
My homage to <NAME> , is a flight of arrows in my bosom .
<NAME> of us is the better man ?
A little this way , if you please , <NAME> .
The ministers of <NAME> are robed and ready .
‘ What lay are you upon ? ’ asked the tinker .
<NAME> , for some one else !
Is it chalked upon the walls and cried in the streets ? ''
Another being brought , he falls to with great goodwill .
‘ A thousand thanks to Heaven !
A slight disorder of the stomach makes them cheats .
He spoke in a low tone , and laughed .
I owed you one on that score ; now I have paid it .
said the old lady , wringing her hands .
The churches were the freest from it .
‘ I have seen very little of her , ’ said <NAME> .
Far better put it by .
Let me stop you here .
'What do _you_ say , <NAME> ? '
what a pity , what a pity !
You persisted in working , you overdid it .
I wish you had known him , gentlemen .
‘ <NAME> , bah , sir , what does it signify ?
<NAME> <NAME> came into the house for <NAME> ’ s boxes .
As they find the fact , they will judge me .
“ Give me your arm , my love .
'You 'll have a very cold walk , <NAME> , ' said the matron .
oh no ! ’ and held her hand .
If there 's been any fault at all to-day , it 's mine .
Sometimes the schoolmaster and the pupil are both abroad .
<NAME> <NAME> will not think me ill-bred , I hope ? ''
I have got some of you under the harrow .
A <NAME> Day and <NAME> .
`` <NAME> has been dead these seven years , '' <NAME> replied .
What does <NAME> care for <NAME> !
That ’ s the way you do .
I had not the power to attend to it .
‘ You -- are -- out early , <NAME> , ’ said I .
`` I refer , my dear , to his social conduct .
I won ’ t ! ’ she repeated in a low , thick voice .
<NAME> ; do n't keep me here all night ! '
Notwithstanding his very liberal laudation of himself , however , the Major was selfish .
say a word for me , my dear .
Mrs. Snagsby repeats with severity .
And , moreover , it is certain that there she was .
<NAME> detains Mrs Veneering a few moments .
I have wiped them away now and can go on again properly .
You will be visited , and can ask then .
‘ Doctor Blimber is at home , I believe ? ’ said Mr Dombey .
`` But why is it to be mine ? ''
Do you know what I represent ?
‘ <NAME> me what it is .
Has a ring of iron on his left foot .
There are no designs against the <NAME> Dustman there ?
It may have done so .
‘ I don ’ t mean that ; quite different from that .
What have I done ? ’ ‘ Done ! ’ returned the other .
‘ No enlightenment , ’ resumed <NAME> , after certain minutes of silence .
I therefore forbore to ask any further questions .
She longed so much to see you . ''
How far might you call yourselves from the marshes , hereabouts ?
The bolt is impending , and the tree must fall .
We must not shipwreck <NAME> upon it .
`` What have you got to say next ? ''
returns Mrs. Rouncewell , bursting into tears .
Light be her heart , and gay her merry eyes , for years !
Can any man say otherwise ?
The visitor stood looking at her with a strange attentive smile .
Besides that , his loss of himself grew out of it .
But my mind did not run so much on this as might be supposed .
‘ Oh , certainly not , ’ said <NAME> .
We made a compromise of everything .
You are not to be trusted to do it for yourself .
`` Bring it here , <NAME> , <NAME> ?
‘ Surely , surely , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ It ’ s you , is it ? ’ said the old gentleman .
they would not let him .
Those are very arsh words , ’ he replied .
“ I do , ” said the <NAME> .
The fortunes of those who have figured in this tale are nearly closed .
“ Do you see what a villain he is ?
`` The town 's enough for you , eh ? ''
I ’ ve foreseen it , but I couldn ’ t help it .
This is the first I have heard of that one .
It has its own times and places in my story .
‘ I thought everybody knew that , ’ replied the landlord .
I must ask him point blank. ” “ Yes .
<NAME> <NAME> gone , like a shadow over the white road .
The resemblance is wonderful ! ’ ‘ Perfectly startling , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Wot ’ s gone wrong , mum ? ’ said <NAME> .
`` What do you mean by coming here at this time of day ? ''
“ I want diversion , and I have done with men and women .
I never can have him .
‘ The <NAME> was quite sure the hon .
You are so white , <NAME> -- for you -- and look so shocked .
All this with great deliberation .
You have comforted others with such things , father .
The visitor followed him up-stairs .
And Jo stands shivering and looking at the breakfast wonderingly .
‘ If you please , ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> will wake him , sir .
cries <NAME> , rubbing his hands with an artful chuckle .
Since which they had gone their road , and their brother had gone his .
Where ’ s <NAME> number four , Mr Rugg ?
Much of that would n't do for you , <NAME> !
‘ <NAME> , ma ’ am , ’ said <NAME> , with a curtsey .
said <NAME> with an appearance of the utmost simplicity and candour .
I am used to that .
But with no intention of passing many more weary days there .
Her head concedes it , and <NAME> is enchanted .
'That 's true , ' rejoined <NAME> , thoughtfully .
`` Go and live there yourself . ''
You inspire me with both , in the highest degree .
'How dare you urge me to it , young man ? '
I will not be the man I must have been but for this intercourse .
It is right that he should be the first consideration .
“ I quite understand it to be a nice question .
After the relief of tears , she soon became composed , and even cheerful .
And one of his model children had come to this !
<NAME> ( of <NAME> ) rose to order .
‘ Presently , ’ resumed <NAME> , ‘ he DID coom .
'You can write well now ? '
I press this one , and will take nothing less than these terms .
I didn ’ t hear you. ’ No word or sound in answer .
On these occasions I frequently found <NAME> absent .
This was my third work of fiction .
‘ But what does your papa care !
gent. ’ s false and scurrilous accusation , with profound contempt .
<NAME> expects refinement in _me_ will be disappointed .
‘ That ’ s it , exactly , ’ rejoined the other .
It was the critical moment of <NAME> 's fate .
‘ So much for my habits !
It will be a good omen for me .
You have only to choose. ’ Accordingly , she began with the piano .
<NAME> <NAME> bowed to the bearer of that name .
‘ We live in a singular world , sir , ’ said Mrs. Sparsit .
`` Perhaps I do , to my sorrow . ''
I had been taken by surprise , and my courage had quite failed me .
‘ No , ’ said <NAME> , dropping her glass .
‘ Yes. ’ ‘ P , ’ suggested <NAME> , good-naturedly .
`` <NAME> , to be sure ! ''
You have no idea what an opinion he has of you ! ''
For the whole case is assumed .
<NAME> <NAME> quietly takes his seat there .
‘ Hurrah ! ’ gasped <NAME> faintly .
At the word father , I saw his former trouble come into his face .
And we had such a lot of betters !
And I made him my curtsy and left him .
'Lor bless her dear heart , no ! '
And then he said , did the jury know <NAME> ?
You know me ? ’ cried the other , in a suppressed voice .
‘ <NAME> ’ nly not , ’ said <NAME> .
“ The people from the market did it .
`` And I tell you what !
‘ Deep way , I called it , ’ said <NAME> .
pretty near as firm as I was . '
I was paralysed by the sight of such grief .
You won ’ t have occasion to trouble the <NAME> Office any more .
‘ Lend it to his old Uncle , eh ? ’ retorted Mr Dombey .
‘ Mr Riah ? ’ said this visitor , very politely .
Everybody talks to you , or to anybody else who hits his fancy .
They advance slowly , looking at all these things .
oh , has she , has she ?
Win her affections and possess her heart !
He was awfully cold , to be sure .
We felt that he must be very interesting .
growled <NAME> , with excessive disgust .
That ’ s not your expressive countenance which asks that question .
The host needed no translation of the question .
‘ My pretty one , can I help it ?
You would make a home out of even this house . ''
Why do you delight to torture me ? ''
I tell you out at once .
Mr <NAME> ’ s object was not professional , but social .
What do you say I have got of my own ? ''
said <NAME> , shuddering from head to foot .
`` But I can carry my years .
'Some of the old women dying , I suppose .
He took a large semi-circular bite out of the toast , and groaned again .
And had not I , unworthy and far-removed from them , sin to denounce ?
‘ The present time is no time for letters .
You can not think too generously or too highly of her .
of course , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Well , well , I will , ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> itself appeared to be frozen up , all was so cold and still .
`` You are well met , sir , '' he returned .
You do n't mind me half so much , do you ? ''
Do tell me that ? ’ ‘ Yes , ’ snarled the dwarf .
‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , spitting it out among the ashes .
There was something of the glare upon its face .
<NAME> do n't know her at all , if you please , miss ! ''
The father of a long , long line of brilliant laughs !
He said his spirit was up , and wouldn ’ t endure this .
‘ Have they that interest ? ’ said Mr Dombey .
<NAME> fellow , you quite mistake him .
The lamps are right , are they ?
Now , pray let us think !
`` I will , miss , '' said <NAME> .
Yet he is not easy about him ; who CAN be ? ''
‘ Ugh , ’ said <NAME> , turning away .
A chance and hope of my procuring , <NAME> . ''
Nor is this , the most striking phenomenon incidental to such a state .
<NAME> <NAME> acquiesced with the greatest suavity .
`` I ask your pardon , sir , '' says <NAME> .
“ Well , don ’ t do it again , ” said the father .
Now , I won ’ t have him here .
I ’ ll keep my own counsel , however .
You are only a little low .
<NAME> , ” ’ said <NAME> , ‘ “ Pleasant Place , <NAME> .
All past , all gone , all lost , and broken up !
“ Available for both , ” he said , placing these against the wall .
I courted her under singular circumstances .
So not a word spake <NAME> .
He held his breath , and listened at the key-hole .
But others do , and he is in prison and in danger .
It 's not long , you see , guard .
‘ I supposed it was business of some kind or other .
‘ This is the place , ’ said the old man .
`` I 'll go in here , my dear . ''
' A young friend of mine , my dear , ' replied the Jew .
That 's how I come to know what they 're up to . ''
The rain falls very heavy , and the wind has risen. ’ The wind ?
`` Thank you , '' returned <NAME> .
‘ Her mother his been dead these ten year .
Your sister has learnt how to govern what is proud in her nature .
They are to ascend the great Tower .
If I had cried before , I should have had <NAME> with me then .
I can ’ t help thinking what he must have suffered himself .
'He may have worse , I say , ' repeated <NAME> .
He will get into some trouble or difficulty otherwise .
`` Come up on the tramp ? ''
‘ That ’ s the name ! ’ cried <NAME> , turning to <NAME> .
‘ If they had ? ’ repeated <NAME> in an inquiring tone .
It was the very thing he liked .
The suggestion is not appropriate to our Dora .
‘ Nothing for me , I thank you , ’ said <NAME> .
'Give me the other , ' said <NAME> , seizing <NAME> 's unoccupied hand .
The doors are thrown open , and she passes through the hall .
‘ <NAME> , an old married woman .
“ If I might touch him !
The articles of the friendly move are then severally recited and agreed upon .
He is a very eccentric person .
Of course it was left to her unconditionally .
‘ <NAME> , ’ I said respectfully , ‘ I understand .
asked <NAME> , looking up , impatiently .
Now that I have asked you so much , tell me the end .
To save expense , perhaps you can make up something here for myself .
Is <NAME> choking ? ’ cried <NAME> .
‘ Wind right astarn , and plenty of it , ’ pursued the <NAME> .
She has given a faint indication of intending to speak .
Have a passage ready taken for ‘ Merriker .
and they bring him faster .
‘ Where ’ s an officer ? ’ said <NAME> .
Your voice is so low and broken that I can not hear you .
'_You_ thought they were talking too much ? '
It affects the whole machine , and failure is the consequence .
We had better keep it quiet .
I will not allow this .
‘ What ’ s the matter with the child ? ’ asked <NAME> .
`` You fear the world too much , '' she answered , gently .
`` Always devoted to business , Vholes ! ''
Will you let me in , <NAME> ? ''
‘ All in good time , my love .
He was going to his work ?
‘ I can work and attend too .
I will never refer to it again .
<NAME> <NAME> replies , `` Jobling , we have . ''
I should like to have given him something : that 's all . ''
‘ Good-night ! ’ ‘ Good-night , ’ said <NAME> .
She could not begin by being so bold .
‘ I fell upon my back .
‘ Three or four months , sir , ’ says the Doctor .
At length she did so .
Finally , <NAME> coiled himself up at her feet and went to sleep .
‘ I supposed so , from their all appearing to keep away from you .
‘ It ’ s very kind of you .
No , to-morrow night. ’ ‘ Then to-morrow be it , ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> thou always at it .
It was almost too much happiness to bear .
And <NAME> went on nursing the baby with a thoughtful look .
Where did he live now ?
She started and looked up .
Do not desert me , now I have this chance .
‘ Now , really , child , you are a little trying .
It is enough that daylight comes , morning comes , noon comes .
We can ’ t go beyond bakers .
So he listened for the hour .
Somewhere , anywhere , to hide her head !
'Sikes is not , I suppose ? '
‘ I should rayther think so , ’ replied <NAME> .
Twice , and she had seized it by its bloody hair .
So earnestly , that <NAME> answered , as if she had spoken .
Clearly they could want nothing but a stringent policeman .
<NAME> , say that my answer was , <NAME> <NAME> started in his saddle .
Sowed 'em , to come up small salad .
<NAME> her all along , on and off .
Do you know the sound of gold ?
It is eminently respectable , and likewise , in a general way , retainer-like .
‘ <NAME> , <NAME> first , I hope , ’ said <NAME> , laughing .
to be sure you are .
‘ Then I ’ ll write to say so .
‘ Oh , his sorrow is another and quite a different thing .
O so dearly , O so dearly !
The creed , as I should state it now , was this .
‘ I wish I had never brought him up .
when I saw her last , she was a little child .
<NAME> <NAME> , good night , <NAME> bless you , sir !
I never looked at her , sir .
‘ You do , <NAME> , ’ returned my mother .
It ought to bring a judgment on us .
‘ Well , I never heard the like of that ! ’ exclaimed <NAME> .
Soon as she got to <NAME> she turned her face tow ’ rds it .
You ’ re absurd. ’ Mr Dombey absolutely laughed .
Would you be so good as tell us ?
So he had got on in life , and here he was !
‘ I am glad of that .
<NAME> stopped at the <NAME> ?
<NAME> Leicester receives that ferruginous person graciously .
I went down on my knees .
But he knows well enough at a glance .
You 're not afraid of me , <NAME> , are you ? ''
‘ You ’ re out of spirits , sir , ’ said <NAME> .
What did <NAME> put this new success at ?
Not that I wondered at it .
‘ I am never contented , except with your freshness , my gentle Daisy .
‘ What did I tell you about making me creak the door ?
`` No , no , '' says <NAME> , `` I think not .
It ’ s of no consequence. ’ ‘ Good-bye ! ’ cries <NAME> .
‘ Plenty of that , <NAME> .
cried <NAME> , from whose lungs the laughter had proceeded : 'here he is !
It lies before the goal ; the pursuit is at an end .
You let the cage alone , and let me wring its neck will you ?
The chair would not be drawn into conversation .
Water of gold , golden water !
'We had better inspect the premises first , and examine the servants afterwards .
I think I must engage Mr Gowan to paint my picture .
`` You are sure you are not the least angry with me , <NAME> ?
The old girl borrowed a bassoon from the bandmaster of the <NAME> .
To the dissolute and bad , the thing remains a frightful mystery .
This the <NAME> Dustman quite understood .
This boy must be bound , out of hand .
‘ <NAME> , another cup and saucer .
But his master and friend is married .
I ’ m actiwally drove out o ’ house and home by it .
Who knows when we may meet again , else ?
She can not be seen until next Sunday night ; this is Tuesday .
<NAME> for me , dear , ’ she whispered to her friend .
She is going away next week. ’ ‘ Home ? ’ asked Mr Dorrit .
the murder ’ s out ! ’ said <NAME> -- ‘ You come in !
says <NAME> , darkening her large eyes again .
Somehow or other he couldn ’ t sleep -- always restless and uncomfortable .
said my guardian when they were gone .
And wrote inside , “ From a true friend , ” like the fust .
‘ I am going to the <NAME> this morning , ’ said <NAME> .
He would remove the dishes with his own hands .
`` In the back room up there .
It is extraordinary what they will rush upon , sometimes .
`` And what do you call these little fellows , ma'am ? ''
Not so much of <NAME> ap -- what 's his name ? ''
Will you please to walk in . ''
Have you seen the thief ? '
<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> waited for us at the old place .
If he had been , perhaps he would have been prepared for this .
There was no one there .
‘ Question number three -- and last , ’ said <NAME> , emphatically .
‘ Do you know anything of this , <NAME> ? ’ said <NAME> sharply .
<NAME> was standing near her .
‘ And now I can ’ t bear the sight of you .
It will not be for long , perhaps .
However , mad or sane , he tried , ’ returned <NAME> .
'And what may that be ? '
In this cosey state of mind we came to the verdict <NAME> .
The fat boy , for once , had not been fast asleep .
<NAME> <NAME> shook his , and sighed .
'Why I told yer that before . '
Trust in nothing but in <NAME> and your own efforts .
We shall be glad to see him .
‘ Why , so I saw , ’ observed <NAME> .
They were welcome to the <NAME> , he would tell them .
‘ Most extraordinary , ’ replied the friend .
Mrs <NAME> was overjoyed to escape into a corner for a little quiet talk .
<NAME> ! ’ thrice in the ensuing night , but no return of <NAME> .
I thought you were out .
`` We expected you before , '' says <NAME> .
It will be much more like a funeral , than a wedding .
‘ <NAME> , now , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ about my affair .
I wish you would look at her .
<NAME> <NAME> , you must hear me .
Either the suit must be ended , <NAME> , or the suitor .
So <NAME> and I , without saying anything to any one , went out .
Every night when <NAME> came home , something new had been found out .
‘ I have thowt of that , ’ he replied .
‘ So grown ! ’ said old Sol .
'Lor , how nice it is to hear yer say so ! '
And Mr <NAME> was full of interest and praise .
Then why didn ’ t you ask me , the moment we came out ?
He had not moved ; he had been afraid to stir .
I suppose it will cost money ?
My aunt was a tall , hard-featured lady , but by no means ill-looking .
‘ Merely habit , my dear , ’ pleaded Mr Chick .
But you shan ’ t have her , nor she you .
It was a scornful laugh .
‘ Let him come in here ! ’ said I .
First , there was Florence coming to the party .
‘ What ’ s that ? ’ said Mr Dombey .
‘ <NAME> ! ’ said the old woman , triumphantly .
‘ <NAME> , ’ returns the Major , ‘ you know it .
The child ’ s young heart was breaking .
‘ How came you to be his master , sir ? ’ asked <NAME> .
Yet she was not embarrassed , but wholly self-possessed .
The softened stationer deposits another half-crown on the table .
‘ A dear old friend , ’ said I .
’ Tis thou who art in need of rest—so white and tired .
The family honour , sir , is safe from me in this country .
As <NAME> had anticipated , <NAME> betook himself straight to her house .
It is not a convenient precedent at all .
`` Oh , yes , guardian , I know it .
Also with a secretly glistening eye .
'Indeed it will , ' replied <NAME> .
It was quite warm , it was very warm !
I have no doubt that it is , word for word , the same .
how beaming she looked , and how glad !
Did you say that <NAME> had been very active in this election ? ''
Not to be mentioned in <NAME> , ” said I. <NAME> nodded .
He is not a candidate . ''
“ Not at all , ” said he .
I know what I know .
Now move on here , some of you . ''
( Here she set down the glass . )
`` I am afraid I have not .
I thought that if I were to choose , I would like this best .
<NAME> arrives at the house of <NAME> ’ s aunts , in due course .
It was plain enough that <NAME> had not been neglectful of the adjuration .
<NAME> bless us , how they find people out !
inquires the old man with his hand to his ear .
I know that it ’ s the natural company of such as I am !
<NAME> , I beseech you , think of that ! ''
It will be better for you and better for me .
‘ <NAME> , my child ’ -- and turns to kiss her .
Family affairs have come out .
<NAME> , however , was concluded on the subject yet .
`` Every person has a right to take care of themselves .
‘ On board serving as third mate was <NAME> .
But after a little while I seemed to have the whole flats to myself .
The month 's trial over , <NAME> was formally apprenticed .
You were very fond of her -- you were better off then .
Is this your Yorkshire gallantry ?
‘ Look at my torturer , ’ he replied .
'Do you give the children <NAME> , Mrs .
For you were not brought up in that strange house from a mere baby .
That there are people whom it is necessary to detest without compromise .
‘ <NAME> hands , ’ would be <NAME> ’ s next advance .
I understood that very well .
He ’ s the devotedest and innocentest infant !
No , no , <NAME> bless her !
She returned the kiss , but still looked at the fire .
He makes a point of it .
‘ Yes , ’ said Mr Perch , keeping time with his head .
<NAME> , thake handth , firtht and latht !
I picture myself taking courage to make a declaration to <NAME> .
For say that I planted such a tree for such a man .
Not many people , I believe .
There was a little family misunderstanding among us .
<NAME> , who was a man of few words , nodded assent .
I found <NAME> dining on cold meat , and delighted to welcome me back .
I have no one in the world to go to .
'What , I suppose he was -- ' 'Wanted , ' interposed Fagin .
`` Nor do I know yet . ''
‘ Again you are very good , ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> consideration , he said , could not but afford him the liveliest satisfaction .
<NAME> <NAME> steps forward from his window and pulls the bell .
I will not trouble the court by asking him any more questions .
‘ Who ’ s gone ? ’ said <NAME> fiercely .
This wo n't do , old fellow !
You ’ re a-going to bolt , are you ?
I have broke out now , and I can ’ t go back .
'To <NAME> , ma'am , ' resumed the inflexible beadle , 'by coach .
But I never own to it before her .
Who was the better for it ?
`` It was not when we opened our hearts to you .
You never heard of ‘ em .
As it was , however , it had no visible effect on him whatever .
<NAME> toddle de om dee .
It approaches the window , and a hand taps at the glass .
<NAME> <NAME> went with me , as it was dusk .
The girl was quiet too and sat in a corner looking on the ground .
<NAME> and the lovely woman had a rather particular appointment to keep .
The old girl would do it to-morrow .
I think I know what you would tell me .
I have told you everything now , my dear .
And what ’ s this thinking for ‘ em all ?
The name awakened a new train of ideas in the boy 's mind .
Therefore I recommend your turning him out before he gets still worse . ''
There has never been the least departure from the strict line of fact .
‘ He ’ s quite welcome to it .
‘ “ I do not think or hope that you will ever forgive me .
'Only hear him , how he braves it out ! '
It was heavy on his mind now ; heavier than all the rest .
‘ You can ’ t help it , ’ said <NAME> .
“ I have thought so before now .
‘ You saved me from drowning ! ’ said <NAME> .
And yet I love him .
She held them closer ; and her face hung down upon them .
It began the moment we sat down to dinner .
What does she mean by this look and this imploring gesture ?
It almost seemed to me that I had lost my Ada for ever .
<NAME> ’ t I like it then ?
Perhaps , the having done so with success , is followed by a revulsion .
And I beg not to be questioned any more about it .
I was a chip—and a very dry one—when I first became aware of myself .
I had heard of it already without an offended or angry word . ''
I would rather stay here , for the present .
I say farewell to her by you. ” “ My husband .
`` It 's you , young ladies , is it ? ''
‘ I never was so surprised , my dear ! ’ said her father .
It was a strange handwriting , and the paper was much soiled and blotted .
‘ A thousand thanks , ’ he then observed .
The worst of the strife was over .
We had our little festivities on those occasions and exchanged social ideas .
How there were more years ; more impertinences , ignorances , and insults .
The house seems strange and new , and there are loud echoes in it .
Presently he hears a rustling .
The last burst carried the mail to the summit of the hill .
In came the cook , with her brother 's particular friend , the milkman .
‘ Yes , ’ said the man , ‘ along of them Mails .
If you only knew how hard !
Eat it while it ’ s hot and comfortable .
You thought nothing to that effect ? ''
`` If you want to converse with me , you must speak out .
Let me whisper to you . '
<NAME> clients of ours that got us a world of credit .
You must go to <NAME> 's in <NAME> 's <NAME> . ''
In short , I had come down on purpose .
It was to this establishment that <NAME> led <NAME> in safety .
And he to have been so slight and young then !
Now , see me here , upon my knees .
`` Did he look like -- not like <NAME> ? ''
He wishes me most particular to write what larks .
The rest of his time he passed in <NAME> .
And so _he_ goes up the postern stair .
‘ Now then ! ’ cried <NAME> from the gallery .
‘ Might you be anyways dry ? ’ ‘ Yes .
‘ It ain ’ t a common name .
I shouldn ’ t have mentioned the subject , sir .
‘ It ’ s the old story , ’ said I .
‘ The theatrical profession , ’ said <NAME> .
Not another word ’ said he .
He stood transfixed to the spot , gazing on vacancy .
I have been asleep , myself .
exclaimed the Jew , shrugging his shoulders .
“ Do you know where you saw it afore ?
`` My dear <NAME> , are you serious ? ''
‘ More company ! ’ said Mrs. Sanders .
Ally Loo ! ’ Horses almost do it .
In the cause of the right. ’ Thus Silas assuming a noble air .
I am waiting for the gentleman .
I feel it all over me ! ''
<NAME> thanked me , and descended .
I am so sorry for the mother .
If you like politeness , you know where to get it .
`` No , <NAME> , '' he very calmly replies .
The schoolmaster rose from his desk and walked with them to the gate .
‘ This day eight year , ’ said <NAME> after a pause .
A very foggy night , with great rings round the lamps in the streets !
‘ Humph ! ’ said Mr Swiveller pondering , ‘ this is queer .
He means nothing by it and thinks nothing of it .
<NAME> was so very precious .
Half a pint. ’ I thought <NAME> would have fallen , insensible .
<NAME> has something the matter with her spine , poor girl .
I am always well , ’ said <NAME> , timidly .
Each seat holds two persons .
' I was not , indeed , sir . '
‘ If I go on chattering , you ’ ll be taken alive .
`` Shall I try to guess ? ''
You hit the wise answer , Mr Clennam .
<NAME> , ’ he returned , laughing , ‘ upon my honour , no .
‘ <NAME> will soon be home with us for good , now .
I would recommend you not to ask for it . '
‘ You take me , I see , ’ replied <NAME> .
She would have recovered her first surprise , and might feel easier with him .
`` I fancy I have had enough of it .
But such is the wretched trickery of hole-and- corner <NAME> !
he ’ s much the same as usual , ’ was the reply .
asked <NAME> with her pretty smile .
It is the wet , sir .
He was alone in the world .
The lawyer sits down in his easy-chair and stirs the fire .
He was not only very ill , but dying , then . ''
This big loaf is for <NAME> .
‘ This is the way out of the difficulty .
exclaimed the man , becoming violently angry .
‘ Compose your feelings , ma ’ am. ’ Here <NAME> looked benignant .
My <NAME> will come back , just the same . ''
It worries me nearly out of my wits .
If I have sometimes been unhappy , the feeling has passed away .
‘ It is of a very painful kind , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
`` All things considered , I had better decline answering that question , <NAME> .
You are not worth the confidence I have placed in you .
But I mean to it .
The noise increased as he looked .
He looked at <NAME> .
All the rest was in the tone in which she said them .
Mrs Veneering is charmed by the humour , and so is Veneering .
The witnesses had been examined , and counsel was addressing the jury .
but not as you are now .
Say I am innocent and I get a lawyer .
The labours of others have raised for us an immense reservoir of important facts .
Think of her bringing-up , and think of <NAME> .
The bar of the <NAME> was a bar to soften the human breast .
There 's a cab at the door . ''
They look at each other , very seriously .
<NAME> that I had doubled it -- made cent .
‘ The original piece is a French one , ’ said <NAME> .
You think much of me .
Sicily shall be the place of our retreat .
‘ One pound per week , ’ replied <NAME> , improving on the terms .
Yours is very good tobacco .
HE wouldn ’ t do to be trotted about and made useful .
“ Do n't lose your temper , ” said <NAME> .
'Has this man been a-drinking , sir ? '
You can call at the Bower any time in a week or two .
As if this narrative were the narrative of MY life !
I execute my instructions , and I am paid for doing so .
If ever child were stricken with sincere grief , I was .
What do you look at me so hard for ? '
But I grant a sledge-hammering sort of merit in him ! ''
That was on a cold shrewd windy evening , after dark .
The young Jellybys are always up to something , '' said <NAME> .
‘ What do you mean ? ’ demanded <NAME> .
You give a good account of him .
The course of education is severe , but well devised , and manly .
She had replied , gratefully accepting his proposal .
‘ My friend has stolen a march upon me .
He had made no will , or she would probably have been poor .
And you read 'em ; do n't you ?
<NAME> <NAME> ’ s Predictions XLIX .
And now , <NAME> bless you , Walter !
There was an indistinct talk of its being wet .
It invaded her dreams and disturbed the whole night .
‘ Well , here ’ s a game ! ’ cried <NAME> .
<NAME> pound a year ! ’ ‘ <NAME> ! ’ croaked a strange voice .
But I have no doubt I ’ m asleep .
He had time to finish these letters before the lights were put out .
I should be quite proud of your wishing to see me , my dear .
‘ How ’ s the <NAME> of Tartary ? ’ said the old gentleman .
I shook my head , and said I thought not .
Will you promise me one thing , <NAME> ?
‘ Stop a bit , ’ replied <NAME> , suddenly recollecting himself .
The youngest and fairest are too often its chosen victims . '
You ’ ll be surprised how those girls are stowed away .
“ You see my state , ” said I .
“ Very much , ” said <NAME> , looking at me .
I asked her where she lived herself .
' ” <NAME> sat and rolled his eyes at the ceiling .
‘ <NAME> ’ t believe him , Mrs. Bounderby .
Would you not ? ” “ Truly , madame , I think so .
<NAME> <NAME> took her kindly from me .
‘ Not to me , I assure you .
A silence succeeding , I was undecided whether to go or stay .
‘ <NAME> , eh ? ’ said the voice .
Mrs <NAME> was SO glad of it .
He chiefly thought of what might have been , and what was not .
I smiled and shook my head. ``
‘ I must take my leave of you though .
For once you are right .
I could unkiver it for you with my broom if the gate was open .
‘ So I understand , ’ said I .
‘ No , ma , I am not going to be made so absurd .
Bless her , I knew she was !
We insensibly approached the old boat , and entered .
She had not been in bed , I found , for a long time .
But it seems to set it more right than it was last night .
The bells ceased as they had begun , together .
It was too old for him .
All the long day through , he seldom approached her room .
You have no occasion to come here to learn that , I suppose ? ''
She walked me on faster yet .
What has roughened your temper ?
Far be it from me to deny them .
He insulted me most grossly .
After a stroll about the town I went to <NAME> ’ s house .
‘ You were right , ’ answered <NAME> .
He spoke regretfully and lapsed for a moment into his weary condition .
It was the first time I had ever seen them opposed .
There is a hush through Mr <NAME> ’ s house .
The high chimney-stacks telegraph family secrets to him .
<NAME> <NAME> had rapidly grown worse ; before mid-night she was delirious .
Oh you naughty boy , to make me suffer such distress on your account !
‘ What CAN he have gone out for ?
We don ’ t do things by halves at our shop .
“ A good night for cutting off in , ” said <NAME> .
Tell your Uncle that you are appointed .
I say nothing of that .
He was awake -- wide awake -- to what had been going forward .
He roused himself , and cried out .
How can Trot and I do best , upon our means ?
Both gentlemen glanced at him , and seemed surprised at his assurance .
‘ I am safer there , in any case .
‘ Not a bit , ’ cried <NAME> .
<NAME> rusted in the locks of doors .
<NAME> <NAME> was as dead as a door-nail .
‘ No , no , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Not at all , ’ said Mr Meagles .
'What do you mean by that ? '
'Wo n't you tell your own B. ? '
The planking of the paddle-boxes had been torn sheer away .
I 'd give him up if he was to be boiled alive .
What a opportunity for a jining of hearts and housekeepings ! '
'Yes , here he is , ' replied <NAME> .
“ <NAME> if I know , ” said <NAME> .
With these words he left the room , followed by <NAME> .
We ’ ve got the laugh against him .
“ What are you staring at ?
<NAME> at this of mine .
It was bending eagerly towards me , and beckoning .
It survives for many reasons .
When he turned his head , the box was gone .
Dear me , yes , my dear , how stupid you are !
You know what you ’ ve got to do .
‘ A hundred and five pounds a year , ’ said my mother .
But the wintry morning wants him not and wakes him not .
The question I have to ask myself is , shall I marry him ?
Be comforted , and forgive me .
Folding his arms again , he then awaited <NAME> 's observations .
And he ’ s buried quite in this neighbourhood , you know .
`` What do you call wasting of it ? ''
‘ Call me five-and-thirty years of age .
‘ Hang it , no ; not bitterly , ’ laughed <NAME> .
Let us strike the key-note , <NAME> , before pursuing our tune .
‘ I ’ ll see if he ’ s disengaged now .
Have you finished ? ’ asked the strange man .
‘ I have heard of a daughter , and a son .
Mrs. Gummidge , leaning on her basket , made no observation .
I want you. ’ ‘ Let go , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
`` Over thirteen , sir , '' replied the child .
‘ I am going to finish this business according to my own opinions .
<NAME> <NAME> was not at home .
And corked herself as before .
<NAME> some blankets to the fire .
<NAME> -- '' <NAME> raises himself in his seat and stares at him fiercely .
<NAME> haste , sir , if you want to see her !
I am higher in the school , and no one breaks my peace .
says the surgeon ; `` that wo n't do ! ''
‘ I knew where you were bound to .
I never heerd a biled leg o ’ mutton called a swarry afore .
That bluff fellow ! ’ said <NAME> .
I feel sure he will return .
But you do ask my help .
<NAME> that cloak about you .
They were stately yet ; but the flush and pride of beauty were gone .
‘ Ha , ha , ha ! ’ laughed Mr Boffin .
But he said , no , it must be guardian now .
Under it , have I said ?
said the gentleman , `` Do n't you want to go there ? ''
‘ Nobody going with you , <NAME> , probably , ’ observed the man .
And added as he went upstairs .
And hope for the opposite party !
Ruined by a fatal inheritance , and restored through me ! ' ''
I watch him in his sleep .
‘ You have many resources against weariness at least , ’ said Mr Dombey .
‘ O , I understand you now , sir ! ’ cried <NAME> .
'No , ' replied Mrs. Bumble flatly .
I don ’ t in the least know what I meant .
‘ _We_ are , ’ said <NAME> , answering as if she had spoken .
what do you think of this , brother Ned ?
`` Understand me , my dear madam , he IS an excellent master .
Quite a <NAME> , and quite a Patriarch .
‘ A pupil ? ’ said <NAME> , raising his eyebrows .
`` And do you think <NAME> will make another voyage ? ''
‘ That ’ s an unanswerable reason , anyhow , ’ said <NAME> .
I alone know that your trumped-up story can not possibly be true .
The <NAME> Mrs Gowan is reminded that ‘ It Never Does ’ 9 .
'No more it has , ' said <NAME> .
‘ I am well assured of what you say , father .
<NAME> <NAME> is in the room , and comes to speak to me .
I go tomorrow. ’ ‘ <NAME> , ’ thundered <NAME> .
A fourth is building , and will soon be opened .
It ’ s worse here , than at <NAME> ’ s .
I am glad to see you Kit , I am rejoiced to see you .
`` How is <NAME> now , Mr .
‘ Ay , ay ? ’ thought the visitor .
‘ What clouds ? ’ said <NAME> .
Its close air was secret .
<NAME> immediately did the same .
demanded <NAME> , pushing the ale towards his new friend .
‘ You ’ re uneasy in your mind .
‘ Now , concerning these same wages , ’ said Mr Boffin .
I have no power over you whatever .
‘ I hope I see you well !
It falls out of her hand .
Just as we should have come upon him , he died insolvent .
What wretched amends I can make must be made .
‘ I couldn ’ t hear of it .
The gentle cheerfulness of <NAME> went to all their hearts .
It 'll do as well as anything else ! ''
After a short silence , he ventured to look round at his companion .
These kisses for the last time !
‘ I was not thinking of what I said ; I answered mechanically .
I do n't know what <NAME> 's engagements may be .
He had now fallen asleep , and was nodding in his chair .
'The man will be taken , ' he cried .
He my bad Angel , or anyone ’ s !
So I thought , at least , that evening .
‘ Oh , <NAME> ! ’ he said .
'A n't yer fond of oysters ? '
‘ His connections are of the best .
How is <NAME> and <NAME> , sir ?
I sat down with my hand on <NAME> 's neck and looked at <NAME> .
It makes me think so much -- ’ ‘ Of <NAME> , my love .
the old man hints with a leer .
I , too , a gentleman with manners and accomplishments to strike them dead !
‘ Exactly so , sir ! ’ returned <NAME> , blandly and buoyantly .
She rings the changes on ‘ em now .
She would be punished , not he .
replied the woman , laying her hand over the other 's mouth .
<NAME> Leicester begs to observe that wholly alters the case .
Is there no one here but you ? ’ ‘ Ah !
‘ At once , ’ replied <NAME> .
The wretch told me true .
<NAME> stepped forward , and bowed .
‘ It is very quiet , ’ said he .
Otherwise that morning ’ s confidence would have been Mr <NAME> ’ s last .
<NAME> <NAME> looked amazed , but said nothing .
he said , hastily concealing the key in his breast ; 'who 's that ?
<NAME> , darkness , dawn , sunrise , day .
`` You see everything , '' says <NAME> with admiration .
I Have a Change IV .
Whatever I acquired , I tried to impart to <NAME> .
But their manner was very curious .
<NAME> was it that didn ’ t mind what the clergyman said ?
I ought to have let it alone .
It was so good of her , and so encouraging to me !
`` But if the courses be departed from , the ends will change .
I hold no terms with <NAME> .
<NAME> night , my dear and sole remaining daughter .
‘ You are , <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> .
At least , perhaps I do , but I do n't think it matters .
`` It 's the boy , miss , '' said he .
The tide was running with them , the afternoon was charming .
A pretty thing at this time of day , certainly .
‘ But we DO want him , ’ urged Squeers .
‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ take a seat .
‘ No better woman anywhere ! ’ ‘ Look !
‘ I wouldn ’ t be too hard upon him at first .
<NAME> blushed , and stood up .
`` Mind you do it thoroughly , and do n't loiter .
' I see it is ma'am , ' replied <NAME> .
Mrs. <NAME> took possession of <NAME> , and I followed with the family .
There was yet another source of difference between us .
‘ I know it ’ s like me ! ’ she exclaimed .
`` Oh , cousin -- '' <NAME> hastily began .
My Lady , leaning forward , looks out of her window .
‘ “ Never in moderation ? ” asked the baron .
She goes next before him -- is gone ; the knitting-women count Twenty-Two .
This man has murdered his wife , and will probably be hanged .
He suffered heavily , did my unfortunate boy .
When she was gone , <NAME> sat down on the seat beside me .
‘ All right behind there , <NAME> ? ’ cried the coachman .
It was like striking out a horseshoe complete , in a single blow .
<NAME> <NAME> stared , but was helpless .
But I have no very strong recollection on the subject .
‘ Stop a bit , ’ said the turnkey .
‘ Confound them both ! ’ said he , looking at his watch .
I shall see you sometimes , my dear old Peggotty , there .
“ Well ? ” “ <NAME> , it is nothing .
I am not the fortune-teller. ’ ‘ True , ’ said <NAME> .
But he watched the <NAME> 's motions , and breathed quickly .
`` He was not ours , and I am not acquainted with him . ''
The several duties of instruction in this establishment were thus discharged .
‘ Give him a week , ’ said <NAME> , nodding his head prophetically .
It strikingly bespeaks the first-class man that <NAME> pre-eminently was .
We were enrolled under the denomination of the <NAME> .
‘ By a slip from <NAME> , <NAME> , we learn that the <NAME> .
The packet was in my hand .
`` The <NAME> and the <NAME> Law are in full vigour , then ? ''
Yet the room was all in all to me , <NAME> being in it .
‘ I am going out , ’ said <NAME> .
He decides that he can not understand it , though it was remarkably expressive .
I 've no -- no fault to find with you . '
That would not be generous , would it ?
The days of taking sanctuary are past .
She goes to it and returns , and looks yet more surprised .
‘ Nothing whatever , ma ’ am , ’ replied <NAME> .
says the trooper , looking about him for a counting-house .
He pondered about it for a moment , and gave it up .
Do you know who I am , <NAME> ?
That it is a very good connection , no one can deny .
The brother going to the door , the sister sat and listened timidly .
It was a dreadful thought .
He looked up into the gallery again .
Let me do something for him .
I do n't like your associates and do n't want you here .
You may go , and welcome .
I hurried then to the breakfast-table , and on it found a letter .
Mr <NAME> took <NAME> an interest in <NAME> , when we were there before .
We are alone together , and may ramble where we like .
He knew at whom that word pointed , and frowned heavily .
Faithfully. ’ A look of thankfulness and triumph lights the worn old face .
‘ You have seen my son , sir , ’ says the elder lady .
`` We were right , I need n't tell the present hearers .
Oh there ’ s Ma going up to somebody !
She seemed as much afraid of <NAME> , as <NAME> was amazed at her .
One can not help admiring the fellow .
<NAME> looks at the cushion but has not sufficiently recovered his late exertion .
`` Past it rather , '' <NAME> answered , shutting up his book .
it can not be ! ’ or words to that effect .
It wos a bit of fun of mine .
‘ What do you mean ? ’ was <NAME> ’ s counter inquiry .
You work hard at your learning , I know .
‘ I never was so vexed -- never !
Creeping away to the left here , <NAME> .
`` You are as punctual as the sun , '' said <NAME> .
I am so proud of you !
I said , startled for a moment .
Nevertheless , <NAME> is thinning fast , O little woman ! ''
There ’ s <NAME> ’ r <NAME> ’ s friend , my dear !
`` What do you mean , <NAME> ?
I was directing the new circulars till two this morning .
That his generosity rose above my disfigurement and my inheritance of shame .
‘ My friend , ’ said the thin gentleman .
‘ No , no ; what should I have to tell you , pretty !
<NAME> , you will be rewarded to-morrow. ’ ‘ Oh !
'To obey , ma'am , ' thundered <NAME> .
‘ There is the very letter I speak of .
It is painful to me to see you so weak .
My parting blessing on my love .
‘ So you have left <NAME> behind , aunt ? ’ said I .
‘ My dear sir , ’ interposed <NAME> .
The quarters of our soldiers at <NAME> , are finely and airily situated .
You to marry without beauty !
‘ Not a very busy day , my lady .
In leaving it , I shall not leave its lesson , trust me .
Your life is in your own hands .
He can not bear to see her sit apart .
<NAME> , bringing them to the table , sat down as clerk or notary .
The carrier put my box down at the garden-gate , and left me .
‘ Dear me , what a prophet you have proved yourself to be !
I have come legally to man ’ s estate .
There will be no more of it .
‘ You won ’ t forget these expressions , <NAME> ? ’ said <NAME> .
`` How much do you mean to say it wants then ? ''
<NAME> , if I do n't mistake ?
Like <NAME> , this young child was deaf , and dumb , and blind .
<NAME> sensation on the part of Mrs. Snagsby .
‘ With what then , Mr <NAME> ?
Your experience and knowledge will point out a way of doing it .
Another noticeable circumstance in Mrs. <NAME> was , that she was never hurried .
He is like his sister .
`` And not I alone , dear <NAME> .
And if you were , I wo n't be took the liberty with .
Do they look like that sort of thing ? ''
Your father has been dead a year and more .
But no , not a bit .
‘ What ’ s <NAME> ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
‘ Now , leave this house instantly ! ’ said <NAME> , starting up .
Another Discovery I had not the courage to see any one that night .
I did not know what to do .
‘ Has it reference to what you said just now ? ’ asked <NAME> .
This closed the proceedings of the evening .
I ’ m sure I hope he ’ ll go very soon .
He still pursued this subject as we turned in at the garden-gate .
A shot is to be taken at this man .
She arrived there in great agitation , and was insensible all through the night .
So am I. ’ <NAME> bowed .
He had been intimate there for a long time , but had been abroad .
<NAME> betide him if he does !
It may be lost by another accident -- to-morrow , any day . ''
<NAME> there ever such a sunny street as this Broadway !
There was a pause on both sides .
And Mr Kibble ; ain ’ t he Passenger , all over ?
Ha -- how is this ? ’ A pause .
Will my cousin <NAME> forgive me ? ''
‘ My dear , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ Mr .
I felt it as he spoke to me .
I can not bear to turn my face further away from it .
<NAME> <NAME> taken , my daughter !
<NAME> ’ at dost thee think o ’ thot ?
What if the spot awakened thoughts of death !
How could you do it ?
ON VIEW , ” and meet the lady , similarly labelled ?
“ <NAME> , ” said <NAME> , shaking hands with him .
I went on with my hair now , quite comfortably .
'It is , is it , sir ? '
exclaimed <NAME> with a sneer .
I told her how I loved her .
Is it still day ? ’ asked <NAME> .
I come myself , because of keeping it quiet and sociable .
`` I think I must have had some .
Mrs. <NAME> was pleased to see me , and so was <NAME> .
<NAME> is in the <NAME> , and doing extremely well .
Mr <NAME> eyed him aside , and seemed to relish his attitude .
`` I made him business proposals .
says <NAME> , `` Here I am , Mr .
More Warnings than One 38 .
‘ That is to say , our joint plans for him .
no , nor yet his half fardens -- half fardens !
“ Take nothing on its looks ; take everything on evidence .
‘ Quite sure of that , <NAME> .
<NAME> held her breath , and felt herself drawn on towards her .
<NAME> o ’ that ‘ ere nonsense .
You know you really must do it , '' says <NAME> .
‘ No , ’ returned <NAME> , stoutly .
There are reasons why I must say no more of that .
Hers was not the nature to spare him , and she had no compunction .
If their accomplices find us here , we are lost .
What do you think of that ? '
I do n't much expect it , but it might be . ''
'Have you nothing else to ask him , sir ? '
<NAME> Conveyancing would not come to <NAME> .
‘ The first matter relates to your governor , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
`` The kindest physician in the college , '' whispered <NAME> to me .
He hides his face behind no handkerchief , and looks before him .
I am sure I shall improve it in time .
`` And the letters are destroyed with the person ? ''
B. is dumb , <NAME> ’ am , ’ said the Major .
repeats <NAME> in a tone of surprise .
There was no doubt about that .
There are some little comforts that might smooth your life , and his .
If she favors you , love her .
“ If it is ? ” repeated his wife .
would I only come and look at the range ?
<NAME> , godmother ; I am going to expound .
says the trooper , pondering again .
As to myself , sir , the labourer is worthy of his hire .
This next must be it .
<NAME> would have surprised me .
`` Whose else 's do you think ? ''
I passed last evening in company with <NAME> .
As such I shall remain .
‘ Are you going through the court , sir ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
sad , sad ; very sad ! ’ said <NAME> .
Dream-like as the story was , it was true .
I see some good in this .
Sit down and tell me all about <NAME> .
Give them me here , ’ said <NAME> in a low voice .
A. <NAME> rose to order .
They were at fault too , and off the scent .
‘ What ’ s that to you , sir ? ’ replied <NAME> .
‘ Our little friends grow up around us .
<NAME> is your element , you have shone in it before .
It would be very new to have a mute in proportion , my dear .
A gentleman from the beginning , and a gentleman to the end .
said <NAME> with excessive urbanity .
<NAME> stood behind him watching him gravely .
The valet on the box evidently quaked .
I 'll speak in half a minute .
Damn you , keep back , if you 've a life to lose ! '
I think she was talking to herself .
I fancy I can guess whom you think THAT ’ S like .
You will respect my wish , I know .
See her knitting in my hand , and her empty chair ready for her .
If I may so express it , I was steeped in <NAME> .
said <NAME> , recoiling a little more .
There ’ s no rule against that .
`` Does the man generally sleep like this ? ''
A clerk hurried in with a bundle of papers , and stared about him .
What an excellent example of the power of dress , young <NAME> was !
People understood that <NAME> 's , in a stately way , tolerated the odd-job-man .
to be in the best spirits possible .
I heard her. ” “ ALL , ” <NAME> repeated , very emphatically .
Where shall I find you ? ''
Oh , my dear child , turn and look at me ! ''
‘ Ay , ay , pretty lady ; but not right .
And then he took us home and hammered us .
She kept house for us .
‘ Will you go with us now ?
said I , naturally amazed by the question .
Only his daughter had the power of charming this black brooding from his mind .
Mrs. Maylie was anxiously waiting to receive her son when he reached the cottage .
He was a humble individual .
Why have you done it ?
‘ <NAME> ’ t I ! ’ said <NAME> .
I was dragged by the neck into a corner .
`` Have I ever sought release ? ''
he says when there is silence .
They search the cupboard and the drawer of the ink-splashed table .
I hope it may prove a good one .
‘ It ’ s all along of you , <NAME> , I think .
For anything I care , also .
I ’ d got something to do , without thinking , indeed !
`` THE marshes , commander , '' returns <NAME> .
Now , pray say no more about it .
‘ Who judges my affection , or measures it out ?
Mr <NAME> was not expected by his own people that night .
By the time they were ready to depart , school had begun .
The greatest trial that I had , remained .
‘ She must take her chance .
‘ You asked me who she was , ’ said <NAME> .
I mean to explore those marshes for amusement .
I didn ’ t take the money all at once .
‘ <NAME> here , ’ he repeated , shedding tears .
<NAME> Leicester breaks silence with a harsh cry .
And I will walk here , though I am in my grave .
“ You bring 'em both to me. ” He tilted me again .
I see a <NAME> clock .
End of the <NAME> EBook of <NAME> , by <NAME>
Well , go on , '' said <NAME> .
‘ I never knew such a quantity !
<NAME> <NAME> ! ’ screamed a voice from the two-pair landing .
And <NAME> sister is my mother ! ''
‘ Will you call down <NAME> ? ’ cried <NAME> .
With them , or near them , are two children : boy and girl .
'Well , ' said Mrs. <NAME> , sharply .
I wants an end of being drawed like a badger .
Mrs <NAME> had heard of this affair from <NAME> .
<NAME> had been taken away from any part of the house .
O Mrs General , ask the <NAME> stones and bars .
<NAME> up , and tell us about it ! '
How do you _do_ , ma ’ am ?
I need n't tell you to be secret .
_I_ know it well , but do you know it ?
To both conditions , <NAME> was compelled to yield .
Ask him to come in. ’ Mr <NAME> appeared .
It nearly knocked me backwards .
‘ What am I to do ?
I call her mine , you see , <NAME> .
Within what time , did she think ?
‘ We ’ ll bring him in ! ’ say <NAME> and <NAME> .
We stole out quietly and without notice from any one except the man .
Was he reconciled to the decrees of fate ?
But perhaps I ought to do so .
You ’ ll find you ’ ve got quite enough to do .
That grandfather of his is too keen by half .
Where is he ? ’ asks <NAME> .
‘ Now , there ’ s a churchyard in <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
Behind them appeared the young <NAME> , in a body , exulting .
‘ <NAME> ’ t trouble yourself , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Left to be Minded , sir .
‘ Let ’ s have a look at you .
Yet to hear a female going on like that before <NAME> , <NAME> ! ''
‘ Yes ; you must have observed my anxiety about them to-day .
‘ I am acquainted with my faults .
The preliminaries are adjusted , and the butcher and myself stand face to face .
In a fortnight ’ s time , he became too ill to move about .
“ Shall I take her to a coach ?
These were not great services , you may say .
Such a number of men standing about !
<NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , or Death !
said my guardian laughingly to <NAME> and <NAME> .
He was clever in melodrama too , but too broad -- too broad .
Little Em ’ ly didn ’ t care a bit .
<NAME> ! ’ he muttered , looking at the direction .
Consider the trouble I have been in .
‘ Saw what , deary ? ’ ‘ Look at it !
You will not repeat this to her father .
'Yes , he 's a sortin ' the wipes .
He touched the spring of his repeater , to correct this most preposterous clock .
My property ! ’ returned my aunt .
‘ A most elegant appearance , ’ said <NAME> .
I denounced myself as a remorseless brute and a ruthless beast .
`` It was W. Grubble , miss . ''
I had liked it once , but once was not now .
And I ’ ll write to you , my dear .
Will he now allow me to throw myself on his friendly consideration ?
‘ Hear him ! ’ cried the Captain gravely .
Now , if you please , we will return to the carriage .
He had hoarded , all these years , I found , to good purpose .
`` We gave this out , sir .
In her joy and gratitude she kissed his hand .
Be gentle with her. ’ Day was breaking at <NAME> .
It was late last night when he went .
‘ My life -- ’ said the editor .
This was my only and my constant comfort .
But never mind , never mind !
My advice is , never do tomorrow what you can do today .
‘ One may do worse than that , ’ said <NAME> .
'First and foremost , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
I heard men speak together .
Nor was <NAME> behindhand in earning laurels wherewith to garnish himself and <NAME> .
Was his beloved brother <NAME> that man ?
But we hadn ’ t tried what it was to have the rest then .
'Thought it was what boy ? '
That 's the use of such a friend .
So no more of that .
'There 's not enough there , ' said the girl .
`` Except on military compulsion , I am not a man of business .
I Am Involved in <NAME> L. <NAME> ’ s <NAME> .
You would not deceive me ?
`` -- I do n't intend to do it . ''
Have you ever seen him before ? ” “ Once .
“ Where does my father get all that iron rust from ?
I 've no breath in my body !
I wearied them with new applications .
My disposition is , if I may say so , eminently practical .
“ Look at me , ” said <NAME> .
‘ Good-bye , <NAME> ! ’ stammers Mr Toots .
I am that much in earnest .
The reasons why <NAME> should not come to life .
Perhaps it may have a genius for the tight-rope .
Mrs. <NAME> sat waiting in another corner .
We fell away from one another without a word .
`` That 's just what I mean .
‘ <NAME> , ’ repeated the old lady .
‘ I have very particular business with him , ’ said <NAME> .
`` If he relents , '' she said , amazed , `` there is !
`` Old girl , '' says <NAME> , `` give him my opinion .
I made acquaintance with it only yesterday afternoon. ’ ‘ Ah !
Her son paused for a moment .
You are a good girl .
And now she ’ s quiet again .
<NAME> pride would go to work and do it .
`` By that means you got promotion ?
muttered <NAME> , grinding his teeth .
She lay there , who had so lately spoken to my mother .
Mr <NAME> ’ s demeanour towards herself changed .
'All right , ' replied <NAME> , scratching his head .
`` You are prospering , please the Powers ? ''
He is a slow-torturing kind of man .
‘ You know what it is to love your child .
'You had better leave him . '
‘ Dear boy ! ’ said the gentleman .
`` Our contract is an old one .
I saw in this , a reason for her being beforehand assigned to me .
You may not , you know .
Why do you talk to me of brothers ?
You ’ d keep us poor if you could , wouldn ’ t you ?
There are three free-schools already erected , and in full operation in this city .
One child was gone , and one child left .
The golden waters were not there .
By and by my strength began to be restored .
' A young fogle-hunter , ' replied the man who had <NAME> in charge .
What does our dastardly contemporary mean ?
His deportment would have been fierce in a butcher or a brandy-merchant .
That the father was still living .
This was not quite the last of <NAME> ’ s , however .
We have always been a family remarkable for effort .
‘ <NAME> in these parts , sir ? ’ says I .
A curse upon this roof that gave me shelter !
Whether I should be taken into custody , and sent to prison ?
It cheers me to hear you say so .
I ’ ll take any part in anything .
You shall see the house if you like .
‘ What do you pretend to be ? ’ said Mr Pancks .
He recovers in a moment .
Here he is , very muddy , very hoarse , very ragged .
<NAME> says what <NAME> says .
It an ’ t much , but it ’ s at your service .
<NAME> <NAME> was the sole actor .
You will be well and happy ! '
‘ You ’ ll think this tolerably strong .
‘ This is another of the consequences of being poor !
‘ Mind it ! ’ repeated Mrs. Lillyvick contemptuously .
But , such awful workers , and such awful work !
<NAME> was the next to break the silence that ensued between us .
Looking up , he saw a very little creature at a neighbouring window .
Go in for money , my love .
Kiss me , my dear girl. ’ So , his daughter kissed him .
‘ What should I get by sending to you ? ’ returned <NAME> .
'Yer do n't know who I am , I suppose , Work'us ? '
Now I come to Mrs. Woodcourt .
Oh , my eye , my eye , wot a blow it is ! '
But <NAME> isn ’ t to complain for all that .
‘ <NAME> and look , ’ said <NAME> to her visitors .
<NAME> hope was in it .
With your youth and attractions ?
Here ’ s another ready for ye , deary .
Let it stand in these pages as <NAME> .
When shall they be moved ?
‘ When he can pay , sir , ’ replied <NAME> .
“ Nevertheless , you shall not get the better of me .
‘ I am glad you approve of them , ’ said Mr Merdle .
Even he only comes twice a week to sit in chambers .
Thinking that might be too lively , he corrected it with a sigh .
‘ Oh dear no , partner , ’ retorted <NAME> .
Now do n't be troublesome , that 's a good soul ! ''
‘ Well , ’ said my conductor to one of the three young women .
That fact I am acquainted with .
‘ Very well , ’ said <NAME> .
The room was quiet , and the lamp burnt on the table .
I despise such a weak fantasy. ” Thereupon she is pleased to compliment .
“ I was not quite sure , sir , but I thought so .
It was a dark night , with a many stars a-shining .
Or <NAME> Eyes and the wolf against one another ?
‘ How could the time be at hand unless the fellow-traveller was ?
The old chimney quivered with the shock , but stood it bravely .
Did n't he take us all in ?
God bless you ! ’ ‘ Good-bye , <NAME> .
There is no one in that room behind you !
<NAME> has told <NAME> the truth .
`` There are two branches to this subject , <NAME> , '' says <NAME> .
The old man looks at him under his hand .
Judge for her , sir , judge for her .
<NAME> , I hope we may be better acquainted .
But I never can forget that you were very good to me .
To him , life and the world were nothing else .
‘ Of course , ’ replied <NAME> , <NAME> .
I never could do it .
And no doubt he will .
and gave him the price of a supper and a night 's lodging .
Buffers are even overheard to whisper Thir-ty Thou-sand Pou-nds !
‘ Let you and I try to make this all right .
What Mr Harmon risks , is quite another pair of shoes .
The market is abundantly supplied ; and provisions are exceedingly cheap .
‘ Is she alone ? ’ inquired the old gentleman .
‘ You have been ill ? ’ ‘ Very , ’ replied <NAME> .
When these at length cease , all seems more mysterious and quiet than before .
'From the country , I see , sir ? '
‘ Whom I have met at your house , ’ says <NAME> .
'She deserved what he said , and worse . '
`` One thousing seven hundred and eighty-two , if you please , sir .
This she did upon her knees , humming a lively little tune the while .
‘ I am afraid it is an unhealthy occupation , ’ said <NAME> .
The separation has not made the impression on me , that other separations have .
It had been moving towards me , but it stood still .
‘ A curious monomaniac , ’ said <NAME> .
“ I have seen <NAME> .
<NAME> ’ s mother ’ s family was the <NAME> family .
`` Now , I tell you what , <NAME> ! ''
<NAME> nodded in the affirmative .
a very few words more !
He wo n't hold off , and he wo n't come on .
‘ Who ’ s he , <NAME> ? ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Neither Mr nor Mrs <NAME> had ever heard our name .
‘ But you next ! ’ said I .
Upon the brink of the abyss .
That , however , still , is not the point .
You have never been a lodger .
I knew the worst now and was composed to it .
All I possess is freely yours .
It requires no discernment to perceive that he is warmed and refreshed .
It would not enable Her to go to see him .
<NAME> keeps the keys of his work mostly .
They all know it in <NAME> .
<NAME> parent promptly resorts to anathematization , and turns him out .
In voice , husky and low .
There ’ s nothing else , except the waiter .
They cry for joy , my darling , ’ her husband struck in .
“ What 's the matter ? ” said <NAME> .
‘ He admires you , and has a high opinion of you .
For the love of the great God !
Possibly to roam the house-tops again and return by the chimney .
‘ It will soon be over , dear , ’ said <NAME> patiently .
I think for you ; that 's enough for you .
We will go with you .
`` Precisely as usual , if you please . ''
`` <NAME> , '' said <NAME> , appearing enlightened all in a moment .
“ <NAME> Mrs. B. , I shall not be at home till to-morrow .
Besides , it ’ s the brightest time of the whole day .
You see what a wreck he is .
As he spoke he caught sight of <NAME> and <NAME> .
‘ Of humanity , ’ replied the other , sternly .
'She 'll go , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
asked <NAME> with a motion towards the door .
said the Jew , stopping short .
She ’ s very hard to carry on with , my dear .
“ I am what you have made me .
<NAME> , then , I ’ ll tell you how it is .
<NAME> , how little you know of the truth !
THAT war n't like Chancery practice though , says you ! ''
After which , there was a profound silence .
Drowning men come to the surface three times they say .
“ But he has been -- been found .
I can not possibly be hard upon your brother .
It is what I should revel in myself .
It was a startling likeness , and necessarily had a startling look .
You are company to us both .
I really don ’ t know what to say to this gentleman .
Luckily , I came upon my back at exactly the right moment .
‘ I know that I belong to it .
‘ Stand by , old friend ! ’ cried the <NAME> .
They gazed upon each other in silence .
<NAME> <NAME> held fast by that other interview he was to have with <NAME> .
These two might have been begotten , born , and bred , in <NAME> .
A very little more is all permitted to me .
it was lucky it was only me that heard you by chance .
Signed upon oath , <NAME> , <NAME> .
I know what you mean , ’ cried <NAME> .
No man-of-war was ever kept more spick and span from careless touch .
What have you been doing to yourself ? '
There were four in the room , and she shut them all .
or I shall tread upon your heels . '
Speakers and listeners strolled away , and mixed with other groups .
I meet the butcher by appointment .
‘ Yonder , ’ she answered , pointing with her hand .
`` What are you up to , now ? ''
Keep close to that idiot girl .
I ’ ll go away directly you tell me to , <NAME> .
I think it can not be too prominently kept before the whole establishment .
'Heaven bless you for your goodness ! '
‘ He will be fresh enough , presently ! ’ said I .
It may have been a signal for loosening the general tongue .
Seventy-six hundred thousand million of parcels of bank-notes ! ''
It was here that I took <NAME> aside , and received his promise .
In fact , he said , he had no head for detail .
‘ This is <NAME> ’ s , ’ said the young woman .
‘ Mr Carker , <NAME> , as you know , possesses my confidence .
I have bethought me of all that gracious and compassionate history .
‘ Now , <NAME> , ’ said the host , reloading his own gun .
What did she say to that ? ’ asked <NAME> .
Oh , my lungs and liver , what do you want ?
‘ Why , no , ’ said <NAME> .
He ’ ll be conscious when he next opens them .
I need scarcely ask you if you are come on such an errand .
I have seen her shine , sir .
‘ Shocking circumstances occur , <NAME> , ’ says <NAME> .
I almost believe you must have thought of me a little .
‘ But tell me one thing before we part , dearest <NAME> .
We eyed one another narrowly in passing , and with no favour .
I ’ ll try how true and grateful you can be .
‘ <NAME> up , sir , ’ said Mrs. Crupp .
says the constable , giving him a passionless shake .
I told him I cared for no weather and was warmly clothed .
Do I complain for my own sake ?
'Why , what evil wind has blowed you here ? '
God bless you ! ” they always seemed to understand , and answered pleasant .
‘ Is he drunk ? ’ <NAME> made no reply .
<NAME> mother , perhaps ? ’ <NAME> sighed .
But I had not the clue then .
‘ I was out last night with my master , ’ replied the stranger .
I must give in to the terms .
I know what you mean .
I particularly noticed that she had a very quick , bright eye .
The first thing to be done is to view the body . ''
It ai n't a long walk , and it 's an early one .
Numbers of the drowning thrown upon a rock .
‘ <NAME> has not been here long , has he ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
I must go with him. ’ ‘ With him , aunt ?
You look so. ’ ‘ Yes , indeed , sir , ’ answered <NAME> .
The livery of his degradation !
Take time by the forelock .
<NAME> is charmed to hear that her delight is come .
And <NAME> ’ s an extraordinary manager !
“ Good patriots will know what that means .
Why give it as a reason for not coming now ? ''
But you have the remedy in your own hands .
' I see her now , ' cried the spy .
Almost at the first word , <NAME> started and became deeply attentive .
‘ I hope so , ’ rejoined <NAME> .
‘ I am going to <NAME> , ’ I said .
‘ Won ’ t anybody enliven us ? ’ said the chairman , despondingly .
She gave birth to a boy , and died .
The man did so , and held the door open .
'How should I know , my dear ? '
But no Peg was there .
‘ I thankee , sir , ’ he answered .
That ’ s it ! ’ said <NAME> , pointing at her .
‘ Nothing but a do , ’ remarked <NAME> .
At length I gave ’ em the slip , and turned in here .
<NAME> emptied it to the last drop and began again .
‘ I will do all I can to imitate her , ’ said <NAME> .
He put an arm about her , seeing her likely to sink down .
says <NAME> , evidently pleased though , and well pleased too .
<NAME> fat private double letter , sealed with ducal coronet .
`` So I am told , '' returned the second .
‘ Yes , for the time that I remain here , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ But she was pleasing : ’ said <NAME> : ‘ extremely so .
‘ Wery good , sir , ’ replied <NAME> .
I have been trouble enough to my belongings in my day .
This brought <NAME> himself and <NAME> on their legs also .
Nothing else. ’ ‘ So I found , ’ said <NAME> .
I WILL call ‘ em the <NAME> .
‘ You ’ re quite welcome to it .
‘ Hear me speak a word .
In these circumstances he had nothing for it but to follow her to town .
He was riding , in imagination , some desperate steeplechase at that moment .
`` No thanks to me , I am sure .
`` I am the last man in the world for such a thing .
‘ How are we this morning ?
Now , the rest of the wedding party alight , and enter after them .
The only question was , where .
'Dear <NAME> , I know it all . '
What will be , will be .
Did you say what does it mean , my good friend ? ''
The saddest tomb I saw there was ‘ The <NAME> ’ Grave .
‘ Why , isn ’ t it obvious ? ’ reasoned <NAME> .
<NAME> said dubiously , did he really think so ?
To the best of my belief , those efforts entirely failed .
`` In pattens I am , sir , '' she said quickly .
The caravan followed at no great distance .
he asked , catching up a heavy stick which was standing in a corner .
‘ I beg your pardon , but professional profundity must be exact .
However , you did see her , and that ’ s useless now .
Well , is it good ? ’ ‘ Oh !
‘ They have never asked me what my religion is .
The door of the late Secretary ’ s room stood open .
So very small and skinny .
My man ’ s out , and the sun is hot upon my room .
‘ No better time in the day , ’ said <NAME> .
as pretty too , as many !
The next domestic trial we went through , was the <NAME> of <NAME> .
‘ But where ’ s my pretty boy ? ’ said <NAME> .
inquired <NAME> , looking up very quickly .
‘ Bear a hand with this !
Yes she could , and so she did .
said <NAME> , laying his hand upon his arm .
<NAME> <NAME> repeated his request .
<NAME> , how I loved her !
`` It IS exposed , '' said <NAME> .
It has been painful and difficult , but it is done .
I can bear much ; but not too much .
That is the may I put it .
It was in vain to try .
I do , when I 'm at home , ' replied the boy .
But <NAME> ’ s feelings were beyond the power of suppression .
It takes <NAME> some time to ask this .
' ” “ I can bear it , ” said <NAME> .
‘ That is what I wish to have. ’ ‘ But I say .
‘ I was aware of his being married again .
Why don ’ t you make him speak ?
We felt it better to withdraw and leave them uninterrupted .
‘ <NAME> , <NAME> , you would wear out a Saint .
Besides , it is a privilege and pleasure to confide in my Little Dorrit .
I heard them speaking on the staircase .
For that the poor child thanked me with her whole heart .
There were a great many ink bottles .
Now , with reference to placing <NAME> with some sufficiently eminent practitioner .
When you told me I had been dreaming .
Such a thing was never to be .
`` How do you do , sir ? ''
‘ Yes , to-night , ’ replied the child .
Was it a selfish error that was leading me away ?
‘ You may leave the box , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> was the first to speak .
“ How can you think of such a thing ?
<NAME> , persevering , steady , acute in business .
`` I think I do know , '' said <NAME> .
said the voice through the key-hole .
He turned it gently , and sidled his face in , round the door .
<NAME> is at home , and <NAME> will fetch him .
It was a day of some wild rejoicing , and a festival .
Do you want me to be trampled upon and stoned ?
The following are a few specimens of the advertisements in the public papers .
That ’ s not possible ? ’ ‘ Don ’ t tremble .
‘ There may be work to be got , ’ she said .
We found them in <NAME> 's garret .
<NAME> in. ’ Mr <NAME> stepped in and shut the door .
Keep as clear of him as you can .
'Take care I do n't overdo it .
That ’ s what I want you to be .
That 's where I see him stritched out .
Not a hair of her head shall be harmed before Thee .
‘ And a bird-cage , sir , ’ says <NAME> .
‘ Well , <NAME> is a pretty name. ’ ‘ Very .
When he came back , <NAME> was at his heels .
‘ I don ’ t know , ’ replied <NAME> , with equal carelessness .
It was enough. ’ ‘ A million pardons !
All the middle-aged clerks think their families too large .
'Wo n't he growl at all , when he hears a fiddle playing !
I only wish to do my duty to <NAME> .
I shall have no peace or patience till you come .
He was not fond of us .
I have the deepest sympathy with them .
‘ Let me see : yes , I had been out .
‘ I will tell you the reason one day , but not now .
The noise of some one stumbling hastily into the room , roused him .
`` He is living concealed at <NAME> 's , '' said I .
`` And to confer upon me the favour of your distinguished recommendation ? ''
It was late when the old man came home .
‘ Nothing changed , ’ said the traveller , stopping to look round .
<NAME> and <NAME> , we had better say no more about it .
You must not remain here .
‘ Such a thing has been .
we must wait for someone , ’ answered the old woman .
I have come here safe .
‘ Where do you live ? ’ said the magistrate .
Well , he said , here he was !
We were a capital party. ’ This was Mr <NAME> ’ s invariable habit .
‘ You _SHALL _ go , ’ said <NAME> .
`` No one , <NAME> , I think ? ''
‘ You don ’ t seem to mind it , ’ observed <NAME> .
'You may say that , <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> thoughtfully .
How shall we interpret the oracle , you and I and the old intriguer ?
I know the latent power of <NAME> .
‘ He never did it ! ’ cries <NAME> ’ s mother .
'It was n't me indeed , sir .
It is like—it is like— ’ ‘ Like a dream ? ’ suggested <NAME> .
<NAME> knew when a fish leaped , by his starting and glancing round .
No ; the office is one thing , and private life is another .
Now , what are the Facts of this case ?
We must go in different directions , seeking aid .
<NAME> ever any poor girl so ill-used by her servants as I am !
‘ I ’ ll take care on him , sir , ’ replied <NAME> .
Here , they encountered another party , mad like themselves .
‘ You ’ re perfectly right , my love , they have come home .
<NAME> is the mature fruit .
May I hope so ? ’ ‘ I do not .
Gives it that his cousin is out of town .
‘ He changed ! ’ returned the other .
‘ In a poor way , <NAME> , I am afraid .
I had not an opportunity of speaking to <NAME> , for ten minutes .
<NAME> was fast developing a perfect genius for home .
A gentleman can make up his mind to stand up against almost any blow .
But I ’ ll go spend it , deary .
But who knows how many are true ? ’ ‘ To be sure .
Do the rheumaticks keep off pretty well , <NAME> ’ am ?
‘ Get your hat , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
' I promise you solemnly , ' answered <NAME> .
I particularly wish to see <NAME> .
And why not ? ’ returned <NAME> , with the same joyful candour .
He had known , to use his words , a peck of trouble .
She is indispensable to me .
Why , as to me , what had I to forgive !
`` You have never seen the like of me before ! ''
said the husband in answer to her look .
<NAME> ’ s Progress and Christening 6 .
My guardian delicately dismissed this remark without making any verbal answer .
`` Why , I generally say customer myself , '' replies <NAME> .
‘ Very much so indeed , <NAME> , ’ rejoins <NAME> .
The water was out , and the ditch a bed of mud .
`` How does it stand now ? ''
I married him to do this , and this supports me . ''
It was impossible to bear such torture .
And what has he come about , <NAME> ? ’ said <NAME> .
But , I must say -- '' `` No , you must n't say !
He deceived a worthy man once , and we were the innocent cause .
‘ Didn ’ t I tell you so ? ’ said Mr Chuckster .
He stares at it , aghast .
`` Judy , '' says <NAME> , `` bring the pipe . ''
‘ I dare be bound for that Nell .
‘ Of course I do , ’ replied <NAME> .
It was like you to remember the circumstance ; I had quite forgotten it .
‘ <NAME> ’ t be angry with me .
I was very retired and quiet , and tried to be very diligent .
There I grant you , comrade .
And how ’ s our stock in trade , partner ?
`` Then take them away , '' says <NAME> .
'What do you mean , <NAME> ?
‘ But , aunt , ’ said <NAME> , coaxingly , ‘ now listen .
'Spend it , sir , ' says I .
`` That was me , '' said <NAME> .
Common people to talk of Mr Dombey and his domestic affairs !
Go along and find 'em . ''
Ai n't you a-trembling while I speak , sir ? '
I have one other petition .
He seemed , to her , to have so little to do with it .
'He says true enough there ! '
‘ Not on any account , ’ replied his master .
I am afraid of you. ’ ‘ Afraid of me ? ’ ‘ Yes .
Here 's poison by the bed !
That is not the way to befriend Mr <NAME> .
‘ Let me alone , imperence , ’ said the young lady .
He strikes into that path , and walks up to the wicket .
`` Hither , child , towards my <NAME> 's pillow .
Why , that ’ s in a churchyard .
If the fire will burn ( it _will_ sometimes ) we are pretty cheerful .
‘ Those are not good prospects for a painter , ’ said <NAME> .
'Dark and heavy it is too .
But I love children , and Four-pence a week is Four-pence .
The <NAME> was for the free exercise of <NAME> ’ s judgment .
‘ Has morning come already ? ’ asked <NAME> , sitting up in bed .
‘ I always am , ’ says <NAME> .
The <NAME> remained in the little parlour until it was quite dark .
But nothing could have made head against the depressing influence of the general body .
My uncle did so , and I honour him for it .
It certainly was ; for they had been two kindred spirits .
'Do n't they holler out a good deal , and scratch sometimes ? '
‘ I shall shed the blood of that impish wretch !
Our hour is three. ’ I bowed .
There was a dim light in two windows on the first-floor .
I will not rest a moment. ” “ That 's well .
I have no home left .
‘ Look at that man , ’ whispered <NAME> , emphatically .
But this was not all .
He has minded the office again .
The organ will be sent from <NAME> .
His daughter did the same . '
`` That 's the whole of it , is it , <NAME> ? ''
`` Very true , my dear , '' says <NAME> .
I haven ’ t had my clothes brushed .
<NAME> of that which sets a waste between us evermore .
You have told me so , father .
<NAME> DRIVER ( still to the horses ) .
I am going to be married to <NAME> !
“ Very tall and dark , ” I told him .
Another Mother and Daughter 35 .
I never saw such faltering , such confusion , such amazement and apprehension .
But , very well , very well .
When it was , they would begin their preliminary advances .
“ Then you have left the forge ? ” I said .
'When could I see him ? '
‘ I _know _it is , ’ said <NAME> .
That 's what the old girl started on .
But I have no doubt he 'll do it . ''
After several turns , he sat down again .
The <NAME> project at present employs my whole time .
No , she was not an only child ; she had a half-brother .
asked <NAME> , shaking his head .
It may take a little time , but you do n't mind that .
Mrs <NAME> has a wonderful memory .
‘ And I wish I was dead too .
You know with whom forgiveness lies , as the highest attribute conceivable .
It was fine in the morning , particularly in the fine mornings .
There is nothing little to the really great in spirit .
He was not crying when he made the pauses I shall express by lines .
‘ A heart well worth winning , and well won .
‘ A little half-hour after mid-day. ’ ‘ Good !
said <NAME> ; 'he do n't know what 's good for him . '
If ever <NAME> had a wife on earth , that wife is certainly you .
There , it blows nothing but dust .
‘ <NAME> , <NAME> ’ r <NAME> ! ’ he returned .
‘ You exalt them , and slight me .
I said it , you know , ” said <NAME> .
`` It is coming fast , <NAME> . ''
The little doctor thirsted for his life .
‘ It must have come from one of them , ’ thought <NAME> .
‘ I am engaged to another young lady .
But he has never looked after them .
But I will not digress .
said <NAME> as I called his attention to him .
`` I am very glad indeed to hear it , '' says <NAME> .
Say no more of it , <NAME> .
Let the guilty man go unpunished .
‘ He was removed by night .
The spinster aunt appeared ; she smiled , and beckoned them to walk quicker .
‘ For no better reason than because I ’ m in the humour .
I found him as my aunt had described him .
I ’ ve got them , and I ’ ve got you .
‘ You are sure ? ’ ‘ If you please .
In which the <NAME> gets into Trouble 10 .
‘ Hear this lady with her If !
So he does not look out of window .
Perhaps the latter possibility may be the nearer to the truth .
I shall shut up this shop to-night .
It could n't have come about better !
You know my name : out with it !
I say nothing in defence of pride , but I am proud .
'She durst not refuse me then .
He was shown up-stairs , and found <NAME> at her work , alone .
Now , that handsome sum of money , <NAME> , is your own .
`` And yet , '' said I , `` I miss some familiar object .
'It 's of no use saying any , ' replied <NAME> .
But he is indeed , ’ said Mr Garland .
I put up at the <NAME> and nowhere else .
To describe the confusion that ensued would be impossible .
‘ “ Good-morning , <NAME> , ” said the widow .
`` <NAME> , what do YOU say ? ''
‘ She has been my nurse , ’ <NAME> answered .
`` Who has locked you up here alone ? ''
Is that you , <NAME> , sir ? '
‘ Now , indeed , you may be proud .
But I soon became used to it .
You did n't know him , did you ? ''
You are looking charming to-day !
“ We shall not be separated long .
‘ <NAME> ago. ’ ‘ Let me make , then , a fair proposal .
It might have been keenness , but it looked remarkably like misery .
Put that in your pocket , and shut yourself up again . '
and then counted up to twelve , and said , 'Hush ! '
<NAME> must be brought up to the mark .
I know her by the face !
‘ See here , <NAME> , ’ she said .
I was not actively ill-used .
He passes much of his time here .
“ Go and wait outside , <NAME> , ” said the clerk .
<NAME> <NAME> young again !
Mr Headstone is perfectly devoted to you .
‘ I wish however to see Mr Barnacle. ’ ‘ But I say .
It was all as silent and dark as ever .
‘ Never you mind , <NAME> , ’ retorted <NAME> .
The man seemed to have brightened with the night , as he went on .
Now , let us talk about something else . '
You can ’ t think what an interest I have in you .
‘ He is off , ’ said Mrs. Squeers .
‘ He ’ ll come back , I suppose ? ’ murmured <NAME> .
I think there ’ s one upon the table .
You shall see the apartment that I told you you could occupy .
A change had stolen , and was stealing yet , over the patient heart .
said <NAME> , tapping the man on the back .
You are the levers of the <NAME> Office , and the rulers of men .
`` I am not sure that I understand you .
She also had upon her face and arms the marks of ill usage .
‘ This must be some drunken fellow , ’ said <NAME> .
I tell thee it is always advancing .
‘ Not at all , I assure you .
Supposing that the tune allotted to him was the <NAME> in <NAME> .
What did he live upon ?
You have got a Pa ! ’ I trembled , and turned white .
His name is <NAME> , otherwise Provis .
He sat , still and silent , while the landlord wrote .
‘ Has not a professional air .
`` Do you contemplate undeceiving <NAME> to-night ? ''
‘ Are you ready ? ’ ‘ I am ready , <NAME> .
It was the word and the action of a moment .
Always active and penetrating in such matters , his lynx-eyed vigilance now increased twenty-fold .
<NAME> ’ s always dying , or going and doing something uncomfortable in it .
There was no such thing as I , within my knowledge .
Hey ? ’ repeated the man with the wooden leg .
Which of the two goes first ?
‘ No -- never ! ’ replied the astonished <NAME> .
On the Day of Judgment .
<NAME> , obstinacy , reputation for fine feeling , were all against it .
He had his sister 's soul and person .
‘ Such kindness as he knows , he regards her with , I believe .
He then came back , and took up his former position .
<NAME> 's humble servant , ' said <NAME> , bowing with grotesque politeness .
It has fallen into Mr Fledgeby ’ s hands .
‘ I can not bear these close eternal streets .
The board presented it to me on <NAME> 's morning , <NAME> .
<NAME> was falling just then , however .
He received me with absolute enthusiasm .
“ I do n't want to go .
Mr <NAME> smiled , and said , <NAME> , well !
Indeed , he came in and turned our conversation .
The night before last was a dreadful one at sea .
‘ Winkle -- <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> ; ‘ what does this mean ?
The old man then shook hands with his tempters , and withdrew .
The soul recoils from food at such a moment , miss . ''
'Did you know that before , <NAME> ? '
‘ Door , <NAME> ! ’ cried <NAME> .
Many had been personally known to <NAME> in their lives .
This young lady was no match for <NAME> .
`` Your papa , no doubt , considers his family . ''
Hither I directed my walk .
I had heard , like most other men , of <NAME> schools .
They wore the dress that I likewise knew well .
It was not of the least use my trying to look wise .
‘ You ’ ll never find my wife wrong .
‘ You must come again , mind , whenever you have an afternoon .
But it had long since gone to ruin .
‘ Then you don ’ t ask my advice , ’ says <NAME> .
That ’ s meat and drink to us .
He made only one thing clear .
I seemed able to do nothing naturally .
`` Against -- '' `` Oh , dear yes , against you .
Surprises , like misfortunes , rarely come alone .
You see I am collected .
‘ <NAME> ’ s Meadows ! ’ ejaculated the other , with profound contempt .
He will never prosper in his inheritance otherwise .
‘ <NAME> , ’ called out <NAME> to his master .
I feared to think so , then , but I know it now .
‘ I have been here before .
And you will tell your poor brother so , won ’ t you ?
Looking up , I saw my little maid shivering from head to foot .
“ My dear doctor , what is my wife ’ s complaint ?
“ Wot ’ s the matter ? ” says the doctor .
‘ That ’ s a part of what he says , ’ added <NAME> .
‘ I have told him , ’ said my aunt , with a nod .
The condition is laid down .
'What do you think of the old ladies ? '
‘ What have I done ? ’ said <NAME> .
As <NAME> put out his hand to open it , <NAME> caught his hand .
It was the complete idea of snugness .
The steps creaked beneath its noiseless tread , and it was gone .
I tried scolding and scolding failed .
It happens pretty often : but I always know it .
‘ I am not listening , ’ said the dressmaker .
Then <NAME> bolts the something , as if desperately resigning himself to indigestion .
It is a demd horrid dream .
“ Not a bit of it , ” said he .
Ever my guide , and best support !
I soon found myself very busy .
I thought you did. ’ ‘ No , I didn ’ t .
In happier times , ” addressing me , “ I think you took sugar ?
I ask for nothing ; there are funds in hand .
A Miser ’ s <NAME> of <NAME> .
Give it here , you avaricious old skeleton , give it here ! '
Meanwhile , <NAME> was rapidly recovering .
The completion of this labour occupied them about a fortnight .
`` Does his wife know of it ? ''
`` <NAME> said they war n't , in MY hearing , '' returned <NAME> .
`` Judy , '' says the old man .
‘ Who ’ s there ? ’ said <NAME> , starting up in bed .
'Do n't be frightened , miss ; I ai n't much injured .
I shall be happy anywhere .
I ’ ll send him to you when you ring for him , sir .
This horrible condition brought on other fits .
‘ <NAME> is my brother , <NAME> ? ’ says <NAME> .
‘ That ’ s his luggage that he is a sitting upon now .
roared <NAME> , kicking up his legs in an ecstasy .
‘ What are you doing of ?
‘ Is it your doing ! ’ she retorted .
I never walk out with my husband but I hear the people bless him .
‘ It does me good to see you in the air and light .
<NAME> ’ s the chap for me .
<NAME> <NAME> grasped his hand , and vowed eternal friendship and remorse .
I could not make my darling out .
The stranger was still reading ; he looked up and started .
‘ A blow , <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> .
'You move on , ' he ses .
That if there was anything to be blown upon , it IS blown upon .
There is only one other point on which I offer a word of remark .
The <NAME> nodded his head , and waited for something else .
He can ’ t settle in one place five minutes .
‘ Who passes by this road so late ?
Of course I know that <NAME> considers me more than himself always .
A band of music comes and plays .
In the evening there was rowing on the river .
If I ain ’ t been azackly as intimate with you .
thank you , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ “ Three serious footmen , ” ’ said <NAME> , impressively .
I have the honour to attend court regularly .
Who knows ? ’ ‘ Who , indeed ! ’ snarled <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> knows that very well .
I had hoped to have no other companion than Agnes .
‘ We don ’ t want to know anything about that , here .
No half measures with me .
He received us cordially , and made friends with <NAME> in a moment .
‘ Very good , ’ said the dwarf .
Where are the happy pair , for whom this brave home is waiting ?
Mrs <NAME> thought it scarcely as warm as it had been yesterday .
‘ What is all this , sir ?
‘ All right , <NAME> , all right .
Left in a ditch , <NAME> ; only think ! '
‘ Well , the <NAME> did , ’ said <NAME> .
I suppose we must make the best of it ! ''
Though I am not young , either .
But it is possible that the reproach was within herself .
The effect was almost as brief as sudden .
`` Nothing particular , '' returns the trooper .
<NAME> , you are a man of the world .
‘ Indeed I don ’ t know , ’ returned the child .
Mrs Flintwinch has another Dream 16 .
What I reaped , I had sown .
Then you have done all you have got to do .
O Tom , have you nothing to tell me ?
‘ Go up , for the love of <NAME> .
“ I 've been done everything to , pretty well -- except hanged .
I think I see myself .
You would n't believe how those two fellows went at it !
“ Do you , dear boy ? ” and quietly sat down again .
`` Good morning , <NAME> , good morning ! ''
The idea of <NAME> with designs or plans , or knowledge of consequences !
What a world of honey have we here .
says the ungrateful villain , `` what 's the use of _this_ to me ?
'Heartily sorry , ' he said , 'for your good wife .
I have prayed over them , oh , I have prayed so much .
‘ Who has sent you so far by yourself ? ’ said I .
There is no doubt that <NAME> was dead .
See here , on my arm !
This , you know , I am speaking of .
Let him have his little income , and come and live with me .
‘ Put ‘ em under the pump , ’ suggested a hot-pieman .
And you burst out and stopped him !
You didn ’ t say what meal , my dear .
On Ralph they produced not the slightest effect .
`` My dear , '' said <NAME> , `` the children !
A Castle in the Air 19 .
I know what it is , <NAME> !
Five and thirty ? ’ Mrs. <NAME> laughed outright .
I sprinkled water on her face .
( <NAME> ’ s theatrical name was <NAME> . )
‘ And you ’ re blue , you know , ’ said Mr Feeder .
The little party was laid along with the other party .
<NAME> likewise to prepare for her reception and tuition there .
W-i-n , win , d-e-r , der , winder , a casement .
They had turned a point from which a long stretch of river was visible .
‘ I said I was hurt .
I shall see my dear love , with the dark cloud cleared away .
Nor in the waistcoat , Mr <NAME> , nor in the coat tails .
If you keep it to yourself , I shall keep it to _my_self .
He <NAME> ’ T come forward and explain himself .
The <NAME> girls ’ -- and so forth .
She had seen the murder done .
This was small consolation , but <NAME> wouldn ’ t encourage fallacious hopes .
And he devised a means .
‘ Is that far , sir ? ’ I diffidently asked .
Now , with regard to the party to be apprehended . ''
‘ Just so , ’ replied <NAME> , putting it down .
There were some fifteen or twenty persons in the room .
It was what he had meant to say .
If I thought it , I should never be happy again .
( Raising his eyebrows in very great surprise . )
`` Nothing more , <NAME> ; nothing more . ''
I told you that time past was at an end between us .
<NAME> had gone home , then ?
Did I always say I loved her , and doated on her ?
His niece looked just the same .
‘ Does as he is told by his principal !
‘ He don ’ t send me here for this .
The letters , too , bespeak the character of the man .
You are such a favourite of his , <NAME> . ''
Her soul is turbulent within her ; she is sick at heart and restless .
said my guardian , stopping short and looking at us hopefully .
Quite , now , ’ replied <NAME> .
We ’ ll go over ‘ em one after another .
There is no reason ; it would be absurd .
‘ Let us not bear hard upon the weaknesses of the deceased .
He had not deserved it either .
Thus , vacation succeeded term , and term succeeded vacation .
She had been ill , probably for a long time .
It was in vain that I asked her for her family name .
The heat was a short one .
I am a woman , I. I know nothing of philosophical philanthropy .
She answered with her comforting smile , and the three walked on together .
My memory is circumstantial and unshaken .
You ’ ll go a kidnapping of boys , will you ?
There are no secrets between us , I think .
All women like finery -- extraordinary the effect of those parasols .
<NAME> composed and reassured her .
I would , sir -- every man .
Everybody was thirsty , and the <NAME> was drinking .
`` I am almost ashamed to tell you , but I will .
‘ Yes , sir , ’ replied the little old gentleman .
<NAME> says you are a wonder , ’ I returned .
`` It 's got to a head now and is going to burst ! ''
He sees some object that ’ s in his way of business , floating .
a new life , a new life !
The broad sky seemed on fire .
The child complied , and gazed down into the pit .
`` It 's a judgment on him . ''
( Do we not remark this in moon likewise ?
Whoever was below had stopped on seeing my lamp , for all was quiet .
The drags were called for .
I have mentioned to her that it is better not to wonder .
<NAME> Leicester very lofty indeed .
‘ What will you drink ? ’ demanded the man .
<NAME> <NAME> , what is this ! ''
‘ <NAME> , then , ’ urged Mr Riderhood ; ‘ there !
But <NAME> made no reply .
A cry for the life-buoy passed from mouth to mouth .
On Sundays , she went to church elaborated .
The room was clean and neat .
But he raised them speedily , on hearing his own name .
And <NAME> bursts into tears .
‘ Well , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , mournfully admiring him .
‘ You know how different I am .
In a very short time , the horn was heard .
They were all delighted with my residence .
Let the gentleman come in , ’ said <NAME> .
“ And how much have you got ? ” asked my sister , laughing .
By these conditions I promised to abide .
As when I saw the tender , beautiful regard which <NAME> cast upon her .
He was close behind me when I went downstairs .
But those were slight advantages compared with yours .
<NAME> <NAME> was waiting for us on deck .
And another thing is , we DO make the poor children sniff so .
The ground on which I stand has ceased to be solid under my feet .
How do you defend them ? '
“ <NAME> , everywhere ! ” said madame again .
<NAME> nobody long , ’ cried the wretched figure .
cried <NAME> , curling up his nose .
For , the man lies whole before them .
They hurt me on your account .
‘ Is anything the matter , aunt ? ’ said I , alarmed .
‘ Dombey ! ’ says the Major , ‘ you will guess the rest .
`` Do you dread a particular person ? ''
‘ Stumpy and <NAME> , ’ said the new-comer .
A vote was a vote , and always acceptable .
'Something may come of this before long . '
Whereas them medical doctors ' wives do n't flop -- catch 'em at it !
It was a cold , dry , foggy morning in early spring .
The carriage turned about , and drove on at its former speed .
<NAME> stretched out his hand .
Here was a state of things !
It is the common lot .
“ I repeat this conversation exactly as it occurred .
Mr <NAME> will please enter on his duties immediately. ” ’ ‘ Well !
I knew it from the first .
But I felt she was a little impracticable .
'Fagin , ' cried the girl , recoiling .
We are positively corrupting people .
That was the most remarkable trait in his demeanour .
Think how young he is too !
You had been dying ; trembling between earth and heaven .
The old lady and <NAME> looked on as usual .
Respecting your inheritance , I think you know all .
The man pointed it out , or he would not have seen it .
<NAME> Blimber escorted <NAME> .
He threw himself upon the road -- on his back upon the road .
The <NAME> find with swift remorse that they have omitted to invite <NAME> .
‘ Is it , indeed , <NAME> ? ’ said <NAME> , condescendingly .
And hallo you ! ” said <NAME> , more hoarsely than before .
‘ She has gone into my room .
‘ I am glad you think so .
When I ask that , refuse .
Both very respectable , she added .
You may well sigh , Mrs .
‘ Then dean ’ t shut it at all , ’ retorted <NAME> .
Then , <NAME> had to look about her , for a new investment .
We shall have <NAME> down here presently , I suppose .
It would be a great deal better for us . ''
You knew nothing about her , you didn ’ t .
‘ You are come again , <NAME> ! ’ she said , faltering .
<NAME> on the <NAME> marshes , fog on the <NAME> heights .
But he was not alone .
'It 's nothing , ' said the girl , throwing herself into a chair .
I must say I was relieved by his departure .
‘ And what ’ s the news ? ’ said <NAME> .
There was likewise a hat just now .
Up to this point he has been extremely cheerful .
What new power can I acquire ? '
‘ Did we not leave her , but just now ? ’ ‘ True .
I almost felt as if I had .
I am glad to see you all .
The dogs whose names an ’ t called , keep quiet .
‘ She earns her own living entirely .
<NAME> ’ t say anything about the trouble .
<NAME> , ship-shape , all a taunto , as <NAME> used to say .
‘ Ye ’ d betther inquire , mun , ’ said <NAME> .
I have this unhappy book still !
‘ Nevertheless , we ’ ll drink him , ’ pursued <NAME> .
they have already , ’ <NAME> interposed .
Thus , we came to the village .
What did he call me , with my husband standing by ?
When it was made , you were another man . ''
‘ No speciality ? ’ said Mr Dorrit .
He could sing 'em a good song .
Politics are much discussed , so are banks , so is cotton .
`` But I know she is very beautiful this morning . ''
'Well , what DO you know of him ? '
‘ <NAME> ’ t hit <NAME> because you see I ’ m down .
' A glim , <NAME> , a glim !
Nor did his benevolence stop here .
High friends , free admission to great houses , and access to elegant ladies !
<NAME> is a part of my character .
And you will give him my remembrance and my sympathy ?
When should I ever tire of her !
At any other time , <NAME> would have replied in the affirmative .
<NAME> , it 's a fine thing for the trade !
‘ Your health , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> , clang , hammer ; ding , dong , bell .
This was very uncomfortable , and I was half afraid .
You had better be prepared in time , I can tell you .
‘ Let me look at him , ’ returned <NAME> , coolly .
I have no acquaintance with Mr Lightwood , and I desire none .
After that we are sure to meet again before very long .
`` Very difficult to say , '' returns the lawyer , shaking his head .
Bless their hearts ! ’ in a most vivacious manner .
<NAME> to these are the suggestively-befriended beggars .
I could not make out what that was .
I am going out for a ride in the saddle .
‘ Lord bless my life ! ’ exclaimed Mrs. Nickleby .
His object drifts up , before he is quite ready for it .
A friend of mine menthioned him to me at one time .
<NAME> <NAME> shook his head .
Do her friends know my story also ?
<NAME> looked fearfully round -- nothing was to be seen .
I -- I -- I ’ m afraid you must have got very wet .
‘ Good ! ’ said the old woman .
`` Well , that 's true , '' he returned .
`` Goes out pretty well every day , do n't she ? ''
Now , <NAME> kept a journeyman at weekly wages whose name was <NAME> .
Again , <NAME> bless you in them !
The morning was wearing away ; he grew desperate .
`` Drink it , <NAME> , it 'll do you good .
While yet a victim to the thraldom of <NAME> , I adored <NAME> .
‘ Two or three veeks , ’ replied the man .
`` I know so little , '' said I .
`` I thank you , miss , '' said he .
He handed in the names of two witnesses ; Theophile Gabelle , and <NAME> .
You ? ” “ Are you not ? ” was the fierce retort .
<NAME> <NAME> , outwardly quite undisturbed , demands , `` Why not ? ''
‘ My old fag ! ’ said <NAME> .
‘ What you wanted ! ’ said <NAME> .
But it ca n't last for ever .
<NAME> <NAME> has been to and fro here , as was arranged .
I 'll put a case to you .
) ; and particularly requested me to bring his card for Mr Gowan .
Upon which the dog became mute .
'What dreadful things are these ! '
‘ Come this way , my lad , ’ said the <NAME> .
`` Have I the pleasure of addressing <NAME> , or Mr .
I am removed from you and your family by being a working girl .
<NAME> drew a card from his pocket , and threw it before him .
It was plain that she was thenceforth his guide and leader .
<NAME> to that ! ’ From <NAME> .
`` Yes , my dear , '' returned <NAME> .
The bath was a great comfort .
`` Having said this , have you anything else to say , mademoiselle ? ''
You know how much he makes of your family .
‘ She is dead. ’ There was no need to tell me so .
Beside her is a canvas bag , or bundle , she has carried .
say he will be spared . ''
‘ I believe you , old lady ! ’ returned the <NAME> .
She treated me as a boy still , but she lured me on .
`` And yet I thought so at the time ! ''
`` I was not going to contradict , <NAME> , '' returned <NAME> .
‘ Quite enough , ’ said <NAME> , carelessly , and averting his face .
<NAME> is very graceful , quick , and clever .
cried <NAME> , going to him and embracing him affectionately .
What could I do but follow him ?
‘ There I agree with you .
Would we not , little woman ? ''
He never understood , or seemed to care to understand , about his brother .
‘ The night of her bespeak .
The mighty cocked hat was replaced by a modest round one .
cried the <NAME> , wringing its hands again .
Nicholas waited to the last to give his little presents .
'He 's not charged at all , your worship , ' replied the officer .
But you talk as if you had been nursing her .
`` It never can be forgotten . ''
‘ I can ’ t think who puts these things in .
“ I ’ ll get to him before the morning , ” he said .
You 're a head of swine ! ''
! ’ <NAME> rose , red and disconcerted .
‘ Where ’ s Mrs <NAME> ? ’ exclaimed <NAME> , looking round .
inquired <NAME> in amazement .
‘ Lighted up , accordin ’ to custom !
What men are safe if this is done ?
`` He a n't come in yet , '' says <NAME> .
before every line , and innumerable <NAME> interspersed .
'This is young <NAME> , whom we were speaking about , ' said <NAME> .
‘ Hand me <NAME> ’ s likewise .
Let me explain my meaning to you .
I had a strong misgiving that his nightly absence was for no good purpose .
<NAME> <NAME> saunters along with it congenially .
I may have wanted more than she was likely to have got .
Now that 's delightful , that 's inspiriting , that 's full of poetry !
All was over in a moment .
Have change of air and scene improved her ?
As you certainly would be , in any contract you should make for yourself .
Him again , dear Mrs Flintwinch , ’ cried the stranger .
But I was startled , and drew back .
<NAME> and the landlord bore their losses with professional fortitude .
I know already , but I want a little confidence from you .
'She 's kept tolerably well under , ai n't she ? '
At all events they shall be tried .
A moment ! ’ She was going away , but I detained her .
He surrounded himself with an atmosphere of respectability , and walked secure in it .
They were in a dark corner , quite out of the track of passengers .
‘ Will your father be long ? ’ he inquired .
I have many faults , but not that .
He could not forget that he had had no part in it .
I am sorry to have forgotten this .
Prepared or unprepared , I wish to hear it all from you .
‘ And a very little one , ’ repeated the lodger .
‘ Let me lead you downstairs , ’ said the ever-gallant <NAME> .
Now , what is it you say ?
‘ Do you know either of us ?
Who are you , that you should be appointed to do it ?
It ’ s all your eye , that is !
But , now , he burst into tears .
The inkwhich war n't MY fault .
It were a'most the only hammering he did , indeed , 'xcepting at myself .
One of them is a <NAME> .
'Wot department has he got , <NAME> ? '
He addresses the assembled company in the following terms .
But how comes <NAME> to trip in there ?
The sympathetic hand did not claim her resentment .
The key was put in the lock , and turned .
Say he became a resident turnkey .
this is a kind good face ! ’ said <NAME> .
Two to me , ’ repeated <NAME> , breathing hard over his cards .
sneezed , did you ? ’ retorted <NAME> .
She opens it for him and puts it out for his perusal .
<NAME> was up before four , but had no bonnet on .
He drew them slowly off .
my dear , you are acting beautifully . '
Our and the <NAME> ’ Mutual Friend , my dear .
‘ Is he ill ? ’ inquired Kate , really alarmed .
I noticed that <NAME> looked at her steadily .
<NAME> nodded assent , with _his_ eyes on the fire .
Though <NAME> knows they never did by word or sign .
‘ Here ’ s somebody for you , ’ said the boy .
It so happened , however , that the letter could never be written .
For you can not sarse the goose and not the gander .
B. is willing to give her , <NAME> .
Perhaps the letter speaks for itself , and requires no advice .
`` At six , '' says Mrs. Snagsby .
Here , can ’ t ye len ’ a hond ?
Yes , I was his wife .
Now , to go back , about catching <NAME> .
<NAME> could not read , or rest a moment .
‘ Step this way , my dear ma ’ am .
This was all done in a minute 's space .
‘ Well , my dear , it does you credit .
said the doctor , turning sharply upon <NAME> .
Now I wo n't have it .
So let me see him at once . '
we are moving now , ’ said the old gentleman exultingly .
`` And have the children looked after themselves at all , sir ? ''
That Mrs <NAME> had had daily practical knowledge of his position in society .
I will never come near <NAME> ; never , never !
welfare , the advantage in all points of view , of all concerned !
A smart servant-girl answered the knock , and started on beholding the three strangers .
Foulon who told the starving people they might eat grass !
‘ What ’ s that ? ’ said <NAME> , in sharp accents .
Such a self-contained man I never saw .
‘ Why , indeed ! ’ said <NAME> .
`` The school is not quite deserted , '' said the <NAME> .
‘ Why did he copy my clothes ?
They were now at the last tree in the avenue .
Would n't her child ? ” “ Yes , yes , thank God .
Why did I carry up your things ?
‘ This is my nephew , ’ said my aunt .
I am restless , and shall be better in motion .
She was born here , and lived here many years .
Their father walked on in a hopeful and satisfied frame of mind .
“ And so do I , ” I added , with a scarlet face .
My character was at stake .
That is what it ’ s for .
he cried , shaking it off .
I am not to be found anywhere .
It was never in his way .
I put it in a box .
‘ I am certain of it , ’ said <NAME> , pausing to reflect .
‘ But it ain ’ t weed neither .
‘ I was going to say <NAME> .
`` And what have you been thinking about THEM , my busy bee ? ''
Well , that ’ s right -- that ’ s right .
“ I could n't undertake to say that , of my own knowledge .
The rest get among the spittoons and pipes or lean against the piano .
`` You ha ' n't seen him before .
My friends , of what else have we partaken ?
' A prime plant , ' observed <NAME> .
Then the Judge addressed them .
I think my darling girl is more beautiful than ever .
So I shall not say good-bye , <NAME> .
He stayed to finish what was in his mind .
In the last degree constrained , reserved , diffident , troubled .
<NAME> be so kind as to recollect what a limited power mine is .
“ There is an unconscionable old shark for you ! ” said <NAME> .
Because they have virtually adopted <NAME> , and will provide for her .
The old man ’ s face , and it gets younger .
He was drawn to a debtors ' prison .
Can we ever hope to be respected by our servants ?
I have the means at hand , quiet and close .
Two tumblers , and a custard-cup without a handle .
<NAME> ’ t your own Mr Boffin well acquainted with the Mounds ?
“ You can do him no good .
He wos wery good to me , he wos ! ''
<NAME> ’ t let me be seen for the world .
With this in his hand , he returned to his chair .
A fine firm fellow , with a will of your own .
I ’ m one of the first sort .
‘ So he is , to be sure , ’ rejoined Squeers .
<NAME> ; I never see a joke , ’ <NAME> frowningly retorted .
What a liar you were !
said <NAME> , turning to <NAME> .
I did all I could. -- Come , let us walk about .
You won ’ t forget , sir ? ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> is never seen in <NAME> 's Court now .
‘ And you , <NAME> , ’ I said , by and by .
Who fired a gun or pistol ?
<NAME> ! ” “ Thinking is easy enough , ” said the grave lady .
`` Oh , I am not unhappy , cousin <NAME> ! ''
<NAME> is past hope , if such a miracle has happened . ''
The master and the pupil walked on , rapidly and silently .
`` Yes , I have heard of him , '' said <NAME> .
Could they have been waylaid and robbed ?
oh , dear , true , faithful Di , how did you come here ?
An occasion of feasting and festival .
She gave him one glassy kiss , and four stiff fingers muffled in worsted .
On <NAME> ’ s return , man still argues point , but ultimately goes .
I must do what I am told .
‘ <NAME> ! ’ he thinks , next moment .
I would have him die a harassing and lingering death .
I find that I can not learn .
The cold was very severe .
If no , why ? ’ ‘ Take yes , first .
‘ You have been to see me ? ’ said <NAME> .
But then I often think I know you as you really are . ''
`` A man of a very ill-regulated mind , '' observes <NAME> with severity .
Tears stand in Mrs Veneering ’ s affectionate eyes .
I should wish to speak to you first . ''
He never came there , I reminded him .
What ’ s come of all the boys ?
‘ I was going to show you how madly I love you .
`` That 's one , '' says <NAME> .
`` I did mean you , child , '' replied her mistress calmly .
But he had no part in its sorrowful expression .
‘ I have seen him here .
`` You have brought the sergeant , I see .
‘ <NAME> saw them ! ’ interposed <NAME> .
Which makes four on you .
They looked very closely at one another .
But he was sick and weary ; and he soon fell sound asleep .
My flower ! ’ she pleasantly began , shaking her large head at him .
Thank your brother for what follows .
says my Lady after a long time .
<NAME> ! ’ ‘ I should go away , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
She was in the act of doing so , when <NAME> observed her .
‘ It is early , <NAME> , ’ she said .
You know how sorry we should be .
`` I beg your pardon , <NAME> .
This was a frightful beginning .
<NAME> <NAME> and myself are always present .
<NAME> that white hand of yours , <NAME> .
said <NAME> to the clerk .
<NAME> <NAME> was warmly welcomed by the <NAME> Clubber ; the greeting between Mrs .
'He 's an out-and-out <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
We ought to have patience , all of us .
‘ This is hard to bear .
I believe it was settled you should meet me ?
<NAME> to breathe but streets , streets , streets .
‘ In one thing I was deceived with all my cunning .
‘ Yes , I do , sir , ’ replied <NAME> .
`` My dear <NAME> , '' said <NAME> .
He was not long in doubt .
At length he said , ‘ I know , <NAME> !
And yet he is here now , <NAME> moodily reminds him .
`` When it 's ready , my dear , '' he replied .
But now she stood still .
`` Somewheres , '' repeated the boy in a louder tone .
‘ Can I live to be mistrusted ? ’ cried her husband .
On each tier , are two opposite rows of small iron doors .
I will , at last , if I die for it .
Then it ’ s not convenient to-night ? ’ ‘ No .
`` <NAME> will be married but once , probably . ''
`` I dust n't name him , '' says Jo .
‘ Where ’ s the good ? ’ retorted the forlorn sage .
That was the first ungrateful thought I had .
They said he would not be out long .
‘ I am very happy to hear it .
'Be calm , my dear ma'am , pray . '
‘ Because the memory of those who lie below , passes away so soon .
You can ’ t deprive me of the lead .
‘ Do you think so ? ’ returned <NAME> .
Never , if <NAME> knew his own sufferings , insults , and wrongs !
What can you get in the country but new-laid eggs and flowers ?
<NAME> laughed heartily , and I laughed too .
<NAME> nothing to any one of what passes between us . ''
<NAME> only dropped her head and pressed me closer to her heart .
I am one of two brothers .
We ’ ll look into this presently .
He was their leader , and he felt it .
Also your own sake ; and for mine .
‘ N-no , ’ replied <NAME> , faintly , under the sympathetic coincidence .
It is an errand of mercy that brings me here .
`` <NAME> , I am desirous -- but you are engaged . ''
All was quiet , and assuredly no other man was in those chambers .
`` I am very seldom out , '' pants <NAME> .
She had seen <NAME> , she told me while she was toasting .
They let the paupers go to sleep !
quoth <NAME> on his return .
`` Is <NAME> to bring it ? ''
The hand was smoothing his shaggy moustache .
I know weel , aw what ’ s afore me .
‘ Put the horse in the gig !
<NAME> , my God , oh yes ! ''
Accordingly , they both glance at it consciously , but say nothing .
‘ He is gone , ’ said <NAME> .
Remember that , and charge their doings on themselves , not us . ''
‘ I ’ d sooner scream to <NAME> than say another word !
Then Mrs. <NAME> said , Now about the dinner .
Let me say a little more !
I took a candle and went softly in to fetch it from its shelf .
And HE did what they all do -- made her wretched .
‘ Perhaps you _looked _at me , sir ? ’ ‘ Oh , no !
It took the form of a threat .
‘ I am afraid , dear , I was too young .
End of the <NAME> EBook of A Christmas Carol , by <NAME>
I shouldn ’ t care so much if it wasn ’ t so ridiculous .
<NAME> short in his leaps and bad in his tumbling , ’ <NAME> interpreted .
He was coming round a narrow corner .
How does your honourable worship do ? ''
And they shook hands heartily .
We appeared to retrace the way we had come .
<NAME> here , old <NAME> , here 's a chance !
‘ “ Disband them , love , ” murmured the baroness .
There are no fish of the shark tribe in the <NAME> waters ?
‘ <NAME> ’ t I what ? ’ said the gentleman behind .
‘ I can not indeed , ’ replied gentleman , smiling in his turn .
My darling child and you -- I know !
‘ My daughter will remain present , ’ said Mr Dombey .
‘ Fact , my dear Sir , fact .
We went into the town , and took our burden to the inn .
Half-a-dozen have gone by within as many minutes .
`` There you are , you see !
`` I hope I was not the trouble , guardian ? ''
He was brought up by hand .
She 's alive and must be brought here straight ! ''
`` Yes , yes , '' says <NAME> .
No one ever said I was before .
I fancied it possible -- but let us go ring fancy ’ s knell .
<NAME> <NAME> screws his mouth into a silent `` No ! ''
I always was a pepperer .
‘ He was took ill here , ma ’ am , and -- ugh !
There is another spy commissioned for our quarter .
No one but themselves ever did know , I believe .
The first side is , sheer Insolence .
What , if I am steeped in poverty ?
Of these pictorial acquisitions Mr <NAME> spoke in the usual manner .
It ’ s the nine oils. ’ ‘ The what ? ’ cried <NAME> .
It 'll keep the swelling down . '
It must be near his time . ''
I was shown into a room upstairs , where <NAME> and <NAME> were .
he said , rubbing his head and walking about with his good-humoured vexation .
“ Was he a spy ? ” asked <NAME> .
A merry <NAME> and a happy new year !
‘ Fine morning ! ’ ‘ Beautiful morning , sir , ’ said I .
At last she came here , apprenticed for three years .
money from the first , and to the last .
Tell me , how does this relapse come about ?
‘ Now pray , <NAME> , be careful another time .
‘ In it and out of it too , ’ replied the actor .
And serve yer right for being a fool . '
‘ Yes , ’ said the child from within .
A Letter from <NAME> Dorrit 12 .
Will you do me that favour ? ''
`` Why , I said about ten . ''
The instant he entered the room , it was plain that all was lost .
‘ This here is the dockyment , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
Taking it in his hand , he read these entries .
It is his character to triumph !
Who are always so natural and unconstrained with us !
“ Is he there ? ” said <NAME> .
‘ O my dear <NAME> ! ’ said <NAME> .
Now we lift our eyes up and look hopefully at the distance !
Such as it is , it is likely to remain .
‘ <NAME> ’ t be rash , my love , ’ urged <NAME> .
A military man , my dear .
I should like to be serviceable to you , if you will let me .
Mrs <NAME> had scarcely come out , when <NAME> came out .
‘ And don ’ t you yet believe me ?
<NAME> , my dear , a vain threat !
I allude to -- in short , <NAME> .
<NAME> never heard of such a thing .
Deeming this a good opportunity , he put in his word .
‘ <NAME> , ’ said the young lady .
`` Perhaps the dead know better , if they could only tell us .
<NAME> , go and play at <NAME> under the piano ! ''
Then he limped on again , toiling and muttering .
<NAME> pitch-forked into the <NAME> , but has not circumnavigated .
Sometimes , angry spirits attacked the <NAME> Office .
Ever since I was not so high as your stick .
<NAME> to say he knowed nothing of you ? ” “ Not a ha'porth .
No father , no mother , no friends .
I know that very well .
His daughter was dressed for Mrs Merdle ’ s dinner before he appeared .
He had indeed been thinking about it a good deal .
It was very small , very dark , very ugly , very incommodious .
says <NAME> , giving him his hand .
It was very kind of you .
“ <NAME> me when I ask you , not now .
It ’ s no use talking to me about Mr Merdle .
I know the name , too .
She knows nothing about any relative whatever .
But I can answer in words .
‘ Who talked about favourites ? ’ ‘ He did , ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> twice before you come here again . ''
‘ I have already told you .
<NAME> started to his eyes .
Two good names would be sufficient for my friend in the city .
The whole of that family are the most solemnly conceited and consummate blockheads !
‘ Let us try the effect of smoking .
If you accept my service , you will not repent it .
Oh , what shall I do without her ! '
There is nothing I expect less .
'Ah , that it is n't indeed , <NAME> , ' rejoined the lady .
“ I 'm much of your opinion , boy , ” said he .
How exceedingly miserable I was , that night !
‘ I am glad you have come at last , <NAME> .
Most of all , of late , when she believed he was most tried .
And why not in his favour , as well as in another ’ s ?
‘ All allowance , ’ he continued , ‘ must be made .
'Stole what , for <NAME> 's sake ? '
'You will leave me them ?
They do n't seem to lie in that direction .
It is the only possession I have not relinquished .
‘ It looks like a grave itself , ’ said the old man .
`` What are you stopping here for ? ''
`` No , miss , I never will .
I rather think you may , if you begin early in life .
My jewels are all in their proper places of keeping .
Is it a job , or a boy at marbles ?
We must talk about it ! ''
I am a straightforward man , I believe .
‘ Pray take no further trouble to explain yourself .
‘ You have a physician , ’ said <NAME> .
'Whose turn would that have served , my dear ? '
<NAME> Leicester gives a nod , approving and confirmatory .
<NAME> was teaching , of course .
‘ That ’ s enough , ’ her father interposed .
‘ I ’ m sorry you stopped , sir .
So I said , `` Come in ! ''
The <NAME> was immovable as ever .
Mr <NAME> , sir , have the goodness to run and fetch a constable .
It is the third morning .
`` Can you say it here ? ''
If I owed you money , that was not your fault .
She immediately began to work out the hint .
There are two <NAME> , father and son .
<NAME> and his wife looked steadfastly at one another .
I write to the fellow , 'Mr .
‘ I am for the plaintiff , my Lord , ’ said <NAME> .
But I do n't know nothink ! ''
<NAME> sees that this is not a sham .
And only lying there for a day -- for one day !
Oh , very unwell indeed , '' she said confidentially .
`` Of course , for the best .
He was older now ; a man in the prime of life .
If I am a short-tongued fellow , it may amount to the same thing .
'Come ; you let me out ! '
I must have been ordered abroad , but how could I have gone ?
She was , however , unaccountably improved in her appearance and looked very pretty .
Sometimes <NAME> only was asked .
Two fifty would be bad enough , but better than that .
‘ Come in , come in ! ’ said a gracious voice .
He was twice her age .
'Oh , <NAME> , ' cried <NAME> , reproachfully .
It was a genteel old-fashioned house , very quiet and orderly .
My young friends are pressed for time .
Let us go by the quiet backways .
And there Mrs. Snagsby is seized with an inspiration .
<NAME> and I were very uncomfortable .
I only mean that you should think of me that way .
'Well , that I do , sir , ' replied the old lady .
I don ’ t deserve it. ’ Good childish creature !
There is none at hand , but a tavern does as well or better .
Now , I appeal to the T ’ other Governor .
They took a multitude of titles .
He addresses this to the astounded Tony , who admits the soft impeachment .
B. is not the man for your purpose .
Presently , it stopped , and had come to its destination .
<NAME> , give the person twopence .
Now give me the sleeve -- not that sleeve , the other one .
“ Here is wine , ” said <NAME> .
It is a lady , I presume ?
murmured <NAME> in a gentle voice ; 'Nolly ? '
I wish you good night all !
‘ Why , of course , my precious , till papa comes back !
But the fire of the sun is dying .
Pay out a word or two respecting them adwenturs , will you !
It was another form of knell , with mockery added to the warning .
cried old Fezziwig , skipping down from the high desk , with wonderful agility .
I know what I say too well .
' I -- I -- do n't know , sir , ' replied <NAME> .
The captain we know of .
`` I dust n't , or I would . ''
‘ Mr Clennam ? ’ said Mr Barnacle .
I am so sorry for it .
For you , and for any dear to you , I would do anything .
My love and joy were dumb .
‘ Governor in ? ’ inquired <NAME> , in reply to the question .
‘ Why not , <NAME> ? ’ returned <NAME> .
Mr Aaron on that side ; I on this .
'He need be , for he eats enough , ' observed the lady .
But they did n't come to me .
She fully understands , dear Dombey .
`` I think , guardian , I might have supposed so .
“ It ought to have been finished long ago .
‘ Once a gentleman , and always a gentleman .
You ain ’ t out yet , you know .
“ <NAME> and friends , we are ready !
Now , I ’ m a going to tell the story .
‘ Three or four weeks ! ’ muttered the father .
'Is the downstairs door fast ? '
Is it true that you were seen there ? ’ ‘ Where ?
Why , thank you , <NAME> , I am very well ! ''
`` And do you know how pretty you are , child ? ''
`` Lay it on the table , <NAME> , '' said I .
What message should she take upstairs ?
‘ “ No , no , ” returned the widow hastily .
He is as quiet now as if he were of marble .
‘ Have you breakfasted this morning , <NAME> ? ’ said the Doctor .
Almost looks as if she was <NAME> .
`` This is where he lives , is it ? ''
‘ Have you parted with them , Mr Boffin ? ’ asked <NAME> .
‘ You wouldn ’ t ask , sir , if you knew his state .
Do you see what they are ?
It was very unfortunate for <NAME> , I said .
“ Down with him ! ” The lady gave a loud scream .
‘ Anything new ? ’ ‘ No , nothing particular .
Let us change it , if you please .
That he leaves to abler and to purer hands .
‘ <NAME> long miles , ’ repeated the landlord .
‘ Eighteen-pence would do it , ’ said <NAME> .
I see by my young friends .
The lady as has taken the lodgings ! ’ ejaculated Mrs. Cluppins .
“ We 'll drink her health , ” said I .
wery good , ’ replied <NAME> , after a little reflection .
You 've been a stealing 'em , have you ?
‘ To cancel your articles , <NAME> ?
A hackney-coach was called , and the father and daughter departed in it .
said <NAME> , looking up in a surly manner .
‘ Good-night , ma ’ am , ’ rejoined <NAME> .
There are the beggars of punctual business-habits too .
Even the long drawing-room of <NAME> can not revive <NAME> 's spirits .
( <NAME> ’ s divisions being for emphasis . )
Over the piano , Mrs. <NAME> when Mrs. Swosser .
Think once more ! ’ ‘ I won ’ t !
“ Yes ? ” said the <NAME> , with evident constraint .
‘ God bless you , <NAME> ; dearest <NAME> !
‘ I have looked into it .
And we had a feast .
<NAME> <NAME> is as imperturbable as the hearthstone to which he has quietly walked .
`` Did he owe you any rent ? ''
Who were those with whom I played ?
`` Very well , my dear , '' said I .
said <NAME> , hurriedly drinking off a glass of wine .
We are safe here , at last , eh ?
What business had he to be married to the <NAME> ! ''
‘ What is this ? ’ said <NAME> .
My hair is matted together .
<NAME> trembled more and more .
said <NAME> ; and walked across the room .
It is a young lady 's walking-shoe .
We asked if that were a friend of <NAME> 's .
Take that fellow ’ s staff away .
`` Really , <NAME> , I can not make you a definite reply .
There he is still , eagerly pointing , and no one minds him .
The doctor came in too , to see how it fared with <NAME> .
It lasted about five days .
Now , I am regularly paid for them .
He is a plain old soldier is <NAME> .
This young lady was far above <NAME> .
I know that very well .
<NAME> and I agreed that we could do nothing else but be very cautious .
Yes , it ’ s as plain as the marks upon the cards .
‘ If you don ’ t know , how can I know ?
The gulf between me and <NAME> widens .
he is greatly better , <NAME> , ’ returned the Apothecary .
It 's a west wind , little woman , due west !
I found it out at last though .
‘ “ It is , ” said the client .
Here it is. ” He handed it to his principal instead of to me .
That lady was a <NAME> , your ladyship . ''
You triumph , my little boy ; but it is your character to triumph .
O mother of <NAME> , this Foulon !
His <NAME> name was <NAME> .
However , I waive even that question .
‘ Do you remain here , <NAME> ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
( He is nettled by having his composition so mechanically received . )
`` You have brought our good friend the sergeant , I see . ''
If I was you , I wouldn ’ t either .
I applaud him for it .
‘ Take yourself off , sir. ’ ‘ Pooh !
Here he is to-day , quiet at his table .
Do you hear ? ’ ‘ Yes , yes , ’ rejoined <NAME> .
Never , on any pretence , mind !
`` Can you give a fellow anything to read in the meantime ? ''
‘ Nothing ’ s the matter , my dear , ’ returned her visitor .
'How dare you mention such a thing , sir ?
The whole house is disgraceful .
It was— ’ <NAME> turned upon her pillow , and heard no more .
`` How do you do , Mrs. Rouncewell ?
But I couldn ’ t take anything from you , my dear .
So , too , with the wicked relief she has felt in his death .
‘ But he won ’ t come ! ’ roared <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> ’ t be took aback , pretty creetur !
It evidently made him nervous .
Where was the man , and why did he not come back ?
‘ She ’ ll have no time to idle over fooleries after tomorrow .
Expect to get anything by this evidence ?
`` He knows Mrs. Jellyby , '' said <NAME> .
If I pay for a sheep , I buy it out and out .
Not a moment to lose .
He has only me to help him .
The sun shone <NAME> , and the birds sang <NAME> .
I consider it a departure from our agreement and your promise .
`` I do n't know as I do , sir , '' replies Jo .
I hoped in return that <NAME> was quite well .
<NAME> and <NAME> was the curtain of <NAME> 's cradle . ''
I know you will choose the best .
‘ The schoolmaster. ’ ‘ To be sure .
It seemed to be ; he returned the look , and evidently understood it .
I was not thinking of that .
Says I now , I ’ m attending to ye .
`` You have heard the boy .
But shall I tell you who this young lady is ?
<NAME> resources of her own , ’ said <NAME> , smoking quietly .
They fished with a spade , at first .
You were a widow in anticipation .
Come back with the man , and I 'll give you a shilling .
And they are all gone but this one !
<NAME> beckoned her not to retire , and <NAME> took a seat in silence .
All the while , <NAME> 's official cat watches the mouse 's hole .
We must rise from little winnings to great .
A knock at the door , and a ring at the bell .
<NAME> <NAME> to <NAME> in a <NAME> .
S. ! ’ said <NAME> , after some consideration .
<NAME> <NAME> ’ s hands and eyes expressed how much .
<NAME> <NAME> admitted the fact .
She could not concur , but she was silent .
It is impossible that it can be accidental !
So I drank it ; and it did me good ! '
that 's right , ' added the Dodger .
In a little while , it will weigh lighter than any feather .
Well , then , wos that young lady up at the house now ?
What you want is a good investment and a quick return .
What ’ s he doing , <NAME> ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
‘ Well , <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> .
Perhaps from mice , to which she had a great objection .
I heard the tread of footsteps on the stairs .
There is no constraint upon you , I hope .
`` Without their knowledge at home ? ''
I know he has , ’ said the boy .
Let my sister <NAME> and myself have our society .
It asked me , would I be the mistress of <NAME> .
I left <NAME> upon the morrow afternoon .
I can ’ t allow people in my way .
said the man , with one foot on the stairs .
'Of what use , then , is the communication you have made ? '
‘ I should think it was , ma ’ am , ’ I rejoined .
`` What is to be done with him ? ''
`` <NAME> '' is all the information the card yields .
I have been in torments ever since I stopped short of it before .
‘ No , <NAME> , you must excuse me .
( Musingly , as each gazes down the street . )
It was sticking out of him in all directions .
You may trust me so far . ''
Those circumstances it is not necessary to offer in argument .
‘ Not that it matters now .
It ’ s one of the drawbacks of our line of business .
My circumstances are quite easy , and you would want for nothing .
Have you no feeling for your profession , you groveller ?
'Will she go with me ? '
Now , had his brother <NAME> that peculiar union of qualities ?
<NAME> to see you up so early .
The only exception I made was Mrs. Woodcourt .
Hold up , <NAME> , hold up , sir ! ''
She has been burning 'em , sir !
Upon my soul , I 'm hungry . ''
The cause was Mr Pancks .
Oh , what a loving and devoted face I saw !
I ’ m rather cast down myself .
The stranger was <NAME> .
‘ This is business , and transports interfere with it .
Mr Alfred <NAME> came round to the <NAME> to breakfast with <NAME> .
<NAME> came of the cross-cut .
‘ “ I am her guardian , <NAME> , ” said the old gentleman .
‘ Very good indeed , ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> Clarissa never moved her arms .
exclaimed <NAME> ; 'who has dared to -- ?
It was an impressive tableau .
<NAME> cross to me if I deserve it .
I was thus enabled to fly from the <NAME> immediately after breakfast .
‘ It ’ s a pudding , ’ I made answer .
