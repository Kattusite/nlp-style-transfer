The travellers , vertically over the <NAME> 's south pole , were , as <NAME> soon ascertained , about 30 miles distant from it , the exact distance they had been from the north pole -- a proof that the elliptic curve still maintained itself with mathematical rigor .
Let 's see : in these seas , what do we generally meet with ?
They , however , readily understood one another .
The northern part of <NAME> was at its base composed solely of two valleys , wide , not very deep , without any appearance of vegetation , strewn with masses of rock , paved with lava , and varied with great blocks of mineral .

The blackened traces of explosion were to be seen , the waters having subsided below the level of these mysterious operations Thus the fall of a portion of the vast vaulted dome was proved to have been premeditated by man , and by man ' s hand had it been effected .

On the 31st of October , at ten o'clock in the morning , the troop disembarked on the quays of <NAME> ; and one may imagine the activity which pervaded that little town , whose population was thus doubled in a single day .

This time it is no fight of animals ; it is the fearful battle of the elements .
While he and his companions were in pursuit of the convicts , the latter might very probably pay another visit to the plateau , and it would be useless to give them an opportunity of recommencing their work of destruction .

For some minutes great masses rolled over the surface of the sea , then a breeze sprang up , which rapidly dispelled the mist .

I replied , looking fixedly at <NAME> , whose meaning was easy to guess .
Procure us some iron for the barrels , steel for the hammers , saltpeter .
The two dogs intended to accompany them had been already deposited in the Projectile .
The king 's reply not being sent within the time specified by the admiral , the latter set sail and anchored at the distance of sixteen miles from <NAME> .
Happily these precautions did not deprive , the vessel of any of its speed , for the wind could only reach the upper sails , and these sufficed to carry her forward rapidly .

The length of day reduced one half !
His energy and courage increased in sight of danger .
below zero ; every outward part of the <NAME> was covered with ice .
That was to be its last resting-place , its last halt , after its voyage of eight hundred leagues on the great <NAME> artery .
" My dear fellow , we are now upon the very track of <NAME> .
It was now about to penetrate to less-known realms .
There are millions of men to day as curious as I am upon the subject .
How he laboured to recover himself by work !
Its past , present , and future had even given up their last secrets .
<NAME> , which suddenly went out , sometimes appeared along the face of the rock or on the embankment of the further galleries .
The colonists could easily go fore and aft , after having removed the cases as they were extricated .
Indeed I declare ( though it may seem improbable ) if I sought to destroy all hope -- if I wished to despair , I could not .
There he found the <NAME> and the <NAME> ; the former of whom sold him a silver sword-hilt .
The whip whistled in the air .
The operation finished , to the great satisfaction of the operators , the remains of the animal were left to the birds , who would soon make every vestige of it disappear , and their usual daily occupations were resumed by the inmates of <NAME> .
<NAME> severed the head of one from its body with his first shot , and <NAME> broke the wing of another .
<NAME> commanded the <NAME> , and Stanioukowitch the <NAME> .
At any rate , they were eatable from head to foot , and <NAME> did not ask more from them .
From the club it soon got into the papers throughout <NAME> .
It is useless to say that the orang was now thoroughly domesticated at <NAME> , and that he often accompanied his masters to the forest without showing any wish to leave them .
<NAME> and <NAME> could not keep back their tears , and <NAME> had not a word of hope or comfort to give them .

Then , all at once , he plunged into the lake .
<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> , with their daughter and sons , were on the deck of the enormous raft .
At first Captain Servadac thought of going in person with the invitation ; but , remembering <NAME> ' s dislike to visitors , he altered his mind , and sent young Pablo up to the observatory with a formal note , requesting the pleasure of <NAME> ' s company at the <NAME> ' s _fete_ .
And the two oars , plunging into the dark waters , urged the boat onwards .
Whilst the craft was running by its own velocity , the liquid drops struck the dark depths of the waves crisply like spats of melted lead .

There they will tranship passengers and cargoes .
I only make two observations beforehand .
But by communication with the water , whose external pressure it indicates , it gives our depth at the same time . "
The work was bound to be completed at latest by the 15th of October following , and the cannon delivered in good condition under penalty of a forfeit of one hundred dollars a day to the moment when the moon should again present herself under the same conditions -- that is to say , in eighteen years and eleven
" Painful associations , " he says , " met us with every succeeding island .
" So , " he said , " no one knows now where the third vessel perished that was constructed by the castaways on the island of <NAME> ? "
There the vein had failed , between the schist and the tertiary sandstone .
This brought them nearer to the left shore .
Slightly changing her course , she first struck her mainsail , and , in order to facilitate the movements of her helmsman , soon carried nothing but her two topsails , brigantine and jib .
Thereupon the crowd , began to move toward the gangway and make its way on to the quay , while the crew began to cast off the last moorings .
The Projectile was certainly approaching the <NAME> .
And now , what can you expect from the new-born infant ?
It has its tempers and its gentle moods .
It was a favourable change , and the Tankadere again bounded forward on this mountainous sea , though the waves crossed each other , and imparted shocks and counter-shocks which would have crushed a craft less solidly built .
There the huts of the <NAME> , the cottage of the negroes , the store-rooms which held the valuable cargo , would be gradually demolished ; there the principal dwelling , nestled beneath its verdant tapestry of flowers and foliage , and the little chapel whose humble bell was then replying to the sounding clangor from the steeples of
For the <NAME> had designed regular cabins -- huts without walls , with only light poles supporting the roof of foliage .
The windows at <NAME> were soon furnished with panes ; not very white , perhaps , but still sufficiently transparent .
Who could tell what the future might have in reserve ?
But if the two Americans were then present ready to risk their lives in some new adventure , it was not so with <NAME> .
And , carrying the idea a little further , if , instead of an assembly or an audience , we should oxygenize towns , cities , a whole country -- what activity would be infused into the whole people !
After a somewhat long stay in that country , he returned by <NAME> , then the principal entrepôt of the commerce of the east , went as far as <NAME> , at the entrance of the <NAME> , and then again passing up the <NAME> , he arrived at <NAME> .
It is useless to add that notwithstanding the wide extent of sea which the explorers could survey , and though the engineer swept the horizon with his glass , no vessel could be found .
To make still more sure of the cannibalism of the natives , I offered it to one of them .
This time there was a good deal of delay before he was admitted to an audience .
The construction of the vessel was diligently continued , and without offering further explanations the engineer pushed forward the work with all his energy .
But the doctor , who was harassed by his thoughts , wanted to take a last view of the country , and he ascended a little hill about a hundred feet high , whence he had a distant view to the south .
The <NAME> , for <NAME> , had started three-quarters of an hour before !
On this day , however , throwing himself suddenly on Vasling , he managed to snatch a lemon from him which he was about to suck .

<NAME> of <NAME> and separated from <NAME> by a goodly number of ring mountains , lies the little basin of <NAME> , the <NAME> of <NAME> , containing only about 66 thousand square miles , its central point having a latitude of 25° south and a longitude of 40° east .
<NAME> <NAME> ought to have pressed the natives upon this subject .
Carefully laid out in the inside , and little encumbered by instruments and traveling utensils , which each had their particular place , it left the three travelers a certain freedom of movement .
" We shall never get back , " said <NAME> , dejectedly .
They set to work to explore its very bed .

<NAME> <NAME> 's portrait appears to us somewhat too black , and he does not seem to estimate at its true value the great discovery which we owe to <NAME> la Sale ; a discovery , which has nothing like it , we do not say equal to it , except that of the river <NAME> , by <NAME>
At the end of an hour , my uncle , who had been taking careful observations , was enabled to judge of the rapidity with which we moved .
To keep it in perfect working order , the apparatus should be carefully attended to .
Were they still there , or had one of their number just gone out ?
It told me that the <NAME> was floating on the surface of the ocean .
<NAME> , if they had listened to the doctor , there is no knowing what they would not have made of this ice and snow , which can be so easily manipulated !
Apropos of this : " This D'Urville was one of your great sailors , " said the <NAME> to me , " one of your most intelligent navigators .
But let us wait and see what turns up . "
Another bound and he was between the bear and the girl .
Unfortunately , the said companion had drunk the contents of the water jar while <NAME> was unconscious , and when <NAME> felt thirsty , he discovered that there was " not a drop to drink ! "

It was produced by myriads of luminous animalculae , whose brilliancy was increased as they glided over the metallic hull of the vessel .
Not even when the <NAME> crossed the line , and the heat was so great that the seams of the deck were melting .
The next and following days some small islands of no note were discovered , to which were given the names of <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> .
" What ' s happened ? " questioned <NAME> , rifle in hand .
During the month <NAME> ' s advance along its orbit would be reduced to 22,000,000 leagues , the distance from the sun at the end being 172,000,000 leagues , about four and a half times as great as the average distance of the earth from the sun .
Not a shadow , not a gleam , not the slightest vestige could he trace of its existence .
We have already seen that this land had been discovered by <NAME> , and we have noted those incidents which were marked with traces of bloodshed when it was reconnoitred by the <NAME> captain .
Finally the air which ends this magnificent act , beginning , " No more love , no more intoxication , O the remorse that oppresses me ! "
It had not , apparently , been so with the <NAME> , who had not been permitted to land , whilst the sailors on board the <NAME> were at once allowed to fish and hunt , and to go and come as they chose , every facility for obtaining fresh provisions being also accorded to them .
After a brief colloquy he returned and said : " This is his advice , and very sensible it is , I think .
cried the latter , ordering the spectators to leave the deck of the <NAME> .
Evidently , reason is not outraged by an admission of the reality of these facts , although the situations are strained to the utmost limits of possibility ; but that does not surprise us , for the writer is the <NAME> magician-poet , <NAME> .
The <NAME> looked in my face .
All the sailor ' s comrades took their share in this task without murmuring , though the fatigue was augmented by the great heat .
It was more than the sleep of a volcano ; it was its complete extinction .
The snow had hardened , and <NAME> was very confident of being able to transport <NAME> in a few hours to <NAME> .
His writings are of great value ; the narrative of his voyage in <NAME> -- of which he unfortunately could not explore the interior -- is so complete and precise , that owing to it that country was then better known than many in <NAME> .
The car was close at hand .
<NAME> Vasling raised his head and saw <NAME> in the ratlines of the mizen-mast , his gun in his hand .
" I told you that <NAME> 's name was not <NAME> , that it was <NAME> , and that he was <NAME> 's brother ? "
" You are an apt pupil . "
It is <NAME> , the chief officer , that I am talking to at present. " " Mr .
They hastened their steps ; the dogs drew the sledge briskly , <NAME> barked joyously , and they all soon reached the <NAME> ship .
It was then formally agreed that the feast had been eaten in the grand dining-hall of <NAME> 's <NAME> , after being cooked in the kitchen of <NAME> 's <NAME> , and that they would go comfortably to bed in the chamber of <NAME> 's <NAME> .

<NAME> <NAME> felt the volcanic tufa with which the plain was strewn , and which were but pulverised cinders hardened into solid blocks by time , tremble beneath him , but he could discover no traces of fresh lava .
The ground , till then , very little undulated , boggy at first , dry and sandy afterwards , had a gentle slope , which ascended from the shore towards the interior of the country .
" By the highroad ? " " Yes , Nadia. " <NAME> was still the same man who had sworn , whatever happened , to accomplish his object .
The shelter of these trees is , however , unavailing against the vertical rays of the sun , which explains an <NAME> proverb , " Rely upon the favour of the great and the shade of an acacia . "
