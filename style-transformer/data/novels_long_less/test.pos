‘ My darling , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ you wear that pretty black frock in remembrance of your Mama. ’ ‘ I can remember my Mama , ’ returned the child , with tears springing to her eyes , ‘ in any frock. ’ ‘ But people put on black , to remember people when they ’ re gone.
‘ Well , <NAME> , ’ said the other -- ‘ Doctor <NAME> was of the same mind , I believed .
Having descended in safety from the wall , and not forgotten to devote a few moments to his own particular business in the same department , <NAME> then made the best of his way back to the <NAME> , where his prolonged absence had occasioned much speculation and some alarm .
<NAME> and <NAME> has warped him out of himself and perverted me in his eyes .
<NAME> sighed , and shook his head despondingly .
‘ Was he not , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ You know he was not. ’ ‘ He was , ’ cried the woman .
He has been for some time particularly desirous to serve his country in a post of good emoluments , unaccompanied by any trouble or responsibility .
Then , without a scrap of courage , but with a great deal of desperation , I went softly in and stood beside her , touching her with my finger .
So I thought one day when I went to <NAME> to meet <NAME> , at her solicitation , I would ask <NAME> to be in waiting for me at the coach-office , that we might have a little talk together .
And so _he_ goes up the postern stair .
He wore it the last time you ever saw him , and the last time you ever will see him -- in this world. ’ ‘ It ’ s my belief you mean to tell me to my face you killed him ! ’ exclaimed <NAME> ; but , nevertheless , allowing his glass to be filled again .
In the sad moonlight , she clasped him by the neck , and laid her face upon his breast .
<NAME> and <NAME> had often dealt in hides , but never in hearts .
Also , while he still grasped that feature , he directed several thoughtful looks down the street , after the retiring figure of Mr Boffin .
Therefore I take every opportunity of openly stating to a friend of <NAME> how <NAME> is situated .
what have I done to be looked at , like that ? ’ ‘ My lad , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ don ’ t you sing out afore you ’ re hurt .
‘ It is my duty to find out why she made that stipulation .
<NAME> ’ ever , there is law for us women , mis ’ rable creeturs as they ’ d make us , if they could ; and that your master will find out , young man , to his cost , afore he ’ s six months older. ’ At this consolatory reflection , Mrs. <NAME> bridled up , and
He laid open his affairs without the smallest reserve , and descanted at some length upon the merits of his company , and the acquirements of his family ; of both of which , the two broad-sword boys formed an honourable portion .
Wednesday being so close upon us , we determined to go back to <NAME> that night , three in the post-chaise ; the rather , as we should then be clear away before the night 's adventure began to be talked of .
You are travelling for amusement and instruction .
Upon the undertaker 's stating in the <NAME> 's bar in the course of the day that he has received orders to construct `` a six-footer , '' the general solicitude is much relieved , and it is considered that <NAME> 's conduct does him great honour .
In his sullen and unwholesome brooding , the unhappy man , with a dull perception of his alienation from all hearts , and a vague yearning for what he had all his life repelled , made a distorted picture of his rights and wrongs , and justified himself with it against her .
Running on thus , and now holding Oliver from her to mark how he had grown , now clasping him to her and passing her fingers fondly through his hair , the good soul laughed and wept upon his neck by turns .
‘ You are , sir , I perceive , a man of sense and talent , ’ said <NAME> , almost breathless with the vehemence of his patriotic declaration .
‘ If anyone had told me this yesterday , ’ said <NAME> , with majesty , ‘ or even half-an-hour ago , I should have been tempted , I almost believe , to strike them to the earth .
The President will have a gentleman before him soon .
Had he come on board alone ? ” “ No. ” “ How many were with him ? ” “ Two <NAME> gentlemen. ” “ Had they conferred together ? ” “ They had conferred together until the last moment , when it was necessary for the <NAME> gentlemen to be landed in their boat. ” “ Had any papers
He may not have money , but he always has what is much better -- family , my dear . ''
Travellers ’ <NAME> , ’ cross the green. ’ The boy instantly darted off with the shilling , lest <NAME> should repent , but stopped at a safe distance , on the happy chance of his being uneasy in his mind about it , to goad him with a demon dance expressive of its irrevocability .
I can do it without <NAME> , of course , but this is the shortest way . ''
Although I was treated in every other respect like the rest of the school , this single difference was made in my case from the first .
If you have nothing better to do than to walk up town with me , I shall be glad to introduce you to <NAME> ’ s daughter. ’ ‘ Mr .
The house was dark and shabby , and the greasy shoulders that had left their mark in <NAME> 's room seemed to have been shuffling up and down the staircase for years .
The excellent old gentleman being at these times a mere clothes-bag with a black skull-cap on the top of it , does not present a very animated appearance until he has undergone the two operations at the hands of his granddaughter of being shaken up like a great bottle and poked and punched like a great bolster .
Thus he will say , touching his strange sights : ‘ Durdles come upon the old chap , ’ in reference to a buried magnate of ancient time and high degree , ‘ by striking right into the coffin with his pick .
R. W. scratched his head and looked apologetically all round the table until he came to his wife , when observing her as it were shrouded in a more sombre veil than before , he once more hinted , ‘ My dear , I am really afraid you are not altogether enjoying yourself ? ’ To which she once more
'How do you do , sir ?
The reason is all mine , I do not insinuate that it is in any way yours. ’ ‘ Well , sir , ’ she returned , repeating a little less haughtily than before her former invitation to him to be seated : to which he now deferred , as she seated herself .
Who loosed it ? ’ <NAME> , being on his road to the <NAME> , approaches it by way of <NAME> .
The name of <NAME> is the name of the age .
‘ Then who knows but the gentleman , anticipating our objection to play for love , civilly desired to play for money ? ’ The old man replied by shaking the little purse in his eager hand , and then throwing it down upon the table , and gathering up the cards as a miser would clutch at gold .
‘ Yes , yes , yes , yes. ’ ‘ And if , my dear Frederick -- if you could , without putting any great constraint upon yourself , throw a little ( pray excuse me , <NAME> ) , a little polish into your usual demeanour -- ’ ‘ <NAME> , <NAME> , ’ said the other , shaking
I ’ ll write another to-morrow morning .
'Yes , ' said <NAME> , recoiling a few steps , as if to be nearer assistance in case she should require it .
With no greater experience of the world than he had acquired for himself in his short trials ; with a sufficient share of headlong rashness and precipitation ( qualities not altogether unnatural at his time of life ) ; with a very slender stock of money , and a still more scanty stock of friends ; what could he do
I am ashamed that you should have the trouble. ’ He was gone before it came to that ; but soon returned , saying exactly as before , ‘ Here ’ s your black box : ’ which he also put down with care .
So artful , and so ungrateful you have been , <NAME> ; for when did I ever injure you ? ’ ‘ There was also , ’ Mr <NAME> went on , in a meditative manner , ‘ a errand connection , in which I was much respected .
The trooper shakes his head .
Hence she had at last consented to play off against <NAME> a stricken market-gardner known to be ready with his offer on the smallest encouragement , and hence -- as this occasion had been specially assigned for the purpose -- that great anxiety on her part for <NAME> ’ s presence which had occasioned her to leave the note he
Now I lost him , now I saw him , now I lost him , now I was cut at with a whip , now shouted at , now down in the mud , now up again , now running into somebody ’ s arms , now running headlong at a post .
Good-bye ! ’ And so he left her : first observing that she sat down on the corner of a seat , and not only rested her little hand upon the rough wall , but laid her face against it too , as if her head were heavy , and her mind were sad .
I will not lose sight of him again , in a hurry. ’ With these words , <NAME> shook <NAME> ’ s hand once more , and , having done the same by <NAME> , threw himself into an arm-chair , his jolly red face shining again with smiles and health .
I felt very brave at being left alone in the solitary house , the protector of Em ’ ly and Mrs. Gummidge , and only wished that a lion or a serpent , or any ill-disposed monster , would make an attack upon us , that I might destroy him , and cover myself with glory .
`` Are there any more of you besides <NAME> ? ''
When he comes back , he has recovered his composure , except that he contends against an avoidance of the boy , which is so very remarkable that it absorbs the woman 's attention .
Before what ? ’ said <NAME> , putting her hand upon his arm .
<NAME> cares about me now , and it ’ s very nat ’ ral they shouldn ’ t. ’ Here the old lady tossed her head , and smoothed down her lavender-coloured silk dress with trembling hands .
At last he resolved to watch <NAME> and know more of her story .
I ’ ve been looking for you , sir , rather what I may call specially. ’ ‘ You don ’ t say so , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Yes , I do say so , sir .
<NAME> for her father was the first distinct emotion that made head against the flood of sorrow which overwhelmed her .
<NAME> Peggotty suggesting to me , in a whisper , what had already occurred to myself , I took out my purse ; but I could not prevail upon her to accept any money , nor could I exact any promise from her that she would do so at another time .
By this time Mr <NAME> had remarked that he never found the visitor looking at any room , after throwing one quick glance around , but always found the visitor looking at him , Mr Flintwinch .
One disagreeable result of whispering is that it seems to evoke an atmosphere of silence , haunted by the ghosts of sound -- strange cracks and tickings , the rustling of garments that have no substance in them , and the tread of dreadful feet that would leave no mark on the sea-sand or the winter snow .
You are well on your way to the poor wronged gentleman , and , with a fair sea voyage , and a fair land journey , you will be soon at his dear side. ” She repeated in the same tone , sunk to a whisper , “ I have been free , I have been happy , yet his
A little hard-headed , <NAME> pippin-faced man , was conversing with a fat old gentleman in one corner ; and two or three more old gentlemen , and two or three more old ladies , sat bolt upright and motionless on their chairs , staring very hard at <NAME> and his fellow-voyagers .
But the <NAME> had somehow come to the knowledge that <NAME> kept a school .
A shadowy idea of wickedness committed , haunts every individual in the party ; and each one secretly thinks the other a companion in guilt , whom it would be agreeable to avoid .
‘ You ’ ll always find a little bit of soap in the kitchen window ; that belongs to you. ’ <NAME> opened his eyes , but not his mouth ; and <NAME> was again going away , when he once more turned back .
I know this in much the same way , I suppose .
When <NAME> asked him what he thought of the <NAME> , <NAME> said he had thought of that , too , and it was n't a bad idea .
There was an alacrity in his manner , too , which was equally unaccountable ; every time his eyes met those of <NAME> or <NAME> , he smirked and grinned ; once , <NAME> could have sworn , he saw him wink .
I ca n't go into a long explanation before company ; but I could n't help it , upon my honour . '
The very feet of the dog were bloody .
A field-marshal has his uniform ; a bishop his silk apron ; a counsellor his silk gown ; a beadle his cocked hat .
So , the close of every week was a delicious time for me ; and I got through the rest of the week by looking forward to it .
This , at the time I write , has been proved , I believe , to be the case ; but , as it would have been flat blasphemy against the system to have hinted such a doubt then , I looked out for the penitence as diligently as I could .
Sounds of recognition and greeting pass between the <NAME> and somebody else , at the stair-foot .
' I ask one promise , ' said <NAME> .
Rumbling along with most unwonted noise , the caravan stopped at last at the place of exhibition , where <NAME> dismounted amidst an admiring group of children , who evidently supposed her to be an important item of the curiosities , and were fully impressed with the belief that her grandfather was a cunning device in wax .
It was a great point too that <NAME> himself was flattered by the sensation he created , and after several efforts to preserve his gravity , burst into a loud roar , and so stood with his mouth wide open and his eyes nearly shut , laughing violently .
‘ Not if it should happen to have been a tame bull , you little <NAME> ? ’ said <NAME> .
‘ When she finds how much we know , and how we know it , ’ he said , ‘ and that she is clearly compromised already , we are not without strong hopes that we may be enabled through her means to punish the other two effectually .
Night after night does this excellent man -- don ’ t frown , <NAME> ; I _will _say you _are _an excellent man -- come and sit here , for hours together , and it has not the least effect upon him. ’ Well , that is odd , ’ said <NAME> ; ‘ it ‘ ud have a wery
Finally she burst into violent weeping , and , when her sister came and sat close at her side to comfort her , said , ‘ Amy , you ’ re an Angel ! ’ ‘ But , I tell you what , my Pet , ’ said <NAME> , when her sister ’ s gentleness had calmed her ,
Within a few more minutes he is reported as sending his respects , and could my Lady please to receive him for a word or two after her dinner ?
‘ He is only the representative of another ! ’ cried <NAME> .
‘ We call Crummles that , because his style of acting is rather in the heavy and ponderous way , ’ said <NAME> .
So off they set ; the plaintiff and defendant walking arm in arm , the officer in front , and eight stout coachmen bringing up the rear .
But I AM such a nasty little thing ! ’ ‘ My dear ! ’ urged <NAME> again .
That I 'll do , and render an account of course .
If he had been in <NAME> indeed , and the time had been sunset , and the scene a stately terrace !
There was no sleep for <NAME> on that night when <NAME> turned so easily in his bed ; there was no sleep for little Miss Peecher .
What you have said to me could have affected me so much from no other lips , for there are none that could give it such a value to me .
He returned home one evening from an interview with her father , who had mentioned that she was out visiting -- which was what he always said when she was hard at work to buy his supper -- and found Mr Meagles in an excited state walking up and down his room .
He then stirred the fire and left me .
No , that she won ’ t , but you little think why , <NAME> boy ! ’ While Mrs. Sliderskew , influenced possibly by some lingering feelings of disappointment and personal slight , occasioned by her old master ’ s preference for another , was giving loose to these grumblings below stairs , <NAME> was cogitating in the parlour
Ha -- send for the horses , pack the carriages , I ’ ll not set foot in this man ’ s house again ! ’ No one had interfered in the dispute , which was beyond the <NAME> colloquial powers of <NAME> , <NAME> , and scarcely within the province of the ladies .
‘ I augur all sort of good from your sensible decision. ’ ‘ <NAME> , you do us a great deal of honour , ’ he rejoined .
I told the gentleman at first , when he told me upstairs it was come to light , that I would answer for your being umble , and making amends .
The basin fell to the ground broken , and the water flowed to the feet of <NAME> .
I spoke to him , and he spoke to me .
I ’ ll tell you what I ’ ve said and done tomorrow. ’ Without waiting for a reply , he darted off at a rapid pace , and , plunging into the crowds which thronged the street , was quickly lost to view .
Finally he gave a faint single rap , and <NAME> -- such was the compromising name of the avenging boy -- announced “ Mr .
‘ If you ’ re in arnest , you see , my lad , ’ said the <NAME> , ‘ you ’ re a object of clemency , and clemency is the brightest jewel in the crown of a <NAME> ’ s head , for which you ’ ll overhaul the constitution as laid down in <NAME> , and ,
He was standing close beside it , with one of his skeleton hands over his mouth , and the other resting on the <NAME> ’ s table .
I found her with a well-formed figure ; a strongly-marked , nervous-sanguine temperament ; a large and beautifully-shaped head ; and the whole system in healthy action .
`` No , no , we will try to prevent that .
As he looked , she became blended with the child he had loved , and he could hardly separate the two .
`` I believe it , my dear Charley .
'Not one , ' replied <NAME> , in a voice rendered husky by regret ; 'not one . '
It was altogether unaccountable that a young gentleman whose imagination had been strangled in his cradle , should be still inconvenienced by its ghost in the form of grovelling sensualities ; but such a monster , beyond all doubt , was <NAME> .
‘ My dear Sir , ’ she said , addressing Mr Dombey , at whose munificence both she and <NAME> were shedding tears copiously ; ‘ I think you have overlooked something .
It was a weight to bear alone ; still my present duty appeared to be plain , and blest in the attachment of my dear , I did not want an impulse and encouragement to do it .
It follows naturally on the sights we have just left .
You can put on the cards and in the advertisements , “ Education by <NAME> and able assistants , ” without having any assistants , can ’ t you ?
How unfortnet do you want me fur to be ?
So I thanked her ardently for this mark of her affection , and for all her other kindnesses towards me ; and after a tender good night , she took her nightcap into my bedroom .
Observe the blood which is trickling from her finger ; also the gold-eyed needle of the period , with which she is at work. ’ All this , <NAME> repeated twice or thrice : pointing to the finger and the needle at the right times : and then passed on to the next .
“ You say again you are quite sure that it was the prisoner ? ” The witness was quite sure .
‘ These are only some pupils of mine , ’ said <NAME> , pointing to the little boy on the trunk and the two little boys on the floor , who had been staring at each other without uttering a word , and writhing their bodies into most remarkable contortions , according to the custom of little boys when they
Having stolen in unobserved , he playfully leaned on the back of <NAME> ’ s chair , and , as <NAME> saw him , put one of <NAME> ’ s wandering locks to his lips , and waved a kiss from it towards <NAME> .
‘ Quite so , ’ assented his partner .
<NAME> , you are a wag .

The stranger said nothing until <NAME> put his key in his door ; then , seeming to make sure of his identity from the action , he spoke : ‘ I beg your pardon , ’ he said , coming from the window with a frank and smiling air , and a prepossessing address ; ‘ the beans. ’ <NAME>
'We must make up for lost time when we 've got things into a good train .
The connection between the two places was by a hilly turnpike-road , and the travelling on that road was very slow .
'What do _you_ do here ? '
But how the graces and elegancies which she had dispersed about the poorly-furnished room went to the heart of <NAME> !
It was like her cordial voice in my ears .
‘ Does he deny that he did ?
Therefore , when <NAME> and I sat down with him by his fire , I asked him first of all whether he relied on <NAME> 's judgment and sources of information ?
He was going to say that you were not -- what ?

Put him out , Smike. ’ The drudge knew better from long experience , than to hesitate about obeying , so he bundled the victim out by a side-door , and <NAME> perched himself again on his own stool , supported by Mrs. Squeers , who occupied another at his side .
‘ For why ? ’ growled <NAME> , looking at his friend for the first time .
‘ But let me go on thinking the facts out , and avoid confusing them with my speculations .
‘ How can I feel otherwise than flattered by your notice in any way ? ’ ‘ Oh !
As it is the custom in these parts to give a horse a gallon or so of cold water whenever he is in a foam with heat , we halted for that purpose , at a log inn in the wood , far removed from any other residence .
And I do not doubt that this man -- whatever they call him , I forget his name -- is one of them. ’ The landlady ’ s lively speech was received with greater favour at the Break of Day , than it would have elicited from certain amiable whitewashers of the class she so unreasonably objected to , nearer
Sometimes my aunt and <NAME> were invited to do so , and accepted the invitation .
Oh , I should be so glad if you did know better , but I am so very much afraid that I must know best ! ’ <NAME> asked her , laughing outright , whether she ever saw her own face or heard her own voice ?
`` Really , I think I could do a greater thing than that if the need were pressing .
We received the news of their safe arrival , and perhaps another letter , or perhaps two ; but , since then , they have gradually taken their road in life -- we , ours -- and we have held no correspondence. ” “ Perfectly so , madame , ” replied the spy .
I was at the coach office to take leave of her and see her go ; and there was he , returning to <NAME> by the same conveyance .
Many feet came up the creaking stairs ; and the step of some seemed to his listening ear so like that of the man for whom he waited , that <NAME> often stood up to be ready to address him when he reached the top ; but , one by one , each person turned off into some room short
He lighted his lantern from that which <NAME> had detached from the rope , and now carried in his hand ; and making no effort to prolong the discourse , descended in silence , followed by his wife .
He followed , however , quickly ; and saw Mr Meagles going down the street with his enemy at his side .
`` This foreign young woman has been my lodger for some weeks back . ''
“ If I could buy the furniture now hired for me , ” said I , “ and one or two other little things , I should be quite at home there. ” “ Go it ! ” said <NAME> , with a short laugh .
‘ Show us into the room at once , without announcing us , ’ said the little man , ‘ and it ’ s yours. ’ <NAME> threw the painted tops into a corner , and led the way through a dark passage , and up a wide staircase .
<NAME> <NAME> , thus mutely appealed to ; and possibly feeling his personal pride and influence interested in the immediate reduction of <NAME> to reason ; gave utterance to about a couple of score of curses and threats , the rapid production of which reflected great credit on the fertility of his invention .
'Very true , ' said the undertaker ; 'they would indeed . '
`` Of <NAME> , '' says <NAME> , hitting him again .
They have wondered how I have suffered it .
If ever an old gentleman had made a point of appearing in public , shaved close and clean , that old gentleman was <NAME> .
‘ Yes , ’ he said without emotion , ‘ it was <NAME> , he knew .
After a preliminary raising of his spirits with the information that she considered the patient decidedly worse , she would further cheer him up by relating how dull , listless , and low-spirited <NAME> was , because <NAME> foolishly talked about nothing else but him and family matters .
‘ Well , well ! ’ he said with a sigh , dismissing , as I then saw , some trial she had borne , or was yet to bear , in connexion with what my aunt had told me .
Learning from <NAME> that the invitation referred to the evening then wearing away , I expressed my readiness to do honour to it ; and we went off together to the lodging which <NAME> occupied as <NAME> , and which was situated near the top of the <NAME> ’ s <NAME> .
<NAME> Leicester generally refers back in his mind to <NAME> and arranges a sequence of events on a plan of his own .
When they were within two paces of each other , <NAME> 's <NAME> held up its hand , warning him to come no nearer .
‘ <NAME> requires me to put perfect faith in him , and he shall not be disappointed. ’ She went up to <NAME> one day , to meet him , in order that they might make some purchases .
His arms are swelled because of being bound so tight , his wooden shoes are large and clumsy , and he is lame .
If he is not -- and you tell me he is not ; on any pretence ; it is indifferent to me what -- my doors are shut against him henceforth , and yours , I take it for granted , are open to him. ’ To this address , my aunt had listened with the closest attention , sitting
Though it would cost him a hard pang to leave her , and though he could think of no similar place in which his condemnation would not pursue him , perhaps it was almost a relief to be forced away from the endurance of the last four days , even to unknown difficulties and distresses .
‘ Now , what I will say for you , my dear , ’ the cherub pursued mildly and without a notion of complaining , ‘ is , that you are so adaptable .
He turned his thoughts back to the starting-point of this unknown injury ; and in the meantime <NAME> , having rolled his green packet pretty round , cut it carefully into three pieces , and laid it on a plate as if it were some particular delicacy .
‘ Not to deceive you , sir , I notice it , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ and I take it kind of you. ’ He was at a loss to understand what she meant ; and by expressing as much in his looks , elicited her explanation .
The scene was altered to a small bedroom , where the fairest and youngest child lay dying ; the roses had fled from his cheek , and the light from his eye ; and even as the sexton looked upon him with an interest he had never felt or known before , he died .
Indeed , the quarrel , from slight beginnings , rose to a considerable height , and was assuming a very violent complexion , when both parties , falling into a great passion of tears , exclaimed simultaneously , that they had never thought of being spoken to in that way : which exclamation , leading to a remonstrance , gradually

His enemy , muttering to himself , after wringing his wounded hand for sometime , slowly drew off his neck-kerchief and bound it up ; then held it in his other hand , and sat upon his table with his sullen face looking down .
They soon grew into a habit ; and we are creatures of habit -- creatures of habit ! ’ Putting his hands into his pockets , and leaning back in his chair , he looked at the brother and sister as if it were interesting to him to see them together ; and went on to say , with a
If you are poor , let us be poor together ; but let me be with you , do let me be with you ; do not let me see such change and not know why , or I shall break my heart and die .

Similarly , <NAME> continues to post tremendous placards on the disputed thoroughfare and ( with his bird upon his head ) to hold forth vehemently against <NAME> in the sanctuary of his own home ; similarly , also , he defies him as of old in the little church by testifying a bland unconsciousness of his existence .

<NAME> has consulted me in reference to what he has in contemplation ; and I have advised him to the best of my judgement. ’ ‘ Unless I deceive myself , <NAME> , ’ pursued <NAME> , ‘ what I contemplate is a disclosure of an important nature. ’ ‘ Highly so , ’ said <NAME> .

<NAME> felt a little vague trepidation as to the subject-matter of this same consultation , until Mrs <NAME> announced it .

‘ Then p ’ raps you ’ ll give him Mrs <NAME> ’ s respects , and say that the next time he lowers himself and his lodgings by talking out of the winder she ’ ll thank him to come down and open the door too. ’ Mrs <NAME> spoke loud , and listened for any observations that might

If that dark-visaged eldest boy could look more malicious than he had already looked , this was the time when he did it .
He rose to honour the toast ; and , carefully depositing his empty pipe in a corner , advanced to the table , filled a glass with spirits , and drank off its contents .

Even then , it was only to ask : ‘ Where is your Lock ? ’ ‘ Twenty mile and odd -- call it five-and-twenty mile and odd , if you like -- up stream , ’ was the sullen reply .
<NAME> <NAME> replied with solemnity , ‘ No , dearest <NAME> , I am but too well aware that I am merely human. ’ Mrs <NAME> , for her part , still further improved the occasion by sitting with her eyes fastened on her husband , like two great black notes of interrogation , severely inquiring , Are you looking

I shall sink lower , and be worse. ” He leaned an elbow on her table , and covered his eyes with his hand .

‘ And when does the ship sail , <NAME> ? ’ asked my aunt .
So glad of the opportunity , I am sure ! ’ When the first shock fell upon him , <NAME> twice skipped back in his neat little shoes and his neat little silk stockings of a bygone fashion , as if impelled to leap over a sofa behind him ; but the large man closed with him and proved too

It may be that he became a little smarter in his dress after that memorable occasion ; and he certainly liked in his leisure time to walk towards that quarter of the town where Mr <NAME> ’ s house was situated , on the vague chance of passing little Florence in the street .
At sight of the dismayed look with which <NAME> regarded his tormentors , <NAME> , who was blessed with a lively sense of the ludicrous , fell into another ectasy , more boisterous than the first .

He did each single thing , as if he did nothing else -- a pretty certain indication in a man of that range of ability and purpose , that he is doing something which sharpens and keeps alive his keenest powers .
‘ The chief evil of their presence in the house , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ is that I can not be as near papa as I could wish -- <NAME> being so much between us -- and can not watch over him , if that is not too bold a thing to say , as closely as I would

When we were in our own room , and when she might perhaps have told me what I was so unprepared to hear , I gave her no encouragement to confide in me ; I never thought she stood in need of it .

But those were capital days , too , in <NAME> !
You have never entertained in secret any other proposal ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , ’ she returned , almost scornfully , ‘ what other proposal can have been made to _me_ ?
Look angry at me , <NAME> .
How -- ha -- how are they all , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Thank you , sir , They ’ re all pretty well , sir .
And in any one of these his many cares , from first to last , <NAME> never flagged nor faltered .

To add to his defeat , <NAME> , considering any such efforts an invasion of his peculiar privilege , eyed the offender steadily , through his glass , as if astonished at his presumption , and audibly stated his impression that it was an ‘ infernal liberty , ’ which being a hint to <NAME> , he put up HIS
‘ I ’ d come back to see you , after I was let out. ’ ‘ Give me the money again , ’ said the other , eagerly , ‘ and I ’ ll keep it , and never spend it .
It was the more questionable justice , <NAME> thought , in the <NAME> , from his having certainly overheard that great authority give his assent on the previous evening , to the proposition ( stated by <NAME> ) that poor dear little <NAME> was more old-fashioned than ever .

He had neither eaten nor drunk since last night , and , in addition to the anxiety of mind he had undergone , had been travelling about , from place to place almost incessantly , for many hours .
In commercial phrase , coffins were looking up ; and , in the course of a few weeks , <NAME> acquired a great deal of experience .

But there were worse troubles yet in store for him , and as they came on , his melancholy and sadness increased .
And let it be added , to <NAME> ’ s honour , that , though we have called her <NAME> , he called her the <NAME> from first to last ; and that upon every anniversary of the day on which he found her in his sick room , Mr <NAME> came to dinner , and there was great glorification

And when I come away from him , you know that my thoughts are with him. ” The dreadful condition to which he was brought , was so appalling to both of us , that we could not refer to it in plainer words .
I should be an inconvenience at <NAME> 's ; I was not expected , and my bed would not be ready ; I should be too far from <NAME> 's , and she was exacting and might n't like it .
‘ Thank you , it ’ s of no consequence , ’ retorted Mr Toots .
‘ Leave her alone , everybody ! ’ cried Mrs. Sparsit , with great energy .
Over and above this , <NAME> was very anxious `` to learn housekeeping , '' as she said .

But <NAME> had gone home after dressing her mistress , and the fat boy came back again more disturbed than before .
Kit no sooner comes in , than that single gentleman ( never was such a busy gentleman ) charges all the glasses -- bumpers -- and drinks his health , and tells him he shall never want a friend while he lives ; and so does Mr <NAME> , and so does <NAME> , and so does Mr Abel .

She laid her hand upon her breast , murmuring the sacred name that had been read to her ; and life passed from her face , like light removed .
And all 's fish that comes to my net .
I freely admit , I am a woman of business .
Still , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ I need not point out to you , <NAME> , that it is governed by the laws which govern lives in the aggregate. ’ ‘ While it lasts , I would wish to do the little I can , and the little I am fit for .

He would have followed her , but <NAME> , twisting his hand in his coat collar , dragged him towards the passage by which they had entered .
He ’ d open his eyes , that boy would , if he knew how empty of learning _my_ young maw was , at his time of life. ’ Which , by the by , he probably did know , for he had heard of it often enough .
‘ I can ’ t account for more than five , ’ said <NAME> , with an air of perplexity .
She was quicker to perceive the slightest matter here , than in any other case -- but one .
At length he rises , throws open the door of a corner cupboard , and refers to a few uncouth chalked strokes on its inner side .

You are acquainted , perhaps , with the famous name of <NAME> ? ’ ‘ The great Merdle ! ’ exclaimed Mrs General .
And my eldest brother lean ’ d upon his sword , Mr Boffin , And wiped away a tear. ’ Much impressed by this family circumstance , and also by the friendly disposition of Mr Wegg , as exemplified in his so soon dropping into poetry , Mr Boffin again shook hands with that ligneous sharper , and besought him
‘ I have done no worse , I have not disgraced you .
My name 's <NAME> , as you are aware , and I have got a peace-warrant against <NAME> .
Here he by no means diminished the impression he had just produced , for he ate hard eggs , shell and all , devoured gigantic prawns with the heads and tails on , chewed tobacco and water-cresses at the same time and with extraordinary greediness , drank boiling tea without winking , bit his fork and spoon till they bent

When she fell asleep in the little armchair by the high fender , the turnkey would cover her with his pocket-handkerchief ; and when she sat in it dressing and undressing a doll which soon came to be unlike dolls on the other side of the lock , and to bear a horrible family resemblance to Mrs Bangham -- he
These portentous infants being alarming creatures to stalk about in any human society , the eighteen denominations incessantly scratched one another ’ s faces and pulled one another ’ s hair by way of agreeing on the steps to be taken for their improvement—which they never did ; a surprising circumstance , when the happy adaptation of the means to
Then , and but then , he met her glance for an instant in her first surprise ; but when he touched her , in alighting , with his soft white hand , it overlooked him altogether as before .
More and more agitated , <NAME> paced her room , and paced the gallery , and looked out at the moon with a new fancy of her likeness to a pale fugitive hurrying away and hiding her guilty face .
He was pursued and taken with the property in his possession , and was sentenced to two years ’ imprisonment .
I hope I may not be misunderstood on this subject , for it is one in which I take a strong and deep interest .
‘ Therefore , my dear Doctor , ’ said the <NAME> , giving him several affectionate taps , ‘ you may command me , at all times and seasons .
And indeed , I think we are all engaged , except the baby. ” “ Then you are ? ” said I .
That 's all to be said at present .
<NAME> and time have taught me what to do .
It passed me , and went on to <NAME> .
Log of the <NAME> states , that a breeze springing up in the night , the wreck was seen no more .
There young <NAME> was , at any rate ; possessed of the gruffest of voices and the shrillest of minds ; sticking ornamental pins into his shirt , and keeping a ring in his waistcoat pocket to put on his little finger by stealth , when the pupils went out walking ; constantly falling in love by sight with nurserymaids
What ’ s your motive in this ? ’ ‘ <NAME> take the man ! ’ exclaimed my aunt .
‘ I see I take you with me !
Likeways when I went to them two Governors , <NAME> and the t ’ other Governor , with my information , I may have been a little over-eager for the cause of justice , or ( to put it another way ) a little over-stimilated by them feelings which rouses a man up , when a pot of money is
<NAME> away. ’ ‘ It is upon honour , sir ? ’ the other still stipulated , with respectful firmness .
There was a third , <NAME> , who I fancied would sing it .
On the entrance of his friends , that gentleman laid down his knife and fork , and with a mournful air advanced to meet them .
<NAME> <NAME> being indeed fatigued , fell into a slumber , and waking in about half an hour , inquired what time it was .
After great difficulty and much puzzling , he contrived to read as follows : -- My dear young Man .
The old man , having obeyed his directions , sat down on the edge of a chair , and , folding his hands before him , gradually yielded to the influence of the warmth , and dozed .
Lieutenant <NAME> turned round to his friend <NAME> , with a scarcely perceptible shrug of the shoulder , as if implying some doubt of the accuracy of his recollection .
A blazing sun upon a fierce August day was no greater rarity in southern <NAME> then , than at any other time , before or since .
How dare you think , <NAME> , that we would have you marry for money , when youth , beauty , and every amiable virtue and excellence were to be had for love ?
<NAME> cleaned down with soft soap and soda .
She has a lover , who has followed her , first all the way from <NAME> , and then all the way from <NAME> , and who has just confided to me that he means to follow her everywhere .
He was seated on the ice , making spasmodic efforts to smile ; but anguish was depicted on every lineament of his countenance .
To think that this lost child , who was to have divided with him his riches , and his projects , and his power , and allied with whom he was to have shut out all the world as with a double door of gold , should have let in such a herd to insult him with their knowledge of

But he bought more than one. ’ ‘ Yes , to be sure , sir ; he bought several ; and wishing to lay out his money to the best , he took my opinion to guide his choice , and we went over the collection together .
‘ As thick , ’ repeated Mr Rugg , ‘ as we could reasonably have expected .
‘ Think of soon returning to the old country , sir ! ’ repeats the Doctor .
But I can not bear it. ’ ‘ It ’ s my belief you hate the sight of the very river. ’ ‘ I -- I do not like it , father. ’ ‘ As if it wasn ’ t your living !
‘ What is the matter between us ? ’ said <NAME> .
Even money could not buy them now ; everything must come out , and everybody must know all .
However , it has nothing to do with the present subject , excepting that <NAME> looked so like it at the moment that it came into my head . ''
You will be good enough to observe , <NAME> , that no message to Mrs Dombey with which you are or may be charged , admits of reply .
‘ You know me , boy ? ’ ‘ Please , <NAME> , yes , <NAME> , ’ returned <NAME> , tumbling with his hat , and still fixed by Mr <NAME> ’ s eye , and fruitlessly endeavouring to unfix himself .
“ Why need you tell me what I have not asked ?
‘ On wi ’ ‘ em , ’ said <NAME> , forcing the wrong arm into the wrong sleeve , and winding the tails of the coat round the fugitive ’ s neck .
‘ When I married , I found that my brother was even at that time heavily in debt .
‘ Halloa ! ’ he cried , calling him roughly back .
No shame upon her brow ; no late repentance bending her disdainful neck .
`` I do n't expect nothink at all , sir , much , but that 's the true hist'ry on it . ''

His great theme was ‘ Warren the ěn_gine_ driver , ’ whom he pressed into the service of every sentence he uttered .
He toiled out at that low door so bent and worn , and then he took his breath and stood upright , and looked all round him at the sky , and the wind blew upon him , and his life down in the dark was over ! -- Till he was called back to life , ’ she added
I am thrown away in society .
You shall see her tomorrow night .
I have a presentiment that he WILL mention it the first thing this morning . ''
There was a pause , during which , <NAME> , who had covered her face with one hand , gave free vent to her tears .
Bother your people ! ’ interposed <NAME> , with a toss of her head .
<NAME> after book was added to the heap of failures , <NAME> being firmly watchful of us all the time .
And you ain ’ t gone , ain ’ t you ?

I ’ ve brought little Wackford up , on purpose to show to parents and guardians .
Soon he was up again , and away , -- not far into the country , but back towards <NAME> by the high-road -- then back again -- then over another part of the same ground as he already traversed -- then wandering up and down in fields , and lying on ditches ' brinks to rest , and starting

“ Nothing was ever discovered , <NAME> ? ” “ Nothing. ” “ Do you know what is become of <NAME> ? ” “ I should think from the color of his clothes that he is working in the quarries. ” “ Of course you have seen him then ? -- Why are you looking at that dark tree in
I mourned for my child-wife , taken from her blooming world , so young .
Not before dark night did the men and women come back to the children , wailing and breadless .
Some slight symptoms of vitality having been awakened in <NAME> by the soda-water , he suffered himself to be prevailed upon to wash his face and hands , and to submit to be brushed by <NAME> .
Upon my word , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ I scarcely slept all last night through thinking of doing this ; and could not make up my mind when I was out , whether to do it or not ; and yet I am sure it is the true feeling of my heart , and I should have
‘ That ’ s the pint , sir , ’ interposed <NAME> ; ‘ out vith it , as the father said to his child , when he swallowed a farden. ’ ‘ We want to know , in the first place , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ whether you have any reason to be discontented with your present situation.
“ Perhaps it is as well we _did _lose sight of him , for he has been living alone there , in the most abject misery , all the time , and he is poor -- very poor. ” ‘ “ Very good , ” said the attorney .
Towards evening , the weather turned hazy , with a drizzling rain ; and soon became so thick , that we sailed , as it were , in a cloud .
‘ By keeping silence upon the subject , my dear sir , ’ returned brother Charles .
I ’ m sure of him where he is , whenever I want him for my own purposes , and , besides , he ’ s a good unconscious spy on <NAME> , and tells , in his cups , all that he sees and hears .
There was plenty of width for that , and room to spare ; which is perhaps the reason why <NAME> thought he saw a locomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom .
But there ’ s no need to talk ; tomorrow will soon be here. ’ ‘ And wha-at ’ s to be done tomorrow ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
'Good boy , <NAME> -- well done -- ' he mumbled .
You are sure you understand. ’ He had wormed a finger , in the darkness , through a button-hole of <NAME> ’ s coat , and was screwing that corner of the garment tight up round and round , in an extraordinary manner .
‘ What say you , <NAME> ? ’ <NAME> scratched his head and shook it , but said nothing at all .
‘ You could go away , and grow almost out of knowledge , and never come to tell your poor old friend how fortunate you were , proud lad !
what is to be done ! ’ It naturally occurred to him on very little reflection , that the first step to take would be to communicate with one of the Mr Garlands instantly .
‘ Now , my life , ’ said <NAME> , taking her on his knee , ‘ tell me all about it. ’ All very well to say , ‘ Tell me all about it ; ’ but <NAME> was very much confused .
`` Your mind will be all the better for not running on one point too continually , and I 'll tell you for a change .

He had scarcely moved since the trial began ; and now that the judge ceased to speak , he still remained in the same strained attitude of close attention , with his gaze bent on him , as though he listened still .

Sit down , you dancing , prancing , shambling , scrambling poll-parrot !
‘ Old lady , ’ said Mr Boffin , ‘ stop that noise !
‘ I ’ ve found ‘ em out , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ I was acquainted with all this , you know , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ except the last clause , long ago .
I suppose sense in certain quarters ; you suppose mincing bread-and-butter nonsense .
But , it would have been a stranger contrast still , to have read the hearts that were beating side by side ; to have laid bare the gentle innocence of the one , and the rugged villainy of the other ; to have hung upon the guileless thoughts of the affectionate girl , and been amazed that , among
This is a great advancement for her in life , Mr Rokesmith .

I ought to have thought of it before. ’ Immediately flying to the bell , and calling for mulled wine as impetuously as if it had been wanted for instant use in the recovery of some person apparently drowned , the single gentleman made <NAME> ’ s mother swallow a bumper of it at such a high temperature that the
All his proceedings were the result of the nicest and coldest calculation ; and it was not without cause that Mrs. Sparsit habitually observed of him , that he was a young man of the steadiest principle she had ever known .
At length there was a cry of silence , and a breathless look from all towards the door .
Yet <NAME> was in one of his sanguine states and in good spirits and was thoroughly pleased to see <NAME> again , whom he had always liked .
So he said , ‘ Florence , you may go and look at your pretty brother , if you like , I daresay .

Unfortunately , the property of <NAME> was settled upon herself .

As he stands at his door in <NAME> 's Court in his grey shop-coat and black calico sleeves , looking up at the clouds , or stands behind a desk in his dark shop with a heavy flat ruler , snipping and slicing at sheepskin in company with his two 'prentices , he is emphatically a retiring and unassuming man

I think <NAME> ’ s means were straitened at about this time ; but it is little to the purpose .
<NAME> <NAME> would often ask me in a whisper , or when we were alone , “ Does she grow prettier and prettier , <NAME> ? ” And when I said yes ( for indeed she did ) , would seem to enjoy it greedily .
‘ It is not worth my while , ’ pursues <NAME> , becoming handsomely mollified , ‘ and it is the reverse of important to my position .
They know what a clever lad he is ; he 'll be a lifer .
The gentleman had left <NAME> , but I think a messenger was sent after him to beg the favour of his waiting for me here. ” “ I was happy , ” said <NAME> , “ to be entrusted with the charge .
Where have you hidden her ? ’ Showing that he was taken by surprise , the old man looked at his master with some passing confusion , which the master highly enjoyed .
When I tried to conquer my misplaced love , and to be generous to the man who was more fortunate than I , though he should never know it or repay me with a gracious word , in whom had I watched patience , self-denial , self-subdual , charitable construction , the noblest generosity of the affections ?
His look was thoughtful , but had a benignant expression in it which I often ( how often ! )

Then the child ’ s head disappeared , and the prison-keeper ’ s head disappeared , but the little voice prolonged the strain until the door clashed .
‘ <NAME> , ’ said that eccentric functionary , ‘ furniter ’ s cheap where you come from , <NAME> .
<NAME> , for <NAME> ’ s sake , explain it ! ’ <NAME> , who had only waited for a hearing , at once recounted how he had been placed in his then distressing predicament ; how the fear of giving rise to domestic dissensions had alone prompted him to avoid <NAME> on his entrance ; how he merely meant
<NAME> , make room for one of these gentlemen on the box .
“ Unsettled weather , a long journey , uncertain means of travelling , a disorganised country , a city that may not be even safe for you. ” “ My dear <NAME> , ” said <NAME> , with cheerful confidence , “ you touch some of the reasons for my going : not for my staying away .
‘ Who do you suppose will ever employ a professional man , when they see his boy playing at marbles in the gutter , or flying the garter in the horse-road ?
‘ Not his merit that he don ’ t cheat me , ’ was Mr Fledgeby ’ s commentary delivered with a wink , ‘ but my precaution. ’ He then with a lazy grandeur asserted his rights as lord of <NAME> and Co. by poking his cane at the stools and boxes , and spitting in the fireplace ,
Why are you not in your usual spirits , <NAME> ? ’ <NAME> faltered that she was much the same as she was in general ; she was not aware of being different .
‘ I am not too proud to believe it , <NAME> .
They left her at the corner of the street , and <NAME> led the way to <NAME> 's , which was within a few minutes ' walk .
Her inducement to come to me , relying on my confidence , had been the hope that I could tell her the name and place of abode .
<NAME> , whom I had seen at <NAME> 's on the same occasion , also turned up .
Holly , mistletoe , red berries , ivy , turkeys , geese , game , poultry , brawn , meat , pigs , sausages , oysters , pies , puddings , fruit , and punch , all vanished instantly .
How long have they taken these lodgings for ? ’ ‘ Only from week to week , ’ replied <NAME> .
`` Why , I hear of her , <NAME> , '' replied <NAME> , `` through <NAME> , but I see very little of her .
Overpowered with watching and exertion , I had closed my eyes for a few minutes , when I felt a violent clutch on my shoulder .
I have been very unhappy since she died .
‘ Now then ! ’ cried <NAME> , poking his head out at the front-door .
What has been my history , that I should be at the pains of entreating either them or you not to have it so !
“ You ! ” He appeared disposed to add more , but indignation choked his utterance , so he lifted up one of his very pliable legs , and , flourishing it above his head a little , to insure his aim , administered a good sound kick to <NAME> ; immediately after which , all the goblins in waiting
‘ Here is a gentleman in <NAME> ’ s apartment , whom he wishes to have the pleasure of presenting to you , my love ! ’ <NAME> immediately reappeared , and shook hands with me again .
You are a young gentleman to be smiled on , <NAME> , and you must learn your walue , sir. ’ Mrs. Crupp always called me <NAME> : firstly , no doubt , because it was not my name ; and secondly , I am inclined to think , in some indistinct association with a washing-day .
‘ My brother and I are just the same .
You know that at length I gave it up , and declined to guess any more .
“ I can not think , ” said <NAME> , raising her eyes after a silence “ why you should be so unreasonable when I come to see you after a separation .
‘ This is what your loving <NAME> calls the best time in the day and night , ’ said the person of the house .
“ Here is monsieur , who knows a well-made shoe when he sees one .
‘ You will restrain any demonstrative championship or vengeance in this place , of course , <NAME> ? ’ said she , looking over her shoulder at me with the same expression .
Out with it. ’ ‘ How ’ tis , ma ’ am , ’ resumed <NAME> , appearing still to find his natural refuge in <NAME> ’ s face , ‘ that what is best in us fok , seems to turn us most to trouble an ’ misfort ’ n an ’ mistake , I dunno .
Excuse me , but you do seem a little tired , and unless you ’ re very anxious to get on -- ’ ‘ Yes , yes , we are , ’ returned the old man fretfully .
From the moment of that interchange of looks , they never uttered his name , or any reference to him , aloud ; nor ever pursued the subject of the robbery , when <NAME> spoke of it .
So it is with the one great cardinal virtue , which , properly nourished and exercised , leads to , if it does not necessarily include , all the others .
‘ Do you mean to go and seek your fortune ? ’ ‘ I expect I shall be forced to go to <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> , ‘ and live there. ’ ‘ You might have gone farther off , ’ I said , brightening a little , ‘ and been as bad as lost .
When the last ‘ natural ’ had been declared , and the profit and loss account of fish and sixpences adjusted , to the satisfaction of all parties , <NAME> rang for supper , and the visitors squeezed themselves into corners while it was getting ready .
‘ We should all have been lost without <NAME> .
That ’ s what you ’ ll have to break to her .
It was the poor schoolmaster .
Let it stand for this day week , and you shall receive my printed address in the meantime .
`` I think you had better call me guardian , my dear . ''
The local influence of my family was quite unavailing to obtain any employment in that department , for a man of <NAME> ’ s abilities .
Nothing but flight can save us .
I was to stay in the house , and was to be married from the house .
‘ That stone has worn away and been replaced by others , and many generations have come and gone since then .
It is natural , under these circumstances , that he , in his turn , should remember the friend to whom he is indebted for so promising an acquaintance .
And notwithstanding various blandishments on the part of <NAME> , <NAME> still said no , and said it too with such determined and resolute ill-temper , that <NAME> was clearly taken aback .
The bottle-green suit had been brushed , ready for the morrow .
Who set this chap on , in this dress , when the carting began ?
Your mind will be more at peace , lying here , if you make Lizzie your wife .
This was his unvarying reply .
‘ But come , ’ said <NAME> , as if suddenly recollecting himself ; ‘ we must not forget our mission in the pleasure of this interview .
When he was freshest and truest , he loved me .
There was a very dirty lady in his little room , and two wan girls , his daughters , with shock heads of hair .
From hour to hour I reproach myself for that excess of faith and trustfulness which has led to such distressing consequences ; and almost from minute to minute , I hope that Mr Dombey may explain himself , and relieve the torture I undergo , which is extremely wearing .
That he had the bottle somewhere about him could not be doubted ; where , was not so clear .
Bail you to any amount , and only charge half a crown .
It brushes the <NAME> cobwebs away , and pleases the <NAME> .
So the day came , as all other days come to people who will only stick to reason ; and when it came , there were married in the church of the florid wooden legs—that popular order of architecture—Josiah <NAME> of <NAME> , to <NAME> eldest daughter of <NAME> of <NAME> , M.P .
‘ Perhaps , ’ he returned , ‘ I have said enough .

`` Either this boy sticks to it like cobbler's-wax or there is something out of the common here that beats anything that ever came into my way at <NAME> and <NAME> 's . ''
He pulled it off and showed 'em me .
<NAME> grass and rank weeds straggled over all the marshy land in the vicinity .
One , of a female , over the door , he called ‘ The <NAME> of the Lake. ’ He smiled as I looked at these contrivances to while away the time ; but when I looked from them to him , I saw that his lip trembled , and could have counted the beating of his heart .
But he suffered Mr Casby to go out , without offering any further remark , and then took a peep at him over the little green window-blinds .
'In that way of business , ' rejoined <NAME> ; 'and so are the people of the house .
Stooping again to come out at the low-arched door , they left it burning , and retraced their way to the courtyard ; seeming to recover their sense of hearing as they came down , until they were in the raging flood once more .
I can stand any fire better than a fire of cross questions .
‘ You addressed the daughter , I observed , ’ said Mr Dombey , after a short pause , ‘ as <NAME> Granger. ’ ‘ Edith <NAME> , <NAME> , ’ returned the Major , stopping short again , and punching a mark in the ground with his cane , to represent her , ‘ married ( at eighteen )
‘ But WERE you ever married , <NAME> ? ’ says I .
They told her I was gone to seek her , and what my parting words was. ’ ‘ Is that another letter in your hand ? ’ said I .
‘ But I am made , ’ said <NAME> to Mr Chick , ‘ of no more account than <NAME> !
Advancing to the door of the mysterious apartment , they were not a little surprised to hear a human voice , chanting with a highly elaborated expression of melancholy , and in tones of suffocation which a human voice might have produced from under five or six feather-beds of the best quality , the once popular air of ‘ Has
This was all so pleasant that I hope it made me still more like the mountain than I had been before .

‘ Yes , my lady lass , ’ returned the <NAME> .
The old Instrument-maker , seated in a corner between <NAME> and <NAME> , and nodding at <NAME> , who was looking on , all smiles and delight , answered the Captain thus : ‘ <NAME> , my dear boy , although I have heard something of the changes of events here , from my pleasant friend there -- what a

`` Is this your young attendant ? ''
As we were thus conversing in a low tone while <NAME> 's sustained growl vibrated in the beam that crossed the ceiling , the room door opened , and a very pretty , slight , dark-eyed girl of twenty or so came in with a basket in her hand : whom <NAME> tenderly relieved of the basket , and presented

Mr Feeder then gave him to understand that he would be expected to inform <NAME> and <NAME> , in superfine small-hand , that Mr P. Dombey would be happy to have the honour of waiting on them , in accordance with their polite invitation .
'Very good , ' said that gentleman , sipping his peppermint ; ' I 'll call at <NAME> 's as I go home , and tell him to send to-morrow morning .
He had heard from <NAME> ’ s own lips when he stood tapping at the door on that night of his taking the lodgings , that the marriage would have been on her part thoroughly mercenary .
Evening had come on when I lifted up my eyes and saw my guardian standing in the little hall .
Through all his stages , <NAME> followed him with the same strange interest .
After <NAME> had got into bed , he lay awake for a long time , still bemoaning his analysis , and saying he knew it was all wrong , and they couldn ’ t have analysed a murderer worse , and -- how would Doctor Blimber like it if his pocket-money depended on it ?
Now , this is a pretty sort of thing , isn ’ t it , that you should have been left here , all these years , and no money paid after the first six -- nor no notice taken , nor no clue to be got who you belong to ?

“ In that more peaceful state , I have imagined her , in the moonlight , coming to me and taking me out to show me that the home of her married life was full of her loving remembrance of her lost father .
Starting on equal terms , I want to put before you how you have shown your gratitude to me , for doing all I could to further your wishes with reference to my sister .
‘ No -- not much o ’ that either ; you ’ ve lost ten minutes here , and gone away as wise as you came , arter all .

Mr Sloppy having shaken his head to a considerable extent , proceeded to remark that he thought <NAME> ‘ must have took ‘ em from the Minders. ’ Being asked what he meant , he answered , them that come out upon him and partickler his chest .
<NAME> , a disappointed suitor , has been here to-day and has been alarming .

I would not shame you by seeming to take them to heart , or treat them earnestly for an instant .
‘ No. ’ ‘ Charming woman , <NAME> , ’ said the Major , with a fat laugh rising in his short throat , and nearly suffocating him .

But it is full of indignation to-night after undergoing the ordeal of consigning to the tomb the remains of a faithful , a zealous , a devoted adherent . ''
Where I live , I mean. ’ ‘ Indeed ! ’ returned <NAME> quickly .
There was one dim unformed fear lingering about his sister ’ s mind , to which she never gave utterance , which surrounded the graceless and ungrateful boy with a dreadful mystery .
‘ The Helter-Skelter Plate at the races , child -- the plate that was run for on the second day. ’ ‘ On the second day , ma ’ am ? ’ ‘ Second day !

And it was a comfort to me , and an impulse to me , and I felt a dignity rise up within me that was derived from him when I thought so .
‘ Yes , he is , <NAME> , ’ replied the landlady .
But her affectionate nature was so happy in what I now said to her with my whole heart , that her face became a laughing one before her glittering eyes were dry .
He sat looking at the horse ’ s ears , as if he saw something new there ; and sat so , for a considerable time .
'_I_ did that , sir , ' said a great lubberly fellow , stepping forward ; 'and preciously I cut my knuckle agin ' his mouth .

Even when it had grown dusk , and the shadows of coming night made it more solemn still , the child remained , like one rooted to the spot , and had no fear or thought of stirring .
There you sit , a man as has had his head broke from infancy up ’ ards , and has got a new opinion into it at every seam as has been opened .
‘ <NAME> us all aboot it , mun ; coom , quick ! ’ Although he could not keep pace with <NAME> ’ s impatience , Mr Squeers related the lucky chance by which <NAME> had fallen into his hands , as quickly as he could , and , except when he was interrupted by the admiring remarks of his
`` Not even any one who had attended on him ? ''
Dear Mr Clennam , I write to you from my own room at <NAME> , thinking you will be glad to hear from me .
For a man so expert in most things of that kind , <NAME> takes time to open the door and makes some noise too .

Because , why should I do anything else ?
I rather thought that everyone was struck by his not being proud , and taking notice of us .

Men talk of <NAME> as an abstract thing , and lose sight of what is natural while they do so .
<NAME> made his best bow , and stepped into the presence of a lady and gentleman seated at breakfast .
He told me once there should be a day of reckoning between us , sooner or later .
‘ I don ’ t know why we unfortunate creatures should be supposed to want common sense , but it is generally taken for granted that we do .
‘ Have you the face to utter the word to me ? ’ ‘ The face , too ! ’ replied <NAME> , staring at him with cold scorn .
My whispered words to Mrs. Bucket when she had the sheet in her mouth were , 'My dear , can you throw her off continually with natural accounts of my suspicions against <NAME> , and this , and that , and t'other ?

But it ’ s a dear good world , and I love it ! ’ ‘ It lies fair before you now , ’ said <NAME> .
We must guard ourselves from recognizing any positive engagement between <NAME> and our niece , until we have had an opportunity -- ’ ‘ Until YOU have had an opportunity , sister <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
Anything else we can do for him , besides giving her up ?
Still I think it charming .
How dare you to insinuate that you don ’ t know my character better than your words imply ? ’ ‘ I am sure , ’ my poor mother went on , at a grievous disadvantage , and with many tears , ‘ I don ’ t want anybody to go .
The old gentleman is newly shaken up by <NAME> to bear his part in the conversation .
'Why , I suppose if I was n't , I should n't be here , ' replied <NAME> .
The two travelled all night , except when they were left , for odd numbers of minutes , at branch-places , up illimitable flights of steps , or down wells—which was the only variety of those branches—and , early in the morning , were turned out on a swamp , a mile or two from the town they sought .
What else could you have made this young lady out to be , if she had listened to such addresses as yours ? ’ ‘ What else , if I had been so happy as to win her affections and possess her heart ? ’ ‘ Win her affections , ’ retorted Mr Boffin , with ineffable contempt , ‘

Having been hard at work in one dull enclosure all his life , he had a child ’ s delight in looking at shops .

He goes downstairs , and <NAME> tries to compose himself before the fire for waiting a long time .
The rich and beautiful wardrobe purchased by these agents , in the course of a few weeks made its way through the intervening country , bristling with custom-houses , garrisoned by an immense army of shabby mendicants in uniform who incessantly repeated the <NAME> ’ s Petition over it , as if every individual warrior among them were the ancient

The cause of this is not to be found in any local superstition that attaches to the Precincts—albeit a mysterious lady , with a child in her arms and a rope dangling from her neck , has been seen flitting about there by sundry witnesses as intangible as herself—but it is to be sought in the innate shrinking of dust

‘ I want to see a ruddier touch here , <NAME> , ’ he said , indicating his own healthy cheek by way of pattern .
As to the ladies , they were already abed , behind the red curtain , which was carefully drawn and pinned up the centre ; though as every cough , or sneeze , or whisper , behind this curtain , was perfectly audible before it , we had still a lively consciousness of their society .
‘ How came -- eh ! -- oh -- demmit , how d ’ ye do ? ’ ‘ I have been waiting , here some time , ma ’ am , ’ said <NAME> , addressing <NAME> .

' A nice person to prefer a charge against a poor boy ! '
It was a curious place : a large wall , with a gate in the middle , and a gas-light burning inside .
There were no ladies : the trip being a fatiguing one : and we were to start at five o ’ clock in the morning punctually .
He frightened every one away from him when he was alive , to profit us when he was dead !
'Not at all , my dear , ' said <NAME> humbly .
The bank had foreclosed a mortgage effected on the property thus pleasantly situated , by one of the <NAME> magnates , who , in his determination to make a shorter cut than usual to an enormous fortune , overspeculated himself by about two hundred thousand pounds .
She then holds up her tiny fingers , and spells the word in the manual alphabet ; next , she takes her types and arranges her letters ; and last , to make sure that she is right , she takes the whole of the types composing the word , and places them upon or in contact with the pencil
I wanted to persuade <NAME> to come and see <NAME> , but on my proposing it she ran off to her own room and locked herself in ; so I went to Traddles without her , and walked away with him on air .
‘ Your mother will be fit to jump out of her skin , my boy , when she hears of this , ’ said <NAME> to his son .
'You can do nothing to help me .
As he could not move a hand , he could make no sign of distress ; but , through this close watching ( if through no secret sympathy or power ) the little creature attained an understanding of him that <NAME> did not possess .
This was the state of matters , on the afternoon of , what I may be excused for calling , that eventful and important Friday .
‘ May I ask , ’ said I , ‘ without any hazard of repeating the mistake , how my old friends <NAME> and <NAME> are ? ’ ‘ Miss Wickfield , ’ said <NAME> , now turning red , ‘ is , as she always is , a pattern , and a bright example .
‘ Well , it ’ s not so much a trembling , ’ was the answer— ‘ though they do quiver—as a complete derangement of the nervous system .
This deed was done last night at ten o'clock .
‘ They are a depraved , worthless set .
In another place , lay an old sword that seemed to have been a soldier 's .
‘ But having had the honour of making that gentleman ’ s acquaintance at the hotel at <NAME> , where we and much good company met some time ago , and having had the honour of exchanging company and conversation with that gentleman on several subsequent excursions , I can hear nothing -- no , not even from one of
Here , <NAME> coughed impatiently ; which appeared to afford <NAME> the most exquisite delight .
I have set these people by the ears , and made two new enemies , where , <NAME> knows , I needed none .
‘ All I will add is , <NAME> forbid that I should touch my Uncle ’ s possessions , <NAME> !
“ Now your dinner is done , ” <NAME> presently said , “ why do n't you call a health , <NAME> ; why do n't you give your toast ? ” “ What health ?
From this day , <NAME> was seldom left alone ; but was placed in almost constant communication with the two boys , who played the old game with the Jew every day : whether for their own improvement or <NAME> 's , <NAME> best knew .
He darted onward -- straight , headlong -- dashing through brier and brake , and leaping gate and fence as madly as his dog , who careered with loud and sounding bark before him .
He cast back a dark look , and a threatening motion of the hand , towards the spot where he had left the bolder villain ; and went on his way : busying his bony hands in the folds of his tattered garment , which he wrenched tightly in his grasp , as though there were a hated enemy crushed
You are not to pocket other people 's pounds , shillings , and pence and escape scot-free . ''
‘ Well , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Mr Headstone coming home , ma ’ am. ’ In about a minute , <NAME> again hailed .
‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , with such a sudden accession of violence that <NAME> started in his boots , ‘ I throw you off for ever , miss .
Why , if it had been -- a smothering instead of a wedding , ’ Mrs <NAME> cast about in her mind with great pains for this form of expression , ‘ I couldn ’ t have said a word upon it , against them two clever ones. ’ ‘ In good faith , I believe so. ’ ‘ And
You have pawned your wardrobe. ’ ‘ Everything -- <NAME> ’ s too -- all shirts gone -- never mind -- saves washing .
‘ I beg your pardon , <NAME> ; but have you ever done this sort of thing in your time ? ’ said <NAME> .
For it is past your usual time , and will soon be late , and the way is long , and there is much company out of doors to-night. ’ She accepted the support he offered her , and they slowly passed out of the churchyard .
He found a contest still always going on in his breast between his promise to keep <NAME> in none but good aspects before the mind of Mr Meagles , and his enforced observation of <NAME> in aspects that had no good in them .
When he put his lips to hers , besides , he took himself into custody by the wrists , and backed himself among the ottomans and chairs and tables as if he were his own Police officer , saying to himself , ‘ Now , none of that !
If it had ever been meant to be lived in , I might have thought it small , or inconvenient , or lonely ; but never having been designed for any such use , it became a perfect abode .
‘ Favourites ? ’ repeated <NAME> , with the veins in his forehead swelling quickly .
Could you give me any account of her whatever ? ’ ‘ None , ’ returned the Patriarch , shaking his big head with his utmost benevolence .
‘ And now , <NAME> , ’ pursued <NAME> , ‘ I ’ ll make a confession to you .
Still , nobody appeared , to claim the dusty youngster from <NAME> , <NAME> .
‘ I should hope so , ’ returned Mr Toots .
Some of the people of the chateau , and some of those of the posting-house , and all the taxing authorities , were armed more or less , and were crowded on the other side of the little street in a purposeless way , that was highly fraught with nothing .
As to all the rest—What will be , will be .
‘ What do you mean , boy ? ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> ’ t agitate yourself , Louisa. ’ ‘ It ’ s very foolish of me , ’ said <NAME> , sitting down , and taking out her pocket-handkerchief , ‘ but he ’ s -- he ’ s such a perfect Dombey ! ’ Mr <NAME> coughed .
`` My dear ma'am , '' returns <NAME> , moving across the small apartment , `` the humble individual who now addresses you received that young lady in <NAME> when she first came here from the establishment to which you have alluded .
Both she and her brother , as they walked all together through the ancient streets , took great delight in what he pointed out of the <NAME> and the <NAME> ruin , and wondered—so his notes ran on—much as if they were beautiful barbaric captives brought from some wild tropical dominion .
At this point , the <NAME> , with a show of being very particular with a view to proceedings to be had thereafter , desired the jailer to communicate 'the names of them two files as was on the bench . '
‘ Go away , and shut the door .
Their conference was very short , but very decided .
As I had a sorrowful wish to see the old place once more , before it was locked up , I engaged to meet them there in the evening .
Give me a sign that you attend to me. ’ She slightly and constrainedly moves her hand .
It was not lost upon <NAME> , who delighted in torturing him , or indeed anybody else , when he could .
<NAME> ’ s mother , drying her eyes ( and moistening them , poor soul , more than she dried them ) , now took from the ground a small basket , and submissively addressed herself to the turnkey , saying , would he please to listen to her for a minute ?
I told him that he was more like himself in those latter words than in anything he had said yet .
They hurried away , through several streets , without stopping or speaking .
Oh , <NAME> ! ’ cried <NAME> , putting her hands before her face , as her tears started on it , ‘ I almost feel as if I had been papa ’ s enemy , instead of his loving child .
The women , all in one large room , were employed in making light clothing , for <NAME> and the <NAME> .
I was disagreeable too , <NAME> ; we were all of us disagreeable together .
Thank you , <NAME> , I do n't know but what I WILL take a marrow pudding . ''
At first they were faintly discernible in the mist , and above them the later stars still glimmered .
What was all this though -- even all this -- to the extraordinary dissipation that ensued , when <NAME> , walking into an oyster-shop as bold as if he lived there , and not so much as looking at the counter or the man behind it , led his party into a box -- a private box , fitted up
Like the <NAME> of questionable jollity in the song , They cared for <NAME> , no not they , and <NAME> cared for them .
While these occurrences were in progress , <NAME> made the discovery that <NAME> had a fascinating influence over her .
She will repeat it , in character , <NAME> , to-morrow morning. ’ ‘ In character ! ’ ‘ As <NAME> .
Having darkened the window , and straightened the pieces of carpet on the floor , the <NAME> surveyed these preparations with great delight , and descended to the little parlour again , to bring <NAME> to her bower .
<NAME> <NAME> sat in the workhouse parlour , with his eyes moodily fixed on the cheerless grate , whence , as it was summer time , no brighter gleam proceeded , than the reflection of certain sickly rays of the sun , which were sent back from its cold and shining surface .
So far as my small maid is concerned , I might suppose time to have stood for seven years as still as the mill did half an hour ago , since little Emma , <NAME> 's sister , is exactly what <NAME> used to be .
An elderly lady , though not very far advanced in years , with a proud carriage and a handsome face , was in the doorway as we alighted ; and greeting <NAME> as ‘ My dearest <NAME> , ’ folded him in her arms .
‘ And where did you leave <NAME> , reverend sir ? ’ <NAME> had left him at <NAME> .
When they arrived at the gateway where he had paused in the dark not many hours before , to picture to himself on which of the rough stones of the street her feet had trodden , he lifted her again , and carried her up the staircase to their rooms .
<NAME> take it away. ” I had never been struck at so keenly , for my thanklessness to <NAME> , as through the brazen impostor Pumblechook .
Seized with an augmented terror of myself which turned me cold , I ran from myself and everything , retraced the way by which I had come , and never paused until I had gained the lodge-gate , and the park lay sullen and black behind me .
It was you , was it ? ’ ‘ Me ! ’ returned <NAME> , in a loud tone .
‘ The fact is , I was ruined by having money left me. ’ ‘ Come , come , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ that von ’ t do .
Surely this is the heaviest of the three. ’ ‘ You ’ ll find ’ em much of a muchness , I expect , ’ says <NAME> .
And then they fell to shaking hands most heartily again .
Now , you ’ re all of you to drink the health of your best friend <NAME> , and wish him health and long life and many happy returns of this day , both for his own sake and that of your old masters , who consider him an inestimable treasure .
‘ The pang , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ of consigning a child , even to you , my dear <NAME> , is one of the most excruciating imaginable , and combined with a naturally delicate constitution , and the extreme stupidity of the pastry-cook who has undertaken the breakfast , is almost too much for my poor strength .
And <NAME> , '' says <NAME> , opening his arms , `` here 's children too !
In the capital of the <NAME> ’ s name and dignity , such a child was merely a piece of base coin that couldn ’ t be invested -- a bad Boy -- nothing more .
I am invested with no authority for diverging from them .
“ D -- n it all , sir ! ” said <NAME> , staring at him , “ am I not eligible ? ” “ Oh dear yes !
I swear it before the God that saw it !
‘ You ’ re coming to yourself again now. ’ ‘ -- As a matter of business , ’ pursued <NAME> , speaking slowly and firmly , as a man who has made up his mind to say no more , ‘ because I thought she might make some impression on the silly youth you have taken in hand and
Perhaps with an eye to first impressions , Mr <NAME> was very carefully and trimly dressed , that morning .
It brought a vague expression of dissatisfaction into Mr <NAME> ’ s face ; but the door being opened , it was quickly gone .
But my understanding for all this was gone .
Is it not a fact , <NAME> , that you have just now been unable to command your feelings even before me , whose eyes you had so completely closed ? ’ ‘ I have made no complaint , ’ sobbed <NAME> .
There ’ s a Mausoleum down at my place , in the park , but I ’ m afraid it ’ s in bad repair , and , in point of fact , in a devil of a state .
It had no set beginning , as <NAME> , or <NAME> , or <NAME> , or <NAME> , but ran thus : -- “ I am to come to <NAME> the day after to-morrow by the midday coach .
We changed again , and yet again , and it was now too late and too far to go back , and I went on .
With these words , he took a thick stick from <NAME> 's hands , who , having delivered another to <NAME> , busied himself in fastening on <NAME> 's cape .
I was on the wrong side of the post .
said <NAME> , clapping him on the shoulder with an air of protection that had something serious in it , though he laughed .
Having dismissed his attendant , and seen the box safely deposited in the coach-office , he looked into the coffee-room in search of <NAME> .
'If your inclinations chime with your sense of duty -- ' <NAME> began .
He rarely joined them on the Saturdays now .
But I held to it , and the harder it was , the stronger I held , for I was determined , and my mind firm made up .
It arrested his attention , and he sat pausing over it , until he took off the rusty colourless wisp that he wore round his throat , and substituted the red neckerchief , leaving the long ends flowing .
I felt as if I had been living in a palace of cards , which had tumbled down , leaving only <NAME> and me among the ruins ; I felt as if some grim enchanter had drawn a magic circle round the innocent goddess of my heart , which nothing indeed but those same strong pinions , capable of carrying
<NAME> E. S. <NAME> was nominated and supported by <NAME> .
I suppose I expressed it , somehow ; for after she had looked at me attentively for a little while , she appeared to understand , and replied in a low tone : ‘ I know you will do as I ask you , if I tell you I am very earnest in it .
‘ Not at all so. ’ ‘ She is a tiresome creature , ’ said <NAME> , pouting .
He does not know it ; we must go to him from here , to tell him of it .
‘ You have got good measure , <NAME> ; but the price is not so bad. -- And you , ’ said <NAME> , turning to the other visitor , ‘ do you buy anything here , miss ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , sir. ’ ‘ Nor sell anything neither , miss ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , sir. ’ Looking
Now , brother Ned , my dear fellow , I ’ m ready .
‘ You have purposely cast a dreadful suspicion upon my mother ’ s house .
Do you believe there is any chance of her consent , to balance against the outrage it would be to her ( loving dear old lady ! )
First , not a word more from you about the past .
said the board , looking very knowing ; 'we are the fellows to set this to rights ; we 'll stop it all , in no time . '
I am almost sure he will grant it now , if I ask him .
His features were contracted into a perpetual smile ; and his teeth were in such perfect order that it was difficult at a small distance to tell the real from the false .
It appeared to be something droll , for occasionally there was a laugh and a cry of `` Silence ! ''
I hope I may not be so unlucky as to make you think I mean to offend you again , for I never have meant to offend you yet , when I say I don ’ t understand it. ’ ‘ Sir , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ will you have the perfidy to deny that you know and long
‘ Do you mean that a prisoner forgives his prison ? ’ said she , slowly and with emphasis .
Every possible inquiry was made , and every place was searched .
I am the Relieving Officer appointed by eternal ordinance to do my work ; I am not held in estimation according as I shirk it .
My Lady , with a disdainful gesture of the hand that holds the screen , assures him of his being worth no complaint from her .
He tried to shut it out , but it would stream in .
‘ But we must think of dear Pa , ’ said <NAME> ; ‘ I haven ’ t told dear Pa ; let us speak to Pa. ’ Upon which they turned to do so .
I do n't care for what you say at all .
‘ Yes , ’ said <NAME> ; ‘ but that ’ s nothin ’ if we could find out the young ‘ ooman ; ’ and here <NAME> , with many digressions upon the personal beauty of <NAME> , and the unspeakable tortures he had experienced since he last saw her , gave a faithful account of <NAME> ’ s
He was altogether too unsettled in his mind over it , to appreciate it comfortably I thought , or to have anybody to dine with him , without making a chop with his jaws at the visitor .
`` Much obliged to you , ma'am ! ''
On a table by the window in <NAME> , we set out the work <NAME> procured for him -- which was to make , I forget how many copies of a legal document about some right of way -- and on another table we spread the last unfinished original of the great Memorial .
A little later on in the dinner , <NAME> reviewed the sermon with some severity , and intimated -- in the usual hypothetical case of the Church being “ thrown open ” -- what kind of sermon he would have given them .
There is no other message to send , I thank you , dear papa , that it would be at all agreeable to you to take. ’ They parted in an outer drawing-room , where only Mr <NAME> waited on his lady , and dutifully bided his time for shaking hands .
<NAME> tumbrils carry the day 's wine to <NAME> .
But having risked discovery by venturing here at all , I should have been glad to track some part of the way. ’ With which singular words he abandoned his search , came up out of <NAME> , and took the way past <NAME> .
Do I know , without being very wise , where you would like to go , direct from these walls and from this room ? ’ ‘ You do , ’ returned <NAME> .
The visit did not originate with him. ’ ‘ He had some conversation with the poor man .
It struck me as being not at all like the manner or appearance of a man who had advanced in life by the usual road of years , cares , and experiences .
With all those yearnings , and gushings , and impulsive throbbings that we have implanted in our souls , and which are so very charming , why are we not more natural ? ’ Mr <NAME> said it was very true , very true .
They suggested one distinct idea to her , for she said with her placid smile , and shaking her head , `` My good <NAME> , at half the cost , this weak child might have been equipped for <NAME> ! ''
I am quite sure , if you will let me say so , that the object of your choice would greatly prefer to follow your fortunes far and wide , however moderate or poor , and see you happy , doing your duty and pursuing your chosen way , than to have the hope of being , or even to
Mr Toots and his wife had , in fact , just arrived there ; having been at the <NAME> ’ s to seek him , and having there obtained the address .
‘ When are you at home ? ’ ‘ When you like. ’ ‘ Breakfast-time ? ’ said <NAME> , in her abruptest and shortest manner .
I have , in my possession , in his hand and pocket-book , several similar imitations of <NAME> ’ s signature , here and there defaced by fire , but legible to anyone .
<NAME> as it is in a large city to avoid the suspicion of being watched , when the mind is conscious of danger in that regard , I could not persuade myself that any of the people within sight cared about my movements .
One said she lived in the <NAME> , and had singed her whiskers by doing so ; another , that she was made fast to the great buoy outside the harbour , and could only be visited at half-tide ; a third , that she was locked up in <NAME> jail for child-stealing ; a fourth , that she was
I don ’ t mind telling you , <NAME> , although I ’ m dreadful jealous by nature -- horrid -- that the lady is in this house. ’ Here <NAME> took off his spectacles , on purpose to wink , and then put them on again .
She never left him all that night .
It is a pleasant thing to reflect that one did one ’ s duty by him. ’ <NAME> smiled , as if he meant anything but smiling , and looked round at the strangers present .
Do not keep me here , but let me go at once .
‘ <NAME> and unreservedly no ? ’ ‘ Yes. ’ ‘ Fledgeby , my hand. ’ Mr <NAME> took it , saying , ‘ And if we ever find out who did this , we ’ ll mark that person .
He did everything for me except the household work , for which he had engaged a very decent woman , after paying off the laundress on his first arrival .
I never thought of it , before or afterwards .
‘ Would you have any objection to write down to <NAME> , and ask this favour of <NAME> ?
Let me whisper in your ear . '
I have not inquired among my medical acquaintance , whether <NAME> , and cold Punch , with <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , and all the slight et cetera usually included in an unlimited order for a good dinner—especially when it is left to the liberal construction of my faultless friend , <NAME> , of the <NAME> Hotel—are peculiarly
<NAME> , seated at an open window with her arm upon its cushioned ledge and looking out at the evening shadows falling on the park , has seemed to attend since the lawyer 's name was mentioned .
I had barely time to get down again before the coach started , and I could hardly see the family for the handkerchiefs they waved .
'Bill , ' cried the girl , striving to lay her head upon his breast , 'the gentleman and that dear lady , told me to-night of a home in some foreign country where I could end my days in solitude and peace .
There was a beautiful propriety in that .
Further , he became particular in his attentions to the ladies ; and dancing with <NAME> , whispered to her -- whispered to her ! -- though not so softly but that <NAME> heard him say this remarkable poetry , ‘ Had I a heart for falsehood framed , I ne ’ er could injure You ! ’ This ,
She was an old lady in a large cap , with rather a red nose and rather an unsteady eye , but smiling all over .
How much ? ’ He turned upon her suddenly with a menacing gesture of the weighted hand that clenched the money , as if he were going to strike her with it .
God bless you , dear Mr Clennam .
‘ Never ! ’ <NAME> confirmed the assertion with an oath , and then laughed again , when of course the boy ( who thought his companion one of the most dashing fellows alive ) laughed also .
“ You are a good man and a true friend , ” said <NAME> , in an altered voice .
A tributary stream of confusion , moreover , poured in from an adjoining bedroom , where Mr F. ’ s <NAME> appeared , from the sound of her voice , to be in a horizontal posture , awaiting her breakfast ; and from which bower that inexorable lady snapped off short taunts , whenever she could get a hearing ,
That hope deferred , which , ( as the <NAME> very correctly tells us , Mr Dombey would have added in a patronising way ; for his highest distinct idea even of <NAME> , if examined , would have been found to be ; that as forming part of a general whole , of which <NAME> and <NAME> formed another
In that branch of it , which is devoted to the reception of old or otherwise helpless paupers , these words are <NAME> , <NAME> BLESSINGS. ’ It is not assumed and taken for granted that being there they must be evil-disposed and wicked people , before whose vicious eyes it is necessary to flourish threats and harsh restraints .
Wretched marriages don ’ t come of such things , in our degree ; only wretchedness and ruin .
Oh , pray see if he is hurt. ’ ‘ He is not , I assure you , ’ replied <NAME> , handling the object of his surprise , after this appeal , with sudden tenderness and respect .
‘ He sleeps sound , ’ he said within himself ; ‘ yet he ’ s that up to me and that noticing of me that my getting out of my chair may wake him , when a rattling peal won ’ t ; let alone my touching of him. ’ He very cautiously rose to his feet .
I say , he struck me .
‘ Then the sooner you go the better. ’ With these instructions , <NAME> placed a sum of money in the hands of his faithful servitor , and ordered him to start for <NAME> immediately , in pursuit of the fugitive .
Although <NAME> said this with sufficient ill-humour , he did not seem to feel himself quite at liberty to remain silent ; for , after stretching himself very often , and declaring with a shiver that it was ‘ infernal cold , ’ he made an experiment at the breakfast-table , and proving more successful in it than his less-seasoned
‘ <NAME> said I wasn ’ t to , because people wouldn ’ t believe the attendance was good if they saw how small I was first. ’ ‘ Well , but they ’ ll see how small you are afterwards , won ’ t they ? ’ said <NAME> .
'It 's a nasty trade , ' said <NAME> , when <NAME> had again stated his wish .
I ’ ve never took charity yet , nor yet has any one belonging to me .
<NAME> played the piano to him , sat by him , and worked and talked , and played some games at dominoes with me .
‘ Nor pass it over to me ? ’ ‘ That would be the same thing .
Is there any other order , sir , that I can take a note of , besides this little matter of Mr <NAME> ? ’ ‘ None , ’ replied the dwarf , seizing the saucepan .
`` And oh , miss , '' says <NAME> , clapping her hands , with the tears starting down her dimpled cheeks , `` <NAME> 's at school , if you please , and learning so good !
Why , he ’ s an uglier-looking thief than can be seen anywhere for a penny .
By degrees I learnt , and chiefly from <NAME> , that <NAME> had been educated at <NAME> and at <NAME> , where he had distinguished himself ; but that when he had had the happiness of marrying Mrs. Pocket very early in life , he had impaired his prospects and taken up the calling of a Grinder .
They may be of the same blood , but , believe me , they are not of the same nature. ” Still looking at me keenly , <NAME> repeated , -- “ What do you want for them ? ” “ I am not so cunning , you see , ” I said , in answer , conscious that I
In an official manager of these displays much celebrated for his platform tactics , <NAME> recognised ( in a suit of black ) the counterpart of a deceased benefactor of his species , an eminent public character , once known to fame as Frosty-faced Fogo , who in days of yore superintended the formation of the magic circle with the

‘ It ’ s a dreadful trial to a father ’ s feelin ’ s , that ‘ ere , <NAME> -- ’ ‘ Nonsense , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ That woman , <NAME> , ’ said the Major , ‘ is , in her way , a Lucifer .

The laws of the <NAME> forbid their working more than nine months in the year , and require that they be educated during the other three .
When he had gone a little way , he looked back .
After that I occupied myself in making our room a little tidy and in coaxing a very cross fire that had been lighted to burn , which at last it did , quite brightly .
Has he been here , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Here , in this room .
‘ <NAME> , you sir ! ’ said <NAME> , for the third time .
In their orderly and punctual progress they brought round <NAME> and twilight .

As soon as they were established in their new residence , and her father had entered on the routine of his avocations , she arranged the little household as exactly as if her husband had been there .
Can I ever forget ? ’ ‘ As you were then , my sister , I have often thought since , you have ever been to me .
All <NAME> ’ s interest is to stick well to the story he has told ; and all his risk is , to depart from it in the least .
To have committed no fault , and yet to be so entirely alone in the world ; to be separated from the only persons he loved , and to be proscribed like a criminal , when six months ago he had been surrounded by every comfort , and looked up to , as the chief hope of his family --
It is divided into boxes , for the solitary confinement of travellers , and is furnished with a clock , a looking-glass , and a live waiter , which latter article is kept in a small kennel for washing glasses , in a corner of the apartment .
His eyes are then fixed upon her , she knows , though her own see nothing but the grass .
‘ I thought it wouldn ’ t be long , ’ said <NAME> , jumping up and producing a little basket from under the seat ; ‘ put what you haven ’ t had time to eat , in here , boys !
‘ I made an observation to my friend , sir , ’ replied <NAME> , always ready to enter into conversation .
'Do not think of that .
He lowered it , and passed a remark on the next change of the moon .
But I -- but I wish you had not watched me. ’ He understood the emotion with which she said it , to arise in her father ’ s behalf ; and he respected it , and was silent .
`` Why , my dear Minerva , '' answered <NAME> with his old gay laugh , `` it is neither a rural nor a cheerful place ; and when the sun shines here , you may lay a pretty heavy wager that it is shining brightly in an open spot .
<NAME> will see to your accommodation .
I just makes out to cry , “ I know you now !
‘ Only myself , ’ he assented with a sigh .
‘ Are my feathers so very much rumpled ? ’ said <NAME> , coolly going up to the looking-glass .
This is the young lady .
‘ Now , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , calmly feeling for his whisker , ‘ it won ’ t do .
It seems to me , at this hour , that I have never seen such sunlight as on those bright April afternoons ; that I have never seen such a sunny little figure as I used to see , sitting in the doorway of the old boat ; that I have never beheld such sky , such water , such

On a healthy autumn day , the <NAME> prisoner , weak but otherwise restored , sat listening to a voice that read to him .
He has a yellow look in the spectral darkness of a candle that has guttered down until the whole length of its wick ( still burning ) has doubled over and left a tower of winding-sheet above it .

She tore along the narrow pavement : elbowing the passengers from side to side ; and darting almost under the horses ' heads , crossed crowded streets , where clusters of persons were eagerly watching their opportunity to do the like .

Then kindness requires that I should n't go near them -- and I wo n't . ''
I mention the conquest in good time because I apprehend your scheme to be more important to you than your vanity. ’ There was a mirror on the wall before them , and her eyes just caught him smirking in it .
There was a stage , that evening , when she spoke collectedly of what had happened , though with a certain terrible vivacity .
‘ Off with you ! ’ The boys applied whip and spur , the waiters shouted , the hostlers cheered , and away they went , fast and furiously .
<NAME> is devoted to him .
‘ <NAME> , ’ said the lady , hurriedly , and looking into her face with great earnestness .
I am so sorry for it , I am so unwilling to believe it , I have tried so earnestly not to see it , that it is very hard to tell , even to you .
‘ You have said more than enough to him on business , before now .
‘ You are the dolls ’ dressmaker ? ’ ‘ I am the dolls ’ dressmaker , sir. ’ ‘ <NAME> ’ s friend ? ’ ‘ Yes , sir , ’ replied <NAME> , instantly on the defensive .
They did not so engross his attention , but that he saw , with gratitude , how the elder Mr Chivery kept the Lodge clear of prisoners ; how he signed to some , with his keys , not to come in , how he nudged others with his elbows to go out , and how he made his misery
Kiss me , Floy. ’ He had even a dislike , at such times , to the company of <NAME> , and was well pleased when she strolled away , as she generally did , to pick up shells and acquaintances .
Did you ever breed any Suffolk Punches yourself , sir ? ’ ‘ N-no , ’ I said , ‘ not exactly. ’ ‘ Here ’ s a gen ’ lm ’ n behind me , I ’ ll pound it , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ as has bred ‘ em by wholesale. ’ The gentleman spoken of was
Evidently in observance of their nightly custom , she put some bread before herself , and touched his glass with her lips ; but <NAME> saw she was troubled and took nothing .
It might cut somebody , by accident .
`` As to <NAME> , '' who , I may mention , found the wind much given , during this period , to stick in the east ; `` As to <NAME> , '' <NAME> would say to me , `` he is the finest fellow in the world , Esther !
You asked me if I could have perfect faith in you , and I said yes , and I meant it. ’ It did not escape <NAME> ’ s notice that he began to look triumphant .
If I was to try -- no matter whether on myself , on somebody else , or both -- any genteel mystifications , I should probably not succeed in them. ’ ‘ <NAME> , ’ returned the <NAME> , with an affable smile , but with the bloom on her cheeks standing out a little more vividly than usual as
We , who have no such optical powers , are better pleased to take our last parting look at the visionary companions of many solitary hours , when the brief sunshine of the world is blazing full upon them .
By the light of the fire he can be seen looking towards the moonlight .
<NAME> looked after him , but neither moved nor spoke for some time : when he broke what almost seemed the silence of stupefaction , by a scornful laugh .
<NAME> taught her , nobody stepped forward to help her , nobody cared for her. ’ ‘ Nobody ! ’ echoed the mother , pointing to herself , and striking her breast .
He was not only a very dexterous thief , but was notorious for his boldness and hardihood , and for the number of his previous convictions .
I looked back through two years of my own life—out of jail , prosperous , happy , surrounded by blessings , comforts , good fortune—and thought how wide a gap it was , and how long those two years passed in solitary captivity would have been .
Partly in remembrance of that , and partly in the hope of making money someday by the scheme , I took advantage of my position about you , and possessed myself of a hold upon you , which you would give half of all you have to know , and never can know but through me .
Is it your pleasure to take <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Ah ! ’ said Mr Boffin .
Not being able quite to make up his mind about it , he consulted the <NAME> -- without taking that gentleman into his confidence ; merely informing him that a friend in <NAME> had written to him ( Mr Toots ) for his opinion on such a question .
‘ There may be , in the coffee-room. ’ MAY BE .
'What business is it of yours ? '
The tail of <NAME> 's eye becomes conscious of the head of Mrs. Snagsby looking in at the shop-door to know what he means by deserting his tea .
I have only just come to a decision to take one .
`` This , '' said <NAME> , `` is my Beauty daughter , <NAME> -- plays and sings odds and ends like her father .
‘ <NAME> ! ’ said <NAME> , clearing his throat , and warming with the punch and with the fire .
The fellow sends a most abandoned villain with one eye to construct a gateway .
Was it outside the house at present ockypied , to its disgrace , by that minion of fortune and worm of the hour , ’ said <NAME> , falling back upon his strongest terms of reprobation , and slapping the counter , ‘ that I , <NAME> , five hundred times the man he ever was , sat in all

`` I declare to you , <NAME> , that with anything short of this case that I have , I would as soon have hoped to root up by means of my own strength and my own hands the oldest tree on this estate as to shake your hold upon <NAME> and <NAME> 's trust and confidence in you .
‘ Not to any stranger , ma ’ am , ’ said the good lady ; ‘ but she has been a companion to me for some years .

At first , none but the surgeon went close to it .
'He is a child of a noble nature and a warm heart , ' said <NAME> , colouring ; 'and that <NAME> which has thought fit to try him beyond his years , has planted in his breast affections and feelings which would do honour to many who have numbered his days six times over . '
He held her , almost as if she were sanctified to him by death , and kissed her , once , almost as he might have kissed the dead .
‘ Now let us see , ’ said <NAME> .
When her husband was brought in , she turned a look upon him , so sustaining , so encouraging , so full of admiring love and pitying tenderness , yet so courageous for his sake , that it called the healthy blood into his face , brightened his glance , and animated his heart .
He looked at the work upon the table , and praised the industry and speed of Mrs. Cratchit and the girls .
I had seen tears in her eyes when I had brought new honours home from school , and I had seen them there when we last spoke about her father , and I had seen her turn her gentle head aside when we took leave of one another ; but I had never seen her grieve like this .
<NAME> and hours , days and nights , he remained in this same condition .
He is my only relation in the world , <NAME> , and unless you plead for me , I fear I have lost even him .

‘ Is there nothing I can do ? ’ asked <NAME> .
<NAME> was very full of it ; and said , that , picturing himself with such a home , and <NAME> waiting and preparing for him , he could think of nothing wanting to complete his bliss .
‘ He ’ ll do , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ though it ain ’ t what I call him. ’ The servant inquired if they had any appointment ?
If in my knowledge of THE secret I do what I can to spare an innocent girl ( especially , remembering your own reference to her when you told my story to the assembled guests at <NAME> ) from the taint of my impending shame , I act upon a resolution I have taken .
“ If you hear in my voice -- I do n't know that it is so , but I hope it is -- if you hear in my voice any resemblance to a voice that once was sweet music in your ears , weep for it , weep for it !
‘ On my Me -- on my fallen life ! ’ returned the other , in the same low voice , but with a deeper stress on his words than he had yet seemed capable of giving them .
His being my lawyer , and his being the lawyer of your patron is a coincidence .
God send that old nursery tales were true , and that gypsies stole such children by the score !
A murmur of voices had been audible on the outside , and , at the moment of our entrance , a clapping of hands : which latter noise , I was surprised to see , proceeded from the generally disconsolate Mrs. Gummidge .
And I tell you another thing , <NAME> , '' says <NAME> , who has suddenly lowered his voice and become familiar again , `` he 's an extraordinary old chap -- always rummaging among a litter of papers and grubbing away at teaching himself to read and write , without getting on a bit , as it seems to

So I reversed my previous answer , and sat down to dinner in ten minutes afterwards ; and a capital dinner it was .
He was a morose , savage-hearted , bad man ; idle and dissolute in his habits ; cruel and ferocious in his disposition .
But that ain ’ t much to me , for I don ’ t think I shall stop with him long. ’ ‘ Not stop in your place , <NAME> ! ’ cried his mother ; while Mr <NAME> opened his eyes .
Sitting beside him , I made a pretence of working for my dear , as he had always been used to joke about my being busy .
‘ Did I indeed , sir ? ’ said <NAME> .
You see I know enough to know much more with very little help .
We may never meet again. ’ ‘ In our course through life we shall meet the people who are coming to meet _us_ , from many strange places and by many strange roads , ’ was the composed reply ; ‘ and what it is set to us to do to them , and what it is set to them

She was afraid to look at him much , after the offence he had taken ; but she noticed two occasions in the course of his meal , when he all of a sudden looked at her , and looked about him , as if the association were so strong that he needed assurance from his sense of sight that
‘ Keep your mouth shut ! -- I want to know , you sir , whether you charge that there crime on <NAME> ? ’ ‘ If you ever do know , you won ’ t know now. ’ ‘ Perhaps you done it yourself ? ’ said <NAME> , with a threatening action .
As to what is dearer to you than life , nothing can be so dear to a good citizen as the Republic. ” Loud acclamations hailed this rebuke .
The decent hair-guard that went round his neck and took care of his decent silver watch was an object of envy to her .
It ’ s HIS daughter , is it ? ’ Naturally as this was said , it was not said so naturally but that a kindred spirit like old <NAME> might have discerned a design upon the part of <NAME> to lead him on to much more explicit statements and explanations than he would have volunteered , or that <NAME>
I knew he always read at that hour , and as I drew near I saw the light shining out into the passage from his reading-lamp .
The cheering thought that he was labouring on where <NAME> had just toiled before him , would , of itself , have been a stimulant to <NAME> in the perpetual resumption of his studies ; but coupled with the actual lightening of his load , consequent on this assistance , it saved him , possibly , from sinking underneath the

Many ears and eyes were busy with a vision of the matter of these placards , among turning spindles , rattling looms , and whirling wheels , for hours afterwards ; and when the <NAME> cleared out again into the streets , there were still as many readers as before .
When he did throw his head back , and take it off quick , I had a horrible fear , I confess , of seeing him meet the fate of the lamented <NAME> , and fall lifeless on the carpet .

She ran in , and was running out again when she saw me .
<NAME> remember what I said to you .
But the sad scene she had witnessed , was not without its lesson of content and gratitude ; of content with the lot which left her health and freedom ; and gratitude that she was spared to the one relative and friend she loved , and to live and move in a beautiful world , when so many young creatures

'By all means , ' observed <NAME> , with great alacrity .
laughed the same woman , when old <NAME> , producing a flannel bag with money in it , told out their several gains upon the ground .
I see he is listening , but can ’ t hear .
<NAME> was in attendance , and loitered about until the expected train came in .
Theerfur ‘ tan ’ t my intentions to moor <NAME> ‘ long with them , but to find a <NAME> ’ fur her wheer she can fisherate for herself. ’ ( A <NAME> ’ signifies , in that dialect , a home , and to fisherate is to provide . )
‘ How very odd you are to-day , my dear !
`` That 's very like <NAME> , '' says <NAME> .
And <NAME> , the audacious creature who presumed , even in the dimmest and remotest distance of her imagination , to conjure up the degrading picture , ‘ I am a ’ most inclined , ’ said <NAME> , bursting with the fulness of her anger and the weakness of her means of revenge , ‘ to turn atheist when
‘ Well , ’ returned Mr Boffin , ‘ if I am , that ’ s my business .
‘ As to our being a pack of thieves , <NAME> , ’ said the man , as he spat out some blood , and wiped more from his face ; ‘ you know better than that at midday .
Mrs Meagles , the blithest and busiest of mothers , went about singing and cheering everybody ; but she , honest soul , had her flights into store rooms , where she would cry until her eyes were red , and would then come out , attributing that appearance to pickled onions and pepper , and singing clearer than ever
How could it be otherwise ?
And he did it ; yes , he did !
<NAME> <NAME> ( of <NAME> Salem-House <NAME> , <NAME> ) presided , and on his right sat the distinguished guest .
`` Why , what do you mean ? ''
It is not usual to cancel articles for any such reason .
But it took a bit of time to get it well round , the change come so oncommon plump ; did n't it ? ” Somehow , I was not best pleased with <NAME> 's being so mightily secure of me .
He put on his hat and walked quickly down the garden , determined to investigate the matter to the very bottom .
You ’ re quite right to mention it. ’ ‘ I beg your pardon , <NAME> , ’ faltered <NAME> , ‘ but we go out quite plenty Sir , thank you. ’ ‘ What would you have then ? ’ asked Mr Dombey .
Among the loungers under the <NAME> 's archway happened to be <NAME> 's Boy , -- true to his ancient habit of happening to be everywhere where he had no business , -- and <NAME> 's boy had seen me passing from <NAME> 's in the direction of my dining-place .
To hear him laugh and see the broad good nature of his face then , one might have supposed that he had not a care in the world , or a dispute , or a dislike , but that his whole existence was a summer joke .
I say “ ever since , ” as if I had been here a week .
How much have I to be thankful for , in <NAME> ’ s kind intention to give me my articles , which would otherwise not lay within the umble means of mother and self ! ’ ‘ Then , when your articled time is over , you ’ ll be a regular lawyer , I suppose ? ’ said I
I have no lover , of course .
Fifty thousand lairs surrounded him where people lived so unwholesomely that fair water put into their crowded rooms on Saturday night , would be corrupt on Sunday morning ; albeit my lord , their county member , was amazed that they failed to sleep in company with their butcher ’ s meat .
‘ He is only glad to see me .
He was so lavish of this condescension , that he not only bowed to her , in a particular manner , on several occasions , but even entrusted such stately recognitions of her to his sister as ‘ pray tell your friend , <NAME> , that she is very good , ’ or ‘ mention to <NAME> , <NAME> ,
Mr <NAME> said , or rather twitched out of himself in small pieces by the shirt-collar , that <NAME> having completely used up her place in the country , and also her house at <NAME> , and being , of course , unable , don ’ t you see , to remain in <NAME> when there wasn ’ t a
<NAME> was thinking , with a sneer upon his lips , on the altered manner of <NAME> that day , and how soon their fellowship in a bad design had lowered his pride and established a familiarity between them , when his attentive ear caught the rustling of a female dress upon the stairs , and the footstep of a
‘ This fellow -- I grieve to say my brother ’ s son : a reprobate and profligate , stained with every mean and selfish crime -- this fellow , coming here today to disturb a solemn ceremony , and knowing that the consequence of his presenting himself in another man ’ s house at such a time , and
No matter that it was utterly irreconcilable with the nature of things and course of events that the wretched honourable gentleman could possibly produce a Precedent for this -- <NAME> would nevertheless thank the honourable gentleman for that ironical cheer , and would close with him upon that issue , and would tell him to his teeth that there Was
Not long before , I had read in the newspapers , how a gentleman unknown had come to the <NAME> in the night , and had gone to bed , and had destroyed himself , and had been found in the morning weltering in blood .
<NAME> , thrusting Mr Flintwinch aside , proceeded straight up-stairs .
He returned to where he had stood before -- advanced a pace -- another -- another still .
<NAME> , astonishment , indignation , and a storm of passions , rushed through the listener ’ s heart , as the plot was laid bare .
I needn ’ t tell you , <NAME> , that I am under great obligations to Mr Headstone , and that I am very anxious for Mr Headstone to succeed in all he undertakes .
‘ Why this is indeed a joy I had not looked for ! ’ said Mrs. Crummles , when <NAME> was presented .
If this be real , and her allotted time be not yet come , wake , <NAME> , wake !
‘ You won ’ t see such boys as those very often , I think , ’ said Mr Crummles .
There was not much to amuse in the room ; of which the most attractive feature was , a half-length portrait in oil , of <NAME> , whom the artist had depicted scratching his head in an easy manner , and thus displaying to advantage a diamond ring , the gift of <NAME> before her marriage .
`` Talk of the angels , '' says <NAME> .
Not caring to go too near the door , until the appointed time , <NAME> crouched into an angle of the wall , and awaited its arrival .
said the girl , with an expression of pleasure at his return .
At those times I used to think , how should I ever tell the two remaining babies that the baby who had learned of her faithful heart to be a mother to them in their need was dead !
There was duty to be done , and it was done , but not harshly .
‘ Stay a moment , <NAME> ; stay another moment .
‘ Are you sure it is ? ’ ‘ Of course I am ! ’ ‘ I have forgotten , ’ said <NAME> , still turning the button round and round , ‘ what relation <NAME> is to you , you dear bad boy. ’ ‘ No blood-relation , ’ I replied ; ‘ but we were brought up together
I actually thought more than once that he ’ d have sunk under ‘ em ; I did , indeed. ’ Here <NAME> shook his head and paused ; on which , the elder <NAME> , nudging his neighbour , as begging him to mark the attorney ’ s high connections , asked whether the duties in question produced any
When the <NAME> had finished her toasting , she spread a clean cloth on a tray , and brought him some crisp slices and a great basin of weak tea , with which ( she said ) the doctor had left word he might refresh himself when he awoke .
‘ What ’ s the matter , ma ’ am ? ’ said <NAME> ; ‘ you don ’ t see a Fire , do you ? ’ ‘ Oh dear no , sir , ’ returned Mrs. Sparsit , ‘ I was thinking of the dew. ’ ‘ What have you got to do with the dew , ma
The performance seemed a little long to <NAME> and <NAME> , particularly when it stopped to afford the Clown an opportunity of telling <NAME> ( who said ‘ Indeed , sir ! ’ to all his observations in the calmest way , and with his eye on the house ) about two legs sitting on three legs looking at one
Something of distrust lingered about him still ; for he would often come , even in the dark evenings , and call in a timid voice outside the door to know if she were safe within ; and being answered yes , and bade to enter , would take his station on a low stool at her feet , and
‘ You know what I mean , do you , <NAME> ? ’ inquired <NAME> , looking hard at him , through the spectacles .
I ’ m glad he has lost his mistress .
<NAME> steam , tide , wind , and horses , all abate their speed , to linger on such happiness ?
He has had a fever .
“ Indeed I am lost here .
But it may be true. ” “ If it is -- ” <NAME> began , and stopped .
To return to the letter .
<NAME> ’ t tell me that that handsome child has been in the habit of prowling about as she ’ s done these last two or three days .
Each doing what she suggested , there was no want of assistance .
`` <NAME> , my dear , '' she would say , and always with some emotion , for with her lofty pedigree she had a very affectionate heart , `` was descended from a great <NAME> family , the <NAME> of <NAME> .
`` Sir , I have told you why .
This being purely a labour of love , <NAME> readily complied , and leaving the room for the purpose , almost immediately returned , supporting a sleek personage with an oily face , who , bursting from him , and giving to view the form and face of <NAME> , made straight up to <NAME> , and tucking that poor
When he looked out from his shelter in the distance , and saw that I waved my hat to him to come up , he rejoined me , and there we waited ; sometimes lying on the bank , wrapped in our coats , and sometimes moving about to warm ourselves , until we saw our boat coming round .
‘ The friendliness of this gentleman , ’ said <NAME> to my aunt , ‘ if you will allow me , ma ’ am , to cull a figure of speech from the vocabulary of our coarser national sports -- floors me .
‘ I don ’ t like it , Mr Venus .
Do you recollect him ? ’ No .
They were very fond of one another : that was certain .
<NAME> , my boy ! ’ He was so perfectly satisfied both with his quotation and his reference to it , that he could not help repeating the words again in a low voice , and saying he had forgotten ‘ em these forty year .
There must be many ways of doing it .
Be good enough to pinch him , sir -- in the leg , if you please ; nothing else wakes him -- thank you .
It at once reduced <NAME> to begging , as a special favour , to be allowed to say what Mrs. <NAME> was most curious to hear .
and gave my little basket of housekeeping keys such a shake that they sounded like little bells and rang me hopefully to bed .
`` I am to remain on this gaudy platform on which my miserable deception has been so long acted , and it is to fall beneath me when you give the signal ? ''
‘ I never threshed a boy in a hackney coach before , ’ said <NAME> , when he stopped to rest .
<NAME> , who would not have smiled for the world , replied composedly : ‘ But you are a very good penman , sir .
Other men 's fathers may have died of the rheumatism or may have taken base contagion from the tainted blood of the sick vulgar , but the <NAME> family have communicated something exclusive even to the levelling process of dying by dying of their own family gout .
The person on the sofa , who appeared to have a cold in his head , gave such a very loud snort that he startled me .
If I were but legally executor of <NAME> ’ s will !
And as to the brim of his hat , it ’ s narrow .
That 's my mother. ” “ Oh ! ” said he , coming back .
He seems fully determined to drop down ; don ’ t he ? ’ Mr <NAME> opined that such was clearly his intention .
Notwithstanding an unusual flow of company , the master of the wine-shop was not visible .
how much brighter and more deeply blue , glowing and rich though it had been before , was the scene without , contrasting with the darkness of so many youthful lives within !
Give me your hand , <NAME> , give me your hand. ’ <NAME> gave it ; but Mr <NAME> had driven his heart out of it , and nothing could change his face now , from its white , shocked look .
‘ About getting that customer that we paid the ten shillings in the pound to the bill- discounter for , on your account -- to get him out of the <NAME> , you know -- about getting him to Demerara. ’ ‘ Oh , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> hastily .
And now the bell -- the bell she had so often heard , by night and day , and listened to with solemn pleasure almost as a living voice -- rung its remorseless toll , for her , so young , so beautiful , so good .
It brought a great many boxes , which were bumped and tossed upon the roof , almost as painfully as if they had been deposited on one ’ s own head , without the intervention of a porter ’ s knot ; and several damp gentlemen , whose clothes , on their drawing round the stove , began to steam
`` You will excuse me , <NAME> , '' observes <NAME> .
But she 's patienter than others would be , and is clever too , and always willing , up to the full mark of her strength and over .
After darkly looking at his leg and me several times , he came closer to my tombstone , took me by both arms , and tilted me back as far as he could hold me ; so that his eyes looked most powerfully down into mine , and mine looked most helplessly up into his .
My Lady merely waves her off with indifference , saying , `` There , there , child !
With a good deal more of that sort , which I wondered how they knew .
<NAME> <NAME> then once again dropped off to sleep , with a confused consciousness that <NAME> was still engaged in relating a long story , the chief point of which appeared to be that , on some occasion particularly stated and set forth , he had ‘ done ’ a bill and a gentleman at the same time .
‘ I am not complaining , ’ he returned , ‘ I am only stating the case .
'If he had , ' said <NAME> , 'the dog 'ud want to lead us away to where he did it .
He sat quietly looking at her ; but , with these appendages partially revealing themselves , and with a quantity of bristling oakum-coloured head and whisker , he had a formidable appearance .
‘ This is very kind of you , <NAME> ’ r <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ It ’ s below stairs , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , and he ran down after it .
It passed rapidly , as may be supposed , to one entranced as I was ; and yet it gave me so many occasions for knowing <NAME> better , and admiring him more in a thousand respects , that at its close I seemed to have been with him for a much longer time .
<NAME> , the adult pupils were taught to read ( if they could learn ) out of the <NAME> Testament ; and by dint of stumbling over the syllables and keeping their bewildered eyes on the particular syllables coming round to their turn , were as absolutely ignorant of the sublime history , as if they had never seen or
When it got so high , it got the upper hand of me , but this is how I always know there 's a eight in it . ''
There was another blank silence before her father rejoined : “ I believe it .
But at that instant the conversation , whatever it was , which had been carrying on near this fire was resumed , and the tones of the voice that spoke -- she could not distinguish words -- sounded as familiar to her as her own .
<NAME> <NAME> , satisfied , expresses high approval and awaits her coming at the door .
`` If , sir , '' she begins , `` in my knowledge of my secret -- '' But he interrupts her .
‘ In such good spirits ! ’ said <NAME> .
As haggard and as shabby , as if , for want of custom , it had itself taken to drinking , and had gone the way all drunkards go , and was very near the end of it .
I thought of it much afterwards .
<NAME> ! ’ The form moved , rose , advanced , and dropped upon its knees at his feet .
And as the boy hurried away with his hand to his head , singing quite a different sort of tune , <NAME> chuckled very heartily to himself , and entered the churchyard , locking the gate behind him .
You will have to get the better of that objection , <NAME> , and to accustom yourself to it very probably on many similar occasions ; unless you adopt the remedy which is in your own hands , of giving me no cause of complaint .
All others he was willing to forget .
‘ Ma , ’ interposed the young lady , ‘ I must say I think it would be much better if you would keep to the point , and not hold forth about people ’ s flying into people ’ s faces , which is nothing more nor less than impossible nonsense. ’ ‘ How ! ’ exclaimed <NAME> ,
“ Dear boy , ” he said , as I sat down by his bed : “ I thought you was late .
<NAME> <NAME> was suspected , with three companions .
I know she ’ s a naughty , mischief-making old thing !

You don ’ t come in here , ’ said <NAME> ’ s better-half , interposing her person , which was a robust one , in the doorway .
If the mistress put such a construction upon the behaviour of her new friends , what could the companion urge against them ?
‘ Take that hat up again. ’ But this Sam flatly and positively refused to do ; and , after he had been severely reprimanded by his master , the officer , being in a hurry , condescended to pick it up himself , venting a great variety of threats against <NAME> meanwhile , which that gentleman received with perfect
Mellers it , is the word I should employ , Mr Boffin. ’ His wooden conceit and craft kept exact pace with the delighted expectation of his victim .
‘ I said that it was better as it is ! ’ she whispers , as she holds me in her arms .
He wants the stick , now and then : it 'll do him good ; and his board need n't come very expensive , for he has n't been overfed since he was born .
Very often afterwards , in the midst of their talk , he would break off , to try to understand what it was that the waves were always saying ; and would rise up in his couch to look towards that invisible region , far away .
I beg your pardon , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , rushing up to him , ‘ but I ’ m happy to say it ’ s all right , <NAME> .
It ’ s the parting from her old playfellow and friend -- her favourite cousin -- that has done this .
Would you recommend his being spoken to , or his being left alone ?
said I , with my eyes filling fast ; but I thought they might , when it was not for myself .
At first I was painfully awake and vainly tried to lose myself , with my eyes closed , among the scenes of the day .
He has also one or two large scars on his back and hips. ’ ‘ Detained at the jail , a mulatto , named <NAME> .

The board being now clear of the more substantial articles of food , and punch , wine , and spirits being placed upon it and handed about , the guests , who had been previously conversing in little groups of three or four , gradually fell off into a dead silence , while the majority of those present glanced from
I have seen him so terrify a client or a witness by ceremoniously unfolding this pocket-handkerchief as if he were immediately going to blow his nose , and then pausing , as if he knew he should not have time to do it before such client or witness committed himself , that the <NAME> has followed directly , quite as
So I wagged , and hid myself , and that began it. ’ ‘ And you mean to tell me , ’ said Mr Carker , taking him by the throat again , holding him out at arm ’ s-length , and surveying him in silence for some moments , ‘ that you want a place , do you ?
It being now the afternoon in the—College—of which you are the eminent head , the young ladies might gain nothing , except in name , by having the rest of the day allowed them .
These were proud times for Mrs Nickleby ; never was anybody half so discreet and sage as she , or half so mysterious withal ; and never were there such cunning generalship , and such unfathomable designs , as she brought to bear upon <NAME> , with the view of ascertaining whether her suspicions were well founded : and if
A lady of your sense and strength of character will be prepared for my now declaring it void and taking my own course . ''
I did lose money before , certainly , but it doesn ’ t quite follow that he took it .
I was fluttered by her being unexpectedly so near ( she was almost within speaking distance before I knew her ) and would have risen to continue my walk .
‘ I saw nothing of him , ’ answered <NAME> ; ‘ but I saw that dear old soul <NAME> Linkinwater. ’ ‘ Taking his evening walk , and coming on to rest here , before he turns back to the city , I ’ ll be bound ! ’ said Mrs. Nickleby .
She was followed by the whelp .
She walked among ‘ em with my child , minding only her ; and brought her safe out , in the dead of the night , from that black pit of ruin !
‘ Eh ? ’ cried the old man , surveying him from head to foot .
They said no more , but sat apart ; the mother communing with her money ; the daughter with her thoughts ; the glance of each , shining in the gloom of the feebly lighted room .
This young man , besides having a great deal to say for himself about <NAME> and a project of his for teaching the coffee colonists to teach the natives to turn piano-forte legs and establish an export trade , delighted in drawing Mrs. Jellyby out by saying , `` I believe now , Mrs. Jellyby , you have received as

And what ’ s this straggling about in an idle sort of a way ?
How few of <NAME> 's faces are left alone to gladden us with their beauty !
It was far otherwise with little <NAME> .
‘ One who brings you news , was the answer , in a woman ’ s voice .
And , although I trembled for the agony it might one day be to him to have his strong assurance shivered at a blow , there was something so religious in it , so affectingly expressive of its anchor being in the purest depths of his fine nature , that the respect and honour in which I held him were
And by this time the cherubic parent was so fearful of surprise , that , but for the two wooden legs on which <NAME> and <NAME> was reassuringly mounted , his conscience might have introduced , in the person of that pensioner , his own stately lady disguised , arrived at <NAME> in a car and griffins , like the
`` Pray think , once more , <NAME> , '' said I .
It was the man ; the man he had followed in company with the girl , and whom he had overheard talking to <NAME> .
The time was , sir , when my dear brother Ned and I were two poor simple-hearted boys , wandering , almost barefoot , to seek our fortunes : are we changed in anything but years and worldly circumstances since that time ?
It was a by-street , and there was nobody about , or in the few wretched shops they passed .
‘ <NAME> surveyed the rooms he passed through , on his way downstairs , with the scrutinising eye of a landlord ; thinking it not impossible , that before long , they and their contents would be his property .

‘ No harm in that sir , ’ rejoined <NAME> , applying his eye to the other sleeve , and speaking in the voice of one who was contemplating an immense extent of prospect .
Away they dash and rattle through the streets ; and as they pass along , a thousand heads are turned to look at them , and a thousand sober moralists revenge themselves for not being married too , that morning , by reflecting that these people little think such happiness can ’ t last .
Each of you will do what is best for the other , if not what is best for yourselves . ''
“ No objection. ” I thanked him and ran home again , and there I found that <NAME> had already locked the front door and vacated the state parlor , and was seated by the kitchen fire with a hand on each knee , gazing intently at the burning coals .
Her darling was a pleasant sight too , embracing her and thanking her , and protesting against her taking so much trouble for her -- which last she only dared to do playfully , or <NAME> , sorely hurt , would have retired to her own chamber and cried .
‘ By <NAME> , <NAME> , ’ cried the Major , ‘ there ’ s a lady in the case. ’ ‘ Indeed , I begin to believe there really is , ’ returned <NAME> ; ‘ I thought you might be jesting when you seemed to hint at it ; for I know you military men ’ -- The

Neither of the two observed that in the course of these walks , they attracted the attention of a working man who was standing near the engine , and who touched his hat every time they passed ; for Mr Dombey habitually looked over the vulgar herd , not at them ; and the Major was looking , at the

She shared it with him ; and lingering on without pain , but without hope , her life ebbed slowly away .
I am not sure but that at first he was inclined to think it rather a moody scheme , and one that might do a brooding mind harm .
‘ My dear ’ ; and he stopped and turned to me : ‘ would you like to see your -- ’ ‘ No , father , ’ <NAME> interposed .
When I had gone over that , in the same manner , I asked the governor if he had any person in his charge who was shortly going out .

There is terror in the carriage , there is weeping , there is the heavy breathing of the insensible traveller .
Not less so , when she added : ‘ Even now , I see _you_ shrink from me , as if I had been cruel. ’ Little Dorrit could not gainsay it .
Such an honour and pleasure -- it ’ s both , <NAME> ’ s mother , it ’ s both -- is not to be forgotten so soon .

Now I think of it , the gentleman who brought us to your house . ''
That ’ s an under-handed mind , sir. ’ ‘ Do you say there ’ s something against him ? ’ <NAME> asks .
He makes so much of you , that it ’ s my opinion you think you ’ ve only to call your Pussys by the dozen , to make ’ em come. ’ ‘ You forget , Mrs. Tope , ’ <NAME> interposes , taking his place at the table with a genial smile , ‘ and so do you

How could they be near us , and be green and fresh ?
I said to <NAME> , meanwhile , that even if <NAME> were recognized and taken , in spite of himself , I should be wretched as the cause , however innocently .
So quietly did the mowing of the old scythe go on , that fully three months had passed unnoticed since the two <NAME> brothers had been laid in one tomb in the strangers ’ cemetery at <NAME> .

I knew I had an artful customer to deal with and that proof would be very difficult ; and I laid a trap for her -- such a trap as I never laid yet , and such a venture as I never made yet .
‘ Now , it ’ s a remarkable fact , sir , that it cut that man deeper , to know that his daughter knew of his being goosed , than to go through with it. ’ ‘ Good ! ’ interrupted <NAME> .
What answer do you make ? ’ ‘ Sir , ’ he rejoined , with an occasional separation and reunion of those delicate tips , ‘ my answer must be qualified ; because , to betray <NAME> ’ s confidence to his mother , and to betray it to you , are two different actions .

I have a right to complain of it as almost a breach of confidence .
But the figure that he seeks is not among them .
I am obliged to you , Carker. ’ Mr <NAME> bent his head slowly , and very softly rubbed his hands , as if he were afraid by any action to disturb the current of Mr <NAME> ’ s confidence .
Not that that is much though , I am sure .

‘ What I particularly request <NAME> to be careful of , is , ’ said Mrs. Micawber , ‘ that he does not , my dear <NAME> , in applying himself to this subordinate branch of the law , place it out of his power to rise , ultimately , to the top of the tree .
There ’ s many of them , I ’ m sure , that would be the better for it. ’ ‘ Thank you , <NAME> .
He sat up in bed and listened .
‘ How are you , <NAME> ? ’ said he .

'Has it long gone the half-hour ? '
‘ Supposing we should decide , on to-morrow ’ s inquiries , to send <NAME> down to <NAME> to this lady , who would go with him ? ’ inquired Mr Dombey , after some reflection .
She sat at the window , when the sun began to sink behind the smoke ; she sat there , when the smoke was burning red , when the colour faded from it , when darkness seemed to rise slowly out of the ground , and creep upward , upward , up to the house-tops , up the church steeple

Among other havens of domestic tranquillity and peace of mind , my feet will naturally tend towards the King ’ s <NAME> .
‘ I should like to sleep on that question to-night , ’ he answered doubtfully .
It 's well it 's the beer , and not the pot , as hit me , or I 'd have settled somebody .
It was his better nature to be true to her , if it were his worse nature to be wholly selfish .
Mr Mortimer Lightwood and Mr <NAME> took a coffee-house dinner together in Mr Lightwood ’ s office .
‘ Neighbour ! ’ said the old man , stopping at the cottage where his young guide ’ s mother dwelt , ‘ how is it that the folks are nearly all in black to-day ?
V. The <NAME> Those were drinking days , and most men drank hard .
‘ This evil , if evil it be , has been of my own seeking .
He took her mantle from the wall , and tenderly wrapped it round her .
‘ We have fallen upon strange times , and <NAME> only knows the end of them ; but I am tired with the events of these three days , and will postpone reflection till tomorrow -- if I can. ’ Of the <NAME> for <NAME> , and the first Appearance of <NAME> upon any Stage <NAME> was up betimes in
It was spacious , and I dare say had once been handsome , but every discernible thing in it was covered with dust and mould , and dropping to pieces .
His eyes looked so very sinister , as he put his leg into the room and glanced round at <NAME> , that she thought with a sudden coldness , if he were to go straight up-stairs to murder the invalid , what could she do to prevent him ?
And she has acted up to it glorious ! ''
‘ He is quite well , <NAME> , thank you , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Ah , my poor head ! ’ said Mrs. <NAME> , with a faint smile .
They have rumbled through the streets , and jolted over the stones , and at length reach the wide and open country .
As the dear old infant would be with us directly , he begged that I would make an appointment for the morning , when he might set himself right through the means of an unreserved conversation with me .
Though <NAME> was not at that time aware of it , the class of gentlemen before alluded to , proceed on just the same principle in all their transactions .
The spinster aunt was knitting .
<NAME> , your father 's daughter ! ” “ I thought , my father , ” said <NAME> , excusing herself , with a pale face and in a faltering voice , “ that I heard strange feet upon the stairs. ” “ My love , the staircase is as still as Death. ” As he said the word ,
‘ But , if I am not sure of myself , I am sure of you , <NAME> , and I know what an upright man you are , and how much to be respected .
Oh dear , how very kind of you !
Ada being in our room with a cold , <NAME> was left alone all this time and entertained himself by playing snatches of pathetic airs and sometimes singing to them ( as we heard at a distance ) with great expression and feeling .
He finished reading it there , with his back towards me , and after he had finished and had folded it up , stood there for some minutes with the letter in his hand .
‘ I am afraid you have been giving her some of your wicked looks , my lord , ’ said the intended .
Besides these works of art , there were a great many heads of old ladies and gentlemen smirking at each other out of blue and brown skies , and an elegantly written card of terms with an embossed border .
<NAME> <NAME> is the type and model of a young drummer .
She -- have you seen her , <NAME> ? '
We must have <NAME> , you know .
At the same time , the thin straight lines of the setting of the eyes , and the thin straight lips , and the markings in the nose , curved with a sarcasm that looked handsomely diabolic .
I prefer not to anticipate my communication here ; you will impart as much or as little of it as you please to your friends afterwards ; I have nothing to do with that. ” Amidst a wondering silence , we three walked out of the <NAME> , and in a wondering silence walked home .
He winked , shook his head , smiled , winked again ; and , with an expression of countenance which seemed to denote that he was greatly amused with something or other , walked merrily away .
so very soon ? ’ ‘ I have thought of this for weeks , and why should I postpone it ?
`` I will not hear you say such shameful words ! ''
you should have rung the worker ’ s bell , ’ said the footman , touching the handle of one in the door-post .
The greater part of the guests had gone to bed as soon as the eating and drinking were over ; and we , who had remained whispering and listening half-undressed , at last betook ourselves to bed , too .
You get husky bread and sour drink by it ; and he gets sausage of <NAME> , veal in savoury jelly , white bread , strachino cheese , and good wine by it .
‘ Get up , pig ! ’ growled the first .
' I say , ' said the other , looking over the rails , and speaking in a hoarse whisper ; 'what a time this would be for a sell !
They are nothing but good to me .
`` How do you do , sir ?
‘ <NAME> us on what grounds you make this accusation , ’ said <NAME> .
You have hit the probabilities exactly. ’ ‘ And with regard to your head Governor , ’ said the <NAME> , ‘ why an interview had better come about nat ’ ral between us .
Why does he move so softly to-night ?
Whereas I now found <NAME> to be a disembodied spirit , or a fiction , and his inn the dingiest collection of shabby buildings ever squeezed together in a rank corner as a club for Tom-cats .
In the service I mentally insert <NAME> ’ s name -- I put her in among the <NAME> .
exclaimed the old lady , starting ; 'do n't talk in that way , child .
Do not speak of money at present .
‘ And if it be a necessity— ’ <NAME> faltered .
<NAME> , <NAME> , admission for admission .
This desperate threat effectually broke up the party .
Whether he had been attacked and defeated by <NAME> , and was ashamed to show himself after his discomfiture .
<NAME> is no object here .
He withdraws his hand and falls to looking at the sleet and snow again until they seem , by being long looked at , to fall so thick and fast that he is obliged to close his eyes for a minute on the giddy whirl of white flakes and icy blots .
The subject did not admit of a doubt .
It was a great jest of his , I recollect , to pretend that he couldn ’ t keep his teeth from chattering , whenever mention was made of an Alguazill in connexion with the adventures of <NAME> ; and I remember that when <NAME> met the captain of the robbers in <NAME> , this unlucky joker counterfeited such an
It ’ s the only thing in all the world that I am fit for , or that ’ s fit for me .
‘ Here you are , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ bonds -- take care of them .
It happened that in the street they had several times passed a dingy house , apparently empty , with bills in the windows , announcing that it was to let .
The <NAME> , at his best , appeared so poor a substitute for the love and pride of parents .
‘ And I ’ ll tell you what , my dear Copperfield , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ your friend <NAME> is a young fellow who might be attorney-general .
`` Jo , can you say what I say ? ''
“ <NAME> out of this office .
The arrival of this unexpected heir soon taking wind in the court still makes good for the <NAME> and keeps the court upon its mettle .
C. ” ’ said the stranger -- ‘ queer set out -- old fellow ’ s likeness , and “ P .
<NAME> <NAME> was in the last degree amazed and disconcerted at sight of <NAME> , and had murmured involuntarily , ‘ Look here !
<NAME> <NAME> 's niece 's sister -- the plump one with the lace tucker : not the one with the roses -- blushed .
Then followed the recognition of <NAME> , and then the greeting of <NAME> , and then that of Mr Pluck , and finally , to complete the young lady ’ s mortification , she was compelled at Mrs. Wititterly ’ s request to perform the ceremony of introducing the odious persons , whom she regarded with the utmost indignation and
‘ Very sorry , ’ said the crestfallen <NAME> .
I have stood between your father and mother for a number of years .
Welcome to your house and home , my deary ! ’ In all the first bewilderment of her wonder , the most bewilderingly wonderful thing to <NAME> was the shining countenance of Mr Boffin .
‘ But we are always glad to come home , father ; now , are we not ?
‘ I hope you dote upon pictures ? ’ ‘ I assure you , <NAME> , ’ said Mr Dombey , with solemn encouragement of his Manager , ‘ that <NAME> has a very good taste for pictures ; quite a natural power of appreciating them .
Therefore , the constable , still holding Kit in the same manner , and pushing him on a little before him , so as to keep him at about three-quarters of an arm ’ s length in advance ( which is the professional mode ) , thrust him into the vehicle and followed himself .
But you began by saying that we took different views , you know .
Over ! ’ And the <NAME> , hooking off his glazed hat , pulled his handkerchief out of the crown , wiped his grizzled head despairingly , and tossed the handkerchief in again , with the indifference of deep dejection .
That will be his place , -- there , ” striking the table with her stick , “ at my head !
On opening it to let <NAME> out , she found Mr <NAME> , instead of having gone his way , as in any less wonderful place and among less wonderful phenomena he might have been reasonably expected to do , fluttering up and down the court outside the house .
All this time I was deeply anxious to know what she was going to do with me ; but she took her dinner in profound silence , except when she occasionally fixed her eyes on me sitting opposite , and said , ‘ Mercy upon us ! ’ which did not by any means relieve my anxiety .
There was an empty room above-stairs at the wooden <NAME> ’ s , which , in days of yore , had been <NAME> ’ s bedroom .
My low tap at the door was answered by <NAME> .
Evidently close at hand from the peculiar shock it communicated to the air , yet subdued as if it were far off .
I therefore supposed that Mrs. <NAME> was not at home , and was quite surprised when the person appeared in the passage without the pattens , and going up to the back room on the first floor before <NAME> and me , announced us as , `` Them two young ladies , <NAME> ! ''
‘ Well , so your old master and young mistress have gone ? ’ ‘ Where ? ’ rejoined <NAME> , looking round .
‘ I see him a-winkin ’ at her , with his wicked old eye , ’ shouted a fourth .
But , as it chanced to be immediately under his nose , it followed , as a matter of course , that he looked all over his desk for it , without finding it ; and happening in the course of his search to look straight before him , his gaze encountered the pale and terrified face of <NAME> :
‘ I thought it was “ adore. ” ’ ‘ “ Love , ” my dear , ’ retorted <NAME> .
‘ It ’ s on the spot , you see , and a very cheerful place. ’ ‘ And when , ’ hints Mr Dombey , ‘ would it be convenient ? ’ ‘ I shall make a point , ’ says <NAME> , ‘ of pledging myself for any day you think best .
But while I must , rather peremptorily , request my friend <NAME> not to criminate my lovely and accomplished relative until her criminality is perfectly established , I beg to assure my friend <NAME> that the family I represent , and which is now almost extinct ( devilish sad reflection for a man ) , will interpose no obstacle in
The fact is , the girl was washing the glasses .
I would sooner be put back again upon that piece of wreck , on which I have so often floated , since my preservation , in my dreams , and there left to drift , and drive , and die ! ’ ‘ Hooroar , my lad ! ’ exclaimed the <NAME> , in a burst of uncontrollable satisfaction .
This unforeseen and violent removal of one whom she had long watched and distrusted and who had long watched and distrusted her , one for whom she could have had few intervals of kindness , always dreading in him a dangerous and secret enemy , appeared so awful that my first thoughts were of her .
She could keep her own part of it from him ; he should never know of her loss ; in time to come he should know all that was of import to himself ; but he should never know what concerned her only .
And not only that , but <NAME> would presently , without any pointed application in the world , chance to say something with such a sting in it that <NAME> would draw back as if he had put his hand into a bee-hive .
He called for the lady ’ s maid , and roared for the doctor ; and then , rushing into the yard , kicked the two Lincoln greens who were the most used to it , and cursing the others all round , bade them go -- but never mind where .
Among the rest , she converted the pantry into a dressing-room for me ; and purchased and embellished a bedstead for my occupation , which looked as like a bookcase in the daytime as a bedstead could .
And should you like to be always taken care of here , if you were industrious and deserving ? ’ ‘ Oh , mum ! -- But there ’ s Mrs Higden , ’ said <NAME> , checking himself in his raptures , drawing back , and shaking his head with very serious meaning .
The old man looked , irresolutely and helplessly , first at her , then to the right and left , then at her again , and shook his head .
I deigned to make him no reply ; and , taking up my hat , was going out to bed , when he came between me and the door .
‘ Come , you let me alone , ’ said the boy , parrying <NAME> ’ s hand with both his elbows alternatively .
It is well meant , I have no doubt , but I reject it .
I can ’ t stop a minute , or I shall be missed , and I don ’ t want ‘ em to miss me. -- Eh , <NAME> ? ’ He seemed to have an insatiate delight in appealing to her and looking at her ; excitedly sticking his hair up at the same moment , like a dark
From early in the evening until nearly midnight , little groups of two and three presented themselves at the lodge-gate , and inquired , with anxious faces , whether any reprieve had been received .
he said , speaking in a homely , rustic way and with great vehemence .
‘ Go about your business. ’ But in taking them with so little ceremony , Mr <NAME> dropped one on the floor , and did not see what he had done ; neither did Mr Dombey observe the letter lying near his feet .
But no hand was there , and it opened no more .
“ I lighted on you , <NAME> , coming out of the prison of the <NAME> while I was contemplating the walls , an hour or more ago .
He entreated her , for her father 's sake , never to seek to know whether her father had become oblivious of the existence of the paper , or had had it recalled to him ( for the moment , or for good ) , by the story of the <NAME> , on that old Sunday under the dear old
‘ You rendered us a very important service this morning , sir , ’ said he , ‘ will you allow us to offer a slight mark of our gratitude by begging the favour of your company at dinner ? ’ ‘ Great pleasure -- not presume to dictate , but broiled fowl and mushrooms- -capital thing !
‘ Fire away ! ’ ‘ I ha ’ coom , ’ <NAME> began , raising his eyes from the floor , after a moment ’ s consideration , ‘ to ask yo yor advice .
The seizure of the station with a fit of trembling , gradually deepening to a complaint of the heart , announced the train .
<NAME> ’ t I say so ? ’ Here Mrs. <NAME> sobbed .
I wish to be honourable , <NAME> , ’ said Mr Toots , holding back his extended hand for a moment , ‘ and therefore I am obliged to say that I can not help thinking about <NAME> .
I should dearly like to know , of course ; ’ ( which her anxious face confirmed ; ) ‘ but I wait until you can tell me of your own free will .
I never do ; I never have done .
But I can ’ t think about the lesson .
said the Jew , drawing his chair forward , and speaking in a very low voice .
“ 'See , gentlemen , ' said I , still keeping my hands upon her breast , 'how useless I am , as you have brought me !
We ’ ll drink the daisies of the field , in compliment to you ; and the lilies of the valley that toil not , neither do they spin , in compliment to me -- the more shame for me ! ’ A moody smile that had overspread his features cleared off as he said this merrily , and he
‘ That is a threat , ’ he answered , in his voiceless manner of assent : adding aloud , ‘ but not directed against you. ’ Proud , erect , and dignified , as she stood confronting him ; and looking through him as she did , with her full bright flashing eye ; and smiling , as she
There was nothing for it , but to turn back and begin all over again .
‘ Ay ay , we ’ ll take care of the old woman .
You have such a gentle nature , and you are always right. ’ ‘ You talk , ’ said <NAME> , breaking into a pleasant laugh , as she sat at work , ‘ as if I were the late <NAME> Larkins. ’ ‘ Come !
The turnkey nodded ; and the companion passed in without being asked whom he wanted .
‘ I am not aweer , <NAME> , that you have any right to address your conversation to me .
‘ Under the impression , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ that your peregrinations in this metropolis have not as yet been extensive , and that you might have some difficulty in penetrating the arcana of the <NAME> in the direction of the <NAME> , -- in short , ’ said <NAME> , in another burst of confidence , ‘ that
He knew , as every one employed as he was did , that he was never safe ; that flight was impossible ; that he was tied fast under the shadow of the axe ; and that in spite of his utmost tergiversation and treachery in furtherance of the reigning terror , a word might bring it down upon him
‘ I am sorry , <NAME> , ’ said Mr Dombey , ‘ that you should not have thought it your duty -- ’ She looked at him again .
Thus , she walking backward and he walking forward , they came into their own room .
A man of the name of <NAME> .
I mean to pay him too , ’ retorted <NAME> .
If you please , miss , '' said <NAME> in a whisper , with her eyes at their roundest and largest .
Looking out between the curtains , he espied Mr <NAME> , Mr Abel , the notary , and the single gentleman , gathered round the <NAME> , and talking to her with great earnestness but in very subdued tones -- fearing , no doubt , to disturb him .
<NAME> , who could hardly stand , made a shift to raise himself on his feet , and was at once lugged along the streets by the jacket-collar , at a rapid pace .
What power could I have over them , but that they were bound in the bonds of their sin , and delivered to me ! ’ More than forty years had passed over the grey head of this determined woman , since the time she recalled .
I had found the niece before then ; and what I did for her , was better for her far than the money of which she would have had no good. ’ She added , after a moment , as though she addressed the watch : ‘ She herself was innocent , and I might not have forgotten to relinquish
<NAME> curious , your delightful sex is ! ''
Would you object to my writing it ? ''
And now , dear Biddy , if you can tell me that you will go through the world with me , you will surely make it a better world for me , and me a better man for it , and I will try hard to make it a better world for you. ” <NAME> was my purpose .
With these concluding words , <NAME> gives a shake to each of the hands he holds , and relinquishing them , backs a pace or two in a broad-chested , upright attitude , as if he had made a final confession and were immediately going to be shot with all military honours .
But she couldn ’ t control herself to go any further .
‘ Excuse my putting it to you , <NAME> , but now really !
<NAME> is now at work upon embroidery or some such pretty thing , and as she bends her head over it , my Lady watches her in silence .
And keep as near me , as you can . '
‘ Put me down for another twenty -- or -- stop a minute , stop a minute .
Do not use such strong words. ’ ‘ He might have laid my dear boy dead at my feet .
<NAME> , what does it matter , after all ! ’ Having arrived at this comfortable frame of mind ( to which she had been greatly assisted by certain short interjectional remarks of the philosophical <NAME> ) , <NAME> consoled <NAME> with many kind words , and requested as a personal favour that whenever she thought of <NAME> , she
It won ’ t do to be like long <NAME> , when they took him to church “ to marry him to somebody ” , as he says , and left the bride behind .
He was still too weak to get up to breakfast ; but , when he came down into the housekeeper 's room next day , his first act was to cast an eager glance at the wall , in the hope of again looking on the face of the beautiful lady .
growled <NAME> , in his accustomed voice , as near as he could feign it .
We see enough ! ’ cried <NAME> .
‘ And is <NAME> absolutely banished ? ’ said the Major , thrusting in his purple face over the steps .
Similarly , when I am reminded by any chance of what it was that the waves were always saying , my remembrance wanders for a whole winter night about the streets of <NAME> -- as I restlessly did with a little friend and I parted company .
In case you should think better at any time , however distant -- THAT 'S no consequence , for my feelings can never alter -- of anything I have said , particularly what might I not do , <NAME> , eighty-seven , <NAME> , or if removed , or dead ( of blighted hopes or anything of that sort )
<NAME> ! ’ looking into the lines .
‘ Not this morning , ’ he said to the dog .
So strange , to have the road-dust on his feet instead of the coal-grit .
`` When did he come from <NAME> ? ''
‘ How can I be otherwise , my own love , when I see your empty chair ? ’ ‘ My empty chair ! ’ She clings to me for a little while , in silence .
Finding her still very restless on this head , they made him up a bed in an inner room , to which he presently retired .
Nothing more was said between the happy pair .
As there was a stream of people pouring into a shabby house not far from the entrance , he waited until they had made their way in , and then making up to the servant , ventured to inquire if he knew where <NAME> lived .
A man has confidence in untried friends , he remembers the many offers of service so freely made by his boon companions when he wanted them not ; he has hope -- the hope of happy inexperience -- and however he may bend beneath the first shock , it springs up in his bosom , and flourishes there for a
‘ <NAME> ’ said <NAME> ; and down they sat .
I looked up , and met her sharp bright glance respectfully .
He wandered through the rooms : lately so luxurious ; now so bare and dismal and so changed , apparently , even in their shape and size .
‘ Allow me , ’ said <NAME> suddenly , ‘ to ask how <NAME> is ? ’ He leaned forward obsequiously , as he made the inquiry , with his chin resting on his hand ; and at the same time his eyes went up to the picture , as if he said to it , ‘ Now , see
A happy party they were , that night .
I should never have sought you out , madam , to say what I am going to say , but since you have sought me out and are here , I will throw it off my mind .
<NAME> <NAME> grasped the undertaker by the arm , and led him into the building .
And the coach in which we came here being at the door , you ’ ll allow me to hand you down to it , and pack you home to the <NAME> : where the best course for you to pursue , will be to put your feet into the hottest water you can bear , and take a glass
If you should ever get so far as this in this long letter , you will perhaps say , Surely Little <NAME> will not leave off without telling me something about her travels , and surely it is time she did .
‘ And how , ’ said <NAME> , when he had grasped his followers by the hand , and exchanged warm salutations of welcome -- ‘ how is <NAME> ? ’ <NAME> , to whom the question was more peculiarly addressed , made no reply .
Mrs <NAME> circulated the news , as she received congratulations on it , with a careless grace that displayed it to advantage , as the setting displays the jewel .
‘ Dear Miss Trotwood , is that all the history ? ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Not come in search of you , you see ; but still seeking some one .
I believe , ” said <NAME> , rather halting in his reassuring words , as the stony manner of all the three impressed itself upon him more and more , “ I state the case , <NAME> ? ” <NAME> looked gloomily at his wife , and gave no other answer than a gruff sound of acquiescence .
He was taken ill in the night -- quite prostrate he was -- in consequence of <NAME> ; and after being drugged with black draughts and blue pills , to an extent which <NAME> ( whose father was a doctor ) said was enough to undermine a horse ’ s constitution , received a caning and six chapters of <NAME>
‘ You have no connection with any of those rascally papers have you ? ’ said <NAME> .
What else is to be expected ! ’ ‘ I am even a poorer man of business than I am a man , sir , ’ returned <NAME> , ‘ and I could hardly express my deficiency in a stronger way .
The other lady , who had not spoken yet , said gravely and emphatically , “ Very true ! ” “ Poor soul ! ” <NAME> presently went on ( I knew they had all been looking at me in the mean time ) , “ he is so very strange !
‘ “ A man , ” replied the figure .
‘ He said about an hour , ’ replied <NAME> -- politely of course , but without any indication of being stricken to the heart by <NAME> ’ s charms .
<NAME> , let us be courageous .
That time passed , and her little Lucie lay on her bosom .
You don ’ t often meet with such behaviour in young men , and it strikes one more when one does meet with it. ’ ‘ Oh !
He was happy , he observed , in his public capacity as leader and representative of the <NAME> , to receive Mr Clennam when he called to pay his respects ; but he didn ’ t find that he got on with him personally .
‘ I ’ ll take ‘ em. ’ ‘ The boots and clothes are extras , ’ said <NAME> ; ‘ and the fires in winter time are -- ’ ‘ Are all agreed to , ’ answered the single gentleman .
So very great is the improvement Time has brought about in such habits , that a moderate statement of the quantity of wine and punch which one man would swallow in the course of a night , without any detriment to his reputation as a perfect gentleman , would seem , in these days , a ridiculous exaggeration .
‘ <NAME> and gentleman ? ’ inquired <NAME> , almost breathless with impatience .
One sunny afternoon when I had come home from school with my books and portfolio , watching my long shadow at my side , and as I was gliding upstairs to my room as usual , my godmother looked out of the parlour-door and called me back .
Fifty-seven churches to be erected with half-crowns , forty-two parsonage houses to be repaired with shillings , seven-and-twenty organs to be built with halfpence , twelve hundred children to be brought up on postage stamps .
After the first six months or so I had taken <NAME> 's advice in reference to the propriety of writing to <NAME> to say that I was happy and grateful , and with her approval I had written such a letter .
‘ <NAME> , you an ’ t worth powder and shot , but I ’ ll be even with you one way or another. ’ ‘ Stop , ’ interposed <NAME> , as <NAME> was about to speak .
‘ Only his playfulness , gen ’ lm ’ n , ’ said the head hostler encouragingly ; ‘ jist kitch hold on him , Villiam. ’ The deputy restrained the animal ’ s impetuosity , and the principal ran to assist <NAME> in mounting .
What discussion , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Shall I tell him , Mr Fledgeby ? ’ asked <NAME> .
I made it a rule to take as much out of myself as I possibly could , in my way of doing everything to which I applied my energies .
Therefore it is sealed and deposited for posting among the iron correspondence of the day .
‘ Open the door , and let me take my dear friend <NAME> to my arms !
So was <NAME> , for he was seldom otherwise .
`` If you have allowed anything wrong to come to that security of <NAME> 's , and if you have let him in for it , and if you have put us in danger of being sold up -- and I see sold up in your face , <NAME> , as plain as print -- you have done a shameful
A part of this door was of glass unprotected by any shutter , which I did not observe at first , for all was very dark and silent within , and I was anxious ( as indeed the child was also ) for an answer to our summons .
Dropping in at Mr <NAME> ’ s office on the previous evening , in the absence of that gentleman and his learned sister , he had lighted upon Mr <NAME> , who chanced at the moment to be sprinkling a glass of warm gin and water on the dust of the law , and to be moistening his clay ,
In one part , carcases of houses , inauspiciously begun and never finished , rotted away .
Why have I alluded to it ?
`` Then , cousin <NAME> -- '' <NAME> laughingly began again .
‘ How could you presume to come here on such an errand , you scoundrel ? ’ ‘ <NAME> !
When the narrative was concluded ; he raised his head hastily , as if about to speak , but on brother <NAME> resuming , fell into his old attitude again .
The <NAME> of <NAME> sends a splendid pile of dust and ashes , with silver wheel-boxes , patent axles , all the last improvements , and three bereaved worms , six feet high , holding on behind , in a bunch of woe .
But I know nothing about it , I assure you ; for I am a mere child , and I lay no claim to it , and I do n't want it ! '
Where does any one say I was seen ? ’ returned the girl , sullenly casting down her eyes .
‘ Not going back again ? ’ said the poor little anxious Child of the <NAME> , always calculating and planning for <NAME> , in the front rank of her charges .
I told you so beforehand , my dear , ’ said <NAME> .
But that ’ s not all , sir .
The nature even of the mild men got corrupted , either from their curdling it with too much lemonade , or from the general inoculation that prevailed ; and they made sarcastic jokes to one another , and whispered disparagement on stairs and in bye-places .
'Go to him , ' Biddy say , 'without loss of time . '
‘ <NAME> , I were never good at showin o ’ t , though I ha had ’ n my share in feeling o ’ t .
‘ Well , ’ he demanded after a silence , ‘ have you nothing to say to all that ? ’ ‘ It ’ s ugly , ’ returned the little man , who had risen , and was brightening his knife upon his shoe , as he leaned an arm against the wall .
‘ I am certain of it .
The elder child remained with her father when the rest had gone away , and made his tea for him -- happy little house-keeper she was then ! -- and sat conversing with him , sometimes at the window , sometimes in the room , until the candles came .
‘ Why , they say , ’ returned his wife , ‘ that listeners never hear any good of themselves ; though you -- but pray how long have you been here , sir ? ’ ‘ This instant arrived , my own. ’ ‘ Then I may go on -- though if you had been here but a moment
cried <NAME> , to all appearance much relieved .
inquired my guardian , almost sternly .
But I rejoice in its occurrence , for it has opened the way for me to approach <NAME> with this subject to-day , even if it has entailed upon me the penalty of her temporary displeasure .
‘ Now , ’ said Mr Garland when they had made some further inquiries of him , ‘ I am not going to give you anything -- ’ ‘ Thank you , sir , ’ Kit replied ; and quite seriously too , for this announcement seemed to free him from the suspicion which the Notary had hinted .
I write the exact truth .
He would do nothing to make it a desperate venture , and he had very little fear of his safety with such good help .
Even now , although he knew that the observation of an anxious mother was much more likely to be correct in such a case than his own , and although she reminded him of many little circumstances which , taken together , were certainly susceptible of the construction she triumphantly put upon them , he was not quite convinced but
Or take it this way , <NAME> , ’ he added , after a moment ’ s reflection ; ‘ Supposing that a man had to go through life , we won ’ t say with a companion , but we ’ ll say to a tune .
Carrying these with <NAME> ’ s aid , he passed up to his dwelling .
Accordingly , I took the jacket off , that I might learn to do without it ; and carrying it under my arm , began a tour of inspection of the various slop-shops .
And why have you done it ?
In short , she was shaking the curls again , when the little dog came running along the walk to our relief .
more shame for him , ’ thought <NAME> .
At last , however , he began to think -- as you or I would have thought at first ; for it is always the person not in the predicament who knows what ought to have been done in it , and would unquestionably have done it too -- at last , I say , he began to think that
‘ <NAME> word , my dear sir , very harsh word indeed .
During the whole interval , whenever I went to the bottom of the staircase , I heard her footstep , saw her light pass above , and heard her ceaseless low cry .
<NAME> looked as if she would like to trace the connexion of ideas between <NAME> and <NAME> ’ s <NAME> ’ s <NAME> .
Not so , by any means .
The door is opened by the same weak-eyed young man , whose imbecility of grin at sight of Mr Toots is feebleness of character personified .
I thought I might as well keep them to myself as have them swallowed up alive too ; so I kept them in a box , looking over them when I felt in the humour .
Her lips quivered and opened , in spite of her utmost efforts to keep them still .
<NAME> day to you , gentlemen ; good day ! ''
<NAME> relieved her from her perplexity by taking his departure without delay : <NAME> making many gracious inquiries why he never came to see them ; and <NAME> anathematising the stairs with great volubility as he followed them down , in the hope of inducing <NAME> to look round , -- a hope , however , which was destined to
' I think I see him now , ' cried the Jew , bending his eyes upon his pupil .
<NAME> ’ t you speak to him ?
The gentleman walked on with them by the officer 's side ; and as many of the crowd as could achieve the feat , got a little ahead , and stared back at <NAME> from time to time .
Nicholas could not go to bed without expatiating on the excellences and munificence of the brothers <NAME> , and relating the great success which had attended his efforts that day .
It had vanished from the earth .
‘ Tight-Jeff or Slack-Jeff , it don ’ t much signify : it ’ s only tight-rope and slack-rope .
<NAME> went on , and the turnkey began to fail .
‘ Never owed her a penny , <NAME> ’ r , ’ said <NAME> , in a low voice , and with visible marks of trepidation on his countenance .
<NAME> do it , Sir. ’ As <NAME> put himself very temptingly within the reach of <NAME> ’ s clenched fist , there is little doubt that that gentleman would have complied with his earnest entreaty , but for the interposition of <NAME> , who , hearing the dispute , emerged from the office , mounted the stairs , and
‘ “ I ’ ll astonish you , ” said <NAME> , putting his hand in his pocket .
At one point , as we ascended a steep hill , athwart whose base a railroad , yet constructing , took its course , we came upon an <NAME> colony .

<NAME> kept one hand on my lips , and raised the other in a listening attitude .
You will find the cold mutton on the table . ''
He took out of his pocket the most respectable hunting-watch I ever saw , and preventing the spring with his thumb from opening far , looked in at the face as if he were consulting an oracular oyster , shut it up again , and said , if I pleased , it was half past eight .
'Will she be buried to-morrow , or next day , or to-night ?
'He has brought me to this lonely place to murder me ! '
This <NAME> does with great discretion , appearing to address himself to <NAME> , but having an eye solely on the old girl all the time , as <NAME> has himself .
Sweeping past the gold and silver demonstration on the sideboard as if it were heaped-up dirt , and deigning to bestow no look upon the elegancies around her , she took her place at his board for the first time , and sat , like a statue , at the feast .
There is a splendid wedding in the church .
I am in now , as one of the regulars. ’ ‘ Oh !
‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ I dare say you have been annoyed in the <NAME> ; there are some odd gentry there .
Was he prejudiced against the race of lawyers ?
We all three went home together next day .
He went away in high spirits .
<NAME> kind for once , and sing us an <NAME> song. ’ ‘ What do you care for an <NAME> song ? ’ she returned .
The house was kept by a characteristic old couple , with whom we had a long talk , and who were perhaps a very good sample of that kind of people in the <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> ’ s the matter with me , ’ replied <NAME> nervously .
Think of this now , <NAME> and Mrs. Micawber .
<NAME> <NAME> L. <NAME> 's <NAME> .
‘ Good-bye ! ’ ‘ Good-bye ! ’ said the pretty housemaid .
That wasn ’ t his doing , so don ’ t lay it at his door. ’ ‘ Hold your tongue , you Jezebel , ’ said <NAME> , looking fearfully round .
Why , you won ’ t tell me , <NAME> , that you really suppose my sister Loo does care for old Bounderby. ’ ‘ My dear fellow , ’ returned the other , ‘ what am I bound to suppose , when I find two married people living in harmony and happiness ? ’ <NAME> had by this time
So Mr <NAME> bought a gift of each sort , and paid handsomely for it .
Even <NAME> standing in a window , moodily swinging the tassel of a blind , gives it a smarter jerk now , as if he found himself in better case .
‘ Have you been travelling ? ’ Mr Short replied in the affirmative with a nod and a smile .
It is the <NAME> of <NAME> for the State , in which silence is strictly maintained , but where the prisoners have the comfort and mental relief of seeing each other , and of working together .
‘ I ’ ll not detain you any longer now , ’ he said , putting a crown into <NAME> ’ s hand , and looking towards the Notary .
More remarkable by being so removed from the crowd it was among than if it had been lifted on a pedestal to be seen , the figure attracted all eyes .
And I ’ m glad to see he ’ s having his fire kindled up , for it ’ s chilly after the wet , and the <NAME> had both a damp feel and a damp touch this afternoon , and he was very shivery. ’ They all three look towards an old stone gatehouse crossing the <NAME> , with
They lingered about , in the fields , for some hours .
There was my brother , as I read in chance <NAME> papers now and then , rising to be prosperous and famous .
Without other announcement or ceremony , <NAME> walks in .
`` Since then , '' said I , `` we have never spoken on the subject except once . ''
‘ It ’ s my opinion , you see , ’ said <NAME> , with a delighted face , after some further rubbing of his legs , ‘ as this is along of my havin ’ played with her so much , and made believe as we was <NAME> , and <NAME> , and sharks , and every wariety of
From many dreams of rambling through light and sunny places , but with some vague object unattained which ran indistinctly through them all , she awoke to find that it was yet night , and that the stars were shining brightly in the sky .
‘ It ’ s a bad light to distinguish objects in , ’ murmured Mrs. Nickleby , peering into the garden , ‘ and my eyes are not very good -- I was short-sighted from a child -- but , upon my word , I think there ’ s another large vegetable marrow sticking , at this moment , on
I think so , because she beckoned to me to climb up , with quite a new and motherly expression in her face , and put her arm round my neck , and gave me just such a kiss as she might have given to her own boy .
In taking me to him my guardian told me this , and also explained how it was that he had come to think of me .
`` <NAME> , '' I urged , `` it is not so hopeless as that ? ''
His blood is infected , and objects lose their natural aspects in his sight .
‘ Our judgments -- I am supposing a general case -- ’ ‘ Of course , ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> may complain , but if <NAME> grumbles by so much as a word -- oh dear , down with him , down with him directly .
Now then , just you hear a word or two from me .
‘ Side of One-tree <NAME> , at twelve o ’ clock , Sir. ’ ‘ That ’ s not <NAME> ’ s land , is it ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , <NAME> ; but it ’ s close by it .
After this memorable event , I went to the hatter 's , and the bootmaker 's , and the hosier 's , and felt rather like <NAME> 's dog whose outfit required the services of so many trades .
Here somebody cried out , ‘ Shame , <NAME> !
‘ Major Bagstock , my darling <NAME> , ’ drawled her mother , ‘ who is generally the most useless and disagreeable creature in the world : as you know -- ’ ‘ It is surely not worthwhile , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , looking round , ‘ to observe these forms of speech .
In a corner below the mangle , on a couple of stools , sat two very little children : a boy and a girl ; and when the very long boy , in an interval of staring , took a turn at the mangle , it was alarming to see how it lunged itself at those two innocents , like
I don ’ t know any such person. ’ ‘ Well , <NAME> , then. ’ ‘ I never heard the name in my life. ’ ‘ Then , I have been deceived , and deluded , ’ said <NAME> .
Were you one of many children ? ’ He shook his head .
All these proceedings occupied <NAME> so much , that it was not until the following day that he saw <NAME> again .
The exertion this cost him , or the consciousness of talking in that feeble way , made his angry face so much more angry , and his thick veins so much thicker , when he spoke , that I am not surprised , on looking back , at this peculiarity striking me as his chief one .
They left that fancy ware to boys and girls , and boarding-schools and books .
They straggle about in wrong places , look at wrong things , do n't care for the right things , gape when more rooms are opened , exhibit profound depression of spirits , and are clearly knocked up .
So powerfully was his imagination impressed by it , that when his driver stopped , after having asked the way more than once , and said to the best of his belief this was the gateway they wanted , Mr <NAME> stood hesitating , with the coach-door in his hand , half afraid of the dark look of the place
He was passing at nightfall along the <NAME> , and the lamp-lighter was going on before him , under whose hand the street-lamps , blurred by the foggy air , burst out one after another , like so many blazing sunflowers coming into full-blow all at once , -- when a stoppage on the pavement , caused by a train
<NAME> , still looking , and always looking with an immovable countenance , at the opposite side of the world , made no reply .
‘ <NAME> ! ’ he thought , suddenly correcting himself , ‘ what a boy I am ! ’ ‘ It is better as it is , ’ said <NAME> , after he had lounged on , a few paces , and returned to the same spot .
In obedience to this summons the clerk got off the high stool ( to which he had communicated a high polish by countless gettings off and on ) , and presented himself in <NAME> ’ s room .
`` A tremendous family to provide for ! ''
You know the consequences of mixing them ? ” “ Perfectly. ” Certain small packets were made and given to him .
`` Do n't shake your head , '' said <NAME> .
This matter is not at all in my course of practice and is not in my office .
I am sure you can tell me something connected with the coming here of this man , if you will. ’ ‘ Why , then I ’ ll tell you , <NAME> , ’ returned <NAME> -- ‘ <NAME> ’ s coming ! ’ ‘ <NAME> , indeed he is not .
His thoughts , as yet , have no wider range than home .
That ’ s a cautious fellow. ’ ‘ He is a very cautious fellow indeed , ’ returned <NAME> .
“ I say a horse at a canter coming up , Joe. ” “ _I_ say a horse at a gallop , <NAME> , ” returned the guard , leaving his hold of the door , and mounting nimbly to his place .
<NAME> out of his house .
‘ <NAME> to me in half an hour , and I ’ ll tell you more. ’ <NAME> waited upon him at the time mentioned , and then learnt all that had taken place on the previous day , and all that was known of the appointment <NAME> had made with the brothers ; which was for that night ;
His sister gently touched him on the shoulder , and pointed to it .
No , no , not for the world ! ’ ‘ Is it really gone though ? ’ said <NAME> , looking at <NAME> with a face as pale as his own .
Through the munificence of Mr Boffin .
He don ’ t care for an old ‘ ooman like me , I dare say. ’ ‘ I assure you , ma ’ am , ’ said <NAME> , grasping the old lady ’ s hand , and speaking so loud that the exertion imparted a crimson hue to his benevolent countenance -- ‘ I assure you , ma
'Bear a hand with the boy , ' cried <NAME> , beckoning furiously to his confederate .
I am sure I hardly know how it ’ s done ! ’ ‘ Are many of the young ladies with you ? ’ I inquired .
YOU must be rambling a little now , I think , if you do n't know that this is the great reason why titles will always last in the land ! ''
‘ Not a syllable , sir , from my man , if we talk till doomsday , ’ returned the captain .
Always proceeding from a rigid mouth and closed teeth , as if the jaw were locked and the face frozen up in pain .
‘ Very well , ’ cried <NAME> with an air of resignation , ‘ then I suppose it must be done !
You seem to know all about ‘ em , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Yes , Miss. ’ And threw back his head and laughed .
And where ’ s the good of it ?
‘ Yes , <NAME> , it is , ’ replies <NAME> , advancing .
If that was bad , I am sorry ; but you repeat it after consideration , and that seems to me to be at least no better .
Dash it , <NAME> , '' says that gentleman , `` you really ought to be careful how you wound the feelings of a man who has an unrequited image imprinted on his 'eart and who is <NAME> altogether happy in those chords which vibrate to the tenderest emotions .
The Captain himself was in the last extremity of shabbiness , with large whiskers , and an old , old brown great-coat with no other coat below it .
She settled with herself , now I ’ ll never refer to that meeting under such different circumstances , and I ’ ll never pretend to have any idea that these are the same girls .
`` And not only here , but you will go to <NAME> 's too , perhaps ?
<NAME> <NAME> looked more astonished than hospitable , at sight of this uninvited party in his dining-room .
The curse of those occasions is heavy upon me , for I always remember them .
'Yes , I know you are , ' said the gentleman : 'You 're hungry too , a n't you ? '
‘ And <NAME> is here , ’ said <NAME> , in rapid conclusion ; ‘ and , could you believe it ?
<NAME> had , by this time , put her hand in <NAME> ’ s ; and was looking very earnestly , and with increasing agitation , into every new street into which they turned .
I know how natural it was that he should regard my presence as something offensive ; I felt it must be so , myself. ’ ‘ He did not say so ? ’ ‘ No ; he said nothing : but I saw that his glance rested on me for a moment , and I was prepared for what would
It was a case of jealousy .
He lounged along moodily , and stopped at <NAME> to look about him , with as little interest in the crowd as any man might take , and was lounging on again , when a most unexpected object caught his eyes .
‘ Sam ! ’ said <NAME> , calling over the banisters .
`` I hope , guardian , '' said I , `` that you may not trust too much to my discretion .
<NAME> presents his kind regards to <NAME> , and will feel obliged if he will inform him at what hour tomorrow morning it will be most convenient to him to meet <NAME> at the Theatre , for the purpose of having his nose pulled in the presence of the company .
It may be profitable to that gentleman to know , sir , that I attribute my past follies , entirely to having lived a thoughtless life in the service of young men ; and to having allowed myself to be led by them into weaknesses , which I had not the strength to resist .
What do you mean by this noise , you hussies ? '
‘ And Oh my Eye , I ’ m so sore ! ’ cried <NAME> , starting , over on his back , in a spasmodic way that caused the dressmaker to retreat to the wall .
‘ <NAME> , ’ he said , with an impatient bite at the handkerchief in which his hand was wrapped , ‘ you had better take and fire a loaded gun at me. ’ ‘ But I love you , <NAME> , ’ cried Mrs. Heep .

But while that Press has its evil eye in every house , and its black hand in every appointment in the state , from a president to a postman ; while , with ribald slander for its only stock in trade , it is the standard literature of an enormous class , who must find their reading in a newspaper
She was much startled , on returning home one night , to find that Mrs <NAME> had commanded an announcement to be prepared , to the effect that the stupendous collection would only remain in its present quarters one day longer ; in fulfilment of which threat ( for all announcements connected with public amusements are well known to be
When his hollow voice broke silence , they all three started .
‘ Well ; if you are curious to know , of course I have no objection. ’ Ever willing to sacrifice his own feelings to the wishes of his friend , <NAME> at once took a pretty long taste .
<NAME> laid his hand upon his shoulder .
They naturally supposed me to have toppled in , drunk , when I crept to the public-house it belonged to ; for I had no notion where I was , and could not articulate -- through the poison that had made me insensible having affected my speech -- and I supposed the night to be the previous night , as
Indeed , except in respect of staring about him ( a branch of the public service to which the pictorial cherub is much addicted ) , this domestic cherub discharged as many odd functions as his prototype ; with the difference , say , that he performed with a blacking-brush on the family ’ s boots , instead of performing
That travelled creation of the great satirist ’ s brain , who fresh from living among horses , peered from a high casement down upon his own kind with trembling horror , was scarcely more repelled and daunted by the sight , than those who look upon some of these faces for the first time must surely be .
Such were the thoughts -- if to visions so imperfect and undefined as those which wandered through his enfeebled brain , the term can be applied -- which were present to the mind of <NAME> , and rendered him deaf alike to intimidation and persuasion .
At length all this was devoutly believed ; and the new sexton used to exhibit to the curious , for a trifling emolument , a good-sized piece of the church weathercock which had been accidentally kicked off by the aforesaid horse in his aerial flight , and picked up by himself in the churchyard , a year or two afterwards
The house was silent as the grave .
`` Man , '' said the <NAME> , `` if man you be in heart , not adamant , forbear that wicked cant until you have discovered What the surplus is , and Where it is .

'Did you tell him to lock her and bar her in ? '
His head was all on one side , and one of his eyes was half shut up , as if he were taking aim at something with an invisible gun .

Each boy is required to bring , sir , two suits of clothes , six shirts , six pair of stockings , two nightcaps , two pocket-handkerchiefs , two pair of shoes , two hats , and a razor. ’ ‘ A razor ! ’ exclaimed <NAME> , as they walked into the next box .
If any class deserve to be protected and assisted by the Government , it is that class who are banished from their native land in search of the bare means of subsistence .
Outside a stable door at the bottom of a long back lane without a thoroughfare , a groom in undress was idling about , apparently persuading himself that he was doing something with a spade and a wheel-barrow .
I learned , that , when he was past creeping out of bed to open it , and past assuring himself of its safety by means of the divining rod I had seen him use , he had required to have it placed on the chair at the bed-side , where he had ever since embraced it , night and

<NAME> <NAME> ’ s manner towards Mrs Boffin at this time , was more the manner of a young man towards a mother , than that of a Secretary towards his employer ’ s wife .
Who should we bury , <NAME> ? ’ returned the sexton .
'You have borne more , and have been , through all , the best and gentlest creature that ever shed happiness on every one she knew , ' said Mrs. Maylie , embracing her tenderly .
The dwarf ’ s lodging on <NAME> hill comprised , besides the needful accommodation for himself and <NAME> , a small sleeping-closet for that lady ’ s mother , who resided with the couple and waged perpetual war with <NAME> ; of whom , notwithstanding , she stood in no slight dread .
<NAME> , without the least discomposure or surprise , but congratulating the old lady in an approving manner on being ‘ very lively to-night ’ , handed her back to her chair .
I hid my tears in the bedclothes , and pressed her from me with my hand , when she would have raised me up .

No veiled future dimly glanced upon him in the moonbeams .
There was the smiting of the rock , and the gushing forth of the waters ; and there was a temperate man with ‘ considerable of a hatchet ’ ( as the standard-bearer would probably have said ) , aiming a deadly blow at a serpent which was apparently about to spring upon him from the top of a barrel

The <NAME> paused a moment , as observing his condition , and giving him time to recover .

The <NAME> ’ s delight and wonder at the quiet housewifery of <NAME> in assisting to clear the table , arrange the parlour , and sweep up the hearth -- only to be equalled by the fervency of his protest when she began to assist him -- were gradually raised to that degree , that at last he could not

Many a night he vaguely and unhappily wandered there , when wine had brought no transitory gladness to him ; many a dreary daybreak revealed his solitary figure lingering there , and still lingering there when the first beams of the sun brought into strong relief , removed beauties of architecture in spires of churches and lofty buildings , as
‘ It ’ s better for me to be stupid than uncomfortable , isn ’ t it ? ’ said <NAME> .

All its disputes , all its ill-will and bad blood , rise up before you .
I arrived at <NAME> 's , to his surprise , yesterday evening ; we agreed that I would not present myself elsewhere until all was well , or unless I could be useful ; I present myself here , to beg a little talk with your brother .
He was greatly interested to hear that I knew <NAME> , and spoke of him with such warmth that I made him tell <NAME> what he thought of him .

Grandfather Smallweed inquires , slowly rubbing his legs .
The mother laid her work upon the table , and put her hand up to her face .

We were shut out that night , and sat at the iron gate , and walked about till morning .
My son -- my only son , <NAME> -- has been his brother ; Mrs. Squeers has been his mother , grandmother , aunt , -- ah !
‘ However , ’ said that fascinating gentleman , wiping his eyes again , ‘ if we go on in this way , we shall seem to be almost making game of Mr Riah , or of <NAME> and Co. Saint Mary Axe , or of somebody : which is far from our intention .
Your lodging ( which I have arranged for ) will be paid by me .
Long before we saw the sea , its spray was on our lips , and showered salt rain upon us .
‘ I am quite glad , ’ said <NAME> , arrived at her own door , ‘ to know you .
I believe I have as much influence with your Papa as anybody has .
He remained at the bottom , apparently drowned , for at least ten minutes .
'You do n't mean to say that 's the boy who had the fever , I hope ? '
I remarked that my mother , though she smiled when <NAME> looked at her , became more serious and thoughtful .
Permit me to say , <NAME> , that I highly admire your conduct , and extremely regret having caused you the inconvenience of this meeting , to no purpose. ’ ‘ I beg you won ’ t mention it , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
troubled me none the less because I went on .
It flattered him to picture to himself , this proud and stately woman doing the honours of his house , and chilling his guests after his own manner .
He lies a little turned away , but his eyes are surely open .
“ Why do n't you cry ? ” “ Because I do n't want to. ” “ You do , ” said she .
Just as anybody might. ’ ‘ Precisely so , ’ said <NAME> .
He looks to you , sir. ’ ‘ I do my best , <NAME> , ’ returned <NAME> , uneasily .
I wavered again , and began to think here were greater expectations than my own .
But I must not take that at a word .
‘ Now , darlings ! ’ said the gentleman with the black hair .
‘ How can I prevent his having his own way ? ’ began the dressmaker .
We alighted in a pleasant wood towards the middle of the day , dined on a fallen tree , and leaving our best fragments with a cottager , and our worst with the pigs ( who swarm in this part of the country like grains of sand on the sea-shore , to the great comfort of our commissariat in <NAME>
I feared you would think too much of what passed here just now .
So he remains , dodging and lurking about in the gloom of the staircase while they confer .
The Orfling was likewise accommodated with an inexpensive lodging in the same neighbourhood .
Among other items , <NAME> and <NAME> , solicitors , of <NAME> , were instructed by their client <NAME> , <NAME> , to address a letter to Mr <NAME> , enclosing the sum of twenty-four pounds nine shillings and eightpence , being the amount of principal and interest computed at the rate of five per cent .
No words can describe the <NAME> ’ s consternation at this sight .
And they appended to their verdict , a recommendation to the <NAME> ( which Mr Inspector appeared to think highly sensible ) , to offer a reward for the solution of the mystery .
She passed the scene of the struggle -- yonder it was , on her left , well over the boat ’ s stern -- she passed on her right , the end of the village street , a hilly street that almost dipped into the river ; its sounds were growing faint again , and she slackened ; looking as
In so vast a country , where there are thousands of millions of acres of land yet unsettled and uncleared , and on every rood of which , vegetable decomposition is annually taking place ; where there are so many great rivers , and such opposite varieties of climate ; there can not fail to be a great amount of
If none of the new family were particularly at home in private , it was resolved that <NAME> at least should be at home in public , without delay .
See if <NAME> is in the lodge , and beg him to come to me. ’ All the guests were now in consternation , and everybody rose .
No man thinks of walking in this desolate place , or of turning it to any account .
Why , he knows you have come home .
Numbers of people were lost in the <NAME> Office .
<NAME> <NAME> looked mildly at <NAME> , and said -- ‘ I should like to speak to you in private .
<NAME> <NAME> , ' said the Jew , trembling ; 'do n't speak so loud ! '
But there was the sun shining and there were the birds singing , as the sun only shines and the birds only sing on holidays and half-holidays ; there were the trees waving to all free boys to climb and nestle among their leafy branches ; the hay , entreating them to come and scatter it to the pure air
<NAME> as the counting-house dial , which he maintained to be the best time-keeper in <NAME> next after the clock of some old , hidden , unknown church hard by , ( for <NAME> held the fabled goodness of that at the <NAME> to be a pleasant fiction , invented by jealous West-enders , ) the old clerk performed the
The name of that lady no longer appeared on the flaming door-plate , that of <NAME> being substituted in its stead ; but the bonnets and dresses were still dimly visible in the first-floor windows by the decaying light of a summer ’ s evening , and excepting this ostensible alteration in the proprietorship , the establishment wore its old
So sometimes I put a quiet tea at the window here , with a little quiet contemplation of the <NAME> ( which comes soothing ) , between the day , and domestic -- ’ ‘ <NAME> , ’ suggested <NAME> , sorrowfully .
My own two hands , and feet likewise , being very cold , however , on this particular occasion , I crept below at midnight .
‘ Let me do something for you , at least , ’ said <NAME> .
At that meal , for which he had no appetite , everything was quite as solemn and genteel as at the others ; and when it was finished , he followed <NAME> upstairs .
You might point out to her that she probably would , in good time , find a husband at <NAME> by whom she would not be -- '' <NAME> adds , after a moment 's consideration , `` dragged from the altars of her forefathers . ''
And gradually , what I had done at random , seemed to shape itself into a purpose , <NAME> ” “ What purpose ? ” the spy asked .
She hesitates , but he motions again , and she sits down .
<NAME> , who had stimulated this anxiety by his hard reserve of manner , and who had begun to understand his man very well , replied with an air ; as if he were saying something extraordinarily generous and great : ‘ Mr Boffin , I never bargain. ’ ‘ So I should have thought of you ! ’ said
But it might have been. ’ ‘ Of how much ? ’ ‘ Oh !
Mr Carker the Manager treats no one ; neither is he treated ; but alone in his own room he shows his teeth all day ; and it would seem that there is something gone from Mr <NAME> ’ s path -- some obstacle removed -- which clears his way before him .
Yet every one had had enough , and the youngest Cratchits in particular , were steeped in sage and onion to the eyebrows !
You can not fail to know that she is far below him. ’ ‘ Raise her up ! ’ said <NAME> .
‘ But by G -- , sir , there is offence , ’ said the other , interrupting him , ‘ when you intrude yourself upon a couple of gentlemen who are particularly engaged. ’ ‘ I had no intention to offend , ’ said the old man , looking anxiously at the cards .
Hereupon the coachman , and the guard , and <NAME> , and <NAME> , and <NAME> , and all the hostlers , and every one of the idlers , who are more in number than all the others put together , shout for the missing gentlemen as loud as they can bawl .
`` I am away on leave this day -- should have been gone in another hour -- and that is to smooth it over , for my selling out .
They apply so happily to the late case that <NAME> has come from the library to my <NAME> 's room expressly to read them aloud .
This would not do , it was quite clear .
‘ Do you mean mine ? ’ asked <NAME> .
From him , ’ she said , with a laugh .
A little while , and he was always in pursuit of her , and he and I crossed one another every day .
Unseen by the spy , <NAME> stood at his side , and touched him on the shoulder like a ghostly bailiff .
But , <NAME> , if your object is to find her , and to have her here , myself and the <NAME> will produce her with every dispatch that devotion on my part , and great intelligence on the <NAME> ’ s , can ensure. ’ Mr <NAME> was so manifestly delighted and revived by the prospect of being useful
`` Let me see , <NAME> , '' said I , pretending to consider .
The removal of <NAME> Dorrit herself from their customary association , did not mend the matter .
There were samples of cheap clocks , and samples of cheap vases of flowers .
The letter had made no difference between us except that the seat by his side had come to be mine ; it made none now .
`` That 's a bad presentiment , mother . ''
He receives these salutations with gravity and buries them along with the rest of his knowledge .
Having seen him safely carried into the hotel , he turned his face homewards , running as fast as he could , to make up for lost time : and recalling with a great deal of astonishment and some fear , the extraordinary behaviour of the person from whom he had just parted .
I am subject to -- gout '' -- <NAME> was going to say indisposition and would have said it to anybody else , but <NAME> palpably knows all about it -- '' and recent circumstances have brought it on . ''
Her father thought so as he looked at her .
As he spoke , there was another great cry of pity from the beach ; four men arose with the wreck out of the deep , clinging to the rigging of the remaining mast ; uppermost , the active figure with the curling hair .
I was there , as I have mentioned , at all hours .
Now , I no longer Weep for the hour , When to <NAME> bower , The <NAME> of the valley with offers came ; Neither does the moon hide her light From the heavens to-night , And weep behind her clouds o ’ er any individual in the present <NAME> ’ s shame .
He cast himself on the grass by the <NAME> side , in an indolent way , with his back in that direction , and , having gathered a few blades , fell to chewing them .
Early in the afternoon the subdued sound of his heavy military trot is heard on the turf in the avenue as he rides on with imaginary clank and jingle of accoutrements under the old elm-trees .
Mrs. <NAME> curtseyed and smiled , and curtseyed again , and remarked , rubbing her hands as she did so , that she hadn ’ t the -- really -- the honour to -- ‘ To know us , ’ said the first gentleman .
The talking-over stranger , Mr Venus. ’ ‘ Is that any one I know ? ’ inquires the staring Secretary .
I am well aware , sir , of the many demands upon your time , and its -- ha -- enormous value , ’ Mr Dorrit could not say enormous roundly enough for his own satisfaction .
‘ He had hardly read it when he was called away .
It is something so new to Pleasant to see her father an object of sympathy and interest , to find any one very willing to tolerate his society in this world , not to say pressingly and soothingly entreating him to belong to it , that it gives her a sensation she never experienced before .
Nothing can change them , or prevent them coming back. ’ ‘ I do not understand , ’ said <NAME> , gazing on her agitated face which seemed to darken as she looked .
Two minutes hence may be too late .
How can I get that reading , <NAME> ?
At the foot of a flight of steps , leading to the house door , which was guarded on either side by an <NAME> aloe in a green tub , the sedan- chair stopped .
It was nearly midnight when they rushed out , wild , burning with wine , their blood boiling , and their brains on fire , to the gaming-table .
<NAME> , having taken the pony to a neighbouring stable , was at work at a desk in this room , which had a brass frame on the top to hang paper upon , and on which the writing he was making a copy of was then hanging .
‘ How should you like to be my number two , Nelly ? ’ ‘ To be what , sir ? ’ ‘ My number two , Nelly , my second , my Mrs Quilp , ’ said the dwarf .
As we walked to and fro , all four together , before breakfast , I deemed it right to recount what I had seen .
Now , Mr <NAME> ’ s gentleman has it whispered in his ear that this witness is disposed to be friendly to the prisoner -- which , to say the truth , he is rather glad to hear , as his strength is considered to lie in what is familiarly termed badgering .
‘ How you frightened me ! ’ ‘ I meant to , you jade , ’ returned the dwarf .
‘ I make false statements , it appears ?
<NAME> was taken off in an instant , with a blessing from his mother , and a scream from little <NAME> , ringing in his ears .
‘ I didn ’ t tell her who you were , either , or where you ’ d seen her .
There seemed to be something very comical in the reputation of <NAME> of <NAME> , for both the gentlemen laughed heartily when he was mentioned , and <NAME> was a good deal amused also .
Now , you know , there ’ s a struggle going on when that ’ s the case .
I remember the place well. ’ Looking very curiously round it .
She does n't notice a word !
Self-elected saints with gloomy brows , this sightless , earless , voiceless child may teach you lessons you will do well to follow .
I believe there was not a soul in the place , except myself , who knew that she did it purposely to wound and gall me !
When she reached it , she looked back and saw the head of <NAME> peeping out of the low wooden passage , where she had issued her parting injunctions ; likewise the fist of <NAME> Mrs Brown shaking towards her .
<NAME> training is always desirable , whether the race be for place , cup , or sweepstakes . '
Many flaunting dolls had to be gaily dressed , before the money was in the dressmaker ’ s pocket to get mourning for Mr Dolls .
The poor side , you say ?
The <NAME> , after bowing his head with great reverence , stared all round the circle , beginning with Mr Toots , and ending with the Instrument-maker ; then gravely said : ‘ <NAME> !
He made that promise when he proposed these curious interviews , and has kept it so faithfully and pleasantly , that if I ever felt any trifling uneasiness about them in the beginning ( which I don ’ t think I did , <NAME> ; his manner was so plain and true ) it very soon vanished , and left
' ” He was drawing his hand from his breast ; the prisoner chancing to look up in his hurried wonder as he wrote , the hand stopped , closing upon something .
In about ten minutes ' time , <NAME> was seized with a fit of coughing ; upon which <NAME> pulled her shawl over her shoulders , and declared it was time to go .
'Only think , ' said <NAME> , shrugging his shoulders , and stretching out his hands ; 'only consider .
I thought I had read in his face that he would like to speak to me alone .
'You were not suspected of holding any communication with anybody on the subject which has brought us here to-night , I hope ? '
‘ <NAME> , ’ returns <NAME> , with his wristbands bristling a little , ‘ <NAME> repeat the word ; I repeat the word .
Would you ! ’ <NAME> had caught him round the body .
She sees nothing and hears nothing .
It was with some difficulty that she could be induced to go back with the excuse ; but the promise of being told a story -- of old her great delight -- on condition that she concentrated her faculties upon the errand and left her little mistress to herself for an hour longer , combined with a misgiving on <NAME>
‘ For no better reason , truly , than because I was thinking , ’ he said , after a pause , ‘ of something like it , when it came by .
She is gone with me upon a distant voyage .
<NAME> times , ’ said <NAME> , thrice throwing out his left hand with all its fingers spread , and doing it so rapidly that the sense of sight could hardly follow the action , ‘ I ask of him in every place where go the foreigners ; and fifteen times , ’ repeating the same swift performance , ‘
What you say now , gives me new heart. ’ She faltered , and burst into tears .
I know your tricks and your manners , my friend ! ’ ‘ <NAME> ’ s sister , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ is not come home yet ? ’ ‘ You are quite a conjuror , ’ returned <NAME> .
‘ You needn ’ t mind me. ’ ‘ To answer it in person , however inconvenient the journey , ’ pursued <NAME> , ‘ rather than by letter .
‘ He ’ s here , sir , ’ rejoined Mr Swiveller .
At least , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ you are known to be alive and unharmed .
The effect of this ceremonial was for some quarter of an hour afterwards perfectly paralyzing on the neighbours , and was much enhanced by the worthy lady airing herself for that term in a kind of splendidly serene trance on the top step .
And me bound , too , to a born devil that only wants the will , and has the power to , to -- ' Panting for breath , the old man stammered for a word ; and in that instant checked the torrent of his wrath , and changed his whole demeanour .
I am not one of your players of music , stage actors , writers of books , or painters of pictures , who assume a station that the laws of their country don ’ t recognise .
There was one little ceremony peculiar to the day , both the matter and manner of which made a very strong impression upon <NAME> .
The child he was nursing stretched forth its arms and cried out to be taken by <NAME> .
I am as obstinate as one , I am more stupid than one , I get as much pleasure as one , and I should like to kick like one. ’ ‘ Not me , I hope , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , <NAME> ; I wouldn ’ t hurt _you_ .
I only know that I don ’ t like it .
I will not say ( whatever I may think ) that this affair has been got up solely to degrade and insult me .
One of her sisterhood knitted beside her .
<NAME> <NAME> , like a tall tower in a flat country , seemed to project himself across the table-cloth , hide the light from the honourable Member , cool the honourable Member ’ s marrow , and give him a woeful idea of distance .
‘ Not if you are ready , <NAME> , my dear. ’ ‘ Well ! ’ exclaimed <NAME> , delighted .
Little Em ’ ly had overcome her shyness , and was sitting by my side upon the lowest and least of the lockers , which was just large enough for us two , and just fitted into the chimney corner .
‘ Say what you have to say ; it ’ s the old story , I suppose ? ’ ‘ With a difference , my dear <NAME> ; with a difference , ’ rejoined <NAME> , deliberately folding up the paper and putting it into his pocket again .
This earth looked spectral , and so did the pale stars : while the cold eastern glare , expressionless as to heat or colour , with the eye of the firmament quenched , might have been likened to the stare of the dead .
I will take you there directly , without a minute 's loss of time .
I sincerely believe that in all the madness of <NAME> politics , few public men would have been so earnestly , devotedly , and affectionately caressed , as this most charming writer : and I have seldom respected a public assembly more , than I did this eager throng , when I saw them turning with one mind from noisy
Jinks , ’ said the magistrate , ‘ you ’ re a fool. ’ <NAME> looked humbly at the great man , and bit the top of his pen .
`` And I want you , <NAME> , '' said I , shaking my head , `` to understand some one else . ''
I really will , you know ! ’ she answered .
And she may have the pain of knowing that he does so . '
I need scarcely ask you. ’ ‘ Quite , <NAME> ’ r <NAME> , ’ he returned ; ‘ and told <NAME> ’ ly .
So this calling follows the rest .
‘ I am going on , Mr Headstone , don ’ t you be afraid .
I don ’ t mean -- Heaven forbid ! -- that you intended it ; but you hardly know with what a sudden swing you removed yourself from me. ’ ‘ However ! ’ said the boy , taking no heed of the remonstrance , and pursuing his own mortified disappointment , ‘ I know what this means , and
He is very low and wretched at not having heard from his father. ’ ‘ Low , is he ? ’ said the old gentlemen .
Sometimes when I raise my eyes and see her in the black dress that she still wears , teaching my <NAME> , I feel -- it is difficult to express -- as if it were so good to know that she remembers her dear Esther in her prayers .
The old lady kissed her hand , gave another skip , smirked and sidled down the gallery in a most extraordinary manner , and ambled gracefully into her own bed-chamber .
She caught the hand which <NAME> instinctively placed in hers , and , blowing out the light , drew him after her up the stairs .
‘ This was the period , about three months after she had commenced , that the first report of her case was made , in which it was stated that “ she has just learned the manual alphabet , as used by the deaf mutes , and it is a subject of delight and wonder to see how rapidly ,
`` He has none , and no anger .
If I was to tell you how I found out this word , you ’ d believe that .
The young gentleman uttered this exultant sound with mysterious significance .
For I naturally said , `` Esther !
To whom , in a few easy words adapted to his capacity , <NAME> stated the question at issue .
In <NAME> 's name why should you kneel to me ! ” “ For the truth .
What botanical blotches would he cheerfully stick upon his cheek , or forehead , if the dear old lady convicted him of an imperceptible pimple there !
The coach , with <NAME> inside , came up in due time , and I took my box-seat again , and arrived in <NAME> safe , -- but not sound , for my heart was gone .
<NAME> <NAME> paid , the door was unbolted , and out they came ; the uncombed gentleman bestowing a friendly nod upon <NAME> , who happened to be passing at the moment .
<NAME> hands have strewn the ground deep with snow , that the lightest footstep may be lighter yet ; and the very birds are dead , that they may not wake her .
<NAME> <NAME> understood her quite as well as if she had said a thousand .
<NAME> remind me of them to-morrow. ’ Little <NAME> was not without doubts how Mr <NAME> might take their patronage ; but she promised not to fail in the reminder .
‘ Go , deceiver , go , some day , <NAME> , p ’ r ’ aps you ’ ll waken , from pleasure ’ s dream to know , the grief of orphans forsaken .
Self-acting ink , that ‘ ere ; it ’ s wrote your mark upon the wall , old gen ’ l ’ m ’ n .
He would have made a wonderful cabinet-maker , said <NAME> , ‘ if there had been the money to put him to it. ’ She had seen him handle tools that he had borrowed to mend the mangle , or to knock a broken piece of furniture together , in a surprising manner .
'So I _do_ do as she bids me , ' replied <NAME> ; ' I should n't have been milled , if it had n't been for her advice .
Much as if one nostril was caught up with a horse-hair and a little fish-hook .
A white figure advancing along this path , proved to be nothing more ghostly than Mr Boffin , easily attired for the pursuit of knowledge , in an undress garment of short white smock-frock .
said <NAME> , caustically ; after an attentive perusal of <NAME> 's features .
‘ Dear Little Dorrit , it is not my imprisonment only that will soon be over .
Do ye gang whoam wi ’ me , and do yon loight an ’ toight young whipster look sharp out for a brokken head , next time he cums under my hond. ’ ‘ Mercy on us , what ’ s all this ? ’ cried <NAME> , in affected astonishment .
‘ Now , I ask you , ’ said Mr Meagles in the blandest confidence , falling back a step himself , and handing his daughter a step forward to illustrate his question : ‘ I ask you simply , as between man and man , you know , DID you ever hear of such damned nonsense as putting <NAME>
You are not more than ordinarily honourable , perhaps ? ” I announce myself , “ <NAME> , a gentleman from the birth , and a gentleman to the death ; but _not_ more than ordinarily honourable .
you know ! ’ The <NAME> , with responsive gravity and mystery , immediately waved his hook towards the little parlour , whither Mr <NAME> followed him .
‘ N -- no , ’ returned <NAME> , shaking his head at once observantly , thoughtfully , and playfully .
`` I am well known to be prudent , '' says <NAME> , composedly smoking .
This is a charming spot , is the <NAME> , but you must get to apprechiate it by degrees .
Mr Toots , who had been detained by an important letter from the <NAME> of <NAME> , found <NAME> out after a time ; and having looked at him for a long while , as before , inquired if he was fond of waistcoats .
‘ Was it property that we ever thought of ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , ’ cried Mrs. <NAME> , ‘ I scorn it. ’ ‘ So do I , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ and always did. ’ ‘ My feelings have been lancerated , ’ said Mrs. <NAME> , ‘ my heart has been torn asunder with anguish ,
'It make you nervous , <NAME> , -- reminds you of being nabbed , does it ? '
As Mr <NAME> was somewhat noisily getting his steam up for departure , he concluded by asking that gentleman if he would walk with him ?
I suppose I shall hear a knock here .
Glancing at the angry eyes which now avoid him and at the angry figure trembling from head to foot , yet striving to be still , <NAME> feels his way with his forefinger and in a low voice proceeds .
Oh , dem , dem , dem ! ’ The woman looked , first at <NAME> , and then at <NAME> , as if uncertain on whom to visit this extraordinary behaviour ; but Mr Mantalini happening by ill-luck to thrust his nose from under the bedclothes , in his anxiety to ascertain whether the visitors were gone , she
Now , what ’ ll you read on ? ’ ‘ Thank you , sir , ’ returned <NAME> , as if there were nothing new in his reading at all .
One other singularity was that nobody with a mission -- except <NAME> , whose mission , as I think I have formerly said , was to be in ecstasies with everybody 's mission -- cared at all for anybody 's mission .
Mrs. <NAME> shook her head mournfully , as if deploring the mental blindness of those paupers who did not know it ; and thrusting a silver spoon ( private property ) into the inmost recesses of a two-ounce tin tea-caddy , proceeded to make the tea .
‘ We have no <NAME> left , positively , ’ said <NAME> , advancing her shrivelled ear ; for Mr <NAME> was saying something to <NAME> .
On glancing at the address , the parochial functionary observed that it contained no name .
<NAME> , I wonder you have never turned your thoughts to emigration. ’ ‘ <NAME> , ’ returned <NAME> , ‘ it was the dream of my youth , and the fallacious aspiration of my riper years. ’ I am thoroughly persuaded , by the by , that he had never thought of it in his life .
I am not clear , Mr Boffin , but that the hive may be satirical. ’ ‘ At all events , they work , ’ said Mr Boffin .
I was not insensible , indeed .
What I suffered from that placard , nobody can imagine .
In a short pause which ensued , she had a fancy that she felt <NAME> touch her hair , and that with no ungentle hand ; but , looking at her , in her timid hope , she found that lady sitting with the skirt of her dress tucked up , her hands folded on one knee , and her
‘ Em ’ ly is like me , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ and would like to see him. ’ Em ’ ly was confused by our all observing her , and hung down her head , and her face was covered with blushes .
That gentleman has lost his senses , and I am the unhappy cause. ’ ‘ YOU the cause ! ’ said <NAME> , greatly astonished .
It has aged me , tired me , vexed me , disappointed me .
Now Mr Headstone , as Mr <NAME> has been obliged to hear what I had to say , and couldn ’ t help himself , and as I have said it out to the last word , we have done all we wanted to do , and may go. ’ ‘ Go down-stairs , and leave me a moment ,
It ’ s nigh six in the morning. ’ ‘ Is it though ?
A sedan chair was kept inside the railing before the <NAME> ’ s <NAME> , but it had never come out within the memory of man ; and on fine mornings , the top of every rail ( there were eight-and-forty , as <NAME> had often counted ) was decorated with a pewter-pot .
‘ <NAME> ’ t alarm me at the very beginning .
You may know the name. ’ ‘ Never heard of it. ’ Mrs <NAME> said it , and Mr <NAME> echoed it .
‘ Now , <NAME> , ’ cried <NAME> , quite unconscious that there was anything the matter .
This was a quieter time ; for he would come and look over the writer ’ s shoulder , and tell him mildly to observe how such a letter was turned in such a copy on the wall , praise such an up-stroke here and such a down-stroke there , and bid him take it for his model .
We are not ignorant , sir , ’ said <NAME> , slowly shaking his little head again , ‘ down in our part of the country , of your fame .
So that some of us thinks he ’ s peeping out towards where his own country is , and some of us thinks he ’ s looking for somebody he don ’ t want to see , and some of us don ’ t know what to think. ’ Mr <NAME> seemed to have a general understanding of what she
If there ’ s a bad thing to be done , can it ever be Patroned and Patronessed right ?
Now whether the tall horse , in the natural playfulness of his disposition , was desirous of having a little innocent recreation with <NAME> , or whether it occurred to him that he could perform the journey as much to his own satisfaction without a rider as with one , are points upon which , of course , we can
<NAME> has been done , to which you were morally if not really a party . '
<NAME> , don ’ t deny that. ’ ‘ Yes , I believe she is considered so , ’ replied <NAME> .
“ But my dear young friend , ” said <NAME> , “ you must be hungry , you must be exhausted .
To which <NAME> retorts , `` I say so ! ''
And <NAME> , with another short laugh of the purest glee , made her eyes very round again and looked as serious as became my maid .
I have been stinted of education , liberty , money , dress , the very necessaries of life , the commonest pleasures of childhood , the commonest possessions of youth .
‘ Except that it is a fire , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ it looks to me as stupid and blank as everything else looks .
I understood him to add that she was parting amidships , and I could readily suppose so , for the rolling and beating were too tremendous for any human work to suffer long .
I have been alone , and indifferent to it .
But , perhaps , nobody 's ever did ?
But he slept out of the house too , at his mother ’ s lodging ; and before I had gone many hundred yards , came up with me .
I understand your allusion , my love .
I shall come to no harm .
something of that sort , ' replied <NAME> .
<NAME> , my dear young friend , with three lumps of sugar to the tumbler. ’ ‘ Wery sorry to say , sir , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ that they don ’ t allow that particular wanity to be sold in this here establishment. ’ ‘ Oh , the hardness of heart of these inveterate men ! ’ ejaculated
It had an official look , however , and there was nothing merely ornamental to be seen .
A hurry and contradiction pervaded all his thoughts .
think I was ; * fired a musket -- fired with an idea -- rushed into wine shop -- wrote it down -- back again -- whiz , bang -- another idea -- wine shop again -- pen and ink -- back again -- cut and slash -- noble time , <NAME> .
I am sure I can not imagine what the cause of it is .
But they reached their journey ’ s end at last ; and there , in a front room , looking over the wild sea , <NAME> showed him a nice little bed with white hangings , close to the window , on which there was already beautifully written on a card in round text -- down strokes very thick ,
‘ <NAME> , ’ replied the unwelcome visitor .
I will not disgrace your recommendation .
‘ I assure you , ’ said <NAME> , taking his arm , ‘ that I think myself very lucky they did not owe all the money instead of being sixpence short .
'Why , a beak 's a madgst'rate ; and when you walk by a beak 's order , it 's not straight forerd , but always agoing up , and niver a coming down agin .
‘ You don ’ t appear to understand me , <NAME> ! ’ observed old Sol .
I have been in prison for contempt of court .
`` And could n't <NAME> , the sergeant , see that my door was locked ? ''
They all returned his look .
But upon my soul I can ’ t make flourishes , and I would rather be disappointed than try. ’ If he meant to follow home what was in <NAME> ’ s thoughts , it was skilfully done .
And it really did me good , for though nobody but <NAME> and I knew anything about it , I somehow felt as if it had diminished the separation between <NAME> and me and had brought us together again for those moments .
‘ “ My love , ” said the baron .

`` Begging your pardon for interrupting you a moment ? ''
And so , indeed , it proved , for the <NAME> gradually coming to herself ; and asking with wild emotion , ‘ <NAME> dear , are you safe ? ’ and further , ‘ George love , what has happened ?
He wound his arms round the old man ’ s body , and held him back .
Has nothing but cold water to drink , and never feels thirsty ( great applause ) .
‘ <NAME> , <NAME> ; don ’ t you like him now ? ’ Without returning any direct reply , <NAME> , all at once , fell into a paroxysm of spiteful tears , and exclaimed that she was a wretched , neglected , miserable castaway .
‘ Now , gentlemen , ’ said <NAME> , looking at them attentively .
<NAME> 's business was the swindling , handwriting forging , stolen bank-note passing , and such-like .
The scientific gentleman was a bachelor .
“ If you were to go before , ” said <NAME> , “ and stop the vehicle and horses from coming here , and were to wait somewhere for me ; would n't that be best ? ” <NAME> thought it might be best .
‘ Come , dear boy ! ’ said <NAME> .
O , if you could know how faithful , you would almost pity me for being so far away and being so grand !
That which promised happiness when we were one in heart , is fraught with misery now that we are two .
Because you hadn ’ t cleared his father to him , and you ought to have done it .
said my guardian , looking back over his shoulder half angrily ; only half angrily , for he never seemed to consider <NAME> an accountable being .

‘ Good-bye , Loo. ’ She gave him an affectionate good-night , and went out with him to the door , whence the fires of <NAME> could be seen , making the distance lurid .
‘ “ What is it , my dear ? ” said my uncle , looking in at the coach window .
The lanterns glimmered , as the men ran to and fro ; the horses ’ hoofs clattered on the uneven paving of the yard ; the chaise rumbled as it was drawn out of the coach-house ; and all was noise and bustle .
I tell him again , much he cares about the truth. ’ ‘ Our connexion being at an end , Mr Boffin , ’ said the Secretary , ‘ it can be of very little moment to me what you say. ’ ‘ Oh !
You 'll lose your temper with the whole round of 'em , again and again ; and I shall take you on a score of warrants yet , if I have luck . ''
‘ <NAME> ’ t be alarmed , ’ cried <NAME> , running down ; ‘ here it is ; it ’ s all out , it ’ s all over ; pray compose yourselves ; there ’ s no harm done ; ’ and with these , and a thousand other assurances , he delivered the baby ( whom ,
'The game of that is , that they always leave it open with a catch , so that the dog , who 's got a bed in here , may walk up and down the passage when he feels wakeful .
‘ These two gentlemen have ordered supper in an hour ’ s time , ’ she said , taking her into the bar ; ‘ and your best plan will be to sup with them .
‘ <NAME> d ’ ye do , old fellow ? ’ This was a rival trainer of young noblemen and gentlemen , and the person of all others whom <NAME> most hated and dreaded to meet .
He never thought of <NAME> .
He had glittering eyes , -- small , keen , and black , -- and thin wide mottled lips .
<NAME> ’ s eyes followed him to the door , lighted on Mr Boffin complacently thrown back in his easy chair , and drooped over her book .
So when the coachman came round for his fee , he pleasantly asked him what he considered a very good fee indeed , now -- a liberal one -- and on his replying half a crown for a single passenger , said it was little enough too , all things considered , and left <NAME> to give it him .
‘ What ! ’ said Mr Carker , who had heard this .
A carriage at the gate , and <NAME> ’ s man arrives , looking rather like a spurious <NAME> and an unacknowledged member of that gentleman ’ s family .
‘ And now , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , consulting a large double-faced silver watch that hung at the end of the copper chain .
I didn ’ t before I was married ; but I do now , because <NAME> does .
It has been too short and easy .
I therefore hope , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ that you can make yourself happy in those relations. ’ ‘ I should have nothing to wish , sir , if— ’ ‘ I understand you , ’ said <NAME> ; ‘ you still refer to your father .
They would have talked to me too , but I held back , and moped in my corner ; scared by their love-making and hilarity , though it was far from boisterous , and almost wondering that no judgement came upon them for their hardness of heart .
<NAME> , dear , I am changed .
‘ I entered on his lodgings t ’ other day , chiefly because I had seen this very board .
We learnt , however , as the time went on , that a new application was made to the <NAME> on <NAME> 's behalf as an infant and a ward , and I do n't know what , and that there was a quantity of talking , and that the <NAME> Chancellor described him in open court as a vexatious
However opinions may differ on a variety of subjects , I should think it would be universally agreed , <NAME> , that I am not much to boast of . ''
Here <NAME> is much dismayed by the graces and accomplishments of his nieces that are and by the beauty of <NAME> , his niece that is to be , and by the affectionate salutations of these young ladies , which he receives in a sort of dream .
<NAME> had not been idle , for there was a little cart at the door , and the effects were hurrying out already .
‘ Be thankful for me , if you have a kind heart , as I think you have , ’ she said , ‘ that while I know well what I am , I can be cheerful and endure it all .
He was going to <NAME> and to <NAME> as a surgeon on board ship .

As one might go to survey the weather and the general aspect of the heavenly bodies .
‘ For her own sake , ’ repeated <NAME> , warming , ‘ and for her brother ’ s , and as a perfectly disinterested person. ’ ‘ Really , <NAME> , ’ remarked the dressmaker , ‘ since it comes to this , we must positively turn you with your face to the wall. ’ She had hardly done

As they proceed with great gravity through the streets towards the region of <NAME> , <NAME> , observing his companion to be thoughtful , considers it a friendly part to refer to Mrs. Bagnet 's late sally .
‘ Disappointed ? ’ he went on , as he walked between them under the trees .
His tone is no less sorrowfully echoed by his new acquaintance .
If the <NAME> proposed to new skylight the market-place , the <NAME> got up public meetings , and denounced the proceeding ; if the <NAME> proposed the erection of an additional pump in the <NAME> , the <NAME> rose as one man and stood aghast at the enormity .

Several times she has gone out early , and been absent until evening .
<NAME> ’ t moddley-coddley , there ’ s a good fellow .
<NAME> <NAME> ’ s coarse and insulting behaviour on the occasion in question had produced a deep impression on his mind ; a strong suspicion of his having led him on to pursue <NAME> for purposes of his own , had been lurking there for some time ; he was really ashamed of his share in the transaction , and
That Mr <NAME> was himself perplexed , and that in no small degree , by the contents of the letter , was sufficiently obvious .
‘ What is the matter ? ’ asked her visitor .
But one morning when she happened to come upon him suddenly , from a by-path among some pollard willows which terminated in the little shelving piece of stony ground that lay between his dwelling and the water , where he was bending over a fire he had made to caulk the old boat which was lying bottom upwards , close
The common welfare was my business ; charity , mercy , forbearance , and benevolence , were , all , my business .
That he was well known in the neighbourhood , and enjoyed the reputation of having sold himself to the devil , I soon understood from the visits he received from the boys , who continually came skirmishing about the shop , shouting that legend , and calling to him to bring out his gold .
But , thinking that the Jew , being so much his senior , must know best , he followed him quietly to the table , and was soon deeply involved in his new study .
‘ Which of ‘ em have you got in that lot ? ’ asked Mr Boffin .
`` I hope not , guardian , '' said I .
‘ Avay vith melincholly , as the little boy said ven his schoolmissus died .

As these things passed through his thoughts , he jumped upon his feet , and again walked forward .
So , <NAME> goes home to <NAME> , <NAME> ’ s , to take a plate of mutton broth with a chop in it , and a look at the marriage-service , in order that he may cut in at the right place to-morrow ; and he is low , and feels it dull over the livery stable-yard , and
‘ Come ! ’ said he , ‘ you know what you have engaged to do .
There will not be the smallest impropriety -- <NAME> , sir , is the very soul of honour .
How many years is it , ’ said <NAME> , pondering , ‘ since I first noticed him , quite a little child , dragging himself about on a pair of tiny crutches ?
The man was a bad man , and willing enough to be in his pay .
Imprisonment began to tell upon him .
‘ I say , ’ he proceeded , ‘ Miss Dombey !
<NAME> in return , requiring name of such <NAME> .
‘ Not there ! ’ cried <NAME> .
‘ Whatever possessed that poor unfortunate <NAME> , that she must go and be married again , ’ said my aunt , when I had finished , ‘ I can ’ t conceive. ’ ‘ Perhaps she fell in love with her second husband , ’ <NAME> suggested .
When <NAME> drew in his head again , his countenance was smiling and placid ; and , walking quietly back into the office , he declared that he had now removed a great weight from his mind , and that he felt perfectly comfortable and happy .
There are two establishments for boys in this same neighbourhood .
In one of these pauses of invention , the scientific gentleman was gazing abstractedly on the thick darkness outside , when he was very much surprised by observing a most brilliant light glide through the air , at a short distance above the ground , and almost instantaneously vanish .
Yes , for I am going ; ’ she said it as in prompt reply to something in his face ; ‘ to appeal to you. ’ Mr Dombey , with a slightly condescending bend of his chin that rustled and crackled his stiff cravat , sat down on a sofa that was near him , to hear the appeal
<NAME> sought to learn their secret ; sought to find out what it was she had missed ; what simple art they knew , and she knew not ; how she could be taught by them to show her father that she loved him , and to win his love again .
Never , never , never ! ’ He had a violent fit of trembling , and then sunk into his chair .
Uttering this exclamation in a tone of great surprise , as his eyes rested on <NAME> , <NAME> brought himself into a sitting posture , and demanded who that was .
Oliver having 'caught it , ' in fulfilment of <NAME> 's prediction , followed that young gentleman down the stairs to breakfast .
At that instant , <NAME> , who has been lying in wait for nothing else all along , says in a deep warning voice : ‘ Clara ! ’ My mother starts , colours , and smiles faintly .
It is the mode. ’ Though <NAME> ’ s back was turned while he spoke , and thenceforth to the end of the interview , he kept those glittering eyes of his that were too near together , upon him , and evidently saw in the very carriage of the head , as he passed with his braggart recklessness from
<NAME> peculiarities were easily to be detected by experienced eyes in Mr Doyce ’ s way of managing his affairs , but they almost always involved some ingenious simplification of a difficulty , and some plain road to the desired end .

There is some inconvenience in the necessity of writing <NAME> , ’ said Mr Dombey , making a fictitious autograph on his knee ; ‘ but it is merely of a private and personal complexion .
Oh , madam , if you have but one thought of him who sent me here , but one last lingering care for your own peace of mind and heart , I do for <NAME> ’ s sake urge you to give me a hearing. ’ She attempted to pass him , but <NAME> gently detained her .
‘ Why didn ’ t ‘ ee punch his head , or lay theeself doon and kick , and squeal out for the pollis ?
<NAME> <NAME> detained it while he murmured a profusion of compliments , which <NAME> , remembering what had passed between them , rightly considered as so many aggravations of the insult he had already put upon her .

Then he approached the window with dignity ; looking on at <NAME> ’ s news exactly as he had looked on at the dinners in that very room .
But , there was no loud irruption into the courtyard , as he had expected , and he heard the gate clash again , and all was quiet .
What are you stopping for ? ” said I .
So , leaving word with the shopman on what day I was wanted at <NAME> 's again , I set off on the four-mile walk to our forge ; pondering , as I went along , on all I had seen , and deeply revolving that I was a common laboring-boy ; that my hands were coarse ; that my
And so I worked at home and did cleaning and nursing and washing for a long time before I began to go out .
The trial had lasted all day , and the lamps in the court were now being lighted .

‘ I remember there were poles pushed out of upper windows on which clothes were drying , and I remember a low public-house , and the sound flowing down a narrow passage belonging to it of the scraping of a fiddle and the shuffling of feet .
You came down here , sir , to expose the treachery and falsehood of an individual on whose truth and honour you had placed implicit reliance -- eh ? ’ Here <NAME> indulged in a prolonged sneer ; and taking off his green spectacles -- which he probably found superfluous in his fit of jealousy -- rolled his little eyes
I do n't mean constant to <NAME> , for I love her dearly -- better and better every day -- but constant to myself .
But it was generally said that <NAME> was a woman of system with children ; and no doubt she was .
So he told it , and <NAME> was as much moved as amazed , and the dear fellow and I were not the worse friends for the long concealment .
Here ’ s a burial volume , just the thing !
She tried to recall the way they had come , and to look in the direction where the fire by which they had slept last night was burning .
But I am never fatigued .
What do you mean , boy ? ’ ‘ I ’ ll explain to you , then , ’ said the gentleman , after another and a dismal pause , ‘ why you wouldn ’ t paper a room with representations of horses .
Meanwhile , and pending the arrangement of the proceedings , and a fair division of the speechifying , the public in the large room were eyeing , by turns , the empty platform , and the ladies in the <NAME> .

Not that he spared her , or was fearful of her being spent by watching and fatigue ; he was not more troubled on that score than he had usually been .
<NAME> <NAME> , as I have already said , was grey-headed , and florid : I should have said all about him , in saying so , had not his head been curiously bowed -- not by age ; it reminded me of one of <NAME> ’ s boys ’ heads after a beating -- and his grey eyes prominent
<NAME> looked to such men as his good friend to do such things .
I had not at that time seen the ideal presentment of this chamber which has since gratified me so much , but I observed that one of our friends who had made the arrangements for our voyage , turned pale on entering , retreated on the friend behind him , smote his forehead involuntarily , and said below his breath
He had a great admiration for bright eyes , and sweet faces , and pretty legs and feet ; in short , he was fond of the whole sex .
Could any less idea shed the light already dawning on your early grave , or give birth to the softened sorrow that is springing into life beneath this rain of tears ! ’ ‘ My dear child , ’ said <NAME> , who held it as a duty incumbent on her , to improve the occasion , ‘ when you

‘ Bleeding Heart Yard ? ’ said <NAME> , with a puff and a snort .
Mr Witherden the notary , too , regarded him with a friendly eye ; and even Mr Chuckster would sometimes condescend to give him a slight nod , or to honour him with that peculiar form of recognition which is called ‘ taking a sight , ’ or to favour him with some other salute combining pleasantry with patronage .
She went up to the house , keeping within the shrubbery , and went round it , peeping between the leaves at the lower windows .
As to the divine <NAME> herself , she rubbed her hands as men of business do , and took a few turns up and down the office with her pen behind her ear .
I wish <NAME> was not so arbitrary , I wish it was not so exacting -- Bird , be quiet ! ’ The parrot had given a most piercing shriek , as if its name were <NAME> and it asserted its right to its exactions .

They resumed their journey ; and certainly the prospect before them was by no means encouraging .
As <NAME> knew enough of the place to know that he was required to remain in the Lodge a certain time , he took a seat in a corner , and feigned to be occupied with the perusal of letters from his pocket .
Clapping her hands with pleasure and running on before me for a short distance , my little acquaintance stopped at a door and remaining on the step till I came up knocked at it when I joined her .

He crossed by <NAME> ’ s and went down , at a long angle , almost to the water ’ s edge , through some of the crooked and descending streets which lie ( and lay more crookedly and closely then ) between the river and <NAME> .
The mistake is mine , no doubt , sir. ’ ‘ If you should see him first -- ’ said I .
I never did take anything from any one .
The <NAME> stepped back in this emergency , with more agility than could have been anticipated in a man of his apparent decrepitude ; and , seizing up the pot , prepared to hurl it at his assailant 's head .
<NAME> and <NAME> had been in a bad thing with a rich lady some years afore , and they 'd made a pot of money by it ; but <NAME> betted and gamed , and he 'd have run through the king 's taxes .
As much as to say , `` <NAME> , we remember your existence when you are not here to remind us of it by your presence .

The horror-stricken witness of this scene pressed his hands upon his ears , and with his eyes closed got up and paced violently to and fro , like one distracted .
What do you mean by leaving a man in this state , three weeks and more , you false-hearted wagabond ? '
It ’ s the best of old worlds !
‘ You never mean it ! ’ ‘ Mean what , <NAME> dear ? ’ ‘ Well !
Then <NAME> would appear , and the man would retire .
You feared that I should be beforehand with you .
Oliver leaned his head upon his hand when the old man disappeared , and pondered , with a trembling heart , on the words he had just heard .
He was a <NAME> , or something of that sort , if I am not mistaken .
It is better to be torn to pieces at a spring , than to be a mouse at the caprice of such a cat. ’ He looked at her so hard with those eyes too near together that the sinister sight of each , crossing that of the other , seemed to make the bridge of his hooked nose crooked
‘ Why , as to <NAME> , you see , ’ returned Mr Boffin , with his hand still to his chin , ‘ the odds are that <NAME> and me may never go upon the water .
‘ Very , ’ said <NAME> , with his mouth full .
I ’ ve been here before. ’ ‘ Did you Leave anything when you were here before ? ’ asked <NAME> , with a view to principal and interest .
Up came the sun to find him washed and brushed , methodically dressed in decent black coat and waistcoat , decent formal black tie , and pepper-and-salt pantaloons , with his decent silver watch in its pocket , and its decent hair-guard round his neck : a scholastic huntsman clad for the field , with his fresh pack yelping and
Slowly , therefore , and in a quiet tone of voice , he explained them as best he could , and enlarged on the nature of <NAME> ’ s service .
'More like the noise of powdering a iron bar on a nutmeg-grater , ' suggested <NAME> .

'Bayton , ' said the undertaker , looking from the scrap of paper to <NAME> .
When I had made this discovery , I went back , in an attraction I could not resist , to a lane by Mrs. <NAME> ’ s , and looked over the corner of the garden wall .
The evidence lay in a most remarkable manner , between those two .
It is a similar certificate , enabling him and his daughter and her child , at any time , to pass the barrier and the frontier !
Looking in , I saw a lighted candle on a table , a bench , and a mattress on a truckle bedstead .
You will please consider me your guardian .
Every one had a friendly nod and a kind word for “ poor Mrs. <NAME> ” ; and sometimes , when she stopped to exchange a few words with a neighbour at the conclusion of the service in the little row of elm-trees which leads to the church porch , or lingered behind to gaze with a mother ’ s
He is a most extraordinary old chap , sir .
The bare walls had been coloured green , evidently by an unskilled hand , and were poorly decorated with a few prints .

The enchanting <NAME> leaves a card .

‘ Very well , then , ’ said the old man ; ‘ make his bed .
At this early hour many sickly girls , whose business , like that of the poor worm , is to produce , with patient toil , the finery that bedecks the thoughtless and luxurious , traverse our streets , making towards the scene of their daily labour , and catching , as if by stealth , in their hurried walk
You are in a counting-house , you know , and you look about you. ” It struck me as a singular implication that you could n't be out of a counting-house , you know , and look about you ; but I silently deferred to his experience .
He took the youngest child on his arm , where she was willing enough to be carried .

Thus , a wounded prince or bandit chief , who is bleeding to death and too faint to move , except to the softest music ( and then only upon his hands and knees ) , shall be seen to approach a cottage door for aid in such a series of writhings and twistings , and with such curlings up
Good-night ! ’ Still covering her face , she sobbed , and answered ‘ Good-night , dear <NAME> , ’ and silently ascended .
Come and see. ’ He went on again , and <NAME> accompanied him .
We all drew nearer to the cages , feigning to examine the birds .
‘ Next ( to clear the ground before coming to business ) , you ’ ve placed in this yard a skulking , a sneaking , and a sniffing , menial. ’ ‘ He hadn ’ t a cold in his head when I sent him here , ’ said Mr Boffin .
`` She 's gone forrard to the Police Office , '' returns <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> tripped up the steps to the house-door , tripped down the steps with the key , tripped across the little garden , and opened the gate .
Forty year ago , you had only to let down the bucket till the first knot in the rope was free of the windlass , and you heard it splashing in the cold dull water .
My Uncle ’ s child made people ’ s blood run cold , some times , she did ! ’ ‘ <NAME> ? ’ asked <NAME> .
I had to preside , too , over the entertainment , consisting of a dish of fish , a roast fowl , a sweetbread , vegetables , pudding , and <NAME> ; and it was so pleasant to see how she enjoyed it , and with what state and ceremony she did honour to it , that I was soon
I have undertaken then to let you know that—in short , that <NAME> has informed me that he has long watched your progress with particular interest and pleasure , and has long hoped that the time might ultimately arrive when he should offer you his hand in marriage .
‘ Well , <NAME> , what ’ s the matter with you ? ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Run on -- nothing to the hours , days , weeks , months , years , when we ’ re united -- run on -- they ’ ll fly on -- bolt -- mizzle -- steam-engine -- thousand- horse power -- nothing to it. ’ ‘ Can ’ t -- can ’ t we be married before to-morrow morning
And <NAME> , seeing all these things as they developed themselves , could not but wonder , anxiously , into what back corner of the genteel establishment <NAME> ’ s children would be poked by-and-by , and who would take care of those unborn little victims .
She had been struck with something blunt and heavy , on the head and spine ; after the blows were dealt , something heavy had been thrown down at her with considerable violence , as she lay on her face .
He strengthens and invigorates a man , <NAME> , does <NAME> , in his moral nature. ’ Mr <NAME> snapped at the expression .
The Beginning of a Longer Journey LII .
`` I could n't make him hear , and I softly opened the door and looked in .
Excuse me if I recommend you not to chafe so much , not to be so impetuous , not to wear yourself out so .
The attitude was no less familiar to her than the tone of voice had been .
‘ I never thought you ’ d get better .
Dances and marches are performed alternately , to the enlivening strains of a piano ; and now and then some gentleman or lady ( whose proficiency has been previously ascertained ) obliges the company with a song : nor does it ever degenerate , at a tender crisis , into a screech or howl ; wherein , I must confess
Then , he blessed me and stood waving his hand to me until I had passed the crook in the road ; and then I turned into a field and had a long nap under a hedge before I pursued my way home .
Mrs. Crewler couldn ’ t see me before we left -- couldn ’ t forgive me , then , for depriving her of her child -- but she is a good creature , and has done so since .
So fixed was his figure , that it would have been matter of some difficulty to bend him sufficiently to get him in the carriage-door , if he had not received the timely assistance of a maternal pull from within .
In the atmosphere of vague anxiety and dread that lowered about them in connexion with their fugitive brother , this sound , unusual there , became almost alarming .
<NAME> had been dozing ; but looked worse , and was more feverish than he had appeared yet .
‘ We had better , ’ said this subordinate minister of justice , ‘ get to the office while there ’ s a magistrate sitting .
I have been faithful to my post since the days of his <NAME> Highness the <NAME> , and I will not desert it now .
He believed that Mr <NAME> was disposed to entertain a ripe regard for him , and he knew that he had a sincere regard for Mr Meagles and his good wife .
I 've been negotiating with this gentleman on behalf of <NAME> , <NAME> , and one way and another I 've been in and out and about his premises a deal .
The lady was at the farther end of the room , and once she ventured to wave her hand , as if beseeching my uncle ’ s assistance .
‘ But bless your hearts and eyebrows , all this sort of thing was nothing to my uncle !
Also , <NAME> , _his wife_ , having a ring and chain on the left leg. ’ ‘ Ran away , a negro boy named <NAME> .
‘ Things come about very strangely ! ’ thought <NAME> , as he walked home .
<NAME> ’ t stand staring at me , but do look sharp , will you ? ’ Offering no further observation , <NAME> huddled on his clothes .
If your daughter is disposed to try after the situation , I ’ ll take her there directly. ’ ‘ Have you nothing to say to your uncle , my love ? ’ inquired Mrs. Nickleby .
The sun came proudly up in all his majesty , the noble river ran its winding course , the leaves quivered and rustled in the air , the birds poured their cheerful songs from every tree , the short-lived butterfly fluttered its little wings ; all the light and life of day came on ; and , amidst it all
A charming reflection sir , very charming ! ’ While he addressed his clerk in these words , Mr <NAME> was , somewhat ostentatiously , engaged in minutely examining and holding up against the light a five-pound bank note , which he had brought in , in his hand .
<NAME> was by , interested even to agitation ; and the two presented a singular sight : her face was flushed and anxious , and her fingers twining in among ours so closely as to follow every motion , but so slightly as not to embarrass them ; while <NAME> stood attentive , his head a little aside , his
To speak unreservedly to you , I do .
<NAME> care how you spend it , and do n't get yourself into trouble . ''
He ran violently down the stairs , out into the street , and so past the window , without any hat , towards the quarter whence the sound proceeded -- bent , no doubt , upon securing the strangers ’ services directly .
Then he too stood , with his doubled hand upon the table near it , waiting to be addressed .
‘ A schooner , from <NAME> or <NAME> , laden with fruit and wine .
Squeers was jealous of the influence which his man had so soon acquired , and his family hated him , and <NAME> paid for both .
I am talking of <NAME> as if she was a man-of-war .
There was but one consideration to set against the heavy loss of <NAME> , and though it was slight comfort to her burdened heart , she tried to think it some relief .
<NAME> there no other neck to clasp ; no other face to turn to ?
‘ Bustle ! ’ said the old gentleman again , but the admonition was quite unnecessary , for one of the girls poured out the cherry brandy , and another brought in the towels , and one of the men suddenly seizing <NAME> by the leg , at imminent hazard of throwing him off his balance , brushed away at
All ’ s over. ’ Therefore , the police sent for something to cover it , and it was covered and borne through the streets , the people falling away .
The sensation was like being touched in the marrow with some pungent and searching acid , it set my very teeth on edge .
‘ You see , my love , she ’ s already quite contented and comfortable , and means to say goodbye to her sister <NAME> and her little pets , and her good honest husband , with a light heart and a smile ; don ’ t she , my dear ? ’ ‘ Oh yes ! ’ cried <NAME>
“ Kit ’ s coming to-morrow morning , I know .
‘ Why nat ’ rally , ’ said Mr Riderhood , ‘ ain ’ t I always thirsty ! ’ ( <NAME> at the absurdity of the question . )
‘ I have sent him a letter that I ’ ll trouble him to attend to , or he and I will fall out , I can tell him ! ’ ‘ Does he know where I am , aunt ? ’ I inquired , alarmed .
‘ Yes , mother , ’ returned Alice , stooping forward for a moment and kissing her , but endeavouring , even in the act , to disengage herself from her embrace .
My shoes were by this time in a woeful condition .
If you would empower me to do it , I would do it for you with the greatest satisfaction ! ''
' I will , directly , sir , ' replied <NAME> : undoing the chain , and turning the key .
To <NAME> and <NAME> , and into <NAME> .
“ I have seen it done very often in my time , <NAME> , between more people than I should like to mention to you ; but it never came to anything after all. ” ‘ “ You must have seen some queer things , ” said <NAME> , with an inquisitive look .
This was addressed to <NAME> , who now made his appearance ; that gentleman , motioning <NAME> to retire , brought in the two ladies , and shut the door .
His anxiety , his eagerness , and affliction at this pass are pitiable to behold .
‘ I am delighted to hear it .
Did you think that I was long gone ? ’ It is as the face of a woman , shaded by a quantity of rich dark hair .
<NAME> <NAME> was some time absent , and , when he came back , showed that he had been outside by bringing with him fresh butter in a cabbage leaf , some thin slices of boiled ham in another cabbage leaf , and a little basket of water-cresses and salad herbs .
The <NAME> being very cold , he set off for a brisk trot after service ; the trot to end in a charge at his favourite fragment of ruin , which was to be carried by storm , without a pause for breath .
“ Lor ! ” I says , “ I ’ ll think of something else -- something comfortable -- and put it out of my head. ” So I thought of the new house and <NAME> , and was thinking at a great rate with that sheet there in my hand , when all of a sudden , the faces
‘ We are older than we were , I see , ’ said my aunt .
I know too much about it , sir .
Whatever the old girl says , do -- do it ! ''
I have come to ask if you would let me stay with you ? ’ ‘ Why should you stay with me ?
Now , hear me , my dears !
This grew so strong with me , that I resolved to go back to the yard before I took my dinner , and ask the boat-builder if he thought his attempting to return by sea at all likely ?
She stands looking at him as he writes on , all unconscious , and only her fluttering hands give utterance to her emotions .
Many of them came out to look after him , and to observe to one another , with great unctuousness , that he was ‘ pulled down by it. ’ Mrs Plornish and her father stood at the top of the steps at their own end , much depressed and shaking their heads .
Now , a tall church spire appeared in view , which presently became a tree , a barn , a shadow on the ground , thrown on it by their own bright lamps .
'Do you live in <NAME> ? '
The rooms were low and damp , the clammy walls were pierced with chinks and holes , the rotten floors had sunk from their level , the very beams started from their places and warned the timid stranger from their neighbourhood .
Such appearances are common to many vehicles belonging to , and maintained by , old ladies of economic habits ; and in this vehicle sat an old lady who was its mistress and proprietor .
Mr Pitt in a nightcap and bedgown , and without his boots , represented the poet <NAME> with perfect exactness ; and <NAME> of <NAME> in a dark wig , white shirt-collar , and male attire , was such a complete image of <NAME> that the young ladies quite screamed when they saw it .
She prayed him to forgive her , before my Agnes came into this world .
At length they arrived at the large stone .
But all these sights were of short duration , being speedily broken up by coffee , and the desertion of the room .
Quickening their pace , they turned up a road upon the left hand .
Yielding by degrees to the influence of the exciting liquid , rendered more so by the heat , <NAME> expressed a strong desire to recollect a song which he had heard in his infancy , and the attempt proving abortive , sought to stimulate his memory with more glasses of punch , which appeared to have quite a contrary effect
‘ I believe , father , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ he will not come back to town to-night. ’ <NAME> turned away , and said no more .
His man looked back pretty often as he went , but got no hint of him .
thieves ! ’ shrieked the usurer , starting up and folding his book to his breast .
But , next day , he resumed the subject by saying in his off-hand manner and with a slighting laugh , ‘ Well , <NAME> , when shall we go to this Maecenas of yours ?
'Not too strong , ' replied <NAME> , with a delicate cough .
‘ If you please , ma ’ am , ’ I began .
‘ Can you drive ? ’ said the fat boy .
‘ And there really is no hurry , you know , ’ said <NAME> in a lower voice .
‘ What insupportable creature is this , coming in ? ’ said <NAME> , ‘ I can not hear it .
The poor girl was sitting on the floor where they had laid her down .
‘ I have now said all I have to say : except that this young couple parted , firmly , though not without tears and sorrow , on the evening when you last saw them together. ’ <NAME> heard a terrible shriek , and saw no ghastly figure , sitting or standing ; saw nothing but a heap of torn
It is remarkable that what we call the world , which is so very credulous in what professes to be true , is most incredulous in what professes to be imaginary ; and that , while , every day in real life , it will allow in one man no blemishes , and in another no virtues , it will
‘ And poor <NAME> , perhaps , my dear ? ’ suggested R. W. ‘ Pardon me , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ no ! ’ It was one of the worthy woman ’ s specialities that she had an amazing power of gratifying her splenetic or worldly-minded humours by extolling her own family : which she thus proceeded ,
‘ I think I have caught it now , ’ said <NAME> .
And yet his misgivings were not so dark as , imagined by the light of this later time , they would appear .
I am more important to my sister than he thinks .
The childish feet of long ago , did not tread such enchanted ground as theirs do now .
As he looked at the fire , I thought I saw a cunning expression , followed by a half-laugh , come into his face .
There were some people slinking about as usual when we passed out into the street , who were evidently anxious to speak with him ; but there was something so conclusive in the halo of scented soap which encircled his presence , that they gave it up for that day .
How long this scene might have lasted , or how much <NAME> might have suffered , no one can tell , had not a carriage , which was driving swiftly by , suddenly pulled up , from whence there descended old <NAME> and <NAME> , the former of whom , in far less time than it takes to write it
‘ <NAME> , aunt ! ’ I seriously believe it had never once entered my head for a single moment , to consider whether she was or not .
She ’ ll drop down the river with that theer tide .
Having something more than a suspicion of the object of the gentleman ’ s visit , <NAME> preceded him to the <NAME> and <NAME> , and , turning sharp round , planted himself in the centre of the doorway .
When I came back , she was dying ; and all the blood in my heart has dried up , for they starved her to death .
They had already got the length of opening the hearse to take the coffin out , when some brighter genius proposed instead , its being escorted to its destination amidst general rejoicing .
I must see him to-night , for I faithfully promised to do so .
`` Yes , we thought you 'd come to us this morning , but we turned out early and left <NAME> , the best of boys , to mind his sisters and came to you instead -- as you see !
' I am sure I thought it was the boy , or I would n't have meddled with him .
‘ And you see , <NAME> , ’ he added , dropping his voice , ‘ how powerful money is , and how anxious people are to get it .
<NAME> , and thin , and pallid , he awoke at last from what seemed to have been a long and troubled dream .
Likewise you 're a oncommon scholar. ” “ No , I am ignorant and backward , Joe. ” “ Why , see what a letter you wrote last night !
I yield. ’ <NAME> was at once overwhelmed with blushes and expressions of gratitude , of which latter commodity neither <NAME> nor Mrs. <NAME> was by any means sparing .
Neither was his manner influenced .
Not in the least likely .
How can I ever thank you ?
You speak as if he had threatened you in some dark way. ’ ‘ He has never spoken to me about—that .
‘ I think I remember having had a few interviews like that , with ladies out of doors .
What would be the consequence ?
‘ That ’ s cheering ! ’ ‘ I have only one difficulty , aunt. ’ ‘ Say what it is , <NAME> , ’ she returned .
I ask , for information. ’ ‘ My dear <NAME> , I wish I ever had ! ’ ‘ Then you have not ?
She is never to blame in any such instance .
`` You said on that occasion , '' I recommenced , `` that you might possibly have the means of advancing my interests and promoting my fortunes by making discoveries of which I should be the subject .
It is falling still ; upon the roof , upon the skylight , even through the skylight , and drip , drip , drip , with the regularity of the <NAME> 's <NAME> , on the stone floor below .
I walked up to where he was sitting , and said , ‘ How do you do , <NAME> ? ’ He was greatly fluttered by this unexpected address from a stranger , and replied , in his slow way , ‘ I thank you , sir , you are very good .
'Do you think this respectful or proper conduct , Mrs. Mann , ' inquired <NAME> , grasping his cane , 'to keep the parish officers a waiting at your garden-gate , when they come here upon porochial business with the porochial orphans ?
The villainy , however , which could first borrow money of his faithful follower , and then abbreviate his name to ‘ <NAME> , ’ was more than he could patiently bear .
<NAME> wonder than these , when a bottle-nosed person in a glazed hat had after some considerable hesitation ordered another glass of gin and water of the attendant potboy , and when <NAME> , instead of sending it , appeared in person , saying , ‘ Captain Joey , you have had as much as will do you good ,
'Bless her , she 's going off ! '
‘ <NAME> ’ t you find <NAME> blooming , sir ?
May I hold the pens ? ’ The remembrance of her pretty joy when I said yes , brings tears into my eyes .
‘ Well , <NAME> , ’ said the buxom female , ‘ I ’ m sure I only spoke to you out of kindness. ’ ‘ <NAME> likely , mum , ’ replied <NAME> .
Mr <NAME> projected a life of holidays from that time forth ; for , as he regularly informed <NAME> every day , it was his ‘ last half ’ at <NAME> Blimber ’ s , and he was going to begin to come into his property directly .
At one time , she was all cordiality and ease ; at another , all stiffness and frigidity .
When she had entered two or three laborious items in the account-book , <NAME> would walk over the page , wagging his tail , and smear them all out .
‘ Wicked one ! ’ ‘ You have been here before , if I am not mistaken ? ’ said Mr Dombey .
You inquire , on board a steamboat , of a fellow-passenger , whether breakfast will be ready soon , and he tells you he should think so , for when he was last below , they were ‘ fixing the tables : ’ in other words , laying the cloth .
But its sound had revived a long train of miserable <NAME> , and the procession would not stop with the bell , but continued to march on .
Among the trees and not far from the residence he pointed out the spire of the little church of which he had spoken .
After <NAME> had fixed a day for his departure to <NAME> , these symptoms increased ; and it became evident that something was in progress which affected the peace of the young lady , and of somebody else besides .
‘ <NAME> ’ had taken her down into <NAME> for a wedding trip , and there she had seen my aunt , too ; and both my aunt and <NAME> were well , and they had all talked of nothing but me .
If there must be such a shadow anywhere , I would keep it for the future in my own breast .
I thought she would have come round again before this , but she hasn ’ t been here. ’ ‘ About <NAME> -- ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Your way lies there , sir , ’ said <NAME> , in a suppressed voice , that some devil might have owned with pride .
And having caught some inkling of our story , the young people about us -- as young as you and I are now , <NAME> -- may come to us for sympathy , and pour distresses which hope and inexperience could scarcely feel enough for , into the compassionate ears of the old bachelor brother and his maiden sister. ’
I have seen enough of you to know that you are a bully and coward .
It was as well that he did so ; for although the <NAME> was not gone long , he was gone much longer than he had proposed .
The public-houses by the wayside , from being empty and noiseless as those in the remoter parts had been , now sent out boisterous shouts and clouds of smoke ; and , from the misty windows , clusters of broad red faces looked down upon the road .
I am sure you don ’ t. ’ ‘ I do , ’ returned the old woman .
While these , and many other encomiums , were being passed on the accomplished <NAME> , that young lady made the best of her way to the police-office ; whither , notwithstanding a little natural timidity consequent upon walking through the streets alone and unprotected , she arrived in perfect safety shortly afterwards .
He never opened it without occasion .
he exclaimed , `` I fear you more than any spectre I have seen .
<NAME> <NAME> gave him good day .
‘ I am sure we are very much obliged to him , ’ observed Mrs. Nickleby .
That young man hears the words I speak .
‘ <NAME> , sir ! ’ replied the young lady sharply , smiling though as she turned aside , and biting her lip , ( whereat Mrs. <NAME> , who was still standing on the stairs , glanced at her with disdain , and called to her husband to come away ) .
The woman sits beside him , very attentive to the pipe , which is all the while at his lips .
Such an idle thing should be repeated , with my glad consent , fifty times a day , to save you a moment ’ s heart-ache , <NAME> Dorrit. ’ She had taken courage now , and answered , far more in her usual manner , ‘ You are so good !
cried <NAME> , holding up his hands .
The frozen particles of ice , brushed from the blades of grass by the wind , and borne across my face ; the hard clatter of the horse ’ s hoofs , beating a tune upon the ground ; the stiff-tilled soil ; the snowdrift , lightly eddying in the chalk-pit as the breeze ruffled it ; the smoking team
‘ <NAME> of <NAME> is not to be plundered and nobody suspected .
‘ He is not being educated anywhere .
‘ Wot a game it is ! ’ said the elder <NAME> , with a chuckle .
I won her through a rash vow .
‘ I don ’ t mind it at all .
‘ Did I always say that that ‘ ere blessed child was the most interesting I ever see ?
But , being what he was -- and is , I hope -- I can ’ t believe it. ’ ‘ Wal ’ r , my lad , ’ inquired the <NAME> , wistfully eyeing him as he pondered and pondered , ‘ what do you make of it , then ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , ’ returned <NAME> ,
I replaced the razor in its usual drawer , unfastened the door , and called loudly for assistance .
His personal recognition of each successive client was comprised in a nod , and in his settling his hat a little easier on his head with both hands , and then tightening the post-office , and putting his hands in his pockets .
I couldn ’ t , <NAME> ! ’ said <NAME> .
There ’ s nothing lost , neither , by one ’ s being here ; because the boys ’ money comes in just the same as if I was at home , and Mrs. Squeers she keeps them in order .
I was a listening. ’ ‘ Was you , indeed ? ’ said Mr Wegg , dubiously .
As if it were <NAME> , the hero of the ballad , and Mr Venus were the sparrow with his bow and arrow , and Mr Wegg were the fly with his little eye .
‘ I knew you would admire my brother .
Take me away ! ’ With one swift turn of her lithe figures <NAME> laid the little beauty on a sofa , as if she had never caught her up .
<NAME> pound a week -- it ’ s too cheap , <NAME> .
It looked very comfortable indeed .
<NAME> is a sort of distant connexion of mine -- it doesn ’ t matter how ; I needn ’ t enter into that .
He thought , if this man could be raised up now , what would be his foremost thoughts ?
All things in it are of the past .
‘ Oh , yes , it ’ s all right , ’ replied Mrs. Crummles , anticipating the question .
`` Tell her how it was . ''
But all he could do was to comfort and console her by kind words ; and words they were of such love and kindness , and cheerful encouragement , that poor <NAME> threw her arms about his neck , and declared she would weep no more .
Here ’ s your health , sir. ’ ‘ Hold hard there , ’ interposed the mottled-faced gentleman , with sudden energy ; ‘ your eyes on me , gen ’ l ’ m ’ n ! ’ Saying this , the mottled-faced gentleman rose , as did the other gentlemen .
First he thought of his friends , and wondered when they would join him ; then his mind reverted to Mrs. <NAME> ; and from that lady it wandered , by a natural process , to the dingy counting-house of <NAME> & <NAME> .
<NAME> ’ t you knock her cap off , or her tooth out , or scratch her , or do something or other to her ? ’ asked <NAME> .
She hurried out to meet him ; and little Bob in his comforter -- he had need of it , poor fellow -- came in .
'Amen to that , my child ! '
Mrs Alfred <NAME> faced her lord .
When the shadow of the church-porch swallowed them up , victorious Gruff and <NAME> likewise presented himself to be swallowed up .
And I tell you what , <NAME> , if I hadn ’ t more of these qualities that commonly endear man to man , than our articled clerk has , I ’ d steal a <NAME> cheese , tie it round my neck , and drown myself .
At first , they were read as D. I. C. ; but , on being more carefully examined , the last letter was found to be G. There was no record or legend of any prisoner with those initials , and many fruitless guesses were made what the name could have been .
In the course of a couple of hours the noble Refrigerator , at no time less than a hundred years behind the period , got about five centuries in arrears , and delivered solemn political oracles appropriate to that epoch .
<NAME> , I had brought in all our hammers , one after another , but without avail .
'Just a leetle drop , with a little cold water , and a lump of sugar . '
He shook the snow from his hat and clothes , and brushed it away from his face , while I was inwardly making these remarks .
<NAME> ’ t say , “ Oh , <NAME> , <NAME> ! ” That ’ s childish .
Trembling in every joint , from cold and exhaustion , he made an effort to stand upright ; but , shuddering from head to foot , fell prostrate on the ground .
In the morning he was downhearted again , and would have sustained himself by giving me all the money he had in his possession , gold and silver too , if my aunt had not interposed , and limited the gift to five shillings , which , at his earnest petition , were afterwards increased to ten .
‘ What man , ’ thought <NAME> proudly , while on his way , soon afterwards , to the brothers ’ house , ‘ would not be sufficiently rewarded for any sacrifice of fortune by the possession of such a heart as <NAME> ’ s , which , but that hearts weigh light , and gold and silver heavy ,
I imagined it would be a kind of company to have the boys , and the bedroom where I used to tell the stories , so near me : although the boys would know nothing of my being there , and the bedroom would yield me no shelter .
And so indeed it was , for the schoolmaster had ordered it to be put down , and it was getting on so well that the doctor might have smelt it if he had tried ; perhaps he did .
If <NAME> were in her worst , I intensified it .
‘ <NAME> and water-erily you mean , sir , ’ he returned , with some little thickness of speech , in consequence of the Gum-Ticklers having tickled it .
This fact is interesting , as illustrating the secret connection and sympathy which always exist between great minds .
He ’ s my brother. ’ ‘ He ’ s MY brother ! ’ cried the preacher .
He says to the woman , `` Miserable creature , what has he done ? ''
“ No ; nor will she miss now , ” cries The <NAME> , petulantly .
‘ Never mind , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , with dignity .
During the whole of this scene , which lasted some three hours , he had plenty of shouting and weeping and sentimental company , and throughout <NAME> held him by the collar , as if to restrain him from flying at the objects of his brief devotion and tearing them to pieces .
I had recognized her with amazement , for <NAME> .
Though a young man , I have ferreted out evidence , got up cases , and seen lots of life .
Let me have a word with you . '
‘ With all my heart , ’ said Mr Swiveller .
‘ I am sir , ’ replied the landlord .
‘ We have only met each other once before , you know .
It must not be lost. ’ He tapped at the cottage door .
It was yet early , and the old man being still asleep , she walked out into the churchyard , brushing the dew from the long grass with her feet , and often turning aside into places where it grew longer than in others , that she might not tread upon the graves .
But look where he will , he still beholds him close to the opposite houses , making his way with his wary hand from brick to brick and from door to door , and often , as he creeps along , glancing over at him watchfully .
In a later stage of the dinner : that is to say , when the <NAME> stood at the <NAME> ’ s elbow ready to serve the first bottle of champagne : the <NAME> became still slyer .
Mrs <NAME> rang for candles as soon as the <NAME> had closed upon him .
‘ O ’ course you air , ’ said <NAME> argumentatively .
He lay , that night , at a cottage , where beds were let at a cheap rate to the more humble class of travellers ; and , rising betimes next morning , made his way before night to <NAME> .
This has not been broken very long .
She ’ s extremely sorry to lose you , Mr <NAME> , but a sense of her duty to society reconciles her .
You ask yourself , how would all them ancestors of yours , away to <NAME> -- not to go beyond him at present -- have borne that blow ; you remember scores of them that would have borne it well ; and you bear it well on their accounts , and to maintain the family credit .
He asked me if I felt sure that I was as well as in the morning ?
Now let us walk the other way .
While it roared through the steeple of St <NAME> ’ s <NAME> , and twirled all the cowls in the neighbourhood , it made a swoop to beat the <NAME> smoke into the jail ; and , plunging down the chimneys of the few early collegians who were yet lighting their fires , half suffocated them .
‘ I beg your pardon ! ’ As he bent his head to Mr Dombey , with an air of deference that accorded ill with his words , though they were humbly spoken , he moved it round towards her , and kept his watching eyes that way .
The general aspect of the room recalled him to himself at once ; but he had no sooner cast his eye on the figure of a man who was brooding over the dusty fire , than , letting his hat fall on the floor , he stood perfectly fixed and immovable with astonishment .
“ Now , would it not be better that he should let it go ? ” Still , the <NAME> , with shaded forehead , beat his foot nervously on the ground .
'What of the house , my man ; eh ? '
`` Peace , my friends , '' says <NAME> , rising and wiping the oily exudations from his reverend visage .
‘ I tell you , ’ returned <NAME> boldly , ‘ that I don ’ t know .
The man , after looking at me for a moment , turned me upside down , and emptied my pockets .
Thereupon all the young ladies rose and began shaking their skirts out behind .
‘ That was our light porter at the <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ who brought you the message to-night .
Come now , think of somethink else. ’ To this encouragement , offered with the indulgent toleration of a wise and liberal expert , <NAME> would rejoin , reddening : ‘ Or , my dear , you might propose to the person of the house a duck. ’ ‘ Well , <NAME> ! ’ the <NAME> would exclaim ( still
‘ But it can ’ t be helped , I ’ ve done my duty , <NAME> , I have indeed .

It is difficult to believe that <NAME> ( round-eyed still , and not at all grammatical ) is married to a miller in our neighbourhood ; yet so it is ; and even now , looking up from my desk as I write early in the morning at my summer window , I see the very mill beginning to go
Never mind , <NAME> , never mind ! ’ said <NAME> .
And really it did seem possible .
‘ Had I ? ’ said the man again .
But the old gentleman 's shoulders were shrugged up to his ears ; and his eyes were vacantly staring on the opposite wall .
I ’ m a mother to both .
I chose the night for the journey , that there might be less curiosity when I left the town .
At the doors and windows some men and women lounged or prowled about , and took little notice of us except to laugh to one another or to say something as we passed about gentlefolks minding their own business and not troubling their heads and muddying their shoes with coming to look after other people 's .
There were other times when she would come to a sudden check in this tone and in all her many tones , and would seem to pity me .

His telling her of the glorious state that Mr <NAME> kept , and of the court that bowed before him , naturally brought him to Mrs Merdle .

Still , although I had no doubt that they were very beautiful , and very improving , and very sufficient for a great many purposes of life , and always remembered all through life , I did doubt whether <NAME> would not have profited by some one studying him a little , instead of his studying them quite so much
I thought all this very pretty and engaging , and <NAME> seemed to think so too , as we looked after them fading away in the light of a young moon .
For some changes in the fortunes of my friends , I was prepared .

Thoroughly used to him as he was , he found something new and strained in him that was for the moment perplexing .
His advice , energy , activity , money , credit , all his resources whatsoever , were all made useless .
‘ I should be the victim of their fury , ’ replied <NAME> .
As to the strange man ; if he had come back for his two bank-notes there could have been no dispute about them , because my sister was fully prepared to restore them .

I was awoke by somebody saying ‘ Here he is ! ’ and uncovering my hot head .
I am better by myself. ” If I was to be put upon my oath to-morrow , <NAME> , before a magistrate , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ I have no doubt I could venture to swear to those identical words. ’ Miss Tox expressed her admiration by saying , ‘ My Louisa is ever methodical ! ’ ‘ In

They all clamoured , as we entered , to the assistant-master , who accompanied us , ‘ Look at me , <NAME> !
As she knew <NAME> ( indeed <NAME> and I both thought that she evidently associated him with the receipt of her wages ) , she immediately relented and allowed us to pass in .
I told her so , as she sat brooding after this outburst .

Take my arm ! ’ Then leaning on Mr Merdle ’ s arm , did Mr Dorrit descend the staircase , seeing the worshippers on the steps , and feeling that the light of Mr Merdle shone by reflection in himself .

But notwithstanding these drawbacks , the <NAME> , being heartily in earnest , read the service to the very last line , and with genuine feeling too ; and approving of it very much when he had done , turned in , under the counter ( but not before he had been upstairs , and listened at <NAME> ’ s
At the expiration of the term , steadily adhering to his old resolution and the pledge he gave his mother , he made his way back to <NAME> amidst innumerable difficulties , and returned , on foot , to his native place .
They , on the contrary , are much obliged to him for the pleasure he has given them in his company ; and so they part with many expressions of goodwill on both sides .
But the occasion was no common one , for Rob the <NAME> had certainly never stood in the doorway of <NAME> Cuttle ’ s room before , and in it he stood then , panting at the <NAME> , with a flushed and touzled air of Bed about him , that greatly heightened both his colour and expression .
His family is as old as the hills , and infinitely more respectable .

I am rejoiced to see you , <NAME> , even under present circumstances. ’ I believed that ; for he seemed to relish them very much .
Am I blind to that boy ’ s defects ?
What the unknown prisoner had written will never be read , but he had written something , and hidden it away to keep it from the gaoler. ” “ My father , ” exclaimed <NAME> , “ you are ill ! ” He had suddenly started up , with his hand to his head .
If he were at sea that night , and near a dangerous coast , as it is said he was ; and if the vessel that was seen should really be the ship which -- ’ ‘ Rosa ! ’ said Mrs. <NAME> , ‘ come to me ! ’ She came , but with no sympathy or gentleness .
But , the friendly dawn appearing at last , and the rush-candles of the village guttering out , the people happily dispersed , and <NAME> came down bringing his life with him for that while .

Shaken out of destiny ’ s dice-box into the company of a mere smuggler ; -- shut up with a poor little contraband trader , whose papers are wrong , and whom the police lay hold of besides , for placing his boat ( as a means of getting beyond the frontier ) at the disposition of other little people
Moved by these considerations , a stout lady opened the proceedings by inquiring , with an air of great concern and sympathy , how Mr <NAME> was ; whereunto Mr Quilp ’ s wife ’ s mother replied sharply , ‘ Oh !
<NAME> , being a flabby gentleman with a moist surface and eyes so much too small for his moon of a face that they seemed to have been originally made for somebody else , was not at first sight prepossessing ; yet he was scarcely seated before <NAME> asked <NAME> and me , not inaudibly , whether he was not
Drownded , ain ’ t he ? ’ Concluding his apostrophe with this abrupt appeal to <NAME> , the <NAME> bade her good-night , and descended the stairs , while <NAME> remained at the top , holding the candle out to light him down .
<NAME> noticed the first <NAME> .

Finding all remonstrances unavailing , <NAME> pulled his hat firmly on , threw his father ’ s coat over his arm , and taking the old man round the waist , forcibly dragged him down the ladder , and into the street ; never releasing his hold , or permitting him to stop , until they reached the corner .
Still more , when his mourning 'at is unfortunately made so small as that the weight of the black feathers brings it off , try to keep it on how you may. ” A ghost-seeing effect in <NAME> 's own countenance informed me that <NAME> had entered the room .
As a consciously ‘ splendid woman , ’ accustomed to overhear herself so denominated by elderly osteologists pursuing their studies in dinner society , <NAME> could dispense with her daughter .
I entreated her to rise , and got my arms about her to help her up ; but she only pressed that hand of mine which was nearest to her grasp , and hung her head over it and wept .
But , <NAME> , I do , notwithstanding , perceive the state of -- of things -- with <NAME> .
“ We really have not heads enough ; it would be a pity , I think. ” “ He was signalling with her when I saw her , ” argued <NAME> ; “ I can not speak of one without the other ; and I must not be silent , and trust the case wholly to him , this little

Then <NAME> beat him , and pouted , and said , ‘ My poor beautiful flowers ! ’ as compassionately , I thought , as if <NAME> had laid hold of me .
‘ <NAME> , ’ says the Major , seeing this , ‘ I give you joy .
There was a snap of cold , last week .
'What do you mean by lagging and a lifer ? '

At this hint , the wan page , who had been surveying the party over the top of the chair , vanished behind it , as if the ground had swallowed him up .

Yet , he knew so little about the inmates that he gave them names of his own invention : as ‘ Miss <NAME> ’ , ‘ <NAME> ’ , ‘ Aunt <NAME> ’ , ‘ Uncle <NAME> ‘ -- having no authority whatever for any such designations , but particularly the last -- to which , as a natural consequence
As soon as she came nearly below the tree , <NAME> began , by way of gently indicating his presence , to make sundry diabolical noises similar to those which would probably be natural to a person of middle age who had been afflicted with a combination of inflammatory sore throat , croup , and whooping-cough , from his earliest

As <NAME> looked round on the kind faces , and saw among them those of <NAME> and his lady , and of Mr Toots , who was chuckling and staring at her from a distance , she was reminded of the night when <NAME> and she had come from <NAME> ’ s : and when the carriage drove away ,
‘ Oh , my goodness , how polite we are ! ’ exclaimed <NAME> , making a preposterous attempt to cover her large face with her morsel of a hand .
As I found ( after pacifying him ) that he was a little boy with a naturally large head , I thought that perhaps where his head could go , his body could follow , and mentioned that the best mode of extrication might be to push him forward .

They sit down , <NAME> as if he had no power of bending himself , except at the hips , for that purpose .
All through dinner , <NAME> combined her present appetite for eating and drinking with her past appetite for romantic love , in a way that made <NAME> afraid to lift his eyes from his plate ; since he could not look towards her without receiving some glance of mysterious meaning or warning , as if they were engaged in a
It is a black , dilapidated street , avoided by all decent people , where the crazy houses were seized upon , when their decay was far advanced , by some bold vagrants who after establishing their own possession took to letting them out in lodgings .

‘ Away ! ’ was the first word he could utter as he literally gnashed his teeth .
In the course of that letter , I told <NAME> that I had a particular occasion for half a guinea ; and that if she could lend me that sum until I could repay it , I should be very much obliged to her , and would tell her afterwards what I had wanted it for .
Is it a bargain , or is it not ? ’ <NAME> pushed some papers from him as he spoke , and carelessly rattled his cash-box , as though by mere accident .

This is the most I consider possible .
Viewing the matter precisely in this light , <NAME> , without the slightest intimation of his purpose , sprang vigorously out of bed , struck the <NAME> so smart a blow in the chest as to deprive him of a considerable portion of the commodity which sometimes bears his name , and then , recapturing his nightcap , boldly placed

He was the meanest cur existing , with a single pair of legs .
Not we. ’ ‘ Do you mean to say , <NAME> , ’ inquired Mr <NAME> ; looking at him with marked displeasure , ‘ that you have called a child after a boiler ? ’ ‘ No , no , <NAME> , ’ returned <NAME> , with a tender consideration for his mistake .

‘ At least , ’ said Mr Inspector , ‘ you will not object to leave me your card , sir ? ’ ‘ I should not object , if I had one ; but I have not. ’ He reddened and was much confused as he gave the answer .

‘ Now , <NAME> dear , ’ said <NAME> in due course , ‘ the salad ’ s ready , and it ’ s past supper-time. ’ Mrs <NAME> rose , but remained speechless .
says Mrs. Bagnet , quietly threading her needle .
‘ <NAME> , Mrs. <NAME> , ’ said Mrs. Cluppins , ‘ see what you ’ ve been and done ! ’ ‘ Well , that is a good one ! ’ ejaculated Mrs. Sanders .

It is not flattering to my self-love , but I am afraid you did. ’ ‘ How could you be so cruel ? ’ ‘ O Mr Wrayburn , ’ she answered , suddenly breaking into tears , ‘ is the cruelty on my side !
It seemed to fill to inconvenience the little bar in which the widow landlady and her two daughters received him ; it was much too big for the narrow wainscoted room with a bagatelle-board in it , that was first proposed for his reception ; it perfectly swamped the little private holiday sitting-room of the family , which was finally
So here I am , a poor devil of an artist. ’ <NAME> was beginning , ‘ But on the other hand -- ’ when <NAME> took him up .
‘ I thought perhaps you wouldn ’ t mind , in this fine weather , coming home by water , <NAME> .

From the exterior of <NAME> 's Shooting Gallery , and the long entry , and the bare perspective beyond it , <NAME> augurs well .
The rider stooped , and , casting up his eyes at the guard , handed the passenger a small folded paper .
Staggering as if struck by lightning , he lost his balance and tumbled over the parapet .

She was much given to tying up her head in a pocket-handkerchief , knotted under the chin .
I pass my whole life , miss , in turning an immense pecuniary Mangle. ” After this odd description of his daily routine of employment , <NAME> flattened his flaxen wig upon his head with both hands ( which was most unnecessary , for nothing could be flatter than its shining surface was before ) , and resumed his former
Shutting his eyes and rolling .
The Augurs of the <NAME> invariably predict that when <NAME> and that finger are in much conference , a terrible avenger will be heard of before long .
To catch up in her arms the sick child who was dear to her , and hide it as if it were a criminal , and keep off all ministration but such as her own ignorant tenderness and patience could supply , had become this woman ’ s idea of maternal love , fidelity , and duty .
Although <NAME> had roused himself from sleep , he was not thoroughly awake .
But this little death has made me ask myself the question , seriously , whether I wasn ’ t too bent upon pleasing myself .
' I shall do you a mischief ! '
Yes , and a wery good place it is to live in , ain ’ t it ? ’ As <NAME> turned somewhat fiercely upon <NAME> in saying this , and moreover muttered in an excited fashion certain unpleasant invocations concerning his own eyes , limbs , and circulating fluids , the latter gentleman deemed it advisable to pursue the
On inquiring what this appellation might be supposed to signify , I was given to understand that whatever was unintelligible would be certainly transcendental .

‘ Was the boys sorry to see me in such a dreadful condition , <NAME> , or was they glad ? ’ asked <NAME> , in a sentimental manner .
Lately , they very often wouldn ’ t laugh , and he used to come home despairing .
Penetrating to the heart of this region , he arrives by a court and a long whitewashed passage at a great brick building composed of bare walls , floors , roof-rafters , and skylights , on the front of which , if it can be said to have any front , is painted <NAME> 'S <NAME> 's Shooting Gallery ,
You address nothing in my breast , you touch nothing there .
‘ There , ’ said <NAME> , pausing for breath when they reached another gallery of the same dimensions as the one below , ‘ this is the coffee- room flight ; the one above ’ s the third , and the one above that ’ s the top ; and the room where you ’ re a-going to sleep
) , that I think she may come , on his account , to be kind to me. ’ I fathomed the depth of the rascal ’ s whole scheme , and understood why he laid it bare .
He leaves his lodgings every morning at a certain hour , throws himself upon the town , gets through his day in some manner quite satisfactory to himself , and regularly appears at the door of his own house again at night , like the mysterious master of <NAME> .
She is engaged to be married to a most worthy and deserving man in her own station of life .
What will they think of us !
‘ Let me see , said the blind man .
From my point of view , he was the wrong twin all the time , and only externally like the <NAME> of <NAME> .
The eyes were there , before he had laid himself along .
How can one expect she should , when she is so very unlike a <NAME> ? ’ Miss Tox looked as if she saw no way out of such a cogent argument as that , at all .
There was a magnetism of dulness in them which would have beaten down the most facetious companion that the earth ever knew .
Repressing , with as good a grace as possible , these little familiarities -- for which , there is reason to believe , the black bottle was at least as much to blame as any constitutional infirmity on the part of Mrs. Sliderskew -- he protested that he had only been joking : and , in proof of his unimpaired
replied <NAME> eagerly ; 'but I was thinking that I am ungrateful now . '
<NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ what is the matter , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Never mind , <NAME> ! ’ replied <NAME> , with haughty defiance .
‘ It has come back upon me to-day , it has all come back since we have been sitting here .
‘ Let us speak for ourselves , sir .
For the face , it expressed nothing but violent and evil passions .
‘ Nothing , I suppose ? ’ said <NAME> , with a diabolical grin .
But , next come the <NAME> , and Mr Perch ; and Mr Perch brings <NAME> to talk it over in the kitchen , and to spend a pleasant evening .
<NAME> <NAME> looked after Mr Baps when he went to cheer up Mrs Baps ( who , being quite deserted , was pretending to look over the music-book of the gentleman who played the harp ) , as if he thought him a remarkable kind of man ; and shortly afterwards he said so in those words to <NAME> ,
<NAME> ’ t you pity <NAME> , and I won ’ t pity <NAME> .
And I would wish in conclusion to remind you , as a business precaution , in case it should be necessary to recall the fact in any communication with <NAME> , that throughout our interview I have expressly stated my sole consideration to be <NAME> 's feelings and honour and the family reputation .
why <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Because , ’ said Mrs. Crisparkle , retiring on first principles , ‘ he came home intoxicated , and did great discredit to this house , and showed great disrespect to this family. ’ ‘ That is not to be denied , <NAME> .
I remarked that , once or twice when <NAME> was talking , he looked at <NAME> sideways , as if to make sure of his not being displeased ; and that once when <NAME> ( the other gentleman ) was in high spirits , he trod upon his foot , and gave him a secret caution with his eyes ,
‘ The day had broken when <NAME> awoke , and found himself lying at full length on the flat gravestone in the churchyard , with the wicker bottle lying empty by his side , and his coat , spade , and lantern , all well whitened by the last night ’ s frost , scattered on the ground .
As she glanced down into the yard , she saw <NAME> come in and leer up with the corner of his eye as he went by .
‘ I wrote him a note , I said it was a painful thing .
The kind of foreign help which people usually seek for their children , I can afford to despise ; being above it , I hope .
I think the reply was , `` Cut away , then ! ''
She shall be rich -- noble ! ’ <NAME> took out his pocket-handkerchief , and wiped his eyes .
Light mists arise , and the dew falls , and all the sweet scents in the garden are heavy in the air .
The company consisted of the brothers <NAME> , <NAME> , a ruddy-faced white-headed friend of <NAME> ’ s ( who was a superannuated bank clerk ) , and <NAME> , who was presented to <NAME> ’ s sister with much gravity and solemnity .
‘ She is in <NAME> , with all her family , <NAME> , ’ he said , when the dreaded lady was occupied again .
I have very strong reasons indeed , for entertaining that wish .
Of course it ’ s an exertion , but still , when I know how much depends upon me in this house , I am obliged to make it .
‘ Is the <NAME> in his room , <NAME> ? ’ inquired <NAME> , offering his box with all imaginable courtesy .
While we waited at the gate , I peeped in ( even then <NAME> said , “ And fourteen ? ” but I pretended not to hear him ) , and saw that at the side of the house there was a large brewery .
'This is a painful task , ' said he , 'but these declarations , which have been signed in <NAME> before many gentlemen , must be in substance repeated here .
Charged with this message , the fat boy returned , slumbering as peaceably in his dickey , over the stones , as if it had been a down bed on watch springs .
Her father was a country gentleman down in your part of the world , and was a brewer .
The schoolmaster put his hand in his pocket , and produced two half-crowns , and placed them in Mr Riderhood ’ s palm : who stopped at a convenient doorstep to ring them both , before acknowledging their receipt .
Before breakfast in the morning , <NAME> walked out to look about him .
Stumping with fresh vigour , he goes in at the dark greasy entry , pushes a little greasy dark reluctant side-door , and follows the door into the little dark greasy shop .
And I might have a nice little bit of hot roast meat spoiling at home all this time -- how does HE know I haven ’ t ?
She says to her , “ Rise up from worse than death , and come with me ! ” Them belonging to the house would have stopped her , but they might as soon have stopped the sea .
Other gentlemen , who had no briefs to show , carried under their arms goodly octavos , with a red label behind , and that under-done-pie-crust-coloured cover , which is technically known as ‘ law calf. ’ Others , who had neither briefs nor books , thrust their hands into their pockets , and looked as wise as they conveniently
But I could make nothing of the word .
‘ My dear <NAME> , I am here. ’ ‘ How long is this to last , <NAME> ? ’ <NAME> shook his head .
And this is natural , and impossible to be reasoned against , because , after his long separation from human life , and his great suffering , any event will appear to him more probable in the contemplation , than the being restored to liberty and his fellow-creatures .
You was a spy -- witness at the <NAME> .
He seemed to be the only restless thing , except the clocks , in the whole motionless house .
‘ I prefer to remain at home .
In the gloomy tile-paved entry to the gloomy tile-paved staircase , <NAME> bent down on one knee to the child of his old master , and put her hand to his lips .
the whole way , and the rate of travelling upon it is six miles an hour .
Would you begin without my uncle ? ’ ‘ I forgot the collector , ’ said <NAME> ; ‘ oh no , that would never do. ’ ‘ He ’ s so particular , ’ said Mrs. <NAME> , turning to the other married lady , ‘ that if we began without him , I should be out of his
That this correspondence with the public enemy was not a correspondence of to-day , or of yesterday , or even of last year , or of the year before .
Indeed , I have , now and again , been more surprised by printed news that I have read of myself , than by any printed news that I have ever read in my present state of existence .
‘ Where might it be deposited at present ? ’ asked Mr Boffin , in a wheedling tone .
The dawn coming , the morning coming , and the day coming , and neither message nor letter coming with either , he went down to the country house .
She had no fear that she would live through another night .
Then came the question , which of the two next doors ?
'You must compose yourself , ' said the doctor supporting her .
The newly married pair , on their arrival in <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , were received by the Chief <NAME> .
<NAME> of Mr <NAME> ’ s house , and serving about his person , <NAME> kept his round eyes on the white teeth with fear and trembling , and felt that he had need to open them wider than ever .
Once for all ; I knew to my sorrow , often and often , if not always , that I loved her against reason , against promise , against peace , against hope , against happiness , against all discouragement that could be .
However , he steamed in and out of his little back Dock according as he was wanted or not wanted in the <NAME> presence , and business had gone on in its customary course .
If there was only one man with a wooden leg what a property he ’ d be ! ’ ‘ So he would ! ’ observed the landlord and <NAME> both together .
‘ Does she like it ? ’ ‘ She ’ ll like it better , ’ returned that strong-minded lady , ‘ when she has tea ; so let us have it , and don ’ t bother. ’ ‘ Sweet Sally ! ’ cried <NAME> , extending his arms as if about to embrace her .
As we leave the same day , will you -- will you take me somewhere that morning , <NAME> -- early -- before we go to church ? ’ <NAME> seemed to understand her , as so true a lover so truly loved should , and confirmed his ready promise with a kiss -- with more than one perhaps ,
My guardian being as pleased with the idea as <NAME> was , we took her home next day to arrange the matter and brought her out again in triumph with her boxes and all the purchases that could be squeezed out of a ten-pound note , which <NAME> had found in the docks I suppose , but which he at
‘ Nonsense ! ’ cried <NAME> -- somewhat resentful of the idea .
‘ <NAME> said , my lad , ’ observed the <NAME> , nodding his head thoughtfully ; ‘ and true .
He wore an odd little sleek crisp flaxen wig , setting very close to his head : which wig , it is to be presumed , was made of hair , but which looked far more as though it were spun from filaments of silk or glass .
He laughed as he retired with the bird -- it was a plump one .
I am not , as I hope you are aware , a governess -- ’ ‘ O dear no ! ’ said Mr Dorrit .
They send from their twelve States one hundred members , while the fourteen free States , with a free population nearly double , return but a hundred and forty-two .
<NAME> would have walked into any poverty-stricken debtor ’ s house , and pointed him out to a bailiff , though in attendance upon a young child ’ s death-bed , without the smallest concern , because it would have been a matter quite in the ordinary course of business , and the man would have been an offender against
One thousand , four hundred and seventy-five pounds , four shillings , and threepence , tomorrow at twelve o ’ clock .
As often as he began to consider how to increase this inheritance , or to lay it by , so often his misgiving that there was some one with an unsatisfied claim upon his justice , returned ; and that alone was a subject to outlast the longest walk .
‘ I have not been here a week tomorrow , without considering that too , my dear , ’ she returned .
`` Such things may be , '' repeats <NAME> , `` or they may not be .
‘ This , however , ’ said Mr Toots , ‘ is not the point .
Mr <NAME> lived in a street in the <NAME> ’ s <NAME> , which had set off from that thoroughfare with the intention of running at one heat down into the valley , and up again to the top of <NAME> ; but which had run itself out of breath in twenty yards , and had stood still ever since
‘ I ’ ll try , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ if you ’ ll help me away .
Mr Boffin , submitting to be led on tiptoe to the nursery door , looked in with immense satisfaction , although there was nothing to see but <NAME> in a musing state of happiness , seated in a little low chair upon the hearth , with her child in her fair young arms , and her soft eyelashes shading her
‘ Why , ’ replied <NAME> very slowly , ‘ I rather think one old gen ’ l ’ m ’ n was missin ’ ; I know his hat was found , but I ain ’ t quite certain whether his head was in it or not .
‘ You have reminded me , <NAME> , that this conversation was private -- private and confidential , gentlemen .
Their mode of bestowing the prisoners at night ( which is of general adoption ) differs from ours , and is both simple and effective .
He well remembered , too , that when he had placed his foot upon the coach-steps , he turned round and looked upon him with a face so ashy pale and so very wild and vacant that it made him shudder , and for the moment almost afraid to follow .
But I did both , and made them happy .
‘ At any rate I ’ m going .
Besides , ’ said <NAME> , with logical good faith , ‘ I shall have a debt to pay off , by littles , and naturally that would bring me back , if nothing else would. ’ ‘ MUST it be done ? ’ asked <NAME> , still reluctant , of the Secretary .
If you only repose half as much confidence in me as I repose in you after what I 've experienced of you , that 'll do .
‘ Not by no means , ’ acquiesced <NAME> , affably but magisterially .
Do you see THIS ? ’ cried <NAME> , sitting up , and pointing to his prostrate lady , who was holding him very tight round the waist .
N. F. was some tender , lovely , fascinating fair-creature , I make no doubt , ’ observed Mr Blandois , as he snapped on the case again .
After a moment of suspense , I went and kissed my mother : she kissed me , patted me gently on the shoulder , and sat down again to her work .
When I think of my past follies , and my present state , I am sure it would be best for you .
He didn ’ t happen to take that particular five-pound note , but I have not the smallest doubt that he ’ s always up to something of that sort .
Only a miser ; that 's all . '
And at a table sat the old man himself ; the only living creature there ; his white face pinched and sharpened by the greediness which made his eyes unnaturally bright -- counting the money of which his hands had robbed her .
‘ She has actually passed me without the slightest acknowledgment of my presence ! ’ The young lady turned and curtsied .
says the chief of that company , pointing to the village , 'bring him fast to his tomb ! '
asked <NAME> , advancing to meet him .
So I call upon <NAME> , before I say another word , to fetch him in and send him packing to the right-about. ’ The unsuspecting <NAME> was at that moment airing his many buttons within view of the window .
Sometimes she glanced out of the window , as though she thought we were going slowly , though indeed we were going fast ; but otherwise remained exactly as at first .
At last <NAME> pledged himself to betray no further curiosity , and they walked on : both ladies giggling very much , and declaring that they never had seen such a wicked creature in all their born days -- never .
<NAME> ’ s servant ! ’ said <NAME> earnestly .
‘ And a manager ’ s wife , ’ added Mrs. Crummles , in her accustomed tragedy tones .
She taught her , indeed , nearly all she knows .
He had slipped across the water in his first leisure , and had slipped as quickly back again for his farewell interview with <NAME> .
‘ It ’ s quite dreadful , ’ said <NAME> , stopping his ears .
Indeed , so much affection for him had been added in this one evening to my gratitude that I hoped I already began to understand him through that mingled feeling .
‘ Oh yes , I know you very well ; too well , perhaps , and perhaps he does too , and sorry am I that I should have to say it. ’ ‘ Tell him that I saw him through the window-blind above , as I crossed the road just now , and that I would speak to him
She courted <NAME> , though <NAME> never responded ; listened , day after day , to the guitar , though I am afraid she had no taste for music ; never attacked the <NAME> , though the temptation must have been severe ; went wonderful distances on foot to purchase , as surprises , any trifles that she found out
I am in statu quo. ’ ‘ And Mrs. Micawber ? ’ I pursued .
The latter faithful appendage is also invariably a part of the old girl 's presence out of doors .
How can I think so , looking back on such a trifling wasted youth as mine !
This dangerous ground in his steeple-chase towards manhood passed , he still found it very rough riding , and was grievously beset by all the obstacles in his course .
But I was softened by the softened aspect of the man , and felt a touch of reproach .
Is there so much hurry in this going away , that <NAME> , with a wave of her hand , sweeps on , and is gone !
He saw a strength within her that was resistless .
To complete it , she seated herself in a chair by the side of the little chair , and protectingly drew under her arm the spare hand that crept up to her .
In damp weather , the place is rendered close , by the steams of moist acts of parliament and frouzy petitions ; general postmen grow faint as they enter its infected limits , and shabby figures in quest of franks , flit restlessly to and fro like the troubled ghosts of <NAME> Letter-writers departed .
How long I have been wearing out , I do n't know ; I seemed to break down in an hour .
What queer bills are to be bought , and at what prices ?
I tell you , cruelly , <NAME> .
asked <NAME> of the gentleman whom we had found in attendance on her .
‘ Placed me in such an extremely awkward situation , ’ continued <NAME> .
You know , just accustom yourself to talk it over , with your tact and in your quiet way , with him and <NAME> , and see what you all make of it .
How is he , sir ? ’ ‘ He was very well indeed when I came away , <NAME> Peggotty. ’ ‘ There ’ s a friend ! ’ said <NAME> , stretching out his pipe .
Being roused in the morning at the appointed time , and roused with difficulty , after his late fatigues , <NAME> instructed <NAME> to make a fire in the yard of sundry pieces of old timber , and to prepare some coffee for breakfast ; for the better furnishing of which repast he entrusted him with certain small moneys ,
But we held our own without any appearance of molestation .
said the stranger , thrown off his guard ; and plainly showing that all his fears ( whatever they were ) were aroused afresh by the intelligence .
‘ <NAME> , make us truly thankful , brother Ned , ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> , that I express no opinion , one way or other , on the trust I undertake .
The old lady submitted to this piece of practical politeness with all the dignity which befitted so important and serious a solemnity , but the younger ladies , not being so thoroughly imbued with a superstitious veneration for the custom , or imagining that the value of a salute is very much enhanced if it cost a little trouble to
During the long vacation , sir , I shall devote my leisure to studying your interests more and more closely and to making arrangements for moving heaven and earth ( including , of course , the Chancellor ) after <NAME> term ; and when I ultimately congratulate you , sir , '' says <NAME> with the severity of a determined
When such a man is not deterred from regarding her as his equal , and when he has convinced himself that there is no blemish on her , I think the fact must be taken to be pretty expressive. ’ ‘ And there is such a man ? ’ said the Secretary .
What does anybody want here ?
I walked along the path towards the house , glancing at the windows , and fearing at every step to see <NAME> or <NAME> lowering out of one of them .
The suspense seemed to have taken a new lease , and to have begun afresh from a recent date .
And why does Mr Carker , passing through the people to the hall-door , think of the old woman who called to him in the Grove that morning ?
<NAME> assented to all this , and we went out immediately after breakfast to pursue our investigations .
However , sir , such as the place is , and so long as it lasts , here it is at your service . ''
What a demd savage lamb ! ’ cried <NAME> .
‘ You are an errand-boy for aught I know , ’ said <NAME> .
They have brought him to a rich end , truly !
The sun went down and she was still there .
I often look up at the stars , even from the balcony of this room , and believe that I am in the street again , shut out with <NAME> .
At two o ’ clock we took the railroad ; the travelling on which was very slow , its construction being indifferent , and the ground wet and marshy ; and arrived at <NAME> in time to dine that evening .
I had always pitied her , never so much as now .
And how dare you encourage him , you insolent minx ?
‘ The hag is out , on some preparation for your wedding festivities , I suppose , ’ said <NAME> , preparing to depart .
He laughed heartily and answered , `` No . ''
The sound was far away -- now in one quarter , now answered in another -- nor was it any guide , for it often came from shipboard , as he knew .
‘ O , sir , sir , sir ! ’ ‘ Then why , ’ retorted <NAME> , with some slight tinge of a blush , ‘ don ’ t you out with your reason for having your spoon in the soup at all ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , I will tell you the truth .
<NAME> ’ t you think so ? ’ ‘ Yes. ’ ‘ We know we have done right , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Yes. ’ ‘ We know we are better so , even now ? ’ ‘ And shall be far , far better so by-and-by. ’ Still there was that lingering tenderness in their hearts towards the old
If <NAME> thought , as she glanced at the mighty <NAME> , how agreeable it would be to have an hour ’ s gardening there , with a bright copper shovel , among the money , still she was not in an avaricious vein .
Do you believe what I am saying ? ’ ‘ I fear I must .
`` And as to <NAME> , '' resumes <NAME> .
‘ I am very happy to receive such support in my opinion , sir , ’ he rejoined .
‘ You are mad , ’ said <NAME> .
There was a distant glimmer of something that was not quite darkness , rather than of light , in the sky ; and foreboding night was shivering and restless , as the dying are who make a troubled end .
‘ That ’ s capital ! ’ he whispered , giving <NAME> such a hug that it squeezed a new expression into his face .
`` <NAME> , '' said <NAME> with a rough sort of salutation , `` you bear your wrongs more quietly than I can bear mine .
`` Me , '' said the boy , `` and <NAME> , '' patting the limp bonnet of the child he was nursing .
It seems to require much mixing and compounding .
‘ So I think , <NAME> , when they come to me .
`` Nothing but a mine below it on a busy day in term time , with all its records , rules , and precedents collected in it and every functionary belonging to it also , high and low , upward and downward , from its son the Accountant-General to its father the <NAME> , and the whole blown to atoms
The men -- the second of whom was a dark , bilious subject , in a jacket , close shaved , and with a black head of hair close cropped -- had completed their preparation of the table , and were standing looking at it .
He always sat in a particular corner , on a particular stool , which was called ‘ <NAME> ’ , after him ; here he would sit , with his grey head bent forward , attentively listening to whatever might be going on , with a profound veneration for the learning he had never been able to acquire .
The third , and not the least numerous or influential , is composed of all that delicate gentility which can not bear a superior , and can not brook an equal ; of that class whose Republicanism means , ‘ I will not tolerate a man above me : and of those below , none must approach too near ;
<NAME> , sir ! ’ ‘ Well , ma ’ am ? ’ retorted <NAME> .
Oh , <NAME> , you silly , silly , silly puss ! ''
( to the <NAME> ) it 's no use your looking frightened ; I wo n't show you no mercy , not a ha'porth of it .
His blue bag was slung over his shoulder , honest industry beamed in his eyes , a determination to proceed to <NAME> 's with cheerful briskness was indicated in his gait .
As he could read in it , however , no additional information or anything to lead him to believe he had spoken falsely ; and as Mr <NAME> , left to his own meditations , sighed deeply , and was evidently growing maudlin on the subject of Mrs <NAME> ; the dwarf soon broke up the conference and took his
And if you please , <NAME> and <NAME> and me is to see each other once a month .
He had now an opportunity of observing that as to the phrenological formation of the backs of their heads , the Professing Philanthropists were uncommonly like the Pugilists .
‘ From day to day I feel this .
He did so ; and , by the light of the lamps , saw the girl 's retreating figure , already at some distance before him .
A seal or two , a pencil-case , a pair of sleeve-buttons , and a brooch of no great value , were all .
<NAME> hastened to the window of his office , and looked in .
At once I put bills up in the windows ; for , I was in debt , and had scarcely any money , and began to be seriously alarmed by the state of my affairs .
Judged by mere worldly considerations and probabilities , his story is a very doubtful one . '
‘ I do nothing but beg and pray you to be comforted and overlook it .
‘ Or abroad. ’ ‘ Surely , ’ the <NAME> answered .
‘ No , don ’ t , ’ said <NAME> , folding his crushed hat to lay his elbow on , and bringing himself still closer to the young lady ; ‘ upon my life , you oughtn ’ t to .
We all went to church , and <NAME> gave her away .
I suppose nobody ever was in such a state of ink .
‘ Here is your letter , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Not for all the world and his wife .
`` You 'll want all day to-morrow , I suppose ? ''
`` How do you do , Mr .
His red hair hung down upon his bloodless face ; his beard was torn , and twisted into knots ; his eyes shone with a terrible light ; his unwashed flesh crackled with the fever that burnt him up .
<NAME> walk into the back shop , sir . ''
I laid her out ; and I must walk , you know .
He grasped them heartily , raised them to his lips , kissed them , and still held them .
‘ My son ’ s great capacity was tempted on , there , by a feeling of voluntary emulation and conscious pride , ’ the fond lady went on to say .
The low , bad , unimpressible face is coming up from the depths of the river , or what other depths , to the surface again .
I know how listlessly and wearily each of that wretched pair dragged on their heavy chain through a world that was poisoned to them both .
It was a pretty letter .
Something so stately , you know : so uncompromising : so very wide across the chest : so upright !
‘ <NAME> , sir , ’ said his wife , ‘ is my particular friend ; ’ and although Mr Mantalini leered till his eyes seemed in danger of never coming back to their right places again , <NAME> showed no signs of softening .
She knows that there ’ s nobody in the world I look up to , as I do to Miss <NAME> .
Yet here were the very men who had laughed the loudest at his jests , now flourishing their fists in his face , loading him with imprecations , and defying him to his teeth as a villain !
He used fur to say to me , ' I am as poor as you to-day , <NAME> , ' he ses .
The old gentleman thought that two handsomer or finer young fellows could scarcely stand side by side than those on whom he looked with so much pleasure .
‘ I don ’ t think he will , Sir. ’ ‘ Whenever I meet that <NAME> again , wherever it is , ’ said <NAME> , raising himself in bed , and indenting his pillow with a tremendous blow , ‘ I ’ ll inflict personal chastisement on him , in addition to the exposure he so richly merits
The Jew thrust his head out of the room door when <NAME> had left it ; looked after him as he walked up the dark passage ; shook his clenched fist ; muttered a deep curse ; and then , with a horrible grin , reseated himself at the table ; where he was soon deeply absorbed in the interesting
<NAME> and lustrous as she was , there was that in her face and air which seemed to separate her hopelessly from <NAME> , and from everyone , for ever more .
But you are coming my way .
There was something positively awful to me in this , and in the brightness of her eyes , as she said , looking fixedly at me : ‘ What is he doing ? ’ I repeated the words , more to myself than her , being so amazed .
‘ Not in that place , p ’ raps , ’ returned the <NAME> , with a wink .
Shortly afterwards , Mrs. <NAME> appeared .
See the plaintive often and considered as his air was feariocious and not to be allowed to go about some children being timid ( and if doubted hoping Mrs. Perkins may be brought forard for she is here and will do credit to her husband and herself and family ) .
But , in general , <NAME> has had no secrets from the bosom of affection -- I allude to his wife -- and has invariably , on our retirement to rest , recalled the events of the day .
All continued dark and silent as before .
It ’ s well I ’ m quite prepared .

The man could not be more particular as to the time at which he saw her ( he got into dense confusion when he tried to be ) , than that it must have been before nine .
That ’ s the last short speech , do you understand ? ’ Silas , released , put his hand to his throat , cleared it , and looked as if he had a rather large fishbone in that region .
Blowed if I shouldn ’ t have left out lakes , never having clapped eyes upon one , to my knowledge .
‘ I wonder that you presume to speak of impulses to me ’ -- both the teachers assented -- ‘ I am astonished ’ -- both the teachers were astonished -- ‘ I suppose it is an impulse which induces you to take the part of every grovelling and debased person that comes in your way ’ -- both the
‘ I beg pardon , ’ said <NAME> , making a leg with his hat under his arm , as he addressed himself equally to both gentlemen ; ‘ a selfish precaution on my part , and not personally interesting to anybody but myself .
Indeed , it may be said of <NAME> , that one half of it appears to be burnt down , and the other half not to be built up .
'Do n't believe that , ' said <NAME> .
Mr <NAME> heard this account with a degree of admiration not altogether consistent with the project in which he had just concurred , but his friend attached very little importance to his behavior in this respect , probably because he knew that he had influence sufficient to control <NAME> ’ s proceedings in this or any other matter , whenever
When you go downstairs , tell <NAME> so , and send her up to me ; and while I speak to her , let no one come -- not even aunt .
He said , perhaps , the best thing in the way of amends that could be said .
What more could I hope to do by prolonging the interview ?
Suddenly I came upon a pasteboard placard , beautifully written , which was lying on the desk , and bore these words : ‘ <NAME> CARE OF HIM .
The idea of being a kind of a widow , and never having been married !
Oh , my friends and fellow-countrymen , the slaves of an iron-handed and a grinding despotism !
He smiled as the mother retired down stairs ; but his face fell , as the daughter followed .
The looks of all of them were dark , repressed , and revengeful , as they listened to the countryman 's story ; the manner of all of them , while it was secret , was authoritative too .
Then he drew his feet together , and made a low , grave bow , and then put out his left hand .
In these matrimonial dialogues they never addressed each other , but always some invisible presence that appeared to take a station about midway between them .
‘ Wait outside a few minutes , <NAME> , will you ? ’ said <NAME> .
`` What is the matter with you now ? ''
A little owl could stare .
It happened that an old lord of great family , who was going to marry a young lady of no family in particular , came with the young lady , and the young lady ’ s sister , to witness the ceremony of trying on two nuptial bonnets which had been ordered the day before , and <NAME> announcing the
<NAME> <NAME> , very apoplectic , still exhibits his deportment about town , still enjoys himself in the old manner , is still believed in in the old way .

Grandfather Smallweed inquires of <NAME> , <NAME> 's twin sister .
In the midst of her incoherence , she stops , looks at her daughter , cries out that her wits are going , and hides her face upon the bed .
I have a child who will soon call <NAME> by the name by which I call you .
‘ Did you ? ’ <NAME> retorted .
No sense reported anything unusual there .
There they had been waiting for her , many and many a night , no doubt .
But he no more dreamed that <NAME> looked on <NAME> , as it were , from a new and far-off place ; that while his eyes often sought the lovely face , they seldom met its open glance of sisterly affection , but withdrew themselves when hers were raised towards him ; than he believed that it was <NAME> ’
Lying down again with his eyes shut , he heard the Apothecary say , out of the room and quite a long way off -- or he dreamed it -- that there was a want of vital power ( what was that , <NAME> wondered ! )
However , I told him I was T. Copperfield , <NAME> , and he believed it , and gave me the letter , which he said required an answer .
This was her husband ’ s verdict , and he justified it by telling her that she had begun her married life as the most endearing creature that could possibly be .
‘ It ’ s the fine arts that bring me out of bed , <NAME> , ’ returned the lady .
<NAME> <NAME> came to a squeezed house , with a ramshackle bowed front , little dingy windows , and a little dark area like a damp waistcoat-pocket , which he found to be number twenty-four , <NAME> , <NAME> .
It is a pleasant thing to see that the sun has been there ; to know that the air and light are on them every day ; to feel that they ARE children , and lead children ’ s lives ; that if their pillows be damp , it is with the dews of <NAME> , and not with tears
There would be the dangerous villain : the man I hate : gone ; another secured in his place ; and my influence over the girl , with a knowledge of this crime to back it , unlimited . '
The breakfast ended in a perfect understanding .
How the time wears , I know not ; until I am recalled by my child-wife ’ s old companion .
and he won ’ t come in. ’ ‘ Who ? ’ cried Mr Dombey .
Stop him ! ” The cattle came upon me with like suddenness , staring out of their eyes , and steaming out of their nostrils , “ Halloa , young thief ! ” One black ox , with a white cravat on , -- who even had to my awakened conscience something of a clerical air , -- fixed me
`` I thank you for your preparation , '' returns <NAME> after a silence , without moving hand , foot , or feature , `` which I hope is not necessary ; though I give it credit for being well intended .
‘ Just keep your eye upon him for a few minutes , ’ murmured <NAME> .
‘ I have brought your bread , <NAME> , ’ said he ( they all spoke in <NAME> , but the little man was an <NAME> ) ; ‘ and if I might recommend you not to game -- ’ ‘ You don ’ t recommend the master ! ’ said <NAME> , showing his teeth as he smiled .
‘ Take off your cap , child , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ and let me see you. ’ My mother was too much afraid of her to refuse compliance with this odd request , if she had any disposition to do so .
' I was a regular cunning sneak when I was at school .
Nearly two thousand pounds profit from him already though .

interposed the nurse , hastily depositing in her pocket a green glass bottle , the contents of which she had been tasting in a corner with evident satisfaction .
His linen ! ’ said Mr Brass smiling fondly at the wall , ‘ his linen which was always of a particular colour , for such was his whim and fancy -- how plain I see his linen now ! ’ ‘ You had better go on , sir , ’ said <NAME> impatiently .
Something at which you can get your equal chance. ’ Occasionally the game would wax very brisk indeed , and would be kept up with a smartness rendering such an encounter as this quite tame .
‘ <NAME> , stay , ’ said <NAME> .
At last , the old woman and the niece came in , -- the latter with a head not easily distinguishable from her dusty broom , -- and testified surprise at sight of me and the fire .
‘ No , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , turning his oilskin cap round and round ; ‘ we ’ re a doin ’ pretty well , <NAME> ; we haven ’ t no cause to complain in the worldly way , <NAME> .
And again , for anything I knew , the proffered information might have some important bearing on the flight itself .
or , ’ said the <NAME> , raising his voice as much as to say , observe the point of this , ‘ is it The <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Ned , ’ said the old man , drawing <NAME> to his side , and taking his arm tenderly through his , ‘ I know .
But come in , come in ! ’ The old man limped on before , and warning her of the downward step , which he achieved himself with no small difficulty , led the way into his little cottage .
‘ It is , ’ replied the driver , rubbing himself as if he ached , after throwing the reins to the ostler .
‘ Good gracious , <NAME> , ’ returned the <NAME> , ‘ I said tonight ’ s a week , that I ’ d come tonight , didn ’ t I ?
On two or three occasions he was employed on business which took him to a distance , and had formerly been transacted by <NAME> .
Having revolved these things in his mind and arrived at this conclusion , he communicated to Mr Swiveller as much of his meditations as he thought proper ( <NAME> would have been perfectly satisfied with less ) , and giving him the day to recover himself from his late salamandering , accompanied him at evening to Mr Quilp ’ s
While she sat weeping , it grew late , and dreary midnight tolled out from the steeples .
‘ Tell him I am sorry that we ever met. ’ ‘ No more ? ’ said <NAME> after a pause .
He always knew where the plump sister was .
He had risen , as his father had before him , in the course of life and death , from <NAME> to <NAME> , and for nearly twenty years had been the sole representative of the Firm .
<NAME> , if you let her in but once , only to look upon me for one moment as I lie here , I shall die . ''
I believe -- at least I know -- that he was not rich .
Still , the average duration of human life is proved to have increased of late years .
Let him keep his eye on those chimneys , going on as straight as ever he can , and presently he 'll see 'em down a turning on the left , shut in by a great brick wall which forms one side of the street .
Could I ever be happy again , <NAME> ? ’ Despite his vexation and concern , <NAME> could scarcely help smiling , as he rejoined , ‘ Now , do you think , mother , that such a result would be likely to ensue from the most cruel repulse ? ’ ‘ Upon my word , my dear , I
‘ You wanted the lord , did you ? ’ he said , stopping short when he reached the door , as if a new light had broken in upon him , and confronting <NAME> again .
And still , through all this grotesque revival of what he remembered as having once been prettily natural to her , he could not but feel that it revived at sight of him , and that there was a tender memory in it .
‘ I made submission , being on the wrong side of the bolts and bars ; and as you were not the made man then that you are now , you were glad enough to take back a clerk who wasn ’ t over nice , and who knew something of the trade you drove. ’ ‘ You begged and
While extinguishing the candles , <NAME> , quite as a matter of course took up the glass from which that honest gentleman had drunk , and coolly tossed it under the grate , where it fell shivering into fragments .
As I had never even heard of the first remedy , and always had the second in the closet , I gave Mrs. Crupp a glass of the second , which ( that I might have no suspicion of its being devoted to any improper use ) she began to take in my presence .
It ’ s nat ’ ral in young folk , <NAME> ’ r <NAME> , when they ’ re new to these here trials , and timid , like my little bird , -- it ’ s nat ’ ral. ’ She clung the closer to him , but neither lifted up her face , nor spoke a word .
If I could be dyed black , and made <NAME> ’ s slave , I should consider it a compliment .
With such rich golden hair , such soft blue eyes , and such a bright , innocent , trusting face !
Some despairing gingerbread that had been vainly trying to dispose of itself all over the country , and had cast a quantity of dust upon its head in its mortification , again appealed to the public from an infirm booth .
But let him look at me , in prison , and in bonds here .
All the little changes that had crept in when the Heeps were there , were changed again .
“ You , is it , <NAME> ? ” “ It is , <NAME> .
After whom I remember nothing but an average equality of failure .
I shall do well enough , and so will my husband .
He stops in his rubbing and looks at her , with his hands on his knees .
This capital of the state of <NAME> is a bustling , busy town , with a great deal of traffic of various kinds , and in particular of water commerce .
I loved my darling so well that I was more concerned for their effect on her than on any one .
The company might have had other engagements , or they might have felt their inferiority , but in any case they dispersed by degrees , and not being replaced by other company , left their new patron in possession of the Break of Day .
I thought it possible that I could truly love one creature in the world , and not love the rest ; I thought it possible that I could truly mourn for one creature gone out of the world , and not have some part in the grief of all who mourned .
<NAME> <NAME> , I understood , was also a bright particular star ; but it was his misfortune to have his glory a little dimmed by the extraordinary lustre of <NAME> .
As I passed the steps of the portico , I encountered , at the corner , a woman ’ s face .
`` Will somebody give me a quart pot ? ''
Not they , but they 'll be upon the minds of some of the young fellows , some of these days , and make 'em precious low-spirited .
You don ’ t know him half as well as I do , <NAME> .
It was not until even the dusty cloud was no longer to be seen , that the gazers dispersed .
Would you allow me to look at it ?
When she answered fervently , she well knew that , she never forgot it , he touched upon his second and more delicate point -- the suspicion he had formed .
I never saw him afterwards , but I sometimes imagine that I descry a faint reflection of him in <NAME> .
It is that which makes me bold .
‘ Nobody dead , is there ? ’ said <NAME> , alarmed at the horror in <NAME> ’ s countenance .

I ’ ll have it out of you in full , Boffin. ’ ‘ Dear me ! ’ cried that unfortunate gentleman .
That the recollection of your true consideration for her always , can never be forgotten by her .
The room was but small , and the clients seemed to have had a habit of backing up against the wall ; the wall , especially opposite to <NAME> 's chair , being greasy with shoulders .
‘ Now , I may be wrong in my conclusions ; it is very likely that I am , but my individual impression is , that the gulf between my family and <NAME> may be traced to an apprehension , on the part of my family , that <NAME> would require pecuniary accommodation .
These had been oiled and oiled , until the two tall candles on the table in the middle of the room were gloomily reflected on every leaf ; as if _they_ were buried , in deep graves of black mahogany , and no light to speak of could be expected from them until they were dug out .
It was constantly before him all at once .
They were yet in the ardour of their work , when the child , raising her head from the ground over which she bent , observed that the bachelor was sitting on the stile close by , watching them in silence .
In a kind of heedlessness , for which I can not blame myself enough , I have , I have no doubt , mentioned Mr Carker the <NAME> much oftener than was necessary ; and have allowed his name sometimes to slip through my lips , when it was against your expressed wish .
‘ For what did I say to myself arter having amused myself with that there stretch of a comic idea , as a sort of a playful game ?
‘ But I dare say I could scribble something now and then , that would suit you. ’ ‘ We ’ ll have a new show-piece out directly , ’ said the manager .
‘ Because I could remember , when I was a child , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ but that is very , very long ago , or at least it seems so .
And all that night the coffin stands ready by the old portmanteau ; and the lonely figure on the bed , whose path in life has lain through five and forty years , lies there with no more track behind him that any one can trace than a deserted infant .
‘ _I_ mean of the foreign man , ’ said <NAME> .
Good-bye. ’ The cordial face she lifted up to his to kiss him , was his home , his life , his universe , and yet it was a portion of his punishment and grief ; for in the cloud he saw upon it -- though serene and calm as any radiant cloud at sunset -- and in the constancy

“ His goods , ” said <NAME> , after turning it over in his mind , “ is a branch of <NAME> goods. ” “ Persons ' bodies , ai n't it , father ? ” asked the lively boy .
My father ( a farmer ) made a will and left his farm and stock and so forth to my mother for her life .
“ And she might credit it .

But even to get the very doubtful and preliminary stage of making the appeal , seemed one of the least promising of human undertakings .
He had been clearing his head with a lotion of cold water , as a good preparative to providing hot water for the heads of the jury , and had been reading with the neck of his shirt thrown wide open that he might the more freely choke the opposite witnesses .
‘ I asked him to come. ’ ‘ I am sorry to hear it .
What I said was low ; that 's what it was ; low .
When he has done so , he looks out again at the falling sleet and snow and listens again for the returning steps .

‘ He works , ’ he said , ‘ as bold as a man can .
That , he considered it plain that such price was stateable in a single expressive word , and that the word was , ‘ Halves ! ’ That , the question then arose when ‘ Halves ! ’ should be called .

The sun was striking in at the great windows of the court , through the glittering drops of rain upon the glass , and it made a broad shaft of light between the two-and-thirty and the Judge , linking both together , and perhaps reminding some among the audience how both were passing on , with absolute equality , to

And at the same time there emerged from scores of bye-streets , lanes , and nameless turnings , innumerable people , carrying their dinners to the bakers ' shops .

I told him what I had come for .
‘ You see , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> -- ‘ and I hope you see too , <NAME> -- there are many little ways in which I can be slightly useful to you , if you will make no stranger of me ; and in which I shall be delighted to be so .
Nor had she any symptoms of declining , in the course of the ensuing week , when the constitutional viands still continued to disappear in regular succession , notwithstanding that <NAME> studied her as attentively as ever , and occupied his usual seat between the black skirts and the fender , with unwavering constancy .
<NAME> , <NAME> , it would do us no harm to remember oftener than we do , that vices are sometimes only virtues carried to excess !
‘ Now , <NAME> , attend to what I am going to say , and promise and vow to be obedient. ’ ‘ I promise and vow , my dear. ’ ‘ You ask no questions .
`` I have suspected it a long while -- fully known it a little while . ''
Do you hear me say he struck me ? ’ ‘ I hear , I hear , ’ replied one of those who held him .
It sickened her , for blows fell heavily and cruelly on the quiet of the night .
Of her father ’ s being groundlessly suspected , she felt sure .
If I must come backwards and forwards , ’ mused the <NAME> with a dejected face , ‘ I may as well have something to come for. ’ ‘ Something to come for ? ’ screamed the old woman .
Is it fear or is it anger now ?
I stopped at the umble point of my learning , and says I , “ Hold hard ! ” When you offered to teach me <NAME> , I knew better .
The warm-hearted darling leaned across her cousin <NAME> and kissed me , and then looking up in his face , boldly said , `` At all events , cousin <NAME> , I WILL thank you for the companion you have given me . ''

That ’ s the general panoramic view. ’ Having so held and waved the candle as that all these heterogeneous objects seemed to come forward obediently when they were named , and then retire again , Mr Venus despondently repeats , ‘ Oh dear me , dear me ! ’ resumes his seat , and with drooping despondency upon him

It was , to conceal what had occurred , from those who were going away ; and to dismiss them on their voyage in happy ignorance .
‘ Is my pa in , do you know ? ’ asked <NAME> with dignity .
<NAME> at this in my hand .
`` Disgrace never comes to <NAME> , '' returns the housekeeper .
The old woman eyed him slily , and hitching her chair nearer his , and looking in at the parrot , who came down from the gilded dome at her call , said : ‘ Out of place now , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Never you mind , <NAME> , ’ returned the <NAME> , shortly .
She ca n't know anything about me though , ' added <NAME> after a moment 's silence .
‘ I ’ ll find him , I warrant you. ’ With which assurance , <NAME> bounced into the dormitory , and , swinging his cane in the air ready for a blow , darted into the corner where the lean body of the drudge was usually stretched at night .
'Tell your governor that <NAME> and <NAME> is here , will you ? '
`` Now , <NAME> , '' he said to me as we walked quickly away .
And that it was a highly agreeable boast to both of us , and that we must both be very proud of it , was a conclusion quite established in his own mind .
The <NAME> did not go to bed for a long time .
You will understand , then , that when your dear friend complimented me , he really condoled with me ; that when he soothed me under my vexations , he laid bare every smarting wound I had ; that when he declared my ‘ faithful swain ’ to be ‘ the most loving young fellow in the world , with
Perhaps her admiration , such as it was , had originated long ago , when she first found anything that was beautiful appearing in the midst of the squalid fight of her existence .
You have long had a good model before you , in your cousin <NAME> .
Then would he come down to that house with a slap upon the table , and meet the honourable gentleman foot to foot .
‘ If you want to cheek us , pay your ochre at the doors and take it out. ’ ‘ Kidderminster , ’ said <NAME> , raising his voice , ‘ stow that ! —Sir , ’ to <NAME> , ‘ I was addressing myself to you .
‘ Yet I have gained a wonderful power over her , too , let her be as much in earnest as she will ! ’ The reflection brought back the yielding of her face and form as she had drooped under his gaze .
<NAME> , give me an old friend ’ s arm upstairs ! ’ <NAME> hastened to him .
After a few other preliminaries , equally brief , and having settled the road each party should take to avoid suspicion , they separated .
Let it be. ” “ But , <NAME> .
Shortly afterwards , <NAME> appeared , looking lovely , <NAME> thought ; and attired in such a number of skirts that it was quite an excursion to walk round her .
But you have brought the elegant turn-out , my love ? ’ ‘ No , Pa. ’ ‘ You never can have walked , my dear ? ’ ‘ Yes , I have , Pa. ’ He looked so very much astonished , that <NAME> could not make up her mind to break it to him just yet .
This is not unselfish in me .
The upshot of it all was , that <NAME> was in raptures with him , and that they went upstairs to breakfast .
The old man listened with great attention , and when he had concluded , drew his arm eagerly through his own .
The dolls ’ dressmaker sat in her corner behind the door , with her eyes on the ground and her hands folded on her basket , holding her crutch-stick between them , and appearing to take no heed of anything .
Meanwhile , <NAME> enjoyed unmolested the full flavour of the gold knob at the top of his cane , as he would have done to the end of the interview if <NAME> had not come home , and caused the conversation to turn to his favourite topic .

‘ Your people don ’ t usually travel in character , do they ? ’ said <NAME> , pointing to the dresses of the dogs .
I WON ’ T confine myself to four -- eight , sixteen , two-and-thirty , rather than say anything calculated to overturn the <NAME> ’ s plans. ’ ‘ Wickfield ’ s plans , ’ said the <NAME> , stroking his face , and looking penitently at his adviser .
Where are you bound for ? ” “ For the <NAME> , I think , ” said I .
`` I am very sure , sir , '' returned <NAME> , `` that I speak for <NAME> too when I say that you have the strongest power over us both -- rooted in respect , gratitude , and affection -- strengthening every day . ''
It was evident that in all this he had merely been imitating the motions of my fingers , and placing his hand upon the key , cup , & c. , as part of the process , without any perception of the relation between the sign and the object .
Nevertheless , Mr <NAME> played so well -- some games with the Major , and some with <NAME> , whose vigilance of eye in respect of Mr Dombey and <NAME> no lynx could have surpassed -- that he even heightened his position in the lady-mother ’ s good graces ; and when on taking leave he regretted that he would

‘ Yes , and I am afraid I was seldom or never as good as I ought to have been , <NAME> .
‘ I shall not require the carriage at night , ’ said <NAME> .
What devil possesses you ? ’ ‘ Their name is <NAME> , ’ she replied , uprearing her proud form as if she would have crushed him ; ‘ you and your master have raised them in a fruitful house , and they shall tear you both .
In the meantime Mr Toots , who had come upstairs after her , all unconscious of the effect he produced , announced himself with his knuckles on the door , and walked in very briskly .
Fortified by such encouragement , he could venture to say <NAME> ; and now <NAME> ’ s mind was relieved .
‘ I don ’ t know , ’ replied <NAME> pettishly .
'It 's quite a cruelty , ' said <NAME> .
Here was a new inducement to dissipation , presented to that sport of circumstances , Mr Perch the Messenger !

You put it away somewhere , and you kept your own counsel where .
At about mid-day , we set out for the office of <NAME> and <NAME> , in <NAME> ’ Commons .
He had charged himself with drink , for the playing out of his game , and was impatient to begin .

After groping about in the gallery for some time , attempting in the dim light to decipher the numbers on the different doors , he at length appealed to a pot-boy , who happened to be pursuing his morning occupation of gleaning for pewter .
‘ <NAME> was naturally a headlong , careless sort of dog , and he had had five tumblers of hot punch into the bargain ; so , although he was a little startled at first , he began to grow rather indignant when he saw the old gentleman winking and leering at him with such an impudent air .
‘ What do you suppose he meant ? ’ ‘ Mas ’ r <NAME> , ’ he replied , ‘ I ’ ve put the question to myself a mort o ’ times , and never found no answer .
‘ To see you married , <NAME> -- to see you a dilluded wictim , and thinkin ’ in your innocence that it ’ s all wery capital , ’ replied <NAME> .
' A few -- a very few -- will suffice , <NAME> , ' said the young man , drawing his chair towards her .
She has beauty still , and if it be not in its heyday , it is not yet in its autumn .
‘ But will you have the goodness just to call me that again , sir ? ’ ‘ I didn ’ t make use of the word in any invidious sense , ma ’ am , ’ replied <NAME> , growing somewhat uneasy on his own account .
And now , while he was composed , and hoped that he could meet the end with quiet heroism , a new action began in his waking thoughts , which was very difficult to master .
‘ In the course of the week , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ we shall be happy to see <NAME> to tea .
When I got thy letter , I easily believen that what the yoong ledy sen and done to me , and what her brother sen and done to me , was one , and that there were a wicked plot betwixt ’ em .
No ; you are strict , you are ; we must wait over twelve o ’ clock , and get into Monday .
‘ They were poor -- they could not be otherwise when the man pursued such courses ; but the woman ’ s unceasing and unwearied exertions , early and late , morning , noon , and night , kept them above actual want .
Let me have a word with you outside . '
One of you gentlemen has a servant called <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Both , ’ replied the notary .
Big Vig ’ -- and the count was proceeding to enter <NAME> in his tablets , as a gentleman of the long robe , who derived his name from the profession to which he belonged , when Mrs. Leo <NAME> interposed .
I admired and loved him , and his approval was return enough .
‘ Still , so it was , ’ continued Mrs. Micawber .
They both entered after me -- the last springing in , after putting up the steps .
<NAME> <NAME> was in high feather and spirits , but a little nervous withal .
The commissary having been buried with all the decorations suitable to the service ( the whole team of proprieties were harnessed to his hearse , and they all had feathers and black velvet housings with his coat of arms in the corner ) , <NAME> began to inquire what quantity of dust and ashes was deposited at the bankers ’
It was a good thought .
If I go farther , and observe that I can not readily conceive how ANY right of mine can be a minor point , I speak not so much in reference to myself as an individual as in reference to the family position I have it in charge to maintain . ''
‘ What ’ s this ? ’ said the single gentleman thrusting out his head .
Those who were appointed of old to go to wicked kings and accuse them -- were they not ministers and servants ?
If your <NAME> said to Me -- I have given you his exact words , “ Louisa , I want nothing ; I am better by myself ” -- what do you think he ’ d say to you ?
For certain , <NAME> looked that way , when a chill air came up , and when it passed on murmuring , as if it whispered something that made the phantom trees and water tremble -- or threaten -- for fancy might have made it either .
He drew in his head ; and <NAME> , left standing in the street , could hear the sash closed , as gently and carefully as it had been opened .
They let you off easily enough , ” sneered <NAME> .
The preparations without doors had not been neglected either ; a nun of great personal attractions was telling her beads on the little portico over the door ; and a brigand with the blackest possible head of hair , and the clearest possible complexion , was at that moment going round the town in a cart , consulting the miniature
I had when I first entered on it , and a good man he was .
`` I covet nothing , '' said <NAME> in the same light way .
How I persuaded myself that this was likely , I do n't know .
You gave me leave , at any time within a year , to renew the subject of our last discourse . '
he cried , upon his knees .
‘ It made ma cry when she knew it , ’ interposed <NAME> , ‘ but we kept it from her for a long time ; and pa was very low in his spirits , but he is better now ; and I was very ill , but I am better too. ’ ‘ Would you give your great-uncle Lillyvick
‘ Dear me ! ’ exclaimed the old lady .
Early in the afternoon , <NAME> walked direct from his own house into the country , to be taken up on the line by which he was to travel ; and at night the remaining two set forth upon their different course , encouraged by not seeing any face they knew .
A nephew whom they had brought up was a frequent visitor at the house , among many other visitors ; and he began to pay me attention .
After this , they went home .
We don ’ t walk like that .
We went on our way upstairs after this episode ; and , as we were going up , we met a gentleman groping his way down .
says the coroner with a melancholy shake of the head .
<NAME> 's resolute right hand was occupied with an axe , in place of the usual softer implements , and in her girdle were a pistol and a cruel knife .
To her succeeded another lady , claiming to be a pauper , whose wealth was found wrapped up in little scraps of paper and old rag .
You ’ ll be hurt. ’ ‘ Wait one instant , <NAME> .
‘ Where shall we drive you , sir ? ’ said the post-boy .
You know -- dear me , what a very elegant button this is , <NAME> !
And very much indebted for the omen .
‘ You will not take the air to-day , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ And that ? ’ inquired the dwarf , wheeling round and pointing straight at me .
the other man seemed to answer ; 'could I mistake him , think you ?
Perhaps you will sleep in your own room ?
As she would not hear of staying to dinner , lest she should by any chance fail to arrive at home with the grey pony before dark ; and as I apprehend <NAME> knew her too well to argue any point with her ; some lunch was provided for her there , and <NAME> went back to her governess ,
'What if I did it ! '
I found <NAME> to be a middle-aged gentleman , with a short throat , and a good deal of shirt-collar , who only wanted a black nose to be the portrait of a pug-dog .
This is the third time of your hinting and threatening .
He had been married now a year ; and Mrs. <NAME> had never released him from her determined pity a moment .
In the heavy air of the room , and the heavy darkness that brooded in its remoter corners , I even had an alarming fancy that <NAME> and I might presently begin to decay .
Yielding at once to the impulse of her affection , timid at all other times , but bold in its truth to him in his adversity , and undaunted by past repulse , <NAME> , dressed as she was , hurried downstairs .
That done , she came softly back and stood by the side of my chair .
A man who had been soaked in water , and smothered in mud , and lamed by stones , and cut by flints , and stung by nettles , and torn by briars ; who limped , and shivered , and glared , and growled ; and whose teeth chattered in his head as he seized me by the chin
I urged upon him the necessity of its being dug up , and the paper being legally produced and established .
‘ Oh , don ’ t you think he ’ s changed ? ’ said Mrs. Heep .
It is no mistake of mine , surely , to suppose that his having gained the priceless blessing of his life , is one cause of the animosity shown to him by his brother. ’ ‘ You touch upon a subject that is never breathed between us ; not even between us , ’ said <NAME> .
Only four of them passed .
In her own old place sat <NAME> , once more , looking ( but for her dress ) as if she had never left it .
Only one among them , one of the gentlemen belonging to the party of three , made advances towards conversation .
He made my heart ache very often. ’ ‘ It is a good heart , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ that disentangles itself from the close avocations of every day , to heed such things .
She is considered so ( I have heard ) among the clerks in the <NAME> , and it is a point more in their way than in mine .
‘ This good king had a queen , who eighteen years before , had had a son , who was called <NAME> .
But when these arrangements were completed and everything was in order , I paid a visit of a few hours to <NAME> , which something in the letter I had destroyed at <NAME> had induced me to decide upon in my own mind .
But <NAME> ’ s solicitude to get to her father , and to carry the joyful tidings to him , and not to leave him in his jail a moment with this happiness in store for him and still unknown to him , did more for her speedy restoration than all the skill and attention on earth could have done
I was sitting in front of the box one night with <NAME> , and <NAME> was in the place he liked best , behind <NAME> 's chair , when , happening to look down into the pit , I saw <NAME> , with his hair flattened down upon his head and woe depicted in his face , looking up at
‘ <NAME> ’ nly not , ’ replied <NAME> ; ‘ what ’ s the good o ’ flannel veskits to the young niggers abroad ?
I think -- I mean , he told us -- that he had been in practice three or four years and that if he could have hoped to contend through three or four more , he would not have made the voyage on which he was bound .
<NAME> <NAME> , <NAME> , do n't you say a word nor yet stir .
He awoke to this , and he awoke to more .
‘ It might have been better for <NAME> to have known some hardships , ’ he says , defiantly .
All this time I had never been able to consider my own situation , nor could I do so yet .
Either the master or the manner of this remark , which was made very ruefully , delighted <NAME> so much , that his consequent shout of laughter roused the Jew from his reverie , and induced him to inquire what was the matter .
Through costly-coloured glass and paper-mended window , through cathedral dome and rotten crevice , it shed its equal ray .
I am not a coward , <NAME> , but to tell you a secret , I am a little afraid of Jack. ’ ‘ No , no !
If <NAME> had not decided against falling in love with <NAME> ; if he had had the weakness to do it ; if he had , little by little , persuaded himself to set all the earnestness of his nature , all the might of his hope , and all the wealth of his matured character , on that cast
Neither did he call it a curious coincidence that true patriotism was _his_ only motive too .
‘ My sister , you see , she ’ s that fond of you and yourn , and that accustomed to think on ’ y of her own country , that it wouldn ’ t be hardly fair to let her go .
However , he was resolved to stick to the <NAME> ; and so the work of form-filling , corresponding , minuting , memorandum-making , signing , counter-signing , counter-counter-signing , referring backwards and forwards , and referring sideways , crosswise , and zig-zag , recommenced .
I say , ‘ Come in ! ’ but someone taps again .
As the time so passed , this slinking business became a more and more precarious one .
He could detect a design upon it when nobody else had any perception of the fact .
That , his position and attitude were , on the whole , sublime .
Yet even when his eyes were opened on the mist and rain , on the moving patch of light from the lamps , and the hedge at the roadside retreating by jerks , the night shadows outside the coach would fall into the train of the night shadows within .
Now , your inclinations are to be consulted .
‘ There , ’ said <NAME> , holding the door open , and looking triumphantly round at <NAME> , ‘ there ’ s a room ! ’ <NAME> ’ s face , however , betokened such a very trifling portion of satisfaction at the appearance of his lodging , that <NAME> looked , for a reciprocity of feeling , into
What is the matter ? ’ ‘ <NAME> dare you , ’ said the old man , turning round on <NAME> , ‘ how dare you do it ?
`` He never finishes what he begins to say !
Early as it was , on the windy March morning , the room in which he lay abed was already scrubbed throughout ; and between the cups and saucers arranged for breakfast , and the lumbering deal table , a very clean white cloth was spread .
The Father of the <NAME> condescended towards his brother as an amiable , well-meaning man ; a private character , who had not arrived at distinction .
'Here his is , coming down the street . '
It was her lord himself who became -- unlike the last theme in the mind , according to the observation of most philosophers -- the subject of Mrs Flintwinch ’ s dream .
Now , what have you got to say to me , eh ? ’ <NAME> made no reply ; for the little pink pocket-handkerchief was in full force .
I don ’ t see why he shouldn ’ t be .
said the beadle , raising his hand with a show of authority .
This he knows , and knowing , still offers me his hand .
He cast his despairing eyes downward towards the form from which it had proceeded , and , shuddering from head to foot , looked round .
Occasionally , the old agony comes back : a very little thing will revive it ; even a familiar sound , or the scent of summer flowers in the air ; but it does not last long , now : for the world without , has come to be the vision , and this solitary life , the sad reality
still going on ; but where !
‘ I am thy poor friend , with all my heart and mind. ’ [ Picture : <NAME> and <NAME> in the sick room ] The wounds of which she had spoken , seemed to be about the neck of the self-made outcast .
I made myself known to your sister .
His clothes were shabby , but he had an imposing shirt-collar on .
`` Only hear that , <NAME> , '' said Mrs. Cratchit .
I told you from the first , <NAME> , that I never give hopes .
Good-night. ’ Again he turned towards the wicket , where the satellite , with his eye upon his chief , remained a dumb statue .
<NAME> over , we get into another vehicle which is ready at the door ( for the coach has been changed in the interval ) , and resume our journey ; which continues through the same kind of country until evening , when we come to the town where we are to stop for tea and supper ; and having
I suppose the opening prospect confused me .
‘ You were always a favourite of hers , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ always were from the first .
The child looked round the room as she took her seat .
The cat remains where they found her , still snarling at the something on the ground before the fire and between the two chairs .
Say so over and over again , if you have the heart to think so. ” “ If you have the heart to be so , you mean , <NAME> , ” said I , in a virtuous and superior tone ; “ do n't put it off upon me .
And their assembled friends being not a bit behindhand , roared out lustily .
I have tried hard to think it not worth remembering , but I can not make so little of it .
Second : them poor things well out o ' this , and never no more will I interfere with Mrs. Cruncher 's flopping , never no more ! ” “ Whatever housekeeping arrangement that may be , ” said <NAME> , striving to dry her eyes and compose herself , “ I have no doubt it is best that Mrs.
‘ There ’ s an unfortunate devil , who has got a friend on the poor side , that ’ s glad to do anything of that sort .
‘ When we first spoke together , <NAME> , you told me that your sister had risen out of the disadvantages of your past lives as superior to you as the tower of <NAME> Cathedral is higher than the chimneys of <NAME> .
An exhausted composure , a worn-out placidity , an equanimity of fatigue not to be ruffled by interest or satisfaction , are the trophies of her victory .
She had not a good place , she said ; the wages were low , and the work was hard .
After bidding the old man good night , <NAME> retired to her poor garret , but had scarcely closed the door , when it was gently tapped at .
<NAME> vapouring , combined with the extravagant plots of <NAME> for the restoration of a state of things that had utterly exhausted itself , and worn out Heaven and earth as well as itself , was hard to be endured without some remonstrance by any sane man who knew the truth .
‘ When that was gone , sir , ’ resumed <NAME> , ‘ and it did go , though I dribbled it out like so much blood , I had taken Mr Rugg into the secret .
She was bent , they told me , on committing suicide .
With very little excuse for departing so abruptly , <NAME> left him , and , greatly disappointing the loiterers outside the house by telling them there was nothing the matter , got into the coach , and was driven to his own home .
So stimulated , the business was extremely brisk , and the articles in stock went off with the greatest celerity .
The stranger recognised his friends immediately ; and , darting forward and seizing <NAME> by the hand , dragged him to a seat with his usual impetuosity , talking all the while as if the whole of the arrangements were under his especial patronage and direction .
It was nearly nine o ’ clock when he reached <NAME> .
He came into my mind as connected with his old chivalrous manner of mentioning my mother 's name and with what my guardian had informed me of his engagement to her sister and his unconscious connexion with her unhappy story .
Did she send here for you ? ’ ‘ No .
O ye sun , moon , and stars , the great man !
On the grounds that you may take me where you will , and get me sworn to it .
`` I am not quite myself , '' returns the trooper ; `` I have been a little put out , Mrs .
You may do anything with me if you only show me children .
The <NAME> , with an abashed and guilty air , immediately walked on tiptoe to the little parlour and locked himself in .
I tell you this , that you may know we knew enough of you to persuade Mr Boffin to let us lead you on , deluded , to the last possible moment , in order that your disappointment might be the heaviest possible disappointment .
At least I -- I should think he was. ’ ‘ Georgiana , darling ! ’ said <NAME> , holding up a forefinger , ‘ Take care ! ’ ‘ Oh my goodness me ! ’ exclaimed <NAME> , reddening .
He is pointing at an empty chair and at a stain upon the ground before it that might be almost covered with a hand .
The round of visits was made ; and <NAME> , with a discreet use of his blue coaching , came off triumphantly , though with a considerable accession of boredom .
Then would the noble lord , or right honourable gentleman , in whose department it was to defend the <NAME> Office , put an orange in his pocket , and make a regular field-day of the occasion .
That ’ s nothing , <NAME> ! ’ ‘ Truly , it ain ’ t as much as one could sometimes wish it to be , my dear , ’ he admitted , drawing his hand across his mouth .
‘ There ’ s only one way in which money can be made of it , and that is by taking it to her .
He had just come home .
But the last item was long , long , long , in linking itself to the rest .
‘ <NAME> , ’ exclaimed <NAME> , with glistening eyes : ‘ <NAME> and <NAME> , imagine <NAME> , when he was the smallest of juniors , diving for me , catching me , a big heavy senior , by the hair of the head , and striking out for the shore with me like a water-giant ! ’ ‘
They asked me to be industrious and faithful , and I promised to be so .
How many times I went up and down the street , and round the square -- painfully aware of being a much better answer to the old riddle than the original one -- before I could persuade myself to go up the steps and knock , is no matter now .
‘ Now , boy ! ’ said Mr Carker , putting his hand on young <NAME> ’ s shoulder , and bringing him out into the middle of the room .
In a word , ' said the young lady , turning away , as her temporary firmness forsook her , 'there is a stain upon my name , which the world visits on innocent heads .
'Come near the fire , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
You to go before me ; you to go alone ; you to go , and I to remain !
‘ Oh Jeremiah ! ’ cried <NAME> , waking .
‘ A word. ’ I confronted <NAME> alone .
The house was no longer theirs .
Did he leave them here ?
‘ Was there ever such a -- !
We had a beautiful little dinner .
Now I ’ ve took the liberty of coming here -- ‘ Won ’ t you sit down ? ’ said Mr Carker , smiling .
`` Well , '' he proceeds , throwing off his disappointment , `` next and last , those plans of mine .
`` Tony , '' he says hurriedly to his astonished companion , `` let us be quick in putting the things together and in getting out of this place .
As his fancy died out , I would no more have tried to strengthen any power I had , than I would have married him on his being forced to take me for his wife .
Have you dined with <NAME> yet ? ” “ Not yet. ” “ Well , ” said <NAME> , “ he 'll give you wine , and good wine .
Not to risk being done out of the sweat of my brow , by any chances , I should wish afore going further to be swore in. ’ ‘ I am not a swearer in of people , man. ’ The visitor , clearly anything but reliant on this assurance , doggedly muttered ‘ Alfred David. ’ ‘ Is that
‘ “ But I am not joking ; I was never farther from it , ” remonstrated the baron .
‘ What can <NAME> think when he hears you ? ’ ‘ Oh !
<NAME> <NAME> had made his unavailing expedition to <NAME> in the midst of a great pressure of business .
I won ’ t hear of it .
<NAME> care of your chest and voice , my good friend , and leave the law to take care of itself .
There were more than two full hours yet to elapse before she could come , and in that interval , which seemed a long one , I must confess I was nervously anxious about my altered looks .
‘ What is it , <NAME> ? ’ <NAME> was the questioner , and put an arm round the poor baby as he made a struggle .
‘ I should rob my family , ’ he said , ‘ if I was to offer ninepence for it. ’ This was a disagreeable way of putting the business ; because it imposed upon me , a perfect stranger , the unpleasantness of asking <NAME> to rob his family on my account .
‘ <NAME> me what you mean. ’ ‘ Why , they say , ’ replied the boy , looking up into her face , that you will be an <NAME> , before the birds sing again .
<NAME> <NAME> is my messenger and representative .
“ I can not find it , ” said he , “ and I must have it .
Under these circumstances I thought myself well rid of him for a shilling .
Oh , don ’ t cry. ’ ‘ I won ’ t cry any more , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Why , don ’ t you believe that you are kept here , as a cheap example , and a famous instance of the clemency of <NAME> and <NAME> , redounding to the credit of the illustrious <NAME> ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , ’ replied his brother , mildly , ‘ I have long believed that I am kept
All the time we were out , the two gentlemen smoked incessantly -- which , I thought , if I might judge from the smell of their rough coats , they must have been doing , ever since the coats had first come home from the tailor ’ s .
When the executive perceived that <NAME> and his friends were disposed to resist the authority of the law , they very significantly turned up their coat sleeves , as if knocking them down in the first instance , and taking them up afterwards , were a mere professional act which had only to be thought of to be done ,
My opinion is “ keep ‘ em at it ” . ’ ‘ My good madam , ’ returned Mr Dombey , ‘ you have not acquired your reputation undeservedly ; and I beg you to believe , <NAME> , that I am more than satisfied with your excellent system of management , and shall have the greatest pleasure in
They made a path through booths and carriages and throngs of people , and never once stopped to look behind .
If they could be brought to me loose , to sort , I should hardly have the face to claim ‘ em as mine .
Gently <NAME> , gently. ’ ‘ Strange sitivation for one o ’ the family , ’ observed <NAME> , hoisting the aunt into a chair .
So were his two companions .
They all open <NAME> ’ s work .
There 'll he nobody but Ma to thank for it . ''
Say what they are. ’ ‘ Mr .
And if I knew him , and I might , I would go down on my knees to him , and take his hand and kiss it and ask him not to draw it away , but to leave it -- O to leave it for a moment -- and let my thankful tears fall on it ; for I
‘ I am not aware of anything more , ’ replied <NAME> .
I speak for myself , let me add , without including you .
Doctors were sent for , and soon came .
I had a good mind to ask an old man , in wire spectacles , who was breaking stones upon the road , to lend me his hammer for a little while , and let me begin to beat a path to <NAME> out of granite .
‘ He has got his discharge , by G -- ! ’ said the man .
She looked at him now .
It ’ s very gratifying to think that we should have been the means of introducing her into such society , and I ’ m quite glad of it -- quite rejoiced -- for she certainly is an exceedingly well-behaved and good-natured little person .
By the merest accident , of course ! ’ In effect , the swain was standing up in his gondola , card-case in hand , affecting to put the question to a servant .
He resumed where he had left off .
In the morning she was just the same , <NAME> .
It was not to be .
Mr Twemlow returning to his sofa , lays down his aching head on its slippery little horsehair bolster , with a strong internal conviction that a painful interview is not the kind of thing to be taken after the dinner pills which are so highly salutary in connexion with the pleasures of the table .
I couldn ’ t learn a Latin Grammar when I was out , every day , with old Glubb .
They were always forgiving me , in their vanity and condescension .
Does he -- do they -- aunt ? ’ <NAME> shook her head compassionately .
Therefore -- eh , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , sir. ’ ‘ Therefore , I call upon you both , to -- I think that ’ s the course , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , Sir. ’ ‘ To -- to -- what , <NAME> ? ’ said the magistrate pettishly .
He is fondest of her and most loving to her , when there is no creature by .
But there have been times since , in my manhood , many times there have been , when I have thought , Is it possible , among the possibilities of hidden things , that in the sudden rashness of the child and her wild look so far off , there was any merciful attraction of her into danger , any
‘ Mississes , <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> , with an alarming frown .
She made no reply , but still pressed forward .
The spy preserved the same relative distance between them , and followed : with his eye upon her .
‘ If it had been anyone but you , <NAME> , ’ said I , turning away my head , ‘ I should not have minded it half so much .
<NAME> <NAME> passed , and <NAME> passed , and the sedan passed , and the bodyguard of specials passed , and <NAME> was still responding to the enthusiastic cheers of the mob , and waving his hat about as if he were in the very last extreme of the wildest joy ( though , of course , he had not
A sunburnt , quick , lithe , little man , though rather thickset .
<NAME> <NAME> ’ s admiration seemed to increase her perplexity .
Kindly explain ; or if not kindly , justly. ’ ‘ Oh , sir ! ’ said <NAME> , raising her eyes to his , after a little struggle to forbear , ‘ is it generous and honourable to use the power here which your favour with Mr and <NAME> and your ability in your place give you , against
`` Well , well , '' says <NAME> , `` you train him respectable , and he 'll be a comfort to you , and look after you in your old age , you know . ''
Are you quite sure , Mr Rokesmith , that you have never had a disappointment in love ? ’ ‘ Quite sure .
Oh , what shall I do , what shall I do !
<NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , shaking him by the arm ; and his whisper was so audible now , that <NAME> felt it unnecessary to repeat his words ; ‘ you have not forgotten yourself , I hope ? ’ ‘ No , sir , no , ’ returned the <NAME> , showing his face , and shaking his
They heard him mutter , “ One Hundred and <NAME> , <NAME> ; ” and when he looked about him , it evidently was for the strong fortress-walls which had long encompassed him .
I terrified them from the spot , and since that day have prowled by night -- the only period at which I can revisit the earth -- about the scenes of my long-protracted misery .
That is , in the long run .
And <NAME> , having his back to the door , would have known nothing of their apparition even then , but for seeing his Uncle spring out of his own chair , and nearly tumble over another .
It was a ragged head , the sandy hair of which , scrupulously parted on one side , and flattened down with pomatum , was twisted into little semi- circular tails round a flat face ornamented with a pair of small eyes , and garnished with a very dirty shirt collar , and a rusty black stock .
and yet it ’ s like being tickled -- there ’ s a pleasure in it too , sir ! ’ ‘ Drink that , ’ said the dwarf , who had by this time heated some more .
This lady had a basket with her , and she hadn ’ t known what to do with it , for a long time , until she found that on account of my legs being short , it could go underneath me .
‘ What an infernal hole this is ! ’ said <NAME> , breaking a long pause .
Now , the whole place was , or it should have been , quite as delightful a place as ever ; and yet it did not impress me in the same way .
‘ Perhaps you may not be aware , sir , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ that I intruded upon him when he was over here in <NAME> .
He was a trifle above the middle size , and apparently rather weak in the legs ; but this circumstance by no means detracted from his own admiration of his top-boots , which he contemplated , in their elevated situation , with lively satisfaction .
A hard family likeness was on all these things .
‘ They are so beautiful ! ’ said Mrs. <NAME> , sobbing .
<NAME> ( unless it be the power of intellect or virtue ) has ever the greatest attraction for the lowest natures ; and the mere defiance of the unconscious house-front , with his power to strip the roof off the inhabiting family like the roof of a house of cards , was a treat which had a charm for <NAME>
At least I know I should be , if you were better acquainted with my character. ’ ‘ Well , <NAME> , ’ was the rejoinder .
<NAME> under such circumstances being not to be thought of , <NAME> is attended by her maid , who , impressed from her own bed for that purpose , extremely cold , very sleepy , and generally an injured maid as condemned by circumstances to take office with a cousin , when she had resolved to be maid to nothing
He turned it over and over ; surveyed it with a contempt no language can express ; and inquired if I wished him to fix me a boot like _that_ ?
The dwarf ’ s humour , as we know , was to have a fireside to himself ; and when he was disposed to be convivial , to enjoy himself alone .
“ After not setting eyes upon you or hearing of you for so long a time , do I find you here ! ” “ Do n't call me <NAME> .
‘ Indeed , ’ said Mrs. Nickleby , ‘ I don ’ t think she ever was better , since she had the hooping-cough , scarlet-fever , and measles , all at the same time , and that ’ s the fact. ’ ‘ Is that letter for me ? ’ growled <NAME> , pointing to the little packet Mrs.
She resumed her seat , and had scarcely done so , when the doubtful page darted into the room and announced , <NAME> , and <NAME> , and <NAME> , and <NAME> , all at one burst .
'Now listen to me , ' said the dying woman aloud , as if making a great effort to revive one latent spark of energy .
I never can , believe me .
‘ He knows best , ’ meaning <NAME> , ‘ for he has always been at my elbow , whispering me .
On further consideration , I remember that he tried hot roast pig and bottled ale as a cure for sea-sickness ; and that he took these remedies ( usually in bed ) day after day , with astonishing perseverance .
I saw him stand uncovered in the bitter air , with a reverence for something .
‘ It is singular enough that I had intended to volunteer a full explanation this very day ; so , if you will give me another glass of wine , I will satisfy your curiosity. ’ The decanters passed from hand to hand with unwonted briskness , and <NAME> , looking round on the faces of his friends with a
At the <NAME> at <NAME> , they stopped to dine ; upon which occasion there was more bottled ale , with some more <NAME> , and some port besides ; and here the case-bottle was replenished for the fourth time .
‘ I must not make a martyr of myself , when I am one of so large a company. ’ ‘ Relinquish it , or begin it all over again ? ’ mused <NAME> .
`` I looked in here , '' he observes , `` just before you , with the intention of giving this deceased man , whom I never saw alive , some employment at his trade of copying .
It might be worthwhile , sometimes , to inquire what <NAME> is , and how men work to change her , and whether , in the enforced distortions so produced , it is not natural to be unnatural .
The feeling which beset the child was one of dim uncertain horror .
It had a black canal in it , and a river that ran purple with ill-smelling dye , and vast piles of building full of windows where there was a rattling and a trembling all day long , and where the piston of the steam-engine worked monotonously up and down , like the head of an elephant in a state

They allowed a very liberal table to <NAME> and Mrs. Pocket , yet it always appeared to me that by far the best part of the house to have boarded in would have been the kitchen , -- always supposing the boarder capable of self-defence , for , before I had been there a week , a neighboring lady with

And thus it came to pass , that <NAME> declared , in the parlour after supper , to wit , and twenty minutes before eleven o ’ clock p.m. , that he had never been so happy in all his days .

There was nothing very inviting in the object , but Mr <NAME> was wrapt in a brown study , and sat contemplating it with far greater attention than , in a more conscious mood , he would have deigned to bestow upon the rarest exotic .
I was tired of reading , and dead sleepy ; but having leave , as a high treat , to sit up until my mother came home from spending the evening at a neighbour ’ s , I would rather have died upon my post ( of course ) than have gone to bed .
‘ Ah ! ’ Mrs <NAME> curled the little finger of her left hand as who should say , ‘ I have caught you .
There was a bright moon , but it was behind the clouds .
A gentleman from <NAME> ’ ‘ Bring him up here ! ’ Mr <NAME> muttered , as if he deemed that unnecessary ; but , turning to Mr Dorrit , said , ‘ Mrs Clennam .
In her bower she was , but not alone , for besides the old lady her mother of whom mention has recently been made , there were present some half-dozen ladies of the neighborhood who had happened by a strange accident ( and also by a little understanding among themselves ) to drop in one after another , just about
The President ’ s mansion is more like an <NAME> club-house , both within and without , than any other kind of establishment with which I can compare it .
<NAME> Jobling is buttoned up closer than mere adornment might require .
And I will say , ’ added Mr <NAME> , ‘ to his ill-looking face , that in my opinion the world would be no worse for his slipping out of it altogether. ’ ‘ Your opinion is not asked , ’ answered <NAME> .
A great deal of laughter ensued , and Mrs. <NAME> volunteered to humour him , so she took a slight sip out of her glass .
<NAME> ( so self-named ) was the unfortunate child who had fallen downstairs , who now interrupted the correspondence by presenting himself , with a strip of plaster on his forehead , to exhibit his wounded knees , in which <NAME> and I did not know which to pity most -- the bruises or the dirt .
When a porter had put his luggage in the coach , and received his fare , he turned round and was gone ; and before my uncle had well begun to wonder what had become of him , half a dozen fresh ones started up , and staggered along under the weight of parcels , which seemed big enough to
They were immediately admitted into the lodge .
Mrs General consequently found her means so much diminished , that , but for the perfect regulation of her mind , she might have felt disposed to question the accuracy of that portion of the late service which had declared that the commissary could take nothing away with him .
But , it was only the pleasanter to turn to <NAME> and to <NAME> , whose great forbearance shone more brightly than before , if that could be , contrasted with this brazen pretender .
He took the same occasion of inviting them to a comprehensive entertainment , to be given to the whole College in the yard , and at which he signified he would have the honour of taking a parting glass to the health and happiness of all those whom he was about to leave behind .
`` We thought that , perhaps , '' said I , hesitating , `` it is right to begin with the obligations of home , sir ; and that , perhaps , while those are overlooked and neglected , no other duties can possibly be substituted for them . ''
<NAME> <NAME> , don ’ t you hear a knock ? ’ ‘ I ’ ll answer the door in one moment , <NAME> , ’ replied the clerk .
Besides you -- you ’ re disappointed , <NAME> , and , not knowing what you say , expose yourself. ’ ‘ Yes , you pitiful dastard , ’ retorted the lovely damsel , ‘ I understand you .
‘ Not a button , ’ said <NAME> .
Two peculiarly blunt knocks or pokes at the door , as if the dead man arriving on his back were striking at it with the soles of his motionless feet .
rejoined <NAME> ; 'that was done by <NAME> , that was . '
I am not a bad compiler , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , preserving the same air of cheerful confidence in all he said , ‘ but I have no invention at all ; not a particle .
Yes , verily , my lords and gentlemen and honourable boards , adapting your Catechism to the occasion , and by <NAME> ’ s help so you must .
‘ Of <NAME> and <NAME> , in the wine trade , ’ he replied .
Better far than all the <NAME> put together know him. ’ Mrs. Tope ’ s care has spread a very neat , clean breakfast ready for her lodger .
This resistance only infuriated <NAME> the more ; who , dropping on his knees , began to assail the animal most furiously .
<NAME> <NAME> ‘ dresses at ’ the <NAME> ; has been bowed to for the <NAME> , in mistake ; has even been spoken to in the street as <NAME> , under the impression that he was the <NAME> come down unexpectedly , without his chaplain .
He rightly judged that , at first at all events , they would go in a contrary direction from their late companion .
Especially as you have no call to be told how to value yourself , my dear. ’ Colouring a little under this compliment , <NAME> returned , ‘ I hope sir , you don ’ t think me vain ? ’ ‘ Not a bit , my dear , ’ said Mr Boffin .
And however far off that may be , I will never tire of trying .
‘ Very , very , <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> , without moving a muscle of his face .
My brother <NAME> , ’ said the old man admiringly , ‘ is fit company for monarchs ; but not so your uncle , my dear .
One of these papers was a letter to this girl <NAME> ; the other a will . '
Yet he said it with so much meaning , too , that I felt he as perfectly understood <NAME> to be my benefactress , as I understood the fact myself .
But by this time , his doubts were all removed .
“ <NAME> is the best policy , ” is it ?
She and her husband had worked too , and had brought their simple faith and honour clean out of dustheaps .
The lady says what ’ s right .
<NAME> Leicester is not aware that any client of <NAME> has been in need of his assistance .
A Shoal of <NAME> 35 .
I have ever since connected the feeling with that spot and time and with everything associated with that spot and time , to the distant voices in the town , the barking of a dog , and the sound of wheels coming down the miry hill .
On one occasion , when an execution had just been put in , coming home through some chance as early as six o ’ clock , I saw her lying ( of course with a twin ) under the grate in a swoon , with her hair all torn about her face ; but I never knew her more cheerful
I am far from sure that I believed there was anything hopeful in it , but my mind was thoroughly made up that it must be carried into execution .
Now , considered as an abstract circumstance , there was no more obvious cause or reason why <NAME> should take the trouble of muffling this particular knocker , than there would have been for his muffling the knocker of any nobleman or gentleman resident ten miles off ; because , for the greater convenience of the numerous lodgers , the
She felt unwilling , almost unable , to go on to her own chamber ; and turning into the drawing-rooms , where the clouded moon was shining through the blinds , looked out into the empty streets .
‘ You , injured by his haughty temper !
How are you gettin ’ on , and how is the chandlery bis ’ ness likely to do ?
I have been no lover of this lady ’ s .
<NAME> stands amazed in the disk of light , like a ragged figure in a magic-lantern , trembling to think that he has offended against the law in not having moved on far enough .
'Not a penny , ' replied the girl , waving her hand .
The very wedding looked dismal as they passed in front of the altar .
When he turned round again with a composed countenance , his subordinate still stood in the same place , and the dolls ’ dressmaker sat behind the door with a look of horror .
Then came the night -- dark , dismal , silent night .
A day passed away and his mother was not there ; another flew by , and she came not near him ; a third evening arrived , and yet he had not seen her -- , and in four-and-twenty hours he was to be separated from her , perhaps for ever .
It was for me to smile .
‘ <NAME> , aye , ’ said the little man ; ‘ that ’ s a matter of opinion , you know , and we won ’ t dispute about terms ; because of course you can ’ t be expected to view these subjects with a professional eye .
<NAME> asserted the family gentility , and his own , by coming out in the character of the aristocratic brother , and loftily swaggering in the little skittle ground respecting seizures by the scruff of the neck , which there were looming probabilities of some gentleman unknown executing on some little puppy not mentioned .
The man who was seated there , was tall and dark , and wore a large cloak .
“ Yes , ma'am ; I could do that , if I was wanted. ” “ Since this house strikes you old and grave , boy , ” said <NAME> , impatiently , “ and you are unwilling to play , are you willing to work ? ” I could answer this inquiry with a better heart than I had
Still I cried very much , not only in the fullness of my heart after reading the letter , not only in the strangeness of the prospect -- for it was strange though I had expected the contents -- but as if something for which there was no name or distinct idea were indefinitely lost to me .
But we always calls him <NAME> just the same .
She stopped , and reddened again .
<NAME> , I have an inexpressible desire to find service with a young lady who is good , accomplished , beautiful .
This was merely intended as a tribute to the animal 's abilities , but it was an appropriate remark in another sense , if <NAME> had only known it ; for there are a good many ladies and gentlemen , claiming to be out-and-out Christians , between whom , and <NAME> ' dog , there exist strong and singular points
There is nobody down here ; and one or two dull lamps upon the steamer ’ s decks are the only signs of life remaining , when our coach has driven away .
And he was -- honourable and manful -- for two year going on , and we was just the same at home here as afore. ’ <NAME> ’ s face , which had varied in its expression with the various stages of his narrative , now resumed all its former triumphant delight , as he laid a hand upon my
With many adieus and good wishes , <NAME> went his way .
She rose too , and he took leave with all humility .
As <NAME> said this , with the becoming indignation of an ill-used man ; and as <NAME> felt that it rather tended to convey a reflection on the honour of the parish ; the latter gentleman thought it advisable to change the subject .
I wanted to be cutting at those trees in the forest of difficulty , under circumstances that should prove my strength .
“ Take that message back , and they will know that I received this , as well as if I wrote .
‘ Pretty well ! ’ echoed <NAME> .
Try easy now. ’ He tried easy now ; but the luck resisted ; wouldn ’ t come .
‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , laughing boisterously , ‘ they dean ’ t put too much intiv ’ em .
But we preserved an unbroken silence .
It was after much consideration of this fact , and much pondering over such an unfortunate combination of circumstances , that a bright idea occurred to the <NAME> .
‘ Assuredly. ’ ‘ Why , I have not mentioned , <NAME> , ’ said I , a little embarrassed , ‘ that <NAME> is rather difficult to -- I would not , for the world , say , to rely upon , because she is the soul of purity and truth -- but rather difficult to -- I hardly
My child is always dangerous , more or less .
' ” “ It 's pity , ” said I , scornfully , as I finished my interrupted breakfast , “ that the man did not say what he had done and would do again. ” “ Squires of the <NAME> ! ” <NAME> was now addressing the landlord , “ and <NAME> !
I had never laughed and cried in all my life , I dare say -- not even to her -- more freely than I did that morning .
For not one moment after I have ceased to speak , will I stay here ! ’ He turned upon her with his ugliest look , and gripped the table with his hand ; but neither rose , nor otherwise answered or threatened her .
You are to be a proctor .
But she joined in the forfeits , and loved her love to admiration with all the letters of the alphabet .
The quantity of walking exercise I took , was not in this respect attended with its usual consequence , as the disappointment counteracted the fresh air .
Mr Morfin , as an officer of inferior state , inhabited the room that was nearest to the clerks .
The anxiety of his mind , and the numerous meditations which <NAME> had awakened , prevented his share of the mortar of punch producing that effect upon him which it would have had under other circumstances .
`` Why this , '' returns <NAME> , not able to be very conciliatory at first , `` is <NAME> , who has obliged me in that matter of ours , you know . ''
He might as well have been born with a yard and a half of it , and a remnant over . ''
`` <NAME> will give us a good deal of trouble -- '' `` It is the character of such a mind , <NAME> , '' <NAME> interrupts him , `` TO give trouble .
' I know he is , ' rejoined <NAME> .
It may prevent some persons laying under suspicion alonger me. ” “ You can say what you like , ” returned the sergeant , standing coolly looking at him with his arms folded , “ but you have no call to say it here .
he said , rising and pushing back his chair .
‘ If you was to take and show that man the buoy at the <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> in the same tone , ‘ and ask him his opinion of it , <NAME> ’ r , he ’ d give you an opinion that was no more like that buoy than your Uncle ’ s buttons are .
<NAME> had stopped , not for the first time by many times , to look about him and suffer what he saw to sink into his soul , as the shadows , looked at , seemed to sink deeper and deeper into the water .
We went down on the next day but one , and we found her in the room where I had first beheld her , and it is needless to add that there was no change in <NAME> .
‘ And thank this gentleman , ’ interposed the old man , ‘ but for whose care I might have lost my little girl to-night. ’ ‘ No , no , master , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ that won ’ t do , that won ’ t. ’ ‘ What do you mean ? ’ cried the old man
These crawling things had fascinated my attention , and I was watching them from a distance , when <NAME> laid a hand upon my shoulder .
‘ I don ’ t know , ’ replied <NAME> , in the same tone .
She does not even know my name. ’ ‘ I ’ ll ask it for all that .
Women work hard in these parts .
Why , if I was to say to them , “ I ’ m told your friend <NAME> is a base wretch , ” they ’ d laugh at me. ’ ‘ They will laugh no more at us , I take it , ’ said <NAME> , advancing .
`` Never you mind for me , miss .
I can act with philosophy in such a case as that .
Our new shoes had come home , but we hadn ’ t put ‘ em on .
I have a good deal to say to you. ’ ‘ What papers are those ? ’ inquired <NAME> , as the little man deposited on the table a small bundle of documents tied with red tape .
These have been his relations towards me .
<NAME> for your nurture of him , moan for your corruption of him , moan for your loss of him , moan for mine ! ’ She clenched her hand , and trembled through her spare , worn figure , as if her passion were killing her by inches .
<NAME> on in the night , <NAME> opened his eyes .
Begging your pardon , <NAME> , ’ said Mr Perch , hesitating at the door , ‘ he ’ s rough , <NAME> , in appearance. ’ ‘ Never mind .
It has not yet come to my sister ’ s knowledge that we have found it out , but we have .
How do you choose them ? ” “ I choose them as real men , of my name -- <NAME> is my name -- to whom the sight is likely to do good .
But this put me into such a tremble lest they should detain me there that she soon recalled her words and compromised for a rest of half an hour .
‘ Of course you like dancing ? ’ ‘ Oh no , I don ’ t , ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> was many miles too near , and we reached it many hours too soon ; but <NAME> came to himself a little short of it , and said , ‘ You must come in , <NAME> , and rest ! ’ and I consenting , we had sandwiches and wine-and-water .
Is there no devil to help me ? ’ Swiftly , there glided again into his brain the figure he had raised that night .
But no temperature made the melancholy mad elephants more mad or more sane .
‘ Oh , you disgraceful old chap ! ’ The very breathing of the figure was contemptible , as it laboured and rattled in that operation , like a blundering clock .
And I know brickmakers go about working at piecework in different places .
The service over , and the clergyman withdrawn , Mr Dombey looks round , demanding in a low voice , whether the person who has been requested to attend to receive instructions for the tablet , is there ?
His manner is the gravely impressive manner of a man who has not committed himself in life otherwise than as he has become the victim of a tender sorrow of the heart .
So much the more weight shall I attach to the pledge I require from you , when it is unreservedly given. ’ The young man twice or thrice essayed to speak , but failed .
`` So am I , they tell me . ''
When you come in , sir , I was just putting it to my fellow-partner , ’ towards whom he turned , ‘ to say to <NAME> upon his word and honour , whether he ’ d ever been of this opinion long ago , or not .
Mrs. <NAME> was so much affected on this particular occasion , that , assisting <NAME> to his hat after breakfast , and being then alone with him in the hall , she imprinted a chaste kiss upon his hand , murmured ‘ My benefactor ! ’ and retired , overwhelmed with grief .
What does it matter whether such a blighted life as mine comes to an end , now , next week , or next year ?
The victim cried , but in a subdued manner as if she feared to raise her voice , and <NAME> , comforting herself with a pinch of snuff , ascended the stairs , just as <NAME> had safely reached the office .
<NAME> looked at me a little frightened .
There was a red brick house with a small paved courtyard in front , which anybody might have known belonged to the attorney ; and there was , moreover , another red brick house with <NAME> blinds , and a large brass door-plate with a very legible announcement that it belonged to the surgeon .
Two or three mighty stacks of chimneys , and a few large dark rooms which had escaped being walled and subdivided out of the recognition of their old proportions , gave the Yard a character .
Shall I tell you more ?
It ’ s my business to see it .
If that house has failed , and he the first to bring the news ! -- Is the coach there ? ’ ‘ Yes , yes , ’ said <NAME> , startled by the fierce tone of the inquiry .
So many hundred Hands in this <NAME> ; so many hundred horse <NAME> .
‘ The duty done , and act of reparation performed , which can alone enable me to contemplate my fellow mortal , I shall be known no more .
It was the journey ’ s fitting end , and might have been the end of everything ; it was so ruinous and dreary .
‘ Do you mean to tell me , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , folding his arms emphatically , and turning half-round to the jury , as if in mute assurance that he would bother the witness yet -- ‘ do you mean to tell me , <NAME> , that you saw nothing of this fainting on the part of
They look very , very like that sort of thing .
‘ <NAME> know , ’ said <NAME> .
It remained thus , until the first warning bell began to ring .
I work hard , and read Law insatiably .
`` The house is yonder , '' <NAME> exclaimed .
When it was not too wet or inclement for her child to be with her , they went together ; at other times she was alone ; but , she never missed a single day .
There was a faint light in a chamber window not far off , and <NAME> ran towards that house to ask their way .
<NAME> , when he was sufficiently cool , proceeded with his letter .
‘ Stop a minute , ’ said <NAME> ; ‘ I wos a-going to say , he always brings now , a flat bottle as holds about a pint and a half , and fills it vith the pine-apple rum afore he goes avay. ’ ‘ And empties it afore he comes back , I s ’ pose ? ’
Certainly not. ’ This dumb-show , taking place during the whole time of the invalid ’ s breakfast , and the invalid himself , pale and emaciated , performing no small part in the same , it may be fairly questioned whether at any meal , where no word , good or bad , was spoken from beginning to end
You see me at my greatest disadvantage .
Almost in an instant afterwards , as I leaned back in my seat , he looked in , with his lighted lantern in his hand , an excited and quite different man .
‘ What ’ s the matter ? ’ said the short dark man .
Returning to the <NAME> with which burden , he was descried coming round into the court , by the wary young Blight watching from the window : who instantly closed the outer door , and left the miserable object to expend his fury on the panels .
“ <NAME> 's your mother ? ” “ There , sir ! ” said I .
In about a quarter of an hour Mr Chuckster ( with a pen behind his ear and his face inflamed with wine ) appeared at the door , and condescending to address Kit by the jocose appellation of ‘ Young Snob , ’ informed him that the visitors were coming out .
But , the lesser grindstone stood alone there in the calm morning air , with a red upon it that the sun had never given , and would never take away .
‘ I hope they are , ’ said <NAME> , fixing his eyes upon his friend .
<NAME> among the undertakers and the equipages and the calves of so many legs all steeped in grief , <NAME> sits concealed in one of the inconsolable carriages and at his ease surveys the crowd through the lattice blinds .
There was one piece of gold among it , and an emergency might come when its worth to them would be increased a hundred fold .
The solicitors ’ wives , and the wine-merchant ’ s wife , headed another grade ( the brewer ’ s wife visited the <NAME> ) ; and Mrs. <NAME> , the post- office keeper , seemed by mutual consent to have been chosen the leader of the trade party .
Now , I 'll tell you what I have got for supper , <NAME> .
While these observations were being exchanged between <NAME> and <NAME> ; and while the boy in the gray livery , marvelling at the unwonted prolongation of the dinner , cast an anxious look , from time to time , towards the glass door , distracted by inward misgivings regarding the amount of minced veal which would be ultimately reserved for
Here <NAME> bowed grimly to <NAME> , while <NAME> and <NAME> glanced mutual distrust out of the corners of their eyes .
Come. ’ Down they sat to breakfast , but it was evident , notwithstanding the boasting of <NAME> , that he laboured under a very considerable degree of nervousness , of which loss of appetite , a propensity to upset the tea-things , a spectral attempt at drollery , and an irresistible inclination to look at the clock , every
In the exercise of his skill , the appearance and the story of the <NAME> removed him from all other men .
He rather congratulated himself on his prudence when the single gentleman , without notice or explanation of any kind , double-locked the door .
Of course you gentlemen hardly failed to observe that he was towing by the neck and arms. ’ They had helped to release the rope , and of course not .
At <NAME> ’ s time of life it was not to be expected that she should examine herself very closely on the congruity or stability of her position in Mr <NAME> ’ s house .
It appeared on the whole , to <NAME> herself , that this same society in which they lived , greatly resembled a superior sort of <NAME> .
If <NAME> comes home on account of ill health , he must not be allowed to go back , and we must endeavour to make some more suitable and fortunate provision for him in this country. ’ Mrs. <NAME> was so overcome by this generous speech -- which , I need not say , she had not at all expected
‘ Of course I am , ’ replied <NAME> haughtily .
It was rather expensive at first , in consequence of the increase in the undertaker 's bill , and the necessity of taking in the clothes of all the paupers , which fluttered loosely on their wasted , shrunken forms , after a week or two 's gruel .
The fellow , by his agent , or secretary , or somebody , writes to me 'Sir <NAME> , <NAME> , presents his compliments to <NAME> , and has to call his attention to the fact that the green pathway by the old parsonage-house , now the property of <NAME> , is <NAME> 's right of way , being in
Perhaps you ’ ll kindly let me have it , and I ’ ll trot off to my work. ’ ‘ I let you have it ? ’ said <NAME> , turning his head towards her ; for he had been sitting blinking at the light , and feeling his cheek .
‘ And not a wery sure one , neither , ’ added <NAME> ; ‘ I got reg ’ larly done the other day. ’ ‘ No ! ’ said his father .
We reached the city , late that night .
Be seated , <NAME> , I beg , <NAME> .
Do you imagine that I bestow a thought on it , or suppose you could do any harm to that low place , which money would not pay for , and handsomely ?
Mr Dombey , Sir. ’ <NAME> bowed .
And what ’ s going to be undertook for that unfortunate young woman , <NAME> , now ? ’ ‘ You touch a point that my thoughts have been dwelling on since yesterday , ’ said I , ‘ but on which I can give you no information yet , <NAME> .
‘ I congratulate you , <NAME> , ’ said Mr <NAME> , who had meditated this neat address while coming along , ‘ on the day. ’ Mrs <NAME> thanked him with a magnanimous sigh , and again became an unresisting prey to that inscrutable toothache .
Then is she kind and cruel , stately and unassuming , various , beautifully wilful .
Let ’ s have a good ‘ un ! ’ ‘ Hurrah ! ’ ‘ Noo then , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ let ’ s have yan more to end wi ’ , and then coot off as quick as you loike .
O yeth , to be thure !
When <NAME> was summoned to the couch , <NAME> , attentive to all that happened , slipped behind that wicked shadow—a sight in the horror of his face , if there had been eyes there for any sight but one—and whispered in his ear .
The child who had been her little friend came there , almost as soon as it was day , with an offering of dried flowers which he begged them to lay upon her breast .
Did the honourable <NAME> allude to him ?
said <NAME> , pausing near the door .
She said no more at the time ; but she presently stopped and looked at me again ; and presently again ; and after that , looked frowning and moody .
It was evident that the three daughters had grown up as they could and had had just as little haphazard instruction as qualified them to be their father 's playthings in his idlest hours .
It is the fate of a lonely old man , that those about him should form new and different attachments and leave him .
In my child ’ s name , if not in my own , I make the admission in the fullest manner , at the same time reserving -- ha -- shall I say my personal dignity ?
But soon the steeples called good people all , to church and chapel , and away they came , flocking through the streets in their best clothes , and with their gayest faces .
`` What 's the matter with the cat ? ''
And I mean to be paid high , Mr Venus , I promise you. ’ ‘ You speak quite revengefully , Mr Wegg. ’ ‘ Revengefully , sir ?
said a little ugly hump-backed man : opening the door so suddenly , that the doctor , from the very impetus of his last kick , nearly fell forward into the passage .
She was alarmed by an occurrence in the house which might have alarmed a stronger person , and was made ill by the distress and agitation .
That ’ s what your daughter wants .
‘ Do you pretend to believe , ’ Mrs Lammle resumes , sternly , ‘ when you talk of my marrying you for worldly advantages , that it was within the bounds of reasonable probability that I would have married you for yourself ? ’ ‘ Again there are two sides to the question , <NAME> .
‘ I ain ’ t a man of many words , but I take it very kind of you to be so friendly , and above-board .
Be good -- deserve it -- and abide by <NAME> 's instructions. ” She looked at me , and looked at <NAME> , and <NAME> 's countenance wrung out of her watchful face a cruel smile .
`` Besides , it 's not as if I was an accomplished girl who had any right to give herself airs , '' said <NAME> .
It was but momentary , of course , and a mere fancy , but I felt it keenly for all that .
A waiter showed me into the coffee-room ; and a chambermaid introduced me to my small bedchamber , which smelt like a hackney-coach , and was shut up like a family vault .
He is calling again ! ’ ‘ It may be the last time we shall ever meet on earth , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ it may be better for me that we should never meet more. ’ ‘ For both , for both , ’ replied <NAME> , not heeding what she said .
If it don ’ t act well , or don ’ t quite accord with our mutual convenience , he can easily go to the right-about .
The word <NAME> , besides , gives a pretty form to the lips .
He passed his handkerchief across his forehead , took off his spectacles , wiped them , and put them on again ; and his voice had recovered its wonted softness of tone when he said -- ‘ What have you there , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Called at the post-office just now , and found this here letter , as
Placing a strong emphasis on the last word , he suffered his features gradually to resolve themselves into a ghastly grin , and , nodding his head , left the room .
WE all dined together that day ; and a rather formidable party we were : no fewer than eighty-six strong .
I am staying at the house of papa ’ s agent , <NAME> , in <NAME> , <NAME> .
‘ Better there than here , ’ said a third voice aloud -- <NAME> ’ s , though she did not move .
‘ <NAME> ’ t be afeard , mun , ’ he said ; ‘ tak ’ eneaf to carry thee whoam .
Let me go my way , all of ye .
A blunderbuss and two swords hung above the chimney-piece , for the terror of evil-doers , but the blunderbuss was rusty and shattered , and the swords were broken and edgeless .
`` You will lose the disinterested part of your Don Quixote character , '' said <NAME> to <NAME> over her shoulder again , `` if you only redress the wrongs of beauty like this .
Never , since I have been here ! ''
What could I do , but kiss away her tears , and tell her how I doted on her , after that !
'This young lady , ' the gentleman began , 'has communicated to me , and to some other friends who can be safely trusted , what you told her nearly a fortnight since .
I name one week from this day , for a last final visit on my part ; when you will unconditionally accept it or reject it , with its train of consequences .
‘ I fully understands my instructions , do I , <NAME> ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
When it is better for the happiness of all parties that no visiting should take place , ( as in the case of our brother <NAME> , and his establishment ) that is quite different. ’ I intimated that my aunt would be proud and delighted to make their acquaintance ; though I must say I was not quite sure
‘ Fine night , sir. ’ ‘ Very much so indeed , ’ replied <NAME> , as the waiter placed a small decanter of brandy , and some hot water before him .
<NAME> and patience , hope and patience ! ’ These words were uttered in too low a tone to reach the ears of the young men .
I look from <NAME> , in his Sunday neckcloth , to the pulpit ; and think what a good place it would be to play in , and what a castle it would make , with another boy coming up the stairs to attack it , and having the velvet cushion with the tassels thrown down on his head .
We all got up then ; and my mother said hurriedly that , as it was so late , and <NAME> and <NAME> approved of early hours for young people , perhaps I had better go to bed .
We must break it to get it through into the cage .
It was ratified only the other day .
I went out of my senses immediately ; became a mere driveller next day , on receipt of a little lace-edged sheet of note-paper , ‘ Favoured by papa .
'Yer know , Work'us , ' continued <NAME> , emboldened by <NAME> 's silence , and speaking in a jeering tone of affected pity : of all tones the most annoying : 'Yer know , Work'us , it ca n't be helped now ; and of course yer could n't help it then ; and I am very sorry for
If we had been waited on by any boat , I should have run in to shore , and have obliged her to go on , or to make her purpose evident .
‘ <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> , ‘ horrible. ’ A low tap was heard at the room door .
‘ Yes , <NAME> , ’ she said , when that young lady had concluded .
Her bosom was heaving in a distressful manner that I greatly pitied , but I thought it better not to speak .
Mr Lightwood , here has been a wicked cruel murder .
‘ Well , good-bye , then , ’ said the old gentleman .
Every eye then turned to the five judges and the public prosecutor .
‘ Welcome misery , welcome houselessness , welcome hunger , rags , tempest , and beggary !
`` Well , well , my dear , '' said <NAME> , `` we wo n't go into that now .
But permit me to set you right on one point .
Shall I make any more apologies , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Not one , ’ replied that gentleman .
‘ <NAME> much so , for our peace , perhaps , my dear , ’ returned her mother ; ‘ but we won ’ t complain .
I am always afraid of inconveniencing busy men , being an idle man. ’ ‘ I should not have thought so , from your appearance. ’ ‘ No ?
He would go on with a musing repetition of the title of his old firm twenty thousand times , and at every one of them , would turn his head upon his pillow .
It was due to the uniform he wore , to demand this explanation .
While he thus walked up and down with his eyes on the ground , <NAME> , in the chair from which she had risen to receive him , sat listening anew .
But I say this , fearing you may want money to save your own blood from exposure and disgrace -- make as much as you can ! ’ <NAME> shook his head , but looked at him thoughtfully too .
'We are all weak creeturs , ' said <NAME> .
A miniature painter lived there , for there was a large gilt frame screwed upon the street-door , in which were displayed , upon a black velvet ground , two portraits of naval dress coats with faces looking out of them , and telescopes attached ; one of a young gentleman in a very vermilion uniform , flourishing a sabre
`` I am sorry to say I am . ''
‘ Is that all ? ’ ‘ Theer ’ s yet a something else , ’ he returned , ‘ if I can say it , <NAME> ’ r Davy. ’ We walked on , farther than we had walked yet , before he spoke again .
There was another long pause .
On the shelving bank of the river , among the slimy stones of a causeway -- not the special causeway of the <NAME> , which had a landing-place of its own , but another , a little removed , and very near to the old windmill which was the denounced man ’ s dwelling-place -- were a few boats ;
He could not have said how many , or when ; but he saw in the faces of his pupils that they had seen him in that state , and that they were possessed by a dread of his relapsing .
I think that will cure her , my boy .
There are no ends of ways of leaving here .
Except when a constrained and singular reserve crept over her ; and then she seemed ( but <NAME> hardly understood this , though she could not choose but notice it , and think about it ) as if she were humbled before <NAME> , and ill at ease .
More unfortunately still , she had relations .
But these flights of fancy seldom burnished the brass plate of <NAME> and <NAME> ’ s Offices into a tablet of golden hope , or shed a brilliant lustre on their dirty skylights ; and when the <NAME> and <NAME> talked about <NAME> and masters ’ daughters , <NAME> felt that he understood his true position at <NAME> and <NAME>
In regard of the other <NAME> , the nondescript lodged in the same house with herself and uncle .
I a ’ most think you ’ re like the wulturs , pardner , and scent ‘ em out. ’ He spoke in a dropped voice , and with more than one glance at <NAME> who had pulled on her hood again .
is there no chord in your heart that I can touch !
Above all the noise we made , I heard them running up the stairs , and crying out -- I heard my mother crying out -- and <NAME> .
‘ How can you be so thankless to your best friend , <NAME> ?
‘ Then why DO you wait ? ’ said <NAME> .
More than once or twice , more than twice or thrice , say half a dozen times , he took his stick from the arm on which he nursed it , and hit a straight sharp rap at the air with its head .
He came near me no more ; but devoted himself to an old gentleman in long gaiters , to meet whom a pint of special port seemed to come out of the cellar of its own accord , for he gave no order .
Call him Trotwood , certainly , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> ’ was evidently the idol of her life ; never to be shaken on his pedestal by any commotion ; always to be believed in , and done homage to with the whole faith of her heart , come what might .
There he found Mr Rugg .
‘ If you please , sir , would you have the goodness to walk in , and speak to <NAME> ? ’ ‘ <NAME> sent you for me ? ’ I inquired .
Not only was I soon as well known on the <NAME> as the postmen on that beat , but I pervaded <NAME> likewise .
I pointed out to my darling how this could scarcely be , because <NAME> had come to her cousin <NAME> 's house and had known us all there , and because he had always liked <NAME> , and <NAME> had always liked him , and -- and so forth .
Look at him ! ’ ‘ Well , I _am_ looking at him , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ If there is a gentleman in this party , ’ said <NAME> , looking round and scarcely able to make his white lips form the words , ‘ he will acquaint me with the name and residence of this man. ’ There was a dead silence .
It was very hard , but I turned back , though with a heavy heart , and began laboriously and methodically to plod over the same tedious ground at a snail ’ s pace ; stopping to examine minutely every speck in the way , on all sides , and making the most desperate efforts to know these elusive characters
said <NAME> , chafed into perfect defiance of his venerable friend by the current of his regrets ; `` cause it ca n't come out in the 'dictment ; 'cause nobody will never know half of what he was .
<NAME> is prettier , thought the good Minor Canon frequently , when taking his seat at table opposite his long-widowed mother .
As they stole farther and farther in by slight and scarcely perceptible degrees , and with such caution that they scarcely seemed to breathe , the old hag and <NAME> little dreaming of any such invasion , and utterly unconscious of there being any soul near but themselves , were busily occupied with their tasks .
said the doctor , laying <NAME> gently down again .
<NAME> , my dear friend , pardon ! ’ <NAME> could scarcely believe the evidence of his senses , and perhaps would not have done so , but for the corroborative testimony afforded by the smiling countenance of <NAME> , and the bodily presence , in the background , of <NAME> and the pretty housemaid ; who appeared to contemplate
I wish I could doubt the evidence of my senses , but their depositions are unimpeachable .
Appealing to <NAME> , would be rather a rum course .
Look sharp with the light , or I shall knock my brains out against something in this confounded hole . '
Do I ? ’ ‘ Yes , ’ she answered with a smile .
I merely wish that we should -- ha -- understand each other .
‘ Because you understand , ’ resumed the <NAME> , coming back again to enforce this charge upon his mind , ‘ there may be , for anything I can say , a chase ; and I might be took while I was waiting , if you didn ’ t show yourself smart with the door. ’ Rob again assured
He had been crouching for a spring at the moment when his master caught him .
‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , suddenly appearing before him , ‘ where ’ s my bedroom ? ’ <NAME> stared at his master with the most emphatic surprise ; and it was not until the question had been repeated three several times , that he turned round , and led the way to the long-sought apartment .
Would you wish the gentleman to be shown in , ma ’ am ? ’ ‘ I don ’ t know who it can be , ’ said Mrs. Sparsit , wiping her mouth and arranging her mittens .
And if ever in my life I saw a love that nothing but death could change , I saw it then before me .
‘ It would have been much more satisfactory to those who wish to think well of their fellow creatures , and much more becoming in you , if you had shown some proper feeling , in time , for the little child that is now going to be prematurely deprived of its natural nourishment .
But <NAME> could not say where <NAME> was gone , except that it was in <NAME> , and no one could say , she remembered , unless it were Mr Toots .
There might have been much more envy in politer places .
If I were to plead anything in mitigation of the preposterous fancy that a bad design will sometimes claim to be a good and an expressly religious design , it would be the curious coincidence that it has been brought to its climax in these pages , in the days of the public examination of late Directors of a <NAME>
Accordingly , with a clean white apron tied over her gown , and her curl-papers tucked up under a straw bonnet , -- both articles of dress being provided from the <NAME> 's inexhaustible stock , -- <NAME> prepared to issue forth on her errand .
For it seemed that <NAME> had a dreadful Uncle , who not only volunteered examinations of him , in the holidays , on abstruse points , but twisted innocent events and things , and wrenched them to the same fell purpose .
Again , only this morning at breakfast .
It had begun to grow dark , and I had shut the window ( I had been lying , for the most part , with my head upon the sill , by turns crying , dozing , and looking listlessly out ) , when the key was turned , and <NAME> came in with some bread and meat , and
This old man wears a hat , a thumbed and napless and yet an obdurate hat , which has never adapted itself to the shape of his poor head .
`` There can be no more favourable time than the present , <NAME> , '' says <NAME> after they have broodingly made out the four sides of the square , `` for a word or two between us upon a point on which we must , with very little delay , come to an understanding . ''
On purpose to annoy me , for he knows how I doat upon them ! ’ A grisly little fiction concerning her lovers is <NAME> ’ s point .
Everybody wakes at the same time .
As , ‘ Supposing I was to be favoured with an order from Mr Boffin , my dear friend , it would be worth my while ’ -- to do a certain thing that I hope might not prove wholly disagreeable to your feelings .
As he mounted , the call or song began to sound in his ears again , and , looking above , he saw the face of the little creature looking down out of a Glory of her long bright radiant hair , and musically repeating to him , like a vision : ‘ Come up and be dead !
A rickety table , with spare bundles of papers , yellow and ragged from long carriage in the pocket , ostentatiously displayed upon its top ; a couple of stools set face to face on opposite sides of this crazy piece of furniture ; a treacherous old chair by the fire-place , whose withered arms had hugged full many a
‘ Excuse me , ’ said the gentleman hastily .
But he could as easily have changed a clear sky by looking at it in surprise , as affect her .
<NAME> <NAME> ! ” ‘ The goblin grinned a broader grin than before , as he said , “ Well , <NAME> , what do you say to this ? ” ‘ The sexton gasped for breath .
I call Mr Nickleby to witness the course I intend to pursue with you. ’ ‘ Pray don ’ t call me to witness anything , ma ’ am , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ A lady ! ’ says <NAME> , pluming his ruffled feathers .
<NAME> was the substance of <NAME> ’ s discoveries concerning him , made that rainy Sunday afternoon and afterwards .
“ Oh ! ” she replied , glancing over her shoulder as he slouched after us , “ because I -- I am afraid he likes me. ” “ Did he ever tell you he liked you ? ” I asked indignantly .
On my imparting this discovery in confidence to <NAME> , she informed me that her brother dealt in lobsters , crabs , and crawfish ; and I afterwards found that a heap of these creatures , in a state of wonderful conglomeration with one another , and never leaving off pinching whatever they laid hold of , were usually to
' I never thought you had told us anything but the truth , ' said <NAME> , soothing him .
By degrees he fell to reposing such great confidence in me , as to ask my advice in reference to his own affairs .
The client , with his dejection insensibly relieved and his vague hopes rekindled , takes pen and ink and writes the draft , not without perplexed consideration and calculation of the date it may bear , implying scant effects in the agent 's hands .
<NAME> , wines , all the accessories we wanted , and all of the best , were given out by our host from his dumb-waiter ; and when they had made the circuit of the table , he always put them back again .
In good time Mr <NAME> ’ s mansion was gained again , and again there was a noise of tongues in the library .
“ What are you going to do to me ? ” “ I 'm a going , ” said he , bringing his fist down upon the table with a heavy blow , and rising as the blow fell to give it greater force , -- “ I 'm a going to have your life ! ” He leaned forward
Every question told. ” “ I always am sound ; am I not ? ” “ I do n't gainsay it .
`` He is not in the way to do so now , my dear , '' replied my guardian .
Over all the legal neighbourhood there hangs , like some great veil of rust or gigantic cobweb , the idleness and pensiveness of the long vacation .
'He hung about , not to come over here afore dark , but he 'll be here soon , ' replied <NAME> .
There , snuff and cigars , and <NAME> pipes and flutes , and violins and violoncellos , divide the supremacy between them .
I do n't know why anything should be otherwise than safe and well here , thank God ; but I have been so put out all day , and I am not as young as I was !
There was a great stage , too , looking very clean and smooth after the streets ; and there were people upon it , talking about something or other , but not at all intelligibly .
The bewildered butler gazed from them towards <NAME> , and from <NAME> towards <NAME> , with a most ludicrous mixture of fear and perplexity .
‘ I don ’ t wish to be complimented upon it , I thank you ; but I think I have an idea , ’ <NAME> announced , after taking a jog-trot or two across the room , so unexpected and unaccountable that they all stared at him , doubtful whether he was choking or had the cramp— ‘ I
`` <NAME> , '' said I , `` you place great confidence in me , but I fear you will not take advice from me ? ''
Why do you take and choke a cove who has never done you any harm , neither of you ?
In the garden there was not a weed to be seen , and to judge from some dapper gardening-tools , a basket , and a pair of gloves which were lying in one of the walks , old Mr <NAME> had been at work in it that very morning .
If in violation of your mother ’ s sentiments , you had condescended to allow yourself to be patronized by the <NAME> , and if you had come from those halls of slavery -- ’ ‘ That ’ s mere nonsense , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Not I , indeed , ’ returned <NAME> .
‘ You ’ re a dutiful and affectionate little boy , you are , ain ’ t you , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ to come a-bonnetin ’ your father in his old age ? ’ ‘ <NAME> should I know who you wos ? ’ responded the son .
‘ No , <NAME> , ’ cried <NAME> , interrupting him , and rubbing his hands in an ecstasy .
He would have clasped the little figure closer , but he saw that the eyes appealed to him not to be moved .
`` Only I , '' returns the trooper , `` but as I know it , do me one more good turn and pull my hat over my eyes . ''
Mr <NAME> ’ s companion resumed the conversation .
‘ Sad experience , you know , brother-in-law. -- Kate , my dear , put that down in the next letter to <NAME> , or remind me to do it if I write. ’ <NAME> paused for a few moments , and seeing that he had now made pretty sure of the mother , in case the daughter objected to
To say that she is flung down on her side in the waves , with her masts dipping into them , and that , springing up again , she rolls over on the other side , until a heavy sea strikes her with the noise of a hundred great guns , and hurls her back—that she stops , and staggers
Still I was forced to wait for a start , and I wasn ’ t so lucky as to get a start .
It was the night of a little party at the <NAME> ’ s , which was given on the occasion of <NAME> ’ s departure for <NAME> , whither he was going as a cadet , or something of that kind : <NAME> having at length arranged the business .
For yourselves you speak , and not for Alice , or for me. ” ‘ The sisters , as with one accord , cried that their lot was cast together , and that there were dwellings for peace and virtue beyond the convent ’ s walls .
The damsel held her peace , however , when an early messenger bore the request of <NAME> Koeldwethout next morning , and modestly retired to her chamber , from the casement of which she watched the coming of the suitor and his retinue .
Then , <NAME> sat up and took a long look at his figure , and then cried : ‘ Hi -- I -- i !
‘ Well , <NAME> , well ! ’ said he , in an easy way though ill at ease with himself ‘ don ’ t be unhappy , don ’ t be reproachful. ’ ‘ I can not help being unhappy , but I do not mean to be reproachful .
<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> walked at a good smart pace in front ; and <NAME> , whose legs were not so long as his master 's , ran by the side .
I believe you are right , ’ said <NAME> , -- ‘ more than a mile off -- not far from the church -- lying partly on the roadside , and partly on the path , upon his face .
The wood is quite fresh where it gave way .
‘ Have you a good memory ? ’ ‘ I don ’ t know , ’ said <NAME> , shaking his head sorrowfully .
<NAME> <NAME> demanded how he afterwards recognised him then ?
‘ Now , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ for the little plan I have in my mind to bring this about ; because , I haven ’ t offered myself even to the father yet , I should have told you .
'Well , then , ' rejoined <NAME> , ' I would n't .
<NAME> ’ t stop to say one word to me , but go .
Completely worked round , haven ’ t you ? ’ ‘ Yes , deary , ’ said <NAME> , laying aside her shawl .
‘ Containing a position which I deny , ’ interrupted he of the dirty countenance .
‘ Come , come , <NAME> , ’ urged <NAME> , at his side .
after it was given out so ‘ tickerlerly , that <NAME> wasn ’ t to be made free with ! ’ exclaimed <NAME> .
May be a humble one !
Here , after gradually failing in loftier hopes , he had “ read ” with divers who had lacked opportunities or neglected them , and had refurbished divers others for special occasions , and had turned his acquirements to the account of literary compilation and correction , and on such means , added to some very moderate private resources ,
`` Why , indeed , sir , unless it is to cool her down ! ''
I stole it in my heart when she first showed it me hanging round her neck ; and the child 's death , perhaps , is on me besides !
He can ’ t go too soon .
It ’ s no fault of mine .
When this expression was upon him , he looked as if he were old ; but when it was stirred and broken up -- as it was now , in a moment , on his speaking to his daughter -- he became a handsome man , not past the prime of life .
Each was bowed down and broken .
Then a horse was found ; and she got another man to ride for life or death to the railroad , and send a message to <NAME> , which she wrote and gave him .
Her beautiful serene eyes met mine as she came towards me .
It was not until he had delighted in them for some time , that he wondered who had sent them ; and opened his door to ask the woman who must have put them there , how they had come into her hands .
‘ You deserve to have a house of your own ; don ’ t you , poor pa ? ’ ‘ I don ’ t deserve it better than another , my dear. ’ ‘ At any rate I , for one , want it more than another , ’ said <NAME> , holding him by the chin , as
He might not be so gently dealt with outside as he is there .
After a few moments ’ silence , it had relaxed into its usual weak condition .
sounded all over the <NAME> .
‘ Is fork , sir , fork , ’ replied Mr Swiveller slapping his pocket .
About something relating to <NAME> , he believed .
I have no more. ’ ‘ May I hope to prove them all ? ’ said Mr Dombey , with solemn gallantry , laying down a drawing he had held , and motioning towards the harp .
‘ Not for the world , ’ rejoined <NAME> .
You might have knocked me down on the flat of my back , sir , with the feather of a pen , I assure you , when Mrs. <NAME> said so .
They ’ re all done by one hand ; a little hand it is , not so old as yours , but a very clever one. ’ As the schoolmaster said this , he saw that a small blot of ink had been thrown on one of the copies , so he took a penknife from his pocket , and
But <NAME> has spared you this , R.W. , whatever it may have thought proper to inflict upon her ! ’ Here Mrs <NAME> burst into tears .
‘ However , ’ said Mrs. Nickleby , drying her tears , ‘ this has nothing to do -- certainly nothing whatever to do -- with the gentleman in the next house. ’ ‘ I should suppose that the gentleman in the next house has as little to do with us , ’ returned <NAME> .
He would have raised his hands and besought her for pardon , but she caught them in her own , and put them down , hurriedly .
All further inquiries were superseded by the appearance of old <NAME> , who , running upstairs and just recognising <NAME> , passed at once into <NAME> ’ s room .
It ’ s a name , <NAME> , ’ said the Major firmly , as if he defied Mr Dombey to contradict him , and would feel it his painful duty to bully him if he did , ‘ that is known and honoured in the <NAME> possessions abroad .
I shall never be an old man ; and if your hand placed me in the grave , and I could think , before I died , that you would come and look upon it sometimes with one of your kind smiles , and in the summer weather , when everything was alive -- not dead like me -- I
They were very glad to set the chair down , and give a good round loud double-knock at the street door .
For on his beginning to review , with the vivacity natural to himself and to his situation , the leading points in his own affairs , he soon discovered that the <NAME> had relapsed into his former profound state of mind ; and that while he eyed him steadfastly from beneath his bushy eyebrows , he evidently neither saw nor
Do you know they would be ruined to pay off my old scores ?
At that time , it seemed to him , he first finally resigned the dying hope that had flickered in nobody ’ s heart so much to its pain and trouble ; and from that time he became in his own eyes , as to any similar hope or prospect , a very much older man who had done with
‘ There ’ s a vooden leg in number six ; there ’ s a pair of <NAME> in thirteen ; there ’ s two pair of halves in the commercial ; there ’ s these here painted tops in the snuggery inside the bar ; and five more tops in the coffee-room. ’ ‘ Nothing more ? ’ said
And so shall somebody else too .
The elder <NAME> was in bed , I found , and <NAME> was milling his chocolate , which a melancholy little boy who was an apprentice -- it seemed such a curious thing to be apprenticed to the trade of dancing -- was waiting to carry upstairs .
I have thought sometimes ; ’ Sissy very timid here ; ‘ that perhaps I tried to learn too much , and that if I had asked to be allowed to try a little less , I might have— ’ ‘ No , <NAME> , no , ’ said <NAME> , shaking his head in his profoundest and most eminently
I have told you already , so don ’ t fly in the face of Providence by attempting to deny it ! ’ ‘ Hush !
I mistrust that by his coming back of his own accord , and showing himself innocent before them all , some one would be confounded , who—to prevent that—has stopped him , and put him out of the way. ’ ‘ That is a dreadful thought , ’ said <NAME> , turning pale .
He is a cordial young fellow , and we will have him to meet the brother and sister at dinner .
‘ Ye -- yes , ’ returned old <NAME> , rubbing his hands slowly , and considering the matter half aloud , as something pensive in the bright eyes looking at him arrested his attention .
I ’ ll take the opportunity , if you please , of entering your name in our Callers ’ <NAME> for the day. ’ Young <NAME> made another great show of changing the volume , taking up a pen , sucking it , dipping it , and running over previous entries before he wrote .
<NAME> <NAME> makes a hurried remark to the effect that they may be doing the deceased a service , that he hopes so .
<NAME> <NAME> 's name , therefore , duly embellished the doorpost down below ; and , as the afternoon shadows deepened , the owner of that name himself appeared , from overlooking a painter whom <NAME> had employed to add to the list the name of <NAME> , called <NAME> .

‘ My name is <NAME> , ’ said the gentleman .
‘ But , <NAME> bless me ! ’ cried Mr Meagles , rubbing his hands with a relish , ‘ it was an uncommonly pleasant thing being in quarantine , wasn ’ t it ?
But read the rest , Jo. ” “ The rest , eh , <NAME> ? ” said <NAME> , looking at it with a slow , searching eye , “ One , two , three .
The patriarchal Mr Casby then rose with the air of having done it himself , and blandly followed : leaving his daughter , as she followed in her turn , to remark to her former lover in a distracted whisper ( which she very much enjoyed ) , that they had drained the cup of life to the dregs ;
As he led them into the drawing-room , the recollection of the scene which had taken place there seemed to occur to him , for he cast a curious look at <NAME> , who bestowed upon it no other acknowledgment than a careless smile .
`` And you , being a good man , can pass it as such , and forgive and pity the dreamer , and be lenient and encouraging when he wakes ? ''
I knew this to be a weakness which must be overcome , but I had always said to myself that I would begin afresh when I got to where I now was .
So the doctor , breathing low , and closely watching , asks himself .
‘ You have been used to eaves-dropping .
Let us see the state of the case .
But <NAME> held her sacred purpose , unsuspected and unaided : and studied only how to bring her father to the understanding that she loved him , and made no appeal against him in any wandering thought .
That <NAME> bottle was found by my noble benefactor and yours , after he entered on possession of the estate .
<NAME> saw surprise and curiosity in the faces flitting past her ; saw long shadows coming back upon the pavement ; and heard voices that were strange to her asking her where she went , and what the matter was ; and though these frightened her the more at first , and made her hurry on the faster , they
This awful demonstration was headed by that determined woman Mrs MacStinger , who , preserving a countenance of inexorable resolution , and wearing conspicuously attached to her obdurate bosom a stupendous watch and appendages , which the <NAME> recognised at a glance as the property of <NAME> , conducted under her arm no other than that sagacious mariner ; he
`` But for <NAME> 's modesty , '' said <NAME> , `` I would take leave to correct him and say three distinguished men . ''
She has an extensive acquaintance at <NAME> among appalling old gentlemen with thin legs and nankeen trousers , and is of high standing in that dreary city .
You have a noble nature , and <NAME> 's love may make you worthier every day . ''
‘ You are fevered and ill. ’ <NAME> waved his hand carelessly , and concealing the indisposition he really felt , now that the excitement which had sustained him was over , took a hurried farewell of <NAME> , and left him .
inquired <NAME> : anxious to encourage any symptoms of good-humour in the unwelcome visitors .
‘ Two witnesses to it ; <NAME> knows the nature of an oath , he does ; we shall have you there , sir .
Give us ’ old. ’ A shilling passes ; and , in that spirit of confidence which should pervade all business transactions between principals of honour , this piece of business is considered done .
This devil whom you make an angel of .
Mouldering away before our eyes .
But then quickly added , reading <NAME> ’ s face : ‘ No .
They followed the girl up some steep corner-stairs without meeting any one , and stopped in the dark while she went on for a candle .
I was young , I was accomplished , I was good-looking , I was independent -- by God I was , child ! -- and people sought me out , and envied me .
<NAME> , being present , then named , in furtherance of a suggestion she had previously offered to the <NAME> , <NAME> .
Some say she really is , or was , a party to a suit , but no one knows for certain because no one cares .
‘ Have a chop ! ’ ‘ Not for the world , my good sir ! ’ cried <NAME> , stopping him on his way to the bell ; ‘ appetite and myself , <NAME> , have long been strangers. ’ <NAME> was so well pleased with his new name , and appeared to think it so obliging in <NAME>
‘ Will you have some of this ? ’ said the fat boy , plunging into the pie up to the very ferules of the knife and fork .
Who was it whose least word did what his utmost means could not ?
<NAME> <NAME> glanced with a troubled eye at us and grudgingly nodded assent .
‘ This happy idea , brave sir , ’ <NAME> resumed after drinking , ‘ was a happy idea for several reasons .
A doleful place to be born and bred in , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Yes indeed , sir ! ’ ‘ If she had constantly thought of herself , and settled with herself that everybody visited this place upon her , turned it against her , and cast it at her , she would have led an irritable and probably
Once—once—I found myself on deck .
At that point , my convict became so frantically exasperated , that he would have rushed upon him but for the interposition of the soldiers .
There happened to be no customer in the shop but <NAME> , of the restless fingers and the croaking voice .
We do not appear to understand each other yet .
To be sure , it was a deserted place , down to the pigeon-house in the brewery-yard , which had been blown crooked on its pole by some high wind , and would have made the pigeons think themselves at sea , if there had been any pigeons there to be rocked by it .
I have a settled purpose. ’ ‘ And a good one , I hope , ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> looked at it -- it was the picture that resembled <NAME> -- as if it were a living thing ; and with a wicked , silent laugh upon his face , that seemed in part addressed to it , though it was all derisive of the great man standing so unconscious beside him .
These are the corporate beggars .
Having achieved this feat , he sighed again , and applied himself assiduously to the pie .
I see , ’ said the stranger , half aside , ‘ negus too strong here -- liberal landlord -- very foolish -- very -- lemonade much better -- hot rooms -- elderly gentlemen -- suffer for it in the morning -- cruel -- cruel ; ’ and he moved on a step or two .
It 's as good as another . ''
There 's more where that come from .
The discussions ended in our hiring for him , by the month , a neat little furnished lodging in a quiet old house near <NAME> .
The child sat watching and thinking of these things , until the phantom in her mind so increased in gloom and terror , that she felt it would be a relief to hear the old man ’ s voice , or , if he were asleep , even to see him , and banish some of the fears that clustered
`` I certainly sha n't hold my hand , when I can get anything in it by reaching it out , for the sake of such a man as He was , I promise you , <NAME> , '' returned the woman coolly .
‘ <NAME> , my dear boy , ’ said Mr Meagles , on the evening of the following day , ‘ Mother and I have been talking this over , and we don ’ t feel comfortable in remaining as we are .
How long was I to bear this ?
I have supposed the head to be all-sufficient .
'At your service , ma'am , ' said <NAME> , who had been stopping outside to rub his shoes clean , and to shake the snow off his coat ; and who now made his appearance , bearing the cocked hat in one hand and a bundle in the other .
'Well , ' said the undertaker 's wife , when <NAME> had finished his supper : which she had regarded in silent horror , and with fearful auguries of his future appetite : 'have you done ? '
I don ’ t think he can be worse. ’ The child asked his leave to prepare breakfast , and her grandfather coming down stairs , they all three partook of it together .
The stranger walked boldly up to , and returned with , the master of the ceremonies ; a little introductory pantomime ; and the stranger and Mrs. <NAME> took their places in a quadrille .
Do that again , boys. ’ The two combatants went to work afresh , and chopped away until the swords emitted a shower of sparks : to the great satisfaction of Mr Crummles , who appeared to consider this a very great point indeed .
There is no such place in that part now ; but it remained there for many years , looking with a baulked countenance at the wilderness patched with unfruitful gardens and pimpled with eruptive summerhouses , that it had meant to run over in no time .

The lady was not young and fresh from the hand of <NAME> , but was young and fresh from the hand of her maid .
Polly then put out her light , locked the house-door , delivered the key at an agent ’ s hard by , and went home as fast as she could go ; rejoicing in the shrill delight that her unexpected arrival would occasion there .
`` I beg your pardon , miss ! ''
The latter so received it , and remained silent .
But what was really in his mind , was the weak figure with its strong purpose , the thin worn shoes , the insufficient dress , and the pretence of recreation and enjoyment .
‘ Well , <NAME> , how have you got on without me all day ?
His mind would run upon that spot .
‘ You dropped down upon me. ’ ‘ I dropped down upon you , then , you ill-conditioned man , ’ ( <NAME> chuckled at having forced her to adopt his phrase , ) ‘ for having been needlessly significant to <NAME> that morning .
‘ But I am acquainted with these chaps , ’ said <NAME> .
I know she is here with me. ’ ‘ Then , ma ’ am , ’ said Mr Meagles , ‘ allow me to make known to you that I shall be happy to have her back , and that my wife and daughter will be happy to have her back .

But few people noticed her at those times , in the garb she wore : or if they did , believed that she was tutored to excite compassion , and passed on .
He recognized the friends the instant they reappeared , but their reappearance had no effect on his composure .
As the sisters reached the porch , he quickened his pace , and called upon them to stop .
He determined to see her , cost what it might ; but here an insurmountable objection presented itself , for whether the explanatory ‘ over that way , ’ and ‘ down there , ’ of <NAME> , meant three miles off , or thirty , or three hundred , he could in no wise guess .
It appeared incredible that the coat and waistcoat could be seen by mortal eyes without the <NAME> ; but he certainly was not in them , otherwise his legs -- the houses in <NAME> Place not being lofty -- would have obstructed the street door , which was perfectly clear .

It came upon me as the close of the benignant history I had been pursuing , and I felt that I had but one thing to do .
Will you take a drop o ’ somethin ’ this mornin ’ , <NAME> ? ’ <NAME> acquiesced in this agreeable proposal ; and having deposited his book in his coat pocket , accompanied <NAME> to the tap , where they were soon occupied in discussing an exhilarating compound , formed by mixing together , in a pewter vessel ,
‘ Well , well , ’ said <NAME> , smiling as good men smile when they compassionate their own weakness or that of their fellow-creatures , ‘ this is wide of the bull ’ s-eye .
His recent despondency , not to say despair , was gone in a moment .
But it was very pleasant to see the pride with which he hoisted it up and made it fast ; smiling as he did so , with a relish and not merely mechanically .

But we are made fast alongside the packet , whose huge red funnel is smoking bravely , giving rich promise of serious intentions .
It was a very genteel entertainment , very handsomely served .
In such a very hard manner and with eyes so particularly green that <NAME> 's natural gravity is much deepened by the contemplation of that venerable man .
We had half-an-hour ’ s talk , all together ; and I asked her about the twins , who , she said , were ‘ grown great creatures ’ ; and after <NAME> and <NAME> , whom she described as ‘ absolute giants ’ , but they were not produced on that occasion .
She specially applied here at the house to be admitted , as not regularly belonging to our town , and—yes , you are right , <NAME> , you are right. ’ ‘ Now , stop a bit ! ’ cried <NAME> , once more .
But she hardly ever spoke -- I question if she ever did -- without making some mention of him .

‘ <NAME> ’ s , up <NAME> way ? ’ Mr Wegg admits that he is bound for that port .
no mistake about that , ’ said a very red-faced man , behind a cigar .
Yes , <NAME> thought she had better go with me .
I should speak of foreign dancers , and the <NAME> End of <NAME> , and May Fair , and lords and ladies and honourables. ’ ‘ I trust , sir , ’ rejoined Mrs. Sparsit , with decent resignation , ‘ it is not necessary that you should do anything of that kind .
The fashionable intelligence says so for the comfort of the <NAME> , and it knows all fashionable things .
But all happiness has an end -- hence the chief pleasure of its next beginning -- and as it was now growing late , they agreed it was time to turn their faces homewards .
`` Why , there 's not much air to be got here ; and what there is , is not very freshening , '' Weevle answers , glancing up and down the court .
`` Then it was your young man who came for me .
The <NAME> of My Resolution XIV .
The name of Mr Tite <NAME> has been mentioned to me as representing some highly influential interest among his creditors .
‘ Sir. ’ Stay here. ’ <NAME> seemed uncertain .
' I beg your pardon , ' said the <NAME> , looking up with an air of abstraction .
But , when she suffered it to break loose , it was only for a moment .
‘ <NAME> , you amaze me , ’ cried <NAME> .
‘ I will have a respectful , prompt , and ready bearing towards myself , ’ he continued , ‘ and towards <NAME> , and towards your mother .
It was evening when I arrived , much fatigued by the journey I had so often made so easily .
'You have some papers , ' said <NAME> advancing , 'which were placed in your hands , for better security , by a man called <NAME> . '
You must not think my visit all friendly and disinterested , <NAME> , for -- I am afraid I may be cruelly prejudiced -- I do not like to let papa go away alone , with him. ’ ‘ Does he exercise the same influence over <NAME> still , <NAME> ? ’ Agnes shook her head .
‘ I don ’ t display camels myself , I am above them : I am a more solid man ; but these camels have basked in the light of my countenance , and how dare you , sir , insinuate to me that I have irradiated any but unimpeachable camels ? ’ The camels are polishing up in the

It was a great dim , shabby pile , with high old oaken pews , among which about a score of people lost themselves every Sunday ; while the clergyman ’ s voice drowsily resounded through the emptiness , and the organ rumbled and rolled as if the church had got the colic , for want of a congregation to

As we advanced , I began to feel misgivings that my companion lost confidence .

I used to think there were so many whom you might have married , who would not have brought such charge and trouble on you , and who would have made your home a worthier home .
<NAME> , who had been engaged in a manner in which every reader may imagine for himself or herself , was hurrying downstairs in obedience to his angry summons , when he encountered a new surprise .
<NAME> <NAME> returned no other reply than by taking the little <NAME> in her arms , and making his cockade perfectly flat and limp with her caresses .
It was too much for Mrs. <NAME> , who immediately rose .
But it was much more hard to be compelled to doubt either her father or <NAME> , so affectionate and dear to her , and to think of her love for each of them , by turns , with fear , distrust , and wonder .
If <NAME> would have the distinguished goodness to occupy the other salon especially reserved for him , for but five minutes , all would go well .
Not that he has any suspicions , but that he may as well know what they are up to in there .
‘ Hold your tongue , sir , ’ said <NAME> .
`` No , sir , '' I said , `` I do n't think I shall , '' really not seeing on consideration why I should be .
Most solemnly. ’ ‘ Nor let the <NAME> touch me , not yet so much as look at me ! ’ with another struggle .

Then came the <NAME> , who complained that these same people _would_ get drunk , and showed in tabular statements that they did get drunk , and proved at tea parties that no inducement , human or <NAME> ( except a medal ) , would induce them to forego their custom of getting drunk .
What can I do to save him , sir ? '
<NAME> Leicester rises , adjusts her scarf about her , and returns to his seat .
‘ Of course there is. ’ ‘ Who do you mean ? ’ said <NAME> , in the same mysterious manner .
He is among us ! ” “ Among us ! ” from the universal throat again .
<NAME> <NAME> , my amiable subject , you will get your money .
Let his foe follow him , and find him for himself , but not through me !
There was a Mrs <NAME> lived at <NAME> before me , and perhaps you ’ re mistaking me for her .
‘ But why did you tell her ?
‘ This is a good beginning , ’ he said bitterly .
‘ Why , confound the woman , ’ exclaimed <NAME> , ‘ she IS sentimental !
The little picture was so instantaneously dissolved by our going in , that one might have doubted whether it had ever been .
In the best room were two oil portraits of the kit-cat size , representing the landlord and his infant son ; both looking as bold as lions , and staring out of the canvas with an intensity that would have been cheap at any price .
<NAME> , I wo n't be smothered any more .
I am not a traitor. ” “ He lies ! ” cried the smith .
I took the tablets from her hand , and it trembled again , and it trembled more as she took off the chain to which the pencil was attached , and put it in mine .
These inquiries proved very harassing to R. W. who , besides being a little disturbed by wine , was in perpetual terror of committing himself by the utterance of stray words that would betray his guilty foreknowledge .
The cook and housemaid screamed .
<NAME> would insist upon carrying the basket , and <NAME> would insist upon carrying it herself , which gave rise to a struggle , in which <NAME> captured the basket and the bandbox likewise .
‘ Is there anybody at home ?
`` Now , little housewife , '' said my guardian , looking at his watch , `` I was strictly timed before I came upstairs , for you must not be tired too soon ; and my time has waned away to the last minute .
If one forlorn wanderer then pacing the dark streets , could have heard her innocent disclosure , and could have seen the drops of pity kissed away by her husband from the soft blue eyes so loving of that husband , he might have cried to the night -- and the words would not have parted from his lips for

'That 's not the point , ' said the doctor , mysteriously .
Why has Mr Headstone gone from us in that way ? ’ ‘ He asked me -- you know he asked me -- to be his wife , Charley. ’ ‘ Well ? ’ said the boy , impatiently .

Mrs Gowan ’ s door was attended by a family servant of several years ’ standing , who had his own crow to pluck with the public concerning a situation in the Post-Office which he had been for some time expecting , and to which he was not yet appointed .
You see me looking on you now , and you can read the warmth of passion for you that is breathing in my face. ’ Not a curl of the proud lip , not a flash of the dark eye , nothing but the same intent and searching look , accompanied these words .
Would you ? ” and began dancing backwards and forwards in a manner quite unparalleled within my limited experience .
‘ Oh ! ’ thought <NAME> , ‘ that this slender chance might not be lost , and that I might prevail , if it were but for one week ’ s time and reconsideration ! ’ ‘ You are charged with some commission to me , sir , ’ said <NAME> , presenting herself in great agitation .
A damp mist rose from the river , and the marshy ground about ; and spread itself over the dreary fields .

She wanted no strengthening in her firmness ; but if she had had need of any , she would have derived it from his kindling face .

‘ At seven , ’ says <NAME> , looking at his plain old silver watch -- the very watch he once took a wheel out of , at school , to make a water-mill .
This led me to speculate whether any of them ever tumbled down , and then I fancied that I felt light falls on my face , -- a disagreeable turn of thought , suggesting other and more objectionable approaches up my back .
‘ Well , <NAME> , ’ said Dr Lumbey , ‘ this makes six .
I don ’ t go there on purpose , you know , but I happen to be in the neighbourhood very often ; and when I find myself there , why -- why I call. ’ ‘ Nat ’ rally , ’ observed the <NAME> .
A dozen times did he softly turn the handle of some bedroom door which resembled his own , when a gruff cry from within of ‘ Who the devil ’ s that ? ’ or ‘ What do you want here ? ’ caused him to steal away , on tiptoe , with a perfectly marvellous celerity .
The gentleman who was against him had to speak first , and being in dreadfully good spirits ( for he had , in the last trial , very nearly procured the acquittal of a young gentleman who had had the misfortune to murder his father ) he spoke up , you may be sure ; telling the jury that if

‘ An addition to our little <NAME> , <NAME> , ’ said the <NAME> ; ‘ Mr <NAME> ’ s son. ’ Young <NAME> blushed again ; and finding , from a solemn silence which prevailed , that he was expected to say something , said to <NAME> , ‘ How are you ? ’ in a voice so deep
In this state , the waiter ’ s dismal intelligence about the ships immediately connected itself , without any effort of my volition , with my uneasiness about <NAME> .

Let me put your shawl tidy .
In which case , we might not only know the fact , but might know from <NAME> what the terms of the communication were. ’ ‘ I see ! ’ cried Rosa .
Thus reasoned <NAME> , and in pursuance of this reasoning he and his friend soon afterwards repaired to <NAME> ’ s , there to execute a plan of operations concerted by <NAME> himself , avowedly to promote his friend ’ s object , and really to attain his own .
When I opened the shutters and looked out at the wet wild morning , all of a leaden hue ; when I walked from room to room ; when I sat down again shivering , before the fire , waiting for my laundress to appear ; I thought how miserable I was , but hardly knew why , or how
`` My dear , I do n't know it , '' said I .
“ Now , ” said <NAME> , gliding away the instant I touched her cheek , “ you are to take care that I have some tea , and you are to take me to Richmond. ” Her reverting to this tone as if our association were forced upon us , and we were mere puppets , gave me pain
‘ <NAME> , Mr Rokesmith , I can ’ t say what I consider them , ’ returned the young lady .
He was very fond of reading the papers , very fond of making fancy-sketches with a pencil , very fond of nature , very fond of art .
Very glad indeed to have the pleasure .
‘ I am charmed , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ let me assure you , with <NAME> .
Not I , I hope ! ’ ‘ You hope , indeed !

There was a cut upon his forehead , and they had been wetting his hair , which lay bedabbled and entangled on the pillow .
He asked her , after short consideration , why she supposed so .
And very amiable he looked , and a very low bow he made , as he advanced , and setting himself down at the nearest table , ordered something to drink of the grinning <NAME> .
All right ! ’ But appearing to be incensed by imaginary contradiction , or other ill-usage , Mr F. ’ s <NAME> , instead of relapsing into silence , made the following additional proclamation : ‘ I hate a fool ! ’ She imparted to this sentiment , in itself almost <NAME> , so extremely injurious and personal a character
And not the least amazing circumstance connected with her being vaguely the town talk is that people hovering on the confines of <NAME> 's high connexion , people who know nothing and ever did know nothing about her , think it essential to their reputation to pretend that she is their topic too , and to retail her at second-hand
Sometimes she wondered , with a swelling heart and rising tear , whether she was proficient enough in anything to surprise him when they should become companions .
Why , I think that sometimes. ’ ‘ You are laughing , <NAME> .
We will behold , and minutely examine , a scene so interesting to every Englishman. ’ ‘ We will , ’ was the animated cry of three voices .
That the mother and father , unknown to one another , were dwelling within so many miles , furlongs , yards if you like , of one another .
A part of the <NAME> , indeed , contained so much public spirit and private virtue that not even this strong leverage could move it to good fellowship with a tainted accuser .
As it was , she merely stipulated , “ If you bring the boy back with his head blown to bits by a musket , do n't look to me to put it together again. ” The sergeant took a polite leave of the ladies , and parted from <NAME> as from a comrade ; though I doubt if he
‘ Play ! ’ suddenly cried the bowler .

The quick eye of the <NAME> detected his helplessness immediately , and now , as she afterwards observed , she felt she had got him .
And it takes away the hunger as well as wittles , deary. ’ She hands him the nearly-emptied pipe , and sinks back , turning over on her face .
`` No more did n't I of mine , '' cries Guster .
Every word he uttered had a force that no other grace could have imparted to it .

But he thought it better not to ask the question ; and walked back to the shop : thinking over all he had seen and heard .
Why , how old are you ? ’ ‘ I don ’ t know. ’ Mr <NAME> opened his eyes very wide , and appeared thoughtful for a moment ; then , bidding the child mind the door until he came back , vanished straightway .
<NAME> back , look back , and see if we are pursued !
I believe your father is acquainted with his daughter <NAME> ’ s writing .
The child answered that that was not its name ; it was a garden -- his brother ’ s .
Mrs <NAME> and <NAME> repaired to the drawing-room , where that excellent mother considered it incumbent on her to shed a few irrepressible tears , supposed to be forced from her by her daughter ’ s felicity ; and which she was still drying , very gingerly , with a laced corner of her pocket-handkerchief , when her son-in-law appeared
And may my prayers go up to Heaven that ‘ twill be a happiness to her , and a comfort , and a honour , all her life !
`` You said , dear guardian , when we spoke of <NAME> before <NAME> left us , that you thought he would give a long trial to another country .
The good brothers and <NAME> occupied some time in discussing the probability of his return ; and , when it became apparent that he would not come back , they hesitated whether or no to send after him .
But , that it was hopeless to question him on that one reserved point , <NAME> , with his small eyes too near together , saw full well .
It was a passionate , loving , thankful , womanly action , but the hand made no response -- dropped cold and heavy , and took to its knitting again .
I ’ m a going to seek my Em ’ ly .
‘ I doubt , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ if he can be here till next day. ’ ‘ Then I will come next night too , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ A hard case it has been , and a hard case it is on <NAME> , ’ he finished by saying , with all the honest feeling the topic roused in him .

This was very disagreeable to a guilty mind .
Whether they turned into it on his movement or on hers matters little .
Her feelings were so much excited on the occasion , that she found it indispensable to afford them this relief , even without having the comfort of any audience or sympathy whatever .
‘ <NAME> , the pipkin ! ’ <NAME> drew forth , from the same hiding-place , a small brass pipkin , which <NAME> observed he prided himself upon , particularly because it looked so business-like .
There was something in this .
The night wore out , and , as he stood upon the bridge listening to the water as it splashed the river-walls of the <NAME> of <NAME> , where the picturesque confusion of houses and cathedral shone bright in the light of the moon , the day came coldly , looking like a dead face out of the sky .
I wish I could think it was only manner -- I hope it may be -- ’ ( Here the affectionate relative heaved a deep sigh , and shook her head despondingly ) .
Then is there a singular kind of parallel between her and the little glass chandeliers of another age embellishing that assembly-room , which , with their meagre stems , their spare little drops , their disappointing knobs where no drops are , their bare little stalks from which knobs and drops have both departed , and their little feeble prismatic
‘ Would you not like to be rich NOW , my darling ? ’ ‘ How can you ask me such a question , <NAME> dear ?
“ I write with so much difficulty , the cold is so severe , I am so fearful of being detected and consigned to an underground cell and total darkness , that I must abridge this narrative .

In the evening I started , by that conveyance , down the road I had traversed under so many vicissitudes .
Being besought to go to him and dress the wound , the <NAME> had passed out at the same gate , and had found him in the arms of a company of <NAME> , who were seated on the bodies of their victims .
You are , we will say in round numbers , twenty years of age ; <NAME> is , we will say in round numbers , fifty .
Approaching nearer and nearer , the bargeman became <NAME> , in rough water-side second-hand clothing .
Accompanying <NAME> to the gate , she as closely watched what followed .
I said several times that I should like to see them at their meal ; but as the gentleman to whom I mentioned this desire appeared to be suddenly taken rather deaf , I did not pursue the request .
Nothing of any kind was missing .
There is little enough in the high tide of the day , but there is next to none at night .
He can not do so , she tells him , too plainly or too briefly .
‘ For a young man , Mr <NAME> is not a very great walker ; and I observe that he generally falls tired , and requires a good long rest , when he has come as far as this .
There was no wind to make a ripple on the foul water within the harbour , or on the beautiful sea without .
Where am I to wait for her ?
He meant to be clear of the town very early ; before the Hands were in the streets .
'And your reasons , <NAME> , ' he said , at length , in a low voice ; 'your reasons for this decision ? '
Before you answer , keep this hat well in your mind and also this walking-stick. ’ ‘ I am willing , <NAME> , to come to terms. ’ ‘ Willing won ’ t do , <NAME> .
I can speak to no one else about him , but poor Kit .

‘ But what ’ s the use of tapping ? ’ he said , ‘ She ’ ll never hear .
<NAME> profusion is in the shops : particularly in the articles of currants , raisins , spices , candied peel , and moist sugar .

It was the peculiarity of the nuptials that they were all Bride .
‘ <NAME> down , <NAME> , ’ said Mr Toots .
I kissed her hand , and she took him in her arms , and went away caressing him .
I asked if the brickmaker 's wife were ill , but <NAME> said no .
‘ I ask you , <NAME> , are you frightened ?
‘ No , of course not , ’ he assented .
You ’ d persuade me if you could , that you are a poor Jew .
I am very sorry I intruded , I am sure .
‘ <NAME> ’ t be alarmed , my dear , ’ he said , gently ; ‘ I am not angry with you .
His countenance had , perhaps for years , become so set in its contentious expression that it did not soften , even now when he was quiet .
What do you mean ? ’ ‘ I merely mean that as I shall have many dealings with this lady , if she will kindly allow me , I will not trouble her with such forms , ’ said <NAME> .
Oliver reached the stile at which the by-path terminated ; and once more gained the high-road .
I couldn ’ t bear to have anything of that sort going on with myself .
‘ We ’ ll go and look at ‘ em. ’ Away we went .
<NAME> constitution has much to do with the development of such facts , no doubt ; but in this case , appetite carried it hollow over the tender passion ; Mr Dombey being very cool and collected , and the Major fretting and fuming in a state of violent heat and irritation .
Our way lies through a beautiful country , richly cultivated , and luxuriant in its promise of an abundant harvest .
I am seldom called upon to put my young friends into mourning ; not into real mourning , that is ; Court mourning they are rather proud of .
Whether Mr Dombey , wrapped in his own greatness , was at all aware of this , or no , there had not been wanting opportunities already for his complete enlightenment ; and at that moment it might have been effected by the one glance of the dark eye that lighted on him , after it had rapidly and scornfully
Some of us have damp ways , and some of us have dry ways .
‘ No , I won ’ t go so far as to say that , ’ urged the cherub , a little remonstrant against the very decisive and unpitying tone ; ‘ but he mightn ’ t have suited <NAME> , or <NAME> mightn ’ t have suited him , or fifty things , whereas now I hope she can
Let it be her -- not you -- that sees my fallen child ! ’ He walked a little in front of us , and kept before us for some minutes .
Hearing a footstep and the rustle of a dress , the <NAME> turned with a palpitating remembrance of the dreadful Mrs MacStinger , at the instant when <NAME> made a motion with her hand towards him , reeled , and fell upon the floor .
This reflection would make the Captain profoundly melancholy , until the return of Mr Toots ; when he would fall to his cards again , with many side winks and nods , and polite waves of his hook at <NAME> , importing that he wasn ’ t going to do so any more .
‘ I don ’ t know what it may be , I don ’ t know what it may not be , ’ said <NAME> ; ‘ it ’ s some secret in which your uncle is concerned , but what , I ’ ve not yet been able to discover , although I have my strong suspicions .
But , invested for the moment with extraordinary power , he raised himself completely : obliging me to rise too , or I could not have still supported him .
‘ I say nothing of his plea for claiming my confidence .
In whatever state she walked away , she certainly did not walk back again .
<NAME> , <NAME> , this long while !
The great bell of <NAME> 's was striking one in the cleared air , when <NAME> , escorted by <NAME> , high-booted and bearing a lantern , set forth on his return-passage to <NAME> .
This was the result of his day ’ s anxiety , and this was the decision he put in practice when the day closed in .
She shook her head as if she had not derived all the comfort she had fondly expected from this interview , but thanked him nevertheless for the trouble he had kindly taken .
I promise you nothing , ’ said the dolls ’ dressmaker , dabbing two dabs at him with her needle , as if she put out both his eyes .
‘ You may see him now , ’ said she , ‘ if you ’ ll condescend to take a peep. ’ With these mysterious words , she preceded the visitor into a little parlour behind the shop , with a little window in it commanding a very little dull back-yard .
But , perhaps , she little thinks how I would retort upon her if I married her son .
<NAME> <NAME> , open your eyes , that ’ s a love !
The coach follows because it is attached to them and goes on wheels : not because you are in it .
You may be aware , <NAME> -- and , possibly , you may be aware too , <NAME> -- that a little distance has interposed itself between me and some of my friends , and that where I used to visit a good deal , I do not visit now. ’ Polly , who , with a woman ’ s
This was , when he was asked a Parliamentary question on any one topic , to return an answer on any other .
Will you oblige me by giving it the calmest and coolest perusal , and by discussing the subject afterwards with me , in the tone and spirit in which alone it ought to be discussed ?
At this sally , the boys laughed .
It was lost upon <NAME> , who was stooping at the moment to tie the boot-lace which the dog had torn .
`` Why did you not tell me , Mrs .
That did not extend to me , she told me in a gush of love and confidence ( at that time , I had known her something less than five minutes ) ; if they were all like <NAME> , it would be quite another thing .
But something has been -- You feel quite strong to-day , don ’ t you ? ’ ‘ <NAME> strong. ’ The hand he held crept up a little nearer his face .
‘ You don ’ t know who he is !
Where ’ s that there fresh lad , that nothing couldn ’ t tire nor put out , and that sparkled up and blushed so , when we joked him about <NAME> ’ s <NAME> , that he was beautiful to look at ?
Indeed , the excitement extended itself over the whole street , and groups of ladies might be seen standing at the doors , ( some in the interesting condition in which Mrs. <NAME> had last appeared in public , ) relating their experiences of similar occurrences .
His colour changed though , when , without a pause , it came on through the heavy door , and passed into the room before his eyes .
“ You acted noble , my boy , ” said he .
He would have been more and more sensible of what was wanting in his home .
Then our brother was drawn -- swiftly -- to drunkenness .
I am afraid you ’ ll find me very dull .
<NAME> ! ’ We gave him three times three , and another , and a good one to finish with .
‘ But about these boys of yours ; you wanted to speak to me ? ’ ‘ Yes , ’ replied <NAME> .
They were now by an avenue of trees .
This was done and said with a comical mixture of jest and earnest , and , leading to a great amount of laughter , made them very merry indeed .
Everybody present , except the one wigged gentleman who looked at the ceiling , stared at him .
I hope they will manage their little income. ’ ‘ Oh !
‘ I am not very likely to , ’ rejoined <NAME> .
You hold your life on the condition that to the last you shall struggle hard for it .

Having made various ineffective attempts to fit the parcel ( which was some two feet square ) into the crown thereof , <NAME> took it under his arm , and after putting on his fingerless gloves with great precision and nicety , keeping his eyes fixed upon <NAME> all the time , he adjusted his hat upon his head with

While the attorney was thus engaged , the dwarf was groping under the table , muttering desperate imprecations on himself , and mankind in general , and all inanimate objects to boot , which suggested to Mr Brass the question , ‘ what ’ s the matter ? ’ ‘ The key , ’ said the dwarf , looking viciously
<NAME> <NAME> took no heed of me when I went into the parlour where he was , but sat by the fireside , weeping silently , and pondering in his elbow-chair .
‘ Ah , <NAME> ? ’ said <NAME> .
“ <NAME> , ” said his friend , squaring himself at him with a bullying air , as if the fire-grate had been the furnace in which sustained endeavour was forged , and the one delicate thing to be done for the old <NAME> of old <NAME> was to shoulder him into it , “ your way is , and

But under this difficulty , as under all the other difficulties of my journey , I seemed to be sustained and led on by my fanciful picture of my mother in her youth , before I came into the world .

Even had it not been so , the dear old china shepherdess would have worried herself to death with fears for her son , and with general trepidation occasioned by their having such an inmate .
`` Why , I must get a lodging of some sort , '' said <NAME> , pondering .
The furniture was all very solid and good , like his watch-chain .
You are -- hum -- quite accurate , I have no doubt .
There were the piles of city roofs and chimneys , more free from smoke than on week-days ; and there were the distant masts and steeples .
I walked out once , <NAME> , during a conversation between two brothers , to which , in the beginning , young <NAME> was a party .

I must do the best I can , for the present , I suppose. ’ In spite of himself , he appeared abashed by my aunt ’ s indignant tears , and came slouching out of the garden .
Here he is ! -- He looks quiet. ’ With these words , which had the effect of causing the harmless <NAME> painful agitation , Mr Fledgeby withdrew to his former post , and the old man entered the counting-house .

At first , I had to shut some gates after me , and now and then to stand still while the cattle that were lying in the banked-up pathway arose and blundered down among the grass and reeds .
Go at once I must , it stands to reason ; because I can ’ t live without breathing freely ; and I can ’ t breathe freely until <NAME> is out of this Marshalsea .

‘ Now , if old <NAME> had entertained the most remote or distant idea of the state of the affections of <NAME> , he would just have razed the school-room to the ground , or exterminated its master from the surface of the earth , or committed some other outrage and atrocity of an equally ferocious and violent description ;

Perhaps it was so likened by the lonely <NAME> , standing on the brink of the lock .
‘ The young lady of whom you speak is , as you know , <NAME> , shortly to be married , ’ said <NAME> , gravely ; ‘ therefore your admiration , if it be of that special nature which you seem to indicate , is outrageously misplaced .

He saw nothing of it , for before he looked at her , she had again cast down her eyes !
Before turning to retrace his steps , he stopped upon the margin , to look down at the reflected night .
A housekeeper would be acceptable over yonder at the <NAME> , for instance .
‘ May I take the liberty to say something ? ’ ‘ You may , ’ <NAME> graciously conceded .
We alighted at one of the entrances to the Square she had mentioned , where I directed the coach to wait , not knowing but that we might have some occasion for it .
His recital ended , <NAME> insisted upon his young friend ’ s stripping off his coat and allowing whatever injuries he had received to be properly tended .
Within , there were two glasses of rum and milk prepared , and two biscuits .
She withdrew her hand timidly from his arm as we stopped to speak to them , and blushed as she gave it to <NAME> and to me .
Every street was a sawpit , and there were no top-sawyers ; every passenger was an under-sawyer , with the sawdust blinding him and choking him .
<NAME> <NAME> had re-counted the teaspoons , re-weighed the sugar-tongs , made a closer inspection of the milk-pot , and ascertained to a nicety the exact condition of the furniture , down to the very horse-hair seats of the chairs ; and had repeated each process full half a dozen times ; before he began to think that it was

The stranger did not recognize me , but I recognized him as the gentleman I had met on the stairs , on the occasion of my second visit to <NAME> .
“ 'Not dead , ' said I ; 'but like to die . '
The murdered person was a woman , -- a woman a good ten years older , very much larger , and very much stronger .
I can ’ t say more than that for ‘ em. ’ ‘ I ’ ll take this man myself , sir , ’ said Mr Inspector to <NAME> .
P'raps they would n't do it if I wos to go myself .
‘ Well , sir , I have been thinking that if you were in waiting in the garden behind , alone -- ’ ‘ Alone , ’ said <NAME> .
‘ How ? ’ was <NAME> ’ s inquiry , in a low and slow voice , after a silence .
He appeared to have a very extraordinary and miscellaneous connection , and very odd calls he made , some at great rich houses , and some at small poor ones , but all upon one subject : money .

And now to see him after all , and in a prison too !
A brown sunburnt gentleman , who appears in some inaptitude for sleep to be wandering abroad rather than counting the hours on a restless pillow , strolls hitherward at this quiet time .
`` Why have you told my story to so many persons ? ''
So there ain ’ t no other character ; ain ’ t there , my lad ? ’ Walter briskly waved his hand in the negative .

Look to your feet , <NAME> , for we shall try your boots .
Since leaving home , they had halted here and there for necessary refreshment , and had frequently been delayed , especially in the night time , by waiting for fresh horses .
‘ <NAME> ? ’ repeated the other , with a wide show of his teeth .
'You seem out of humour , <NAME> . '
His shop was shut and he was not there , which was a relief to <NAME> , and left her quite alone .
Not of late years , ’ replied the <NAME> , with a flourish of his hand .
In his better days , before he had become enfeebled by dissipation and emaciated by disease , he had been in the receipt of a good salary , which , if he had been careful and prudent , he might have continued to receive for some years -- not many ; because these men either die early , or by
He felt the more resigned to it , forasmuch as <NAME> enjoyed herself completely , and <NAME> was delighted .
And it was not a contest of politeness , or by any means a matter of form , for she knew very well that her husband wished to enter the house in this order , that he might have a favourable opportunity of inflicting a few pinches on her arms , which were seldom free from impressions of his fingers
I am not very old , you may say .
His nose once brought to it , shall be held to it by these hands , Mr Venus , till the sparks flies out in showers. ’ With this agreeable promise <NAME> stumped out , and shut the shop-door after him .
‘ Have I startled you ? ’ he asked .
Here on the head of an empty barrel stood on end were an ink-bottle , some old stumps of pens , and some dirty playbills ; and against the wall were pasted several large printed alphabets in several plain hands .
As the old man , <NAME> , sat by , helping her in such small ways as he could , he found it difficult to make out whether she really did realize that the deceased had been her father .
And write too , I shouldn ’ t wonder ? ’ ‘ Yes , ma ’ am , ’ said the child , fearful of giving new offence by the confession .
After a careful consideration of these , and an elaborate estimate of his resources , he had come to the conclusion to select that sum which represented the amount with compound interest to two years , fifteen calendar months , and fourteen days , from that date .
<NAME> bowed and stepped forward .
I might have known it from what I have seen of your strength of character .
Now do they note down , in the watches of the night , how the neighbourhood of <NAME> was yesterday , at about midnight , thrown into a state of the most intense agitation and excitement by the following alarming and horrible discovery .
‘ Yes , sir , ’ returned <NAME> ; ‘ but <NAME> has come back , and he begs the favour of a word. ’ As he held the door open with his hand , <NAME> looked at me , and looked at <NAME> , and looked at the dishes , and looked at the plates , and looked at

With a pitiful and plaintive look for her wayward sister ; for her idle brother ; for the high blank walls ; for the faded crowd they shut in ; for the games of the prison children as they whooped and ran , and played at hide-and-seek , and made the iron bars of the inner gateway ‘ Home. ’

But I am going down tomorrow morning to Mr Dombey , at <NAME> , and if <NAME> can entrust me with any commission , need I say how very happy I shall be ? ’ <NAME> immediately divining that <NAME> would desire to write a letter to her father , proposed to return , and besought Mr Carker to come

If you ever read this letter , <NAME> , I am likely to be dead .
The patient figures at work were swarthy with the filings of iron and steel that danced on every bench and bubbled up through every chink in the planking .
I had been afraid until then to say a word about the play .
Oliver murmured his comprehension of the different bodies referred to ; and <NAME> proceeded to load the pistol , with great nicety and deliberation .
I am so beset and hemmed in , that they are not only all struck with fear , but , like the beasts in the fable , have their fling at me now , though time was , and no longer ago than yesterday too , when they were all civility and compliance .
Thinks it long enough for <NAME> .
Finally , there was a parlour for guests to sit in and sup in , where a table was already laid , and where a blazing fire shone red and high .
Your mother-in-law may ha ’ been too much for me , or a thousand things may have happened by the time you next hears any news o ’ the celebrated <NAME> o ’ the <NAME> .

‘ It seemed at first as if it was only <NAME> that he objected to meet .
It ’ s a sensible and proper thing indeed , what Mrs <NAME> has said ! ’ exclaimed the old lady .
' I am not here by accident , ' he added after a lengthened silence ; 'nor have I heard all this to-night , for I knew it yesterday -- only yesterday .
But , then , the thought darted across his mind that it was barely eleven o'clock ; and that many people were still in the streets : of whom surely some might be found to give credence to his tale .
These young ladies -- not supposed to have been actually christened by the names applied to them , though always so called in the family from the places of their birth in barracks -- are respectively employed on three-legged stools , the younger ( some five or six years old ) in learning her letters out of a penny primer
‘ My dear girl ! ’ ‘ You frightened me. ’ ‘ Most unintentionally , but I am as sorry as if I had meant to do it .
At last , after much fruitless inquiry , <NAME> , followed by the coach and <NAME> , found a man who had once resided in that vanished land , and who was no other than the master sweep before referred to , grown stout , and knocking a double knock at his own door .

Two cognovits -- take care of them .
‘ She ought not to be alone here ; ought she , <NAME> ? ’ said <NAME> , anxiously .
‘ Very seasonable. ’ ‘ Seasonablest veather I ever see , sir , ’ rejoined <NAME> .
And they do say , <NAME> and <NAME> , ’ lowering his voice , ‘ that he ’ s taken a dislike to her , and that she ’ s left , unnoticed , among the servants , and that his mind ’ s so set all the while upon having his son in the <NAME> , that although he

This figure was the first to perceive that <NAME> was looking on ; upon which he winked to the <NAME> , and entreated him , with mock gravity , not to wake the gentleman .
<NAME> <NAME> with it !
The lady stepped lightly aside , and snatching the young man ’ s sword from his hand , before he had recovered his balance , drove him to the wall , and running it through him , and the panelling , up to the very hilt , pinned him there , hard and fast .
`` And it is a remarkable example of the confusion into which the present age has fallen ; of the obliteration of landmarks , the opening of floodgates , and the uprooting of distinctions , '' says <NAME> with stately gloom , `` that I have been informed by <NAME> that Mrs. Rouncewell 's son has been invited to go
‘ Oh , <NAME> , ’ says <NAME> , ‘ when I looked in to have a little lesson with the children just now , I got the message that you left for me ; and as soon as I could recover my spirits at all , I came on after you .
'That it wo n't do ; so it 's no use a-trying it on , <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> .
At length he went back again , and took the road which leads from <NAME> to <NAME> .
<NAME> nodded , and <NAME> the elder gave vent to an extraordinary sound , which , being neither a groan , nor a grunt , nor a gasp , nor a growl , seemed to partake in some degree of the character of all four .
You have too much feeling. ’ ‘ We have all our faults , ’ said <NAME> , weeping and shaking her head .
‘ You can ’ t be trusted for a moment .
And this was the first passage of <NAME> ’ s first love .
`` Well , sir , '' says <NAME> , `` this man with me is the other party implicated in this unfortunate affair -- nominally , only nominally -- and my sole object is to prevent his getting into trouble on my account .
All this , <NAME> , although himself somewhat of an impetuous gentleman : knowing his friend 's peculiarities , bore with great good humour ; as <NAME> , at tea , was graciously pleased to express his entire approval of the muffins , matters went on very smoothly ; and <NAME> , who made one of the party , began
‘ I am sure I shall have a good one in that case. ’ To see how Miss Squeers tossed her head , and the corn-factor flattened his nose , while this conversation was carrying on !
<NAME> Jarndyce I had perhaps less reason to be surprised than either of my companions , having never yet enjoyed an opportunity of thanking one who had been my benefactor and sole earthly dependence through so many years .
<NAME> at parting recapitulated to the old man all that she had said before , and bound him to their compact .
He has not a large business , but he is a very respectable man .
I had hoped , ’ said <NAME> , looking round with a mournful smile , ‘ to have seen you three gentlemen , one day or another , with your legs under the mahogany in my humble parlour in the <NAME> .
‘ Your object being only to see her again , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ you could effect it at any time you chose by that means. ’ Lord <NAME> acknowledged the hint with a great many squeezes of <NAME> ’ s hard , horny hand , and whispering that they would now do well to close the conversation ,
“ Not in season ! ” says I .
'Oh , you know , <NAME> , he must be mad , ' said Mrs. Sowerberry .
They left you , you say -- at those races , as I understand .

<NAME> <NAME> kissed her hand , retired to the window , and pulling out his pocket-handkerchief , had a mental wrestle with himself .
Oh deep , exhaustless , mighty well of love , in which so much was sunk !
'Not one little peep , miss ? '
Concurrently with this measure ( the description of which cost Mr Rugg innumerable wry faces and great uneasiness in his limbs ) , he would address a letter to all the creditors , exonerating his partner in a solemn manner , informing them of the stoppage of the <NAME> until their pleasure could be known and his partner communicated with
Mrs. Rouncewell confirms all this , not without personal pride , reserving only the one point of affability .
‘ <NAME> , ’ said the <NAME> , in persuasive accents .

‘ Well , <NAME> , ’ said Mrs. Crummles , who was seated there in full regal costume , with the phenomenon as the <NAME> in her maternal arms , ‘ next week for <NAME> , then for Winchester , then for -- ’ ‘ I have some reason to fear , ’ interrupted <NAME> , ‘ that before you
We have done all that -- we know the worst of it ; we have got to the bottom , we can ’ t fall , and what have we found ?
Well , supposing <NAME> is one of them ? ” “ Why then , ” said the turnkey , grinning again , “ he knows what <NAME> is. ” “ Yah ! ” cried <NAME> , suddenly hitting out at the turnkey in a facetious way , “ you 're dumb as one of your own keys when you have
'Perhaps I am , ' replied <NAME> ; ' I should think you was rather out of sorts too , unless you mean as little harm when you throw pewter pots about , as you do when you blab and -- ' 'Are you mad ? '
He smoked his pipe as we went along , and sometimes stopped to clap me on the shoulder .
I mustn ’ t be put upon , as a numble person , too much .
As to <NAME> and me , whom he had wrapped up with great care , the night being sharp and frosty , we trembled from head to foot .
It being a cold night , the <NAME> wore his hat , as , indeed , was often his custom within doors .
He gently places her with her back to the crashing engine that constantly whirrs up and falls , and she looks into his face and thanks him .
<NAME> <NAME> had hooked him in the coat collar with the handle of his umbrella , and was hanging on at the other end with all his might and main .
As she started up , and they all three looked at one another , it became a noise of clamouring voices and of the stir of feet ; then all the windows were heard to be hastily thrown up , and shouts and cries came floating into the house from the river .
`` The dearest friend I have ! ''
`` Well , sir , '' says <NAME> , holding his hat at the side of his head in his deference towards his best customer , `` I was wishful to say a word to you , sir . ''
It was very sad to look upon and hear them , happy though their condition unquestionably was ; and I saw that one blind girl , who ( being for the time deprived of the use of her limbs , by illness ) sat close beside me with her face towards them , wept silently the while she listened .
‘ The only question is , whether the gentleman , being on the ground , must not be considered , as a matter of form , to be the individual who insulted our friend , <NAME> , yesterday evening , whether he is really that individual or not ; ’ and having delivered this suggestion , with a very sage
in quick reply to a gesture of dissent from the housekeeper .
‘ My dear Kate , if you will allow me to speak , ’ said Mrs. Nickleby , ‘ I shall take the liberty of explaining to this lady -- ’ ‘ I think it is almost unnecessary , mama. ’ And notwithstanding all the frowns and winks with which Mrs. <NAME> intimated that she was going to say something
‘ The great petition that I make to you ( there is another which grows out of it ) , the great supplication that I address to your merciful and gentle heart , is , that you will not disclose this to <NAME> until I am dead .
‘ Come in , ’ said <NAME> .
However , if he won ’ t lead , I can ’ t follow .
‘ That ’ s injury enough. ’ ‘ I wish I could undo it , James. ’ ‘ I wish you could and would. ’ During this conversation , <NAME> had looked from one brother to the other , with pain and amazement .
Besides , that lonely girl with the dark hair runs in my head .
A bran-new <NAME> , redolent of fresh mortar and size , and fronting nothing at all , had taken for its sign The <NAME> ; but that might be rash enterprise -- and then it hoped to sell drink to the workmen .
Have I bought and sold with you , and helped you in my way of business , schoolboy , sneak , and what not , and do you tell me to go along ?
`` Now , <NAME> , '' he began , `` the word I have to say relates to <NAME> . ''
how to know the charm in its beginning !
When I had gone down-stairs , I turned back that I might be a little bit more company to him yet , and looked in at the door , and said , “ Father dear , shall I take <NAME> ? ” <NAME> shook his head and said , “ No , <NAME> , no ; take nothing that ’
“ Us two being now alone , ” resumed <NAME> , “ and me having the intentions and abilities to stay not many minutes more , I will now conclude -- leastways begin -- to mention what have led to my having had the present honor .
Show me some way through the world -- some humble path that I may take alone , and labour in , and sometimes think of you as one who will protect and care for me as for a sister !
There was a good fire in the room , and a breathless smell of warm black crape -- I did not know what the smell was then , but I know now .
Do you remember one night when I came with <NAME> to your lodging in <NAME> ?
‘ That night I almost gave up my mystery , though I suspected no one , could offer no information , knew absolutely nothing save that the murdered man was not I , but <NAME> .
The cat expands her wicked mouth and snarls at him .
I am sure it does no good .
Gentlemen , we ’ ve port , sherry , cigars , and most excellent champagne .
I ’ m quick to take this fright , I know , and my head is summ ’ at light with wearying and watching. ’ ‘ There , there , there ! ’ returned <NAME> .
I had never known before how short life really was and into how small a space the mind could put it .
But bring him here , upon this crowded deck .
There was a guard in the hut , and they challenged , and the sergeant answered .
But the turnpike-man gave him a meal of bread and cheese ; and the old lady , who had a shipwrecked grandson wandering barefoot in some distant part of the earth , took pity upon the poor orphan , and gave him what little she could afford -- and more -- with such kind and gentle words , and such
The rest of the <NAME> property being left to <NAME> ’ s father , I could at any time , without unsettling more than the two sums , have made a pretence of finding it .
But I expect a judgment .
‘ Do stop all night ! ’ ‘ I couldn ’ t indeed , <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> , who was almost dead from nausea and the closeness of the room .
`` No , I do n't say that it was so , mother , but that I made it out to be so .
Also how she had seen a countess and a lord some days before , and how the lord `` was much about as tall as <NAME> ; '' at which <NAME> pulled up his collars so high that you could n't have seen his head if you had been there .
But , does <NAME> feel still , as on the night when she knew that Mr Dombey would return to offer his alliance , that <NAME> knows her thoroughly , and reads her right , and that she is more degraded by his knowledge of her , than by aught else ?
‘ No , <NAME> ’ s-delight , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ I am not afeard .
‘ Ye-yes ; oh , yes , ’ replied <NAME> .
Two persons. ’ ‘ To be sure , they didn ’ t buy anything , ’ cried the boy .
Nor did she feel safe until she had set a mile or two of by-road between herself and the marketplace , and had crept into a copse , like a hunted animal , to hide and recover breath .
I would not lose her now , for all the treasures of the world .
It is she who should reproach ; not I .
Your sex have such a surprising animosity against one another when you do differ .
<NAME> <NAME> , aunt ; my friend <NAME> whom I have spoken to you about , regarding -- you know , aunt. ’ And here <NAME> , who was not at the moment extraordinarily sober , added the word ‘ <NAME> , ’ in what was meant to be a whisper , but which was an especially audible and distinct
After dinner , her son took his turn ; and when <NAME> , himself , and I were left alone together , leered at me , and writhed until I could hardly bear it .
so do I. I see it all afore me , upon my soul I do , <NAME> .
‘ Help your mother to get breakfast , <NAME> .
The candle was drawn back , and the face disappeared .
‘ No , not all of you , ’ said the strange man emphatically .
<NAME> ’ t suppose that I complain about that , because I always said to myself , “ It is very natural ; poor dear <NAME> is making his way in the world , and has a wife to tell his cares and troubles to , and children now to play about him , so God bless him and them
Well , ” returned <NAME> , going on again , and lifting off his hat to give his spikes free play , “ he 's a tradesman. ” “ What 's his goods , father ? ” asked the brisk Young <NAME> .
He stood for a moment at his own hall door , looking sedately at the elegant equipage as it rattled away .
There an ’ t another chap in the school but that boy as would have died exactly at the end of the quarter : taking it out of me to the very last , and then carrying his spite to the utmost extremity .
But as the Jew , looking back , waved his hand to intimate that he preferred being alone ; and , moreover , as the little man could not very easily disengage himself from the chair ; the sign of the <NAME> was , for a time , bereft of the advantage of <NAME> 's presence .
This was said in such a hearty tone , and the voice was so exactly what it should have been from such a speaker , and there was such a cordiality in the manner , that <NAME> was emboldened to speak again .
The idea ! ’ said Mrs. Nickleby , drawing herself up , ‘ niece to the <NAME> of Paving ! ’ ‘ Pray , mama , come away ! ’ whispered <NAME> .
‘ You appear to feel it so , ’ rejoined <NAME> , smiling at the clerk , who was literally red-hot .
Suddenly he stood still , and asked <NAME> point-blank if he knew where she was ?
But really , when I hear it remarked in several companies , and in very good company , that however worthy of a foreigner , it is not worthy of the spirit of an Englishman to remain in the <NAME> when the glorious liberties of his island home admit of his removal to the <NAME> , I thought I would
‘ Ha , ha ! ’ cried Mr Slum , ‘ you ’ re giving way , you ’ re coming down .
“ What do you mean ? ” said I , half suspecting him to be mad .
‘ It strikes you in the same light , ’ said <NAME> , with perfect calmness .
‘ Perhaps not , ’ said <NAME> ; ‘ and you bring me back to the question , with an apology for digressing .
My brother was a thoughtless , inconsiderate man , Mrs. Nickleby , and nobody , I am sure , can have better reason to feel that , than you. ’ This appeal set the widow upon thinking that perhaps she might have made a more successful venture with her one thousand pounds , and then she began to reflect what
That night I knew he had a false and thankless heart .
‘ As I ’ ve told you , <NAME> , I ’ ve the best of friends .
`` Do n't scold the old lady .
The lamps looked pale , and shook as if they were cold .

Her tears sprung forth beneath it , as she sunk upon her knees , and laid her aching head and streaming hair upon the pillow by its side .
The old lime-tree walk was like green cloisters , the very shadows of the cherry-trees and apple-trees were heavy with fruit , the gooseberry-bushes were so laden that their branches arched and rested on the earth , the strawberries and raspberries grew in like profusion , and the peaches basked by the hundred on the wall .
But first she searched her pocket and found that her money was all gone -- not a sixpence remained .

Six of those last-named little promissory notes , all due on the same day , <NAME> , and all intrusted to me ! ’ ‘ It ’ s very gratifying , isn ’ t it ? ’ said <NAME> , holding his plate for some more minced veal .
But anything like the utter dreariness and desolation that met my eyes when I literally ‘ tumbled up ’ on deck at noon , I never saw .
‘ I wished you to see the <NAME> for yourself , <NAME> , that you might judge whether I ’ m a liar ; and now I ’ ll see <NAME> ’ s window for myself , that we may know whether he ’ s at home. ’ With that , he crept away .
‘ How his ideas flow , don ’ t they ? ’ ‘ Wonderful , ’ replied <NAME> ; ‘ they comes a-pouring out , knocking each other ’ s heads so fast , that they seems to stun one another ; you hardly know what he ’ s arter , do you ? ’ That ’ s the great

The lawn , the soft , smooth slope , the flower-garden , the clumps of trees where graceful forms of ash and willow are not wanting , the conservatory , the rustic verandah with sweet-smelling creeping plants entwined about the pillars , the simple exterior of the house , the well-ordered offices , though all upon the diminutive scale proper

Looking round , he beholds the young man of the name of <NAME> , much discomfited and not presenting a very impressive letter of introduction in his manner and appearance .
<NAME> has lighted his lantern , by drawing from the cold , hard wall a spark of that mysterious fire which lurks in everything , and , guided by this speck , they clamber up among the cobwebs and the dust .

<NAME> <NAME> turns up the gas and coughs behind his hand , modestly anticipating profit .
<NAME> as the picture was , its very flatness and extent , which left nothing to the imagination , tamed it down and cramped its interest .

I am in a counting-house , and looking about me. ” “ Is a counting-house profitable ? ” I asked .
The last I saw of him , his head was bent over his knee and he was working hard at his fetter , muttering impatient imprecations at it and at his leg .
Everything of father ’ s had gone wrong that night , and he hadn ’ t pleased the public at all .
‘ Stay here of course , ’ the child had said in answer to my question , ‘ I always do ! ’ What could take him from home by night , and every night !
As if her life were an enchanted vision , there arose out of her solitude ministering thoughts , that made it fanciful and unreal .
I recalled , too , that the one-eyed gentleman had shuffled forth against the wall when I was the innocent cause of his being turned out .

The weather was warm , and the people were sitting at their doors , or strolling in their little gardens as he passed , enjoying the serenity of the evening , and their rest from labour .
‘ If you are quite determined , come ! ’ But she had to take her farewell of the male part of the company yet , and every one of them had to unfold his arms ( for they all assumed the professional attitude when they found themselves near <NAME> ) , and give her a parting kiss—Master <NAME> excepted
At last I done it .

Then they fell to work upon the supper in earnest ; and there was <NAME> , that foolish <NAME> , declaring that she could not eat more than two , and wanting more pressing than you would believe before she would eat four : though her mother and <NAME> ’ s mother made up for it pretty well , and
Some time elapses in the present instance before the old gentleman is sufficiently cool to resume his discourse , and even then he mixes it up with several edifying expletives addressed to the unconscious partner of his bosom , who holds communication with nothing on earth but the trivets .
They sat wondering , in silence ; or , if they exchanged a few words , spoke in whispers , as if they were afraid to hear the sound of their own voices .
But the horses is off .
As I trusted that I might have sufficient influence with <NAME> to prevent her taking any very rash step if I fully accepted the confidence she was so willing to place in me , poor girl , I proposed that she and I and <NAME> should go to the academy and afterwards meet my guardian and <NAME> at <NAME> 's
I got away from him , without knowing how I did it , and mended the fire in the room where we had been together , and sat down by it , afraid to go to bed .
The consequence was , that <NAME> had the double mortification of being an indispensable part of the circle when <NAME> and his friends were there , and of being exposed , on that very account , to all Mrs. Wititterly ’ s ill-humours and caprices when they were gone .
I wish her to know , and perhaps you will tell her ? ’ ‘ Do you think , at your sister ’ s age -- ’ hinted <NAME> .

‘ When I was last here , ’ I faltered , ‘ Miss <NAME> told me he was sailing here and there .
Changed as he is , and inexpressibly blest and thankful as I always am to know it , the old sorrowful feeling of compassion comes upon me sometimes with such strength that I want to put my arms round his neck , tell him how I love him , and cry a little on his breast .
It is more than probable , I think , that the gentleman may not relish my company ; and although I am the dusty figure you see , I am too proud to thrust myself into his. ’ ‘ Lord love you , ’ said the landlord , ‘ it ’ s only <NAME> ; HE isn ’ t particular.
‘ Well then , the way was this .
Nor did he ever again face the doughty Mrs Pipchin , under <NAME> ’ s roof .

People turned round and looked at him ; he made no gesture , caught nobody ’ s eye , let them pass away , and others come on and be succeeded by others , and took no notice .
<NAME> ( who , if he had ever been an object of interest in his life , had been one that day ) accompanied them , joining sometimes one group and sometimes the other , as brother <NAME> , laying his hand upon his shoulder , bade him walk with him , or <NAME> , looking smilingly round , beckoned

You have been drawing pretty freely here ; your name occurs pretty often in <NAME> 's cash-book ; but you are in debt , of course ? ” “ I am afraid I must say yes , sir. ” “ You know you must say yes ; do n't you ? ” said <NAME> .
Now , <NAME> , ” -- <NAME> looked firmly at me as if he knew I was not going to agree with him ; -- “ your sister is a fine figure of a woman. ” I could not help looking at the fire , in an obvious state of doubt .

You may have heard some account of her ? ’ ‘ I think I have , ’ he answered , ‘ if her name was Higden. ’ ‘ Her name was <NAME> .

<NAME> <NAME> ! ’ So saying , he nodded in a friendly manner , and took his leave : stopping when he had passed the outer door a little distance , and grinning with extraordinary delight .
<NAME> ’ t be cast down. ’ The face looked up at him imploringly , as he rose from wiping it , and gently replaced the coat that covered the writhing figure .
Doors were slamming violently , lamps were flickering or blown out , signs were rocking in their frames , the water of the kennels , wind-dispersed , flew about in drops like rain .
‘ Anybody who didn ’ t know you as well as I do , my dear fellow , would say you were an accomplished courtier , ’ said <NAME> .
Such a precious loud hymn , <NAME> , while the tea was a brewing ; such a grace , such eatin ’ and drinkin ’ !
<NAME> <NAME> made at the door .
<NAME> over that there bottle ! ’ Here Mr <NAME> appeared to labour under a virtuous delusion that it was his own property .
‘ Oh , how good of you !
You are so very violent , that really I -- ' At this instant , Mrs. <NAME> stepped hastily forward to replace the carpet , which had been kicked up in the scuffle .
‘ And who , ’ said <NAME> , shuffling among his papers , ‘ who is the lodger ’ s visitor -- not a lady visitor , I hope , eh , Mr <NAME> ?
‘ I was going there , ’ said the surly man .
`` I always give too much to ladies .
I am going to take out the licence .
I will try , then , to forgive him his share of blame .
Five of 'em strung up in a row , and none left to play booty , or turn white-livered ! '
‘ She ’ s very fond of you , <NAME> , though not so fond as I am .
He had been known in <NAME> as <NAME> .
I tell you that the time was , when I loved him better than you ever did ! ’ She stood with her bright angry eyes confronting the wide stare , and the set face ; and softened no more , when the moaning was repeated , than if the face had been a picture .
The men obeyed , and the two were left alone together .
‘ On the voyage , I shall endeavour , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ occasionally to spin them a yarn ; and the melody of my son <NAME> will , I trust , be acceptable at the galley-fire .
‘ Twenty pounds per annewum , I believe , Mr Squeers ? ’ ‘ Guineas , ’ rejoined the schoolmaster , with a persuasive smile .
Was he coward enough to watch her , an hour afterwards , on the old well staircase , where he had once seen <NAME> in the moonlight , toiling up with <NAME> ?
At last , when we had passed a couple of hours or so , very agreeably , he suddenly took up his hat , and leaning over the table and looking me full in the face , said , in a low voice : “ <NAME> , <NAME> , we ’ ve been vara pleasant toogather , and ar ’
Never let me hear him mentioned as a brother more ! ’ ‘ Dear <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , when they were left alone , and had remained silent for some few moments .
‘ I have almost forgotten that there is anything to do in the world but to go out tossing on the sea here .
`` If you think so , guardian , it is right . ''
It seemed to her that she awoke after sleeping some hours , and found <NAME> not yet abed .
Have you , though ? ’ returned <NAME> , his eyes sparkling with delight .
He could have laid hands upon himself for his cowardice , but it was the very shadow of his defeat , and could not be separated from it .
But the dead-and-gone Dedlocks take it very calmly and have never been known to object .
‘ God bless her ! ’ said my aunt , ‘ and her husband too ! ’ I echoed it , parted from my aunt , and went lightly downstairs , mounted , and rode away .
Let this be a warning to all young ladies to be particular in the character of the gentlemen of their choice .
I nevermore will see or think o ’ anything that angers me , but thou , so much better than me , shalt be by th ’ side on ’ t .
‘ If any drop of gloom were wanting in the overflowing cup , which is now “ commended ” ( in the language of an immortal Writer ) to the lips of the undersigned , it would be found in the fact , that a friendly acceptance granted to the undersigned , by the before-mentioned <NAME> , for the sum
'You would serve me best , lady , ' replied the girl , wringing her hands , 'if you could take my life at once ; for I have felt more grief to think of what I am , to-night , than I ever did before , and it would be something not to die in the hell in which
“ As pleasantly as I could anywhere , away from you. ” “ You silly boy , ” said <NAME> , quite composedly , “ how can you talk such nonsense ?
She won ’ t come in MY way , he says .
‘ And she has been. ’ ‘ Well , sir , there were violent quarrels at first , I assure you , ’ said <NAME> ; ‘ but she is quite a shadow now .
Everybody having eaten everything , the table was cleared in a most alarming hurry , and with great noise ; and the spirits , whereat the eyes of <NAME> glistened , being arranged in order , with water both hot and cold , the party composed themselves for conviviality ; <NAME> being stationed in a large armchair by the fireside
Where would you wish it taken from ? ’ she answered , turning to him with the same enforced attention as before .
Mrs. <NAME> was unanimously voted into the chair , and Mrs. Rogers being stationed on her right hand , and Mrs. Raddle on her left , the meal proceeded with great merriment and success .
It is still Monday night. ” “ Thank God ! ” “ And you have all to-morrow , Tuesday , to rest in , ” said <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> on his legs again .
<NAME> <NAME> had previously volunteered to go home with us and had withdrawn to dress himself for the purpose .
‘ Mr Merdle , this is -- ha -- indeed an honour .
Catching up the light , they made the best of their way home , at a good round trot ; and long after their dusky forms had ceased to be discernible , the light might have been seen twinkling and dancing in the distance , like some exhalation of the damp and gloomy atmosphere through which it was swiftly borne
But , he never mentioned her as a woman .
‘ They are very like their mamma , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , majestically .
He had turned the course of what he said at that instant , and she remained .
My sister would have let him tear her to pieces , before she would have let him believe that he could make her shed a tear. ’ <NAME> reviewed those mental notes of his , and was neither at all surprised to hear it , nor at all disposed to question it .
If any bagman of that day could have caught sight of the little neck-or-nothing sort of gig , with a clay-coloured body and red wheels , and the vixenish , ill tempered , fast- going bay mare , that looked like a cross between a butcher ’ s horse and a twopenny post-office pony , he would have known at
Still the <NAME> pointed downward to the grave by which it stood .
' I hope the gentleman will understand that it is n't my fault , sir ? '
‘ <NAME> ’ t fear me being any hindrance to you , I have no more to say , ma ’ am , ’ he remarked , as he moved towards the door .
Then , why don ’ t they improve it , ma ’ am !
All day long , little <NAME> has cried for her , and asked me , over and over again , whether <NAME> ’ ly was wicked ?
‘ This is the hardest trial I have had .
There was something so very agreeable in being so intimate with such a waistcoat ; in being called <NAME> , in such an intimate way , by such a voice ; in being on such off-hand terms so soon , with such a pair of whiskers ; that <NAME> was uncommonly pleased with himself .
But if the dear fellow can ’ t live there , he can ’ t live there .
Now , you know , so very prepossessing in the lady with the veil ! ''
Some artists , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ keep a red coat , and charge seven-and-sixpence extra for hire and carmine ; but I don ’ t do that myself , for I don ’ t consider it legitimate. ’ Drawing herself up , as though she plumed herself greatly upon not resorting to these lures to catch sitters ,
I hope he didn ’ t catch cold , that dreadful night , Sir. ’ There was a momentary look of deep slyness in <NAME> Trotter ’ s eye , as he said this , which ran a thrill through <NAME> ’ s clenched fist , as he burned with a desire to make a demonstration on his ribs .
Yes. ’ ‘ Can you guess , ’ said <NAME> , folding her small hands tight in one another , and looking at him with all the earnestness of her soul looking steadily out of her eyes , ‘ what I am going to ask you not to do ? ’ ‘ I think I can .
I casually mentioned to <NAME> , when I had the pleasure of an interview with her the other day , ’ -- with another inclination of his body -- <NAME> again -- ‘ that there was a vacancy here .
I heard him say so . '
6 , in the court. ’ ‘ There is a double wallflower at <NAME> .
‘ I think it is a knock at the door , ’ said <NAME> , as if there could be the smallest doubt of the fact .
‘ Very ill , <NAME> , have I been ? ’ ‘ Dead , all but , ’ replied the small servant .
However , he left word that you were to make yourself comfortable till he came back , and that I was to entertain you , which I shall be very glad to do. ’ In proof of his extreme readiness to exert himself for the general entertainment , <NAME> drew a chair to the table as he spoke , and
`` My dear , '' said I , `` as long as you wo n't hear me out -- '' `` I do n't want to hear you out . ''
You could as soon take up and shoulder an eight and forty pounder by your own strength as turn that man when he has got a thing into his head and fixed it there .
He dotes upon the children to the last and remembers the commission he has undertaken for an absent friend .
What does she try to do ?
‘ Do you see where we are ? ’ ‘ Yes , my love .
It was a happy time .
<NAME> left it with the landlady , and was returning to pull his master ’ s boots off , after drying himself by the kitchen fire , when glancing casually through a half-opened door , he was arrested by the sight of a gentleman with a sandy head who had a large bundle of newspapers lying on the table before
He never smoked so late , and it seemed to hint to me that he wanted comforting , for some reason or other .
Nothing disagreeable should ever be looked at .
<NAME> , ’ said I , bolting it out with some difficulty .
Stunned as I was , as weak and helpless at first as I had ever been in my sick chamber , the necessity of guarding against the danger of discovery , or even of the remotest suspicion , did me service .
“ <NAME> , ” he answered , in the same tone ; “ chrisen 'd Abel. ” “ What were you brought up to be ? ” “ A warmint , dear boy. ” He answered quite seriously , and used the word as if it denoted some profession .
She only said , ‘ Oh , dear , dear <NAME> !
Mr <NAME> ’ s face was not a changeful one , and being cast in its mould of state that day , showed little other apprehension of the story , if any , than that which he expressed when he said solemnly , amidst the silence , that it was ‘ Very good. ’ There was a rapid glance from
<NAME> , evermore. ’ This , blotted with tears , was the letter .
It is said that on the occasion of a visit from <NAME> or <NAME> to this town ( I forget which , but it is not to the purpose ) , he walked through three miles and a half of these young ladies all dressed out with parasols and silk stockings .
<NAME> here , <NAME> , <NAME> .
<NAME> ’ t you injured me enough already ? ’ ‘ I have never injured you , <NAME> , wilfully. ’ ‘ You are my brother , ’ said the Manager .
I never doubted until within this hour or two , that he had , or could have such a paper .
I have cast up the years of her age , year after year .

Softened regrets they might be , teaching me what I had failed to learn when my younger life was all before me , but not the less regrets .
'Do you mean to say anything , you young shaver ? '
Will you tell them to send him up ? ''
Only come to see me as if you come by chance alonger <NAME> .
There was poison in the house .
But that is not the subject on which I wish to speak with you. ’ ‘ Oh ! ’ said <NAME> .
His mind was evidently wandering to his old life , for he continued to mutter , without appearing conscious of their presence otherwise than as a part of his vision .
This did not serve him ; for , at such bantering or retort as suited the company , he was no match for <NAME> .
‘ <NAME> , ’ said Mr Boffin , blowing out the light in the lantern , shutting it up , and stowing it away in the breast of his coat as before .
I could n't be worse off if I was a what's-his-name -- man and a brother ! ''
You quite understand that the young lady do n't ride to-day , and that I dine at the young lady 's ? ” “ Quite so , sir ! ” When the waiter had felt my fast-cooling teapot with the palm of his hand , and had looked imploringly at me , and had gone out , <NAME> , careful
No , do n't ring -- I have been brought up in a sharp school and am accustomed to a variety of general practice .
I appeal to you , sir , ’ proceeded <NAME> with increasing spirit , ‘ not to pursue me .
When she came there of an evening , she always shrunk from accepting his escort home , and ran away with me instead .
‘ There ’ s Em ’ ly ’ s cousin , him that she was to have been married to , ’ said <NAME> , rubbing his hands feebly , ‘ as fine a fellow as there is in <NAME> !
The stone on which he had first seen the goblin seated , stood bolt upright before him , and the grave at which he had worked , the night before , was not far off .
But , although this happy change had a visible effect on the little circle ; and although cheerful voices and merry laughter were once more heard in the cottage ; there was at times , an unwonted restraint upon some there : even upon Rose herself : which <NAME> could not fail to remark .
The honour is reciprocal , sir , as I usually say when I dramatise a book .
Make your own arrangements. ’ ‘ Why , I was thinking that this evening would be a good time , <NAME> , when they are all sitting round the fire .
The town , which was sluggish and uninteresting enough , was something like the back of an <NAME> watering-place , out of the season .
‘ I have not heard it myself , not being in the way of such things , but I have been told it ’ s even printed -- for private circulation -- but that ’ s all over town , of course. ’ ‘ It ’ s a lie ! ’ said <NAME> ; ‘ I tell you it ’
An errand of generosity brought him here unknown to us ; he was stopped at the barrier , and sent to prison. ” The old man uttered an irrepressible cry .
He was a very easy , pleasant fellow indeed , and his manners were exceedingly winning .
<NAME> in the helpless state that you see me in , is naturally anxious .
The name has quite escaped me .
A substitute for a Fire .
And slily he traileth along the ground , And his leaves he gently waves , As he joyously hugs and crawleth round The rich mould of dead men ’ s graves .
But this latter <NAME> object ( in short sleeves ) always appeared to be the great inoffensive aim of her existence .
‘ Dear Nicholas , ’ whispered <NAME> , who had been looking anxiously over his shoulder , ‘ can this be really the case ?
Your aunt is an old lady , <NAME> , and it ’ s what you must have looked for , often. ’ This consolatory farewell , <NAME> accompanied with a look of heartfelt anguish ; and being left alone with the two children again , and becoming conscious that the wind was blowing mournfully , she indulged in melancholy --
‘ Besides you , I mean , <NAME> , ’ returned the craven <NAME> .
‘ I shall make him fetch and carry , my dear , and I shall make him subject to me .
When shall we look upon his like again ?
demanded <NAME> , pouring question upon question with great volubility .
‘ Hallo ! ’ said <NAME> , ‘ who is that ? ’ ‘ He called to see my Governor this morning , ’ replied Mr Chuckster ; ‘ beyond that , I don ’ t know him from Adam. ’ ‘ At least you know his name ? ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> , who had by this time no breath of his own to spare , hurried along without asking any more questions ; and they soon , in their impatience , burst in at a little door and came into a clean parlour full of children .
And let me linger in this place , for an instant , to remark that if ever household affections and loves are graceful things , they are graceful in the poor .
I have none to spare myself , having to attend court very soon .
Thus it was that between seven and eight o ’ clock one evening , he and <NAME> found themselves in the <NAME> ’ s Head booking-office , securing a place to <NAME> Bridge by the next morning ’ s coach .
“ Where have you been , you young monkey ? ” said Mrs. <NAME> , stamping her foot .
asked <NAME> , adding , as <NAME> nodded assent , 'What name shall I tell my good friend . '
I should say that was worth full twenty pound at the next assizes , without the honesty , sir. ’ ‘ ’ Soizes , ’ cried <NAME> , ‘ thou ’ d betther not talk to me o ’ ‘ Soizes .
It ’ s very comfortable , thank you. ’ ‘ I have the pleasure of knowing Mr Dombey , ’ observed <NAME> .
But I might -- I might -- if this silly business were not completely relinquished altogether , be induced in some anxious moment to guard her from , and surround her with protections against , the consequences of any foolish step in the way of marriage .
And so we live on <NAME> , in the charm -- ingest of dolls ’ houses , de -- lightfully furnished , and we have a clever little servant who is de -- cidedly pretty , and we are economical and orderly , and do everything by clockwork , and we have a hundred and fifty pounds a year ,
The objects he had lately pursued , turned worthless beside her ; such success as was almost in his grasp , he flung away from him like the dirt it was , compared with her .
`` Better now , '' quoth <NAME> , motioning the lawyer to sit down and read to him alone .
<NAME> <NAME> 's thoughts take such form as he looks at her , with his ragged grey eyebrows a hair 's breadth more contracted than usual under her gaze .
' I am nobody ; do n't consult me , pray .
‘ What , haven ’ t you seen her lately ? ’ said <NAME> .
I only want you to do well , and to be comfortable. ” “ Well , then , understand once for all that I never shall or can be comfortable -- or anything but miserable -- there , <NAME> ! -- unless I can lead a very different sort of life from the life I lead now. ” “ That
My guardian had made up his mind not to lose sight of me until I was safe in <NAME> 's house , so he accompanied us , and we were two days upon the road .
They were all three more sharply on the alert , and less deadened by the miserable influences of the place and time .
No crowd was about the door ; no people were discernible at any of the many windows ; not even a chance passerby was in the street .
The same great manufacturer , always with an immense variety of work on hand , in every stage of development , passed <NAME> onward in his mill , and worked her up into a very pretty article indeed .
‘ You might ha ’ made a worser guess than that , old feller , ’ replied <NAME> the younger , setting down his burden in the yard , and sitting himself down upon it afterwards .
This going away was perhaps the very first action of their joint lives that they had got through without her .
He sat down beside me , taking some pains to sit on the form , I thought , in imitation of the print of his illustrious model on the sofa .
The morning hurry and flutter had been great ; for , long and anxiously as I had waited for <NAME> , his hint had come like a surprise at last .
Mrs <NAME> ’ s back being then towards him , the military gentleman shook his forefinger as a sign that her myrmidons were not to apprise her of his presence , and stealing up close behind her , tapped her on the neck , and cried playfully ‘ Boh ! ’ ‘ What , Mr Slum ! ’ cried the
This is too hospitable and free. ’ By a great exertion of strength , he closed the two old gates , which were deeply sunken in the mud , and barred them with a heavy beam .
A sad and desolate place it was , a gloomy , sorrowful place that gave me a strange sensation of mournfulness and even dread .
I don ’ t want him any longer .
I brought him on purpose for you .
‘ My secretary would have to make himself master of the foreign policy of the world , as it is mirrored in the newspapers ; to run his eye over all accounts of public meetings , all leading articles , and accounts of the proceedings of public bodies ; and to make notes of anything which it appeared to him
When he grew tall enough to peep through the keyhole of the great lock of the main door , he had divers times set down his father ’ s dinner , or supper , to get on as it might on the outer side thereof , while he stood taking cold in one eye by dint of peeping at her
`` What was your remark , my dear friend ? ''
For the first time he felt that in that sharp fire , he had slowly forged the iron which could break the prison door of his daughter 's husband , and deliver him .
She will be glad to see you , if you will permit me to let her know that you are here. ’ ‘ By all means , ’ returned <NAME> .
`` Well , sir , '' says <NAME> .
At the top of the table , seated in an arm-chair rather higher than the rest , was a particularly fat gentleman with a very round , red face .
I can not bear it , ’ said <NAME> , at once with a burst of tears , and a stamp of her little foot ; ‘ I shudder with horror of him , and I have come to you to protect me and all of us from him , if you will ? ’ ‘ I will , ’
<NAME> occasioned the inexhaustible baby to square at him with the speckled fists , and demand in a threatening manner what he meant ?
' I 'll answer for that boy 's truth with my life ! '
‘ Exactly so , <NAME> , ’ said Mr Toots , whose fervour of acquiescence was greatly heightened by his entire ignorance of the <NAME> ’ s meaning .
‘ Why , you see , ’ said Mr Perch , first turning round to shut the door carefully , ‘ she takes what has happened in our <NAME> so much to heart , <NAME> .
Meanwhile <NAME> and <NAME> walk to and fro , quietly talking together .
He paused at the next door in the passage , and tapped gently thereat .
There was an innocent piece of dinner-furniture that went upon easy castors and was kept over a livery stable-yard in <NAME> , <NAME> ’ s , when not in use , to whom the <NAME> were a source of blind confusion .
‘ And a little bit o ’ cold beef , ’ said the second coachman .
‘ No , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ I ain ’ t .
This had better be the end of it .
I had come and gone twice , and was again sitting by her , when she began to falter .
Do you make that of it ? ” <NAME> answered , “ Those are not the exact words. ” “ Not the exact words ! ” repeated the gentleman bitterly .
Such a mind has Mr <NAME> , whom <NAME> finds contemplating Tippins with the moodiest of visages , while that playful creature rallies him on being so long overdue at the woolsack .
It was yet night when she awoke , nor did she know how long , or for how short a time , she had slept .
Her thinness seemed to be the effect of some wasting fire within her , which found a vent in her gaunt eyes .
No book , no work , no occupation of any kind but her own thought , beguiled the tardy time .
Though it has not yet finally disappeared , it is dwindling daily .
‘ We can do it in a fortnight. ’ ‘ No , I thank you .
cried Fagin , following him hastily .
You 're no trouble at all .
of course do you understand that for any other purpose he ’ s no man for me , nor for you ? ’ ‘ I have frequently said to <NAME> , sir , ’ returned <NAME> , ‘ that he was of no use at all in the business .
Of the remaining four , two , who grasped their foreheads convulsively , were engaged in solving mathematical problems ; one with his face like a dirty window , from much crying , was endeavouring to flounder through a hopeless number of lines before dinner ; and one sat looking at his task in stony stupefaction and despair -- which
‘ And is gone , I know not where. ’ ‘ He should ha ’ stopped and fought it out , <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> contemptuously .
‘ Thank you ! ’ He certainly never had seen this old woman before .
<NAME> , with an instinctive delicacy , forbore to urge the least obstacle , though she did not forbear to overpower him with thanks ; and Mr Toots proudly took the commission upon himself for immediate execution .
Some laughed ; some said , by way of complete excuse , that the post was virtually a sinecure , and any fool who could spell his name was good enough for it ; some , and these the more solemn political oracles , said that <NAME> did wisely to strengthen himself , and that the sole constitutional purpose of
‘ When I am found dead at the foot of the <NAME> , it will be by some of my own sort ; some of the working people who work among the lights yonder .
And I know I am so ; and I know she is overjoyed when she can bring it to my mind. ’ ‘ A good pretence ! ’ said <NAME> , with no less anger , haughtiness , and bitterness ; ‘ but too threadbare to cover what I plainly see in this .
There was not one touch of tenderness or pity in it .
‘ He has been to <NAME> fifty times , if he has been there once ; yet if he came to <NAME> to-morrow -- I wish he would , dear angel ! -- he would make his fifty-second visit next day. ’ ‘ We are all enthusiastic , are we not , <NAME> ? ’ said <NAME> , with a
Take it from your mother ?
Death of my life , sir , ’ returned the stranger , ‘ it ’ s my character to be impatient ! ’ The sound of <NAME> cautiously chaining the door before she opened it , caused them both to look that way .
This is him as I have seen brought up by hand .
We who were left walked on towards the house .
‘ I respect you , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> with emotion .
I see none like them in that place , but he is admitted to be superior to all the rest .
Now , if you stand there , refusing to give evidence , I 'll punish you for disrespect to the bench ; I will , by -- ' By what , or by whom , nobody knows , for the clerk and jailor coughed very loud , just at the right moment ; and the former dropped a heavy book
‘ You needn ’ t make yourself uncomfortable , ’ remarked his wife , laughing heartily .
‘ Let me , oh do let me .
Meanwhile you shall have a little taste of something that ’ ll do you good , for I ’ m sure you must want it after all you ’ ve gone through to-day .
Their pride in these girls , and their submission of themselves to all their whims , was the pleasantest little testimony to their own worth I could have desired to see .
Then <NAME> seeming to be seized with an industrious mania or fury , turned to at the mangle , and impelled it at the heads of the innocents with such a creaking and rumbling , that <NAME> stopped him .
<NAME> , <NAME> , it ’ s a large place ! ’ She shook her head , turned her delighted bright eyes up to mine , kissed me , broke into a merry laugh , and sprang away to put on <NAME> ’ s new collar .
WHEN <NAME> awoke , it was so dark , that looking out of bed , he could scarcely distinguish the transparent window from the opaque walls of his chamber .
‘ Can you go round when you get back , and tell <NAME> that you saw me safely off , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ It shall be done , Miss. ’ ‘ With my love , please , Joe. ’ ‘ Yes , Miss—and I wouldn ’ t mind having it myself ! ’ But <NAME> did not articulate the

Then to go back , you know , and find him in the same cramped place. ’ ‘ Ah yes !
Wants to keep it close and quiet , and to keep you out of the way. ’ They were still debating this point when a shadow darkened the entry , and the glass door was opened by a messenger who brought a letter unceremoniously addressed , ‘ Riah. ’ To which he said there was an answer wanted .
There , <NAME> , there ! ’ ‘ Well , ’ said <NAME> , rather sulkily , but giving the proffered hand a respectful shake at the same time -- ‘ well , so you ought to be , and I am very glad to find you air ; for , if I can help it , I won ’
‘ Not a bit , ’ returned the <NAME> , kissing his iron hand ; ‘ and afore I begin to be , my Hearts-delight , <NAME> ’ r will have wrote home from the island , or from some port or another , and made all taut and ship-shape. ’ And with regard to old <NAME> , here the
<NAME> let me take these bags from you .
‘ He ’ s very sorry for giving offence .
‘ <NAME> , my life , ’ said <NAME> , touching her cheek , with a grave smile , as she cast down her eyes and pouted again ; ‘ look at me .
I am better with Pa than any one -- more innocent , more sorry , more glad ! ’ So , crying out in a wild way that she could not bear this , <NAME> drooped her head on Mrs <NAME> ’ s ready breast .
‘ Do you know , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , cheerfully examining the dish , ‘ I think it is in consequence -- they are capital oysters , but I think it is in consequence -- of their never having been opened. ’ They never had been opened ; and we had no oyster-knives -- and couldn ’ t
With means at hand of building decent cabins , it was wonderful to see how clumsy , rough , and wretched , its hovels were .
It was his delight to help her , or to fancy that he did so , and they soon became close companions .
When the shop was closed , he took them out of his cap , hung his cap on the chair-back , and stood turning them over before the fire .
Of <NAME> , conflicting rumours went abroad .
<NAME> , I have heard from the woman who would have been my wife if I had lived , the revolting truth that I should have purchased her , caring nothing for me , as a <NAME> buys a slave .
You ’ ll hardly believe it , <NAME> , ’ said Mr Meagles , laughing within himself , ‘ but it came out that it would never do , because you and he , walking down to <NAME> together , had glided into a friendly conversation in the course of which he had referred to his intention of taking a
‘ Confound these fellows ! ’ thought <NAME> ; ‘ they have come to breakfast , I suppose .
<NAME> <NAME> allowed <NAME> to obey it , in silence .
I have a scheme to develop , little woman .
I have been offered and rejected , put up and appraised , until my very soul has sickened .
If I did think of it at odd moments now and then , I had only to be busy and forget it .
If you should have any reason for imposing conditions upon me , I will respect it without asking what it is. ’ ‘ You chanced to see me in the street with the man , ’ she observed , after being , to his mortification , evidently more occupied with her own reflections on the matter than with his appeal
It were the Poison-bottle on table .
‘ When the question was referred to <NAME> -- I needn ’ t name him , ’ said <NAME> , checking himself -- ‘ I understand , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ N. ’ <NAME> darkly nodded -- ‘ was referred to him , his answer was , “ Money , or no release. ” ’ ‘ Lord bless my
‘ Well , well ! ’ returned <NAME> , with a patient , even a submissive , air .
As she read on , years seemed to fall away from her son like the imaginings of a dream , and all the old dark horrors of his usual preparation for the sleep of an innocent child to overshadow him .
There were some trifles there -- poor useless things -- that she would have liked to take away ; but that was impossible .
Her father privately married again -- his cook , I rather think. ” “ I thought he was proud , ” said I .
I have shown you now , more plainly , that I do .

`` Why , I would n't pass another night there for any consideration that you could offer me , '' says <NAME> , haggardly staring .
I noticed the scantiest necessaries in the way of furniture ; a few old prints from books , of Chancellors and barristers , wafered against the wall ; and some half-dozen reticles and work-bags , `` containing documents , '' as she informed us .

In spite of her request , he could not help opening the packet that night when he went to bed .
<NAME> , for ever and ever .
“ I was much engaged that day , and could not complete my letter that night .
It would avail me nothing to extenuate it now .
Now , <NAME> bounced into the room with great impetuosity ; for , supposing her son-in-law to be still a-bed , she had come to relieve her feelings by pronouncing a strong opinion upon his general conduct and character .
If there had been time , I should probably have ordered several suits of clothes for this occasion ; but as there was not , I was fain to be content with those I had .
The ground was measured , some usual forms gone through , the two principals were placed front to front at the distance agreed upon , and <NAME> turned his face towards his young adversary for the first time .
`` Do you think he did it on purpose ? ''
The perpetual tramp of boot-heels on the decks gave place to a heavy silence , and the whole human freight was stowed away below , excepting a very few stragglers , like myself , who were probably , like me , afraid to go there .
Rather a light purse , ’ added <NAME> , throwing it into the air and catching it dexterously , ‘ but enough to amuse a gentleman for half an hour or so. ’ ‘ We ’ ll make a four-handed game of it , and take in <NAME> , ’ said the stout man .
<NAME> ’ s people , ’ said a thin , miserable-looking old woman , stopping to recover breath after the ascent of the staircase -- ‘ Mr .
Not even my friends here -- ’ ‘ Except on one occasion , ’ said <NAME> .
If I have known <NAME> a year , to move to as he went by , I have known him forty years .
The unaccustomed visitor from outside , naturally assumed everybody here to be prisoners -- landlord , waiter , barmaid , potboy , and all .
<NAME> walked in , taking her sister with her ; and they went up-stairs with powder going before and powder stopping behind , and were left in a spacious semicircular drawing-room , one of several drawing-rooms , where there was a parrot on the outside of a golden cage holding on by its beak , with its scaly legs in
I said to <NAME> that this was very true , and who should know it better than I , who loved <NAME> with a love that never mortal had experienced yet ?
<NAME> is the difference between yesterday and today .
When they stopped , he was a little surprised to find himself in the act of smoking ; but , on reflection , he remembered when and where he had taken the cigar .
'Which contained -- ' interposed Monks , stretching forward .
I sat looking at <NAME> for some time , in a reverie on this supposititious case : whether , if she were employed to lose me like the boy in the fairy tale , I should be able to track my way home again by the buttons she would shed .
‘ It ’ s quite another matter in the case of a man like me .
A mutual understanding follows , and I think it may carry us through .
On being asked by a mild boy ( not me ) how he would proceed if he did begin to see him do it , he dipped a match into his phosphorus-box on purpose to shed a glare over his reply , and said he would commence by knocking him down with a blow on the forehead from the seven-and-sixpenny
‘ It was the fright of that -- that noise and confusion last night , ’ said <NAME> .
<NAME> , and repent of it .
I didn ’ t think you would ; and I want , more than ever , to be liked , now <NAME> is gone. ’ I have omitted to mention it , by the by .
But he shuts out the now chilled air , draws the window-curtain , goes to bed , and falls asleep .
‘ So she is , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ so she is .
‘ I will wait , if you please , for I want to speak to her. ’ ‘ Do you ? ’ returned <NAME> .
We thought it a pity he should go away .
‘ Yes , to state , ’ said the little man , ‘ I thank my honourable friend , if he will allow me to call him so ( four hears and one certainly from <NAME> ) , for the suggestion .
`` Ha ' n't you no relations , now , '' asks <NAME> with a twinkle in his eyes , `` who would pay off this little principal or who would lend you a good name or two that I could persuade my friend in the city to make you a further advance upon ?
‘ No , thank you ! ’ said <NAME> , coldly , as I mechanically offered them back to him .
`` What do you say , <NAME> ? ''
They moved so gently , that their footsteps made no noise ; but there were sobs from among the group , and sounds of grief and mourning .
‘ I have come here in consequence of receiving this bit of paper , ’ rejoined <NAME> .
It would be better for me , they tell me , if I restrained myself .
'There 's always more or less orange-peel on the pavement in our street ; and I _know_ it 's put there by the surgeon 's boy at the corner .
It ’ s a wery strange thing now , where this here letter can ha ’ come from. ’ As <NAME> said this , he did what a great many people do when they are uncertain about the writer of a note -- looked at the seal , and then at the front , and then at the back ,
Thoroughly tired , I went to bed too , at midnight ; passed the next day on the Dover coach ; burst safe and sound into my aunt ’ s old parlour while she was at tea ( she wore spectacles now ) ; and was received by her , and <NAME> , and dear old Peggotty , who acted
<NAME> , <NAME> tells me -- ’ ‘ Stay , mother !
In his college days of athletic exercises , <NAME> had known professors of the <NAME> of fisticuffs , and had attended two or three of their gloved gatherings .
Oliver knew this too well ; but thinking it might be dangerous to express his feelings more openly , he only sighed , and went on with his boot-cleaning .
But she had scarcely entered , when another woman , similarly laden , came in too ; and she was closely followed by a man in faded black , who was no less startled by the sight of them , than they had been upon the recognition of each other .
They were , and they are , quite ignorant of our history. ’ ‘ So much the worse , ’ retorted <NAME> , determined not to admit anything in extenuation , ‘ for then you have no excuse .
'Yes , sir , ' replied <NAME> , in a low , tremulous voice .
A dry subject for a young lady , but an important subject too .
‘ I am a demd villain ! ’ cried <NAME> , smiting himself on the head .
When I came here today , I thought that nothing could have wrested this confession from me .
It was like sitting in a vault strewn with dead bodies -- the cap , the noose , the pinioned arms , the faces that he knew , even beneath that hideous veil. -- <NAME> , light !
Not for your sake , but for the sake of others .
Such were Mr Quilp ’ s first proceedings on entering upon his new property .
All this she did without looking at me .
In this family we are all children , and I am the youngest . ''
But all these tokens of past grandeur were miserably decayed and dirty ; rot , damp , and age , had weakened the flooring , which in many places was unsound and even unsafe .
He bowed , as if in compliance ; but turning back , when he had nearly reached the door , said : ‘ I am forgiven , and have explained my fault .
I am the umble instrument of umbly serving him , and he puts me on an eminence I hardly could have hoped to reach .
These gentlemen being rejected after twenty-four hours ’ pleasantry , Mr <NAME> consented to remain , and did remain , until a club of choice spirits called a <NAME> jury ( who were in the joke ) summoned him to a trial before twelve other wags for perjury and fraud , who in their turn found him guilty with a
It is humiliating enough to know that there are among men brutes so obscene and worthless , that they can delight in laying their miserable profanations upon the very steps of <NAME> ’ s greatest altar .
‘ Only a bob ’ s vorth , <NAME> , ’ cried the driver sulkily , for the information of his friend the waterman , as the cab drove off .
Her mother eyed her sharply for a moment , and feeling herself on unsafe ground , said , as a diversion : ‘ My charming <NAME> , you must come and kiss me once more , if you please , my love. ’ Florence complied , of course , and again imprinted her lips on Mrs <NAME> ’ s ear
But come in , come in ! ’ Chattering in this way , <NAME> pushed <NAME> into the back room , where , amusing himself by boring little circular caverns in the chimney-piece with a red-hot poker , sat no less a person than <NAME> .
`` Yes , my dear , '' said <NAME> .
‘ Then I ’ ll tell you wot it is , ’ said <NAME> , after a short meditation , ‘ this is a case for that ‘ ere confidential pal o ’ the <NAME> ’ s .
There used to be a poem when I learnt lessons , something about Lo the poor Indians whose something mind !
and coming half across the room to meet me , kneeled down upon the ground and kissed me , and laid my head down on her bosom near the little creature that was nestling there , and put its hand to my lips .
‘ And now pray tell me something all you know , ’ said <NAME> , drawing her chair near to his , ‘ about the good dear quiet little thing and all the changes of her fortunes carriage people now no doubt and horses without number most romantic , a coat of arms of course and wild beasts on their
The appearances , beyond all rational doubt , observed in that case are the appearances observed in <NAME> 's case .
When <NAME> and the unfortunate Prince found an opportunity to become betrothed I do n't know , but they certainly found none on this occasion to exchange a dozen words .
Dear Mr Clennam , don ’ t let me see you weep !
Shall I ever forget the morning I looked scornfully at him when he offered to carry my parasol ?
On his way home , on the evening he set aside for this momentous purpose , he took the precaution of stepping into a chemist ’ s shop and buying a bottle of the very strongest smelling-salts .
The <NAME> pointed as before .
From personal intercourse with accomplished gentlemen connected with publications of this class , I have derived both pleasure and profit .
He had no wife to call in and astonish , so he rang the bell for his servant .
Do you think it good ? -- Warn her father against me .
‘ Hum -- eh -- what ’ s that ? ’ said the strange man .
‘ <NAME> , ’ retorted <NAME> , colouring , ‘ is a wicked , impudent , bold-faced hussy. ’ ‘ What ’ s that ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
<NAME> father said anything particular to you to-day or yesterday , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , <NAME> .
For we were very happy then , I think. ’ ‘ Heaven knows we were ! ’ said I .
At what an opportune moment they arrived , how they listened , and what they heard , is already known to the reader .
‘ Con-found it , no , ’ rejoined <NAME> , stopping for an instant to smash a fly with the ruler .
The screen still goes , as before .
When he loves his Florence most , he will hate me least .
I deplored the untimely death of <NAME> , most sincerely , and shed tears in doing so .
I admire her -- as my friend does -- exceedingly .
My time is nearly all devoted to some very intimate friends .
You can have as much flirting as you like -- at your Boffins .
'Indeed I do n't know , sir , ' replied <NAME> .
‘ No , ’ replied <NAME> ’ ly , shaking her head , ‘ I ’ m afraid of the sea. ’ ‘ Afraid ! ’ I said , with a becoming air of boldness , and looking very big at the mighty ocean .
What do you say , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ I say , aunt , ’ I interposed , ‘ that I must do something ! ’ ‘ Go for a soldier , do you mean ? ’ returned my aunt , alarmed ; ‘ or go to sea ?
We merely know that after a short pause <NAME> said , ‘ Lor , do adun , <NAME> ! ’ and that his hat had fallen off a few moments before -- from both of which tokens we should be disposed to infer that one kiss , or more , had passed between the parties .
It ’ s not possible. ’ ‘ No , <NAME> ’ am , ’ said <NAME> ‘ No more did my Uncle ’ s child .
‘ As silent a feller as myself .
The uncle , a rigid old gentleman of strong force of character ; the nephew , habitually timid , repressed , and under constraint. ’ Mistress Affery , fixedly attentive in the window-seat , biting the rolled up end of her apron , and trembling from head to foot , here cried out , ‘ Jeremiah , keep off from
‘ Uncle , ’ said <NAME> , when she judged they must be near their destination , ‘ I must ask one question of you .
By degrees , the shutters were opened ; the window-blinds were drawn up ; and people began passing to and fro .
I found him in his dressing-room surrounded by his stock of boots , already hard at it , washing his hands of us .
said <NAME> with great enjoyment .
All that evening , <NAME> had been hunting and searching in byways and corners for the very person who now knocked at his door , while <NAME> had been pursuing the same inquiry in other directions .
As to whether your name is <NAME> , or <NAME> ? ” The official turned towards him with sudden distrust .
They think me a long way off , and if I went wholly unexpected , I should frighten them .
‘ “ I will , ” rejoined the baron .
At length he was quiet -- well he might be with her dimpled chin upon his head ! -- and we walked away to look at a greenhouse .
‘ I am fully aware of that .
What could have made them so late ?
‘ There is no “ of course ” in the case , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , gradually breaking into a smile , in spite of the uneasiness which <NAME> ’ s obstinacy had given him .
The house in <NAME> Inn had bills in the windows announcing that it was to let , and it looked dirtier and gloomier and ghastlier than ever .
Never clapped eyes upon her ! ” “ Goodness , uncle !
‘ Em ’ ly ’ s her name , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ and she ’ s little too .
The name pleased him , or suited him as well as any other , and the Bachelor he had ever since remained .
As he is not here , to-morrow will be time enough . '
After all , perhaps , the plainest course for persons of such tender consciences , would be , a total abstinence from tavern-keeping .
We can go to the <NAME> , or the <NAME> for the <NAME> , or the <NAME> , I dare say ; and the sooner we go the better. ’ With this extraordinary jumble of charitable institutions , Mrs. Nickleby again gave way to her tears .
I did not enjoy the delight of seeing the wit who indited the paragraph in question , but I have no doubt he is a prodigious man in his way , and held in high repute by a select circle .
`` If time could be spared , '' said <NAME> , `` which is the only thing that ca n't be spared in this case , I might get it out of that woman ; but it 's too doubtful a chance to trust to under present circumstances .
‘ Now , my men , ’ said the single gentleman ; ‘ you have done very well .
`` That 'll do , my good friend ! ''
If he takes and says , “ Maggy , you hurry away and back with that letter , and you shall have a sixpence if the answer ’ s a good ‘ un , ” I must take it .
We left it with no little regret on the evening of Friday the 11th , and travelled that night by railroad to <NAME> .
If you do n't like it , I ca n't help it .
I sent for you , in order that I might say -- hum -- impressively say , in the presence of Mrs General , to whom we are all so much indebted for obligingly being present among us , on -- ha -- on this or any other occasion , ’ Mrs General shut her eyes , ‘ that I
‘ As handsome as her ? ’ said <NAME> .
‘ Give them a glass of wine each to drink the toast in .
‘ Your father is not on duty at present , I think , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , sir , he comes on later in the afternoon. ’ Another twirl of the great hat , and then <NAME> said , rising , ‘ I am afraid I must wish you good day , sir. ’ ‘ So soon ?
I ’ ve never met with nothing but beer ath ’ ll ever clean a comic blackamoor. ’ <NAME> rapidly assented ; <NAME> rapidly turned out from a box , a smock frock , a felt hat , and other essentials ; the whelp rapidly changed clothes behind a screen of baize ; <NAME> rapidly brought beer , and washed
‘ There ! ’ said <NAME> when they got into the street ; ‘ now you ’ re provided for. ’ <NAME> was about to thank him again , but he stopped her .
They can examine for themselves whether there has been anything in the public career of that country since , at home or abroad , which suggests that those influences and tendencies really did exist .
The great promenade and thoroughfare , as most people know , is <NAME> ; a wide and bustling street , which , from the <NAME> to its opposite termination in a country road , may be four miles long .
<NAME> , please to give the lad some wine. ’ Mr <NAME> ’ s glance followed <NAME> with sharp disfavour , as he left the room under the pilotage of Mrs <NAME> ; and it may be that his mind ’ s eye followed him with no greater relish , as he rode back to his <NAME> ’ s with
The boy , <NAME> , was training for and with a schoolmaster .
At noon we turned out again , to cross a wide river in another steamboat ; landed at a continuation of the railroad on the opposite shore ; and went on by other cars ; in which , in the course of the next hour or so , we crossed by wooden bridges , each a mile in length ,
He was out of breath by that time , as he might well be , and his heart seemed to jerk faster than the little shop-bell , as it quivered and jingled behind him with his hasty shutting of the door .
And you hear the people who are alive , crying , and working , and calling to one another down in the close dark streets , and you seem to pity them so !
‘ I ’ ll brood over miseries no longer , but put a good face on the matter , and try the fresh air and the bears again ; and if that don ’ t do , I ’ ll talk to the baroness soundly , and cut the <NAME> dead. ’ With this the baron fell into his chair
And in what walk of life , or dance of life , does man ever get such stimulating applause as thunders about him , when , having danced his partner off her feet , and himself too , he finishes by leaping gloriously on the bar-counter , and calling for something to drink , with the chuckle of a million
‘ <NAME> ! ’ he returned , and burst into a roar of laughter that shook the chaise .
Sometimes , I had proceeded restlessly from place to place , stopping nowhere ; sometimes , I had lingered long in one spot .
Holding my mind as steadily as I could to these points , I went into the next room with them .
He promptly says again , `` Have the goodness to hear me , <NAME> , '' and motions to the chair from which she has risen .
In the fulness of time a milliner came in , and to her she repaired on her own behalf .
Indeed , such another lucky hit would almost have set him up in that way to his satisfaction .
' I wonder they do n't murder you !
Not , however , that <NAME> would do here alone. ’ Mr <NAME> was going to say ‘ No ? ’ interrogatively , but he saw his danger and said it assentingly , ‘ <NAME> , Oh dear no ; she wouldn ’ t do here alone. ’ ‘ No , <NAME> .
Let me know how you would have dealt with me if you had regarded me as being what you would have considered on equal terms with you. ’ ‘ It is impossible , Mr Wrayburn .
If he followed it by mere fortuitous coincidence , it was done by an evil chance .
'She will be persuaded now , ' cried the young lady .
<NAME> was not at all what I meant , for I had intended my question to apply to his means .
‘ So ! ’ said <NAME> , with a contemptuous laugh , ‘ I see her at last !

The state of that wretch who continually finds the weak spots in his own crime , and strives to strengthen them when it is unchangeable , is a state that aggravates the offence by doing the deed a thousand times instead of once ; but it is a state , too , that tauntingly visits the offence upon a sullen
Firm of look and firm of purpose , she intently watched its coming on , until it was very near ; then , with a touch unshipped her sculls , and crept aft in the boat , between kneeling and crouching .
He ’ s close to the door .
All I had to do , I said , with gloomy sarcasm , was to forget <NAME> .

<NAME> water is in general request at the office next day , and most of the party deem the bill an imposition .
`` I am sorry , '' says <NAME> , `` to have touched so sore a place . ''
And what that deep red light in the opposite direction ?
She ’ d deny it , and so would my master .
In a word , I was too cowardly to do what I knew to be right , as I had been too cowardly to avoid doing what I knew to be wrong .
‘ Not contented , <NAME> , ’ said Mr Chuckster , ‘ with making friends with <NAME> , he has cultivated the acquaintance of his father and mother .
When you know that she only does it out of kindness and the best intentions !
It don ’ t signify to any one. ’ ‘ O yes it does ; I am sorry to see you so. ’ ‘ You are not sorry , ’ said the girl .
I have had to-day ’ s practice at home and abroad , on a march , and aboard ship , and I ’ ll tell you this : I don ’ t know that I have ever pursued it under such quiet circumstances as here this day .
But I felt that the kiss was given to the coarse common boy as a piece of money might have been , and that it was worth nothing .
And yet -- and yet -- she sends a look in that direction as if it were her heart 's desire to have that figure moved out of the way .
She ’ s more to me -- gent ’ lmen -- than -- she ’ s all to me that ever I can want , and more than ever I -- than ever I could say .
‘ Is it Justice with the bandage off her eyes , and without the sword and scales ?
His tap at the glass roused her from the musing solitude in which she sat , and she came to the door to open it ; aiding her steps with a little crutch-stick .
It was a temperance song ( whirlwinds of cheers ) .
Little <NAME> is waiting for the coroner and jury on their return .
She stood , like a spirit , beside him , and he bent over his work .
The day being very warm and the street a quiet one , the windows were wide open ; and it was easy to hear through the <NAME> blinds all that passed inside .
But now , <NAME> arrived .
What _could_ the boy be crying for ?
He is standing close to the lazy gentleman , and says with a faint smile that he believes She is a very strong <NAME> ; to which the lazy gentleman , looking first in his questioner ’ s eye and then very hard in the wind ’ s , answers unexpectedly and ominously , that She need be .
She has her friend and counsellor always near . ''
No ; I repudiate the title !
Others drew forth , with clashing noise , upon the ground , great sheets of glowing steel , emitting an insupportable heat , and a dull deep light like that which reddens in the eyes of savage beasts .
‘ A quiet , happy place -- a place to live and learn to die in ! ’ She would have said more , but that the energy of her thoughts caused her voice to falter , and come in trembling whispers from her lips .
<NAME> , on that unfortunate occasion , commits himself under provocation. ’ ‘ And under mulled wine , ’ added the old lady .
He complied , and I went on alone .
I felt in the same way towards my school companions ; I felt in the same way towards Mrs. Rachael , who was a widow ; and oh , towards her daughter , of whom she was proud , who came to see her once a fortnight !
‘ You mean that in that case I must pay the damages ? ’ said <NAME> , who had watched this telegraphic answer with considerable sternness .
Batter the gate once more ! ’ He stood listening intently , but the noise was not renewed .
It was written with a plain , unaffected , homely piety that I knew to be genuine , and ended with ‘ my duty to my ever darling ’ -- meaning myself .
( Gusty weather with deceitful calms .
‘ When he was waiting to be the object of your munificence , so freely bestowed for my sake , and when I was unhappy in the mercenary shape I was made to wear , I thought it would have become him better to have worked his own way on .
Are you her ladyship 's property , or somebody else 's ?
Shall I give you a ride , <NAME> ?
`` Anyhow , here I stand , this present day , <NAME> married to <NAME> 's widder .
<NAME> clamps and girders , fire-proof from top to bottom ; mechanical lifts for the housemaids , with all their brushes and brooms ; everything that heart could desire .
It is to be hoped they will still continue happy .
And so I said yes , if it was no harm , and she said no -- no harm .
But he wore out , poor man , so I have appointed his successor .
<NAME> <NAME> roused me from this reflection , which was blended with a certain remorseful apprehension of seeing <NAME> himself , by bestowing many encomiums on the absent Littimer as a most respectable fellow , and a thoroughly admirable servant .
<NAME> <NAME> looked at me , and I looked at her and said I was indeed .
He was a simple-hearted old gentleman , of a shrinking , subdued spirit , accustomed to retirement , and very little acquainted with the world , which he had left many years before to come and settle in that place .
The instant over , he says , sensibly touched : ‘ I am afraid I am but a shallow , surface kind of fellow , <NAME> , and that my headpiece is none of the best .
Pictures and prints of vessels fighting with the rolling waves filled her with alarm .
A little pincushion , a little housewife , a little book , a little workbox , a little set of tables and weights and measures , and a little woman , all in one .
Come -- to play. ” “ Come nearer ; let me look at you .
But no argument in favour of the system , can reasonably be deduced from this circumstance , although it is very often urged .
<NAME> retired behind his elbow at first , but relented at the sight of sponge-cake and allowed me to take him on my lap , where he sat munching quietly .
A profound silence was observed during the ride .
' I hope , ' stammered <NAME> : ' I hope the magistrates will not form the opinion that the authorities have been guilty of any improper conduct , on the unsupported testimony of a child . '
The apothecary 's apprentice , having completed the manufacture of the toothpick , planted himself in front of the fire and made good use of it for ten minutes or so : when apparently growing rather dull , he wished Mrs. Corney joy of her job , and took himself off on tiptoe .
They have a motive for exertion and becoming pride , in the desire to make these little chambers comfortable and decent .
I saw my brother near the school , sir , ’ to <NAME> , ‘ because it ’ s easier for me to go there , than for him to come here .
Never , no , never once , in one unguarded moment from that time to the end , did any care for himself , any thought of his own comfort , any selfish consideration or regard distract his thoughts from the gentle object of his love .
So make her comfortable. ’ ‘ Thank you very much , sir , ’ that discreet lady observed , ‘ but pray do not let My comfort be a consideration .
And the communication I have got to make is , that he has great expectations. ” <NAME> and I gasped , and looked at one another .
My appetite vanished instantly , and I knew no peace or rest until the day arrived .
‘ I believe every word you have said , ’ he returned .
Without I was informed agen , the danger ai n't so much to signify .
The pace at which they went , was such a very lazy , ill-looking saunter , that <NAME> soon began to think his companions were going to deceive the old gentleman , by not going to work at all .
`` She was a noble vessel .
Nevertheless , his dignity gets over it after stopping to refit , and he goes on with my Lady for <NAME> , lying only one night in <NAME> on the way to <NAME> .
And the one that went on only went on a certain way agreed upon to deceive and then turned across country and went home .
<NAME> took no notice of either of us , but led us the way that I knew so well .
You would then have been my ward until you were of age .
This is an unseasonable hour , but here is a young woman who has been making statements which render my visit necessary .
<NAME> told him it was between two and three .
‘ His ascendancy over papa , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ is very great .
If he falls in my way , I shall tell him my mind ; if he don ’ t fall in my way , I shan ’ t , for it won ’ t be worth my while to do it .
‘ And now , ’ said the schoolmaster , dividing the bread and butter for three into as many portions as there were children , ‘ you had better look sharp with your breakfast , for the horn will blow in a minute or two , and then every boy leaves off. ’ Permission being thus given to fall to
‘ Dear Arthur , ’ said her delighted voice outside the door , ‘ I have some one here .
Yes , it was ; there they were .
<NAME> firm , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , looking down .
‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> and was about to add ‘ we may wait at a little distance , ’ when turning his head he found that no <NAME> was there .
The lodging was rather confined as to space , but I fancied that if Mrs. <NAME> 's household had been the only lodgers in <NAME> <NAME> 's or <NAME> 's , the sole advantage they would have found in the size of the building would have been its affording a great deal of room to be dirty in .
<NAME> is not a very comfortable lodging , but perhaps I thought it less so when I first saw it than you would have done , because you have been in many different countries and have seen many different customs .
‘ A positive fool , ’ said <NAME> .
Why , we ain ’ t had such a thing happen here , my dear , not for I couldn ’ t name the time when .
'As you like , my dear , as you like ' replied the Jew .
‘ It was at that time that mama was most solicitous about my <NAME> .
‘ What a world of gammon and spinnage it is , though , ain ’ t it ! ’ This was addressed confidentially to both of us , as the morsel of a hand came away from the face , and buried itself , arm and all , in the bag again .
She detested us , she was miserable with us , she couldn ’ t bear it , she wouldn ’ t bear it , she was determined to go away .
Still , it is to be feared that this injustice is inseparable from the state of things with which humanity and truth are called upon to deal .
Mysterious and incomprehensible , the <NAME> , with that lively sense upon him of having done a little business for the youngsters , remained all day , even to his most intimate friends ; and but that <NAME> attributed his winks and grins , and other such pantomimic reliefs of himself , to his satisfaction in the success of their
‘ Good night , sir , good night , ’ cried the lawyer , retreating backwards towards the door .
How near to her heart the echoes of her child 's tread came , and those of her own dear father 's , always active and self-possessed , and those of her dear husband 's , need not be told .
‘ I ’ ll see this <NAME> and <NAME> !
Her heart was sore , she said , to think of them ; and to talk on this theme , even to strangers , in that blighted place , so far from her old home , eased it somewhat , and became a melancholy pleasure .
Here he made the acquaintance of the <NAME> ’ s beautiful young wife ( paler than formerly , all this time ; more rarely seen by me or anyone , I think ; and not so gay , but not less beautiful ) , and so became more and more familiar by degrees , until , at last , he
The most is made , however , of the means it possesses , and it is as well regulated as such a place can be .
That lady seemed to think very little about it , for the supper being by this time on table , she gave her hand to <NAME> and repaired with a stately step to the left hand of <NAME> .
R. <NAME> locked up his desk one evening , and , putting his bunch of keys in his pocket much as if it were his peg-top , made for home .
<NAME> opinion hailed this doctrine with a howl of wild applause , and set the prisoners free , to walk the city , men of mark , and influence , and station , as they had been before .
