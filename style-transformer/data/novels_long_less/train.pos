At eight we landed again , and travelled by a stage-coach for four hours through a pleasant and well-cultivated country , perfectly <NAME> in every respect : in the appearance of the cottages ; the air , language , and dress of the peasantry ; the sign-boards on the shops and taverns : and the <NAME> ' s shrines
' Ma ' am ! ' said Mr <NAME> , in great astonishment .
<NAME> <NAME> nodded his acquiescence in the sentiment , and again fastening his eyes on the fire , shrouded himself in a cloud , and mused deeply .
In my pain an ' trouble , lookin up yonder , —wi ' it shinin on me—I ha ' seen more clear , and ha ' made it my dyin prayer that aw th ' world may on ' y coom toogether more , an ' get a better unnerstan ' in o ' one another , than when
So , Mrs. <NAME> first slapped <NAME> for being the cause of her vexation , and then shed tears .
' <NAME> ' t us better have a bit o ' breakfast afore we start ? ' said <NAME> .
" But when you came down here , " proceeded <NAME> , " it was a fine day .
<NAME> was pig ' s whole mass of blood so turned .
Then potentially : I may not and I can not go home ; and I might not , could not , would not , and should not go home ; until I felt that I was going distracted , and rolled over on the pillow , and looked at the staring rounds upon the wall again .
' Not on any account , ' said the visitor , hurriedly .
His bloated gaoler , who wore spectacles to read with , glanced over them to assure himself that he had taken his place , and went through the list , making a similar short pause at each name .
<NAME> 's account , I think. " " What is to be done ? " " You had better come to my house , " said the man .
And then he catched hold of us , and kep on a talking to her , and answering of her , till I half believed I see her myself .
<NAME> was drawn with him .
The fashion of the last Louis but one , of the line that was never to break -- the fourteenth Louis -- was conspicuous in their rich furniture ; but , it was diversified by many objects that were illustrations of old pages in the history of <NAME> .
' <NAME> and <NAME> , ' repeated his father .
With a buoyancy and hopefulness and a gaiety that hardly ever flagged , <NAME> had a carelessness in his character that quite perplexed me , principally because he mistook it , in such a very odd way , for prudence .
<NAME> , left to <NAME> , soon became more like his former self ; though there was a settled depression upon him , which he never shook off .
' How fast the river runs , between its green banks and the rushes , <NAME> !
During the two days <NAME> was confined to bed , <NAME> was his constant attendant .
As I did not care , however , to get to <NAME> before one or two o ' clock in the day , and as we had another little excommunication case in court that morning , which was called The office of the judge promoted by <NAME> against <NAME> for his soul ' s correction , I passed an
After a silence they all sit down to supper , and drink to the young husband and wife in something else ; and the last bottle of the old <NAME> still remains among its dust and cobwebs , undisturbed .
<NAME> <NAME> , are you a clerk in <NAME> 's bank ? " " On a certain Friday night in November one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five , did business occasion you to travel between <NAME> and Dover by the mail ? " " It did. " " Were there any other passengers in the mail ? " "
' You make my head ache by remaining in that position , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , raising her eyes to him after another minute ; ' you look so aggravatingly large by this light .
No woman could have borne what she has. " ' I sickened at the thought of the long course of cruelty and neglect which must have occurred to produce such an impression on such a man .
" There is nothing more to do , " said he , glancing upward at the moon , " until to-morrow .
' Am I blind , deaf , silly ; do I know nothing of human nature when I see it before me ?
I drink to the Republic. " <NAME> went back to the counter , and said , " Certainly , a little like. " <NAME> sternly retorted , " I tell you a good deal like. " <NAME> pacifically remarked , " He is so much in your mind , see you , madame. " The amiable <NAME> added ,
We have changed that child according to the changes in the child spared to us and always with us .
The man who growled out these words , was a stoutly-built fellow of about five-and-thirty , in a black velveteen coat , very soiled drab breeches , lace-up half boots , and grey cotton stockings which inclosed a bulky pair of legs , with large swelling calves ; -- the kind of legs , which in such costume ,
I am driven out of it , I come here , and in a moment I feel an altered person .
If your wife were a hundred times the ingrate that she is , and if I were a thousand times more hopeless than I am of inducing her to be silent if this man is silenced , I would tell it myself , before I would bear the torment of the hearing it from him. ' <NAME> pushed his
<NAME> <NAME> , who never gives hopes , lays his palm upon the client 's shoulder and answers with a smile , " Always here , sir .
It never wore out , though it was always going round and round in all the <NAME> .
Do what he would , behind the little counter , as to the striking of a light and the lighting of his pipe , he was troubled , and his hand was not trustworthy .
What ' s a fellow-man without honour !
I understand yours , ' peeping down into his face .
Saving that the fire had died out , it was as his eyes had closed upon it .
What would become of me without her ? ' ' I should have thought you were old enough to take care of yourself , if you ever will be , ' retorted <NAME> sharply .
In the same neighbourhood is the <NAME> , where young orphans are nursed and bred .
Now tell me where that school is , and what it is , and all about it. ' ' Before I can advise you properly , ' said <NAME> -- ' the old question , you know .
' I like yours so much , that I wanted to speak to you , from the very first moment I saw you under the pump. ' Did you though ? ' ' Upon my word .
Many succeeding days passed in like manner ; except that there were numerous visits received and paid , and that <NAME> held little levees in her own apartments , at which <NAME> was a frequent attendant , and that Florence encountered no second look from her father , although she saw him every day .
When the knives and forks rattled very much , or any of his fellows got an unusually large piece of fat , he accompanied the music with a short howl , but he immediately checked it on his master looking round , and applied himself with increased diligence to the <NAME> .
Why does he look at <NAME> ?
This desk is your rock , sir ! "
I don ' t know what you may call this , but I call it unnatural conduct. ' There was a piece of ornamental water immediately below the parapet , on the other side , into which <NAME> had a very strong inclination to pitch <NAME> junior , as the injured men of <NAME> threatened to pitch their property
<NAME> <NAME> was a little hoarser than on the previous day , and <NAME> looked rather sleepy and queer ; from which tokens , as well as from the circumstance of their both being to a trifling extent unsteady upon their legs , Mrs. Nickleby justly concluded that they had taken dinner .
And thus , through years and years , and lives and lives , everything goes on , constantly beginning over and over again , and nothing ever ends .
' She had an affectionate and gentle heart , ' he said ; ' and it was broken .
It happened , at length , that he had occasion to change the instrument in his hand , for his shoemaker 's knife .
He left me , and I stood at the dark window watching the street .
" My dear child , I intend to .
Henceforth I will be a prisoner in my own room. ' And <NAME> steadfastly adhered to this determination .
Mrs. Sparsit ' s nerves have been acted upon by this business , and she ' ll stay here a day or two .
Then , what am I to call him ! ' Nobody present having any suggestion to offer in the remarkable emergency , Mrs. Gradgrind departed this life for the time being , after delivering the following codicil to her remarks already executed : ' As to the wedding , all I ask , <NAME> , is , —and I
The idea of his taking himself well to task , with that laughing face and heedless manner and with a fancy that everything could catch and nothing could hold , was ludicrously anomalous .
I positively say I can not do it .
Mr Codlin indeed required no such persuasion , as he had already eaten as much as he could possibly carry and was now moistening his clay with strong ale , whereof he took deep draughts with a silent relish and invited nobody to partake -- thus again strongly indicating his misanthropical turn of mind .
I should have very little respect , indeed , for anybody who could advocate a different opinion .
Good-bye , <NAME> Parent ! " in a cheery shout .
Stop where you are , ma ' am , ' said <NAME> , ' stop where you are !
There were several Professors passing in and out , with exactly the aggressive air upon them of being ready for a turn-up with any Novice who might happen to be on hand , that <NAME> well remembered in the circles of the <NAME> .
He had no mother -- no anything in the way of a relative , that I could discover , except a sister , who fled to <NAME> the moment we had taken him off her hands ; and he became quartered on us like a horrible young changeling .
The mud and water fly about us .
We found her , in her spectacles , sitting by the fire .
You have been agitated , and it ' s growing dark. ' ' I am used to be out alone at this hour , and I entreat you not to do so. ' ' I promise .
It is highly important to keep the connexion together ; and schools , if at all neglected , are apt to take offence . "
" Good day , <NAME> ! " the spy repeated ; with not quite so much confidence , or quite so easy a smile under the stare .
Thus they emerged upon the <NAME> , which was as quiet after the roaring streets as though it had been open country .
The people even like me as I go about , and make so much of me that I am quite abashed .
He is in the law and not much at home . "
You would lie easier , <NAME> , if you would allow me to move you . "
That 's about what YOU are , you know , ai n't you ? "
' Give me your name , young man ? ' The queer little figure , and the queer but not ugly little face , with its bright grey eyes , were so sharp , that the sharpness of the manner seemed unavoidable .
Excellent fellow as I knew <NAME> to be , and warmly attached to him as I was , I could not help wishing , on that delicate occasion , that he had never contracted the habit of brushing his hair so very upright .
' As I ? ' ' As sorry for her choice -- for what you call her choice -- as you are angry at it , ' said the <NAME> .
' <NAME> and look in , <NAME> ! ' said <NAME> to Mr Boffin .
' It ' s all the same. ' He glanced at me , and <NAME> ' s hand gently patted me upon the shoulder .
' No , ' said <NAME> , ' I didn ' t tell her that. ' ' Didn ' t tell her which ? ' asked <NAME> .
Yes , and he would have it hatred , and he made it hatred , though some sparkles of the light in which she had appeared before him on the memorable night of his return home with his <NAME> , occasionally hung about her still .
He had not gone far , when coming on towards him he beheld the portly gentleman , who had walked into his counting-house the day before , and said , " <NAME> and <NAME> 's , I believe ? "
' <NAME> ' t I tell you it ' s all right ?
It ' s not to be mentioned everywhere ; it ' s not to be mentioned anywhere : in order that the scoundrels concerned ( there ' s a gang of ' em ) may be thrown off their guard .
These men and women were yet in the streets , passing quietly to their homes , when <NAME> , who had been called away from <NAME> some minutes before , returned .
And yet he pitied her so much , and felt so unwilling to have a matter of such gravity disturbing the oddity of their acquaintance , that he thought , and thought truly , that rather than receive fifty pounds down , he would have the <NAME> proved innocent .
Yes , yes , yes ! ' slowly vanished from them into the mist .
Anything more about our friends in <NAME> ' s Court ?
It 's more of a selfish reason .
You must see my daughters .
Be sure o ' that , ma ' am .
He looked astonished , but said not a word .
I took infinitely greater pains to cheer him up again than I had taken to depress him ; and I soon understood ( as I ought to have known at first ) that he had been so confident , merely because of his faith in the wisest and most wonderful of women , and his unbounded reliance on my
I am accidentally possessed of a power over one of the keepers here , and in virtue of it I stand before you .
His mind was so exactly regulated , that he had no affections or passions .
'_Non istwentus_ , as the lawyers say , ' replied the little man , shaking his head , and looking amazingly sly .
<NAME> colonists have their horses ( and blood 'uns , if you please , good Lord ! )
' Understand me , my dear ; ' thus she went on .
I tried to calm him , that we might come to something rational ; but he got hotter and hotter , and wouldn ' t hear a word .
If I was to say seeking that , as a bird seeks its nest , I should make an ass of myself , because that would trench upon what I understand to be poetry ; and I am so far from trenching upon poetry at any time , that I never , to my knowledge , got within ten
He experienced no other crosses on the way , than those which originated in the perverse behaviour of the two paupers , who persisted in shivering , and complaining of the cold , in a manner which , <NAME> declared , caused his teeth to chatter in his head , and made him feel quite uncomfortable ; although he
All this presented the art to me in a singular light , to be sure .
He loved the child as though she were his own .
I am very dear to him , and he is very dear to me .
See how they hang their heads , and droop , and wither .
The labouring of the ship in the troubled sea on this night I shall never forget .
The murdered woman , -- more a match for the man , certainly , in point of years -- was found dead in a barn near <NAME> .
Every thing in its perspective led to her innocent figure .
' More than one-and-forty ! ' ' I ain ' t , ' said the spinster aunt , her indignation getting the better of her determination to faint .
Can ' t be buyer and seller too .
Yes , to be sure it was ; you recollect , <NAME> , my dear , the very last time young <NAME> was here -- last Tuesday night he went off in just the same strange way , at the very moment the knock came to the door .
So much the more. ' Both in his sister ' s presence , and after she had left the room , the whelp took no pains to hide his contempt for <NAME> , whenever he could indulge it without the observation of that independent man , by making wry faces , or shutting one eye .
But , as this might have been a reason for coming to the opposite conclusion , he followed out the theme again a little way in his mind ; to justify himself , perhaps .
They came upon her more and more strongly yet .
Oh , oh , oh ! ' The young lady who , hysterically speaking , was only just come of age , and had never gone off yet , here fell into a highly creditable crisis , which , regarded as a first performance , was very successful ; Mr <NAME> , bending over the body meanwhile , in
Here is <NAME> with a variety of qualifications -- with great talent -- ' ' Really , my love , ' said <NAME> .
' Why , <NAME> help you ! ' returned the broker ; ' you don ' t suppose that property ' s of any use , do you ? ' ' Why not ? ' inquired the <NAME> .
'He 's the boy for you , my dear , ' replied the Jew in a hoarse whisper ; laying his finger on the side of his nose , and grinning frightfully .
I was so comfortable with myself now as not to mind the veil and to be able to put it aside .
' Your invitation , ' returned Mr Feeder .
' And above all things mind this , <NAME> !
' I have brought his money for the week , ' said the child , looking to the woman and laying it on the table -- ' and -- and -- a little more , for he was always good and kind to me .
Keep it quiet , and the thieves will grow in confidence by little and little , and we shall have ' em. ' ' Very sagacious indeed , sir , ' said Mrs. Sparsit .
' I feel bound to assure you , sir , and I am proud to have this opportunity OF assuring you , that I consider <NAME> a gentleman highly virtuous , exemplary , well conducted , and -- ' ' I make no doubt of it , sir , ' interrupted <NAME> , checking the torrent of recommendation ;
I thought if you took by any means forgivingly to my name I might gradually get myself up to the point of writing a letter .
No ; it could not have been the fat boy ; there was not a gleam of mirth , or anything but feeding in his whole visage .
' We ' ll try what can be done. ' Pending these little endearments , <NAME> had stood , awkwardly enough , in the middle of the room : not very well knowing whether he was expected to retire into the passage , or to remain where he was .
At last , one day , I took courage , and said , " Is it <NAME> ? " And the dear old home-voice answered , " Which it air , old chap. " " O <NAME> , you break my heart !
The harp had not been used for many and many a day .
' I believe he dreams in letters ! ' ' There ' s <NAME> , too , ' said <NAME> , ' has been doing wonders !
In the evening of this same foggy day when the yellow window-blind of <NAME> and Co. was drawn down upon the day ' s work , <NAME> the Jew once more came forth into <NAME> .
<NAME> words and fair pretences ; but I penetrated below those assertions of themselves and depreciations of me , and they were no better .
<NAME> <NAME> , then , was a lady of thirty-five or thereabouts , of a gaunt and bony figure , and a resolute bearing , which if it repressed the softer emotions of love , and kept admirers at a distance , certainly inspired a feeling akin to awe in the breasts of those male strangers who had the
' You don ' t know that you are a favourite of my husband ' s , and that I am almost bound to be jealous of you ? ' said <NAME> .
She is an edge-tool , and requires great care in dealing with .
<NAME> <NAME> is very proud of this , and of his voice , and of his style .
I recommend him -- against all my previous conviction , for I knew he would never do any good -- to a man with whom , behaving himself properly , he might have remained , in comfort , for years .
' " Just that , " replied the figure , playing with his stake , and examining the ferule .
Thinking no longer of his own misfortunes , but wondering what could be those of the beautiful girl he had seen , <NAME> , with many wrong turns , and many inquiries , and almost as many misdirections , bent his steps towards the place whither he had been directed .
But they 're a wild lot in general , sir .
Almost always when she raised her eyes from her work , she observed the captain looking at her , and thoughtfully stroking his chin ; and he so often hitched his arm-chair close to her , as if he were going to say something very confidential , and hitched it away again , as not being able to make
He laughs and beams , and looks as innocent as you like , and says , 'But I do n't know the value of these things .
' Yes , ' said <NAME> , nodding in great triumph ; ' another book , in three volumes post octavo .
In the morning , with my tools upon my shoulder , eating my morsel of black bread as I go , I make a circuit by the prison , on my way to my work .
Nor yet we ca n't no more hold their tide than I can hold this .
' Couldn ' t do it. ' ' You ' re a barbarous being , ' replied the lady , ' and my hand ' s destroyed .
There it is ! " In a most irritating manner he instantly slapped his hands against one another , daintily flung one of his legs up behind him , pulled my hair , slapped his hands again , dipped his head , and butted it into my stomach .
' What do you mean , mama ? ' demanded <NAME> , in evident surprise .
And she was so faint , and lame , and miserable , Oh so wretched , that if you had seen her , <NAME> , you 'd have given her half a crown , I know ! "
From these you came on <NAME> 's room , which was part library , part sitting-room , part bedroom , and seemed indeed a comfortable compound of many rooms .
" Pray take some refreshment , sir , " said I. <NAME> sat down at the table and began nervously sharpening the carving-knife on the carving-fork , still looking at me ( as I felt quite sure without looking at him ) in the same unusual manner .
To have seen <NAME> now , divested of the brown beaver , the green veil , and the blue curl-papers , and arrayed in all the virgin splendour of a white frock and spencer , with a white muslin bonnet , and an imitative damask rose in full bloom on the inside thereof -- her luxuriant crop of hair
' I say , presumptuous child , if you had come from the neighbourhood of <NAME> , bending under the yoke of patronage and attended by its domestics in glittering garb to visit me , do you think my deep-seated feelings could have been expressed in looks ? ' ' All I think about it , is , '
I have a heart to be stabbed in or shot in , I have no doubt , " said <NAME> , " and of course if it ceased to beat I should cease to be .
I was trying to familiarize my mind with the worst , and to present to myself the arrangements we should have to make for the future in their sternest aspect , when a hackney-chariot coming after me , and stopping at my very feet , occasioned me to look up .
I could go into the world now , and laugh and shout with the best among them .
'You may burn a candle , ' said the Jew , putting one upon the table .
It 's not in my department , that ai n't . '
Two quiet figures were within the room ; two figures , equally still and impassive , equally removed by an untraversable distance from the teeming earth and all that it contains , though soon to lie in it .
It must be now , or never , for I shall not return here .
There is no use in going further , so I begin to undress .
The right was reserved for the <NAME> party , and the centre for the mayor and his officers ; one of whom -- the fat crier of <NAME> -- was ringing an enormous bell , by way of commanding silence , while <NAME> , and the <NAME> , with their hands upon their hearts , were bowing with the
I am , therefore , decidedly of opinion , gentlemen , that my uncle fell into a kind of doze , without having thought about anything at all .
I finished a large mourning order the day before yesterday .
Give a guess , my pretty ! ' ' I can ' t guess , ' said <NAME> , turning her pale face from one to another .
From that time it became a frequent custom with <NAME> the gipsy , as he went home jaded at night , to pass round by Bleeding <NAME> , go quietly up the stairs , look in at Mr Baptist ' s door , and , finding him in his room , to say , ' <NAME> , old chap
Among the lookers-on there was the same expression in all quarters of the court ; insomuch , that a great majority of the foreheads there , might have been mirrors reflecting the witness , when the Judge looked up from his notes to glare at that tremendous heresy about <NAME> .
I am at a loss to -- ' ' Do not say that , my dear madam , ' interrupted Mr Dorrit .
You know what I am , my dear Mortimer .
I don ' t mean how is he in health , but how is he going on : how is he behaving himself ? ' ' Damn him ! ' cried <NAME> , dashing his cherished hat on the floor ; ' like a false hound. ' ' Gracious , <NAME> , you quite terrify me ! ' exclaimed
' I do , indeed , ' answered <NAME> .
God bless her for her clear recollection of the companion passage of last year , when nobody was ill , and everybody dancing from morning to night , and it was ' a run ' of twelve days , and a piece of the purest frolic , and delight , and jollity !
' I could n't have believed it , sir ' said <NAME> , holding up her hands , and looking malignantly at <NAME> .
' There may be some , perhaps -- I don ' t know that there are -- who abuse his kindness , ' said <NAME> .
This market of <NAME> was quite out of the creature ' s line of road , but it had the attraction for him which it has for the worst of the solitary members of the drunken tribe .
These encomiums bring them to <NAME> and to <NAME> 's house .
' I seem to want my right hand , when I miss you .
" I had youth and hope .
I hope you didn ' t take any cold .
Then there was Mrs. Jellyby .
She is all edge. ' ' What a remarkable scar that is upon her lip ! ' I said .
I am glad to see you , <NAME> ; indeed I am. ' In truth Mrs <NAME> did seem a great deal more glad to behold her lord than might have been expected , and did evince a degree of interest in his safety which , all things considered , was rather unaccountable .
And lookee here , <NAME> , " resumes <NAME> , taking him aside by the arm , tapping him familiarly on the breast , and speaking in a confidential tone .
There can not be any objection to your seeing her presently , ma ' am .
It can never have been that which made you serious , darling ? ' ' <NAME> , it wasn ' t that , and still less was it Mrs Boffin , though I love her .
' Have we got another client like him now -- will you answer me that ? ' ' Do you mean in the face ! ' said his sister .
I have -- hum -- no husband to propose at present , my dear : I have not even one in view .
' I will , if you will .
But she was so incorporated with my existence , that it was the idlest of all fancies , and would soon rise out of my reach and sight , like gossamer floating in the air .
<NAME> chinked the money , weighed it in his hand , threw it up a little way and caught it , chinked it again .
A considerable capital of knee and elbow and wrist and ankle , had <NAME> , and he didn ' t know how to dispose of it to the best advantage , but was always investing it in wrong securities , and so getting himself into embarrassed circumstances .
" A-sparkling all over here , " says Jo , rubbing the fingers of his left hand on the knuckles of his right without taking his eyes from the figure .
He had never quite recovered the separation from <NAME> .
Some time ago , and soon after <NAME> was put into your house on the night of the robbery , I -- suspecting this man -- listened to a conversation held between him and <NAME> in the dark .
Mr <NAME> looked in ; assured himself that it was an empty , crazy room ; and signed to her to put the light back in its place .
" Oh , <NAME> dear , never forget who did all this ! "
Few rustic paths are wide enough for five , and <NAME> and the Secretary dropped behind .
even careless strangers -- they who had no feeling for her , but the interest of the moment -- they who would go away and forget next week that such a being lived -- even they saw it -- even they pitied her -- even they bade him good day compassionately , and whispered as they passed .
She was absorbed in thought , and he wondered what she might be thinking about .
' " I ' ll tell thee how the maiden wept , <NAME> , When her true love was slain ma ' am , And how her broken spirit slept , <NAME> , And never woke again ma ' am .
The ill-starred youngest Toodle but one , who would appear , from the frequency of his domestic troubles , to have been born under an unlucky planet , was prevented from performing his part in this general salutation by having fixed the sou ' wester hat ( with which he had been previously trifling ) deep on his head
Saving his troublesome sense of having been " low " on one occasion since his return , -- on which point he began to hold forth to <NAME> , the moment my revelation was finished , -- he had no perception of the possibility of my finding any fault with my good fortune .
His first act was to bolt the door on the inside ; his second , to polish his head and countenance very carefully with a cotton handkerchief ; his third , to place his hat , with the cotton handkerchief in it , on the nearest chair ; and his fourth , to produce from the breast-pocket of his
'Monks would never learn how you knew what you do ? '
I might have known she was in it. ' ' When he came down stairs and joined the lady who wouldn ' t let me come up , he gave me the pieces for you , and I was to say , " With Mr Alfred <NAME> ' s compliments on his leaving England. " ' Miss <NAME> said
" You see , too , " said the <NAME> , tremulously , " it is such an old companion. " " I would not keep it , " said <NAME> , shaking his head ; for he gained in firmness as he saw the <NAME> disquieted .
It was not a subject I could discuss with <NAME> , and <NAME> certainly had not the least suspicion of what had passed .
' <NAME> , sir , ' said the waiter , ' I don ' t know , sir , whether -- ' ' Ah !
' If I was , I should tell my own fortune -- and make it. ' ' Ah !
' This , Mr Clennam , you must know , is an old pensioner of mine , <NAME> , a very faithful old man. ' ( He always spoke of him as an object of great antiquity , but he was two or three years younger than himself . )
You , too , are disappointed and cut a poor figure. ' ' An injured figure ! ' ' You are now cool enough , <NAME> , to see that you can ' t be injured without my being equally injured ; and that therefore the mere word is not to the purpose .
I never , to my knowledge , had the pleasure of seeing <NAME> .
that doesn ' t matter at all , ' replied <NAME> .
What do you see in it ?
' Our friend <NAME> will excuse me if I forbear to explain myself generally , on account of the magnitude of the interests involved. ' <NAME> was only too happy , as it appeared to me , to have such interests , and such names , even hinted at , across his table .
'Just so , ' rejoined the other , nodding his head .
' And the people of those other two places , now , ' pursued <NAME> , with a bright twinkle in his keen eye , as it slightly turned in the direction of his magnificent neighbour ; ' we lawyers are always curious , always inquisitive , always picking up odds and ends for our patchwork minds , since
Your cousin <NAME> has been loving you as plainly as he could for I do n't know how long ! "
I -- Were you going there now ? " asked <NAME> .
' As well be reproachful as wholly unreasonable .
" You must have observed , gentlemen , " said he , " an ignorant and a blatant ass , with a rasping throat and a countenance expressive of low malignity , who went through -- I will not say sustained -- the rôle ( if I may use a <NAME> expression ) of <NAME> , King of <NAME>
you don ' t want to speak to him ? ' She repeats her dumb reply , and forms with her lips a soundless ' No. ' ' You can admire him at a distance three times a day , whenever you like .
' I loved her -- and I love the mem ' ry of her -- too deep -- to be able to lead her to believe of my own self as I ' m a happy man .
I said I wouldn ' t leave <NAME> , under existing circumstances , for any earthly consideration .
My dear child , what distresses you ? '
It was not <NAME> who detained us ; she was as reasonable a little creature in consulting the convenience of others as there possibly could be .
Ask the little old lady there ; she has been always present .
<NAME> <NAME> Claypole : receiving a free pardon from the <NAME> in consequence of being admitted approver against <NAME> : and considering his profession not altogether as safe a one as he could wish : was , for some little time , at a loss for the means of a livelihood , not burdened with too much work .
<NAME> to low company , as evinced in the case of a person named <NAME> , originally seven , but since reduced .
' You are such a waspish , raspish , ill-conditioned chap , you see , ' said <NAME> , ' that even your own Union , the men who know you best , will have nothing to do with you .
<NAME> <NAME> accompanied this speech with a jerk at his little companion 's wrist ; <NAME> , quickening his pace into a kind of trot between a fast walk and a run , kept up with the rapid strides of the house-breaker as well as he could .
With these words they disappeared down the stairs .
It is the drifting icebergs setting with any current anywhere , that wreck the ships .

Her eyes ( and age had dimmed but little of their brightness ) were attentively upon her young companion .
I have missed the way , and had no one to show it to me .
' I won ' t take ' em , ' said <NAME> .
' Hold your tongue , sir , ' interposed the magistrate , ' or I shall order an officer to remove you. ' ' You may order your officers to do whatever you please , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> ; ' and I have no doubt , from the specimen I have had of the subordination preserved amongst
They are very violent people , the people of the house. ' ' Shall I step upstairs , and pitch into the landlord ? ' inquired <NAME> , ' or keep on ringing the bell , or go and groan on the staircase ?
Ten minutes sufficed for the completion of his toilet , and at the expiration of that time he was by the old gentleman ' s side .
The wind was blowing drearily .
" Gentleman so kind as to act as my solicitor , " says <NAME> .
' After they were married , and there was no help for it , I was one of the first to say that <NAME> must be taken notice of .
I have tracked you through it all , and I tell it you all .
Whenever we part with friends , Mr <NAME> , let us part liberally .
Mr <NAME> was not sure of that .
Your dear friend has need to divert himself with all the acquaintances he can make , seeing what a wife he has .
So , <NAME> remained for the latter purpose , to be presently relieved by <NAME> ; and <NAME> , my aunt , and I , went home with <NAME> .
I hope you will be wiser than that , in a few days .
' You ha ' heard ? ' he said , after a few moments ' silence .
It might be worth knowing what this strange man ' s business was with <NAME> , or <NAME> , or both , at such an unseasonable hour .
To all , Mr <NAME> listened with the modest gravity becoming a confiding young man who knew it all beforehand , and , when it was finished , seriously shook his head .
They heard him mutter , " One Hundred and <NAME> , <NAME> ; " and when he looked about him , it evidently was for the strong fortress-walls which had long encompassed him .
He whiffed the compound of scents away , as he put down his smoked-out pipe .
<NAME> <NAME> , as usual , was not forgotten .
' Do you smoke ? ' asked <NAME> , when they came to the hotel .
It still seems as if a false note were not within his power to-night , and as if nothing could hurry or retard him .
" Well , <NAME> , " said I as soon as I could begin to be grave with him , " are you beginning to feel more settled now ? "
" Pray take a seat , vile I makes out the affidavit , <NAME> , " says the lawyer. -- " <NAME> ' ee , <NAME> , " says my father , and down he sat , and stared with all his eyes , and his mouth vide open , at the names on the boxes .
He came to the rescue at this point , and said in a consolatory and complimentary voice , " <NAME> , my dear , it is well known that your family feelings are gradually undermining you to the extent of making one of your legs shorter than the other. " " I am not aware , " observed the
' There ' s only ten minutes now , mother , ' said <NAME> when they reached home .
' Where am I ? ' asks Mr Wegg .
As to constructing toys for the <NAME> , out of nothing , he had done that daily .
Robbed in an extraordinary manner .
<NAME> twice , you , <NAME> , if you don ' t want to be crushed .
It seemed to him ( so skilful was <NAME> ) that he was plotting darkly , when he was contriving to do the very thing that <NAME> was plotting to get him to do .
There were two judges in attendance at <NAME> ' s Inn -- one King ' s <NAME> , and one <NAME> Pleas -- and a great deal of business appeared to be transacting before them , if the number of lawyer ' s clerks who were hurrying in and out with bundles of papers , afforded any test .
' The only care she knew , ' returned the daughter , ' was to be beaten , and stinted , and abused sometimes ; and she might have done better without that .
The " sharp female newly-born , and called <NAME> , " was hardly known to him , or to the generality of people , by name .
This is him untoe the sister of which I was uncle by marriage , as her name was <NAME> M'ria from her own mother , let him deny it if he can ! " The waiter seemed convinced that I could not deny it , and that it gave the case a black look .
Travelling was in a troubled state , and the minds of coachmen were unsettled .
With an accuracy which no degree of dexterity or practice could have insured , that unfortunate gentleman bore swiftly down into the centre of the reel , at the very moment when <NAME> was performing a flourish of unparalleled beauty .
<NAME> ' t go on like this , if you please .
<NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' you anticipate my dearest wishes. ' They went out without further discourse ; and <NAME> piloted the new acquaintance who so strongly contrasted with him , to the private red brick dwelling , with the black outside shutters , the green inside blinds , and the black street door up the two
The best kind of amends then for having gone away is to keep away , in my opinion . "
' And you are -- ' He was going to say so lightly clad , but stopped himself in what would have been a reference to her poverty , saying instead , ' And it is so cold. ' Putting the chair from which he had risen nearer to the grate , he made her sit down in it
And both being now in a heated state , they walk on silently for a while to cool down again .
' Dropped , sir , as if she was shot when I told her !
I remember a great wail and cry , and the women hanging about him , and we all standing in the room ; I with a paper in my hand , which <NAME> had given me ; <NAME> , with his vest torn open , his hair wild , his face and lips quite white , and blood trickling
It is not my purpose , in this record , though in all other essentials it is my written memory , to pursue the history of my own fictions .
' Such delicacy as that , I never saw ! ' <NAME> , after feigning to be in a condition of great embarrassment for some minutes , resumed the conversation by entreating Mrs. Nickleby to take no heed of what he had inadvertently said -- to consider him imprudent , rash , injudicious .
She is more likely to feel the loneliness of her situation in travelling , perhaps , than she would be at home .
' Now , I ' ll tell you what , young <NAME> , ' said he : ' the wine shall be kept to wet your whistle when you are story-telling. ' I blushed at the idea , and begged him , in my modesty , not to think of it .
I ' ve took ' em turning many a time , and enjoyed ' em wonderful ! ' On the grateful impulse of the moment , Mr <NAME> kissed <NAME> ' s hand , and then detaching himself from that good creature that he might have room enough for his feelings , threw back his head , opened his
Did n't you hear the cannon last night ? " " Then there was firing ! " he said to himself .
Seventy-six thousand bags of money !
' Good gracious , <NAME> ! ' returned <NAME> ' How very monstrous !
' <NAME> , <NAME> ! ' interrupted <NAME> .
' We know it ' s there ! ' said <NAME> , glaring .
'Oh , Mrs. Corney , what an Angel you are ! '
' Before I say anything else , ' Little <NAME> began , sitting before the pale fire , and raising her eyes again to the face which in its harmonious look of interest , and pity , and protection , she felt to be a mystery far above her in degree , and almost removed beyond her guessing at
He is not to be carried off to-morrow with the rest , they tell him first .
' It ' s far from right that I should do it , ' said Mrs. Gummidge .
Your wife have left me since some minutes .
Then <NAME> blushingly asked me how did I know that , my dear .
" This is a pretty thing , <NAME> ! " said <NAME> , returning with a countenance expressive of grief and despair .
To have the dear sex with us , is to have everything with us. ' ' But you have not imparted to me , ' remarks Veneering , ' what you think of my entering the <NAME> of <NAME> ? ' ' I think , ' rejoins <NAME> , feelingly , ' that it is the best club in
But we mean the same thing , if we knew how to say it , us two mothers does in our poor hearts ! "
' <NAME> knows it , ' said my aunt , laying her hand calmly on my shoulder .
'And <NAME> is a heavy swell ; a n't he , <NAME> ? '
I have never been quit of you since I first saw you .
' Then here ' s your beer , ' said the other man to <NAME> .
After that I sometimes heard <NAME> and her sister mention how regular my accounts were paid , and about twice a year I ventured to write a similar letter .
The dead man disposed of , and the crowd being under the necessity of providing some other entertainment for itself , another brighter genius ( or perhaps the same ) conceived the humour of impeaching casual passers-by , as <NAME> spies , and wreaking vengeance on them .
The ground was measured , and preliminaries arranged .
What would it be to see a woman going by , even though she were going secretly ?
Why the deuce can ' t they come together !
Some of them are large detached houses on the plain above the <NAME> , which were originally designed for hotels ; and in the evening time , when the women and children were leaning over the balconies watching the men as they played at ball and other games upon the grass before the door , they often presented a
I do not think so , and have shown that too .
'Yer doubtful of her , are yer ? '
Besides that all secret men are men soon terrified , here were surely cards enough of one black suit , to justify the holder in growing rather livid as he turned them over .
He was as ill at ease as a gentleman well could be .
<NAME> to your employer ' s business and your own .
' Cod it ' s the best thing a ' ve heerd this twonty year ! ' So saying , and indulging , with more delicacy than might have been expected from him , in another series of loud laughs , for the purpose of avoiding the thanks which <NAME> poured forth , <NAME> set spurs to his horse
Oh , my husband and father , break this long silence .
' I hope so , ' returned the Secretary .
That everyone was sorry for me , and seemed to take a sort of interest in my wanderings ; and that I began to think it would be my fate to cruise about in search of tidings of my boy , until I died. ' ' Began to think as how he was a scientific Flying Dutchman ! '
' I -- I ' m still in pay , <NAME> ' ' And nothing to do , Rob ? ' ' Nothing particular to do just now , <NAME> , but to -- keep my eyes open , ' said the <NAME> , rolling them in a forlorn way .
They followed close upon him , and when he had vainly searched it , brought him home .
You shall read 'em to me , dear boy !
' You don ' t expect it _will_ do ; do you ? ' Defaulter would admit , with a low-spirited ' No , sir , ' having no such expectation .
She was thus engaged , when an exclamation from <NAME> caused her to turn quickly round .
All night there were coaches in my broken sleep , going to wrong places instead of to <NAME> , and having in the traces , now dogs , now cats , now pigs , now men , -- never horses .
She was sure of that .
As the smoke cleared , leaving an awful stillness , it passed out on the air , like the soul of the furious woman whose body lay lifeless on the ground .
Oh , my dear , all those fellows with their tricks and their manners do deceive ! ' With the little fist in full action .
Mrs <NAME> was as innocent as her own mother of any emotion , painful or pleasant , which the sight of him awakened , but as her husband ' s glance made her timid and confused , and uncertain what to do or what was required of her , Mr <NAME> did not fail to assign her embarrassment to
And you are not to suppose that it will entail any interruption or intrusion on you , for that is far from my intention. ' <NAME> replied that he was greatly obliged , and that he thankfully accepted the kind proposal .
' Let ' s have some more , ' said Mr Boffin , hungrily .
" I believe , " returned my guardian , resuming his uneasy walk , " that there is not such another child on earth as yourself . "
There were traces of privation and suffering -- almost of despair -- in his lank and care-worn countenance ; he felt his poverty , for he shrank to the dark side of the staircase as <NAME> approached .
Up <NAME> went , not caring a button for that .
What delusion can this be ?
Oh keep away , keep away , keep away ! ' These pious ejaculations <NAME> uttered with her eyes closed , and her head leaning back against the wall .
I ' m ashamed of such conduct. ' The pony appeared to be touched by this appeal to his feelings , for he trotted on directly , though in a sulky manner , and stopped no more until he came to a door whereon was a brass plate with the words ' Witherden -- Notary. ' Here the old
He said nothing about it all the morning ; but before he went away in the afternoon he called me in , and told me that I need not make myself at all uneasy about his daughter ' s happiness .
' You thought you were a widow , eh ?
' Depend upon it , ' said <NAME> , earnestly , ' if you are not very careful in breaking out the truth to him , he will do some violence upon his uncle or one of these men that will bring some terrible calamity upon his own head , and grief and sorrow to us all. ' '
' Answer me like that , and I won ' t talk to you at all. ' <NAME> looked at him .
cried the boy with a burst of tears .
The defendant , the eldest son , immediately afterwards gave out that his father had destroyed the will ; and no will being found , he entered into possession of the lands in question , and so matters remained for twenty-one years , the whole family during all that time believing that the father had died without a will
' Dear mother , ' he said kindly , ' don ' t you see that if there were really any serious inclination on the part of <NAME> towards <NAME> , and we suffered ourselves for a moment to encourage it , we should be acting a most dishonourable and ungrateful part ?
<NAME> himself had come of age eight months before me .
'Think , dear <NAME> , think what you have heard to-night . '
I shall sink lower , and be worse. " He leaned an elbow on her table , and covered his eyes with his hand .
<NAME> had not improved <NAME> 's temper ; for , as the girl raised him up and led him to a chair , he muttered various curses on her awkwardness , and struck her .
<NAME> , ' said <NAME> ; not sitting upon , or dropping himself into a seat , as any common jackanapes would : but letting himself gradually and slowly down into a chair ; 'Mrs .
Always gay ! ' After which he knocked again .
We went over the side into our boat , and lay at a little distance , to see the ship wafted on her course .
Within , there is one long narrow cabin , the whole length of the boat ; from which the state-rooms open , on both sides .
' <NAME> , <NAME> , ' said Mr Toots .
They were not like the children of the neighbours ; they never made me tremble all over , by setting up shrill noises , and they never mocked me .
' What is it ? ' ' I did not mean , mother , that you should repeat what I have communicated .
' No , he isn ' t , ' replied Mrs. <NAME> ; for the rather stout lady was no other than the quondam relict and sole executrix of the dead-and-gone <NAME> ; ' no , he isn ' t , and I don ' t expect him , either. ' ' I suppose he ' s drivin '
I am sure he loses pleasanter companions than he can find in his own thoughts , either in his mouldy old office , or his dusty chambers .
' Yer lie , I did , ' says Deputy , in his only form of polite contradiction .
The shadow still darkening as he drew near the house , the melancholy room which his father had once occupied , haunted by the appealing face he had himself seen fade away with him when there was no other watcher by the bed , arose before his mind .
At one time she was <NAME> , and at one time she was <NAME> , until we got into a way of mixing the two names together , and now she is always Tattycoram. ' ' Your daughter , ' said the other , when they had taken another silent turn to and fro , and , after standing

He looks upon Kit as an intruder , as one who has obtained admission to that place on false pretences , who has enjoyed a privilege without being duly qualified .
' There she is , ' said <NAME> , stopping short at the door , and wrinkling up his eyebrows as he looked towards <NAME> ; ' there is the woman I ought to have married -- there is the beautiful <NAME> -- there is the female who has all the charms of her sex and none of their
' I dare say he will , if you wish it , ma ' am. ' ' Certainly , ' said <NAME> , as his wife evinced decided symptoms of going off again .
I should have sent ' em up but for his wishing to carry ' em himself .
Mr <NAME> was one blaze of jewellery and buttons ; and he felt the circumstance so strongly , that when he had shaken hands with the <NAME> , and had bowed to Mrs Blimber and <NAME> , he took <NAME> aside , and said , ' What do you think of this , <NAME> ? ' But notwithstanding this
She was handsome ; and if she had ever smiled , would have been ( I used to think ) like an angel -- but she never smiled .
There ' s no answer , but it ' s rather particular and should go by hand .
' <NAME> ! ' replied the <NAME> .
' Do you ? ' ' Very much so. ' Their escort strolled back again , and reported .
This was the signal for a general clamour , which beginning in a low murmur gradually swelled into a great noise in which everybody spoke at once , and all said that she being a young woman had no right to set up her opinions against the experiences of those who knew so much better ; that it was
' No ! ' exclaimed <NAME> , ' I should have said so anywhere. ' ' You ' d have said wrong , ' rejoined <NAME> .

<NAME> -- " ' " Sir -- " ' " I know everything about you , <NAME> ; everything .
The female Bleeding Hearts , when they came for ounces of tea , and hundredweights of talk , gave <NAME> to understand , That how , ma ' am , they had heard from their cousin <NAME> , which worked in the line , that his lady ' s dresses would fill three waggons .
" And I know , " said <NAME> , " I know , my dears , that when we recollect how patient and how mild he was ; although he was a little , little child ; we shall not quarrel easily among ourselves , and forget poor <NAME> in doing it . "

" At all events , <NAME> will work none of its bad influences on <NAME> .
<NAME> to <NAME> across the <NAME> .
The young lady is <NAME> .
I felt this to be very true but was too confused to attend to it .
In an instant what he stood on fell below him , and he was gone .
It would have been , generally speaking , very difficult to have betted on the winner .

Or leastways , you are spending too much for me. ' ' You are rich , sir. ' ' I am not , ' said Mr Boffin .
That there was any Fancy in them demanding to be brought into healthy existence instead of struggling on in convulsions ?
' I ' m a going to <NAME> when I ' ve sold out all , ' said <NAME> , rising with difficulty .
' Why no , ' said Mr Boffin , ' not exactly that ; a sort of a family tie. ' ' Association ? ' the Secretary suggested .
Consequent , will the T ' other Governor be so good as chuck me his name and where he lives ? ' <NAME> , cigar in mouth and pen in hand , tossed him his card .
<NAME> whatever. ' Mr <NAME> gave his reasons for the inquiry .
<NAME> , dead and gone , was my brother-in-law .
' How do you do , <NAME> ? ' said Mrs. Kenwigs .
The houses and tables are elegant ; the hours later and more rakish ; and there is , perhaps , a greater spirit of contention in reference to appearances , and the display of wealth and costly living .
" Old girl , " murmurs <NAME> after a short silence , " will you tell him my opinion ? "
' Come in ! ' cried the little man .
He seemed so unsuspicious of the depths of feeling which she knew must lie below that surface , that she doubted if there could be any such depths in himself .
I went among young women next , and I found them no better .
' You can say ( if you don ' t mind ) " I love you ! " ' answered <NAME> .
There are no grim door-keepers to dole out their tardy civility by the sixpenny-worth ; nor is there , I sincerely believe , any insolence of office of any kind .
I knew that , did I ? "
' Well , <NAME> , ' says the doctor , ' how do you feel ? ' He replies gruffly , ' Nothing to boast on. ' Having , in fact , returned to life in an uncommonly sulky state .

The idea being an alarming one , he scrambled out of bed , and groped his way to the window .
It had nearly winged its flight away .
She had better have made me a beggar than have done this ! ' ' <NAME> what ? ' said <NAME> .

At last he made the discovery that to discharge this highly connected female—to have it in his power to say , ' She was a woman of family , and wanted to stick to me , but I wouldn ' t have it , and got rid of her ' —would be to get the utmost possible amount of
<NAME> lady , when I had read what ' s put in print of <NAME> what has just as much truth in it as if it had been put in print of you—I went straight to the <NAME> to say I knew where <NAME> was , and to give a sure and certain promise that he should be here
The Secretary was as far from being inquisitive or intrusive as Secretary could be , but nothing less than a complete understanding of the whole of the affairs would content him .
The boy glanced , with an anxious and timid expression , at the papers , as if with a sickly hope that one among them might relate to him .

A man with a pervading appearance on him of being inflated like a balloon , and ready to start .
Now , you may give me a kiss , <NAME> , and I should like to give your hair a turn , because it has been dreadfully neglected in my absence. ' R. W. submitted his head to the operator , and the operator went on talking ; at the same time putting separate locks of his hair through

A few -- and these were among the youngest of the children -- slept peacefully on , with smiles upon their faces , dreaming perhaps of home ; but ever and again a deep and heavy sigh , breaking the stillness of the room , announced that some new sleeper had awakened to the misery of another day ;
Towards nine o'clock he smoothed his ruffled aspect , and , presenting as respectable and business-like an exterior as he could overlay his natural self with , issued forth to the occupation of the day .
I should leave off prizing the remembrance that he has done me nothing but good since I have known him , and that he has made a change within me , like -- like the change in the grain of these hands , which were coarse , and cracked , and hard , and brown when I rowed on

I ventured to inquire , generally , before replying , what would happen if the money were not produced .
<NAME> , only for a moment .

Both were too gaudy , too slangey , too odorous of cigars , and too much given to horseflesh ; the latter characteristic being exemplified in the room by its decorations , and in the men by their conversation .

The furniture of the room was old-fashioned and dusty ; and the green baize on the top of the writing-table had lost all its colour , and was as withered and pale as an old pauper .
' A most invaluable woman , that , <NAME> , ' said Squeers when his consort had hurried away , pushing the drudge before her .
<NAME> , that will is dated months before this will .

Mrs. <NAME> burst into a flood of tears .
'No , he do n't , ' sneered <NAME> .
I want to have some talk with you , particularly , and in private .
At first <NAME> was disposed to give his uncle credit for some portion of this bold attempt ( which had so nearly proved successful ) to carry off <NAME> ; but on more mature consideration , he was inclined to think that the full merit of it rested with <NAME> .

<NAME> and privately , it were much better for the age in which he lived , that he and the legion of whom he was one were designedly bad , than indifferent and purposeless .
Well might Mr <NAME> say to Mr Toots , that he was afraid he should be the worse for it to-morrow !
Go and see <NAME> acted .

A moment , and I occupy my place in the <NAME> , where we all went together , every Sunday morning , assembling first at school for that purpose .
' Look out for a fall , my <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
' Poor dear ! ' said Mrs. Cluppins .
' We two have met before -- ' ' Surely , ' cried <NAME> , nodding his head .
Perhaps it ' s part of the philosophy of dreams that one never does .
There , too , among unusual bottle-racks and pale slants of light from the yard above , was the strong room stored with old ledgers , which had as musty and corrupt a smell as if they were regularly balanced , in the dead small hours , by a nightly resurrection of old book-keepers .
I ca n't say ; but , for anything I CAN say , he may go for the purpose -- though he do n't know it -- of employing my thoughts as I lie here .
Having arrived at this conclusion , he betook himself to the tap .
Why are we not more natural ?
I go , in this instant of time ! ' ' Not a word to any one but me , Cavalletto. ' ' Al-tro ! ' cried <NAME> .
said the old man , laying aside the chalk .
He also caused to be erected , in the same mouldy cabin , an old ship ' s stove with a rusty funnel to carry the smoke through the roof ; and these arrangements completed , surveyed them with ineffable delight .
' Now , <NAME> , ' he said -- and I saw that cast again as he said it -- ' you must be far more careful today than usual. ' He gave the cane another poise , and another switch ; and having finished his preparation of it , laid it down beside him , with an impressive
Tell me , forsooth ! ' She affects not to know that his eyes are fastened on her as she droops her head again ; but her whole figure reveals that she knows it uneasily .
<NAME> , sir , my resolution is ( call it weakness or folly if you please ) to wrong no one . "
That won ' t do for me -- no , no , nor for you .
<NAME> , will you have the goodness to come here a moment , my dear ? '
sobbed <NAME> , quite forgetful of her general complainings and of everything but her natural affection .
' If I was ever to be a lady , I ' d give him a sky-blue coat with diamond buttons , nankeen trousers , a red velvet waistcoat , a cocked hat , a large gold watch , a silver pipe , and a box of money. ' I said I had no doubt that <NAME> well deserved
You may have them , Sam. ' ' Thank ' ee , <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> .
In his disturbed recollection of that night when he was striving against the drugged drink , there was but a dim image of <NAME> ' s person ; but he remembered his name , and his manner of speaking , and how he had gone with them to view the body , and where he had stood , and
' Hope I see you well , Miss. ' ' Is that my brother ? ' asked the child , pointing to the <NAME> .
' Oh , what a weary boy ! ' said Dora one night , when I met her eyes as I was shutting up my desk .
In some visits to the Jumble his attention had been attracted to this boy <NAME> .
He held as straight a course for the house of the dolls ' dressmaker as the wisdom of his ancestors , exemplified in the construction of the intervening streets , would let him , and walked with a bent head hammering at one fixed idea .
'Very cold , indeed , sir , ' replied the mistress , in her most civil tones , and dropping a curtsey as she spoke .
" Well , my dear <NAME> , " said Mrs. Jellyby , " you know best , I dare say .
For you can never know what an extraordinary woman that is. ' Mr <NAME> was willing to take it for granted .
In the note I wrote to <NAME> , I bitterly quoted this sentiment .
I think it was almost the first time in my life when I fell into this train of reflection -- how will many things that are familiar , and quite matters of course to us now , look , when we come to see them from that new and distant point of view which we must all take up
<NAME> <NAME> , looking at him steadily ( Mr <NAME> looked full as steadily at the <NAME> ) , went out of the office and left him standing astride before the fire , as calm and pleasant as if there were no more spots upon his soul than on his pure white linen , and his smooth sleek skin
I take my allowance and my certain weight of coals .
I ' ll be back directly. ' ' You seem to say you know a great deal , mother , ' said the daughter , following her to the door with her eyes .

I have never forgotten them or his quiet smile , but have seen them every day , side by side with those of my own dear children , dead and gone since I was a lightsome young creature . '
Mr <NAME> , <NAME> , is fortunate enough to have your friendship .
This consisted of a long hammer-headed old horse , formerly used in the business , attached to a four-wheeled chaise of the same period , which had long been exclusively used by the <NAME> poultry as the favourite laying-place of several discreet hens .
YOU know better than that , at all events .
He has seen my solitary , lingering death. ' He folded his hands , and murmuring something more they could not hear , fell into a sleep -- only a sleep at first , for they saw him smile .
I am happy in the sight of you .
Now let me think. ' ( as if there were the least necessity ) ' Yes , to be sure I do , Mr Boffin .
' Are you subject to bile , <NAME> ? ' Mr Wegg again replied , with strict adherence to truth , that he didn ' t think he had ever had a similar sensation in his head , to anything like the same extent .
' No. ' They both lapsed into silence , with their eyes upon the fire .
I -- ha hum -- I gave my family a position there .
The same room certainly , and still by candlelight ; but with what unbounded astonishment did he see all those bottles , and basins , and articles of linen airing by the fire , and such-like furniture of a sick chamber -- all very clean and neat , but all quite different from anything he had left there ,
He could descry objects enough at such times , but none correctly .
'The gold I stole was -- ' 'Yes , yes -- what ? '
<NAME> tumuli of oyster shells in the oyster season , and of lobster shells in the lobster season , and of broken crockery and faded cabbage leaves in all seasons , encroached upon its high places .
I would rather , if I may. ' Her earnestness was so expressive of her being uneasy without her work , that <NAME> answered , ' Well my dear whatever you like best , ' and produced a basket of white handkerchiefs .
We ' re never out of a wearing subject , my dear , I assure you .
' <NAME> pounds a year , ' replied <NAME> .
Since then , darling , I have seen them often .
' Why , what is the matter with the little old gentleman ? ' said <NAME> .
The fact is , there ' s more to do than there used to be , and the Works are enough for me as I grow older .
In the silence of the night , too ! '
Your request is granted , friend. ' After more kind words , they withdrew , and repaired to the child ' s house ; where they were yet in conversation on their happy fortune , when another friend appeared .
His hair and whiskers were blacker and thicker , looked at so near , than even I had given them credit for being .
For I called to mind now , that she was equally accomplished in the terms of our trade , and the names of our different sorts of work , and our various tools .
Notwithstanding the difference between youth and age , he bore so strong a likeness to the old lady , that <NAME> would have had no great difficulty in imagining their relationship , if he had not already spoken of her as his mother .
' It would come dearer , ' Mr <NAME> returned .
If the <NAME> demands sacrifices from you , without doubt you as a good patriot will be happy to make them .
' If they all go to bed , why I must go .
When I walked alone in the fine weather , and thought of the summer days when all the air had been filled with my boyish enchantment , I did miss something of the realization of my dreams ; but I thought it was a softened glory of the <NAME> , which nothing could have thrown upon the present time
" Without any clue to anything more ? "
If <NAME> , <NAME> thought , had but sent such courage and skill to her poor mother ' s aid !
He looked robust in body .
My <NAME> was too high for me ; I was too high for her .
He asked his partner to explain the invention to him ; ' having a lenient consideration , ' he stipulated , ' for my being no workman , Doyce. ' ' No workman ? ' said <NAME> .
I humbly pray to God in heaven. ' It sounded like the prayer of a broken heart .
<NAME> <NAME> held decidedly to the general principle , that if you could steal a march upon a brigand or a wild beast , you had better do it ; and he also held decidedly to the special case , that <NAME> was a brigand and a wild beast in combination .
' Well ! ' says the <NAME> , looking about him to see what has become of his copyist : ' I hope , <NAME> , you will use your study and knowledge of <NAME> to the good purpose of exhorting him not to break our worthy and respected Choir-Master ' s neck ; we can not afford it
' You ' re quite right , sir , quite right .
<NAME> happened , however , worse than morning .
Its ancient walls were massive , and its rooms rather seemed to have been dug out of them , than to have been designed beforehand with any reference to them .
You might have asked Mr <NAME> himself ( if you have not done so ) whether he claims to be , or is , an object of such strong interest. ' ' <NAME> , do me justice , ' said his brother .
He had a white rabbit in his breast ; and when the little creature , getting down upon the ground , stole back into the cell , and he , being dismissed , crept timidly after it , I thought it would have been very hard to say in what respect the man was the nobler animal of the
<NAME> was recommended to me by a professional friend .
' The meaning of that term -- gammon , ' said <NAME> , ' is unknown to me .
Meanwhile , <NAME> and his friends having walked their blood into active circulation , proceeded cheerfully on .
I can think of nothing .
" Your qualities are not shining , my dear child , but they are steady and useful .
<NAME> <NAME> left his chair , walked straight up to the other end of the table , and fell upon him -- literally fell upon him -- instantaneously .
His whole existence was a scuffle .
But somehow she wants heart .
<NAME> ' t it -- dear <NAME> ? ' There was an engaging shyness in <NAME> , coupled with an engaging tenderness of love and confidence and pride , in thus first calling him by name , which made it quite excusable in <NAME> to do what he did .
I assure you I have no idea what foundation for it there may be .
' You seem to be setting up for lively. ' This circumstance appeared , in his then state of mind , to give Mr Wegg uncommon offence .
' No , no , no , ' said <NAME> ' How can you !
I could have done you no harm , if you had done yourself none. " " You 're a liar .
' Winter came , and with it weeks of cold and heavy rain .
" They called him what he had called himself , but no one knew his name . "
' Why , I don ' t rightly know about to-night , ' replied the stout turnkey .
I want you for that . "
But , looking up at his face in the interchange of the first few common-places , she observed a change in it .
' Well , my dear , ' said Mrs. Gradgrind , ' and I hope you are going on satisfactorily to yourself .
If , ' said <NAME> -- ' if there is any one of them less odious than another , it is the liquor called rum .
' I think I am a little nervous this morning , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
I do not mind them -- I mind nothing but my grief -- and yet I see and know them all ; and even in the background , far away , see <NAME> looking on , and her eye glancing on her sweetheart , who is near me .
He seemed about five-and-twenty years of age , and was of the middle height ; his countenance was frank and handsome ; and his demeanor easy and prepossessing .
'Man or woman , pray , sir ? '
You 'll get nothing. " " No indeed , <NAME> .
'Young lady , ' said <NAME> , turning to <NAME> , 'give me your hand .
What does my brother mean to do ?
<NAME> have done ; but did not .
Before they had done thanking him , he spread a coarse white cloth upon the table , with knives and platters ; and bringing out some bread and cold meat and a jug of beer , besought them to eat and drink .
This , it occurred to <NAME> , must be <NAME> for going out ; for directly afterwards , the <NAME> , and <NAME> , and the two young ladies , went away together , having been kindly furnished by the amiable old Jew with money to spend .
returned <NAME> with his gay laugh .
At this , the nearest stone face seemed to stare amazed , and , with open mouth and dropped under-jaw , looked awe-stricken .
The old man was ready , and in a few seconds they were on their road .
" Thank you , miss , " said <NAME> .
To one of them I owe my knowledge and my proofs -- I repeat it , estimable lady -- proofs -- of the ravishing little family history I go to commence .
<NAME> night ! ' He was unwilling to let me go ; and stood , holding me out , with a hand on each of my shoulders , as he had done in my own room .
That my mother had fled , that a person was now at our door who was empowered to convey to her the fullest assurances of affectionate protection and forgiveness if he could possibly find her , and that I was sought for to accompany him in the hope that my entreaties might prevail upon her if his failed .
If <NAME> was only half as far gone , that was the greatest of all the miracles. ' ' Halloa ! ' cried Mortimer , turning round with his hat upon his head , ' you seem to be at home in the <NAME> , my young friend ? ' ' Read of it with teacher at the school
' It was plain to those who looked upon the mother ' s altered face , that death must soon close the scene of her adversity and trial .
<NAME> , <NAME> ' s opinion was that we all had our eyes -- or at least a large majority of us -- and that -- and -- and his farther opinion was several ands , with nothing beyond them .
For only one night ' s view of the pale phantoms rising from the scenes of our too-long neglect ; and from the thick and sullen air where Vice and Fever propagate together , raining the tremendous social retributions which are ever pouring down , and ever coming thicker !
So let be. ' He had moved away a pace or two to come down from the platform , when he remembered something he had not said , and returned again .
" I can attest your fidelity , sir . "
<NAME> <NAME> did not join them at dinner , but remained in a separate room .
And now , for the first time , <NAME> , well-nigh mad with grief and terror , saw that housebreaking and robbery , if not murder , were the objects of the expedition .
Afterwards , <NAME> and I played at cards , as of yore , -- only we were skilful now , and played <NAME> games , -- and so the evening wore away , and I went to bed .
And he added , turning to me , " It would be doing him a very bad service , my dear , to shut our eyes to the truth in any of these respects . "
The floor was covered with a rich carpet ; and two superb mirrors , one above the chimneypiece and one at the opposite end of the room reaching from floor to ceiling , multiplied the other beauties and added new ones of their own to enhance the general effect .
He was nursing the baby , and appeared to be a benignant member of society .
It is better for those young men , in every point of view , that they should not remain here .
For <NAME> ' s sake come ! ' Perhaps , at , another time , <NAME> ' s obstinacy and dislike would have been proof against any appeal from such a quarter , however emphatically urged ; but now , after a moment ' s hesitation , he went into the hall for his hat , and returning ,
May Heaven grant it to you , too , and comfort you ! ' She answered not a word .
' He shall be an object to me , sir , at twelve paces , and a pretty object I ' ll make of him , sir -- a mean-spirited scoundrel ! ' This , as it stood , was a very pretty denunciation , and magnanimous withal ; but <NAME> rather weakened its effect , by winding up
The Porter at the iron gate which shut the court-yard from the street , had left the little wicket of his house open , and was gone away ; no doubt to mingle in the distant noise at the door of the great staircase .
Gentlemen , my uncle opened his eyes so wide at all this , that , to the very last moment of his life , he used to wonder how it fell out that he had ever been able to shut ' em again .
What are you doing there ? "
" But it must have been this morning , I think , " said I .
He had been so different , <NAME> .
The staircase was as wooden and solid as need be , and <NAME> went straight down it without any of those deviations peculiar to dreams .
'What business is it of yours ? '
Why , damme , now , the girls 's whining again ! '
They jump and start , as I cough and cough , like live things .
She is here. ' ' Here ? ' ' My dear Bounderby , let me beg you to restrain these loud out-breaks , on all accounts .
This treasure , as in duty bound , I laid at the feet of <NAME> , and begged him to dispense .
I must have some place that I can call a home ; it will be wherever she is , you know , and may be a very humble one. ' ' May be ! ' said <NAME> , walking faster , in the impatience provoked by the remark ; ' must be , you mean .
My mama -- hem -- was the most lovely and beautiful creature , with the most striking and exquisite -- hem -- the most exquisite nose that ever was put upon a human face , I do believe , <NAME> ( here <NAME> rubbed her own nose sympathetically ) ; the most delightful and accomplished woman , perhaps ,
Though it was evidently in the grain of his character , and of his respect for his own case , that he should abstain from idle murmuring , it was evident that he had grown the older , the sterner , and the poorer , for his long endeavour .
There was such a solemn stillness round the bed ; and the two medical attendants seemed to look on the impassive form with so much compassion and so little hope , that <NAME> was for the moment diverted from her purpose .
I loved her none the less ; I thought of her as the same benignant , gentle angel in my life ; I reproached myself , not her , with having done him an injury ; and I would have made him any atonement if I had known what to make , and how to make it .
To everybody in succession , <NAME> said : ' Have you read it ? ' -- ' No. ' -- - ' Would you like to hear it read ? ' If he weakly showed the least disposition to hear it , <NAME> , in a loud sonorous voice , gave him every word of it .
" I know you do , " said the stranger ; " I knew you would .
And ever more so ( Mr <NAME> added , with some degree of obscurity , ) and never more so , than in and through what had passed .
A strong feeling for the beauties of nature , as displayed in the solitudes the writers have left at home , breathes through its pages like wholesome village air ; and though a circulating library is a favourable school for the study of such topics , it has very scant allusion to fine clothes , fine marriages , fine
I waltz with the eldest Miss Larkins !
He who was the <NAME> in years , and <NAME> in the <NAME> , stood , with his eyes cast upon the ground , and his head bowed , humbly listening to the reproaches of the other .
Of course , I was perfectly sure and safe that <NAME> had not been there .

Boxes are packed , cabs fetched , and at dusk that evening there is not one member of the party left .
' Would you give <NAME> B. the go-by , <NAME> ' am ?
I have sunk , from the prime of life into old age , in this place , and there is not one to raise his hand above my bed when I lie dead upon it , and say , " It is a blessing he is gone ! " ' The excitement , which had cast an unwonted light
It was a wet morning , and very misty , and we soon lost sight of land .
' Meaning <NAME> , sir ? ' said the literary gentleman .
' Five or six years passed away ; the boy had become a robust and well- grown youth .
inquired my guardian , rubbing his head , a little at a loss .
" It is natural to such a man to be so , " says <NAME> , looking most profoundly obstinate himself .
I am perfectly aware of that .
I stopped that though -- ha ha ha !
" <NAME> , look upon the prisoner. " To be confronted with such pity , and such earnest youth and beauty , was far more trying to the accused than to be confronted with all the crowd .
<NAME> followed the old man downstairs , with a candle .
He will give you almost as many men as you like at draughts , and beat you easily. ' <NAME> gave his head another toss , as much as to say : ' Of course he will. ' ' He is such a speaker , ' I pursued , ' that he can win anybody over ; and I
If I doen ' t find her , maybe she ' ll come to hear , sometime , as her loving uncle only ended his search for her when he ended his life ; and if I know her , even that will turn her home at last ! ' As he went out into the rigorous night ,
I couldn ' t undo what was done ; and when he begs and prays , " Old pardner , on my knees , don ' t split upon me ! " I only makes answer " Never speak another word to <NAME> , nor look him in the face ! " and I shuns that man. ' Having
But I encouraged <NAME> at the time .

I rambled downstairs to find anything that was like itself , so altered it all seemed ; and roamed into the yard .
His voice is as clear as a bell or a musical glass -- very like a musical glass indeed -- but of course I didn ' t listen to it .
With no more definite purpose than to escape the hazard of originating any other kind of action .
The waters are out in <NAME> .
" Everything is ready for you , Esther , " said <NAME> , " and the scheme of your pursuits has been arranged in exact accordance with the wishes of your guardian , Mr .
It was so clearly expressed in Mr <NAME> ' s face , that the <NAME> apologised .

' But -- but -- you don ' t think she ' s coming just yet , do you ? ' ' Why , I suppose she ' ll not come till she is obliged , ' returned <NAME> , looking at his watch , ' and she has a good half-hour to spare yet .

Mathematics ? ' ' I never heerd it called that .
If you should happen to have looked in to-night , for the purpose of telling him that you were going to do her any little service , ' said <NAME> , stroking his face again , and repeating his look , ' it would be very fortunate and well-timed ; very fortunate and well-timed. ' ' On the contrary
' Poor fellow ! ' ' I scarcely ever hear you , my dear , ' retorted Mrs. Nickleby ; ' that ' s all I ' ve got to say. ' By this time the good lady had been a long while upon one topic , so she fell at once into her daughter ' s little trap
' I should be very sorry , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' to create any unpleasantness at any friend ' s table , and much less at yours , <NAME> -- very ; but I must take this opportunity of informing <NAME> that he is no gentleman. ' ' And I should be very sorry , <NAME>

I saw a man examined as a witness in Westminster Hall .

But I do n't mind them. " " See !
You would wish me to say , <NAME> , ' added <NAME> , after a moment ' s hesitation , ' exactly what it is I want .
I must not forget that we went on board the yacht , where they all three descended into the cabin , and were busy with some papers .
Yet , the spectacle of only one little mourner hobbling after , caused many people to turn their heads with a look of interest .
As to being ill , you will find many young people in worse case than I am .
exclaimed the <NAME> , " would you so soon put out , with worldly hands , the light I give ?
' Yes , ' he said , with a faint smile , ' it was the same when I was quite a baby , and crawled about it , till I fell asleep .
Mrs. Bagnet ceasing , <NAME> removes his hand from his head as if the shower-bath were over and looks disconsolately at <NAME> , who has turned quite white and looks distressfully at the grey cloak and straw bonnet .

<NAME> , who appeared desirous of gaining time , recounted them at great length , and with much circumlocution .
" <NAME> lost both her parents ? "

<NAME> <NAME> was soon roused , and soon undrew the bolt and let him in .
' Oh , she ' s gone away , ' said the old gentleman .
' It would be better to be this poor Peggotty , or his lout of a nephew , ' he said , getting up and leaning moodily against the chimney-piece , with his face towards the fire , ' than to be myself , twenty times richer and twenty times wiser , and be the torment to myself that
Every morning when he wakes , he hides his head beneath the coverlet , and shudders to see the ghastly ceiling looking down upon him .
There were the old signs , the old names over the shops , the old people serving in them .
Her lord being cherubic , she was necessarily majestic , according to the principle which matrimonially unites contrasts .
' Next week , ' said <NAME> , ' you will cease to be alone , and will have a devoted companion. ' ' And yet , ' returned <NAME> , ' this seems an uncongenial place to bring my sister to. ' ' I don ' t think so , ' said the <NAME> .
A superficial traveller might object to the dirt , which is their leading characteristic ; but to those who view it as an indication of traffic and commercial prosperity , it is truly gratifying. ' Punctual to five o ' clock came the stranger , and shortly afterwards the dinner .
And now that the cloud settled on <NAME> , which a momentary gleam had driven from his sacred countenance , the darkness of it was heavy -- cold , dirt , sickness , ignorance , and want , were the lords in waiting on the saintly presence -- nobles of great power all of them ; but , most

You would have a very mean opinion of a Manchester man if he spun cotton for no other purpose .

Can I use it ? ' They had walked along the <NAME> , and into <NAME> , and had turned up-hill towards <NAME> ; <NAME> waiting on the pace and lead of <NAME> , and leaving him to indicate the course .
" They ai n't worth much , then .
I had never hoped for this .
" Yes ; so they tell me .
What would they say , who made so light of money , if they could know how I had scraped my halfpence together , for the purchase of my daily saveloy and beer , or my slices of pudding ?
" Yes , thank you. " " Come , then !
' <NAME> , slave , slave , from morning to night , ' pursued the person of the house , ' and all for this !

six and six is twelve , and six eighteen -- so -- we must make the most of it .
' It ' s a very muscular one for a child ' s. ' Is it ? ' inquired <NAME> carelessly .
No , <NAME> , I ' ll be pulled through by Mother. ' They would do best by themselves perhaps , after all , <NAME> thought ; therefore did not press his proposal .
What a delicious atmosphere ! ' If Mr <NAME> spoke figuratively , and meant to imply that the air breathed by <NAME> was sweetened and rarefied by that dainty creature , he had doubtless good reason for what he said .

So on , from year to year , through a service of ten years , till I began to get older , and to ask myself why should I ever write . "
He is clear that every such person wants to depose him .
I stimulated myself into such a heat , and got so out of breath , that I felt as if I had been earning I don ' t know how much .
But I don ' t want them. ' ' Again , ' he pursued , ' we are now walking through the muddy streets .
We had got to the top of <NAME> before I knew that it was merely a mechanical appearance , and that he was not smiling at all .

Here was <NAME> on the same day , and in the same hour , sitting thoughtful in his own room .

My late experiences with <NAME> and Mrs. Micawber suggested to me that here might be a means of keeping off the wolf for a little while .
It would be very disagreeable to be stared at by all the people here. " " Mr .
In stating that I shall be ( D. V. ) on the outside of the south wall of that place of incarceration on civil process , the day after tomorrow , at seven in the evening , precisely , my object in this epistolary communication is accomplished .
I am so glad , yet so sorry ! ' creeping closer to me , and folding me in both her arms .
I assure you <NAME> is directing works and executing labours over yonder , that it would make your hair stand on end to look at .
<NAME> doesn ' t change us more than life , my dear. ' ' Do you come here often ? ' asked the child .
Still , that <NAME> might be thinking -- for me , though I had abandoned all such thoughts -- of what once was , but was now all changed , seemed so easy to believe that I believed it .
But the stratagem hardly succeeded as well as it deserved ; for the smallest boy but one divining her intent , immediately began swarming upstairs after her -- if that word of doubtful etymology be admissible -- on his arms and legs ; while the eldest ( known in the family by the name of <NAME> , in remembrance
In the moment of its dissolution , and of his first full knowledge of his influence upon her , she dropped , and he caught her on his arm .
' Oh dear , yes ! ' said the <NAME> ; ' <NAME> ' s quite well , and she ' ll be delighted to see you .
' Wot are them gen ' l ' men a-settin ' behind the counters ? ' asked the hoarse coachman .
It crept along the passage until it came to the very door she longed so ardently to reach .
' Are you a stranger in this place ? ' asked <NAME> .
Keep it , or publish it to the world , if you like. ' ' I can ' t do that , ' interposed <NAME> .
" Very well observed , my boy ! "
If I came into the room where they were , and they were talking together and my mother seemed cheerful , an anxious cloud would steal over her face from the moment of my entrance .
I so far go along with them for a novelty , that <NAME> ' ll have nothing to do with you either. ' <NAME> raised his eyes quickly to his face .
' Now hand up the teapot for a little more hot water , and a pinch of fresh tea , and then both of you eat and drink as much as you can , and don ' t spare anything ; that ' s all I ask of you. ' They might perhaps have carried out the lady '
For which , ' aside to Mr Toots , ' you ' ll overhaul your <NAME> and <NAME> , brother. ' ' I shall make a point of doing so , <NAME> , ' said Mr Toots .
<NAME> <NAME> , I wish you good night .
Give me a kiss because it ' s <NAME> ' s birthday. ' ' I ' d Pussy you , young man , if I was <NAME> , as you call her , ' Mrs. Tope blushingly retorts , after being saluted .
'They 're _so_ happy , _so_ frolicsome , and _so_ cheerful , that they are quite companions for me . '
' My little friend is destined for a public school , I presume , Mr Dombey ? ' said the Major when he had recovered .
But I believe that this gentleman is a considerate and excellent master , who inherited his fifty slaves , and is neither a buyer nor a seller of human stock ; and I am sure , from my own observation and conviction , that he is a kind-hearted , worthy man .
' I don ' t regret having done what was honourable and right , of course ; but I do regret that this should have ever happened -- at least sometimes I regret it , and sometimes I -- I don ' t know what I say ; I am but a weak girl , <NAME> , and it
' I knew you would be , ' said <NAME> .
Perhaps she had followed the current of my mind ; for it seemed to me an easy one to track now , wilful as it had been once .
It was such a wonderful thing , at first , to have her coming softly down to talk to me as I ate my supper .
' Your definition of a horse. ' ' Quadruped .
I begin to see now , " she says , " ven it ' s too late , that if a married ' ooman vishes to be religious , she should begin vith dischargin ' her dooties at home , and makin ' them as is about her cheerful and happy , and that vile she goes to church
Now the housekeeper was at that time clearing the table ; my guardian , taking no heed of her , but with the side of his face turned from her , was leaning back in his chair biting the side of his forefinger and showing an interest in <NAME> , that , to me , was quite inexplicable .
' You are working late tonight , <NAME> , ' says I .
The scene was <NAME> 's private lodging in Hanging-sword-alley , <NAME> : the time , half-past seven of the clock on a windy March morning , <NAME> seventeen hundred and eighty .
" You called her <NAME> , did n't you ?
But if I had mine , " glancing at the cousins , " there should be no brambles of sordid realities in such a path as that .
An indescribable character of faded gentility that attached to the house I sought , and made it unlike all the other houses in the street -- though they were all built on one monotonous pattern , and looked like the early copies of a blundering boy who was learning to make houses , and had not yet got out
" And in his last breath reproached me for stooping to a boor ! " " There is no doubt you do , " said I , something hurriedly , " for I have seen you give him looks and smiles this very night , such as you never give to -- me. " " Do you want me
Creeping and crawling and gliding , like a ugly , old , <NAME> , stagnation-blooded adder !
The consequences were uproarious beyond belief ; but no one seemed to care ; on the contrary , the mother and daughter laughed heartily , and enjoyed it very much ; and the latter , soon beginning to mingle in the sports , got pillaged by the young brigands most ruthlessly .
But as I was used to sit beside <NAME> whenever I entered that place of resort , I said " No , thank you , sir , " and fell into the space <NAME> made for me on the opposite settle .
Elbow-chairs there were , but they looked uneasy in their minds , cocked their arms suspiciously and timidly , and kept upon their guard .
' WELL , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , in his windy manner , ' what ' s this I hear ?
Full of this idea , the scientific gentleman seized his pen again , and committed to paper sundry notes of these unparalleled appearances , with the date , day , hour , minute , and precise second at which they were visible : all of which were to form the data of a voluminous treatise of great research and
" The muffled drums , " said <NAME> , turning to <NAME> and me and gravely shaking his head .
Right for all that , ' said <NAME> , stopping in his roar , and smiting his hands together ; ' fur here she is ! ' It was only Ham .
I mourned for the broken heart that had found rest in the stormy sea ; and for the wandering remnants of the simple home , where I had heard the night-wind blowing , when I was a child .
Painted wed , with a cweam piebald. ' ' With a real box for the letters , and all complete , ' said the <NAME> <NAME> .
Just as I am getting on ! " " The gracious and merciful Heavens forbid ! " cried <NAME> .
My pa begs that if he comes to you the ring may be returned , and that you will let the thief and assassin go , as if we prosecuted him he would only be transported , and if he is let go he is sure to be hung before long which will save us trouble and be much
But the principle always failed us by some curious fatality , and we never could hit any medium between redness and cinders .
Not only did his weary watch keep pace with every present point that every day presented to him in some new form , but in the midst of these engrossing occupations he found leisure -- that is , he made it -- to review the past transactions of the <NAME> , and his share in them , during a
' I ' m very well indeed , ' said Mr Toots , taking a chair .
In the midst of the dreary scene , the <NAME> , cast away upon his island , looked round on the waste of waters with a rueful countenance , and seemed waiting for some friendly bark to come that way , and take him off .
People like you , ma ' am , accustomed from infancy to lie on <NAME> feathers , have no idea _how_ hard a paving-stone is , without trying it .
Convinced at last that for the present all such attempts were hopeless , he appointed two or three scouts , with promises of large rewards in case of their forwarding him any intelligence , and returned to <NAME> by next day ' s coach .
Mr F. ' s <NAME> , after regarding the company for ten minutes with a malevolent gaze , delivered the following fearful remark : ' When we lived at <NAME> , <NAME> ' s gander was stole by tinkers. ' Mr Pancks courageously nodded his head and said , ' All right , ma ' am. ' But the
But I could not remember where .
It ' s <NAME> ' l ! " and I went in .
That wonder was in its turn swallowed up on the greater wonder with which he saw them stop at the <NAME> door .
' I ' m wery sorry , <NAME> , ' said the elder <NAME> , shaking up the ale , by describing small circles with the pot , preparatory to drinking .
' In the days of old , <NAME> , treated of in this commentary , there were pious men , beloved of the <NAME> , who would have cursed their sons for less than this : who would have sent them forth , and sent whole nations forth , if such had supported them , to be avoided of
Where good people turn into bright angels , and fly away to <NAME> ! ' The child , who had dropped her head , raised it again , and sat looking at her intently .
I have known him do it , " says <NAME> incautiously , " twenty times . "
' Ah ! ' Having given utterance to these ejaculations with a very profound and thoughtful air , <NAME> slowly snuffed two kitchen candles on the counter , and two more in the window , and then snuffed himself from a box in his waistcoat pocket .
I stayed to dine at a decent alehouse , some mile or two from the Ferry I have mentioned before ; and thus the day wore away , and it was evening when I reached it .
They knitted worthless things ; but , the mechanical work was a mechanical substitute for eating and drinking ; the hands moved for the jaws and the digestive apparatus : if the bony fingers had been still , the stomachs would have been more famine-pinched .
We sit down at table again ( rather more cheerfully than before ) ; prolong the meal with a rather mouldy dessert of apples , grapes , and oranges ; and drink our wine and brandy-and-water .
Many of those pigs live here .
" My children , " said <NAME> , paternally encircling <NAME> with his left arm as she sat beside him , and putting his right hand gracefully on his hip .
' I tell you what , sir ; there are a hundred fathers , within a circuit of five miles from this place ; well off ; good , rich , substantial men ; who would gladly give their daughters , and their own ears with them , to that very man yonder , ape and mummy as he
Ha -- Mrs General ! ' The entrance of the lady whom he announced , to take her place at the breakfast-table , terminated the discussion .
And if we should get deaf , or lame , or blind , or bed-ridden , how glad we shall be that we have somebody we are fond of , always to talk to and sit with !
I humbly hope it ; but I daren ' t believe it .
He was short of his age : with rather bow-legs , and little , sharp , ugly eyes .
It is but a whim of mine .
He had often heard the old men in the workhouse , too , say that no lad of spirit need want in <NAME> ; and that there were ways of living in that vast city , which those who had been bred up in country parts had no idea of .
<NAME> and lighter , until at last the sun touched the tops of the still trees , and poured its radiance over the hill .
Further , in place of remembering that compact made between them for an avoidance of the subject , she constantly alluded to her daughter ' s marriage as a proof of her being an incomparable mother ; and all this , with the weakness and peevishness of such a state , always serving for a sarcastic commentary on her
And yet , to the old man ' s vision , <NAME> was still the same .
' We will take one more turn before going in , ' said <NAME> , ' for I want to ask you a question .
When she left off -- and she had not laughed languidly , but with real enjoyment -- I said , in my diffident way with her , -- " I hope I may suppose that you would not be amused if they did me any harm. " " No , no you may be sure of that , "
Avoiding , as much as was possible , all the main streets , and skulking only through the by-ways and alleys , he at length emerged on <NAME> .
It ' s quite true that you did object to names being used , and they ' re always best avoided. ' ' Please to remember that I have a charge here , ' said Mrs. Sparsit , with her air of state .
They are of a greasy and mildewed appearance ; and if they can be said to have any vices at all , perhaps drinking and cheating are the most conspicuous among them .
' <NAME> far is it to the next stage ? ' inquired <NAME> , of one of the boys .
I want to be told all about it .
She was quite satisfied that a good deal was effected by this make-belief of housekeeping ; and was as merry as if we had been keeping a baby-house , for a joke .
The tea-things , including a bottle of rather suspicious character and a cold knuckle of ham , were set forth upon a drum , covered with a white napkin ; and there , as if at the most convenient round-table in all the world , sat this roving lady , taking her tea and enjoying the prospect .
Oh no ! ' These were the last words spoken by the whelp , before a giddy drowsiness came upon him , followed by complete oblivion .
It may have been the cheering , or it may have happened sooner .
It ' s all ready for cooking , and only been waiting for you .
' And , " pretty. " ' ' No , no , it was never pretty .
Then they whispered and laughed for a long time about there being no danger if it was well done , and then Mr <NAME> pulls out his pocket-book , and says , " Well , " he says , " here it is -- <NAME> ' s own five-pound note .
It ' s my intent to be a gentleman .
' I wonder at that , ' said the manager .
As it rained after dinner , and they couldn ' t go out walking on the beach , and <NAME> ' s constitution required rest after chops , they went away with <NAME> ( otherwise <NAME> ) to the <NAME> ; an empty room looking out upon a chalk wall and a water-butt , and made ghastly by a
The real hues are delicate , and need a clearer vision .
He raised <NAME> ' s tumbler to his lips and drank off its contents .
' I hope I have not hurt you ! '
' She ' s a-blowing off her steam , <NAME> , and that ' s what makes the fog and the noise worse , don ' t you see ? ' explained another .
Many were the colloquies into which <NAME> entered with grooms who were airing horses on roads , and nursemaids who were airing children in lanes ; but nothing could Sam elicit from either the first- mentioned or the last , which bore the slightest reference to the object of his artfully-prosecuted inquiries .
One barrel-organ and a dancing-monkey—sportive by nature , but fast fading into a dull , lumpish monkey , of the <NAME> school .
' I fervently hope she has not bored you ? ' ' Not at all , ' said <NAME> .
Painting and <NAME> ; models and portraits representing Professors of getting up at eight , shaving close at a quarter past , breakfasting at nine , going to the <NAME> at ten , coming home at half-past five , and dining at seven .
He has openly mentioned it in many places .
' My dear love , ' drawled <NAME> , ' how very odd to send that message without seeing the name !
Thence the path wound underneath a gateway , and through a court-yard where the principal entrance was ( I hurried quickly on ) , and by the stables where none but deep voices seemed to be , whether in the murmuring of the wind through the strong mass of ivy holding to a high red wall , or in
' There never was such an exhibition. ' ' My dears , ' said their father , ' he is a diffident gentleman , and I should say particularly so in the society of girls of your age. ' ' Nonsense , our age ! ' cried <NAME> , impatiently .
How even those slight circumstances had come to his knowledge , very slowly and in course of years , for the <NAME> was one of those whose goodness shuns the light , and who have more pleasure in discovering and extolling the good deeds of others , than in trumpeting their own , be they never so commendable .
He turned it over and over ; surveyed it with a contempt no language can express ; and inquired if I wished him to fix me a boot like _that_ ?
She then sat down on the stairs a few moments to breathe and to cry , and then got up and hurried away .
With her chin drooping more heavily on her hand , and her eyes vigilant and lowering , the sick woman sat looking at her until she attracted her attention .
" You are not looking at it , " said <NAME> .
The two pilgrims , often pressing each other ' s hands , or exchanging a smile or cheerful look , pursued their way in silence .
Whatever they do , there they sit from the first moment to the last .
You don ' t know what I mean by hating , if you know me no better than that ; you can ' t know , without knowing with what care I have studied myself and people about me .
" She is an Angel ! " said The <NAME> , and embraced her .
Hence I am contented , and say it is better with me than with millions. ' As she spoke these words , she put her hand upon the watch , and restored it to the precise spot on her little table which it always occupied .
The lamplighter now dotting the quiet Close with specks of light , and running at a great rate up and down his little ladder with that object—his little ladder under the sacred shadow of whose inconvenience generations had grown up , and which all Cloisterham would have stood aghast at the idea of abolishing—the Dean withdraws to his dinner
There were also present , a couple of water-side men , bearing between them certain machines called drags ; even these fellows were accommodated with a stiff glass a-piece ; and as they drank with a great relish , and were naturally of a red-nosed , pimple-faced , convivial look , their presence rather increased than detracted from that
' You mustn ' t tell them anything of the sort. ' ' And if <NAME> ever comes into <NAME> or <NAME> , <NAME> , ' I said , ' while I am there , you may depend upon it I shall bring him to <NAME> , if he will let me , to see your house .
<NAME> , ' replied <NAME> , who had prepared himself for such emergency .
On the doorsteps there were lounging footmen with bright parti-coloured plumage and white polls , like an extinct race of monstrous birds ; and butlers , solitary men of recluse demeanour , each of whom appeared distrustful of all other butlers .
' This answer no sooner reached <NAME> , than the whole nation was transported with joy .
<NAME> <NAME> see these things ?
I looked up to <NAME> , who was sitting opposite , and I saw , as she looked at me , that her eyes were filled with tears and that tears were falling down her face .
How many children have you got , ma ' am ? ' ' Two , sir , besides Kit. ' ' Boys , ma ' am ? ' ' Yes , sir. ' ' Are they christened ? ' ' Only half baptised as yet , sir. ' ' I ' m godfather to both of ' em .
Our dearest <NAME> is a favourite child of nature .
<NAME> near me here , but rats , and they are fine stealthy secret fellows .
There were none there , and she took from her pocket a yellow set of ivory tablets , mounted in tarnished gold , and wrote upon them with a pencil in a case of tarnished gold that hung from her neck .
If she had been surprised at the apparition of the footman , she was perfectly absorbed in amazement at the richness and splendour of the furniture .
In his agony , he caught the spectral hand .
You are guilty of mockery .
There sat the hideous old man , in his accustomed corner , pointing at him , and whispering to another man , with his face averted , who sat beside him .
I saw a tear of surprise in her eye .
" <NAME> again , and let me look at something else .
' Ask Mrs Quilp , pretty Mrs Quilp , obedient , timid , loving <NAME> .
" All right , <NAME> , " says the pickpocket , a-wisperin ' in his ear .
Whether as a fore-doomed difficulty and disappointment to him ; whether as a rival who had crossed him in his way , and might again ; whether as his child , of whom , in his successful wooing , he could stoop to think as claiming , at such a time , to be no more estranged ; or
That 's good ! " ( Though his manner was less satisfied than his words . )
Everything the dear child wore was either too large for him or too small .
' I ca n't bear , somehow , to let him go out of my sight . '
" Then they do not know it yet ? "
If I do that , and find my Em ' ly , I ' m content .
Keep me here all my life long ; but pray , pray send them back .
His son cried lustily that night , at all events .
She has no name , I have no name .
Much to the discomfiture of <NAME> , who knew this to be a bad symptom .
He stood at a little distance from them .
' Do you recollect , Mrs. Cluppins , ' said <NAME> , after a few unimportant questions -- ' do you recollect being in Mrs. <NAME> ' s back one pair of stairs , on one particular morning in July last , when she was dusting <NAME> ' s apartment ? ' ' Yes , my Lord and jury
Having thus cleared the way for my expedition to <NAME> 's , I set off by the early morning coach before it was yet light , and was out on the open country road when the day came creeping on , halting and whimpering and shivering , and wrapped in patches of cloud and rags of mist , like
The day begins to break now ; and in truth it might be better for the national glory even that the sun should sometimes set upon the <NAME> dominions than that it should ever rise upon so vile a wonder as <NAME> .
Well ? ' Mr <NAME> was at a loss for any more distinct rejoinder at the moment than ' Ha -- well ? ' ' Where is this missing man ?
' " I said to the <NAME> of <NAME> , " repeated the baron , looking round the board .
<NAME> ' t lean against the dead. ' ' I do _not_ -- as you call it -- lean against the dead. ' ' But you had a mind to do it , if I had submitted , ' growled <NAME> , ' and that ' s why you drop down upon me .
<NAME> gazed , for a moment , at the struggles of the madman ( for such he supposed him to be ) ; and then darted into the house for help .
" Not so much as one short prayer ? "
' Thank you , thank you , ' said the professional gentleman , taking up another of the greasy notes as <NAME> took it from the pocket-book .
' Yes or no , and no half measures ! ' was the motto which that obdurate person many times repeated ; shaking his fist at Mr Boffin , and pegging his motto into the floor with his wooden leg , in a threatening and alarming manner .
Nobody but a child would have thought of YOUR having the money !
Could you favour me , in confidence , with some minutes of your company -- at the office of <NAME> 's <NAME> , for instance ? " " Under a threat ? " " Oh !
It may turn out to be valueless ; it may turn out to be true ; I can not say at present .
She has no strength of will or character to help herself and she is on the brink of being sold into wretchedness for life. ' ' Amazing !
' If I had been poor , ' said brother <NAME> , with sparkling eyes ; ' if I had been poor , <NAME> , my dear sir , which thank God I am not , I would have denied myself ( of course anybody would under such circumstances ) the commonest necessaries of life , to help her
They are , by nature , frank , brave , cordial , hospitable , and affectionate .
<NAME> ' t you think it ' s time you roused yourself a little ?
Then you ' ll find out what Department the contract was in , and then you ' ll find out all about it there. ' ' I beg your pardon .
<NAME> was pushed out of the tall houses , in the wretched clothing that hung upon poles and lines ; <NAME> was patched into them with straw and rag and wood and paper ; <NAME> was repeated in every fragment of the small modicum of firewood that the man sawed off ; <NAME> stared down from the smokeless chimneys
I believe you are a particular friend of <NAME> , the defendant , are you not ? ' ' I have known <NAME> now , as well as I recollect at this moment , nearly -- ' ' Pray , <NAME> , do not evade the question .
' Very thoroughly done , ' replied the gentleman , as he took his hat from her .
As he was in the habit of complaining of pains in his head -- he had naturally a short throat , and I do seriously believe he over-starched himself -- I was at first alarmed by the idea that he was not quite right in that direction ; but he soon relieved my uneasiness .
There was no amount worth mentioning of mere paper in circulation , on which anybody lived pretty handsomely , promising to pay great sums of goodness with no effects .
' I am not a moral sort of fellow , ' he said , ' and I never make any pretensions to the character of a moral sort of fellow .
' The little ' un has him ; if the big ' un doesn ' t knock under , in three seconds , he ' s a dead man .
' You had better say he won ' t , ' replied the chairman .
Eased by this report , and by the assurance that the tide was past the ebb , we turned in at three o ' clock in the morning .
" 'T is almost a pity , " Mrs. Rouncewell adds -- only " almost " because it borders on impiety to suppose that anything could be better than it is , in such an express dispensation as the <NAME> affairs -- " that my <NAME> has no family .
That ' s forbidden ground. ' The <NAME> stared at Mr Toots until he seemed to swell to twice his natural size ; and again the perspiration broke out on the <NAME> ' s forehead , when he thought of <NAME> taking it into his head to come down and make a third in the parlour .
The <NAME> ' s <NAME> was also there , and much resorted to by splendid footmen .
Both became overshadowed by a new and indefinable horror ; and when I awoke -- or rather when I shook off the lethargy that bound me in my chair -- my whole frame thrilled with objectless and unintelligible fear .
This is the place : these narrow ways , diverging to the right and left , and reeking everywhere with dirt and filth .
I ' ll wait and see you sup. ' ' <NAME> , ' he retorted , ' I beg you to go to bed .
Just as the sisters arrived here , a monotonous boy in a <NAME> cap put his head round a beam on the left , and said , ' Less noise there , ladies ! ' and disappeared .
" So , cousin , " said the cheerful voice of <NAME> to <NAME> behind me .
When we hastily returned from putting on our bonnets , we found the young family languishing in a corner and Mrs. Pardiggle sweeping about the room , knocking down nearly all the light objects it contained .
They look at each other , very seriously .
The Major knows it ; but no one is the wiser for that , though the <NAME> is much the merrier .
I saw him set it down , look at the picture she was so like , put his hand to his forehead , and shrink back in his elbow-chair .
And perhaps it was the pleasure the good <NAME> had in showing off this power of his , or else it was his own kind , generous , hearty nature , and his sympathy with all poor men , that led him straight to <NAME> 's clerk 's ; for there he went , and took <NAME> with him
We were noticing this , and saying how that the mist rose with a change of wind from a certain quarter of our marshes , when we came upon a man , slouching under the lee of the turnpike house .
She lifted up her head , and looked darkly round at him for a moment ; then laid it down again , and curved her right arm about her neck , as a woman in a fever , or in an agony of pain from a shot , might twist herself .
-- ' To insult one who is not fortunate in life , sir , and who never gave you the least offence , and the many reasons for not insulting whom you are old enough and wise enough to understand , ' said <NAME> , with his lips trembling more and more , ' you commit a mean and
I had not told him exactly when I meant to leave , and was not likely to shake hands with him again before departing .
( When I married your sister , sir , I said ' I will ; ' and when I answered your friend , <NAME> , I said ' I am . ' )
You see , that little pickled cowcumber of a Mrs. Snagsby has been used by all sides of the speculation and has done a deal more harm in bringing odds and ends together than if she had meant it .
' We mustn ' t make a show of being disturbed .
' Does he admire you ? ' <NAME> ceased to shake her head , and pressed her hand upon her living girdle .
Foulon who told my baby it might suck grass , when these breasts were dry with want !
' Nothing , ' said <NAME> , ' but my -- but my dear love -- if you please. ' <NAME> as <NAME> was , she raised her eyes to his face with an imploring and expressive look , that plainly besought him , if he knew -- which he as plainly did -- that any message between her
Now , you know the lad , and can guess the rest .
" I do n't care for that , " said Mrs. Guppy .
" 'If you remember , ' " said <NAME> , dictating , " 'the words that passed between us , long ago , you will readily comprehend this when you see it .
<NAME> , come to me ! ' <NAME> moved slowly towards the desk , rubbing his eyes in anticipation of good cause for doing so ; and he soon afterwards retired by the side-door , with as good cause as a boy need have .
And she cast down her eyes , and whispered , Yes .
Do you wish to know why I meant it , you rash and headstrong old woman ? ' ' After all , you only restore me my own words , ' she said , struggling with her indignation .
' Some such object it was , that induced you to call on me ? ' said <NAME> , raising his eyes to the schoolmaster ' s face .
' This is a confoundedly out-of-the-way place , ' said <NAME> , slipping over the stones and refuse on the shore , as the boy turned the corner sharp .
' No , thank ' ee , ' said the <NAME> .
' You have fully made up your mind to go ? ' ' I have sir , ' answered Job .
Mrs Dombey ! ' cried the soft and nimble <NAME> , at her side in a moment .
' <NAME> ' t I volatile ? ' she added , as a commentary on this offer , and , with her finger on her nose , departed .
She took possession of the keys soon after this , and went jingling about the house with the whole bunch in a little basket , tied to her slender waist .
When they came down to the corner and turned , she was saying , ' If I pinch myself for it , sir , that is my business .
She has been dead a score of years or more .
<NAME> says ten minutes , but I can not let you go so soon ; <NAME> would be very much vexed , I am sure .
' I have a presentiment , ' said Mrs. Micawber , setting down her tin pot , ' that it is a member of my family ! ' ' If so , my dear , ' observed <NAME> , with his usual suddenness of warmth on that subject , ' as the member of your family -- whoever he
Perhaps he glanced at the <NAME> sausage , and perhaps he glanced at the veal in savoury jelly , but they were not there long , to make his mouth water ; <NAME> soon dispatched them , in spite of the president and tribunal , and proceeded to suck his fingers as clean as he could , and to
On this point they were both agreed , and behaved in unison accordingly .
We have settled that , just now .
" There has always been an <NAME> , since I have heard of a <NAME> .
' Take him round the house , <NAME> , ' said the <NAME> , ' and familiarise him with his new sphere .
So wicked do destruction and secrecy appear to honest minds , that <NAME> and <NAME> , while engaged in the commission of their deed and in the removal of its traces , almost felt , and almost looked , like accomplices in a horrible crime .
They were a kind of people certain to dwell in the shade , wherever they dwelt .
It would be far better for you , <NAME> , ' the <NAME> Chancellor told me last week , 'not to waste your time here , and to stay , usefully employed , down in <NAME> . '
said one of the old women , hurrying in as soon as the door was opened .

And be a friend to me , please ; I don ' t understand myself : and I want a friend who can understand me , very much indeed. ' <NAME> kissed her , and retaining both her hands said : ' Who is <NAME> ? ' <NAME> turned aside her head in answering : ' <NAME> ' s
' But it made us what we were , <NAME> , ' said the Major , settling his shirt frill .
' What did you say ? ' asked <NAME> , very sharply .
His horror was suddenly converted into joy , however , when he recognised the form of his faithful attendant .
' I think I had once ; but it ' s all gone now -- all gone. ' ' Why do you think you had once ? ' asked <NAME> , turning quickly upon him as though the answer in some way helped out the purport of his question .
A casual visitor might suppose this place to be a temple dedicated to the <NAME> of <NAME> .
' With great pleasure , ' replied <NAME> to <NAME> , and then the two gentlemen took wine , after which they took a glass of wine round , ladies and all .
Whether he had any accomplices , or whatever the thing is called in the law ?
But , the turning of the road took him by the back of the booth , and at the back of the booth a number of children were congregated in a number of stealthy attitudes , striving to peep in at the hidden glories of the place .
' Don ' t say that , comrade ! ' retorted <NAME> : ' No , don ' t say that !
There are pretty villas and cheerful houses in its streets , and <NAME> smiles upon the country round ; but jostling its handsome residences , like slavery itself going hand in hand with many lofty virtues , are deplorable tenements , fences unrepaired , walls crumbling into ruinous heaps .
They were all pretty , and <NAME> was very handsome ; but there was a loving , cheerful , fireside quality in <NAME> ' s bright looks , which was better than that , and which assured me that my friend had chosen well .
As <NAME> , and Caddy herself , and many others .
' They don ' t send many -- what was your expression ? -- words of remembrance to me , ' said <NAME> , making haste to take refuge in ill-usage .
After I had got in and had taken a grateful leave of them all , the youngest daughter -- a blooming girl of nineteen , who was to be the first married , they had told me -- got upon the carriage step , reached in , and kissed me .
But it will be all left behind .
At length the weary child prevailed upon her grandfather to retire , and they withdrew , leaving the company yet seated round the fire , and the dogs fast asleep at a humble distance .
Bridges are begun , and their not yet united piers desolately look at one another over roads and streams like brick and mortar couples with an obstacle to their union ; fragments of embankments are thrown up and left as precipices with torrents of rusty carts and barrows tumbling over them ; tripods of tall poles appear on hilltops
Or rather , she left about half of herself at eighteen years of age behind , and grafted the rest on to the relict of the late Mr F. ; thus making a moral mermaid of herself , which her once boy-lover contemplated with feelings wherein his sense of the sorrowful and his sense of the comical were curiously
this is a good beginning .
The day after to-morrow , if you please .
Therefore , my band of brothers in a sacred bond , to which your children and your children ' s children yet unborn have set their infant hands and seals , I propose to you on the part of the <NAME> , ever watchful for your welfare , ever zealous for your benefit , that this meeting does Resolve
I see you rise up <NAME> , <NAME> , where you sat down <NAME> .
I believed , from the solitary and thoughtful way in which my mother murmured her song , that she was alone .
<NAME> glanced round , and his eye rested , for an instant , on <NAME> , as if he had expected him to intercede ; but his look was riveted on his desk .
' You have a committee today at three , you know. ' ' And one at three , three-quarters , ' added Mr Dombey .
We must eat and drink , and dress , and have a roof over our heads .
where are they ? ' ' Where are they ? ' said an old woman , coming hobbling across as fast as she could from the opposite side of the way .
You never can tell how she ' ll head , you see .
It ' s awful enough to BE <NAME> , without being called so .
<NAME> <NAME> glided , as we went in , from another part of the room and stood behind her chair .
Equally , if his heart had given entertainment to that prohibited guest , his silent fighting of his way through the mental condition of this period might have been a little meritorious .
Almost as they did so , there came running round the corner of the street at a quick pace and with a frightened look , a girl whom <NAME> recognized .
Though often when she was asleep and all was quiet , the remembrance of my mother kept me waking and made the night sorrowful , I did not yield to it at another time ; and <NAME> found me what I used to be -- except , of course , in that particular of which I have said enough
' You don ' t know me as well as -- ' ' As you know yourself ? ' suggested the Secretary , finding that she stopped .
' You are to understan ' , <NAME> ' r <NAME> , ' said he , ' as we have left the Bush now , being so well to do ; and have gone right away round to <NAME> Middlebay Harbour , wheer theer ' s what we call a town. ' ' Mr .
He told me that since his retirement from scholastic life , he had been advancing with it wonderfully ; and that nothing could suit him better than the proposed arrangements for morning and evening work , as it was his custom to walk about in the daytime with his considering cap on .
The idea of their frightening her , and making her cry , and of my not being there to comfort her , was so excruciating , that it impelled me to write a wild letter to <NAME> , beseeching him not to visit upon her the consequences of my awful destiny .
" Why do YOU come here ? "
<NAME> , you 're a-staring at the pocket-handkerchiefs !
' But he was an altered man , and he could not bear the thought of returning to a place where his repentance would be scoffed at , and his reformation disbelieved .
Why do you call it my allowance , and never let me spend it ? "
A small loaf and a morsel of cheese , therefore , were all she could afford , and with these she took her place in the boat again , and , after half an hour ' s delay during which the men were drinking at the public-house , proceeded on the journey .
It would be wisdom to abandon it now , after all the time , anxiety , and pains I have bestowed upon it !
Who could teach me better ! ' He never thought that she saw in him what no one else could see .
On her little table lay two or three books , her handkerchief , a pair of steel spectacles newly taken off , and an old-fashioned gold watch in a heavy double case .
' Do you wish to be introduced to <NAME> , my dear ? ' ' That the schoolmaster !
Now , these tumbling tenements contain , by night , a swarm of misery .
This rock we must leave to time , chance , and hopeful circumstance .
' I think that , for the present at all events , it will be better for <NAME> to come into the show-room with you , and try things on for people , ' said <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> eyed the old man for a moment -- he had slipped and shrunk down in his chair into a mere bundle -- as if he were much disposed to pounce upon him ; nevertheless , he continued to bend over him with the same agreeable air , keeping the corner of one of his eyes upon us
From babies who had but a week or two of life behind them , to crooked old men and women who seemed to have but a week or two of life before them ; and from ploughmen bodily carrying out soil of <NAME> on their boots , to smiths taking away samples of its soot and smoke upon their
<NAME> that , nothing lively ; no , not so much as a white mouse in a twirling cage .
A mouthful did it. ' Pleasant with a grave look shook her head ; importing that she understood the process , but decidedly disapproved .
His knock is immediately answered by <NAME> himself .
Because , ' smiling <NAME> turned him by the arm towards the sideboard and spoke banteringly , ' it never can be worth your while to come among us and help us. ' Mr <NAME> felt honoured by the -- ' No , no , ' said <NAME> , ' that is not the light in which one so
From the background to which she had necessarily retired somewhat , since the marriage , <NAME> looked on , therefore , at domestic affairs in general , with a resolute conviction that no good would come of Mrs Dombey : always being very careful to publish on all possible occasions , that she had nothing to say against her
It ' s my destiny , however , and I hope <NAME> may like it .
' I don ' t understand you , Mr Pancks. ' ' That ' s the name that I want to know about. ' ' And what do you want to know ? ' ' Whatever you can and will tell me. ' This comprehensive summary of his desires was not discharged without some heavy labouring on the part
I say , I wonder what old <NAME> ' ud say , if he knew it .
" Look over your hand carefully , <NAME> .
' Do you know , yet , what it is ? ' ' I am afraid to speculate on what it is .
With your own salary , and your friend ' s , and your writings , you ' d make -- ah !
He dreams now , sometimes , of his children or his wife , but is sure that they are dead , or have deserted him .
Within the limits of his short tether he had tumbled about , annihilating the flowers of existence with greater singleness of purpose than many of the blatant personages whose company he kept .
<NAME> <NAME> smiled ; and , turning to <NAME> , said that <NAME> was an old friend of his , and he must not mind his being a little rough in his manners ; for he was a worthy creature at bottom , as he had reason to know .
She would lead them to me and coax them to me .
His politeness was so much more cutting than his wrath , that the <NAME> went to the door .
' And <NAME> ' s anxiety for his arrival , <NAME> ' am , is to be referred -- take J. B. ' s word for this ; for <NAME> is devilish sly ' -- the <NAME> tapped his nose , and screwed up one of his eyes tight : which did not enhance his native beauty -- '
Now , ma'am , when <NAME> says to me that it 's best not tried to be undone now , I have my thoughts as I have often had before , and I draw it out of <NAME> how he comes to have such things on him that afternoon .
Helped out by the <NAME> and some half-dozen of the hotel servants , he was passing through the hall with a serene magnificence , when lo !
<NAME> to the best man !
' It ' s almost an aggravation of the enormity , that we shall be out to-day .
Then also , and before the broaching of the rum and water , came Mr <NAME> ' s note-book .
Of course I shall observe your directions , in considering the matter as one to be arranged between you and me solely , and not to be referred to , up at the <NAME> ' s. ' ' Have you dined ? ' asked <NAME> , with a motion of his hand towards the table .
On the table beside him , among the usual lumber , stand an empty gin-bottle and a glass .
Words passed between us in consequence , and I felt it due to my character to leave him .
I was in the middle state between sleeping and waking , either then or immediately afterwards ; for , as he resumed -- it was a real fact that he had stopped playing -- I saw and heard the same old woman ask Mrs. Fibbitson if it wasn ' t delicious ( meaning the flute ) , to which
They are not going to-day !
As a security for the repayment of this advance to P. Q. whom we would call a widow lady , there were placed in A. B. ' s hands the title-deeds of a freehold estate , which we would call <NAME> .
Much nearer sixty years of age than fifty , with a flowing outline of stomach , and horizontal creases in his waistcoat ; reputed to be rich ; voting at elections in the strictly respectable interest ; morally satisfied that nothing but he himself has grown since he was a baby ; how can dunder-headed <NAME> be otherwise than
<NAME> <NAME> ! ' cried <NAME> , ' God bless you !
<NAME> , pray , pray , I beg you and implore you with all my grieving heart , my friend -- my dear ! -- take all I have , and make it a Blessing to me ! ' The star had shone on her face until now , when her face sank upon his hand and her own
That done , we went to see their sleeping-rooms on the floor above , in which the arrangements were no less excellent and gentle than those we had seen below .
He has no expectations , no property to come into .
I am well prepared , but there are precautions to be taken , that could not be taken until he was actually summoned before the <NAME> .
Here was this <NAME> , a man of a robust will and surprising energy -- intellectually speaking , a sort of inharmonious blacksmith -- and he could easily imagine that there <NAME> was , years ago , wandering about in life for something to expend his superfluous combativeness upon -- a sort of <NAME> among the thorns -- when
I drops my knife many a time in that hut when I was a-eating my dinner or my supper , and I says , 'Here 's the boy again , a looking at me whiles I eats and drinks ! '
<NAME> , <NAME> , ' said the ticket-porter , touching his hat with his little cane .
No , you wicked foreign woman ; I am your match. " <NAME> was not likely to follow these idiomatic remarks in detail ; but , she so far understood them as to perceive that she was set at naught .
" You 'll excuse my asking again if it has anything to do with a picture , ma'am , " observes <NAME> , " because I do assure you that the more I think of that picture the better I know it , without knowing how I know it ! "
The people immediately behind <NAME> , explaining the cause of her satisfaction to those behind them , and those again explaining to others , and those to others , the neighbouring streets resounded with the clapping of hands .
<NAME> replies with excellent temper , " Ah !
Day after day , old <NAME> and <NAME> kept her reckoning in the little back parlour and worked out her course , with the chart spread before them on the round table .
' There is no harm done , beyond what a basin of water can repair. ' ' No harm ! ' cried <NAME> , passing his hands hastily over the back and arms of <NAME> , as if to assure himself that he had broken no bones .
' Do you think <NAME> is likely to drop down upon me to-night , <NAME> ? ' inquired Mr Boffin , wistfully , as they went along .
I lifted the heavy head , put the long dank hair aside , and turned the face .
However vigorous the sapling , ' said Mrs. Micawber , shaking her head , ' I can not forget the parent-tree ; and when our race attains to eminence and fortune , I own I should wish that fortune to flow into the coffers of Britannia. ' ' My dear , ' said <NAME> , ' <NAME> must take
Everything looked gay and smiling ; but the holy man walked gloomily on , with his eyes bent upon the ground .
' What have you been doing ?
To be sure , he as invariably requested to be refreshed with a sight of the paper in which he was a joint proprietor ; but he never failed to remark that it was the great pleasure he derived from Mr <NAME> ' s improving society which had insensibly lured him round to <NAME> again , and that ,
' Well , it don ' t matter , ' said <NAME> .
It had its poor people too .
Quietly , quietly , the ruled and cross-ruled countenance on which they were traced , became fair and blank .
very much so , indeed , ' said <NAME> , interrupting him ; 'but there is a poor creature upstairs , whom aunt wishes you to see . '
The doctors know that he is best with her , and when not actively engaged about him , stand aloof .
The houses of <NAME> and <NAME> were united ; the spears rusted ; and the baron ' s bugle grew hoarse for lack of blowing .
She received my attentions with favour ; but whether on my account solely , or because she had any designs on <NAME> , I can ' t say .
<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> listened with gloomy respect to the torrent of eloquence which their leader poured forth from the sedan-chair , and the rapid course of which not all <NAME> ' s earnest entreaties to have the lid of the vehicle closed , were able to check for an instant .
I shall find you out , sir ; I shall find you out. ' ' Rather you found me out than found me at home , ' replied the unmoved stranger .
The effect of that upon young <NAME> was to make him a wonderful spectacle of failure and helplessness .
Looking intently that way one night , he plainly distinguished an eye gleaming and glistening at the keyhole ; and having now no doubt that his suspicions were correct , he stole softly to the door , and pounced upon her before she was aware of his approach .
And really his anxiety to be of use in the investigations we have been making , and his real usefulness in extracting , and copying , and fetching , and carrying , have been quite stimulating to us. ' ' Dick is a very remarkable man , ' exclaimed my aunt ; ' and I always said he was
For the time being at least , I was saved .
How many cups of tea I drank , because <NAME> made it , I don ' t know .
They all spoke of sums of money , and only mentioned the sums and left the money to be understood ; as ' five and forty thousand <NAME> , ' or ' Two hundred and twenty-two on every individual share in the lot Joe. ' They seemed to divide the world into two classes of people ; people who
Some girls would be proud to have such gallants at their feet. ' ' Proud ! ' cried <NAME> .
We had , for ourselves , a tiny state-room with two berths in it , opening out of the ladies ' cabin .
However , though I am not influenced by manners and station , <NAME> may be .
' You ought to know , if anybody does. ' ' Mr Job <NAME> , ' Mr Inspector continued , ' I drink your health .
' I said , letting alone the risk , ' replied <NAME> , evasively .
Still we swept onward like a phantom ship , and many an eager eye glanced up to where the Look-out on the mast kept watch for <NAME> .
You have a friend in me , <NAME> ; a staunch friend .
He shall know all about that to-morrow , and in the meantime , as it ' s rather late , I ' ll try and get a wink of the balmy. ' ' The balmy ' came almost as soon as it was courted .
' Did you call to me ? ' said <NAME> , running up to them .
The woman had a great desire to answer , but the man , with another oath , openly kicked at her foot with his heavy boot .
' Where do you come from ? ' inquired the clerk .
I appeal to you -- is this quite respectful ?
No ! ' Notwithstanding which , he continued to defend himself , without any abatement of his flushed mood .
This was at the expiration of about six weeks .
' What do you take a pleasure in ruining a cove for ?
However , of course , that soon blew over , and we were all good friends again. ' Although the visit had as yet given <NAME> no opportunity of conversing with <NAME> , there was a silent understanding between them , which did as well .
As <NAME> ' s step came higher up and nearer , she trembled and faltered ; and it was as much as she could do to speak , when <NAME> at length appeared .
" -- rendered it necessary that I should go to <NAME> , there to communicate with a gentleman of the <NAME> , so good as to be despatched to <NAME> for the purpose. " " Myself. " " As I was prepared to hear , sir. " She curtseyed to him ( young ladies made curtseys in those days
It was not easy to put her into a fly-away bonnet now , or to keep the bonnet in its place on the back of her poor nodding head , when it was got on .
' Well , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> when the first piece was over , and he had almost finished dressing to go home , ' is there any letter yet ? ' ' Yes , ' replied <NAME> , ' I got this one from the post-office. ' ' From Newman Noggs , ' said <NAME> , casting
' <NAME> So-and-so , of the <NAME> , <NAME> ? ' ' I should say she would look very well in the bills , ' said <NAME> .
It will be naterally very gratifying to my feelings as a husband , to make that man acquainted with this ewent. ' Having delivered his sentiments in this form of words , <NAME> arranged his second daughter ' s flaxen tail , and bade her be a good girl and mind what her sister , <NAME> , said .
At length the cloth is drawn , and a dish of walnuts and a decanter of rich-coloured sherry are placed upon the table .
I was haunted by the file too .
Mostly they come for skill -- or idleness .
<NAME> <NAME> laughs , and with a glance at <NAME> and a parting salutation to the scornful Judy , strides out of the parlour , clashing imaginary sabres and other metallic appurtenances as he goes .
Do you hear ? ' ' It an ' t time , ' said <NAME> , doggedly .
' You ha ' n ' t hurt yourself , I hope , <NAME> ? ' said <NAME> , in a loud whisper , as soon as he had recovered from the surprise consequent upon the mysterious disappearance of his master .
The young gentleman did not stop to bestow any other mark of recognition upon <NAME> than a humourous grin ; but , turning away , beckoned the visitors to follow him down a flight of stairs .
She was in service there , sure ? ' My answering in the affirmative gave him great satisfaction .
To help his memory I mentioned my name .
Every effort I have made to penetrate it , has only served to render it darker and more obscure ; and I am afraid to stir openly in the matter , lest those whom I anxiously pursue , should fly still farther from me .
and yonder the captain himself .
This interesting communication was addressed to Mrs. Maylie , who received it very graciously .
' Why do you come here to do this ? ' said the old man , sitting down beside them , and looking at the figures with extreme delight .
You have poured balm into my anxious soul .
It was a fortunate circumstance for <NAME> , that when her worthy papa returned home on the night of the small tea-party , he was what the initiated term ' too far gone ' to observe the numerous tokens of extreme vexation of spirit which were plainly visible in her countenance .
' This violent strain upon the nervous system over , my lord , what ensues ?
There was a clock too , an old clock , in one corner .
Bring this with you. " I had had load enough upon my mind before the receipt of this strange letter .
<NAME> understood this perfectly well ; and <NAME> , bestowing upon him one of her sweetest smiles , tripped gracefully away , leaving <NAME> in a state of very great admiration of her charms , both personal and mental .
' There ' s time enough , my boy , don ' t hurry. ' I might have been surprised by the feeling tone in which he spoke , if I had given it a thought ; but I gave it none until afterwards .
But you are a single person , sir , and may you long be spared to ask a married person such a question ! "
If he was , it would be no business of ours , for we make a very good friend by having him here ; and if he likes to learn the boys anything besides minding them , I have no objection I am sure. ' ' I say again , I hate him worse than poison , ' said
' Gentlemen , ' said the man , ' I offer no excuses for myself .
' Well , child ! ' said <NAME> , after a pause ' I wouldn ' t on any account say anything unkind to you , and that I ' m sure you know .
'What am I to do ? '
' I am impatient of our situation .
I do n't think that wise , mind , but it 's my trust .
Trust me , I will remain near you only so long as I can fully respect it . "
I only ask for him that his life may be fairly remembered .
" Not related to her , sir ? "
' So Em ' ly writes in pencil on a bit of paper , ' he pursued , ' and gives it to her out o ' winder to bring here .
I now affectionately advise , I now most earnestly entreat , you two to part as you came here .
He may be suspected of far worse than ever I was. ' ' Who suspects him ? ' ' Many , perhaps .
On the appointed day <NAME> arrived .
And how did you like Mrs. Jellyby , my dear ? "
The Wanderer can only speak of the case as if it were his own .
I never can forget all that , you know , and I never would if I could. ' ' Copperfield , ' said <NAME> , ' farewell !
" Peace , aristocrat ! " " It is as the good patriot says , " observed the timid functionary .
They were not like me ; they were not chilled , anxious , ragged , or beaten ; they were never in pain .
It was a wonder that the great clock in the hall , instead of being constant to its first inquiry , never said , ' Gentlemen , we will now resume our studies , ' for that phrase was often enough repeated in its neighbourhood .
Will you drink something before you go ? " He had replaced his neckerchief loosely , and had stood , keenly observant of me , biting a long end of it .
If they shot him dead , I was not the cause ; do you hear me ?
Why he ' s a miracle of high feeding , that boy is ! ' ' I should like to have a word with you , ' said <NAME> , who had both spoken and listened mechanically for some time , and seemed to have been thinking .
" I am sure of that , " said I .
His way was nowhere in particular ; but he thought he would go out into the fields , where he could reflect upon the unknown life before him , and resting under some tree , ponder quietly .
Is it that ? ' ' Yes. ' ' He has not. ' ' I thank <NAME> ! ' said <NAME> .
I know I did. ' ' I told you I had not found out. ' ' Yes .
But I don ' t believe a word of it. ' ' Miss Trotwood , ' rejoined <NAME> , shrugging his shoulders , as he rose , ' if you were a gentleman -- ' ' Bah !
Then the clergyman , an amiable and mild-looking young curate , but obviously afraid of the baby , appeared like the principal character in a ghost-story , ' a tall figure all in white ; ' at sight of whom <NAME> rent the air with his cries , and never left off again till he was taken out black
So was his daughter. " " Miss <NAME> was an only child ? " I hazarded .
The dingy tenement inhabited by <NAME> was her own ; having been devised and bequeathed to her by the deceased owner of the fishy eye in the locket , of whom a miniature portrait , with a powdered head and a pigtail , balanced the kettle-holder on opposite sides of the parlour fireplace .
It was so plain , grave , unaffected , and sincere , that she bent her head , as if at once to thank him , and acknowledge his sincerity .
' <NAME> , sir. ' ' Why , what on earth does she do here ? ' said <NAME> .
That went round the letters .
Carrying out which intention , he presented himself before her at the expiration of a month , in rags , without shoes , and much more tired than ever .
' Dear <NAME> , ' said she , ' what is to become of poor Tip ? ' His name was <NAME> , and <NAME> had been transformed into <NAME> , within the walls .
The only thing that stands in its way , sir , is the Credit. ' This drawback , rather severely felt by most people who engaged in commercial transactions with the inhabitants of Bleeding Heart Yard , was a large stumbling-block in Mrs Plornish ' s trade .
The trade signs ( and they were almost as many as the shops ) were , all , grim illustrations of <NAME> .
He is a man to be shirked , put off , brow-beaten , sneered at , handed over by this highly-connected young or old gentleman , to that highly-connected young or old gentleman , and dodged back again ; he is a man with no rights in his own time , or his own property ; a mere outlaw
It glistened like a bird ' s , and did not fix itself upon the game , but pierced the room from end to end , and gleamed on harp , performer , listener , everything .
' Indeed , I recollect his speaking , at that time , of a pupil younger than himself who had taken his fancy there ; but your name , as you may suppose , has not lived in my memory. ' ' He was very generous and noble to me in those days , I assure you , ma
No one could doubt that <NAME> was the last person upon earth to put such a question to , with any hope of information .
' When Mr <NAME> saw me , my love , ' observed her husband , not avoiding his eye , but looking at him , ' my name was <NAME> Handford. ' <NAME> !
In fact ( returning unexpectedly to <NAME> ) , the better you know him , the more you find in him that you desire to know .
They talked about their fathers and mothers , and brothers and sisters ; they liked to drag them up before her face .
In her thoughts of her new mother , and in the love and trust overflowing her pure heart towards her , <NAME> loved her own dead mother more and more .
' I ' ll not wake him , ' she said , covering her face and hanging down her head .
<NAME> <NAME> expressed his heartfelt delight at every additional suggestion ; and his eyes beamed with hilarity and cheerfulness .
In the mean time a stray personage of a meek demeanour , who had wandered to the hearthrug and got among the heads of tribes assembled there in conference with Mr Podsnap , eliminated Mr Podsnap ' s flush and flourish by a highly unpolite remark ; no less than a reference to the circumstance that some half-dozen people
( To the stout gentleman in the rocking-chair . )
Go home with this intelligence and come to <NAME> 's by and by ! "
Five ? " With my heart beating like a heavy hammer of disordered action , I rose out of my chair , and stood with my hand upon the back of it , looking wildly at him .
From beneath his feet , at such times , as from a shrill ghost unquiet in its grave , there frequently arise complainings and lamentations in the voice already mentioned ; and haply , on some occasions when these reach a sharper pitch than usual , <NAME> mentions to the 'prentices , " I think my little woman is
Associated with it was a certain stately presence , a gloved hand , the remembrance how the feathers of a beautiful bird ' s wing had been showered down upon the floor , and how the light white down upon a robe had stirred and rustled , as in the rising of a distant storm .
After assuring him that I did not forget how interested he had always been in her , and how kindly he had always treated her , I gave him a general account of her restoration to her uncle by the aid of <NAME> ; which I knew would please the old man .
<NAME> leaned upon his pillow , holding his head upon her arm .
' Why , he has sauntered into the Arts at a leisurely Pall-Mall pace , ' said <NAME> , ' and I doubt if they care to be taken quite so coolly. ' Pursuing his inquiries , <NAME> found that the <NAME> family were a very distant ramification of the <NAME> ; and that the paternal <NAME> , originally
<NAME> <NAME> possessed all her mamma ' s haughtiness without the turban , and all her ill-nature without the wig ; and whenever the exercise of these two amiable qualities involved mother and daughter in some unpleasant dilemma , as they not infrequently did , they both concurred in laying the blame on the shoulders of <NAME> .
' <NAME> down ; sit down. ' <NAME> suffered himself to be forced into a chair by the fireside .
I would that all our people remembered it !
This form of proceeding <NAME> repeats with every member of the household , until all are paid .
' It is a very long way from here , ' said I , ' my child. ' ' I know that , sir , ' she replied timidly .
" Did that other creature come to the same end ? " I asked .
' I think he is , sir. ' ' Have you any particular reason for thinking so , <NAME> ? ' ' Well , sir , ' returned that personage , ' the fact is , he has given me another look-in , to make sure of what he calls our stock-in-trade being correct , and he has mentioned
' Thank you , sir , ' replied the collector , buttoning his waistcoat .
There were the bailie ' s wife , and the bailie ' s three daughters , and the bailie ' s grown-up son , and three or four stout , bushy eye-browed , canny , old <NAME> fellows , that the bailie had got together to do honour to my uncle , and help to make merry .
<NAME> , taking down the hand that would have embraced her in another moment , held it in one of hers , and answered : ' First , <NAME> , do you know what I am ?
I do not think , ' he said , after a moment ' s pause , during which he had observed her , sternly , ' that you are so audacious as to mean to trifle with me , or endeavour to impose upon me .
The ice , and the snow , and he , and the one light , had absolute possession of the dreary scene .
I had a fancy , on more than one of these Sundays , that what this lady so curiously was to me , I was to her -- I mean that I disturbed her thoughts as she influenced mine , though in some different way .

Thus terminating the interview , during which both ladies had trembled very much , and been marvellously polite -- certain indications that they were within an inch of a very desperate quarrel -- <NAME> bounced out of the room , and into the street .
' How dare you do this ? ' said Mr Dorrit .
" I am glad of one thing , " said <NAME> , " and that is , that you have felt you could give me your confidence , <NAME> .
To have painted the sordid facts of their lives , and they throughout invoking the death ' s head apparition of the family gentility to come and scare their benefactors , would have made <NAME> a satirist of the first water .
Necessarily , he was going out again directly , because the <NAME> lock never turned upon a debtor who was not .
' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , musing , when they stood resting from their labours at the shop-door , looking down the old familiar street ; it being still early in the morning ; ' nothing at all of <NAME> , in all that time ! ' ' Nothing at all , my lad , ' replied the

I wondered what was the history of all the odd litter about the room , and how it came there .
A deserting soldier in a <NAME> 's Rest , what lay hid up to the chin under a lot of taturs , learnt me to read ; and a travelling Giant what signed his name at a penny a time learnt me to write .
You have done me many acts of kindness that I can never repay , and have no wish to repay , for I prefer continuing the obligation. ' With this preface , the two friends dived into some very complicated accounts and vouchers , which , having been duly displayed and gone through by <NAME> , were at once
The influence of my family being local , it is their wish that <NAME> should go down to <NAME> .
I ha ' bore that much , that I were owd when I were young. ' Mrs. Sparsit , easily ambling along with her netting-needles , raised the <NAME> eyebrows and shook her head , as much as to say , ' The great know trouble as well as the small .
Oh ! ' ' My dearest , ' I remonstrated , ' don ' t talk preposterous nonsense !
To look round upon the garden , now , that he took so much pride in , or to go into his room and see it filled with so many of those little contrivances for our comfort that he was so fond of making , and made so well , and so little thought he would leave unfinished --

<NAME> , in the meantime , the shadow of the <NAME> wall was a real darkening influence , and could be seen on the <NAME> at any stage of the sun ' s course .
Without relaxing his pace , or stopping to take breath , this mysterious individual dashed on through a great many alleys and narrow ways until he at length arrived in a square paved court , when he subsided into a walk , and making for a small house from the window of which a light was shining , lifted
Oh dear me , dear me ! ' Fain to accept his promise , and wishing to propitiate him , Mr Wegg looks on as he sighs and pours himself out more tea , and then says , trying to get a sympathetic tone into his voice : ' You seem very low , Mr Venus .
Then , addressing me , she said , with enforced calmness : ' My son is ill. ' ' Very ill. ' ' You have seen him ? ' ' Are you reconciled ? ' I could not say Yes , I could not say No .
' And -- excuse me , sir -- but it ' s burning hot. ' Deigning no other than a practical answer to this remonstrance , Mr <NAME> raised the hot saucepan to his lips , and deliberately drank off all the spirit it contained , which might have been in quantity about half a pint , and had

The book itself had the appearance of having been stolen from some court of justice , and perhaps his knowledge of its antecedents , combined with his own experience in that wise , gave him a reliance on its powers as a sort of legal spell or charm .
They found a tree near by in a corner , and a blacksmith ' s forge , and a timber yard , and a dealer ' s in old iron .
' Very well , sir , ' replied the waiter .
' Is it a bargain between us , <NAME> ?
I had forced it out of them .
This was the morning of the day appointed for <NAME> 's departure .
' Then I am sure I will ! ' So , she drew her arm through <NAME> ' s , and walked with him to a leafy little summer-house there was at the bottom of the garden , where she sat down on a bench , and I beside her .
He was not merciful with her , and he made her do it .
When Mr <NAME> did at last obtain free access to ' Our <NAME> ' , as he had been wont to call the mansion outside which he had sat shelterless so long , and when he did at last find it in all particulars as different from his mental plans of it as according to the nature of things
The <NAME> lubricates his nose .

' One who has conveyed to us , within these two hours , the intelligence which caused our sending to you , ' replied brother <NAME> .
" Woman imbecile and pig-like ! " said <NAME> , frowning .
" And as you say , <NAME> , when the cause is in the paper next term , this document will be an unexpected and interesting feature in it , " said <NAME> , looking loftily at my guardian .
I ' ll tell Ma that you dined at <NAME> ' ' Well ; seriously , my dear , ' observed R. W. , with some trepidation of manner , ' it might be as well not to mention it. ' ' Aha ! ' laughed <NAME> .
asked <NAME> 's good lady .
" It is the daughter of your father who is my business here. " " For my sake , then , be merciful to my husband .
' First , I spent all I had of my own .
' I am telling you the truth , <NAME> , upon my word , but not half so strong as I could wish , ' said <NAME> .
What is the matter , that you stay here in the cold so long , without moving ? ' By slow and stiff efforts , she appears to contract her vision until it can rest upon him ; and then a curious film passes over her , and she begins to shake .
It was their turn to laugh now at the notion of his shaking <NAME> .
There was a fire in the grate , as there had been night and day for fifteen years .
If you were to cast me off now—but you will not—you would never be rid of me .
Faster. ' The boy made all the speed he could , and <NAME> led onward , constantly turning back to threaten him , and urge him to greater haste .
It soon became apparent ( from the knowledge with which he set out ) that he must have been to the office where the <NAME> will was registered , and must have read the will .
I therefore have not come to the consideration of <NAME> as a neophyte .
All I say before speaking to you according to that assumption is , if you DO change -- if you DO come to find that you are more commonplace cousins to each other as man and woman than you were as boy and girl ( your manhood will excuse me , <NAME> ! )

cried the Jew , in amazement .
That is the reason why , at his own suggestion , I have kept the secret of his coming , here , from you , lest his acquaintance with it should distress you. ' ' Here !
" It could not , sir , " said <NAME> , " have been stated more plainly and to the purpose if it had been a case at law . "
He was concerned and even shocked , when I added that I wished he would not parade his attachment before them ; but he said he would sacrifice even the honest impulses of his affection to my peace .
" Meanwhile , " said the <NAME> , " I will preserve the honour and repose of the family , if you will not .
I assure you I found him very well and in the best of <NAME> , and he showed me even more than his usual kindness ; being so very kind as to say that I was not a stranger there , and in all ways gratifying me very much. ' To the inexpressible consternation of her lover , <NAME>
It would have been the better for an old church ; better still for some old graves ; but as it was , a wholesome repose and tranquillity pervaded the scene , which after the restless ocean and the hurried city , had a doubly grateful influence on the spirits .
' Bound for the races , I see , ' said Mr Grinder coming up out of breath .
But I have found nothing the matter with him .
I have just made up my mind to do it. ' ' Chaymaid ! ' cried the waiter .
' Are you sure , <NAME> ? ' said <NAME> .
' You will let me come to see you , ' said <NAME> , ' when I can ; and you will tell me everything about yourself and <NAME> ; and you will have no secrets from <NAME> when she comes and I do not , but will confide in us , and trust us , and rely upon

Then why should HE escape ? "

' Put down his name , <NAME> , ' said the magistrate .
<NAME> <NAME> takes his leave , and Mr Carker takes his leave .
The Jew again bade her good-night , and , bestowing a sly kick upon the prostrate form of <NAME> while her back was turned , groped downstairs .
I am acquainted with my personal history , and I have it in my power to assure you that you never can advance my welfare by such means .
I hope you have brought your appetite with you , and intend to play a good knife and fork ? ' ' Thank you , sir , ' returned <NAME> , ' I don ' t eat much at present. ' Mr <NAME> drew him a little apart .
' Well ? ' said <NAME> , with a manner as short as she herself was long , ' say your half word .
I occupy my own rooms , and have held scarcely any communication with them. ' ' Odder and odder ! ' said Mr Boffin .
From the boy 's face one might suppose that sacred emblem to be , in his eyes , the crowning confusion of the great , confused city -- so golden , so high up , so far out of his reach .
' " To please the devil , ma ' am , " answered the baron .
It may have its effect on others , and may be meant to have .
' <NAME> , my dear Ned , ' Jasper resumes , as he shakes his head with a grave cheerfulness , ' I must subdue myself to my vocation : which is much the same thing outwardly .
The discovery of this Behoving <NAME> was the discovery of the political perpetual motion .
The <NAME> was greatly pleased to find him in this mood , and looked upon him with such favour , that he begged like a boy to be allowed to stay until the guests departed .
Yet there was a vague remembrance in his mind , as if he had more than once dreamed of some old woman like her .
There never was such a hard case !
<NAME> , ' said the manager , presenting him to <NAME> .
That she had done a grievous thing in taking an impressionable child to mould into the form that her wild resentment , spurned affection , and wounded pride found vengeance in , I knew full well .
Come on , little ' un , and let ' s see who ' ll get most. ' The waiter certainly got most .
' Here ' s a handkerchief , ' said <NAME> .
" Why , so have I been thinking too , <NAME> , " said my guardian , " and our little woman likewise ; she and I have been talking of it this very day .
Acting upon the impulse of this passion , he ( the savage ) began to hit himself severe thumps in the chest , and to exhibit other indications of being desperately in love , which being rather a prosy proceeding , was very likely the cause of the maiden ' s falling asleep ; whether it was or no

I was now certain of it .
' Very well indeed ! ' are at length the words which Twemlow with great difficulty extracts from himself .
He therefore , once and for all , requested Mr Rugg ' s immediate aid in getting the business despatched .
On the fourth , the host was in high spirits , for he had satisfied himself that there was no ground for the charge against <NAME> .

Oliver walked twenty miles that day ; and all that time tasted nothing but the crust of dry bread , and a few draughts of water , which he begged at the cottage-doors by the road-side .
It ' s a delightful thing to see affection in families , but it may be carried rather too far , and <NAME> could not help thinking that <NAME> must be very particularly fond of her relations , if she paid as much attention to all of them as to this individual cousin .
" It is all I could do , " said <NAME> .
<NAME> , no : you know I make no pretence with you .
' Number of what , child ? ' inquired <NAME> , looking up from her work .

" It laid the injunction on me that I should never propose to see the writer , who had long been estranged from all intercourse with the world , but who would see a confidential agent if I would appoint one .

' You must satisfy the curiosity of these gentlemen , sooner or later ; so you had better take advantage of this favourable opportunity , and do so at once.

' She couldn ' t even have a baby like anybody else , ' said my aunt .
The invitation was most willingly accepted ; and when they were seated over their wine , <NAME> , with sundry blushes , produced the following little tale , as having been ' edited ' by himself , during his recent indisposition , from his notes of <NAME> ' s unsophisticated recital .
'This is a terrible hardened one , ' they says to prison wisitors , picking out me .
At his , <NAME> roared again : so loud , that Fagin himself relaxed , and even the <NAME> smiled ; but as the <NAME> drew forth the five-pound note at that instant , it is doubtful whether the sally of the discovery awakened his merriment .
It is the subject in connection with which my son first had , I believe , the pleasure of cultivating your acquaintance. ' <NAME> inclined his head , as a generally suitable reply to what he did not yet quite understand .
Naturally. ' ' If so be , my lad , ' returned the <NAME> .
There was no luxury in his room .
It ' s impossible to forget , ' turning his hands over and over and looking closely at them , ' that -- hem ! -- that in such a life as mine , I am unfortunately dependent on these men for something every hour in the day. ' Her arm was on his shoulder , but she did
<NAME> <NAME> crumpled up the licence , and thrust it into his coat pocket .
' Are you taking a walk ? ' ' <NAME> and I are going to take a long walk. ' ' Charming weather , ' remarked <NAME> , ' FOR a long walk. ' ' Ours is rather on business than mere pleasure , ' said the <NAME> .
But there was no harm in his way of saying this : it was said laughingly , and to beguile the time. " Any strongly marked expression of face on the part of a chief actor in a scene of great interest to whom many eyes are directed , will be unconsciously imitated by the spectators .
There were drives to milliners , dressmakers , jewellers , lawyers , florists , pastry-cooks ; and <NAME> was always of the party .
It was but an instant , a glance , a flash , before his eyes ; and they were gone .
' You have had a portentously long audience of my mother , ' said <NAME> , as the door closed upon them .
' How do you feel when you are dead ? ' asked <NAME> , much perplexed .
He was lame ; and as he feigned to be busy in arranging the table , glanced at the letters with a look so keen , and yet so dispirited and hopeless , that <NAME> could hardly bear to watch him .
' To the Angel at <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> , speaking very quickly .
He laid his hand upon it , and it clasped him with a trembling supplication .
He knows his old games and his old ways .
He wore knee breeches , and a kind of leggings rolled up over his silk stockings , and shoes with buckles ; he had ruffles at his wrists , a three-cornered hat on his head , and a long taper sword by his side .
' That sky-blue suit you used to wear. ' ' Lord , to be sure ! ' cried <NAME> , laughing .
And when you talk of <NAME> ' s good intentions -- ' ' I never talked of ' em , ' said <NAME> .
Come on ! ' ' I haven ' t got it , Mr <NAME> , ' Defaulter would reply .
Their young families , I am told , they usually leave at home .
<NAME> ! -- And the knitting-women , never faltering or pausing in their Work , count Two .
One fact was quite clear to the <NAME> , as <NAME> , sitting thoughtfully over his untasted dinner , dwelt on all that had happened ; namely , that however <NAME> ' s modesty might stand in the way of his perceiving it himself , he was , as one might say , a member of Mr <NAME> '
' So , when this lady died , wherever they took her , or wherever they put her , she went to <NAME> !
He was fast asleep ; lying , easily , with his head upon his arm , as I had often seen him lie at school .
" Will you open the case ? "
<NAME> ' t mention it , ' said <NAME> .
And yet he has received a round half-dozen within the last twenty-four hours .
He is not at all willing to see them , for when they have waited a full hour , and the clerk , on his bell being rung , takes the opportunity of mentioning as much , he brings forth no more encouraging message than that <NAME> has nothing to say to them and they had better not wait
Do you comprehend the imaginary case ? " " Quite. " " Put the case that the child grew up , and was married for money .
I do this so conscientiously , that I am happy to tell you I find the most worthless of men to be the dearest old fellow too : and am in a condition to make the gratifying report , that there is much less difference than you are inclined to suppose between an honest man and a scoundrel. '
I forgot myself half a minute ago .
You see your temper got the better of you ; that 's where you lost ground , " says <NAME> in an argumentative and friendly way .
<NAME> good-bye to your father , <NAME> .
I have only speculated on the coincidence ; I have not tried to account for it .
Only be a loving child to me in my age , and bear with my whims and fancies ; and you will do more for an old woman whose prime of life was not so happy or conciliating as it might have been , than ever that old woman did for you. ' It was the first time I
There was not a little tact and knowledge of the young lord ' s disposition in this mode of treating him .
' I -- I -- really think they are , ' urged <NAME> , somewhat alarmed .
Are you blind , deaf , senseless , dead ? ' said <NAME> .
Almost a night , <NAME> , " said <NAME> , " to bring the dead out of their graves. " " I never see the night myself , master -- nor yet I do n't expect to -- what would do that , " answered <NAME> .
The son , inheriting his mother 's belief , and having the deportment always before him , had lived and grown in the same faith , and now , at thirty years of age , worked for his father twelve hours a day and looked up to him with veneration on the old imaginary pinnacle .
Why , what had I to fear , I thought , when there was this nobility in the soul of a labouring man 's daughter !
" May be so , sir , may be so , " returned the other , taking <NAME> upon his knee and waving him off impatiently .
<NAME> replied , that he was ; and if she was too , she ought to hear his sister , <NAME> , sing .
'Do n't make such a row , ' said <NAME> , bolting the door .
I know every change of his face .
The ceiling was blackened , to prevent its colour from being injured by the flaring of the lamps ; and the place was so full of dense tobacco smoke , that at first it was scarcely possible to discern anything more .
What cheer , my lady lass ! ' ' <NAME> !
<NAME> police-officers on duty could now tell <NAME> what he wanted to know and point to him where to go .
' Of what , for <NAME> ' s sake ? ' ' I think she might have been mistrustful , mum , ' returned <NAME> with submission , ' of standing in Our <NAME> ' s light .
<NAME> <NAME> blows his nose , and <NAME> of the no surname is moved to do likewise , but lacking a pocket handkerchief abandons that outlet for his emotion .
' You ' re deep and you ' re ready .
' Banks , I know , are always suspicious , and officially must be , ' said the stranger , whose lightness and smoothness of speech were pleasant likewise ; suggesting matter far more sensible and humorous than it ever contained—which was perhaps a shrewd device of the founder of this numerous sect , whosoever may have been that
' Now , my dear friend -- ' I began .
A shadow even on that shadowed face , a sharpening even of the sharpened features , and a thickening of the veil before the eyes into a pall that shuts out the dim world , is come .
' Now , I hope you ' re contented , <NAME> ! ' The old woman , in token of her being so , released his arm and patted his back ; and the <NAME> , overcome with mortification , cross-examination , and liquor , folded his arms on the table , laid his head upon them , and
She had to sacrifice her sinful and shameful affections ; no more .
But there was not a face that passed in or out , which this man failed to see ; not a gesture at any one of the three tables that was lost upon him ; not a word , spoken by the bankers , but reached his ear ; not a winner or loser he could not have marked
" Was there a great sensation ? " " Why , " said <NAME> , " yes , there certainly were a peck of orange-peel .
' Nothing has been omitted , I hope ? ' said the <NAME> .
The ensuing business proceedings were brief but curious , and rather in the nature of a conspiracy .
His way taking him past <NAME> 's , and he both banking at <NAME> 's and knowing <NAME> as the intimate friend of the <NAME> , it entered <NAME> 's mind to enter the bank , and reveal to <NAME> the brightness of the <NAME> horizon .
' <NAME> has been in bed -- oh !
The chateau awoke later , as became its quality , but awoke gradually and surely .
cried the young lady , listening .
' I ' ll tell you what it is , young boa-constructer , ' said <NAME> impressively ; ' if you don ' t sleep a little less , and exercise a little more , wen you comes to be a man you ' ll lay yourself open to the same sort of personal inconwenience as was inflicted on
' For some time past , ' <NAME> faltered , ' there ' s been a servant about here , at odd times .
Mrs Tickit , finding no balsam for a wounded mind in <NAME> ' s <NAME> , suffered greatly from low spirits , and from moving recollections of <NAME> ' s infancy .
The <NAME> knows me , when I go down to be sworn ; and disposes of me easily , as if there were a Masonic understanding between us .
Of late , the grindstone did undoubtedly appear to have been whirling at his own nose rather than <NAME> ' s , but <NAME> ' s nose was now to be sharpened fine .
The sky had been lowering and dark for some time , and the commencement of a violent storm of rain drove <NAME> for shelter to a tree .
Beg your pardon , sir , ' said <NAME> , when he had concluded , ' but wen I gets on this here grievance , I runs on like a new barrow with the wheel greased. ' Having said which , and having paused for an instant to see whether he was wanted for anything more , <NAME> left
It isn ' t generally known , ' said <NAME> , dropping his voice ; ' but her figure was such , at that time , that the sign of the <NAME> , over in the <NAME> , was painted from it ! ' ' But only see what it is now , ' urged the married lady .
' I ' m glad to see you well again at last , neighbour , ' said the dwarf , sitting down opposite him .
There was a sale of the furniture and lease , at <NAME> ; and <NAME> told me , little thinking how interested I was in the story , that , paying all the just debts of the deceased , and deducting his share of outstanding bad and doubtful debts due to the firm , he wouldn ' t give
O save him to me !
He drank a quantity of wine after dinner , in vain .
' But the fun is , godmother , how I make the great ladies try my dresses on .
I wish you were. ' Mrs <NAME> bestowed a sweet and loving smile upon her friend , which <NAME> returned as she best could .
Mr Flintwinch , who had cast his eyes towards the portrait , twisted himself about again , and again found himself the subject of the same look and smile .
" Say on. " The figure in the chair between them , was all the time monotonously rocking itself to and fro , and moaning .
Is it you ? ' exclaimed <NAME> , raising herself a little .
And might I likewise observe , ' her father delicately hinted , with a glance out at window , ' that perhaps it might be calculated to attract attention , having one ' s hair publicly done by a lovely woman in an elegant turn-out in <NAME> ? ' <NAME> laughed and put on his hat again .
You are too great a man , <NAME> , to be thoughtful .
They had the air of a rough tribunal ; <NAME> One and Two sitting on the old pallet-bed , each with his chin resting on his hand , and his eyes intent on the road-mender ; <NAME> , equally intent , on one knee behind them , with his agitated hand always gliding over the network of fine nerves
There is nothing I can do for you , <NAME> ? ' ' Thank you , Mr Headstone .
The shot entered on the outside , halfway between the hip and knee joints. ' ' Brought to jail , <NAME> .
We can use force to him , but I would not hurt you if I could help it .
You are dear to me , <NAME> .
That was a wretched , miserable day ! ' A touch of pity for him mingled with her dislike of him , and she said : ' Mr Headstone , I am grieved to have done you any harm , but I have never meant it. ' ' There ! ' he cried , despairingly .
' <NAME> , I wish you would tell me whether you have any friend of your own sex and age. ' ' I have lived that lonely kind of life , that I have never had one , ' was the answer .
In manner , if not in words , he always testified his displeasure at these interruptions of the general harmony ; and it was so well understood , that delinquents usually withdrew if they were aware of him .
' I mean , ' said <NAME> , ' to put my money all together in one <NAME> , never try to get any more , go away into the country with my darling <NAME> , have a beautiful garden , fields , and woods , and live there with her all my life ! ' ' Indeed !
It was like a child , they said , and that made me think of it more .
Finding an excuse in the presence of <NAME> , whom they knew not how to dispose of without consulting his wishes , they concluded to act upon this resolution before going to bed .
I took such precautions as I could to hide from <NAME> that I had been crying , and I constrained myself to think of every sacred obligation that there was upon me to be careful and collected .
<NAME> is engaged as private master to the children , uncle , ' said Mrs. Kenwigs .
She was , at that time , within a few months of her confinement .
' Well , well , <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> , ' we will go there at once ; but first , as I have been rather ruffled , I should like a glass of brandy- and-water warm , <NAME> .
When we turned out of the town , round a corner , and <NAME> told us that the post-boy , who had for a long time sympathized with our heightened expectation , was looking back and nodding , we both stood up in the carriage ( <NAME> holding <NAME> lest she should be jolted down ) and gazed round

Do you start for <NAME> from here ? " " From here , at eight. " " I will come back , to see you off. " Very ill at ease with himself , and with <NAME> and most other men , <NAME> made the best of his way into the quiet of the <NAME> , opened the letter
He was a <NAME> gentleman ; a scientific gentleman ; a man of great acquirements -- a Doctor. " " Not of <NAME> ? " " Why , yes , of <NAME> .
They entered poor <NAME> 's house ; the dwelling he had visited before ; and found the mother and the children seated round the fire .
<NAME> ' t make fine play-acting speeches about bread , but earn it. ' ' How ? ' cried the other .
' The wind sounds up here , ' quoth Eugene , stirring the fire , ' as if we were keeping a lighthouse .
It burned all the time though , and roared and leaped when I came back , as it used to do in our play days .
'Not a soul , ' replied the woman ; 'we were alone .
I ' m obleeged to you , sir , for your welcoming manner of me .
The mention of Mr Casby again revived in <NAME> ' s memory the smouldering embers of curiosity and interest which Mrs <NAME> had fanned on the night of his arrival .
' Independently of my wish that you should not be idling about a place like this , for years to come , I feel that for a debtor in the Fleet to be attended by his manservant is a monstrous absurdity .
<NAME> , my third ( nine ) , one and sixpence halfpenny ; <NAME> , my fourth ( seven ) , eightpence to the <NAME> ; <NAME> , my youngest ( five ) , has voluntarily enrolled himself in the <NAME> of <NAME> , and is pledged never , through life , to use tobacco in any form .
So we all did : Traddles evidently lost in wondering at what distant time <NAME> and I could have been comrades in the battle of the world .
<NAME> at first objected slightly , on the score of distance ; but a hackney-coach being mentioned by her mistress , withdrew that opposition , and gave in her assent .
It was a close room with a skylight , and as dull and quiet as a room need be .
' Ask HIM. ' He meant <NAME> , who beamed with delight and assent over the bag of shrimps .
I did so , and did so every morning of my imprisonment , which lasted five days .
There are some books to be taken back , too . '
He smiled , and shot as evil a glance at me as could come from his dark eyes .
' I don ' t care who objects to their being called the <NAME> .
The single gentleman ' s door burst open .
'Very nice animals , ma'am , ' replied <NAME> , approvingly ; 'so very domestic . '
<NAME> may be , but is the property ?
I also felt that I had committed every crime in the <NAME> .
' Now , ' said <NAME> , ' just to set us going again , <NAME> , I don ' t mind singing a song. ' And <NAME> , incited thereto by tumultuous applause , plunged himself at once into ' The King , <NAME> bless him , ' which he sang as loud as he could , to
' What do you mean by daring to come here ? ' ' I didn ' t mean no harm , <NAME> , ' whimpered <NAME> , putting one hand to his throat , and the knuckles of the other to his eyes .
In general , more no than yes .
Where ' s your law for tying it up then ? ' The deepest character whom the turnkey sounded , was unable to produce his law for tying such a knot as that .
All the old ladies with the burdens on their heads , had greater or less cause of complaint against Mr <NAME> ; and the <NAME> and <NAME> coincided in thinking that if <NAME> must marry , he had better have married somebody nearer his own age , not quite so handsome , and a little better off .
There is something so inexpressibly absurd to me in the idea of <NAME> being married !
Have you no choice ? ' asked <NAME> .
' There ' s no time to tell you now .
And now , hosts of bewildering and confused ideas came crowding on his mind .
She had better have turned hideous and dropped dead , than have stood up with such a smile upon her face , in such a fallen spirit ' s majesty of scorn and beauty .
' I ' ll give you for a toast , ' said the <NAME> , ' Wal ' r ! ' ' Who ? ' submitted Mr Perch .
' So far from thinking there is anything wrong in conduct so natural , ' resumed <NAME> , ' it is my wish to assist and promote your wishes in this respect .
That done , extricate yourself , in <NAME> 's name , and we 'll see it out together , dear old boy. " It was a comfort to shake hands upon it , and walk up and down again , with only that done .
No thanks to you for it ! ' The boy stopping again , he moved his eyes again .
returned <NAME> in his easy light vein .
The largest and strongest man of the number changed swiftly to the side on which he came up , and dexterously closed with him and went down with him ; but not before the heavy stick had descended smartly .
He was not reading now , but walking up and down despairingly .
But however , but however , he might have had amiable intentions .
I haven ' t seen a pretty woman since I ' ve been here , jemmy. ' ' No ? ' said <NAME> .
Opening this packet , with his old flourish , and glancing at the contents , as if he cherished an artistic admiration of their style of composition , he began to read as follows : ' " Dear Miss Trotwood and gentlemen -- " ' ' Bless and save the man ! ' exclaimed my aunt in a low
It is given out that my <NAME> has gone down into <NAME> , but is expected to return presently .
' Talent there , sir ! ' said the savage , nodding towards <NAME> .
" Is it a good sign , that he wishes to see <NAME> and <NAME> ? " " <NAME> , " said <NAME> ; " judiciously show a cat milk , if you wish her to thirst for it .
'No , no , he has not had one , ' said <NAME> , laughing .
I hope so ! ' ' Pardon me , ' returned <NAME> , who thoroughly knew his man , and had taken his ground accordingly ; ' you do not hear me out .
Do n't stop here a minute .
Sad-coloured curtains , whose proportions were spare and lean , hid themselves despondently behind the windows .
He told me instead , with much rapidity , a good deal about her skill , and her profits ; and about her being a scientific cupper , if I should ever have occasion for her service in that capacity .
" It 's impossible to say whether she knows it or not .
The <NAME> , meanwhile , who seemed to have quite forgotten his own dinner , laid down his knife and fork , and drew his chair to the sofa .
' That ' s well , ' said the Secretary .
On the last night of my restraint , I was awakened by hearing my own name spoken in a whisper .
' Becoming. ' ' Becoming what ? ' said <NAME> , sharply .
But , ' bringing his chair nearer , and laying one hand upon my knee -- ' clouds , sir -- clouds. ' I answered the solicitude which his face expressed , by conveying the same expression into my own , and shaking my head .
' A -- in fact it ' s not a -- ' <NAME> beginning again , thus , comes to a dead stop .
He began to walk about the room with his hands in his pockets , showing that he had been thinking as much .
' No ; but DO you think so , <NAME> ? ' said Mrs. Nickleby , with as much gravity as if it were a question of the most imminent and thrilling interest .
Mrs. <NAME> was taken with a troublesome cough , in the midst of which she articulated with much difficulty .
It was even understood by <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , as well as by the young gentlemen in general , that <NAME> had somehow constituted himself protector and guardian of <NAME> , and the circumstance became so notorious , even to Mrs Pipchin , that the good old creature cherished feelings of bitterness and jealousy against <NAME>
Is there anything I can order for you ? "
The difference is merely in a lawyer 's mind . "
There was no foreseeing at that time whether he would be absent months or years .
<NAME> to bed she went , saving for a few coarse fragments ; and those she sat mumbling and munching over a scrap of fire , long after her undutiful daughter lay asleep .
They reached the town about one o ' clock ( their luggage they had directed to be forwarded to the city , from <NAME> ) , and being fortunate enough to secure places on the outside of a coach , arrived in <NAME> in sound health and spirits , on that same afternoon .
Having but partially undressed , I clamber on my shelf , and hold the curtain open for a few minutes while I look round on all my fellow-travellers again .
The ecstasies consequent upon the effort had not yet subsided , and <NAME> ( who had not been thoroughly sober at so late an hour for a long long time , ) had not yet been able to put in a word of announcement , that the punch was ready , when a hasty knock was heard at the
' Most audiences are , when they have good acting -- real good acting -- the regular thing , ' replied <NAME> , forcibly .
' Should you do it in your fancy , when you were lying here doing this ? ' She nods her head .
The family were not there , I had heard on my arrival , and were not expected .
The <NAME> was all alive .
He was dressed in a gorgeous morning gown , with a waistcoat and <NAME> trousers of the same pattern , a pink silk neckerchief , and bright green slippers , and had a very copious watch-chain wound round his body .
'Gentleness and care , ' exclaimed the doctor .
But I read it through three times before I laid it down .
Thus I enjoy the pleasures of the chase , and derive great benefit from the healthful exercise .
I looked out , and she stood at the garden-gate alone , holding her baby up in her arms for me to see .
I hope he may repent of all the wickedness and sin to which he has been a party. ' I observed that several gentlemen were shading their eyes , each with one hand , as if they had just come into church .
<NAME> , upon this , starting up , demanded what I meant by that ?
It is no great effort to make , I am sure , for such a friend as she has been to me .
It happened on two or three occasions in my presence , that his desperate reputation was alluded to by one or other of the people in attendance on him .
Having passed the time I spent in <NAME> , in making myself acquainted with these things , in settling the course I should take in my future travels , and in mixing constantly with its society , I am not aware that I have any occasion to prolong this chapter .
She was a pretty , good-natured girl , and put my hair away from my eyes with a soft , kind touch ; but she was very cheerful at having nearly finished her work and being in good time , and was so different from me !
I could not bear the presence of that woman <NAME> .
The <NAME> , well pleased to receive it , made preparation of pipes and rum and water , and awaited his visitor in the back parlour .
It costs a mint of money. ' ' How much might that be ? ' <NAME> calmly asked .
My circumstances being so very pressing , however , I said I would take ninepence for it , if he pleased .
But I say she is so high , so very high .
' Nothing , darling ; nothing , ' returned <NAME> .
Mrs Blimber was affected , but gently so ; and told the <NAME> Mr Alfred Feeder , <NAME> , on the way home , that if she could only have seen <NAME> in his retirement at <NAME> , she would not have had a wish , now , ungratified .
" They was a-eating of it , I expect , " says <NAME> .
' But I shall be missed ; ' he came back to that ; ' and I don ' t want ' em to miss me .
My aunt , with one clap of her hands , and one look through her spectacles , immediately went into hysterics , for the first and only time in all my knowledge of her .
But it 's better than nothing , and better than enlistment .
' On suspicion of -- ' ' Of seaman ' s pocket , ' said Mr Riderhood .
If I were weak now , what had I profited by those mercies ?
that ' s it , is it ? ' said <NAME> ; ' that ' s a wery bad complaint , that. ' ' And yet the temptation , you see , <NAME> , ' observed <NAME> .
Let her come to-morrow ! ' The last time was on a genial day in spring .
You never can show better than as your own natural self , my sweet <NAME> ; and we ' ll try no conceited experiments , but go back to our old way , and be happy. ' ' And be happy ! ' returned <NAME> .
The ivy and the moss crept in thick clusters over the old trees , and the soft green turf overspread the ground like a silken mat .
It must be <NAME> . "
How old were you when you came upon him in the little churchyard ? " " I think in my seventh year. " " Ay .
<NAME> at her here , with her poor cap half off her head and her poor hair all in a muddle .
' I am merely passing on , like the shadow over the sun-dial .
<NAME> said he was glad to think that this wealth flowed into the coffers of a gentleman who accepted it with meekness .
Mr <NAME> , who now descries an opportunity of bringing down the spirits of the ladies to his own level , says wait and see ; he wishes some people were well out of this .
We had left <NAME> 's Inn more than a year , and lived in the Temple .
' By your leave , <NAME> , ' retorted the charwoman , turning sharp round .
You are betrayed and sold for money ; for gold , whose every coin is rusted with tears , if not red with the blood of ruined men , who have fallen desperately by their own mad hands. ' ' You say you have a duty to discharge , ' said <NAME> , ' and so have I .
That old girl reappearing by and by , quite fresh , and sitting down to her needlework , then and only then -- the greens being only then to be considered as entirely off her mind -- <NAME> requests the trooper to state his case .
Moving On It is the long vacation in the regions of <NAME> .
I had tried hard at it , but had made nothing of it .
You must remember that your uncle ' s state requires -- hum -- great forbearance from us , great forbearance. ' ' I am sure , ' cried <NAME> , piteously , ' it is only charitable to suppose that there must be something wrong in him somewhere , or he never could have so attacked Me , of
Too much of him every way ; pervadingly too much nose of a coarse wrong shape , and his nose in his mind and his manners ; too much smile to be real ; too much frown to be false ; too many large teeth to be visible at once without suggesting a bite .
Do I excuse her for it ?
' <NAME> astonished ME ! ' returned <NAME> , with a very serious countenance .
" I think I shall trade , also , " said he , putting his thumbs in his waist-coat pockets , " to the <NAME> , for sugar , tobacco , and rum .
' You make my blood run cold , ' said <NAME> .
At length he turned to her , and speaking very gently , hoped she would say a prayer that night for a sick child .
I was so very nervous , that I had already lighted the <NAME> 's sausage like a torch , and been obliged to blow it out .
He looked at himself in the glass again ; went closer to it to dash a grain or two of dust out of the corner of his eye ; and settled his cravat .
Not more than other gentlemen do .
Put up the gig afterwards. ' ' Now , boys ! ' cried the landlord -- ' chaise-and-four out -- make haste -- look alive there ! ' <NAME> ran the hostlers and the boys .
<NAME> , because a hideous small boy was stoning it through the railings , and had already lamed it in one leg , and was much excited by the benevolent sportsmanlike purpose of breaking its other three legs , and bringing it down .
But he never justified himself by a hint tending that way , or tried to bend the past out of its eternal shape .
" The very thing we both said yesterday , Esther ! "
She sat down at the window where she had spent so many evenings -- darker far than this -- and every thought of hope or cheerfulness that had occurred to her in that place came vividly upon her mind , and blotted out all its dull and mournful associations in an instant .
This led to our saying again , with a great deal of gravity , all that we had said already and to our coming to much the same conclusion afterwards .
I returned to my fireside , and was musing , half gravely and half laughing , on the character of <NAME> and the old relations between us , when I heard a quick step ascending the stairs .
<NAME> green-peas were produced at <NAME> , and intellectual asparagus all the year round .
Consider it addressed to yourself , if you choose .
I know how she was lost. ' Here he looked majestically at <NAME> .
' They are perfectly new to me , and may be founded altogether on your own imagination. ' ' You will see. ' These same fields were opposite the <NAME> premises .
Sometimes I fancied that <NAME> perhaps objected to my mother ' s wearing all the pretty dresses she had in her drawers , or to her going so often to visit at that neighbour ' s ; but I couldn ' t , to my satisfaction , make out how it was .
Oh , home , home ! ' <NAME> placed herself in a chair , within view of the door , and looked downward , as if <NAME> were crouching on the floor before her .
Then Mr Tite Barnacle could not but feel that there was a person in company , who would have disturbed his life-long sitting to <NAME> in full official character , if such disturbance had been possible : while <NAME> junior did , with indignation , communicate to two vapid gentlemen , his relatives , that there was a feller
'He knows you , ' replied the girl ; 'and knew you were here , for it was by hearing him tell the place that I found you out . '
If any man has got anything to say again <NAME> , let him say it TO Jem Groves , and <NAME> can accommodate him with a customer on any terms from four pound a side to forty .
They never could have been , I think , as good as they have been to me , if I had taken them from any other hands. ' ' Makes her mother nothing ! ' exclaimed Mrs. Markleham .
By Heaven I will ! ' And so , with the last sobs and last loving words , and a last look to <NAME> of confidence in his promise , <NAME> fell back in the carriage , and her husband waved his hand , and they were away for <NAME> ; though not until the faithful Mrs Tickit ,
All the letters he had ever written to her , she kept in a cabinet near her own chair by the fire ; and she would have read me some of them , and I should have been very glad to hear them too , if he had not interposed , and coaxed her out of the design .
' About an old sexton , that the good people down here suppose to have been carried away by goblins. ' ' Suppose ! ' ejaculated the old lady .
There was a kind of settled trouble in the face .
<NAME> , not knowing but that he has just robbed her of her money , follows in chase and runs so hard that he runs the boy down a dozen times , but each time he repeats the curve , the duck , the dive , and scours away again .
He mentioned a terrace at the western end of <NAME> , fronting <NAME> , on which he had always had his eye , but which he did not expect to attain immediately , as it would require a large establishment .
There is the brilliant genius who turned the shares into that remarkably exact sum of three hundred and seventy five thousand pounds , no shillings , and nopence .
' You are as pale as a candle. ' Mr <NAME> replied , with literal exactness , that he felt as if he had had a turn .
' What did you think of that performance ? ' ' So far as I could judge , being on the stage , ' replied <NAME> , ' I thought it very agreeable. ' ' Agreeable ! ' cried the collector .
A smooth-cheeked , fresh-coloured , sandy-whiskered man of thirty .
<NAME> people as the phrase is , professors of a stern religion , their very religion was a gloomy sacrifice of tastes and sympathies that were never their own , offered up as a part of a bargain for the security of their possessions .
On his remembering it , it suggested hope to <NAME> that the recognition might be of later date than the night of the visit at his mother ' s ; but <NAME> was too exact and clear about time and place , to leave any opening for doubt that it had preceded that occasion .
' I want your assistance , my dear fellow , in an affair of honour , ' said <NAME> .
I sat thinking of it long after he had ascended to the clouds in a large watch-case , and still I could not make it out .
Any how , I sat with my elbow on my knee and my face upon my hand , looking into the fire , as those two talked about my going away , and about what they should do without me , and all that .
That <NAME> was the best , the truest , the most faithful , most devoted , and most self-denying friend and servant in the world ; who had ever loved me dearly , who had ever loved my mother dearly ; who had held my mother ' s dying head upon her arm , on whose face my mother
I am limited as to situation .
' I will , if you ' ll give me something to quench my thirst first. ' The bottle and jug were again produced , and he mixed a weak draught , and another , and drank both in quick succession .
Not sea-sick , be it understood , in the ordinary acceptation of the term : I wish I had been : but in a form which I have never seen or heard described , though I have no doubt it is very common .
This was an unanswerable reply , and silence prevailed again .
In hasty notes to intimate acquaintance , I sometimes sign myself " Afternoon. " It amuses my friends very much , <NAME> Pickwick. ' ' It is calculated to afford them the highest gratification , I should conceive , ' said <NAME> , rather envying the ease with which <NAME> ' s friends were entertained .
" So soon ? " <NAME> had taken some refreshment on the road , and required none then , and was extremely anxious to see the gentleman from <NAME> 's immediately , if it suited his pleasure and convenience .
Whatever he put on , became him less ( it dismally seemed to me ) than what he had worn before .
I should have such strength , ' muttered the robber , poising his brawny arm , 'that I could smash your head as if a loaded waggon had gone over it . '
What are you talking about ? ' ' Look here , <NAME> ' otherest Governor , ' replied the man , becoming hoarsely confidential .
For he looked at me for an answer .
I think I recollect though , that you read with his father ? " " Yes. " I made the admission with reluctance , for it seemed to have a boyish look , and she already treated me more than enough like a boy .
But , seeing only <NAME> , with his good-natured face , simple manner , and hair on end , he dismissed it as he replied , with a jerk of his whole body , but especially his throat : ' I am sorry for that , <NAME> .
It was a late hour in such by-places , and the people were abed ; but a voice answered from an upper window , <NAME> miles .
We went downstairs , followed by <NAME> , as I soon found the little man to be .
When she had finished her breakfast , my aunt very deliberately leaned back in her chair , knitted her brows , folded her arms , and contemplated me at her leisure , with such a fixedness of attention that I was quite overpowered by embarrassment .
He 'd be of use to us ; he knows how to train the girl already .
<NAME> was heard , on all sides , but the sounds of feasting and revelry -- except the chinking of money as it was paid in by the people to the collector of the royal treasures , to defray the expenses of the happy ceremony .
' Treating <NAME> ' s offer of eighteen bob a week , and a rise if he behaved himself , like dirt , ' replied <NAME> .
I won ' t answer anything else ; I can ' t .
On the question being propounded whether he could go and find her , the page desponded and thought not ; but being stimulated with a shilling , the page grew sanguine and thought he could .
The secret was well kept , and <NAME> was unconscious and happy ; but he could not fail to observe that the shoemaker , whose hand had been a little out at first , was growing dreadfully skilful , and that he had never been so intent on his work , and that his hands had never been so
<NAME> ' s of no use to me no more , except to live .
I recollect him ! ' He had not been about to repeat that former action of taking him by the chin , but the boy had suspected him of it , and had thrown up his arm with an angry start .
To <NAME> , as usual .
' Then come up , ' said the carrier to the lazy horse ; who came up accordingly .
' I beg your pardon for interrupting you , sir , ' returned <NAME> ; ' but I am sure you know that the whole social system is a question of self-interest .
' <NAME> is done in its regular season of the year , I think ? ' <NAME> was right .
<NAME> , <NAME> ? " <NAME> , with a majestic remembrance of old discomfiture , assented ; but not warmly .
He crossed to the door to see that it was shut ( but I had seen to that ) and resumed his seat before me .
Falling into that kind of abstraction which such a solitude awakens , the child continued to gaze upon the passing crowd with a wondering interest , amounting almost to a temporary forgetfulness of her own condition .
Now , she , with all her might of passionate and proud resentment , bent her dark glance from day to day , and hour to hour -- from that night in her own chamber , when she had sat gazing at the shadows on the wall , to the deeper night fast coming -- upon one figure directing
Yes , I live at <NAME> ' s -- more shame for me , I suppose ? ' ' That ' s a mere matter of opinion , ' said the Notary , shrugging his shoulders .
<NAME> , otherwise than as he finds expression through these dulcet tones , is rarely heard .
<NAME> home , sir , strike home ! "
' There ' s your money , ' said <NAME> , who in pursuance of her system , and in recollection of the <NAME> , was accustomed to rout the servants about , as she had routed her young <NAME> boarders ; to the everlasting acidulation of <NAME> , ' and the sooner this house sees your back the
' You have been so good to me , ' says <NAME> , ' I am so grateful to you , I have such reason to like you for being a kind friend to me , and I do like you so much ; ' and here the ingenuous face smiles upon him with the pleasantest look of honesty
I am yours anywhere , everywhere !
I felt sure that some uncommon eye must have picked that girl out .
I am <NAME> of <NAME> , and that ' s enough for me .
' You shall smart for this , ' gasped <NAME> .
But , my dear , I have been there many years , and I have noticed .
Being work , it has to be done ; but it ' s easily enough done .
The room <NAME> ' s deceased father had occupied for business purposes , when he first remembered him , was so unaltered that he might have been imagined still to keep it invisibly , as his visible relict kept her room up-stairs ; <NAME> still going between them negotiating .
How much apiece was it ?
" I 've been a sheep-farmer , stock-breeder , other trades besides , away in the new world , " said he ; " many a thousand mile of stormy water off from this. " " I hope you have done well ? " " I 've done wonderfully well .
So <NAME> ' s mother lies unmentioned of her dear friends , who are deaf to the waves that are hoarse with repetition of their mystery , and blind to the dust that is piled upon the shore , and to the white arms that are beckoning , in the moonlight , to the invisible country far away .
His eyes may never look at me again .
' This is the room , is it ? ' said the gentleman .
' How is <NAME> , <NAME> ? ' asked Mrs. Sparsit .
' Let him assault you , <NAME> ; don ' t return it on any account. ' ' No , no , I won ' t return it , ' said <NAME> , falling back a little more as he spoke ; to the evident relief of his partner , who by these means was gradually getting into the
He is a town-made article , of small stature and weazen features , but may be perceived from a considerable distance by means of his very tall hat .
Is any gentleman present , ' said Mr <NAME> , breaking off and looking round , ' acquainted with the <NAME> ? ' Bleeding Heart <NAME> was shy of claiming that acquaintance .
As <NAME> happened , however , very fortunately for himself , to be of a serious and composed countenance , he escaped the secret danger that threatened him .
Which he ain ' t , and he don ' t. ' ' What is that to me ? ' ' T ' otherest Governor , ' returned the man in a tone of injured innocence , ' if you don ' t care to hear no more , don ' t hear no more .
She ain ' t my child ; I never had one ; but I couldn ' t love her more .
" You shall have a dinner , old girl , " says <NAME> .
I never saw him such good company .
And now , a sudden twist and stoppage of the carriage inspired Mr Dorrit with the mistrust that the brigand moment was come for twisting him into a ditch and robbing him ; until , letting down the glass again and looking out , he perceived himself assailed by nothing worse than a funeral procession , which came mechanically
Do n't try on useless measures .
There must be no mistakes in life with <NAME> .
But touch her on the children -- or myself -- and she 's off like gunpowder . "
" <NAME> ought to consider it in the rent .
' I have signed it for the ladies , ma ' am , ' he said , ' and you ' ll have the goodness to sign it for yourself , <NAME> and <NAME> , there , if you please. ' ' Mr .
From the first he had sought to conciliate that gentleman , for the sake of the deserted girl .
' My dear , ' said <NAME> , ' that is entirely your fault. ' ' My fault , my heart ' s joy ? ' ' <NAME> , ' returned the lady ; ' what can you expect , dearest , if you will not correct the man ? ' ' Correct the man , my soul '
There was no danger of these documents betraying anything , if accidentally lost ; for long before a word was dry , it became as profound a mystery to <NAME> , as if he had had no part whatever in its production .
It was quite spotless in its cleanliness .
As soon as the paper was sent out upon its travels , the two officers resumed their former quiet work of writing with neatness and care .
You knew so much , and I knew so little , and it was so natural in many ways , going as you were among other friends , that I had nothing to complain of , and was not at all hurt. ' Her colour rose as she said it modestly and hurriedly .
Notwithstanding the most superlative , and , I may say , supernat'ral exertions on the part of this parish , ' said <NAME> , 'we have never been able to discover who is his father , or what was his mother 's settlement , name , or condition . '
Personally , ' said Mr Rugg , ' I have no opinion on the topic. ' ' That ' s well , ' returned <NAME> .
' If we could have packed the brute off with <NAME> ; -- but however ; that ' s spilled milk. ' As <NAME> , standing gathering up the skirts of his dressing-gown with his back to the fire , said this , looking down at his wife , she turned pale and looked down at the ground .
' I had got over it , sir , ' said <NAME> .
' Oh , don ' t cry , ' said <NAME> piteously .
It ' s no use asking me .
Wounded and shocked , and yet unable to reconcile this with her affection when they did meet , she sought her in her own room at night , once more .
' We must have a habeas-corpus .
Good-night ! ' ' Well , since no better can be , ' said <NAME> , turning on his heel , ' Good-night ! ' But he turned again as the other set forth , and added under his breath , looking after him with a leer : ' You wouldn ' t be let to go like that
My daily journeys to <NAME> considered , <NAME> was a long way off ; and I naturally wanted to go there as often as I could .
" Bad taste , " said <NAME> , laughing , " but a fact .
After tea , they had some music .
You are dissatisfied on account of my rise in fortune , and you ca n't help showing it. " " If you have the heart to think so , " returned <NAME> , " say so .
I have been walking these seven days . '
It ' s only that wet curl-paper of a man , <NAME> , that anyone might almost make away with , with a touch , and really it would be a blessed event for all parties if someone would take pity on him , and would have the goodness ! ' ' Does he give up the ship ,
My opinion of those accessories was not favorable .
At any garrisoned point where the line of demarcation between one country and another is so very narrow as at <NAME> , desertion from the ranks can scarcely fail to be of frequent occurrence : and it may be reasonably supposed that when the soldiers entertain the wildest and maddest hopes of the fortune and independence that await them
You ' ll want it on the road ! ' <NAME> was considerably startled by these very economical arrangements ; but he had no time to reflect upon them , for the little boys had to be got up to the top of the coach , and their boxes had to be brought out and put in , and

ha , ha , ha ! ' This sally seemed to tickle the clerk amazingly , and he once more enjoyed a little quiet laugh to himself .
' It ' s gone now , ' said <NAME> .
You 're pretty sure that I 've got a motive .
Why , the truth is , <NAME> repeatedly labours under the impression that <NAME> is going to speak to him , and turning finds that it is not so , and mostly that she has her eyes upon Veneering .
<NAME> <NAME> glanced at these frivolities with great contempt , and gave a double knock , which , having been thrice repeated , was answered by a servant girl with an uncommonly dirty face .

" I am working late to-night , " said I , " because I could n't sleep and wished to tire myself .
Now , what do you say ? " I said that I would get him the file , and I would get him what broken bits of food I could , and I would come to him at the <NAME> , early in the morning .
I tried to say something soothing .

All this Mrs <NAME> communicated to her brother before dinner : and it by no means indisposed Mr Dombey to receive the Major with unwonted cordiality .
To any one acquainted with these points of the domestic economy of the establishment , and conversant with the admirable regulation of <NAME> ' s mind , his appearance and behaviour on the morning previous to that which had been fixed upon for the journey to <NAME> would have been most mysterious and unaccountable .
Yet , for half the night , or more , Mr <NAME> , lying sometimes on his back with his eyes upon the ceiling , and sometimes half out of bed to correct himself by the book , played this unhappy tune over and over again ; never leaving off , save for a minute or two at a

Describe your father as a horsebreaker .
Even then she was in a difficulty from being unable to call it to mind , until he explained that he had had the honour of seeing her at <NAME> .
But he had paid madame his little note at it over night , and wanted to see nobody -- wanted nothing but to get on his shoes and his knapsack , open the door , and run away .

Now , <NAME> was a fat man , and a choleric ; so , instead of responding to this open-hearted salutation in a kindred spirit , he gave the little wicket a tremendous shake , and then bestowed upon it a kick which could have emanated from no leg but a beadle 's .

" Stop half a moment , <NAME> , " said the strange man .
At once , I think. " " If <NAME> has the intention of going at once , " said <NAME> to <NAME> , " he need n't write an answer , you know. " Receiving this as an intimation that it was best not to delay , I settled that I would go to-morrow , and said so .

'Phil has something more to do , before we can afford to part with him ; so go back to the company , my dear , and tell them to lead merry lives -- _while they last_ .

He smiled , reproaching her , and she coloured , reproaching herself -- both , with the knowledge that she had meant to entrap him into an answer not true -- when he said ' I know OF them. ' ' Truly , he told us he had seen you but once. ' ' Truly , I supposed he

Now , if there was one thing in the whole range of domestic art , which the widow could manufacture better than another , it was this identical article ; and the first tumbler was adapted to <NAME> ' s taste with such peculiar nicety , that he ordered a second with the least possible delay .
' Perhaps the lady would not object , ' said the president with great respect , and a merry twinkle in his eye .
By degrees , they began to recall circumstances more and more pleasant in their nature , until , what between talking , walking , and laughing , they reached <NAME> in such good heart , that <NAME> ' s mother declared she never felt less tired or in better spirits .
' Very low , ' said <NAME> , shaking his head ; ' reaction .
But she had resumed her old seat in front of the fire , and sat , perfectly motionless before it .
What ' s come of my milk of human kindness ?
" Assuredly ; mademoiselle , I am thankful for your politeness .
<NAME> <NAME> looks at him as if his face were a vista of some miles in length and he were leisurely contemplating the same .
Well , she tries walking , <NAME> rejoins .
And passing the painful scene of that day in review before me many times , I always saw that the poor gentleman believed the story readily , because I was one of the Jews -- that you believed the story readily , my child , because I was one of the Jews -- that the story itself first came
<NAME> was his pride and joy , sir .
I am sure <NAME> held his .
He put a chair for me , shut his book , and put it by , and turned his kind attentive face towards me .
I would n't hurt you for the world . "
Nothing but the serious assurance of his friend Copperfield to the contrary , he observed , could deprive him of the impression that his friend <NAME> loved and was beloved .
That sagacious <NAME> , too ; that amiable , though quite used up , recluse ; that little patriarch of something less than twenty , who had done with the world , and mustn ' t on any account have the slumbering echoes in the caverns of <NAME> awakened ; what a kind thing she did !
<NAME> , quiet and self-possessed , looks to <NAME> , as expecting his answer or comment .
What was his discomfiture , when he heard the chain and bolts withdrawn , and saw the door slowly opening , wider and wider !
It seemed a ' most wicked and cruel to so much as think such a thing ; but now that he tries to throw it upon father , I go back to it as if it was a truth .
' You are an excitable youth , <NAME> , ' he said ; ' and should endeavour to cool down a little now , for it would be unwise to encourage feverish predispositions .
<NAME> at this ! ' In a concluding round of great severity , the <NAME> administered and escaped all sorts of punishment , and wound up by getting the old lady ' s cap into Chancery—such is the technical term used in scientific circles by the learned in the <NAME> Art—with a lightness of touch that hardly stirred the
" Nor the man to allow his junior to be walked over either ? "
' A lady who is stopping in this house , ' answered the girl .

I mentioned my reason for desiring to avoid observation in the village , and he lauded it to the skies .
' Wretched man ! ' cried <NAME> , looking at him languidly , ' pray be silent. ' ' J .
The words are not quite under my command in the manner of pronouncing them . "
But a cry of recognition proceeding from the party , and <NAME> running up to the Captain with open arms , the <NAME> struck .
I ' ll partake of no one ' s hospitality , until I have -- a -- moved <NAME> -- to eruption -- on -- a -- the abandoned rascal -- HEEP !
His indecision was soon gone .
Did you ever hear from <NAME> , your mother , that I went to see her once ? ' ' No , sir , ' returned <NAME> , shortly .
Nothing straightfor ' ard , nothing on the square .
' It ' ll come in to a eighth of a inch , ' says <NAME> .
Come along ! ' It passed into <NAME> ' s mind that a change of some sort , best expressed perhaps as an intensification of all that was wildest and most negligent and reckless in his friend , had come upon him in the last half-hour or so .
But not only was there no Constable there , but no discovery had yet been made of the robbery .
" Yes , he took legal proceedings , " said <NAME> .
I never lie down at night but I know that in the course of that day he has alleviated pain and soothed some fellow-creature in the time of need .
If they was to sell off these things now , he ' d die of it .
I ' ll throw myself out of window .
But he who sold his birthright for a mess of pottage existed , and <NAME> existed , and <NAME> existed , and this man exists ! ' Here , a brief press and confusion near the stage , ended in the man himself standing at the orator ' s side before the concourse .
The influence for all good , which she came to exercise over me at a later time , begins already to descend upon my breast .
He had laid out the few feet of ground , behind , with exquisite neatness , and had made a little bed in the centre , that looked , by-the-bye , like a grave .

You ' ll never guess , my dears .
He would call at <NAME> 's <NAME> Tuesday morning at nine o'clock , when if not agreeable please leave word .
After that knock they heard a movement below , and somebody shuffling up towards the door .
And I tell you nothing but what did pass betwixt me and father. ' Mr Plornish , as being of a more laconic temperament , embraced this opportunity of interposing with the suggestion that she should now leave Mr Clennam to himself .
That he had left me at the forge , -- far from contented , yet , by comparison happy !

Dumkins confidently awaited its coming with his eyes fixed on the motions of <NAME> .
My first thought was one of great thankfulness that I had never breathed this last baffled hope to <NAME> .
With more kisses , and hugs , and tears , than many young gentlemen who start upon their travels , and leave well-stocked homes behind them , would deem within the bounds of probability ( if matter so low could be herein set down ) , <NAME> left the house at an early hour next morning , and set

If not , you may let me find you waiting for me somewhere near your mother ' s house this afternoon .
' If we should want it so very , very badly that we can not do without it , let me ask you for it. ' ' I <NAME> , -- I Will. ' ' Don ' t encourage him to ask .
' There is nothing to be made uneasy by , in that , ' said <NAME> .
' Very sorry to leave you standing at the door , <NAME> , ' said the girl , lighting a lamp , and addressing <NAME> with a winning smile , ' but you was quite strangers to me ; and we have such a many trampers that only come to see what they can lay their hands on ,

How should a repetition of it be treated ?
<NAME> was then despatched for a hackney-coach , and in it the triumvirate proceeded to <NAME> .
' And this is popularity ! ' The landlord took a step or two towards the door ; the stranger fixing his eyes upon him , resumed .

The Shadow One of the first considerations which arose in the business mind of <NAME> when business hours came round , was this : -- that he had no right to imperil <NAME> 's by sheltering the wife of an emigrant prisoner under the <NAME> roof .
' I ' ll never come again , <NAME> .
' I hope so , ' said Mr Carker , with an expressive look at the couple in the distance , as he drew towards the door , following the Major .
I shall not conceal , as I go on , the weaknesses I could not quite conquer , but they always passed from me soon and the happier frame of mind stayed by me faithfully .
It misgave him that the Chief <NAME> must have known a <NAME> , and must have seen him in the <NAME> -- perhaps had been presented to him .
' Who could live to gaze from day to day on bricks and slates who had once felt the influence of a scene like this ?
I am violent , I know .
For , <NAME> , besides unmistakingly glaring petrifaction at the fascinating <NAME> , follows every lively remark made by that dear creature , with an audible snort : which may be referable to a chronic cold in the head , but may also be referable to indignation and contempt .
This was not a very politic step , as it turned out ; for the pigs scenting him , and looking upon the coach as a kind of pie with some manner of meat inside , grunted round it so hideously , that he was afraid to come out again , and lay there shivering , till morning .
" Then you 're wrong , Jack. " In the infinite meaning of his reply and his boundless confidence in his views , the <NAME> took one of his bloated shoes off , looked into it , knocked a few stones out of it on the kitchen floor , and put it on again .
' <NAME> is becoming , ' said <NAME> , ' almost a young man. ' Time passed <NAME> on in the mill , while his father was thinking about it , and there he stood in a long-tailed coat and a stiff shirt-collar .

' There has been no opportunity. ' I thought <NAME> was disappointed .
I am not the master .
A trying suspense , to be passing a whole summer night on the brink of the black ocean , ready to take that plunge into it upon which <NAME> had resolved !
replied <NAME> , stowing them away .
It is such a sight as we read of in legends of enchanted forests : saving that it is sad to see these noble works wasting away so awfully , alone ; and to think how many years must come and go before the magic that created them will rear their like upon this ground again .
To account for the rapidity with which this young lady had conceived a passion for <NAME> , it may be necessary to state , that the friend from whom she had so recently returned , was a miller ' s daughter of only eighteen , who had contracted herself unto the son of a small corn-factor , resident in
For the truth of this , I appealed to <NAME> .
If I had any influence with you , I would simply use it to soften your judgment of me in causing you this disappointment : to represent to you that I have lived the half of a long term of life , and have never before set my own will against yours .
Having nothing living to stone at the moment , he is discovered by <NAME> in the unholy office of stoning the dead , through the railings of the churchyard .
" <NAME> , " replies <NAME> , who has a list in his hand , " we are doing tolerably . "
' Take the top one off , my love. ' ' But it won ' t come off ! ' said <NAME> , trying very hard , and looking very much distressed .
He was perfectly quiet during the first part of the journey : indeed I don ' t remember having so much as seen him until he was brought out by circumstances , as great men often are .
Her lips seemed to repeat ' Wonderful fortune ? ' He repeated it again , aloud .
No better man living to hold fast by what <NAME> 's had in keeping , and to hold his peace .
More solitary than <NAME> , who had nobody to look at him and see that he was solitary , I went into the booking-office , and , by invitation of the clerk on duty , passed behind the counter , and sat down on the scale at which they weighed the luggage .
<NAME> appeared , pulled off his hat , and smiled .
But I can ' t always look at him -- I know him without that white thing on , and I am afraid of his wondering why I stare so , and perhaps stopping the service to inquire -- and what am I to do ?
' I do not know that .
' Won ' t it do in the morning ? ' said the woman .
' But it ' s my opinion that she does know what she doesn ' t like , and that ' s of more importance. ' ' I wish , ' said <NAME> , setting his teeth together , and speaking more like a savage warrior who fed on raw wolf ' s flesh which he carved with his
They always die when I 'm at meals .

He had heard fragments of tunes and songs in the warm wind , which he knew had no existence .

" I do n't mind telling YOU , " says <NAME> with an engaging appearance of frankness , " that as far as I can understand it , there seems to be a doubt whether this dead person was n't entitled to a little property , and whether this female has n't been up to some games respecting that

' I have been making inquiries in the neighbourhood in which his old master lived , ' said the stranger , ' and I learn that he was served by this lad .
The resources of this lodging were so limited , that we found the twins , now some eight or nine years old , reposing in a turn-up bedstead in the family sitting-room , where <NAME> had prepared , in a <NAME> jug , what he called ' a Brew ' of the agreeable beverage for which he was famous
'No , no , ' replied <NAME> , 'not so bad as that .
Why it came natural to me to do so , and why <NAME> had a deep concern in everything I told her , I did not know then , though I think I know now .
In the keen evening air , every sharp outline looked a hundred times sharper than ever .
<NAME> , we are pressed. " " One word , " the <NAME> entreated .

The consideration of Mrs <NAME> had clothed Mr Sloppy in a suit of black , on which the tailor had received personal directions from <NAME> to expend the utmost cunning of his art , with a view to the concealment of the cohering and sustaining buttons .
He very seldom spoke to her , and never to me .
So ended my last attempt to make any change in <NAME> .

" Have you seen anything of <NAME> yet ? " " Why , yes , <NAME> , " said <NAME> , " me and <NAME> went off straight to look at the <NAME> Ware'us .
After a time , Mr Carker the <NAME> was heard rustling among his papers , as if he had resolved to bring the interview to a conclusion .
I did not thank him in words for what he had done -- my appreciation of it had risen above all words then -- but I hoped he might not be without some understanding of what I felt so strongly .
And the coach , and the coachman , and the horses , rattled , and jangled , and whipped , and cursed , and swore , and tumbled on together , until they came to <NAME> .
' I heerd it , ' said <NAME> , ' but I don ' t know as I understood it rightly <NAME> , ' account of being no scholar , and the words being -- ask your pardon -- rayther high .

But Mr <NAME> commiserated our reality nevertheless , and agreed that we were very hardly used in that regard .
' It would be far more satisfactory to your kind heart , I know , ' he said , ' to provide for her , but it may be a duty to respect this independent spirit. ' Mrs <NAME> was not proof against the consideration set before her .

' From <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , announcing his errand , when he got upstairs , with all possible brevity .
" <NAME> is so far away , now , " said I , " that I thought the time for such congratulation was past , <NAME> . "
It is doomed to wander through the world -- oh , woe is me ! -- and witness what it can not share , but might have shared on earth , and turned to happiness ! "
' To clap on , is exactly what I could wish to do .
<NAME> <NAME> conducted me through a paved courtyard formed of grave brick houses , which I inferred , from the <NAME> ' names upon the doors , to be the official abiding-places of the learned advocates of whom <NAME> had told me ; and into a large dull room , not unlike a chapel to my thinking , on

Then I thought if she were , as I feared , by no means rapturously grateful for that destiny yet , when would she begin to be interested in me ?

We must have them improved , <NAME> .
But as I have experience of the ready goodwill and good help of those who have given occupation to <NAME> , I think I will seek them out for myself. ' ' On foot ? ' asked <NAME> , with a chop .

Mrs <NAME> has carried the day , and we ' re going in neck and crop for Fashion. ' ' I rather inferred that , sir , ' replied <NAME> , ' from the scale on which your new establishment is to be maintained. ' ' Yes , ' said Mr Boffin , ' it ' s to be

He made me feel more and more resentful , and more and more contemptible , by always presenting to me everything that surrounded me with some new hateful light upon it , while he pretended to exhibit it in its best aspect for my admiration and his own .
' I ask em to my wedding , Toots. ' ' Feeder , ' replied Mr Toots gravely , ' the fact is , that there were several circumstances which prevented me from communicating with you until after my marriage had been solemnised .
Leaving her and <NAME> to compare notes at leisure , <NAME> led the way into another room ; and there , heard from <NAME> a full narration of her interview with <NAME> , which occasioned him no little surprise and perplexity .

It being evening , he found that gentleman , as he expected , seated over his fire ; but did not find him , as he expected , floating his powerful mind in tea .

It was not exactly in a court , and it was not exactly in a yard ; but it was in the dullest of No-Thoroughfares , rendered anxious and haggard by distant double knocks .
One Night Never did the sun go down with a brighter glory on the quiet corner in <NAME> , than one memorable evening when the Doctor and his daughter sat under the plane-tree together .

Half a crown. ' ' Per week , you know. ' ' Per week .

' I am. ' ' Is there anything I can do , Captain <NAME> ? ' inquired Mr Toots .
It is considered that you must be better educated , in accordance with your altered position , and that you will be alive to the importance and necessity of at once entering on that advantage. " I said I had always longed for it .

Whether it was that the pretty housemaid ' s face looked prettier still , when it was raised towards <NAME> ' s , or whether it was the accidental consequence of their being so near to each other , is matter of uncertainty to this day ; but <NAME> kissed her .

It has been upon my mind , night and day , this long time .
" You were born to make your fortune , " said <NAME> , " and you 'll certainly do it . "
If you have indeed a burden on your heart , let me try to lighten it .
Ashes , and dust , and ruin !
Bless you. " In this strain of consolation , <NAME> informed me the invisible <NAME> would commune with himself by the day and night together ; <NAME> , while it was light , having , at the same time , one eye at a telescope which was fitted on his bed for the convenience of sweeping the river .
<NAME> , who in power of taciturnity was excelled by few people , made no attempt to break silence ; and so they went on , until they had very nearly reached <NAME> ' s home , when Mr <NAME> said : ' Were the <NAME> very much overpowered , <NAME> , by that news ? ' ' What
He knocks , receives no answer , opens it , and accidentally extinguishes his candle in doing so .
Towards this place he hurried with his unconscious burden , and rushing into the kitchen , and calling upon the company there assembled to make way for <NAME> ' s sake , deposited it on a chair before the fire .
Finally , everything was done according to rule , and the travellers were at liberty to depart whithersoever they would .
He did not seem at all disappointed ; quite the contrary .
We ' ll be content to let her be ; we ' ll be content to think of her , far off , as if she was underneath another sun and sky ; we ' ll be content to trust her to her husband , -- to her little children , p ' raps , -- and bide the

You hailed me first , along of a certain young lady , as you was chartered by .
<NAME> likewise , my <NAME> , whether it be the happier lot to be a poor relation of the great , or to stand in the wintry slush giving the hack horses to drink out of the shallow tub at the coach-stand , into which thou has so nearly set thy uncertain foot .
In the lull consequent on the departure -- in that first vacuity which ensues on every separation , foreshadowing the great separation that is always overhanging all mankind -- <NAME> stood at his desk , looking dreamily out at a gleam of sun .
'Brittles always was a slow boy , ma'am , ' replied the attendant .
" Now lookee here ! " said the man .
' What place may this be ? ' ' This is a school. ' ' Where young folks learns wot ' s right ? ' said <NAME> , gravely nodding .
' I am sure , ' said Mrs. Nickleby , wiping her eyes , and sobbing bitterly , ' I have lost the best , the most zealous , and most attentive creature that has ever been a companion to me in my life -- putting you , my dear <NAME> , and <NAME> , and your poor papa
' He has got a bad name as an old Jew , and he is paid for the use of it , and I ' ll have my money ' s worth out of him. ' This was <NAME> ' s habitual reflection in the way of business , and it was sharpened just now by the old man
Truly , there she was , immediately in front of us , curtsying , and smiling , and saying with her yesterday 's air of patronage , " The wards in <NAME> !
' As I don ' t rekvire any o ' your conversation just now , mum , vill you have the goodness to re-tire ? ' inquired <NAME> , in a grave and steady voice .
B. mean by <NAME> , but old <NAME> -- <NAME> -- your slave -- <NAME> , <NAME> ' am ?
Let me lean on your arm. ' He added , in a whisper , ' Oh , <NAME> ! ' The agitated female advanced , and offered her arm .
" But when it is ready , it takes place , and grinds to pieces everything before it .
Having much enjoyed these strengthening matters and having held subtle conference with his familiar demon , he confidently instructs <NAME> " just to mention quietly to <NAME> , <NAME> , that whenever he 's ready for me , I 'm ready for him . "
' Not likely that a man like you would .
It is in this way that she converses with her blind playmates , and nothing can more forcibly show the power of mind in forcing matter to its purpose than a meeting between them .
' When she was -- lost , ' said <NAME> , ' I know ' d in my mind , as he would take her to them countries .
' Fair as this summer river , ' cried the other , with enthusiasm , ' and by Jove I glow with admiration of it , and with ardour to run a race in it .
says <NAME> with a slight smile and cautiously shaking his head at the shaded face .
' There he is ! ' cried <NAME> .
It was quite plain that he acted the bully , and his friend the peacemaker , for some particular purpose ; or rather , it would have been to any one but the weak old man ; for they exchanged glances quite openly , both with each other and with the gipsy , who grinned his approval of the
But , an uncle disappointed in the service leaving me his property on condition that I left the <NAME> , I accepted the fortune , and resigned my commission. ' ' Lately , I presume ? ' ' Well , I had had twelve or fifteen years of knocking about first .
' An immense number of years. ' ' So I should have inferred , ' said <NAME> .
To hint to him that this confinement in his eye was disagreeable , or to ask him what he meant , was an act too daring to venture upon ; his severity with his employers and their visitors being terrific , and he never permitting himself to be approached with the slightest liberty .
' I should sleep the better for that , if there was nothing else to be glad of ! ' ' She was quite overcome , I am afraid , ' said <NAME> , with great commiseration .
I dare say you ' d quite enjoy it. ' <NAME> seemed to take this aspersion very much to heart , I thought .
<NAME> of notes between <NAME> and the proprietress of the house -- a drunken face tied up in a black bundle , and flaring out of a heap of rags on the floor of a dog-hutch which is her private apartment -- leads to the establishment of this conclusion .
' As we have been brought under one roof by an accidental combination of circumstances , which oddly extends itself to the new relations before us , I have taken the liberty of saying these few words .
" And pray , " I entreated , " do not allow me to be the cause of any more delay . "
I have been thinking what a charge I am to you. ' ' A precious , sacred charge , dear heart !
' I ' m took aback , my lad , at present , ' said the <NAME> , ' and will only confirm that there ill news .
Indeed , I begin to think we are not much alike in any particular , you and I. " Confused by the emotion of the day , and feeling his being there with this Double of coarse deportment , to be like a dream , <NAME> was at a loss how to answer ; finally , answered not at
Withers , the wan page , slept out of the house immediately under the tiles at a neighbouring milk-shop ; and the wheeled chair , which was the stone of that young Sisyphus , passed the night in a shed belonging to the same dairy , where new-laid eggs were produced by the poultry connected with the establishment ,
B. shortly afterwards proposes Mrs <NAME> .
Mr Merdle ' s default left a <NAME> ' s chair at the table ; but , if he had been there , he would have merely made the difference of <NAME> in it , and consequently he was no loss .
But I do n't know him , and he do n't know me . "
' I am happy in the prospect of your company , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
' And have you grown so fickle that you don ' t like your own taste , <NAME> dear ? ' ' Well , my love , ' he returned , swallowing a bit of the cottage loaf with considerable effort , for it seemed to stick by the way : ' I should have thought it was hardly
I would not have gone back to <NAME> now , I would not have gone back to <NAME> now , for any consideration ; simply , I suppose , because my sense of my own worthless conduct to them was greater than every consideration .
I went to bed , exceedingly weary and heavy ; but , on my lying down , all such sensations vanished , as if by magic , and I was broad awake , with every sense refined .
All that I may tell you , here and now , is , that I pray to you to touch me and to bless me .
' That ' s unfortunate , ' said the dwarf , ' for I came , in fact , to ask you about him .
<NAME> and <NAME> had obtained such possession of his whole nature that it was impossible to place any consideration before him which he did not , with a distorted kind of reason , make a new argument in favour of his doing what he did .
She made the boat fast , and again by main strength took him up , and never laid him down until she laid him down in the house .
' Go on , go on , ' almost shrieked the old gentleman .
This gave my aunt such unspeakable satisfaction , that I believe she took a delight in prowling up and down , with her bonnet insanely perched on the top of her head , at times when Mrs. <NAME> was likely to be in the way .
You no sooner began to devote yourself to the pursuit of wealth than you got Pressure .
' I have been remembering , all this afternoon , that on the very day when my boy entered <NAME> ' s <NAME> , and came home late to dinner , sitting just there where you stand , we talked of storm and shipwreck , and I could hardly turn him from the subject. ' But meeting the eyes
But Mr <NAME> is in another sitiwation .
It ' s clear <NAME> feels that they are all subservient to her father .
Let him alone this time , and what ' ll he do with our property next ?
" I have none to give , " the <NAME> replied .
Nod away at him , if you please , like winking ! " " This is a fine place of my son 's , sir , " cried the old man , while I nodded as hard as I possibly could .
" But , although you are the youngest man that ever lived , " said <NAME> , rather hesitating , " I must still suggest to you -- " " I understand .
He could just see <NAME> upsetting the specials , and flying about in every direction ; and that was all he could see , for the sedan doors wouldn ' t open , and the blinds wouldn ' t pull up .
But he applied that maxim to our marriage , my dear ; and that was so far prematurely entered into , in consequence , that I never recovered the expense. ' <NAME> looked aside at Mrs. Micawber , and added : ' Not that I am sorry for it .
<NAME> shrunk involuntarily from the goblin figure , but she placed the tips of her fingers in his hand and instantly withdrew them .
Being conversational , and in a reasonable flow of spirits , he then invited her attention to his coat as it hung behind the door : remarking that the Father of the place would set an indifferent example to his children , already disposed to be slovenly , if he went among them out at elbows .
Because , if it was so long ago , how could the people about him have made that mistake of putting some of the trouble out of his head , after it was taken off , into mine ? ' I was very much surprised by the inquiry ; but could give no information on this point .
The state of my feelings towards <NAME> is of that unspeakable description , that my heart is a desert island , and she lives in it alone .
I have written , gone there , entreated .
Being informed of our desire , he produced a newspaper wherein the body of elders , whereof he was a member , had advertised but a few days before , that in consequence of certain unseemly interruptions which their worship had received from strangers , their chapel was closed to the public for the space of one year .
Those words being on his lips , it occurred to him -- and it is an instance of the strong attraction with which his hopes and fears and all his thoughts were tending to one centre -- that a great temptation was being placed in this woman ' s way .
" Some other prospect has opened to him , perhaps ? "
In another minute , the carriage was out of sight ; and Mr <NAME> remained alone on the spot where it had lately been , with a vision of Kit standing up in the rumble waving his hand to <NAME> , and of <NAME> in the full light and lustre of his eyes -- his eyes -- <NAME> '
Now I could wish myself , you see , that our little Em ' ly was in a fair way of being married .
It is a very , very little hand ! ' After a sound night ' s rest in a chamber in the thatched roof , in which it seemed the sexton had for some years been a lodger , but which he had lately deserted for a wife and a cottage of his own , the child rose early
( I had come out of <NAME> last on a vagrancy committal .
With the exception of little heaps of rags and bundles which had been carelessly thrown into the corners of the room , these were the only things in the apartment .
' Only <NAME> , father. ' ' Amy , my child , come here .
The spirit of <NAME> so pervaded all we thought , and said , and did , in that time of sorrow , that I assume I may refer the project to her influence .
To remedy this inconvenience , and give us an opportunity of conversing with <NAME> in all his purity , <NAME> directed the door of the cell to be unlocked , and <NAME> to be invited out into the passage .
said the Jew , rubbing the palms of his hands nervously together .
It ' s a gratifying circumstance which you ' ll be glad to hear , that a young and lovely girl is growing into a woman expressly on my account , and is now saving up for me .
At length she suddenly burst into tears , and said : ' He was a fine-looking man when I married him , <NAME> -- and he was sadly changed ! ' It did not last long .
Now I know it wasn ' t ! ' ' Yes , it was .
I opened it and read it .
O Mrs Higden , <NAME> , you was a woman and a mother and a mangler in a million million ! ' With those heartfelt words , <NAME> removed his dejected head from the church door , and took it back to the grave in the corner , and laid it down there , and wept alone .
Besides , you have seen them only once .
Day after day , such travellers crept past , but always , as she thought , in one direction -- always towards the town .
Notwithstanding an unusual flow of company , the master of the wine-shop was not visible .
' This Rokesmith is a needy young man that I take for my Secretary out of the open street .
We agree that you scarcely seem at home here .
' You are very obliging , my dear Copperfield , ' said <NAME> ; and hummed a tune .
They had a she-wolf for a nurse ; I had only a she-wolf for a grandmother .
The preparations were on the most delightful scale ; fully realising the prophetic <NAME> ' s anticipations about the gorgeousness of <NAME> fairyland , and at once affording a sufficient contradiction to the malignant statements of the reptile _Independent_ .
I would have given anything not to have been so much in the bright old lady 's confidence if I could have possibly declined it .
' <NAME> no man has a better right to do than yourself , you know , ' said Mr Inspector .
In short , sir , I can not trust myself , and I implore and beseech you to remove this young lady from under the charge of my mother and sister without delay .
He doesn ' t get too sure , you know. ' She said this with such a mingling of high delight and self-congratulation , that it was inexpressibly painful to <NAME> to dash her hopes ; but he felt that there was only one honourable course before him , and that he was bound to take it .
' You must excuse my talking about this old place , <NAME> , ' resumed the host , after a short pause , ' for I love it dearly , and know no other- -the old houses and fields seem like living friends to me ; and so does our little church with the ivy , about which ,
'No matter who 's got it , or who did it , my dear , ' replied <NAME> , glancing , nevertheless , with a hawk 's eye at the girl and the two bundles .
<NAME> was so sorry to have kept her waiting , and good gracious why did she sit out there in the cold when she had expected to find her by the fire reading the paper , and hadn ' t that heedless girl given her the message then , and had she really been in her bonnet all this
He wished to know whether this disgraceful contest between two members of that club should be allowed to continue .
Such the guests in the long drawing-room at <NAME> this dismal night when the step on the <NAME> 's Walk ( inaudible here , however ) might be the step of a deceased cousin shut out in the cold .
' The doctor , I believe , is a very good shot , ' said <NAME> .
The match flickers for a moment , and shows great mounds of dusty rags upon the ground ; then dies away and leaves a denser darkness than before , if there can be degrees in such extremes .
He had been for many years , a quiet silent man , associating but little with other men , and used to companionship with his own thoughts .
Seeing this , and saying as much in a few words to the slighter and younger of the two ladies , the gentleman put his wife ' s arm over his shoulder , lifted her up , and carried her away .
The tickets we have received on board the steamboat are marked No .
Not the way to get on in life , you 'll tell me ?
' But you have followed the treasure of your heart .
And now , those six days which were to have run out so slowly , had run out fast and were gone , and to-morrow looked me in the face more steadily than I could look at it .
This constant succession of glasses produced considerable effect upon <NAME> ; his countenance beamed with the most sunny smiles , laughter played around his lips , and good-humoured merriment twinkled in his eye .
I have held no confidence with any one , because—you anticipated my reason just now. ' She abruptly broke off .
' " _You _a miserable man ! " said the king of the goblins , in a more contemptuous tone than before .
Then he was gone ; and the door was locked outside ; and I was lying , fevered and hot , and torn , and sore , and raging in my puny way , upon the floor .
Possessed by a kind of desperation , she adds in the next breath , that she will come to <NAME> in the garden .
You never can know what it was to be devoted to you , with those old associations ; to find that anyone could be so hard as to suppose that the truth of my heart was bartered away , and to be surrounded by appearances confirming that belief .
I declare ! ' <NAME> looked up inquiringly .
Have you objected ? ' ' Why should I ask them what they want , dear fellow , when I am indifferent what they want ?
So like him , as I knew him ( when I first spoke <NAME> for him to the host ) in the <NAME> of the <NAME> , in the little street of the high roofs , by the wharf at <NAME> !
The lively notes of the guard ' s key- bugle vibrate in the clear cold air , and wake up the old gentleman inside , who , carefully letting down the window-sash half-way , and standing sentry over the air , takes a short peep out , and then carefully pulling it up again , informs the other inside
I do n't know what he can have done with the money .
It was not in the figures at all , ' said <NAME> , wiping her eyes .
It was the most conveniently organized place in the world .
But be very particular to make it of bread , if you please , ma ' am. ' With which parting injunction , slowly and portentously delivered , the doctor departed , leaving the whole house in admiration of that wisdom which tallied so closely with their own .
' I apprehend it has been going on , ever since a certain person went off .
Later in the day , I returned , and we laid him in his mother ' s room .
she cried after a while , ' I never thought of this . '
" It was done when you were more than ten years old ; you might have seen it. " " Enough ! " said <NAME> , with grim impatience .
So Mrs Boffin and me grow older and older in the old man ' s service , living and working pretty hard in it , till the old man is discovered dead in his bed .
<NAME> <NAME> was uncommonly convivial .
Some intense associations of a most distressing nature were vividly recalled , I think .
I find it was a false alarm about the wind .
She could read after a sort ; and picked out the fat figures in the tickets of prices , for the most part correctly .
I do not mean that it ceased even then , but that my attention was then diverted into a current very memorable to me .
Goodness me , it ' s on , the end of my tongue .
' Now is this D. N. F. ?
He will never prosper in his inheritance otherwise .
She was worse at home than she had been at school .
' <NAME> down , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
The door remaining as it had been left , and the lantern standing in the window , it could only be supposed that he had got out by a trap in the floor which communicated with an empty cart-house below .
It ' s better for my Uncle that I should be sent away ; for Mr Dombey is a valuable friend to him , as he proved himself , you know when , <NAME> ; and I am persuaded he won ' t be less valuable when he hasn ' t me there , every day , to awaken
Shut the door , put out the candle , turn me up in the bedstead !
" It is required of every man , " the <NAME> returned , " that the spirit within him should walk abroad among his fellowmen , and travel far and wide ; and if that spirit goes not forth in life , it is condemned to do so after death .
' Oh dear ! ' said Mrs. Nickleby , ' I never go out at all , never. ' ' And that is the very reason , my dear Mrs. Nickleby , why you should go out tonight , ' retorted <NAME> .
A faint misgiving , which had hung about her since their accession to fortune , that even now she could never see him as he used to be before the prison days , had gradually begun to assume form in her mind .
' Do you know , ' said I , as we walked along the passage , ' what felony was <NAME> ' s last " folly " ? ' The answer was that it was a <NAME> case .
In that case he ' ll have a note or a message for you , but not else .
" Here 's that horrible cat coming in ! "
' I find it bores me. ' ' Is there any news today ? ' inquired the Doctor .
<NAME> <NAME> had ceased to mind what he did .
<NAME> fever , perhaps -- can ' t help that -- if not -- ' Here <NAME> paused , and striking the crown of his hat with great violence , passed his hand over his eyes , and sat down .
While he was collecting a few necessaries and cramming them into his pockets , he never once ceased communing with himself in a low voice , or unclenched his teeth , which he had ground together on finishing <NAME> ' s note .
Let me show you , Dora. ' Then I would commence a practical demonstration , to which <NAME> would pay profound attention , perhaps for five minutes ; when she would begin to be dreadfully tired , and would lighten the subject by curling my hair , or trying the effect of my face with my shirt-collar turned down
Do you see this furniture , <NAME> ?
I don ' t go higher than comfort , and comfort of the sort that I ' m equal to the enjoyment of .
Mrs. Woodcourt never would let me change it .
Undo the hamper , Joe. ' The fat boy , who had been effectually roused by the compression of a portion of his leg between the finger and thumb of <NAME> , rolled off the box once again , and proceeded to unpack the hamper with more expedition than could have been expected from his previous inactivity .
Those who were at too great a distance to know its meaning , took up the sound ; it echoed and re-echoed ; it seemed as though the whole city had poured its population out to curse him .
" It 's always more like a fit than a nap , " says <NAME> , shaking him again .
The old gentleman laid one gun on the ground , and loaded the other .
<NAME> , you are up and away to-morrow .
' <NAME> , dear , would you go into the shop and tidy the window a little bit before tea , your taste being so beautiful ? ' <NAME> trotted away , much gratified , to comply with his daughter ' s request .
' This interest , <NAME> -- so touching an evidence of everything associated with Mr Dombey being dear to you -- induces me to pause before I make him acquainted with these circumstances , which , as yet , he does not know .
" Then she had better go . "
Thus , it happened that <NAME> , who had been upstairs to have some conversation with <NAME> , returning to the drawing-room with her little work-basket , found no one there but her father , who was walking to and fro , in dreary magnificence .
' You ' re not so hurried now , <NAME> , and your hand is cooler. ' ' I get better , dear , if I can only walk , and breathe a little fresh .
My natural grief for my child ' s mother turned to disease ; my natural love for my child turned to disease .
<NAME> broke from her at length , and was going weeping out of the room , when in her own little queer affectionate way , she half relented towards Mr Boffin .
I walked the last mile , thinking as I went along of what I had to do ; and left the carriage that had followed me all through the night , awaiting orders to advance .
I sat between them , at my dear girl 's side , and felt very melancholy listening to her sweet voice .
You supposed he had come home ?
'Ah , bless 'em , that I do , dear as it is , ' replied the nurse .
<NAME> <NAME> was awakened early in the morning , by a hum of voices and a pattering of feet , sufficient to rouse even the fat boy from his heavy slumbers .
I am sorry to hear you putting any such extraordinary questions .
' It was here long afore I was born , or any on us. ' <NAME> glanced triumphantly at his companion .
And if the truth was known , when the <NAME> murder was all over the town , and people were speculating on its being suicide , I dare say those impudent wretches at the clubs and places made jokes about the miserable creature ' s having preferred a watery grave to me .
I shouldn ' t have got round my gentleman fellow-partner without it , I think .
Because her marriage with <NAME> , after what I have heard from her own lips , would be a shocking mockery , of which both she and I must always be conscious , and which would degrade her in her mind , and me in mine , and each of us in the other ' s .
It 's been trouble enough to get ; I thought I should have been here , three hours ago . '
The presumption is , that the gratitude of <NAME> was too powerful for utterance , as he said nothing , but continued to walk on -- rather slowly .
" Now , Mrs. Snagsby , the only amends you can make , " said <NAME> , rapidly glancing at it , " is to let me speak a word to this young lady in private here .
It is of much higher importance than it may seem , that this statue should be repaired at the public cost , as it ought to have been long ago .
<NAME> ' t talk about catching people , miss , till your own time for catching -- as you call it -- comes. ' ' Perhaps it has come , ' muttered <NAME> , with a toss of her head .
Where are grace , beauty , and blandishments , like those ?
I hope he is appreciated THERE. ' So saying <NAME> ' s papa rubbed the tip of his nose with a very yellow silk handkerchief , and gave the company to understand that these recollections overcame him .
As to marriage , and fortune , and all that , I believe I was almost as innocently undesigning then , as when I loved little Em ' ly .
It was the first time that a grave had opened in my road of life , and the gap it made in the smooth ground was wonderful .
" So she had , miss , but she 's come back again to where she used to live -- she and <NAME> .
' Coach taken care on , also ? ' ' Con-signed in a safe quarter , ' replied <NAME> , wringing the heads off half a dozen shrimps , and swallowing them without any more ado .
' Phunky -- <NAME> , ' said the <NAME> , ' I never heard the name before .
The more his case was looked into , the weaker it became in every point .
Mrs. Rouncewell , who holds the light , is giddy with the swiftness of his eyes and hands as he starts up , furnished for his journey .
I would n't for the wealth of all the world have crushed that braided hair , and torn it down ; and for the precious little shoe , I would n't have plucked it off , <NAME> bless my soul !
<NAME> <NAME> withdrew , and returning with his friends , presented them in due form to the editor of the <NAME> .
Make the rain pour down , outside , in torrents .
A parting blessing for our child. " " I send it to her by you .
" What has been the matter ? "
<NAME> , the only person up in the house , is just going to bed , rises from his book on hearing the rapid ringing at the bell , and comes down to the door in his dressing-gown .
' Why <NAME> ? ' said <NAME> .
Oh , I am frightened again .
He washed himself , and rubbed his clothes ; there were spots that would not be removed , but he cut the pieces out , and burnt them .
Mrs. Maylie took up her abode with her son and daughter-in-law , to enjoy , during the tranquil remainder of her days , the greatest felicity that age and worth can know -- the contemplation of the happiness of those on whom the warmest affections and tenderest cares of a well-spent life , have been unceasingly bestowed .
I was perfectly frantic , -- a reckless witness under the torture , -- and would have told them anything .
' <NAME> , ' I said in a thoughtful whisper , one evening , when I was warming my hands at the kitchen fire , ' Mr .
All her old sorrows had come back upon her , augmented by new fears and doubts ; by day they were ever present to her mind ; by night they hovered round her pillow , and haunted her in dreams .
The old way ! ' ' It may be , with others , ' I returned , ' but I do assure you it is not with me .
You had better not be in the way , for strangers are going to call upon you .
I do n't know , ' said <NAME> ; ' I rather think I had a damp napkin at dinner-time yesterday ; but never mind that .
' He is rich , and not so easily punished as <NAME> old enemy , <NAME> .
' I recognise it , but it is far from flattering the original. ' ' O , you are hard upon it !
I <NAME> ' T say that I ' m in any hurry for ' em. ' ' You must be wandering in your mind , partner , ' <NAME> remonstrated .
So numerous and severe were the mental trials of that unfortunate youth in vacation time , that the friends of the family ( then resident near <NAME> , <NAME> ) seldom approached the ornamental piece of water in <NAME> , without a vague expectation of seeing <NAME> ' s hat floating on the surface , and an unfinished exercise
But his archness suddenly flying before the composed face and manner of his visitor , and only the fire remaining , he started and rubbed himself .
' Holloa ! ' said the man roughly .
You haven ' t got such a thing as twopence , Mr Nickleby , have you ? ' said <NAME> , rattling a bunch of keys in his coat pocket , and muttering something about its being all silver .
It takes him a long time to say this , and few but an experienced and attentive listener could hear , or , hearing , understand him .
' He has fell into bad company , you see , genelmen , ' pursued the father , looking wistfully at both , and evidently taking the Major into the conversation with the hope of having his sympathy .
' Oh , devil take the laburnum-tree , ma ' am ! ' said <NAME> , quite forgetting his professional dignity in his anxiety .
Not always the same thing , by the <NAME> !
In his light protestations of admiration of my future husband , in his enthusiasm regarding our engagement and our prospects , in his hopeful congratulations on our future wealth and his despondent references to his own poverty -- all equally hollow , and jesting , and full of mockery -- I saw it clearly .
She opened a drawer or two , looked over some business papers , and put them back again .
'This is the woman , is it ? '
In that state of mind which rendered nobody uneasy , his thoughtfulness would have turned principally on the man at his side .
<NAME> 's father would believe I had deserted him , would be taken , would die accusing me ; even <NAME> would doubt me , when he compared the letter I had left for him with the fact that I had called at <NAME> 's gate for only a moment ; <NAME> and <NAME> would never know how sorry
" If <NAME> picked a peck of pickled pepper , where ' s the peck , " & c. ? ' Though he said this gaily , he said it with a perplexed and inquisitive face , as if he actually did not know what to make of himself .
I ask your pardon for troubling you , sir .
There 's a cruel attraction in the place .
We all confirmed it from our night 's experience .
' My Uncle ' s wife , ' Mrs <NAME> went on to say , ' died just like his Mama .
' I have settled nothing at all yet , but my guardian will take care of me .
A room not large enough to skate in ; nor adapted to the easy pursuit of any other occupation .

Among them I remember a double set of pigs ' trotters , a huge pin-cushion , half a bushel or so of apples , a pair of jet earrings , some <NAME> onions , a box of dominoes , a canary bird and cage , and a leg of pickled pork .
I can ' t get to sleep very early at night , and I generally wake rather early in the morning .
There ' ll be no judge at chambers till four o ' clock this afternoon .
<NAME> , with much bowing and short apologetic coughing , takes his leave , lightened in heart .
I have one already. ' ' Then , <NAME> ' r , ' said the <NAME> , suddenly diving into one of his pockets and bringing up the two teaspoons and the sugar-tongs , with which he had armed himself to meet such an objection , ' take this here trifle of plate , instead. ' ' No ,
<NAME> <NAME> refers to me in public as a promising young scholar .
I was fond of wandering about the <NAME> , because it was a mysterious place , with those dark arches .
For as she sat looking down , she held a corner of her under lip within her mouth , her bosom heaved , her nostril quivered , her head trembled , indignant tears were on her cheek , and her foot was set upon the moss as though she would have crushed it into nothing .
A little overworked , I am afraid ? ' ' Yes , I am overworked just at present , sir. ' ' Had no play in your last holiday time ? ' ' No , sir. ' ' All work and no play , Mr Headstone , will not make dulness , in your case , I dare say
" My dear good friend , " returned <NAME> , " and my dear <NAME> , and my dear <NAME> , how can I do that ?
Do you know anything of it , <NAME> ? ' ' I only know this much , ' said <NAME> , ' that he has given the <NAME> with which I have the honour to be associated ; ' this sparkling young <NAME> threw off the phrase sportively , as who should say , We know all about these
Now look this lady in the face .
<NAME> comes here to ask if a man ' s at home , and to say he ' ll stand on the door mat till he is .
I am going to tell you , " replied <NAME> , crossing her hands confidentially upon my arm .
Such a downy tip was on his callow chin , that he seemed half fledged like a young bird ; and a compassionate observer might have urged that , if he had not singed the calves of his legs , he would have died of cold .
We discovered this morning that our friend was connected with the theatre in this place , though he is not desirous to have it generally known , and this gentleman is a member of the same profession .
'You 're a falsehood , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
Had you ever any reason to suppose or believe that he was about to be married ? ' ' Oh , no ; certainly not ; ' replied <NAME> with so much eagerness , that <NAME> ought to have got him out of the box with all possible dispatch .
From any point of the high ridge of land northward , it might have been discerned that the loftiest buildings made an occasional struggle to get their heads above the foggy sea , and especially that the great dome of <NAME> ' s seemed to die hard ; but this was not perceivable in the streets at their feet
She gratefully thanked him but remained inexorable .
said <NAME> , leading me to a chair and seating himself beside me .
Hemmed in here by the massive thickness of walls and arches , the storm within the fortress and without was only audible to them in a dull , subdued way , as if the noise out of which they had come had almost destroyed their sense of hearing .
' ' Tis better , onnyways. ' ' Thou ' lt write to me , and tell me all that happens , <NAME> ? ' ' Yes .
' Impossible ! ' ' He did , though , ' said <NAME> , shaking his head .
He is otherwise disposed of. ' ' Will she be left alone then ? ' asked <NAME> .
As he went up the stairs , people were already posted on the lower stairs , that his shadow might fall upon them when he came down .
" The fog is very dense indeed ! "
<NAME> ? ' In this guileless and most kind simplicity , brother <NAME> was so happy , and in this possibility of the young lady being led to think that she was under no obligation to him , he evidently felt so sanguine and had so much delight , that <NAME> would not breathe a doubt upon the subject
When I got better , I went to look at the monster .
A miserable blank remained in the house and in the hearts of the father and mother and <NAME> .
' Not here , I should imagine , ' said Mr Dombey .
But let me speak to you. ' The vehement manner of the entreaty , the earnest expression of the face , the trembling of the two hands that were raised imploringly , a certain dread and terror in the voice akin to her own condition at the moment , prevailed with <NAME> .
It lives in my memory , with the fascination of a remarkable picture .
Please to leave me , Sir. ' ' I knew that your regard for the young lady , which is very sincere and strong , I am well persuaded , would render it a great unhappiness to you , ever to be a prey to the reflection that you had injured her position and ruined her future hopes ,
They showed the visitor to be an ill-looking visitor with a squinting leer , who , as he spoke , fumbled at an old sodden fur cap , formless and mangey , that looked like a furry animal , dog or cat , puppy or kitten , drowned and decaying .
By-the-bye , that lodger of yours is a most extraordinary person .
On one of these tables , the eight volumes were ranged flat , in a row , like a galvanic battery ; on the other , certain squat case-bottles of inviting appearance seemed to stand on tiptoe to exchange glances with Mr Wegg over a front row of tumblers and a basin of white sugar .
' You have almost reason to be , <NAME> , ' he replied , glancing at a variety of landscape drawings , of which he had already recognised several as representing neighbouring points of view , and which were strewn abundantly about the room , ' if these beautiful productions are from your hand. ' She gave him no
" Like as <NAME> might have been , miss , if <NAME> and me had died after father , " said <NAME> , her round eyes filling with tears .
<NAME> bent his head , as much as to say , ' Indeed , sir ?
There ' s a son gone : pretty little creetur .
You be thankful that your name ain ' t Ned. ' He looks at her quite steadily , as he asks : ' Why ? ' ' Because it ' s a bad name to have just now. ' ' How a bad name ? ' ' A threatened name .
' We are not likely to remain alone much longer , ' said <NAME> , ' and while I have an opportunity , let me earnestly entreat you , <NAME> , to be friendly to <NAME> .
'No more it is , ' replied the <NAME> ; 'Charley will talk .
At all events , it might have been borne by <NAME> .
They may not be worth much , but , after all , they 're property and portable .
' A blow , <NAME> ? ' stammered <NAME> .
He therefore commenced proceedings by putting his arm over the half-door of the bar , coolly unbolting it , and leisurely walking in .
It is an excellent house , and the proprietors have most bountiful notions of providing the creature comforts .
Then , sometimes , when her thoughts reverted swiftly to the void between herself and her father , <NAME> would tremble , and the tears would start upon her face , as she pictured to herself her mother living on , and coming also to dislike her , because of her wanting the unknown grace that should conciliate that
As the child of the -- by-the-bye , how did you get out so early ? ' ' We were shut out last night , and are waiting to get in. ' ' You don ' t mean it ?
' You ' d have been a deuced deal more wakeful in the cold , I ' ll engage. ' By this time <NAME> had dismounted ; and after ordering the boy to see to the pony , and to take care that he hadn ' t any more corn that night , he told <NAME> to wait at
It ' s the door straight afore you , when you gets to the top of the stairs. ' Having given this instruction , the handmaid , who had been brought up among the aboriginal inhabitants of <NAME> , disappeared , with the candle in her hand , down the kitchen stairs , perfectly satisfied that she had done
'What more of the man she had told them of before ?
The old housekeeper , with a gracious severity of deportment , waves her hand towards the great staircase .
on a day like this. ' Lavvy , sitting with defiantly folded arms , replied ( but not audibly ) , ' For goodness ' sake say whichever of the two you like best , <NAME> , and get it over. ' ' The mind , ' pursued <NAME> in an oratorical manner , ' naturally reverts to <NAME>
The stranger , with a comfortable kind of grunt over his pipe , put his legs up on the settle that he had to himself .
I don ' t know whether any of you , gentlemen , ever partook of a real substantial hospitable <NAME> breakfast , and then went out to a slight lunch of a bushel of oysters , a dozen or so of bottled ale , and a noggin or two of whiskey to close up with .
There ' s the chance of -- no , there ' s no chance of that , but it ' s as well to be on the safe side. ' This undeveloped was the possibility , which <NAME> sought to conceal even from himself , of his not being proof against the charms of <NAME> , and in some
All this Mr <NAME> did with the air of a man who had made up his mind for the worst and was quite resigned ; his eye slowly wandering about during the briskest repartee to observe the effect upon the audience , and particularly the impression made upon the landlord and landlady , which might be productive of very
Let the <NAME> come here after the performanth , or come here yourthelf after the performanth , and you thall find your brother , and have the whole plathe to talk to him in .
They were walking slowly towards the east , already looking for the first pale streak of day , when a woman came after them .
Now , come , you 're what I call an intellectual woman -- with your soul too large for your body , if you come to that , and chafing it -- and you know me , and you recollect where you saw me last , and what was talked of in that circle .
Her look was very intent .
Never will. ' ' Mr Casby could enlighten her , perhaps ? ' ' May be , ' said <NAME> .
From a long habit of listening admiringly to everything that was said in her presence , and looking at the speakers as if she were mentally engaged in taking off impressions of their images upon her soul , never to part with the same but with life , her head had quite settled on one side .
' As to alteration in her , <NAME> , ' mused the Major on his way back ; on which expedition -- the afternoon being sunny and hot -- he ordered the <NAME> and the light baggage to the front , and walked in the shadow of that expatriated prince : ' as to alteration , <NAME> , and
' It had been arranged previously to the convict ' s departure , that he should write to his mother as soon as he could obtain permission , and that the letter should be addressed to me .
' Observe the dyer ' s hand , assimilating itself to what it works in , -- or would work in , if anybody would give it anything to do .
In the midst of which dust and noise there is but one thing perfectly clear , to wit , that <NAME> only may and can , or shall and will , be reclaimed according to somebody 's theory but nobody 's practice .
You are hedged round and round .
Being undecided whether six three-fourths meant six pounds fifteen , or sixpence three farthings , or six foot three , or three quarters past six , or six somethings that he hadn ' t learnt yet , with three unknown something elses over , <NAME> rubbed his hands and looked straight at <NAME> .
A slight figure , ' said <NAME> , looking at the fire , ' kiender worn ; soft , sorrowful , blue eyes ; a delicate face ; a pritty head , leaning a little down ; a quiet voice and way -- timid a ' most .
' If so , mention it , <NAME> Eight. ' ' Sir , ' said <NAME> , without looking up , ' if my eyes have not deceived me , there is a gentleman present who was acquainted with me in my former life .
In a few days , an election is to take place for the borough of <NAME> , at which <NAME> , a gentleman whom I lately met , is the agent of one of the candidates .
For <NAME> , who had never been wont to do too much at home as <NAME> , was under the constant necessity of referring for advice and support to a sage volume entitled The <NAME> , which she would sit consulting , with her elbows on the table and her temples on her hands , like some perplexed enchantress
So , another time—taking me as representing your opponent in other cases—you set up a platform credulity ; a moved and seconded and carried-unanimously profession of faith in some ridiculous delusion or mischievous imposition .
He said he would even have spent as much , to baulk or injure Copperfield. ' ' Ha ! ' said my aunt , knitting her brows thoughtfully , and glancing at <NAME> .
' These are the orders , are they ? ' ' Since you insist upon the term , sir , yes , ' replied <NAME> .
Oh , my dear , it might have been a better fortune for you , if you had been fond of someone else -- of someone steadier and much worthier than me , who was all bound up in you , and never vain and changeable like me ! ' ' Poor little tender-heart , ' said <NAME> ,
Becoming a sadder and a wiser man , he mused and held his peace .
<NAME> <NAME> has become your bosom friend .
" IS it possible , guardian , " I asked , amazed , " that <NAME> can be suspicious of you ? "
I 'll beat the shivers so far , I 'll bet you. " He was gobbling mincemeat , meatbone , bread , cheese , and pork pie , all at once : staring distrustfully while he did so at the mist all round us , and often stopping -- even stopping his jaws -- to listen .
He had already locked up his safe , and made preparations for going home .
<NAME> ! ' holding up the light at arm ' s length .
So completely was he absorbed in his fixed idea that he used to avow in his cheerful moments that he should never have breathed the fresh air now " but for <NAME> . "
Glancing towards Mr and <NAME> , she very slightly raised her eyebrows , as though inquiring of her husband : ' Do I notice anything wrong here ? ' Mr Lammle , who had found his chest effective on a variety of occasions , manoeuvred his capacious shirt front into the largest demonstration possible , and then smiling retorted
' <NAME> ' s not used to an audience ; that ' s the fact , ' said <NAME> .
Not exactly seeing his way to the end of these demonstrations , and sensible that they placed the pantaloons constructed by the art of <NAME> and Co. in jeopardy , Mr Toots , with chuckles , lapsed out at the door : by which , after looking in again two or three times , without any object at all
From this she took the key , and put it on the outer side .
' Yes , Mr Blandois , ' he replied tartly .
<NAME> <NAME> ' s ' outer door ' was closed ; and the dead silence which followed <NAME> ' s repeated kicks thereat , announced that the officials had retired from business for the night .
The bottom of the oldest grave about him was not more still and quiet than the churchyard in the pale moonlight .
When you go to <NAME> , do as <NAME> does .
There I resolved to await the time of your establishment at home here , and to do as I have now done .
But <NAME> and Mrs. Micawber were so used to their old difficulties , I think , that they felt quite shipwrecked when they came to consider that they were released from them .
She stood looking intently at him , and <NAME> stood coldly by , with her eyes upon the ground , while he proceeded thus : ' Jupe , I have made up my mind to take you into my house ; and , when you are not in attendance at the school , to employ you about Mrs. Gradgrind
In his pride -- for he was proud yet -- he let the world go from him freely .
This seemed to make some impression upon the savage ; for , after a little more ferocity and chasing of the maiden into corners , he began to relent , and stroked his face several times with his right thumb and four fingers , thereby intimating that he was struck with admiration of the maiden ' s beauty .
I could , and I would , think better of him then than at any other time ! "
The first act of business <NAME> performed when the day of the solemnity was over , and light was freely admitted into the house , was to give <NAME> a month ' s warning .
Taken in and done for .
" <NAME> me in my ear , " said <NAME> , bending down .
I can go away , now , happy. ' ' And when we come back , <NAME> , we will come and see his grave again. ' Florence lifts her eyes , so bright with tears , to his kind face ; and clasps her disengaged hand on that other modest little hand which clasps his arm .
Though you see me so confounded -- though you strike me so helpless -- I ask you to believe that there are many people who think well of me ; that there are some people who highly esteem me ; that I have in my way won a Station which is considered worth winning. ' ' Surely , Mr
It was a hot summer Sunday evening .
I hope you will employ me , sir .
I have no excuse but that ; and as I can not fly from this temptation , and can not repress this passion , with its object constantly before me , what can I do but pray and beseech you to remove it , and to leave me to forget her ? ' ' Mr .
As we passed along the familiar street at night -- <NAME> , in despite of all my remonstrances , carrying my bag -- I glanced into <NAME> and <NAME> ' s shop , and saw my old friend <NAME> there , smoking his pipe .
" Excuse the apparent curiosity , " says <NAME> .
That ai n't the way to get out of being common , old chap .
That ' s pretty well , sir , at my age ! ' said the chatty old woman , her eye brightening with exultation .
' I knew we might ! ' ' I should be a worse man than , -- than I hope I am , or would willingly believe myself , if I could not give you that assurance from my heart and soul .
<NAME> is a tough subject , and when he says he ' ll do a thing , he ' ll do it. ' ' Exactly so , ' cried <NAME> , ' and when he says to you he ' ll wait , he ' ll wait. ' [ ' She is a devilish clever woman , ' thought
" On the top of the gallows is fixed the knife , blade upwards , with its point in the air .
It was dense enough to shut out everything from the light of the coach-lamps but these its own workings , and a few yards of road ; and the reek of the labouring horses steamed into it , as if they had made it all .
' Yes it is , ' said <NAME> .
Here , when we go in , is a crowd of them , running down to the door , and handing Traddles about to be kissed , until he is out of breath .
And I may feel well assured that your daughter <NAME> , ' again turning to her husband , ' does not exalt her family by becoming a <NAME> ' s bride .
As often as <NAME> went away in the course of that forenoon , I mingled my tears with the water in which I was washing the bottles ; and sobbed as if there were a flaw in my own breast , and it were in danger of bursting .
He declined any renewal of the conversation , however , for that night : suddenly remembering that it was past one o'clock .
When you wouldn ' t believe the noises. ' After this explosion <NAME> put her apron into her mouth again ; always keeping her hand on the window-sill and her knee on the window-seat , ready to cry out or jump out if her lord and master approached .
' She had been summat timorous and down , ' said <NAME> , ' and had sat , at first , a little way off , at her spinning , or such work as it was , when <NAME> ' ly talked to the children .
Not here since this night week ! ' said the old woman , contemplating him with a look of reproach .
A little way within the shop-door lay heaps of old crackled parchment scrolls and discoloured and dog's-eared law-papers .
' Will you read the note ? ' ' It ' s very short , ' said <NAME> , with a look of wonder , when she had read it .
What did you think me after " at first " ?
You received a communication from her , when you had lived apart a year or two , that the boy was dead ; and you believed it ? ' ' Of course I did ! ' returned <NAME> .
" For myself , my children , " said <NAME> , " I am falling into the sear and yellow leaf , and it is impossible to say how long the last feeble traces of gentlemanly deportment may linger in this weaving and spinning age .
The steams of beer and spirits perpetually ascend to the ceiling , and , being condensed by the heat , roll down the walls like rain ; there are more old suits of clothes in it at one time , than will be offered for sale in all Houndsditch in a twelvemonth ; more unwashed skins and grizzly beards
His coarse shirt and his coarse neckcloth have no more individuality than his coat and hat ; they have the same character of not being his -- of not being anybody ' s .
" About that time , I should say , " observes a dark young man on the other side of the bed .
Once , I kiss <NAME> in the cloak-room .
' Very agreeable servants , sir. ' ' I should think they wos , ' replied <NAME> .
As he said nothing further , and declined taking the hint , Mr <NAME> was fain to propose that they should go up stairs together , and make a last effort to awaken the sleeper by some less violent means , which , if they failed on this last trial , must positively be succeeded by stronger measures .
' Never mind , ' said the one-eyed man , calling after the girl as she left the room .
He would have done so , long ago , if he had dared. ' ' Bah !
' Who had bade them to do so ? ' she asked .
Anticipating the doctor ' s want of this or that , she quietly has it ready for him , and so by degrees is intrusted with the charge of supporting her father ' s head upon her arm .
<NAME> <NAME> takes his dismissal in great dudgeon , the greater because a clerk coming up the stairs has heard the last words of all and evidently applies them to him .
She drew near and asked one of them whose grave it was .
So strange to turn from the chimneys to the birds .
I happened to stroll into the little church when a marriage was just concluded , and the young couple had to sign the register .
That was all she told me of herself .
' Stop , stop , stop ! ' said brother <NAME> , taking the other aside .
And it ' s not good for me , on account of my back being so bad and my legs so queer. ' They looked at the little creature with a wonder that did not diminish , and the schoolmaster said : ' I am sorry your fine ladies are so inconsiderate. ' ' It ' s the way
Whether it was the sense of freedom and independence which a rational animal may be supposed to feel when he sits on a table in an easy attitude smoking a pipe , swinging one leg carelessly to and fro , and having his boots cleaned all the time , without even the past trouble of having taken them off
' Shall we go ? ' ' <NAME> here , let us stay .
Put some punch to it and smooth it again. " With a deprecatory grunt , the jackal again complied .
' You can not be suspected , <NAME> ? ' ' Dear love , I can be -- for I am ! ' There was silence between them , as she sat looking in his face , with the colour quite gone from her own face and lips .
He likewise , in his thoughtfulness , took down a certain little miniature of Walter as a schoolboy , from its accustomed nail , lest it should shock the old man on his return .
<NAME> , starting at unwonted footsteps , creaked and shook .
' My dear brother Ned , ' continued <NAME> , ' was to have married her sister , but she died .
Had the birds , carrying some grains of it to a distance , dropped one over him as they sow chance seeds ?
That ' s reasonable enough under existing circumstances .
and give me hold of the sculls .
He studies her at his leisure , not speaking for a time .
It is blind devotion , unquestioning self-humiliation , utter submission , trust and belief against yourself and against the whole world , giving up your whole heart and soul to the smiter -- as I did ! " When she came to that , and to a wild cry that followed that , I caught her round the waist
' Such high company ! ' It was at this time that Mr <NAME> , in discharge of his compact with <NAME> , revealed to him the whole of his gipsy story , and told him Little Dorrit ' s fortune .
Quite. ' On they drove , and Mrs. <NAME> fell asleep .
As all this was said with much gravity , and as <NAME> walked home with <NAME> , and struggled for a kiss at parting , he went to bed a happy man , and dreamed all night long , of softening old Lobbs , opening the strong box , and marrying <NAME> .
It has always large dull metal buttons , similar to no other buttons .
So said the blue-faced Major , whose eyes were starting out of his head : who gloried in <NAME> ' s Place : and who delighted to turn the conversation at his club , whenever he could , to something connected with some of the great people in the great street round the corner , that he might have
ho ! " ' As the goblin laughed , the sexton observed , for one instant , a brilliant illumination within the windows of the church , as if the whole building were lighted up ; it disappeared , the organ pealed forth a lively air , and whole troops of goblins , the very counterpart of the first
In a few minutes he contrived to feel the motions of my fingers with one hand , and holding out the other he tried to imitate them , laughing most heartily when he succeeded .
Before him was an untasted breakfast , and near to where his fingers beat restlessly upon the table , lay his watch .
' D-r-double o-d. ' ' Does he—or did he—read with you , sir ? ' ' Never , <NAME> .
Whenever he looked at us , we all expressed the greatest interest and amazement , and nodded until he resumed again .
Here , the <NAME> await the happy party ; Mr Podsnap , with his hair-brushes made the most of ; that imperial rocking-horse , <NAME> , majestically skittish .
" <NAME> , brother ! " cried <NAME> , bursting into tears .
To reach this place , the visitor has to penetrate through a maze of close , narrow , and muddy streets , thronged by the roughest and poorest of waterside people , and devoted to the traffic they may be supposed to occasion .
It was the gesture of an instant , but as she did so and accompanied the action with a menacing look , she met his eye in the glass , catching her in the very act .
And as <NAME> moved on from group to group , all three went quicker and fiercer among every little knot of women that she had spoken with , and left behind .
In the afternoon we shot down some rapids where the river boiled and bubbled strangely , and where the force and headlong violence of the current were tremendous .
" I do n't care about fortune : she is a charming creature , and I have made up my mind to please myself : on the whole , I think I can afford to please myself .
Your agents had no clue to your residence .
She regards a ghost as one of the privileges of the upper classes , a genteel distinction to which the common people have no claim .
Not content with these precautions , <NAME> had himself composed and posted there , on painted boards to which his name was attached in large letters , the following solemn warnings : " Beware of the bull-dog .
a chit , a child , an upstart nobody !
They were dressed to correspond , though in a most untidy and negligent way .
" Now are you content ? " <NAME> Pross only shook her head and wept in silence .
He 'd never have no good of it ; he 'd want all along to be out of the line , if he , could see his way out , being once in -- even if it wos so. " " Ugh ! " cried <NAME> , rather relenting , nevertheless , " I am shocked at the sight
All he asked of society was to let him live .
' I don ' t know what ' s the matter .
She is somebody ' s child -- anybody ' s , nobody ' s .
<NAME> help him sometimes with your companionship if you can .
His candle , not a long one when he first received it , had flickered away in the drafts of air through which he had passed and sank into the socket as he closed the door after him .
<NAME> <NAME> closed the door , and stood before the fire ; projecting himself after his old explosive manner into his portrait—and into futurity .
<NAME> , however , so far from being overthrown by the discovery , became a greater favourite than ever .
He held her in his arm , and , after a pause , bent down his ear to listen .
And she did go ; the doctor with great attention sending in half a dozen of medicine , to be drunk upon the road .
" And has left me , " answered the nephew , " bound to a system that is frightful to me , responsible for it , but powerless in it ; seeking to execute the last request of my dear mother 's lips , and obey the last look of my dear mother 's eyes , which implored me
To which the brown hat again makes answer , ' Yes , sir. ' STRAW HAT .
I have never know ' d her to be lone and lorn , for a single minute , not even when the colony was all afore us , and we was new to it .
<NAME> <NAME> immediately interposed , and said that he had had the honour of meeting <NAME> ' s father at a public dinner , and that he hoped he was very well .
The possibility of what is called spontaneous combustion has been denied since the death of <NAME> ; and my good friend <NAME> ( quite mistaken , as he soon found , in supposing the thing to have been abandoned by all authorities ) published some ingenious letters to me at the time when that event was chronicled , arguing
" Old <NAME> 's wife , <NAME> ? "
' <NAME> , <NAME> , ' said the Major , tapping the last ideal portrait , and rolling his head emphatically , ' was <NAME> of <NAME> ; a de-vilish handsome fellow , <NAME> , of forty-one .
This commonly ensued upon the recognition of some spot or object very tenderly associated with him ; and it made the miserable house , at first , a place of agony .
But that poor dream , as I once used to call it , has all gone by , <NAME> , -- all gone by ! " Nevertheless , I knew , while I said those words , that I secretly intended to revisit the site of the old house that evening , alone , for her sake .
<NAME> hoped he might venture to congratulate one of <NAME> ' s world-famed capitalists and merchant-princes ( he had turned that original sentiment in the house a few times , and it came easy to him ) on a new achievement .
The bread she puts on in an iron basket , and the butter ( and not much of it ) in a small pewter plate .
' I feel it , I assure you. ' ' Yes , that ' s well , ' replied <NAME> , who , in the midst of all his comforting , was quite as much taken aback as honest old <NAME> ; ' that ' s well .

'Not at all , ' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat .
Where ! ' exclaimed Mrs. Leo Hunter , starting up , in an affected rapture of surprise .
The windows of the rooms on that side , lately occupied by <NAME> , were dark and still , and there was no lounger in <NAME> Court .
There , a great table in a great room was soon profusely covered with a superb repast ; and the quarantine quarters became bare indeed , remembered among dainty dishes , southern fruits , cooled wines , flowers from <NAME> , snow from the mountain tops , and all the colours of the rainbow flashing in the mirrors .
' Shall I read the passage to you ? ' inquired Mr Toots .
I am not clever out of my own line—now I come to think of it , I don ' t know that I am particularly clever in it—but I want to do right .
Will you shake hands ? ' ' Shake honds ! ' cried the good-humoured <NAME> ; ' ah !
I returned home , loving you ! ' And now , I tried to tell her of the struggle I had had , and the conclusion I had come to .
<NAME> <NAME> proceeded to tell us that as the road to <NAME> would have been very long , dark , and tedious on such an evening , and as we had been travelling already , <NAME> had himself proposed this arrangement .
You must take the books down , I suppose , <NAME> , one by one , and perfect yourself in the day ' s instalment of subject A , before you turn at all to subject B. I am sorry to say , <NAME> , that your education appears to have been very much neglected. ' ' So <NAME>
Even then he could not see his face , for he had drawn the sheet over it .
However , as there was no bagman to look on , nobody knew anything at all about the matter ; and so <NAME> and his clay-coloured gig with the red wheels , and the vixenish mare with the fast pace , went on together , keeping the secret among them , and nobody was a bit the wiser .
In particular , it was clear to me , that she thought Shakespeare a terrible fellow .
' I -- think I have , ' said <NAME> , very slowly , and producing , after much rummaging in an old drawer , a penny , a halfpenny , and two farthings .
<NAME> , poor thing ! ' And now with gathering and darkening emotion , she looked as she had looked when <NAME> entered .

" In this paper , " which was nicely folded , " is a piece of the best plum-cake that can be got for money -- sugar on the outside an inch thick , like fat on mutton chops .
' Riding today , <NAME> ? ' said my aunt , putting her head in at the door .
<NAME> <NAME> , who was not much affected by a bright morning save in so far as it spared him the trouble of carrying an umbrella , caused himself to be put ashore hard by the wharf , and proceeded thither through a narrow lane which , partaking of the amphibious character of its frequenters , had as much
After tea we had quite a little concert , in which <NAME> -- who was enthralled by <NAME> 's singing and told me that she seemed to know all the songs that ever were written -- and <NAME> , and I were the audience .
I ' ll exert my authority. ' ' Well , ' said <NAME> , ' we shall see. ' ' We shall see , my friend , ' replied <NAME> fiercely .
' And such a man to speak , ' said <NAME> .
They had shrunk past homeless people , lying coiled up in nooks .
Let the girl understand the fact .
' Time -- for what ? ' said the spinster aunt coquettishly .

' I went to see this place one very fine winter morning : an <NAME> sky above , and the air so clear
" No , you do n't ; you mean fifty , " says <NAME> humorously .
' I think <NAME> ' s feeling very womanly and pretty. ' ' Now , give us your opinion , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
' Oh , <NAME> ! ' remonstrated my mother .
' <NAME> rejoiced I am ! ' ' Thank you , my dear Copperfield , ' said <NAME> , as we shook hands once more .
Not knowing what to say , I sat down again .
<NAME> <NAME> , still having his professional hold of <NAME> and appearing to <NAME> to possess an unlimited number of eyes , makes a little way into this room , when <NAME> starts and stops .
There being two gentlemen in that position ( <NAME> having arrived with two cabs ) , each gentleman on being paid held forth his two-and-sixpence on the flat of his open hand , and , with a speechless stare and a dropped jaw , displayed his wrong to heaven and earth .
' But apart from my history here -- ' ' His history here ! ' exclaimed the Manager .
Mrs. <NAME> then changed the subject and began to flatter me .
<NAME> <NAME> , dismissing his sudden anger , checks him .

He ' ll be deaf directly. ' ) At another time he asked him , ' Do you walk much , <NAME> , about the yard within the walls of that place of yours ? ' ' No , sir ; no .
There is an allusion to <NAME> -- to my extremely dear child , ' said <NAME> , tracing the outline of her eyebrows with her forefinger , ' in your words , to which the tenderest of chords vibrates excessively. ' ' Bluntness , <NAME> ' am , ' returned the Major , ' has ever been the characteristic
This was in a whisper .
One other thing I felt it needful to touch upon before he left me .

But he put it between his lips again , as he answered with coolness : ' I sell anything that commands a price .
<NAME> knots of seaweed hung upon the jagged and pointed stones , trembling in every breath of wind ; and the green ivy clung mournfully round the dark and ruined battlements .
I think that , henceforth , nothing but some extraordinary jarring of that chord could renew it .
This narrow thoroughfare , baking and blistering in the sun , is <NAME> : the <NAME> and <NAME> of <NAME> .
From personal intercourse with accomplished gentlemen connected with publications of this class , I have derived both pleasure and profit .
The <NAME> was over , the letter was public , the <NAME> was broken , the other model structures of straw had taken fire and were turned to smoke .
<NAME> believed them , because little <NAME> -- I am tempted into the paraphrase by remembering the charming wolf who would have rendered society a great service if he had devoured Mr Riderhood ' s father and mother in their infancy -- had previously played fast and loose with the said charges , and , in fact , abandoned
The old gentleman nodded ; and two ragged boys who had been marshalled to the spot under the direction of the infant <NAME> , forthwith commenced climbing up two of the trees .
Then all of a soodden , he sings oot for a loight , and when it cooms -- ecod , such a hoorly-boorly !
Thither he went at his grave and measured pace , staff in hand , skirt at heel ; and more than one head , turning to look back at his venerable figure already lost in the mist , supposed it to be some ordinary figure indistinctly seen , which fancy and the fog had worked into that passing likeness
You say you have seen her at your mother ' s ( I know your mother befriends her ) , you have felt an interest in her , and you wish to know what she does here .
Pleasant answered with a short dumb nod .
' It is apparent to me that I am in your way at present .
While he was busily untwisting the knot with his teeth , the man said something which attracted his attention ; whatever that something was , it led to something else , and in the end he and <NAME> walked away side by side -- the strange man talking earnestly , and <NAME> listening .
And let gratitude to me rest ; and let affection for me rest ; and let me rest in my out-of-the-way room , with no society and no attention , while you find new relations to make much of , who have no earthly claim upon you !
More than once upon this journey , and now again as he stood pondering at this journey ' s end , tracing figures in the dust with his stick , the thought came into his mind , what was there he could interpose between himself and it ?
" Why , I have heard of him -- seen him too , I think .
I see ' im do it , and I giv ' ' im a shy as a Widdy-warning to ' im not to go a-bruisin ' ' is master ' s mutton any more. ' ' Come here. ' ' I won ' t ; I ' ll come when yer can ketch me. ' ' Stay there then
And he demanded , with a sneer , whether the housekeeper was in the habit of counting the plate at night ; because if she did n't find a table-spoon or two missing some sunshiny morning , why , he would be content to -- and so forth .
As she now stood panting , looking at her with the utmost detestation that she was capable of expressing , and trembling from head to foot with rage and scorn , I thought I had never seen such a sight , and never could see such another .
I tried to thank him , but couldn ' t .
' It may have been his unfortunate destiny .
' It wouldn ' t surprise me at all .
'For , ' says he , 'Krook , I am much depressed ; my cause is on again , and I think I 'm nearer judgment than I ever was . '
Through this device the two young people conversed at great length and committed themselves to a variety of delicate sentiments , without having once opened their lips , save to say yes or no , and even that not to one another .
This I addressed to <NAME> -- for in that place , so memorable to me , he lived -- and went and posted , myself , without losing a minute .
And he said , Here are the stutterings— ' ' Statistics , ' said <NAME> .
'Of course not , ' replied the doctor , with a nervous glance at the two ladies .
" Shall I tell you what I always think of you and the fortune yet to come for you , my love ? "
' She has been an angel , mother , ' returned <NAME> , ' for a little while ; and has run into the opposite extreme , since , by way of compensation. ' ' You should be careful not to irritate her , <NAME> .
They talked of many subjects ( his partner never had had such a ready store to draw upon for the beguiling of the time ) , and so to bed , and to sleep .
' That ' s a girl of spirit , and we ' ll drink her health. ' It is needless to say , that Pyke and Co. responded , with great warmth of manner , to this proposal , or that the toast was drunk with many little insinuations from the firm , relative to the completeness of <NAME>
' I think not , ' replied Mrs. Maylie , taking it back .
He merely returned their salutations with a wave of his hand , and relaxed not in his dignified pace , until he reached the farm where Mrs. Mann tended the infant paupers with parochial care .

I assure you , ' and he laughed again , ' I feel quite a traitor in the camp of those dear , gifted , good , noble fellows , my brother artists , by not doing the hocus-pocus better .
<NAME> , " returned the old man impatiently .
He is a promising fellow -- in his way -- but he may not have it all his own way .
Having so discharged himself of the subject of his cogitations , he falls into step and marches off with the trooper , shoulder to shoulder .
In other words , five pounds and <NAME> were offered to any man or woman who wanted an apprentice to any trade , business , or calling .
She heard him striking in the door , as she ran on , with her hands widely spread , and her hair streaming , and her face like a distracted person ' s , back to her own room .
It ' s beautiful ! ' <NAME> having been thus rebuked , and being in perfect possession of the speech aside , the bachelor singled out another boy .
Consider , for <NAME> ' s sake -- help -- Sam -- here -- pray , gentlemen -- interfere , somebody. ' Uttering these incoherent exclamations , <NAME> rushed between the infuriated combatants just in time to receive the carpet-bag on one side of his body , and the fire-shovel on the other .
And therefore if I were a <NAME> , I think I would be a Transcendentalist .
" I was going down the street here when I happened to stop and look in at the musical instruments in the shop-window -- a friend of mine is in want of a second-hand wiolinceller of a good tone -- and I saw a party enjoying themselves , and I thought it was you in the corner ; I

<NAME> 's Narrative We held many consultations about what <NAME> was to be , first without <NAME> , as he had requested , and afterwards with him , but it was a long time before we seemed to make progress .
Here , however , an object presented itself , which rekindled their hopes , and reanimated their drooping spirits .
Go away ! ' He went out , and she shut the door upon him .
My <NAME> ( who is childless ) , looking out in the early twilight from her boudoir at a keeper 's lodge and seeing the light of a fire upon the latticed panes , and smoke rising from the chimney , and a child , chased by a woman , running out into the rain to meet the shining
His <NAME> house is by the fire ; and he lies within it , on his bed of flannel , querulously trying to sleep .
' I know his whole history : but we can talk about that presently .
There was a table drawn up before the window , at which <NAME> was seated reading .
The waiter retired ; and reappearing almost immediately with a request that <NAME> would follow him , led the way to a large room on the first floor , where , seated at a long table covered with books and papers , was <NAME> .
' So , here ' s to <NAME> and Son. ' ' Oh , very well , <NAME> , ' said the boy , merrily .
" It IS gratifying , " said Mrs. Jellyby .
I said it was not the custom in <NAME> to confer titles on men distinguished by peaceful services , however good and great , unless occasionally when they consisted of the accumulation of some very large amount of money .
' They are very distinguished people , evidently , ' said Mrs. Nickleby , as she took her daughter ' s arm .
' Put my shoes there , ' continued <NAME> .
And thinking of the old ' un is a thing she never done , I do assure you , since she left <NAME> ! ' ' Now , last , not least , <NAME> , ' said I .
Both cases are of a singular and special kind and it is very doubtful whether either can be considered as a precedent likely to be extensively followed by succeeding generations .

Mountain-peaks of great celebrity in the valleys , whence no trace of their existence was visible sometimes for months together , had been since morning plain and near in the blue sky .

He looked , to the best of his ability , when he asked me for it confidentially , as if he had never seen me before ; but well did I know him , and well did he know me .
' <NAME> , ' said Mr Dorrit , ' you have just now been the subject of some conversation between myself and Mrs General .
He wished it were , but no such thing could be .
' It was not until four years of age that the poor child ' s bodily health seemed restored , and she was able to enter upon her apprenticeship of life and the world .
' The fact is , ' said Mr <NAME> , ' there ' s a little payment on a bond debt -- three hundred and seventy odd , overdue : and I ' m in possession. ' ' In possession ! ' cried <NAME> , looking round at the shop .
Your coming here is an affront , an impertinence , an audacity .
' She may be safely trusted now , ' returned <NAME> .
He took it , standing at the littered bar , and looked loweringly at a man who stood where <NAME> had stood that early morning .
Is sure he is at the head of a lodge , and wears short aprons , and is made a perfect idol of with candlesticks and trowels .
But the sprinkling was a swarm in the <NAME> cottage , and filled it .
An accidental circumstance cemented the intimacy between <NAME> and me , in a manner that inspired me with great pride and satisfaction , though it sometimes led to inconvenience .
He pointed behind him at the boat , and gasped to that degree that he dropped upon the stones to get his breath .
' If you have known him long , you know it , I am sure , much better than I can inform you. ' I replied that I was certain he was ; but that I had not known him long myself , though he was a friend of my aunt ' s .
" You must know , " said my sister , rising , " it 's a pie ; a savory pork pie. " The company murmured their compliments .
Quite celestial ! ' ' It often sounds to me quite devilish .

He said it was the very thing for <NAME> .
The murderer staggering backward to the wall , and shutting out the sight with his hand , seized a heavy club and struck her down .
When you go away from here , you will have concluded what is a mere matter of bargain and sale , hiring and letting : and will stay away .
This celebrated <NAME> was a marvellous ill-favoured , ill-conditioned old lady , of a stooping figure , with a mottled face , like bad marble , a hook nose , and a hard grey eye , that looked as if it might have been hammered at on an anvil without sustaining any injury .
However , the <NAME> were kind hearts ; and when they saw the little fellow cheerily limping about with a good-humoured face , doing no harm , drawing no knives , committing no outrageous immoralities , living chiefly on farinaceous and milk diet , and playing with <NAME> ' s children of an evening , they began to think
' I don ' t know that he is , but I believe so. ' ' Ah , you may depend upon it he is , or he wouldn ' t be so surly , ' remarked <NAME> , who was an odd little mixture of shrewdness and simplicity .
In the <NAME> 's little household , as in very many others , the articles of daily consumption that were wanted were purchased every evening , in small quantities and at various small shops .
'Those persons are indemnified by me .
I always understood he took his name from being found on a <NAME> night. ' ' He seems an amiable fellow. ' ' Bless you , sir , there ' s not a bit of him , ' returned <NAME> , ' that ' s not amiable .
What is its intention and object ? ' ' I conclude it means , that on such a day we are to eat and drink in their house , and that its intent and object is to confer pleasure upon us , ' said <NAME> .
He was perpetually pegging at the floor the moment she left his sight .
But notwithstanding these precedents to the contrary , <NAME> was an ill-conditioned , cross-grained , surly fellow -- a morose and lonely man , who consorted with nobody but himself , and an old wicker bottle which fitted into his large deep waistcoat pocket -- and who eyed each merry face , as it passed him by , with
And now we understand each other. ' ' Especially as there was nothing to be got by it -- eh ? ' sneered <NAME> .
On each face , wonder and fear were painted vividly ; each so still and silent , looking at the other over the black gulf of the irrevocable past .
I am very sorry for what I did , and I hope you will forgive me. ' ' I am glad to hear you are sorry , <NAME> , ' he replied .
I -- I -- look at me , <NAME> , look at me ! ' ' You would never let ME do that , ' said <NAME> in a tone of gentle reproach .
Before the frightful results of this desperate action , Mr Pancks himself recoiled in consternation .
It 's not as if I wanted a profession for life .
Be this as it may , the boys were recalled from house-window , garden , stable , and cow-yard , and the school were assembled in full conclave , when <NAME> , with a small bundle of papers in his hand , and Mrs. S. following with a pair of canes , entered the room and proclaimed silence .
I am almost sure it was you. " <NAME> took the hesitating little hand that confidingly advanced to take his , and he put it with some ceremony to his lips .
" Do you know this ? " said he , making as if he would take aim at me .
In my social experiences since Mrs <NAME> came upon the scene and left it , I have found Circumlocutional champions disposed to be warm with me on the subject of my view of the <NAME> .
The unseen force was drawing him fast to itself , now , and all the tides and winds were setting straight and strong towards it .

' You can take that bundle of cigars to smoke on the journey , if you like , ' said Mr Dorrit , with a careless wave of his hand .
" Thank you , sir , " I replied ; " thank you very much indeed , but I hope you wo n't be offended -- they are too rich for me . "
Oh <NAME> , <NAME> -- my dear , good , affectionate , faithful , complimentary , charming friend -- if I only had you here ! ' His wife , who had retreated lest she should seem to listen to these mutterings , ventured to approach him again , and was about to speak , when he hurried to
' Give me your ' -- <NAME> started -- ' hand. ' They shook hands , and on Mr <NAME> ' s part , in particular , there ensued great geniality .
' But ! -- After a long time when I have not been able to find that he is here in <NAME> , some one tells me of a soldier with white hair -- hey ? -- not hair like this that he carries -- white -- who lives retired secrettementally , in a certain place .
It was long and thick .
He then took us down between decks ; and there , any lingering fears I had of his having heard any rumours of what had happened , were dispelled by <NAME> ' s coming out of the gloom , taking his arm with an air of friendship and protection , and telling me that they had scarcely been asunder
Thus the evening wore away with the Cruncher family , until <NAME> was ordered to bed , and his mother , laid under similar injunctions , obeyed them .
He describes it as a large apartment , with a red brick floor and a capacious chimney ; the ceiling garnished with hams , sides of bacon , and ropes of onions .
' With four horses I declare ! ' said <NAME> , quite aghast at the preparations .
" I have been sitting with him since ten o'clock last night . "
The old clerk with the wig , whose name was <NAME> , had been down on business several times in the course of his career , and had on each occasion penetrated to the breakfast-parlour .
' This gentleman is only <NAME> and Co. of <NAME> , that I am trying to make terms for an unfortunate friend with in a matter of some dishonoured bills .
if you please , <NAME> ! ' said <NAME> : ' and so would Florence. ' ' Girls , ' said Mr Dombey , ' have nothing to do with <NAME> and <NAME> .
The reservation was not intentional .
He did n't at all see why the busy bee should be proposed as a model to him ; he supposed the bee liked to make honey , or he would n't do it -- nobody asked him .
There was a fragrance of limes or lemons about him ; and he made a drink of golden sherry , which shone in a large tumbler as if he were drinking the evening sunshine .
I like my art , and I know how to exercise my art , and I mean to have the keeping of this document. ' ' But what has that got to do with your art , partner ? ' asked <NAME> , in an insinuating tone .

' My children , my defrauded , swindled infants ! ' cried <NAME> , pulling so hard , in his vehemence , at the flaxen tail of his second daughter , that he lifted her up on tiptoe , and kept her , for some seconds , in that attitude .
Though she was always staring , she never acknowledged that she saw any individual .
It is quite understood that Mr Boffin is in no way committed on that point .
Sometimes they played tricks upon him ; but they never knew how he felt them , and shrunk up , when he was alone with me .
<NAME> , five millions , in five hundred thousand shares of ten pounds each. " Why the very name will get the shares up to a premium in ten days. ' ' And when they ARE at a premium , ' said <NAME> , smiling .
She said she must be hup and hout o ' purpose .
' <NAME> yourself. ' ' He followed us to-night , when we first came here ! ' ' Yer lie , I didn ' t ! ' replies Deputy , in his one form of polite contradiction .
What would a hundred a year for instance , be to him ? ' ' I don ' t know what it would be to him , ' said <NAME> , with energy , ' but it would be that to me I would rather die than take. ' ' Heyday ! ' cried <NAME> .

' Just so , ma ' am -- and relating what I knew .
<NAME> <NAME> tapped with his cane on the counter several times ; but , attracting no attention , and beholding a light shining through the glass-window of the little parlour at the back of the shop , he made bold to peep in and see what was going forward ; and when he saw what was going forward ,
Thus far , Mr <NAME> had let his dusty friend off lightly , having been baulked in that amiable design of frequently dining with him , by the machinations of the sleepless dustman .
It was not until the night of this last awful day , that a withering sense of his helpless , desperate state came in its full intensity upon his blighted soul ; not that he had ever held any defined or positive hope of mercy , but that he had never been able to consider more than the dim
I am told people now call him The <NAME> .
' Ah ! ' said the old man turning to me with a sigh , as if I had spoken to him but that moment , ' you don ' t know what you say when you tell me that I don ' t consider her. ' ' You must not attach too great weight to a remark founded
Mr <NAME> laughed , and turned upon his heel .
<NAME> ' t you remember saying to me once , that perhaps I should be a partner in <NAME> ' s business , and perhaps it might be <NAME> and <NAME> ?
'You will decide quickly , ' said <NAME> , with perfect firmness and composure .
Then came the dessert and some more toasts .
The time is so short that I have not a moment too much in the week. ' ' Why serious , my life , then ?
No , ' she cried out , seeing the other .
Upon which , the clergyman said again , " WHO giveth this woman to be married to this man ? " The old gentleman being still in a state of most estimable unconsciousness , the bridegroom cried out in his accustomed voice , " Now <NAME> P. you know ; who giveth ? " To which the <NAME> replied
Lying in it , as in a grave or sarcophagus , with a hurried drapery of sheet and blanket thrown across it , was the body of a heavily-made man , with an obtuse head , and coarse , mean , common features .
Does this not seem like -- I do not say it is -- sacrificing <NAME> to the preservation of your preeminent and unassailable position ? ' Again the light in his eyes fell upon her , as she stood looking at her husband : now with an extraordinary and awful smile upon her face .
' These are two cut-throats from <NAME> , who have come down here to destroy his <NAME> ' s population , thinking that at this distance from the capital , the arm of the law is weak and paralysed .
No , no. ' When <NAME> found coherent words to utter , <NAME> bent forward with his hand to his ear , and a face as calm as if its every line of sternness had been cast in iron .
You have seen me , sir , only on common-place occasions , when I dare say you have thought me a common-place woman , a little more self-willed than the generality .
She made him no answer .
<NAME> <NAME> sits out the procession in his own easy manner and glides from the carriage when the opportunity he has settled with himself arrives .
<NAME> , my dear , you recollect ?
<NAME> <NAME> , profoundly attentive , throws this off with a shrug of self-depreciation and contracts his eyebrows a little more .
' Suppose she should be murdered .
What have you done to my best friend ?
We sat round the fire , and talked delightfully .
<NAME> , mother , and come away. ' ' And him so rich ? ' murmured the old woman .
The crystallized snow was in his eyelashes , in his hair , lying in ridges on his dress .
It is not the only reputation that has been acquired as easily , nor are such fortunate circumstances confined to partridge-shooting .
To inquire what he might have done , if he had had any boldness , would be like inquiring what a mongrel cur might do , if it had the spirit of a tiger .
Now , waxwork and skeleton seemed to have dark eyes that moved and looked at me .
I saw but did not comprehend his touching the other on the breast to keep him back .
' I don ' t like this plan , ' said <NAME> , after deep meditation .
And I could n't be a match for the rogues , without being a match for you , who are the blackest-looking and the worst rogue between this and <NAME> .
But what interest have you in recommending her to such a step ?
You have a good scent , <NAME> , -- cats , boy , cats !
' I hope you don ' t suppose there ' s anybody here who is to prevent my talking as I like ? ' ' Nobody wants to , pa , ' rejoined his daughter .
<NAME> <NAME> lay at our house that night .
' Mama ! ' cried <NAME> , joyfully meeting her .
How are we ever to grow rich if I forget them ? ' The child could only shake her head .
It shook me in my habit -- the habit of nine-tenths of the world -- of believing that all was right about me , because I was used to it , ' said their visitor ; ' and induced me to recall the history of the two brothers , and to ponder on it .
I know you have one yourself too often .
She has been spoiled by <NAME> , and is amenable to nobody .
A suspicion crossed my mind during my inspection of this noble charity , whether the superintendent had quite sufficient knowledge of the world and worldly characters ; and whether he did not commit a great mistake in treating some young girls , who were to all intents and purposes , by their years and their past lives , women
If you have ever contemplated your father 's poor position with a feeling of pride , you may rest assured that he will do nothing to tarnish it .
And pressing her son 's hand , affectionately , she hastened from the room .
Many a time had that kind creature got up , and gone out to Mrs Sprodgkin ( such was the disciple ' s name ) , suppressing a strong sense of her comicality by his strong sense of duty , and perfectly knowing that nothing but a cold would come of it .
' As a bandit , ' repeated <NAME> , mildly .
I have seen her sit , often and often , think , think , thinking , like him .
' When he who adores thee has left but the name -- ' ' What do you mean ? ' ' -- But the name , ' said <NAME> -- ' has left but the name -- in case of letters or parcels -- ' ' I never have any , ' returned the lodger .
Something he had long forgotten , appeared to struggle faintly in his mind .
If the funeral had been yesterday , I could not recollect it better .
If a clerk wanted his salary raised , <NAME> wouldn ' t listen to such a proposition .

Even what she read and said seemed to us to be ill-chosen for such auditors , if it had been imparted ever so modestly and with ever so much tact .
In three months more , a year would have passed since the beginning of my sorrow .
Something had made her keenly and additionally sensitive just now .
<NAME> leaves in the <NAME> ; fourteen in company all told .
' Dear <NAME> , ' I am in despair to be informed to-day by our prisoner here ( who has had the goodness to employ spies to seek me , living for politic reasons in retirement ) , that you have had fears for my safety .
' And <NAME> , I hope you will be careful not to refer before <NAME> , if you can help it , to my engagement to <NAME> .
That , as the <NAME> moved his head , his wife dropped down on one knee at his feet , and , with her hands imploringly lifted , fixed upon his face the memorable look I had never forgotten .

<NAME> <NAME> did not seek to conceal his share in the catastrophe , but lamented with tears in his eyes that the wrong-headed and treacherous behaviour of the young person in question , had rendered it necessary that he should become the victim of certain evidence for the crown : which , if it were not precisely true ,
At last , having gone through these proceedings and many others which were equally a part of his system , Mr <NAME> left them , reduced to a very obedient and humbled state , and betook himself to the river-side , where he took boat for the wharf on which he had bestowed his name .

I told her that my heart overflowed with love for her , that it was natural love which nothing in the past had changed or could change .
' Isn ' t it the truth ? ' demanded <NAME> .
A vision of change upon change , and still the same monotony of bells and wheels , and horses ' feet , and no rest .
What can I say to her , when <NAME> ' ly tied a ribbon off her own neck round little <NAME> ' s the last night she was here , and laid her head down on the pillow beside her till she was fast asleep !
But this boy , you know ; we must have him bound .
He drinks to Mrs. Bagnet with a warmth approaching to rapture , engages himself for that day twelvemonth more than thankfully , makes a memorandum of the day in a large black pocket-book with a girdle to it , and breathes a hope that Mrs. Bucket and Mrs. Bagnet may before then become , in a manner , sisters

" Why do n't you get out ? "
' <NAME> , <NAME> ? ' inquired the lady , winking and frowning to give him to understand that the question propounded , was , whether <NAME> should have ale , and not whether he ( <NAME> ) would take any .
It ' s the quiet , and the air. ' ' The quiet ! ' repeated <NAME> , with a contemptuous turn of his head towards the <NAME> ' s roar .
I can ' t bear you to call her that , ' returned <NAME> , snapping her fingers in a volley of impatient snaps , ' for I don ' t like Hexam. ' ' Indeed ? ' ' No. ' Miss <NAME> wrinkled her nose , to express dislike .
' What if I put off in her and take a look round ?

If little Mowcher ( who had no hand , young gentleman , in the making of herself ) addressed herself to him , or the like of him , because of her misfortunes , when do you suppose her small voice would have been heard ?

<NAME> , bolt upright as usual , sat taking his wine in the dusk at his open window ; his wineglass and decanter on the round table at his elbow ; himself and his legs on the window-seat ; only one hinge in his whole body , like a bootjack .
But I believe he only did it because they were easy , and didn ' t want any features .

On one of his visits Mrs <NAME> received him with the words , ' I have something to tell you , Mr Clennam , that will surprise you. ' So surprising was the something in question , that it actually brought <NAME> out of the parlour window and produced her in the garden walk , when <NAME> went in
He readily responded to his daughter 's drawing her arm through his , and took -- and kept -- her hand in both his own .
Mr <NAME> appeared to be on the verge of some mutinous expressions , when his hand happened to touch his nose .
She had forgotten to ask the name of the poor man , their friend , and when she had remembered him in her prayers , it seemed ungrateful not to turn one look towards the spot where he was watching .
" Yes , <NAME> , " said <NAME> , " almost quite bright . "
" <NAME> , " said I , " you remember the happy night when first we came down to <NAME> ?
Look into the world ; think how many hearts you would be proud to gain , are there .

His premises are the premises formerly occupied by <NAME> , marine store dealer -- a relation of this gentleman 's that you saw in his lifetime if I do n't mistake ? "
' It ' s all right , I am here , <NAME> is coming with your light. ' Then he said to the latter flustered woman , who was putting her cap on , ' Get out with you , and get up-stairs ! ' and then turned to the stranger and said to him , ' Now ,
' Why , Durdles ! ' exclaims <NAME> , looking on amused , ' you are undermined with pockets ! ' ' And I carries weight in ' em too , <NAME> .
The resolution I had made did not desert me , for , without uttering one vain word of appeal to him , I shouted out with all my might , and struggled with all my might .
The more he thought of the <NAME> 's admonition , the more he was at a loss to divine its real purpose and meaning .

In what I am going to do , I will not disguise myself to you at least .
Let him break into as many pieces as he will , the sword that he stained with my common blood ; he drew to defend himself -- thrust at me with all his skill for his life . '
The children drank the toast after her .
How can that be here !
' Why , ' replied <NAME> , on whose attentive face a thoughtful shade had stolen , ' it was rather a painful transaction , <NAME> , in my case .

I couldn ' t indeed , after that dreadful interview ! ' said <NAME> .

The surgeon deposited it in her arms .
" And he was much assisted , " says <NAME> as a wind-up , " by his son . "
Mrs <NAME> nodded assent ; and <NAME> had enough to do , for the rest of that day , in surveying <NAME> from head to foot , and watching all the workings of his countenance , with the interest attaching to a boy of mysterious and terrible experiences .
' What do you want here ?
' Yes , ' said <NAME> with a good-humoured smile and nod of the head .
He thought of what his home might be if <NAME> were there ; he placed her in the empty chair , looked upon her , heard her speak ; he felt again upon his arm the gentle pressure of the trembling hand ; he strewed his costly rooms with the hundred silent tokens of feminine presence and occupation ;
Only me , ' replied a tremulous voice .
My mother , contrary to her usual habit , instead of coming to the elbow-chair by the fire , remained at the other end of the room , and sat singing to herself .
Her rich colour , her quick blood , her rapid breath , were all setting themselves against the opportunity of retracing their steps .
However , when I come to consider that even in <NAME> ' s house—if she had one—and in mine—if I had one— ' ' You were going to say ( but that I interrupted you in spite of myself ) what a quiet life mine is .
Evening was drawing on , but had not closed in , when -- still travelling among the same dismal objects -- they came to a busy town .
But , in a moment he was back again with the question : ' How did you get your wooden leg ? ' Mr <NAME> replied , ( tartly to this personal inquiry ) , ' In an accident. ' ' Do you like it ? ' ' Well !
it ' s little enough , ' replied <NAME> , ' because Ma always treats me as if I was in the nursery ( I am sure I wish I was !

" The boy makes it one .
The smell of its jars of old rose-leaves and lavender seems to come upon me even here. ' When his knock at the bright brass knocker of obsolete shape brought a woman-servant to the door , those faded scents in truth saluted him like wintry breath that had a faint remembrance in it of the bygone spring .
' But merely for your own satisfaction and guidance -- and guidance , of course , ' repeated Mr Carker , ' with a view to your future proceedings. ' ' Thank ' ee kindly , I am sure , ' said the <NAME> , listening with great attention .
He looks at them with an eager eye and rattles something in his pocket -- halfpence perhaps .
We ' ll make up a party of our own , and I ' ll engage that they shall not interfere with you for one single moment .
Once upon a time <NAME> had sat at that table taking no heed of anything but <NAME> ; now the principal heed he took of <NAME> was to observe , against his will , that she was very fond of porter , that she combined a great deal of sherry with sentiment , and that if she were a
" I wish it was , " growls <NAME> , without changing his position .
Let them not hope to taste it !
He did not actually stagger under the negus ; but I should think his placid little pulse must have made two or three more beats in a minute , than it had done since the great night of my aunt ' s disappointment , when she struck at him with her bonnet .
' What about him ! ' ' Dead ! ' I thought it was the office reeling , and not I , as one of the clerks caught hold of me .
' She don ' t know me , <NAME> ; she just drowsily mutters and stares .
At all these encounters , <NAME> , <NAME> , of <NAME> , and his friends , waxed fierce and furious ; until at last <NAME> , <NAME> , of <NAME> , begged to ask his opponent , the <NAME> , of <NAME> , whether that band played by his consent ; which question the <NAME> declining to answer ,
' Oh , my dear mistress , what is the matter ? ' ' Your master -- your brutal master , ' murmured the patient .
<NAME> ' t you , <NAME> ? ' <NAME> seemed to be in the main a good-natured little body , although a disciple of that school of trainers of the young idea which holds that childhood , like money , must be shaken and rattled and jostled about a good deal to keep it bright .
<NAME> <NAME> comes more fully into the conversation to state what , in his opinion , a fellow can do .

<NAME> was resolved that it should be quietly done ; and the clerk had given her away , and there had been no witnesses of the ceremony .
May I say by her father ? ' <NAME> replied , ' I know it. ' ' You know it ! ' said Mr Carker , with a great appearance of relief .
" It 's for you , <NAME> , " said <NAME> , going out and coming back with it , " and I hope there is nothing the matter. " This was in allusion to its heavy black seal and border .
Perhaps I should only have to say to <NAME> , " Would you like to come and see me married to-morrow , my pet ? "
It happened at the epoch of the cheese , when the <NAME> , having taken a glass of port wine , and hemmed twice or thrice , said : ' It is remarkable , Mr Feeder , that the <NAME> -- ' At the mention of this terrible people , their implacable enemies , every young gentleman fastened his

There , one of neat <NAME> ' s little windows , like the eyes in needles , was illuminated , and in a corner near it sat <NAME> watching , while <NAME> at the table stitched at the neat little body she was making up by brown paper pattern for her own wearing .
The more <NAME> drew him out , the finer he came -- like wire .
To give me money would be to take away your trust , to take away the object that you have given me , to take away the only certain thing that saves me from the river. ' ' In the name of the great judge , ' said I , ' before whom you and all of us must

' Then , how can you dare , ' said my mother -- ' you know I don ' t mean how can you dare , <NAME> , but how can you have the heart -- to make me so uncomfortable and say such bitter things to me , when you are well aware that I haven ' t
<NAME> ' t you know me ? ' <NAME> looked it in the face , and thought , was this his father ?
While the old gentleman was thus engaged , a very buxom-looking cook , dressed in mourning , who had been bustling about , in the bar , glided into the room , and bestowing many smirks of recognition upon <NAME> , silently stationed herself at the back of his father ' s chair , and announced her presence by
' I follow you , sir , ' returned <NAME> ; who had done his work of consuming meat and drink in a workmanlike manner , though mostly in speechlessness .
<NAME> , you idiot ! ' Not caring to represent to the dwarf in his present humour , that the loss of a key by another person could scarcely be said to affect his ( <NAME> ' s ) legal knowledge in any material degree , Mr Brass humbly suggested that it must have been forgotten over night ,
( <NAME> , it may be remarked , seemed to be pointing with the tip of his cap to a most flourishing epitaph , and to be chuckling over it with all his heart . )

On his answering in the affirmative , " Then bring me another pint of this same wine , drawer , and come and wake me at ten. " The bill being paid , <NAME> rose and wished him good night .
He won ' t do more than he can help , I dare say. ' Mr <NAME> had evidently a strong inclination to make an angry reply , but was deterred by prudent or timid considerations , as he only muttered something about aggravation and a vagabond ; not associating the terms with any individual , but mentioning them
' God bless you , dear <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> was so far sensible of HIS affliction , that he wrung his hand ; but , otherwise , he remained in the same state , and no one dared to disturb him .
Again <NAME> nodded his head .

She didn ' t tell Em ' ly what she come out fur , lest her ' art should fail , and she should think of hiding of herself .

You ' d say so , if you saw his moustachios .
" There 's not much to choose between your two states , " says the visitor in a key too low for the old man 's dull hearing as he looks from him to the old woman and back again .
' You shall be satisfied by seeing it .
Still , it holds to him , as many things much better worth remembering never did .
<NAME> <NAME> no sooner got into the open air , than he was seized with a sudden desire to lie on the curbstone ; <NAME> thought it would be a pity to contradict him , and so let him have his own way .
Not a word before <NAME> , for all the world. ' ' You ' ve got some money , haven ' t you ? ' whispered the <NAME> .
She made no sound of laughter , but she rolled her head , and shook it , and put her handkerchief to her mouth , and appealed to <NAME> with her elbow , and her hand , and her shoulder , and was so unspeakably entertained altogether that it was with some difficulty she could marshal <NAME> through the
I saw no other officers or attendants , and none were needed .
Set down by the omnibus at the corner of <NAME> , and trusting to her feet and her crutch-stick within its precincts , the dolls ' dressmaker proceeded to the place of business of <NAME> and Co. All there was sunny and quiet externally , and shady and quiet internally .

It was Sunday -- a bright , clear , wintry afternoon -- and as they traversed the village street , those who were walking in their path drew back to make way for them , and gave them a softened greeting .
I call it whatever THEY call it .
' They can ' t do better than go back to the country , ma ' am ; they are in everybody ' s way here. ' ' Certainly , ' said <NAME> , rubbing her hands , ' if Mrs. <NAME> took the apartments without the means of paying for them , it was very unbecoming a lady.
If I am brought from home at this time of night , let it be for something .
Who are such a relief from the crowd that are all alike !
A female may be highly connected , but she can ' t be permitted to bother and badger a man in my position , and I am not going to put up with it. ' ( <NAME> felt it necessary to get on : foreseeing that if he allowed of details , he would be beaten . )
Who puts such things into his head , <NAME> ? ' ' My dear <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , after a moment ' s silence , ' it is of no use inquiring .
' I wouldn ' t ask you , <NAME> , ' said Mrs. <NAME> , ' if I didn ' t know what a good , kind-hearted creature you are ; no , not for worlds .
I can not therefore condescend to speak of them as the <NAME> .
The marriage was to make no change in their place of residence ; they had been able to extend it , by taking to themselves the upper rooms formerly belonging to the apocryphal invisible lodger , and they desired nothing more .
By the bye -- ' As <NAME> pronounced the last three words , he stopped suddenly , reclosed the door which he had opened , and , walking softly back to <NAME> , stepped close up to him on tiptoe , and said , in a very soft whisper -- ' You couldn ' t make it convenient to
This was a common phrase of words which had a fair and promising sound , and I resolved to form <NAME> ' s mind .

He had a fancy , it seemed , that they had left her there alone ; and could not bear the thought .
I had purposely misled them , that I might have the pleasure of taking them by surprise .
and retires to his former place .
It was some one else .
At all times I lounged about the house and neighbourhood quite disregarded , except that they were jealous of my making any friends : thinking , perhaps , that if I did , I might complain to someone .
But confess this , <NAME> ; who believes you to be poor now ? ' ' No one , ' said the old man .
He was the master o ' that ' ere shop , sir , and the inwentor o ' the patent-never-leavin ' -off sassage steam-ingin , as ' ud swaller up a pavin ' stone if you put it too near , and grind it into sassages as easy as if it was a tender young babby .
It was curious , but not so pleasant , to turn from the beauty and grace of the girl , to the stooping figure , care-worn face , and jaded aspect of the old man .
' Ay , and indeed plenty to think about , too .
says <NAME> aside , with his hat already on and buttoning his coat .
They never thought of inquiring how many of their own countrymen would be returned upon their hands from divers parts of the world , if the principle were generally recognised ; they considered it particularly and peculiarly <NAME> .
I do not consider that in making this offer to <NAME> I am by any means throwing myself away ; neither is that the opinion of my friends .
First of all , it was necessary to awaken the girl , who had fallen asleep with her face on the kitchen table ; this took a little time , and , even when she did answer the bell , another quarter of an hour was consumed in fruitless endeavours to impart to her a faint and distant glimmering
' <NAME> to detain you , ' replied the gull ; ' but <NAME> has been so ama-azingly funny that I couldn ' t tear myself away. ' ' No , no , ' said <NAME> ; ' it was all his lordship .
Some of the glass in the window he had so often watched , had been broken in the rough hurry of the morning , and that room looked more deserted and dull than any .
<NAME> and myself , ma ' am -- ' ' <NAME> ' t address yourself to me ! ' she interrupted with a frown .
You advertised that <NAME> ( Captain <NAME> , if you hold to the saying 'Once a captain , always a captain ' ) was to hear of something to his advantage . "
He had never thought <NAME> half so beautiful before .
My dear Mr Carker , take a seat , I beg. ' He offered no reply to the mother , but fixed his eyes on the proud daughter , as though he would only be bidden by her , and was resolved to be bidden by her .
<NAME> , there would embark in that troop-ship when she got to <NAME> , a mighty general , of large property ( name also unknown ) , who wouldn ' t hear of going to victory without his wife , and whose wife was the lovely woman , and she was destined to become the idol of all the
If I had wanted to use anything save narcotic medicines that were poisons in themselves , I would not have administered any of those .
Surgeons were sent for , and she sat supporting his head .
" For the <NAME> , " said the old man with a chuckle , " not to be acquainted with a <NAME> is queer , ai n't it , <NAME> ?
' And that ' s all you conclude it is , my dear ? ' ' I have not yet arrived at anything deeper , mother. ' ' Then I ' ll just tell you one thing , ' said Mrs. Nickleby , you ' ll find yourself a little surprised ; that ' s all .
Neither did he wear anything more on his head than his own crisply-curling short dark hair .
" The chateau and all the race , " returned <NAME> .
' But IS the story done ? ' said <NAME> , pondering .
And the best of it was , he married so soon that little <NAME> was an uncle , before the calves of his legs , already mentioned in this history , had ever been encased in broadcloth pantaloons , -- though that was not quite the best either , for of necessity the baby was an uncle too .
' A regular right-down bad 'un , Work'us , ' replied <NAME> , coolly .
As the odious <NAME> attached himself to Kate with less and less of disguise , Mrs. Wititterly began to grow jealous of the superior attractions of <NAME> .
I should have thought that neither of you would have married ; least of all should I have thought of your marrying each other. ' ' No more should I , ' said <NAME> , tying the pillow tightly in its case .
<NAME> 's niece was not one of the blind-man 's buff party , but was made comfortable with a large chair and a footstool , in a snug corner , where the <NAME> and <NAME> were close behind her .
Over against this chair , <NAME> , with apoplectic exertions that were not at all required , dragged the box which was her seat on story-telling occasions , sat down upon it , hugged her own knees , and said , with a voracious appetite for stories , and with widely-opened eyes : ' Now , <NAME> , let
All the livelong day , and for hours after it had grown dark , <NAME> paced softly up and down the garden , raising his eyes every instant to the sick chamber , and shuddering to see the darkened window , looking as if death lay stretched inside .
' <NAME> ' t be flurried , my dear , ' replied Mrs. Nickleby , looking towards the garden-wall , ' for you see I ' m not , and if it would be excusable in anybody to be flurried , it certainly would -- under all the circumstances -- be excusable in me , but I am not

At nine o ' clock on such a morning , the place of business of <NAME> and Co. was not the liveliest object even in <NAME> Mary Axe -- which is not a very lively spot -- with a sobbing gaslight in the counting-house window , and a burglarious stream of fog creeping in to strangle it through the
' It ' s quite delightful. ' ' Hem ! ' said <NAME> , rather dubiously .
" Officer , " retorts <NAME> with a fiery eye and a quivering lip , " you know your duty .
' I told you so , ' quoth Mr Inspector , pulling off his outer coat , and leaning well over the stern with a will .
' I was on the staircase , and couldn ' t hear distinctly ; the impression on my mind is -- ' ' The gentlemen of the jury want none of the impressions on your mind , <NAME> , which I fear would be of little service to honest , straightforward men , ' interposed <NAME> .
There are no debts , the loan from <NAME> ' s <NAME> is paid off and all my keys I send with this .
It came up hot at about my time every day , and many a day did I dine off it .
You give him his bottle of wine here ; you give him meat , drink , and lodging there ; you dare not touch him with a finger or an epithet .
But <NAME> , unconscious of these little defects , sets his heart on Mrs. Bagnet eating a most severe quantity of the delicacies before her ; and as that good old girl would not cause him a moment 's disappointment on any day , least of all on such a day , for any consideration , she imperils her
" You were dismissed by your lady , you know , " <NAME> observes , following her out upon the staircase , " as the most implacable and unmanageable of women .

Have you time to spare ? " I had so much time to spare , that the proposal came as a relief , notwithstanding its irreconcilability with my latent desire to keep my eye on the coach-office .
' So I should be disposed to imagine , ' replied <NAME> .
The dispute ran high , and the dilemma lasted long ; and just as the executive were on the point of overcoming <NAME> ' s objection to walking to the magistrate ' s , by the trite expedient of carrying him thither , it was recollected that there stood in the inn yard , an old sedan-chair , which
' When we stopped at <NAME> ' s , and he asked that scoundrel a question or two , purporting to refer only to the lodging-houses in which there was accommodation for us , had I the least suspicion of him ?
' As a woman , ' returned <NAME> .
I AM proud of this free and happy country .
My dear Daisy , ' said <NAME> , laughing .
Though his services were rendered quite gratuitously .
Mrs <NAME> set that resolute old face of hers , and darkly nodded yes .
I was a thundering bad son , that 's the long and the short of it , and never was a credit to anybody . "
There is a sharp misgiving in my conscience that if I were to live , I should disappoint your good opinion and my own -- and that I ought to die , my dear ! ' The winds and tides rose and fell a certain number of times , the earth moved round the sun a certain number of
I told him that , without deep trimmings , the family was disgraced .
' Come on Thursday fortnight , and bring the other chaps with you , ' said <NAME> ; ' I ' m going to have a few medical fellows that night. ' <NAME> expressed the pleasure it would afford him to meet the medical fellows ; and after <NAME> had informed him that he meant to be very cosy
By that time we were so anxious and nervous that even <NAME> confessed , as we rattled over the stones of the old street , to feeling an irrational desire to drive back again .
' When I lie down to-night , and my thoughts come back -- as they will , for they do every night , even when I have not seen you -- to this sad place , I may believe that there is no grief beyond this room , now , and its usual occupants , which preys on <NAME>
You have been so brotherly as to propose to me to fall in here and take my place among the products of your perseverance and sense .
Besides the two men , a notched and disfigured bench , immovable from the wall , with a draught-board rudely hacked upon it with a knife , a set of draughts , made of old buttons and soup bones , a set of dominoes , two mats , and two or three wine bottles .
In the extreme sharpness of his look out for base coin , <NAME> , as at present situated , never saw anything but money ; so <NAME> passed him unrecognised , and they went in .
I am therefore willing to believe that she was in a fit when we found her under the boiler ; and that the deficient tea-spoons were attributable to the dustman .
' Let me leave this house , and go home. ' ' Yes , yes , ' said <NAME> .
Why , what ' s put that in your silly little head ? ' -- For <NAME> had been used of old to talk to my mother sometimes like a child .
Oh happy Saturdays , when <NAME> always came at noon , and never would , in any weather , stay away , though <NAME> snarled and growled , and worried her bitterly .
If I should live to be blind and deaf I know I shall see and hear you , in my fancy , to the last of my dim old days ! ' Mrs <NAME> wept most heartily , and embraced her with all fondness ; but said not one single word except that she was her dear girl .
<NAME> <NAME> had been , that morning , a vast dusky mass of scarecrows heaving to and fro , with frequent gleams of light above the billowy heads , where steel blades and bayonets shone in the sun .
' I don ' t suppose there ' s a man going , as possesses the fondness for youth that I do .
' One motion of my hand , and she would never again have uttered cry or sound .
I assure you , Mr Dombey , <NAME> intended me for an <NAME> .
* * * * * We left <NAME> for <NAME> again , on the thirtieth of May , crossing to <NAME> , on the opposite shore of the <NAME> , in a steamboat ; we then took the railroad to <NAME> <NAME> ' s , which is on the brink of <NAME> .
" What name shall I say to my father ? "
Covering a Multitude of <NAME> IX .
They were all shivering , and everything about them seemed to be shivering ; the river itself ; craft , rigging , sails , such early smoke as there yet was on the shore .
I said he was right there -- never under my roof , where the <NAME> were sacred , and the laws of hospitality paramount .
The shadow of a supposed act of injustice , which had hung over him since his father ' s death , was so vague and formless that it might be the result of a reality widely remote from his idea of it .
Now , the clustered roofs , and piles of buildings , trembling with the working of engines , and dimly resounding with their shrieks and throbbings ; the tall chimneys vomiting forth a black vapour , which hung in a dense ill-favoured cloud above the housetops and filled the air with gloom ; the clank of hammers beating upon
What does it matter , so that I have it safe ?
<NAME> ' s very sorry , " says Mrs. Cripps , " couldn ' t help it -- fetched away early this morning to a consultation of the very first surgeons in the country -- couldn ' t do without him -- would have him at any price -- tremendous operation. " The fact is , ' said <NAME>
He is gone away , and there is no present expectation of his return .
Mrs <NAME> sat in the pay-place , chinking silver moneys from noon till night , and solemnly calling upon the crowd to take notice that the price of admission was only sixpence , and that the departure of the whole collection , on a short tour among the <NAME> of <NAME> , was positively fixed for that day week
His avarice and caution being , now , thoroughly awakened , however , he was never absent from the house one night ; and his eagerness for some termination , good or bad , to the old man ' s disorder , increasing rapidly , as the time passed by , soon began to vent itself in open murmurs
It was a service of some months ' duration , when early one morning , <NAME> opened the garden gate to Mr Dombey , who was come to breakfast with his master , by appointment .
Pressure came on , and you were done for !
' I am glad to hear it , ' said Mr Podsnap with a portentous air .
Upon that there stool , at that there <NAME> , sets that there boy of mine , brought up and growed up to be a man , wot will errand you , message you , general-light-job you , till your heels is where your head is , if such should be your wishes .
All that I had heard and seen , and a great part of what he had said himself , led me to suppose that he was a wealthy man .
I ask myself , ' said <NAME> , musing , ' does the real culprit know of these accusations ?
Yes , he might and must ; Mr <NAME> insisted on it .
I don ' t quite follow you , but it ' s natural I suppose that <NAME> should prefer to be outside , and even that you often should , too .
He was patient , and quiet ; often sat brooding , but not despondently , for a long space ; was easily amused , even by a sun-beam on the wall or ceiling ; made no complaint that the days were long , or the nights tedious ; and appeared indeed to have lost all count of time ,
<NAME> would withdraw the expression he had just made use of .
<NAME> <NAME> shook his head , and motioning them all out of the room , embraced his wife and children , and having pressed them by turns to his languidly beating heart , sunk exhausted on his pillow .
To tamper with a fellow like this , who would sell his soul ( if he had one ) for drink , and whose every word is a lie .
How that word would have struck to my heart , many years ago !
' If you are , <NAME> , you will at once leave the room , ' said the lady .
I ' ll give you one , in default of a better. ' ' Bravo ! ' said <NAME> .
' Go along with you ! ' cried my aunt , shaking her head and her fist at the window .
Though it may be , <NAME> , that there is a history so interesting and affecting even to minds as near the brutes as thine , recording deeds done on this earth for common men , that if the Chadbands , removing their own persons from the light , would but show it thee in simple reverence , would
<NAME> <NAME> stopped to take a draught of spirits and water , and to declare that the gin was excellent ; then placing his feet against the low mantelpiece , so as to bring his boots to about the level of his eye , he quietly resumed .
The remark may possibly apply to injuries received in other kinds of violent excitement : certain it is , that although <NAME> experienced some pain on first awakening next morning , he sprung out of bed as the clock struck seven , with very little difficulty , and was soon as much on the alert as if nothing had
It came to an end , and I was relieved .
I know from his lips that when that person soon afterwards died , he suspected <NAME> of visiting his wretched lodging and his wretched grave , alone and in secret .
This posture of affairs Mr <NAME> observed through the glass-door as he was turning the handle , and seeing that the notary recognised him , he began to shake his head and sigh deeply while that partition yet divided them .
Now , in the old days at home , certain audacious doubts respecting the last of the <NAME> , which were afloat in the air , had , by some forgotten means , come in contact with <NAME> ' s sensorium .
He couldn ' t have thrown a word at a mad dog .
I should n't be expected there , if I did ; the beadle 's too gen-teel for me .
Thousands of people were wildly staring about for somebody alive to heap reproaches on ; and this notable case , courting publicity , set the living somebody so much wanted , on a scaffold .
Several people were at work here ; making brushes , mattresses , and so forth ; and the cheerfulness , industry , and good order discernible in every other part of the building , extended to this department also .
We found the ship in the river , surrounded by a crowd of boats ; a favourable wind blowing ; the signal for sailing at her mast-head .
<NAME> dropped the letter on the same spot again , pressed it with his foot to prevent its fluttering away , regained his seat in a single stride , and looked as vacant and unconscious as ever mortal looked .
' But of this I am determined , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> ; ' that if I were to stop in this house for six months , I would never trust myself about it , alone , again. ' ' That ' s the wery prudentest resolution as you could come to , <NAME> , ' replied <NAME>
What the devil has he done with it , that ' s the mystery ! ' This reflection set him scratching his head and biting his nails once more .
<NAME> even spelt it over a second time , letter by letter , as if he thought that the omission of a dot or scratch would lead to his destruction .
His face was a talisman to the porters and servants of his more dashing clients , and procured him ready admission , though he trudged on foot , and others , who were denied , rattled to the door in carriages .
Indeed I am quite happy ! ' His father coming and bending down to him -- which he did quickly , and without first pausing by the bedside -- <NAME> held him round the neck , and repeated those words to him several times , and very earnestly ; and <NAME> never saw him in his room again at
She had reserved this last evening for her father , and they sat alone under the plane-tree .
Come and see. ' <NAME> followed him down a narrow entry , at the end of which a key was turned , and a strong door was opened from within .
We went into the drawing-room , to leave her with the Doctor and her mother ; but she said , it seemed , that she was better than she had been since morning , and that she would rather be brought among us ; so they brought her in , looking very white and weak , I thought ,
Do you know he is a convict , a felon , a common thief ? ' ' Hear what he has to tell you .
A stiff commissariat officer of sixty , famous as a martinet , had then become enamoured of the gravity with which she drove the proprieties four-in-hand through the cathedral town society , and had solicited to be taken beside her on the box of the cool coach of ceremony to which that team was harnessed .
One circumstance troubled Mr <NAME> ' s mind very much , and that was that the small servant always remained somewhere in the bowels of the earth under <NAME> , and never came to the surface unless the single gentleman rang his bell , when she would answer it and immediately disappear again .
He appeared to entertain a belief that the interview at which he had assisted was so very satisfactory and encouraging , as to be only a step or two removed from a regular betrothal of <NAME> to <NAME> ; and that the late transaction had immensely forwarded , if not thoroughly established , the <NAME> hopes .
' Splendid morning , gentlemen , ' said <NAME> .
<NAME> -- <NAME> of the <NAME> , <NAME> .
All you have to do is , to keep back the truth .
I never thought before , that there was a woman in the world who could affect me so much by saying so little .
Though perfectly familiar with them , my conduct and manner were different enough from theirs to place a space between us .
' I ha ' fell into th ' pit , my dear , as have cost wi ' in the knowledge o ' old fok now livin , hundreds and hundreds o ' men ' s lives—fathers , sons , brothers , dear to thousands an ' thousands , an ' keeping ' em fro ' want and hunger
It lightened too , for three whole hours ; each flash being very bright , and blue , and long ; and as the vivid streaks came darting in among the crowded branches , and the thunder rolled gloomily above the tree tops , one could scarcely help thinking that there were better neighbourhoods at such a time than
Keep a good heart , sir ! ' said Mrs. Crupp , nodding encouragement .
' You are nothing better than a sphinx !
The morning among the trees .
" Yes , " I replied , " and his name is Provis -- from <NAME> Wales. " Even <NAME> started when I said those words .
You know what you are here for ?
Upon his knees <NAME> gave him this pledge , and promised again that he should rest in the spot he had pointed out .
' To be sure , ' said <NAME> , -- ' that this wine has passed through .
Regularly executed , regularly witnessed , very short .
These conditions being arranged , he was removed one evening to his new abode , and enjoyed , in common with nine other gentlemen , and two ladies , the privilege of being taken to his place of retirement in one of <NAME> ' s own carriages .
But is it good taste , is it good taste ?
' Take a seat by the fire , ' were her hospitable words when she had got him in ; ' men of your calling are always welcome here. ' ' Thankee , ' said the man .
When she saw me coming in at the door , she called me back and said did I live here .
Though I never could have been so rude , no , no !
Not mind him ? ' ' I don ' t mean that , ' said <NAME> , with a worried look , ' but I mean , don ' t believe him to be anything but good and generous , <NAME> , because he is the best of men .
So I said to myself , " <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> !
" Every -- my lit -- " " I should be glad , " says Mrs. Snagsby after contemplating his increased confusion with a severe and sinister smile , " if you would come home with me ; I think you may be safer there , <NAME> , than anywhere else . "
I told the <NAME> that if he offered to clean my boots , I ' d stretch him a Corpse before me ! ' All these indications of a disordered mind were verified in Mr Toots ' s appearance , which was wild and savage .
You can ' t decline to hear , you know , as well as to answer .
' No , no , ' said <NAME> , laying aside the poker , and looking very cunning ; ' I didn ' t think <NAME> ' s exactly the place for a headstrong girl ; so , as I am her natural protector and guardian , our parents being dead , I have brought her down into this
Why , here he still is , right leg foremost , hard at work upon the hackney coaches , and more on the alert than ever , being newly painted from his cocked hat to his buckled shoes ; and up above him , in golden characters , these names Not another stroke of business does the <NAME> achieve
Top couple , too ; with a good stiff piece of work cut out for them ; three or four and twenty pair of partners ; people who were not to be trifled with ; people who would dance , and had no notion of walking .
The same love of gain which led him to contract this marriage , led to its being kept strictly private ; for a clause in her father ' s will declared that if she married without her brother ' s consent , the property , in which she had only some life interest while she remained single , should
It was almost ten o ' clock before we heard the sound of wheels .
" Well , sir ! " <NAME> went on ; " it happened -- happened , do n't you see ? -- that this woman was so very artfully dressed from the time of her apprehension , that she looked much slighter than she really was ; in particular , her sleeves are always remembered to have been so
He never leaves off making queer faces , and is the delight of all the rest , who grin from ear to ear incessantly .
That 's what he and I agreed . "
' What does he mean by that ? ' ' I don ' t think he means it impertinently at all , ' replied Mrs. Nickleby .
" Unless you call <NAME> a he .
' I can understand how you have frightened that little donkey , <NAME> , the most estimable of moon-calves ( I really love him ) nearly out of his wits .
Upon this , I walked in , and in pursuance of the servant ' s directions walked upstairs ; conscious , as I passed the back parlour-door , that I was surveyed by a mysterious eye , probably belonging to the mysterious voice .
My dear boy , they are always the same. ' ' But there ' s no process out against you .
<NAME> had seen her father ' s look towards her , and she knew whose look it had no likeness to .
The wind began to moan in hollow murmurs , as the sun went down carrying glad day elsewhere ; and a train of dull clouds coming up against it , menaced thunder and lightning .
' Now , good people all , ' said he , ' this is wanton waste of time .
Dear Mr Toots , I am so rejoiced to see you ! ' ' <NAME> , ' said Mr Toots , ' I am pretty well , I ' m much obliged to you , <NAME> .
I say it advisedly ; there ' s a vast deal of courage in it .
His countenance had resumed its usual benign expression , ere he concluded .
It can ' t be kept too quiet. ' ' One , two -- hum -- five , six .
It was ruffled next moment , to be sure , by a doubt of <NAME> ' s giving her consent ; but even that was set at rest soon , for she came out to take an evening grope in the store-closet while we were yet in conversation , and <NAME> , with a boldness that amazed me ,
It was then that <NAME> presented himself at the pony ' s head , and touched his hat with a smile .
The message was no sooner whispered in his ear than he thrust them in his pocket among various professional documents , and hurried over the way with such alacrity that he reached the parlour before the messenger had even emancipated himself from the court .
Turning these things over in my mind I deemed it possible that my aunt , who could know nothing of me , might suspect I had a habit of running away , and took precautions , on that account , to have me in safe keeping .
Now see if we don ' t pay you out for that , sir !
He is now something under fifteen and an old limb of the law .
Coals is either _by_ the fire , or _per_ the scuttle. ' She emphasised the prepositions as marking a subtle but immense difference .
I would the bleeding foot that brought me here to-day , had rotted off , before it led me to your house ! ' <NAME> , pale and trembling , restrained her brother , and suffered her to go on uninterrupted .
And as Mr Carker again echoed the words , and also collected his papers as if he were going away too , <NAME> felt that his lingering any longer would be an unpardonable intrusion -- especially as he had nothing to say -- and therefore walked out quite confounded .
His excited feelings might have found some further painful utterance , but for a knock at the door , which had been already twice repeated , and to which <NAME> ( still wishing herself dead , and indeed now going so far as to add , buried ) cried ' Come in ! ' ' Ah , <NAME> !
" <NAME> has been so kind , " proceeds <NAME> with a respectful glance and a bow that way , " as to place near her a young beauty of the name of <NAME> .
" Now , I tell you , miss , " said Mrs. <NAME> ; " and when I say miss , I mean all !
May I ask you -- in no impertinent curiosity , but because I have had so much pleasure in your society , may never in this labyrinth of a world exchange a quiet word with you again , and wish to preserve an accurate remembrance of you and yours -- may I ask you , if I have not
' Mr Fledgeby , ' said <NAME> , giving him a very gracious reception , ' so glad to see you !
Among such objects rides the trooper , looking about him and always looking for something he has come to find .
But as he leaned over the back of the chair for a considerable time , and closing one eye , winked a good deal with the other , it is presumed that he thought all this , but kept it to himself .
As to <NAME> and <NAME> , they still remain in their old posts , although the former is bald , and the last-named boy quite grey .
It ain ' t o ' no use to me , ' said the <NAME> .
' We may hide behind the bush and beat about it , but we DO !
I think he knows it , though he pretends he don ' t .
" But did you say 'told ' or 'informed ' ? " he asked me , with his head on one side , and not looking at me , but looking in a listening way at the floor .
I -- in short , ' said <NAME> , with the same genteel air , and in another burst of confidence -- ' I live there. ' I made him a bow .
" I had forgotten that , <NAME> , but I remember it now you speak of it. " " Well !
It was difficult , after this , to explain what I meant ; but I persisted so far as to say that we all hoped he would check and not confirm <NAME> in the sanguine views he entertained just then .
'We 'll see wot the Secretary of State for the <NAME> has got to say to the beaks , if I do n't , ' replied <NAME> .
' Are you ? ' said <NAME> .
I was more than ever frightened of myself , thinking anew of her against whom I was a witness , of the owner of <NAME> , of the new and terrible meaning of the old words now moaning in my ear like a surge upon the shore , " Your mother , <NAME> , was your disgrace , and
Well , sir , I think I should have known you , if I had taken the liberty of looking more closely at you .
Waking , what rest have I , constantly haunted by this heavy shadow of -- I know not what -- which is its worst character ?
How could I remember , then , the night when I first saw you , and when I went out of the room because you looked at me so attentively ?
Our tears were not for the trials ( hers so much the greater ) through which we had come to be thus , but for the rapture of being thus , never to be divided more !
A walk to <NAME> ' headquarters , and you can know what you will . "
He is the husband of my affections , ' cried Mrs. Micawber , struggling ; ' and I ne -- ver -- will -- desert <NAME> ! ' <NAME> was so deeply affected by this proof of her devotion ( as to me , I was dissolved in tears ) , that he hung over her in a passionate
' The fact is , I am not their father , <NAME> .
' <NAME> , <NAME> , good tender-hearted Quilp , ' said the old man , drawing some scraps of paper from his pocket with a trembling hand , and clasping the dwarf ' s arm , ' only see here .
When the tea-table was done with , they all moved to one of the windows , and looked out into the heavy twilight .
' I have been hasty , too , ' said he .
' Mrs Merdle ' s maid must be called , and told to get <NAME> up , and prepare her as gently as she can to see me .
Now , if you ' ll show a light , I ' ll come to your office-room and dispose of a letter or two. ' On that clear , generous face of Mrs <NAME> ' s , <NAME> had seen such traces of a pang at the heart while this dialogue was being held , that she had not
I was but a servant and a minister .
The child left her gathering the flowers that grew upon the grave , and thoughtfully retraced her steps .
Drownded , ain ' t he ? ' after which he withdrew , and turning in again , slept till seven o ' clock .
I was quite resolved to keep it , but I sat down for a little while first to reflect upon all my blessings .
" Why , I never heard of such a thing !
Therefore , you know it was not likely , ' said Mr Toots , ' that I should take his opinion. ' ' No , ' said Mr Feeder .
He was apprehended -- committed -- tried -- condemned -- to die .
On no fewer than four occasions the police were called in to receive denunciations of Mr Meagles as a Knight of <NAME> , a good-for-nothing , and a thief , all of which opprobrious language he bore with the best temper ( having no idea what it meant ) , and was in the most ignominious manner escorted to
But I can not , and I revolt from the pretence .
We stood so , a long time ; long enough for me to see the white marks of my fingers die out of the deep red of his cheek , and leave it a deeper red .
' And do it at once. ' The waiter immediately withdrew to make the exchange .
<NAME> <NAME> was so completely lost in musing on these similarities and dissimilarities , at the same time watching the crowd which came and went by , always , as it seemed , on errands of antagonistically snatching something from somebody , and never giving anything to anybody , that his name was called before he heard it .
<NAME> , in the then disturbed state of public feeling ( for it was half-holiday , and the boys had not yet gone home ) , as resolutely protested against walking on the opposite side of the way , and taking <NAME> ' s parole that he would go straight to the magistrate ' s ; and both <NAME>
" And where the deuce ha ' you been ? " was Mrs. <NAME> 's Christmas salutation , when I and my conscience showed ourselves .
' <NAME> , hush , my own dear !
I could very easily be wrong on any other subject , but not on this , not on this ! ' With a quiet and tender hand she put aside a straying fold of the sleeper ' s hair , and then touched the hand that lay outside the covering .
But <NAME> who was personally disposed in favour of the excursion , and who ( like <NAME> ) , if she could bear the disappointments of other people with tolerable fortitude , could not abide to disappoint herself , threw so many ingenious doubts in the way of this second thought , and stimulated the original intention with so
They danced to the popular Revolution song , keeping a ferocious time that was like a gnashing of teeth in unison .
The gauzy little bridesmaids appeared to suffer most .
" Twice , he put his hand to the wound in his breast , and with his forefinger drew a cross in the air .
You will excuse this extreme haste , but circumstances require that I should immediately remove my sister , and I have not a moment ' s time to lose .
<NAME> , notwithstanding his reputation in the firm , was an easy-going , incapable sort of man , whose reputation out of doors was not calculated to back it up .
There was a smile upon the youth ' s face as he advanced .
You wouldn ' t have thought of saying such mischief if you hadn ' t been a horse-rider ? ' ' Her calling seems to be pretty well known among ' em , ' observed <NAME> .
When her sister had withdrawn , she turned her head back again , and lay with her face towards the door , until it opened and her father entered .
She was too well acquainted with his jealous temperament to venture the slightest allusion to the real cause of her agitation on beholding <NAME> ; and she trusted to her own influence and power of persuasion with the little man , to quell his boisterous jealousy , supposing that <NAME> were removed , and no fresh quarrel could arise
There was a general start .
And between every syllable , <NAME> gave <NAME> a blow with all her might : accompanying it with a scream , for the benefit of society .
<NAME> ' s handiwork never was disguised with such extraordinary artificial carving , as the man had overlaid his countenance with in one moment .
' And in the matter of fact besides , ' interrupted <NAME> .
There , and through it all , my dear physician was a hero .
' Now , scoundrel , ' he pursued , ' I am going to finish .
' But there are many places of shelter near here .
' They are rather dark , sir , but you will not find anything in the way. ' He paused for a moment before opening a door on the second story .
He was too penitent , too remorseful .
<NAME> <NAME> was no sooner left alone , than he set the office-door wide open , and establishing himself at his desk directly opposite , so that he could not fail to see anybody who came down-stairs and passed out at the street door , began to write with extreme cheerfulness and assiduity ; humming as he did so
He turned the dialogue to that point , and thanked him for it .
We left home directly after breakfast to be at <NAME> in good time and walked down there through the lively streets -- so happily and strangely it seemed ! -- together .
" Boy , " said <NAME> , " it is well that your sainted mother is spared this pang .
' Only papers. ' Here the girl arose with her work in her hand , and went out at the door .
I was interested , but not curious .
And here is Conversation Kenge .
That was written , " said my companion , " when she rested there .
It had never been a good eye to see with -- had long had the mote in it of <NAME> 's pride , <NAME> 's luxury , and a mole 's blindness -- but it had dropped out and was gone .
' I want to go a little more into buying-up queer bills .
This gentleman sat on the left hand of <NAME> , to whom he was introduced by his friend the <NAME> , from the bottom of the table , with a high eulogium upon his fame and reputation .
<NAME> as it was , I heard it fall like a plummet .
If the tread is an echo , it is an echo that is only heard after dark , and is often unheard for a long while together .
It was poisonous to me to see him in the town , for I very well knew why he had come there .
Here is the parade , always at your service .
Only for one moment. ' ' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' will you take my aunt into the surgery ? ' ' <NAME> , ' responded <NAME> , in a most professional voice .
She was alone , in her brilliant dress , and had but that moment come from her mother ' s room .
' It ' s not a bad situation , ' said I , ' and the rooms are really commodious. ' ' I hope you have both brought appetites with you ? ' said <NAME> .
The shadow of a large high-roofed house , and of many over-hanging trees , was upon Monsieur the Marquis by that time ; and the shadow was exchanged for the light of a flambeau , as his carriage stopped , and the great door of his chateau was opened to him .
It ' s hopeless on his part , certainly ; but why he should be an absurd old idiot , I confess I don ' t see .
' No , sir , ' he replied ; ' probably not very long , sir. ' ' He can hardly say , just now , ' observed <NAME> , carelessly .
That 's what 's the matter with me .
Blessed Sunday Bells , ringing so tranquilly in their entranced and happy ears !
' Ah—h ! ' said Mrs. Sparsit , shaking her head over her tea-cup , and taking a long gulp .
' You have heard me ? ' <NAME> said , ' Yes , Sir. ' ' Perhaps you understand , ' pursued his patron , ' that if you ever deceive or play tricks with me , you had better have drowned yourself , indeed , once for all , before you came here ? ' There was nothing
' You look quite juvenile and jolly , demmit ! ' ' We are alone , ' returned <NAME> , tartly .
The slate comes into requisition again , but the word he wants to write he can not remember .
tittered the matron , parrying the question .
" First , notwithstanding the proverb that constant dropping will wear away a stone , you may set your mind at rest that these people never will -- never would , in hundred years -- impair your ground with <NAME> , in any particular , great or small .
But isn ' t it rather injudicious , sir -- ? ' ' What ? ' demanded <NAME> .
He said , <NAME> at the world , there was good and evil in that ; look at the ecclesiastical law , there was good and evil in THAT .

<NAME> sat waiting in a corner .
At first , this was so much more unlike her old experience than even the mountains themselves , that she had been unable to resign herself to it , and had tried to retain her old place about him .
That foxey old grunter and grinder , sir , turns into the yard this morning , to meddle with our property , a menial tool of his own , a young man by the name of <NAME> .
In your heart you can not mean it .
' Ye be noice chaps , ' said <NAME> , looking steadily round .
<NAME> <NAME> met the lifted eyebrows and forehead with a cold , impassive stare .
said the man whose duty it was to conduct them .
Oh do do do say somebody else !
' You know I ' m never quite what I could wish to be , now .
Who in their agreeable manner did homage to <NAME> as if she were a compound of fine girl , thorough-bred horse , well-built drag , and remarkable pipe .
He wore his hat , which was of a brownish-white , and had beside him a thick knotted stick .
<NAME> , mentally perambulating among paths of peace , was altogether swallowed up in absence of mind .
My dear guardian , I believe I am the happiest creature in the world ! "
I am to have a carriage , and you are to take me .
It was <NAME> ' s lot to wait upon both kinds of change .
I want to speak to you. ' But <NAME> wouldn ' t come to <NAME> , so <NAME> was obliged to go to <NAME> , which she did , in a skipping manner that was quite fascinating ; and <NAME> evidently joked <NAME> about being struck with <NAME> ; for , after some playful whispering , <NAME> hit <NAME>
Let me hear it stated .
I never meant it to be known to anyone .
The two had not been together five minutes , and the peculiar manner seemed to convey to them , ' You were going to talk about me .
It sounded far more forcibly , because of the change in the speaker for the moment ; the passing appearance of earnestness , complete conviction , injured resentment of suspicion , generous and unselfish interest .
Here <NAME> , who was sitting in a corner by the door , good-naturedly offered such consolation as he could administer .
The ribbon ' s round my little <NAME> ' s neck now .
I am in the humour to tell her so to-night , <NAME> , and I ' ll stay at home and do it. ' ' You are tired. ' ' Not at all tired , <NAME> dear , but in the humour to write to <NAME> .
Not unmindful of the risk she ran , however , the <NAME> no sooner left the house than she dived into the first dark by-way that presented itself , and , without any present reference to the point to which her journey tended , made it her first business to put two good miles of brick and mortar between
But never mind me ; ' tis concerning Sloppy. ' ' And what about him , <NAME> ? ' ' ' Tis just this , sir .
He was taken to the <NAME> Court next day , and would have been immediately committed for trial , but that it was necessary to send down for an old officer of the prison-ship from which he had once escaped , to speak to his identity .
' I hope it ' s enough , child , ' said my aunt .
A plan had occurred to me for passing the night , which I was going to carry into execution .
The better to support his assumed character he had determined to be greatly overcome , and , consequently , when they entered the church , the sobs of the affectionate parent were so heart-rending that the pew-opener suggested the propriety of his retiring to the vestry , and comforting himself with a glass of water before the ceremony began
A shocking thing hunger , isn ' t it , <NAME> ? ' ' Very shocking , sir , ' said <NAME> .
' What ? ' said the old man .
' Is my brother in his room , <NAME> ? ' said <NAME> , with no less kindness of manner than he had shown to <NAME> .
' I wouldn ' t stand in the dear child ' s light , not if I had all my life before me instead of a very little of it .
It made a visible impression at once ; and <NAME> followed up his advantage by kissing his mother-in-law .
<NAME> ' t you think that any secret course is an unworthy one ? ' ' Yes .
Having adopted in its place a dirty cotton nightcap , and groped about in the dark till he found a remnant of candle , he knocked at the partition which divided the two garrets , and inquired , in a loud voice , whether <NAME> had a light .
But I live a busy life , and I speak under correction by you readers , who ought to know everything , and I daresay do. ' By this time they had both become savage ; <NAME> out in the open ; <NAME> under the transparent cover of a popular tune , and a stop now and then to

<NAME> thing ! ' Acting upon this grave consideration she rejected the idea of taking the little portrait painter into her confidence , and contented herself with holding out sundry vague and mysterious hopes of preferment to the servant girl , who received these obscure hints of dawning greatness with much veneration and respect .
' Well , I never did -- ' ' This , then , my lord , ' said <NAME> , ' is the lady to whose obliging marriage we owe so much happiness .
" In the north as we came down , sir . "
' <NAME> does the mince-pies go , young opium-eater ? ' said <NAME> to the fat boy , as he assisted in laying out such articles of consumption as had not been duly arranged on the previous night .
This practical authority confused me very much by saying I had the arm of a blacksmith .
<NAME> ' t betray me ! " Those were the words as ever he used. ' There was a silence , broken only by the fall of the ashes in the grate .
There is no vengeance and no infliction of suffering in His life , I am sure .
Then I ' ll work for you. ' Veneering instantly blesses him , and apprises him that <NAME> is already working .
' What nimble fingers you have , ' said <NAME> , ' but are you sure you are well ? ' ' Oh yes , indeed ! ' <NAME> put her feet upon the fender , and settled herself for a thorough good romantic disclosure .
' He was your uncle , I think ? ' ' <NAME> , no ; only a friend of my uncle ' s , ' replied the one-eyed man .
' Good-bye ! ' ' <NAME> , ' whispered <NAME> , looking cautiously round ; ' my duty to your gov ' nor , and tell him if he thinks better o ' this here bis ' ness , to com-moonicate vith me .
And your books too , " turning his eyes round the room , " mounting up , on their shelves , by hundreds !
It was somehow understood , as a secret article in the state proprieties of <NAME> that nothing must be said about the day .
<NAME> has grown up in a sense of the importance of these arrangements , and you know what a good girl she is. ' The brother only sighed again , as he plodded dreamily along , ' Hah !
<NAME> <NAME> 's knife , in particular , which is of the oyster kind , with the additional feature of a strong shutting-up movement which frequently balks the appetite of that young musician , is mentioned as having gone in various hands the complete round of foreign service .
She was so true , she was so beautiful , she was so good , -- I owed her so much gratitude , she was so dear to me , that I could find no utterance for what I felt .
<NAME> ! ' ( <NAME> taps on the head with a stick , and the fat boy , with some difficulty , roused from his lethargy . )
There 's not a doubt of the dress by this time , and the dress has been seen here . "
The air , at that elevation , was quite cool and refreshing , when in the city it was burning hot .
He did so shortly and distinctly .
From the windows of my room I saw all <NAME> lying in the distance like a great vapour , with here and there some lights twinkling through it .
' Are you , though ? ' replied the person to whom the assurance was pledged .
and in a moment afterwards , there she was again , actually clapping her little hands for joy , as she dragged him through the small door of her small cabin , to look at the baby as he lay asleep !
<NAME> <NAME> tasted the medicine with a doubtful look ; smacked his lips ; took another taste ; and put the cup down empty .
From mere force of habit , <NAME> in saying " My friends ! "
You hear nothing , you do n't , ' retorted <NAME> with a fierce sneer .
' Present , ' repeats <NAME> , feeling that it is a neat point which will bear repetition , -- ' with one who -- that is to say , with a man , at whom the finger of scorn can never -- in fact , with my honourable friend <NAME> , if he will allow me to call
We seem to be appropriating <NAME> ' s residence so very coolly. ' ' I protest to you , ' returned that gentleman , ' that I shall think the better of it for evermore , if your voice sounds in it only once. ' <NAME> , not quite knowing what to say about that , cast down her
A waste , a waste , a waste , my Twemlow ! ' And so drops asleep , and has galvanic starts all over him .
<NAME> <NAME> to himself , <NAME> ' am .
I can do nothing but denounce that. ' ' I never offend you wilfully , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' though you are so hard with me. ' ' Then you should be more careful , <NAME> , ' returned her sister .
' Do you happen to know , <NAME> , ' Affery ' s liege lord then demanded in a much lower voice , and with an amount of expression that seemed quite out of proportion to the simple purpose of his words , ' where she lives ? ' ' No. ' ' Would you -- now , would
' Some bothering law business , ' replied <NAME> , scratching his head , ' connected with an action , for what they call neglect of a boy .
It was quite a wilderness , and there were old melon-frames and cucumber-frames in it , which seemed in their decline to have produced a spontaneous growth of weak attempts at pieces of old hats and boots , with now and then a weedy offshoot into the likeness of a battered saucepan .
' Well , my little sister , ' said <NAME> with a sigh , ' I suppose you know what this means ? ' ' She ' s as beautiful as she ' s doated on , ' stammered Mr Sparkler -- ' and there ' s no nonsense about her -- it ' s arranged -- ' '
The cherubic pocket-knife , with the first bit of the loaf still on its point , lay beside them where it had been hastily thrown down .
<NAME> ' a good breath noo -- Squeers be in jail -- the school ' s brokken oop -- it ' s a ' ower -- past and gane -- think o ' thot , and let it be a hearty ' un !
' <NAME> way ? ' asked <NAME> , wistfully .
We came from a quiet part .
It appeared to <NAME> and her two companions that a considerable time had been thus occupied .
There came , when they were about midway on their journey , a heavy rush of hail , which in a few minutes pelted the streets clear , and whitened them .
The more I spoke to him , the more he hid his face ; and at first he shook all over , and said nothing but " My darling ; " and " My love ! " ' Here <NAME> came lounging in , and stared at the two with a coolness not particularly savouring of interest in anything
<NAME> that humiliation to be put upon him by his own blood ?
'This is all mighty fine , ' said <NAME> ( to retain his assumed designation ) after a long silence , during which he had jerked himself in sullen defiance to and fro , and <NAME> had sat , shading his face with his hand .
She kept her word -- perhaps she had never been away -- but the next thing that happened was a noise of footsteps on the stairs , and then <NAME> woke -- woke mind and body -- and sat upright in his bed .
Those lines and stays shall be rigged before you turn out in the morning .
<NAME> and steam , and smoke , and red light ; a hiss , a crash , a bell , and a shriek ; <NAME> put into one carriage , Mrs. <NAME> put into another : the little station a desert speck in the thunderstorm .
But it ' s not to be burnt on a Sunday night .
' Do I never read in the newspapers , ' said the dame , fondling the child -- ' God help me and the like of me ! -- how the worn-out people that do come down to that , get driven from post to pillar and pillar to post , a-purpose to tire them out !
'Now , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> with a laugh .
Take the key. ' ' Why don ' t you hit one of your size ? ' said the boy approaching very slowly .
' Come on ! ' cried <NAME> ; and without further invitation he gave the <NAME> <NAME> a preliminary tap on the head , and began dancing round him in a buoyant and cork-like manner , which in a gentleman at his time of life was a perfect marvel to behold .
And thus ever by day and night , under the sun and under the stars , climbing the dusty hills and toiling along the weary plains , journeying by land and journeying by sea , coming and going so strangely , to meet and to act and react on one another , move all we restless travellers through the
' Gentlemen , there is an old story -- none the worse for being true -- regarding a fine young <NAME> gentleman , who being asked if he could play the fiddle , replied he had no doubt he could , but he couldn ' t exactly say , for certain , because he had never tried .
<NAME> and his sister made pies of a dead sheep they found when they were out a walking .
' You ' ll be so glad to hear , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' that that cross <NAME> is not here .
Even now the floor is dusky , and shadow slowly mounts the walls , bringing the <NAME> down like age and death .
The sluggish darkness thickened as the day came on ; and those who had the courage to rise and peep at the gloomy street from their curtained windows , crept back to bed again , and coiled themselves up to sleep .
Even when I did get through the morning with tolerable credit , there was not much gained but dinner ; for <NAME> never could endure to see me untasked , and if I rashly made any show of being unemployed , called her brother ' s attention to me by saying , ' Clara , my dear , there
' Pa , dear ! ' cried <NAME> , beckoning him with her parasol to approach the side , and bending gracefully to whisper .
Did you tell her where I had seen her ?
' Is he afraid of me ? ' he muttered , knocking .
The old man looked about him with a startled and bewildered gaze , for these were places that he hoped to shun .
Let us see , " mademoiselle assents , with many angry and tight nods of her head .
You have compromised me by being seen about with me , endeavouring to counteract this Mr <NAME> .
' Even here , ' he went on in the same way , ' even in this mean drinking-shop , society pursues me .
The painted room in which she awoke , often a humbled state-chamber in a dilapidated palace , would begin it ; with its wild red autumnal vine-leaves overhanging the glass , its orange-trees on the cracked white terrace outside the window , a group of monks and peasants in the little street below , misery and magnificence wrestling with
<NAME> <NAME> saw , with delight , that this tribute to his powers was no mere compliment , but that he had really impressed his recruit with a sense of his wily genius , which it was most important that he should entertain in the outset of their acquaintance .
After I have heard you myself , when the whole of my right side has been benumbed , going on with your master about combustion , and calcination , and calorification , and I may say every kind of ation that could drive a poor invalid distracted , to hear you talking in this absurd way about sparks and
' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> ; ' but why not now ? ' ' I ' d rayther not now , sir , ' rejoined <NAME> .
The lodger , in the testiness of being so rudely roused , had pushed his nightcap very much on one side of his bald head .
Perhaps , if I had thought twice about it , I might never have given her the jingling name .
" Have many people been kind to the children ? "
He remembered what a cosmopolitan gentleman <NAME> was , and how few weak distinctions he made .
'Yer a sharp feller , ' said <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> , as I have said , resumed : ' You ask permission of my sister <NAME> and myself , <NAME> , to visit here , as the accepted suitor of our niece. ' ' If our brother <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , breaking out again , if I may call anything so calm a breaking out
That I got them off , closed with her , threw her down , and got them over her ; that I dragged the great cloth from the table for the same purpose , and with it dragged down the heap of rottenness in the midst , and all the ugly things that sheltered there ; that we were
He don ' t want me ! ' The little altercation between them had attracted the notice of Mr Dombey , who inquired from the table where he was sitting at his wine , what the matter was .
And you doen ' t ought to watch and work both .
Who should be her favourite , who should anticipate this or that small present , or do her this or that small service ; who should take her home for the holidays ; who should write to her the oftenest when they were separated , and whom she would most rejoice to see again when they were reunited ;
The single gentleman , perhaps because he had met with such things in his travels , or perhaps because he WAS a single gentleman , evinced no surprise , but merely inquired ' Wife or sister ? ' -- ' Sister , ' said Dick. -- ' So much the better , ' said the single gentleman , '
" As a few fresh affidavits have been put upon the file , " says <NAME> , " and as they are short , and as I proceed upon the troublesome principle of begging leave to possess my clients with any new proceedings in a cause " -- cautious man <NAME> , taking no more responsibility than necessary --
It might be that it did , a little ; but the expression was so different , and the stern decision which had worn into my godmother 's face , like weather into rocks , was so completely wanting in the face before me that it could not be that resemblance which had struck me .
' Do you know how mama is , <NAME> ? ' I said .
She could not avoid the recollection of it , for her eyes were drawn towards him every now and then , by an attraction of dislike and distrust that she could not resist .
<NAME> , is it ? " " Yes , <NAME> Jaggers. " " And do you remember , " retorted <NAME> , " that but for me you would n't be here and could n't be here ? " " O yes , sir ! " exclaimed both women together .
The surprise and its consequences would have been much less disagreeable to me if he had not been penitent .
One Saturday night , a little , thin , old gen ' l ' m ' n comes into the shop in a great passion and says , " Are you the missis o ' this here shop ? " " Yes , I am , " says she .
' Mercy on the man , what ' s he doing ! ' cried my aunt , impatiently .
The deserted counting-houses , with their secrets of books and papers locked up in chests and safes ; the banking-houses , with their secrets of strong rooms and wells , the keys of which were in a very few secret pockets and a very few secret breasts ; the secrets of all the dispersed grinders in the vast mill
he was a precious fellow ' -- leaving the young man , who was all meekness and incapacity , affected even to tears by the incident .
' You know me better , ' said Mr Dombey .
says <NAME> , shaking his head and still composedly smoking .
Never been himself in this house since .
When she was half a dozen years younger , <NAME> had been overheard to begin a conversation with her brother one day , by saying ' Tom , I wonder ' —upon which <NAME> , who was the person overhearing , stepped forth into the light and said , ' Louisa , never wonder ! ' <NAME> lay the
' The ball seemed so thrown into my hands by accident !
All the young gentlemen , tightly cravatted , curled , and pumped , and with their best hats in their hands , having been at different times announced and introduced , Mr Baps , the dancing-master , came , accompanied by <NAME> , to whom Mrs Blimber was extremely kind and condescending .
' I liked to see it .
<NAME> hair , false colour , false calves , false muscles -- they had become different beings .
When he came to the corner of the court in which he lived , lo and behold there was the pony again !
' Not an atom , ' chimes in <NAME> .
' How do you do ? ' ' Wegg , you know , ' that gentleman explains .
They swam before him as he looked , like faces in an agitated glass ; and next moment he was in the dark coach outside , holding close to <NAME> .
' I am inclined to think you are. ' ' Why , then , ' replied the other , ' the good in this state of existence preponderates over the bad , let miscalled philosophers tell us what they will .
' Being alone in my eyes , I wish you good-evening with best wishes , and do not find myself drove , I am truly ' appy to say , into expressing my contempt for an indiwidual , unfortunately for yourself , belonging to you. ' The <NAME> gracefully withdrew with this parting speech , and from that time
" Do you know the name ? "
It ai n't that I am proud , but that I want to be right , as you shall never see me no more in these clothes .
I know that if a shilling were given me by <NAME> at any time , I spent it in a dinner or a tea .
<NAME> , come ; no more trifling .
Yes , certainly. ' ' You ' ll not give it up to any one but them ? ' ' No. ' ' As you must grow old in time , and come to your dying hour , my dear , you ' ll not give it up to any one but them ? ' ' No .
' <NAME> ' t you see ? ' said <NAME> .
If the male relations of <NAME> had put themselves forward openly , I should have known how to deal with them .
There is no change in my affection , admiration , and respect .
' Leave me , sir , pray , ' said the young lady .
' If your people don ' t know better than to go and help <NAME> , it ' s a pity they ever got out of <NAME> .
The next was written at another time : I have wandered a long distance , and for many hours , and I know that I must soon die .
' I can not wonder at his devotion ! ' I never saw such a beautiful colour on my mother ' s face before .
She went the way I had shown her .
They had been married ten years , and until this present day on which Mr <NAME> sat jingling and jingling his heavy gold watch-chain in the great arm-chair by the side of the bed , had had no issue .
It was an uncomfortable consideration on a twenty-first birthday , that coming of age at all seemed hardly worth while in such a guarded and suspicious world as he made of it .
I thankee , sir , most kind !
He always said what a curious thing it was that he should have found out , by such a mere accident as his clambering over the palings , that the ghosts of mail-coaches and horses , guards , coachmen , and passengers , were in the habit of making journeys regularly every night .
' Let us celebrate this happy meeting with a convivial glass , ' said he .
As to the attics , no one ever called on them ; if anybody wanted the parlours , they were close at hand , and all he had to do was to walk straight into them ; while the kitchen had a separate entrance down the area steps .
He approached the old seat ; it looked cold and desolate .
' Who ' s there ? ' screamed a numerous chorus of treble voices from the staircase inside , consisting of the spinster lady of the establishment , three teachers , five female servants , and thirty boarders , all half- dressed and in a forest of curl-papers .
In the Preface to <NAME> I remarked that I had never had so many readers .
I 'll show you up-stairs , if you please . "
' There is very little , ' returned <NAME> .
There was , then , a great deal of whispering , during which <NAME> appeared to make reference , more than once , to certain debts incurred by <NAME> previous to her coverture ; and also to an unexpected outlay of money in payment of the aforesaid debts ; and furthermore , to certain agreeable weaknesses on that gentleman
He dismissed us pleasantly , and we all went out , very much obliged to him for being so affable and polite , by which he had certainly lost no dignity but seemed to us to have gained some .
Therefore I am glad to take this slight occasion -- this trifling occasion , that is so replete with <NAME> , and your individual characters , and all that -- so truly calculated to bring the tears into a parent ' s eyes -- to say that I attach no importance to them in the least , except as
" You must taste , " said my sister , addressing the guests with her best grace -- " you must taste , to finish with , such a delightful and delicious present of <NAME> 's ! " Must they !
Drinking-tents were full , glasses began to clink in carriages , hampers to be unpacked , tempting provisions to be set forth , knives and forks to rattle , champagne corks to fly , eyes to brighten that were not dull before , and pickpockets to count their gains during the last heat .
If I recollect right , you told me -- ' ' Oh yes , <NAME> , yes certainly. ' ' A widow , I think ?
What you know of the story of my marriage , he soon knew , just as well. ' Her father ' s face was ashy white , and he held her in both his arms .
' But I have said enough for the present .
Thus <NAME> passed the night before her bridal .
' <NAME> ' t you , man ? ' ' I apprehend you never supposed my worldly circumstances to be very good , ' replied the assistant .
Agreed. ' ' We come smoothly to thirdly .
When all is quiet again , the lodger says , " It 's the appointed time at last .
' Yes , ' returned <NAME> ; ' and Mr Feeder will look you out some more very soon , if you are as studious as I expect you will be , Dombey. ' ' Thank you , <NAME> ' am , ' said <NAME> .
" I must think a moment .
That he might not be remiss in his part of the engagement , he resolved to wait full two hours , on this third and last night .
Let us hear no more of this , we pray you .
' Why , he is a sort of monkish attorney , ' replied <NAME> .
His wonderful enterprise , his wonderful wealth , his wonderful <NAME> , were the fattening food of the evening paper that night .
<NAME> , ' said <NAME> , addressing his young wife , ' is the best-humoured , the kindest and heartiest creature I ever saw .
There used , in that week , to come backward and forward to our lodging to fence with <NAME> a person who had formerly been a cavalry soldier ; he was a fine bluff-looking man , of a frank free bearing , with whom <NAME> had practised for some months .
Why need I speak of my father 's time , when it is equally yours ?
What can I say now , but <NAME> be wi ' thee , <NAME> bless thee , <NAME> thank thee and reward thee ! ' ' May it bless thee , <NAME> , too , in all thy wanderings , and send thee peace and rest at last ! ' ' I towd thee , my dear , '
What 's the odds where it comes from ?
said <NAME> , not quite following the stranger 's excited description .
Here , there was another hysterical laugh , which frightened <NAME> very much .
' Yes , every one , ' repeated <NAME> .
Well , <NAME> , I met her at a chapel that I go to ; a very neat little chapel in this town , <NAME> , where they sing the number four collection of hymns , which I generally carry about with me , in a little book , which you may perhaps have seen in my hand --
This corroborated the apprehensions I had formed , when he began to look at direction-posts , and to leave the carriage at cross roads for a quarter of an hour at a time while he explored them .
He had thought to leave the house -- knowing he must go , not knowing whither -- upon the evening of the day on which this feeling first struck root in his breast ; but he resolved to stay another night , and in the night to ramble through the rooms once more .
As time crept on , and there came gradually about him a group of lovely children , it was altered and enlarged ; but none of the old rooms were ever pulled down , no old tree was ever rooted up , nothing with which there was any association of bygone times was ever removed or changed .
As to <NAME> , the affection he conceived for him knew no limits .
Her sister he considered somewhat vain and proud , but a young lady of infinite accomplishments , who could not forget the past .
And not forget poor papa ? ' ' Yes , we will , and have some happy days .
I know it certainly , but I believe we have never wholly trusted each other . "
So cheerful , uncle , and so ready , and so interested. ' ' My dear child -- all you. ' ' All me , uncle ! ' ' Yes , yes .
At length the play came to an end , and Mr Isaac List rose the only winner .
So he whistles it off and marches on .
I am a physician and was requested -- five minutes ago -- to come and visit a sick man at <NAME> 's Shooting <NAME> . "
' Well , then , he won ' t , ' retorted <NAME> .
They were gone to bed at the log <NAME> , which was the only house of entertainment in the place , but soon answered to our knocking , and got some tea for us in a sort of kitchen or common room , tapestried with old newspapers , pasted against the wall .
I promise you ! ' In the act of turning his eyes gratefully towards his friend , he wandered away .
I went one day , when it happened that I could run round by myself , at four or five o ' clock in the afternoon .
" I am an old man , my dear <NAME> , and I need some attention .
I beg that you will NOT go on .
" I ask you pardon , " she mutters hurriedly .
We are hemmed into a corner .
This turmoil , instead of quickly subsiding after the first outburst , ( as turmoils not unfrequently do , whether in taverns , legislative assemblies , or elsewhere , ) into a mere grumbling and growling squabble , increased every moment ; and although the whole din appeared to be raised by but one pair of lungs , yet
asked the Jew , laying the same emphasis on the pronoun as before .
A thundering knock from the obnoxious foreigner anticipates the rush of Mr <NAME> and party to open it ; and Mr Dombey and his bride alight , and walk in arm in arm .
He had drawn nearer , at about the time when <NAME> mentioned <NAME> , and had remained near , since : though always glancing towards the door by which <NAME> had gone out .
She may thank her stars she was born a manager ' s daughter. ' ' You seem to take it to heart , ' observed <NAME> , with a smile .
Thus : — The time is one o ' clock at noon .
" My dear , " said <NAME> benignly to his son , " do you know the hour ? "
' Ha ! ' said <NAME> , ' no matter .
<NAME> <NAME> smiled , took a very long pinch of snuff , stirred the fire , shrugged his shoulders , and remained expressively silent .
And , by the <NAME> , I ' ll do it , if I am interrupted any farther ! ' Shouldering his heavy stick , and quickening his pace , he shot on to pass the four ahead .
In reference to these gentry , I may here quote a few words from the original preface to this book .
With all these stoppages , it was between five and six o'clock and we were yet a few miles short of <NAME> when he came out of one of these houses and handed me in a cup of tea .
Is your hand steady enough to write ? " " It was when you came in. " " Steady it again , and write what I shall dictate .
Every room above , and every cask in the wine-merchant 's cellars below , appeared to have a separate peal of echoes of its own .
When <NAME> , urging his kind offer , said , ' My dear <NAME> , are you sure you can remember no one whom your good Papa -- to whom I beg you present the best compliments of myself and <NAME> when you write -- might wish you to know ? ' it was natural , perhaps , that
The feature in oratory which appears to be the most practised , and most relished , is the constant repetition of the same idea or shadow of an idea in fresh words ; and the inquiry out of doors is not , ' What did he say ? ' but , ' <NAME> long did he speak ? '
' Enough to give a baby cold , ' Mrs. Gradgrind considered .
<NAME> scooped his eyes with his disengaged wrist , as if he were bent on gouging himself , but said not another word .
" Why , yes , I did , " returns the trooper in his off-hand way , " but I do n't care to know particularly , if it 's all correct and pleasant . "
The serpent was on the watch , the train was laid , the mine was preparing , the sapper and miner was at work .
The occupants of this seat are invisible to the great body of spectators , inasmuch as they sit on a much lower level than either the barristers or the audience , whose seats are raised above the floor .

The opinion was not the result of hasty consideration , for which indeed there was no opportunity at that time , as the child came directly , and soon occupied herself in preparations for giving Kit a writing lesson , of which it seemed he had a couple every week , and one regularly on that evening , to

' Oh , there can ' t be any doubt about it , ' rejoined Mrs. Sanders .
' He-he-he , ' tittered <NAME> , affecting cheerfulness , and gasping with agitation .
' I was afeerd , from his manner , that he might ha ' forgotten to take pepper vith that ' ere last cowcumber he eat .
It is on that extensive footing that <NAME> , I know from my own knowledge of him , is calculated to shine ; and the profits , I am told , are e-NOR-MOUS !
Then the little old man is drunk .
We had a merry game , not made the less merry by the <NAME> ' s mistakes , of which he committed an innumerable quantity , in spite of the watchfulness of the butterflies , and to their great aggravation .
Are there reasons why <NAME> , not being warped by prejudices , should accept it ?
Now , if he wanted a friend , why couldn ' t he have one that knew a thing or two , and could do him some good by his manners and conversation .
' I am not as good a girl as I ought to be .
Impenetrable as before , he is still an altered man ; and , proud as ever , he is humbled , or those marks would not be there .
<NAME> <NAME> , not unwelcome , has sat himself down next to <NAME> and taken <NAME> and <NAME> on his knees .
' I have nothing to report , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
Meanwhile the dog in disgrace ground hard at the organ , sometimes in quick time , sometimes in slow , but never leaving off for an instant .
In short , " said <NAME> cheerily , " and not to prose , I am a very fortunate girl and ought to be very grateful .

In this society , and where not , my <NAME> reigns supreme .
I might have known -- of course in a moment should have known -- that it could not have that meaning .
Is it his child ? " " Excuse me , Monsieur the <NAME> -- it is a pity -- yes. " The fountain was a little removed ; for the street opened , where it was , into a space some ten or twelve yards square .
Mr <NAME> said , ' Aha , <NAME> , there you are , are you ? ' -- for they were always kind to him , and glad to see him -- and then said , tossing one of the letters towards him , ' And there you are , too , <NAME> .
And she should hear me say , <NAME> : affectionately , quite dutifully and affectionately : how well she looked , considering her time of life .
It was impossible to restrain him , and the trembling child followed close behind .
said I , smiling , for I saw she wanted to go on .
We shall be down there , a few hours before , but shall require rest : especially the young lady , who _may_ have greater need of firmness than either you or I can quite foresee just now .
The waking from a sound nap as the mail came dashing past like a highway comet , with gleaming lamps and rattling hoofs , and visions of a guard behind , standing up to keep his feet warm , and of a gentleman in a fur cap opening his eyes and looking wild and stupefied -- the stopping at
The opinion of the <NAME> was divided respecting the derivation of its name .
We went arm-in-arm to the public-house where the carrier put up , and I promised , on the road , to write to her .
The third man brought the dispute to a close , most philosophically .
This is Mr <NAME> , my intimate friend -- a gentleman of good family and great expectations , but who , having rather involved himself by youthful indiscretion , is content for a time to fill the humble station of a clerk -- humble , but here most enviable .
' You hear this , <NAME> ? ' said <NAME> , in the same judicial form of speech as before .
' <NAME> Bobster. ' ' Cecilia , eh ? ' returned <NAME> , muttering the two names together over and over again in every variety of tone , to try the effect .
Mrs. <NAME> saw what she could do -- always knew it from the first .
' Look arter your wife , <NAME> , ' bellowed a fifth -- and then there was a roar of laughter .
You remember his breaking off here about some woman that he had had great trouble with. -- Did I hurt you ? " I had started , but not under his touch .
' You ' ll take a glass yourself , <NAME> , won ' t you ? ' said <NAME> , as <NAME> appeared .
Certainly not to be expected to look well , poor thing .
To appeal to her , was made hopeless by her having no sense of pity , even for herself .
Gradually , these strings of ragged people shortened and frayed away ; and then poor lights began to shine in high windows , and slender fires were made in the streets , at which neighbours cooked in common , afterwards supping at their doors .
I grant you I see the 'arm , ' says the man , 'but I do n't see the good .
If we go to the book-stall keeper 's , we shall certainly find that he is dead , or has set his house on fire , or run away .
After several new perusals of his poor friend ' s letter , he considered that the maintenance of ' a home in the old place for <NAME> ' was the primary duty imposed upon him .
Is there nobody else that knew them , nobody else in whom they had any confidence ?
Though not altogether enraptured at the sight of these visitors , <NAME> lost no time in opening the counting-house door , and extricating them from the workshop ; a rescue which was rendered the more necessary by Mr F. ' s <NAME> already stumbling over some impediment , and menacing steam power as an Institution with a stony reticule
Therefore I proposed to the children that they should come in and be very good at my table , and I would tell them the story of <NAME> Red Riding Hood while I dressed ; which they did , and were as quiet as mice , including <NAME> , who awoke opportunely before the appearance of the wolf .
And I for you ! ' This pure young feeling , this gentle and forbearing feeling of each towards the other , brought with it its reward in a softening light that seemed to shine on their position .
The appearance of a new boy did not create the sensation that might have been expected .
' You must know my dear , ' said <NAME> , ' but that I have no doubt you know already not only because I have already thrown it out in a general way but because I feel I carry it stamped in burning what ' s his names upon my brow that before I was introduced to the
The fact is , I do n't care much about it .
If he would light upon any of these old places , he must direct his steps to the obscurer quarters of the town , and there in some secluded nooks he will find several , still standing with a kind of gloomy sturdiness , amidst the modern innovations which surround them .
Mrs. Snagsby replies by delivering herself a prey to spasms , not an unresisting prey , but a crying and a tearing one , so that <NAME> 's Court re-echoes with her shrieks .
He entertained us with a long account of his achievements , which he narrated with such infinite relish , that he actually seemed to lick his lips as he told us racy anecdotes of stolen plate , and of old ladies whom he had watched as they sat at windows in silver spectacles ( he had plainly had an

He conducted Mrs General to the seat at his right hand with immense ceremony ; and <NAME> could not but notice as she followed with her uncle , both that he was again elaborately dressed , and that his manner towards Mrs General was very particular .
Having drunk it , Mr Dolls , with an evident fear of running down again unless he made haste , proceeded to business .
' Well ! ' said the lady , watching her .
' You may drive me , ' said the single gentleman , ' to the -- ' He was not going to add ' inn , ' but he added it for the sake of <NAME> ' s mother ; and to the inn they went .
I did not wish them to be any wiser and indeed was half ashamed of not entirely believing in him myself .
<NAME> <NAME> reposed under a patchwork counterpane , like a Harlequin at home .
Despicable trickery at elections ; under-handed tamperings with public officers ; cowardly attacks upon opponents , with scurrilous newspapers for shields , and hired pens for daggers ; shameful trucklings to mercenary knaves , whose claim to be considered , is , that every day and week they sow new crops of ruin with their venal types , which
Twice when the dustman is called in to carry off a cartload of old paper , ashes , and broken bottles , the whole court assembles and pries into the baskets as they come forth .
Veneering supposes a state of public affairs that probably never could by any possibility exist ( though this is not quite certain , in consequence of his picture being unintelligible to himself and everybody else ) , and thus proceeds .
She had never liked me ; I had never thought she did : she despised my wealth , and hated the splendour in which she lived ; but I had not expected that .
He would sit and talk to me in the old confidence , and with the old simplicity , and in the old unassertive protecting way , so that I would half believe that all my life since the days of the old kitchen was one of the mental troubles of the fever that was gone .
' Oh , yes , it ' s all yours .
" <NAME> soon what ? " asked <NAME> .
His step was elastic , and his face betokened inward pleasantry , as he advanced to <NAME> , and shook him cordially by the hand .
<NAME> is gone , perfectly gone. ' Quite overcome by these dismal reflections , <NAME> and Mrs. <NAME> sighed , and sat for some short time without speaking .
" Only tip him a nod every now and then when he looks off his paper , " said <NAME> , " and he 'll be as happy as a king .
' Lor , ' cried <NAME> , looking radiantly about her , ' we want to make everybody happy , not dismal ! -- And perhaps you wouldn ' t mind letting me know how used to it you begin to get , and how it all goes on ? ' ' I ' ll send <NAME> , '
There is something grotesque in it .
Is there danger of another ?
The case of <NAME> is in no essential altered from one of actual occurrence , made public by a disinterested person who was professionally acquainted with the whole of the monstrous wrong from beginning to end .
The <NAME> streets , the death-carts rumble , hollow and harsh .

Hushed in expectancy , she kept her wary gaze upon the stairs ; and seldom so much as darkly shook her right mitten ( with her fist in it ) , at the figure coming down .

' Quite cruel , ' said <NAME> .
Her disgraceful garments were removed , and some of <NAME> ' s were in the room .

We have both a great deal to learn .
Having ascertained its situation , <NAME> came out of those closer streets again , and dined at a place of refreshment and fell sound asleep after dinner .
Mrs <NAME> was a beauty then , and bucks threw wine-glasses over their heads by dozens in her honour .
This has made me secret and revengeful .
Then it ' s done , and very little more need be said. ' ' My dear <NAME> , ' said Mr Sparkler , with deference , ' I should like to say a word to Amy. ' ' Well , well !
But I may state that we all kept the middle of the deck , lest the boat should unexpectedly tip over ; and that the machinery , by some surprising process of condensation , worked between it and the keel : the whole forming a warm sandwich , about three feet thick .
The pinched and meagre aspect of the place would have killed a chameleon .
' Only a dozen and eight , love , ' replied <NAME> , affecting to take the question in a literal sense .
Then , came a loud knocking at the door , and then a hoarse murmur from such a multitude of angry voices as would have made the boldest quail .
And because I have nobody but you to look to , you think you are to make me do , or not do , everything you please , and are to put any affront upon me .
There was a light in the ferry-house window opposite : which streamed across the road , and threw into more sombre shadow a dark yew-tree with graves beneath it .
' A little before twilight , one Christmas Eve , <NAME> shouldered his spade , lighted his lantern , and betook himself towards the old churchyard ; for he had got a grave to finish by next morning , and , feeling very low , he thought it might raise his spirits , perhaps , if he went on
there he is , d ' ye hear him ?

Hope he may find it worth the money ! ' yawns , and saunters out .
He remembered his old bed too , when they laid him down in it : his aunt , <NAME> , and <NAME> : but there was something else , and recent too , that still perplexed him .
In short , <NAME> ' s gentleman can get nothing out of her but a repetition of what she has said before ( only a little stronger this time , as against his client ) , and therefore lets her go , in some confusion .
But that he had seen her come to this by inches , he never could have believed her to be the same .
But <NAME> hinted that from what had fallen from the confidante , he had been led to suspect that the young lady led a very miserable and unhappy life , under the strict control of her only parent , who was of a violent and brutal temper ; a circumstance which he thought might in some degree account ,
' We shall make <NAME> pay for peeping , ' said <NAME> , with considerable native humour , as he unfolded his papers .
One of these was <NAME> , another <NAME> , and the third a robber of fifty years , whose nose had been almost beaten in , in some old scuffle , and whose face bore a frightful scar which might probably be traced to the same occasion .
So I make so free , <NAME> , as to offer the remark , that you and <NAME> were too thick together to last .
said <NAME> with a droll look .
But he presently presented himself under worthier circumstances ; for , the <NAME> of <NAME> Love being in want of assistance , -- on account of the parental brutality of an ignorant farmer who opposed the choice of his daughter 's heart , by purposely falling upon the object , in a flour-sack , out of the first-floor window
Would they be forgiven in the morning , or turned adrift again !
Her nerves were a little shaken , she said , or she would not have given way to it .
She ' s been thinking of the old ' un ! ' And whenever Mrs. Gummidge was overcome in a similar manner during the remainder of our stay ( which happened some few times ) , he always said the same thing in extenuation of the circumstance , and always with the tenderest commiseration .
I ENTERTAIN a weak idea that the <NAME> people are as hard-worked as any people upon whom the sun shines .
The <NAME> and the <NAME> guardian called me into his room next morning , and then I told him what had been left untold on the previous night .

We ' ll sit down and talk it over again all the way through .
Let my body be where it would , my spirit was always wandering , wandering , wandering , about that house .
' I ha thowt on ' t , above a bit , sir .
" I knew you would tell me so , <NAME> . "
Thinks it was the plaintive 's air in which that report originatinin .
But I have not been brought up to it , and it ' s too late to learn it .
' Oh there ' s no worst in it , ' said the small servant .
When it was ready for her , she was ready for it , with her nightcap on , and the skirt of her gown turned back on her knees .
But what I do know I 'll tell you .
And as mere human knowledge can split a ray of light and analyse the manner of its composition , so , sublimer intelligences may read in the feeble shining of this earth of ours , every thought and act , every vice and virtue , of every responsible creature on it .
So soon as I could at all collect my thoughts , I sent for <NAME> , and begged him to provide me a conveyance in which it could be got to <NAME> in the night .
To say that <NAME> loved or cared for -- in the most ordinary acceptation of those terms -- any one of <NAME> ' s creatures , would be the wildest fiction .
' " I want to speak to you , " said the young lady ; " only a word .
All I say is , what step is the best to take , so as to reject these advances civilly and delicately , and without hurting his feelings too much , and driving him to despair , or anything of that kind ?
Uncommonly like ! ' ' You have noticed , perhaps , whom he favours with his attentions ?
<NAME> said he was a very shrewd doctor indeed , and knew perfectly what people ' s constitutions were ; which there appears some reason to suppose he did .
'If you insist upon that , I 'll do that also , ' replied <NAME> .
' <NAME> and fearful news. ' <NAME> had merely lifted up his heavy eyes to say it , and now dropped them again as he drooped , worn out , over one side of his easy-chair .
I think I will go down and see my old nurse .
So with the dogs in the kennel-buildings across the park , who have their restless fits and whose doleful voices when the wind has been very obstinate have even made it known in the house itself -- upstairs , downstairs , and in my <NAME> 's chamber .
You are coming back to see my father again ? ' ' Yes. ' ' You have been so good and thoughtful as to write him a note , saying that you are coming to-morrow ? ' ' Oh , that was nothing !
' He may not stop. ' And then called out , ' <NAME> , sir !
To all of which flattering expressions , <NAME> and Mrs. <NAME> replied , by thanking every lady and gentleman , <NAME> , for the favour of their company , and hoping they might have enjoyed themselves only half as well as they said they had .

Mr <NAME> , recovering very slowly from his illness , and entering into the receipt of his annuity , bought for the Marchioness a handsome stock of clothes , and put her to school forthwith , in redemption of the vow he had made upon his fevered bed .
If you will allow me , I ' ll return to my friend , <NAME> , who went upstairs again , when he found nothing serious had occurred .
The slight noise they made in raising the latch of the wicket-gate , caught his attention .
The chief object of this institution appeared to be , that <NAME> should move all the furniture into the back garden at early dawn , walk about the house in pattens all day , and move the furniture back again after dark .
These artless sports had naturally soothed and cheered the decline of her widowed father : a most exemplary gentleman ( called ' old <NAME> ' by his friends from his extreme sagacity , ) who encouraged them to the utmost , and whose chief regret , on finding that he drew near to <NAME> churchyard , was , that
This <NAME> had plenty to say for himself , and said it in an off-hand and amusing manner .
The passenger would then start to himself , and lower the window , to get the reality of mist and rain on his cheek .
Each ward in this institution is shaped like a long gallery or hall , with the dormitories of the patients opening from it on either hand .
' I suppose not , ' returned my aunt , rather grudging the admission ; ' but it ' s very aggravating .
A very superior gentleman , <NAME> .
But seeing how strongly she desired to remain quiet , and feeling that it was my own natural inclination too , at such a time , I did not attempt to break the silence .

He had been engaged in some attempts to make notes of these papers ; but being troubled ( as men of his stamp often are ) with an exceedingly distrustful and corrective thumb , that busy member had so often interposed to smear his notes , that they were little more legible than the various impressions of itself ;
He feared old <NAME> might consider it undutiful and might receive too great a shock .

The prisoner was so good as to beg permission to advise me how I could shelter my father from the wind and weather , better than I had done .
' That ' s the worst , I believe. ' ' So when she got a situation , ' said <NAME> , ' to keep a fractious old lady company , they didn ' t very well agree , and she didn ' t stop .
' Yes , my darling. ' ' Did I beat you much with that horrid little bonnet , <NAME> ? ' ' Nothing to speak of ; my dear. ' ' Did I pinch your legs , <NAME> ? ' ' Only nicely , my pet. ' ' You are sure you quite forgive me , <NAME> ?

He had been tried twice ; and on the second occasion the jury felt so much hesitation in convicting him , that they found a verdict of manslaughter , or murder in the second degree ; which it could not possibly be , as there had , beyond all doubt , been no quarrel or provocation , and if

What I would say , ' resumed the old lady , stopping her son as he was about to speak , 'is this .
She could not have swallowed food , though a table had been spread for her in the next field .
' Now , ' said <NAME> , ' drink that up , ev ' ry drop on it , and then turn the pot upside down , to let me see as you ' ve took the medicine. ' ' But , my dear <NAME> , ' remonstrated <NAME> .
Here is your benevolent Patriarch of a Casby , and there is his golden rule .
<NAME> thought how different from her own sunny little wedding , and wept .
She is treated with some distinction there , for the clerk steps out of his pew to show her through the outer office and to let her out .
' This is a distressing predicament for these young people , ' thought <NAME> , as he dressed himself next morning .
But as I still advanced , putting out my hand to him , he understood us in a moment .
She can not afford , and he can not afford , the remotest chance of another separation from a friend .

Five-and-forty green parasols , at seven and sixpence a-piece .
He has been in the hospital , I believe ? ' ' Yes .
' It is closing in , <NAME> .
" And did she go -- " " Yes , " cried the girl , anticipating the inquiry .
Suppose it should break in turning out !
If the same annual compliment would be acceptable there , why , I see nothing to part us , unless you do. ' ' Sir , ' returned Mrs. Sparsit .
My time must be fully occupied indeed , sir , not to leave me time to walk with you .
Arrived at the doorway of the house in which Mr Fledgeby ' s chambers were , she found a lady standing there in a travelling dress , holding in her hand -- of all things in the world -- a gentleman ' s hat .
I know it from her own lips .
'But do n't you think out-of-door relief a very bad thing , any way , <NAME> ?
The mist , wreathing itself into a hundred fantastic shapes , moved solemnly upon the water ; and the gloom of evening gave to all an air of mystery and silence which greatly enhanced its natural interest .
As it comprised two varieties of stage-coach travelling , which , with those I have already glanced at , comprehend the main characteristics of this mode of transit in <NAME> , I will take the reader as our fellow-passenger , and pledge myself to perform the distance with all possible despatch .
Do n't suppose that I am splitting my head and half breaking my heart over this miserable Chancery suit for my own rights and interests alone .

My Lady , whose chronic malady of boredom has been sadly aggravated by <NAME> this evening , glances wearily towards the candlesticks and heaves a noiseless sigh .
' Say nothing for him , if you please .
It was one of the wooden chambers upstairs , with the tide flowing underneath .
I ' m ready too , I am. ' Here <NAME> put his hands in his pockets , and jumped off and on the bottom step of the door .
At last , after several hours , when sundry summer-houses had been pulled down , and some area-railings had been torn up , to arm the more belligerent spirits , a rumour got about that the <NAME> were coming .
<NAME> is my witness that I love her ! " " I believe it , " answered her father , mournfully .
After a vast quantity of splashing , and cracking , and struggling , <NAME> was at length fairly extricated from his unpleasant position , and once more stood on dry land .
That fancy past , he opened an old chest , took out some clothes as fondly as if they had been living things , and began to smooth and brush them with his hand .
' With submission to his Reverence the <NAME> , if you ' ll mind what concerns you , <NAME> , <NAME> he ' ll mind what concerns him. ' ' You ' re out of temper , ' says <NAME> , winking to the company to observe how smoothly he will manage him .

I only said to <NAME> , wouldn ' t it be more consistent , me going in for being a reg ' lar brown bear respecting him , to go in as a reg ' lar brown bear all round ? ' ' Confess this minute , sir , ' said <NAME> , ' that you did it to

You are as well aware as I am , that I have had many disadvantages to leave behind me in life .
' A mere nothing ! ' he replied .
" You all think something else , I see . "
As his wife grew older , she became even a more cheerful and light-hearted little creature ; and it was a common saying among their friends , that it was impossible to say which looked the happier , <NAME> as he sat calmly smiling in his elbow-chair on one side of the fire , or his brisk little wife
He got me them papers as I wanted fur to carry me through -- I doen ' t rightly know how they ' re called -- and he would have give me money , but that I was thankful to have no need on .

It is conjectured that his unwillingness to hurt a fellow-creature intentionally was the cause of his shutting his eyes when he arrived at the fatal spot ; and that the circumstance of his eyes being closed , prevented his observing the very extraordinary and unaccountable demeanour of <NAME> .
I purposely abstain from extending these observations to any length .
" <NAME> , " said I , " do you remember telling me , before I first went to <NAME> 's private house , to notice that housekeeper ? " " Did I ? " he replied .
" Oh , father , I should so like to be a Resurrection-Man when I 'm quite growed up ! " <NAME> was soothed , but shook his head in a dubious and moral way .
Its tone made him uneasy , and the more so because of the inconsistency between it and the hasty letter I had left for him .

She had a little money , but it was less than little as they would take for all they done .
It strikes me as rather extraordinary that you should come , with such an object , to me. ' ' It may be all extraordinary together , ' returned <NAME> .
Therefore , the conditional clause he proposed was , that , if the minion should return in his late sneaking manner , and if , being closely watched , he should be found to possess himself of anything , no matter what , the sharp sword impending over his head should be instantly shown him , he should be

' You have not told me that. ' ' The joy , ' she replied , attiring herself , with fumbling fingers , ' of no love at all , and much pride and hate , my deary .
' This is an unexpected favour , sir. ' ' And an unwelcome one , ' said brother <NAME> ; ' an unwelcome one , I know. ' ' Men say you are truth itself , sir , ' replied <NAME> .

Before she has well done that , she takes a deep dive into the water .
And <NAME> , whose name is for ever blotted out from my list of lovers , by reason first of fickleness and then of base desertion , how do YOU do , wretch ?
Over and over again No .

By and by , one corner of the second-floor blind was disturbed , as if Mrs. Sparsit ' s eye were there ; also the other corner , as if the light porter ' s eye were on that side .
" I ask your pardon , my good friend , " said he , " but is this <NAME> 's Shooting <NAME> ? "
Do you not think that what I have seen of you and this little creature to-night must have an interest not wholly free from pain ? ' ' <NAME> , ' rejoined the old man after a moment ' s silence .
It seemed a very world that I must search through in a moment .
If I were not sure of it , I should , before now , have implored you , and implored your father , to let me make some provision for you in a more suitable place .

Some were lamenting , and in restless motion ; but , these were few .
The old man smiled , but looked about him with a look of having lost his way in life , which did not escape the dolls ' dressmaker .
<NAME> <NAME> must have been born to be a blessing to us .
Never mind them , don ' t look at them , but me .

' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' put my hat on tight for me. ' Sam dutifully adjusted the hat with the long hatband more firmly on his father ' s head , and the old gentleman , resuming his kicking with greater agility than before , tumbled with <NAME> through the bar , and through the passage
At the same time , in bringing any distress upon the lady who is the subject of the present conversation , or in unfortunately compromising her in any way , or in committing myself by any expression of sentiments towards her , not perfectly reconcilable with—in fact with—the domestic hearth ; or in taking any advantage of her father

' It was never bewitching , ' she said , laughing .
" Not with care and prudence and good help , " said my guardian .

" No , I will _not_ , sir , " returned <NAME> as if nothing were further from his thoughts or practice -- " which I do n't say it is -- wot I would humbly offer to you , sir , would be this .
I put up at the Cross of <NAME> , -- kept then by <NAME> -- sixty-five at least , and in a failing state of health .
<NAME> right opposite the stairs . "
<NAME> and women danced together , women danced together , men danced together , as hazard had brought them together .
But by dint of asking her way to the <NAME> after a while , and dropping the rest of her inquiry for the present , she really did advance , by slow degrees , towards the heart of that great region which is governed by the terrible <NAME> Mayor .
' Oh , ' replied Mrs. Squeers , nodding her head at <NAME> , and eyeing him coldly from top to toe .
' A gen ' l ' man , sir. ' ' Stars and garthers , chap ! ' said <NAME> , ' wa ' at dost thou coom and say thot for ?
The doors between it and the next were partly closed , and a screen was drawn before them ; but there was a light there , and it shone upon the cornice of his bed .
<NAME> <NAME> 's family I took upon myself ; intending to communicate with <NAME> only , and leave him to do as he liked about informing the rest .
' I won ' t give him a case of murder to read , ' muttered <NAME> with an oath ; ' but it shall be something very near it if whipcord cuts and bludgeons bruise. ' His companion said nothing , but there was something in his manner which galled <NAME> to add , with nearly as much
' <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , ' do you think I love <NAME> ? ' <NAME> was extremely discomfited by this unexpected question .
' What , ' said <NAME> , ' was the character of his business ; what was the nature of these -- a -- <NAME> , <NAME> ? ' ' Oh , it ' s a good story , as a story , ' returned that gentleman ; ' as good a thing of its kind as need be
Without presuming to give my opinion on this question , I delivered my message .
Consider yourself accountable to me .
You have addressed <NAME> , <NAME> .
It was obviously the weakness of the position .
' Wot a old image it is ! ' exclaimed <NAME> , indignant at this loss of time .
' Hear him come the four cats in the wheel-barrow -- four distinct cats , sir , I pledge you my honour .
All he could do , was to say to me , like a robin redbreast -- as he is -- " It ' s a boy. " A boy !
To get through them with the greater dispatch , <NAME> proposed that they should remain at the counting-house , for a week or so , until ten o ' clock at night ; to this , as nothing damped the zeal of <NAME> in the service of his kind patrons -- not even romance , which has seldom business
'Hold your tongue , sir , ' said <NAME> .
' To have the goodness to walk off , if you please , ' rejoined the Manager , stretching forth his arm , ' and to carry your jargon somewhere else. ' Every knob in the <NAME> ' s face turned white with astonishment and indignation ; even the red rim on his forehead faded , like a rainbow
<NAME> <NAME> , who was a terrible fellow to fall asleep after dinner , had not yet gone out , and there was no bird-cage in the middle window .
Come along. ' He was a very good old fellow , in his familiar way ; and having stirred the vestry fire , he looked round the shelves of registers for a particular volume .
' We take the liberty of coming , my young companion and I , madam , ' said <NAME> , ' on behalf of <NAME> Hexam. ' Miss <NAME> was stooping to loosen the bonnet-strings of the dolls ' dressmaker .
" Thank you , miss , " he returned , measuring the table with his troubled hands .
She talked so much about birth that for a moment I half fancied , and with pain -- But what an idle fancy to suppose that she could think or care what <NAME> was !
How I come to be interested , I need not explain .
<NAME> care what you ' re about , in this new half .
I seemed to have left the <NAME> ' s roof with a dark cloud lowering on it .
I had cherished a profound conviction that her bringing me up by hand gave her no right to bring me up by jerks .
He had ruptured a blood-vessel , and he was a dead man before his son could raise him .
Now , to be plain with you , if I ever , in the whole course of my life , take seven looks at it , at a hundred pound a look , it will be as much as I shall do .
The bell at the gate had scarcely sounded when Mr <NAME> came out to receive them .
I ' ll repeat the question for you a dozen times , if you require it , Sir. ' And the learned gentleman , with a firm and steady frown , placed his hands on his hips , and smiled suspiciously to the jury .
It is not likely that they ever met , though so often , without the thoughts of each reverting to the subject .
' I 'd send them one and all to -- ' 'Never mind where , ' interposed <NAME> .
<NAME> and retiring as her solitary life had made her , it had not embittered her sweet temper , or her earnest nature .
May I say it ? ' Little Dorrit involuntarily started from his side again , with the faintest shadow of her former look ; conquering that , she went on at great speed half across the <NAME> without replying !
" But I mean in professional attendance , medical attendance . "
' All point , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> ; ' but you shall hear Mrs. Leo Hunter repeat it .
I shall thank the madg'strates to dispose of this here little affair , and not to keep me while they read the paper , for I 've got an appointment with a genelman in the <NAME> , and as I am a man of my word and wery punctual in business matters , he 'll go away if I
The <NAME> was exactly as it had been , but he dreaded that he saw new meaning in its solemn shape .
<NAME> , you may sit down. ' Mr Boffin , still with his hands ruefully stuck in his pockets , sat on the edge of the settle , shrunk into a small compass , and eyed the potent Silas with conciliatory looks .
At last , he travelled back to the <NAME> , which was within rifle-shot of his bachelor retreat , and ordered tea in the wooden summer-house that afternoon for three persons ; an invitation to <NAME> and her brother to partake of that entertainment at that place , having been the object both of his journey and his note
She ran up-stairs , and sat down on the floor in her own room , and cried abundantly .
" Do you mean what business have we come upon ? "
' Why it was only last night , sir , ' whispered <NAME> ' s mother , ' that I left him in <NAME> Bethel. ' ' Indeed ! ' said her fellow-passenger .
But having noticed ( excuse me ) that you generally walk out at night , I thought I should inconvenience you least by awaiting your return .
He said nothing at all .
<NAME> ' t you say so , my dear ? ' ' I should say there was not a doubt about it , mama , ' returned <NAME> , with a cheerful smile .
<NAME> cheerful and improvin ' conwersation , ain ' t it , <NAME> ? ' ' You ' re a reprobate , ' replied <NAME> ; ' and I desire you won ' t address no more o ' them ungraceful remarks to me. ' So far from being edified by this very proper reply , the elder <NAME>
Do it ! ' ' <NAME> ' t hurt the boy , <NAME> , ' urges <NAME> , shielding him .
The single gentleman among his other peculiarities -- and he had a very plentiful stock , of which he every day furnished some new specimen -- took a most extraordinary and remarkable interest in the exhibition of <NAME> .
<NAME> , dust , and waste-paper were all over the house .
Now , my dear Esther , I know these views of mine appear extremely harsh to you , and will to Ada when you tell her what has passed between us .
I had received strict orders from my sister to call for him at the <NAME> , that evening , on my way from school , and bring him home at my peril .
' Now , how do you feel ? ' said Mr Boffin .
He told me he was happy to have the honour of making my acquaintance ; and when I had paid my homage to Mrs. Waterbrook , presented me , with much ceremony , to a very awful lady in a black velvet dress , and a great black velvet hat , whom I remember as looking like a near
From the first , she made a show of behaving to me with great delicacy .
But he may have merited it .
<NAME> , ' said the Major , ' is her name ; angelic Edith ! ' ' To angelic <NAME> ! ' cried the smiling <NAME> .
' The gal , ' returned the boy .
' I don ' t know what to call it , ' I replied .
' And what are you now ?
I don ' t like our situation , and very little would induce me to change it .
It was amusing , too , when we had dined , and rattled down a steep pass , having no other moving power than the weight of the carriages themselves , to see the engine released , long after us , come buzzing down alone , like a great insect , its back of green and gold so shining
Private residence is not -- oh dear , no , sir , not five hundred yards , sir. ' Here the waiter blew a candle out , and made a feint of lighting it again , in order to afford <NAME> an opportunity of asking any further questions , if he felt so disposed .
When I heard ' em say they had found him guilty of what he didn ' t do , you was gone , and so was the lodger -- though I think I should have been frightened to tell him , even if he ' d been there .
" Most willingly , " he retorted , " if I could .
<NAME> <NAME> and the Major are the gayest there ; but Mr <NAME> has a smile for the whole table .
When it at last rose to the walls of the convent of the <NAME> Saint <NAME> , it was as if that weather-beaten structure were another Ark , and floated on the shadowy waves .
He would very much like , he said , to see <NAME> before he died ; and spoke with much interest about the great things to be seen there .
The door and window of the vacant room being open , we looked in .
Assured of his qualifications , <NAME> left the building with a light heart , and bright visions of his future promotion : which served to occupy his mind until he reached the shop of the undertaker .
Yes : there was a chaise- and-four , a short distance before them , dashing along at full gallop .
' What ' s the matter , sir ? ' inquired <NAME> .
( <NAME> yer hi on his ears . )
Presently Mr Witherden , smelling very hard at the nosegay , came to the window and looked at him , and after that Mr <NAME> came and looked at him , and after that the old gentleman and lady came and looked at him again , and after that they all came and looked at him together , which
Why , I know very well , ' said old <NAME> , ' and you know very well , that your lady and gentleman would set me up like a queen for the rest of my life , if so be that we could make it right among us to have it so .
<NAME> ' t I ? ' ' Yes , <NAME> , yes .
It brought a great many boxes , which were bumped and tossed upon the roof , almost as painfully as if they had been deposited on one ' s own head , without the intervention of a porter ' s knot ; and several damp gentlemen , whose clothes , on their drawing round the stove , began to
<NAME> and pick a bit , my pretty .
'It will make you cry , I know , to hear what he can tell ; but never mind , never mind , it will be all over , and you will smile again -- I know that too -- to think how changed he is ; you did the same with me .
It seemed , while it lasted , to be all alight and alive with that inexplicable feeling I had had before ; and when we were out of it , I was as much dazed for a few moments as if I had been in lightning .
An angry flush overspread her features ; and she said , in an intolerant manner , grasping the arm-chair tightly with her hands : ' What compensation can you make to ME for opening such a pit between me and my son ?
Her mind pursued them , looking for him among the <NAME> ; and then she clung closer to his real presence and trembled more .
-- Wished <NAME> only to know what would be serviceable to her .
Here he stopped for a minute , to look at the strange , irregular clusters of lights piled one above the other , and twinkling afar off so high , that they looked like stars , gleaming from the castle walls on the one side and the <NAME> on the other , as if they illuminated veritable castles in
He blushed very much at finding himself among strangers , and chuckled aloud .
Several rough beds made of old sacks , were huddled side by side on the floor .
' <NAME> to me , Wally , listen to me .
<NAME> , my dear brother , come here pray. ' ' <NAME> , my dear fellow , ' replied his brother , hurrying into the room , ' what is the -- ah !
O dear good faithful tender <NAME> , I feel the loving tremble of your hand upon my arm , as solemnly this day as if it had been the rustle of an angel 's wing !
I don ' t know you. ' ' No , sir , you don ' t know me. ' Mr <NAME> looked full at the man , and the man looked full at him .
" I did n't let <NAME> see what I thought about it , you know , miss , " was her first remark when she came up , " but he 's in a bad way , poor old fellow ! "
' How did you find the cold pie , <NAME> ? ' ' It warn ' t amiss , mum. ' ' And the beer , ' said the lady of the caravan , with an appearance of being more interested in this question than the last ; ' is it passable , <NAME> ? ' ' It '
' Why what can cut him adrift now ? ' ' Nothing , ' replied Mr Carker .
His lips were bloodless , and his bones sharp and thin .
You know why , and you are her father .
Do you want to rob me , or to murder me ?
Should I sit unmoved , if there were any such thing there ? ' ' <NAME> ? ' looking wildly at her -- ' it ' s gone now -- and why are you so unmoved ?
<NAME> , I assure you , to the bone ! "
<NAME> had not ( if he might use the expression ) Power enough to see in any delicate little attentions and -- and -- Testimonials that he might under such circumstances receive , the goodness of human nature , the fine spirit animating the Collegians as a community , and at the same time no degradation to himself ,
I dare say ours is likely to be a rather long engagement , but our motto is " Wait and hope ! " We always say that .
For some days afterwards , the neighbouring country was overrun with boys , who , the report went , had been secretly furnished by <NAME> and <NAME> , not only with a hearty meal of bread and meat , but with sundry shillings and sixpences to help them on their way .
Every one of the men , women , boys , girls , and babies , who were assembled to see the visitors in their fancy-dresses , screamed with delight and ecstasy , when <NAME> , with the brigand on one arm , and the troubadour on the other , walked solemnly up the entrance .
Why shouldn ' t we make one fireside of it , and marry each other ? ' ' Oh , <NAME> , you ' re joking ! ' ' No , no , I ' m not .
When it was first proposed that I should go abroad , or how it came to be agreed among us that I was to seek the restoration of my peace in change and travel , I do not , even now , distinctly know .
Without appearing to observe what he was doing , I saw how carefully he adjusted the little room , put a candle ready and the means of lighting it , arranged the bed , and finally took out of a drawer one of her dresses ( I remember to have seen her wear it ) , neatly folded with
I should think so , deary ! ' cried <NAME> .
cries <NAME> , cutting him short .
<NAME> was a shock-headed , shambling , awkward lad with an uncommonly wide mouth , very red cheeks , a turned-up nose , and certainly the most comical expression of face I ever saw .
Or another , " Is that a boat yonder ? " And afterwards we would fall into a dead silence , and I would sit impatiently thinking with what an unusual amount of noise the oars worked in the thowels .
A Master of <NAME> would be preferred. " ' There ! ' said <NAME> , folding the paper again .
<NAME> , sir ? ' The child raised a dismal cry , by way of answer , and <NAME> , throwing himself into the most favourable attitude for exercising his strength , beat him until the little urchin in his writhings actually rolled out of his hands , when he mercifully allowed him to roll away , as he
Alice got up , took off her wet cloak , and laid it aside .
Can you see his signal ? " " Not well from here ; but I think I see it. -- Now I see him !
said <NAME> , observing the curiosity with which <NAME> surveyed the shelves that reached from the floor to the ceiling .
It had always been marked by a subdued affectionate deference that seemed to have sprung up on the very day of his engagement ; whatever was odd in her dress or her ways had seemed to have no oddity for him ; he had sometimes borne a quietly-amused face in her company , but still it had seemed as
When she pressed me to take wine , I took water .
' " Is she gone ? " he eagerly inquired .
I beg your son to receive the assurance of my profound consideration .
' Ye-es , ' returned <NAME> , disparagingly , ' they work ; but don ' t you think they overdo it ?
' Now , look you here , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> the flushed , confronting him with his legs wide apart , his hands deeper in his pockets , and his hair like a hayfield wherein his windy anger was boisterous .
These were , however , in all probability , nothing more than eyelashes in a wrong place , as the eyes of <NAME> were quite free from any such natural impertinencies .
The length of those five days I can convey no idea of to any one .
' Here , woman , ' he said , ' here ' s your deaf and dumb son .
' <NAME> , ma ' am ; nothing of the kind can be contemplated in this town , I am persuaded .
The mystery of the future and the little clue afforded to it by the voice of the present seemed expressed in the whole picture .
He 'll have no more on you .
I saw you with my own eyes. ' <NAME> was not a little alarmed to hear this , supposing that the lady might be intimately acquainted with the firm of <NAME> and <NAME> ; but what followed tended to reassure her .
' Why , yes , ' said the attorney , with a slight cough .
' Perhaps you ' d like to walk upstairs , <NAME> ! ' said <NAME> .
'Getting out of a coach , ' replied <NAME> , shedding tears of delight , 'and going into a house .
" But , my Ada , we are not going to trust to it ! "
I was dressing about half-past nine next day , when the noise above hurried me on deck .
'But why , ' said the young man , 'why run the chance of that occurring which so nearly happened ?
Before a week was out , I received a note from <NAME> , dated <NAME> , stating that he hoped he had made some advance in that matter appertaining to our private and personal capacities , and that he would be glad if I could come and see him again upon it .
' I might have some hope of preventing the elopement ; but there ' s the same difficulty , <NAME> , just the same .
' I wouldn ' t wish to make you uneasy , ' returned <NAME> , pursuing her supper .
she has been at her glass since she recovered .
' They ' re playful , <NAME> my dear ; they ' re playful .
Oh , it 's all right enough !
Mr <NAME> wending homeward from the <NAME> ( for such was the appropriate name of <NAME> ' s choice retreat ) , after a sinuous and corkscrew fashion , with many checks and stumbles ; after stopping suddenly and staring about him , then as suddenly running forward for a few paces , and as suddenly halting again and
But he was down on the rank wet grass , filing at his iron like a madman , and not minding me or minding his own leg , which had an old chafe upon it and was bloody , but which he handled as roughly as if it had no more feeling in it than the file .
And is it <NAME> , let me ask you , to stigmatise and denounce an individual for begging to be excused this time , when the same individual may -- ha -- respond with the required accommodation next time ?
Admiring what could have wound his friend up to such a pitch of mystery , <NAME> endeavoured , by a series of questions , to elucidate the cause ; but in vain .
He sleeps in his turret with a complaining flag-staff over his head , and has some leads outside on which , any fine morning when he is down here , his black figure may be seen walking before breakfast like a larger species of rook .
After much blundering and backing , it stopped at the door : rolling heavily from side to side when its other motion had ceased , as if it had taken cold in its damp stable , and between that , and the having been required in its dropsical old age to move at any faster pace than a walk
If you will allow me to take the liberty of remarking that there are few comestibles better , in their way , than a Devil , and that I believe , with a little division of labour , we could accomplish a good one if the young person in attendance could produce a gridiron , I would put it
Get out ! ' Nicholas bit his lip and knit his hands involuntarily , for his fingerends tingled to avenge the insult ; but remembering that the man was drunk , and that it could come to little but a noisy brawl , he contented himself with darting a contemptuous look at the tyrant , and walked , as
" He is alive , at any rate , " says <NAME> .
Now , the ladies being together under these circumstances , it was extremely natural that the discourse should turn upon the propensity of mankind to tyrannize over the weaker sex , and the duty that developed upon the weaker sex to resist that tyranny and assert their rights and dignity .
This fellow , <NAME> , presumes to be impertinent to me , <NAME> .
<NAME> , ' said the spare waiter .
Then , hushing his footsteps , he passes to his own room , lights his pipe , and delivers himself to the Spectres it invokes at midnight .
I was accompanied to this prison by two gentlemen officially connected with its management , and passed the day in going from cell to cell , and talking with the inmates .
' But we have much to be thankful for .
' I am very sensible of this attention .
Such a woman as she ought to be , after all this .
The blending , as he did so , of his old submission with a sense of something humorous ; the striving of that with a certain smouldering ferocity , which might have flashed fire in an instant ( as the born gentleman seemed to think , for he had a wary eye upon him ) ; and the easy
" And I would that you could take your leave , and we could all take our leave , <NAME> , " returned my guardian bitterly , " of a cause you know of . "
He was sitting perfectly still ; his tongue was put out , as if in derision ; and he was grinning at <NAME> with such a grin as only a goblin could call up .
I by no means forgot , when I began , that my daughter was present , <NAME> .
The cry was repeated -- a light appeared -- a vision of two terrified half-dressed men at the top of the stairs swam before his eyes -- a flash -- a loud noise -- a smoke -- a crash somewhere , but where he knew not , -- and he staggered back .
I like it very much indeed .
<NAME> <NAME> was a master now , in another school , under another head .
'Yes , I am , <NAME> , ' replied the young lady , disposing of its contents ; 'and tired enough of it I am , too .
I was always curious about <NAME> schools -- fell , long afterwards and at sundry times , into the way of hearing more about them -- at last , having an audience , resolved to write about them .
My aunt sitting on a quantity of luggage , with her two birds before her , and her cat on her knee , like a female <NAME> , drinking tea .
All within was the same , down to the seaweed in the blue mug in my bedroom .
And just below bridge , as we were sculling home , <NAME> crept out of the dark in his boat .
' Did he though ? ' inquired another cabman .
' Eh ? ' said <NAME> , raising her eyes from her book , when he stopped before her .
' I positively sometimes can ' t believe it , ' said <NAME> .
The periodical visits of the trooper to these rooms , however , in the course of his patrolling is an assurance of protection and company both to mistress and maid , which renders them very acceptable in the small hours of the night .
On his taking the candle to assist his search , Mr Wegg observes that he has a convenient little shelf near his knees , exclusively appropriated to skeleton hands , which have very much the appearance of wanting to lay hold of him .
Where is he ? " ' ' Who ? ' inquired <NAME> .
With this view he gave a kick at the outside , by way of prelude ; and , then , applying his mouth to the keyhole , said , in a deep and impressive tone : 'Oliver ! '
' No , ' says <NAME> , in an uncompromising voice ; ' no money. ' ' Madness and moonshine , ' is then the compressed verdict of the <NAME> .
Only promise me , that , if it ' s the poor thing that ' s kept here secretly , you ' ll let me take charge of her and be her nurse .
<NAME> and he were partners for I do n't know how many years .
There was an uneasy movement among them , but nobody spoke .
A stony business altogether , with heavy stone balustrades , and stone urns , and stone flowers , and stone faces of men , and stone heads of lions , in all directions .
there never was anything so cruelly sacrificed as those jewels were , never ! ' Overpowered by this agonising thought , Mrs. <NAME> shook her head , in a melancholy manner , and applied her handkerchief to her eyes .
I expressed myself quite sure of that , and <NAME> , turning his eyes more gently to his wife , said : ' She ' s the usefullest and best of women , C. P. Barkis .
" My friends , " says <NAME> , " we have partaken in moderation " ( which was certainly not the case so far as he was concerned ) " of the comforts which have been provided for us .
' Why , then you may rouse my indignation or wound my pride , ' rejoined <NAME> ; ' but you will not break my rest ; for if the scene were acted over again , I could take no other part than I have taken ; and whatever consequences may accrue to myself from it , I shall
As she looked upon it now , she saw it , for the first time , free from the cloud that had darkened her childhood .
I saw you doing it . "
He goes to his crossing and begins to lay it out for the day .
He now stepped up to where <NAME> and <NAME> stood upon the pavement .
I learned in a moment that what I had thought was pity and compassion was devoted , generous , faithful love .
You are the defendant , <NAME> , in <NAME> and <NAME> ? ' said <NAME> .
It is owing to the difficulty of knowing whether they are likely to endure or have any real foundation , that my sister <NAME> and myself have been very undecided how to act , <NAME> , and <NAME> -- ' ' Traddles , ' said my friend , finding himself looked at .
You are right in supposing that I am not unaccustomed to -- an influential position. ' ' I am happy , ' returned Mrs General , ' to be so corroborated .
I coaxed myself to sleep by thinking of <NAME> 's , next Wednesday ; and in my sleep I saw the file coming at me out of a door , without seeing who held it , and I screamed myself awake .
But his interest centred in <NAME> Parker Peps , who always took his seat on the side of the bed .
The worst was , that with his big blue eyes , and his polished head , and his long white hair , and his bottle-green legs stretched out before him , terminating in his easy shoes easily crossed at the instep , he had a radiant appearance of having in his extensive benevolence made the drink for the human
The irascible <NAME> scratches the air .
But <NAME> tried it on with mincing satisfaction ; smirked at her cadaverous self in the glass , as she thought of its killing effect upon the <NAME> ; and suffering her maid to take it off again , and to prepare her for repose , tumbled into ruins like a house of painted cards .
Avoiding the <NAME> , I put up at an inn of minor reputation down the town , and ordered some dinner .
People oughtn ' t to be tempted. ' Kit inwardly resolved that he would never tempt a carrier any more , save with an empty box ; and having formed this <NAME> determination , he turned his thoughts to the second question .
This singular request produced an old man in a black skull-cap , unable to walk , who was carried up by a couple of bearers and deposited in the room near the door .
They are mine ! " ' <NAME> , glancing at us all , seemed to think there was a good deal in this idea .
As he wiped his dripping whiskers in an ogreish way , he met her eyes , and pausing , said , with no very gentle voice : ' Well ? ' ' Was such an absolute Booby necessary to the purpose ? ' ' I know what I am doing .
Oh , <NAME> , <NAME> , vy worn ' t there a alleybi ! ' But surely , my dear sir , ' said little Perker , as he stood in <NAME> ' s apartment on the morning after the trial , ' surely you don ' t really mean -- really and seriously now , and irritation apart
The clerks are indisposed to work ; and they make assignations to eat chops in the afternoon , and go up the river .
When I lost everything that makes life dear , the worst of all my thoughts was that I was parted for ever from her ! ' <NAME> , standing with one hand on the gunwale of the boat , and his eyes cast down , put his disengaged hand before his face .
Overhaul your catechism till you find that passage , and when found turn the leaf down .
I am desperately intent ; ' the languor of his desperation being quite tropical ; ' on your softening towards your sister—which you ought to do ; and on your being a more loving and agreeable sort of brother—which you ought to be. ' ' I will be , <NAME> Harthouse. ' ' No time like the present ,
Stay where you are , and all ' s well , and all ' s as it was to be .
' Nor from me ? ' said <NAME> .
' A most engaging little Beauty ! ' said <NAME> , taking my arm .
I believe that very few men are capable of estimating the immense amount of torture and agony which this dreadful punishment , prolonged for years , inflicts upon the sufferers ; and in guessing at it myself , and in reasoning from what I have seen written upon their faces , and what to my certain knowledge they feel
' <NAME> ten minutes. ' ' Done ! ' responded <NAME> .
Still in that attitude he said , with a hollow voice , " Good night , <NAME> , " when I deemed it advisable to go to bed and leave him .
I had been thinking of it , sweeping over those mountain wastes of snow in <NAME> , then inaccessible to any human foot ; and had been speculating which was the lonelier , those solitary regions , or a deserted ocean .
But this is the place to cure ' em in ; this is the place where the all-overs is smoked off. ' ' You may make ready , then , ' replies the visitor , ' as soon as you like. ' He divests himself of his shoes , loosens his cravat , and lies across the foot of
The quarter is not due till <NAME> , but you may pay it , and have done with it .
These conditions agreed upon , the page showed them down as far as the staircase window ; and the big footman , relieving guard at that point , piloted them in perfect safety to the street-door .
<NAME> has been in such a state of impatience to come !
The Patriarch , meanwhile , came inanely beaming towards the counting-house in the wake of <NAME> .
'And make your fortun ' out of hand ? '
Anything that I had seen in <NAME> Havisham ?
Until then , I am enough for him , perhaps , and all in all .
Another lady recounted her own personal struggle and final triumph , in the course whereof she had found it necessary to call in her mother and two aunts , and to weep incessantly night and day for six weeks .
You were so much in the habit of thinking for me , in the happy old days here , and I came so naturally to you for counsel and support , that I really think I have missed acquiring it. ' ' And what is it ? ' said <NAME> , cheerfully .
Thus accoutred , and walking with the confident tread of such a character , and with the supple freedom of a woman who had habitually walked in her girlhood , bare-foot and bare-legged , on the brown sea-sand , <NAME> took her way along the streets .
' <NAME> ; a glass of punch ! ' ' With great pleasure , ' said <NAME> ; the satisfaction of whose countenance , after drinking it , bore testimony to the sincerity of the reply .
As to the whelp ; throughout this scene as on all other late occasions , he had stuck close to <NAME> .
No such hope dawned upon me .
We must all agree in that .
' <NAME> , ' said Mr Toots , ' I am drawn towards the building .
" When those learned gentlemen begin to raise moss-roses from the powder they sow in their wigs , I shall begin to be astonished too ! "
' You are my anchor. ' Having embraced her Anchor with great affection , <NAME> took a bottle of sweet toilette water from the table , and called to her maid for a fine handkerchief .
The housekeeper has dropped her voice to a little more than a whisper .
Therefore , <NAME> asserting those finest emotions of our nature , in preference to weakly gratifying her curiosity , shook and buffeted <NAME> both before and during the application of the paving-stone , and took no further notice of the strangers .
But what would have been duty without that , was still duty with it -- or <NAME> thought so -- and duty must be done .
<NAME> <NAME> extended his hand to each of us in succession , and then covered his face with his pocket-handkerchief , which I think had more snuff upon it than he was aware of .
" Now , be happy , child , under better circumstances .
I believe I ' ve only had the honour of seeing you once myself ? ' ' <NAME> , I have not been intimate with <NAME> , ' returned <NAME> ; ' or I might perhaps have waited on you long ago , <NAME> Heep. ' There was something in the tone of this reply , which made <NAME>
<NAME> , Mr <NAME> is yours. ' ' I am very glad , <NAME> , ' said Mr <NAME> , ' very glad indeed .
The things that you see here , are things to be seen , and not spoken of . '
And off _her_ head comes !
Her grief burst out when she first saw me ; but she controlled it soon , and spoke in whispers , and walked softly , as if the dead could be disturbed .
I don ' t know who would have a child , for my part !
His manner was determined ; and the matter was growing rather too serious to be hushed up .
' I mean an interest in her doing well , ' resumed <NAME> ; ' a desire that she may be comfortable and prosperous .
' Only one of our public offices , ' replied <NAME> , hurrying her through a door , and looking round to see that the other women were following .
<NAME> ' t mind me , who , for the matter of years , might be your father or your uncle .
It was the beautifullest bell she had ever heard , she said , and sounded grand !
Her appearance was exactly what I have described it , when I first saw her ; but the society of the two ladies was so agreeable , and came so natural to me , that I felt myself falling a little in love with her .
There , they found two women ; one , knitting .
Little Jane is the same .
Where is she ? ' As he propounded this question , which <NAME> ' s mother echoed , somebody in a room near at hand , uttered a great shriek , and a stout lady in a white dress came running to the door , and supported herself upon the bridegroom ' s arm .
If the wing of friendship should never moult a feather , the wing of relationship should never be clipped , but be always expanded and serene .
' I tell you , child , ' he said petulantly , ' I can ' t be got up the narrow stairs without <NAME> .
' Now , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , when we were alone , ' I should like to hear what you are doing , and where you are going , and all about you .
Presently her pretty face reappeared , with a greatly heightened colour , and she said that she had told <NAME> , and that <NAME> had fetched in <NAME> , and that <NAME> Tartar— ' who is waiting now , in case you want him , ' added <NAME> , with a half look back , and in not a
My sister <NAME> -- a little girl , <NAME> , with black eyes -- when we were down at <NAME> ' s ?
" But if I had bushels of it , I would not show as much as would make a cartridge without knowing why . "
' What will she ever do ! ' sobbed Minnie .
Swear me , if you please , <NAME> ; ' and sworn the chemist was , before the judge could find words to utter .
" You have prepared me for my exposure , and I thank you for that too .
For some days we had a dead calm , or very light winds , during which the crew amused themselves with fishing , and hooked an unlucky dolphin , who expired , in all his rainbow colours , on the deck : an event of such importance in our barren calendar , that afterwards we dated from the dolphin
But the chairmen were too much exhausted with laughing to afford him the slightest assistance , and the ladies were every moment approaching nearer and nearer .
Then may be seen <NAME> -- invalided , bent , and almost blind , but of worthy presence yet -- riding with a stalwart man beside him , constant to his bridle-rein .
The fact is , when -- was it you that tumbled upstairs , <NAME> ? ' ' It was , ' said I , laughing .
Presently , the chateau began to make itself strangely visible by some light of its own , as though it were growing luminous .
I say " we " , <NAME> ; for I never will , ' said Mrs. Micawber with emotion , ' I never will desert <NAME> Micawber. ' I murmured my admiration and approbation .
You always have your appetites too , and what a comfort that is. ' <NAME> thought that she could sometimes dispense with her own appetite very conveniently ; and thought , moreover , that there was nothing either in the lady ' s personal appearance or in her manner of taking tea , to lead to the conclusion that
<NAME> , though she had little <NAME> on her lap , could not forget her own first-born .
' My dear girl , ' said <NAME> kindly , ' it is no fault of yours .
But Mr Dombey hardly seemed to think so , as he still stood with his back to the fire , drawn up to his full height , and looking at his head-clerk with a dignified composure , in which there seemed to lurk a stronger latent sense of power than usual .
<NAME> of having it confirmed , though it was all but a conviction , I avoided the newspapers , and begged <NAME> ( to whom I had confided the circumstances of our last interview ) never to speak of her to me .
' " To the <NAME> of <NAME> ! " shouted the <NAME> greens ; and down their four-and-twenty throats went four-and-twenty imperial pints of such rare old hock , that they smacked their eight-and-forty lips , and winked again .
If he hadn ' t been poring over his books out of fear of you , he would have been well and merry now , I know he would. ' The schoolmaster looked round upon the other women as if to entreat some one among them to say a kind word for him , but they shook their heads
Do you not believe it is the truth ? " " A bad truth for you , " said <NAME> , speaking with knitted brows , and looking straight before him .
' I should not let you depart from me thus . '
( Mr Dorrit could not bear the faintest appearance of its being depreciated , even by Mr Merdle himself . )
The emphasis was helped by the speaker ' s square wall of a forehead , which had his eyebrows for its base , while his eyes found commodious cellarage in two dark caves , overshadowed by the wall .
Now the conscientious <NAME> , knowing what he had done to thwart the gracious Fledgeby , was particularly disconcerted by this encounter .
He had left his card three times .
And are you really going so early , my dear Dombey ! ' Oh , indeed !
Any one of my three friends will be happy to take you , were it only out of respect to me .
<NAME> <NAME> , if it comes to that , let _me_ go .
I so dread being awful .
But now , Mr <NAME> ' s interest began to centre in book-shops ; and more than that -- for that of itself would not have been much -- in one exceptional kind of book .
And setting the lantern , when all was done , at the foot of one of the <NAME> , they comfortably trotted to and fro for an evening walk , to the end that the murky cobwebs in Mrs <NAME> ' s brain might be blown away .
The first , are practising in a back settlement near <NAME> ; the second , put themselves in communication , through their chief , with Mr <NAME> , to whom they offer terms to be bought off ; and the third , in the person of an artful trombone , lurks and dodges round the corner , waiting for
' Poor bird ! ' cried brother <NAME> , gently taking her hand in his , and laying her head upon his arm .
' Wretched creature , what do you want here ? ' said the gentleman , who it is needless to say was <NAME> .
' Good morning. ' ' Won ' t you wait and see <NAME> ? ' asked <NAME> , kindly .
' Being all right myself , <NAME> , I request to be left alone -- instantly , Sir. ' ' What a funny fellow you are ! ' cried <NAME> .
You know best about that , <NAME> ! ' Though this was a concerted plot between <NAME> and her sister , originating in humane intentions and having for its object the inducing Mr <NAME> to declare himself in time , it failed in its effect ; for <NAME> being one of those young ladies who are prematurely shrill and
That was hid with you. " " Oh ah ! " he returned , with something like a gruff laugh .
<NAME> sign on door-post ; chequered human life .
I found everything in a satisfactory state at the cottage ; and was enabled to gratify my aunt exceedingly by reporting that the tenant inherited her feud , and waged incessant war against donkeys .
I never said six words to her myself , I ain ' t a-goin ' to tell her so. ' ' Would you like me to do it , <NAME> ? ' said I , doubtfully .
The room being by this time very warm and somewhat crowded , in consequence of the influx of four gentlemen , who had just killed each other in the piece under representation , <NAME> accepted the invitation , and promised to return at the conclusion of the performances ; preferring the cool air and twilight out of doors to
Creeping on where time has been , A rare old plant is the <NAME> green .
She then shut the bedroom door , and all the other doors , and going down stairs and emerging from the <NAME> into the busy streets , took omnibus for <NAME> : pressing on the road all the gaily-dressed ladies whom she could see from the window , and making them unconscious lay-figures for dolls , while she mentally
<NAME> <NAME> wrote his crimes on flaring sheets of paper , seized him -- would have torn him out of the breast of an army to bear <NAME> company -- set his head and heart on pikes , and carried the three spoils of the day , in Wolf-procession through the streets .
' We WILL be happy , ' replied the old man hastily .
' Trained you down very low , it has !
Of course he knew about my father from his connection with <NAME> .
There is no beau whom it takes four men at once to shake into his buckskins , or who goes to see all the executions , or who is troubled with the self-reproach of having once consumed a pea .
Often when Mr <NAME> seemed beaten , he would suddenly make a start , turn the tables , clatter them about the ears of Mrs Chick , and carry all before him .
They never talk of theirs to us , and they never talk of ours to us .
' I may be very fond of pennywinkles , <NAME> , but it don ' t follow that I ' m to have ' em for tea. ' ' Well , it don ' t matter , ' said <NAME> .
The boy lifted the latch of the door , and they passed at once into a low circular room , where a man stood before a red fire , looking down into it , and a girl sat engaged in needlework .
The umpires having partaken of a dram , shook hands and departed , as they had to drive out of town that night .
I was haunted by the fear that she would , sooner or later , find me out , with a black face and hands , doing the coarsest part of my work , and would exult over me and despise me .
<NAME> <NAME> said grace with theatrical declamation , -- as it now appears to me , something like a religious cross of the <NAME> in <NAME> with <NAME> the Third , -- and ended with the very proper aspiration that we might be truly grateful .
My dear , face Mr Chivery .
How very clever it was in you , ma ' am , to choose a time when I had gone to tea with my pa , and was sure not to come back without being fetched !
' I suppose , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , his indignation rising while he spoke -- ' I suppose , <NAME> , that it is the intention of your employers to seek to criminate me upon the testimony of my own friends ? ' <NAME> struck his forefinger several times against the left side of his nose ,
To edge his way along the crowded paths of life , warning all human sympathy to keep its distance , was what the knowing ones call " nuts " to <NAME> .
We 're all suitable to our calling , we 're well matched .
Is there anything more , <NAME> ? ' ' Nothing more , ma ' am , ' replied <NAME> , rising .
The world seemed hardly large enough to yield him an amount of travel proportionate to his equipment .
I think I can see him now , a-coming up the <NAME> between the two street-keepers , a little sobered by the bruising , with a patch o ' winegar and brown paper over his right eyelid , and that ' ere lovely bulldog , as pinned the little boy arterwards , a-following at his heels .
' It turns out to be , ' replied <NAME> ; ' but circumstances have changed , you know , my dear .
I ' m too sticky to be kissed .
I have never seen her since .
I ' m sure I ' m quite agreeable , ' with a wretched face , ' for any little bit of gossip , <NAME> .
' More than three hundred pounds .
Regarding , with no small curiosity and interest , all the busy preparations for the coming day which every street and almost every house displayed ; and thinking , now and then , that it seemed rather hard that so many people of all ranks and stations could earn a livelihood in <NAME> , and that he should be
<NAME> Mr Meagles , who was already sensible that he did not advance his daughter ' s happiness by being constantly slighted in her presence , said ' <NAME> , <NAME> !
What happiness ( I thought ) if we were married , and were going away anywhere to live among the trees and in the fields , never growing older , never growing wiser , children ever , rambling hand in hand through sunshine and among flowery meadows , laying down our heads on moss at night , in a
That 's a question I must not be asked .
'So do I , ' rejoined the undertaker .
How well I recollect , when I became quiet , what an unnatural stillness seemed to reign through the whole house !
I have known him come home to supper with a flood of tears , and a declaration that nothing was now left but a jail ; and go to bed making a calculation of the expense of putting bow-windows to the house , ' in case anything turned up ' , which was his favourite expression .
' You _are _swindlers. ' ' Very good , ' said <NAME> .
The child was put out to nurse , a long way off ; his mother never saw him but once or twice , and then by stealth ; and his father -- so eagerly did he thirst after the money which seemed to come almost within his grasp now , for his brother-in-law was very ill , and breaking
' Have the goodness to show <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , what you have in your reticule , <NAME> Murdstone. ' I believe it was the old identical steel-clasped reticule of my childhood , that shut up like a bite .
Stage-coaches were upsetting in all directions , horses were bolting , boats were overturning , and boilers were bursting .
I bought you in open contract. ' ' You can ' t buy human flesh and blood in this country , sir ; not alive , you can ' t , ' says <NAME> , shaking his head .
No , <NAME> , I should think not .
He has answered , ' Not exactly. ' <NAME> was adopted by his mother ?
But that ' s at first , and even if it should never be more , the lovely woman will make it quite enough .
It is not worth troubling so good a heart as yours with. ' ' Pray trouble it , ' returned the other .
Mr <NAME> Wrayburn. ' A worse threat than was conveyed in his manner of uttering the name , could hardly have escaped him .
I beg that you will not move. ' ' I must entreat permission to _move_ , ' returned <NAME> , repeating the word with a charming grace ; ' but I will not withdraw , since you are so obliging .
He had foreseen this , on the former night , when he had dreamed with waking eyes , but he had not felt it then ; and he had now .
He thought of the darkly threatening place that went by the name of <NAME> in his remembrance , and of the gathering shadows which made it yet more darkly threatening than of old .
Not that this would have worried him much , anyway -- he was a mighty free and easy , roving , devil-may-care sort of person , was my uncle , gentlemen .
' Why , bless thee , child , ' said the old man , patting her on the head , ' how couldst thou miss thy way ?
Withers , go on ! ' The Major again pressed to his blue lips the tips of the fingers that were disposed on the ledge of the wheeled chair with careful carelessness , after the <NAME> model : and Mr <NAME> bowed .
" <NAME> , I am quite aware of it .
In the room where the dressing-table stood , and where the wax-candles burnt on the wall , I found <NAME> and <NAME> ; <NAME> seated on a settee near the fire , and <NAME> on a cushion at her feet .
What will be , will be .
' Just wait a moment , <NAME> !
She had employed herself in both ways , at his side under the tree , many and many a time ; but , this time was not quite like any other , and nothing could make it so .
The <NAME> , indeed , considered themselves in a general way as having vested rights in that direction , and took it ill if any other family had much to say to it .
But I saw that everything within my view which ought to be white , had been white long ago , and had lost its lustre and was faded and yellow .
Then he draws in his head and whispers hurriedly but composedly , " <NAME> , <NAME> , this unfortunate family affair has taken air , as I expected it might , the deceased <NAME> being cut down so sudden .
They paced the whole of this place once , in a constrained and uncomfortable manner , when the boy stopped and said : ' <NAME> , Mr Headstone has something to say to you .
You call THAT something to lend ? ' returned <NAME> , with a thoughtful look .
I am to fight my way through the world , I know ; but there are two points I was thinking , as I came along , that I should be very particular about , in respect to my Uncle .
' It ' s perfectly useless , my Lord , attempting to get at any evidence through the impenetrable stupidity of this witness .
I should be able to look after <NAME> 's interests and my own interests ( the same thing !
' Dear Papa , for the sake of my child , for the sake of the name we have given him , for my sake , pardon Walter .
Some men , like bats or owls , have better eyes for the darkness than for the light .
<NAME> dear , good dear , truest , kindest , dearest , were the only words she had for him , as she hushed him to rest .
Bless you , you wouldn ' t believe how much he catches it. ' ' I suppose , ' said <NAME> , ' that they consult together , a good deal , and talk about a great many people -- about me for instance , sometimes , eh , <NAME> ? ' The <NAME> nodded amazingly .
At last , <NAME> 's job was done , and the ringing and roaring stopped .
Perceiving , as <NAME> ' s affronts cumulated , that conciliation by no means answered the purpose here , he now directed a scowling look into <NAME> ' s small eyes for the effect of the opposite treatment .
Give way ! ' ' One word ! ' cried <NAME> , foaming at the mouth .
There was nothing they would n't have cleared away , or could n't have cleared away , with old Fezziwig looking on .
I said that I did not blame him , or suspect him , or mistrust him , but I wanted assurance of the truth from him .
We are a prosperous community , <NAME> , a very prosperous community .
' Ah ! ' he said , with a sigh , ' it ' s a fine thing to understand ' em .
<NAME> is a witness what nervous jerkings I have in my legs .
" My little woman , " said <NAME> , sitting down in the remotest corner by the door , as if he were taking a liberty , " it is not unlikely that you may inquire of me why <NAME> , <NAME> , and a lady call upon us in <NAME> 's Court , <NAME> , at the present
<NAME> escaped the hawk ' s eye of the ugly little man , who , perfectly understanding what passed in the old lady ' s mind , turned uglier still in the fulness of his satisfaction , and bade her good morning , with a leer or triumph .
she says , touching her shoulder with her two forefingers .
' I beg your pardon , ladies , but at that moment he ran some sharp instrument into my leg .
When they had all three amused themselves a little with their victim ' s infatuation , they dismissed the subject as one which had been sufficiently discussed , and began to talk in a jargon which the child did not understand .
He follers her about , he makes hisself a sort o ' servant to her , he loses in a great measure his relish for his wittles , and in the long-run he makes it clear to me wot ' s amiss .
All his fellows stooped to look under the carriage .
He told me , as soon as I came up with him , that having now discharged his mind of what he had purposed doing in <NAME> , he meant ' to set out on his travels ' , that night .
He was there. ' ' Who is he ? ' said <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> used to keep the key of the kitchen door in her pocket , and she always come down at night to take away the candle and rake out the fire .
The child involuntarily did the same .
If a skipper stands out by <NAME> ' <NAME> ' s <NAME> , making for the <NAME> , what ' s right ahead of him ?
says <NAME> with a strong tendency in his clump of hair to stand on end .
Can you spare the time ? ' ' Can I spare the time to walk with you , sir ?
' It is nothing to me. ' ' Isn ' t it ? ' said Squeers in a threatening manner .
' I saw the sudden change that came upon him beneath my gaze .
' I think a moderate stroke , ' he concludes , ' is all I am justified in scoring up ; ' so , suits the action to the word , closes the cupboard , and goes to bed .
That at this sight Mrs. <NAME> dropped the newspaper , and stared more like a figure-head intended for a ship to be called The <NAME> , than anything else I can think of .
What DO you know of him ? '
<NAME> ' ever , go on. ' Well , ' said the cobbler , ' when I was going to take out a probate of the will , the nieces and nevys , who was desperately disappointed at not getting all the money , enters a caveat against it. ' What ' s that ? ' inquired Sam .
'You must be very quiet , or you will be ill again ; and you have been very bad , -- as bad as bad could be , pretty nigh .
I wish him to understand that. ' ' Quite right , quite right , ' said brother Charles .
If <NAME> should chance to be possessed by any lingering curiosity as to <NAME> 's letters , that wary person is not the man to gratify it .
Accordingly I was called out of school next forenoon , and found <NAME> in the parlour ; who had called to say that the dinner would take place as proposed .
' He knows me , ' said brother <NAME> , ' and he knows my brother Ned .
Exactly what was perfectly manifest to me at the moment .
I kissed her , and my baby brother , and was very sorry then ; but not sorry to go away , for the gulf between us was there , and the parting was there , every day .
You ' ll find out when the business passes through each of these stages by asking at both Departments till they tell you. ' ' But surely this is not the way to do the business , ' <NAME> could not help saying .
' I am here to take <NAME> back -- to take him back unconditionally , to dispose of him as I think proper , and to deal with him as I think right .
He then commissioned <NAME> to return with his replies , and gave her the shilling of which the failure of her supplemental enterprise would have disappointed her otherwise .
So remarkable did it seem to <NAME> , that that young lady , at the imminent hazard of having her ear sliced off , had not been able to forbear looking round , some score of times , during the foregoing colloquy .
A wicket gate was close at hand , but there was more than one path across the churchyard to which it led , and , uncertain which to take , they came to a stand again .
But she answered him very steadily .
" Prince has a pupil over the way , <NAME> , " said <NAME> , " and got the key for us .
Because if <NAME> comes to life and does not marry her , the property falls into the very hands that hold it now .
" 'We have been to your residence , ' said the first , 'and not being so fortunate as to find you there , and being informed that you were probably walking in this direction , we followed , in the hope of overtaking you .
The cheese was simmering and browning away , most delightfully , in a little <NAME> oven before the fire ; the pettitoes were getting on deliciously in a little tin saucepan on the hob ; and Mrs. <NAME> and her two friends were getting on very well , also , in a little quiet conversation about and concerning all
The father , with a little boy in his arms , appeared at the door , and they crowded round him , clapping their tiny hands , and dragging him out , to join their joyous sports .
By that time , Mr Carker , though the winner , had mounted high into the <NAME> ' s good opinion , insomuch that when he left the Major at his own room before going to bed , the Major as a special attention , sent the Native -- who always rested on a mattress spread upon the ground
Whether you mightn ' t be a sort of <NAME> to her , and something more ? ' ' I should hope , ' returned <NAME> , with a scornful look and in a loud voice , ' that if I were anything to your wife , sir , I could hardly fail to be something more than <NAME>
My explanation must stop here. ' Although this is but a dry reply to the <NAME> ' s purple enthusiasm , the <NAME> receives it graciously , and is delighted to think that the world has such a fair prospect of soon receiving its due .
Tossing to and fro upon his hot , uneasy bed ; tormented by a fierce thirst which nothing could appease ; unable to find , in any change of posture , a moment ' s peace or ease ; and rambling , ever , through deserts of thought where there was no resting-place , no sight or sound suggestive
'When this woman , that we called old <NAME> , died , ' the matron began , 'she and I were alone . '
This brings me round comfortable , and that brings him round comfortable , and then <NAME> and him and me we all fall a crying for joy. ' ' Yes !
" I have only waited to see that you have everything you want .
He effected such a forced march on leaving the <NAME> that he was close up with him -- that is to say , as close up with him as he deemed it convenient to be -- before another <NAME> was passed .
' Why don ' t you ask the gentleman what he ' ll take ? ' ' Dear me , I quite forgot , ' replied the other .
' You want somebody to send to the <NAME> , you were saying , ' observed Mr Dombey , hurriedly .
<NAME> <NAME> and he interchange a word or two .
<NAME> <NAME> lent me the knife and fork , with his compliments to <NAME> .
By and bye , he began to talk again , inquiring how long he had been there .
For many years their only walks in <NAME> had been taken on Sundays when the shops were shut ; and when every day in the week became their holiday , they derived an enjoyment from the variety and fancy and beauty of the display in the windows , which seemed incapable of exhaustion .
I think I know , for I have considered about it very much since you were here last time .
' Mama , ' faltered <NAME> in tears , ' if I might venture to go ! ' Mr Carker , having his eyes on Edith when he heard these words , gave her a secret look and slightly shook his head .
' I have written to him , ' said my aunt .
' Then you were -- ' faltered <NAME> .
He was so much too big for <NAME> 's , that old clerks in distant corners looked up with looks of remonstrance , as though he squeezed them against the wall .
'Three Cripples , ' repeated <NAME> , 'and a very good sign too .
' Here it is , ' whispered the attorney , as he deposited the money on the hand of their guide .
' I have invited this worthy officer , my dear , ' said <NAME> , ' to make a short excursion with me in which you shall be a sharer .
<NAME> was awakened in the morning , by a loud kicking at the outside of the shop-door : which , before he could huddle on his clothes , was repeated , in an angry and impetuous manner , about twenty-five times .
I have seen the father -- if he is the father -- and I suppose he must be .
' Oh yes , ' rejoined the child , clasping her hands earnestly .
We boldly state , now that we are goaded to the disclosure , and we throw ourselves on the country and its constables for protection -- we boldly state that secret preparations are at this moment in progress for a Buff ball ; which is to be held in a Buff town , in the very heart and centre
Very well and very fast the supper went off ; no more serious difficulties occurring , than those which arose from the incessant demand for clean knives and forks ; which made poor Mrs. Kenwigs wish , more than once , that private society adopted the principle of schools , and required that every guest should bring his own
Late as it was , I meant to go to her for a few minutes before lying down to sleep , but I went home with my guardian first to make his tea for him and to occupy the old chair by his side , for I did not like to think of its being empty so soon .
'This is hardly fair , <NAME> ; hardly fair , is it , <NAME> ? '
<NAME> <NAME> , completely quelled by the decision of the old gentleman ' s manner , took the same course .
" Where they laid him as wos wery good to me , wery good to me indeed , he wos .
In consequence , an ill-natured story got about , that <NAME> ' ly wanted to be a lady .
Homeward he went therefore ; and his apartments ( for he still retained the plural fiction ) being at no great distance from the office , he was soon seated in his own bed-chamber , where , having pulled off one boot and forgotten the other , he fell into deep cogitation .
In fact , my dear Copperfield , I have entered into arrangements , by virtue of which I stand pledged and contracted to our friend <NAME> , to assist and serve him in the capacity of -- and to be -- his confidential clerk. ' I stared at <NAME> , who greatly enjoyed my surprise .
<NAME> <NAME> was out lecturing ; for , he was a most delightful lecturer on domestic economy , and his treatises on the management of children and servants were considered the very best text-books on those themes .
The same intolerable awe and dread that had come upon him in the night , returned unweakened in the day .
My left arm was a good deal burned to the elbow , and , less severely , as high as the shoulder ; it was very painful , but the flames had set in that direction , and I felt thankful it was no worse .
Will you render me a little help ? " " None. " <NAME> spoke , always looking straight before him .
" Perhaps you were acquainted with somebody who was a party in something , ma'am ? "
On this repetition of the old wicked injury , I withheld no longer , but exposed to her all I had known of her and seen in her , and all I had undergone within myself since I had occupied the despicable position of being engaged to her nephew .
Perhaps you ' ve heard them speak of it. ' ' Often , ' rejoined <NAME> , smiling .
No father , no mother , no any one .
We shan ' t be legally for a day or two .
That ' s <NAME> hanging up by the waist , much too near the gaslight for a wax one , with her toes turned in. ' When they had plodded on for some time nigh the river , <NAME> asked the way to a certain tavern called the <NAME> .
But when she saw her looking at once so cheerful and so earnest , and so thoughtful , and so good , she gave a faint little cry of pleased surprise , and just put her affectionate arms round <NAME> ' s neck , and laid her innocent cheek against her face .
Also " -- <NAME> seems to shrink in the shadow of his figure -- " also , to take a seat , if you have no objection . "
'Nobody better than you , I am persuaded , ' answered Mrs. Bumble : who did not want for spirit , as her yoke-fellow could abundantly testify .
She filled my heart with such good resolutions , strengthened my weakness so , by her example , so directed -- I know not how , she was too modest and gentle to advise me in many words -- the wandering ardour and unsettled purpose within me , that all the little good I have done , and all
<NAME> , and begs -- ' " said <NAME> .
' I a lady ! ' <NAME> went on in a low voice , with her eyes upon the fire .
Because you know it ' s so dreadfully cross ! ' ' No , no , ' said I .
<NAME> said nothing at all until he had emptied his snuff-box , and sent <NAME> out to fill it , when he was seized with a fit of laughing , which lasted five minutes ; at the expiration of which time he said that he supposed he ought to be very angry , but he couldn ' t think
' See where he lounges so easily , <NAME> !
' I should be blind and deaf if I were not prepared for the reply .
Shall I tell you why ? ' ' Not if it pains you , ' said <NAME> .
' That is quite understood , <NAME> , and you have spoken piously and well .
These latter necessaries hung upon the walls , which , in that portion of the establishment devoted to the lady of the caravan , were ornamented with such gayer and lighter decorations as a triangle and a couple of well-thumbed tambourines .
They were in their school-room when I came upon them , and answered correctly , without book , such questions as where was <NAME> ; how far was it ; what was its population ; its capital city ; its form of government ; and so forth .
I 'll say no more. " * * And now that I have given the one chapter to the theme that so filled my heart , and so often made it ache and ache again , I pass on unhindered , to the event that had impended over me longer yet ; the event that had begun to be
As he passed <NAME> ' s he stepped aside into a doorway to set his watch , and with his hand on the key and his eye on the cathedral dial , was intent upon so doing , when a man suddenly stopped before him .
" I do n't know what you may be doing here , ladies and gentlemen , " he said , as if he resented our presence , " but you 'll excuse my coming in .
Being advised that the sensible etiquette of the republican court admitted of a traveller , like myself , declining , without any impropriety , an invitation to dinner , which did not reach me until I had concluded my arrangements for leaving <NAME> some days before that to which it referred , I only returned to this house once
' My grand-nephew , that is to say , ' observed my aunt .
' You know you are not in earnest. ' ' I AM in earnest , ' replied <NAME> , aloud , and retreating towards <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> inquires , getting his hat and thick wash-leather gloves .
Neither , I felt convinced , had Mrs. Strong then .
Next day , when we were returning to <NAME> outside the coach , Mrs. Gummidge and her basket were on the seat behind , and Mrs. Gummidge was happy .
The noise ceased at the sound of her voice , and he presently came out to her , and they walked up and down together for a long time .
So the little boy you saw just now waltzes by himself in the empty kitchen , and we distribute the others over the house as well as we can . "
cried the man , fixing his eyes on <NAME> , and suddenly recoiling .
The first objects that assume a distinct presence before me , as I look far back , into the blank of my infancy , are my mother with her pretty hair and youthful shape , and <NAME> with no shape at all , and eyes so dark that they seemed to darken their whole neighbourhood in her face ,
I ' m coming into my property , that ' s the fact .
Gradually I slipped from the chair and lay on the floor .
I subscribe to the club here , but I don ' t play. ' ' The grand match is played to-day , I believe , ' said <NAME> .
' Open , you Bob ! ' <NAME> opened .
' Then just blo ' away into that ' un as lies on the grund , fit to wakken the deead , will ' ee , ' said the man , ' while I stop sum o ' this here squealing inside .
I know no station which has a right to monopolise the means of mutual instruction , improvement , and rational entertainment ; or which has ever continued to be a station very long , after seeking to do so .
Then , and not sooner , I became aware of a strange gentleman leaning over the back of the settle opposite me , looking on .
A slight frown and a laconic " Yes , " were the answer .
I have been so bold as to come on my own account , which I hope you ' ll pardon when I mention the cause .
' My dear <NAME> , ' that lady broke out afresh , after silently contemplating his features for a few moments , ' I don ' t know whether to laugh or cry when I look at you , I declare , you do so remind me of that dear baby upstairs. ' ' Well ! ' said <NAME>
It is its being so old and grey perhaps. ' ' A peaceful place to live in , don ' t you think so ? ' said her friend .
You ' ll want six , ' said the dress-maker .
That set me thinking , and you found me thinking. ' The advent of Mrs. Gummidge with a basket , explained how the house had happened to be empty .
I used to fancy , as I sat by him of an evening , on a green slope , and saw him watch the kite high in the quiet air , that it lifted his mind out of its confusion , and bore it ( such was my boyish thought ) into the skies .
' They will come ; it ' s the dirty work I think , sir -- at least I don ' t know what it is , sir , but it ' s not my fault. ' ' Bolder , ' said <NAME> , tucking up his wristbands , and moistening the palm of his right hand to get
' I shall , soon enough , be put out , though , if anybody tries to domineer it over me : and so I give you notice , master .
Mentally , I have now committed a burglary under the meanest circumstances , and the myrmidons of justice are at my heels. ' ' I am quite as bad , ' said <NAME> , sitting up facing him , with a tumbled head ; after going through some wonderful evolutions , in which his head had been the lowest

But I do think that if you would do a favour for anybody , you would for me , and I won ' t fail for want of trying , and I ' ve passed my promise to Mr Twemlow besides .
He has been going to learn to read them this last quarter of a century , I should judge , from what he tells me . "
<NAME> and barred and moored by massive rusty chains , the prison-ship seemed in my young eyes to be ironed like the prisoners .
I thought I knew why .
Now , you get along to bed ! " I was never allowed a candle to light me to bed , and , as I went upstairs in the dark , with my head tingling , -- from Mrs. <NAME> 's thimble having played the tambourine upon it , to accompany her last words , -- I felt fearfully
We may as well part .
Shall she be handsome ? ' ' Even you can be that , <NAME> , so she ought to be. ' ' She is very handsome. ' ' What does she say about him ? ' asked <NAME> , in a low voice : watchful , through an intervening silence , of the face looking down at the fire
Another idol has displaced me ; and if it can cheer and comfort you in time to come , as I would have tried to do , I have no just cause to grieve . "
The Major hands into a second carriage , <NAME> , and the bridesmaid who so narrowly escaped being given away by mistake , and then enters it himself , and is followed by Mr Carker .
I am too frightened to be left by myself. ' The lustrous gipsy-face drooped over the clinging arms and bosom , and the wild black hair fell down protectingly over the childish form .
<NAME> has a great liking for <NAME> , and it is capital to see them meet , and to observe the glory of <NAME> as he commends the dearest girl in the world to her acquaintance .
You ' re one of a lot of impostors that are the worst lot of all the lots to be met with .
) , and thought how , when <NAME> was in a debtors ' prison , there was a man there with nothing on him but an old rug , the turnkey swam before my dimmed eyes and my beating heart .
" Ah , <NAME> , <NAME> , as many as make an old woman of a young one , I begin to think .
And here if there ain ' t , ' said <NAME> as the door opened , ' if there ain ' t your dear gentleman along with Dr Haggage !
" How glad am I to see you , <NAME> ! "
I have no such intention. ' ' " Shall " is summ ' at of a hard word , <NAME> , ' urged <NAME> , still feebly dodging between him and the door , as he advanced .
' She don ' t care for me !
To this , the magistrate returned a half- audible answer , and then the whispering was renewed .
'Good , ' said the <NAME> ; 'there 's no moon . '
I have heard of such means sometimes .
In the meantime Mrs <NAME> had been out on an errand to a neighbouring establishment decorated with three golden balls , where she was very well known .
" Would it be much out of the way , to take me in , near the great cathedral door between the two towers ? " " No , miss , " answered <NAME> .
The fountain in the village flowed unseen and unheard , and the fountain at the chateau dropped unseen and unheard -- both melting away , like the minutes that were falling from the spring of Time -- through three dark hours .
And she is so very pretty !
' All right , sir , ' said <NAME> .
Something -- I don ' t know what , or how -- connected with the grave in the churchyard , and the raising of the dead , seemed to strike me like an unwholesome wind .
Their recommendation of Mrs <NAME> had great weight with him ; for he knew that they were jealous of any interference with their charge , and he never for a moment took it into account that they might be solicitous to divide a responsibility , of which he had , as shown just now , his own established views
There was something very impressive in the ghostly air with which all this was done ; and as <NAME> was a tall lank gentleman of solemn features , wearing spectacles , and garnished with much less hair than a gentleman bordering on forty , or thereabouts , usually boasts , <NAME> whispered her daughter that she thought he must
" And I go into the business with you -- very pleasant we are over it ; and I confirm you in your well-founded fears that you will get yourself into a most precious line if you do n't come out with that there will , " said <NAME> emphatically ; " and accordingly you arrange with me that
But I scarcely know how , even now. ' ' Mr Gowan , ' said <NAME> , ' has reason to be very happy .
Still in the same moment , I saw that the face disclosed , was the face of the other convict of long ago .
His feelings are worked upon .

I know you do , I know you do .
There was a sharp bracing air ; the ground was dry ; the sea was crisp and clear ; the sun was diffusing abundance of light , if not much warmth ; and everything was fresh and lively .
My wife was a foreman 's daughter , and plainly brought up .
You needn ' t bring ME in , please. ' ' And it ' s all very well aiming at others through convenient me , ' said the irrepressible <NAME> , spitefully ; ' but I should like to ask <NAME> what he says to it. ' ' Mr <NAME> , ' proclaimed <NAME> , seeing that young gentleman
' We are all friends here , I presume ? ' said <NAME> , clearing his voice , and looking towards the man of few words with the surly countenance , who drove the fly with the chubby horse .
Whose can it be but mine ? ' ' Yes , I thought it was yours , ' said Mr Sparkler .
We waited for <NAME> , and he made no sign .
cried the matron , with a gesture as if she would call for help .
<NAME> <NAME> looked at <NAME> for advice in this important crisis , who said , " If you please , ma'am , you had better tell then , " and therein gratified <NAME> beyond measure .
There was Mrs Tickit , only yesterday , when her little grandchild was with her , had been amused by the child ' s trying to call her ( <NAME> ) by the wretched name we gave her ; and had laughed at the name .
She was a loving baby -- I know that ; I knew it , years before you ever saw her -- and through the best part of her weakness you gave her the wounds she died of .
What have I done ? ' ' Let me go away , <NAME> .
'He ought to have been , a many times , ' replied the jailer .
She was quiet once more .
She would regularly change the ice , or the cooling spirit , on his head , and would keep her ear at the pillow betweenwhiles , listening for any faint words that fell from him in his wanderings .
' Good-bye for the present , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , calling out a hearty parting .
" What of that , my dear ! "
On a moderate computation , it was many months , that Sunday , since I had left <NAME> and <NAME> .
<NAME> took out her handkerchief , and rather angrily wiped her eyes .
Accordingly , she polished the tablets , pointed the pencil , bought an immense account-book , carefully stitched up with a needle and thread all the leaves of the <NAME> which <NAME> had torn , and made quite a desperate little attempt ' to be good ' , as she called it .
That would protract the mental uneasiness of Mr Venus too long , he said .
For a few moments they stood motionless .
She looked at him , as he ran over the possibilities of some result he had not intended , and could not foresee , being influenced by <NAME> ' s disclosure becoming a matter of notoriety , and hurriedly arrived at the conclusion that it had best not be talked about ; though perhaps he was guided by no
" <NAME> , you did well , " said the <NAME> , felicitously sensible that such vermin were not to ruffle him , " to see a thief accompanying my carriage , and not open that great mouth of yours .
I think he loves me , ' cried the child wildly .
What do you say ? " " <NAME> long would you keep me in town ? " " Oh !
I have often seen these among old <NAME> people and <NAME> .
On the approach of the Sunday which was to witness the last of those askings in church of which the <NAME> had spoken , Mr Toots thus stated his feelings to <NAME> .
I know I ' ve been a going wrong , <NAME> , ever since I took to bird-catching and walking-matching .
Mr <NAME> rose into new distinction in virtue of being specially remembered in the letter .
Mrs General ' s communication of this idea to her clerical and commissariat connection was so warmly applauded that , but for the lady ' s undoubted merit , it might have appeared as though they wanted to get rid of her .
if those who rule the destinies of nations would but remember this -- if they would but think how hard it is for the very poor to have engendered in their hearts , that love of home from which all domestic virtues spring , when they live in dense and squalid masses where social decency is lost , or
The means of corruption , wretchedness , and misery .
But it really is doubly and trebly hard to have crowds and multitudes of people turning up after him ( I could have forgiven him ) , to take <NAME> 's affections away from me. " <NAME> knew <NAME> to be very jealous , but he also knew her by this time to be , beneath the service of
' How ' s she looking , <NAME> ? ' <NAME> ' s concentrated face again includes the portrait as he returns : ' Very like your sketch indeed. ' ' I _am_ a little proud of it , ' says the young fellow , glancing up at the sketch with complacency , and then shutting one eye ,
<NAME> <NAME> is attached to no particular denomination and is considered by his persecutors to have nothing so very remarkable to say on the greatest of subjects as to render his volunteering , on his own account , at all incumbent on his conscience ; but he has his followers , and Mrs. Snagsby is of the number .
Above all , he saw that men like himself , who snarled at the mirth and cheerfulness of others , were the foulest weeds on the fair surface of the earth ; and setting all the good of the world against the evil , he came to the conclusion that it was a very decent and respectable sort of
I have no doubt that the gentleman who presided over this establishment at the time I write of , was competent to manage it , and had done all in his power to promote its usefulness : but will it be believed that the miserable strife of <NAME> feeling is carried even into this sad refuge of afflicted and
And yet he hailed the morning on which he had resolved to quit <NAME> , with a light heart , and sprang from his bed with an elasticity of spirit which is happily the lot of young persons , or the world would never be stocked with old ones .
It ' s not a long one -- <NAME> Quilp. ' ' Harkee , Mr Quilp , then , ' pursued the other , ' You have some influence with my grandfather there. ' ' Some , ' said Mr Quilp emphatically .
' Wish I may die if I know what to be up to with this chap ! ' said <NAME> , after staring at him , and tossing his last glassful down his throat .
They had walked some distance , <NAME> trotting on before , plunged in profound meditation , and <NAME> following behind , with a countenance expressive of the most enviable and easy defiance of everything and everybody , when the latter , who was always especially anxious to impart to his master any exclusive information he possessed , quickened his
They fell back a little , and looked up at the windows , which were mere black patches in the whitened house front .
And so , a graceless orphan , training to be a singing girl , carries it , by that <NAME> ' s agency , against me , and I am humbled and deceived ! -- Not I , that is to say , ' she added quickly , as colour flushed into her face ; ' a greater than
When a breeze from the country that has lost its way takes fright and makes a blind hurry to rush out again , it flings as much dust in the eyes of Allegory as the law -- or <NAME> , one of its trustiest representatives -- may scatter , on occasion , in the eyes of the laity .
' We are in excellent time , ' said <NAME> , as they climbed the fence of the first field ; ' the sun is just going down. ' <NAME> looked up at the declining orb and painfully thought of the probability of his ' going down ' himself , before long .
Its internal accommodations amply fulfilled the promise of the outside .
" I do n't take to <NAME> , " said he , smiling , " for it sounds like a moral boy out of the spelling-book , who was so lazy that he fell into a pond , or so fat that he could n't see out of his eyes , or so avaricious that he locked up his
Having gone through this very extraordinary performance , he took off the cocked hat again , and , spreading himself before the fire with his back towards it , seemed to be mentally engaged in taking an exact inventory of the furniture .
Your touch is dreadful to me ! ' ' I have done this , ' pursued the other , with her eager look , regardless of the interruption .
Here , too , the bride ' s aunt and next relation ; a widowed female of a <NAME> sort , in a stoney cap , glaring petrifaction at her fellow-creatures .
<NAME> laughed to that degree , that it was impossible for me to help laughing too ; though I am not sure I should have done so , but for this inducement .
I was very much depressed in spirits ; very solitary ; and felt an uneasiness in <NAME> ' s not being there , disproportionate to the occasion .
Little <NAME> , though of the unheroic modern stock and mere <NAME> , did much more , in comforting her father ' s wasted heart upon her innocent breast , and turning to it a fountain of love and fidelity that never ran dry or waned through all his years of famine .
This singular performance was repeated , to the ever-increasing admiration of the spectators , at the end of every succeeding article of Mr <NAME> ' s oration .
' Where , ma ' am ? ' ' In Ipswich. ' In <NAME> , ma ' am !
Have you rung the bell ? "
It was with feelings of no small astonishment , when the carriage drew up before the door with the red lamp , and the very legible inscription of ' Sawyer , late Nockemorf , ' that <NAME> saw , on popping his head out of the coach window , the boy in the gray livery very busily employed in
You came through them charmingly , sir ! ' I acknowledged this compliment , and ordered the negus , which was soon produced .
There used to be stories about his having hidden all kinds of property in those dust mounds .
<NAME> <NAME> says , ' Thank you both very much , ' and follows the double example .
He is a functionary whose existence , in the natural course of things , would have terminated about two hundred years ago .
Again , the dreaded Sunday comes round , and I file into the old pew first , like a guarded captive brought to a condemned service .
What could I think -- what DID I think -- but that you were a young libertine in everything but experience , and had fallen into hands that had experience enough , and could manage you ( having the fancy ) for your own good ?
' <NAME> , this is a change from your old active habits. ' ' The world has narrowed to these dimensions , <NAME> , ' she replied , glancing round the room .
At length <NAME> began to dream that he was at a club , and that the members being very refractory , the chairman was obliged to hammer the table a good deal to preserve order ; then he had a confused notion of an auction room where there were no bidders , and the auctioneer was buying everything in
" My intention was to remark , miss , " said <NAME> , " dear me -- something bronchial , I think -- hem ! -- to remark that you was so good on that occasion as to repel and repudiate that declaration .
I ask you nothing but what your own emphasis suggests .
' That would be too severe a trial , even for your willing legs , ' said <NAME> , with a good-humoured smile .
Even the matter immediately in hand was of very little moment as requiring personal appearance on the Secretary ' s part , for it amounted to no more than this : -- The death of <NAME> rendering the sweat of the honest man ' s brow unprofitable , the honest man had shufflingly declined to moisten his brow for
<NAME> , ' returned <NAME> , ' your confidence is not , at the existing juncture , ill-bestowed .
I thought a little while about this old love story in the night , when I was awakened by <NAME> 's lusty snoring ; and I tried to do that very difficult thing , imagine old people young again and invested with the graces of youth .
Is this public business ? ' asked <NAME> junior .
The subject still held them when <NAME> came in from his work to have a cup of tea .
Did you marry money ? ' ' You know I didn ' t , my dear. ' <NAME> hummed the <NAME> March in <NAME> , and said , after all it signified very little !
But for a glass or two of sherry , I do n't think I could have had my mind so much upon the stretch as it has been .
But , surely , he might not detain Mr Merdle while he assumed his coat ?
" Then , " said I , " after all , stopping short here , never taking another penny from him , think what I owe him already !
The winter passing on towards the spring while this condition of affairs prevailed , it became necessary for Mr Sparkler to repair to <NAME> , and take his appointed part in the expression and direction of its genius , learning , commerce , spirit , and sense .
' Dinnot be afeared on it .
Once , I remember carrying my own bread ( which I had brought from home in the morning ) under my arm , wrapped in a piece of paper , like a book , and going to a famous alamode beef-house near <NAME> , and ordering a ' small plate ' of that delicacy to eat with it .
But at all events , <NAME> -- I may call you <NAME> ? "
That ' s the question. ' ' I felt that to be the question , ' he returned , ' and therefore I arranged that you should come with me and look at it , to-morrow morning. ' Appointment made , accordingly , for <NAME> to go up with him to-morrow morning ; <NAME> kissed ; and <NAME> delighted
' It is , as you say , quite a form to ask .
The service commenced with a hymn , to which succeeded an extemporary prayer .

Say to-morrow. ' ' I shall come here early , mind , <NAME> , ' stipulated the <NAME> .
' One always begins to forgive a place as soon as it ' s left behind ; I dare say a prisoner begins to relent towards his prison , after he is let out. ' They were about thirty in company , and all talking ; but necessarily in groups .
' My dear , ' returned the <NAME> , stopping short in his trot .
But what did I think ?
As there appeared to be some doubt in the mind of his patron how he could best join in this conversation , the indefatigable <NAME> threw himself into the breach , and , by way of saying something to the point , inquired -- with reference to the aforesaid medicine -- whether it was nice .
" It is relating , " says <NAME> in a mysterious low voice , " it is relating -- not to put too fine a point upon it -- to the foreigner , sir ! "
I trust , my dear , I am always open to discussion. ' There was a vibration in the old lady ' s cap , as though she internally added : ' and I should like to see the discussion that would change _my_ mind ! ' ' Very good , <NAME> , ' said her conciliatory son .
God bless you ! ' If the thought ever entered <NAME> ' s head that night , that he could give her up lightly now in his prosperity , and when he had it in his mind to replace her with a second wife , she drove it away .
I scarcely knew him again , he was so uncommonly smart .
With these exceptions , there was neither sight nor sound of any living thing ; and often , when it grew dark , and he was tired of wandering from room to room , he would crouch in the corner of the passage by the street-door , to be as near living people as he could ; and would
' A dozen men about us saw the blow. ' ' Tomorrow will be ample time , ' said the friend .
' Yes , yes ; drownded , ' said the <NAME> , soothingly ; ' as I was saying , if he could be here he ' d beg and pray of you , my precious , to pick a leetle bit , with a look-out for your own sweet health .
How do you find <NAME> C. looking , <NAME> ? "
During this short interchange of sentiments , <NAME> had , in an abstracted mood , uncorked the bottle .
The address was solemn and impressive ; the sentence fearful to hear .
I HOPE it ' s not uncharitable to remember that last Christmas Eve she drank eleven cups of tea , and grumbled all the time .
I copied them last night while he was writing. ' ' Don ' t show ' em to me , <NAME> , if you please , ' returned <NAME> , ' I ' d as soon see <NAME> Pipchin. ' ' I want you to buy them for me , <NAME> , if you will , tomorrow morning .
At length , when this determination had been announced half a hundred times , the old lady suddenly bridling up and looking very majestic , wished to know what she had done that no respect was to be paid to her years or station , and that she should be obliged to beg and pray , in that way
We agreed that his remaining many days in his present hazard was not to be thought of .
<NAME> and merry was the time ; and right gay and merry were at least four of the numerous hearts that were gladdened by its coming .
The rigid , upturned , marble feet too , he remembered well .
Now , the question is , whether these men are justified by the fact ; if not , in what situation do they place themselves ? '
At length there sauntered up , on the opposite side of the way -- with a bad pretense of passing by accident -- a figure conspicuous for its dirty smartness , which after a great many frowns and jerks of the head , in resistance of the invitation , ultimately crossed the road and was brought into the shop
Her nature was represented to us , when we engaged her , as being feebly expressed in her name .
It is , what can I do for my partner , how can I best make reparation to him ? ' ' I am afraid , sir , do you know , ' argued Mr Rugg persuasively , ' that you are still allowing your feeling to be worked upon .
There must be hours of night to temper down the day ' s distraction of so feverish a place .
At this moment , the bell rang .
I ' ve no patience with it ! ' Here this exemplary female , who has pumped up so much fortitude and virtue from the depths of the <NAME> mines , rises from her cushioned property to see <NAME> to the door .
And I am sure that at all times it will give me pleasure -- really pleasure now -- to have you , Mrs. <NAME> , to see me in this plain and homely manner .
' I almost made up my mind never to speak to you again. ' ' A ' most ! ' said <NAME> , with a broader grin than the last .
But it would be extremely difficult to replace <NAME> Bazzard. ' ' He must be very fond of you , ' said <NAME> .
Upon my soul I am not .
" I thought you had gone to <NAME> at least instead of coming here , " says <NAME> .
" No doubt that 's the cause .
' Are you unwell , <NAME> ? ' whispered <NAME> .
They are much inclined to moralise .
The <NAME> , who objects as a matter of principle to everything that occurs on the premises , necessarily objects to the match ; but his consent has been dispensed with , and a spring-van is delivering its load of greenhouse plants at the door , in order that to-morrow ' s feast may be crowned with flowers .
<NAME> , I hoped when I came in here that I might be under no necessity of commenting on the introduction of platform manners or platform manœuvres among the decent forbearances of private life .
I am wretched in argument , but surely this is so , dear Mr and <NAME> ? ' Still , neither Mr and <NAME> said a word .
" Good ! " said the sleeper , rising on his elbow .
The constancy of his attendance never touched <NAME> : though he was so inseparable from <NAME> , that , when that gentleman wished for a change of society , he was under the irksome necessity of gliding out like a conspirator in disguised boats and by secret doors and back ways ; though he was so solicitous to know
<NAME> thinks that if ever there was a good man who belied his appearance , that man is <NAME> .
" So much the poorer you ; so much the richer I !

Nor was their belief much shaken by repeated intelligence which came over in course of time , that an old man who wore the tie of his neckcloth under one ear , and who was very well known to be an Englishman , consorted with the <NAME> on the quaint banks of the canals of the <NAME> and in
Do you know ? ' ' Yes , I know where he is , but he won ' t thank me for telling you , ' replied the laundress .
Have you found it ? " " Here it is , " said <NAME> .
Well , <NAME> , and how are you ?
' Perhaps not , and yet may have enough to be afraid of too , ' he answered .
I regret it , but I can bear it. ' ' Micawber ! ' exclaimed Mrs. Micawber , in tears .
My sister 's bringing up had made me sensitive .
' I am ruined , my dear Trot !
'He has not peached so far , ' said the Jew as he pursued his occupation .
Would <NAME> be considered intrusive ?
Once or twice he felt tempted to repair to <NAME> at all hazards without an hour ' s delay , but a little reflection assured him that if such a step were necessary , <NAME> would have spoken out and told him so at once .
There appeared before them , at this juncture , going in the same direction as themselves , a traveller on foot , who , with a portmanteau strapped to his back , leaned upon a stout stick as he walked , and read from a book which he held in his other hand .
The lady of the caravan then bade him come up the steps likewise , but the drum proving an inconvenient table for two , they descended again , and sat upon the grass , where she handed down to them the tea-tray , the bread and butter , the knuckle of ham , and in short everything of which
I wish I may die if I do !
Solitary fields , divided by hedges and ditches , through many of which he had crashed and scrambled in his flight , skirted the road , both by the way he had come and upon the opposite side .
' And in that conversation— ' ' It is not necessary to repeat its tenor , <NAME> .
That ' s my dooty evermore. ' He shook his head when I asked him where he would seek her , and inquired if I were going to <NAME> tomorrow ?
' When was it , that I first began ?
They were not well suited to each other in age or character , and they had no children to moderate between them .
And Mrs. <NAME> got behind her eyebrows and meditated in the gloom of that retreat , all the evening .
In going , he had to face <NAME> .
However , I began , with the assistance of the son of a professional man , who had been to <NAME> -- <NAME> , with his nose on one side .
' <NAME> was injudicious , <NAME> , ' said my aunt , ' but well meant .
" And he would probably add , 'Is there such a thing as principle , <NAME> ? ' "
They bury soldiers to it , so it 's the natural end of the subject .
'What a precious muddle-headed chap you are ! '

My aunt was deeply interested in them , and walked up and down the room with her arms folded , for more than two hours afterwards .
That first unlucky obligation , I have paid .
I was almost tempted that evening to tell <NAME> about pretty little Em ' ly , but I was too timid of mentioning her name , and too much afraid of his laughing at me .
I have therefore forborne to mention them to <NAME> ' s father ' ; looking severely at him -- ' knowing how little disposition there usually is in such cases , to acknowledge the conscientious discharge of duty. ' <NAME> seemed quite cowed by the gentlemanly sternness of <NAME> ' s manner , and deprecated her severity with a

With these last words , the <NAME> suffered himself to be led off by the collar ; threatening , till he got into the yard , to make a parliamentary business of it ; and then grinning in the officer 's face , with great glee and self-approval .
" There has been a discovery there to-day .
At all events , my love , " said I , " <NAME> is in an agitated state of mind , and must be answered .
I say , ' continued <NAME> , checking off each position on a different finger , as he laid it down -- ' I say that nobody but you can rescue her from this den of wretchedness ; and that you can only do that , by paying the costs of this suit -- both of plaintive and defendant

From that night there grew up in my breast a feeling for <NAME> which I can not very well define .
I must n't go to <NAME> , the solicitor in <NAME> 's <NAME> , and say to him when he makes me furious by being so cool and satisfied -- as they all do , for I know they gain by it while I lose , do n't I ? -- I must n't say to him , '
' Where are you going , <NAME> ? ' said <NAME> , vainly struggling in the powerful grasp of his old enemy .
Not one of the three could have said , from anything he saw , what either of the other two was like ; and each was hidden under almost as many wrappers from the eyes of the mind , as from the eyes of the body , of his two companions .
You have heard him speak , and have looked upon his face .
You have been far too kind and good to me always. ' ' Miss Dombey , ' returned Mr Toots , ' your consideration for my feelings is a part of your angelic character .
I don ' t want , as I raise myself to shake you off , <NAME> .
To these pursuits , multifarious as they were , the little doctor added a more important one than any -- he was indefatigable in paying the most unremitting and devoted attention to a little old widow , whose rich dress and profusion of ornament bespoke her a most desirable addition to a limited income .
Am I leading up to it right ? ' ' Could not approve , sweet Pa , ' said <NAME> , with a tearful laugh and a joyful kiss .
In his coldly easy way with all of them , and with me , and with the whole subject , I saw it clearly .
I have no more to say . "
She hesitated a moment , and then sat down beside me , and laid her hand on mine .
'No evil wind at all , my dear , for evil winds blow nobody any good ; and I 've brought something good with me , that you 'll be glad to see .
We all became very anxious and impatient , when we sat down to breakfast .
You have been already measured for your mourning , haven ' t you , <NAME> ? ' ' Ye -- es , <NAME> ' am , ' sobbed <NAME> .
The wind was blowing so hard when the visitor came out at the shop-door into the darkness and dirt of <NAME> , that it almost blew him in again .
One gentleman on board had a letter of introduction to me from a mutual friend in <NAME> .
To know that he is always keeping a secret from her , that he has under all circumstances to conceal and hold fast a tender double tooth , which her sharpness is ever ready to twist out of his head , gives <NAME> , in her dentistical presence , much of the air of a dog who has a
All these things passed rapidly through <NAME> ' s mind as he sat drinking the hot punch by the roaring fire , and he felt very justly and properly indignant that the tall man should be in a fair way of keeping such an excellent house , while he , <NAME> , was as far off from it as
We have run away together often , before now ; haven ' t we , <NAME> ? ' ' Ah , to be sure we have !
This must be a strange night to you , standing alone here with your counterpart on these street stones ? " " I hardly seem yet , " returned <NAME> , " to belong to this world again. " " I do n't wonder at it ; it 's not so long since you were pretty far advanced on
" I suppose the <NAME> , and the <NAME> , and the whole Chancery battery of great guns would be infinitely astonished by such unreason and injustice in one of their suitors , " pursued my guardian .
That young gentleman , incapable , in his state of mind , of remaining alone in the churchyard , a prey to solitary meditation , and also desirous , no doubt , of testifying his respect for the offices he had in some measure interrupted , suddenly returned -- not coming back to the pew , but stationing himself
It was an aggravating circumstance in the case that he had no idea of this , but conceived that he was making me amends in every new discovery : not to say , heaping obligations on my head .
<NAME> , <NAME> , for <NAME> ' s sake ! ' and tottered back to her chair with an amazing imitation of being in danger of swooning , in the dread surprise and maidenly flutter of her spirits .
<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> was of the most affectionate description ; <NAME> and <NAME> exchanged snuff-boxes , and looked very much like a pair of <NAME> -- ' Monarchs of all they surveyed. ' While the aristocracy of the place -- the <NAME> , and <NAME> , and <NAME> -- were thus preserving their dignity at the upper end
I think we have no new disciples in our little portico , my dear , ' says <NAME> to <NAME> , ' since Mr <NAME> left us. ' ' Except Bitherstone , ' returns <NAME> .
Just half a minute , my young friend , and we ' ll give you a polishing that shall keep your curls on for the next ten years ! ' With this , she tilted some of the contents of the little bottle on to one of the little bits of flannel , and , again imparting some of
' How do you do , Mr <NAME> ? ' ' How do you do , <NAME> ? ' said <NAME> .
Others had to tell of country people , coming in from neighbouring villages , who had seen great trees lying torn out of the earth , and whole ricks scattered about the roads and fields .
'Hanging a few of them at least , in all probability , ' suggested the doctor , 'and transporting the rest . '
' <NAME> , ' said Mr Toots .
It was a remarkable instance of want of forethought on the part of the ironmonger who had made Mrs. Crupp ' s kitchen fireplace , that it was capable of cooking nothing but chops and mashed potatoes .
' A good place , <NAME> , eh ? ' said she .
' Are you married ? ' inquired the dirty-faced man .
The dark-complexioned men who wear large rings , and heavy watch-guards , and bushy whiskers , and who congregate under the <NAME> , and about the box-office in the season , between four and five in the afternoon , when they give away the orders , -- all live in <NAME> , or within a street of it .
Let him give no heed to what I ha had ' n to bear .
'And the least given to peaching , ' added <NAME> .
Sometimes , there was the clash of armour , and the gleaming of the moon on caps of steel ; and , at others , jaded coursers were spurred up to the gate , and a female form glided hurriedly forth , as if eager to demand tidings of the weary messenger .
' You will blame me , the world will blame me , the women will blame me ; everybody will laugh , and scoff , and smile , and grin most demnebly .
<NAME> , that you sent for to- night , you know. " ' " Ah ! " said the invalid , passing his hand across his forehead ; " <NAME> -- <NAME> -- let me see. " He seemed endeavouring to collect his thoughts for a few seconds , and then grasping me tightly by the wrist said ,
I felt then , for the first time , that I had lost <NAME> .
He is accordingly visited by <NAME> a great many times in the course of the year .
I should have said , " <NAME> !
<NAME> was a mincing young lady of fifty , and <NAME> ' s apartment was the gilt frame downstairs on a larger scale and something dirtier .
The unkindled lamp stood on the table .
Only say you ' ll try him .
<NAME> way shall I use it ?
Have you considered my suggestion , <NAME> ? ' This in a lower voice , but only as if it were a graver matter ; not at all to the exclusion of the person of the house .
What ' s your name , sir ? ' ' Here is my card , sir , ' replied <NAME> , much amused by the abruptness of the question , and the singular manner of the stranger .
He was very , very ill sometimes .
This great point attained , <NAME> argued the question of the allowance , and Mr Mantalini did the same , taking occasion to show that he could live with uncommon satisfaction upon bread and water , and go clad in rags , but that he could not support existence with the additional burden of being mistrusted by the object
A supper-table was laid for two , in the third of the rooms ; a round room , in one of the chateau 's four extinguisher-topped towers .
At length these subjects displayed signs of being thoroughly exhausted ; and <NAME> did the same : for the house of correction becomes fatiguing after a week or two .
If there were a warm place in his frosty heart , his son occupied it ; if its very hard surface could receive the impression of any image , the image of that son was there ; though not so much as an infant , or as a boy , but as a grown man -- the ' <NAME>
Whether their separation -- ' Mr <NAME> said no more , but sat silent .
The Secretary gave her such a radiant look , that if he had thanked her a hundred times , he could not have said as much as the look said .
My eyes were fixed on the ladder against the wall , when I came to myself , -- had opened on it before my mind saw it , -- and thus as I recovered consciousness , I knew that I was in the place where I had lost it .
The middle-aged lady had finished arranging her hair ; had carefully enveloped it in a muslin nightcap with a small plaited border ; and was gazing pensively on the fire .
His name was originally <NAME> ; but it had been converted , by an easy transition , into <NAME> : the lady rightly considering that an <NAME> appellation would be of serious injury to the business .
This was the man who had been foremost in the plot to ensnare me , and grasp my wealth .
When shall we give <NAME> its mistress , little woman ? "
From the earliest moment of his engagement he showed a particular desire to please her , and , knowing her to have this object at heart , he followed it up with unwearying alacrity and interest .
' Do you call it managing this establishment , <NAME> , ' said Mr Dombey , ' to leave a person like this at liberty to come and talk to me !
<NAME> my body , make haste !
But I do not repent , nor am I unhappy .
' I ' ll hear no more , ' said <NAME> , hurriedly ; ' I have heard too much -- more than I should -- already .
He now contracted , being silent , into a half-repressed gush of tears , and , under pretence of being heated , drew the under part of his sleeve across his eyes with a singularly awkward , laborious , and roundabout smear .
They both smoked , for some seconds , in silence .
' Besides , ' continued <NAME> , not noticing the interruption , ' that ' s a wery different thing .
' Afraid of him , ' he said then , looking round upon them all .
I have stated to the magistrates , 'Gentlemen , I am as innocent of this charge as yourselves ; what has been stated against me in the way of facts is perfectly true ; I know no more about it . '
C. " stand for -- <NAME> , eh ? ' <NAME> , with rising indignation and great importance , explained the mystic device .
It is muffled and dreary .
But the surgeon who held the watch , declared five minutes not to have elapsed yet , and sternly admonished them to keep silence .
How does that tune go that the sailors sing ?
When I brought what remained of him home here , the brains seemed to me to have been blown out of the house too , it was so shattered and ruined . "
' There , take it ; it ' s more than you deserve. ' With these words , after many pretty little coquettish doubts and fears , and wishes that she might not have lost it , <NAME> produced the letter from behind the nicest little muslin tucker possible , and handed it to <NAME> , who thereupon kissed
He would think so all the more if he saw the woman thus hurrying up and down for hours , without fatigue , without intermission , followed by the faithful step upon the <NAME> 's Walk .
If the coming up this river , slowly making head against the stream , be an irksome journey , the shooting down it with the turbid current is almost worse ; for then the boat , proceeding at the rate of twelve or fifteen miles an hour , has to force its passage through a labyrinth of floating logs
You 'll be a fine young cracksman afore the old file now . '
The help that my dear counted on did come to her , though it came , in the eternal wisdom , for another purpose .
" That 's the state of the case , for that much I 've seen myself. " And then they both stared at me , and I , with an obtrusive show of artlessness on my countenance , stared at them , and plaited the right leg of my trousers with my right hand .
' I can ' t ! ' <NAME> said ' indeed ' in a tone which might imply , either that she was reasonably surprised to find the genuine and only <NAME> , who was the delight of the <NAME> and <NAME> and the peculiar pet of the <NAME> , destitute of these familiar arts ; or that she
You are playing <NAME> with my clerk , are you , <NAME> ?
When a most amiable person , with a highly polished bald head , asked me across the dinner table , if that were the first occasion of my seeing the grounds , I could have done anything to him that was savage and revengeful .
I ' ll borrow ' t for t ' pay ' t back .
<NAME> by little , she receded from <NAME> , like the retiring ghost of what she had been ; little by little , the chasm between them widened and seemed deeper ; little by little , all the power of earnestness and tenderness she had shown , was frozen up in the bold , angry hardihood with which she
" And I saw pistols in it , -- and jam , -- and pills .

For the rest , she knew that after office-hours , she reigned supreme over all the office furniture , and over a locked-up iron room with three locks , against the door of which strong chamber the light porter laid his head every night , on a truckle bed , that disappeared at cockcrow .
But they are blotted out .
I ' ll tell you what ; if I found out that any man had been tampering with the affections of my daughter , I wouldn ' t talk .
We had observed before that when she looked at it she covered her discoloured eye with her hand , as though she wished to separate any association with noise and violence and ill treatment from the poor little child .
The rain fell fast , and the wind blew hard ; and straying out on the house-top by that stormy bedroom of his old friend , to take an observation of the weather , the <NAME> ' s heart died within him , when he saw how wild and desolate it was .
But it 's impossible for an old vagabond comrade to like your wife and family better than I like 'em , <NAME> , and I trust you 'll look upon me as forgivingly as you can .
We certainly had not been , and at that time as certainly we were not either attended or followed by any boat .
No , I must say that much , <NAME> .
<NAME> ' s anxieties , however , were of a deeper kind , and the checks they imposed upon her cheerfulness were not so easily removed .
He came back as the door was opened , and announced that he believed he had identified ' his governor ' s tile. ' He was not mistaken , for his governor , with his tile in his hand , was introduced immediately afterwards .
But , in his own tongue , and in his own head , Mr <NAME> was a clear , shrewd , persevering man .
" You wouldn ' t marry for some money and some station , because you were frightfully likely to become bored .
<NAME> <NAME> was busily engaged in counting the barrels of oysters and superintending the disinterment of the cod-fish , when he felt himself gently pulled by the skirts of the coat .
<NAME> <NAME> , tell me that you ' ll stay amongst us .
When all this was done to the magistrate ' s satisfaction , the magistrate and <NAME> consulted in whispers .
Having given us one glance out of the watching corner of his eye , and having given his nose one triumphant rub with his forefinger , <NAME> stood with his eyes fastened on his confidential friend and his hand stretched forth ready to take the paper and present it to my guardian .
<NAME> , split and crushed under foot , lay about everywhere .
' I am quite afraid of you , ' said the baronet .
<NAME> for three , directly ; and keep the horses back for a quarter of an hour .
All day long he was running towers up , taking towers down , adding a wing here , putting on a battlement there , looking to the walls , strengthening the defences , giving ornamental touches to the interior , making in all respects a superb castle of it .
And with his cumbrous and uneasy action he stiffly offered her his arm .
Near <NAME> , ' was <NAME> ' s answer .
' Charming creature , isn ' t she , <NAME> ? ' said <NAME> , rubbing her hands together .
' I suppose , ' said <NAME> , as she closed the door slowly , and peeped into the room again , to make sure that he was comfortable , ' I suppose there ' s nothing left -- not so much as a waistcoat even ? ' ' <NAME> , nothing. ' ' It ' s embarrassing ,
When <NAME> wrote to tell me of her safe arrival , I was as miserable as when I saw her going away .
' I try your love too much .
The young man sat looking at the fire with a face of listening curiosity , ready to check him off and catch him tripping .
No doubt , ' returned the other , lifting his dim eyes to his face .
' Whose ears have been poisoned by you , ' said <NAME> ; ' by you -- who , under pretence of deserving the thanks she poured upon you , heaped every insult , wrong , and indignity upon my head .
All this was seen in a moment , as the vision of a drowning man , or of any human creature at any very great pass , could see a world if it were there .
The candle , wasted by the draught , was standing where it had been placed .
But love is quick to know when it is spurned and hopeless : and hope died out of hers , as she stood looking in her father ' s face .
' That ' s a de-vilish ambitious woman , Sir. ' Mr <NAME> said ' Indeed ? ' with frigid indifference : mingled perhaps with some contemptuous incredulity as to <NAME> having the presumption to harbour such a superior quality .
But the <NAME> flashed such golden prospects before his dim sight : hinted so mysteriously at <NAME> consequences ; laid such emphasis on what <NAME> had just now told them : and appealed to it so confidently as a corroboration of his predictions , and a great advance towards the realisation of the romantic legend of <NAME> : that
What a degraded and vile sight it is ! " They had been treating their guard , I suppose , for they had a gaoler with them , and all three came out wiping their mouths on their hands .
He says , as they stand upon the steps watching the young couple away , that she has a pretty figure , hasn ' t she , and as well as he could see ( for she held her head down coming out ) , an uncommon pretty face .
The principal gentleman who officiated behind the counter , took a good deal of notice of me ; and often got me , I recollect , to decline a Latin noun or adjective , or to conjugate a Latin verb , in his ear , while he transacted my business .
He lived in a place called the <NAME> , in <NAME> , where there were at that time a number of poor <NAME> refugees walking about in cloaks , smoking little paper cigars .
' No , I should rather say he wouldn ' t .
I will , if you ask it. " <NAME> 's manner was so careless as to be almost insolent .
Here will we stay , till morning blushes .
The child watched him from the porch until the intervening foliage hid him from her view , and then stepped softly out into the old churchyard -- so solemn and quiet that every rustle of her dress upon the fallen leaves , which strewed the path and made her footsteps noiseless , seemed an invasion of its silence .
I think the <NAME> must have aggravated one another very much , with their noses .
" I am glad you like it , " said <NAME> when he had brought us round again to <NAME> 's sitting-room .
You shall get me a good bill at four months , made payable at a banking-house , for the other twenty ! ' Then said <NAME> , when _that_ wouldn ' t suit , ' Now , come ; Here ' s the last I ' ve got to say to you .
' <NAME> here , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
For the letting of this portion of the house from week to week , on reasonable terms , the parlour lodger was empowered to treat ; he being deputed by the landlord to dispose of the rooms as they became vacant , and to keep a sharp look-out that the lodgers didn ' t run away .
<NAME> and I had two upper rooms with a door of communication between .
This place ? ' returned the old man , staying his pinch of snuff on its road , and pointing at the place without looking at it .
Well , ma ' am , this good gentleman of yours has given rise to a rather large amount of trouble which might have been avoided if he had come forward and explained himself .
Then should we see how the same poisoned fountains that flow into our hospitals and lazar-houses , inundate the jails , and make the convict-ships swim deep , and roll across the seas , and over-run vast continents with crime .
How true a gentleman to be as considerate of me as if I was removed by being a Queen ! ' He would have been base indeed to have stood untouched by her appeal .
' Mind you ! ' returned the other , stretching forward over the half door to throw his words into the bar ; for his voice was as if the head of his boat ' s mop were down his throat ; ' I say so , <NAME> !
When I explained it to you , we were already engaged -- ' ' I BEG , ' said <NAME> , more like <NAME> than I had ever seen him , as he energetically struck one hand upon the other -- I could not help noticing that even in my despair ; ' that <NAME> Will NOT talk to
<NAME> <NAME> , casting an indignant eye at the glass , shakes herself perfectly neat in one shake and looks , to do her justice , uncommonly genteel .
cried the Jew , stamping furiously on the ground .
' I was not aware of its being the custom to apprentice young persons to— ' ' Idleness , ' <NAME> put in with a loud laugh .
Had <NAME> been alone , these multiplied obstacles would have completely put an end to the pursuit at once , but old <NAME> was not to be so easily daunted ; and he laid about him with such hearty good-will , cuffing this man , and pushing that ; strapping a buckle here , and taking in a link
I tell you ! ' said <NAME> , continuing to warn me .
" Let me look at your forehead , " he says , bending down .
It has been supposed that the man to whom she gave her misplaced confidence acted throughout in concert with her half-brother ; that it was a conspiracy between them ; and that they shared the profits. " " I wonder he did n't marry her and get all the property , " said I .
It seemed as if , first in her own fire within the house , and then in the fiery haze without , she tried to discover what kind of woof <NAME> , that greatest and longest-established Spinner of all , would weave from the threads he had already spun into a woman .
And having said it he pulled up his apron , put his hands into his pockets , and , taking a step or two outside the door , looked down the dark road with an assumption of great indifference .
'My poor boy , this is disappointment enough for one day , ' said the doctor .
<NAME> is a wild young fellow .
<NAME> blue , you have begun well , <NAME> !
I found , on questioning the servants , that <NAME> was in <NAME> , and I got a promise from the surgeon that he would write to her by the next post .
I am not to be blinded ; and of course it was as plain to me what he was going to do with them , as it was that he was a brown hulking sort of revolutionary subject who had been in <NAME> with the soldiers , and ought ( for the sake of society ) to have his
See how gentle he is ! ' At her entreaty , <NAME> spared him ; and he deserved her intercession , for truly he was as submissive , and as sorry , and as wretched as a dog could be .
Here I am , Mrs. Gradgrind , anyhow , and nobody to thank for my being here , but myself. ' Mrs. Gradgrind meekly and weakly hoped that his mother— ' _My_ mother ?
There was nothing about them which could be called in question .
' If you had been happy ; surrounded as you should be by loving and admiring friends , and by all that makes the station you were born to enviable , ' said <NAME> ; ' and if you had called me brother , then , in your affectionate remembrance of the past , I could have answered to
' Yes , sir ; yes , yes , yes .
Having performed this friendly office , he fixed his eyes on the <NAME> 's face , and awaited his directions .
Of the two sitters one held the rudder-lines , and looked at us attentively , -- as did all the rowers ; the other sitter was wrapped up , much as <NAME> was , and seemed to shrink , and whisper some instruction to the steerer as he looked at us .
He went down , and there found a man without hat or coat , whose shirt sleeves were rolled up tight to his shoulders .
' Will you be improved ? ' ' Thank you , <NAME> , not this evening. ' ' Don ' t say no , ' returned the little woman , looking at me with the aspect of a connoisseur ; ' a little bit more eyebrow ? ' ' Thank you , ' I returned , ' some other
Now , unfold it and tell me what it is. " " This is a bank-note , " said I , " for five hundred pounds. " " That is a bank-note , " repeated <NAME> , " for five hundred pounds .
" There 's another conwict off. " " What does that mean , <NAME> ? " said I. Mrs. <NAME> , who always took explanations upon herself , said , snappishly , " Escaped .
<NAME> <NAME> ' s papa being greatly exalted by this triumph , and incontestable proof of his popularity with the fair sex , quickly grew convivial , not to say uproarious ; volunteering more than one song of no inconsiderable length , and regaling the social circle between-whiles with recollections of divers splendid women who had been supposed to
' A creature , ' continued the young man , passionately , ' a creature as fair and innocent of guile as one of <NAME> 's own angels , fluttered between life and death .
' <NAME> , give your father a chair. ' ' Thank ' ee , <NAME> , I ' ve got a cheer here , ' said <NAME> , bringing one forward as he spoke ; ' uncommon fine day it ' s been , sir , ' added the old gentleman , laying his hat on the floor as

My <NAME> wanted a paper out of his Secretary ' s room , and I says to <NAME> , " I am going by the door , and I ' ll ask him for it. " I tapped at his door , and he didn ' t hear me .
Thus cast off , <NAME> wildly inquired , ' which gentleman ' was to be paid ?
' Your remarks , ' returned <NAME> , from a remote moral eminence , ' are well meant , I have no doubt ; but you will permit me to observe that they develop a mistaken view of the subject , which can only be imputed to your extreme want of accurate information. ' ' My informiation , '
' Not yet , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
He is a difficult subject. ' That old , double look was on me for a moment ; and then his eyes darkened with a frown , as it turned , in its aversion , elsewhere .
' Who is it ? ' ' What an admirable witness you would make ! ' said <NAME> .
' Well , ' said Mr <NAME> , ' and neither will you find in <NAME> like myself , under Proprietors like this , pleasant qualities .
I ' ll not detain you an instant longer , on any account , Kit. ' Talking as he went , Mr <NAME> bustled out of the office , and in a very short time returned .
Think of that , before you send him .
I ' m a-going to unfold your plan , before this young lady ; I ' m a-going to show this young lady the second view of you ; and nothing you can say will stave it off .
We ' ll try a better one by and bye. ' At this point the conversation was interrupted by the arrival of a gentleman in orange-coloured plush , accompanied by another selection in purple cloth , with a great extent of stocking .
' Oh , my dear , you never deserved it , and I loved you far too well to say a reproachful word to you , in earnest -- it was all the merit I had , except being pretty -- or you thought me so .
Oliver raised the candle above his head : and looked towards the door .
I must not urge them too much ; it would rouse suspicion. " " Look back , look back , and see if we are pursued ! " " The road is clear , my dearest .

The wigged gentleman sitting opposite , still looking at the ceiling of the court .

' So we remarked to each other at the time , ' returned <NAME> coolly , ' but quite true. ' <NAME> was plainly staggered by this intelligence , over which he brooded for some time in moody silence , often raising his eyes to Mr <NAME> ' s face , and sharply scanning its expression .
What could they do , did she think ?
We are not so prejudiced as to suppose that in private life you are otherwise than a very estimable man , with a great deal of poetry in your nature , of which you may not be conscious . "
I think I shall trade , " said he , leaning back in his chair , " to the <NAME> , for silks , shawls , spices , dyes , drugs , and precious woods .
This produced a short remonstrance , which terminated in their all proceeding to the troubled chamber in a body , excepting only <NAME> , who , as the servant girl volunteered a confession of having been subject to fits in her infancy , remained with her to give the alarm and apply restoratives , in case of extremity .
You want t ' know where she lives .
Come ! ' I could not help blushing as I declined , for I felt we were on my weak point , now .
From that time until now , <NAME> , you have ever been a credit to me and a pride and a pleasure .
' No , my dear <NAME> , ' she remonstrated with tearful dignity , ' I must really be allowed to speak .
He says they can feel for one another , and she has been almost as good as a friend to him here .
A commonplace , hopeful sort of man , wholly destitute of dignity or knowledge of the world .
and remember that I spit upon your fair words and false dealings , and dare you -- provoke you -- taunt you -- to do to me the very worst you can ! ' Thus they parted , for that time ; but the worst had not come yet .
The fact of his having just parted from your ward , is in itself a sort of reason for his going away .
With a large allowance for difference of tastes , and with all submission to the patricians of <NAME> , this seemed so extraordinary a source of interest to take so much trouble about , that it perplexed him .
' Dear <NAME> ' having taken a very long stare at <NAME> over the tops of his spectacles , resumed his list of inquiries .
I don ' t say whether before , or in , or after , the fact .
The prisoners wear a parti-coloured dress ; and those who are sentenced to hard labour , work at nail-making , or stone-cutting .
He then withdrew a pace or two ; and , with another polite and gentlemanly inclination of the head , waited to be questioned .
He must say he thought a drone the embodiment of a pleasanter and wiser idea .
You ' ll have to go there , though. ' A little while , and the Secretary came out .
His was not a lazy trustfulness that hoped , and did no more .
' Is there anybody here for a yoongster , booked in the name of <NAME> , from <NAME> , <NAME> , but owning to the name of <NAME> , to be left till called for ? ' said the guard .
He ran up to her , seized her hand , kissed it , dropped it , seized it again , fell upon one knee , shed tears , chuckled , and was quite regardless of his danger of being pinned by <NAME> , who , inspired by the belief that there was something hostile to his mistress in these
O , I am so sorry , so sorry ! ' And there she broke into tears .
They then drew near the fire , which <NAME> had made up as well as he could , after the inroads of <NAME> upon the fuel ; and <NAME> , who had hitherto been restrained by the extreme anxiety of his friend that he should refresh himself after his journey , now pressed him with earnest questions concerning his
' No thank you , ' I replied .

I have a pretty large experience of boys , and you 're a bad set of fellows .
And yet , she had loved him dearly for many years , and had no greater share of selfishness than is the usual lot of mortals .
At last <NAME> , in a condition of absolute despair , ordered the coachman to drive away , and in the unexpected jerk of a sudden starting , Mrs. <NAME> lost a shilling among the straw , which fortunately confined her attention to the coach until it was too late to remember anything else .
And arterwards , crushing a flowing wine-cup -- which I allude to brewing rum and water -- we ' ll pledge one another .

The gallant Mr Toots , attended by the faithful <NAME> , leaves the building in torments of love .
On the death of the old people , I suppose there will be more to come ; but how it may be restricted or locked up , I don ' t know .
He says is very different from they say , remember .

A detestably unhappy walk , sir .

A humble machine , familiar to the conspirators and called by the expressive name of <NAME> , being unavoidably sent for , he was rendered a harmless bundle of torn rags by being strapped down upon it , with voice and consciousness gone out of him , and life fast going .

Mr Dombey having nothing else to say , proposed -- the breakfast being now finished , and the <NAME> gorged , like any Boa Constrictor -- that they should start .
They inquired at several little area gates , where a dejected youth stood spiking his chin on the summit of a precipitous little shoot of wooden steps , but could gain no information .
You remember a certain famous occasion when I was more drunk than -- than usual ? " " I remember a certain famous occasion when you forced me to confess that you had been drinking. " " I remember it too .
I had ninety pounds a year ( exclusive of my house-rent and sundry collateral matters ) from my aunt .
' Drat the things , ' said the lady , opening the cupboard ; ' I can ' t find the school spoon anywhere. ' ' Never mind it , my dear , ' observed <NAME> in a soothing manner ; ' it ' s of no consequence. ' ' No consequence , why how you talk ! '
Very soon afterwards we stopped .
Of unjust treatment in detention and hardship , and in cruel separation from his wife and child , he foreshadowed the likelihood , or the certainty ; but , beyond this , he dreaded nothing distinctly .
Other vehicles were there , much company being on the road , from the patched <NAME> Vettura -- like the body of a swing from an <NAME> fair put upon a wooden tray on wheels , and having another wooden tray without wheels put atop of it -- to the trim <NAME> carriage .

The table trembled in the silence that followed .
' I am much obliged to you .
But in the first capacity , my love , she may find people who can match her. ' A significant turn of the <NAME> fan towards <NAME> ' s bosom , indicated with great expression where one of these people was to be found .
If you please ! ' -- which they didn ' t like at all , because it woke them .
When I got theer , I wandered on as I had done afore .
I , for my part , was thoughtful too ; for , how best to check this growing change in <NAME> was a great perplexity to my remorseful thoughts .
When they present themselves in <NAME> 's <NAME> , <NAME> is engaged and not to be seen .
I have felt them even drawing my rest away in the night .

There were times when he could not read the face he had studied so long ; and when this lonely girl was a greater mystery to him , than any woman of the world with a ring of satellites to help her .

' When a child of four or five years old. ' ' Indeed ? ' said Mr Dombey , raising his head .

The coach rattled away , over nearly the same ground as that which <NAME> had traversed when he first entered <NAME> in company with the <NAME> ; and , turning a different way when it reached the Angel at <NAME> , stopped at length before a neat house , in a quiet shady street near <NAME> .
' It ' s all over ! ' thought <NAME> .
Its steady hand was pointed to the head .
And if you go on to ask where <NAME> is at the present moment , why , my plain answer is -- here he is !
' I was once beset that way myself , and left for dead. ' ' No ? ' said <NAME> .
We went downstairs , one behind another .
Hold up your head , boy , and be forever grateful unto them which so did do .

said the gentleman in the high chair .
The proposal originated with himself , and was couched in the pithy terms , ' If your <NAME> is weak enough , ma ' am , not to take it , that is no reason why you should be , don ' t you see ?
What will I not promise to my Love ? " What , indeed , with his hand putting aside the golden hair from the cheek , and his other hand against the heart that beat for him !

' For <NAME> ' s sake -- ' ' I WILL speak ! ' she said , turning on me with her lightning eyes .
" If there ai n't <NAME> ! " said <NAME> , appearing to think it most surprising .
' Oh my eye ! ' cried <NAME> , struggling anew .

<NAME> <NAME> looks again , to convince himself .

And he answered , <NAME> , and he hadn ' t. ' <NAME> pauses with the selected coins in his hand , rather as if he were falling into a brown study of their value , and couldn ' t bear to part with them .
You , in whom I trusted so much , and who were almost the only friend I had ! ' The unfortunate <NAME> looked at his young mistress harder and harder , and with eyes growing wider and wider , but was perfectly motionless and silent .
They had not talked much upon the way ; for <NAME> was in a flutter of agitation and uncertainty which deprived him of the power of collecting his thoughts , and almost of speech , and appeared to have scarcely less effect on his companions , who shared it , in at least an equal degree .
He looked about , and saw that at no great distance there was a house , which perhaps he could reach .
" Now , I may say to your ladyship at once , " says <NAME> , a little emboldened , " it is no matter arising out of <NAME> and <NAME> that made me so desirous to speak to your ladyship , which conduct I have no doubt did appear , and does appear , obtrusive -- in fact

Have you forgot your old sweetheart ?
I have no doubt the people were very foolish , and perhaps ought to have known better , but still they did take me for her , and of course that was no fault of mine , and it would be very hard indeed if I was to be made responsible for it .
<NAME> <NAME> 's voice trembles and his grey hair stirs upon his head .
Beneath that black mud , bubbled the hot springs of <NAME> .
' Yes , I can let him speak , <NAME> Groves. ' ' Well then , do it , will you ? ' said the landlord .
It may not be all-sufficient ; how can I venture this morning to say it is !
I -- ha -- I ' ll write it , <NAME> ' His hand shook so that he was a long time writing it , and wrote it in a tremulous scrawl at last .
But what ? ' ' I could make you , ' said <NAME> , surveying the room , ' I could make you a handy set of nests to lay the dolls in .
Presently he looked in with his pilot-coat on , and said , ' Cuttle , I ' m a-going to act as convoy home ; ' and <NAME> , more to his confusion than if he had been put in irons himself , for safe transport to <NAME> , saw the family pacifically filing off , with <NAME> at

Mr <NAME> seemed to have a malicious pleasure in playing off the three talkers against each other , and in seeing <NAME> startled by what they said .
' Fitz-Marshall , ' said the mulberry man .
'No other question , ' replied <NAME> .

He said with some embarrassment , holding the handle of the door , " Shall I have the honour of finding you here , miss ? "
The only account he could give of it was , that my aunt had said to him , the day before yesterday , ' Now , <NAME> , are you really and truly the philosopher I take you for ? ' That then he had said , Yes , he hoped so .
<NAME> and me were over the garden-wall the night afore last , sounding the panels of the door and shutters .

But this was before the arrival of Mr and <NAME> , his lawful relatives , who soon presented themselves .

If it ever haunted <NAME> ' s thoughts or <NAME> ' s , neither gave it one spoken word of utterance .
why do we meet like this ?
An impostor , sir. ' With those words , <NAME> turned slowly on his heel , and rejoined his friends .
We used to walk between the two places at all hours .
That woman , ' she spoke of Mrs Merdle , of course , ' remains here until after <NAME> ; so , in the case of my being married here and going to <NAME> with <NAME> , I should have the start of her .

' It is not impossible , ' said Mr Boffin , addressing <NAME> , ' that you have had some general idea , sir , of replacing <NAME> , in course of time ? ' ' It is not , ' assented <NAME> , with a glittering smile and a great deal of nose , ' not impossible. '
<NAME> <NAME> gave his hat a ferocious cock , after delivering this sentiment , and looked at <NAME> , as if to denote that he would feel obliged by his saying anything to the contrary .
It is a fact which will be long remembered as remarkable down there , that she was never drowned , but died triumphantly in bed , at ninety-two .
May I hint at the probability of your sometimes supplying him with money for these purposes ? ' She sat , looking down ; but , at this question , raised her eyes searchingly and a little resentfully .
' <NAME> ? ' ' Ha ha ! ' laughed <NAME> .
But this is the first instruction that I , as the owner of the property , give to my lawyer on coming into it. ' ' Your lawyer , Mr Boffin , ' returned <NAME> , making a very short note of it with a very rusty pen , ' has the gratification of taking the instruction .

He was a little man , and , being half doubled up as he lay in bed , looked about as long as he ought to have been without his legs .
She broke into a passion of tears and lamentations : <NAME> was written in his own hand on the inside .

Micawber and myself are deeply sensible of the very considerate kindness of our friends and patrons .

" Yes , madame , " answered <NAME> ; " this is our poor prisoner 's darling daughter , and only child. " The shadow attendant on <NAME> and her party seemed to fall so threatening and dark on the child , that her mother instinctively kneeled on the ground beside her , and held her to her breast

Besides , there had been no altercation ; the assailant had come in so silently and suddenly , that she had been felled before she could look round .
Upon every one of these anniversaries , the venerable <NAME> was nervously sensitive for the well-being of her child the <NAME> ; and although it was not found that the good lady ever did anything material towards contributing to her child ' s recovery , still she made it a point of duty to be as nervous as possible
' <NAME> , pooh , my dear Sir , ' returned <NAME> .
You have made up your mind ?
<NAME> <NAME> followed him , and the ladies screamed .
Whether I gave myself up to prodding , or whether I gave myself up to scooping , I couldn ' t do it with that delicate touch so as not to show that I was disturbing the mounds .
In this retirement , the <NAME> , gazing at the packet of an evening , would sit smoking , and thinking of <NAME> and poor Walter , until they both seemed to his homely fancy to be dead , and to have passed away into eternal youth , the beautiful and innocent children of his first remembrance .

The spectators dropped off to get refreshment , and the prisoner withdrew to the back of the dock , and sat down .

The conference was a long one .
Their patroness then shut the door and sat herself down by her drum at an open window ; and , the steps being struck by <NAME> and stowed under the carriage , away they went , with a great noise of flapping and creaking and straining , and the bright brass knocker , which nobody ever knocked at ,
I have hoped that I should never see him again. ' ' Ow you know him bad ? ' asked <NAME> .

But , he won ' t resist , you may depend upon it. ' <NAME> , who with his mouth open and his rolling eye as immovably jammed in his head as his fixed one , had listened to these doctrines with profound attention , here stepped forward .
She was pleased , but answered , ' Tut , <NAME> ; MY old bones would have kept till tomorrow ! ' and softly patted my hand again , as I sat looking thoughtfully at the fire .

They were not absolutely uninvited , but had pressed themselves with so much urgency on the golden couple , that evasion of the honour and pleasure of their company would have been difficult , if desired .
On my saying that I should like to see her write again , the teacher who sat beside her , bade her , in their language , sign her name upon a slip of paper , twice or thrice .
I 'd rather be a baby .

For it was quite delightful to me , to find him so pleasant .
' <NAME> ' t it so ? ' ' <NAME> ' t it so ! ' repeated <NAME> .

When <NAME> and I got home , we found the table laid , and Mrs. <NAME> dressed , and the dinner dressing , and the front door unlocked ( it never was at any other time ) for the company to enter by , and everything most splendid .
' Go before , you fool ! ' said <NAME> .
She was laid upon her bed .
" Look'ee here ! " he went on , taking my watch out of my pocket , and turning towards him a ring on my finger , while I recoiled from his touch as if he had been a snake , " a gold 'un and a beauty : that 's a gentleman 's , I hope !
' Well , well ! ' said my aunt , ' the child is right to stand by those who have stood by him -- Janet !
When have you found me giving admission here , " she touched her bosom with her hand , " to anything that you excluded ?
<NAME> ! ' Girl number twenty stopped then , palpitating , and made him a curtsey .
Looking carefully about him for an instant , <NAME> , impelled by curiosity to know the result of the design he had overheard from his office closet , caught it up and rapidly read as follows : ' I saw <NAME> again this morning , and proposed the day after tomorrow ( as you suggested ) for the marriage
" 'T is so well known here , is it , comrade ? "
I came to walk home with you , having dined at a coffee-house in this neighbourhood and knowing your hour .
The two other gentlemen hurried in and out with anxious faces , and , during the short intervals when they were present , conversed apart .
Now , if you was n't brought up to the butter trade , look out and see if you can catch half a crown in your t'other hand .
<NAME> <NAME> beckoned her to come close , and took up a jewel from the table , and tried its effect upon her fair young bosom and against her pretty brown hair .
This his disdainful and insolent tone in their recent conversation ( the only one they had held upon the subject since the period to which <NAME> referred ) , effected .
' Well , I tell you what .
I knew the way by which she would come , and presently found myself strolling along the path to meet her .
Oh , <NAME> , sister of my boyhood , if I had known then , what I knew long afterwards -- !
" Your ladyship , I do assure you that having <NAME> 's image imprinted on my 'eart -- which I mention in confidence -- I found , when I had the honour of going over your ladyship 's mansion of <NAME> while on a short out in the county of <NAME> with a friend , such a resemblance between
He said he would never , never part with it any more ; and I thought he must be quite a fool not to know that it would fall to pieces in a day or two .
The shrubs wrung their many hands , bemoaning that they had been over-persuaded by the sun to bud ; the young leaves pined ; the sparrows repented of their early marriages , like men and women ; the colours of the rainbow were discernible , not in floral spring , but in the faces of the people whom it
<NAME> <NAME> pocketed his staff , and looked at <NAME> ; <NAME> pocketed his staff and looked at the division ; the division pocketed their staves and looked at Messrs. Tupman and <NAME> .
The public costume of the young people was of the <NAME> kind , but the night being damp and cold , the young gentleman wore over his kilt a man ' s pea jacket reaching to his ankles , and a glazed hat ; the young lady too was muffled in an old cloth pelisse and had a handkerchief
Sometimes , indeed , you may see his small eye twinkling on a slaughtered friend , whose carcase garnishes a butcher ' s door-post , but he grunts out ' Such is life : all flesh is pork ! ' buries his nose in the mire again , and waddles down the gutter : comforting himself with the reflection
My firm conviction is that , independent of the mental anguish it occasions—an anguish so acute and so tremendous , that all imagination of it must fall far short of the reality—it wears the mind into a morbid state , which renders it unfit for the rough contact and busy action of the world .
However , having them and the blessing of <NAME> -- Yes , that was very good .
Sooth to say , they can not go away too fast , for even here my <NAME> has been bored to death .
I had seen it somewhere .
<NAME> waits. ' ' Why , then , I ' ll tell you what , ' tittered <NAME> , ' we ' ll drink -- he , he , he ! -- we ' ll drink a lady. ' ' THE ladies ? ' said <NAME> .
One night ' s unbroken rest , and I should be a man again. ' Pushing the table from him while he spoke , as though he loathed the sight of food , he encountered the watch : the hands of which were almost upon noon .
Whether I had come there with any lingering fancy that I was still to love little Em ' ly , I don ' t know .
He is in the confidence of the very bricks and mortar .
Nor was he free from his uneasy and embarrassed manner all that day ; though <NAME> , being busy with her needle in the little parlour , was more calm and tranquil than she had been on the day preceding .
This is to tell him you are there. " As the ancient clerk deliberately folded and superscribed the note , <NAME> , after surveying him in silence until he came to the blotting-paper stage , remarked : " I suppose they 'll be trying Forgeries this morning ? " " <NAME> ! " " That 's quartering , "
I want to know how you are to be kept out of danger , how long you are going to stay , what projects you have. " " Look'ee here , <NAME> , " said he , laying his hand on my arm in a suddenly altered and subdued manner ; " first of all , look'ee here .
' Good morning. ' He walked out of the Haven at a great rate , but soon fell into his regular brisk pace , and soon had a smile upon his face as he went along , wondering what the china shepherdess would have said if she had seen him pounding <NAME> in the late little lively affair .
' Not as I am , but as I was when I first came here too ; as sanguine , giddy , youthful , inexperienced ; flushed with the same restless and adventurous fancies ; and full of the same qualities , fraught with the same capacity of leading on to good or evil. ' ' I hope not
' That ' s right , <NAME> ! ' cried <NAME> , merrily , and clapping him half a dozen times more upon the shoulder .
He sat down before the fire , and stared at the old chair for half an hour. -- Damn the chair , it was such a strange old thing , he couldn ' t take his eyes off it .
aristocratic , ' replied <NAME> ; ' something very aristocratic about him , isn ' t there ? ' The gentleman held their peace , and smiled at each other , as who should say , ' Well !
At this point of his discourse , the reverend and red-nosed gentleman became singularly incoherent , and staggering to and fro in the excitement of his eloquence , was fain to catch at the back of a chair to preserve his perpendicular .
I am better there , it is unfeeling in me to be here , when I can do the least thing there .
What have I done ! " " If you mean , <NAME> , what have you done to injure me , let me answer .
And even for my whim , <NAME> here is more accountable than I am. ' ' How so , <NAME> ? ' says the <NAME> , with a nod of good-natured recognition of his <NAME> .
But no <NAME> was in all the view .
I am afraid I shall disappoint you .
After which , the Major inquired of Mr Carker the Manager , with little apparent hope of an answer in the affirmative , if he played picquet .
Good-bye ! ' They shook hands , and <NAME> strode out pondering .
Withers the lean having <NAME> ' s sketch-book under his arm , was immediately called upon by <NAME> to produce the same : and the carriage stopped , that <NAME> might make the drawing , which Mr <NAME> was to put away among his treasures .
' Then bring him here , ' said the single gentleman .
' A little will go a long way if it ' s used sparingly , ' said <NAME> .
The garden had run wild , and half the windows of the house were shut up .
It was known directly , to the furthest confines of the crowd .
I am extremely anxious , <NAME> , that my friend <NAME> should hear me express my very great astonishment and regret , that my lovely and accomplished relative , who was possessed of every qualification to make a man happy , should have so far forgotten what was due to -- in point of fact , to the world
There was an inflexibility in her face , in her voice , in her gait and carriage , amply sufficient to account for the effect she had made upon a gentle creature like my mother ; but her features were rather handsome than otherwise , though unbending and austere .
Mr Boffin then put on his hat , and <NAME> her shawl ; and the pair , further provided with a bunch of keys and a lighted lantern , went all over the dismal house -- dismal everywhere , but in their own two rooms -- from cellar to cock-loft .
' Most unkind never to have come back to see us since that day , though naturally it was not to be expected that there should be any attraction at _our_ house and you were much more pleasantly engaged , that ' s pretty certain , and is she fair or dark blue eyes or black I wonder ,
'About his losses , maybe ; or the little retirement in the country that he 's just left , eh ?
When you come to me this evening , not a word of last night .
' You must ha ' been an uncommon nice boy , to go to school vith , ' said <NAME> .
At last we came to the door of a room , and she said , " Go in. " I answered , more in shyness than politeness , " After you , miss. " To this she returned : " Do n't be ridiculous , boy ; I am not going in. " And scornfully walked away , and
He is a great philosopher , and seldom moved , unless by the dogs before mentioned .
When we arrived at the house , I was directed to <NAME> in the garden , and left to make my presence known to her myself .
Ve-ry happy , I am sure , to have the honour !
That night she took refuge from the <NAME> in his latest accredited form , under a farmer ' s rick ; and if -- worth thinking of , perhaps , my fellow-Christians -- the <NAME> had in the lonely night , ' passed by on the other side ' , she would have most devoutly thanked <NAME> for her
' In <NAME> is she really ? ' said <NAME> , ' with the grapes growing everywhere and lava necklaces and bracelets too that land of poetry with burning mountains picturesque beyond belief though if the organ-boys come away from the neighbourhood not to be scorched nobody can wonder being so young and bringing their white mice with them
The little dressmaker sat down again , and gave it into his hand , saying , with that better look upon her , and with a smile : ' Thank you ! ' ' And as concerning the nests and the drawers , ' said <NAME> , after measuring the handle on his sleeve , and softly standing the
'The only thing she had .
' Why , bless me , ' cried the old gentleman , ' the lad is here !
Previous to the commencement of business , the ladies sat upon forms , and drank tea , till such time as they considered it expedient to leave off ; and a large wooden money-box was conspicuously placed upon the green baize cloth of the business-table , behind which the secretary stood , and acknowledged , with a gracious smile
' He has patted the babies on the head , ' said <NAME> , trembling with anxiety .
' You have fallen on <NAME> days and sensual rest , too soon .
' <NAME> , ' says Mr Toots , who feels that he is in for it now , ' I really am in that state of adoration of you that I don ' t know what to do with myself .
She is in a garden ; and near her stands a sharp , dark , withered woman , with a white scar on her lip .
' In every vaunt you make , ' she said , ' I have my triumph .
And you ' re a proud woman ; but pride won ' t save us .
' If you had been a younger man , you would have been in the secret long ago ; and besides , ' added <NAME> , after a moment ' s hesitation , ' the truth is , that , knowing nothing of this matter , I have rather pressed Emily for four or five months past , to
I shall break down , if I try to say more. ' In a few moments the black bonnet and the crutch-stick were on duty , the good <NAME> was left in possession of the house , and the dolls ' dressmaker , side by side in a chaise with <NAME> , was posting out of town .
You know , ' said <NAME> , looking round as if in appeal to the bruised animal , ' he ' s quite a remarkable man -- quite ! ' ' Sit down , ' said the dwarf .
He hoped that by remaining where he was , he might do some good , even there ; at all events , others depended too much on his uncle ' s favour , to admit of his awakening his wrath just then .
I was took up , took up , took up , to that extent that I reg'larly grow 'd up took up .
And when she in a tartar , ' said the <NAME> , with the perspiration breaking out upon his forehead .
' " Frightful , my dear ma ' am ; but compose yourself , " said <NAME> .
'That 's when they 're ill , Mrs. Mann , ' said the beadle .
I thought it was better to borrow <NAME> ' s knife and fork , than <NAME> ' s comb .
' Now , having received the caution , do you still say that you foresaw my visit this afternoon ? ' ' Yes .
" Now , my dear <NAME> , and my dear <NAME> , " said <NAME> gaily , innocently , and confidingly as he looked at his drawing with his head on one side , " here you see me utterly incapable of helping myself , and entirely in your hands !
He assumed an expression of gloomy intelligence ( though I am persuaded he knew no more about the discussion than I did ) , and highly approved of the discretion that had been observed .
' Poor dear , poor dear ! ' cried brother <NAME> ' Where is my brother Ned ?
' Yes , ' continued <NAME> , ' and one of them is a cook , who has saved up a little money , <NAME> , and is desirous , if she can establish herself in life , to open a little shop in the chandlery way , you see. ' Yes. ' ' Yes , <NAME> .
I am an Englishwoman. " <NAME> looked at her scornfully , but still with something of <NAME> 's own perception that they two were at bay .
" Pray what is your business ? " I asked him .
' I am lame. ' Poor <NAME> flushed too , for there was an instinctive delicacy behind his buttons , and his own hand had struck it .
The frenzy was so violent , that I had not unfastened the bandages restraining the arms ; but , I had looked to them , to see that they were not painful .
What was my indignant surprise when he called upon the company to pledge him to " <NAME> ! " " Estella who ? " said I .
You are not to look back here , my Little <NAME> ; you are to look away to very different and much happier paths .
The wit of the Counting-House became in a moment as mute as the row of leathern fire-buckets hanging up behind him .
' <NAME> ! ' said the old woman , with a shrill laugh .
Let me wet your lips again with this brandy .
<NAME> , happily unconscious of the defects in his appearance , sat on the carpet behind one of the legs of the piano , looking calmly out of his den at us while he ate his cake .
She was very cleanly and plainly dressed , had country mud upon her shoes , and was newly come from a journey .
I ought to have had more faith in you .
Little Em ' ly came and sat beside me on the locker for the only time in all that visit ; and it was altogether a wonderful close to a wonderful day .
A minute more , my lady lass !
But no one knew It .
" To decided rejection , if you please , " returned my guardian .
There was the superannuated bank clerk , <NAME> ' s friend ; and there was the chubby old lady , <NAME> ' s sister ; and there was so much attention from <NAME> ' s sister to <NAME> , and there were so many jokes from the superannuated bank clerk , and <NAME> himself was in such tiptop spirits
It would affect my daughter greatly , sir , if she heard it .
But can you restore him back to life ? "
He stood with his back towards them , and his gloved hands clasped behind him .
There all the children of the house were running out into the snow to meet their married sisters , brothers , cousins , uncles , aunts , and be the first to greet them .
If I have any secret , it is -- no new one ; and is -- not what you suppose .
Besides , that shrinking from having <NAME> and <NAME> discussed , which had come upon me in the beginning , grew much more potent as time went on .
She gave her evidence in the gamest way , and was highly complimented by the <NAME> , and cheered right home to her lodgings .
Nor will I say that companionship between us is , at the best , an ill-assorted and unholy union , of which I might have known no good could come .
How dreadful to remember , perhaps , that she had sometimes even wished the old man away who was so swiftly hurried out of life !
This area , it appeared from <NAME> ' s statement , was the racket- ground ; and it further appeared , on the testimony of the same gentleman , that there was a smaller area in that portion of the prison which was nearest <NAME> , denominated and called ' the <NAME> , ' from the fact of its
<NAME> , ' said the beadle , smiling as men smile who are conscious of superior information , 'out-of-door relief , properly managed : properly managed , ma'am : is the porochial safeguard .
He had scarcely the power of understanding anything that had passed , until , after a long ramble in the quiet evening air , a burst of tears came to his relief , and he seemed to awaken , all at once , to a full sense of the joyful change that had occurred , and the almost insupportable
<NAME> <NAME> had returned one Sunday night with <NAME> , from walking back with <NAME> to the <NAME> ' s , when <NAME> took from her bosom a little piece of paper , on which she had pencilled down some words .
A more outrageous person I never did see .
' This gentleman , Mr Lightwood , is on that business. ' ' Mr Lightwood ? ' During a pause , <NAME> and the stranger confronted each other .
It took place this here present hour ; and here ' s the man that ' ll marry her , the minute she ' s out of her time. ' <NAME> staggered , as well he might , under the blow <NAME> dealt him in his unbounded joy , as a mark of confidence and friendship ; but feeling
" We have here among us , my friends , " says <NAME> , " a Gentile and a heathen , a dweller in the tents of Tom-all-Alone 's and a mover-on upon the surface of the earth .
He did so ; and , as he placed the candlestick upon the table , saw that the Jew was gazing fixedly at him , with lowering and contracted brows , from the dark end of the room .
Having thus expressively uttered his sentiments , <NAME> , after waiting a little to ascertain if any further remark be expected of him , gets back by his usual series of movements to the target he has in hand and vigorously signifies through his former musical medium that he must and he will return to that ideal young lady
There is no one in that room behind you !
And indeed he has no such wish at present , by any means .
Even from me , his old and early friend , whose strong attachment had taken root in the earth that covered one most dear to both -- even from me he withheld any more particular confession , promising to write and tell me all , and after that to see me once again , for the last time on
' Fork out your balance in hand , and prove by figures how you make it out that it ain ' t more .
( Signed ) ' _John Smauker_. ' The envelope was directed to blank <NAME> , Esq. , at <NAME> ' s ; and in a parenthesis , in the left hand corner , were the words ' airy bell , ' as an instruction to the bearer .
But do n't loiter , boy. " Though she called me " boy " so often , and with a carelessness that was far from complimentary , she was of about my own age .
He was a sallow man -- all cobblers are ; and had a strong bristly beard -- all cobblers have .
To which <NAME> replies , " Why , YOU are ! "
The green lamp is lighted , his reading-glasses lie upon the desk , the easy-chair is wheeled up to it , and it would seem as though he had intended to bestow an hour or so upon these claims on his attention before going to bed .
She had no more gratitude , no more feeling , no more patience , no more reason in her , than a stock or a stone .
' I am very glad to hear it , sir , ' said <NAME> , senior .
Neither did he , on the arrival of the appointed morning , show any sense of its importance ; being , on the contrary , unusually inclined to sleep , and unusually inclined to take it ill in his attendants that they dressed him to go out .
may I -- ? " It began to be unnecessary to repeat the form of saying he might , so he did it at once .
The flying waiter then highly polished all the glasses he had brought , and the immovable waiter looked through them .
But before we drove away too , I received a most unexpected and eloquent compliment from <NAME> .
I have some self-respect left , though you may think otherwise. ' ' Oh , <NAME> ! ' cried <NAME> .
" <NAME> , " said <NAME> , after a moment 's thought , " I wonder you , of all the beings in the many worlds about us , should desire to cramp these people 's opportunities of innocent enjoyment . "
There an ' t such a young man as this in all <NAME> , ' said <NAME> , clapping <NAME> on the back ; ' not one .
' I thought it right that you should know it. ' ' And what is it ? ' ' He has been a prisoner in a <NAME> gaol. ' She answered with composure , ' I should think that very likely. ' ' But in a gaol for criminals , mother .
' But personal service , by clerk or agent , in these cases , you know , <NAME> -- nothing like caution , sir , in all legal forms -- eh ? ' Here <NAME> cast his eye on the parchment ; and , resting his hands on the table , and looking round with a winning and persuasive
' Prime ! ' ejaculated <NAME> .
Be careful to dewelop your talents , and never to say no more than you can help to nobody , and there 's no telling at the present time what you may not come to be fit for. " As <NAME> , thus encouraged , went on a few yards in advance , to plant the stool in the
<NAME> watching of <NAME> , and much consequent observation of her impenetrable demeanour , which keenly whetted and sharpened Mrs. Sparsit ' s edge , must have given her as it were a lift , in the way of inspiration .
I shall see him to-morrow , you remember , and I had better not take it into the prison. " " Why not ? " " I do n't know ; I prefer not to do so .
At first he looks behind him often to assure himself that <NAME> is still really following .
cried my guardian with a sudden terror in his manner , and in an altered voice , and putting up his hands as if he would have stopped his ears .
But circumstances alter cases ; and I made this visit to-day , partly , indeed principally , to discharge myself of the duty of telling you , my dear , that two young people can only be betrothed in marriage ( except as a matter of convenience , and therefore mockery and misery ) of their own free will
" Very well , " said <NAME> .
The pictures in her mind were so obtrusive and exact that , as the twilight deepened , she dreaded to raise her head and look at the dark corners of the room , lest his wraith , the offspring of her excited imagination , should be waiting there , to startle her .
' Thank you , sir , ' said Mrs. Sparsit , and returned , though short of her former position .
' Somebody to the lodger eh ?
" Not an idea of them ! "
' Yours , sir. ' ' Thank you , ' said <NAME> .
In the afternoon , a thunderstorm came up , and had but newly broken into a furious sweep of rain when he rushed in at the door , like the storm itself .
Sometimes I would come upon him lingering at the door of <NAME> 's office .
<NAME> do you know what would have become of you , if I had not bestowed my hand upon R. W. , your father , on this day ? ' ' <NAME> , <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> , ' I really do not ; and , with the greatest respect for your abilities and information , I very
His expressive action would be hopelessly lost upon her , and what could he do ?
And lord , how the gentlemen in the Court talked about it !
And I mean to be !
Such long lashes , such delicate fringe !
' I thought nothing would have frightened her , ' he said , ' for she ' s -- ' here he whispered softly , ' don ' t mention it -- the wisest and most wonderful of women. ' Having said which , he drew back , to observe the effect which this description of her made upon
' Not a morsel. ' He felt himself quite lost in wonder at the manner of the man , and that the probability of his daughter ' s having had a reserve as to her family history , should be so far out of his mind .
" <NAME> , I have not yet been able to come to a decision satisfactory to myself on the course before me .
" Is that the chance and hope you mentioned , <NAME> ? "
" I must n't see my gentleman a footing it in the mire of the streets ; there must n't be no mud on his boots .
" Ye-es , " is <NAME> 's reluctant admission .
We set off again immediately .
replied <NAME> , confronting him with a steady look .
They were men of business : very wealthy , and of great importance .
She had sought out the young children whom she first saw playing in the churchyard .
A man made out of a coarse material , which seemed to have been stretched to make so much of him .
She is yours ! " And her agitated hand waved to them from a chaise window , and she was gone .

He may brush his hair too regular , or too un-regular .

So Veneering , without the formality of rising , launches into a familiar oration , gradually toning into the <NAME> sing-song , in which he sees at that board his dear friend <NAME> who on that day twelvemonth bestowed on his dear friend Lammle the fair hand of his dear friend <NAME> , and in which he also sees
They shan ' t be wasted , ' continued <NAME> , turning to <NAME> .
' I don ' t know anything about that , sir , ' answered the literary gentleman .
<NAME> , thus apostrophized , gives a slouch backward , and another slouch forward , and another slouch to each side , and confronts the eloquent Chadband with evident doubts of his intentions .
he knows a great deal about it .
I am going to breakfast with one of these fellows who is at the <NAME> , in <NAME> Garden. ' ' But you ' ll come back to dinner ? ' said I .
Produced by <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> By <NAME> 1 .
It was all quite right. ' ' It ' s perfectly clear you think so , ' returned <NAME> , ' for you take it very coolly , if I hadn ' t known it to be <NAME> I should have guessed myself the Polar regions , dear Mr Clennam you are right however and I can not blame
There was an expression of contempt on his face , and he bit the side of a great forefinger as he watched the group of faces .
You deliberately advise me not to go up to <NAME> and offer myself -- _my_self , <NAME> of the King 's <NAME> bar ? " " Do you ask me for my advice , <NAME> ? " " Yes , I do. " " Very good .
' Do you know where he is to-night ? ' —with a very deep expression .
" And yet I am here now , " <NAME> admits .
We dined alone , we three together .
I told him that my old nurse would be delighted to assist him , and that we would all three take the field together , but on one condition .
If you possess it and find it comfortable , I am quite delighted and congratulate you heartily .
And feeling , when the deceased person was , in point of fact , destroyed in a devilish horrible manner , that her position was a very painful one -- and feeling besides that our family had been a little to blame in not paying more attention to her , and that we are a careless family -- and
' To offer to the unhappy subject of your treachery , at this last moment , ' replied <NAME> , ' a refuge and a home .
' Why , who are you ? ' said <NAME> .
She stretched out hers , as if she would have touched him ; then checked herself , and remained still .
' You took notice of him , ' he would say , ' that went out of the lodge just now ? ' New-comer would probably answer Yes .
Use your own discretion , Bitzer. ' Here the visitor , all unconscious of Mrs. Sparsit ' s magnanimous words , repeated his knock so loudly that the light porter hastened down to open the door ; while Mrs. <NAME> took the precaution of concealing her little table , with all its appliances upon it , in a cupboard
It was necessary for <NAME> to hold on heavily to the table with his left elbow , and to get his right leg well out behind him , before he could begin ; and when he did begin he made every downstroke so slowly that it might have been six feet long , while at every upstroke I could
I ' m going away again. ' ' Not again ! ' ' Yes , again .
He sent it below with his card , on the morning of the head-wind ; and I was long troubled with the idea that he might be up , and well , and a hundred times a day expecting me to call upon him in the saloon .
Adept as she was , in all the arts of cunning and dissimulation , the girl <NAME> could not wholly conceal the effect which the knowledge of the step she had taken , wrought upon her mind .
You doen ' t understand what ' tis we has afore us .
' Come here , child. ' She had opened a door while saying this , and now led the girl in by the hand .
You will never forget them. ' He stepped up to <NAME> , who remained in the same attitude which he had preserved throughout the interview , and moved not a finger .
And thus she sat at the gate , as it were alone ; looking up at the stars , and seeing the clouds pass over them in their wild flight -- which was the dance at <NAME> ' s party .
<NAME> <NAME> was standing in his shirt-sleeves at the door of his very clean little tavern waiting for me .
Finding that there was nobody in sight , he presently returned into the house with his legal friend , protesting ( as the child heard from the staircase ) , that there was a league and plot against him ; that he was in danger of being robbed and plundered by a band of conspirators who prowled about the

Hereby they made for themselves a shining little reputation apart .
The wind sawed , and the sawdust whirled .
We have been mentioning Mrs. Jellyby .
<NAME> ! " cried the coachman in a warning voice , looking down from his box .
This , under ordinary circumstances , would have been to some small tavern or dram-shop ; that being his way , in more senses than one .
He knows his mother very little if he does .
' Yes ! ' cried <NAME> , laughing and crying together .
I heard the side-door open , and steps come across the courtyard ; but I pretended not to hear , even when the gate swung on its rusty hinges .
how could it ! ' ' I guess his meaning , ' said the sexton .
But I knew it , I knew it well now .
It ' s clear to me that I am done for .
A man need n't go far to find a subject , if he 's ready with his salt-box. " <NAME> added , after a short interval of reflection , " Look at <NAME> alone .
" And <NAME> and <NAME> both , as you have been to church to-day , and are in charity and love with all mankind , receive my humble thanks for all you have done for me , and all I have so ill repaid !
Nicholas ! ' cried <NAME> , starting in great astonishment .
His household gods are of flesh and blood , with no alloy of silver , gold , or precious stone ; he has no property but in the affections of his own heart ; and when they endear bare floors and walls , despite of rags and toil and scanty fare , that man has his love of home
Her time shall be ours by all means. ' While <NAME> bent upon his trembling friend a keen look , which showed that he perfectly understood the reason of this great consideration and regard , a footstep was heard upon the stairs , and <NAME> himself came into the room on tiptoe , and holding up his hand with
The poor schoolmaster motioned to the bachelor that he would come on the other side , and speak to him .
<NAME> to do with my proprietor ; not stateable at present , ridiculous to state at present ; but good .
What would you wish me to do to-day , brother ?
he cried , 'hard , fast , full gallop !
Then , in a distant Missionary way he asked them certain questions , -- as why little <NAME> had that hole in his frill , who said , <NAME> , <NAME> was going to mend it when she had time , -- and how little <NAME> came by that whitlow , who said , <NAME> , <NAME> was going
