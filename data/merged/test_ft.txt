__label__1	A minute ’ s silence , and he murmured the burden of some roaring song .
__label__1	I am <NAME> mere child , sir .
__label__0	He had visited <NAME> and the coast of <NAME> , when this far greater project occurred to him , one which was only accomplished sixteen hundred years later by <NAME> da Gama .
__label__1	‘ The friendliness of this gentleman , ’ said <NAME> to my aunt , ‘ if you will allow me , ma ’ am , to cull a figure of speech from the vocabulary of our coarser national sports -- floors me .
__label__1	Guess. ’ ‘ I am not good at guessing anything. ’ ‘ She did .
__label__0	`` Tell us , <NAME> , '' said <NAME> , `` something about <NAME> 's theatre ; did they act new plays there ? ''
__label__1	‘ I have no doubt , ’ returned Mr Carker , after an impressive pause , ‘ that wherever Gay is , he is much better where he is , than at home here .
__label__1	Mr Carker then handed him out of the room ; and <NAME> , keeping his round eyes fixed upon his patron to the last , vanished for the time being .
__label__0	<NAME> hesitated at first to reply , and <NAME> regretted that <NAME> had so thoughtlessly put this question .
__label__1	Except in the <NAME> at <NAME> ( where the judges wear a plain black robe ) , there is no such thing as a wig or gown connected with the administration of justice .
__label__1	In the morning , too , when I felt weary , and should have enjoyed another hour ’ s repose very much , it was a tiresome thing to be roused , like the <NAME> , and forced into a long story before the getting-up bell rang ; but <NAME> was resolute ; and as he explained to me , in return , my sums and exercises , and anything in my tasks that was too hard for me , I was no loser by the transaction .
__label__0	“ You can easily see , then , that time presses if we are to take part in these exploring labors .
__label__1	I encouraged <NAME> in this idea , because I felt that it might one day be consolatory to her .
__label__0	We disembarked on a stony coast .
__label__1	‘ I am fully aware of that .
__label__0	The solution of the most complicated problems of mathematical science was but sport to him .
__label__1	I hear nothing now , indeed .
__label__0	His first discovery was of a land of which the fertile and verdant aspect seems to have charmed him .
__label__1	I will pray for them , and believe that they will arrive .
__label__0	They lead a miserable life , go about half naked , and are constantly struck and insulted .
__label__0	`` Not more , captain , '' replied <NAME> .
__label__0	When the others wondered at the doctor 's prescriptions : `` This is the land of these complaints , '' he answered ; `` the cure must be near the disease . ''
__label__0	In all probability , and such was also <NAME> ’ s opinion , some had been left by formidable wild beasts which doubtless would give them some trouble ; but nowhere did they observe the mark of an axe on the trees , nor the ashes of a fire , nor the impression of a human foot .
__label__1	Without other announcement or ceremony , <NAME> walks in .
__label__1	Your feet are not wet ?
__label__0	Up to this point the president of the <NAME> had been satisfied with the turn which the discussion had assumed .
__label__1	‘ Here , you <NAME> , give me that box out of the straw ! ’ This was addressed to the gipsy , who crawled into the low tent on all fours , and after some rummaging and rustling returned with a cash-box , which the man who had spoken opened with a key he wore about his person .
__label__1	`` Besides , it 's not as if I was an accomplished girl who had any right to give herself airs , '' said <NAME> .
__label__1	All-Muggleton had the first innings ; and the interest became intense when <NAME> and <NAME> , two of the most renowned members of that most distinguished club , walked , bat in hand , to their respective wickets .
__label__1	I know the man , and know him to have been in communication with <NAME> before , respecting a deceased person who had given him offence .
__label__1	‘ Not I , indeed , ’ returned <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ We are all so -- so happy now , my dear <NAME> ! ’ says <NAME> , with a suspicious catching in her breath .
__label__0	You will see that is worth all the machinery in the world . ''
__label__1	This reminded <NAME> that the boy in gray was looking on , with eyes wide open , and greedy ears .
__label__1	‘ Is it no harm to have a constant hallooing and hooting under one ’ s very nose , distracting one from business , and making one grind one ’ s teeth with vexation ?
__label__1	But the vapor of a limekiln would come between me and them , disordering them all , and it was through the vapor at last that I saw two men looking at me .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , sir , ’ said his wife , ‘ is my particular friend ; ’ and although Mr Mantalini leered till his eyes seemed in danger of never coming back to their right places again , <NAME> showed no signs of softening .
__label__0	he is on the island ! ''
__label__0	The Major , who was always the surgeon on great occasions , began to strip the unfortunate that he might dress his wounds ; but he had scarcely put his hands on the dying man when he started up as if touched by an electrical machine .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> , <NAME> and I must examine her !
__label__1	I implore you not to add your death to the bitterness of mine. ” “ Do I ask you , my dear <NAME> , to pass the door ?
__label__1	‘ She ’ s very fond of you , <NAME> , though not so fond as I am .
__label__1	My hair had known no comb or brush since I left <NAME> .
__label__1	`` Ma wo n't be down for ever so long , '' she said , `` and then it 's a chance if breakfast 's ready for an hour afterwards , they dawdle so .
__label__1	I have a scheme to develop , little woman .
__label__0	He would no longer be looked upon as the rescuer of the sailing-master ; and the latter , learning that his brother -- Luckily , <NAME> and myself were the only two acquainted with the fact .
__label__1	It was a run indeed now , and what <NAME> called , in the only two words he spoke all the time , “ a Winder. ” Down banks and up banks , and over gates , and splashing into dikes , and breaking among coarse rushes : no man cared where he went .
__label__1	He sat up in bed and listened .
__label__1	Not we. ’ ‘ Do you mean to say , <NAME> , ’ inquired Mr <NAME> ; looking at him with marked displeasure , ‘ that you have called a child after a boiler ? ’ ‘ No , no , <NAME> , ’ returned <NAME> , with a tender consideration for his mistake .
__label__1	‘ Very bad , ’ said the landlord .
__label__0	<NAME> was warmly welcomed by the viceroy , and thus describes his first interview .
__label__0	Some of these large birds measured twenty feet from tip to tip ; they covered the whole launch with their expanded wings ; and there were legions of these birds , of which the names had never appeared in the <NAME> `` Index Ornithologus . ''
__label__0	At all events , there was one thing to be thankful for ; <NAME> was not with his master ; and it was above all important , after the confidences <NAME> had imparted to him , that the servant should never have speech with his master .
__label__0	At this noise Torres woke , and with the quickness of those who are always on the watch , with whom there is no transition from the sleeping to the waking state , was immediately on his legs .
__label__1	`` You said , dear guardian , when we spoke of <NAME> before <NAME> left us , that you thought he would give a long trial to another country .
__label__1	One evening , a holiday night with them , <NAME> and her grandfather went out to walk .
__label__0	the moon ’ s come back ! ” And , sure enough , what was apparently the moon was rising above the mists of evening .
__label__0	The officer in command of the detachment hastened up on hearing the report .
__label__0	Moreover , what was likely to take place , since , notwithstanding their losses , the followers of the sealing-master were still a majority of the ship 's company ?
__label__0	Tell me , is my father living ?
__label__0	`` Why not tell it at once then to a fellow that 's dying of impatience to know all about it ?
__label__1	‘ I wish you ’ d show me the palm of your hand , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	'Here they are , ' replied <NAME> , producing a pair of pistols .
__label__1	For my part , I could have gone through a good deal ( though I was much less brave than <NAME> , and nothing like so old ) to have won such a recompense .
__label__0	The <NAME> , as he was called in <NAME> , had two natives called <NAME> , and a boy about twelve years of age under him .
__label__1	They used to issue from the lodge on alternate Sunday afternoons with great gravity , bound for some meadows or green lanes that had been elaborately appointed by the turnkey in the course of the week ; and there she picked grass and flowers to bring home , while he smoked his pipe .
__label__0	A peak of about four thousand five hundred feet high , visible at a distance of eighteen or twenty leagues , rises in the centre of the island ; the land slopes gently from thence to the sea , so that the houses look like an amphitheatre .
__label__1	‘ I should be quite sure of it , from your saying so ; but what you tell me is confirmed by suppressed hints and references that I meet with every day. ’ ‘ Now , ’ <NAME> again resumed , in a tone of mild though firm persuasion , ‘ is not this to be regretted , and ought it not to be amended ?
__label__0	Judge <NAME> had worked himself into such a state of exasperation that there really was some fear that his mental faculties would lose their balance .
__label__1	Really , <NAME> -- ’ He turned to the other plump gentleman , and said , ‘ I forget your friend ’ s name. ’ ‘ Pickwick , ’ said <NAME> , for it was no other than that jolly personage .
__label__1	‘ You ’ re wery right , old friend , ’ said <NAME> ; ‘ I _do_ mean arternoon .
__label__1	‘ By the upsetting of a boat in which his nurse had no business to have put him , ’ said the Major .
__label__0	The captain and passengers do not prepare for their departure by offering propitiatory sacrifices ; and , on their return , they no longer go ornamented with wreaths and gilt fillets to thank the gods in the neighbouring temple . ''
__label__1	I didn ’ t know what to make of it , till this gentleman favoured us with his first visit .
__label__1	“ Grey-headed , ” as he said , “ and fast growing greyer. ” But generous , and frank , and good , I am sure. ’ ‘ And only seen once , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ In this room only once , ’ said his sister , with the slightest and most transient glow upon her cheek ; ‘ but when here , he entreated me to suffer him to see me once a week as he passed by , in token of our being well , and continuing to need nothing at his hands .
__label__1	And therefore if I were a <NAME> , I think I would be a Transcendentalist .
__label__0	“ <NAME> , ” continued <NAME> , “ Torres never gave a hint to put us on the track of his past life .
__label__0	This etext was done by a number of anonymous volunteers of the <NAME> , to whom we owe a great deal of thanks and to whom we dedicate this book .
__label__1	'Why , I suppose if I was n't , I should n't be here , ' replied <NAME> .
__label__1	And what ’ s this straggling about in an idle sort of a way ?
__label__1	Surrounded by these influences , they walked on pleasantly enough .
__label__1	And whether you have astonished them , and made them shrink in their shoes , or not ? ’ ‘ Go on to the next one , my dear <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	And what that deep red light in the opposite direction ?
__label__1	If I were to plead anything in mitigation of the preposterous fancy that a bad design will sometimes claim to be a good and an expressly religious design , it would be the curious coincidence that it has been brought to its climax in these pages , in the days of the public examination of late Directors of a <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ I don ’ t display camels myself , I am above them : I am a more solid man ; but these camels have basked in the light of my countenance , and how dare you , sir , insinuate to me that I have irradiated any but unimpeachable camels ? ’ The camels are polishing up in the <NAME> ’ s pantry for the dinner of wonderment on the occasion of the <NAME> going to pieces , and Mr Twemlow feels a little queer on the sofa at his lodgings over the stable yard in <NAME> , <NAME> ’ s , in consequence of having taken two advertised pills at about mid-day , on the faith of the printed representation accompanying the box ( price one and a penny halfpenny , government stamp included ) , that the same ‘ will be found highly salutary as a precautionary measure in connection with the pleasures of the table. ’ To whom , while sickly with the fancy of an insoluble pill sticking in his gullet , and also with the sensation of a deposit of warm gum languidly wandering within him a little lower down , a servant enters with the announcement that a lady wishes to speak with him .
__label__0	At that moment came a hurried tinkle from the telephone .
__label__1	A revival of the passing interest in the subject which had been by chance awakened at the door of the <NAME> Office , originated in this feeling .
__label__0	You see nothing but difficulties and obstacles .
__label__0	The king did not venture himself to go on board the <NAME> , but his son was of a bolder spirit , and inquired the reason of everything he saw with the most lively curiosity .
__label__0	The last supplies of the sledge , a little biscuit and some hot tea , gave them some comfort .
__label__1	As it approached , which it did very rapidly , it laboured with increased energy ; and , after knocking at the door , it sounded as if it were stooping down and snorting in at the keyhole .
__label__1	He was in no uneasiness concerning his getting into the house again , for it was full of lodgers , and the door stood ajar all night .
__label__0	And off he scampered like a young cat into the depths of the foliage , followed by his friend <NAME> .
__label__1	I thought Mrs. and <NAME> ( at whom I now glanced for the first time , and who were , both , thin and quiet ) were not disappointed .
__label__1	She takes a chair , looking straight at him as on the last occasion .
__label__0	The astronomical observations , rendered possible by the calculation of the satellites of <NAME> , enabled us to rectify our maps .
__label__0	After spending twenty-four days in this harbour , <NAME> put to sea again on the 3rd of November .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> , as I have already said , was grey-headed , and florid : I should have said all about him , in saying so , had not his head been curiously bowed -- not by age ; it reminded me of one of <NAME> ’ s boys ’ heads after a beating -- and his grey eyes prominent and large , with a strange kind of watery brightness in them that made me , in combination with his vacant manner , his submission to my aunt , and his childish delight when she praised him , suspect him of being a little mad ; though , if he were mad , how he came to be there puzzled me extremely .
__label__0	At that period of the world which preceded the secondary epoch , the earth was covered by a coating of enormous and rich vegetation , due to the double action of tropical heat and perpetual humidity .
__label__0	On the 4th , however , the sea became more calm , and the storm lessened its violence ; the wind veered southward , and was once more favourable .
__label__0	-- '' Therefore it 's a _parabola_ , and must be ! ''
__label__0	“ Here , ” replied <NAME> , after some hesitation tearing a leaf out of his note-book .
__label__0	“ What , it was not you ? ” asked <NAME> .
__label__0	The emotions of the day had left sad impressions on their minds .
__label__0	But no explosion properly so termed , could be heard .
__label__1	After perusing it , I taxed <NAME> with having many such letters in her possession ; and ultimately obtained from her the packet which is now in <NAME> ’ s hand. ’ Here she ceased ; and snapping her reticule again , and shutting her mouth , looked as if she might be broken , but could never be bent .
__label__1	‘ I have forgotten , <NAME> , ’ said Mrs. <NAME> ’ s mama , when we were seated , ‘ to pay you the compliments of the day -- though they are , as you may suppose , very far from being mere compliments in my case .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> ran hastily upstairs , and with a trembling hand opened the bag .
__label__1	Where am I to wait for her ?
__label__1	Said <NAME> convulsively wrestles with one of his many Gods or <NAME> , perhaps , and snarls horribly .
__label__1	‘ It hurts me so , ’ cried the poor body , ‘ to see him come back alone .
__label__1	Another cause of our being sometimes apart , was , that I had naturally an interest in going over to <NAME> , and revisiting the old familiar scenes of my childhood ; while <NAME> , after being there once , had naturally no great interest in going there again .
__label__0	I passed a terrible night .
__label__1	This place has taken my breath away , and I shall never get it back again until <NAME> is out of this place. ’ ‘ How is that a reason for going off again to-morrow morning ? ’ ‘ You shall understand , ’ said Mr Meagles .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> was painfully dazzled , and his sight sensibly changed .
__label__1	The day wore on , and all these bright colours subsided , and assumed a quieter tint , like young hopes softened down by time , or youthful features by degrees resolving into the calm and serenity of age .
__label__1	We will behold , and minutely examine , a scene so interesting to every Englishman. ’ ‘ We will , ’ was the animated cry of three voices .
__label__1	Every inch of the existence of mankind , from birth to death , was to be a bargain across a counter .
__label__0	Having wandered over vast continents , your eye is attracted by the `` seas '' of dimensions still vaster .
__label__1	Dressing myself as quietly as I could , and leaving <NAME> to look after my aunt , I tumbled head foremost into it , and then went for a walk to <NAME> .
__label__0	The time approached for the return of the monsoon , and its accompanying storms must be avoided on this coast ; above all , we must procure a boat to enable us to rejoin the _Naturaliste_ . ''
__label__1	‘ You would not give her pain ? ’ ‘ I am not so sure of that , if it would only rouse her .
__label__1	It ’ s my way to speak my mind , <NAME> , and that is my mind ; and if you don ’ t like it , it ’ s past my regular time for going to bed , and I can find my way home without making it later. ’ Here was an untoward event !
__label__1	<NAME> bowed and stepped forward .
__label__1	Making towards a faint gleam of light which streamed across the pavement from a cellar , <NAME> was about to descend two or three steps so as to render himself visible to those below and make his inquiry , when he was arrested by a loud noise of scolding in a woman ’ s voice .
__label__0	No one was ignorant of the lengths to which the widow would go when the celebrated calculator was in peril .
__label__0	The orderly shook his head dubiously .
__label__1	What do you say , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ I say , aunt , ’ I interposed , ‘ that I must do something ! ’ ‘ Go for a soldier , do you mean ? ’ returned my aunt , alarmed ; ‘ or go to sea ?
__label__1	But if she knew I was ill , she must have pitied me , even there ; for she was very ill herself before she died .
__label__0	He was unwilling to leave the young <NAME> girl alone on board , as she had not yet reappeared on deck .
__label__1	So far from that , I had no doubt of her being prepared to have a great reliance on him and to like him very much .
__label__1	<NAME> day to you , gentlemen ; good day ! ''
__label__0	He and <NAME> had surveyed the coast for a distance of eight miles and consequently much beyond the place where the balloon had fallen the last time but one , a fall which was followed by the disappearance of the engineer and the dog Top .
__label__0	In reality , however , it was the <NAME> , which grows solitarily on the <NAME> plains .
__label__1	Had I given <NAME> no reason to doubt my constancy , and to think that in prosperity I should grow cold to him and cast him off ?
__label__1	These had been oiled and oiled , until the two tall candles on the table in the middle of the room were gloomily reflected on every leaf ; as if _they_ were buried , in deep graves of black mahogany , and no light to speak of could be expected from them until they were dug out .
__label__1	Having inspected the docks and shipping , and viewed the cathedral , he inquired his way to <NAME> , and being directed thither , took the route which was pointed out to him .
__label__0	The largest of these , <NAME> , is not less than seventy-two miles from one side to the other ; the low shorage consists mainly of swamp and morass , while the banks , which run up steeply , are surrounded by coral reefs , and are full of small caves hollowed out by the waves .
__label__0	The hardest heart would have been moved to see this hamlet , lost among these horrible solitudes .
__label__1	They told me he was there .
__label__0	The difference between the image and the reality could scarcely be described .
__label__1	You can put on the cards and in the advertisements , “ Education by <NAME> and able assistants , ” without having any assistants , can ’ t you ?
__label__0	`` I do n't know about that , '' was the <NAME> 's reply , `` but I do know that this formula is wonderfully come at . ''
__label__0	In the outer world , the day was one of the hottest of the month of <NAME> , peculiarly oppressive in northern countries .
__label__1	He would have raised his hands and besought her for pardon , but she caught them in her own , and put them down , hurriedly .
__label__0	This monster , this natural phenomenon that had puzzled the learned world , and over thrown and misled the imagination of seamen of both hemispheres , it must be owned was a still more astonishing phenomenon , inasmuch as it was a simply human construction .
__label__1	I ’ ll drink her health again , and her father ’ s , and her mother ’ s ; and to all her sisters and brothers -- the glorious family of the <NAME> -- all the <NAME> in one glass -- down with it to the dregs ! ’ ‘ Well , ’ said <NAME> , stopping short in the act of raising the glass to his lips and looking at the dwarf in a species of stupor as he flourished his arms and legs about : ‘ you ’ re a jolly fellow , but of all the jolly fellows I ever saw or heard of , you have the queerest and most extraordinary way with you , upon my life you have. ’ This candid declaration tended rather to increase than restrain Mr Quilp ’ s eccentricities , and <NAME> , astonished to see him in such a roystering vein , and drinking not a little himself , for company -- began imperceptibly to become more companionable and confiding , so that , being judiciously led on by Mr Quilp , he grew at last very confiding indeed .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> walked in the middle of the road , shouldering the natives out of his way , and loudly developing a scheme he had , for making a raid on all the unemployed persons in the <NAME> , laying them every one by the heels in jail , and forcing them , on pain of prompt extermination , to become philanthropists .
__label__1	But , according to the success with which you put this and that together , you get a woman and a fish apart , or a Mermaid in combination .
__label__0	<NAME> , far from being , as at the present day , an act falling under the ban of the law , was not only encouraged in that barbarous or half-civilized society , but was celebrated in the songs of the <NAME> , who reserved their most enthusiastic eulogies for celebrating chivalrous struggles , adventurous privateering , and all exhibitions of strength .
__label__0	They could now look back at the lunar mountains that they had been just sailing over -- a view somewhat like that enjoyed by a tourist standing on the summit of <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ You are , sir , I perceive , a man of sense and talent , ’ said <NAME> , almost breathless with the vehemence of his patriotic declaration .
__label__1	‘ How can I care a pinch of snuff for <NAME> , when I think of that ‘ ere darling child ?
__label__1	Not they , but they 'll be upon the minds of some of the young fellows , some of these days , and make 'em precious low-spirited .
__label__0	In <NAME> 's rooms at <NAME> the commander was shown , together with a number of weapons , shells , animals , fish , & c. , a complete mummy of a <NAME> , said to be that of a woman .
__label__1	After a moment of suspense , I went and kissed my mother : she kissed me , patted me gently on the shoulder , and sat down again to her work .
__label__1	But why my Uncle shouldn ’ t write to you , when he so clearly intended to do so , or how he should die abroad , and you not know it through some other hand , I can not make out. ’ Captain <NAME> observed , with a shake of his head , that <NAME> himself hadn ’ t made it out , and that he was a man as could give a pretty taut opinion too .
__label__1	I hope you have your health , and are enjoying yourself. ’ There might have been a touch of impertinence in the last words ; on the other hand , it might have been but the native grace of Mr Fledgeby ’ s manner .
__label__0	The lieutenant had taken up the glass and examined the horizon steadfastly , going and coming , stamping his foot and showing more nervous agitation than his superior officer .
__label__0	A semicircular screen of trees still hid it .
__label__0	The sweet potatoes , cooked in the burning soil , were excellent .
__label__0	The poor dog had died after he had done his fell work , in a corner on the beach , where <NAME> found his skeleton and the collar bearing the name of <NAME> .
__label__1	Well , ” returned <NAME> , going on again , and lifting off his hat to give his spikes free play , “ he 's a tradesman. ” “ What 's his goods , father ? ” asked the brisk Young <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> is , that being thoroughly waked , they get up wery quietly , and walk away ! ’ ‘ Beg your pardon , sir , ’ said <NAME> , suddenly breaking off in his loquacious discourse .
__label__0	The two young men carried in addition , in their belts , a sort of dagger-knife , which is known in <NAME> as a _ “ foca , ” _ and which hunters do not hesitate to use when attacking the ounce and other wild animals which , if not very formidable , are pretty numerous in these forests .
__label__1	I am so accustomed to the habit that I could hardly live if I relinquished it : but there ’ s nothing doing , nothing doing .
__label__0	However , the travellers ' eyes were soon able to trace the rest of the <NAME> 's surface not only with facility , but even to follow its outline with absolute delight .
__label__1	‘ Then , ’ says Mr Venus , looking up , after meditating with his hair held in his hands , as if he could only fix his attention by fixing his head ; ‘ if anything was to be unburied from under the dust , it would be kept a secret by you and me ?
__label__0	<NAME> had followed me for the last ten years wherever science led .
__label__0	He only thought of when the <NAME> , free at last , should resume her bold course .
__label__0	But what has become of its motion ?
__label__0	292 Eucalyptus forest of <NAME> .
__label__1	'Your behaviour has ever been kind and noble . '
__label__1	He saw her , and he said , in an undertone : ‘ <NAME> ! ’ <NAME> fell upon his neck , with tears , and then he said , returning her embrace : ‘ My child , my child !
__label__0	<NAME> gave him his directions as a commander to his steersman , and <NAME> never allowed the “ Bonadventure ” to swerve even a point .
__label__0	<NAME> and <NAME> were informed of the condition of affairs , and they resolved to keep a strict watch .
__label__1	‘ Any news of the young gentleman who is so important to us all ? ’ asked <NAME> , with his whole regiment of teeth on parade .
__label__1	`` Really , sir , I think she might , '' said Mrs. Blinder , getting her heavy breath by painful degrees .
__label__0	The sailors hesitated an instant .
__label__1	<NAME> ’ t you think he ought , Mrs. Rogers , ma ’ am ? ’ Oh , certainly , ma ’ am , ’ replied Mrs. Rogers ; after whom all the other ladies responded , ‘ Oh , certainly. ’ ‘ Of course I feel it , ma ’ am , ’ said <NAME> , rubbing his hands , and evincing a slight tendency to brighten up a little .
__label__1	‘ What man , ’ thought <NAME> proudly , while on his way , soon afterwards , to the brothers ’ house , ‘ would not be sufficiently rewarded for any sacrifice of fortune by the possession of such a heart as <NAME> ’ s , which , but that hearts weigh light , and gold and silver heavy , is beyond all praise ?
__label__0	The navy was recruited in those days by means of pressgangs .
__label__0	The coquetry which is innate in the female mind , induces them to add to their natural charms by the use of a labial ornament , as ugly as it is inconvenient , of which we have already spoken in our account of <NAME> 's stay in these waters .
__label__0	The emigrants after sighting <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , landed in an island , upon which they constructed some barracks and began the work of cultivation .
__label__0	At one time he was ordered to seize all the <NAME> ships lying in the <NAME> ports , in revenge for the capture by <NAME> pirates during a time of peace of a rich <NAME> galleon returning from <NAME> .
__label__1	`` Were you examined at an inquest ? ''
__label__1	You seem to know all about ‘ em , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> at <NAME> and <NAME> !
__label__1	'But where can I find you again when it is necessary ? '
__label__0	cried <NAME> ; `` if we ever become Selenites we must inhabit the visible side .
__label__1	In our station-houses , men and women are every night confined on the most trivial charges -- the word is worth noting -- in dungeons , compared with which , those in <NAME> , occupied by the most atrocious felons , tried , found guilty , and under sentence of death , are palaces .
__label__1	There ’ s no such name now .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> ‘ dresses at ’ the <NAME> ; has been bowed to for the <NAME> , in mistake ; has even been spoken to in the street as <NAME> , under the impression that he was the <NAME> come down unexpectedly , without his chaplain .
__label__1	“ What ’ s your motive ? ” ’ ‘ Exactly. ’ ‘ Motive , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ good .
__label__0	`` Nothing at all , my boy .
__label__0	This was said in a tone which quenched <NAME> 's last hope .
__label__0	A fact indeed ; and it was this counter-current by which the <NAME> profited .
__label__0	What seemed easy at <NAME> , seemed here in the wide ocean almost impossible .
__label__1	‘ A new one ? ’ I repeated .
__label__0	“ <NAME> , ” said <NAME> , “ pull yourself together !
__label__0	It bears the creature which secretes it without its adhering to it .
__label__0	Suddenly <NAME> uttered a fresh bark and darted towards a gigantic bird which had swooped down .
__label__0	Nevertheless he seemed to have decided upon one , for that evening he sent for the engineer , and said to him , `` Feed all the fires until the coal is exhausted . ''
__label__1	At the expiration of the term , steadily adhering to his old resolution and the pledge he gave his mother , he made his way back to <NAME> amidst innumerable difficulties , and returned , on foot , to his native place .
__label__0	`` Well , and here we 've found one in the air ! ''
__label__1	I have been a weak child .
__label__1	That he is killed ? ’ ‘ He is dead , then ! ’ exclaimed <NAME> .
__label__0	In a word , the crew had taken courage again .
__label__0	<NAME> was destined almost entirely to carry out this detailed plan , only the survey of the western coast of <NAME> and of the <NAME> of <NAME> , with that of the channel closing the <NAME> , could not be accomplished by the <NAME> navigator , who had , sorely against his will , to leave the completion of this important task to his successors .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> must , we calculated , be very much to the westward .
__label__1	It is so very unusual to find you here at this hour .
__label__0	`` Take this telescope , '' said <NAME> , `` and look carefully , <NAME> , for it is possible that this ship may be the <NAME> come to these seas for the purpose of taking you home again . ''
__label__1	I have looked at her when it has been such torture to me to think of her shining upon what I had lost , that I have beaten my head against my prison-walls .
__label__0	`` We are now , '' continued the Professor , `` exactly thirty-five leagues -- above a hundred miles -- down into the interior of the earth . ''
__label__1	By little and little he began ; laying down his knife and fork with a noise , taking things up sharply , biting at his bread as if he were offended with it , and in other similar ways showing that he was out of sorts .
__label__1	‘ Allow me , ’ said <NAME> suddenly , ‘ to ask how <NAME> is ? ’ He leaned forward obsequiously , as he made the inquiry , with his chin resting on his hand ; and at the same time his eyes went up to the picture , as if he said to it , ‘ Now , see , how I will lead him on ! ’ Mr <NAME> reddened as he answered : ‘ Mrs Dombey is quite well .
__label__1	But you are coming my way .
__label__0	`` What became of these poor men , deprived of their leader , during the next ten months ?
__label__1	Played a match once -- single wicket- -friend the colonel -- <NAME> -- who should get the greatest number of runs. -- Won the toss -- first innings -- seven o ’ clock A.M. -- six natives to look out -- went in ; kept in -- heat intense -- natives all fainted -- taken away -- fresh half-dozen ordered -- fainted also -- <NAME> bowling -- supported by two natives -- couldn ’ t bowl me out -- fainted too -- cleared away the colonel -- wouldn ’ t give in -- faithful attendant -- <NAME> -- last man left -- sun so hot , bat in blisters , ball scorched brown -- five hundred and seventy runs -- rather exhausted -- <NAME> mustered up last remaining strength -- bowled me out -- had a bath , and went out to dinner. ’ ‘ And what became of what ’ s-his-name , <NAME> ? ’ inquired an old gentleman .
__label__1	I hope the upholsterer may do the same. ’ ‘ Why shouldn ’ t he ? ’ asked <NAME> , from the other side of the fire .
__label__0	With some imagination and a little artistic feeling the result was highly satisfactory .
__label__0	He spoke quietly without departing from the calm he had imposed upon himself , without omitting any circumstances which had preceded or succeeded his condemnation .
__label__0	As for me , I should not have cared to ship in her . ''
__label__0	<NAME> was the last English ground on which he would set foot ; beyond , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> offered to <NAME> an almost certain refuge .
__label__0	<NAME> detonations , like <NAME> 's artillery , began to multiply themselves with fearful intensity .
__label__1	‘ I suppose it is , now you mention it .
__label__1	It is approached by a road that takes its winding way among the heights by which the town is sheltered ; and seen from this point is extremely beautiful and picturesque .
__label__0	The admiral , accused of high treason , was placed with his two brothers on board a vessel bound for <NAME> , under the command of <NAME> de <NAME> .
__label__0	The latter are proud and haughty , too vain to be civil , and too shrewd to be honest ; yet they appear to understand somewhat of the nature of love and the social affections , are warm in their attachments , and keen in their resentments . ''
__label__0	Both of them stopped before <NAME> and her people .
__label__0	<NAME> will bring provisions , and there will be no lack of fire to cook the food. ” “ No , ” replied the reporter ; “ but if there is a lack of food for want of instruments for the chase ? ” “ Ah , if we only had a knife ! ” cried the sailor .
__label__0	The robbers had left him nothing , the greater part of his baggage had been rifled . ''
__label__1	For , believe me , I speak the truth ; the most abject poverty , the most wretched condition of human life , with a pure and upright mind , would be happiness to that which you must undergo as the wife of such a man as this ! ’ <NAME> before <NAME> ceased to speak , the young lady buried her face in her hands , and gave her tears free way .
__label__0	it ’ s natural enough that they should be astonished , ” said the doctor .
__label__1	The service over , and the clergyman withdrawn , Mr Dombey looks round , demanding in a low voice , whether the person who has been requested to attend to receive instructions for the tablet , is there ?
__label__0	It even numbers two thousand three hundred and ninety-three souls , allowing one soul to each inhabitant .
__label__1	As it stood open , and as I knew that <NAME> had let the visitors out , -- for she had returned with the keys in her hand , -- I strolled into the garden , and strolled all over it .
__label__1	‘ I ’ ll trouble you also , if you please , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ with this card and this shilling .
__label__1	I lie in a shady place like this and think of adventurous spirits going to the <NAME> or penetrating to the heart of the <NAME> with admiration .
__label__0	<NAME> having arrived at <NAME> , met a certain <NAME> Calve who had lately come from the Canaries , and who offered to return thither with all the things needed by the governor , but <NAME> could not agree to this proposal before he had seen the king .
__label__0	“ All that remains of our stock of pemmican ; that will be thirty pounds less weight to carry. ” “ Out it goes , sir ! ” said <NAME> , obeying orders .
__label__0	Now , if we turn our efforts in that direction , we ought to arrive , with the progress on science , at ten times the weight of the shot of <NAME> .
__label__0	It was more than absurd , it was alarming .
__label__1	One , of a female , over the door , he called ‘ The <NAME> of the Lake. ’ He smiled as I looked at these contrivances to while away the time ; but when I looked from them to him , I saw that his lip trembled , and could have counted the beating of his heart .
__label__0	But they required to know more than the general truth , and felt that they had no time to lose in getting at the exact details .
__label__0	At the close of this expedition , which was almost entirely unproductive , we lose sight of <NAME> , if not completely , at least so as to be insufficiently informed about his deeds and voyages until 1517 .
__label__0	<NAME> saw that he was locking himself in .
__label__1	What you have overcome in yourself , can you not overcome in him ?
__label__0	The valley of the <NAME> was already sunk in shadow , and night was fast drawing her mantle over the eastern slopes of the Andes .
__label__1	Look out in that direction. ’ ‘ Sir , it shall be done. ’ ‘ Casting my eye over the accounts , I find that branch of business pays pretty fairly , and I am game for extending it .
__label__0	Besides , the moon disappeared then , and left us in total darkness .
__label__1	I hid my tears in the bedclothes , and pressed her from me with my hand , when she would have raised me up .
__label__1	The old girl has another trial to undergo after the conclusion of the repast in sitting in state to see the room cleared , the hearth swept , and the dinner-service washed up and polished in the backyard .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> had the clay watered to loosen it , but it was of no use .
__label__1	I ’ ll make him a true prophet , for it shall surely come. ’ ‘ Are you at home ? ’ asked <NAME> , suddenly popping in his head .
__label__1	But even <NAME> , with her loving face -- and if it had seemed innocent and trusting when I first saw it in that memorable November fog , how much more did it seem now when I knew her innocent and trusting heart -- even <NAME> shook her head at this and looked serious .
__label__1	But now , <NAME> arrived .
__label__0	Therefore it is that I say again to <NAME> frankly that I do not like his going off alone to hunt. ” “ But still , <NAME> , you will permit me to indulge that fancy a little .
__label__1	Throw it in the fire ! ’ <NAME> did as she was bidden , and waited for the next .
__label__1	'Let 's have a glim , ' said <NAME> , 'or we shall go breaking our necks , or treading on the dog .
__label__1	‘ She is such a dear girl ! ’ said <NAME> ; ‘ a little older than me , but the dearest girl !
__label__0	The minister of <NAME> , who had seen <NAME> 's proposition well received by the <NAME> , decided to entrust its examination to a ship 's officer , who was accustomed to work of the kind .
__label__0	“ It is a very delicate instrument , your Excellency .
__label__0	If our world has become so insignificant a spheroid , not only has its gravity diminished , but its rotary speed has been accelerated ; and this affords an adequate explanation of our days and nights being thus curtailed .
__label__0	`` You believe in this journey around the world , then ? ''
__label__1	“ Yes , ma'am ; I could do that , if I was wanted. ” “ Since this house strikes you old and grave , boy , ” said <NAME> , impatiently , “ and you are unwilling to play , are you willing to work ? ” I could answer this inquiry with a better heart than I had been able to find for the other question , and I said I was quite willing .
__label__1	That without any affectation of disparaging such professional distinction as I may have attained ( which our friend <NAME> will have many opportunities of estimating ) , I am not so weak -- no , really , '' said <NAME> to us generally , `` so unreasonable -- as to put my reputation on the same footing with such first-rate men as <NAME> and <NAME> .
__label__1	Yet he was as submissive to a word of advice as if he had been in constant terror ; for , when we ran ashore to get some bottles of beer into the boat , and he was stepping out , I hinted that I thought he would be safest where he was , and he said .
__label__1	‘ I prefer to remain at home .
__label__0	The most obvious inference would therefore be that the earth ’ s distance from the sun had been diminished from 91,000,000 to 66,000,000 miles .
__label__1	I turned cold all over sometimes , for I could see myself as I was then , coming in at the very same door. ’ ‘ As you were then , ’ repeated <NAME> , with assumed carelessness ; ‘ how was that ? ’ ‘ Such a little creature , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ that they might have had pity and mercy upon me , only to remember it. ’ ‘ You didn ’ t find your way there , alone ! ’ remarked <NAME> .
__label__0	But <NAME> bravely set the example , and <NAME> was not the last to imitate him .
__label__0	“ What did you do with them ? ” “ The convicts ? ” replied <NAME> , with the air of a man who does not in the least understand what he is being asked .
__label__0	On the 19th of October , another fearful hurricane broke the mast of this vessel , which had then to make more than two thousand miles with incomplete sails .
__label__1	They then parted good friends , and <NAME> walked away .
__label__1	‘ I am in no difficulty , ’ exclaimed <NAME> , ‘ and in no hurry .
__label__0	“ I only hope my husband will succeed , for the poor children ’ s sake , ” said his cousin .
__label__1	<NAME> , <NAME> , it would do us no harm to remember oftener than we do , that vices are sometimes only virtues carried to excess !
__label__1	We name our fondlings in alphabetical order .
__label__0	The doctor would gladly have gone out to reconnoitre , but how could he with such a wind raging ?
__label__1	I am extremely sorry to see this in you , <NAME> , ” I repeated .
__label__1	The cottage is not what it was .
__label__0	Many of them appeared to be ten miles wide and hundreds of miles in length .
__label__0	It is impossible to conceive a wilder prospect , or a more savage and frightful one than this country from the sea , because from every point of view nothing is visible but the summits of rocks ; so close to each other that in lieu of valleys there are only fissures between them .
__label__0	However that might be , the English were at a loss to guess why the natives prevented their penetrating to the interior of the country .
__label__1	‘ I entreat <NAME> to bear with me in entering into these details .
__label__1	Go and sit down this instant ! ” “ Mamma dear , ” lisped the little girl , “ baby ood have put hith eyeth out. ” “ How dare you tell me so ? ” retorted Mrs. Pocket .
__label__0	The route followed in this first voyage having had no result towards the north , <NAME> would try another , and accordingly set sail on April 21st in the following year , and advanced between <NAME> and <NAME> ; but he could only follow for a certain distance the coast of that vast land , without being able to attain as high an elevation as he had wished .
__label__0	The pirates would think that they had to deal with numerous and well-armed adversaries , whom they could not easily get the better of .
__label__0	This incident reminded me that other animals more to be feared might haunt these obscure depths , against whose attacks my diving-dress would not protect me .
__label__0	In a word , the <NAME> had to own their powerlessness .
__label__0	The weather was splendid , the heat being tempered by the refreshing breezes which blew from off the <NAME> , and everything invited them out for an excursion into the country .
__label__1	Year by year , it must and will go back ; year by year , the tone of public feeling must sink lower down ; year by year , the <NAME> and the <NAME> must become of less account before all decent men ; and year by year , the memory of the <NAME> Fathers of the <NAME> must be outraged more and more , in the bad life of their degenerate child .
__label__1	Have you seen how anxious the old man is to get on -- always wanting to be furder away -- furder away .
__label__0	The excitement produced by the return of this man alone was intense ; who , after this , would accompany <NAME> in his bold attempts ?
__label__1	`` What have you done with your candle ? ''
__label__0	<NAME> noon the wind freshened , and increased the force of the storm .
__label__1	His worship knew this perfectly well ; but it was a good annoyance , and a safe one .
__label__0	A gesture of his might destroy me , a single word chain me on board .
__label__1	He held her , almost as if she were sanctified to him by death , and kissed her , once , almost as he might have kissed the dead .
__label__1	‘ You have a son , I believe ? ’ said Mr Dombey .
__label__1	Again and again the old lady hangs upon her son 's neck , and again and again the trooper holds her to his broad chest .
__label__0	A hundred arms were ready , and <NAME> ’ s revolver was snatched from him .
__label__0	Our legs refused to carry us ; and I then understood the picturesque expression of <NAME> , when , in narrating his first ascent , he said that `` his legs seemed only to be kept up by his trousers ! ''
__label__0	The night was dark and cold .
__label__0	or 3° below zero , but we were warmly clad with fur , at the expense of the sea-bear and seal .
__label__1	We learnt , however , as the time went on , that a new application was made to the <NAME> on <NAME> 's behalf as an infant and a ward , and I do n't know what , and that there was a quantity of talking , and that the <NAME> Chancellor described him in open court as a vexatious and capricious infant , and that the matter was adjourned and readjourned , and referred , and reported on , and petitioned about until <NAME> began to doubt ( as he told us ) whether , if he entered the army at all , it would not be as a veteran of seventy or eighty years of age .
__label__0	Was it to be conjectured that a fragment of the earth had been chipped off by the collision of a comet ?
__label__1	Though all unseen , and unsuspected by the pupils , <NAME> even pervaded the school exercises .
__label__0	The pilot walked away a little distance , and gazed out to sea , evidently struggling between the anxiety to gain a large sum and the fear of venturing so far .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , help your master up to the box ; t ’ other leg , <NAME> , that ’ s it ; give us your hand , <NAME> .
__label__1	If I have not ( Macbeth-like ) broken up the feast with most admired disorder , Daisy. ’ ‘ But where are they all , I wonder ! ’ said I .
__label__0	The effect of the apparition was prodigious .
__label__1	‘ No , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ I ain ’ t .
__label__1	And let it be added , to <NAME> ’ s honour , that , though we have called her <NAME> , he called her the <NAME> from first to last ; and that upon every anniversary of the day on which he found her in his sick room , Mr <NAME> came to dinner , and there was great glorification .
__label__0	It could be seen that there existed , in round numbers , a difference of five hours between the meridian of <NAME> and that of <NAME> , that is to say , it was midday in <NAME> when it was already five o ’ clock in the evening in <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> ! ’ was the only reply .
__label__1	What do you mean ? ’ ‘ I merely mean that as I shall have many dealings with this lady , if she will kindly allow me , I will not trouble her with such forms , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	“ Dead , ” repeated <NAME> ; “ but this man , whom I knew a long time after his crime , and without knowing that he was a convict , had written out at length , in his own hand , the story of this affair of the diamonds , even to the smallest details .
__label__0	<NAME> as is the picture <NAME> draws of the character and manners of this tribe , it is not at all edifying .
__label__1	Still , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ I need not point out to you , <NAME> , that it is governed by the laws which govern lives in the aggregate. ’ ‘ While it lasts , I would wish to do the little I can , and the little I am fit for .
__label__1	‘ You will communicate with us again ? ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	“ Excuse me , your majesty , ” stammered the chief of police , for that was really the idea suggested to him by his uneasy and suspicious mind .
__label__1	The <NAME> ’ s concern for his friend , not unmingled , at first , with some concern for himself -- for a shadowy terror that he might be married by violence , possessed him , until his knowledge of the service came to his relief , and remembering the legal obligation of saying , ‘ I will , ’ he felt himself personally safe so long as he resolved , if asked any question , distinctly to reply ‘ I won ’ t ’ -- threw him into a profuse perspiration ; and rendered him , for a time , insensible to the movements of the procession , of which he now formed a feature , and to the conversation of his fair companion .
__label__1	Then he slowly broke silence , and slowly said : ‘ What -- the -- Dev-il is this fellow about this morning ? ’ ‘ Now , look here , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , with the meanest of twinkles in his meanest of eyes : which were too near together , by the way : ‘ look here , <NAME> ; I am very well aware that I didn ’ t show to advantage last night , and that you and your wife -- who , I consider , is a very clever woman and an agreeable woman -- did .
__label__0	This strange and sonorous cry was produced by a game bird called grouse in the <NAME> .
__label__0	The <NAME> was still walking up and down with an agitated step .
__label__1	The light cart in which the <NAME> usually made his perambulations being gaily dressed with flags and streamers , and the <NAME> placed therein , contemplating the miniature of his beloved as usual , <NAME> was accommodated with a seat beside him , decorated with artificial flowers , and in this state and ceremony rode slowly through the town every morning , dispersing handbills from a basket , to the sound of drum and trumpet .
__label__1	Come ! ’ ‘ Yes , <NAME> , ’ returned the <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Why , it ’ s that very house ; she ’ s been living there these six weeks .
__label__1	With her woful eyes , so haggard and wild , so heavy and large , she looked all round the room , and passed the corner where he slept in his chair .
__label__0	`` A mere matter of detail , a bagatelle , '' said <NAME> .
__label__1	If I had wanted anything by which to mark this night of our re-union , I should have found it in this .
__label__0	During these preparations Harding arranged everything for his astronomical observation .
__label__0	D'Urville received his appointment in December , 1825 , and was permitted himself to choose all who were to accompany him .
__label__1	‘ Assuredly. ’ ‘ Why , I have not mentioned , <NAME> , ’ said I , a little embarrassed , ‘ that <NAME> is rather difficult to -- I would not , for the world , say , to rely upon , because she is the soul of purity and truth -- but rather difficult to -- I hardly know how to express it , really , <NAME> .
__label__0	At eight o ’ clock , its form , indistinct though it still was , seemed almost a reproduction of <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> informed me that the academy had been lent , last night , for a concert .
__label__0	Since the rise of the great fisheries , this <NAME> has been frequented by numerous whalemen , who here find a safe port at all seasons , plenty of wood and water , turtles for six months of the year , fish , and immense quantities of anti-scorbutic plants , including the delicious savoy cabbage .
__label__1	Only one among them , one of the gentlemen belonging to the party of three , made advances towards conversation .
__label__1	The feeling which beset the child was one of dim uncertain horror .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> recovered his senses , and fell into his old comrade 's arms .
__label__1	While he was yet yielding himself up to these fancies he fell asleep , and , dreaming of <NAME> , forgot them .
__label__1	`` How long have you known it ? ''
__label__1	I am not sure that it may not be worth while , before long , to take credit with the stranger , <NAME> , by discovering your designs upon the child ; but for the present we ’ ll remain the best friends in the world , with your good leave. ’ Pursuing these thoughts , and gasping as he went along , after his own peculiar fashion , Mr Quilp once more crossed the <NAME> , and shut himself up in his <NAME> ’ s <NAME> , which , by reason of its newly-erected chimney depositing the smoke inside the room and carrying none of it off , was not quite so agreeable as more fastidious people might have desired .
__label__0	They knew that <NAME> coinage is all decimal , the franc being the standard of which the other coins , whether gold , silver , or copper , are multiples or measures ; they knew , too , that the caliber or diameter of each piece of money is rigorously determined by law , and that the diameters of the silver coins representing five francs , two francs , and fifty centimes measure thirty-seven , twenty-seven , and eighteen millimeters respectively ; and they accordingly guessed that <NAME> had conceived the plan of placing such a number of these coins in juxtaposition that the length of their united diameters should measure exactly the thousand millimeters that make up the terrestrial meter .
__label__1	Ai n't the lady the t'other lady ? ''
__label__1	You confuse me , and how can I transact business if I am confused ?
__label__0	[ Illustration : `` This drifting floe was covered with white bears , crowded together . '' ]
__label__1	He turned at the grated door , to render the thanks of his heart ; it closed under the gaoler 's hand ; and the apparitions vanished from his sight forever .
__label__1	Wake up , some of you ! ''
__label__1	These being cast on the floor in a promiscuous heap , yielded a quantity of occupation in arranging , erecting , and putting away ; the superintendence of which task evidently afforded the old gentleman extreme delight , and engaged him for some time with great briskness and activity .
__label__1	She knows that there ’ s nobody in the world I look up to , as I do to Miss <NAME> .
__label__1	Not even my friends here -- ’ ‘ Except on one occasion , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	The engineer gazed about him with a saddened eye .
__label__0	“ We are right in the open desert , ” said the doctor .
__label__0	From that moment their companions were never to see them more .
__label__1	I hope and do not doubt it will be agreeable to see him , even though a gentleman , for you had ever a good heart , and he is a worthy , worthy man .
__label__1	Let my arm go ! ’ ‘ Not yet .
__label__1	Here was a new inducement to dissipation , presented to that sport of circumstances , Mr Perch the Messenger !
__label__1	Through the heart of the town a deadly sewer ebbed and flowed , in the place of a fine fresh river .
__label__1	Seven-and-sixpence to me , old Isaac .
__label__0	Six days passed in fruitless search ; fortunately not wholly wasted , as many curious observations were made on behalf of science .
__label__0	| | | | | | | | Hector <NAME> | 10 6 | 5 0 | 3 6 | | | | | The <NAME> | 10 6 | 5 0 | 3 6 | 2 vols. , | | | | 1s .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> tells me , <NAME> , ’ he eagerly began on coming in -- but stopped when he saw her face .
__label__0	Now he had noticed that if the English were in a minority with regard to the early discoveries , that if it was necessary to go back to <NAME> to make sure of <NAME> in 1774 , and of the <NAME> Islands where he was killed in 1778 , there was nevertheless one corner of the globe on which they had centred all their efforts .
__label__1	When <NAME> has a matter of this pressing interest under his consideration , the fat forefinger seems to rise , to the dignity of a familiar demon .
__label__1	As he led them into the drawing-room , the recollection of the scene which had taken place there seemed to occur to him , for he cast a curious look at <NAME> , who bestowed upon it no other acknowledgment than a careless smile .
__label__0	Perhaps the bears , if they caught sight of nothing , might be thrown off the track ; or , if they were met singly , they might be attacked successfully .
__label__1	What is this ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , <NAME> ! ’ said <NAME> timidly ; sensible of having approached the presence with too much familiarity .
__label__1	‘ I may grow rich ! ’ repeated <NAME> , with a mournful smile , ‘ ay , and I may grow old !
__label__0	And yet <NAME> , as has been said , is not the capital of this important province .
__label__0	The examination was obviously satisfactory , for he entered the loja .
__label__1	Through the munificence of Mr Boffin .
__label__0	<NAME> now believed himself to be arrived near the mouth of the <NAME> , and from the natives speaking of a certain province of <NAME> , which was surrounded by the sea , he felt himself confirmed in this opinion .
__label__1	He awoke refreshed , and they continued their journey .
__label__1	_In_ all the public establishments of <NAME> , the utmost courtesy prevails .
__label__0	`` Can we see <NAME> ? ''
__label__1	<NAME> , dear , I am changed .
__label__1	There are a few children employed in these factories , but not many .
__label__0	The lift was put in motion , and <NAME> was soon stretched on his bed in <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ How his ideas flow , don ’ t they ? ’ ‘ Wonderful , ’ replied <NAME> ; ‘ they comes a-pouring out , knocking each other ’ s heads so fast , that they seems to stun one another ; you hardly know what he ’ s arter , do you ? ’ That ’ s the great merit of his style of speaking , ’ rejoined <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ I see I take you with me !
__label__1	<NAME> is the difference between yesterday and today .
__label__0	“ If I am not mistaken , we have accomplished nearly half of our journey in ten days ; but , at the rate at which we are going , it would take months to end it ; and that is all the more vexatious , that we are threatened with a lack of water. ” “ But we ’ ll find some , ” said <NAME> .
__label__1	You might think me better employed in enrolling myself a member of your Society. ’ ‘ Ay , indeed , sir ! ’ retorted <NAME> , shaking his head in a threatening manner .
__label__1	He ’ d open his eyes , that boy would , if he knew how empty of learning _my_ young maw was , at his time of life. ’ Which , by the by , he probably did know , for he had heard of it often enough .
__label__0	<NAME> had been clever enough to bring down several brace of <NAME> , small green and yellow birds , which are excellent eating , and greatly in demand in the <NAME> market .
__label__1	I have my faults , sir , ’ said Mr Chuckster -- ‘ <NAME> , no , ’ interposed Mr Swiveller .
__label__1	This eminent gentleman and Mr Merdle , seated diverse ways and with ruminating aspects on a yellow ottoman in the light of the fire , holding no verbal communication with each other , bore a strong general resemblance to the two cows in the <NAME> picture over against them .
__label__0	<NAME> had sent for a sail , and had it passed under the vessel in such a manner that the pressure of the water forcing it into the leak in a measure stopped it up .
__label__0	He knew that above this seam lay the <NAME> of <NAME> , that there extended <NAME> and <NAME> .
__label__1	I congratulated her ( as she addressed herself to me ) upon this fortunate addition to her income and wished her a long continuance of it .
__label__0	answered <NAME> ; `` for we know now that its initial velocity was greater than they supposed . ''
__label__0	In less than half an hour , by an easy winding path , <NAME> and his party reached the crest of the crouching lion , which , seen from the west , <NAME> ’ s Seat so much resembles .
__label__0	The census of 1819 -- one of the strictest hitherto instituted -- gives the number of the colonists at 25,425 ; this return , it must be understood , does not take in the soldiers .
__label__0	I should not feel safe with you , especially as I share your cabin .
__label__1	And it was particularly kind of him to come , for he had but just gone. ’ ‘ Have you settled , ’ asked <NAME> , appealing to them both , ‘ what is to be done for <NAME> and her brother ? ’ ‘ Why really , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ I am in great perplexity .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> is only a baronet , but there is no mightier baronet than he .
__label__1	“ Yes. ” “ You know he is <NAME> 's man of business and solicitor , and has her confidence when nobody else has ? ” This was bringing me ( I felt ) towards dangerous ground .
__label__1	I call Mr Nickleby to witness the course I intend to pursue with you. ’ ‘ Pray don ’ t call me to witness anything , ma ’ am , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	When the high temperature of the oven had reduced it to a liquid , or rather a pasty state , <NAME> collected with the tube a quantity of the paste : he turned it about on a metal plate , previously arranged , so as to give it a form suitable for blowing , then he passed the tube to <NAME> , telling him to blow at the other extremity .
__label__1	For anything I know , he was eating something to keep the raw morning air out ; but he made motions with his mouth as if the pear were ripe already , and he were smacking his lips over it .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> was enabled to make some curious observations upon the savage inhabitants of those desolate regions .
__label__0	Hundreds of meteorites , ignited by the friction of the atmosphere , irradiated the shadow of the luminous train , and lined the cloudy parts of the disc with their fire .
__label__0	All these detached masses , covered with enamel , polished by the action of the subterraneous fires , shone resplendent by the light of our electric lantern .
__label__1	“ I ’ ll kick his brains out , if he has any -- , or fracture his skull if he hasn ’ t. ” Exerting all his strength , at this moment , my uncle wrenched the ill-looking man ’ s sword from his grasp , and flung it clean out of the coach window , upon which the younger gentleman vociferated , “ Death and lightning ! ” again , and laid his hand upon the hilt of his sword , in a very fierce manner , but didn ’ t draw it .
__label__0	A cry was heard , uttered by the sailing-master , whose arm could be seen wildly waving amid the whiteness of the foam .
__label__1	If ever my darling were fonder of me at one time than another in all our intercourse , she was surely fondest of me that night .
__label__1	In case you should think better at any time , however distant -- THAT 'S no consequence , for my feelings can never alter -- of anything I have said , particularly what might I not do , <NAME> , eighty-seven , <NAME> , or if removed , or dead ( of blighted hopes or anything of that sort ) , care of Mrs. Guppy , three hundred and two , <NAME> , will be sufficient . ''
__label__1	There were occasions , however , when Mr Boffin , seeking a brief refuge from the blandishments of fashion , would present himself at the Bower after dark , to anticipate the next sallying forth of <NAME> , and would there , on the old settle , pursue the downward fortunes of those enervated and corrupted masters of the world who were by this time on their last legs .
__label__1	I was delighted that he should know it ; I was delighted that he should feel keenly , and I hoped he did .
__label__0	But if he could in no respect reckon on chance , was it impossible to proceed by reasoning ?
__label__1	‘ Don ’ t say so. ’ ‘ It is only a pincushion for the toilette table , <NAME> , ’ resumed his sister ; ‘ one of those trifles which are insignificant to your sex in general , as it ’ s very natural they should be -- we have no business to expect they should be otherwise -- but to which we attach some interest. ’ ‘ Miss Tox is very good , ’ said Mr Dombey .
__label__0	“ My dear doctor , ” said <NAME> , “ if we continue to produce such a sensation as this , we shall find some difficulty in establishing commercial relations with the people hereabouts. ” “ There ’ s one kind of trade that we might carry on , though , easily enough , ” said <NAME> ; “ and that would be to go down there quietly , and walk off with the best of the goods , without troubling our heads about the merchants ; we ’ d get rich that way ! ” “ Ah ! ” said the doctor , “ these natives are a little scared at first ; but they won ’ t be long in coming back , either through suspicion or through curiosity. ” “ Do you really think so , doctor ? ” “ Well , we ’ ll see pretty soon .
__label__0	Fortunately for the sake of peace , <NAME> , who at length was beginning to realize something of the true condition of things , came forward at this moment , and in a voice trembling with eagerness , implored the professor to tell him when they would all be back again upon the earth .
__label__1	Among the company at breakfast was a mild old gentleman , who had been for many years employed by the <NAME> Government in conducting negotiations with the <NAME> , and who had just concluded a treaty with these people by which they bound themselves , in consideration of a certain annual sum , to remove next year to some land provided for them , west of the <NAME> , and a little way beyond <NAME> .
__label__1	He bowed , as if in compliance ; but turning back , when he had nearly reached the door , said : ‘ I am forgiven , and have explained my fault .
__label__1	The worst has happened ; and the <NAME> has fallen , never to be built up any more. ’ ‘ And Mr Dombey , is he personally ruined ? ’ ‘ Ruined. ’ ‘ Will he have no private fortune left ?
__label__1	Of morning , noon , and sunset ; night , and the rising of an early moon .
__label__1	I am sure you can tell me something connected with the coming here of this man , if you will. ’ ‘ Why , then I ’ ll tell you , <NAME> , ’ returned <NAME> -- ‘ <NAME> ’ s coming ! ’ ‘ <NAME> , indeed he is not .
__label__1	It would be such a hard surprise. ’ ‘ I don ’ t see it at all , ’ blustered <NAME> .
__label__1	Let this be a warning to all young ladies to be particular in the character of the gentlemen of their choice .
__label__0	The cart might then be driven there , and towards the end of December they tried the onagas for the first time .
__label__0	The further he penetrated into the strait which separates <NAME> from the continent , the more the depth diminished .
__label__0	But see , the curtain is going to rise. ” Alcide <NAME> spoke as if he had been at the <NAME> , and taking his glass from its case , he prepared , with the air of a connoisseur , “ to examine the first act of <NAME> ’ s company. ” A painful ceremony was to precede the sports .
__label__0	Scarcely had the last vessels of the squadron filed through the strait , than a series of heavy gales , squalls , and storms , caused the oldest sailors to vow that all they had hitherto known of tempests were nothing in comparison .
__label__1	<NAME> up , if you please , <NAME> Weller. ’ ‘ I mean to speak up , <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> ; ‘ I am in the service o ’ that ‘ ere gen ’ l ’ man , and a wery good service it is. ’ ‘ Little to do , and plenty to get , I suppose ? ’ said <NAME> , with jocularity .
__label__0	In a few days the hull of a ship of several hundred tons would disappear entirely in there ! ''
__label__1	Having relieved her mind of these disclosures , she partook of shrimps and porter , and evinced a disposition to swear eternal friendship .
__label__1	When they came to the warm-baths , all the other people belonging to that establishment were looking out for them at the door , and running up and down the passages .
__label__1	The law had been her nurse .
__label__0	Just see them swimming between two waves , quietly , making no jumps .
__label__0	“ Every Englishman is an enemy .
__label__1	So hurrah for the <NAME> , <NAME> !
__label__0	No , it did not seem to him possible that such a man had ended in this vulgar fashion , carried away by a wave , drowned in the floods , a few hundred feet from a shore .
__label__1	And she may have the pain of knowing that he does so . '
__label__1	`` I goes out to work , sir , '' returns <NAME> .
__label__0	`` Yes , <NAME> , '' replied the captain .
__label__1	He is the greatest tyrant that every lived , she daren ’ t call her soul her own , he makes her tremble with a word and even with a look , he frightens her to death , and she hasn ’ t the spirit to give him a word back , no , not a single word. ’ Notwithstanding that the fact had been notorious beforehand to all the tea-drinkers , and had been discussed and expatiated on at every tea-drinking in the neighbourhood for the last twelve months , this official communication was no sooner made than they all began to talk at once and to vie with each other in vehemence and volubility .
__label__0	But their corn was now entirely exhausted , and though they tried successively at <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> for further supplies , it was all in vain , these miserable little towns not being able to furnish more than enough for their own consumption .
__label__1	‘ Here is a gentleman in <NAME> ’ s apartment , whom he wishes to have the pleasure of presenting to you , my love ! ’ <NAME> immediately reappeared , and shook hands with me again .
__label__1	Now , it is incumbent upon all people in an exalted position , but it is particularly so on this family , for reasons which I -- ha -- will not dwell upon , to make themselves respected .
__label__0	Here are to be found the formidable ruffians who in a civilized country were the terror of their government .
__label__1	Thank you for reminding me .
__label__0	Nor did he , but , putting his horse into a steady gallop , he took the road towards the left bank of the <NAME> , which was still forty versts distant .
__label__1	‘ Here , you Smike ; take away now .
__label__1	I see little to choose , between assistant to a brutal pedagogue , and toad-eater to a mean and ignorant upstart , be he member or no member. ’ ‘ I hardly know whether I should tell you what I heard this morning , or not , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	I forgot Mr Pancks last time .
__label__0	THREE years after the events which have just been related , the guide-books recommended as a “ great attraction , ” to the numerous tourists who roam over the county of <NAME> , a visit of a few hours to the mines of <NAME> .
__label__1	Our residence at <NAME> , and our local connexion , will , no doubt , enable him to take advantage of any vacancy that may arise in the <NAME> corps. ’ On looking at <NAME> Micawber again , I saw that he had a certain expression of face , as if his voice were behind his eyebrows ; where it presently appeared to be , on his singing us ( as an alternative between that and bed ) ‘ The Wood-Pecker tapping ’ .
__label__0	She could not do less than give 1,372,640 piastres ; and she gave them with an eagerness which denoted , however , some pressure on the part of the government .
__label__0	It was one worthy in every way of its recipients , worthy of the <NAME> , worthy of the <NAME> , and , best of all , every man , woman , and child in the <NAME> could take part in it .
__label__1	He had been crouching for a spring at the moment when his master caught him .
__label__1	‘ “ Damn you , ” said I , starting up , and rushing upon him ; “ I killed her .
__label__0	“ My friends , ” said <NAME> , “ perhaps this vessel only wishes to survey the coast of the island .
__label__1	‘ I have a long series of insults to avenge , ’ said <NAME> , flushed with passion ; ‘ and my indignation is aggravated by the dastardly cruelties practised on helpless infancy in this foul den .
__label__1	She felt it with a mother 's anguish to be a move in the <NAME> direction , well knowing that <NAME> had that general impression of an aptitude for any art to which smoke and a tall chimney might be considered essential .
__label__0	On a sign from the engineer , <NAME> and <NAME> examined the bodies , already stiffened by the cold .
__label__1	If you haven ’ t got the one thing , why have you got the other ?
__label__1	Probably it is through Provis that you have received the explanation of <NAME> -- in <NAME> ? ” “ It came through <NAME> , ” I replied .
__label__1	He looked at him , as he passed through the hall and up the staircase , going to dinner , with a glazed fixedness that Mr <NAME> did not like .
__label__1	I have not the honour of Mrs <NAME> ’ s good opinion .
__label__1	<NAME> as my inward hurry was , and wonderful the force of the pictures that rushed by me instead of thoughts , I could yet clearly understand that , unless he had resolved that I was within a few moments of surely perishing out of all human knowledge , he would never have told me what he had told .
__label__0	`` <NAME> , '' said the Professor , `` I do believe that the situation is to a certain extent desperate .
__label__1	As he stepped back , preparatory to saying he had no more to ask , he could not but observe how gloomily and fixedly she sat with her eyes fastened on the ground , and a certain air upon her of resolute waiting ; also , how exactly the self-same expression was reflected in Mr Flintwinch , standing at a little distance from her chair , with his eyes also on the ground , and his right hand softly rubbing his chin .
__label__0	The exhausted mine was like the body of a huge fantastically-shaped mastodon , from which all the organs of life have been taken , and only the skeleton remains .
__label__0	After having crossed the tropic of <NAME> in 135° longitude , it sailed W.N.W. , making again for the tropical zone .
__label__1	Perhaps some momentary recollection of the story of the <NAME> may have been in her mind .
__label__0	And all rushed down the bank again .
__label__1	From that time , the old man never , for a moment , forgot the weakness and devotion of the child ; from the time of that slight incident , he who had seen her toiling by his side through so much difficulty and suffering , and had scarcely thought of her otherwise than as the partner of miseries which he felt severely in his own person , and deplored for his own sake at least as much as hers , awoke to a sense of what he owed her , and what those miseries had made her .
__label__1	I pointed out to my darling how this could scarcely be , because <NAME> had come to her cousin <NAME> 's house and had known us all there , and because he had always liked <NAME> , and <NAME> had always liked him , and -- and so forth .
__label__1	I walked along the path towards the house , glancing at the windows , and fearing at every step to see <NAME> or <NAME> lowering out of one of them .
__label__1	‘ I ’ d come back to see you , after I was let out. ’ ‘ Give me the money again , ’ said the other , eagerly , ‘ and I ’ ll keep it , and never spend it .
__label__0	But the travellers determined to aid them when it was necessary , and they intended to proceed by easy stages ; the distance from <NAME> Bay to the Pole was three hundred and fifty-five miles at the outside , and going twelve miles a day they could make the journey in a month .
__label__1	Who calls so loud ? ’ ‘ “ Who calls so loud ? ” ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	There , there ! ’ To see the <NAME> lift her on the sofa , and cover her with his coat , would have been worth a hundred state sights .
__label__0	`` As for you , <NAME> , I know your worth -- '' `` Well , you know then a great deal more than I do , '' answered the doctor , quickly .
__label__0	Again the boy remained silent .
__label__1	Fifty-seven churches to be erected with half-crowns , forty-two parsonage houses to be repaired with shillings , seven-and-twenty organs to be built with halfpence , twelve hundred children to be brought up on postage stamps .
__label__1	<NAME> , not being skilful in such matters , only fanned the flame in attempting to extinguish it .
__label__0	The sailors were all so eager to join the expedition that <NAME> found the only way to prevent jealousy among them was to draw lots who should go .
__label__0	Could they go over the one hundred and twenty miles which lay between them and <NAME> ?
__label__1	But even if there was nothing else in it to be sorry for and ashamed of , it is such a bad return to you -- ’ ‘ Hush ! ’ said <NAME> , smiling and touching her lips with his hand .
__label__1	‘ I suppose , ’ he added , turning to <NAME> , ‘ he ’ ll say next , that my story about the queer client we had , when I was in an attorney ’ s office , is not true either -- I shouldn ’ t wonder. ’ ‘ I shan ’ t venture to say anything at all about it , seeing that I never heard the story , ’ observed the owner of the <NAME> decorations .
__label__1	Advancing to the door of the mysterious apartment , they were not a little surprised to hear a human voice , chanting with a highly elaborated expression of melancholy , and in tones of suffocation which a human voice might have produced from under five or six feather-beds of the best quality , the once popular air of ‘ Has she then failed in her truth , the beautiful maid I adore ? ’ Nor , on bursting into the room without demanding a parley , was their astonishment lessened by the discovery that these romantic sounds certainly proceeded from the throat of some man up the chimney , of whom nothing was visible but a pair of legs , which were dangling above the grate ; apparently feeling , with extreme anxiety , for the top bar whereon to effect a landing .
__label__1	‘ I assure you , my dear , ’ said Mr Boffin , ‘ that on the celebrated day when I made what has since been agreed upon to be my grandest demonstration -- I allude to <NAME> says the cat , <NAME> quack says the duck , and Bow-wow-wow says the dog -- I assure you , my dear , that on that celebrated day , them flinty and unbelieving words hit my old lady so hard on my account , that I had to hold her , to prevent her running out after you , and defending me by saying I was playing a part. ’ Mrs <NAME> laughed heartily again , and her eyes glistened again , and it then appeared , not only that in that burst of sarcastic eloquence Mr <NAME> was considered by his two fellow-conspirators to have outdone himself , but that in his own opinion it was a remarkable achievement .
__label__1	They are not at home .
__label__0	The men had the provisions given them freely , and the spirits too , and you can easily imagine the abuse they made of them after their long abstinence .
__label__0	And when may we expect the operation to come off ? ” “ In a month , <NAME> , ” replied <NAME> .
__label__1	My brother <NAME> , ’ said the old man admiringly , ‘ is fit company for monarchs ; but not so your uncle , my dear .
__label__1	I am glad to recollect that when the carrier began to move , my mother ran out at the gate , and called to him to stop , that she might kiss me once more .
__label__1	Yet what did <NAME> expect ?
__label__0	At last , these words escaped his lips : `` Boiling water ! ''
__label__0	“ They may adopt other sentiments ! ” said <NAME> , “ and perhaps repent. ” “ They repent ! ” exclaimed the sailor , shrugging his shoulders .
__label__1	Could it be , she asked herself with starting tears , that her own dear mother had been made unhappy by such treatment , and had pined away and died ?
__label__1	She looked from him to <NAME> , and her features softened .
__label__0	He resolved to send a fleet to explore them , for <NAME> had enough to do in <NAME> to restrain the trembling <NAME> , and the <NAME> -- Moors as they were then called -- who were always ready to shake off the yoke .
__label__1	I urged upon him the necessity of its being dug up , and the paper being legally produced and established .
__label__1	There was a beautiful propriety in that .
__label__1	Very thoughtful of you ! ’ Mrs. Sparsit ’ s <NAME> nose underwent a slight expansion of the nostrils , and her black eyebrows contracted as she took a sip of tea .
__label__1	‘ I ’ ll try , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ if you ’ ll help me away .
__label__1	I have always read something of her poor mother ’ s story , in her character ; and so I tell it you tonight , when we three are again together , after such great changes .
__label__1	It is <NAME> 's habit -- it is the head and front of his pretensions indeed -- to keep this sort of debtor and creditor account in the smallest items and to post it publicly on the most trivial occasions .
__label__1	`` Not much of that , sir , though that HAS happened .
__label__1	I ha ’ read i ’ th ’ papers that great folk ( fair faw ’ em a ’ !
__label__1	an honest man , ’ replied <NAME> ; ‘ honest in ought but ever putting legs under seame table wi ’ such as thou. ’ ‘ Scandal ! ’ said <NAME> , exultingly .
__label__0	Having been set fire to by each party that had successively been victorious , <NAME> was nothing more than a heap of ruins , amongst which loitered a little remnant of scantily clothed inhabitants , the wretched residuum of a once flourishing population .
__label__0	“ And where ’ s the fire ? ” asked <NAME> .
__label__0	let us save it , <NAME> ! ” “ It is the history of a Frenchwoman whose sorrows rendered these banks memorable in the eighteenth century. ” “ We are listening , ” said <NAME> .
__label__0	Besides , the men always slept with one eye open .
__label__0	When , therefore , <NAME> was about to press his inquiries in a more categorical form , <NAME> , thinking it advisable not prematurely to press the little _savant_ too far , interrupted him by asking the professor how he accounted for the earth having suffered so little from such a formidable concussion .
__label__0	`` And I reply again , '' answered <NAME> .
__label__0	Yes ; four meals a day. ” “ Hurrah ! ” shouted the soldiers , unable this time to keep their delight within the bounds of military decorum ; and , turning to the right-about , they marched away , leaving the officers to renew the all-absorbing game .
__label__0	On the 18th November the corvette left <NAME> , and after touching at the <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , arrived on the 25th March , 1829 , at <NAME> , exactly thirty-five months after her departure from that port .
__label__1	My Lady merely waves her off with indifference , saying , `` There , there , child !
__label__1	`` I have suspected it a long while -- fully known it a little while . ''
__label__0	<NAME> was chosen , and was much satisfied with the welcome that he received .
__label__0	I undo the bolts , and the little boat goes up to the surface of the sea with prodigious rapidity .
__label__1	After a few Wednesdays , <NAME> himself made some inquiries of me about him , and I told him all my aunt had told me ; which interested the Doctor so much that he requested , on the occasion of his next visit , to be presented to him .
__label__0	<NAME> , with the exception of the captain , the crew of the <NAME> was complete .
__label__0	`` I came to ask you , sir , '' replied <NAME> .
__label__0	The <NAME> was brought in and covered up carefully ; the four Englishmen sat about the fire .
__label__0	It was , of course , too early at this period for the critics to pass a decided opinion on the nature of the information furnished by our travellers .
__label__0	`` Besides , '' as <NAME> observed , `` a plain is a more suitable landing place than a mountain .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> , <NAME> , what you 've trusted to me I 'll go through with .
__label__0	The grand duchesses , covered with diamonds , the ladies-in-waiting in their most exquisite costumes , set the example to the wives of the military and civil dignitaries of the ancient “ city of white stone. ” When , therefore , the signal for the “ polonaise ” resounded through the saloons , and the guests of all ranks took part in that measured promenade , which on occasions of this kind has all the importance of a national dance , the mingled costumes , the sweeping robes adorned with lace , and uniforms covered with orders , presented a scene of dazzling splendor , lighted by hundreds of lusters multiplied tenfold by the numerous mirrors adorning the walls .
__label__1	He took her mantle from the wall , and tenderly wrapped it round her .
__label__1	I have told you already , so don ’ t fly in the face of Providence by attempting to deny it ! ’ ‘ Hush !
__label__1	“ Lay hands on this stranger if he seeks to lodge in your village to-night , and be sure that his business is honest , Gabelle. ” “ Monseigneur , I am flattered to devote myself to your orders. ” “ Did he run away , fellow ? -- where is that Accursed ? ” The accursed was already under the carriage with some half-dozen particular friends , pointing out the chain with his blue cap .
__label__1	The rippling of the river seemed to cause a correspondent stir in his uneasy reflections .
__label__1	This was a very wise resolution , but he was prevented from putting it in practice by a new source of anxiety and uneasiness .
__label__1	Consternation was in every face .
__label__1	Have you , though ? ’ returned <NAME> , his eyes sparkling with delight .
__label__1	If you were not an ornament to <NAME> , and if I was not a benefactor to <NAME> , you and I would never have come together .
__label__1	You have too much feeling. ’ ‘ We have all our faults , ’ said <NAME> , weeping and shaking her head .
__label__0	These natural accidents naturally excited the imaginations of these terrestrial astronomers .
__label__0	The raft took a sudden turn , whirled round , entered another tunnel -- this time illumined in a most singular manner .
__label__0	The night was beautiful and still , the darkness was not yet deep .
__label__1	‘ It ’ s a dreadful trial to a father ’ s feelin ’ s , that ‘ ere , <NAME> -- ’ ‘ Nonsense , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	He therefore counselled his companions to have their eyes wide open for every thing and at all hours .
__label__1	Constable , my good fellow , we had better be going. ’ ‘ What ! ’ shrieked <NAME> .
__label__1	“ And you have reared the boy , with the intention of taking him for your apprentice ; is that so , <NAME> ? ” “ You know , <NAME> , ” replied <NAME> , “ as you and me were ever friends , and it were looked for'ard to betwixt us , as being calc'lated to lead to larks .
__label__1	I should have done it before now , if I hadn ’ t been afraid of making bad worse .
__label__1	‘ It ’ s almost enough to make us get married after all , isn ’ t it ? ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	But if you will allow me -- I have been thinking -- in place of stopping at <NAME> , I will go on to <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> and his companions , under the guidance of the <NAME> , had some difficulty in reaching the palace , where the king , who in the narrative is called the `` <NAME> , '' was awaiting them with extreme impatience .
__label__0	Where did this sea end -- to what did it lead ?
__label__1	Having described the precise situation of the office , and accompanied it with copious directions how he was to walk straight up the passage , and when he got into the side , and pull off his hat as he went into the room , <NAME> bade him hurry on alone , and promised to bide his return on the spot of their parting .
__label__1	Well then , I will say no more about it .
__label__1	It was not a month , since this same body had sat calmly by , and heard a man , one of themselves , with oaths which beggars in their drink reject , threaten to cut another ’ s throat from ear to ear .
__label__0	They have been observed in all the level portion of the <NAME> 's surface .
__label__1	‘ But I ’ m not goin t ’ night , <NAME> , nor yet t ’ morrow .
__label__0	There was another silence of nearly a quarter of an hour .
__label__1	'Which contained -- ' interposed Monks , stretching forward .
__label__0	“ That indeed he is. ” “ Do you know something , my Lord ? ” “ What is it , and then I will tell you ? ” “ That all the people you have with you are brave .
__label__0	He had either to inquire nor to rule ; he had not even to regulate a discussion nor to obtain a verdict , neither to apply the articles of the penal code nor to pronounce a sentence .
__label__0	Had he seen the Projectile before it vanished behind the <NAME> 's north pole ?
__label__0	<NAME> and loud were the lamentations of the Jew .
__label__1	‘ I ’ m astonished at that , <NAME> , you being usually so quick !
__label__1	At any hour later than sunset , and not least at that hour when most of the people who have anything to eat at home are going home to eat it , and when most of those who have nothing have hardly yet slunk out to beg or steal , it was a deserted place and looked on a deserted scene .
__label__1	Would you object to my writing it ? ''
__label__0	The volcanic substances are no longer in a state of ebullition , they have caught fire , and we are undoubtedly menaced by an approaching eruption . ''
__label__0	The professor scowled at him , and was manifestly annoyed at having the insignificant dimensions of his comet pointed out in so disparaging a manner .
__label__0	For twenty days , from January 31st to February 19th , the return was very much like the first part of the journey .
__label__0	From these remarks we gather how invaluable the trustworthy narrative of this disinterested and well-informed traveller would have been .
__label__1	He smoked his pipe as we went along , and sometimes stopped to clap me on the shoulder .
__label__0	Feeling he could not long keep master of himself at this unexpected meeting , he covered his eyes with his hands and walked quickly away .
__label__0	Their heads were covered with palm-leaf hats , they wore beards , and their hair descended to their waists .
__label__1	Now do they note down , in the watches of the night , how the neighbourhood of <NAME> was yesterday , at about midnight , thrown into a state of the most intense agitation and excitement by the following alarming and horrible discovery .
__label__0	I followed it with my eye ; saw it lose itself in the vastness of the <NAME> , and felt myself drawn with it , when <NAME> and <NAME> appeared at the door of the saloon .
__label__0	It is the very same , ” repeated the doctor , exultingly .
__label__0	“ At his age it is quite natural , ” replied <NAME> .
__label__1	' I 'm <NAME> , ' said the charity-boy , 'and you 're under me .
__label__0	“ <NAME> to the shore , <NAME> ! ” said <NAME> .
__label__0	It is a short time after his return to <NAME> that he falls into disgrace with his royal mistress , and after his release from prison , while he is confined to his princely mansion of <NAME> , he conceives the project of his voyage to <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> made his best bow , and stepped into the presence of a lady and gentleman seated at breakfast .
__label__0	To that there was no possible answer .
__label__1	‘ This man alarming you again !
__label__1	He was not so honest , he was not so manly , he was not so good-humoured ; he substituted cunning for their simplicity , and passion for their safe solid sense .
__label__1	Mrs. <NAME> shook her head mournfully , as if deploring the mental blindness of those paupers who did not know it ; and thrusting a silver spoon ( private property ) into the inmost recesses of a two-ounce tin tea-caddy , proceeded to make the tea .
__label__0	The captain had double rations served out to all hands , and well they merited this extra supply of spirits ; they had indeed worked hard during the week .
__label__1	Please to carve , <NAME> , for I can ’ t. ’ This sally ushers in the dinner .
__label__1	When he has done so , he looks out again at the falling sleet and snow and listens again for the returning steps .
__label__1	My dear Trot ! ’ cried my aunt , in a terrified whisper , and pressing my arm .
__label__1	When this expression was upon him , he looked as if he were old ; but when it was stirred and broken up -- as it was now , in a moment , on his speaking to his daughter -- he became a handsome man , not past the prime of life .
__label__1	He smiled as the mother retired down stairs ; but his face fell , as the daughter followed .
__label__0	While these interesting birds were cooking , <NAME> prepared the fruit of the bread-tree .
__label__1	She went up to the house , keeping within the shrubbery , and went round it , peeping between the leaves at the lower windows .
__label__0	The fugitives lay flat on the platform , so that the raft was scarcely above the level of the water .
__label__1	he asks , good-humouredly making light of what he has done as she gets up and curtsys .
__label__1	There was a guard in the hut , and they challenged , and the sergeant answered .
__label__0	They formed an insuperable barrier , recalling , but with more wildness , the fiords of <NAME> .
__label__1	I have been called picturesque myself .
__label__1	‘ Why , no , <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> ; ‘ as I dined in the coffee-room , and shall go to bed soon , it is hardly worth while .
__label__0	`` Still , <NAME> , '' said the young sailor , `` I can tell you that there 's some one on board , some one who was spoken of in the letter in which <NAME> was offered the place of mate . ''
__label__1	I tell you when it has come to this , I will tell it with my own lips , and will express myself throughout it .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> gave him good day .
__label__1	Those are the lights of <NAME> . '
__label__1	In a short restless interval of sensibility , or partial sensibility , I made out that he asked for you to be brought to sit by him .
__label__1	I have heard that Mrs. <NAME> was understood to suffer great mortification from her daughter 's ignoble marriage and pursuits , but I hope she got over it in time .
__label__1	Here , the <NAME> ’ s <NAME> trained scarlet beans , kept fowls and rabbits , erected rotten summer-houses ( one was an old boat ) , dried clothes , and smoked pipes .
__label__0	`` Come , a good long day , your Honor !
__label__0	What a splendid thing it is !
__label__0	The ship was now quite motionless .
__label__1	The <NAME> trembled to think that <NAME> was not to be got rid of , and had been brought back in a coach .
__label__1	Among the echoes then , there would arise the sound of footsteps at her own early grave ; and thoughts of the husband who would be left so desolate , and who would mourn for her so much , swelled to her eyes , and broke like waves .
__label__0	`` Nothing easier , '' said I , pulling out my notebook and pencil .
__label__0	`` Well , my friends , '' said <NAME> , `` do you want to hear my opinion ? ''
__label__0	`` Well , <NAME> , '' said the captain , `` do you recognize this place ? ''
__label__0	; but a dense fog , lasting no less than twelve hours , continued rain , and cold , which was severe and trying to lightly-clad men , made any approach nearer than six or seven leagues impossible .
__label__1	Transportation or the gallows for anybody who shall touch the property ! ''
__label__1	She courted <NAME> , though <NAME> never responded ; listened , day after day , to the guitar , though I am afraid she had no taste for music ; never attacked the <NAME> , though the temptation must have been severe ; went wonderful distances on foot to purchase , as surprises , any trifles that she found out <NAME> wanted ; and never came in by the garden , and missed her from the room , but she would call out , at the foot of the stairs , in a voice that sounded cheerfully all over the house : ‘ Where ’ s <NAME> ? ’ It was some time now , since I had left the Doctor .
__label__0	cried <NAME> ; `` but the hand ca n't support that heat ! ''
__label__0	The doctor made a sign to the old boatswain to keep silent .
__label__1	What is your name ? ’ A question more decidedly rushing at the secret he was keeping from her , could not have astounded him .
__label__1	I am far from feeling convinced now , however differently I might have felt only this time yesterday , that I am fit for the trust you repose in me ; that I know how to respond to the appeal you have come home to make to me ; that I have the right instinct—supposing it for the moment to be some quality of that nature—how to help you , and to set you right , my child. ’ She had turned upon her pillow , and lay with her face upon her arm , so that he could not see it .
__label__1	‘ Please to be seated , sir , ’ said Mrs. Sparsit .
__label__1	I alluded to the advantages I had derived in my first rawness and ignorance from his society , and I confessed that I feared I had but ill repaid them , and that he might have done better without me and my expectations .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> died point blank at him ; and when the two guards came in to take the body off after a very hard death , it was seen to open its eyes and glance at the <NAME> manager .
__label__1	<NAME> ’ t tell me that that handsome child has been in the habit of prowling about as she ’ s done these last two or three days .
__label__0	His attitude was threatening , his countenance ferocious .
__label__0	The reason of such considerable retardation was , that by this time the Projectile had reached such a great distance from the Earth that it had hardly any weight .
__label__1	We may have detained her longer than she expected already . '
__label__1	Though not before he had whispered something , on the door-mat , to the footman , in which there was the phrase ‘ old-fashioned ’ -- for <NAME> heard it .
__label__1	‘ It ’ s of not a bit of use , ’ said <NAME> , shaking her head , until the ear-rings rang again .
__label__1	For what says the <NAME> ?
__label__0	He would have been thrown to the beasts .
__label__0	It had made itself master of <NAME> , and subjected that territory to the laws of the <NAME> , after imprisoning <NAME> on a charge of rebellion and polygamy .
__label__1	Now , <NAME> , try once more , and don ’ t be stupid. ’ I obey the first clause of the injunction by trying once more , but am not so successful with the second , for I am very stupid .
__label__0	<NAME> ’ t you see ? ” “ No. ” “ It was a monkey , a sapajou , an orangoutang , a baboon , a gorilla , a sagoin .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> usually improved these occasions by remarking , when she was gone , that if <NAME> had been properly trained from an early age she would have remonstrated to herself on sound principles the baselessness of these fantastic hopes .
__label__0	Two yards only separated us from the open sea .
__label__0	How could they then prevent the pirates from landing ?
__label__1	‘ But I dare say I could scribble something now and then , that would suit you. ’ ‘ We ’ ll have a new show-piece out directly , ’ said the manager .
__label__1	Here , take hold of my hand , <NAME> .
__label__1	Jingling and clattering , till distance rendered its noise inaudible , and its rapid progress only perceptible to the eye , the vehicle wound its way along the road , almost hidden in a cloud of dust : now wholly disappearing , and now becoming visible again , as intervening objects , or the intricacies of the way , permitted .
__label__0	We have seen what an important geographical discovery rewarded the perseverance of the explorers who had completed the examination of the whole of the district north of the <NAME> , between <NAME> and the mountains of <NAME> Guiana .
__label__1	The <NAME> being very cold , he set off for a brisk trot after service ; the trot to end in a charge at his favourite fragment of ruin , which was to be carried by storm , without a pause for breath .
__label__1	It is strange enough too , to see an honourable gentleman leaning back in his tilted chair with his legs on the desk before him , shaping a convenient ‘ plug ’ with his penknife , and when it is quite ready for use , shooting the old one from his mouth , as from a pop-gun , and clapping the new one in its place .
__label__0	They thus visited all the left bank of the <NAME> , along which ran the road from the corral to the mouth of <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ That ’ s cheering ! ’ ‘ I have only one difficulty , aunt. ’ ‘ Say what it is , <NAME> , ’ she returned .
__label__1	I would pretend to know -- if I didn ’ t , but I should from her son -- all about her age .
__label__1	Everybody else said the same , and they must be allowed to have been competent judges , because they had just had dinner ; and , with the dessert upon the table , were clustered round the fire , by lamplight .
__label__0	They had to tear the strong silk away piece by piece , and then cut it in narrow strips so as to extricate it from the meshes of the network .
__label__0	He offered to arrange for me an excursion to the depths of the thick forests , which clothed the volcano up to the middle of the central cove .
__label__0	“ If you would like to accompany us there , <NAME> , you will be hospitably received. ” “ I do not know that I can , ” said <NAME> , who , surprised by this unexpected meeting , hesitated to make a start .
__label__0	These last words justified the colonists ’ presentiment .
__label__0	He was careful , however , to make it understood that with respect to the original cause of the disruption he had no theory to offer ; and although he knew what expansion might be the result of subterranean forces , he did not venture to say that he considered it sufficient to produce so tremendous an effect .
__label__0	<NAME> , his eyes fixed on the ground , still looked for his box .
__label__1	<NAME> clasped his hands , and sank feebly backward .
__label__1	By degrees he fell to reposing such great confidence in me , as to ask my advice in reference to his own affairs .
__label__1	As the sisters reached the porch , he quickened his pace , and called upon them to stop .
__label__1	Mrs Alfred <NAME> faced her lord .
__label__0	The whole country groaned under the yoke of the <NAME> , who were descendants of the commander of the <NAME> , and paid only a small annual tribute to <NAME> , which , however , was sufficient to serve as a pretext for oppressing the unfortunate fellaheen .
__label__0	His third son , <NAME> , after having been in the service of King Emmanuel , when the latter was only <NAME> de <NAME> had felt himself attracted while still young to the enterprises of discovery which had rendered his father illustrious .
__label__1	‘ There ’ s a letter been waiting here for you four days ; you hadn ’ t gone away , half an hour , when it came ; and more than that , it ’ s got “ immediate , ” on the outside. ’ ‘ Vere is it , my love ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
__label__1	A second and a third bowl were ordered in ; and when <NAME> awoke next morning , there was not a symptom of rheumatism about him ; which proves , as <NAME> very justly observed , that there is nothing like hot punch in such cases ; and that if ever hot punch did fail to act as a preventive , it was merely because the patient fell into the vulgar error of not taking enough of it .
__label__1	‘ Remember my words , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ and be thankful that <NAME> is not too fond of you .
__label__1	‘ To complain of you , ’ returned brother <NAME> , ‘ to poison our ears with calumnies and falsehoods ; but he came on a fruitless errand , and went away with some wholesome truths in his ear besides .
__label__1	I ’ ve never met with nothing but beer ath ’ ll ever clean a comic blackamoor. ’ <NAME> rapidly assented ; <NAME> rapidly turned out from a box , a smock frock , a felt hat , and other essentials ; the whelp rapidly changed clothes behind a screen of baize ; <NAME> rapidly brought beer , and washed him white again .
__label__0	No incident occurred during the cruise , and the two vessels cast anchor in <NAME> <NAME> .
__label__1	I wish <NAME> was not so arbitrary , I wish it was not so exacting -- Bird , be quiet ! ’ The parrot had given a most piercing shriek , as if its name were <NAME> and it asserted its right to its exactions .
__label__0	<NAME> , seizing the telescope , rapidly swept the horizon , and stopping on the indicated point , that is to say , on that which had made the almost imperceptible spot on the photographic negative -- `` I 'm blessed but it is really a vessel ! ''
__label__1	<NAME> do n't , father , '' urged his son .
__label__1	The women , all in one large room , were employed in making light clothing , for <NAME> and the <NAME> .
__label__0	A thick black smoke was pouring from her two funnels .
__label__1	I would not shame you by seeming to take them to heart , or treat them earnestly for an instant .
__label__1	<NAME> , out of date , withdrawing from attention , able to afford it .
__label__0	Another minute and the boat was ready .
__label__1	<NAME> 's business was the swindling , handwriting forging , stolen bank-note passing , and such-like .
__label__1	In his better days , before he had become enfeebled by dissipation and emaciated by disease , he had been in the receipt of a good salary , which , if he had been careful and prudent , he might have continued to receive for some years -- not many ; because these men either die early , or by unnaturally taxing their bodily energies , lose , prematurely , those physical powers on which alone they can depend for subsistence .
__label__1	Within the shadow , I may figuratively say , of that religious edifice immortalized by <NAME> , which was anciently the resort of <NAME> from the remotest corners of -- in short , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ in the immediate neighbourhood of the Cathedral. ’ I replied that it was .
__label__0	Between them were canals , iguarapes , lagoons , temporary lakes , an inextricable network which renders the hydrography of this country so difficult .
__label__0	I repeat that every sign of mutiny had disappeared .
__label__1	‘ I am self-contained and self-reliant ; your opinion is nothing to me ; I have no interest in you , care nothing for you , and see and hear you with indifference ’ -- this it said plainly .
__label__0	“ Poor orphans , ” said <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ What the devil ’ s the matter ? ’ groaned <NAME> , sitting upright on the couch .
__label__0	This caused a double error , that of identifying <NAME> with <NAME> ' <NAME> , and of denying the existence of the latter , which is in reality <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ You had better refresh your memory , sir , ’ said <NAME> , with a threatening look .
__label__1	“ A perfect fleet , ” said he .
__label__0	A quarter of an hour after , <NAME> said to <NAME> , -- `` 'The barometer ? '
__label__1	‘ This is a good beginning , ’ he said bitterly .
__label__0	The “ Bonadventure ” was then going at a very moderate rate , as the breeze , partly intercepted by the high land , scarcely swelled her sails , and the sea , smooth as glass , was only rippled now and then by passing gusts .
__label__1	Says you -- what name is it ? ’ ‘ Her name ? ’ ‘ Ah ! ’ said <NAME> , with a nod of his head .
__label__0	Commissary Passauf flung himself into the antechamber .
__label__0	President <NAME> , however , less sensitive to these wonders , was in haste to press forward ; the very luxuriance of the country was displeasing to him .
__label__0	`` What giddy spirit has taken possession of my peaceable town of <NAME> ?
__label__1	I didn ’ t mean any harm indeed , upon my word I didn ’ t , ’ cried the small servant , struggling like a much larger one .
__label__1	“ <NAME> , <NAME> , ” said the former ; “ our arrangement thus made , you have nothing to fear from me. ” He sat down in a chair on the hearth , over against <NAME> .
__label__1	Early in the afternoon , <NAME> walked direct from his own house into the country , to be taken up on the line by which he was to travel ; and at night the remaining two set forth upon their different course , encouraged by not seeing any face they knew .
__label__0	We might -- we will try -- but no !
__label__0	I tried to look unconcerned .
__label__0	The natives were not slow in remarking that all the blows which they directed towards those parts of their enemies ' bodies which were protected by armour , caused no wounds ; they set themselves therefore to hurl their arrows and javelins against the lower part of the body , which was undefended .
__label__1	‘ “ Unless he brings me back a lady , ” ’ said <NAME> , tracing out that part with his finger .
__label__1	'What fancy have you got in your head now ? '
__label__0	“ Can you cook , then , <NAME> ? ” asked <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Good heavens , it is principally because I AM among friends that my state of mind is what it is .
__label__0	At eight o ’ clock , however , the colonists observed a movement on board the “ Speedy. ” A boat was lowered , and seven men jumped into her .
__label__1	Advancing his hand by little and little , he took it up and looked at it .
__label__0	“ In 1854 the <NAME> , <NAME> , and his lieutenant , <NAME> , went in search of <NAME> .
__label__0	“ There they are , little father !
__label__0	What did these groups signify ?
__label__0	But I made them observe that we should be obliged to direct our course contrary to wind and current ; our schooner herself could hardly have succeeded in doing this .
__label__1	‘ I am sure we are very much obliged to him , ’ observed Mrs. Nickleby .
__label__1	Sometimes when I raise my eyes and see her in the black dress that she still wears , teaching my <NAME> , I feel -- it is difficult to express -- as if it were so good to know that she remembers her dear Esther in her prayers .
__label__1	‘ He works , ’ he said , ‘ as bold as a man can .
__label__1	`` Then he 's as good as gold , '' said the little creature -- Oh , in such a motherly , womanly way !
__label__0	`` But if they lap us round ! ''
__label__1	`` But your father and me were partners , <NAME> , '' says the old gentleman , `` and when I am gone , you and <NAME> will have all there is .
__label__0	Notwithstanding the excessive heat of the climate , the thermometer rising in the open air to 45 degrees , and in the shade to 33 degrees , and even to 35 degrees , the commander and his officers carried on with unremitting zeal the observations and surveys which it was the object of the <NAME> to make .
__label__1	‘ Did I always say that that ‘ ere blessed child was the most interesting I ever see ?
__label__0	`` <NAME> was alone , but he had no want of either ammunition , weapons , tools , or seeds .
__label__1	It is not that I can do her any good , or render her any real service ; but she is so attached to me that my visit will have as much effect on her , as if I could do both .
__label__1	But it won ’ t. ’ ‘ Won ’ t be smoothed down ? ’ said I .
__label__1	How few of <NAME> 's faces are left alone to gladden us with their beauty !
__label__1	In reply to this incoherent questioning , the old man informed the deeply affected sister that <NAME> had been taken ill in the office , and discharged in consequence of a witness having proved the robbery to have been committed by another boy , not in custody ; and that the prosecutor had carried him away , in an insensible condition , to his own residence : of and concerning which , all the informant knew was , that it was somewhere in <NAME> , he having heard that word mentioned in the directions to the coachman .
__label__0	Now comes in the narrative a list of names , which are of no great interest : we may mention among them , <NAME> , whence the traveller returned towards the <NAME> ; and finally that he reached <NAME> , the residence of the <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , ’ retorted <NAME> , colouring , ‘ is a wicked , impudent , bold-faced hussy. ’ ‘ What ’ s that ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
__label__0	The following year he returns to <NAME> , and applies himself to learn the language of the country , in order to be able to transact business directly and without any intermediary agent .
__label__0	“ <NAME> , ” said the sailor , “ you will never abandon <NAME> ? ” “ Never , <NAME> , and especially if you make up your mind to stay there. ” “ That was made up long ago , my boy , ” answered <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> , a choleric gentleman , who had taken the fourth place on that seat , flew into a most violent passion , and said that it was a breach of contract to mix him up with such villainous company , and that it was poisonous , and pernicious , and infamous , and shameful , and I do n't know what else .
__label__1	I am always wrong when you are in question .
__label__1	‘ I couldn ’ t forgive myself at such a time as this , Mr Walter , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ and when there ’ s so much serious distress to think about , if I rested hard on anyone , especially on them that little darling <NAME> speaks well of , but I may wish that the family was set to work in a stony soil to make new roads , and that <NAME> went in front , and had the pickaxe ! ’ <NAME> then took breath , and went on faster than before , as if this extraordinary aspiration had relieved her .
__label__1	The whole court , adult as well as boy , is sleepless for that night , and can do nothing but wrap up its many heads , and talk of the ill-fated house , and look at it .
__label__1	‘ That stone has worn away and been replaced by others , and many generations have come and gone since then .
__label__1	With very little excuse for departing so abruptly , <NAME> left him , and , greatly disappointing the loiterers outside the house by telling them there was nothing the matter , got into the coach , and was driven to his own home .
__label__1	<NAME> and you 'll hear all the bells in the city jangling . ''
__label__0	What energy , what strength of mind were requisite in one of the greatest travellers of whom <NAME> has reason to be proud , to succeed in such an enterprise !
__label__0	He laughed at difficulties , whether in the science of magnitudes , that is algebra , or in the science of numbers , that is arithmetic ; and it was a treat to see him handle the symbols , the conventional signs which form the algebraic notation , whether letters of the alphabet , representing quantities or magnitudes , or lines coupled or crossed , which indicate the relation between the quantities and the operations to which they are submitted .
__label__1	While he was there , my sister had been seen standing at the kitchen door , and had exchanged <NAME> with a farm-laborer going home .
__label__1	'Well , and good morning to _you_ , sir , ' replied Mrs. Mann , with many smiles ; 'and hoping you find yourself well , sir ! '
__label__0	`` And if it should take place ? ''
__label__1	To think of your poor sister and her Rampages !
__label__0	`` Yes , a rebel , perhaps an outlaw against humanity ! ''
__label__0	`` Very likely ; but as we advance to the bottom of the gulf , you will see this singular appearance .
__label__0	Few men are more active and strong ; they endure the glacial cold of the mountains equally with the burning heat of the plains .
__label__1	She had installed herself , some time before , as <NAME> 's cup-bearer ; and while they sat under the plane-tree , talking , she kept his glass replenished .
__label__0	We are bound to make the best of our new lodgings , and make ourselves comfortable .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> was so bewildered that he could think of no locality but <NAME> .
__label__0	It is to the Maories what the <NAME> is to the <NAME> , and the <NAME> to the <NAME> .
__label__0	Nothing can be worse for wounds in the shoulder -- unless it was to put you to sleep. ” “ Let us , then , talk of what we ought to do , ” replied Blount .
__label__0	`` You have been talking long enough , men , '' shouted the boatswain , advancing at the moment when the conversation threatened to become dangerous ; `` to work , and have the saws put in quicker !
__label__0	This expedition consisted of the brig <NAME> , 160 tons , <NAME> , and the cutter <NAME> , sixty-five tons , <NAME> commander .
__label__1	Have I suffered nothing in this room , no deprivation , no imprisonment , that I should condescend at last to contemplate myself in such a glass as _that_ .
__label__1	I was awoke by somebody saying ‘ Here he is ! ’ and uncovering my hot head .
__label__0	The colonists waited , therefore , for <NAME> to appear on Prospect Heights .
__label__0	During one whole hour nothing happened to check my progress .
__label__1	I know that in the novelty of possessing a tithe of such means as <NAME> has placed at your disposal , ladies are apt to run into a sudden extreme .
__label__1	I have not inquired among my medical acquaintance , whether <NAME> , and cold Punch , with <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , and all the slight et cetera usually included in an unlimited order for a good dinner—especially when it is left to the liberal construction of my faultless friend , <NAME> , of the <NAME> Hotel—are peculiarly calculated to suffer a sea-change ; or whether a plain mutton-chop , and a glass or two of sherry , would be less likely of conversion into foreign and disconcerting material .
__label__1	Perhaps you have often thought the same .
__label__0	Several times ten or twelve united tried to crush the Nautilus by their weight .
__label__1	She was still doing this , five minutes afterwards .
__label__0	“ Here metals do not get rust on them by exposure to the air , nor men .
__label__0	Independently of the increased and increasing heat , there was another very conclusive demonstration that the earth had thus suddenly approximated towards the sun .
__label__1	You have pawned your wardrobe. ’ ‘ Everything -- <NAME> ’ s too -- all shirts gone -- never mind -- saves washing .
__label__1	And when I come away from him , you know that my thoughts are with him. ” The dreadful condition to which he was brought , was so appalling to both of us , that we could not refer to it in plainer words .
__label__0	One might really say that the honest <NAME> did not feel at his ease in those enormous jaws .
__label__1	<NAME> looks ‘ Excuse me , ’ towards Mrs Veneering , goes out , and finds <NAME> , <NAME> ’ s clerk , at the hall-door .
__label__1	He saw a strength within her that was resistless .
__label__1	Go ! ’ Mrs <NAME> departed according to order , and her amiable husband , ensconcing himself behind the partly opened door , and applying his ear close to it , began to listen with a face of great craftiness and attention .
__label__1	And what a leer there was upon the face !
__label__1	‘ I ’ ll see this <NAME> and <NAME> !
__label__0	The front and hinder part were connected by means of a rude mechanical contrivance , which did not allow of the vehicle turning quickly .
__label__1	They made room for the stranger , but he sat down in the furthest corner , and ate and drank alone , or rather with his dog : to whom he cast a morsel of food from time to time .
__label__1	She had flung herself heavily upon the couch , and with her head drooping over the cushion , and her face hidden in her hands , seemed to be still weeping in an agony of shame and grief .
__label__1	He only took it under his arm , however , and marched out of the office in profound silence .
__label__1	There were no ladies : the trip being a fatiguing one : and we were to start at five o ’ clock in the morning punctually .
__label__1	And not in the same hand , perhaps ?
__label__1	The man against the child , for a bag of gold ! '
__label__1	Polly then put out her light , locked the house-door , delivered the key at an agent ’ s hard by , and went home as fast as she could go ; rejoicing in the shrill delight that her unexpected arrival would occasion there .
__label__1	Even now , coming round by the <NAME> 's Arms with the intention of passing down the court , and out at the <NAME> end , and so terminating his unpremeditated after-supper stroll of ten minutes ' long from his own door and back again , <NAME> approaches .
__label__0	However , one day her heart overflowed , and she told all the events which had occurred from her departure from <NAME> to the death of <NAME> .
__label__1	Not stumbling on the means after all , I was fain to go out to the adjacent Lodge and get the watchman there to come with his lantern .
__label__0	Unfortunately his explorations did not extend to that portion of <NAME> 's <NAME> which lies north-east of the strait , and which was only superficially examined by the <NAME> boats . ''
__label__0	“ It is worthy of remark that the ancient Pole will be immersed under more than 9000 feet of water , so that the district acquired by the <NAME> Practical Association will be flooded unless there exists at the Pole a plateau of more than that number of feet of elevation .
__label__1	Give him several to take away .
__label__1	Another game , with a similar result , was followed by a revoke from the unlucky <NAME> ; on which the fat gentleman burst into a state of high personal excitement which lasted until the conclusion of the game , when he retired into a corner , and remained perfectly mute for one hour and twenty-seven minutes ; at the end of which time he emerged from his retirement , and offered <NAME> a pinch of snuff with the air of a man who had made up his mind to a <NAME> forgiveness of injuries sustained .
__label__0	the veins of coal are still considerable , and the hundred thousand miners who annually extract from them a hundred millions of hundredweights have not nearly exhausted them. ” “ With the increasing consumption of coal , ” replied <NAME> , “ it can be foreseen that the hundred thousand workmen will soon become two hundred thousand , and that the rate of extraction will be doubled. ” “ Doubtless ; but after the <NAME> mines , which will be soon worked more thoroughly with new machines , the <NAME> and <NAME> mines will for a long time yet provide for the consumption in trade. ” “ For how long a time ? ” asked the reporter .
__label__1	His look was thoughtful , but had a benignant expression in it which I often ( how often ! )
__label__1	Under this impression he returned to the charge .
__label__0	Are you , or are you not , the quartermaster of the <NAME> ? ” <NAME> remained impassive , gazing at the coast , deaf to every question .
__label__1	Thinking of her , and of the possibility of her father ’ s release from prison by the unbarring hand of death -- the only change of circumstance he could foresee that might enable him to be such a friend to her as he wished to be , by altering her whole manner of life , smoothing her rough road , and giving her a home -- he regarded her , in that perspective , as his adopted daughter , his poor child of the <NAME> hushed to rest .
__label__0	<NAME> was the first apprentice whom <NAME> had ever admitted to the intimacy of his labours , for he appreciated his intelligence , discretion , and goodness of heart ; and this young man had attached himself to <NAME> with the earnest devotion natural to a noble nature .
__label__0	`` Well , '' said <NAME> , `` we are here , and it is well .
__label__0	“ There , there , ” said <NAME> , “ they ’ re rather rough in their orders to their good moon and her divine sons. ” The doctor , equipped with his travelling medicine-chest , descended to the ground , preceded by <NAME> , who kept a straight countenance and looked as grave and knowing as the circumstances of the case required .
__label__1	he had never played with three thorough-paced female card-players before .
__label__0	<NAME> , properly so called , is composed of two distinct towns : one which is exclusively inhabited by the authorities and officials ; the other more especially devoted to the <NAME> merchants , although , indeed , the trade of the town is of small importance .
__label__1	Now , the eyes of <NAME> had rested on the pretty face of <NAME> many a time and oft before , at church and elsewhere ; but the eyes of <NAME> had never looked so bright , the cheeks of <NAME> had never looked so ruddy , as upon this particular occasion .
__label__0	it is not a thing of yesterday , ” said <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> , for instance , was not more than about 2068 feet high , <NAME> 2121 feet , and <NAME> , the loftiest of them all , about 3047 feet .
__label__1	'You would serve me best , lady , ' replied the girl , wringing her hands , 'if you could take my life at once ; for I have felt more grief to think of what I am , to-night , than I ever did before , and it would be something not to die in the hell in which I have lived .
__label__1	Now , my uncle was never a fast thinker , and if he had thought all these things , I am quite certain it would have taken him till full half-past two o ’ clock at the very least .
__label__0	The constant outrages and humiliations to which Europeans were daily subjected under the most despotic and cowardly government in the world , aroused the indignation of the <NAME> captain , and made him heartily wish that an international expedition might put a stop to so intolerable a state of things .
__label__0	four and a half little minutes ! ''
__label__0	“ Have you a father and mother ? ” said <NAME> .
__label__1	I say no more of that .
__label__0	“ For at least two hundred and fifty or three hundred years. ” “ That is reassuring for us , but a bad look-out for our great-grandchildren ! ” observed <NAME> .
__label__0	Not only did <NAME> fail to keep the rendezvous he himself appointed , but two entire years passed away , and no news whatever of his expedition were received .
__label__0	`` And what is that , Mr .
__label__0	The colony consisted at first of only twenty-nine persons , for whom huts were built and also a provision warehouse .
__label__0	After laying their eggs they cover them with a bed of sand , which they beat down with their carapaces as if they were rammers .
__label__1	I do ; I say again , I do .
__label__1	She was calmed and comforted by the thought , and went to rest with a lighter heart .
__label__0	The agile <NAME> was soon upon his feet again , and lost no time in knocking down two of his long-gowned adversaries with his fists and a vigorous application of his toes ; then , rushing out of the pagoda as fast as his legs could carry him , he soon escaped the third priest by mingling with the crowd in the streets .
__label__0	She got farther than any ship had ever done before . ''
__label__1	For nearly a whole week , the <NAME> , & c. , is in course of removal .
__label__0	The mass was compact , and of an extremely close grain .
__label__1	‘ You addressed the daughter , I observed , ’ said Mr Dombey , after a short pause , ‘ as <NAME> Granger. ’ ‘ Edith <NAME> , <NAME> , ’ returned the Major , stopping short again , and punching a mark in the ground with his cane , to represent her , ‘ married ( at eighteen ) Granger of <NAME> ; ’ whom the Major indicated by another punch .
__label__1	<NAME> was a capital way of raising his spirits , and putting him quite at his ease .
__label__0	They carefully examined the high lava-cliffs of <NAME> from the base to the crest , although it was extremely difficult to reach even the level of the gulf .
__label__1	_Pictures from <NAME> is also available from <NAME> as a separate eText.—DP .
__label__1	Mr Blandois , during this exposition , had been strictly attentive , keeping his eyes fastened on the lady , and thoughtfully stroking his moustache with his two hands .
__label__0	`` One to <NAME> , for instance . ''
__label__0	`` In fact , we are very much better off than those who skate on the <NAME> , and who are in constant dread of falling through ; we have no such fear . ''
__label__1	The only doubt in <NAME> was , whether <NAME> had written in good faith , believing that he really would come back , or warning him to fly .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> , expressing his regret that his purse contained only paper money , begged to place it at <NAME> ’ s disposal .
__label__1	There were some marks in it that might have been dimples , if the material had been softer and the instrument finer , but which , as it was , were only dints .
__label__0	“ See what that wretched promise costs me , ” sighed <NAME> , as , at a gesture from his sister , he replaced under his arm the gun which had instinctively gone up to his shoulder .
__label__0	“ And that year , like every other year , ought to be divided into twelve months. ” “ Yes , certainly , if you wish it , ” said the captain , acquiescing .
__label__1	‘ I dare say you can stoop to pick it up , after what you have stooped to here. ’ ‘ I have stooped to nothing but this , ’ <NAME> answered as he took it from the ground ; ‘ and this is mine , for I have earned it by the hardest of hard labour. ’ ‘ You ’ re a pretty quick packer , I hope , ’ said Mr Boffin ; ‘ because the sooner you are gone , bag and baggage , the better for all parties. ’ ‘ You need have no fear of my lingering. ’ ‘ There ’ s just one thing though , ’ said Mr Boffin , ‘ that I should like to ask you before we come to a good riddance , if it was only to show this young lady how conceited you schemers are , in thinking that nobody finds out how you contradict yourselves. ’ ‘ Ask me anything you wish to ask , ’ returned <NAME> , ‘ but use the expedition that you recommend. ’ ‘ You pretend to have a mighty admiration for this young lady ? ’ said Mr Boffin , laying his hand protectingly on <NAME> ’ s head without looking down at her .
__label__1	Commission to the extent of two and ninepence in a fortnight can not , however limited our ideas , be considered remunerative. ’ We were all agreed upon that .
__label__1	As they passed where he sat , <NAME> looked so wistfully at the little turn-out , that the old gentleman looked at him .
__label__1	<NAME> is but a poor calling .
__label__0	Quite a nice little ride ! ” “ If we were within range , ” sighed the sportsman , “ I should amuse myself with dismounting a few of them. ” “ Exactly , ” said the doctor ; “ but then they would have you within range also , and our balloon would offer only too plain a target to the bullets from their long guns ; and , if they were to make a hole in it , I leave you to judge what our situation would be ! ” The pursuit of the <NAME> continued all morning ; and by eleven o ’ clock the aeronauts had made scarcely fifteen miles to the westward .
__label__0	Thus all the dwellers on the coasts , from <NAME> to <NAME> , as well as the people living on the shores of the <NAME> , seeing the great <NAME> ocean open to their vessels , began to inquire , whether indeed this new route might not conduct them to the shores of <NAME> .
__label__1	You see me looking on you now , and you can read the warmth of passion for you that is breathing in my face. ’ Not a curl of the proud lip , not a flash of the dark eye , nothing but the same intent and searching look , accompanied these words .
__label__0	The destruction of the brig had been a new source of riches .
__label__1	It led him to nothing , and therefore is no great matter , save in the intention .
__label__1	‘ I was acquainted with all this , you know , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ except the last clause , long ago .
__label__1	The coach is gone , but the street is steep , and narrow , and blocked up , and <NAME> can see it at a stand-still in the distance , she is sure .
__label__0	It would have been difficult for matters to have turned out otherwise .
__label__1	The instant over , he says , sensibly touched : ‘ I am afraid I am but a shallow , surface kind of fellow , <NAME> , and that my headpiece is none of the best .
__label__1	Would you wish to have it up to-night , my boy , and drink to <NAME> ’ r and his wife ? ’ The Instrument-maker , looking wistfully at the <NAME> , puts his hand into the breast-pocket of his coffee-coloured coat , brings forth his pocket-book , and takes a letter out .
__label__0	Most probably he was standing bravely at his post on the <NAME> , his eye glued to the great <NAME> , his whole soul peering through its tube .
__label__1	The remarkable feature in the case was , that if the unfortunate deceased were not really murdered by this own son of his , he must have been murdered by his own brother .
__label__0	`` Yes , and it was the last service he desired to render us before his death ! ''
__label__0	's <NAME> , <NAME> of <NAME> and <NAME> 's <NAME> -- Cape Hector forming the southern extremity of the latter .
__label__0	They could scarcely believe it possible ; at two yards and a half below water-mark was a regular rent , in the form of an isosceles triangle .
__label__1	Once for all ; I knew to my sorrow , often and often , if not always , that I loved her against reason , against promise , against peace , against hope , against happiness , against all discouragement that could be .
__label__0	They dug down into a parched and powdery sand -- the very dryest of all sand , indeed -- there was not one trace of moisture !
__label__0	`` And you pretend , <NAME> , '' asked <NAME> , `` that by means of these hieroglyphics , more incomprehensible than the <NAME> , you can find what initiatory speed it was necessary to give the projectile ? ''
__label__1	These are not the hands she knew , this is not the face she knew , this is not a voice she ever heard .
__label__1	<NAME> ’ s eyes followed him to the door , lighted on Mr Boffin complacently thrown back in his easy chair , and drooped over her book .
__label__1	Put me in the dock anywhere -- I don ’ t care where -- and I says , “ My Lord , I am a honest man. ” Put me in the witness-box anywhere -- I don ’ t care where -- and I says the same to his lordship , and I kisses the book .
__label__0	He acquitted his task with characteristic serenity , and invariably replied to the remonstrances of his fair companion , who was confused by his patience and generosity : `` It is in the interest of my journey -- a part of my programme . ''
__label__0	The storm of contempt was so thoroughly <NAME> that it was untranslatable even in <NAME> .
__label__1	A short pause followed these consolatory remarks of <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> ’ t ! ’ Old Sol endeavoured to assume a cheery look , and smiled across the little table at him as pleasantly as he could .
__label__1	The <NAME> , and the <NAME> LVII .
__label__0	`` The weather is lightening a little , '' said he .
__label__1	Come here , my little witch !
__label__0	<NAME> streets ! ” “ My dear Manoel ! ” said <NAME> , “ do protect us against my brother !
__label__1	<NAME> displacements of the raging sea , made by the falling wounded .
__label__1	So do I. I take it that my business in the social system is to be agreeable ; I take it that everybody 's business in the social system is to be agreeable .
__label__1	The other commodities were addressed to the general public ; but they were never offered by the vendors to Mr Dombey .
__label__0	“ You know as well as I do that there are no rocks in the channel. ” “ But suppose she had run against this piece of iron ? ” said the engineer , showing the broken cylinder .
__label__1	‘ Is it not a good place ? ’ ‘ Yes , yes , ’ said the schoolmaster .
__label__0	“ My means of ascent and descent consist simply in dilating or contracting the gas that is in the balloon by the application of different temperatures , and here is the method of obtaining that result .
__label__0	`` <NAME> has no right to wet us in this country , '' he used to say ; `` it ought to appear only as a solid , or a gas ; as to its being liquid , it 's absurd !
__label__0	Dogs , goats , and other animals run about the dirty streets half-starved , whose hungry looks can only be exceeded by the famishing appearance of the men , women , and children , which bespeaks the penury and wretchedness to which they are reduced ; whilst the persons of many of them are covered with odious boils , and their huts are falling to the ground from neglect and decay . ''
__label__0	Eyes and ears could not surely both deceive me .
__label__1	`` Do n't scold the old lady .
__label__1	Following the current with her eyes , she saw a bloody face turned up towards the moon , and drifting away .
__label__0	`` What a pair of beauties you are !
__label__1	'You know that <NAME> is worse to-night , my fascinator ? '
__label__0	“ But it would perhaps be a good thing to do it with this instrument , which is more perfect than that which you before used. ” “ What is the good ? ” said <NAME> .
__label__0	Then the river divided into two important branches , which flowed off toward the <NAME> , one going away northeastward , the other eastward , and between them appeared the beginning of the large island of <NAME> .
__label__0	The upper part of our dress terminated in a copper collar upon which was screwed the metal helmet .
__label__1	‘ Not by no means , ’ acquiesced <NAME> , affably but magisterially .
__label__0	`` Sir , '' he would have said to me , `` this is not the way !
__label__0	A few lightning flashes were reflected in the water ; summer lightning , without thunder .
__label__0	I should be as glad as any one else to have a glass of whiskey , especially on such a cold day ; but if in the long run it does more harm than good , why , I 'm very willing to get along without it . ''
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> , bending low closed the eyes of him who had once been the <NAME> , and was now not even <NAME> .
__label__0	And <NAME> , swelling out his cheeks , blew so much and so well into the tube-taking care to twirl it round at the same time -- that his breath dilated the glassy mass .
__label__1	A little later on in the dinner , <NAME> reviewed the sermon with some severity , and intimated -- in the usual hypothetical case of the Church being “ thrown open ” -- what kind of sermon he would have given them .
__label__0	It is decked , quite water-tight , and held together by solid bolts .
__label__1	How can I think so , looking back on such a trifling wasted youth as mine !
__label__0	bah ! ” “ The conclusion of all , ” said <NAME> , “ is that we must not fall into their hands .
__label__1	My aunt mused a little while , and then said : ‘ Mr .
__label__1	‘ There are bad tidings in that letter. ’ ‘ Yes .
__label__1	‘ How dare you presume to speak to me , sir -- to address me -- to come into my presence ? ’ ‘ You look prettier in a passion , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , stooping down , the better to see her face .
__label__0	Each group of these booths , of all sizes and shapes , formed a separate quarter particularly dedicated to some special branch of commerce .
__label__0	I had nothing to say .
__label__0	`` And as a proof , '' added the clerk , `` here are the desecrator 's very shoes , which he left behind him . ''
__label__1	I made a mistake ; we are all liable to mistakes ; I wo n't do so any more , and I 'll become such a lawyer as is not often seen .
__label__1	‘ They came , and raised her , and placed her on the bed .
__label__1	“ Why do n't you cry ? ” “ Because I do n't want to. ” “ You do , ” said she .
__label__1	But he was a tight-fisted hand at the grind-stone , <NAME> !
__label__1	First of all , she would bring out the immense account-book , and lay it down upon the table , with a deep sigh .
__label__0	Its climate is mild and moist .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> roused me from this reflection , which was blended with a certain remorseful apprehension of seeing <NAME> himself , by bestowing many encomiums on the absent Littimer as a most respectable fellow , and a thoroughly admirable servant .
__label__1	`` You know I do ; you see me do it . ''
__label__0	So that the time of the full moon was well chosen .
__label__0	[ Illustration ] <NAME> went upon the quarter-deck .
__label__0	“ What does it all mean ? ” exclaimed the captain , every hour growing more and more bewildered .
__label__0	My uncle and Hans pressed my arms , and the raft carried us all three away .
__label__0	Besides , the son of the old overman was there , waiting at the appointed rendezvous .
__label__0	It had followed , on one side , the valley of <NAME> , and on the other that of <NAME> , evaporating those watercourses in its passage .
__label__1	The black driver dances like a madman .
__label__1	At this hint , the wan page , who had been surveying the party over the top of the chair , vanished behind it , as if the ground had swallowed him up .
__label__1	I may be slow , but I am precious sure. ’ Not a syllable of this reflection shaped itself in any scrap of Mr Fledgeby ’ s breath , lest it should tend to put his servant ’ s price up .
__label__1	But I do assure you that it is a satisfaction to me to receive you in my humble home .
__label__1	The old gentleman paused ; <NAME> was biting his lips , with his eyes fixed upon the floor ; seeing this , he immediately resumed : 'The end of a year found him contracted , solemnly contracted , to that daughter ; the object of the first , true , ardent , only passion of a guileless girl . '
__label__1	“ Him that I ’ ve know ’ d so intimate so many years , and like so much .
__label__1	I wish she had me to deal with ! ’ said <NAME> , reddening with the energy of the wish .
__label__1	I must tell you that as to this , I have felt , ever since I have been away , an anxiety which I am very anxious to relieve .
__label__1	These things she could plainly see .
__label__0	But was the death of the adventurers so very certain after all ?
__label__1	Bless your eyes , here 's old <NAME> .
__label__0	“ The polar-star there , that does its work honorably in pointing out the direction due north to everybody else , will , most likely , do me that service. ” He discovered , with satisfaction , that the current was taking him toward the northern shore of the lake , and he allowed himself to glide with it .
__label__0	Looking carefully over the <NAME> and catching occasional glimpses of semi-circular formations and half domes , he concluded that the chain must have formerly been a succession of vast craters .
__label__0	Fifty-five feet from the ground , in an angle of the building , they recognized the window of the cell in which <NAME> was confined .
__label__1	‘ That is because you are good ; not because I am !
__label__0	cried <NAME> , when his companion had depicted this scene to him with much energy .
__label__1	‘ Avay vith melincholly , as the little boy said ven his schoolmissus died .
__label__0	`` It awoke in me , '' says <NAME> , in a narrative preserved by <NAME> , `` a great desire and a kind of ardour in my heart to do myself also something famous , and knowing by examining the globe , that if I sailed by the west wind I should reach <NAME> more rapidly , I at once made my project known to His Majesty , who was much satisfied with it . ''
__label__1	‘ You have been so very anxious I am sure you are not well. ’ ‘ I am as well , ’ returned the old man , shutting up his right hand , and holding it out to show her : ‘ as well and firm as any man at my time of life can hope to be .
__label__0	`` Yes , your honour ; a pilot-boat -- No .
__label__1	<NAME> therefore slipped quietly out , and went to brother <NAME> ’ s room .
__label__1	<NAME> , for ever and ever .
__label__1	Which contains a brief Account of the <NAME> of the Action of <NAME> against Pickwick 27 .
__label__1	Thus , in the midst of the mud and at the heart of the fog , sits the <NAME> Chancellor in his <NAME> of Chancery .
__label__0	The oyster-bed among the rocks was frequently renewed , and furnished excellent molluscs .
__label__1	`` At it again , in a new direction !
__label__1	But these fears vanished before a well-trimmed lamp and the familiar aspect of her own room .
__label__1	‘ It is remarkable too , ’ thought <NAME> : ‘ if it had been “ Kate ” or “ <NAME> , ” I should not have been so much surprised : but “ little <NAME> ! ” ’ The wine coming at the moment prevented his finishing the sentence .
__label__0	Having <NAME> in her power , she would have been the woman to torture her with all the refinement of a Redskin in order to wrest her secret from her .
__label__0	This block covered a small natural crater hollowed in the cone , and by its own weight prevented the egress of the subterranean fire .
__label__1	‘ As if , with my head in its present throbbing state , you couldn ’ t go and look at the shells and minerals and things provided for you , instead of circuses ! ’ said Mrs. Gradgrind .
__label__1	‘ Will you have some of this ? ’ said the fat boy , plunging into the pie up to the very ferules of the knife and fork .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> was naturally a headlong , careless sort of dog , and he had had five tumblers of hot punch into the bargain ; so , although he was a little startled at first , he began to grow rather indignant when he saw the old gentleman winking and leering at him with such an impudent air .
__label__1	If he comes back , and leaves the boy behind him ; if he gets off free , and dead or alive , fails to restore him to me ; murder him yourself if you would have him escape <NAME> .
__label__0	`` For you have shown what stuff you are made of , and I know all you 've done .
__label__1	It is a great privilege .
__label__1	Did you observe his excited eye , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , Sir. ’ ‘ I haven ’ t touched a drop of spirits this morning , ’ said the man , who was as sober a fellow as need be .
__label__1	It was as if I had seen <NAME> , in all her fascinating artlessness , caressing <NAME> , and thanking her , and coaxingly appealing against me , and loving me with all her childish innocence .
__label__1	Do you know that you are talking to a gentleman , sir , who at one time could have bought up fifty such men as you and all you have ?
__label__0	He drew forth a metal case , with the cover screwed on , and which seemed to have suffered in no way from its sojourn in the water .
__label__0	`` Gentlemen , '' said he , in opening the discussion , `` I presume that we are all agreed that this experiment can not and ought not to be tried anywhere but within the limits of the soil of the <NAME> .
__label__0	A long swell , which the canoe scarcely felt , as it was heavily laden , rolled regularly over the surface of the water .
__label__1	The clerk in the <NAME> involuntarily applauded .
__label__1	'Well , well , ' said <NAME> , 'every trade has its drawbacks .
__label__0	“ Six miles at least ! ” observed the one .
__label__1	Nothing can change them , or prevent them coming back. ’ ‘ I do not understand , ’ said <NAME> , gazing on her agitated face which seemed to darken as she looked .
__label__0	Their territory included <NAME> , <NAME> , the provinces of <NAME> , <NAME> , and the <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Not at all so. ’ ‘ She is a tiresome creature , ’ said <NAME> , pouting .
__label__0	During these few days , which to them appeared like centuries , it would seem that the old woman and the girl would have been led to speak of their situation .
__label__1	I shall accompany you. ’ ‘ You ! ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	Well , we came to the old boat again in good time at night ; and there <NAME> and Mrs. <NAME> bade us good-bye , and drove away snugly to their own home .
__label__0	Further on here is the word _ypo_ .
__label__0	Possibly he would not have done this had he been aware that <NAME> was sufficiently acquainted with his history to address him by the name of <NAME> .
__label__0	and without touching its duration .
__label__1	She died when I was born .
__label__1	Shutting his eyes and rolling .
__label__1	Several swaggering sinners had written their own biographies in the same strain ; it always appearing from the lessons of those very boastful persons , that you were to do good , not because it <NAME> good , but because you were to make a good thing of it .
__label__0	When <NAME> 's turn came , he went to relieve <NAME> .
__label__1	I didn ’ t think you would ; and I want , more than ever , to be liked , now <NAME> is gone. ’ I have omitted to mention it , by the by .
__label__1	‘ Shall I tell you , ’ asked <NAME> , ‘ what I see down there ? ’ ‘ Limited little b ? ’ suggested <NAME> with her eyebrows raised .
__label__0	During the ensuing day , the recent passage of a large body of foot and horse became more and more apparent .
__label__1	These portentous infants being alarming creatures to stalk about in any human society , the eighteen denominations incessantly scratched one another ’ s faces and pulled one another ’ s hair by way of agreeing on the steps to be taken for their improvement—which they never did ; a surprising circumstance , when the happy adaptation of the means to the end is considered .
__label__1	Look angry at me , <NAME> .
__label__0	“ Courage , my brave horse ! ” cried <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> reasoned thus with their simple good sense , and they acted as the best surgeon would have done .
__label__0	It proved to be a fragment of dis-colored marble , on which several letters were inscribed , of which the only part at all decipherable was the syllable “ Vil. ” “ Vil -- <NAME> ! ” he cried out , in his excitement dropping the marble , which was broken into atoms by the fall .
__label__0	It could now be seen that one of the convicts held a lead-line in his hand , and that he wished to fathom the depth of the channel hollowed out by the current of the <NAME> .
__label__1	And she gets on so placidly. ’ ‘ Oh , ’ returned <NAME> , with contemptuous patronage , ‘ she ’ s a regular girl .
__label__0	O no , -- its wheels are good !
__label__0	Arriving there on the 5th of July in such gloomy , rainy weather , that it was with no small difficulty that the entrance of the harbour of <NAME> , where D'Entrecasteaux made a stay of eight days , was made out ; whilst there the travellers received several visits from the score of natives , who seem to make up the total population of the place .
__label__0	`` Then we must remain in our car ? ''
__label__0	`` <NAME> ; but to extract this money the expense would be greater than the profit .
__label__1	We hope to have , before long , a board of fact , composed of commissioners of fact , who will force the people to be a people of fact , and of nothing but fact .
__label__1	‘ When you leave work of a night , between this and your going away , just hang about the <NAME> an hour or so , will you ?
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> went forward and took her hand .
__label__1	How every circumstance of her short , eventful life , came thronging into her mind , as they travelled on !
__label__1	I beg and pray that I may stay with you !
__label__1	To <NAME> Noggs he forwarded one half of the sum he had realised , entreating him to take an opportunity of handing it to <NAME> in secret , and conveying to her the warmest assurances of his love and affection .
__label__1	“ I was much engaged that day , and could not complete my letter that night .
__label__1	Then came the <NAME> , who complained that these same people _would_ get drunk , and showed in tabular statements that they did get drunk , and proved at tea parties that no inducement , human or <NAME> ( except a medal ) , would induce them to forego their custom of getting drunk .
__label__1	‘ This here sluicing night is hard lines to a man as lives on his condition. ’ <NAME> proffered a glass of rum , which the <NAME> , throwing back his head , emptied into himself , as into a cask , after proposing the brief sentiment , ‘ Towards us ! ’ Mr Toots and the Captain returning then to the parlour , and taking their seats before the fire , Mr <NAME> began : ‘ Mr Gills -- ’ ‘ Awast ! ’ said the <NAME> .
__label__1	We never knew a person , she wrote ; but to think that <NAME> should seem to be so different from what she had been thought to be , was a Moral ! -- that was her word .
__label__0	`` Well , I know , '' replied <NAME> .
__label__1	But it took a bit of time to get it well round , the change come so oncommon plump ; did n't it ? ” Somehow , I was not best pleased with <NAME> 's being so mightily secure of me .
__label__1	There ’ s many of them , I ’ m sure , that would be the better for it. ’ ‘ Thank you , <NAME> .
__label__0	As may be imagined the captain tried to land , but a barrier of ice prevented his doing so .
__label__1	There was one little ceremony peculiar to the day , both the matter and manner of which made a very strong impression upon <NAME> .
__label__0	After looking for a site upon which to build a town , he laid the foundation of <NAME> in a spot at the mouth of a river which formed a harbour , and at a distance of thirty miles east from <NAME> .
__label__0	A parrot and dog which had also eaten of the fish died next day .
__label__1	‘ Oh ! ’ said <NAME> , as soon as he recovered his suspended power of speech .
__label__1	However , if he won ’ t lead , I can ’ t follow .
__label__0	It is fifty-five minutes past ten ; we have been gone about eight minutes ; and if our initiatory speed has not been checked by the friction , six seconds would be enough for us to pass through the forty miles of atmosphere which surrounds the globe . ''
__label__1	It ’ s my innings now , gov ’ nor , and as soon as I catches hold o ’ this ‘ ere <NAME> , I ’ ll have a good ‘ un. ’ ‘ I hope you will , <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Drat ‘ em , ’ says <NAME> ‘ you read the same things over ‘ em and instead of sovereigns get sixpences ! ’ Mr Sownds the beadle is more liberal than Mrs Miff -- but then he is not a pew-opener .
__label__0	On his fourth voyage <NAME> and his small party of followers started from <NAME> , the nearest point to the <NAME> regions , and , after passing <NAME> , made for the north ; but a violent storm broke up the ice , there only three feet thick , and involved the explorers in the greatest danger .
__label__1	Alive to every sound , in his anxious and expectant state , <NAME> hurried downstairs , and , uttering a cry of joyful surprise , dragged the welcome visitor into the passage and up the stairs , and said not a word until he had him safe in his own garret and the door was shut behind them , when he mixed a great mug-full of gin-and-water , and holding it to <NAME> ’ s mouth , as one might hold a bowl of medicine to the lips of a refractory child , commanded him to drain it to the last drop .
__label__1	He goes downstairs , and <NAME> tries to compose himself before the fire for waiting a long time .
__label__1	‘ Upon my soul , <NAME> , she ’ s a perfect beauty -- a -- a picture , a statue , a -- a -- upon my soul she is ! ’ ‘ Well , ’ replied <NAME> , shrugging his shoulders and manifesting an indifference , whether he felt it or not ; ‘ that ’ s a matter of taste ; if mine doesn ’ t agree with yours , so much the better. ’ ‘ Confound it ! ’ reasoned the lord , ‘ you were thick enough with her that day , anyhow .
__label__1	<NAME> looked as if she would like to trace the connexion of ideas between <NAME> and <NAME> ’ s <NAME> ’ s <NAME> .
__label__0	I 've arrested more than one of these gentlemen in my time , and , if my thief is on board , I 'll answer for it ; he 'll not slip through my fingers . ''
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> suffered no pain , but he was visibly sinking .
__label__1	<NAME> ’ t stop to say one word to me , but go .
__label__1	You must not be surprised to see him take me under his protection , for he has never forgotten that I was a low boy at school and that our friendship began in his knocking two of my head tyrant 's teeth out ( he says six ) before breakfast .
__label__1	The piping is carried above your jistes , and it is best that it should be made known to you. ’ <NAME> and <NAME> exchanged looks of some dismay , though they had not the least idea what latent horrors this carriage of the piping might involve .
__label__0	His travelling overcoat was divided into two unequal parts , and his trousers resembled those of certain Indians , which fit less compactly than they are easy to put on .
__label__1	It is so dark that nothing can be made out in it , over a little counter , but another tallow candle in another old tin candlestick , close to the face of a man stooping low in a chair .
__label__0	This man had apparently not been induced to take service by the bribe of high wages or prize money .
__label__0	`` Yes , my friend ; it deceived us with respect to its size as well as the distance !
__label__1	‘ Ma , ’ interposed the young lady , ‘ I must say I think it would be much better if you would keep to the point , and not hold forth about people ’ s flying into people ’ s faces , which is nothing more nor less than impossible nonsense. ’ ‘ How ! ’ exclaimed <NAME> , knitting her dark brows .
__label__0	Meanwhile the natives made hostile demonstrations .
__label__0	They soon made acquaintance with the Patagonians , and exchanged a few trifles , precious to the natives , for swansdown and gunaco skins .
__label__1	To whom it is no matter what living waters run high or low , reflect the heavenly lights and darknesses , produce their little growth of weeds and flowers , turn here , turn there , are noisy or still , are troubled or at rest , for their course has one sure termination , though their sources and devices are many .
__label__1	Oh , don ’ t cry. ’ ‘ I won ’ t cry any more , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	Oh , my <NAME> , may I beg a word with you ? ''
__label__1	‘ O ’ course you air , ’ said <NAME> argumentatively .
__label__0	The forepart had disappeared completely , and the hind part up to the axle .
__label__0	A wager of twenty thousand pounds lost , because he , like a precious fool , had gone into that abominable pagoda !
__label__1	‘ You ’ ll always find a little bit of soap in the kitchen window ; that belongs to you. ’ <NAME> opened his eyes , but not his mouth ; and <NAME> was again going away , when he once more turned back .
__label__0	He spent five months in <NAME> , and then set sail for <NAME> ; but the winds were again unfavourable , and after undergoing great hardships he landed at the town of <NAME> of the present day ; then having spent some time at Nankin he returned to Fi-an-foo , his native town , after an absence of eighteen months .
__label__1	Can I have a word with you ? ’ ‘ <NAME> .
__label__1	But , from this aperture , he had never ceased to call on those without , to guard the back ; and thus , when the murderer emerged at last on the house-top by the door in the roof , a loud shout proclaimed the fact to those in front , who immediately began to pour round , pressing upon each other in an unbroken stream .
__label__1	‘ Impossible to imagine , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	In addition to the crew of 1460 , a reinforcement of 470 marines was added to the fleet .
__label__1	You were going to say , that I , who know the story of <NAME> ’ s life -- ’ ‘ May think it pride in me , ’ she continued , ‘ when I say that I am proud of him !
__label__1	It was with some difficulty that she could be induced to go back with the excuse ; but the promise of being told a story -- of old her great delight -- on condition that she concentrated her faculties upon the errand and left her little mistress to herself for an hour longer , combined with a misgiving on <NAME> ’ s part that she had left her good temper at the bottom of the staircase , prevailed .
__label__1	I trust it confidently to your not suppressing anything .
__label__1	He finds himself again constantly in bars of public-houses , being treated and lying dreadfully .
__label__1	`` Begging your pardon for interrupting you a moment ? ''
__label__0	For the public , when they pay .
__label__1	If <NAME> had not decided against falling in love with <NAME> ; if he had had the weakness to do it ; if he had , little by little , persuaded himself to set all the earnestness of his nature , all the might of his hope , and all the wealth of his matured character , on that cast ; if he had done this and found that all was lost ; he would have been , that night , unutterably miserable .
__label__0	Lieutenant Procope , who had sedulously inserted the outline of the newly revealed shore upon the maps , announced that it had ceased to run east and west , and had taken a turn due north , thus forming a barrier to their continuing their previous direction .
__label__1	Oliver availed himself of the kind permission , and fell to the floor in a fainting fit .
__label__0	The charts and drawings relating to his last voyage were engraved at the expense of the government , and the proceeds of their sale divided among <NAME> 's family , and the heirs of <NAME> Clerke and <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ How can I prevent his having his own way ? ’ began the dressmaker .
__label__0	As for his photographs , they were sold of all size , and his portrait taken in every imaginable posture .
__label__0	This day , as on other <NAME> , we observed as a day of rest and pious meditation .
__label__1	‘ And when I heard what had happened before that snowy night , from some belonging to our town , ’ cried <NAME> , ‘ the bitterest thought in all my mind was , that the people would remember she once kept company with me , and would say I had corrupted her !
__label__1	‘ Good-bye ! ’ ‘ Good-bye ! ’ said the pretty housemaid .
__label__1	‘ He was only called the other day .
__label__1	But they ’ re <NAME> metal. ’ ‘ The silver will be the brighter when it comes , ’ said I .
__label__1	I think the reply was , `` Cut away , then ! ''
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> -- ‘ Law , civil power , and exekative ; them ’ s my titles ; here ’ s my authority .
__label__0	I can see up yonder natural cradles , in which once safely tucked up we shall sleep as if we were in the best beds in the world .
__label__1	Sweeping past the gold and silver demonstration on the sideboard as if it were heaped-up dirt , and deigning to bestow no look upon the elegancies around her , she took her place at his board for the first time , and sat , like a statue , at the feast .
__label__0	These were principally third-class passengers , who were , happily , not troubled by the prospect of a long return voyage .
__label__0	They hastened up the slope , spurred on by the loud cries that drew nearer and nearer .
__label__0	`` Without doubt , '' replied the little old man , laughing .
__label__1	‘ I was thinking of the other proverbial church person -- Job , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	We changed again , and yet again , and it was now too late and too far to go back , and I went on .
__label__1	When I opened the shutters and looked out at the wet wild morning , all of a leaden hue ; when I walked from room to room ; when I sat down again shivering , before the fire , waiting for my laundress to appear ; I thought how miserable I was , but hardly knew why , or how long I had been so , or on what day of the week I made the reflection , or even who I was that made it .
__label__1	I had never laughed and cried in all my life , I dare say -- not even to her -- more freely than I did that morning .
__label__0	`` Without doubt , and here it is , '' answered <NAME> , producing a paper which indicated the longitude and latitude of <NAME> , `` the present residence of <NAME> and five <NAME> colonists . ''
__label__1	The second piece was the last new grand comic Christmas pantomime , in the first scene of which , it pained me to suspect that I detected <NAME> with red worsted legs under a highly magnified phosphoric countenance and a shock of red curtain-fringe for his hair , engaged in the manufacture of thunderbolts in a mine , and displaying great cowardice when his gigantic master came home ( very hoarse ) to dinner .
__label__1	‘ But I am to give it to himself , if you please. ’ The excessive audacity of this retort so overpowered Mr Chuckster , and so moved his tender regard for his friend ’ s honour , that he declared , if he were not restrained by official considerations , he must certainly have annihilated <NAME> upon the spot ; a resentment of the affront which he did consider , under the extraordinary circumstances of aggravation attending it , could but have met with the proper sanction and approval of a jury of <NAME> , who , he had no doubt , would have returned a verdict of justifiable Homicide , coupled with a high testimony to the morals and character of the <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Go , deceiver , go , some day , <NAME> , p ’ r ’ aps you ’ ll waken , from pleasure ’ s dream to know , the grief of orphans forsaken .
__label__1	He can scarcely let Mr <NAME> ’ s hand go , he is so congratulatory ; and he shakes the <NAME> ’ s hand so heartily at the same time , that his voice shakes too , in accord with his arms , as it comes sliding from between his teeth .
__label__0	Top and <NAME> accompanied them .
__label__0	“ No ! ” at length exclaimed <NAME> ; “ to remain here would look as though we were abandoning my father and doubting his innocence -- as though we were afraid to make common cause with him .
__label__0	<NAME> feathers were so much in vogue that they had to be imported from <NAME> and <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Oh , <NAME> , when ? ’ ‘ Now , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	His eyes are then fixed upon her , she knows , though her own see nothing but the grass .
__label__1	`` Yes , with <NAME> on it .
__label__1	It ’ s of no use cross-examining my eyes , ’ cried <NAME> , winking and rubbing them , ‘ they stick to their first account , and will .
__label__1	“ You are a good man and a true friend , ” said <NAME> , in an altered voice .
__label__1	This nerved me to get rid of <NAME> , who went so mildly , on receipt of wages , that I was surprised , until I found out about the tea-spoons , and also about the little sums she had borrowed in my name of the tradespeople without authority .
__label__0	It has by some authors truly been called the whale of the saurian race , for it is as big and quick in its motions as our king of the seas .
__label__1	'And always put this in your pipe , Nolly , ' said the <NAME> , as the Jew was heard unlocking the door above , 'if you do n't take fogels and tickers -- ' 'What 's the good of talking in that way ? '
__label__0	The sun was low on the horizon , but an hour had still to elapse before nightfall .
__label__0	Now the first principle of training is to get rid of the fat on both horse and jockey , and this is done by means of purging , sweating , and violent exercise .
__label__1	But all he could do was to comfort and console her by kind words ; and words they were of such love and kindness , and cheerful encouragement , that poor <NAME> threw her arms about his neck , and declared she would weep no more .
__label__0	They readily recognized the amiable <NAME> , but they could not allure the shivering , whining animal from her retreat without a good deal of coaxing .
__label__1	Meanwhile the chaise proceeded , without any slackening of pace , towards the conclusion of the stage .
__label__0	We had remained on the summit an hour .
__label__1	YOU understand what sweating a pound means , don ’ t you ? ’ ‘ Much as you do , sir , ’ returned the old man , with his hands under opposite cuffs of his loose sleeves , as he stood at the table , deferentially observant of the master ’ s face .
__label__1	It was but momentary , of course , and a mere fancy , but I felt it keenly for all that .
__label__1	I feared the light might dazzle her eyes and wake her , so I brought it here. ’ He spoke rather to himself than to the visitor , but when he had put the lamp upon the table , he took it up , as if impelled by some momentary recollection or curiosity , and held it near his face .
__label__1	My fair young <NAME> wife ! -- we saw the man , who was supposed to be at the gate , standing silent behind him .
__label__0	The doors and the pillars of the verandahs are adorned with fairly well executed carvings , representing such scenes as a boa killing an antelope , or a pig , or a group of warriors and drummers .
__label__1	Even when we 've good cards , <NAME> and I ca n't make nothing of 'em . '
__label__1	Well , supposing <NAME> is one of them ? ” “ Why then , ” said the turnkey , grinning again , “ he knows what <NAME> is. ” “ Yah ! ” cried <NAME> , suddenly hitting out at the turnkey in a facetious way , “ you 're dumb as one of your own keys when you have to do with my principal , you know you are .
__label__1	The young man and the girl both laughed .
__label__1	He never thought of <NAME> .
__label__0	I could see its green and red lights , and its white lantern hanging from the large foremast .
__label__1	I am very sorry I intruded , I am sure .
__label__0	Now that we had actually started , I began to believe in the reality of the undertaking !
__label__0	“ No , but I must ! ” persisted the professor again .
__label__1	`` But knows a quantity , I suppose ?
__label__1	‘ -- It would be so useful to us afterwards , ’ I went on .
__label__1	‘ She is a curate ’ s daughter , ’ said <NAME> ; ‘ one of ten , down in <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Now then ! -- is that chaise coming out to-night ? ’ cried <NAME> .
__label__0	The watery expanse did not present a single speck of land , not a solid surface upon which their anchor could hold .
__label__1	So I recommend you , as a friend , afore another half a blessed moment has passed over your head , to go and sit down upon that sofy . ''
__label__1	‘ <NAME> is with his sister now ! ’ It was the conception of an inspired moment , and she shot off with her utmost swiftness to work it out .
__label__1	For , it inscrutably appeared to stand to reason , in the minds of the whole company , that I was an excrescence on the entertainment .
__label__1	‘ Why , the truth is , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ that I have been out on a visit -- the first visit I have made for fifteen years. ’ ‘ That is a long time , ’ said <NAME> , sadly .
__label__1	‘ Then who knows but the gentleman , anticipating our objection to play for love , civilly desired to play for money ? ’ The old man replied by shaking the little purse in his eager hand , and then throwing it down upon the table , and gathering up the cards as a miser would clutch at gold .
__label__1	‘ If my brother <NAME> had consulted with me , which he sometimes does -- or rather , sometimes used to do ; for he will naturally do that no more now , and this is a circumstance which I regard as a relief from responsibility , ’ said <NAME> , hysterically , ‘ for I thank Heaven I am not jealous -- ’ here Mrs Chick again shed tears : ‘ if my brother <NAME> had come to me , and had said , “ Louisa , what kind of qualities would you advise me to look out for , in a wife ? ” I should certainly have answered , “ <NAME> , you must have family , you must have beauty , you must have dignity , you must have connexion. ” Those are the words I should have used .
__label__1	‘ Indeed , indeed , it is ! ’ ‘ That ’ s well ! -- and the waking -- ’ faltered the old man .
__label__1	He would shriek for help on the most improper occasions , -- as when we had a little dinner-party , or a few friends in the evening , -- and would come tumbling out of the kitchen , with iron missiles flying after him .
__label__1	As he is going to do so again , he happens to look at his coat-sleeve .
__label__0	`` If you have a nose left , '' answered <NAME> , `` you ought to be grateful to me . ''
__label__1	He had nearly got downstairs , when he stopped , and drew the key from his pocket .
__label__0	But his farewells were calmly spoken , and he speedily disappeared down a path which skirted the wood .
__label__1	<NAME> was very glad to see me , and told me that the house had not been like itself since I had left it .
__label__1	Still the <NAME> pointed downward to the grave by which it stood .
__label__0	A few days after came the 26th of March , the day on which , two years before , the castaways from the air had been thrown upon <NAME> .
__label__1	As he is not here , to-morrow will be time enough . '
__label__0	Redoubling his attention , he soon satisfied himself that what he saw was not a planet ; the rapidity of its displacement rather forced him to the conjecture that it must be a comet , and this opinion was soon strengthened by the appearance of a coma , and subsequently confirmed , as the body approached the sun , by the development of a tail .
__label__1	With a good deal more of that sort , which I wondered how they knew .
__label__1	I have no need to observe that I do not wilfully or negligently mislead my readers and that before I wrote that description I took pains to investigate the subject .
__label__1	The trade signs ( and they were almost as many as the shops ) were , all , grim illustrations of <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> at the expiration of the quarter of an hour , went down to breakfast .
__label__1	Keep me always at it , and I ’ ll keep you always at it , you keep somebody else always at it .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> entered ; we followed .
__label__1	‘ Depend upon it , it comes of thinking and dwelling on that dark spot. ’ ‘ Yes ; but why didn ’ t it come before ? ’ asked <NAME> .
__label__0	If the watch had neither lost or gained , it won the prize , which was in fact assigned to <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> , entrusted with carrying them their daily nourishment , leavings from the kitchen , etc. , acquitted himself conscientiously of his task .
__label__0	It appeared to be very deep , and , as it were , puffed out .
__label__0	But from this adventure he imbibed a more lively sentiment of fear with regard to brownies and other goblins who amuse themselves by plaguing mankind , and he made them responsible for the catastrophe of the <NAME> .
__label__1	You are a young gentleman to be smiled on , <NAME> , and you must learn your walue , sir. ’ Mrs. Crupp always called me <NAME> : firstly , no doubt , because it was not my name ; and secondly , I am inclined to think , in some indistinct association with a washing-day .
__label__0	However , <NAME> stated explicitly that <NAME> would be able to furnish information relating to the non-communicated chapters , and that he lived at <NAME> .
__label__1	Though I never knew what they were ( being in <NAME> ) , further than that they were highly eulogistic of the lineage of <NAME> ap-Kerrig .
__label__0	Then , besides the fat , which would insure for a long time a store of stearine and glycerine , there were still the bones , for which a use could doubtless be found , although there were neither umbrellas nor stays used at <NAME> .
__label__0	I have none ! ” “ You are in the midst of friends. ” “ Friends ! -- for me !
__label__0	They refused to return to <NAME> .
__label__1	In wild dreamlike procession , embracing whom they met and pointing him out , they carried him on .
__label__0	In a few words he explained it .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> fellow. ’ ‘ Oh , it ’ s worse than foolish ; it ’ s downright sneaking , you know , ’ replied <NAME> , nibbing the pen with a contemptuous face .
__label__1	That wasn ’ t his doing , so don ’ t lay it at his door. ’ ‘ Hold your tongue , you Jezebel , ’ said <NAME> , looking fearfully round .
__label__0	My uncle would simply have quoted the example of <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ God bless her ! ’ said my aunt , ‘ and her husband too ! ’ I echoed it , parted from my aunt , and went lightly downstairs , mounted , and rode away .
__label__1	' A nice person to prefer a charge against a poor boy ! '
__label__1	But , perhaps , she little thinks how I would retort upon her if I married her son .
__label__0	It was now exactly seven months since the balloon voyagers had been thrown on <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Oh , you prodigal old son !
__label__0	Round these principal thoroughfares is interwoven a perfect network of unpaved alleys , intersected every now and then by four canals , which are occasionally crossed by wooden bridges .
__label__0	“ At the first streak of day , the doctor aroused <NAME> .
__label__0	inquired the counsellor the same morning of the burgomaster .
__label__0	asked the sailors , turning to <NAME> .
__label__0	It is only a question of time. ” “ And how many months would be required to build a vessel of from 250 to 300 tons ? ” asked Harding .
__label__1	It ’ s a strange choice , I must say .
__label__0	It was on the 3rd of October , after a last and long conference , that <NAME> took leave of his colleagues to devote himself to his task .
__label__1	An unhealthy-looking boy , with warts all over his hands , stepped from his place to the master ’ s desk , and raised his eyes imploringly to <NAME> ’ s face ; his own , quite white from the rapid beating of his heart .
__label__0	However , I do n't fancy seeing them so much together .
__label__1	The Crisis of the <NAME> and its Result There are not many men who lie abed too late , or oversleep themselves , on their wedding morning .
__label__1	And yet she lay down , with nothing between her and the sky ; and , with no fear for herself , for she was past it now , put up a prayer for the poor old man .

__label__1	Ultimately I found myself backing <NAME> into the fireplace , and bowing in great confusion to two dry little elderly ladies , dressed in black , and each looking wonderfully like a preparation in chip or tan of the late <NAME> .
__label__1	I say , Sally , he is a yelping , insolent dog to all besides , and most of all , to me .
__label__0	<NAME> , always enthusiastic in his projects , already spoke of constructing a battery to command the channel and the mouth of the river .
__label__0	The brig now sailed in a sea which was almost entirely open .
__label__1	I am quite sure , if you will let me say so , that the object of your choice would greatly prefer to follow your fortunes far and wide , however moderate or poor , and see you happy , doing your duty and pursuing your chosen way , than to have the hope of being , or even to be , very rich with you ( if such a thing were possible ) at the cost of dragging years of procrastination and anxiety and of your indifference to other aims .
__label__0	No doubt he kindly remembers the world-wide sympathy with which our three famous travellers had started on their memorable trip to the <NAME> .
__label__1	It should be devoted to what promises a better return , and should be used where she has a larger stake .
__label__1	‘ That wouldn ’ t serve me. ’ ‘ Wouldn ’ t it ? ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	Here they obtained an ample supply of penguins for the crews of the five vessels -- a bird which did not make a very delicious meal .
__label__1	says the chief of that company , pointing to the village , 'bring him fast to his tomb ! '
__label__1	‘ Play ! ’ suddenly cried the bowler .
__label__1	It was the momentary yielding of a nature that had been disappointed from the dawn of its perceptions , but had not quite given up all its hopeful yearnings yet .
__label__1	In lieu of the endearments of childhood in its sweetest aspect , heap upon him all its pains and wants , its sicknesses and ills , its fretfulness , caprice , and querulous endurance : let its prattle be , not of engaging infant fancies , but of cold , and thirst , and hunger : and if his fatherly affection outlive all this , and he be patient , watchful , tender ; careful of his children ’ s lives , and mindful always of their joys and sorrows ; then send him back to <NAME> , and <NAME> , and to <NAME> , and when he hears fine talk of the depravity of those who live from hand to mouth , and labour hard to do it , let him speak up , as one who knows , and tell those holders forth that they , by parallel with such a class , should be <NAME> in their daily lives , and lay but humble siege to Heaven at last .
__label__0	The balloon clung to a tree , and his lamp again set it on fire .
__label__1	How do we come together—or so near together—so very unexpectedly ? ’ Unexpectedly indeed , among the dingy gables and chimney-pots of P. J. T. ’ s connection , and the flowers that had sprung from the salt sea .
__label__0	`` No , <NAME> , '' said the captain , `` no fear of that .
__label__1	<NAME> , do go away , for I am afraid of you .
__label__1	They allowed a very liberal table to <NAME> and Mrs. Pocket , yet it always appeared to me that by far the best part of the house to have boarded in would have been the kitchen , -- always supposing the boarder capable of self-defence , for , before I had been there a week , a neighboring lady with whom the family were personally unacquainted , wrote in to say that she had seen Millers slapping the baby .
__label__0	However , <NAME> ’ s convalescence progressed rapidly .
__label__1	He took the youngest child on his arm , where she was willing enough to be carried .
__label__0	Some moments after his continued bass supported the captain 's baritone .
__label__0	`` We shall return to-morrow , '' replied <NAME> , `` but it is necessary that I should go to the corral .
__label__0	The few houses here belong to foreigners .
__label__0	Moreover , the atmosphere was close , as if the oxygen had been partly burnt up , and had become unfit for respiration .
__label__1	It had no set beginning , as <NAME> , or <NAME> , or <NAME> , or <NAME> , but ran thus : -- “ I am to come to <NAME> the day after to-morrow by the midday coach .
__label__1	<NAME> ever stopped him in the street to say , with gladsome looks , `` My dear Scrooge , how are you ?
__label__0	‘ There is nothing you desire ? ’ ‘ Nothing. ’ ‘ You would not change your lot for that of a king ? ’ ‘ Never ! ’ ‘ Well , then , sell me your shirt. ’ ‘ My shirt !
__label__1	Peeping cautiously over the side of his hammock , he descried <NAME> , to whom , after contemplating her for some time in silence , he communicated a violent start by suddenly yelling out -- ‘ Halloa ! ’ ‘ Oh , <NAME> ! ’ cried his poor little wife , looking up .
__label__0	“ In 1881 Lieutenant <NAME> left <NAME> ’ s , <NAME> , in the steamer <NAME> , to establish a station on <NAME> , a little below the eighty-second degree .
__label__0	[ Illustration : Portrait of <NAME> .
__label__1	As he mounted , the call or song began to sound in his ears again , and , looking above , he saw the face of the little creature looking down out of a Glory of her long bright radiant hair , and musically repeating to him , like a vision : ‘ Come up and be dead !
__label__1	`` There is another point of view , '' he continues , `` in which the case presents itself .
__label__1	‘ He ’ s a bad ‘ un , ’ said <NAME> , wiping his eyes ; ‘ a very bad ‘ un , is schoolmeasther. ’ ‘ I can ’ t bear the sight of him , <NAME> , ’ said his wife .
__label__1	she ’ s more fashionable. ’ But between <NAME> and <NAME> there was this one difference , among many others , that <NAME> was in no danger of being captivated by <NAME> .
__label__1	And how different the parting with them was , from any she had expected , and most of all from that which she had oftenest pictured to herself .
__label__0	Now , as they had undoubtedly made at least about fourteen miles in the interval , it was evident that the ice on which they were was being drifted southwards by a strong current .
__label__0	The travellers succeeded in making fast to a tree , and , the wind having fallen calm toward evening , they remained quietly at anchor .
__label__1	The probability of his ever doing so , appeared to me , when I saw him , to be very small .
__label__1	‘ We have only met each other once before , you know .
__label__0	But one chance remained -- to seek a shelter on the southern side of the coast .
__label__1	`` There can be no more favourable time than the present , <NAME> , '' says <NAME> after they have broodingly made out the four sides of the square , `` for a word or two between us upon a point on which we must , with very little delay , come to an understanding . ''
__label__1	The kinchin lay will be a fortune to you . '
__label__0	<NAME> was therefore in a condition singularly favorable to resolve the great question concerning the <NAME> 's inhabitableness .
__label__1	‘ I did , ’ said the son ; and he proceeded to relate , in as few words as possible , how he had fallen a ready dupe to the stratagems of <NAME> .
__label__1	I thought I might as well keep them to myself as have them swallowed up alive too ; so I kept them in a box , looking over them when I felt in the humour .
__label__0	In fact , the first cornfield sown with a single grain had prospered admirably , thanks to <NAME> 's care .
__label__1	Bother your people ! ’ interposed <NAME> , with a toss of her head .
__label__0	Where formerly sprang up that charming verdure , the soil was now nothing but a savage mass of volcanic tufa .
__label__0	If we are well informed , the point of departure for this surprising journey is to be the island of <NAME> , upon the eastern coast .
__label__1	I was certain of it .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> is then presented with his meed of acknowledgment by the husband of his lovely and accomplished relative , and <NAME> and <NAME> retire , leaving that husband to the world again , and to ponder at leisure on their representation of its state of mind concerning his affairs , and on its just and reasonable expectations .
__label__0	`` Do you know <NAME> ? ''
__label__1	Even when , at last , I had knocked , and was waiting at the door , I had some flurried thought of asking if that were <NAME> ’ s ( in imitation of poor <NAME> ) , begging pardon , and retreating .
__label__0	And when <NAME> , undaunted by his jeers , persevered in besetting him with questions , he tried to silence him by saying , “ Only wait till the governor general comes ; he is a shrewd fellow , and will tell you all about it. ” “ But will he protect my property ? ” poor Isaac would ask tremulously .
__label__1	<NAME> walked forth , elated with the scene ; and all was brightness and splendour .
__label__1	His door was opened , and the head of the elder <NAME> was put in a very little way , without being turned towards him .
__label__1	Now , besides very many babies just able to walk , there happened to be in <NAME> a considerable population of babies who had been walking against time towards the infinite world , twenty , thirty , forty , fifty years and more .
__label__0	This was a fertile tract of country inhabited by a civilized , upright people , who loved all philosophic researches .
__label__1	' I tell you they 'll never open it .
__label__0	But his desire to wait till the very last moment , so as to get the very best price for the document he possessed , the recollection of the young man ’ s insulting words , and the hate which he bore to all that belonged to him , made him forget his own interest .
__label__1	Drownded , ain ’ t he ? ’ Concluding his apostrophe with this abrupt appeal to <NAME> , the <NAME> bade her good-night , and descended the stairs , while <NAME> remained at the top , holding the candle out to light him down .
__label__0	exclaimed <NAME> , seriously ; `` have we not the same weight everywhere ? ''
__label__0	`` You are in a great hurry , then ? ''
__label__1	The leg of mutton came up very red within , and very pale without : besides having a foreign substance of a gritty nature sprinkled over it , as if if had had a fall into the ashes of that remarkable kitchen fireplace .
__label__1	My dear Dora , unless we learn to do our duty to those whom we employ , they will never learn to do their duty to us .
__label__1	`` Do n't lose your temper as well as your money , '' says <NAME> , calmly knocking the ashes out of his pipe .
__label__1	‘ This here little Em ’ ly of ours , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ has been , in our house , what I suppose ( I ’ m a ignorant man , but that ’ s my belief ) no one but a little bright-eyed creetur can be in a house .
__label__0	We will now put on our dresses , and begin our walk . ''
__label__1	He always sat in a particular corner , on a particular stool , which was called ‘ <NAME> ’ , after him ; here he would sit , with his grey head bent forward , attentively listening to whatever might be going on , with a profound veneration for the learning he had never been able to acquire .
__label__1	‘ I assure you , ’ said <NAME> , taking his arm , ‘ that I think myself very lucky they did not owe all the money instead of being sixpence short .
__label__0	The latter had recovered his presence of mind .
__label__1	But I do n't know that I am in love with him -- yet . ''
__label__1	And yet I have exactly the same objection to both of them. ’ ‘ Oh , <NAME> ! ’ retorted <NAME> , as if she were giving him up for a bad job , as she used to give up herself .
__label__1	That ’ s what I feel so strong , you know !
__label__1	‘ What I particularly request <NAME> to be careful of , is , ’ said Mrs. Micawber , ‘ that he does not , my dear <NAME> , in applying himself to this subordinate branch of the law , place it out of his power to rise , ultimately , to the top of the tree .
__label__1	I am not the dirt under <NAME> ’ s feet , yet -- not quite yet , ’ said <NAME> , as if she expected to become so , about the day after to-morrow .
__label__1	They took a lodging in the house where I lived , for a week ; at the expiration of which time they were to start for <NAME> .
__label__1	( Our Chancery phrases , my love . )
__label__1	If he takes and says , “ Maggy , you hurry away and back with that letter , and you shall have a sixpence if the answer ’ s a good ‘ un , ” I must take it .
__label__1	From him , ’ she said , with a laugh .
__label__1	“ My memory is still accurate , but I can not write the words of our conversation .
__label__1	You were to have universal concord , and were to get it by eliminating all the people who wouldn ’ t , or conscientiously couldn ’ t , be concordant .
__label__1	Has this letter any connexion with dear little <NAME> ?
__label__0	What they were nobody else seemed to know , and he seemed to be in no hurry to tell .
__label__0	<NAME> is ended -- the hours no longer strike -- the hands have stopped ! ''
__label__1	He would do nothing to make it a desperate venture , and he had very little fear of his safety with such good help .
__label__1	‘ Now , <NAME> , ’ said the <NAME> , so sharply rapping the table to bespeak his attention as <NAME> turned the leaves of her book , that she started ; ‘ where were we ? ’ ‘ You were saying , sir , ’ returned the Secretary , with an air of some reluctance and a glance towards those others who were present , ‘ that you considered the time had come for fixing my salary. ’ ‘ Don ’ t be above calling it wages , man , ’ said Mr Boffin , testily .
__label__1	<NAME> ha ha ha ha ! ’ Mrs <NAME> clapped her hands again , rocked herself again , beat her feet upon the floor , and wiped the tears of laughter from her eyes .
__label__1	You will understand , then , that when your dear friend complimented me , he really condoled with me ; that when he soothed me under my vexations , he laid bare every smarting wound I had ; that when he declared my ‘ faithful swain ’ to be ‘ the most loving young fellow in the world , with the tenderest heart that ever beat , ’ he touched my old misgiving that I was made ridiculous .
__label__0	From that day I noticed with uneasiness that <NAME> 's ill-will towards <NAME> increased , and I resolved to watch the <NAME> 's gestures closely .
__label__0	`` He looks as if he was just going to grin ! ''
__label__1	The nature even of the mild men got corrupted , either from their curdling it with too much lemonade , or from the general inoculation that prevailed ; and they made sarcastic jokes to one another , and whispered disparagement on stairs and in bye-places .
__label__1	There was a flowery carpet on the floor ; but , instead of reaching to the fireside , its glowing vegetation stopped short at <NAME> ’ s footstool , and gave place to a region of sand and sawdust .
__label__1	I was on the wrong side of the post .
__label__1	She ’ s far away , she ’ s far away !
__label__1	Yet it inspired him with an inward fortitude , that rose with his love .
__label__1	He will certainly help us to a new livelihood .
__label__0	She seized <NAME> 's arm and gently pulled him back .
__label__1	`` Settled in the law , '' said I .
__label__0	it appears to me the danger is over. ” “ And our comrades at the far end of the works -- what about them ? ” cried some of the miners .
__label__1	‘ I saw nothing of him , ’ answered <NAME> ; ‘ but I saw that dear old soul <NAME> Linkinwater. ’ ‘ Taking his evening walk , and coming on to rest here , before he turns back to the city , I ’ ll be bound ! ’ said Mrs. Nickleby .
__label__0	In another instant our feet trod the bottom of the sea .
__label__0	Therefore , whether from the windows of <NAME> , or from <NAME> , <NAME> and <NAME> , when they were not hunting , or <NAME> , unless presiding over his fires , never left the telescope , but watched all the animal ’ s movements .
__label__0	There was only the longitude to be obtained , and the position of the island would be determined , The engineer hoped to attempt this the same day , at twelve o ’ clock , at which moment the sun would pass the meridian .
__label__0	That point was reached on the 3rd of March , and thence the coast was continuously followed , as it led through what had been <NAME> , across the province of <NAME> , away to the oasis of <NAME> ; where , taking a sharp turn , it first reached a latitude of 32 degrees , and then returned again , thus forming a sort of irregular gulf , enclosed by the same unvarying border of mineral concrete .
__label__0	Saying which , he offered some water to the wounded dog , who swallowed it with avidity .
__label__0	One day , after having admitted that , with an overwhelming run of good-luck , there MIGHT be one chance of success in a thousand , he pretended to yield entirely to the doctor ’ s wishes ; but , in order to still put off the journey , he opened the most varied series of subterfuges .
__label__0	They advanced quietly without showing any uneasiness , and gazed at the men , in whom they could not as yet recognize their future masters .
__label__1	Oliver reached the stile at which the by-path terminated ; and once more gained the high-road .
__label__1	The woman sits beside him , very attentive to the pipe , which is all the while at his lips .
__label__1	<NAME> in <NAME> Doctor <NAME> did not return until the morning of the fourth day of his absence .
__label__1	said a little ugly hump-backed man : opening the door so suddenly , that the doctor , from the very impetus of his last kick , nearly fell forward into the passage .
__label__1	But I felt that the kiss was given to the coarse common boy as a piece of money might have been , and that it was worth nothing .
__label__1	There is no such place in that part now ; but it remained there for many years , looking with a baulked countenance at the wilderness patched with unfruitful gardens and pimpled with eruptive summerhouses , that it had meant to run over in no time .
__label__0	This residence is called `` The abode of pleasant freshness , '' and the park surrounding it is named the `` Garden of innumerable trees . ''
__label__0	Thus the subscribers not only hear the news but see the occurrences .
__label__1	Both have come upon me by surprise. ’ ‘ But , <NAME> ’ otherest Governor , ’ urged Mr Riderhood , ‘ I don ’ t know where to find you. ’ ‘ It is of no consequence .
__label__0	`` In the steward 's room , I suppose , '' returned the mate , without stirring .
__label__1	What between the buryin ground , the grocer ’ s , the waggon-stables , and the paunch trade , the <NAME> flies gets very large .
__label__1	He was soon calmed and fell asleep , singing to himself in a low voice , like a little child .
__label__1	The appearances , beyond all rational doubt , observed in that case are the appearances observed in <NAME> 's case .
__label__0	The requisite precautions were taken for the night , and <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> and <NAME> undertook in turn to keep watch until sunrise .
__label__0	The expedition directed by M. d ’ Escayrac de <NAME> made an equally unsuccessful attempt to reach the famous sources of the Nile .
__label__1	`` We thought that , perhaps , '' said I , hesitating , `` it is right to begin with the obligations of home , sir ; and that , perhaps , while those are overlooked and neglected , no other duties can possibly be substituted for them . ''
__label__1	Her mother watching her , and not him , remained silent ; until her kindling glance subsided , and she drew a long breath , as if in the relief of his being gone .
__label__0	Either the explorers had strayed from the right path on their return , or the narrow orifice , broken in the rock by the dynamite , had been recently stopped up .
__label__1	It might be more according to the rights of things , to say Two-thirds ; it might be more according to the rights of things , to say Three-fourths .
__label__0	`` But , '' asked <NAME> , `` sha ' n't we lose them if we go back without the captain ? ''
__label__1	‘ I hope they are , ’ said <NAME> , fixing his eyes upon his friend .
__label__1	<NAME> fell upon the ground but a few particles of froth , which slowly detached themselves from the rim , and trickled lazily down .
__label__0	<NAME> meanwhile had advanced into much deeper water with far less floating ice , and had met with a great many Esquimaux of mild and hospitable manners .
__label__1	Let us see the state of the case .
__label__1	‘ What ! ’ said Mr Carker , who had heard this .
__label__1	And you needn ’ t nudge him , Mr <NAME> , for I know your work begins early tomorrow , and I say the same to you .
__label__1	‘ What ’ s the t ’ other name ? ’ said <NAME> , looking round .
__label__0	`` As a whaler I have followed many a cetacean , harpooned a great number , and killed several ; but , however strong or well-armed they may have been , neither their tails nor their weapons would have been able even to scratch the iron plates of a steamer . ''
__label__0	A great fire had been lighted , and its lurid glow threw into strong relief the irregular outlines of the “ pah. ” Some of the savages were sitting round the brazier ; the others standing motionless , their black outlines relieved against the clear background of flame .
__label__1	The man with the rough voice was a burly fellow of middle age , with large black whiskers , broad cheeks , a coarse wide mouth , and bull neck , which was pretty freely displayed as his shirt collar was only confined by a loose red neckerchief .
__label__1	‘ Only his playfulness , gen ’ lm ’ n , ’ said the head hostler encouragingly ; ‘ jist kitch hold on him , Villiam. ’ The deputy restrained the animal ’ s impetuosity , and the principal ran to assist <NAME> in mounting .
__label__1	Your beer will be the worse for to-night ’ s thunder I expect. -- Game !
__label__0	The three friends looked and listened without speaking , and scarcely breathing .
__label__1	“ As I am at home myself , ” said <NAME> , “ I 'll go upstairs. ” Although the <NAME> 's daughter had known nothing of the country of her birth , she appeared to have innately derived from it that ability to make much of little means , which is one of its most useful and most agreeable characteristics .
__label__0	The pigeon-house was twice unroofed and the paling blown down .
__label__1	<NAME> has no such advantage .
__label__0	M. de <NAME> engaged as private secretary a professor , the <NAME> Jean-Baptiste Le Chevalier , who spoke <NAME> fluently .
__label__1	‘ And who , ’ said <NAME> , shuffling among his papers , ‘ who is the lodger ’ s visitor -- not a lady visitor , I hope , eh , Mr <NAME> ?
__label__0	Should chance bring the <NAME> ’ s courier into <NAME> ’ s presence , the latter could not fail to recognize in him the traveler whom he had so brutally treated at the <NAME> post-house , and although <NAME> had not replied to the insult as he would have done under any other circumstances , attention would be drawn to him , and at once the accomplishment of his plans would be rendered more difficult .
__label__1	' I would not for the world , sir , ' replied <NAME> .
__label__1	Before we go , I should like to speak to him a moment .
__label__0	The provisions , which <NAME> had already packed up , consisted of a store of meat and of several gallons of beer , that is to say , enough to sustain them for three days , the time which <NAME> assigned for the expedition .
__label__0	Some 600 priests are attached to its service , and comfortable dwellings are provided for them out of the voluntary contributions of the devotees who visit the temple .
__label__1	<NAME> of Mr <NAME> ’ s house , and serving about his person , <NAME> kept his round eyes on the white teeth with fear and trembling , and felt that he had need to open them wider than ever .
__label__1	Where have you hidden her ? ’ Showing that he was taken by surprise , the old man looked at his master with some passing confusion , which the master highly enjoyed .
__label__1	<NAME> Jasper proving willing to speak for Mrs. Tope , <NAME> , who had sent up his card , was invited to ascend the postern staircase .
__label__0	Now , what was the use of these two maneuvers , unless the vessel had been employed in some expedition ?
__label__1	`` His successor informed me of it yesterday , '' said <NAME> .
__label__0	She saw him draw himself towards his mother , bend over her , kiss her forehead , then rise and grope his way in flight .
__label__1	On being asked by a mild boy ( not me ) how he would proceed if he did begin to see him do it , he dipped a match into his phosphorus-box on purpose to shed a glare over his reply , and said he would commence by knocking him down with a blow on the forehead from the seven-and-sixpenny ink-bottle that was always on the mantelpiece .
__label__1	I don ’ t think he can be worse. ’ The child asked his leave to prepare breakfast , and her grandfather coming down stairs , they all three partook of it together .
__label__1	The solicitors ’ wives , and the wine-merchant ’ s wife , headed another grade ( the brewer ’ s wife visited the <NAME> ) ; and Mrs. <NAME> , the post- office keeper , seemed by mutual consent to have been chosen the leader of the trade party .
__label__1	Among the loungers under the <NAME> 's archway happened to be <NAME> 's Boy , -- true to his ancient habit of happening to be everywhere where he had no business , -- and <NAME> 's boy had seen me passing from <NAME> 's in the direction of my dining-place .
__label__1	Having nothing to learn now , he thought of this frequently ; though not so often as he might have done , if he had had fewer things to think of .
__label__0	It was , therefore , fixed that the average journey every day should not be more than from twenty-five to thirty miles .
__label__1	No ; I repudiate the title !
__label__0	[ Illustration ] During that day the <NAME> made easy progress through the loose ice ; the breeze was in a good quarter , but the temperature was very low ; the wind coming across the ice-fields was thoroughly chilled .
__label__1	It was evident that the three daughters had grown up as they could and had had just as little haphazard instruction as qualified them to be their father 's playthings in his idlest hours .
__label__0	Can there be a doubt from their shape that the bite is the bite of a crocodile ?
__label__0	By the God of <NAME> !
__label__1	‘ Is there no refuge for young criminals in <NAME> , then ? ’ said I .
__label__1	‘ It has come back upon me to-day , it has all come back since we have been sitting here .
__label__0	how many of these valuable evidences of the bravery and spirit of enterprise of the <NAME> race are for ever buried under the glaciers !
__label__1	As she could not explain , however , she bowed her head and thanked him ; and again she thought that the dull home , free from such embarrassments , and such reminders of her sorrow , was her natural and best retreat .
__label__0	He pitched his camp on the banks of the <NAME> ( <NAME> ) river and made many very successful hunting excursions in a district rich in game , finally reaching <NAME> , where the howls of innumerable hyenas frightened the oxen .
__label__0	“ Yes , my <NAME> ; <NAME> ’ s quartermaster. ” “ And saved with him after the shipwreck ? ” “ No , my Lord , no .
__label__1	Her gentle ringing at the bell was responded to by a dolorous-looking woman , of light complexion , with raised eyebrows , and head drooping on one side , who curtseyed at sight of her , and conducted her across the garden to the house .
__label__0	“ If I wish it ! ” exclaimed <NAME> .
__label__0	`` But -- in short -- this purchase of wood -- '' `` And you shall be at the wedding , '' replied <NAME> , interrupting the merchant , and shaking his hand as if he would crush it .
__label__1	We stand around the grave .
__label__1	You know <NAME> , the <NAME> , across the lane .
__label__1	I look from <NAME> , in his Sunday neckcloth , to the pulpit ; and think what a good place it would be to play in , and what a castle it would make , with another boy coming up the stairs to attack it , and having the velvet cushion with the tassels thrown down on his head .
__label__0	“ I treat you with water , ” he said .
__label__0	<NAME> , like his master , kept coming and going , enduring every fatigue , always alert , finding out by himself the best path ; they had perfect confidence in his wonderful instinct .
__label__1	He had heard of <NAME> , at the posting-houses , as being before him .
__label__1	<NAME> , they come at last into the hall , where a lamp is burning , and so into <NAME> 's usual room -- the room where he drank his old wine to-night .
__label__1	He called for the lady ’ s maid , and roared for the doctor ; and then , rushing into the yard , kicked the two Lincoln greens who were the most used to it , and cursing the others all round , bade them go -- but never mind where .
__label__1	‘ It ’ s quite an accident. ’ ‘ So much the better , <NAME> ; these accidental parties are always the pleasantest , ’ said the dwarf , rubbing his hands so hard that he seemed to be engaged in manufacturing , of the dirt with which they were encrusted , little charges for popguns .
__label__1	How long did you stay there ? ’ ‘ About ten minutes ; I should say not more .
__label__0	<NAME> sent several times to inquire after the unfortunate servant 's health , but he was not deceived by these demonstrations of interest , for he knew they were only dictated by a wish to get possession of the traveller 's baggage , which was supposed to be full of gold and silver .
__label__1	The connection between the two places was by a hilly turnpike-road , and the travelling on that road was very slow .
__label__1	Is it a bargain , or is it not ? ’ <NAME> pushed some papers from him as he spoke , and carelessly rattled his cash-box , as though by mere accident .
__label__1	' I am , ' said the girl earnestly .
__label__0	However , the raft had reached the middle of the river , about half a mile from the starting point .
__label__1	‘ But you don ’ t know , ’ said I , ‘ that <NAME> was charitable to her , with <NAME> ’ s help , long before she fled from home .
__label__0	`` I can well believe it , '' said <NAME> .
__label__1	But all these tokens of past grandeur were miserably decayed and dirty ; rot , damp , and age , had weakened the flooring , which in many places was unsound and even unsafe .
__label__1	‘ My boy has been preserved and thrives , ’ says old <NAME> , rubbing his hands .
__label__1	If I have known <NAME> a year , to move to as he went by , I have known him forty years .
__label__0	He remained there a year , devoting himself to the practical study of the <NAME> tongue , making extracts from <NAME> historians and geographers , verifying the astronomical position of <NAME> , prosecuting his investigations into natural history , collecting manuscripts , and translating many of those popular songs and legends which are such valuable aids to the knowledge of a nation .
__label__1	When the last ‘ natural ’ had been declared , and the profit and loss account of fish and sixpences adjusted , to the satisfaction of all parties , <NAME> rang for supper , and the visitors squeezed themselves into corners while it was getting ready .
__label__1	'We want to sleep here to-night . '
__label__0	The monster did exist , and he had sworn to rid the seas of it .
__label__0	A too common instance this of ingratitude , but one which it is never _mal à propos_ to stigmatize as it deserves .
__label__1	This <NAME> does with great discretion , appearing to address himself to <NAME> , but having an eye solely on the old girl all the time , as <NAME> has himself .
__label__1	And she has come back , a most beautiful and most elegant creature .
__label__0	<NAME> & Co. were quite <NAME> enough to take care of their own country .
__label__0	71 The beginning of his maritime career -- The command of the <NAME> entrusted to him -- Tierra del Fuego -- Discovery of some islands in the <NAME> -- <NAME> at <NAME> -- Manners and Customs of the inhabitants -- Discovery of other islands in the <NAME> group -- <NAME> off <NAME> -- Interview with the natives -- Discovery of <NAME> 's <NAME> -- Circumnavigation of two large islands -- Manners of the people and productions of the country .
__label__1	The two travelled all night , except when they were left , for odd numbers of minutes , at branch-places , up illimitable flights of steps , or down wells—which was the only variety of those branches—and , early in the morning , were turned out on a swamp , a mile or two from the town they sought .
__label__0	It is more difficult than one would suppose for a captain to maintain perfect calmness and impassiveness in the midst of the worst dangers , even those he has reason to imagine likely to be fatal . ''
__label__1	He keeps them on shelves over his head , and will weigh them all .
__label__1	My husband drew a little nearer towards <NAME> , and I saw him solemnly lift up his hand to warn my guardian .
__label__1	‘ I can not disguise from you , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , knitting his brow , ‘ that the result of your probation there has disappointed me ; has greatly disappointed me .
__label__1	I am so beset and hemmed in , that they are not only all struck with fear , but , like the beasts in the fable , have their fling at me now , though time was , and no longer ago than yesterday too , when they were all civility and compliance .
__label__1	I was up very early in the morning and called <NAME> to come for a walk .
__label__0	<NAME> , like industry , is transformed and altered .
__label__1	She was afraid to look at him much , after the offence he had taken ; but she noticed two occasions in the course of his meal , when he all of a sudden looked at her , and looked about him , as if the association were so strong that he needed assurance from his sense of sight that they were not in the old prison-room .
__label__1	I regret to leave you , and more to leave her , now , but I will not encourage this compound of meanness and cruelty , and , as I will not ask you to renounce him , I see you no more. ’ If <NAME> had not known and felt his power in wounding those he hated , his glances at <NAME> would have shown it him , in all its force , as he proceeded in the above address .
__label__1	<NAME> , pray , be cautious ! ” cried <NAME> .
__label__1	`` But that is a long time .
__label__1	I was young , I was accomplished , I was good-looking , I was independent -- by God I was , child ! -- and people sought me out , and envied me .
__label__1	What a launch in life I think it now , on looking back , to be so mean and servile to a man of such parts and pretensions !
__label__0	to 147 degrees 15 minutes E .
__label__0	“ I ’ ve a notion ! ” exclaimed <NAME> , “ that this vessel will be difficult to get afloat again. ” “ It will be impossible , ” said <NAME> .
__label__0	Here , with what delight we can easily imagine , he found letters from <NAME> awaiting him .
__label__1	<NAME> night , good night ! ” We thought it best that he should stay in his own rooms ; and we left him on the landing outside his door , holding a light over the stair-rail to light us downstairs .
__label__0	We then entered the audience-chamber , and after a conversation of a quarter of an hour , I took my leave , and was conducted back with the same ceremonies . ''
__label__1	‘ I must go home , ’ replied <NAME> , looking wildly round .
__label__0	112 A Fa-toka , <NAME> .
__label__1	I believe I was kept at home for that purpose .
__label__0	Every one felt more and more puzzled , and even excited , for with the turn of the tide the <NAME> was to set sail for its unknown destination .
__label__0	`` Because generally there is a periodic frost in the month of May , and the greatest fall of temperature takes place from the 11th to the 13th of this month .
__label__0	“ Come what may , ” he presently exclaimed , “ we will make up our minds for the future to be surprised at nothing. ” “ Right , captain , ” replied <NAME> ; “ and , first of all , let us settle our little score with <NAME> Timascheff. ” Beyond the ditch lay a small piece of meadow land , about an acre in extent .
__label__1	In the afternoon of the next day , my old nurse and I went down to <NAME> .
__label__0	The only liquid provided by my uncle was <NAME> .
__label__0	Then another day passed without food .
__label__1	<NAME> after passage did he explore ; room after room did he peep into ; at length , as he was on the point of giving up the search in despair , he opened the door of the identical room in which he had spent the evening , and beheld his missing property on the table .
__label__1	How -- or perhaps I should rather say where -- IS <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Not here , ’ Mrs <NAME> proclaimed , with folded arms .
__label__1	Upon the whole , the sweet greatly preponderated over the bitter , so Miss Squeers said she would get the frock made , and that she hoped ‘ Tilda might be happy , though at the same time she didn ’ t know , and would not have her build too much upon it , for men were strange creatures , and a great many married women were very miserable , and wished themselves single again with all their hearts ; to which condolences <NAME> added others equally calculated to raise her friend ’ s spirits and promote her cheerfulness of mind .
__label__1	Now Mr Headstone , as Mr <NAME> has been obliged to hear what I had to say , and couldn ’ t help himself , and as I have said it out to the last word , we have done all we wanted to do , and may go. ’ ‘ Go down-stairs , and leave me a moment , <NAME> , ’ he returned .
__label__1	It was a subject of which the affectionate creature never tired ; and our interest in hearing the many examples which she , who was so much with him , had to relate , was equal to hers in relating them .
__label__1	‘ If I were not a married man myself , I should be disposed to envy you , you dog. ’ Thus expressing himself , the little lawyer gave <NAME> a poke in the chest , which that gentleman reciprocated ; after which they both laughed very loudly , but not so loudly as <NAME> , who had just relieved his feelings by kissing the pretty housemaid under cover of the cupboard door .
__label__0	The same ceremonies were observed every time the captain landed .
__label__0	And now the pieces were as brilliant as if they had been on board a frigate of the <NAME> .
__label__1	They were much soiled , but otherwise unhurt .
__label__0	I have done with society entirely , for reasons which I alone have the right of appreciating .
__label__0	Four others proceeded to a favourable distance from the fort , where <NAME> himself proposed to await the transit of the planet .
__label__0	<NAME> to his word , the captain next morning arrived at the tartan .
__label__1	‘ Do you know nothing of a woman ’ s anger ? ’ ‘ You have a saucy tongue , <NAME> , ’ said Mr Dombey .
__label__1	Though always somewhat formal , in his dress , in imitation of the great man whom he served , he stopped short of the extent of Mr <NAME> ’ s stiffness : at once perhaps because he knew it to be ludicrous , and because in doing so he found another means of expressing his sense of the difference and distance between them .
__label__1	When I think of my past follies , and my present state , I am sure it would be best for you .
__label__1	My unhappy mother told me that in my illness she had been nearly frantic .
__label__1	But tell me his name , deary ! ’ cried <NAME> .
__label__1	I didn ’ t dare to warn him , and advise him ; but if I had seen direct cause , I would have shown him my example .
__label__0	`` Can the divers readily reach such depths ? ''
__label__0	`` When the cooling of its crust shall have made it uninhabitable . ''
__label__0	In this all <NAME> ’ s ability was shown , and he was admirably seconded by his crew .
__label__1	Its other name was <NAME> ; which is <NAME> , or <NAME> , or <NAME> , or all three -- or all one to me -- for enough. ” “ Enough <NAME> , ” said I ; “ that 's a curious name , miss. ” “ Yes , ” she replied ; “ but it meant more than it said .
__label__0	<NAME> could scarcely be otherwise than an object of terror to the inhabitants of the earth , who could by no means be certain that a second collision would be comparatively so harmless as the first .
__label__1	My friend <NAME> has not fixed the positive remuneration at too high a figure , but he has made a great deal , in the way of extrication from the pressure of pecuniary difficulties , contingent on the value of my services ; and on the value of those services I pin my faith .
__label__0	The incessant flashes of lightning took various forms .
__label__1	This person wore a wig of short , coarse , red hair , which he took off with his hat , and hung upon a nail .
__label__1	“ Now , ” said <NAME> , gliding away the instant I touched her cheek , “ you are to take care that I have some tea , and you are to take me to Richmond. ” Her reverting to this tone as if our association were forced upon us , and we were mere puppets , gave me pain ; but everything in our intercourse did give me pain .
__label__1	'Do you mean to say anything , you young shaver ? '
__label__0	said <NAME> , `` these beasts can turn themselves over , then ? ''
__label__1	This time she really is going to speak to him .
__label__1	Ada being in our room with a cold , <NAME> was left alone all this time and entertained himself by playing snatches of pathetic airs and sometimes singing to them ( as we heard at a distance ) with great expression and feeling .
__label__1	Three o ’ clock , and half-past three , and they had passed over <NAME> .
__label__1	But we are made fast alongside the packet , whose huge red funnel is smoking bravely , giving rich promise of serious intentions .
__label__1	I must not hear of such a sacrifice .
__label__0	Some officers were already perched on the mast-heads .
__label__0	`` They have been gone ten days , '' said <NAME> at last .
__label__1	As he looked , he saw her for an instant by a clearer and a brighter light , not bending over that child ’ s pillow as his rival -- monstrous thought -- but as the spirit of his home , and in the action tending himself no less , as he sat once more with his bowed-down head upon his hand at the foot of the little bed .
__label__1	We might have been a party of <NAME> , the conversation assumed such a sanguine complexion .
__label__0	O blessed refuge , unassailable by aught of human ills !
__label__0	She was a pretty <NAME> girl , with some <NAME> blood in her veins .
__label__0	<NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , the whole world belongs to the <NAME> .
__label__0	At the exact minute he had indicated , we were again launched on high with extreme rapidity .
__label__0	The unhappy man was condemned to be blinded .
__label__0	I am simply going to take you up above these clouds that are now deluging us , and remove you from this pestilential atmosphere .
__label__0	After its departure from <NAME> the jangada did not stop anywhere as it passed down the much less encumbered course of the <NAME> .
__label__0	The rajah and his relatives wore caps of various colours , adorned with precious stones .
__label__0	`` I congratulate you , '' replied <NAME> .
__label__1	But her affectionate nature was so happy in what I now said to her with my whole heart , that her face became a laughing one before her glittering eyes were dry .
__label__1	I do not go with Mrs. Jellyby in her treatment of her young family .
__label__0	Tents were immediately prepared for the sufferers from scurvy .
__label__1	'Why , if he did n't mind -- ' observed Fagin .
__label__0	The satisfaction of having gained several hundreds of dollars is already lessened , and the prospect of gaining a few more hundreds does not put a stop to disputes .
__label__1	<NAME> replies that `` all them are , '' and further that in all , for months and months , the people `` have been down by dozens '' and have been carried out dead and dying `` like sheep with the rot . ''
__label__1	<NAME> goes into various shops and parlours , examining the inhabitants , always shutting the door first , and by exclusion , delay , and general idiotcy exasperating the public .
__label__1	When she fell asleep in the little armchair by the high fender , the turnkey would cover her with his pocket-handkerchief ; and when she sat in it dressing and undressing a doll which soon came to be unlike dolls on the other side of the lock , and to bear a horrible family resemblance to Mrs Bangham -- he would contemplate her from the top of his stool with exceeding gentleness .
__label__0	But <NAME> loved it ; the pastime was congenial to his temperament .
__label__1	I ’ ll not ask you , with your remembrance of my house and all belonging to it , whether you believe it .
__label__0	To save our boy you have risked your life ! ” “ My life ! ” murmured the stranger .
__label__0	Let this first time you have come to treat of this subject be the last , for a second time I will not listen to you . ''
__label__1	Yet , in spite of his early promise , all this vigilance and care could not make little Paul a thriving boy .
__label__0	All the fires must be extinguished , so that nothing may betray the presence of men on the island . ''
__label__1	As if her life were an enchanted vision , there arose out of her solitude ministering thoughts , that made it fanciful and unreal .
__label__0	Although the lands bought of the Indians were far from being all occupied , the <NAME> colonists continued to push their way inland , at the risk of encounters with the legitimate owners of the soil .
__label__1	His words at the time ( I was then an infant , but so deep was their impression on me , that I committed them to memory ) were : Then farewell my trim-built wherry , <NAME> and coat and badge farewell !
__label__0	Even these petty ills of life could not ruffle the <NAME> ’ s equanimity ; but <NAME> , on the contrary , was perfectly exasperated by such trifling annoyances .
__label__1	At the foot of a flight of steps , leading to the house door , which was guarded on either side by an <NAME> aloe in a green tub , the sedan- chair stopped .
__label__1	If I could only fold you in my arms , and squeeze your ribs , as I COULD squeeze them if I once had you tight -- what a meeting there would be between us !
__label__1	My name 's <NAME> , as you are aware , and I have got a peace-warrant against <NAME> .
__label__0	The flaring torches began to grow dim .
__label__0	`` We require only fresh victuals and fresh water , Mr .
__label__1	The darkness found him occupied with these thoughts .
__label__1	Mrs. Chadband , more than ready , so advances as to jostle her husband into the background and confronts <NAME> with a hard , frowning smile .
__label__1	said Mrs. Bagnet , continuing to grumble on good-humouredly .
__label__0	Their confidence was greater after than before `` the incident of the algebra . ''
__label__1	I am already quite an old bachelor. ” <NAME> looked down at her child , and put its little hand to her lips , and then put the good matronly hand with which she had touched it into mine .
__label__0	The hostile demonstrations of the natives prevented the _Endeavour_ from remaining .
__label__1	Thus , a wounded prince or bandit chief , who is bleeding to death and too faint to move , except to the softest music ( and then only upon his hands and knees ) , shall be seen to approach a cottage door for aid in such a series of writhings and twistings , and with such curlings up of the legs , and such rollings over and over , and such gettings up and tumblings down again , as could never be achieved save by a very strong man skilled in posture-making .
__label__0	On the 15th June , 1783 , he started at the head of a caravan numbering nineteen persons .
__label__0	We shall start in a minute or two .
__label__1	Mr <NAME> ’ s face was not a changeful one , and being cast in its mould of state that day , showed little other apprehension of the story , if any , than that which he expressed when he said solemnly , amidst the silence , that it was ‘ Very good. ’ There was a rapid glance from <NAME> towards <NAME> , but otherwise she remained , externally , impassive and unconscious .
__label__0	I should very much like to see how they teach geography in the <NAME> of Melbourne. ” “ And suppose Toline trips you up , <NAME> ! ” said <NAME> .
__label__0	My uncle and the guide made no effort to save themselves .
__label__0	Once or twice more he spoke to the colonists who stood around him , and smiled on them with that last smile which continues after death .
__label__0	all was explained , everything -- except the presence of the torpedo in the waters of the channel !
__label__1	For what 's a door-chain when she 's got one always up ?
__label__1	I wanted to be cutting at those trees in the forest of difficulty , under circumstances that should prove my strength .
__label__1	She ’ s more to me -- gent ’ lmen -- than -- she ’ s all to me that ever I can want , and more than ever I -- than ever I could say .
__label__0	In 1791 , the <NAME> Government , justly uneasy as to the fate of these two sloops , manned two large merchantmen , the <NAME> and the <NAME> , which left Brest the 28th of September under the command of <NAME> d'Entrecasteaux .
__label__1	I name one week from this day , for a last final visit on my part ; when you will unconditionally accept it or reject it , with its train of consequences .
__label__1	About what ? ’ ‘ You must remember , my dear , that whenever I have said anything , on any subject , I have never heard the last of it : and consequently , that I have long left off saying anything. ’ ‘ I can hear you , mother. ’ But , it was only by dint of bending down to her ear , and at the same time attentively watching the lips as they moved , that she could link such faint and broken sounds into any chain of connexion .
__label__0	On an order from <NAME> the prisoners defiled , one by one , past <NAME> , who remained immovable as a statue , and whose face expressed only perfect indifference .
__label__1	Near London. ’ ‘ Mine , perhaps you recollect , ’ said <NAME> , with a serious look , ‘ lives down in <NAME> -- one of ten .
__label__1	I will do no more .
__label__1	The prison on the crag was not so dominant as of yore ; there were soldiers to guard it , but not many ; there were officers to guard the soldiers , but not one of them knew what his men would do -- beyond this : that it would probably not be what he was ordered .
__label__1	We , who have no such optical powers , are better pleased to take our last parting look at the visionary companions of many solitary hours , when the brief sunshine of the world is blazing full upon them .
__label__0	“ Oh , the dreadful creatures ! ” cried <NAME> , hiding her eyes ; “ they fill me with horror ! ” “ And they are really formidable , ” added <NAME> ; “ are they not , <NAME> ? ” “ To be sure -- very formidable , ” answered he .
__label__1	We will not wake her. ’ ‘ Let us not talk of her in her sleep , but as she used to be when you were journeying together , far away -- as she was at home , in the old house from which you fled together -- as she was , in the old cheerful time , ’ said the schoolmaster .
__label__0	<NAME> positively talked to the beast , and <NAME> understood perfectly , though unable to reply , for , after a great deal of arguing , the noble creature yielded , though he still champed the bit .
__label__1	I writed some words to <NAME> , ’ an air of novelty came over Mr Pancks with this designation , ‘ to come and help .
__label__0	Upon their surface fell other waves , which in their turn became stone , but a step nearer the centre of the lake .
__label__0	Bending over his work-table , he had not heard me .
__label__0	A seat in the stern , a second seat in the middle to preserve the equilibrium , a third seat in the bows , rowlocks for the two oars , a scull to steer with , completed the little craft , which was twelve feet long , and did not weigh more than two hundred pounds .
__label__1	'Yes , sir , ' replied <NAME> , in a low , tremulous voice .
__label__0	They have dispersed , some are gone into their huts .
__label__0	Of course the powder-magazine was open , and as they were firing incessantly , some careless or clumsy fellow just blew up the vessel ! ''
__label__0	[ Illustration ] During the night a favorable breeze carried them well to the north , and soon the lofty mountains of <NAME> were peering above the horizon ; <NAME> , where the governor of the <NAME> settlements lived , was left on the right .
__label__1	‘ Make my compliments to <NAME> , and say I am here now. ’ Miss <NAME> ’ s compliments came down in return , and , if it were not too much trouble , would Mr <NAME> be so kind as to come up before he went ?
__label__1	‘ Well , sir , I have been thinking that if you were in waiting in the garden behind , alone -- ’ ‘ Alone , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	It is to be hoped they will still continue happy .
__label__0	“ But , ” said <NAME> , “ our journey is not dangerous , is it ? ” “ Not at all , ” replied <NAME> , quickly .
__label__0	But on the third day the huts opened ; all the savages , men , women , and children , in all several hundred Maories , assembled in the “ pah , ” silent and calm .
__label__0	The garrison , without including the militia , consisted at that time of 2200 soldiers ; and , in addition to the military navy , always represented by some vessel at anchor , a marine service had been organized for the exclusive use of the colony , to which the name of `` sutil '' had been given , either on account of the small size , or the fleetness of the vessels employed .
__label__1	Nor had Flora the least signs of seclusion upon her , notwithstanding her recent declaration ; but , on the contrary , was wonderfully smart , and enjoyed the ceremonies mightily , though in a fluttered way .
__label__1	‘ In the church , down yonder , ’ said the <NAME> , pointing his thumb over his shoulder .
__label__0	A price was set upon his head , but he managed to escape from his pursuers .
__label__0	In a few minutes the engineer was made acquainted with the state of affairs .
__label__0	Their faces were as red as if they were standing before a hot fire ; their breathing was loud , and their lungs heaved like a smith 's bellows ; their eyes blazed like burning coals ; their voices sounded as loud and harsh as that of a stump speaker trying to make himself heard by an inattentive or hostile crowd ; their words popped from their lips like corks from <NAME> bottles ; their gesticulating became wilder and in fact more alarming -- considering the little room left in the Projectile for muscular displays of any kind .
__label__0	The question was , whether a chimney could be discerned between the two masts of the vessel , which was now at a distance of only five miles .
__label__1	Seeing <NAME> , the least expected of men , he looked wilder and said , ‘ What ’ s the matter ? ’ ‘ You asked me once what <NAME> ’ s complaint was. ’ ‘ Extraordinary answer !
__label__1	When they were within two paces of each other , <NAME> 's <NAME> held up its hand , warning him to come no nearer .
__label__1	<NAME> profusion is in the shops : particularly in the articles of currants , raisins , spices , candied peel , and moist sugar .
__label__1	‘ My love for my dear child was a diseased love , but my mind was all unhealthy then .
__label__1	<NAME> , who had been looking at the fire and pondering , here said that something had come into his thoughts arising out of <NAME> 's suggestion , which it might be worth while to pursue .
__label__0	Their military weapons attained colossal proportions , and their projectiles , exceeding the prescribed limits , unfortunately occasionally cut in two some unoffending pedestrians .
__label__1	‘ My son ’ s great capacity was tempted on , there , by a feeling of voluntary emulation and conscious pride , ’ the fond lady went on to say .
__label__0	`` What we did not do , what we could not do on our first passage at the dead point , because the projectile was then endowed with too great a speed . ''
__label__1	A very remarkable way , <NAME> , of acquiring a knowledge of men and things. ’ ‘ I mention it , sir , ’ <NAME> rejoins , with unspeakable complacency , ‘ because , as I say , it don ’ t do to boast of what you are ; but show how you came to be it , and then you prove it. ’ ‘ Most interesting .
__label__0	The barking of a dog came across the steppe .
__label__1	He had scarcely washed himself , and made everything tidy , by emptying the basin out of the window , agreeably to the <NAME> 's directions , when the <NAME> returned : accompanied by a very sprightly young friend , whom <NAME> had seen smoking on the previous night , and who was now formally introduced to him as <NAME> .
__label__1	The gloomy Eugene too , is not without some kindred touch ; for , when that appalling <NAME> declares that if Another had survived , he should have gone down at the head of her list of lovers -- and also when the mature young lady shrugs her epaulettes , and laughs at some private and confidential comment from the mature young gentleman -- his gloom deepens to that degree that he trifles quite ferociously with his dessert-knife .
__label__0	For this reason it is as precious as , from another point of view , are the flute used by <NAME> , and the shoes of the poor sailor who died during the winter sojourn .
__label__1	She WAS worth any six , and she IS worth any six .
__label__1	The cat leaped down and ripped at a bundle of rags with her tigerish claws , with a sound that it set my teeth on edge to hear .
__label__1	He had gone into every late or early public-house where there was a light ( they were not a few at that time , the road being then much frequented by drovers ) and had got down to talk to the turnpike-keepers .
__label__1	‘ This is the hend , is it , of all my bearing with her deceitfulness , her lowness , her falseness , her laying herself out to catch the admiration of vulgar minds , in a way which made me blush for my -- for my -- ’ ‘ Gender , ’ suggested <NAME> , regarding the spectators with a malevolent eye -- literally A malevolent eye .
__label__0	I would not have your ruins mingle with those of the Avenger ! ''
__label__1	Mrs Wickam then sprinkled a little cooling-stuff about the room , with the air of a female grave-digger , who was strewing ashes on ashes , dust on dust -- for she was a serious character -- and withdrew to partake of certain funeral baked meats downstairs .
__label__1	When we repeated , with some surprise , `` The sheep ? ''
__label__1	Talk of <NAME> risk in the conspiracy ! ’ ‘ I say , ’ remonstrated <NAME> , looking uneasily round : ‘ don ’ t call it that !
__label__1	Give me a pen , give me a pen. ’ Even the power of restlessness was gone , except from the poor head , which could just turn from side to side .
__label__0	I long , <NAME> , to hear you say , ‘ Come , <NAME> , my eyes can bear daylight , and I want to see the sun !
__label__1	`` Me , '' said the boy , `` and <NAME> , '' patting the limp bonnet of the child he was nursing .
__label__1	And I am -- quite sure ! ’ She might rely upon it , said <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Very ill , <NAME> , have I been ? ’ ‘ Dead , all but , ’ replied the small servant .
__label__1	I saw , directly , in his mother ’ s face , that she knew from himself what he had done .
__label__1	‘ She is pale though , and looks much exhausted .
__label__0	A safety-lamp hung at his belt , also a large , strong knife in a leather sheath .
__label__1	It seems like a dream. ’ With the view , no doubt , of testing the reality of his position , Mr <NAME> pushed his tumbler as he spoke towards Mrs Jiniwin for the purpose of being replenished ; and turned towards the attendant mariners .
__label__0	At his shout two or three pirates awoke , jumped up , and , rushing on <NAME> , endeavored to throw him down .
__label__1	`` Then the possibility or probability -- for such it must be considered -- of your never being disturbed in possession of those effects lately belonging to a lone old man who seemed to have no relation in the world , and the certainty of your being able to find out what he really had got stored up there , do n't weigh with you at all against last night , <NAME> , if I understand you ? ''
__label__1	And so I said yes , if it was no harm , and she said no -- no harm .
__label__0	The air seemed to have no effect upon these trees -- which in spite of a tolerable breeze remained as still and motionless as if they had been petrified .
__label__1	Not that he spared her , or was fearful of her being spent by watching and fatigue ; he was not more troubled on that score than he had usually been .
__label__0	That long darkness of the poles sheds a moral and physical influence on mortals which no one can elude , a gloomy and overwhelming impression almost impossible to resist .
__label__1	As all partings foreshadow the great final one , so , empty rooms , bereft of a familiar presence , mournfully whisper what your room and what mine must one day be .
__label__1	‘ I ’ ll give the lady my card. ’ She produced it from her pocket with an air , after struggling with the gigantic door-key which had got upon the top of it and kept it down .
__label__1	Went to Westminster School as a King ’ s <NAME> , when I was principally living on garbage , and sleeping in market baskets .
__label__1	'That 's for our share of the trouble , ' said <NAME> ; 'and not half enough , neither .
__label__1	I remember one hot evening I went into the bar of a public-house , and said to the landlord : ‘ What is your best -- your very best -- ale a glass ? ’ For it was a special occasion .
__label__0	<NAME> ? ” continued <NAME> eagerly .
__label__0	not agreeable ! ” exclaimed <NAME> , jumping at the word as likely to give a new turn to the conversation .
__label__1	‘ My dear Kate , if you will allow me to speak , ’ said Mrs. Nickleby , ‘ I shall take the liberty of explaining to this lady -- ’ ‘ I think it is almost unnecessary , mama. ’ And notwithstanding all the frowns and winks with which Mrs. <NAME> intimated that she was going to say something which would clench the business at once , <NAME> maintained her point by an expressive look , and for once Mrs. <NAME> was stopped upon the very brink of an oration .
__label__0	`` Tell me , '' I asked , `` did <NAME> really come to <NAME> on board the <NAME> ? ''
__label__0	Spoons , forks , and knives are unknown in <NAME> ; soup is eaten from the bowl , meat is taken in the hands , and torn with the fingers into pieces the size of a mouthful .
__label__1	Numbers of people were lost in the <NAME> Office .
__label__1	When I had ordered everything I wanted , I directed my steps towards <NAME> 's , and , as I approached that gentleman 's place of business , I saw him standing at his door .
__label__1	To your husband , poor wretch , this was well enough -- ’ ‘ Why , if , ’ she said , surveying him with a haughty contempt and disgust , that he shrunk under , let him brave it as he would , ‘ if all my other reasons for despising him could have been blown away like feathers , his having you for his counsellor and favourite , would have almost been enough to hold their place. ’ ‘ Is that a reason why you have run away with me ? ’ he asked her , tauntingly .
__label__1	As the traveller sees farthest by day , and becomes aware of rugged mountains and trackless plains which the friendly darkness had shrouded from his sight and mind together , so , the wayfarer in the toilsome path of human life sees , with each returning sun , some new obstacle to surmount , some new height to be attained .
__label__1	‘ Do you mean to tell me , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , folding his arms emphatically , and turning half-round to the jury , as if in mute assurance that he would bother the witness yet -- ‘ do you mean to tell me , <NAME> , that you saw nothing of this fainting on the part of the plaintiff in the arms of the defendant , which you have heard described by the witnesses ? ’ Certainly not , ’ replied <NAME> ; ‘ I was in the passage till they called me up , and then the old lady was not there. ’ ‘ Now , attend , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , dipping a large pen into the inkstand before him , for the purpose of frightening <NAME> with a show of taking down his answer .
__label__1	My dearest girl , dearer to me than anything in life , if you are unhappy , let me share your unhappiness .
__label__1	We went out to the door ; and there was my mother , looking unusually pretty , I thought , and with her a gentleman with beautiful black hair and whiskers , who had walked home with us from church last Sunday .
__label__0	Now nothing could prevent the success of their enterprise , and <NAME> and <NAME> shared <NAME> 's joy .
__label__0	But how the conditions under which they traveled were altered !
__label__1	A housekeeper would be acceptable over yonder at the <NAME> , for instance .
__label__1	This <NAME> was at the <NAME> de Ville , and might be loosed .
__label__1	The craving man on the jury rubbed his hands together , and restored the usual hand to his mouth .
__label__0	cried I , in the height of my exasperation , `` we are on the way to an eruption , are we ?
__label__1	cried <NAME> , holding up his hands .
__label__1	It appeared incredible that the coat and waistcoat could be seen by mortal eyes without the <NAME> ; but he certainly was not in them , otherwise his legs -- the houses in <NAME> Place not being lofty -- would have obstructed the street door , which was perfectly clear .
__label__1	The father is like his own father , a weak wretched trembling creature , falling to pieces , never sober .
__label__1	‘ Let me do something for you , at least , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	That you can find out .
__label__1	Especially as you have no call to be told how to value yourself , my dear. ’ Colouring a little under this compliment , <NAME> returned , ‘ I hope sir , you don ’ t think me vain ? ’ ‘ Not a bit , my dear , ’ said Mr Boffin .
__label__1	<NAME> , try ! ’ His friend gave him what aid he could , and encouraged him to believe that he was more composed , though even then his eyes were losing the expression they so rarely recovered .
__label__1	If it don ’ t act well , or don ’ t quite accord with our mutual convenience , he can easily go to the right-about .
__label__1	Plashwater Weir <NAME> ! ’ The bargeman stopped , and looked back .
__label__1	Where ’ s your feminine tenderness ? ’ ‘ You thankless dog ! ’ gasped <NAME> .

__label__1	Did you find Madeline herself , waiting for you and expecting you ?
__label__0	Soon after this , some of the principal people in the country even tried to carve for themselves kingdoms out of the empire of <NAME> .
__label__1	`` Do you think he did it on purpose ? ''
__label__1	It was his delight to help her , or to fancy that he did so , and they soon became close companions .
__label__1	After this , he smoked four pipes successively in the little parlour by himself , and was discovered chuckling , at the expiration of as many hours .
__label__1	You here again ? ” said <NAME> .
__label__0	Several thermometers , barometers , and telescopes were packed in the instrument case .
__label__1	<NAME> to atone for his past neglect without another hour ’ s delay , he straightway walked upstairs to <NAME> , and requested leave of absence for this laudable purpose .
__label__1	I think <NAME> did too ; I think he darkened the room for that reason .
__label__0	`` I have heard them talking about it , and they could make no more out of it than we can ; they imagined a thousand things which did not satisfy them in the least . ''
__label__1	`` I hope not , guardian , '' said I .
__label__1	The evidence lay in a most remarkable manner , between those two .
__label__1	Oh , my lungs and liver , what do you want ?
__label__0	Upon returning on board , the officers reported that the natives had invited them to land , more especially the women , with unequivocal gestures , and that moreover , there was excellent anchorage near the shore within reach of water .
__label__0	Now , this wall is seamed with fissures and clefts which already allow the sulphureous gases generated in the interior of the volcano to escape . ''
__label__1	‘ I made mention of no names , and I wish to make mention of no names , ’ said <NAME> , with a portentous look .
__label__0	<NAME> had served under him , and was far too grand a personage to trouble himself about the grumbling of the ship 's officers .
__label__0	The efforts of the whole of the expedition were steadily applied to the task of trying to repair the main injuries sustained by the <NAME> , with the exception of a few sailors told off to provide , by hunting and fishing , for the subsistence of the community .
__label__1	And yet , in the very midst of these terrors , I was placed in a situation so exquisitely ridiculous , that even then I had as strong a sense of its absurdity as I have now , and could no more help laughing than I can at any other comical incident , happening under circumstances the most favourable to its enjoyment .
__label__1	Here , <NAME> coughed impatiently ; which appeared to afford <NAME> the most exquisite delight .
__label__1	This made him doubt whether he had locked his door last night , and feel a little surprised at having a companion in the room .
__label__1	At length all this was devoutly believed ; and the new sexton used to exhibit to the curious , for a trifling emolument , a good-sized piece of the church weathercock which had been accidentally kicked off by the aforesaid horse in his aerial flight , and picked up by himself in the churchyard , a year or two afterwards .
__label__0	“ The ‘ Nautilus ’ is imprisoned in this grotto , the entrance of which is blocked up ; but , although egress is impossible , the vessel may at least sink in the abyss , and there bury my remains. ” The colonists listened reverently to the words of the dying man .
__label__0	“ Well , ” replied the reporter , who had already hunted the tiger in <NAME> , and the lion in <NAME> , “ we shall soon learn how successfully to encounter them .
__label__0	Besides , <NAME> would never consent to leave his vessel .
__label__1	Not so , by any means .
__label__1	She wean ’ t be a bride in a hurry , I reckon. ’ ‘ For shame , <NAME> , ’ said Mrs. <NAME> ; with an acute perception of the joke though , being a bride herself .
__label__0	This native of <NAME> was active and supple in appearance , though he scarcely moved his arms , being in fact one of those men who despise the habit of gesticulation common to southern people .
__label__0	`` Friend <NAME> , you say we 're moving ? ''
__label__0	Often , too , the brig would leave bits of sheathing on the ice against which she grazed .
__label__0	He overwhelmed the captain , officers , and sailors , who could not help laughing at his impatience , with all sorts of questions .
__label__1	We expressed our acknowledgments and sat down behind the door , where there was a lame invalid of a sofa .

__label__1	‘ I am going on , Mr Headstone , don ’ t you be afraid .
__label__0	It was fortunate for him , for there is nothing more repulsive than the sight of that crowd of living and dead objects , of seal 's bodies and Esquimaux-flesh , decayed fish and unclean clothing , which fill a <NAME> hut ; there is no window to renew that suffocating air ; there is only a hole at the top of the cabin which lets the smoke out , but gives no relief to the stench .
__label__0	One hour more , and the point of equal attraction would be reached .
__label__1	She passed the scene of the struggle -- yonder it was , on her left , well over the boat ’ s stern -- she passed on her right , the end of the village street , a hilly street that almost dipped into the river ; its sounds were growing faint again , and she slackened ; looking as the boat drove , everywhere , everywhere , for the floating face .
__label__0	His business affairs could not afford a sufficient reason .
__label__1	I am sure it does no good .
__label__0	An officer was at once deputed to go and ascertain from the captain what succour he could render to the <NAME> travellers .
__label__1	I remarked that , once or twice when <NAME> was talking , he looked at <NAME> sideways , as if to make sure of his not being displeased ; and that once when <NAME> ( the other gentleman ) was in high spirits , he trod upon his foot , and gave him a secret caution with his eyes , to observe <NAME> , who was sitting stern and silent .
__label__1	‘ I said that it was better as it is ! ’ she whispers , as she holds me in her arms .
__label__1	Her tears sprung forth beneath it , as she sunk upon her knees , and laid her aching head and streaming hair upon the pillow by its side .
__label__0	“ Who would ever have expected so much from a newspaper man ! ” thought <NAME> .
__label__0	`` More than that , '' replied <NAME> ; `` we should have been burned to death . ''
__label__0	Here a rock , there a projection from the ground , seemed to be the much-sought-for projectile ; but their mistake was soon discovered , and then they were in despair .
__label__0	The gleam seems intermittent too , sometimes , like that of a lighthouse. ” “ You are right , ” said <NAME> , “ and yet we are not on a lighted coast. ” “ Ah ! ” he exclaimed , “ another fire ?
__label__0	They began to be seriously alarmed .
__label__1	I understand there were some of our very best men among ‘ em .
__label__0	In certain places , less crowded , growing in clumps , these pines exhibited considerable dimensions , and appeared to indicate , by their development , that the country was situated in a higher latitude than the engineer had supposed .
__label__0	<NAME> alone , it was clear , had brought <NAME> Proctor on this train ; but there he was , and it was necessary , at all hazards , that <NAME> should not perceive his adversary .
__label__0	The sail was spread , and the frail structure commenced its progress toward the land , aided by wind and tide .
__label__1	<NAME> -- little Jack -- man with a cast in his eye , and slight impediment in his speech -- man who sat for somebody ’ s borough .
__label__1	Why , I think that sometimes. ’ ‘ You are laughing , <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Well , <NAME> , what have you got to say to me ? ’ <NAME> remained silent .
__label__1	<NAME> , with an instinctive delicacy , forbore to urge the least obstacle , though she did not forbear to overpower him with thanks ; and Mr Toots proudly took the commission upon himself for immediate execution .
__label__0	Look around you and see if these three mountains piled one upon the other do not resemble a staircase built up by giants , on which to climb to heaven .
__label__1	But come in , come in ! ’ The old man limped on before , and warning her of the downward step , which he achieved himself with no small difficulty , led the way into his little cottage .
__label__1	Echoing <NAME> A wonderful corner for echoes , it has been remarked , that corner where the <NAME> lived .
__label__0	the unfortunate man had wept !
__label__1	I had not got far into it , when I judged from her looks that she was thinking in a discursive way of me , rather than of what I said .
__label__0	From <NAME> , as a focus , radiated in all directions , as from the head of a peeled orange , more than a hundred luminous streaks or channels , edges raised , middle depressed -- or perhaps _vice versa_ , owing to an optical illusion -- some at least twelve miles wide , some fully thirty .
__label__1	he ! ’ ‘ Not many , I think , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	This recital will destroy many illusions and surmises ; but it will give a true idea of the singular changes in store for such an enterprise ; it will bring out the scientific instincts of <NAME> , the industrious resources of <NAME> , and the audacious humor of <NAME> .
__label__1	Then I watch ; then I hide , until he walks and smokes .
__label__1	There had been snow , some hours before ; and it lay , not deep , but hard-frozen on the ground .
__label__1	‘ “ Under favour , <NAME> , ” replied the horror-stricken sexton , “ I don ’ t think they can , <NAME> ; they don ’ t know me , <NAME> ; I don ’ t think the gentlemen have ever seen me , Sir. ” ‘ “ Oh , yes , they have , ” replied the goblin ; “ we know the man with the sulky face and grim scowl , that came down the street to-night , throwing his evil looks at the children , and grasping his burying-spade the tighter .
__label__1	`` No , no , we will try to prevent that .
__label__1	A tributary stream of confusion , moreover , poured in from an adjoining bedroom , where Mr F. ’ s <NAME> appeared , from the sound of her voice , to be in a horizontal posture , awaiting her breakfast ; and from which bower that inexorable lady snapped off short taunts , whenever she could get a hearing , as , ‘ <NAME> ’ t believe it ’ s his doing ! ’ and ‘ He needn ’ t take no credit to himself for it ! ’ and ‘ It ’ ll be long enough , I expect , afore he ’ ll give up any of his own money ! ’ all designed to disparage <NAME> ’ s share in the discovery , and to relieve those inveterate feelings with which Mr F. ’ s <NAME> regarded him .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , ’ said Mr Feeder , in a low reproachful voice , ‘ take some water. ’ The <NAME> , looking very stern , made a pause until the water was brought , and then resumed : ‘ And when , Mr Feeder -- ’ But Mr Feeder , who saw that <NAME> must break out again , and who knew that the Doctor would never come to a period before the young gentlemen until he had finished all he meant to say , couldn ’ t keep his eye off <NAME> ; and thus was caught in the fact of not looking at the <NAME> , who consequently stopped .
__label__1	`` Why , my <NAME> has been but poorly , ma'am , since she was last here -- I do n't mean with the family , ma'am , but when she was here as a bird of passage like .
__label__0	The climate , you know , <NAME> , the regenerative climate -- ” Here the poor <NAME> stuck fast , unable to get further , like the wagon in the mud .
__label__0	They then , having eaten , returned to their post .
__label__1	‘ It would be better for yourself , and all of us , if you WERE mercenary , <NAME> -- I mean , if you were more discreet and less influenced by all this youthful nonsense .
__label__1	‘ No , thank you , ’ said Mr Merdle , ‘ I don ’ t feel inclined for it .
__label__1	But I must say , even to you , having known this injured family from childhood , that if you suppose the girl , so deeply wronged , has not been cruelly deluded , and would not rather die a hundred deaths than take a cup of water from your son ’ s hand now , you cherish a terrible mistake. ’ ‘ Well , <NAME> , well ! ’ said Mrs. <NAME> , as the other was about to interpose , ‘ it is no matter .
__label__0	It was within an hour of morning .
__label__0	Thus perished this great navigator , assuredly the most illustrious produced by <NAME> .
__label__0	he exclaimed , `` and the earth ? ''
__label__1	‘ Oh , yes , it ’ s all right , ’ replied Mrs. Crummles , anticipating the question .
__label__0	At last the Chief Engineer , excited by some remark that had been made , observed with much earnestness : `` You may say what you please , gentlemen , but I would willingly give my last dollar to know what has become of those brave men !
__label__1	‘ Not there ! ’ cried <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ And how are you , old woman ? ’ ‘ Ha , ha ! ’ laughed <NAME> , sitting down beside us , and rubbing his hands in his sense of relief from recent trouble , and in the genuine heartiness of his nature ; ‘ there ’ s not a woman in the wureld , sir -- as I tell her -- that need to feel more easy in her mind than her !
__label__1	The faces of the women , as I have said , it humanises and refines .
__label__0	The fact was that the Governor of <NAME> was a <NAME> sergeant , an old comrade of <NAME> .
__label__1	The laws of the <NAME> forbid their working more than nine months in the year , and require that they be educated during the other three .
__label__0	But <NAME> was blind and obstinate , and determined to sacrifice himself at all hazards , when suddenly he felt himself violently pushed back .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> shut her eyes , and disdainfully inclined her head ; then , slowly opening her eyes , resumed : ‘ <NAME> , I shall not attempt to disguise the fact , that I formed an unfavourable opinion of you in your childhood .
__label__0	<NAME> having declined all participation in the matter , the only representatives of the <NAME> Empire were those from the <NAME> .
__label__1	You wish me to speak to her , and tell her so , and entreat her to be your wife .
__label__1	A <NAME> having had a difficulty with a citizen of the place , <NAME> ; a brother-in-law of the latter provided himself with one of <NAME> ’ s revolving pistols , met <NAME> in the street , _and discharged the contents of five of the barrels at him_ : _each shot taking effect_ .
__label__0	All congratulated the honest old sailor whom they loved .
__label__1	Then they fell to work upon the supper in earnest ; and there was <NAME> , that foolish <NAME> , declaring that she could not eat more than two , and wanting more pressing than you would believe before she would eat four : though her mother and <NAME> ’ s mother made up for it pretty well , and ate and laughed and enjoyed themselves so thoroughly that it did <NAME> good to see them , and made him laugh and eat likewise from strong sympathy .
__label__0	No one was admitted within the enclosure except a delegation of members of the <NAME> , who had made the voyage to <NAME> .
__label__0	This cry came from the summit of the moving mountain , and <NAME> was revealed to our sight , standing on the outermost block , his hand stretched towards the north .
__label__1	‘ Believe ! ’ retorted the other , ‘ can anybody doubt it ?
__label__0	But J. T. <NAME> would not hear of going away .
__label__0	“ The <NAME> generally brings a tempest which lasts three days , and may be always foretold by the depression of the mercury , ” he said .
__label__1	<NAME> , hi ! ’ <NAME> once more , savagely .
__label__0	“ You may count upon me !
__label__1	How is he , sir ? ’ ‘ He was very well indeed when I came away , <NAME> Peggotty. ’ ‘ There ’ s a friend ! ’ said <NAME> , stretching out his pipe .
__label__1	<NAME> ’ t talk like that , <NAME> , if you please. ’ ‘ I won ’ t talk at all , ’ said <NAME> , with an action of her crooked fingers that made him shrink into half his natural compass in the corner .
__label__0	“ It is there that we shall alight , if God permits. ” “ But , it seems to be inhabited , doctor. ” “ <NAME> is right ; and , unless I ’ m mistaken , there is a group of about a score of natives on it now. ” “ We ’ ll make them scatter ; there ’ ll be no great trouble in that , ” responded <NAME> .
__label__0	The climate is much milder than in <NAME> 's <NAME> , which is in the same latitude .
__label__1	Yet even when his eyes were opened on the mist and rain , on the moving patch of light from the lamps , and the hedge at the roadside retreating by jerks , the night shadows outside the coach would fall into the train of the night shadows within .
__label__0	They soon reached <NAME> , where the <NAME> enters the <NAME> of <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ In the very hour of his return almost -- before the shoe upon his foot is dry -- he asperses his father ’ s memory to his mother !
__label__0	<NAME> also visited <NAME> , and ascertained that <NAME> , in that group , is an active volcano .
__label__0	If the animals of <NAME> origin , if works due to a human hand , showed incontestably that men had already visited the island , several specimens of the vegetable kingdom did not prove it less .
__label__0	`` No , '' replied the engineer , `` it is our waggon of ammunition and provisions , and , if necessary , it would serve as an intrenchment . ''
__label__0	said I , looking at the leaden sky .
__label__1	<NAME> , a disappointed suitor , has been here to-day and has been alarming .
__label__1	‘ That is a threat , ’ he answered , in his voiceless manner of assent : adding aloud , ‘ but not directed against you. ’ Proud , erect , and dignified , as she stood confronting him ; and looking through him as she did , with her full bright flashing eye ; and smiling , as she was , with scorn and bitterness ; she sunk as if the ground had dropped beneath her , and in an instant would have fallen on the floor , but that he caught her in his arms .
__label__0	<NAME> nuts are chewed , and sometimes even swallowed when mixed with _trona_ , a habit not peculiar to <NAME> , for it extends to <NAME> , where it is strictly forbidden to women .
__label__1	But it is full of indignation to-night after undergoing the ordeal of consigning to the tomb the remains of a faithful , a zealous , a devoted adherent . ''
__label__0	An oath burst from the latter , whose features contracted .
__label__0	All the navigators of the austral seas have been able to ascertain , as I myself have done , the permanence of this wind . ''
__label__1	In short , I was always full of fears for the rash man who was in hiding .
__label__0	What could it avail to sow , to reap , to hunt , to increase the stores of <NAME> ?
__label__0	<NAME> , impatient of delay , cut the rope , thus sacrificing his anchor , and also the possibility of anchoring again if this tide failed to carry them to land .
__label__0	While J. T. <NAME> formed part of the “ Co. ” could she do otherwise than applaud ?
__label__1	‘ A very singular young man that , ’ said the powdered-headed footman , looking after <NAME> , with a countenance which clearly showed he could make nothing of him .
__label__1	It held a branch of fresh green holly in its hand ; and , in singular contradiction of that wintry emblem , had its dress trimmed with summer flowers .
__label__0	The new road was very steep , and consequently very painful .
__label__0	The evening twilight came on .
__label__0	He seemed even more downhearted than his companions .
__label__0	It had appeared necessary to enlarge their dimensions , for the feathered population had increased considerably .
__label__0	In it two figures may be seen , standing , the top of the heads disappearing in high cylindrical hats , similar to those on the statues in <NAME> .
__label__1	Lying down again with his eyes shut , he heard the Apothecary say , out of the room and quite a long way off -- or he dreamed it -- that there was a want of vital power ( what was that , <NAME> wondered ! )
__label__0	<NAME> was aided by splendid weather , a fortunate circumstance , as scurvy had made such ravages among the sailors , that very few of them were in a condition to work .
__label__0	He was so good to me and my sister .
__label__1	‘ He has been to <NAME> fifty times , if he has been there once ; yet if he came to <NAME> to-morrow -- I wish he would , dear angel ! -- he would make his fifty-second visit next day. ’ ‘ We are all enthusiastic , are we not , <NAME> ? ’ said <NAME> , with a cold smile .
__label__0	shouted <NAME> ; `` there 's something wrong .
__label__1	And again , for anything I knew , the proffered information might have some important bearing on the flight itself .
__label__1	Since no one here knows anything about him , it might be as well to send for <NAME> .
__label__1	They went out by another staircase , avoiding the lodge ; and coming into the front court-yard , now all quiet and deserted , gained the street .
__label__1	You are again the prisoner of the Republic. ” The four surrounded him , where he stood with his wife and child clinging to him .
__label__1	“ <NAME> and I have talked about it again and again , ” <NAME> pursued , “ and the dear little thing begged me only this evening , with tears in her eyes , to say to you that , if you will live with us when we come together , she will do her best to make you happy , and to convince her husband 's friend that he is her friend too .
__label__1	' I think I see him now , ' cried the Jew , bending his eyes upon his pupil .
__label__1	Do ye gang whoam wi ’ me , and do yon loight an ’ toight young whipster look sharp out for a brokken head , next time he cums under my hond. ’ ‘ Mercy on us , what ’ s all this ? ’ cried <NAME> , in affected astonishment .
__label__1	They threw themselves into committees in the most impassioned manner and collected subscriptions with a vehemence quite extraordinary .
__label__1	I sat down by his side in silence .
__label__1	It must be very steadily and seriously undertaken , <NAME> Pipchin. ’ ‘ Well , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ I can say nothing to the contrary. ’ ‘ I was quite sure , <NAME> , ’ returned Mr Dombey , approvingly , ‘ that a person of your good sense could not , and would not. ’ ‘ There is a great deal of nonsense -- and worse -- talked about young people not being pressed too hard at first , and being tempted on , and all the rest of it , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , impatiently rubbing her hooked nose .
__label__1	I shall tell her , in no more wureds than I speak to you , what it ’ s the price on ; and that I ’ m gone , and past receiving of it back. ’ I told him that I thought it would be right to do so -- that I was thoroughly convinced it would be , since he felt it to be right .
__label__1	My first question when I saw <NAME> had been of course , whether all was well down the river ?
__label__1	Thus equipped , he was to saunter into the office , as some country fellow from <NAME> market might be supposed to do for the gratification of his curiousity ; and as he was as awkward , ungainly , and raw-boned a fellow as need be , <NAME> had no fear but that he would look the part to perfection .
__label__0	We did not even reach the spot mentioned by <NAME> . ''
__label__0	What do you think of it , now ? ” “ I think , ” answered the engineer , “ that the combat will now take a new form , for it can not be supposed that the convicts will be so foolish as to remain in a position so unfavorable for them ! ” “ They won ’ t cross the channel , ” said the sailor .
__label__0	he said on his return to the camp , addressing the observation to me .
__label__1	I shall come all right again , then , do n't you be afraid . ''
__label__1	It would have been flat heresy to do so .
__label__0	This was my one idea .
__label__1	‘ Shall I speak of our affairs , mother ?
__label__1	<NAME> , <NAME> , it ’ s a large place ! ’ She shook her head , turned her delighted bright eyes up to mine , kissed me , broke into a merry laugh , and sprang away to put on <NAME> ’ s new collar .
__label__1	The Secretary kept silence for a little while ; then merely said , ‘ You are wholly mistaken , <NAME> ; wonderfully mistaken .
__label__1	<NAME> 's breakfast for to-morrow , served out to be cooked .
__label__1	‘ I shouldn ’ t so much mind being a carpenter , <NAME> Merdle. ’ ‘ And my complaint is , ’ pursued the lady , disregarding the low remark , ‘ that it is not the tone of <NAME> , and that you ought to correct it , Mr Merdle .
__label__0	But the engineer did not reply to the sailor except by proposing to examine the cliff more attentively , from the mouth of the river to the angle which terminated it on the north .
__label__1	This is the port wine , ma'am , that the board ordered for the infirmary ; real , fresh , genuine port wine ; only out of the cask this forenoon ; clear as a bell , and no sediment ! '
__label__0	Owing to the defective construction of the <NAME> , however , unusual precautions became necessary in unfavourable weather ; but the loss of time which resulted from this cause , while it nearly drove Passepartout out of his senses , did not seem to affect his master in the least .
__label__1	She was surprised to find a bright light burning ; still more surprised , on looking in , to see that her <NAME> , but partially undressed , was sitting near the ashes of the fire , which had crumbled and dropped away .
__label__0	The soil was thickly studded with cocoa-nut , papaw , and cotton-wood trees , above which the balloon seemed to disport itself like a bird .
__label__1	She , who coils her fascinations round me like a pure angelic rattlesnake !
__label__1	The sun went down and she was still there .

__label__1	And I tell you another thing , <NAME> , '' says <NAME> , who has suddenly lowered his voice and become familiar again , `` he 's an extraordinary old chap -- always rummaging among a litter of papers and grubbing away at teaching himself to read and write , without getting on a bit , as it seems to me .
__label__1	If _I_ can put that aside , if _I_ can eradicate the marks of what I have endured , and can emerge before the world -- a -- ha -- gentleman unspoiled , unspotted -- is it a great deal to expect -- I say again , is it a great deal to expect -- that my children should -- hum -- do the same and sweep that accursed experience off the face of the earth ? ’ In spite of his flustered state , he made all these exclamations in a carefully suppressed voice , lest the valet should overhear anything .
__label__1	“ What ’ s that ? ” he said to me .
__label__0	Still , the eyes of all were fixed upon us , but there was no response .
__label__0	“ This is the reason the yacht at this time lay off the coast of <NAME> .
__label__1	He drew my hand through his arm and we went away to look for <NAME> .
__label__1	I need not add , after what you have said , that I have not yet found my arguments successful .
__label__1	'He has just had a basin of beautiful strong broth , sir , ' replied Mrs. Bedwin : drawing herself up slightly , and laying strong emphasis on the last word : to intimate that between slops , and broth will compounded , there existed no affinity or connection whatsoever .
__label__1	‘ It is , ’ replied the driver , rubbing himself as if he ached , after throwing the reins to the ostler .
__label__1	That fellow ! ’ said <NAME> , beating a lump of coal on the top of the fire , with the poker .
__label__0	Had this well branches besides the communication with the sea ?
__label__0	This book is a translation from the <NAME> original by <NAME> .
__label__1	If you had come as a common beggar , I might have thrown a sixpence to you in remembrance of the clever knave you used to be ; but since you try to palm these stale tricks upon one you might have known better , I ’ ll not part with a halfpenny -- nor would I to save you from rotting .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> climbed the slopes , supported , not to say carried , by <NAME> , and <NAME> leaned on the arm of <NAME> ; <NAME> , radiant with joy , triumphant at his success , led the march , and the two sailors brought up the rear .
__label__1	`` I am away on leave this day -- should have been gone in another hour -- and that is to smooth it over , for my selling out .
__label__1	In fact , Mrs. <NAME> was about to solace herself with a cup of tea .
__label__1	<NAME> , the adult pupils were taught to read ( if they could learn ) out of the <NAME> Testament ; and by dint of stumbling over the syllables and keeping their bewildered eyes on the particular syllables coming round to their turn , were as absolutely ignorant of the sublime history , as if they had never seen or heard of it .
__label__1	‘ So misplaced , ’ <NAME> went on , ‘ that I feel constantly apologetic towards him .

__label__0	On the other side , however , there are numerous peaks of barren aspect , rising from a lofty table-land , the approach to which is barred by a series of rugged and inaccessible islands , known as <NAME> , the coral-beds and treacherous currents about which must be carefully avoided .
__label__1	‘ I have inquired at the door , <NAME> , every day , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ twice a day , indeed , at first -- and tonight , presuming upon old acquaintance , and past transactions by which we have mutually benefited in some degree , I could not resist soliciting admission to your chamber .

__label__1	It arrested his attention , and he sat pausing over it , until he took off the rusty colourless wisp that he wore round his throat , and substituted the red neckerchief , leaving the long ends flowing .
__label__0	It was named <NAME> , and is in 166 degrees 52 minutes long .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> true , ’ returned <NAME> , shaking his head : ‘ but I meant a life of habit , <NAME> -- that sort of custom .

__label__1	'There 's a bolt at the top , you wo n't be able to reach , ' interposed Toby .
__label__1	I imagined it would be a kind of company to have the boys , and the bedroom where I used to tell the stories , so near me : although the boys would know nothing of my being there , and the bedroom would yield me no shelter .
__label__1	Then <NAME> seeming to be seized with an industrious mania or fury , turned to at the mangle , and impelled it at the heads of the innocents with such a creaking and rumbling , that <NAME> stopped him .
__label__0	<NAME> had swung himself down from branch to branch , and was waiting for him below , stretching his limbs in the mean time .
__label__0	When he entered this village , at the end of July , <NAME> little dreamt of the long stay he would be compelled to make in it .
__label__0	To ascertain the truth on this point , an expedition was sent out under <NAME> , an English naval officer who had given proof of intelligence and courage .
__label__1	`` He is as indifferent to the honour of knowing me , I dare say , as I am to the honour of knowing him .
__label__0	The native trees are only found on the edge of long prairies and about <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , ’ said her father , gently disengaging himself , ‘ it was nothing. ’ ‘ But you had that spasm yesterday , and it is terrible to see you in such pain .
__label__0	The <NAME> , having passed the outer belt of rocks by a narrow strait , found itself among breakers where the sea was from thirty to forty fathoms deep .
__label__1	<NAME> number four , under dreary pretences of being droll ( when it was very melancholy indeed ) , made the shallowest pretences of concealing pitfalls of knowledge , into which it was the duty of these babies to be smuggled and inveigled .
__label__0	Let us be off ! ” And so all three of them landed on the bank of the <NAME> and started for the town .
__label__1	It appears to me that this maxim is applicable to the medical as well as to the nautical profession .
__label__1	I understood him to add that she was parting amidships , and I could readily suppose so , for the rolling and beating were too tremendous for any human work to suffer long .
__label__1	These five year I ha ’ paid her .
__label__1	‘ There was a criminal called <NAME> -- a girl still , but deserted and an outcast .
__label__0	His principal duty consisted in examining pilots , who were not allowed to go to the <NAME> until after having passed this examination .
__label__0	Do you , or do you not , think that the <NAME> resembles the <NAME> in being the abode of animals and intelligent beings ?
__label__1	`` No , my love , '' said he .
__label__0	A cold sweat came over me .
__label__0	The chief of <NAME> , who had never before seen white men , received the explorers very kindly , held public rejoicings in their honour and detained them with constant fêtes until the 4th November .
__label__1	The only circumstance which gave me any new hope , was my aunt ’ s stopping on the stairs to inquire about a smell of fire that was prevalent there ; and janet ’ s replying that she had been making tinder down in the kitchen , of my old shirt .
__label__1	Will you say that you have not the inclination ? ’ ‘ I will say what presents itself to me , and not what presents itself to you. ’ ‘ Say it then .
__label__1	‘ No , sir , ’ said Mr Venus , winking his weak eyes and shaking his head .
__label__0	It will be readily conceived that after an imprisonment of forty-seven days , in a dark and miserable tunnel it was with infinite delight that I breathed this saline air .
__label__1	When <NAME> came , we went and had lunch at a celebrated house which I then quite venerated , but now believe to have been the most abject superstition in <NAME> , and where I could not help noticing , even then , that there was much more gravy on the tablecloths and knives and waiters ' clothes , than in the steaks .
__label__1	It had been almost dark before , but now it seemed quite dark , and soon afterwards very dark .
__label__0	Perhaps it was not altogether surprising that he had almost forgotten him ; he had never seen him since the days of his youth , that time of life which , with a certain show of justice , has been termed the age of ingratitude ; for , in point of fact , the astronomer was none other than Professor <NAME> , <NAME> ’ s old science-master at the <NAME> Charlemagne .
__label__0	He found safe anchorage in <NAME> , where as usual , he made a careful hydrographical survey .
__label__1	At least , <NAME> asked me if I did not , and I said yes .
__label__0	If <NAME> is still living , he is living on the <NAME> shores. ’ “ ‘ Who are you ? ’ asked <NAME> .
__label__1	I never thought he 'd a done it under a gold watch , chain , and seals , at the lowest .
__label__0	`` And <NAME> , the president , '' howled <NAME> .
__label__0	`` In the house in the corral ! ''
__label__1	A desolate air of utter and complete loneliness fell upon him , like a visible shade .
__label__1	I ’ m not indeed , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	A month ’ s notice terminates my tenancy .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> journeys to <NAME> and meets with a romantic Adventure with a middle-aged Lady in yellow Curl-papers 23 .
__label__1	I have a presentiment that if no other innocent atonement is made for this , it will one day be required of him .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> arrived , surrounded by a large staff of <NAME> officers .
__label__1	It was unavailing ; he extended his arm towards them , and made another violent effort .
__label__0	<NAME> began making a great hubbub when he found that they were burning some of the spars of the <NAME> ; but he was effectually silenced by <NAME> , who told him that if he made any more fuss , he should be compelled to pay 50,000 francs for a balloon-ticket , or else he should be left behind .
__label__1	and yonder the captain himself .
__label__0	I was , therefore , quite right in that part of my conjecture .
__label__1	That _is_ his knock , ma ’ am , no doubt. ’ He stepped to the window ; and looking out , and drawing in his head again , confirmed himself with , ‘ Yes , ma ’ am .
__label__1	‘ Come here , you sir , ’ said the dwarf .
__label__1	‘ But people think more of it than people think. ’ <NAME> returned , with an uncomfortable feeling in so very slight a courtesy being unusual , <NAME> that all !
__label__0	But , upon hearing these words falling , as it seemed , from the sky , the sheik dismounted and prostrated himself in the dust of the highway , where the doctor had to leave him , finding it impossible to divert him from his adoration .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> at once lighted a fire , singing all the time , according to his wont , a snatch of an old military refrain .
__label__0	The brave honest sailor was not content when the workmen were not at the dockyard .
__label__1	That is what it means .
__label__0	<NAME> was then the extent of knowledge possessed by every <NAME> on the subject , and of which no one could decently profess ignorance .
__label__0	118 degrees 6 minutes , he built on the banks of Winter River a wooden house , which he called <NAME> .
__label__0	The cart had been left outside under the charge of <NAME> and <NAME> , who had been prudently tied to it .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> listens , starts from his chair , and catches a young fellow in his arms , exclaiming : ‘ My dear Edwin ! ’ ‘ My dear Jack !
__label__0	He did not know how to prepare the roots , and , besides , had no fire .
__label__1	She ’ ll work at them clothes , as must be made ; and I hope her troubles will begin to seem longer ago than they was , wen she finds herself once more by her rough but loving uncle. ’ My aunt nodded confirmation of this hope , and imparted great satisfaction to <NAME> .
__label__1	Well , well ; it is not so difficult , you see , to tell me , after all .
__label__1	You must follow him , Sam. ’ ‘ <NAME> ’ nly , <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> .
__label__0	In fine , he was a <NAME> without the growling , and a perfect pattern of constant good-humor .
__label__1	He had not miscalculated the effect then !
__label__1	Without disclosing the precise nature of the documents that had fallen into <NAME> ’ s hands , <NAME> had confided the general outline of that story to Mr Meagles , to whom she had also recounted his fate .
__label__1	<NAME> officers are not so well paid that they can afford to refuse any little extra fee , when it comes to them in a civil and proper manner . '
__label__1	‘ Twenty minutes past two , <NAME> , I set your watch at .
__label__1	My trade is not of that kind that I need be roused from bed .
__label__0	<NAME> , meeting with so decided a will , consented , but the poor <NAME> , who had received the name of <NAME> , soon faded away and died at <NAME> .
__label__1	We had a doleful parting , and when I took my place by <NAME> 's side , I felt that that was my place henceforth while he lived .
__label__0	My uncle enjoyed during his lifetime all the glory he deserved ; and he was even offered a large sum of money , by <NAME> , to exhibit himself in the <NAME> ; while I am credibly informed by a traveler that he is to be seen in waxwork at <NAME> 's !
__label__0	The next day , the 17th of April , the sailor ’ s first words were addressed to <NAME> .
__label__0	“ Will you reply ? ” repeated <NAME> .
__label__0	Nothing but vast beds of glistering lava , now rough like immense piles of scoriae and clinker , now smooth like crystal mirrors , and reflecting the <NAME> 's rays with the same intolerable glare .
__label__1	‘ Much more than for any other .
__label__0	These words restored to <NAME> that self-possession which he had lost in a moment of discouragement on feeling his great responsibility .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> replied that the honour would be his ; and the detective -- who was determined not to lose sight of him -- begged permission to accompany them in their walk about <NAME> -- a request which <NAME> readily granted .
__label__1	For some years he continued a deadly foe to <NAME> , protesting that he had a better opinion of him when he was supposed to have stolen the five-pound note , than when he was shown to be perfectly free of the crime ; inasmuch as his guilt would have had in it something daring and bold , whereas his innocence was but another proof of a sneaking and crafty disposition .
__label__1	Then I go among the <NAME> .
__label__0	Some readers saw in it only one of those prodigious outbursts of <NAME> humbug , which would exceed the limits of puffism if the depths of human credulity were not unfathomable .
__label__1	I would ask you to believe that he has a heart he very , very seldom reveals , and that there are deep wounds in it .
__label__0	They could , therefore , without inconvenience , wait until the next day to resume operations ; but , as to the vessel itself , she was doomed , and it would be best to hasten to save the remains of her hull , as she would not be long in disappearing in the quicksands of the channel .
__label__1	I can stand any fire better than a fire of cross questions .
__label__0	<NAME> was perfect silence ; but the thick padding was enough to intercept all sounds coming from the earth .
__label__0	But the idea of a war machine fell before the declaration of <NAME> .
__label__1	You can ’ t hold me. ’ ‘ Tell me in a word , <NAME> ! ’ His eyes were fixed again , and the only word that came from his lips was the word millions of times repeated .
__label__0	Henceforth he resolved to make all the reparation he could for the injustice of which his old comrade had been the victim .
__label__1	‘ Is the <NAME> in his room , <NAME> ? ’ inquired <NAME> , offering his box with all imaginable courtesy .
__label__1	If one forlorn wanderer then pacing the dark streets , could have heard her innocent disclosure , and could have seen the drops of pity kissed away by her husband from the soft blue eyes so loving of that husband , he might have cried to the night -- and the words would not have parted from his lips for the first time -- “ God bless her for her sweet compassion ! ” <NAME> .
__label__1	Dear me , that 's not a common name , <NAME> , is it ?
__label__1	“ You have a child ; I have none .
__label__0	“ Perhaps he would walk if his feet were unfastened , ” said <NAME> .
__label__0	It appears that he got as far as <NAME> , the capital , where , according to some accounts , he was made prisoner , and , according to others , was put to death for having attempted to ascend a sacred mountain in the environs .
__label__1	She resides with me again .
__label__1	That is , in the long run .
__label__0	In beholding every one happy around him , <NAME> forgot the anxieties which appeared to trouble his life .
__label__1	`` What could you have on your mind , you know !
__label__1	I rather think the gov ’ nor wants to have a word and a half with you , Sir. ’ <NAME> bestowed a look of intelligence on <NAME> , intimating that he understood he was not to say he had been sent for ; and beckoning him to approach , whispered briefly in his ear .
__label__1	If <NAME> will call on <NAME> at nine o ’ clock , <NAME> will have the pleasure of introducing <NAME> .
__label__1	It is not so unlike the Court of Chancery but that we may pass from the one scene to the other , as the crow flies .
__label__0	<NAME> came back , and stared at his companions .
__label__0	I accepted our trying lot composedly , always thinking , however , of my dear ones , remembering them every day in my prayers , though never hoping to see them again .
__label__0	These words were distinctly heard : -- `` <NAME> !
__label__1	The <NAME> , in course of time achieving what he feels to be due to himself in bringing to a dignified conclusion several quarrels he has on hand with the pastrycook ’ s men , announces breakfast .
__label__0	I passed a copper ring through their tails , and threw them back into the sea .
__label__0	It was necessary , therefore , to cut from it a piece equal in extent to the waterline of the <NAME> .
__label__1	He had heard from <NAME> ’ s own lips when he stood tapping at the door on that night of his taking the lodgings , that the marriage would have been on her part thoroughly mercenary .
__label__1	‘ Humph ! ’ retorted <NAME> , looking at the fire .
__label__1	I don ’ t complain of him. ’ As she said it , with her eyes upon the fire-glow , there was an instantaneous escape of distress into her face .
__label__0	The route to <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> ( countries already known through the wonderful narrative of <NAME> ) , viâ , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , was long and dangerous .
__label__1	‘ As silent a feller as myself .
__label__0	Forever deprived of the vivifying warmth of the sun , they were vapid and colorless .
__label__0	To this question there could be no answer .
__label__0	`` A very natural one , '' answered <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Do you know , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , cheerfully examining the dish , ‘ I think it is in consequence -- they are capital oysters , but I think it is in consequence -- of their never having been opened. ’ They never had been opened ; and we had no oyster-knives -- and couldn ’ t have used them if we had ; so we looked at the oysters and ate the mutton .
__label__1	It made a great impression on me , and I remembered it a long time afterwards ; as I shall have occasion to narrate when the time comes .
__label__1	‘ I believe , father , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ he will not come back to town to-night. ’ <NAME> turned away , and said no more .
__label__0	I am of <NAME> ’ s opinion , that the storm will be superb .
__label__1	Kiss me , <NAME> , as a promise that you will be reconciled to <NAME> -- to my dearest husband -- to the father of the little child who taught me to come back , <NAME> taught me to come back ! ’ As she clung closer to him , in another burst of tears , he kissed her on her lips , and , lifting up his eyes , said , ‘ Oh my God , forgive me , for I need it very much ! ’ With that he dropped his head again , lamenting over and caressing her , and there was not a sound in all the house for a long , long time ; they remaining clasped in one another ’ s arms , in the glorious sunshine that had crept in with <NAME> .
__label__0	I am talking of the <NAME> route as though it were a macadamized road , well kept , with mile-stones and `` This way to the <NAME> '' on a signpost !
__label__0	He was followed by a detachment of the men of the <NAME> , among whom was a midshipman of a <NAME> ship , M. de <NAME> , who was a volunteer aid of <NAME> .
__label__1	But try over and over again , nevertheless .
__label__1	'Compose yourself , <NAME> , and answer me distinctly .
__label__1	<NAME> alighted , took <NAME> by the hand , and they once again walked on .
__label__0	A dozen horsemen dashed forward , and the kibitka was surrounded .
__label__1	‘ Is my pa in , do you know ? ’ asked <NAME> with dignity .
__label__0	Doubtless it was the recollection of his first voyage round the world , so disastrously interrupted , which procured for him the distinction conferred upon him by the <NAME> .
__label__0	`` But tell me what he said !
__label__0	`` Good-night , '' said <NAME> , and he disappeared .
__label__0	The two men could not live in the midst of these successive abysses , and after several attempts they let themselves slide on one of the slopes of the hill .
__label__0	I , however , was very far from being in humor to discuss the matter .
__label__0	`` We shall not be able to reach the neutral point . ''
__label__1	She shared it with him ; and lingering on without pain , but without hope , her life ebbed slowly away .
__label__1	Hold the light. ’ Mr Venus takes from a corner by his chair , the bones of a leg and foot , beautifully pure , and put together with exquisite neatness .
__label__0	They were so well suited to this life , and were , besides , so accustomed to the island , that they could not have left its hospitable soil without regret !
__label__1	What you say now , gives me new heart. ’ She faltered , and burst into tears .
__label__0	The Indians have everything to gain by these intestine strifes , and can not lose such fine opportunities of plunder .
__label__1	`` Twice before , '' says <NAME> .
__label__1	We may be reckoning without our host in all this , ’ he added more cheerfully , ‘ and I trust , and almost believe we are .
__label__1	When she answered fervently , she well knew that , she never forgot it , he touched upon his second and more delicate point -- the suspicion he had formed .
__label__1	On the day when matters were concluded between <NAME> and <NAME> , we were all under engagement to dine at <NAME> 's house .
__label__1	cried <NAME> , 'What is it ? '
__label__1	When she had conveyed it to her bosom , Mr <NAME> had the appearance of feeling relieved , and breathing more freely , as not having been quite certain that the hundred pounds were his , until the note had been safely transferred out of Mr <NAME> ’ s keeping into his own <NAME> ’ s .
__label__1	The company consisted of the brothers <NAME> , <NAME> , a ruddy-faced white-headed friend of <NAME> ’ s ( who was a superannuated bank clerk ) , and <NAME> , who was presented to <NAME> ’ s sister with much gravity and solemnity .
__label__1	‘ Then p ’ raps you ’ ll give him Mrs <NAME> ’ s respects , and say that the next time he lowers himself and his lodgings by talking out of the winder she ’ ll thank him to come down and open the door too. ’ Mrs <NAME> spoke loud , and listened for any observations that might be offered from the first floor .
__label__1	But I didn ’ t , Mr Boffin , and I fell into it. ’ Without moving eye or finger , Mr <NAME> gave another nod , and placidly repeated , ‘ Quite so , Venus. ’ ‘ Not that I was ever hearty in it , sir , ’ the penitent anatomist went on , ‘ or that I ever viewed myself with anything but reproach for having turned out of the paths of science into the paths of -- ’ he was going to say ‘ villany , ’ but , unwilling to press too hard upon himself , substituted with great emphasis -- ‘ Weggery. ’ Placid and whimsical of look as ever , Mr <NAME> answered : ‘ <NAME> so , Venus. ’ ‘ And now , sir , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ having prepared your mind in the rough , I will articulate the details. ’ With which brief professional exordium , he entered on the history of the friendly move , and truly recounted it .
__label__1	'Not bad , any way , ' replied <NAME> with a smile .
__label__1	‘ I am convinced , my dear Amy , ’ said Mr Sparkler , ‘ that if ever there was a girl , next to your highly endowed and beautiful sister , who had no nonsense about her -- ’ ‘ We know all about that , <NAME> , ’ interposed <NAME> .
__label__0	A great crowd was collected in <NAME> and the neighbouring streets on Saturday evening ; it seemed like a multitude of brokers permanently established around the <NAME> .
__label__1	His arms are swelled because of being bound so tight , his wooden shoes are large and clumsy , and he is lame .
__label__0	<NAME> smoked a good pipe of tobacco , and from time to time the old couple spoke of <NAME> , of their boy , of <NAME> , and wondered how they liked their trip to the surface of the earth .
__label__1	I have been superseded as to some slight intentions I had , and I may say that I have now to begin life. ’ Not very well knowing how to get rid of this applicant , and feeling the more embarrassed because his manner and appearance claimed a delicacy in which the worthy Mr <NAME> feared he himself might be deficient , that gentleman glanced into the mouldy little plantation or cat-preserve , of <NAME> ’ s <NAME> , as it was that day , in search of a suggestion .
__label__1	‘ You won ’ t see such boys as those very often , I think , ’ said Mr Crummles .
__label__1	which he propounded with a sense of its importance , in itself so edifying and improving as to give it quite an orthodox air .
__label__1	‘ There may be , in the coffee-room. ’ MAY BE .
__label__0	It was rare that any one was `` accepted '' before this lapse of time .
__label__0	As to <NAME> , he retained his tarantass , which was not much the worse for its journey across the <NAME> ; and he had only to harness three good horses to it to take him swiftly over the road to <NAME> .
__label__0	The blackboard was placed in an angle of the room on an easel of polished oak , well in the light of one of the windows which opened on to the garden .
__label__1	The words have probably been repeated several times , for they are ringing in her head before she begins to understand them .
__label__1	After half an hour ’ s cooling in the churchyard , I saw the chariot coming back .
__label__0	Almost at the same moment , fresh reports resounded from the <NAME> station , to which the second boat was rapidly approaching .
__label__1	‘ Well , it ’ s not so much a trembling , ’ was the answer— ‘ though they do quiver—as a complete derangement of the nervous system .
__label__0	“ This will never be finished ! ” said <NAME> , brandishing his dagger , red with blood .
__label__1	‘ You were always a favourite of hers , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ always were from the first .
__label__1	The law-stationer 's establishment is , in <NAME> 's eyes , a temple of plenty and splendour .
__label__1	Seeing that <NAME> now glanced anxiously at my aunt again , I reminded him of the second and last point to which he had adverted .
__label__0	<NAME> eagerly agreed to this , and the captive inca despatched the necessary orders at once to all the provinces ; these were carried out promptly and unmurmuringly .
__label__1	‘ I don ’ t know , ’ replied <NAME> , in the same tone .
__label__1	<NAME> , that I express no opinion , one way or other , on the trust I undertake .
__label__1	The lady was at the farther end of the room , and once she ventured to wave her hand , as if beseeching my uncle ’ s assistance .
__label__1	If I consulted merely my own interests with <NAME> , I should not be here .
__label__0	Leaving these people with gilded teeth , <NAME> took the great road which conveys all the traffic between <NAME> and <NAME> , and passed by <NAME> , where a market is held three times a week , which attracts merchants from the most distant countries .
__label__1	‘ Still , so it was , ’ continued Mrs. Micawber .
__label__1	Now , a tall church spire appeared in view , which presently became a tree , a barn , a shadow on the ground , thrown on it by their own bright lamps .
__label__0	Mad with rage , he tore along over verst after verst with the speed of an express train , lashing his sides with his tail , seeking by the rapidity of his pace an alleviation of his torture .
__label__1	I never did take anything from any one .
__label__1	The mother laid her work upon the table , and put her hand up to her face .
__label__1	That 's a nice innocent place to live in , ai n't it ? ''
__label__1	‘ There , ’ said <NAME> , holding the door open , and looking triumphantly round at <NAME> , ‘ there ’ s a room ! ’ <NAME> ’ s face , however , betokened such a very trifling portion of satisfaction at the appearance of his lodging , that <NAME> looked , for a reciprocity of feeling , into the countenance of <NAME> , who , until now , had observed a dignified silence .
__label__1	He lay , that night , at a cottage , where beds were let at a cheap rate to the more humble class of travellers ; and , rising betimes next morning , made his way before night to <NAME> .
__label__0	“ At any rate , since we must leave <NAME> for a long expedition , I think the ‘ Bonadventure ’ will be safer here during our absence , and we shall do best to leave her here until the island is rid of these blackguards. ” “ That is exactly my opinion , ” said the reporter .
__label__1	Following them , he discovered , to his surprise , that they repaired to various low lodging-houses , and taverns kept by broken gamblers , to more than one of whom <NAME> was known , and that they were in pursuit -- so he found by inquiries when they had left -- of an old woman , whose description exactly tallied with that of deaf Mrs Sliderskew .
__label__0	<NAME> , much moved by these tokens of friendship , formed the design of founding an establishment on this island .
__label__1	‘ Now , <NAME> dear , ’ said <NAME> in due course , ‘ the salad ’ s ready , and it ’ s past supper-time. ’ Mrs <NAME> rose , but remained speechless .
__label__1	This had better be the end of it .
__label__1	He passed his handkerchief across his forehead , took off his spectacles , wiped them , and put them on again ; and his voice had recovered its wonted softness of tone when he said -- ‘ What have you there , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Called at the post-office just now , and found this here letter , as has laid there for two days , ’ replied <NAME> .
__label__0	`` Suffer me to finish , '' he calmly continued .
__label__0	Our gestures sufficiently indicated the different roads each wished to follow -- and which each tried to influence the other to undertake .
__label__1	The bewildered butler gazed from them towards <NAME> , and from <NAME> towards <NAME> , with a most ludicrous mixture of fear and perplexity .
__label__1	‘ Here I am , sir. ’ ‘ And our friend of the perspiring brow is at the far corner there ?
__label__1	Did I say we could depend upon no better man ?
__label__0	He must go and wake him .
__label__0	The natives of various portions of the empire appeared in their distinctive costumes and exhibited the different productions of their provinces .
__label__0	“ No , your Lordship , ” said the captain in a firm tone , “ I must be alone with my men .
__label__0	But the accursed animal swam at the same speed .
__label__1	I had a delightful letter from her , only this morning. ’ ‘ And in short , my dear friend , ’ said I , ‘ you feel as blest as you deserve to feel ! ’ ‘ Oh !
__label__1	The stranger had left his hat in Mr Witherden ’ s room , and seemed to have established himself in this short interval on quite a friendly footing .
__label__1	You shall see her tomorrow night .
__label__1	Mr Witherden the notary , too , regarded him with a friendly eye ; and even Mr Chuckster would sometimes condescend to give him a slight nod , or to honour him with that peculiar form of recognition which is called ‘ taking a sight , ’ or to favour him with some other salute combining pleasantry with patronage .
__label__1	Oliver knew this too well ; but thinking it might be dangerous to express his feelings more openly , he only sighed , and went on with his boot-cleaning .
__label__1	And I said again , `` I ca n't help it , <NAME> . ''
__label__1	‘ The only question is , whether the gentleman , being on the ground , must not be considered , as a matter of form , to be the individual who insulted our friend , <NAME> , yesterday evening , whether he is really that individual or not ; ’ and having delivered this suggestion , with a very sage and mysterious air , the man with the camp-stool took a large pinch of snuff , and looked profoundly round , with the air of an authority in such matters .
__label__1	‘ You ’ re a good fellow , <NAME> , ’ said the host , grasping his hand .
__label__1	The <NAME> customer paid for what he had had , perplexedly counted his change , and asked , as a stranger , to be directed towards the <NAME> .
__label__0	But time marched on ; weeks went by like days , days like hours , hours like minutes .
__label__1	‘ At the apartment of your son .
__label__0	The settlers went to the <NAME> to take some pickaxes , iron-tipped spears , string made of fibers , flint and steel ; they then returned to the plateau , Top accompanying them .
__label__1	His protestations had gradually become less and less vehement as they proceeded in their search without making any discovery ; and , now , he gave vent to several very grim laughs , and confessed it could only have been his excited imagination .
__label__1	‘ Take care of the last step , <NAME> .
__label__0	`` 'Only , ' added he , 'it was not on the west coast , but on the east coast of <NAME> that the vessel was lost ; and if <NAME> is still living , as his document indicates , he is a prisoner among the natives , and it is on the other coast that he must be looked for . '
__label__1	' I have seen the gentleman , ' replied <NAME> , scarcely able to articulate , 'the gentleman who was so good to me -- <NAME> , that we have so often talked about . '
__label__0	It was explored thus to the very summit of the truncated cone terminating the first row of rocks , then to the upper ridge of the enormous hat , at the bottom of which opened the crater .
__label__1	‘ As to understanding him , you are a cleverer fellow than most of us , <NAME> , if you can do that. ’ ‘ That ’ s true , indeed , ’ said I , moving my chair to the table .

__label__0	Ten , twenty , fifty , a hundred ? ''
__label__1	You shall tell her , Mr Clennam .
__label__1	“ Say you said that , and even <NAME> will probably betray surprise. ” “ There you quite mistake him , ” said I .
__label__1	At length he pushed his plate from him , and spoke aloud ; with the strangest inconsistency .
__label__0	This negro was a servant of the first-water , and he served his master as faithfully as he would have served a gun .
__label__1	At first they were faintly discernible in the mist , and above them the later stars still glimmered .
__label__0	“ I was going to tell you that he is traveling with all his family -- and jolly people they are , I assure you .
__label__1	I hope to meet your niece here presently. ’ ‘ Oh ! ’ said he , pondering .
__label__1	I should have been happy to have made <NAME> a prominent consideration , too , if the case had admitted of it ; but unfortunately it does not . ''
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> 's thoughts take such form as he looks at her , with his ragged grey eyebrows a hair 's breadth more contracted than usual under her gaze .
__label__0	Nearly all oblong or circular , and as if traced with the compass , they seem to form one vast archipelago , equal to that charming group lying between <NAME> and <NAME> , and which mythology in ancient times adorned with most graceful legends .
__label__0	We were in open sea ; but at a distance of about ten yards , on either side of the <NAME> , rose a dazzling wall of ice .
__label__1	‘ Was the boys sorry to see me in such a dreadful condition , <NAME> , or was they glad ? ’ asked <NAME> , in a sentimental manner .
__label__0	Early next morning , this handy little craft was sufficiently freighted with coal ( of which there was still about ten tons on board the <NAME> ) , and manned by nobody except the captain , the count , and the lieutenant , left the harbor of the <NAME> , much to the bewilderment of <NAME> , who had not yet been admitted into the secret .
__label__1	'Forgive me for saying so , but I wish you had . '
__label__0	The bears had crossed the blocks , and were mounting to the assault of the ship .
__label__1	‘ But he is one of that family from whom you took a nurse .
__label__1	I regularly take walks outside <NAME> ’ s house in the evening , though it cuts me to the heart to see the officers go in , or to hear them up in the drawing-room , where the eldest Miss <NAME> plays the harp .
__label__0	The crossing of <NAME> among hostile natives was terribly arduous .
__label__1	He feels very grateful to them for the interest they have in him , and for the kind promises they make ; but the power of speech is gone again , and he has much ado to keep his feet , even though leaning on his master ’ s arm .
__label__1	I laid her out ; and I must walk , you know .
__label__1	It was a dull evening , for <NAME> drew his wine , when it came round , quite as a matter of business , -- just as he might have drawn his salary when that came round , -- and with his eyes on his chief , sat in a state of perpetual readiness for cross-examination .
__label__0	Suddenly , without being able to account for it , he smelt an odour of boiling fat .
__label__1	<NAME> for some weeks backward and forward rush mysterious men with no names , who fly about all those particular parts of the country on which <NAME> is at present throwing himself in an auriferous and malty shower , but who are merely persons of a restless disposition and never do anything anywhere .
__label__1	I remember how I seemed to float , then , down the melancholy glory of that track upon the sea , away into the world of dreams .
__label__1	You make Mrs <NAME> ’ s a thankless task .
__label__1	`` I declare to you , <NAME> , that with anything short of this case that I have , I would as soon have hoped to root up by means of my own strength and my own hands the oldest tree on this estate as to shake your hold upon <NAME> and <NAME> 's trust and confidence in you .
__label__0	It occurred to me then that <NAME> was the name of the captain of the <NAME> , an <NAME> ship ; but what of that ?
__label__0	At a sign from Kai-Koumou , a warrior bent his steps toward Ware-Atoua .
__label__0	The bright moonlight showed them the President sitting up in his bed , his eye blazing , his arms waving , as he shouted in a tone reminding them of the day they had found him in <NAME> Helena wood .
__label__1	He never opened it without occasion .
__label__1	When the shadow of the church-porch swallowed them up , victorious Gruff and <NAME> likewise presented himself to be swallowed up .
__label__0	<NAME> , now perceiving that the projectile was steadily approaching the lunar disc , did not despair ; if not of reaching her , at least of discovering the secrets of her configuration .
__label__1	The warm blaze alone defied it , and leaped and sparkled merrily .
__label__0	The admiral put to sea again , and sailed along the southern coast of <NAME> for about one hundred and fifty miles .
__label__0	But their eyes saw nothing but large plains with no trace of a building .
__label__1	Her grandson apologizes with `` True .
__label__1	He was a dreadful old man to look at , in a filthy flannel waistcoat , and smelling terribly of rum .
__label__1	Among them a most excellent Hospital—a quaker establishment , but not sectarian in the great benefits it confers ; a quiet , quaint old Library , named after <NAME> ; a handsome Exchange and <NAME> ; and so forth .
__label__1	Never , no , never once , in one unguarded moment from that time to the end , did any care for himself , any thought of his own comfort , any selfish consideration or regard distract his thoughts from the gentle object of his love .
__label__1	Please I don ’ t believe you are a hard-hearted miser at all , and please I don ’ t believe you ever for one single minute were ! ’ At this , <NAME> fairly screamed with rapture , and sat beating her feet upon the floor , clapping her hands , and bobbing herself backwards and forwards , like a demented member of some Mandarin ’ s family .
__label__0	The death of the great usurper was followed by the decadence of the empire .
__label__1	demanded <NAME> , pouring question upon question with great volubility .
__label__1	`` I do n't even know which ; but as I understand the way in which my dear <NAME> ( always remarkable for her practical good sense and clearness ) puts this case , I should imagine it was chiefly a question of money , do you know ? ''
__label__1	‘ Come there ! ’ Mrs <NAME> was proud of the title <NAME> , which she regarded as signifying : not so much <NAME> of the house , as <NAME> of the <NAME> tongue .
__label__0	In 11 degrees 30 minutes he discovers land , which he imagines must be the commencement of <NAME> .
__label__1	This was all so pleasant that I hope it made me still more like the mountain than I had been before .
__label__1	'Suppose that lad , ' pursued <NAME> , 'was to peach -- to blow upon us all -- first seeking out the right folks for the purpose , and then having a meeting with 'em in the street to paint our likenesses , describe every mark that they might know us by , and the crib where we might be most easily taken .
__label__1	‘ It was summer-time ; and wrapped in his gloomy thoughts , he would issue from his solitary lodgings early in the evening , and wandering along a narrow path beneath the cliffs , to a wild and lonely spot that had struck his fancy in his ramblings , seat himself on some fallen fragment of the rock , and burying his face in his hands , remain there for hours -- sometimes until night had completely closed in , and the long shadows of the frowning cliffs above his head cast a thick , black darkness on every object near him .
__label__0	The lieutenant urged that he was the most experienced seaman , and as such was best qualified to take command of the sledge and the management of the sails ; and as it was not to be expected that <NAME> would resign his intention of going in person to relieve his fellow-countryman , <NAME> submitted his own wishes to the count .
__label__0	<NAME> tried to stop its course .
__label__1	‘ Yes , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Gone in and locked his door , ma ’ am. ’ <NAME> repressed a sigh as she gathered her work together for bed , and transfixed that part of her dress where her heart would have been if she had had the dress on , with a sharp , sharp needle .
__label__1	As <NAME> did happen to labour under the slight imputation of having bruised three or four boys to death already , it occurred to him that the board had , perhaps , in some unaccountable freak , taken it into their heads that this extraneous circumstance ought to influence their proceedings .
__label__1	`` Now , do n't open your mouth too wide , because you do n't look handsome when you do it . ''
__label__0	The old man , wishing to redouble his politeness , tried to give him pieces already chewed , and one can easily imagine that the disgust of our captain increased . ''
__label__1	‘ Your father is not on duty at present , I think , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , sir , he comes on later in the afternoon. ’ Another twirl of the great hat , and then <NAME> said , rising , ‘ I am afraid I must wish you good day , sir. ’ ‘ So soon ?
__label__0	For a few days already a sharp frost had given warning of the approaching rigor of the <NAME> winter , and this evening it was especially severe .
__label__0	About three o ’ clock in the morning , however , the <NAME> noticed that the roots were beginning to graze the ground occasionally , and by sounding the depth of the water with a long branch , <NAME> found that they were getting on rising ground .
__label__1	The exertion this cost him , or the consciousness of talking in that feeble way , made his angry face so much more angry , and his thick veins so much thicker , when he spoke , that I am not surprised , on looking back , at this peculiarity striking me as his chief one .
__label__1	She hurried out to meet him ; and little Bob in his comforter -- he had need of it , poor fellow -- came in .
__label__0	Some day the coal-rooms of steamers and the tenders of locomotives will , instead of coal , be stored with these two condensed gases , which will burn in the furnaces with enormous calorific power .
__label__0	In fact , between <NAME> and Kamakore the very heavy rains of some previous weeks were retained by this shallow depression as in a water-tight bowl .
__label__0	“ A convict vessel is not disciplined like a man-of-war !
__label__0	Their hair , divided into a great number of small tresses , fell over their shoulders , and by means of black-and-blue incisions they had tattooed their cheeks from the temples to the mouth .
__label__1	My impression , certainly , has always been , that there was a mystery in the affair which she could explain if so inclined .
__label__1	Who is there you would wish to meet ?
__label__1	'For the love of <NAME> , ' said <NAME> solemnly , 'do not say that now , upon the very verge of death ; but tell me where they are .
__label__0	Was the captain 's tone of security feigned ?
__label__1	I walked up to where he was sitting , and said , ‘ How do you do , <NAME> ? ’ He was greatly fluttered by this unexpected address from a stranger , and replied , in his slow way , ‘ I thank you , sir , you are very good .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> , sir , where is my brother Ned ? ’ ‘ Gone out with <NAME> , about getting that unfortunate man into the hospital , and sending a nurse to his children , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	According to my idea , we must see in this appellation of the <NAME> Sea a translation of the <NAME> word ` <NAME> ' ; and if the ancients gave it that name , it was on account of the particular colour of its waters . ''
__label__0	Perhaps it will be a means of raising me in my own eyes ! ” “ Go , <NAME> , ” replied the engineer , who felt sure that a refusal would have deeply wounded the former convict , now become an honest man .
__label__0	I gazed for some time upon the void above .
__label__1	After that I occupied myself in making our room a little tidy and in coaxing a very cross fire that had been lighted to burn , which at last it did , quite brightly .
__label__1	We had better not say anything having the appearance of a remonstrance or condition ; it might not seem generous .
__label__1	<NAME> ’ t you better be seated ?
__label__0	The agitation caused by the <NAME> and <NAME> affair had subsided .
__label__1	Even when it had grown dusk , and the shadows of coming night made it more solemn still , the child remained , like one rooted to the spot , and had no fear or thought of stirring .
__label__0	The colonists halted near the lake , about half a mile from the mouth of <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ I think it is a knock at the door , ’ said <NAME> , as if there could be the smallest doubt of the fact .
__label__1	It ’ s well I ’ m quite prepared .
__label__1	'Now listen to me , ' said the dying woman aloud , as if making a great effort to revive one latent spark of energy .
__label__0	Then , after he saved <NAME> , it was interest .
__label__1	If he won ’ t listen to reason , we must do it against his will , and show him that we are determined to exert our authority .
__label__0	His combinations I knew now were useless , I having discovered the one only clue .
__label__1	‘ Well , <NAME> , well ! ’ said he , in an easy way though ill at ease with himself ‘ don ’ t be unhappy , don ’ t be reproachful. ’ ‘ I can not help being unhappy , but I do not mean to be reproachful .
__label__1	‘ Come in , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	However , I got dressed , darkly wiping my sanguinary face at intervals , and I said , “ Can I help you ? ” and he said “ No thankee , ” and I said “ Good afternoon , ” and he said “ Same to you. ” When I got into the courtyard , I found <NAME> waiting with the keys .
__label__1	But I can not bear it. ’ ‘ It ’ s my belief you hate the sight of the very river. ’ ‘ I -- I do not like it , father. ’ ‘ As if it wasn ’ t your living !
__label__0	“ No , <NAME> , ” said the engineer , restraining his courageous servant .
__label__0	“ <NAME> ! ” exclaimed a third time the brave young girl , in a voice to which hate had added ten-fold strength .
__label__0	To give these poor Indians an adequate idea of his power , <NAME> called out his soldiers , and put them through their drill , he also ordered the discharge of some pieces of artillery , the noise of which froze the hearts of the savages with terror .
__label__1	Mr Pitt in a nightcap and bedgown , and without his boots , represented the poet <NAME> with perfect exactness ; and <NAME> of <NAME> in a dark wig , white shirt-collar , and male attire , was such a complete image of <NAME> that the young ladies quite screamed when they saw it .
__label__0	“ The lake will cover us , ” said <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> coasting along this shore no sign of habitation had been perceived -- not a pirogue left the shore .
__label__1	the other man seemed to answer ; 'could I mistake him , think you ?
__label__0	“ Nothing can be more simple , ” answered the judge .
__label__0	`` It _sounds_ like <NAME> , I 'd say to myself , '' continued the <NAME> , `` but I _know_ it 's <NAME> , and by and by , when this whirring goes out of my head , I shall easily understand it . ''
__label__0	The bed was often obstructed by long weeds , and even by pointed rocks , which rendered the navigation very difficult .
__label__1	The despairing way in which my mother and I look at each other , as I blunder on , is truly melancholy .
__label__0	<NAME> was established , and from the morrow a regular and abundant traffic commenced , which supplied the ships with the fresh provisions needed by the crews .
__label__0	<NAME> was the situation of these lonely men lost in the snow , enclosed in this vault with its walls rapidly thickening under the snow-fall .
__label__0	<NAME> was nominated in his place .
__label__0	`` If , '' he adds , `` the superiority of a civilized to a savage life could ever be called in question , a single glance at one of these Indians would be sufficient to settle the question .
__label__1	We are not ignorant , sir , ’ said <NAME> , slowly shaking his little head again , ‘ down in our part of the country , of your fame .
__label__0	Thus there were no costly materials , no platinum , no retorts , no combustibles , no delicate machinery to produce the two gases separately .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> ’ s coarse and insulting behaviour on the occasion in question had produced a deep impression on his mind ; a strong suspicion of his having led him on to pursue <NAME> for purposes of his own , had been lurking there for some time ; he was really ashamed of his share in the transaction , and deeply mortified by the misgiving that he had been gulled .
__label__1	<NAME> to the Institution for the <NAME> in <NAME> ? ’ ‘ I have seen it. ’ ‘ Well !
__label__0	“ In fact , ” said <NAME> , “ it ’ s a whale that we have harpooned ; and we ’ re only doing just what whalemen do when out fishing. ” But a change in the nature of the ground compelled the doctor to vary his style of locomotion .
__label__0	They would advance beyond the eighty-fourth parallel .
__label__1	She has lots of expensive knowledge , sir , political and otherwise .
__label__1	It being a cold night , the <NAME> wore his hat , as , indeed , was often his custom within doors .
__label__0	I sought them greedily , and ferreted them out indefatigably , and I have been able to bring together some objects of great value .
__label__1	It was <NAME> , <NAME> . ''
__label__0	That officer , a man of feeling , and ashamed of the treatment to which <NAME> was exposed , wished to strike off his chains ; but <NAME> refused .
__label__0	That is a complete account of all that has been done in these regions during the last fifteen years ; and since the return of the <NAME> , no ship has ventured among these dangerous waters ! ''
__label__0	Their object being well known , they had the best wishes of every hand on the road .
__label__1	‘ Yes , I think it ’ ll do , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	cried Monks , in a voice which , from its very suppression , seemed only the more furious .
__label__1	In the best room were two oil portraits of the kit-cat size , representing the landlord and his infant son ; both looking as bold as lions , and staring out of the canvas with an intensity that would have been cheap at any price .
__label__1	<NAME> , <NAME> , please , forgive me quite ! ’ Half laughing at him and half crying to him , <NAME> besought him in the prettiest manner ; in a manner so engaging and so playful and so natural , that her cherubic parent made a coaxing face as if she had never grown up , and said , ‘ What a silly little Mouse it is ! ’ ‘ But you do forgive me that , and everything else ; don ’ t you , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Yes , my dearest. ’ ‘ And you don ’ t feel solitary or neglected , going away by yourself ; do you , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Lord bless you !
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , aye ? ’ ‘ No , ’ said <NAME> , before I could reply .
__label__1	If I had been his wife , I could have been the slave of his caprices for a word of love a year .
__label__1	‘ Mr Dorrit will pardon me , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ if I remark that this is not a time or place for the pursuit of the present conversation .
__label__0	“ <NAME> , do you know the contents of this letter ? ” he asked .
__label__0	[ Illustration ] Having agreed on this , they waited for the time of action ; and during the following hours , <NAME> did not spare imprecations against a state of things in which , as he put it , `` there being men and bears concerned , the men were getting the worst of it . ''
__label__0	It was , as I have said , almost that of a sphinx , a dusky-hued sphinx , as though the matter which composed it had been oxidized by the inclemency of the polar climate .
__label__0	Besides , by listening to them , <NAME> had understood that there were fifty on board .
__label__1	‘ It ’ s the second floor , <NAME> , ’ said the same voice ; ‘ what a stupid thing you are !
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> ’ s admiration seemed to increase her perplexity .
__label__1	‘ A kind office , ’ said the little gentleman , nodding to <NAME> as she curtseyed to him .
__label__1	As the words were spoken , they passed through the wall , and stood upon an open country road , with fields on either hand .
__label__1	What is the cause of this here ? ’ ‘ Would these two travellers make much difference to the horses , if we took them with us ? ’ asked his mistress , offering no reply to the philosophical inquiry , and pointing to <NAME> and the old man , who were painfully preparing to resume their journey on foot .
__label__1	Sometimes my aunt and <NAME> were invited to do so , and accepted the invitation .
__label__1	Is it coming on you , <NAME> ?
__label__0	It was at this time falling into ruins , and every discharge of cannon did evident damage .
__label__0	“ My hand does it so naturally , and one ’ s hand is never mistaken ! ” “ Then can the convicts have been on board ? ” asked <NAME> .
__label__1	“ Is this a cut ? ” said <NAME> .
__label__0	Can not the eyes of Kai-Koumou read hearts ? ” And pointing to <NAME> : “ That is your wife ? ” he said .
__label__1	<NAME> times a day , his noiseless little feet went up the stairs to his own room , as he collected every book , and scrap , and trifle that belonged to him , and put them all together there , down to the minutest thing , for taking home !
__label__1	‘ You appear to feel it so , ’ rejoined <NAME> , smiling at the clerk , who was literally red-hot .
__label__1	I can say that , with a true and honest heart , any way .
__label__0	Amongst the works of modern painters were pictures with the signatures of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , etc .
__label__1	‘ Very sad , is it not ? ’ returned <NAME> .
__label__0	I feel like a starving prisoner , '' he said , rubbing his yellow and shivering hands together .
__label__1	<NAME> was many miles too near , and we reached it many hours too soon ; but <NAME> came to himself a little short of it , and said , ‘ You must come in , <NAME> , and rest ! ’ and I consenting , we had sandwiches and wine-and-water .
__label__1	<NAME> here , <NAME> , <NAME> .
__label__0	But , perhaps , he was wrong not to follow the watercourse , as he and <NAME> had done on their first excursion , for after walking an hour not a creature had shown itself .
__label__0	Still , no one of these men raised a single objection , nor suggested prudence .
__label__1	He was the first to speak , and he spoke thus : ‘ Yes .
__label__1	He replied to their salutations in the same way ; but bestowed no closer recognition until he reached the further end of the alley ; when he stopped , to address a salesman of small stature , who had squeezed as much of his person into a child 's chair as the chair would hold , and was smoking a pipe at his warehouse door .
__label__1	I know I did this selfishly , to have my name brought before her ; but I tried to believe it was an act of justice to his memory .
__label__0	“ <NAME> is all right , <NAME> -- so much so , in fact , that I hope in a month or six weeks -- ” “ To marry her , <NAME> ? ” “ Jack , you don ’ t know what you are talking about ! ” “ Ah , that ’ s very likely ; but I know quite well what I shall do. ” “ What will you do ? ” “ <NAME> her myself , if you don ’ t ; so look sharp , ” laughed <NAME> .
__label__1	Being out of breath when she came up with it , she was unable to make him hear .
__label__1	Almost as dull as the infernal old jail .
__label__1	`` It is so , little one . ''
__label__1	I wish you well and happy ! ” As I put my glass to my lips , he glanced with surprise at the end of his neckerchief , dropping from his mouth when he opened it , and stretched out his hand .
__label__1	All this was food for my secret mirth , and I laughed behind the white handkerchief which I held up to my face , as we rode home , till the tears came into my eyes .
__label__1	This flower-pot and stand , she bought herself .
__label__0	A month passed away , but <NAME> found no opportunity of getting at the information he had pledged himself to gain .
__label__0	But I knew the plan , and by its means I discovered the presence of firedamp and consequently that of a new seam of coal in the <NAME> pit. ” All that the old overman had related of the so-called “ monk ” or “ fireman ” was perfectly true .
__label__1	I had the paragraph here somewhere -- but I don ’ t know -- oh , yes , here it is. ’ So saying , <NAME> , after pretending that he thought he must have lost it , produced a square inch of newspaper from the pocket of the pantaloons he wore in private life ( which , together with the plain clothes of several other gentlemen , lay scattered about on a kind of dresser in the room ) , and gave it to <NAME> to read : ‘ The talented Vincent Crummles , long favourably known to fame as a country manager and actor of no ordinary pretensions , is about to cross the <NAME> on a histrionic expedition .
__label__0	`` I mean , '' said <NAME> in a decided tone , `` I mean that our deviation is owing solely to our meeting with this erring body . ''
__label__0	But we have nothing , nothing ! ''
__label__0	<NAME> was found in large quantities in the houses , made up into the form of tents , one of these containing as much as 11,000 pounds of the material .
__label__1	<NAME> ’ t suppose that I complain about that , because I always said to myself , “ It is very natural ; poor dear <NAME> is making his way in the world , and has a wife to tell his cares and troubles to , and children now to play about him , so God bless him and them , and send we may all meet together one day where we shall part no more. ” But what do you think , <NAME> , ’ said the miniature painter , brightening up and clapping her hands , ‘ of that very same brother coming up to <NAME> at last , and never resting till he found me out ; what do you think of his coming here and sitting down in that very chair , and crying like a child because he was so glad to see me -- what do you think of his insisting on taking me down all the way into the country to his own house ( quite a sumptuous place , <NAME> , with a large garden and I don ’ t know how many fields , and a man in livery waiting at table , and cows and horses and pigs and I don ’ t know what besides ) , and making me stay a whole month , and pressing me to stop there all my life -- yes , all my life -- and so did his wife , and so did the children -- and there were four of them , and one , the eldest girl of all , they -- they had named her after me eight good years before , they had indeed .
__label__1	They expected me home before <NAME> ; but had no idea of my returning so soon .
__label__0	“ We are too rich ! ” exclaimed <NAME> , “ But what are we going to do with all this ? ” And every moment burst forth the hurrahs of the delighted sailor when he caught sight of the barrels of gunpowder , firearms and sidearms , balls of cotton , implements of husbandry , carpenter ’ s , joiner ’ s , and blacksmith ’ s tools , and boxes of all kinds of seeds , not in the least injured by their short sojourn in the water .
__label__1	‘ I am glad to hope that there is nobody to blame for this one , -- nobody to answer for it. ’ ‘ Ha ! ’ said he ; ‘ that ’ s a comfortable reflection .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> was of the same opinion .
__label__1	I did not enjoy the delight of seeing the wit who indited the paragraph in question , but I have no doubt he is a prodigious man in his way , and held in high repute by a select circle .
__label__1	It began to be said , among these shrewd observers , that <NAME> , of <NAME> ’ s , was looking about him to see what he was worth ; and that he was calling in his money at a good time , like the long-headed fellow he was ; and bets were even offered on the <NAME> that <NAME> was going to marry a rich widow .
__label__1	This preliminary proceeding laying bare his head , the expert lady , clasping him tightly round the throat with one hand , inflicted a shower of blows ( dealt with singular vigour and dexterity ) upon it with the other .
__label__1	The agitation and the indignation from which I have recently suffered have been too much for me .
__label__1	Then a vote of thanks was moved to the mayor for his able conduct in the chair ; and the mayor , devoutly wishing that he had had a chair to display his able conduct in ( for he had been standing during the whole proceedings ) , returned thanks .
__label__0	In spite of all this , the admiral , who never forgot the principal object of his mission in these new countries , had succeeded in establishing regular intercourse with the natives .
__label__1	Her feelings were so much excited on the occasion , that she found it indispensable to afford them this relief , even without having the comfort of any audience or sympathy whatever .
__label__1	His telling her of the glorious state that Mr <NAME> kept , and of the court that bowed before him , naturally brought him to Mrs Merdle .
__label__0	The country being rich , the town is so likewise , for it is in the center of fruitful mines .
__label__0	By his marriage with <NAME> , daughter of <NAME> de <NAME> , proveditore of the fortifications of <NAME> , he had several children , and amongst them <NAME> , who first reached <NAME> by doubling the Cape of <NAME> , and <NAME> , who accompanied him in that memorable expedition .
__label__0	I have it now : ‘ Lovers should , whoe ’ er they be , <NAME> in all simplicity. ’ But what next ?
__label__1	'Come near the fire , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
__label__1	For I conscientiously believed , dancing-master 's wife though she was , and dancing-mistress though in her limited ambition she aspired to be , she had struck out a natural , wholesome , loving course of industry and perseverance that was quite as good as a mission .
__label__1	Thus it was that between seven and eight o ’ clock one evening , he and <NAME> found themselves in the <NAME> ’ s Head booking-office , securing a place to <NAME> Bridge by the next morning ’ s coach .
__label__1	They resumed their journey ; and certainly the prospect before them was by no means encouraging .
__label__0	Five minutes afterward , and the horses were swimming ; the current alone carried them along with tremendous force , and with a swiftness equal to their fastest gallop ; they must have gone fully twenty miles an hour .
__label__1	If what you have got to say _can_ be said before a born lady , this lady will stay where she is. ’ ‘ Sir , I hope I never had nowt to say , not fitten for a born lady to year , sin ’ I were born mysen ’ , ’ was the reply , accompanied with a slight flush .
__label__1	The idea of being a kind of a widow , and never having been married !
__label__0	`` You must know , <NAME> , that my master is an honest man , and that , when he makes a wager , he tries to win it fairly ! ''
__label__1	This affords charming food for contemplation .
__label__1	And now to see him after all , and in a prison too !
__label__0	Harding made arrangements , therefore , for living in the corral , of which the provisions would last for a tolerable length of time .
__label__1	“ So _you_ put him in his coffin ? ” “ Who took him out of it ? ” <NAME> leaned back in his chair , and stammered , “ What do you mean ? ” “ I mean , ” said <NAME> , “ that he war n't never in it .
__label__1	‘ That ’ s injury enough. ’ ‘ I wish I could undo it , James. ’ ‘ I wish you could and would. ’ During this conversation , <NAME> had looked from one brother to the other , with pain and amazement .
__label__0	It was the amiable <NAME> , still very confused , who crept out of her retreat , though not without much persuasion , <NAME> encouraging her with most gracious words .
__label__0	`` The <NAME> , '' he says , `` have few slaves , go almost naked , and are always armed with bows and arrows .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> gave <NAME> a narrative of the voyage , and made him proud of his son and daughter .
__label__1	‘ Does she sing at all ? ’ I asked .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> was standing at his door , and as soon as <NAME> ’ s lamp announced the arrival of his former viewer he advanced to meet him .
__label__0	This decision was made by the council in solemn conclave , in which cries , objurgations , and menacing gestures were mingled with unexampled violence .
__label__1	Kiss me , Floy. ’ He had even a dislike , at such times , to the company of <NAME> , and was well pleased when she strolled away , as she generally did , to pick up shells and acquaintances .
__label__1	I lay myself open to detection , I know .
__label__0	“ Let us take , for example , one of the words in the sentence we have just written -- my name , if you like .
__label__0	The <NAME> replied that his master was too great a king to submit to such an unreasonable demand .
__label__0	The guariba noiselessly approached , brandishing a study cudgel , which , wielded by his muscular arm , would have proved a formidable weapon .
__label__1	Those who were appointed of old to go to wicked kings and accuse them -- were they not ministers and servants ?
__label__0	`` Cast iron is very brittle , though , '' replied <NAME> .
__label__1	The gentleman had left <NAME> , but I think a messenger was sent after him to beg the favour of his waiting for me here. ” “ I was happy , ” said <NAME> , “ to be entrusted with the charge .
__label__0	Looking at it only from the side of <NAME> 's own interests , he evidently committed in this a gross blunder , of which he was soon to repent ; but if we consider , what we should never lose sight of , the interest of the country , he had already committed a capital crime in the acts of aggression of which he had been guilty , and in kindling civil war in face of an enemy quite ready to take advantage of it .
__label__0	There is nothing more to do here . ''
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> , after laughing cheerfully and clapping him on the shoulder , assists in these arrangements and helps to get the gallery into business order .
__label__0	All at once , the lad , who had strolled by the river , came running back , and , pointing up the <NAME> , exclaimed , -- `` What is floating there ? ''
__label__1	The watch found at the <NAME> was challenged by the jeweller as one he had wound and set for <NAME> , at twenty minutes past two on that same afternoon ; and it had run down , before being cast into the water ; and it was the jeweller ’ s positive opinion that it had never been re-wound .
__label__0	Three-quarters of an hour after leaving <NAME> , and still they had seen nothing !
__label__1	It may be a cheerful language .
__label__1	Night after night does this excellent man -- don ’ t frown , <NAME> ; I _will _say you _are _an excellent man -- come and sit here , for hours together , and it has not the least effect upon him. ’ Well , that is odd , ’ said <NAME> ; ‘ it ‘ ud have a wery considerable effect upon me , if I wos in his place ; I know that. ’ ‘ The fact is , my young friend , ’ said <NAME> solemnly , ‘ he has an obderrate bosom .
__label__0	T. <NAME> had exclaimed , “ Let us invent machines , let us find a fulcrum , and we will shift the axis of the <NAME> ! ” Many of you heard him , and will remember it .
__label__1	‘ Yes -- yes ; I almost forgot , I do declare. ’ ‘ I thought you were forgetting , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	As to <NAME> and me , whom he had wrapped up with great care , the night being sharp and frosty , we trembled from head to foot .
__label__1	Mr Toots and his wife had , in fact , just arrived there ; having been at the <NAME> ’ s to seek him , and having there obtained the address .
__label__0	He drew it towards him .
__label__0	Now , this note was dated six o'clock in the morning , and the active orang , accustomed to come frequently to the corral , had taken scarcely three quarters of an hour to cross the five miles which separated it from <NAME> .
__label__0	Here , then , was a fresh mystery .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> ’ s world was peopled with profligates , and he acted accordingly .
__label__1	At length , towards break of day , that deep sleep came upon her which succeeds to weariness and over-watching , and which has no consciousness but one of overpowering and irresistible enjoyment .
__label__1	`` What have you been thinking about , my dear ? ''
__label__0	The colonists ’ situation was desperate .
__label__1	When we had been there half an hour or so , the case in progress -- if I may use a phrase so ridiculous in such a connexion -- seemed to die out of its own vapidity , without coming , or being by anybody expected to come , to any result .
__label__0	<NAME> knew all the sailors in <NAME> , and immediately set about engaging a crew .
__label__1	Soon after nine o ’ clock we come to <NAME> , where we are to land ; and then comes the oddest part of the journey .
__label__1	I couldn ’ t say at this minute , sir , whether it ’ s two and two months , or whether it ’ s two and five months .
__label__0	<NAME> heard the street door shut once ; it was his new master going out .
__label__0	They looked at one another with terror .
__label__0	The <NAME> , rightly enough , had continued to occupy the fragment of <NAME> , and their claim was indisputable .
__label__1	On the table , and about the room , were the charts and maps on which the heavy-hearted Instrument-maker had again and again tracked the missing vessel across the sea , and on which , with a pair of compasses that he still had in his hand , he had been measuring , a minute before , how far she must have driven , to have driven here or there : and trying to demonstrate that a long time must elapse before hope was exhausted .
__label__0	But as every additional glass is an additional obstruction to the light , the object glass of a Lunar telescope is employed without a corrector ; light is thereby saved , and in viewing the <NAME> , as in viewing a map , it evidently makes very little difference whether we see her inverted or not .
__label__1	‘ Hallo ! ’ said <NAME> , ‘ who is that ? ’ ‘ He called to see my Governor this morning , ’ replied Mr Chuckster ; ‘ beyond that , I don ’ t know him from Adam. ’ ‘ At least you know his name ? ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	She listened with great attention , and with a face that often changed , but had the same purpose in all its varying expressions .
__label__1	'Him that I told the young lady of before . '
__label__0	<NAME> and <NAME> played together , while <NAME> had <NAME> for his partner .
__label__1	The man who could have any one he chose to dine with him , and who had made the money !
__label__0	Each time a company passed , <NAME> chuckled , and said to himself : `` Good !
__label__1	I would give them my aunt .
__label__0	His dispirited tone made a painful impression on the minds of his auditors .
__label__0	What can he be doing ? ''
__label__0	They uttered a cry like the braying of an ass , were about the size of a goose , slate-colour on the body , white beneath , with a yellow line round their throats ; they allowed themselves to be killed with a stone , never trying to escape .
__label__1	It seemed to escape his consideration that Mrs. Skimpole and the daughters remained behind to encounter the baker , but this was so old a story to all of them that it had become a matter of course .
__label__0	For the protection of the passengers it was proposed to erect a kind of wooden roof lined with strong cloth ; beneath this could be packed a supply of provisions , some warm furs , some cordials , and a portable stove to be heated by spirits of wine .
__label__1	There was no other orphan among us ; and I perceived ( here was the first disadvantage of not being a fool ) that they conciliated me in an insolent pity , and in a sense of superiority .
__label__0	Now , we already knew this land was not more than fifty miles from <NAME> .
__label__0	They had been accustomed to count upon the intervention of that power which existed no longer , and <NAME> , and even <NAME> , could not escape this impression .
__label__0	But though there might be no inconvenience in the enclosure being so far from <NAME> , it would not be the same with the poultry-yard , to which <NAME> called the attention of the colonists .
__label__1	`` Mrs. <NAME> has not the appearance , <NAME> , of a lady who has had two former husbands ? ''
__label__1	You turn a little to the right when you get to the end of the town ; it stands by itself , some little distance off the high road , with the name on a brass plate on the gate. ’ ‘ I know it , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	It seemed , at first , as if all that had happened since the days when these objects were familiar to her were the shadows of a dream , but gradually , as the objects became more real to her sight , the events became more real to her mind .
__label__1	she cried , in a hollow voice .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> ventured to go out with his gun in search of some game .
__label__0	He seized it and rapidly turned over its leaves , and his emaciated finger fixed itself on one of the pages .
__label__1	If they disclosed to me , as I suspect they did , that I should not come back , and that <NAME> was quite right , all I can say is , -- they were quite right too .
__label__0	Beyond the houses on the bank were in a blaze .
__label__0	A Scotchman would have said , “ His bonnet was a thocht ajee. ” It appeared formed of bare earth , here and there pierced by reddish rocks .
__label__0	During one of these excursions , <NAME> managed to get hold of two couples of living gallinaceæ .
__label__0	If you fail , it won ’ t matter much .
__label__0	The ships had sustained some damage , and fresh water was needed ; it was therefore urgent for them to find some harbour , which they succeeded in doing on the 10th of January , 1498 .
__label__1	So , he had been honourably dismissed to `` the office '' to begin the world again .
__label__1	‘ Thou seest this daughter of my dear dead brother !
__label__0	The <NAME> had again become more habitable , not only because the passages were warmed by the fire , but because the partitions of wood and mud had been re-established .
__label__1	It ’ s a topic that I wouldn ’ t touch upon , to any soul but you .
__label__1	Let some one hold him back .
__label__0	The thoughts of each one were about their situation .
__label__1	I have been no lover of this lady ’ s .
__label__0	`` And yet men have dared to come into these seas under sail alone !
__label__1	‘ Are you sure it is ? ’ ‘ Of course I am ! ’ ‘ I have forgotten , ’ said <NAME> , still turning the button round and round , ‘ what relation <NAME> is to you , you dear bad boy. ’ ‘ No blood-relation , ’ I replied ; ‘ but we were brought up together , like brother and sister. ’ ‘ I wonder why you ever fell in love with me ? ’ said <NAME> , beginning on another button of my coat .
__label__1	No personality is intended towards the name you will so soon change , when I remark that while the general growth of people seem to have come into existence , buds , I seem to have come into existence a chip .
__label__0	Ten warriors , armed to the teeth , kept watch at the door of Ware-Atoua .
__label__0	This was sugar of rather a reddish color , but nearly transparent and of a delicious taste .
__label__1	As there was a stream of people pouring into a shabby house not far from the entrance , he waited until they had made their way in , and then making up to the servant , ventured to inquire if he knew where <NAME> lived .
__label__1	`` I ask your pardon , sir , '' said <NAME> with a step backward .
__label__1	These household cares involve much pattening and counter-pattening in the backyard and considerable use of a pail , which is finally so happy as to assist in the ablutions of Mrs. Bagnet herself .
__label__1	‘ Ye-yes ; oh , yes , ’ replied <NAME> .
__label__1	It had by this time come on to rain very heavily , and there was a cold damp mist besides , which penetrated to the skin .
__label__0	One 's native land ! -- there should one live !
__label__0	The return of the birds indicated a diminution of the cold ; but it was not safe to rely upon this , for with a change of wind , or in the new or full moons , the temperature suddenly fell ; and the sailors were forced to resort to their most careful precautions to protect themselves against it .
__label__1	My Lady , '' in naming whom he always made a courtly gesture as if particularly to exclude her from any part in the quarrel , `` is expected , I believe , daily .
__label__1	He sat quietly looking at her ; but , with these appendages partially revealing themselves , and with a quantity of bristling oakum-coloured head and whisker , he had a formidable appearance .
__label__1	Trembling in every joint , from cold and exhaustion , he made an effort to stand upright ; but , shuddering from head to foot , fell prostrate on the ground .
__label__0	It covers seven tenths of the terrestrial globe .
__label__1	This coach is rather behind its time to-day , I guess .
__label__1	Have I been honourable , sir ? ’ ‘ Very , very ! ’ ‘ Will you tell <NAME> I ’ ve been honourable , sir ? ’ ‘ I will indeed. ’ ‘ There ’ s my hand , sir , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ and I ’ ll stand by you forever ! ’ After a hearty squeeze , he disappeared with the same cautious creak upon the stair , crept shoeless over the pavement of the yard , and , locking the gates behind him , passed out into the front where he had left his shoes .
__label__0	He went upon the stage , and took his place beside the rest who were to compose the base of the <NAME> of <NAME> .
__label__0	The <NAME> of <NAME> claim a man of the name of <NAME> as the founder of their race , favoured by the protection of the raven , first cause of all things .
__label__0	But the cordial relations with the viceroy were not lasting .
__label__0	But , on the other hand , in the eyes of disinterested or indifferent persons who were not affected by the event , what value could be assigned to this document ?
__label__0	Now , should they seize them with violence and master them by force ?
__label__0	The doctor wished to preserve his head for his collection of natural history , and his skin for future contingences , hence he prepared both by a rapid and economical process .
__label__0	After he had drunk , such weakness supervened that his eyes turned in his head , and he died so suddenly that we had not time to call the captain , who was in the other boat .
__label__1	Could the man <NAME> , in a moment of remorse , have divulged some secret conspiracy for his assassination ?
__label__1	Where does any one say I was seen ? ’ returned the girl , sullenly casting down her eyes .
__label__0	How many times they have struck the hours of prayer and the mass ! ''
__label__1	He was obviously very ill at ease , however .
__label__1	She told me that everything would be arranged for me by <NAME> , and that I should want for nothing , and gave me the kindest words and the best advice .
__label__1	‘ By your look. ’ He seemed very much amused , and laughed as heartily as it was in his nature to laugh .
__label__0	This apparently astounding acoustic mystery is easily explainable by simple natural laws ; it arose from the conductibility of the rock .
__label__1	Still , although I had no doubt that they were very beautiful , and very improving , and very sufficient for a great many purposes of life , and always remembered all through life , I did doubt whether <NAME> would not have profited by some one studying him a little , instead of his studying them quite so much .
__label__0	From the moment the envoy took the first step towards the princes , they all three rose , and remained standing until he reached the place pointed out to him -- an embroidered cloth , which distinguished him from the rest of the embassy .
__label__1	He tells her , in acknowledgment of her many subdued thanks , that she is very welcome , gives her good day , and walks away .
__label__1	This is the writing of <NAME> .
__label__1	The supper was ready laid , the chairs were drawn round the table , bottles , jugs , and glasses were arranged upon the sideboard , and everything betokened the approach of the most convivial period in the whole four-and-twenty hours .
__label__1	I brought him on purpose for you .
__label__1	More than once or twice , more than twice or thrice , say half a dozen times , he took his stick from the arm on which he nursed it , and hit a straight sharp rap at the air with its head .
__label__1	Why should I not ? ’ ‘ I thought , my dear , that perhaps your face might -- ’ ‘ My face might be a martyrdom , but what would that import , or who should know it , if I smiled ? ’ And she did smile ; manifestly freezing the blood of Mr <NAME> by so doing .
__label__1	<NAME> delivered himself up to the authorities , _but changed his mind and escaped_ ! ’ ‘ _Personal Encounter_ .
__label__1	Before our people 's time here , sir .
__label__1	It has not yet come to my sister ’ s knowledge that we have found it out , but we have .
__label__1	`` You seek to close these places on the <NAME> Day ? ''
__label__1	Every kind of finer tendon and ligament that is in the nature of poultry to possess is developed in these specimens in the singular form of guitar-strings .
__label__1	Her mild but earnest eyes met mine with their own beautiful frankness , and there was no change in her gentle face .
__label__0	At first , it stirred up a storm of incredulity ; Dr. <NAME> passed for a purely chimerical personage of the <NAME> stamp , who , after having gone through the <NAME> , proposed to “ do ” the <NAME> .
__label__0	As night approached , the snow fell less plentifully , but it became intensely cold .
__label__0	The asteroid passed several hundred yards from the projectile and disappeared , not so much from the rapidity of its course , as that its face being opposite the moon , it was suddenly merged into the perfect darkness of space .
__label__1	‘ Well , well ! ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	Not quite so charming to see their smiling faces fall and brood as they dropped moodily into separate corners of their little carriage .
__label__1	Everybody knows how like the street the two dinner-rows of people who take their stand by the street will be .
__label__0	<NAME> , slipping between the tall shrubs , got within reach of the suspicious shadows he had noticed about half a mile away from the encampment .
__label__1	I could have wished , I own , to have given the lady at whose feet I would lay my humble duty and devotion -- for is she not your wife ! -- no new cause of dislike ; but a wish from you is , of course , paramount to every other consideration on earth .
__label__1	No difference in this respect between the base metals and the precious .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , ’ exclaimed <NAME> , with glistening eyes : ‘ <NAME> and <NAME> , imagine <NAME> , when he was the smallest of juniors , diving for me , catching me , a big heavy senior , by the hair of the head , and striking out for the shore with me like a water-giant ! ’ ‘ Imagine my not letting him sink , as I was his fag ! ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	It was true , however , that fifty-five thousand pounds had been stolen from the <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> , who would not have smiled for the world , replied composedly : ‘ But you are a very good penman , sir .
__label__0	<NAME> , illuminated , glittered and gleamed .
__label__0	It was determined , then , that this coast should be followed as closely as possible , so as to recognize any traces of them that might appear .
__label__1	From this day , <NAME> was seldom left alone ; but was placed in almost constant communication with the two boys , who played the old game with the Jew every day : whether for their own improvement or <NAME> 's , <NAME> best knew .
__label__1	O , my good man , there was first a great crash , and then a great stillness , and that stillness seems to be fixed and unchangeable , never to be broken any more as long as my life lasts. ” “ If she do n't hear the roll of those dreadful carts , now very nigh their journey 's end , ” said <NAME> , glancing over his shoulder , “ it 's my opinion that indeed she never will hear anything else in this world. ” And indeed she never did .
__label__1	Not within my hearing , that is to say . ''
__label__1	I 'm always writing for Ma .
__label__1	Having stolen in unobserved , he playfully leaned on the back of <NAME> ’ s chair , and , as <NAME> saw him , put one of <NAME> ’ s wandering locks to his lips , and waved a kiss from it towards <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ But will you have the goodness just to call me that again , sir ? ’ ‘ I didn ’ t make use of the word in any invidious sense , ma ’ am , ’ replied <NAME> , growing somewhat uneasy on his own account .
__label__0	Hurliguerly bore witness that <NAME> , for all his awkward and clumsy build , was in himself worth three men .
__label__0	The maneuver necessitated a good deal of care .
__label__0	In the color of the water , the shape of the waves , the direction of the wind , he tried to find traces of neighboring land .
__label__0	Not even the fire of a charcoal-burner was visible in the woods , not an encampment of miners near the mines , not a hut among the brushwood .
__label__1	“ You are bound to say of where. ” Which he was , as a Finch .
__label__0	<NAME> was upon it in a bound , and kept it from plunging again .
__label__0	On the whole surface of our Earth , there is no mountain even remotely resembling it .
__label__1	They have a motive for exertion and becoming pride , in the desire to make these little chambers comfortable and decent .
__label__0	The former was the more generally received hypothesis , for the ice-islands passed were too large to have been formed in the open ocean .
__label__1	<NAME> , being a flabby gentleman with a moist surface and eyes so much too small for his moon of a face that they seemed to have been originally made for somebody else , was not at first sight prepossessing ; yet he was scarcely seated before <NAME> asked <NAME> and me , not inaudibly , whether he was not a great creature -- which he certainly was , flabbily speaking , though <NAME> meant in intellectual beauty -- and whether we were not struck by his massive configuration of brow .
__label__0	<NAME> creatures who had left the terrestrial sphere , and returned after this strange voyage into celestial space , could not fail to be received as the prophet <NAME> would be if he came back to earth .
__label__1	All <NAME> ’ s interest is to stick well to the story he has told ; and all his risk is , to depart from it in the least .
__label__1	The spy preserved the same relative distance between them , and followed : with his eye upon her .
__label__1	‘ It would have been much more satisfactory to those who wish to think well of their fellow creatures , and much more becoming in you , if you had shown some proper feeling , in time , for the little child that is now going to be prematurely deprived of its natural nourishment .
__label__0	We have said that his plan was to penetrate into the town , make his way to the <NAME> , gain his confidence , and , when the time came , give up the gates to the besiegers ; and , that done , wreak his vengeance on the brother of the Czar .
__label__0	We will open one , and throw the body out into space . ''
__label__0	This was an utterly unfounded accusation , for <NAME> was both loved and esteemed by <NAME> and his contemporaries , and there is nothing in his writings to justify this calumnious assertion .
__label__1	You might have chanced to hear of your <NAME> on his bier , but for the friend I sent to fetch you .
__label__0	As they approached the spot where the natives were assembled , the latter fled ; this , however , did not prevent the <NAME> from landing , leaving four lads to guard one of the boats , whilst the other remained at sea .
__label__0	And , without doubt , <NAME> was promptly deposed .
__label__1	I liked him no better than at first , and had the same uneasy jealousy of him ; but if I had any reason for it beyond a child ’ s instinctive dislike , and a general idea that <NAME> and I could make much of my mother without any help , it certainly was not THE reason that I might have found if I had been older .
__label__0	I will call to him ; he will hear me , and who knows but that , by returning to him , I may be able to bring him to the knowledge of the truth ? ” The maiden spoke without interruption , for all felt that it was good for her to open her whole heart to her friends .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> , proceed. ’ Miss <NAME> turned my letter , so as to bring the superscription towards herself , and referred through her eye-glass to some orderly-looking notes she had made on that part of it .
__label__0	`` Then , '' said <NAME> , `` I do n't see -- '' `` As for me , '' answered <NAME> , `` since the bullet of mercury , the ice lens , the building of <NAME> , I believe Dr. Clawbonny is capable of anything . ''
__label__1	‘ I shouldn ’ t be here without him .
__label__1	‘ No , of course not , ’ he assented .
__label__0	`` <NAME> , captain , and if you say yes , my bag shall be on board this evening . ''
__label__0	There were disagreeable and painful disputes between these two great men , in which all the wrong done was on the side of <NAME> .
__label__0	Had he fallen during the attack on his rider , or was he straying in the bush , or had the convicts carried him off ?
__label__1	‘ Very well , ’ cried <NAME> with an air of resignation , ‘ then I suppose it must be done !
__label__1	You will find the cold mutton on the table . ''
__label__0	I began with you because you were the top man .
__label__1	Can I ever forget ? ’ ‘ As you were then , my sister , I have often thought since , you have ever been to me .
__label__1	( I really don ’ t like the notion of his going wandering at large , he is so extremely liable to be run over .
__label__0	Goats and musmons gambolled among the rocks .
__label__1	<NAME> is pounds , shillings , and pence .
__label__0	They wanted to be taken to a <NAME> port , and , if not to <NAME> , into <NAME> , situated on the northwest coast of <NAME> , and which was not blocked .
__label__0	“ Swear to me that nothing will make thee acknowledge who thou art , nor whither thou art going. ” “ I swear it. ” “ <NAME> , ” continued the <NAME> , giving the letter to the young courier , “ take this letter ; on it depends the safety of all <NAME> , and perhaps the life of my brother the <NAME> Duke. ” “ This letter shall be delivered to his Highness the <NAME> Duke. ” “ Then thou wilt pass whatever happens ? ” “ I shall pass , or they shall kill me. ” “ I want thee to live. ” “ I shall live , and I shall pass , ” answered <NAME> .
__label__1	screamed <NAME> : seizing Oliver with her utmost force , which was about equal to that of a moderately strong man in particularly good training .
__label__0	The unhealthiness of the climate was fatal to young Toole , who died at <NAME> , on the 26th of February , at the early age of twenty-two .
__label__1	`` Is this your young attendant ? ''
__label__0	`` You do n't mean to say that you have any idea of the meaning of the scrawl ? ''
__label__1	Out with it. ’ ‘ How ’ tis , ma ’ am , ’ resumed <NAME> , appearing still to find his natural refuge in <NAME> ’ s face , ‘ that what is best in us fok , seems to turn us most to trouble an ’ misfort ’ n an ’ mistake , I dunno .
__label__0	He himself had not only collected much valuable information on the geology and botany of <NAME> and <NAME> , but also drawn up a vocabulary of the languages of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> .
__label__1	She darted a hopeful glance at me , when I said ‘ <NAME> ’ ; but seeing that I looked as usual , she took off her spectacles in despair , and rubbed her nose with them .
__label__1	It was a sort of march ; but when the <NAME> put out his right foot , he gravely turned upon his axis , with a semi-circular sweep towards the left ; and when he put out his left foot , he turned in the same manner towards the right .
__label__1	‘ No , thank you ! ’ said <NAME> , coldly , as I mechanically offered them back to him .
__label__0	`` No , sir , '' replied <NAME> ; `` because we shall not take that beast easily . ''
__label__1	`` Peace , my friends , '' says <NAME> , rising and wiping the oily exudations from his reverend visage .
__label__0	Insults were showered upon the governor , and <NAME> cried , `` I should like <NAME> de la <NAME> to know that if he were as young as I , I would kill him , but as he is not , I will spare him .
__label__1	He was happy , he observed , in his public capacity as leader and representative of the <NAME> , to receive Mr Clennam when he called to pay his respects ; but he didn ’ t find that he got on with him personally .
__label__0	<NAME> remained in his corner , not joining the colonists .
__label__1	I ’ m sure of him where he is , whenever I want him for my own purposes , and , besides , he ’ s a good unconscious spy on <NAME> , and tells , in his cups , all that he sees and hears .
__label__1	‘ Admirably groomed , <NAME> ’ -- Mr <NAME> is patting the pony -- ‘ does you great credit -- amazingly sleek and bright to be sure .
__label__1	Her heart was sore , she said , to think of them ; and to talk on this theme , even to strangers , in that blighted place , so far from her old home , eased it somewhat , and became a melancholy pleasure .
__label__0	There was quite a rivalry between <NAME> and the young captain about getting first to the <NAME> coast .
__label__0	“ No , ” answered <NAME> , without moving , but looking the other straight in the face .
__label__1	‘ Could you lend me a penknife ? ’ It was an odd thing , <NAME> smilingly observed , for her who could seldom prevail upon herself even to write a letter , to lend to a man of such vast business as Mr Merdle .
__label__0	Herds of agile gazelles were seen skipping about , their curling horns mingling with the tall herbage , within which the alligator , half concealed , lay silently in wait for them with watchful eyes .

__label__0	They were in unknown regions of the mine ; narrow passages crossed each other like the windings of a labyrinth .
__label__1	<NAME> remains to be said to him from me , after what I have said for good and all , to-night. ’ ‘ And this girl , ’ cried the boy , contemptuously throwing her off again , ‘ calls herself a sister ! ’ ‘ Charley , dear , that is the second time that you have almost struck me .
__label__0	He had a few of all the coins of the neighboring States -- ten double-condors in gold of the <NAME> of <NAME> , worth about a hundred francs ; <NAME> reis , worth about as much ; golden sols of <NAME> , worth , say , double ; some <NAME> escudos , worth fifty francs or more , and some smaller coins ; but the lot would not amount to more than five hundred francs , and <NAME> would have been somewhat embarrassed had he been asked how or where he had got them .
__label__0	You must regain eight hours .
__label__0	`` A convict vessel is not disciplined like a man-of-war !
__label__1	In the business part of the proceedings he carried all before him . ''
__label__1	The little picture was so instantaneously dissolved by our going in , that one might have doubted whether it had ever been .
__label__0	Then the vessel being clear , he descended to his cabin without having uttered a word .
__label__1	When I was there , the latter class of labourers were employed upon the stone for a new custom-house in course of erection at <NAME> .
__label__0	The government determined to settle a question which had been discussed for so many years , and to despatch an expedition for the purpose .
__label__1	The images of Mrs. Squeers , my daughter , and my son <NAME> , all short of vittles , is perpetually before me ; every other consideration melts away and vanishes , in front of these ; the only number in all arithmetic that I know of , as a husband and a father , is number one , under this here most fatal go ! ’ <NAME> long <NAME> might have declaimed , or how stormy a discussion his declamation might have led to , nobody knows .
__label__0	<NAME> and <NAME> , lying in the afterpart of the raft , bore this increase of suffering without complaint .
__label__0	This would be a very serious charge .
__label__1	All you ’ ve got to do , ’ said the <NAME> , with the solemnity of a man who was delivering himself of one of the most precious practical tenets ever discovered by human wisdom , ‘ is to lay your head well to the wind , and we ’ ll fight through it ! ’ Old Sol returned the pressure of his hand , and thanked him .
__label__0	Of all the animals left here by <NAME> , the cats , now become wild alone , had survived , and thus far they had not destroyed the legions of rats with which the island was overrun .
__label__0	I only observed that in the upper regions the water was always colder in the high levels than at the surface of the sea .
__label__0	The resident at once sent him the order of the Governor of <NAME> , which expressly forbade his receiving any strange ship in his harbour , and begged <NAME> to make a written declaration of the reason for his putting into port , in order that he might prove to his superior that he had not infringed his orders except under paramount necessity .
__label__0	The natives whom business called beyond the <NAME> frontier could not leave the province for a time at least .
__label__1	Be here all the earlier next morning . ''
__label__1	It is all the same .
__label__0	It is better that disinterested witnesses should affirm that this case was really found on the corpse of <NAME> ! ” “ You are right , ” replied <NAME> .
__label__1	`` Somebody 's been making free here ! ''
__label__0	Thus , on several occasions , junks were seized upon , and their crews forced by their <NAME> captors to pay large ransoms .
__label__1	If you should have any reason for imposing conditions upon me , I will respect it without asking what it is. ’ ‘ You chanced to see me in the street with the man , ’ she observed , after being , to his mortification , evidently more occupied with her own reflections on the matter than with his appeal .
__label__1	‘ N -- no , ’ returned <NAME> , shaking his head at once observantly , thoughtfully , and playfully .
__label__1	<NAME> you good-night , ladies. ’ To the great relief of Mrs. Sanders , <NAME> was allowed to depart without any reference , on the part of the hostess , to the pettitoes and toasted cheese ; to which the ladies , with such juvenile assistance as <NAME> could afford , soon afterwards rendered the amplest justice -- indeed they wholly vanished before their strenuous exertions .
__label__0	In a few moments <NAME> had regained the stern of the vessel without having been perceived , and , taking a seat by himself , he buried his face in his hands .
__label__1	An arch of the bridge in the park has been sapped and sopped away .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , ’ said the Major , defiantly , ‘ I know better ; a man of your mark -- the <NAME> of commerce -- is not to be interrupted .
__label__1	<NAME> mentioned his name , and his having promised to call , on the solicitation of Mr Chivery .
__label__0	Under these circumstances a terrible storm arose , and the <NAME> was mercilessly knocked about .
__label__0	Upon reaching the Cape , <NAME> was obliged to put in for forty days .
__label__1	You are hasty in thinking that I mean to check you .
__label__1	Appealing to <NAME> , would be rather a rum course .
__label__0	<NAME> is a large and populous town on the skirts of a desert of sand .
__label__1	‘ Well , well ! ’ he said with a sigh , dismissing , as I then saw , some trial she had borne , or was yet to bear , in connexion with what my aunt had told me .
__label__1	It would be better for me , they tell me , if I restrained myself .
__label__0	It is no wonder , therefore , that in honour of the man who did so much to make <NAME> known , the name of <NAME> should have been given to an immense flower native to it , and of which some specimens measure over three feet in diameter , and weigh some ten pounds .
__label__1	he cried impatiently , stamping his foot upon the ground .
__label__1	The suddenness with which he dropped it , when he perceived that it was useless to him ; the malice , insolence , and hatred , he revealed ; the leer with which he exulted , even at this moment , in the evil he had done -- all this time being desperate too , and at his wits ’ end for the means of getting the better of us -- though perfectly consistent with the experience I had of him , at first took even me by surprise , who had known him so long , and disliked him so heartily .
__label__1	'Here his is , coming down the street . '
__label__1	‘ Now , <NAME> , ’ says the Major , ‘ our friend <NAME> having , with an amount of eloquence that <NAME> B. has never heard surpassed -- no , by the <NAME> , <NAME> !
__label__1	Everybody gave me a present .
__label__1	rejoined <NAME> ; 'that was done by <NAME> , that was . '
__label__0	How could we both be deceived ?
__label__0	The departure was fixed for the 16th of April , and the “ Bonadventure , ” anchored in <NAME> , was provisioned for a voyage which might be of some duration .
__label__1	I wish to be honourable , <NAME> , ’ said Mr Toots , holding back his extended hand for a moment , ‘ and therefore I am obliged to say that I can not help thinking about <NAME> .
__label__0	One token alone will remain with you of <NAME> , with whose history you are now acquainted .
__label__1	<NAME> Micawber with more shirt-collar than usual , and a new ribbon to his eye-glass ; Mrs. Micawber with her cap in a whitey-brown paper parcel ; Traddles carrying the parcel , and supporting Mrs. Micawber on his arm .
__label__0	And they walked off together , Passepartout chatting volubly as they went along .
__label__1	‘ To ask you if you ’ ll have another rasher would be unmeaning flattery , for it would make you thirsty all day .
__label__0	for here we are pinned to the ground , like a bird with broken wings. ” “ With this difference , however , my dear <NAME> , that our wings are unhurt , and I hope that we shall be able to use them again. ” “ Ah !
__label__1	We had half-an-hour ’ s talk , all together ; and I asked her about the twins , who , she said , were ‘ grown great creatures ’ ; and after <NAME> and <NAME> , whom she described as ‘ absolute giants ’ , but they were not produced on that occasion .
__label__0	At the porch of the chapel the minister awaited the arrival of the wedding party .
__label__1	<NAME> has eaten no dinner , but has twice or thrice poured out water with a steady hand and drunk it .
__label__0	`` We were thus enabled , '' says D'Urville , `` to gaze at our leisure upon the wonderful spectacle spread out before our eyes .
__label__1	T. and Co. ” “ I know this messenger , guard , ” said <NAME> , getting down into the road -- assisted from behind more swiftly than politely by the other two passengers , who immediately scrambled into the coach , shut the door , and pulled up the window .
__label__0	They might have been a herd of enormous whales , suddenly turned to stone .
__label__0	If , then , this cavity was also drawn blank , he would have to suspend his researches .
__label__1	I never do ; I never have done .
__label__0	<NAME> throws no light upon this incident .
__label__1	Traddles accordingly did so , over the banister ; and <NAME> , not a bit changed -- his tights , his stick , his shirt-collar , and his eye-glass , all the same as ever -- came into the room with a genteel and youthful air .
__label__1	Nothing but the respect and obligation I owe to you , sir -- ’ As it was plain that <NAME> was bent on a complimentary harangue , unless he received a timely interruption , Mr Quilp politely tapped him on the crown of his head with the little saucepan , and requested that he would be so obliging as to hold his peace .
__label__0	But a kind of lurid brilliancy spread over the island , against which stood out confusedly the wooded masses of the heights .
__label__1	He at once threw himself on the astonished combatants , with his accustomed energy , and loudly called upon the bystanders to interpose .
__label__0	These relics , with those collected by <NAME> , are now in the <NAME> at the <NAME> .
__label__1	You won ’ t be put off for another single minute , won ’ t you ? ’ <NAME> to immediate action by the master ’ s tone and look , the old man took up his hat from the little counter where it lay .
__label__1	The landlord slightly inclined his head .
__label__0	The spiral , which was not to be adjusted until some future moment , was packed up , separately , along with a very strong Buntzen electric battery .
__label__1	They are startling contrivances , and are most agreeable when passed .
__label__0	<NAME> is more dangerous in these desolate latitudes .
__label__0	Meanwhile a frightful tempest was raging under us , but we were above it .
__label__1	Fortified towns with their stockades , guard-houses , gates , trenches , and drawbridges , seemed to the mender of roads , to be so much air as against this figure .
__label__0	All ran after the dog , among the tall pines on the border of the forest .
__label__1	It was too much for Mrs. <NAME> , who immediately rose .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> ’ t distress yourself on that account , ’ said <NAME> ; ‘ if he had one grain of the delicacy of feeling which distinguishes you , humble as your station is , I should have some hopes of him. ’ Job Trotter bowed low ; and in spite of <NAME> ’ s previous remonstrance , the tears again rose to his eyes .
__label__1	‘ And warn ’ t there no honest man to pick it up ?
__label__0	Seeing a canoe manned by not more than seven or eight men approaching the corvette , this `` _Shaki_ '' and the rest came to entreat D'Urville most earnestly to kill the new arrivals , going so far as to ask for muskets that they might themselves fire upon them .
__label__0	How the poor omnibus horses would rejoice !
__label__1	I got your letter and destroyed it .
__label__1	I could hardly begin but <NAME> must begin too , so he soon followed .
__label__0	For six months a correspondence had passed between these two men .
__label__1	Mr and <NAME> are of the company , and the <NAME> descry in Mrs Podsnap a fine woman .
__label__0	The hope of acquiring wealth in this pursuit , and zeal for propagating their religion , have filled this extensive city with <NAME> .
__label__0	Except the thirteen Englishmen who had been left at <NAME> , every living creature had taken refuge in the dark abyss of the volcano ’ s crater .
__label__1	When he is most proud and happy in her and her children , he will be most repentant of his own part in the dark vision of our married life .
__label__1	<NAME> will go regularly between us , and when the time comes you may be certain I shall be ready .
__label__0	<NAME> ran toward him , saying , `` Have you seen a man go into the wood , armed with a rifle ?
__label__1	The debilitated cousin , more debilitated by the dreariness of the place , gets into a fearful state of depression , groaning under penitential sofa-pillows in his gunless hours and protesting that such fernal old jail 's -- nough t'sew fler up -- frever .
__label__1	That travelled creation of the great satirist ’ s brain , who fresh from living among horses , peered from a high casement down upon his own kind with trembling horror , was scarcely more repelled and daunted by the sight , than those who look upon some of these faces for the first time must surely be .
__label__0	`` We can try , '' said <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ One winter ’ s evening , about five o ’ clock , just as it began to grow dusk , a man in a gig might have been seen urging his tired horse along the road which leads across <NAME> , in the direction of <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ You ’ ll go home very soon , you will .
__label__0	You are the only man among us whose head is fire-proof , blast-proof , and powder-proof .
__label__1	<NAME> broke down in a piece of knitting , and no one but <NAME> was able to put the defaulter in the right direction .
__label__0	A cannon was the engine <NAME> & Co. were to bring into action .
__label__0	409 <NAME> and <NAME> -- Champlain and <NAME> -- The <NAME> upon the coast of the <NAME> -- The Spaniards in <NAME> -- Summary of the information acquired at the close of the 17th century -- The measure of the terrestrial degree -- Progress of cartography -- Inauguration of <NAME> .
__label__0	Ten minutes later , the flock had come within gunshot , and were making the air ring with their hoarse cries .
__label__0	The supper was a dull meal , and neither appetizing nor reviving .
__label__0	The wound bled profusely , but <NAME> could use his fingers and forearm ; and consequently there was no occasion for any uneasiness about the issue .
__label__0	`` No , uncle , for I am strong . ''
__label__1	There are two establishments for boys in this same neighbourhood .
__label__0	<NAME> was the wonderful structure which was going down the <NAME> .
__label__1	There was abundance of time to look about him again though , when he had rung it , for nobody came , so after ringing it twice or thrice he sat down upon his box , and waited .
__label__0	Whether or no , I weigh anchor. ” “ We will be punctual. ” This said , <NAME> , the Major , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> left the ship , <NAME> not so much as touching the oilskin that adorned his red locks .
__label__0	! ” There was a general sigh of disappointment .
__label__0	Two pirogues were often coupled , and the very smallest carried only the poles needed to preserve their equilibrium .
__label__0	But all the other sailors were silent .
__label__1	That , if <NAME> knew it , and at any subsequent period of our joint domestic life remarked that his beer was flat or thick , the conviction that he suspected tar in it , would bring a rush of blood to my face .
__label__1	There were hyacinths there , this last spring , blossoming , in -- but you ’ ll laugh at that , of course. ’ ‘ At what ? ’ ‘ At their blossoming in old blacking-bottles , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	`` So , in your opinion , <NAME> , <NAME> will fail ? ''
__label__1	Finding that the afternoon coach was gone , and finding that his uneasiness grew into positive alarm , as obstacles came in his way , he resolved to follow in a post-chaise .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> also came to speak to us and did the honours of the place in much the same way , with the bland modesty of a proprietor .
__label__0	But before then , the stranger , whose presence at this place no one had suspected , crossed <NAME> , which separated the plateau from the forest , and bounded up the opposite bank .
__label__0	At last the long agony was over forever .
__label__1	Now , then , fust cab ! ’ And the first cab having been fetched from the public- house , where he had been smoking his first pipe , <NAME> and his portmanteau were thrown into the vehicle .
__label__0	`` And inasmuch , '' continued the judge , `` as it is not proved that the act was not done by the connivance of the master with the servant , and as the master in any case must be held responsible for the acts of his paid servant , I condemn <NAME> to a week 's imprisonment and a fine of one hundred and fifty pounds . ''
__label__1	On a Monday morning , when <NAME> and I were at breakfast , I received the following letter from <NAME> by the post .
__label__1	But , <NAME> mistaken on a point that has caused me more smart in my breast than a flight of savages ’ arrows could have done !
__label__1	He would have clasped the little figure closer , but he saw that the eyes appealed to him not to be moved .
__label__1	He toiled out at that low door so bent and worn , and then he took his breath and stood upright , and looked all round him at the sky , and the wind blew upon him , and his life down in the dark was over ! -- Till he was called back to life , ’ she added , looking round at <NAME> with that lower look of sharpness .
__label__0	It took four days to go up this canal , and it was so wide that two triremes could go abreast .
__label__1	Oh , my Darling ! ’ Overpowered by sudden grief , he sobbed aloud .
__label__1	‘ Not at all , ’ gruffly remarked the elder <NAME> .
__label__0	The good , and peaceful , and imperturbable Hans would certainly not have arisen from his sleep without some serious and grave motive .
__label__0	The scene , as here depicted , took place upon the extremity of a little cape on the <NAME> coast , between <NAME> and <NAME> , about two miles from the mouth of the <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> shrugged his shoulders again , as if it were no great feat to amaze <NAME> , and cast a wistful glance at the face of <NAME> , which had several times appeared behind a couple of panes of glass in the room door ; it being a part of <NAME> ’ s duty , when unimportant people called , to make various feints of supposing that the bell had rung for him to show them out : by way of a gentle hint to such visitors that it was time to go .
__label__0	But <NAME> was now in a profound stupor , from which it was no longer possible to rouse him .
__label__0	It was this : the party followed a line of hills not more than fifty feet high , which appeared to run on several miles , and their eastern side was covered with red snow .
__label__0	In fact there are but two chains of moderate elevation , between which runs the magnificent Mississippi , the `` king of rivers '' as these <NAME> <NAME> delight to call it .
__label__0	Do you see anything abnormal ? ” “ Nothing. ” “ There is , however , one thing which absolutely proves that the language is subject to the laws of number. ” “ And that is ? ” “ That is that you see three _h ’ s_ coming together in two different places. ” What <NAME> said was correct , and it was of a nature to attract attention .
__label__1	‘ She then gave <NAME> a string of beads which she used to wear at home , which were recognised by the child at once , who , with much joy , put them around her neck , and sought me eagerly to say she understood the string was from her home .
__label__1	And wotsume'er the failings on his part , he were a corn and seedsman in his hart. ” “ Is it <NAME> 's house that has been broken into , then ? ” “ That 's it , <NAME> , ” said <NAME> ; “ and they took his till , and they took his cash-box , and they drinked his wine , and they partook of his wittles , and they slapped his face , and they pulled his nose , and they tied him up to his bedpust , and they giv ' him a dozen , and they stuffed his mouth full of flowering annuals to prewent his crying out .
__label__1	‘ Of course I am , ’ replied <NAME> haughtily .
__label__1	I will tell <NAME> to be careful of it .
__label__1	I ’ ve swore my oath that I ’ ll not miss ye twice ! ’ Accordingly , that same evening the poor soul stands in <NAME> High Street , looking at the many quaint gables of the <NAME> ’ <NAME> , and getting through the time as she best can until nine o ’ clock ; at which hour she has reason to suppose that the arriving omnibus passengers may have some interest for her .
__label__0	No more crescent , no more cloudy light !
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> is my messenger and representative .
__label__0	Do you not see the <NAME> flag ? ” and , as he spoke , he pointed with national pride to the <NAME> standard floating over the top of the island .
__label__0	“ Pay attention to my wishes , ” he continued .
__label__0	The silence was only interrupted by the cries of <NAME> urging on his burdened team .
__label__0	<NAME> , which seemed as if it issued from the dense forest , covered the clearing .
__label__0	<NAME> revised his figures : they were exact .
__label__0	All that <NAME> said of the hygienic qualities of the climate was realized .
__label__0	I think some branches will be very useful in stopping up these openings , through which the wind shrieks like so many fiends. ” <NAME> and <NAME> left the <NAME> , and , turning the angle , they began to climb the left bank of the river .
__label__1	This is a way of life which reminds me of the period when I was myself in a state of celibacy , and Mrs. Micawber had not yet been solicited to plight her faith at the <NAME> altar. ’ ‘ He means , solicited by him , <NAME> , ’ said Mrs. Micawber , archly .
__label__1	We have nothing more to say , and may break up our pleasant party . '
__label__0	Certainly my trouble and agitation would have betrayed me to <NAME> 's eyes .
__label__0	Lastly , the <NAME> , who are the lightest in colour , seem much attached to a pastoral and agricultural life .
__label__1	What was all this though -- even all this -- to the extraordinary dissipation that ensued , when <NAME> , walking into an oyster-shop as bold as if he lived there , and not so much as looking at the counter or the man behind it , led his party into a box -- a private box , fitted up with red curtains , white table-cloth , and cruet-stand complete -- and ordered a fierce gentleman with whiskers , who acted as waiter and called him , him Christopher <NAME> , ‘ sir , ’ to bring three dozen of his largest-sized oysters , and to look sharp about it !
__label__0	The doctor immediately recognized that immense clearing , ten miles in extent , with its villages buried in the midst of baobab and calabash trees .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , you sir ! ’ said <NAME> , for the third time .
__label__1	It ’ s a delightful book , and all true and real -- that ’ s the best of it -- true as the <NAME> of <NAME> , and real as its gold and silver .
__label__0	The abrupt character of the slopes momentarily increased , but these remarkable stone steps , a little less difficult than those of the <NAME> pyramids , were the one simple natural means by which we were enabled to proceed .
__label__0	Towards morning , <NAME> gave up in despair and went to take a sleep ; but no sleep for <NAME> .
__label__0	`` You shall not eat it , then , '' cried <NAME> , rushing upon <NAME> , who seized his cutlass , crying , -- `` Help , <NAME> !
__label__1	It still wanted ten minutes to the hour when he had ascended the staircase on which <NAME> ’ s chambers were .
__label__0	We will see if it applies to our situation . ''
__label__0	The settlers listened and they thought they heard a sort of chuckling laugh , of which they could not guess the origin .
__label__0	As soon as ever <NAME> invented a new shot , <NAME> invented a new plate ; each followed a current of ideas essentially opposed to the other .
__label__1	‘ Emily , my girl , ’ said <NAME> reproachfully , ‘ I detest meanness and deceit ; this is unjustifiable and indelicate in the highest degree .
__label__0	The very year of his return , on the 15th of May , 1501 , <NAME> , in pursuance of an order of the 15th of April , received provisions , and left <NAME> in the hope of extending the field of his discoveries .
__label__0	`` Well , '' said <NAME> , `` we 'll ask the commander for a ration of gin ; we deserve it , and we 'll see what he 'll say . ''
__label__1	The very wedding looked dismal as they passed in front of the altar .
__label__0	<NAME> was sleeping , then , badly enough , tossing about between the cloths which served him for sheets , and he was dreaming of making a more comfortable couch in his projectile when a frightful noise disturbed his dreams .
__label__1	Upon this , the pursuers took counsel together , and , coming so near the truth as to arrive at the conclusion that <NAME> and <NAME> , with <NAME> for their instrument , were negotiating for the recovery of some of the stolen papers which would not bear the light , and might possibly explain the hints relative to <NAME> which <NAME> had overheard , resolved that <NAME> should be taken into custody before she had parted with them : and <NAME> too , if anything suspicious could be attached to him .
__label__0	Under the names of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and other titles besides , it traverses an immense extent of country , and almost competes in length with the Nile .
__label__0	`` Do n't be afraid , '' cried the boatswain .
__label__1	But while I must , rather peremptorily , request my friend <NAME> not to criminate my lovely and accomplished relative until her criminality is perfectly established , I beg to assure my friend <NAME> that the family I represent , and which is now almost extinct ( devilish sad reflection for a man ) , will interpose no obstacle in his way , and will be happy to assent to any honourable course of proceeding , with a view to the future , that he may point out .
__label__1	You do me the favour to follow , and to comprehend ? ’ She kept her eyes fixed upon him with a frown .
__label__1	‘ I will wait , if you please , for I want to speak to her. ’ ‘ Do you ? ’ returned <NAME> .
__label__1	You must not think my visit all friendly and disinterested , <NAME> , for -- I am afraid I may be cruelly prejudiced -- I do not like to let papa go away alone , with him. ’ ‘ Does he exercise the same influence over <NAME> still , <NAME> ? ’ Agnes shook her head .
__label__0	There were still the same trees , belonging , for the most part , to the pine family .
__label__1	I told her not to come near us till he was dead .
__label__0	[ Illustration : `` We made them sing . '' ]
__label__1	‘ Mind that , <NAME> ! ’ he added , with unusual energy .
__label__1	‘ I am not aware of anything more , ’ replied <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Perhaps you gentlemen might like a bottle ? ’ The answer being By all means , <NAME> received his instructions from Mr Inspector , and departed in a becoming state of alacrity engendered by reverence for the majesty of the law .
__label__0	I lay in a stupor , a half dream , during which I saw visions of astounding character .
__label__1	Even had it not been so , the dear old china shepherdess would have worried herself to death with fears for her son , and with general trepidation occasioned by their having such an inmate .
__label__1	For other crimes as tyrants and oppressors , I have this race a long time on my register , doomed to destruction and extermination .
__label__0	“ Yes , captain , ” answered the sailor , “ the boat is empty , and all its seams are open .
__label__0	“ The same , sir , ” replied the doctor , quietly , “ and his two friends. ” The <NAME> escorted our travellers from the river , while the balloon , half-empty , and borne away by a swift current , sped on , to plunge , like a huge bubble , headlong with the waters of the <NAME> , into the cataracts of <NAME> .
__label__1	But he shuts out the now chilled air , draws the window-curtain , goes to bed , and falls asleep .
__label__1	I am very sorry to have done a man wrong , particularly when it can ’ t be undone .
__label__0	“ These only thought of themselves , and not at all of travelers. ” Everyone inclined to the opinion of <NAME> except <NAME> , who congratulated himself on walking under shadeless trees , though all the time he was wiping the perspiration from his forehead .
__label__0	`` Well , is he not going to brave danger to find his son ? ''
__label__1	`` I should not be surprised if they all voluntarily abandoned the girl -- yes , lover and all -- instead of her abandoning them , supposing she remained at <NAME> under such circumstances . ''
__label__1	How unfortnet do you want me fur to be ?
__label__1	When he opens the door , candle in hand , his cheerful face falls , and disappointed amazement is in it .
__label__1	‘ You see , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ knowing as you was partial to a little relish with your wittles when you was along with us , we took the liberty .
__label__0	<NAME> conspired with fatigue to crush him , for a man ’ s system is not greatly restored and fortified by a diet of roots , the pith of plants , such as the <NAME> , or the fruit of the doum palm-tree ; and yet , according to his own calculations , <NAME> was enabled to push on about twenty miles to the westward .
__label__0	It is necessary , therefore , to seek for the cause of this phenomenon elsewhere .
__label__1	‘ May I beg your pardon again , if I inquire what you mean , sir ? ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	The four caravels were full of worm-holes , and one of them had to be left behind at <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> , if you let her in but once , only to look upon me for one moment as I lie here , I shall die . ''
__label__1	And if there must be people vowed to crush the harmless fancies and the love of innocent delights and gaieties , which are a part of human nature : as much a part of it as any other love or hope that is our common portion : let them , for me , stand openly revealed among the ribald and licentious ; the very idiots know that _they_ are not on the <NAME> road , and will despise them , and avoid them readily .
__label__1	The patriarchal Mr Casby then rose with the air of having done it himself , and blandly followed : leaving his daughter , as she followed in her turn , to remark to her former lover in a distracted whisper ( which she very much enjoyed ) , that they had drained the cup of life to the dregs ; and further to hint mysteriously that the late Mr F. was at the bottom of it .
__label__0	The <NAME> was simply a colossal magnet .
__label__0	He always added that they must fight to the last man , and blow up the town rather than yield !
__label__1	‘ Sam ! ’ cried <NAME> , calling after him , ‘ <NAME> !
__label__1	And I know brickmakers go about working at piecework in different places .
__label__1	<NAME> of what must separate me , through the whole remainder of my life , from purity and innocence -- from you , of all the earth .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> may become a <NAME> or anything else she likes , but not a <NAME> .
__label__0	The novelty of this mode of proceeding , and the request for a garment , which seemed to them even more necessary than food , made our travellers laugh heartily until they became accustomed to it .
__label__1	There was an empty room above-stairs at the wooden <NAME> ’ s , which , in days of yore , had been <NAME> ’ s bedroom .
__label__1	‘ Ay , ’ repeated <NAME> ; ‘ is it of the greatest consequence ? ’ ‘ Of the very greatest consequence , ’ replied <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> was kept acquainted with all that was going on in the very heart of the invaded provinces .
__label__1	But having risked discovery by venturing here at all , I should have been glad to track some part of the way. ’ With which singular words he abandoned his search , came up out of <NAME> , and took the way past <NAME> .
__label__0	The walls of <NAME> , once so sure a retreat , might at any moment fall in upon them .
__label__1	But he was very penitent indeed , and in a peculiar way -- not in the lump , but by instalments .
__label__1	Repressing , with as good a grace as possible , these little familiarities -- for which , there is reason to believe , the black bottle was at least as much to blame as any constitutional infirmity on the part of Mrs. Sliderskew -- he protested that he had only been joking : and , in proof of his unimpaired good-humour , that he was ready to examine the deeds at once , if , by so doing , he could afford any satisfaction or relief of mind to his fair friend .
__label__1	I had hoped , ’ said <NAME> , looking round with a mournful smile , ‘ to have seen you three gentlemen , one day or another , with your legs under the mahogany in my humble parlour in the <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Yes , <NAME> , since you put it in that shape , I have got another berth , ’ cried <NAME> , backing more and more ; ‘ a better berth than I ’ ve got here , and one where I don ’ t so much as want your good word , <NAME> , which is fort ’ nate for me , after all the dirt you ’ ve throw ’ d at me , because I ’ m poor , and can ’ t afford to stand in my own light for your good .
__label__1	This modesty of mine directed my attention to the marine-store shops , and such shops as <NAME> ’ s , in preference to the regular dealers .
__label__1	But they said , wait a few days more ; and then , wait a few days more ; and still she neither ran nor walked .
__label__0	It is something gained even to hear each other . ''
__label__1	‘ You mean that in that case I must pay the damages ? ’ said <NAME> , who had watched this telegraphic answer with considerable sternness .
__label__0	We shall do capital here. ” “ Especially when there is a good fire blazing on the hearth , for we are quite as cold as we are hungry .
__label__1	I ’ ve heerd , in my dreams , of <NAME> ’ s father and his uncle .
__label__0	About eight o'clock our mules were brought ; and we set out at last for the chalet of the Pierre-Pointue , situated at a height of six thousand five hundred feet , or three thousand above the valley of <NAME> , not far from eight thousand five hundred feet below the summit of <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ It ’ s a good thing , ’ thought the child , ‘ I am very glad they pass the church. ’ And then she stopped , to fancy how the noise would sound inside , and how gently it would seem to die away upon the ear .
__label__1	Her father privately married again -- his cook , I rather think. ” “ I thought he was proud , ” said I .
__label__0	It came from the pah , whose direction <NAME> did not know .
__label__1	The name has quite escaped me .
__label__0	In the more interior galleries there was still a certain degree of warmth , and hither <NAME> and his companions were glad enough to retreat .
__label__1	Is there anything the matter , my dear ?
__label__0	He also names the large rivers that flow into these seas .
__label__0	The naval watches proved of great assistance upon this occasion , and justified the opinion entertained of them .
__label__0	“ But how ? ” “ That I do not know , ” answered <NAME> , “ but we shall manage it. ” And now everybody wanted to know about their friend ’ s adventures .
__label__1	There was an anxiety even in her hopefulness that made me doubtful if I had done right in approaching the subject .
__label__0	`` No doubt , '' replied <NAME> ; `` I expected it . ''
__label__1	Little <NAME> was a leading and a constant subject : for the circumstances of his life , united to those of her own story , presented the little creature to him as the only person between whom and himself there were ties of innocent reliance on one hand , and affectionate protection on the other ; ties of compassion , respect , unselfish interest , gratitude , and pity .
__label__1	It was not until he had delighted in them for some time , that he wondered who had sent them ; and opened his door to ask the woman who must have put them there , how they had come into her hands .
__label__1	In fact , mother , I ca n't bear it ; I ca n't make up my mind to it .
__label__0	The hull of the <NAME> was just beginning to issue from the water .
__label__1	‘ Where am I ? ’ exclaimed <NAME> .
__label__1	If that dark-visaged eldest boy could look more malicious than he had already looked , this was the time when he did it .
__label__1	‘ Now , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ for the little plan I have in my mind to bring this about ; because , I haven ’ t offered myself even to the father yet , I should have told you .
__label__1	That which promised happiness when we were one in heart , is fraught with misery now that we are two .
__label__1	‘ They ’ ll turn up presently , I dare say .
__label__0	Lastly , he went to <NAME> by way of <NAME> and <NAME> .
__label__0	`` Your thoughts are with your country , gentlemen , '' continued the captain ; `` your toils are for her prosperity and glory .
__label__0	Therefore <NAME> resolved to put the corral in instantaneous communication with <NAME> .
__label__0	Nothing could be more rudimentary .
__label__1	It was not I who cautioned you once never to found a hope or expectation on the family curse . ''
__label__1	<NAME> face , sunken eyes , hollow cheeks , beard of three days ' growth , wasted flesh , short thick breath ; it was the very ghost of <NAME> .
__label__1	he cried , upon his knees .
__label__1	As haggard and as shabby , as if , for want of custom , it had itself taken to drinking , and had gone the way all drunkards go , and was very near the end of it .
__label__1	I mention the conquest in good time because I apprehend your scheme to be more important to you than your vanity. ’ There was a mirror on the wall before them , and her eyes just caught him smirking in it .
__label__1	You may stare and shiver .
__label__1	repeats <NAME> , in his desperation clutching at the clump of hair at the back of his bald head .
__label__1	Many minor incidents in the household life of the <NAME> ’ Instrument-maker who was proud of his little Midshipman , assisted and bore out this fancy .
__label__1	'That it wo n't do ; so it 's no use a-trying it on , <NAME> , ' replied <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> had not been forgotten , and he occupied a room at the back , near the storeroom , a sort of cabin with a cot always full of good litter , which perfectly suited his taste .
__label__0	<NAME> V. pretended not to recognize him , and asked who this man was .
__label__1	‘ Never mind , <NAME> , never mind , ’ replied the long gamekeeper ; ‘ I ’ ve no family myself , sir ; and this here boy ’ s mother will get something handsome from <NAME> , if he ’ s killed on his land .
__label__0	The whole party in the <NAME> felt agitated and oppressed , and not one of them could close his eyes .
__label__1	He laughed heartily and answered , `` No . ''
__label__1	‘ Humph ! ’ she said , running her eyes over the child ’ s slight figure , ‘ I don ’ t see anything else -- except the shoes .
__label__0	`` It would be prudent for us to retire , '' said <NAME> , who was anxious that <NAME> should not receive any injury , at least until they got back to <NAME> .
__label__1	`` So it is , so it is , '' returned my guardian hurriedly .
__label__0	`` And yet , '' answered <NAME> , `` there is no possibility of doubting -- '' `` No , '' retorted the doctor ; `` I turn it all over in vain , and say it is improbable , impossible ; I have to give it up .
__label__0	We command you to give credit to , and to execute , whatever he shall order on our part .
__label__0	From that day <NAME> , for some reason at present incomprehensible , quite altered his behavior to <NAME> , a man for whom he had always hitherto evinced the greatest repugnance and contempt .
__label__1	<NAME> night , _my_ friend and partner ! ’ He shook his hand in saying this , as if there had been something serious at the bottom of their conversation ; and they separated .
__label__1	‘ I don ’ t wish to be complimented upon it , I thank you ; but I think I have an idea , ’ <NAME> announced , after taking a jog-trot or two across the room , so unexpected and unaccountable that they all stared at him , doubtful whether he was choking or had the cramp— ‘ I _think_ I have an idea .
__label__1	The beadle , though generally understood in the neighbourhood to be a ridiculous institution , is not without a certain popularity for the moment , if it were only as a man who is going to see the body .
__label__0	About this time the female onaga gave birth to a young one which belonged to the same sex as its mother , and which throve capitally .
__label__1	he repeated , and I saw by his face that all the time he talked he was listening for the discovery of the letter , to my own great agitation , for I knew then how important it must be ; `` I 'll tell you what he means , ma'am .
__label__1	Thus accoutred , and walking with the confident tread of such a character , and with the supple freedom of a woman who had habitually walked in her girlhood , bare-foot and bare-legged , on the brown sea-sand , <NAME> took her way along the streets .
__label__0	<NAME> and <NAME> immediately took their places in the tarantass .
__label__1	Do you mind me ? ’ Glad to be released , the woman quickly disappeared .
__label__0	Not a sound in the forest .
__label__1	‘ I shall not come to you to take lessons in the art , ma ’ am ! ’ retorted <NAME> .
__label__1	That he was well known in the neighbourhood , and enjoyed the reputation of having sold himself to the devil , I soon understood from the visits he received from the boys , who continually came skirmishing about the shop , shouting that legend , and calling to him to bring out his gold .
__label__0	Now , tell me , <NAME> , do you believe that the moon is an old comet ? ''
__label__0	It was <NAME> and <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , the Major , <NAME> , the steward , and the two sailors .
__label__1	By the time he had handed it back , and its beautiful wearer had put it on again ( which she did with perfect composure and indifference ) , the lodger returned with the show and showmen at his heels , and a strong addition to the body of spectators .
__label__0	Those intended for the table never ate meat , but were fed upon bread-fruits , cocoa-nuts , yams , and other vegetables .
__label__0	After leaving <NAME> , upon the 10th of April , <NAME> followed much the same route as <NAME> had done in 1777 , when he sailed from <NAME> to the <NAME> coast ; but he was a hundred leagues farther west .
__label__1	Some of the letters were proceedings of ladies ' committees or resolutions of ladies ' meetings , which she read to us ; others were applications from people excited in various ways about the cultivation of coffee , and natives ; others required answers , and these she sent her eldest daughter from the table three or four times to write .
__label__1	And why on the sly ?
__label__0	All the inhabitants of the city had teeth of gold ; that is to say , they covered their teeth with little plates of gold which they removed before eating .
__label__0	This led the sailor to repeat to the engineer , -- “ You see , captain , so long as we have not one or two fowling-pieces , we shall never get anything ! ” “ Doubtless , <NAME> , ” replied the reporter , “ but it depends on you .
__label__1	All night long , and every night , on this canal , there was a perfect storm and tempest of spitting ; and once my coat , being in the very centre of the hurricane sustained by five gentlemen ( which moved vertically , strictly carrying out <NAME> ’ s Theory of the Law of <NAME> ) , I was fain the next morning to lay it on the deck , and rub it down with fair water before it was in a condition to be worn again .
__label__0	“ Something mysterious here ! ” said <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> clenched his teeth ; took one look around ; threw over the prostrate form of <NAME> , the cape in which he had been hurriedly muffled ; ran along the front of the hedge , as if to distract the attention of those behind , from the spot where the boy lay ; paused , for a second , before another hedge which met it at right angles ; and whirling his pistol high into the air , cleared it at a bound , and was gone .
__label__1	The beautiful lady who had soothed and carressed her , in the very room in which her heart had been so wrung , was a spirit of promise to her .
__label__0	However , the balloon , lightened of heavy articles , such as ammunition , arms , and provisions , had risen into the higher layers of the atmosphere , to a height of 4,500 feet .
__label__1	When <NAME> was summoned to the couch , <NAME> , attentive to all that happened , slipped behind that wicked shadow—a sight in the horror of his face , if there had been eyes there for any sight but one—and whispered in his ear .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> ’ t you ? ’ said the waiter .
__label__1	The younger Toodles clustered round their mother ’ s gown , and peeped from under their own chubby arms at their desperado brother and his unknown friend .
__label__0	He saw in <NAME> the man he wanted ; he presented his plans by an anonymous letter to him and to Dr. Clawbonny .
__label__1	‘ There , precious ! ’ said the <NAME> , when she ceased ; and deep attention the <NAME> had paid to her while she spoke ; listening , with his glazed hat all awry and his mouth wide open .
__label__1	“ That 'll do , <NAME> , ” said <NAME> , giving her a slight nod ; “ you have been admired , and can go. ” She withdrew her hands and went out of the room , and <NAME> , putting the decanters on from his dumb-waiter , filled his glass and passed round the wine .
__label__1	To think that I should see him at last , and you should be able to know that I have told you the truth ! '
__label__1	That Mrs. <NAME> , impelled by gratitude , or ambition , or maternal pride , or maternal love , or all four powerful motives conjointly , had taken secret conference with <NAME> , and had finally returned to propose that <NAME> should instruct the four Miss Kenwigses in the <NAME> language as spoken by natives , at the weekly stipend of five shillings , current coin of the realm ; being at the rate of one shilling per week , per each Miss <NAME> , and one shilling over , until such time as the baby might be able to take it out in grammar .
__label__0	It was warm , and a bright sun darted his rays on the island .
__label__1	The rider stooped , and , casting up his eyes at the guard , handed the passenger a small folded paper .
__label__1	But when he substituted her father for herself , and told her how he would ride in his carriage , and how great and grand he would be , her tears of joy and innocent pride fell fast .
__label__1	She was a pretty , very diminutive , plump woman of from forty to fifty , with handsome eyes , though they had a curious habit of seeming to look a long way off .
__label__1	`` Well , well , '' says <NAME> , `` you train him respectable , and he 'll be a comfort to you , and look after you in your old age , you know . ''
__label__0	On the morning of the 3rd of September the `` Jeune-Hardie '' reached the head of Gaël-Hamkes Bay .
__label__1	‘ Well , well , ’ said <NAME> , smiling as good men smile when they compassionate their own weakness or that of their fellow-creatures , ‘ this is wide of the bull ’ s-eye .
__label__0	But this wager totally ruined him .
__label__1	But after twenty-one years the defendant ’ s wife died , and he very soon afterwards , at the age of seventy-eight , married a very young woman : which caused some anxiety to his two sons , whose poignant expressions of this feeling so exasperated their father , that he in his resentment executed a will to disinherit his eldest son , and in his fit of anger showed it to his second son , who instantly determined to get at it , and destroy it , in order to preserve the property to his brother .
__label__0	<NAME> Nature forbid approach to the Pole ?
__label__1	Whereas I now found <NAME> to be a disembodied spirit , or a fiction , and his inn the dingiest collection of shabby buildings ever squeezed together in a rank corner as a club for Tom-cats .
__label__0	The water and the biscuits were soon on board ; but longer time was necessary to procure supplies of coal , which , however , was to be got without any other expense save that of paying the muleteers , who transported it to the beach from a mine scarcely beneath the level of the earth , where it was to be picked up for nothing .
__label__1	“ As to thee , ” pursued madame , implacably , addressing her husband , “ if it depended on thee -- which , happily , it does not -- thou wouldst rescue this man even now. ” “ No ! ” protested Defarge .
__label__1	Oh so nice it was .
__label__1	‘ Did you speak , <NAME> ? ’ inquired <NAME> , senior , after an awful silence .
__label__1	She looked round with an air of incertitude , and advanced towards the stairs .
__label__1	It 's as good as another . ''
__label__1	There is <NAME> , clerk to <NAME> and <NAME> , who was at first as open as the sun at noon , but who suddenly shut up as close as midnight , under the influence -- no doubt -- of <NAME> 's suborning and tampering .
__label__0	`` It 's only <NAME> 's apparatus that is of any use in such depths . ''
__label__0	... everything ! ” Such were the loud and startling words which resounded through the air , above the vast watery desert of the <NAME> , about four o ’ clock in the evening of the 23rd of March , 1865 .
__label__0	To give body and existence to such new sensations would have required the coinage of new words -- and here my feeble brain found itself wholly at fault .
__label__1	‘ I debated with myself a long time , ’ she said in a low voice , ‘ whether to write this at all , in case of dying suddenly or by accident , and feeling the want of it upon me .
__label__1	I told you from the first , <NAME> , that I never give hopes .
__label__1	‘ Morfin ’ s here , ’ he answered , looking up with his widest and almost sudden smile ; ‘ humming musical recollections -- of his last night ’ s quartette party , I suppose -- through the walls between us , and driving me half mad .
__label__0	Just then <NAME> asked me what I knew about the wreck of <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> , forward ! ” But just as the two were about to leave the platform , a voice , as yet far distant , was heard in the depths of the shaft .
__label__1	He wouldn ’ t seem so old , though , to them as didn ’ t know him , for he was a little wanting here , ’ touching his forehead ; ‘ nobody at home , you know , if you knocked ever so often. ’ ‘ And you DID knock pretty often , I dare say ? ’ muttered <NAME> .
__label__1	Partly in remembrance of that , and partly in the hope of making money someday by the scheme , I took advantage of my position about you , and possessed myself of a hold upon you , which you would give half of all you have to know , and never can know but through me .
__label__1	‘ Wa ’ at I say , I stick by. ’ ‘ And that ’ s a fine thing to do , and manly too , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ though it ’ s not exactly what we understand by “ coming <NAME> over us ” in <NAME> .
__label__0	One island visited may be especially noticed ; it was named the island of _la Gente Hermosa_ on account of the beauty of its inhabitants , and of the fair colour and coquetry of its women , who , as the <NAME> declared , even bore away the palm for grace and attractiveness from their own fellow-countrywomen of <NAME> , whose beauty is proverbial .
__label__0	To them this courier from the <NAME> was a link which connected them with the empire .
__label__1	<NAME> , what views _have_ you set up as mine ? ’ ‘ Here is a man—and a young man , ’ said <NAME> , as if that made the matter infinitely worse , and he could have easily borne the loss of an old one , ‘ swept off the face of the earth by a deed of violence .
__label__0	I do not understand why <NAME> was not one of the greatest poets of the world . ''
__label__0	And yet , how was I to reject the evidence found on the body of the mate of the <NAME> , that <NAME> whose words were supported by ascertained dates ?
__label__1	Do I care for this girl , except as your friend ?
__label__0	At this time he sent away all his vessels to <NAME> to compel his companions to make a desperate resistance ; he recalled from Truxillo the forces under the command of <NAME> d'Alvarado , and entrusted to the latter a column of 500 men , which advanced to within several miles of the capital without having the slightest suspicion that the town was now in the hands of fellow-countrymen , who were fully determined to bar their passage .
__label__0	And what would be the use of the <NAME> , which would escape , owing to its position on the neutral line ?
__label__1	‘ That was our light porter at the <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ who brought you the message to-night .
__label__1	So there only remained <NAME> and <NAME> , who were both sobbing heartily ; the two brothers ; and <NAME> , who now came in to shake hands with everybody : his round face all radiant and beaming with smiles .
__label__0	It is a formidable weapon in their hands , and one they handle with surprising skill .
__label__0	Now that the sailors were reduced to idleness , there was nothing to do except to ponder on our critical situation , and invent some means of getting out of it .
__label__1	<NAME> in the helpless state that you see me in , is naturally anxious .
__label__0	The <NAME> Alps are of no great thickness , and the base is not more than eight miles wide .
__label__1	Yes ; I knew that <NAME> was looking out for me. ’ ‘ Do you keep a cat down there ? ’ asked <NAME> .
__label__0	`` _Less_ than _unity_ , you mean !
__label__1	We ’ re no losers , anyhow. ” For -- don ’ t you see , ’ said <NAME> , touching me with his pipe , ‘ it ain ’ t likely that a man so short of breath as myself , and a grandfather too , would go and strain points with a little bit of a blue-eyed blossom , like her ? ’ ‘ Not at all , I am certain , ’ said I .
__label__1	They soon grew into a habit ; and we are creatures of habit -- creatures of habit ! ’ Putting his hands into his pockets , and leaning back in his chair , he looked at the brother and sister as if it were interesting to him to see them together ; and went on to say , with a kind of irritable thoughtfulness : ‘ It ’ s this same habit that confirms some of us , who are capable of better things , in <NAME> ’ s own pride and stubbornness -- that confirms and deepens others of us in villainy -- more of us in indifference -- that hardens us from day to day , according to the temper of our clay , like images , and leaves us as susceptible as images to new impressions and convictions .
__label__0	Passepartout rushed out of the car .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , make us truly thankful , brother Ned , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	`` But our roving Projectile must pull up somewhere in the long run , '' replied <NAME> , `` and I should like to know where that somewhere can be , if not in the <NAME> . ''
__label__0	By looking steadily into its crater , you can see more cones than mortal eye ever lit on before .
__label__0	“ I should like you , therefore , ” continued the Major , “ before we actually start for <NAME> , to make one more examination of the documents .
__label__1	He set himself to find out , for the man might prove to be a messenger between those two .
__label__0	<NAME> , aware of the incidents of his predecessor 's stay in this port , wished above all to avoid similar scenes .
__label__1	While these , and many other encomiums , were being passed on the accomplished <NAME> , that young lady made the best of her way to the police-office ; whither , notwithstanding a little natural timidity consequent upon walking through the streets alone and unprotected , she arrived in perfect safety shortly afterwards .
__label__1	In the dark room -- for Mrs <NAME> ’ s head was no better yet , though she expected to recover permanently to-morrow -- were that lady , <NAME> , and Mr Dombey .
__label__0	Once , in action , he was leading a detachment of infantry through an intrenchment .
__label__1	And when we came at last to the five thousand cheeses ( canes he made it that day , I remember ) , my mother burst out crying .
__label__1	Mr Feeder in a black coat was at the bottom .
__label__1	Only come to see me as if you come by chance alonger <NAME> .
__label__0	These natives of <NAME> wore some clothing , and appeared altogether more civilized than those of <NAME> ; they inhabited houses made in the shape of tents and having high chimneys ; the interiors of these dwellings were remarkably clean and well kept .
__label__1	He cast back a dark look , and a threatening motion of the hand , towards the spot where he had left the bolder villain ; and went on his way : busying his bony hands in the folds of his tattered garment , which he wrenched tightly in his grasp , as though there were a hated enemy crushed with every motion of his fingers .
__label__1	`` I am well known to be prudent , '' says <NAME> , composedly smoking .
__label__1	He thought , if this man could be raised up now , what would be his foremost thoughts ?
__label__1	‘ Take that hat up again. ’ But this Sam flatly and positively refused to do ; and , after he had been severely reprimanded by his master , the officer , being in a hurry , condescended to pick it up himself , venting a great variety of threats against <NAME> meanwhile , which that gentleman received with perfect composure , merely observing that if <NAME> would have the goodness to put his hat on again , he would knock it into the latter end of next week .
__label__1	The fact is , <NAME> , I was unable to repurchase them at the time of their seizure ; in the first place , because the broker , having an idea that I wanted them , ran the price up to an extravagant extent ; and , in the second place , because I -- hadn ’ t any money .
__label__0	Tall grass blocked them up , and they were involved in the peril before they were aware .
__label__0	Dr. <NAME> carefully noted the fact , that he had stopped at four degrees north latitude and seventeen degrees west longitude .
__label__0	He would be all that they liked , “ even a professor of dancing and deportment , ” said he to <NAME> , if that was ever necessary .
__label__0	The walls , which were of cut marble , are entirely crumbled away , but their length over three quarters of a league , is still discernible .
__label__1	The young lady then , by an easy digression , led the discourse to her own wardrobe , and after recounting its principal beauties at some length , took her friend upstairs to make inspection thereof .
__label__1	<NAME> of vich , they retires from the world , and shuts themselves up in pikes ; partly with the view of being solitary , and partly to rewenge themselves on mankind by takin ’ tolls. ’ ‘ Dear me , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ I never knew that before. ’ ‘ Fact , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> ; ‘ if they was gen ’ l ’ m ’ n , you ’ d call ‘ em misanthropes , but as it is , they only takes to pike-keepin ’ . ’ With such conversation , possessing the inestimable charm of blending amusement with instruction , did <NAME> beguile the tediousness of the journey , during the greater part of the day .
__label__0	My eyes turned involuntarily towards the glass , but I could not stand the fire which seemed to devour them .
__label__1	After a short pause of repose , <NAME> -- in the absence of the little servant who , it seemed , retired to the bosom of her family on Sunday afternoons -- washed up the tea-things , in a trifling lady-like amateur manner that compromised none of us .
__label__0	It is the residence of one of the sultans of the <NAME> country , where civilization is , perhaps , the least backward .
__label__1	In one of these rooms , was a window looking into the street , where the child sat , many and many a long evening , and often far into the night , alone and thoughtful .
__label__0	<NAME> , a <NAME> historian , born A.D. 105 , wrote an account of the navigation of the <NAME> or <NAME> , and pointed out as nearly as possible , the countries that had been discovered by explorers who had lived before his time ; and Ptolemy the <NAME> , about A.D. 175 , making use of the writings of his predecessors , published a celebrated geography , in which , for the first time , places and cities were marked in their relative latitude and longitude on a mathematical plan .
__label__1	‘ Well ? ’ ‘ Well , ’ said the cobbler , ‘ he left five thousand pound behind him. ’ ‘ And wery gen-teel in him so to do , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ This morning , <NAME> ’ am , ’ returned the Major .
__label__1	I suppose you don ’ t mind that ? ’ ‘ Not at all , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	Father , he did gain it .
__label__1	They never could have led a happy life together ; but nothing could have made it more unhappy , than the wilful and determined warfare of such elements .
__label__1	If <NAME> had been worse paid for his office , or better qualified to discharge it , he would have considered these visits complimentary and agreeable ; but , holding the position of a handsomely-remunerated humbug , he resented them .
__label__1	And whereas , in his own schoolmaster clothes , he usually looked as if they were the clothes of some other man , he now looked , in the clothes of some other man or men , as if they were his own .
__label__0	At this cry the whole ship 's crew hurried towards the harpooner -- commander , officers , masters , sailors , cabin boys ; even the engineers left their engines , and the stokers their furnaces .
__label__0	Their weapons were javelins tipped with a fish-bone .
__label__1	That 's not my sort either . ''
__label__0	But this state of things was before long to come to an end .
__label__0	“ So we shall not escape ! ” said <NAME> , between his teeth .
__label__0	I knew not what argument would now tell in my favour .
__label__1	But you began by saying that we took different views , you know .

__label__1	To this would succeed a labyrinth of bare passages and pillared galleries , with the family procession already preparing in the quadrangle below , through the carriages and luggage being brought together by the servants for the day ’ s journey .

__label__0	Nominated ambassador at <NAME> , <NAME> determined to profit by the leisure he enjoyed in travelling as an artist and archæologist through the <NAME> of <NAME> and <NAME> .
__label__0	The next day they left <NAME> 's Bay on the starboard , and two days later , <NAME> and <NAME> ; finally , July 14th , they doubled <NAME> , and the 15th the brig anchored in <NAME> Bay at the end of the channel .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , you an ’ t worth powder and shot , but I ’ ll be even with you one way or another. ’ ‘ Stop , ’ interposed <NAME> , as <NAME> was about to speak .
__label__0	<NAME> over , the observers returned to their post .
__label__0	But that is not the question we have to settle .
__label__1	When such a man is not deterred from regarding her as his equal , and when he has convinced himself that there is no blemish on her , I think the fact must be taken to be pretty expressive. ’ ‘ And there is such a man ? ’ said the Secretary .
__label__1	<NAME> , and <NAME> and Means , you ’ re all up in , so we shall only want one rehearsal .
__label__1	But , in the absence of any such miraculous provision , my desire was to apply myself to some pursuit that would not lie too heavily upon her purse ; and to do my duty in it , whatever it might be .
__label__1	Do I understand you ? ’ ‘ I couldn ’ t have understood myself better , sir. ’ ‘ There , then , ’ said <NAME> , tossing the pocket-book upon the table .
__label__1	She and her husband had worked too , and had brought their simple faith and honour clean out of dustheaps .
__label__1	These Doctors ’ <NAME> fellows are the gayest men in town , I believe , and beat us sober <NAME> people all to nothing ! ’ His bright glance went merrily round the room , as he took the seat on the sofa opposite to me , which Mrs. Micawber had recently vacated , and stirred the fire into a blaze .

__label__0	As to supposing she had not arrived at the appointed rendezvous , that was out of the question .
__label__1	And very amiable he looked , and a very low bow he made , as he advanced , and setting himself down at the nearest table , ordered something to drink of the grinning <NAME> .
__label__1	Let me ask two questions .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> , moving towards the staircase-foot , watches her as she goes up the steps the old man came down to his grave , past murderous groups of statuary repeated with their shadowy weapons on the wall , past the printed bill , which she looks at going by , out of view .
__label__1	The humble individual who addresses you was once under her charge .
__label__1	But she uttered no sound , and her breathing was no slower .
__label__1	But to be sure that was a sight behind the scenes , which nobody saw , and which nobody was meant to see .
__label__0	<NAME> was of opinion that <NAME> was an island , and that <NAME> , Oku-Jesso , and <NAME> existed only in imagination ; whilst <NAME> insisted that <NAME> and Oku-Jesso were merely an island , ending at <NAME> ; and lastly , <NAME> , in his `` Considérations Géographiques , '' page 105 , says , `` <NAME> , after being placed first in the east , then in the south , and finally in the west , was at last found to be in the north .

__label__0	yes , indeed ! ” said <NAME> , reflecting ; “ the trade-winds -- yes -- truly -- one might -- there ’ s something in that ! ” “ Something in it -- yes , my excellent friend -- there ’ s EVERY THING in it .

__label__1	The Jew shook his head , and was about to reply , when the stranger , interrupting him , motioned to the house , before which they had by this time arrived : remarking , that he had better say what he had got to say , under cover : for his blood was chilled with standing about so long , and the wind blew through him .
__label__1	He smooths it out upon the table with his heavy palm , and thoughtfully walking up and down the gallery , makes a halt before it every now and then to come upon it with a fresh eye .
__label__1	Still , it is to be feared that this injustice is inseparable from the state of things with which humanity and truth are called upon to deal .
__label__0	The governor was not well pleased at this news , for he thought that he ought to have had his share in the islands ; but he concealed his displeasure , and gave the new comers a hearty welcome .
__label__0	Perhaps its springs were left to wear out , its wheels to get clogged .
__label__0	J. T. <NAME> , bending over the mouthpiece of the instrument , received the hardest voltaic knock that had ever found the mouth of a philosopher .
__label__0	“ I account for it in this way , ” answered <NAME> : “ the earth was traveling at the rate of 28,000 leagues an hour , and <NAME> at the rate of 57,000 leagues an hour , therefore the result was the same as though a train rushing along at a speed of about 86,000 leagues an hour had suddenly encountered some obstacle .
__label__0	They were without news from the civilised world , lost on this island , as completely as if they had been on the most minute star of the celestial hemisphere !
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> tripped up the steps to the house-door , tripped down the steps with the key , tripped across the little garden , and opened the gate .

__label__0	A large stone standing in the middle of the room was the fireplace ; above , in the roof , was a hole for the smoke to pass through .
__label__1	She began with sorrowful unwillingness to acknowledge to herself that she was not strong enough to keep off the fear that no space in the life of man could overcome that quarter of a century behind the prison bars .
__label__0	He , no doubt , expected that his reply would close the examination , but <NAME> commenced again , and said : “ <NAME> , I am not a <NAME> prosecutor charged with your indictment .
__label__0	Not wishing to be recognised , the young woman drew back from the window , feeling much alarm at her discovery .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> embarked at <NAME> , on July 14th , 1678 , carrying with them about thirty men , workmen and soldiers , and a <NAME> ( monk ) , <NAME> , who accompanied them in all their voyages .
__label__0	“ Had we not taken the precaution to lighten the balloon yesterday evening , we should have been lost beyond redemption , ” said the doctor , after a long silence .
__label__0	If the boat had not returned in the afternoon a second was to be sent in search of us .
__label__0	In 1822 , <NAME> Laing explored all the western part of <NAME> near to the <NAME> possessions ; and he it was who got so far as the sources of the <NAME> ; and , according to his documents , the spring in which that immense river takes its rise is not two feet broad .
__label__1	In the evening , he found the dinner-table laid for four , but they sat down only three .
__label__0	Had all the sixteen men who accompanied <NAME> , and of whom no news was received , met a like fate ?
__label__0	<NAME> was so elated with these happy results , that he arranged to revisit his own country , leaving Courtois as governor during his absence .
__label__0	“ Now , ” said <NAME> , “ take two guns , friend <NAME> -- one for yourself and one for <NAME> -- and both of you try to bring back some nice cuts of antelope-meat ; they will make us a good dinner. ” “ Off to the hunt ! ” exclaimed <NAME> , joyously .
__label__1	But she 's patienter than others would be , and is clever too , and always willing , up to the full mark of her strength and over .
__label__1	I have been very unhappy since she died .
__label__0	But if the small towns of <NAME> and <NAME> , which he passed on the next day , were comparatively quiet , owing to their position in the <NAME> , was it not to be dreaded that , upon the right banks of the <NAME> , <NAME> would have much more to fear from man ?
__label__1	‘ We hadn ’ t any thoughts of having a gentleman with us , sir , until you were kind enough to suggest it , and our accommodation ’ s not extensive .

__label__0	`` The colour of their skin is clear brown , their hair is very black , their faces are round , their nose and lips are somewhat thick but not flat , their eyes are black and bright enough , and tolerably expressive .
__label__1	Rising softly , for my charge lay fast asleep , I looked out of the window .
__label__0	“ Yes , captain. ” “ And it astonishes me also , <NAME> , ” replied he , “ but when we visit the hull of the brig , we shall no doubt find the explanation of the matter. ” “ Why , captain , ” said <NAME> , “ you don ’ t suppose that the ‘ Speedy ’ simply foundered like a ship which has struck on a rock ? ” “ Why not , ” observed Neb , “ if there are rocks in the channel ? ” “ <NAME> , <NAME> , ” answered <NAME> , “ you did not look at the right moment .
__label__0	It was resolved to proceed upon the same plan as heretofore , following the boundary of the land at a safe distance .
__label__1	This was addressed to <NAME> , who now made his appearance ; that gentleman , motioning <NAME> to retire , brought in the two ladies , and shut the door .
__label__0	Was all I had heard really and truly possible ?
__label__0	Then he shook it , and a few coins inside sounded with a metallic ring .
__label__1	‘ Oh , how good of you !
__label__1	‘ You will doubtless be surprised , my dear <NAME> , to receive this communication .
__label__1	`` This is a very sensible woman , '' said my guardian .
__label__0	And yet it was not like the sun , for it gave no heat .
__label__1	Why do you take me , ’ said Mr <NAME> , ‘ to the glittering halls with which I can never compete , and then taunt me with my moderate salary ?
__label__0	A third method -- to measure the mountain profile directly by means of the micrometer -- is evidently applicable only to altitudes lying exactly on the lunar rim . ''
__label__0	If light was thus obtained , so would a means of access , for it would be as easy to pierce a door as windows , and to establish an exterior ladder .
__label__1	I know I am a silly little thing ! ’ said <NAME> , slowly looking from one of us to the other , and then putting up her pretty lips to kiss us as she lay upon her couch .
__label__1	The conjunction of events which made him famous , happened , briefly , thus .
__label__1	<NAME> Leicester sits like a statue , gazing at the cruel finger that is probing the life-blood of his heart .
__label__1	For , my young friends , '' suddenly addressing the 'prentices and <NAME> , to their consternation , `` if I am told by the doctor that calomel or castor-oil is good for me , I may naturally ask what is calomel , and what is castor-oil .
__label__1	Anywhere in the immediate vicinity there might be seen pictures of ships speeding away full sail to all parts of the world ; outfitting warehouses ready to pack off anybody anywhere , fully equipped in half an hour ; and little timber midshipmen in obsolete naval uniforms , eternally employed outside the shop doors of nautical Instrument-makers in taking observations of the hackney carriages .
__label__0	You would do as much for me. ” “ I am not quite so sure , ” said <NAME> candidly .
__label__0	The streets were wide , planted with oaks , and the houses were white , or , to <NAME> 's surprise , painted green .
__label__0	<NAME> , however , could still hear <NAME> shouting : “ I say !
__label__1	‘ And not a wery sure one , neither , ’ added <NAME> ; ‘ I got reg ’ larly done the other day. ’ ‘ No ! ’ said his father .
__label__1	‘ Come , you let me alone , ’ said the boy , parrying <NAME> ’ s hand with both his elbows alternatively .
__label__1	The journey seemed endless ; street after street was entered and left behind ; and still they went jolting on .
__label__0	But it pleased God to prevent the accomplishment of these terrible projects .
__label__1	‘ The principal productions of these towns , ’ says <NAME> , ‘ appear to be soldiers , sailors , <NAME> , chalk , shrimps , officers , and dockyard men .
__label__0	The two great barrels , hermetically sealed , but which sounded hollow and empty , were fastened to its sides by strong ropes , knotted with a skill which <NAME> directly pronounced sailors alone could exhibit .
__label__1	‘ Oh , <NAME> ’ en <NAME> , <NAME> ’ en <NAME> ! ’ said <NAME> , making her chin rigid , and shaking it in unison with what , but for the weakness of her sex , might be described as her fist .
__label__1	‘ Why , that ’ s the very thing , ’ replied <NAME> , as though his thoughts were about them at that moment .
__label__1	I have only just come to a decision to take one .
__label__0	The soda , which it was easy to change into carbonate of soda , and the chlorine , of which he made chloride of lime , were employed for various domestic purposes , and especially in bleaching linen .
__label__0	Indeed , he would have asked for nothing better , but for lack of wind , the thing had become impossible .
__label__1	Nearly all the inmates of the prison had assembled to witness its removal ; they fell back on either side when the widower appeared ; he walked hurriedly forward , and stationed himself , alone , in a little railed area close to the lodge gate , from whence the crowd , with an instinctive feeling of delicacy , had retired .
__label__0	Would you have acted differently , captain ? ” “ <NAME> , <NAME> , ” replied <NAME> .
__label__1	But then quickly added , reading <NAME> ’ s face : ‘ No .
__label__0	Our globe , the only object which caught my view in immensity , seemed ready to be annihilated , and above us the depths of the starry skies were lost in thick darkness .
__label__0	During the ensuing days the distance between the two planets continued to decrease , and it became more and more obvious that the earth , on her new orbit , was about to cross the orbit of <NAME> .
__label__0	His pulse beat fast as he recalled the friends and comrades with whom he had spent the last few years in that vanished city .
__label__1	But I ’ ll tell you what I do see , <NAME> , ’ glancing up at the windows ; ‘ I see the light of fire and candle in your mother ’ s room ! ’ ‘ And what has that to do with it ? ’ ‘ Why , sir , I read by it , ’ said Mr Flintwinch , screwing himself at him , ‘ that if it ’ s advisable ( as the proverb says it is ) to let sleeping dogs lie , it ’ s just as advisable , perhaps , to let missing dogs lie .
__label__0	However numerous it may have been , this army was quickly routed by a small detachment , composed of 200 infantry , twenty-five cavalry , and twenty-five dogs .
__label__0	I never saw it before -- are you sure it is not out of your collection ? ''
__label__0	To a solitary individual , a little troop of eight men , all mounted and well armed , wore a suspicious aspect , so that any intercourse either with honest men or even banditti , was almost impossible .
__label__0	`` Long may he wave , and may his shadow never grow less ! ''
__label__0	The fishing-boats were ornamented at the prow and the poop by the face of a grinning man with hideous features , lolling tongue and eyes made of white shells .
__label__0	These descriptions of antiquities , which in our own day are accurately known by drawings and photographs , have , however , little value for us ; and are merely interesting as indicating the state of the ruins when <NAME> visited them , and enabling us to judge how far the depredations of the Arabs have since changed them .
__label__1	I observed , upon that closer opportunity of observation , that she was worn and haggard , and that her sunken eyes expressed privation and endurance .
__label__1	He rode like a highwayman .
__label__0	He collected many facts about the interior of the country , choosing instinctively those only which could be amply substantiated .
__label__1	I never can , believe me .
__label__0	The <NAME> , on his feet in one instant and on the top of the ladder in another , attempted to shut the lid of a half open box , speaking in an angry but suppressed voice : `` Stop this hullabaloo , wo n't you ?
__label__1	They were in a book , and it happened to be in the next room -- our sitting-room , dividing <NAME> 's chamber from mine .
__label__1	It seems like making a great disturbance about nothing particular . ''
__label__0	The two ships at length reached D'Entrecasteaux Strait , which had escaped the notice of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> and <NAME> , and the discovery of which was the result of a mistake , which might have had dangerous consequences .
__label__0	As far as the eye could reach on the white plain behind , red trails were visible .
__label__1	I replaced the razor in its usual drawer , unfastened the door , and called loudly for assistance .
__label__0	And <NAME> , lying down on the bank , plunged his arm into the water , and soon pulled up several dozen of fine crayfish from among the stores .
__label__0	A long flame twisted and bent under the gale , on the summit of the old tower .
__label__1	I was thinking <NAME> seemed out of sorts. ’ ‘ Me ! ’ cried <NAME> , biting her lips , and trembling with very jealousy .
__label__1	Mrs. Pardiggle , leading the way with a great show of moral determination and talking with much volubility about the untidy habits of the people ( though I doubted if the best of us could have been tidy in such a place ) , conducted us into a cottage at the farthest corner , the ground-floor room of which we nearly filled .
__label__1	‘ I agree to that. ’ ‘ I have your word and honour , sir ? ’ ‘ My good fellow , ’ retorted Mr Boffin , ‘ you have my word ; and how you can have that , without my honour too , I don ’ t know .
__label__0	She had already passed through rough experiences without seeming to suffer from them , for she was a sailor 's daughter , used from infancy to the fatigues of the sea , and even <NAME> was not dismayed to see her struggling in the midst of this severe climate , against the dangers of the polar seas .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> came to meet them , and , as a stranger , announced his name and rank .
__label__1	When <NAME> was dressed -- which was very soon done , for he felt unwell and drowsy , and was not able to stand about it very long -- he went down into the drawing-room ; where he found <NAME> pacing up and down the room full dressed , but with a dignified and unconcerned demeanour , as if he thought it barely possible that one or two people might drop in by and by .
__label__0	Two of the vessels , the <NAME> and the <NAME> , were engulfed , and four others were lost sight of .
__label__0	“ Does not <NAME> please you then ? ” asked <NAME> .
__label__1	My uncle peeped out of the coach window as they emerged from the yard , and observed that the other mails , with coachmen , guards , horses , and passengers , complete , were driving round and round in circles , at a slow trot of about five miles an hour .
__label__0	Where could it be hidden ? ''
__label__0	The unmounted horsemen might walk , of course , as many squatters had done already ; but if they abandoned the wagon , what would the ladies do ?
__label__0	So it went on for two hours ; then his thoughts changed ; he began to think of the Pole , and he saw himself at last setting foot on this English continent , and unfolding the flag of the <NAME> .
__label__1	In the autumn of the year , <NAME> and <NAME> were creeping up to the highest ridges of the Alps .
__label__1	As he did so , a small case in which the <NAME> was accustomed to carry the lists of his day 's duties , fell lightly on the floor .
__label__1	You have to do with a man also .
__label__0	The whole of the coast-line of <NAME> was now accurately laid down , but at the cost of what struggles , devotion , privations , and sufferings ?
__label__0	The admiral gave it the name of <NAME> , and all the crews chanted the <NAME> in sign of thankfulness .
__label__1	And there are the office lads in their first surtouts , who feel a befitting contempt for boys at day-schools , club as they go home at night , for saveloys and porter , and think there ’ s nothing like ‘ life. ’ There are varieties of the genus , too numerous to recapitulate , but however numerous they may be , they are all to be seen , at certain regulated business hours , hurrying to and from the places we have just mentioned .
__label__1	And if I knew him , and I might , I would go down on my knees to him , and take his hand and kiss it and ask him not to draw it away , but to leave it -- O to leave it for a moment -- and let my thankful tears fall on it ; for I have no other thanks to give him ! ’ <NAME> had put his hand to her lips , and would have kneeled to him , but he gently prevented her , and replaced her in her chair .
__label__0	“ You are going away ? ” “ Yes , ” replied the <NAME> , understanding his gesture .
__label__0	We know already that our travellers , as well as astronomers generally , judging from that portion of the dark side occasionally revealed by the <NAME> 's librations , were _pretty certain_ that there is no great difference between her two sides , as far as regards their physical constitutions .
__label__0	His fate was uncertain until it was discovered by <NAME> .
__label__1	Some of the neighbours threw up their windows , and called across the street to each other that old <NAME> ’ s housekeeper must have dropped down dead .
__label__1	‘ That ’ s a dreadful fellow. ’ ‘ The alligator , sir ? ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> ha ! ’ <NAME> gave a satisfactory account of all the little household at <NAME> .
__label__0	We now correct this mistake , which has been repeated in all subsequent editions . ]
__label__0	Would not the rays of the sun melt away its fragile walls ?
__label__0	<NAME> clasped his hands , and remained motionless .
__label__1	But soon the steeples called good people all , to church and chapel , and away they came , flocking through the streets in their best clothes , and with their gayest faces .
__label__0	It was all very well for an Englishman like <NAME> to make the tour of the world with a carpet-bag ; a lady could not be expected to travel comfortably under such conditions .
__label__0	My body was subtilized , or rather became volatile , and commingled in a state of atomic vapor , with the prodigious clouds , which rushed forward like a mighty comet into infinite space !
__label__1	He makes dreadful mouths as he rules the ciphering-book ; and now he throws his eye sideways down our lane , and we all droop over our books and tremble .
__label__0	The words `` blockhead '' and `` booby '' were the mildest which they now applied to each other .
__label__1	But one morning when she happened to come upon him suddenly , from a by-path among some pollard willows which terminated in the little shelving piece of stony ground that lay between his dwelling and the water , where he was bending over a fire he had made to caulk the old boat which was lying bottom upwards , close by , he raised his head at the sound of her footstep , and gave her Good morning .
__label__1	I don ’ t mind telling you , <NAME> , although I ’ m dreadful jealous by nature -- horrid -- that the lady is in this house. ’ Here <NAME> took off his spectacles , on purpose to wink , and then put them on again .
__label__0	This would have taken too long with the pickaxe alone , and it is known that <NAME> was an ingenious man .
__label__1	<NAME> was not long in making his toilet ; having taken some breakfast , he replied to a surly inquiry from <NAME> , by saying that he was quite ready .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> us on what grounds you make this accusation , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	This reasoning calmed me a little and I began to hope !
__label__0	On the 3rd May Lander at last left <NAME> en route for <NAME> .
__label__1	They were polite , but pale ; and spoke low ; and they were so depressed in their spirits , that in comparison with the general tone of that company , <NAME> was a perfect <NAME> , or complete <NAME> Book. ’ And yet he had a sense of injury upon him , too , had <NAME> .
__label__1	If you ca n't get to be oncommon through going straight , you 'll never get to do it through going crooked .
__label__0	There existed no passage , no sign of any other tunnel .
__label__1	<NAME> was at the breakfast-table to make the tea again , however ; and I had the melancholy pleasure of taking off my hat to her in the phaeton , as she stood on the door-step with <NAME> in her arms .
__label__1	The name of that lady no longer appeared on the flaming door-plate , that of <NAME> being substituted in its stead ; but the bonnets and dresses were still dimly visible in the first-floor windows by the decaying light of a summer ’ s evening , and excepting this ostensible alteration in the proprietorship , the establishment wore its old appearance .
__label__0	In fact , when the boat was abandoned at the sources of the <NAME> , it had been agreed that after having surveyed the west coast , they should go back to it , and return to <NAME> by the <NAME> .
__label__0	I have not a map of the <NAME> , but my memory has preserved a very clear recollection of its southern part .
__label__1	Because such inclinations are among the vicious qualities of mankind .
__label__0	`` Aye , aye , sir ; do n't be uneasy . ''
__label__1	Beyond town , we found a heavy mist out , and it fell wet and thick .
__label__1	<NAME> saw surprise and curiosity in the faces flitting past her ; saw long shadows coming back upon the pavement ; and heard voices that were strange to her asking her where she went , and what the matter was ; and though these frightened her the more at first , and made her hurry on the faster , they did her the good service of recalling her in some degree to herself , and reminding her of the necessity of greater composure .
__label__0	<NAME> , to avoid a collision , gave the order for the discharge from the swivel gun above the natives ' heads , but although the noise terrified them , they still continued their approach .
__label__1	It had been matter of conversation with <NAME> when she was last in town , and this visit was the result .
__label__0	I do not comprehend you .
__label__0	<NAME> hurriedly visited some of the islands of the <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> .
__label__1	Having made sure of his watching me , I tempt him on , all over <NAME> .
__label__1	said a man , bursting out of a beer-shop , with a white dog at his heels ; 'young Oliver !
__label__1	He shall not bully me -- he shall not bully me .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> returned to his companions , and said simply -- `` In an hour the opening will be practicable . ''
__label__0	His eyes were strangely bright , and his thoughts were boiling within him .
__label__0	You 're as bad as the rest of us !
__label__0	I cried , `` certainly a small sturgeon . ''
__label__0	There is a want of clearness as to dates at this part of his life , which makes it difficult to give a correct narrative of these voyages in their right order .
__label__1	You ask yourself , how would all them ancestors of yours , away to <NAME> -- not to go beyond him at present -- have borne that blow ; you remember scores of them that would have borne it well ; and you bear it well on their accounts , and to maintain the family credit .
__label__0	It was inevitably unfortunate , since <NAME> , or <NAME> , as he may be called , guided it , sometimes preceded , sometimes followed by his band of convicts , who had been told what they had to do .
__label__1	Unmoved , unchanged ! ’ This , by the way , was a very remarkable circumstance , miniatures being liable to so many changes of expression -- ‘ Oh , <NAME> !
__label__1	‘ You have purposely cast a dreadful suspicion upon my mother ’ s house .
__label__1	Have a skein of the best , and some new buttons for the coat , and -- this is a good idea , <NAME> , and one you ’ ll like , I know -- as I have never given her anything yet , and girls like such attentions , you shall polish up a sparking necklace that I have got upstairs , and I ’ ll give it her upon the wedding morning -- clasp it round her charming little neck myself -- and take it away again next day .
__label__1	We are not likely to meet often , for some time to come ; but I shall be a good correspondent of <NAME> ’ s , and we shall frequently hear of one another that way. ’ We were now within the little courtyard of the <NAME> ’ s cottage .
__label__0	However , for the sake of argument , suppose I reply in the affirmative , and say that _the Moon is inhabitable_ . ''
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> had till now thought only of doing a kind action ; but now another idea flashed into his brain ; the question presented itself under quite a new aspect .
__label__1	<NAME> was pretty sure to be there expecting me , and we went on together through the frosty air and gathering fog towards the twinkling lights of the town .

__label__1	<NAME> , therefore , not being a high-spirited young man according to common parlance , and deeming it a greater degradation to borrow , for the supply of his necessities , from <NAME> , than to teach <NAME> to the little Kenwigses for five shillings a week , accepted the offer with the alacrity already described , and betook himself to the first floor with all convenient speed .
__label__1	“ It is under my arm , ” said <NAME> , in smothered tones , “ you shall not draw it .
__label__0	Doubtless he wanted to know to what <NAME> was coming .
__label__1	To whom , in a few easy words adapted to his capacity , <NAME> stated the question at issue .
__label__0	[ Illustration ] `` It 's gone , '' said the doctor .
__label__1	‘ You are an errand-boy for aught I know , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	In the bows of all the other canoes fetish priests were dancing , and performing various extraordinary antics , their persons , as well as those of the people with them , being chalked over in the same manner as that of King Boy ; and , to crown the whole , Mr .
__label__0	The flashes dazzled and almost blinded them .
__label__1	Secondly , to pay the rent -- here it is .
__label__1	That was all , and what was that !
__label__0	Had this meteor any relation to the phenomena going on in the bowels of the earth ?
__label__0	`` Still , '' resumed <NAME> , `` we are in a more open sea ; we are going along a well-known route ; do n't you exaggerate somewhat , <NAME> ? ''
__label__1	‘ My darling girl , ’ she began again .
__label__1	he said , rising and pushing back his chair .
__label__1	I had never been shown my mama 's grave .
__label__0	<NAME> V. had no means of judging fairly on which side the justice of the case lay , for he had only heard of it from the interested parties ; he could only discern the deplorable consequences to his own government of the civil war .
__label__1	‘ He is quite well , <NAME> , thank you , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	In fact , a communication had been sent to many of the journals of both continents , concluding with a demand for immediate inquiry on the part of those interested .
__label__1	It is quite still and silent .
__label__1	‘ My pet , if you please .
__label__1	‘ See ! ’ said <NAME> , ‘ miniature flour-barrel , rolling-pin , spice-box , shelf of brown jars , chopping-board , coffee-mill , dresser elegantly furnished with crockery , saucepans and pans , roasting jack , a charming kettle , an armoury of dish-covers .
__label__0	Nevertheless , as that which belongs to nobody belongs to all , the new society did not propose to “ take ” but to “ acquire. ” In the <NAME> there is no project so audacious for which people can not be found to guarantee the cost and find the working expenses .
__label__1	‘ If you please , sir , would you have the goodness to walk in , and speak to <NAME> ? ’ ‘ <NAME> sent you for me ? ’ I inquired .
__label__1	Exactly my own views , Mr Boffin. ’ Here <NAME> rose , and balancing himself on his wooden leg , fluttered over his prey with extended hand .
__label__0	But I am talking too much about myself : the great thing is about you. ” “ No , my child , ” said <NAME> , “ tell us everything that comes to your mind. ” “ My grandfather , ” continued <NAME> , “ always regarded your abode in the mine with a very evil eye -- not that there was any lack of space .
__label__1	It was all right enough. ’ ‘ One of the gentlemen , the one who didn ’ t speak while I was there , looked hard at me .
__label__1	Perhaps , taken altogether , from top to bottom , it was the most inconvenient little house in <NAME> , and the crookedest ; but then , <NAME> said , what a situation !
__label__1	‘ My dear <NAME> , I am here. ’ ‘ How long is this to last , <NAME> ? ’ <NAME> shook his head .
__label__1	It ’ s a popular prejudice , <NAME> ; and yet I am sure I don ’ t know why , for I have been trusted in my time to a considerable amount , and I can safely say that I never forsook my trust until it deserted me -- never .
__label__1	Those are of a different kind .
__label__0	The Russians undertook the instruction of the <NAME> , and at the end of a few days , during which the temperature was only endurable through the absence of wind , there was not a Gallian who could not skate tolerably well , while many of them could describe figures involving the most complicated curves .
__label__1	He puts it to his ears , and it whispers information ; he puts it to his lips , and it enjoins him to secrecy ; he rubs it over his nose , and it sharpens his scent ; he shakes it before a guilty man , and it charms him to his destruction .
__label__1	At last , after much fruitless inquiry , <NAME> , followed by the coach and <NAME> , found a man who had once resided in that vanished land , and who was no other than the master sweep before referred to , grown stout , and knocking a double knock at his own door .
__label__0	Then his presentiments returned in greater strength than before , and he listened anxiously to the sounds outside the hut .
__label__1	He was not only a very dexterous thief , but was notorious for his boldness and hardihood , and for the number of his previous convictions .
__label__0	A huge cloud of dust swept along the road from <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> , sitting by , looked down at the dark eyelashes lying wet on the flushed cheeks , and looked with gentleness and pity , for she knew the truth .
__label__0	<NAME> , the reporter , <NAME> , and <NAME> , embarked in turn .
__label__0	The two bodies lay stretched side by side .
__label__0	Was he engaged in a struggle with some animal whose retreat he had disturbed ?
__label__0	For some time past the <NAME> had not spoken to me of his projects of flight ; he was less communicative , almost silent .
__label__1	I haven ’ t any great liking for that. ’ ‘ No , to be sure , ’ he assented .
__label__0	He chose a clear place on the shore , which the ebbing tide had left perfectly level .
__label__0	The sole expedient that their united counsel could suggest was to obtain a refuge below ground , and _that_ was denied them by the strange and impenetrable substratum of the soil ; yet hour by hour the sun ’ s disc was lessening in its dimensions , and although at midday some faint radiance and glow were to be distinguished , during the night the painfulness of the cold was becoming almost intolerable .
__label__1	‘ Address your observations to me , sir , ’ interposed <NAME> ; ‘ I alone am to blame , if anybody be. ’ ‘ Oh !
__label__1	And so , like the country mouse in the second year of a famine , come to see the town mouse , and timidly threading his way to the town-mouse ’ s lodging through a city of cats , this old man passes in the streets .
__label__1	You ’ d persuade me if you could , that you are a poor Jew .
__label__1	Elsewhere , people are restless , worried , hurried about , anxious respecting one thing , anxious respecting another .
__label__0	“ Very well ; let us get on to the town , for our fair travelers , with all their courage , will not be sorry , I fancy , to have a good night ’ s rest. ” “ My dear <NAME> , <NAME> and I will accept it gladly , but only on the condition that it will cause no delay , or take us the least out of the road. ” “ It will do neither , ” replied <NAME> .
__label__0	As soon as the whole party were ensconced in the <NAME> , <NAME> asked Thalcave what he thought was best to be done .
__label__1	Thus reasoned <NAME> , and in pursuance of this reasoning he and his friend soon afterwards repaired to <NAME> ’ s , there to execute a plan of operations concerted by <NAME> himself , avowedly to promote his friend ’ s object , and really to attain his own .
__label__1	‘ That sort of people. -- -Are they really animals and clods , and beings of another order ?
__label__1	So glad of the opportunity , I am sure ! ’ When the first shock fell upon him , <NAME> twice skipped back in his neat little shoes and his neat little silk stockings of a bygone fashion , as if impelled to leap over a sofa behind him ; but the large man closed with him and proved too strong .
__label__0	Two saddles hung from stakes driven into the wall ; a large straw hat , a drum only used in war-time , a few lances , a bow , a quiver , and some arrows , were the only ornaments .
__label__0	<NAME> and <NAME> skinned them , and only brought back to <NAME> their fat and skin , this skin being intended for the manufacture of boots .
__label__1	‘ YOU , who never cooked when you were at home ? ’ ‘ Yes , <NAME> , ’ returned <NAME> ; ‘ that is precisely the state of the case. ’ She girded herself with a white apron , and busily with knots and pins contrived a bib to it , coming close and tight under her chin , as if it had caught her round the neck to kiss her .
__label__1	The room was a pleasant one , at the top of the house , overlooking the sea , on which the moon was shining brilliantly .
__label__0	In the meanwhile the “ Bonadventure ” entered the winding channels among the reefs , and <NAME> observed every turn with extreme care .
__label__1	It is always understood among the initiated , that that faithless lover must be planted at table opposite to <NAME> , who will then strike conversational fire out of him .
__label__1	It was to be , you thought , and why discuss or dispute it ? ’ It was new and strange to him to have himself presented to himself so clearly , in a glass of her holding up .
__label__1	There is no school in which a pupil gets on so fast , as that in which <NAME> became a scholar when he gave <NAME> the kiss .
__label__1	After waiting for a moment to receive some assurance to the contrary , and not receiving any , <NAME> proceeds , `` If it had been <NAME> and <NAME> , I should have gone at once to your ladyship 's solicitor , <NAME> , of the <NAME> .
__label__0	The next day , the 22nd of March , at six in the morning , preparations for departure were begun .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , aye , ’ said the little man ; ‘ that ’ s a matter of opinion , you know , and we won ’ t dispute about terms ; because of course you can ’ t be expected to view these subjects with a professional eye .
__label__1	What was the end of it ?
__label__0	“ Why , doctor , can you light up such darkness as this ? ” “ Who knows , <NAME> ? ” “ Ah !
__label__1	He went away this morning , father , and he cried very much at going , and he hoped you would forgive him. ’ ‘ Let him never come a nigh me to ask me my forgiveness , ’ said the father , again emphasizing his words with the knife .
__label__1	I wouldn ’ t touch the ‘ lowance , not if I was dying of want , <NAME> ’ l <NAME> ; but I ’ ll go with you and <NAME> ’ ly , if you ’ ll on ’ y let me , to the world ’ s end !
__label__1	If you are unable to make up your quantum , my boy , you had better address yourself to a principal ; there are plenty of principals in the profession , you know , and what is not worth the while of one , may be worth the while of another ; that 's my recommendation to you , speaking as a subordinate .
__label__1	‘ Twenty pounds per annewum , I believe , Mr Squeers ? ’ ‘ Guineas , ’ rejoined the schoolmaster , with a persuasive smile .
__label__1	It is falling still ; upon the roof , upon the skylight , even through the skylight , and drip , drip , drip , with the regularity of the <NAME> 's <NAME> , on the stone floor below .
__label__1	Some laughed ; some said , by way of complete excuse , that the post was virtually a sinecure , and any fool who could spell his name was good enough for it ; some , and these the more solemn political oracles , said that <NAME> did wisely to strengthen himself , and that the sole constitutional purpose of all places within the gift of <NAME> , was , that <NAME> _should_ strengthen himself .
__label__1	He thought of the picturesque alliance between those two , externally so very different .
__label__0	After draining it with much apparent relish , the professor got out of bed , walked into the common hall , round which he glanced with a pre-occupied air , and proceeded to seat himself in an armchair , the most comfortable which the cabin of the <NAME> had supplied .
__label__1	You are different from other children , <NAME> , because you were not born , like them , in common sinfulness and wrath .
__label__0	As for his own cabin , he had arranged it suitably for the presumed voyage , for he knew very well what was necessary for a polar expedition .
__label__1	'You have some papers , ' said <NAME> advancing , 'which were placed in your hands , for better security , by a man called <NAME> . '
__label__0	It takes particular care that the religious customs of the <NAME> should be respected , and if your servant were caught -- '' `` Very well , <NAME> , '' replied <NAME> ; `` if he had been caught he would have been condemned and punished , and then would have quietly returned to <NAME> .
__label__0	The engineer was right in thinking that the guns were of excellent make .
__label__1	Now whether the tall horse , in the natural playfulness of his disposition , was desirous of having a little innocent recreation with <NAME> , or whether it occurred to him that he could perform the journey as much to his own satisfaction without a rider as with one , are points upon which , of course , we can arrive at no definite and distinct conclusion .
__label__1	I pass my whole life , miss , in turning an immense pecuniary Mangle. ” After this odd description of his daily routine of employment , <NAME> flattened his flaxen wig upon his head with both hands ( which was most unnecessary , for nothing could be flatter than its shining surface was before ) , and resumed his former attitude .
__label__0	If ideas did not crowd on their brains , we must despair of the <NAME> of 1853 .
__label__1	‘ But you ’ re always bragging about something .
__label__1	I may drop into the <NAME> , and clear off that way .
__label__0	“ This is a matter that we can ’ t argue with him .
__label__1	I dare say the resemblance is not so exact , though , as that your informant became known to you through a letter from a correspondent with whom he had deposited money ?
__label__1	‘ So much the more is this whelp the only creature she has ever cared for , ’ thought <NAME> , turning it over and over .
__label__0	Then turning to the two reporters : “ Well , gentlemen , the time is come for us to separate. ” “ What , <NAME> , ” said <NAME> , “ shall you not stop even for an hour at <NAME> ? ” “ <NAME> , sir ; and I also wish to leave the post-house before the arrival of the berlin which we distanced. ” “ Are you afraid that the traveler will dispute the horses with you ? ” “ I particularly wish to avoid any difficulty. ” “ Then , <NAME> , ” said <NAME> , “ it only remains for us to thank you once more for the service you rendered us , and the pleasure we have had in traveling with you. ” “ It is possible that we shall meet you again in a few days at <NAME> , ” added <NAME> .
__label__0	`` Who does n't know all about him ? ''
__label__0	The <NAME> aborigines are gentle and inoffensive , never exhibiting the fierce hatred toward their conquerors which characterizes the <NAME> , and possibly a few of the races of <NAME> .
__label__1	Since laws were made for every degree , to curb vice in others as well as in me -- and so forth you know -- doesn ’ t it strike you in that light ? ’ The single gentleman smiled as if the light in which Mr <NAME> had put the question were not the clearest in the world , and proceeded to explain that they contemplated proceeding by stratagem in the first instance ; and that their design was to endeavour to extort a confession from the gentle <NAME> .
__label__0	The Muras are remarkably clever at sending through their blow-tubes arrows which cause incurable wounds , even at a range of three hundred paces .
__label__1	<NAME> ( unless it be the power of intellect or virtue ) has ever the greatest attraction for the lowest natures ; and the mere defiance of the unconscious house-front , with his power to strip the roof off the inhabiting family like the roof of a house of cards , was a treat which had a charm for <NAME> .
__label__0	These apparatuses were at <NAME> , where they had been used in the construction of a submarine breakwater ; and very fortunately it was so , for there was no time to construct any .
__label__0	Then their fears suddenly aroused , they disappeared , bounding over the rocks .
__label__1	In the pleasant little parlour opening on the garden , sat a gentleman , who rose to advance towards her when she came in , but turned off , by reason of some peculiarity in his legs , and was only stopped by the table .
__label__1	When I saw him going downstairs early in the morning ( for , thank <NAME> !
__label__1	Never a soul in it but my own self and <NAME> Jaggers. ” “ Was there no one else ? ” I asked .
__label__0	“ Poor , unfortunate man ! ” said <NAME> .
__label__0	In this latter case , instead of ignorant and savage natives , what would he have found ?

__label__1	During the time of my illness , we were still in <NAME> , where Mrs. <NAME> had come , on my guardian 's invitation , to stay with us .
__label__0	The <NAME> , taking <NAME> for its starting-point , extends eastward to meet the road from <NAME> .
__label__0	He had said , `` I am <NAME> . ''
__label__1	Give me a sign that you attend to me. ’ She slightly and constrainedly moves her hand .
__label__1	Have you no consideration for HIS property ? '
__label__0	The captain and his friends , followed at some distance by the eager Jew , soon left the glade and directed their steps towards the coast where the <NAME> was moored .
__label__1	In regard of the other <NAME> , the nondescript lodged in the same house with herself and uncle .
__label__1	`` 'Enter not into judgment with thy servant , <NAME> , for in thy sight -- ' '' Shall I ever forget the rapid beating at my heart , occasioned by the look I met as I stood up !
__label__0	The one which had been seized in the hall of <NAME> was a great fellow , six feet high , with an admirably poportioned frame , a broad chest , head of a moderate size , the facial angle reaching sixty-five degrees , round skull , projecting nose , skin covered with soft glossy hair , in short , a fine specimen of the anthropoids .
__label__0	So they struggled on all day , braving death at every instant , and making no progress northward , but also losing no ground ; they were wet through by the rain and waves ; above the din of the storm they could hear the hoarse cries of the birds .
__label__0	A reef sometimes extends for miles along the coast .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> and the Pacific the railway crosses a territory which is still infested by <NAME> and wild beasts , and a large tract which the <NAME> , after they were driven from <NAME> in 1845 , began to colonise .
__label__1	`` Is she married , my dear ? ''
__label__1	Mrs <NAME> circulated the news , as she received congratulations on it , with a careless grace that displayed it to advantage , as the setting displays the jewel .
__label__0	To all this deeply interesting information , though the fruit of observation the closest , aided and confirmed by calculation the profoundest , <NAME> listened with the utmost indifference .
__label__0	`` His food is sure , '' continued the poor man , who was beginning to be delirious ; `` he must be half famished , and I do n't see why we need keep him waiting any longer ! ''
__label__0	`` I 'm ready , <NAME> , '' answered <NAME> ; `` if it were necessary I could easily build a whole city with houses and streets out of these blocks of ice -- '' `` We sha ' n't need as much as that ; let us follow the example of the agents of the <NAME> 's <NAME> ; they build forts which protect them from the wild beasts and the <NAME> ; that is all we need ; let us make it no larger than necessary ; on one side the dwelling , on the other the stores , with a sort of curtain , and two bastions .
__label__1	‘ If you please , ma ’ am , ’ I began .
__label__0	At the same time , to long wars succeeds a peace , destined to endure throughout the reign of <NAME> , so that a great number of adventurers know not how to find indulgence for their love of violent emotions .
__label__1	He well remembered , too , that when he had placed his foot upon the coach-steps , he turned round and looked upon him with a face so ashy pale and so very wild and vacant that it made him shudder , and for the moment almost afraid to follow .
__label__1	‘ What do you mean , boy ? ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	The last telegram sent from the <NAME> ’ s cabinet , before the rupture of the wire , had ordered the governor , the garrison , the inhabitants , whoever they might be , to leave <NAME> , to carry with them any articles of value , or which might be of use to the <NAME> , and to take refuge at <NAME> .
__label__1	I have found my son -- my youngest , who went away for a soldier so long ago .
__label__0	This great mass seemed to hold itself in equilibrium .
__label__1	‘ Why , ’ replied <NAME> very slowly , ‘ I rather think one old gen ’ l ’ m ’ n was missin ’ ; I know his hat was found , but I ain ’ t quite certain whether his head was in it or not .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> ’ s manner towards Mrs Boffin at this time , was more the manner of a young man towards a mother , than that of a Secretary towards his employer ’ s wife .
__label__1	There , snuff and cigars , and <NAME> pipes and flutes , and violins and violoncellos , divide the supremacy between them .
__label__0	<NAME> , during the squalls , had taken his place on the platform .
__label__1	He was a quiet , plain , steady man ; made no attempt to escape ; and seemed a little depressed , but neither ashamed nor repentant .
__label__1	You 'll never have the laugh at me , though , unless it 's behind a nightcap .
__label__1	Nothing disagreeable should ever be looked at .
__label__0	This proceeding , as it turned out , might have cost him dear .
__label__1	<NAME> ’ s story having got abroad , raised him up a host of friends , and many offers of provision for his future life .
__label__1	As if it wasn ’ t meat and drink to you ! ’ At these latter words the girl shivered again , and for a moment paused in her rowing , seeming to turn deadly faint .
__label__1	There are a pair of scales , and it goes into one. ’ ‘ Throw it into mine then , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	It shall be a parlour-curtain lecture .
__label__1	But he may tell the truth , for his own purpose , and for this occasion only. ’ ‘ It doesn ’ t look like it. ’ ‘ HE doesn ’ t , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	But , in my own defence -- ’ ‘ Yes , ’ cried <NAME> , looking round the room with a prophetic smile , ‘ that ’ s what she ’ s going to say .
__label__1	My moral influence with them lads , ’ added <NAME> , with deeper gravity , ‘ is a tottering to its basis .
__label__0	They were compelled to believe so , and <NAME> could not help one day making this observation , -- `` If he does not speak it is because he has , I fear , things too serious to be told ! ''
__label__1	I awmust think it be the very star ! ’ They lifted him up , and he was overjoyed to find that they were about to take him in the direction whither the star seemed to him to lead .

__label__0	Many workmen , it is true , paid with their lives for the rashness inherent in these dangerous labors ; but these mishaps are impossible to be avoided , and they are classed among the details with which the <NAME> trouble themselves but little .
__label__1	How do you choose them ? ” “ I choose them as real men , of my name -- <NAME> is my name -- to whom the sight is likely to do good .
__label__1	‘ No , thank you , ’ said Mr Toots , ‘ it ’ s all quite right .
__label__0	`` Certainly not , '' said <NAME> ; `` but will you tell us now by what means they extract these pearls ? ''

__label__1	It is a black , dilapidated street , avoided by all decent people , where the crazy houses were seized upon , when their decay was far advanced , by some bold vagrants who after establishing their own possession took to letting them out in lodgings .
__label__1	‘ I shall take the usual licence , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , as he placed a chair for the bride .
__label__0	Nothing can be more life-like than his accounts of <NAME> customs , and the notices of their habits , their games , and their way of embalming the dead , in which the chemists of that period seem to have excelled .
__label__0	This route is generally preferred by steamers on their way to the <NAME> .

__label__0	<NAME> and <NAME> had , at the entrance made in the hull , discovered tackle , which would serve to hoist up the barrels and chests .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> pointed to it , and admonished him to take it up .
__label__1	‘ Now , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , pushing back her hair from her temples with both hands , ‘ what ’ s first ? ’ ‘ First , ’ returned <NAME> solemnly , ‘ if you persist in what I can not but regard as conduct utterly incompatible with the equipage in which you arrived -- ’ [ ‘ Which I do , Ma. ’ ) ‘ First , then , you put the fowls down to the fire. ’ ‘ To -- be -- sure ! ’ cried <NAME> ; ‘ and flour them , and twirl them round , and there they go ! ’ sending them spinning at a great rate .
__label__1	Overpowered with watching and exertion , I had closed my eyes for a few minutes , when I felt a violent clutch on my shoulder .
__label__1	If you are sure of that , on good consideration , send <NAME> to me this night week -- 'for the letter . '
__label__0	On the 25th of December , <NAME> Day , the country of <NAME> was discovered .
__label__1	“ I ’ ll help you , ” says I ; and off we set -- the wrong wa ’ !
__label__1	<NAME> ’ written thereon in pencil , was presently conducted by a Robber , with a very large belt and buckle round his waist , and very large leather gauntlets on his hands , into the presence of his former manager .
__label__0	It contained room enough for a bed , a table , an arm-chair , a chest of drawers , and , what was of still more consequence , for the indispensable telescope .
__label__1	Meanwhile Mrs. Cluppins , with the combined assistance of Mrs. <NAME> , Mrs. Sanders , <NAME> , and <NAME> , was hoisted into the witness- box ; and when she was safely perched on the top step , Mrs. <NAME> stood on the bottom one , with the pocket-handkerchief and pattens in one hand , and a glass bottle that might hold about a quarter of a pint of smelling-salts in the other , ready for any emergency .
__label__0	What <NAME> felt when he overheard this fragment of conversation may be understood when it is known that in this <NAME> he recognised one of his old <NAME> companions , a daring sailor , who had continued his criminal career .
__label__1	But , by degrees she was led on to confess that she would like to have for the inexhaustible baby such a nursery as never was seen .
__label__0	Should the settlers fall into their hands , they must expect no mercy !
__label__1	Once more she caught her arm , and covered her eyes with it ; and then was gone .
__label__0	But even <NAME> did not catch the words , for his voice was drowned in the frightful uproar made by the wolves , who had dashed off at a tremendous speed on the track of the horse .
__label__0	But though at least a hundred telescopes scanned the calm ocean breast for many miles in all directions , it was nowhere to be seen .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> short in the waist , ain ’ t it ? ’ said the stranger , screwing himself round to catch a glimpse in the glass of the waist buttons , which were half-way up his back .

__label__0	`` Therefore , my brave boys , '' continued <NAME> , with some excitement ; `` away with melancholy !
__label__1	You will go , wo n't you ? ''
__label__1	I put my hand upon her head , and touched her forehead , and said it was hot now but would be cool to-morrow .
__label__0	“ Just because <NAME> , who was by no means a timid man , was so afraid in 1802 , of the croaking of the <NAME> frogs , that he raised his anchor with all possible speed , and quitted the coast , never to return. ” “ What ! ” exclaimed <NAME> .
__label__0	They saw his eyes wander over all the marvels of this saloon , lighted by the electric rays which fell from the arabesques of the luminous ceiling .
__label__0	`` I am sure of it . ''
__label__1	‘ Men are not born able seamen .
__label__1	It is impossible ; it is a child ’ s tale .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , ’ the mother resumed , ‘ is self-willed and resolute ; and as these people naturally strain every nerve to catch him , I can entertain very little hope , Mr Clennam , that the thing will be broken off .
__label__1	‘ He is not being educated anywhere .
__label__0	<NAME> profited by these events to accuse the emperor of perfidy .
__label__0	All lived cheerlessly enough in the village , mixing little together , and if they did meet occasionally , it was only at such times as the bell of the mission called them to the dilapidated cottage which served them for a church .
__label__1	'Go to him , ' Biddy say , 'without loss of time . '
__label__0	But the dog continued to bark more furiously than ever .
__label__0	While we were all giving way to the delights of new-found pleasures , a little child appeared between two tufted olive trees .
__label__1	I told you from the first it was a toss-up .
__label__0	His first observation had given him the situation of <NAME> , -- In west longitude : from 150deg .
__label__0	There is wood in the forest , and eggs in nests ; we have only to find a house. ” “ Very well , ” returned <NAME> , “ I will look for a cave among the rocks , and I shall be sure to discover some hole into which we can creep. ” “ All right , ” said <NAME> ; “ go on , my boy. ” They both walked to the foot of the enormous wall over the beach , far from which the tide had now retreated ; but instead of going towards the north , they went southward .
__label__0	They crossed successively mountains and valleys , where often the pick-axe had to be used to clear a way over these still virgin lands ; at last the <NAME> arrived at <NAME> .
__label__0	It seemed as though no caravan had ever braved this desert expanse , or it would have left visible traces of its encampments , or the whitened bones of men and animals .
__label__0	This luncheon would sustain them until their supper , which they intended to take at <NAME> .
__label__1	Now it has been one of my duties of late to pay Flite a certain weekly allowance , deducting from it the amount of her weekly rent , which I have paid ( in consequence of instructions I have received ) to Krook himself , regularly in her presence .
__label__1	You put it away somewhere , and you kept your own counsel where .
__label__0	This was how it stood proof against the shock of the mighty billow .
__label__1	O , if you could know how faithful , you would almost pity me for being so far away and being so grand !
__label__1	They were a full half-hour in conference .
__label__1	The man stepped forward for a few paces , followed by the two friends and their legal adviser .
__label__0	For when they paved this church they could not lay the pavement over the place where our <NAME> 's feet had rested , as , when the stones were laid upon that spot , the earth , as though impatient of anything not divine resting upon it , threw them up again before the workmen .
__label__0	This king was then a child , and was called <NAME> , but he had changed his name at the death of his father <NAME> .
__label__1	He thought besides , ‘ This is a very odd beginning .
__label__0	Towards six o ’ clock , when the sun was disappearing behind the high lands of the west , <NAME> , who was walking up and down on the strand , signalized the return of <NAME> and <NAME> .
__label__1	I had recognized her with amazement , for <NAME> .
__label__0	His objection has its merits , I admit ; but I think we may successfully combat it , as well as all others which affect the habitability of other worlds .
__label__0	In fact , I should not be astonished if , in the eyes of our friends at <NAME> , it had resembled for a moment or two a red-hot meteor . ''
__label__1	It would be best to hide this coin , and never produce it unless their case was absolutely desperate , and no other resource was left them .
__label__1	<NAME> anybody any idea ? ’ ‘ Not roast man , I believe , ’ replied the voice of the second gentleman of the party of three .
__label__0	At the place where the magnetic meridians cross , the only phenomenon produced is the vertical position of the magnetic needle in two similar points of the terrestrial globe .
__label__0	There flows the <NAME> , a little affluent of the <NAME> , which passes near <NAME> before losing itself in one of the great northern arteries .
__label__1	At once to exhibit his deportment to the best models and to keep the best models constantly before himself , he had found it necessary to frequent all public places of fashionable and lounging resort , to be seen at <NAME> and elsewhere at fashionable times , and to lead an idle life in the very best clothes .
__label__0	Their tunics were close-fitting , and confined at the waist by a leathern belt braided with red .
__label__0	The capture of pigs , made on the islet , was looked upon as being very profitable to <NAME> , and the animals were led to the sty , where they soon became at home .
__label__1	So far as it was developed , it had been my happiness to form it .
__label__0	<NAME> wanted to find out from the <NAME> what he was doing in these high latitudes .
__label__1	Old Mr <NAME> was the first to stretch out his hand , and inquire how he felt .
__label__0	At the same time , historical geography was more studied ; it began to take for its foundation the study of inscriptions , and archæology was about to become one of the most useful instruments of comparative geography .
__label__1	At a place where she worked , answered <NAME> , blushing .
__label__1	Of my walking so proudly and lovingly down the aisle with my sweet wife upon my arm , through a mist of half-seen people , pulpits , monuments , pews , fonts , organs , and church windows , in which there flutter faint airs of association with my childish church at home , so long ago .
__label__0	`` I can feel the window with my hand ; but for all I can see , I might as well be over head and ears in a hogshead of ink . ''
__label__0	“ Indeed , ” remarked <NAME> , “ Wassili Fedor is a man of worth and courage .
__label__1	`` An extremely dangerous person in any community .
__label__0	That evening they halted early , unable to set one foot before the other , and , although their way was lighted by a brilliant aurora , they could not go on .
__label__1	Neither of the two observed that in the course of these walks , they attracted the attention of a working man who was standing near the engine , and who touched his hat every time they passed ; for Mr Dombey habitually looked over the vulgar herd , not at them ; and the Major was looking , at the time , into the core of one of his stories .
__label__0	The luminous spores of the cryptograms shone in the darkness with intensity .
__label__0	In him was recognized , not the indefatigable explorer who had braved so many dangers , but the infirm and deaf M. de Condamine , who always held his ear-trumpet in his hand .
__label__0	If , in spite of this , you are determined to go , you may try it ! ''
__label__0	Their teeth appeared to have been filed , and the cartilage of the nose pierced .
__label__0	<NAME> ’ t the name of the country strike you even in the mere mention of it ? ” “ <NAME> ! ” exclaimed <NAME> .
__label__1	Even then , it was only to ask : ‘ Where is your Lock ? ’ ‘ Twenty mile and odd -- call it five-and-twenty mile and odd , if you like -- up stream , ’ was the sullen reply .
__label__1	<NAME> had stopped , not for the first time by many times , to look about him and suffer what he saw to sink into his soul , as the shadows , looked at , seemed to sink deeper and deeper into the water .
__label__0	On that day the thermometer fell to three degrees below zero .
__label__1	And how dare you encourage him , you insolent minx ?
__label__0	The <NAME> was more fortunate , and returned to <NAME> , but she had not been able to get higher than the seventy-seventh parallel .
__label__0	The first sentiment which the colonists felt was that of profound sorrow .
__label__1	Little Oliver <NAME> lay on his back on the pavement , with his shirt unbuttoned , and his temples bathed with water ; his face a deadly white ; and a cold tremble convulsing his whole frame .
__label__1	Perhaps one of the highest uses of their ever having been there , was , that there might be left behind , that blessed air of tranquillity which pervaded <NAME> , and that serenely romantic state of the mind—productive for the most part of pity and forbearance—which is engendered by a sorrowful story that is all told , or a pathetic play that is played out .
__label__0	Two days afterwards we were to start from the <NAME> de la <NAME> .
__label__0	`` 'To start out with a piece of fresh bread in the pocket , and when one gets hungry to find it frozen hard enough to break one 's teeth .
__label__1	I am not impertinently curious , but have a good object .
__label__1	My deary , deary , deary , wife of <NAME> and mother of his little child !
__label__1	‘ Very good , ’ responded <NAME> , ‘ question anything you like when it ’ s your turn to speak , but don ’ t interrupt me. ’ ‘ I beg your pardon , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	To understand fully the sufferings of this race thus odiously persecuted , the touching and horrible narrative of <NAME> must be read , himself the indefatigable defender of the <NAME> .
__label__0	`` At least , '' replied <NAME> , `` no one can say that you speak like a horse ! ''
__label__1	I have a right to complain of it as almost a breach of confidence .
__label__0	But the most interesting portion of his narrative , now-a-days indeed quite obsolete and very incomplete since the country has been opened up to our scientific men , -- was for a long time that relating to <NAME> .
__label__0	But it was certain that the projectile would not fall directly on the moon ; for its lower part , by reason of its weight , ought to be turned toward her .
__label__1	As I passed the steps of the portico , I encountered , at the corner , a woman ’ s face .
__label__1	‘ There , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> ; ‘ and let me tell you , at the same time , to show you how much out of temper I was , that if I had gone away without another word , it would have made no difference respecting that pound or two which I shall leave among your children when I die. ’ ‘ Morleena <NAME> , ’ cried her mother , in a torrent of affection .
__label__0	“ To-day or never we shall see the Nile !
__label__1	But he has repressive power , and she has none .
__label__1	You must not return to us any more .
__label__1	It was then calm , radiant sunset .
__label__1	And yet , I was perverse enough to feel a chill and disappointment in receiving no welcome , and rattling , alone and silent , through the misty streets .
__label__0	As for his antagonists , they seemed much agitated ; not so much by the value of their stake , as because they had some scruples about betting under conditions so difficult to their friend .
__label__0	The presence of <NAME> on such an occasion would have been most valuable .
__label__1	If my daughter flies in my face , surely my husband may .
__label__0	<NAME> lying at the foot of an amphitheatre of hills , could be distinguished through the ship ’ s glasses , and soon the <NAME> cast anchor in the port .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> , ma ’ am ; Mrs. Cluppins , ma ’ am ; Mrs. Raddle , ma ’ am. ’ ‘ Which is Mrs. Cluppins ’ s sister , ’ suggested Mrs. Sanders .
__label__1	‘ Dear Fanny , what is the matter ?
__label__0	What time lost , what useless emotions !
__label__1	Nothing else that he knows on .
__label__0	Many of the former came on board , and showed so much confidence in their visitors as to remain all night , though the vessel was still in motion .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> has worked like a -- I doen ’ t know what <NAME> an ’ t worked like , ’ said <NAME> , looking at her , at a loss for a sufficiently approving simile .
__label__1	Theerfur ‘ tan ’ t my intentions to moor <NAME> ‘ long with them , but to find a <NAME> ’ fur her wheer she can fisherate for herself. ’ ( A <NAME> ’ signifies , in that dialect , a home , and to fisherate is to provide . )
__label__1	But it rusted and cankered at your father 's heart for years . '
__label__0	According to the signal-man , it was in a ruinous condition , several of the iron wires being broken ; and it was impossible to risk the passage .
__label__1	The morning is by this time getting on apace .
__label__1	Mr Dolls now struck out the highly unexpected discovery that he had been insulted by <NAME> , and stated his desire to ‘ have it out with him ’ on the spot , and defied him to come on , upon the liberal terms of a sovereign to a halfpenny .
__label__1	I would have spared you the degradation , but we must hear them from your own lips before we part , and you know why . '
__label__1	It was due to the uniform he wore , to demand this explanation .
__label__1	‘ And these are the arrangements , <NAME> dear ? ’ ‘ Arrangements ! ’ repeated <NAME> .
__label__1	It is but the death , it is all the same .
__label__0	But that mattered little , so long as the lower part grew thinner .
__label__1	look about you now , and make up for your negligence , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	A <NAME> before midday , the steamboat ’ s bell drew to the wharf on the Volga an unusually large concourse of people , for not only were those about to embark who had intended to go , but the many who were compelled to go contrary to their wishes .
__label__1	Did they fly with him on that sudden journey ? -- and until the procession moves , and <NAME> 's view is changed .
__label__0	But just as they were shoving off , an observation from <NAME> arrested them .
__label__0	Have the convicts appeared in the neighborhood ?
__label__0	`` That , my dear boy , is nothing , and you will easily get rid of that source of discomfort by bringing the exterior air in communication with the air contained in your lungs . ''
__label__0	Inside the palace or mosque are gold and silver houses , large enough to hold two or three persons at a time , if they wish to wash or bathe in them . ''
__label__0	The animals were in perfect health , and bravely bearing the fatigues of the voyage .
__label__1	‘ Your master is morally bound—and ought to be legally , under ruinous penalties—to provide for the comfort of his fellow-man. ’ The driver instituted , with the palms of his hands , a superficial perquisition into the state of his skeleton ; which seemed to make him anxious .
__label__0	Extensive repairs were absolutely necessary , and the making of them compelled <NAME> to remain at <NAME> until the 18th of September .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> me , <NAME> , ’ he proceeded , when their eyes met ; ‘ you have used some hard words , for which I do not doubt you have a justification in your mind , that I do not understand .
__label__0	Taking advantage of a change of wind the <NAME> sailed on to the <NAME> of <NAME> , and <NAME> was about to send an officer in advance to take soundings , when a canoe put off from the shore , having on board the governor of the island , <NAME> , otherwise <NAME> , [ 3 ] who promised the captain that he would find boats suitable for the taking of the necessary supplies to the corvette .
__label__1	‘ But the inner dressing-room was locked and the key gone. ’ Her father seized a candle that was flaming on the ground -- someone had put it down there , and forgotten it -- and came running upstairs with such fury , that <NAME> , in her fear , had hardly time to fly before him .
__label__1	I shall be ready in a quarter of an hour. ” In a quarter of an hour <NAME> was ready , and sat down alone to his sumptuous and choice supper .
__label__0	His experience on this coast D'Urville thus describes : -- '' One who has not had , as we have , a practical acquaintance with these seas , is unable to form any adequate conception of these incredible rains .
__label__1	They know what a clever madman I have been , and they are proud to have me here , to show .
__label__1	I write this to repeat most earnestly for myself all that she said to you and to let you know how sure I am that you will sooner or later find our cousin <NAME> a pattern of truth , sincerity , and goodness , when you will deeply , deeply grieve to have done him ( without intending it ) so much wrong .
__label__1	`` Man , '' said the <NAME> , `` if man you be in heart , not adamant , forbear that wicked cant until you have discovered What the surplus is , and Where it is .
__label__0	They slipped , they fell , they got up again .
__label__0	<NAME> nautical science was also necessary to achieve the discovery at the extremity of that long coast of the strait which so justly bears his name .
__label__1	<NAME> ! ’ prevented his relapse into a doze .
__label__1	When I got thy letter , I easily believen that what the yoong ledy sen and done to me , and what her brother sen and done to me , was one , and that there were a wicked plot betwixt ’ em .
__label__1	‘ Never ! ’ <NAME> confirmed the assertion with an oath , and then laughed again , when of course the boy ( who thought his companion one of the most dashing fellows alive ) laughed also .
__label__0	He was unwilling to leave her while they were still on dangerous ground .
__label__1	The talking-over stranger , Mr Venus. ’ ‘ Is that any one I know ? ’ inquires the staring Secretary .
__label__0	Rouse yourself , then , have courage and continue your route .
__label__1	It ’ s a satisfaction to know that she ’ ll wait for me any length of time , and that she really is the dearest girl -- ’ ‘ When are you to meet her at the coach ? ’ I ask .
__label__0	Even if we do not find the castaway , at least our voyage will not have been useless , and <NAME> will have rewarded us . ''
__label__0	The coast with its cocoanut and other trees , promised plentiful refreshments , but contrary winds and currents quickly drew the ships away .
__label__1	Do you remember one night when I came with <NAME> to your lodging in <NAME> ?
__label__1	What changes , <NAME> , even in my small world !
__label__0	The wind was still unfavorable .
__label__1	But do not hide from me ; do not steal away alone ; let me keep beside you .
__label__1	What is before you , is a fight with the world ; and the sooner you begin it , the better. ’ I think it occurred to me that I had already begun it , in my poor way : but it occurs to me now , whether or no .
__label__1	When you know that she only does it out of kindness and the best intentions !
__label__1	Permit me to say , <NAME> , that I highly admire your conduct , and extremely regret having caused you the inconvenience of this meeting , to no purpose. ’ ‘ I beg you won ’ t mention it , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	But the captain did not answer ; <NAME> 's barking alone was heard upon the mountain .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> ! ’ he returned , and burst into a roar of laughter that shook the chaise .
__label__1	You do not know of what service it might be .
__label__1	‘ I dare say my birds sing better than other birds , and my flowers smell better than other flowers .
__label__1	‘ A word. ’ I confronted <NAME> alone .
__label__1	I wrote her a long letter , in which I tried to make her comprehend how blest I was , and what a darling <NAME> was .
__label__1	Mr <NAME> was slinking about the hearthrug , waiting to welcome <NAME> .
__label__0	`` We have no luck , '' said <NAME> to the doctor ; `` to be sure , the country does n't offer much food to animals , but the game here ought not to be over-particular , and ought to show itself . ''
__label__1	This fellow is pigeon-hearted and light-headed .
__label__0	Soon a ruin , old and gloomy as the rocks at its base , rose before him .
__label__1	‘ He is such a devilish close chap , ’ said <NAME> , who had come up a little before , and now joined in the conversation .
__label__0	Here I am the representative of my country , and here , on neutral ground -- ” “ Neutral ground ? ” objected <NAME> ; “ I beg your pardon .
__label__0	We must get inside , and the bolts once drawn , we shall come to the surface of the water , without even the pilot , who is in the bows , perceiving our flight . ''
__label__1	How base would it be of me to take advantage of the circumstances which placed her here , or of the slight service I was happily able to render her , and to seek to engage her affections when the result must be , if I succeeded , that the brothers would be disappointed in their darling wish of establishing her as their own child , and that I must seem to hope to build my fortunes on their compassion for the young creature whom I had so meanly and unworthily entrapped : turning her very gratitude and warmth of heart to my own purpose and account , and trading in her misfortunes !
__label__1	‘ Over and over again. ’ ‘ Just like me !
__label__1	‘ Is it ? ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	The object of their long labours was attained !
__label__1	Seated at the same table , though with his chair modestly and uncomfortably drawn a little way from it , sits a bald , mild , shining man who coughs respectfully behind his hand when the lawyer bids him fill his glass .
__label__1	The opportunity that the day 's rest had given me for reflection had resulted in my fully determining to say nothing to him respecting <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Quite so , ’ assented his partner .
__label__0	I hesitated before giving it .
__label__1	At length he rises , throws open the door of a corner cupboard , and refers to a few uncouth chalked strokes on its inner side .
__label__0	replied <NAME> , checking the pulsations of her heart .
__label__0	He thought he had found “ the <NAME> Continent. ” “ But , ” said <NAME> to himself , “ what a seventeenth century sailor might call a ‘ continent ’ would never stand for one with a nineteenth century man .
__label__1	Having descended in safety from the wall , and not forgotten to devote a few moments to his own particular business in the same department , <NAME> then made the best of his way back to the <NAME> , where his prolonged absence had occasioned much speculation and some alarm .
__label__0	TEN minutes afterwards , <NAME> and <NAME> issued from the principal gallery .
__label__1	I have done a similar thing myself , in construction , often .
__label__0	None of the fugitives were visible .
__label__1	At sight of the dismayed look with which <NAME> regarded his tormentors , <NAME> , who was blessed with a lively sense of the ludicrous , fell into another ectasy , more boisterous than the first .
__label__1	Without stopping to inquire whether the intervening day appeared to <NAME> to consist of the usual number of hours of the ordinary length , it may be remarked that , to the parties more directly interested in the forthcoming ceremony , it passed with great rapidity , insomuch that when <NAME> awoke on the succeeding morning in the chamber of <NAME> , she declared that nothing should ever persuade her that that really was the day which was to behold a change in her condition .
__label__1	I wish your ladyship good day , and am much obliged to you all the same . ''
__label__0	The sailor trusted <NAME> as he would himself , and his confidence was justified by the coolness and judgment of the lad .
__label__1	Any amount of singular look for me , but not a double look !
__label__1	I felt as if I had been living in a palace of cards , which had tumbled down , leaving only <NAME> and me among the ruins ; I felt as if some grim enchanter had drawn a magic circle round the innocent goddess of my heart , which nothing indeed but those same strong pinions , capable of carrying so many people over so much , would enable me to enter !
__label__1	<NAME> is a sort of distant connexion of mine -- it doesn ’ t matter how ; I needn ’ t enter into that .
__label__1	When he loves his Florence most , he will hate me least .
__label__1	But my husband has his weaknesses , and he is so weak as to relent towards this Doctor. ” “ It is a great pity , ” croaked <NAME> , dubiously shaking his head , with his cruel fingers at his hungry mouth ; “ it is not quite like a good citizen ; it is a thing to regret. ” “ See you , ” said madame , “ I care nothing for this Doctor , I .
__label__1	Is that so much that he deserves this praise ? ''
__label__0	A brig and three or four schooners might have lain there with perfect ease .
__label__1	‘ So ! ’ said <NAME> , with a contemptuous laugh , ‘ I see her at last !
__label__0	He took back with him eighty men , with whom and with those who remained to them , they went as far as the country called <NAME> , a country moderately peopled and where they found abundance of provisions .
__label__0	The two young men , and <NAME> and <NAME> , thinking no more of danger , rushed out of the house , guns in hand .
__label__0	They determined to act the next night , and to kill these wretches , so as not to be killed by them .
__label__1	You know this lady ( for she _is_ a lady ) , Mrs. Sparsit ? ’ ‘ I have already had the honour— ’ ‘ Very well .
__label__1	The solitary child lived on , surrounded by this arabesque work of his musing fancy , and no one understood him .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> provided for his wants as best he could , but during the first few months he had great difficulty in conquering the sadness and mastering the horror consequent upon his terrible loneliness .
__label__1	‘ Confound these fellows ! ’ thought <NAME> ; ‘ they have come to breakfast , I suppose .
__label__1	As the time so passed , this slinking business became a more and more precarious one .
__label__1	She rose too , and he took leave with all humility .
__label__0	However , the <NAME> ’ s sleep did not last long ; for about ten o ’ clock he woke , sat up , and turned his ear toward the plain , listening intently , with half-closed eyes .
__label__1	‘ Not just yet ! ’ ‘ Oh very good indeed ! ’ cried <NAME> , recovering his spirits a little .
__label__0	In a picture representing the poulp in question . ''
__label__0	Fortunately , although the wind was strong , the sea , being sheltered by the land , did not run very high .
__label__1	Two minutes hence may be too late .
__label__1	He has been written to by <NAME> , on the subject of your lodgings , and he will receive you as a lodger. ’ ‘ My address , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ is <NAME> , <NAME> .
__label__0	A month had elapsed since the meeting in the rooms of the <NAME> , and a change had taken place in public opinion .
__label__0	“ At the least , my Lord .
__label__1	I ’ ll get some cushions out of the church , and you and your friend shall lie down before the fire .
__label__0	<NAME> watched him , while <NAME> nursed a growing headache with both hands .
__label__0	`` Yes , and the <NAME> must extend at least six hundred leagues from side to side .
__label__0	No doubt because he feared that his name would inspire horror .
__label__0	On the 12th October , they began to sleep in the house , although it was not completed .
__label__0	On the 24th March , the ships lost sight of each other in a dense fog a little above the western entrance to the Straits of <NAME> .
__label__0	It was evident that the unlucky chance which had brought him into the presence of his mother had betrayed his incognito .
__label__1	We wouldn ’ t mind then , when there comes stormy weather. -- -Not for our own sakes , I mean .
__label__0	<NAME> guessed what <NAME> wished to attempt .
__label__0	Here our travellers passed the night , not perhaps quite so comfortably as they would have done in their berths , but without suffering too much from the feeling of suffocation experienced by other explorers .
__label__1	'Just a leetle drop , with a little cold water , and a lump of sugar . '
__label__0	His father -- old <NAME> , dead ten years since -- inhabited the town of <NAME> , situated in the government of the same name ; and his mother , <NAME> , lived there still .
__label__1	Whom I so respect and honour -- whom I so devotedly love !
__label__1	Bother your misfortunes , '' cried Mrs. Bagnet , `` if they do n't make you more reasonable than that comes to .
__label__1	Mrs <NAME> took the opportunity of his being so engaged , to get a better observation of his face than she had yet taken .
__label__1	I must give you a kiss of congratulation , <NAME> ; but don ’ t touch my right shoulder , for there ’ s something running down it all day long .
__label__0	Next day a sudden wave broke the mizen-mast , just where there was a flaw in the sail , and submerged the vessels for a few moments .
__label__0	That day being <NAME> Day , <NAME> seemed to regret sorely the non-celebration of `` Christmas , '' the family fete of which Protestants are so fond .
__label__0	<NAME> , more experienced , did not think so , although he was not a man to trouble himself about a small or great grievance .
__label__0	The frightful heat caused the torture of thirst to reach the extreme limit of human endurance , and on the 1st of <NAME> , <NAME> died .
__label__0	<NAME> gave a full account of this catastrophe to the demoralized sailors .
__label__1	<NAME> Leicester snorts a little to hear the law laid down in this way , but in his honour and his love of truth , he freely , though silently , admits the justice of the ironmaster 's proposition .
__label__0	<NAME> struggled with his father .
__label__1	As to <NAME> , she had become the victim of an insatiate mania for what she called ‘ going into society ; ’ and would have gone into it head-foremost fifty times between sunset and sunrise , if so many opportunities had been at her disposal .
__label__0	On the left , the country appeared to be one vast extent of sandy downs , bristling with thistles .
__label__1	At the moment , the bell rang loudly in the hall .
__label__1	Some say she really is , or was , a party to a suit , but no one knows for certain because no one cares .
__label__1	My aunt ’ s old disappointment is set right , now .
__label__0	`` With a piece of ice which we shall cut out . ''
__label__1	‘ No less a person , I assure you , ’ said the <NAME> of the <NAME> .
__label__0	They galloped off in the direction of the <NAME> , and were not long in discovering that the diminution in the pressure of the atmosphere had precisely the same effect upon their horses as it had had upon themselves .
__label__0	The Tartars who now threatened the <NAME> , belonged to the <NAME> race , and occupied <NAME> .
__label__0	This journey from the camp to <NAME> , performed under the lashes and spear-points of the soldiers , proved fatal to many , and terrible to all .
__label__0	Whilst he was returning to <NAME> Alvarès Cabral might have encountered a fleet of four caravels under the command of <NAME> da Nova , which King <NAME> had despatched to give fresh vigour to the commercial relations which <NAME> had been charged to establish in the Indies .
__label__1	<NAME> opened the long low window , and looked out upon the old blasted and blackened forest of chimneys , and the old red glare in the sky , which had seemed to him once upon a time but a nightly reflection of the fiery environment that was presented to his childish fancy in all directions , let it look where it would .
__label__0	Hence he resolved not to let the two adversaries discuss the subject ; but he did not always succeed .
__label__1	They were all occupied with the poor girl , and I heard <NAME> directing them and speaking to her often .
__label__0	<NAME> furnishes some details respecting the women of <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> , I beg your pardon , sir !
__label__1	‘ Not his merit that he don ’ t cheat me , ’ was Mr Fledgeby ’ s commentary delivered with a wink , ‘ but my precaution. ’ He then with a lazy grandeur asserted his rights as lord of <NAME> and Co. by poking his cane at the stools and boxes , and spitting in the fireplace , and so loitered royally to the window and looked out into the narrow street , with his small eyes just peering over the top of <NAME> and Co. ’ s blind .
__label__0	There remained for consideration merely the question of powders .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> declared that she seemed to him to be an uncommonly interesting kind of ghost .
__label__1	for shame ! ’ <NAME> brightened up and smiled .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> blushed like a child when his turn came , and his voice trembled as he spoke to <NAME> ’ s father .
__label__1	He took off his hat as <NAME> saluted him , and seemed much humbled and abashed at the sight of <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> had not passed through the many incidents by which his life had been checkered without acquiring some slight knowledge of medicine .
__label__0	Lying low , it was scarcely visible above the water , and had the sun not shone out , the <NAME> would have been lost upon it .
__label__1	I know your tricks and your manners , my friend ! ’ ‘ <NAME> ’ s sister , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ is not come home yet ? ’ ‘ You are quite a conjuror , ’ returned <NAME> .
__label__1	The vessel in which we returned from <NAME> to <NAME> was crowded with them , and at night they spread their beds between decks ( those who had beds , at least ) , and slept so close and thick about our cabin door , that the passage to and fro was quite blocked up .
__label__0	With a sentiment of respect , which almost amounts to veneration , the sloop in which M. <NAME> made the discovery of the strait which separates <NAME> from <NAME> is preserved .
__label__0	What vessel could resist the shock of his submarine monitor ?
__label__1	I knowed old <NAME> , sir .
__label__1	If you suppose that boy -- ’ ‘ Who really will be tired of waiting , ’ said <NAME> , politely .
__label__1	‘ My dear , ’ he continued , ‘ this is an occasion -- ha -- teeming with a good example .
__label__1	‘ The proposal is like yourself , and if the position I shall assume at the <NAME> is one that I could occupy without descending lower in the social scale— ’ ‘ Why , of course it is , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	It can , therefore , be well understood how injurious this seclusion in the corral must have been to the colonists .
__label__0	“ The wife of <NAME> , of <NAME> , that put an announcement in the <NAME> about the shipwreck of the <NAME> ? ” “ Yes , yes , ” said <NAME> , eagerly ; “ and you ? ” “ I am <NAME> , ma ’ am , and this is my brother. ” “ Miss Grant , <NAME> ! ” exclaimed <NAME> , drawing the young girl toward her , and taking both her hands and kissing the boy ’ s rosy cheeks .
__label__0	It is divided into several governments or provinces , those of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> ; contains two districts , <NAME> and <NAME> ; and possesses two countries , now under the <NAME> dominion -- that of the <NAME> and that of the <NAME> .
__label__0	About this time , the weather being extremely dry , the colonists , clothed as warmly as possible , resolved to devote a day to the exploration of that part of the island between the <NAME> and <NAME> .
__label__1	You are the ruin of me. ’ She started at the passionate sound of the last words , and at the passionate action of his hands , with which they were accompanied .

__label__0	<NAME> , intoxicated with joy , went forward to take possession of the clock , when a frightful roar of laughter resounded behind him .
__label__0	President <NAME> reached his house , bruised , crushed , and squeezed almost to a mummy .
__label__0	`` I have an idea , my dear boy ; it is none other than this simple fact ; we shall not come out by the same opening as that by which we entered . ''
__label__0	And this was what might have been expected of these folks from the different points of view , though time passed pleasantly enough with them all the same .
__label__0	<NAME> remained in <NAME> with <NAME> and <NAME> , while <NAME> , accompanied by <NAME> , proceeded to judge for himself of the extent of the disaster .
__label__0	`` What is it , then , <NAME> ? ''
__label__1	‘ Not to deceive you , sir , I notice it , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ and I take it kind of you. ’ He was at a loss to understand what she meant ; and by expressing as much in his looks , elicited her explanation .
__label__1	`` You will excuse me , <NAME> , '' observes <NAME> .
__label__0	The course was then given north-northeast , and the corvette , wearing , steered at full steam direct for <NAME> .
__label__1	Her father thought so as he looked at her .
__label__0	`` But was it not a star ? ''
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> gave orders for the lowering of the ship 's largest boat , in a voice which betrayed his impatience .
__label__1	On these national occasions dancing may be a patriotic service , and <NAME> is constantly seen hopping about for the good of an ungrateful and unpensioning country .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , ’ returns <NAME> , with his wristbands bristling a little , ‘ <NAME> repeat the word ; I repeat the word .
__label__0	The jangada then glided along the black waters of the <NAME> , as they mingled with the white stream of the <NAME> .
__label__0	You see , then , my friends , that the country over which we are now passing has witnessed some noble instances of self-sacrifice which , unfortunately , have only too often had death for their reward. ” The <NAME> in the <NAME> of the Niger. -- A Fantastic View of the <NAME> Mountains. -- Kabra. -- Timbuctoo. -- The Chart of Dr .
__label__0	“ <NAME> , <NAME> of <NAME> , “ RODAMEL , <NAME> , Here ended the astonishing journey of Dr. <NAME> and his brave companions , as vouched for by undeniable testimony ; and they found themselves among friends in the midst of most hospitable tribes , whose relations with the <NAME> settlements are frequent and amicable .
__label__0	This mount , situated in 9 @ north latitude and 20 @ east longitude , rose to a height of 10,600 feet above the surface of the moon .
__label__0	The entire glory of this discovery , foreseen though it was by scientific men , belongs to the <NAME> .
__label__0	In <NAME> the <NAME> , in <NAME> the <NAME> , and in <NAME> the <NAME> established counting-houses and offices , whilst missionaries endeavoured to win over to the <NAME> faith and modern ideas the unchangeable `` Empire of the <NAME> . ''
__label__1	roguery ! ’ With these reflections , and a very hard knock on the crown of his unfortunate hat at each repetition of the last word , <NAME> , whose brain was a little muddled by so much of the contents of the pocket-pistol as had found their way there during his recent concealment , went forth to seek such consolation as might be derivable from the beef and greens of some cheap eating-house .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> gave his arm to <NAME> , and <NAME> walked , detached , in front .
__label__1	I would have a settlement out of somebody , by fair means or by foul .
__label__1	‘ To carry out an idea , ’ repeated <NAME> ; ‘ and that ’ s the great convenience of living in a thoroughfare like the <NAME> .
__label__1	I should have continued to avoid you , in pursuance of the same set purpose , for a short time longer , if we had not met now .
__label__1	And of course he 's going .
__label__0	`` Cut away , boatswain , cut away ! ''
__label__0	I noticed in this part several small mounds of ice in such a liquefying condition that the slightest touch would suffice to break it and convert the mound into a round slough .
__label__0	Have you fixed the day ? ” “ I shall be at home every day to my friends , ” replied <NAME> ; “ and you are -- ” “ The most devoted among them all , ” interrupted <NAME> , gaily .
__label__0	As males and females were indiscriminately slaughtered , however , the new fields were soon exhausted .
__label__0	`` Since it is so , '' he said , `` we shall follow you . ''
__label__1	First he thought of his friends , and wondered when they would join him ; then his mind reverted to Mrs. <NAME> ; and from that lady it wandered , by a natural process , to the dingy counting-house of <NAME> & <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ I ought to know this writing .
__label__1	‘ Had I ? ’ said the man again .
__label__0	It might be , indeed , that their only intention was to obtain fresh water from the <NAME> , and it was not impossible that the bridge , thrown across a mile and a half from the mouth , and the manufactory at the <NAME> might escape their notice .
__label__1	It is the fate of a lonely old man , that those about him should form new and different attachments and leave him .
__label__1	‘ Get me a coach. ’ ‘ A coach !
__label__0	The idea of the only simpleton in the lot having to lecture the others on propriety of deportment !
__label__1	So Mr <NAME> bought a gift of each sort , and paid handsomely for it .
__label__1	Then a horse was found ; and she got another man to ride for life or death to the railroad , and send a message to <NAME> , which she wrote and gave him .
__label__0	A clever sailor , <NAME> , of whom <NAME> says , `` that never did any one better understand the seafaring profession , that his courage was equal to any emergency , and that his application was indefatigable , '' concluded an agreement with a company of merchants to search for the passage by the north-west .
__label__1	Oh , what shall I do , what shall I do !
__label__0	`` Well now , '' murmured the president `` why did we not hear the detonation ? ''
__label__0	Yes , sir ! ” replied <NAME> quickly .
__label__1	<NAME> , they know me at the stage-door I suppose .
__label__0	He thought his master gone beyond all prospect of return .
__label__1	<NAME> , though we are stranger to each other than we have been , that I am unchanged to you within .
__label__0	They felt her lifted up , and for an instant she hung in the air , then she leaned over and fell back on the ice , and then she rolled so heavily that her planks cracked .
__label__0	It was impossible for <NAME> and <NAME> , with these impediments , to make rapid progress .
__label__1	A seal or two , a pencil-case , a pair of sleeve-buttons , and a brooch of no great value , were all .
__label__0	He dived and went up successively .
__label__1	'You can say nothing to alter my resolution .
__label__0	<NAME> and <NAME> , kneeling , prayed a last time for the poor fellow , inoffensive and good , who had paid for his devotion towards them with his life .
__label__1	But , observing lately , that her accessible point did appear to be a very strong description of tenderness for the daughter of my friend <NAME> , it occurred to me that if I could bring about a meeting , unexpected on both sides , it might lead to beneficial results .
__label__1	When she spoke to him , he listened , and in due course answered , but never looked at her , that I could see .
__label__0	`` Ever since we have been at <NAME> , my mind has been almost solely occupied with the grave question which has been submitted to me by yourself -- for nothing would be unwiser and more inconsistent than to act with imprudence . ''
__label__1	‘ Put you back half-an-hour every morning , and about another quarter towards the arternoon , and you ’ re a watch as can be ekalled by few and excelled by none .
__label__0	<NAME> , always enthusiastic in his projects , already spoke of constructing a battery to command the channel and the mouth of the river .
__label__0	To him I knew this would be the last fatal stroke .
__label__0	So most people came to the conclusion that the villains had been finally dislodged from the mine , and that , as to <NAME> , they must suppose her to be dead at the bottom of the shaft where they had left her .
__label__1	‘ Bustle ! ’ said the old gentleman again , but the admonition was quite unnecessary , for one of the girls poured out the cherry brandy , and another brought in the towels , and one of the men suddenly seizing <NAME> by the leg , at imminent hazard of throwing him off his balance , brushed away at his boot till his corns were red-hot ; while the other shampooed <NAME> with a heavy clothes-brush , indulging , during the operation , in that hissing sound which hostlers are wont to produce when engaged in rubbing down a horse .
__label__1	‘ You have delivered the little parcel I gave you for your old landlord , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ I have , <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> .
__label__1	We all conceived a prepossession in his favour , for there was a sterling quality in this laugh , and in his vigorous , healthy voice , and in the roundness and fullness with which he uttered every word he spoke , and in the very fury of his superlatives , which seemed to go off like blank cannons and hurt nothing .
__label__0	On the second of the month , at two in the morning , our precious cargo of luggage was taken on board the good ship < i > <NAME> < /i > .
__label__0	With fin-backs and hump-backs , porpoises of colossal size appeared , and these Hearne harpooned cleverly when they came within range .
__label__1	Seized with an augmented terror of myself which turned me cold , I ran from myself and everything , retraced the way by which I had come , and never paused until I had gained the lodge-gate , and the park lay sullen and black behind me .
__label__1	But when these arrangements were completed and everything was in order , I paid a visit of a few hours to <NAME> , which something in the letter I had destroyed at <NAME> had induced me to decide upon in my own mind .
__label__0	“ How can we possibly find traces of the captives in the heart of so vast a continent ? ” No one replied , though <NAME> ’ s questioning glances at her companions seemed to press for an answer .
__label__0	A comet simply came too close and left its mark as it flew past . ''
__label__1	“ <NAME> , ” I interrupted , pettishly , “ how can you call me , sir ? ” <NAME> looked at me for a single instant with something faintly like reproach .
__label__0	<NAME> , swelling in his heart , like mercury in the thermometer , had attained the height of transcendent folly .
__label__0	The appearance of the town was already semi-European , stone houses replaced the primitive native huts , regular streets with shops , café , public-houses , much patronized by the sailors of whalers and fur-traders , together with a fortress provided with cannon , were the most noteworthy signs of the rapid transformation of the manners and customs of the natives .
__label__1	I thought she would have come round again before this , but she hasn ’ t been here. ’ ‘ About <NAME> -- ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	From time to time <NAME> said , “ Speak to me , Nadia. ” “ Why should I , <NAME> ?
__label__1	And now , while he was composed , and hoped that he could meet the end with quiet heroism , a new action began in his waking thoughts , which was very difficult to master .
__label__0	<NAME> with terror , the natives hastened to appease their terrible visitors by offering them all they possessed .
__label__1	Sometimes she wondered , with a swelling heart and rising tear , whether she was proficient enough in anything to surprise him when they should become companions .
__label__1	They have never given ME any vexation ; quite the contrary .
__label__1	When <NAME> and the unfortunate Prince found an opportunity to become betrothed I do n't know , but they certainly found none on this occasion to exchange a dozen words .
__label__1	‘ I hope that ’ s <NAME> ! ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	Its breath is pure and healthy .
__label__0	The crossing would have been made without great difficulty , even on this imperfect apparatus , had the current been regular ; but , unfortunately , there were whirlpools in numbers , and soon the kibitka , notwithstanding all <NAME> ’ s efforts , was irresistibly drawn into one of these .
__label__1	But , <NAME> , if your object is to find her , and to have her here , myself and the <NAME> will produce her with every dispatch that devotion on my part , and great intelligence on the <NAME> ’ s , can ensure. ’ Mr <NAME> was so manifestly delighted and revived by the prospect of being useful , and the disinterested sincerity of his devotion was so unquestionable , that it would have been cruel to refuse him .
__label__1	If there ’ s a bad thing to be done , can it ever be Patroned and Patronessed right ?
__label__1	He spoke <NAME> perfectly well , though he had not begun to learn the language , he told me , until he was a young man grown .
__label__1	In about ten minutes ' time , <NAME> was seized with a fit of coughing ; upon which <NAME> pulled her shawl over her shoulders , and declared it was time to go .
__label__0	“ Is it not impossible , ” he murmured aloud , “ that any city should disappear so completely ?
__label__1	It is certain that Mr Toots , by some remote and roundabout road , had got to that point , and that there he made a stand .
__label__1	The river is dammed at this point , and forced by its own power into certain high tanks or reservoirs , whence the whole city , to the top stories of the houses , is supplied at a very trifling expense .
__label__1	She does her duty. ’ <NAME> fancied that he heard in these praises a certain tone of custom , which he had heard from the father last night with an inward protest and feeling of antagonism .
__label__1	There are no words which can express , nothing with which can be compared , the perfect pallor , the clear transparent whiteness , of the beautiful face which turned towards him when he entered .
__label__0	Of the sailors who manned it , three were killed without provocation by the natives , while the others escaped by swimming , and were picked up by the ships ' boats , but by the time they were in readiness to fire upon the assailants , these had disappeared .
__label__1	So was <NAME> , for he was seldom otherwise .
__label__0	We were two hours getting to the summit of this peak , which was half porphyry and half basalt .
__label__1	You are one of us , as I may say. ” I accepted the offer .
__label__0	The next day or two were spent in providing for the accommodation of the new comer .
__label__1	I did so , that I might endeavour to render you and your family some service .
__label__0	I believe I shall end by thinking , like <NAME> , that the evil demon of the mine revenges himself on us for having invaded his domain. ” <NAME> was allowed to hear as little as possible of these discussions .
__label__0	The Persians were succeeded by another party of dancers , whom <NAME> recognized .
__label__1	The screen still goes , as before .
__label__1	‘ Eh ! ’ said <NAME> , with a look of virtuous surprise .
__label__1	Pack up your things directly !
__label__0	`` But there is a chance of success , '' answered the captain , `` and we must try it .
__label__1	I knew this to be a weakness which must be overcome , but I had always said to myself that I would begin afresh when I got to where I now was .
__label__1	But she hardly ever spoke -- I question if she ever did -- without making some mention of him .
__label__1	Lastly , as he had not yet been seen by the laundress or her niece , he was to keep himself out of their view until his change of dress was made .
__label__1	A nephew whom they had brought up was a frequent visitor at the house , among many other visitors ; and he began to pay me attention .
__label__0	At this moment the reporter appeared round a rock , and <NAME> , thinking that he had not seen the jaguar , was about to rush towards him , when <NAME> signed to him to remain where he was .
__label__0	It is quite motionless and presents the appearance of sleep .
__label__0	`` I am sorry , '' said the conductor ; `` but we shall be off at once .
__label__0	It is very like a cigar in shape , a shape already adopted in <NAME> in several constructions of the same sort .
__label__1	That he had the bottle somewhere about him could not be doubted ; where , was not so clear .
__label__1	At length he was quiet -- well he might be with her dimpled chin upon his head ! -- and we walked away to look at a greenhouse .
__label__0	`` It is true , '' answered <NAME> , `` but a few months of that strange life have sufficed to make you known -- '' `` As a great criminal , doubtless ! ''
__label__1	My sister went for the stone bottle , came back with the stone bottle , and poured his brandy out : no one else taking any .
__label__0	“ Are you <NAME> ? ” he asked .
__label__1	‘ “ What do you think of _that_ ? ” said the goblin , turning his large face towards <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ I am sure of it -- will be a great assistance and support to her .
__label__0	And besides there was the ironwood ; and more particularly the _ “ ibiriratea , ” _ nearly black in its skin , and so close grained that of it the Indians make their battle-axes ; _ “ jacarandas , ” _ more precious than mahogany ; _ “ cæsalpinas , ” _ only now found in the depths of the old forests which have escaped the woodman ’ s ax ; _ “ sapucaias , ” _ one hundred and fifty feet high , buttressed by natural arches , which , starting from three yards from their base , rejoin the tree some thirty feet up the stem , twining themselves round the trunk like the filatures of a twisted column , whose head expands in a bouquet of vegetable fireworks made up of the yellow , purple , and snowy white of the parasitic plants .
__label__1	I stopped where I was , among the leaves , and listened .
__label__1	There 's father coming , '' cried the two young Cratchits , who were everywhere at once .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> ’ t cry , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , in a transport of enthusiasm .
__label__1	‘ What do you think of the other ? ’ said I .
__label__1	‘ Now , mark this chap ’ s making <NAME> stand for <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> ! ’ ‘ My feeling for <NAME> , ’ pursued the Secretary , without deigning to notice him , ‘ is not one to be ashamed of .
__label__1	Then <NAME> would appear , and the man would retire .
__label__1	R. <NAME> locked up his desk one evening , and , putting his bunch of keys in his pocket much as if it were his peg-top , made for home .
__label__1	It was a weight to bear alone ; still my present duty appeared to be plain , and blest in the attachment of my dear , I did not want an impulse and encouragement to do it .
__label__1	But , in this separation , I associate you only with the good ; and I will faithfully hold you to that always , for you must have done me far more good than harm , let me feel now what sharp distress I may .
__label__0	As <NAME> had done , <NAME> and <NAME> passed without perceiving them amongst the principal <NAME> archipelagos , and cast anchor on the 10th April , at the <NAME> of <NAME> , where it was only possible to procure a little fresh water and some herbs .
__label__1	The eldest Miss <NAME> is not a little girl .
__label__0	What happened to Joe. -- The <NAME> of the Biddiomahs. -- The <NAME> shown him. -- The <NAME> that sank. -- The <NAME> of the Lake. -- The <NAME> of the Serpents. -- The Foot-Tramp. -- <NAME> Suffering. -- Mosquitoes and Ants. -- Hunger. -- The <NAME> seen. -- She disappears. -- The Swamp. -- One Last Despairing Cry .
__label__1	But permit me to set you right on one point .
__label__1	`` First , '' said my guardian , `` can we do anything for your personal comfort , <NAME> ? ''
__label__0	The dogs were harnessed to the sledge ; since they were well fed and had thoroughly rested , after a comfortable winter there was no reason for their not being of great service during the summer .
__label__1	If you are poor , let us be poor together ; but let me be with you , do let me be with you ; do not let me see such change and not know why , or I shall break my heart and die .
__label__0	The only incidents which imparted a slight animation , were the sudden and unexpected differences in the depth of the sea , caused by the line of breakers which it was necessary to avoid .
__label__1	As she neared it , she turned , and withdrew her eyes from my face .
__label__1	‘ If I chose to beg , sir , and stoop to ask assistance from people I despise , three or four months would not be a long time ; three or four years would not be a long time .
__label__1	If you want to cram for anything , I should be troubled to recommend you to a better adviser than <NAME> Bounderby. ’ To a more agreeable adviser , or one from whom he would be more likely to learn , <NAME> could never be recommended .
__label__0	The cold may be resisted by one who succumbs to dampness ; hence it was necessary to guard against it .
__label__1	Oh , dem , dem , dem ! ’ The woman looked , first at <NAME> , and then at <NAME> , as if uncertain on whom to visit this extraordinary behaviour ; but Mr Mantalini happening by ill-luck to thrust his nose from under the bedclothes , in his anxiety to ascertain whether the visitors were gone , she suddenly , and with a dexterity which could only have been acquired by long practice , flung a pretty heavy clothes-basket at him , with so good an aim that he kicked more violently than before , though without venturing to make any effort to disengage his head , which was quite extinguished .
__label__1	how much brighter and more deeply blue , glowing and rich though it had been before , was the scene without , contrasting with the darkness of so many youthful lives within !
__label__0	Our lamps threw over this place a sort of clear twilight that singularly elongated the shadows on the ground .
__label__1	He had left her in her father ’ s room within an hour .
__label__0	'Make haste and take him to the market ! '
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> , ‘ horrible. ’ A low tap was heard at the room door .
__label__1	said <NAME> , folding his hands .
__label__1	Remembering , however , that in the <NAME> debates , whether on the life of that nation ’ s body or the life of its soul , the question was usually all about and between <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> and <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , or <NAME> or Stiltstalking , and nobody else ; he said nothing on the part of mob , bethinking himself that mob was used to it .
__label__1	He is not polite. ’ ‘ Sir , ’ said <NAME> , striking in expeditiously , ‘ whoever you are , and however you come to be here , if I were the master of this house I would lose no time in placing you on the outside of it. ’ ‘ But you are not , ’ said his mother , without looking at him .
__label__0	The course was taken towards the north-west , and the next day the screw of the frigate was at last beating the waters of the <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> with it !
__label__1	And then they fell to shaking hands most heartily again .
__label__1	`` No , '' returns his friend ; `` if it 's nothing worse than this , I withdraw the observation . ''
__label__0	Smaller than the latter , it is more wooded , better watered , and possessed more goats .
__label__1	'Not one little peep , miss ? '
__label__0	Then settling himself firmly , he listened .
__label__0	The <NAME> type is strongly marked and distinct .
__label__1	And here it may be observed , that <NAME> was not , in the ordinary sense of the word , a young man of high spirit .
__label__1	Some time elapses in the present instance before the old gentleman is sufficiently cool to resume his discourse , and even then he mixes it up with several edifying expletives addressed to the unconscious partner of his bosom , who holds communication with nothing on earth but the trivets .
__label__0	`` A man who has somewhere written his name with this very dagger -- a man who has endeavored once more to indicate the right road to the interior of the earth .
__label__0	A circumstance especially favorable to the success of his plan was , that he was thoroughly acquainted with the country which he was about to traverse , and understood its different dialects -- not only from having traveled there before , but because he was of <NAME> origin .
__label__1	He hears that his innocence is established , and that he is pardoned .
__label__0	For two years he lived at <NAME> incognito .
__label__0	He came to the conclusion that there must be an open sea beyond , and he founded this opinion on the immense quantity of warm water which flows into the <NAME> from the great rivers of <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Looking in at the garden gate of the cottage. ’ ‘ No , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	`` Well , '' he proceeds , throwing off his disappointment , `` next and last , those plans of mine .
__label__0	How they must have been startled by the wild cheers that suddenly rang around their ocean-prison !
__label__1	And if they forgot me , I should never know it , ’ replied <NAME> .
__label__1	I tried to wean her fra ’ t ower and ower agen .
__label__0	`` That 's a generous supply , '' said the carpenter .
__label__1	I can not deny that I shed tears .
__label__0	A week ago I went to ascertain the depth of this shaft .
__label__0	That this was the case appeared undoubted a few days after the return of <NAME> and <NAME> to the <NAME> .
__label__0	No coverings , no hammocks , no clothing , were found ; evidently the fire had destroyed all .
__label__0	`` Yes and no ; for the Governor has promised to help me . ''
__label__1	The dolls ’ dressmaker sat in her corner behind the door , with her eyes on the ground and her hands folded on her basket , holding her crutch-stick between them , and appearing to take no heed of anything .
__label__1	<NAME> , for <NAME> ’ s sake , explain it ! ’ <NAME> , who had only waited for a hearing , at once recounted how he had been placed in his then distressing predicament ; how the fear of giving rise to domestic dissensions had alone prompted him to avoid <NAME> on his entrance ; how he merely meant to depart by another door , but , finding it locked , had been compelled to stay against his will .
__label__1	If <NAME> were beyond measure perplexed by this curious conduct on the part of her new acquaintance , and by finding herself involved in this singular treaty , her perplexity was not diminished by ensuing circumstances .
__label__0	<NAME> must therefore have provided some place for the escape of the overplus .
__label__1	Then you ’ ll memorialise that Department ( according to regular forms which you ’ ll find out ) for leave to memorialise this Department .
__label__1	‘ You want some one ? ’ said the lady in a stern manner .
__label__1	`` My prudent <NAME> , why not ? ''
__label__1	I saw him stand uncovered in the bitter air , with a reverence for something .
__label__1	‘ Oh yes , I know you very well ; too well , perhaps , and perhaps he does too , and sorry am I that I should have to say it. ’ ‘ Tell him that I saw him through the window-blind above , as I crossed the road just now , and that I would speak to him on business , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	It don ’ t signify to any one. ’ ‘ O yes it does ; I am sorry to see you so. ’ ‘ You are not sorry , ’ said the girl .
__label__1	‘ I must take the consequences of what I have done , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	But when they set the bier down on the threshold , they looked at one another , and at me , and whispered .
__label__1	‘ I beg your pardon ! ’ As he bent his head to Mr Dombey , with an air of deference that accorded ill with his words , though they were humbly spoken , he moved it round towards her , and kept his watching eyes that way .
__label__1	‘ It may be my long absence and inexperience that lead me to the conclusion ; but if plain speakers are scarce in this part of the world , I fancy plain dealers are still scarcer .
__label__0	One day <NAME> half jestingly proposed to him an exploration of the sources of the Nile .
__label__0	After an endless palaver , <NAME> declared that according to the laws and customs of the country he had a right to look upon the <NAME> and their people as his property , but that , not wishing to abuse his privileges , he would set them free in exchange for the value of twenty slaves in <NAME> merchandise .
__label__1	Once—once—I found myself on deck .
__label__1	And why have you done it ?
__label__1	<NAME> and I both laughed , but not so loud .
__label__1	‘ That night I almost gave up my mystery , though I suspected no one , could offer no information , knew absolutely nothing save that the murdered man was not I , but <NAME> .
__label__0	`` Take a lamp , <NAME> , '' answered the engineer ; `` we will start at once . ''
__label__1	The lanterns glimmered , as the men ran to and fro ; the horses ’ hoofs clattered on the uneven paving of the yard ; the chaise rumbled as it was drawn out of the coach-house ; and all was noise and bustle .
__label__1	'Do you live in <NAME> ? '
__label__1	We knew the distinguishing marks of each vessel .
__label__0	They could hear the tempest raging in <NAME> , which would surely suffer from it .
__label__1	A dozen times did he softly turn the handle of some bedroom door which resembled his own , when a gruff cry from within of ‘ Who the devil ’ s that ? ’ or ‘ What do you want here ? ’ caused him to steal away , on tiptoe , with a perfectly marvellous celerity .
__label__0	political exiles returning from <NAME> , from <NAME> , from <NAME> !
__label__0	But an instant after his head was raised , and his expression was that of a man resolved to do his duty to the last .
__label__1	When I got nigh the place as I had been told of , I began to think within my own self , “ What shall I do when I see her ? ” ’ The listening face , insensible to the inclement night , still drooped at the door , and the hands begged me -- prayed me -- not to cast it forth .
__label__1	'What is the name to me ? '
__label__0	`` Accept this cigar , M. Aronnax ; and , though it does not come from <NAME> , you will be pleased with it , if you are a connoisseur . ''
__label__0	Although his character was independent enough , he was always loyal to the requirements of <NAME> , which is law among the Polytechnicians in all that concerns comradeship and respect for the uniform .
__label__1	It was an oblong pile of barrack building , partitioned into squalid houses standing back to back , so that there were no back rooms ; environed by a narrow paved yard , hemmed in by high walls duly spiked at top .
__label__1	‘ I thought his cowardice and servility were the best guarantee for his keeping silence .
__label__0	A moderate breeze , which passes over twenty-four feet to the second , will give sixteen turns to the sails during a minute , and there is no need of more. ” “ Exactly ! ” cried <NAME> , “ a fine breeze is blowing from the northeast , which will soon do our business for us. ” There was no reason for delaying the inauguration of the mill , for the settlers were eager to taste the first piece of bread in <NAME> .
__label__1	I wish all this were over. ’ ‘ Over , <NAME> ! ’ repeated a female voice behind him , in a kind of plaintive surprise .
__label__1	<NAME> was sitting on a certain time by his window , with her work-basket between her and her old attendant , who was still her faithful companion .
__label__0	At the same moment , all the articles on board the boat that were made of iron or steel -- cooking utensils , arms , <NAME> 's stove , our knives , which were torn from our pockets -- took flight after a similar fashion in the same direction , while the boat , quickening its course , brought up against the beach .
__label__0	His knowledge of history and literature , judging from his letters , appears to have been somewhat vague and ill-digested .
__label__0	This put an end to the discussion .
__label__1	He was passing at nightfall along the <NAME> , and the lamp-lighter was going on before him , under whose hand the street-lamps , blurred by the foggy air , burst out one after another , like so many blazing sunflowers coming into full-blow all at once , -- when a stoppage on the pavement , caused by a train of coal-waggons toiling up from the wharves at the river-side , brought him to a stand-still .
__label__0	164 `` The natives had sufficient confidence '' .
__label__0	`` Well reasoned , <NAME> ; and may we find more bays of <NAME> in our journey than capes of Despair ! ''
__label__1	<NAME> , steady. ’ <NAME> planted himself into his own corner , as firmly as he could ; and on whirled the chaise faster than ever .
__label__0	<NAME> , <NAME> for the King and Director-general of the <NAME> upon the <NAME> and in other parts of <NAME> -- so ran his official title -- although he may be little known , and the article which treats of him may be one of the most curtailed in the great collections of biography , deserves to occupy one of the most prominent positions among colonizers and explorers .
__label__1	They were all three more sharply on the alert , and less deadened by the miserable influences of the place and time .
__label__1	‘ He has got his discharge , by G -- ! ’ said the man .
__label__0	`` No , my boy ; but I would willingly have given a finger for my discovery . ''
__label__0	After seeing the vessels made secure in the frozen creek .
__label__1	He is a little man with a face all crushed together , who appears , from a certain blue and speckled appearance that one of his cheeks presents , to have been blown up , in the way of business , at some odd time or times .
__label__1	<NAME> looked at him for the reason .
__label__0	The conformity of their characters and their tastes proved no barrier to their uniting in the closest of friendships , and they became inseparable companions .
__label__1	<NAME> ( who , if he had ever been an object of interest in his life , had been one that day ) accompanied them , joining sometimes one group and sometimes the other , as brother <NAME> , laying his hand upon his shoulder , bade him walk with him , or <NAME> , looking smilingly round , beckoned him to come and talk with the old friend who understood him best , and who could win a smile into his careworn face when none else could .
__label__1	But I am never fatigued .
__label__1	His recent despondency , not to say despair , was gone in a moment .
__label__1	‘ Are my feathers so very much rumpled ? ’ said <NAME> , coolly going up to the looking-glass .
__label__1	It had been the calling of his life to slink and skulk and dog and waylay , and he knew his calling well .
__label__0	There was a perfect mania .
__label__0	“ Done at the <NAME> of <NAME> , on the 24th of May , 1862 .
__label__0	At the sound of his voice , the cabin door opened , and the <NAME> ’ s head and shoulders protruded onto the deck .
__label__1	‘ Fine mornin ’ , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , senior .
__label__1	There ’ s <NAME> , and <NAME> , and now here ’ s another little stranger. ’ ‘ A female stranger ? ’ inquires the <NAME> .
__label__1	She tore along the narrow pavement : elbowing the passengers from side to side ; and darting almost under the horses ' heads , crossed crowded streets , where clusters of persons were eagerly watching their opportunity to do the like .
__label__1	I had when I first entered on it , and a good man he was .
__label__1	He strengthens and invigorates a man , <NAME> , does <NAME> , in his moral nature. ’ Mr <NAME> snapped at the expression .
__label__1	A gentleman from <NAME> ’ ‘ Bring him up here ! ’ Mr <NAME> muttered , as if he deemed that unnecessary ; but , turning to Mr Dorrit , said , ‘ Mrs Clennam .
__label__1	They were very glad to set the chair down , and give a good round loud double-knock at the street door .
__label__1	Not for her life , not for her life !
__label__1	On the anniversary of her birthday , which was upon the nineteenth of July [ ‘ at ten minutes past three o ’ clock in the morning , ’ thought Mrs. Nickleby in a parenthesis , ‘ for I recollect asking what o ’ clock it was ’ ) , <NAME> would give a great feast to all his tenants , and would return them three and a half per cent on the amount of their last half-year ’ s rent , as would be fully described and recorded in the fashionable intelligence , to the immeasurable delight and admiration of all the readers thereof .
__label__1	Glancing at the angry eyes which now avoid him and at the angry figure trembling from head to foot , yet striving to be still , <NAME> feels his way with his forefinger and in a low voice proceeds .
__label__1	Falling asleep , and leaving great blocks of building materials dangling in the air ; waking again , to resume work and get them into their places .
__label__1	He was angry only one night , and that was not to me , but <NAME> .
__label__0	The inhabitants were tall and well proportioned , alert , vigorous , and intelligent .
__label__1	He charged himself even with restraining <NAME> from improving his opportunity .
__label__1	`` And as to <NAME> , '' resumes <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ I am certain of it .
__label__1	At his particular request , I appointed to call for him at the Castle at half past eight on Monday morning , and so we parted for the time .
__label__1	A fourth did nothing but whistle .
__label__1	`` Why , you see , <NAME> '' -- he had caught the name from me -- '' we are a-going at present into the next street .
__label__1	It might cut somebody , by accident .
__label__1	`` And then , '' he added , whispering and grinning , `` if that ever was to happen -- which it wo n't -- the birds that have never been caged would kill 'em . ''
__label__1	How long I have been wearing out , I do n't know ; I seemed to break down in an hour .
__label__1	Every boy was there , but every boy was afraid to speak , so <NAME> glared along the lines to assure himself ; and every eye drooped , and every head cowered down , as he did so .
__label__1	It ’ s come true , you see. ’ He was as imperturbable as ever , to all appearance , and nodded his head in a moralising way as he looked round the room .
__label__1	Stretching forth her trembling fingers as she spoke , the old creature shook them exultingly before her face , and fumbling in her pocket , brought out an old time-discoloured tin snuff-box , from which she shook a few grains into the outstretched palm of her companion , and a few more into her own .
__label__0	Yes , and I had not been dreaming !
__label__1	‘ <NAME> ’ t be alarmed , ’ cried <NAME> , running down ; ‘ here it is ; it ’ s all out , it ’ s all over ; pray compose yourselves ; there ’ s no harm done ; ’ and with these , and a thousand other assurances , he delivered the baby ( whom , in his hurry , he had carried upside down ) , to Mrs. <NAME> , and ran back to assist <NAME> , who was rubbing his head very hard , and looking much bewildered by his tumble .
__label__1	To this mind of the heart , if I may call it so , in <NAME> , some bright ray of the truth shot straight .
__label__0	No ship appeared upon the desert sea .
__label__1	We hear sometimes of an action for damages against the unqualified medical practitioner , who has deformed a broken limb in pretending to heal it .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> thought for a brief space .
__label__0	And , as if he had not already done enough for the generous wine which he had distilled on the slopes of <NAME> , the sun chose to be part of the party .
__label__1	`` Go on , if you please , '' said I .
__label__0	<NAME> expeditions were formerly made there from <NAME> , to collect the salt deposited on its banks , as the waters contain great quantities of chloride of sodium .
__label__1	Only the subject we were speaking of , ” said I , “ was rather painful to me. ” The action of her fingers was like the action of knitting .
__label__1	It will be of no use your rubbing yourselves ; you won ’ t rub the marks out that I shall give you .
__label__0	“ Good for that ! ” said the excited hunter ; “ we ’ ll fight him .
__label__1	The patient figures at work were swarthy with the filings of iron and steel that danced on every bench and bubbled up through every chink in the planking .
__label__1	‘ Ye -- yes , ’ returned old <NAME> , rubbing his hands slowly , and considering the matter half aloud , as something pensive in the bright eyes looking at him arrested his attention .
__label__0	In about half an hour they had made the three miles which separated the cape from <NAME> .
__label__0	It was during this time that the captain of the <NAME> buried the bottle in which his namesake of the <NAME> claimed to have found a letter containing <NAME> 's announcement of his intention to visit the austral seas .
__label__1	The old lime-tree walk was like green cloisters , the very shadows of the cherry-trees and apple-trees were heavy with fruit , the gooseberry-bushes were so laden that their branches arched and rested on the earth , the strawberries and raspberries grew in like profusion , and the peaches basked by the hundred on the wall .
__label__0	Fetiches and gri-gris were hung over his door , and in one of his huts there was a square stool , supported on two sides by four little wooden effigies of men .
__label__1	He wrung his hand , only adding , ‘ Blind leaders of the blind , <NAME> !
__label__1	The cause is a young child ’ s guiltless of all harm or wrong , but nothing goes well with it !
__label__1	This was done and said with a comical mixture of jest and earnest , and , leading to a great amount of laughter , made them very merry indeed .
__label__1	I remember when <NAME> was born -- ’ ‘ Ay , ay , ay , ’ said Mr Dombey , bending over the basket bedstead , and slightly bending his brows at the same time .
__label__0	“ I will attempt anything that is desired , <NAME> , ” answered the sailor , “ and you know well that I am not a man to flinch ! ” “ Remember , besides , that we number another sailor amongst us now , ” remarked <NAME> .
__label__0	The soundings , surveys , plans , and astronomical observations were completed ; but , before finally leaving the island , <NAME> wished thoroughly to explore the depths of the bay .
__label__1	‘ Here you are , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ bonds -- take care of them .
__label__0	The same phrase was pronounced by the same individual .
__label__0	Thus a remarkably brilliant flame would be obtained , whose light would rival the electric light , which , as everybody knows , is , according to <NAME> 's experiments , equal to that of eleven hundred and seventy-one wax candles , -- not one more , nor one less .
__label__0	And when his eyes fell upon the letter bearing upon it the authority of the imperial seal -- the letter which , no doubt , contained the remedy for so many evils , the safety of all this war-ravaged country -- <NAME> felt within himself a fierce desire to dash on across the steppe , to accomplish the distance which separated him from <NAME> as the crow would fly it , to be an eagle that he might overtop all obstacles , to be a hurricane that he might sweep through the air at a hundred versts an hour , and to be at last face to face with the <NAME> , and to exclaim : “ Your highness , from his Majesty the Czar ! ” On the next morning at six o ’ clock , <NAME> started off again .
__label__1	Never ! ’ Again the <NAME> inclined his head and showed his teeth , and seemed to say , ‘ Remarkable indeed !
__label__1	‘ Do you know me now , man ? ’ The landlord scratched his head , looked at the ceiling , and at the stranger , and smiled feebly .
__label__1	He grasped them heartily , raised them to his lips , kissed them , and still held them .
__label__1	`` Well , gentlemen , '' resumes the coroner .
__label__1	My hown cuthen'th gone to <NAME> at thith prethent minute , to hoffer him hany termth .
__label__1	‘ Yours , sir , I ’ m sure , ’ replied Mr Abel mildly .
__label__0	They cut the flesh into pieces , and dry it upon a slope in the open air , by exposing it to the sun .
__label__1	Nor was this the end of the day 's bad work , for <NAME> so shouted and danced his angry blood up , that it boiled again , on hearing when the day closed in that the son-in-law of the despatched , another of the people 's enemies and insulters , was coming into <NAME> under a guard five hundred strong , in cavalry alone .
__label__0	<NAME> had heard of the existence of a <NAME> of female warriors who had founded a vast empire , which caused the river <NAME> to be called the _River of the <NAME> .
__label__0	The departure was fixed for ten in the morning , on the 5th .
__label__1	Mysterious and incomprehensible , the <NAME> , with that lively sense upon him of having done a little business for the youngsters , remained all day , even to his most intimate friends ; and but that <NAME> attributed his winks and grins , and other such pantomimic reliefs of himself , to his satisfaction in the success of their innocent deception upon old <NAME> , he would assuredly have betrayed himself before night .
__label__0	But his replies sufficed to make the route clear to <NAME> , and that was all that was wanted .
__label__1	I recollect it was settled by general consent that <NAME> was quite a misrepresented country , and had nothing objectionable in it , but a tiger or two , and a little heat in the warm part of the day .
__label__0	The travellers set to work at once and soon accomplished it .
__label__0	They could not go out , except at the risk of being frozen .
__label__1	She was much more accessible , much more free and engaging , much less exacting ; insomuch that she now entertained a host of followers and admirers , to the bitter indignation of ladies with daughters to marry , who were to be regarded as Having revolted from <NAME> on the <NAME> grievance , and erected a rebellious standard .
__label__1	‘ What ails you ? ’ said the man , immediately aware of it , though so intent on the advancing waters ; ‘ I see nothing afloat. ’ The red light was gone , the shudder was gone , and his gaze , which had come back to the boat for a moment , travelled away again .
__label__0	“ But he is not an ape , ” answered <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> take it away. ” I had never been struck at so keenly , for my thanklessness to <NAME> , as through the brazen impostor Pumblechook .
__label__0	The chances of success diminished in rapid proportion ; and it was from chance alone that the meeting with the projectile might be expected .
__label__0	[ Illustration : `` The caravan met a messenger . '' ]
__label__0	The first volley so astonished them that they remained motionless .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> said look again , mother ; ’ and the speaker fixed her eyes upon her .
__label__1	Oliver wondered what picking the old gentleman 's pocket in play , had to do with his chances of being a great man .
__label__1	Now , he started up , every minute , and with gasping mouth and burning skin , hurried to and fro , in such a paroxysm of fear and wrath that even they -- used to such sights -- recoiled from him with horror .
__label__0	Some of them struck the sea and ricochetted , losing themselves in the distance .
__label__0	<NAME> accepted the traveller 's presents with childish glee .
__label__0	Meanwhile , let us observe the sunset , which must be magnificent . ''
__label__1	“ What floor do you want ? ” “ The top .
__label__1	‘ I beg your parding , young man , ’ said Mrs. Raddle , in a cold perspiration of anger .
__label__1	So having warned him out of <NAME> , I made an afternoon of it to warn him to keep out of it now he WAS away , and go farther from it , and maintain a bright look-out that I did n't catch him coming back again . ''
__label__0	It was like the arch of a bridge , under which rushed the foaming water .
__label__0	`` None , sir , '' answered the <NAME> .
__label__1	I know that from the beds of those who were past recovery , thanks have often , often gone up , in the last hour , for his patient ministration .
__label__1	I deserve a bow now and then .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> presented her , and his lordship begged her to sit down near him .
__label__1	Then the child ’ s head disappeared , and the prison-keeper ’ s head disappeared , but the little voice prolonged the strain until the door clashed .
__label__0	A single feeling seemed to unite him to the outer world , his love for <NAME> , who was not separated from him .
__label__0	The report was sounded , and the bear rolled over on the ice .
__label__1	<NAME> nodded his concurrence in the opinion .
__label__1	He do n't make himself comfortable with it .
__label__1	<NAME> W. had better have come here , and <NAME> too .
__label__0	Even the great mountain profiles began to fade away , the dazzling colors to grow duller , the jet black shadows greyer , and the general effect mistier .
__label__0	really with you , captain , everything becomes easy. ” “ Yes , my brave <NAME> , ” answered the engineer , “ but on condition , however , that you help me , for you do as much as three men in all our work. ” <NAME> and the sailor then re-embarked on board the “ Bonadventure , ” the anchor was weighed , the sail hoisted , and the wind drove her rapidly towards <NAME> .
__label__1	When I left the <NAME> for good , I asked for them , and brought them away with me .
__label__1	I have a child who will soon call <NAME> by the name by which I call you .
__label__0	In the meanwhile , the bad weather came with the month of May , the November of the northern zones .
__label__1	‘ I remember very well , sir , ’ rejoined <NAME> .
__label__1	His outer clothing removed , the visitor then took a seat on the opposite side of the fire .
__label__0	In vain Mrs. <NAME> paid ten dollars a line for serious articles , humorous articles , and smart , scathing paragraphs treating the dangers as chimerical .
__label__1	To pass , <NAME> , from the ensign to the captain . ''
__label__1	‘ _I_ mean of the foreign man , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Well ; if you are curious to know , of course I have no objection. ’ Ever willing to sacrifice his own feelings to the wishes of his friend , <NAME> at once took a pretty long taste .
__label__1	`` My Lady is too high in position , too handsome , too accomplished , too superior in most respects to the best of those by whom she is surrounded , not to have her enemies and traducers , I dare say .
__label__0	`` I will imagine I am at the <NAME> ! ''
__label__1	There was a gentleman in the coach who sat on the opposite seat and looked very large in a quantity of wrappings , but he sat gazing out of the other window and took no notice of me .
__label__1	I strongly suspect him of having had a hand in spiriting away Lizzie. ’ ‘ Everything , ’ returned <NAME> impatiently , ‘ seems , by a fatality , to bring us round to <NAME> .
__label__0	`` Each in turn , '' replied <NAME> .
__label__1	Nothing more was said between the happy pair .
__label__1	‘ Very good , ’ said <NAME> , looking about : ‘ ve -- ry good .
__label__0	Seeing that they were not pursued , and conscious that they themselves had been the aggressors , they returned to traffic with the <NAME> as if nothing had happened .
__label__1	‘ If , ’ said <NAME> , with solemn patience , ‘ I have not expressed myself with clearness , <NAME> , the fault of course is mine .
__label__0	If <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> had survived , it was because , assembled under their tent , they had been hurled into the sea at the instant when the fragments of the island rained down on every side .
__label__1	He was going away at the end of the half-year , if not sooner , and was more spirited and independent than before in my eyes , and therefore more engaging than before ; but beyond this I remember nothing .
__label__1	He returned to where he had stood before -- advanced a pace -- another -- another still .
__label__0	Their meal concluded , each retired to the corner in which he had rested the preceding night , and <NAME> was not long in going to sleep near the sailor , who had stretched himself beside the fireplace .
__label__0	He was nursing his wrath to keep it warm !
__label__0	And while his fingers tattooed a slightly more audible march , he made a sign with his head to <NAME> , which signified as clearly as possible , “ Go on !
__label__1	His thoughts reverting from this occupation to the little old gentleman who had given him the shilling , he suddenly recollected that that was the very day -- nay , nearly the very hour -- at which the little old gentleman had said he should be at the Notary ’ s house again .
__label__1	‘ I ’ ll tell ‘ ee more ; hear this , too .
__label__0	But in the case under consideration , the solution of the problem regarding the conquest of the <NAME> , <NAME> had no flight to take in the sublime regions of analysis .
__label__1	‘ Because I could remember , when I was a child , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ but that is very , very long ago , or at least it seems so .
__label__1	‘ Ride on ! ’ I noticed , I remember , as he paused , looking at me with his handsome head a little thrown back , and his glass raised in his hand , that , though the freshness of the sea-wind was on his face , and it was ruddy , there were traces in it , made since I last saw it , as if he had applied himself to some habitual strain of the fervent energy which , when roused , was so passionately roused within him .
__label__1	<NAME> ’ t that your opinion ? ’ ‘ Quite ! ’ replied the Secretary ; and so withdrew .
__label__0	Then , turning towards the <NAME> and <NAME> : `` A repast awaits you in your cabin , '' said he .
__label__1	to be peeped at like a wild lion through the iron bars -- to gnash one ’ s teeth and howl , through the long still night , to the merry ring of a heavy chain and to roll and twine among the straw , transported with such brave music .
__label__1	`` The man who wrote this article , '' he observes by way of preface , nodding at the fire as if he were nodding down at the man from a mount , `` has a well-balanced mind . ''
__label__1	Such breakfast as he had , he took at the comfortless public-house where he had parted from <NAME> on the occasion of their night-walk .
__label__0	Well , you know , <NAME> , that to please me you planned a pleasure trip ; but what could give us such genuine pleasure , or be so useful , as to save those unfortunate fellows , cast off by their country ? ” “ Helena ! ” exclaimed <NAME> .
__label__1	I should be an inconvenience at <NAME> 's ; I was not expected , and my bed would not be ready ; I should be too far from <NAME> 's , and she was exacting and might n't like it .
__label__0	At the banking-house he was received with the respect due to a man who has sixteen thousand pounds deposited to his credit ; having made that point sure , <NAME> asked for a sheet of white paper , and in his large sailor 's handwriting he sent his acceptance of the plan to the address given above .
__label__0	Shall we try to catch it ? ” asked <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> was not much in the habit of cracking jokes , nor did he feel , in his heart , by any means waggish then .
__label__0	To certain beaches which the decrease of the waters has left uncovered , and which have the privilege of attracting the greater number of turtles , there has been given the name of “ royal beaches. ” When the harvest is gathered it is a holiday for the <NAME> , who give themselves up to games , dancing , and drinking ; and it is also a holiday for the alligators of the river , who hold high revelry on the remains of the amphibians .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> was right in the choice he had made , and if , as appeared probable , the gipsies should follow the second route from <NAME> to <NAME> , he had every chance of arriving before them .
__label__0	I caught a glimpse of a black mass disappearing in the east , its beacon lights dying out in the distance .
__label__0	`` I know it , '' he said , in that calm tone which could counteract the most terrible apprehensions .
__label__1	Indeed , the excitement extended itself over the whole street , and groups of ladies might be seen standing at the doors , ( some in the interesting condition in which Mrs. <NAME> had last appeared in public , ) relating their experiences of similar occurrences .
__label__1	`` If you please , '' said <NAME> .
__label__1	The stream , like a sullied looking-glass in a gloomy place , reflected the clouds heavily ; and the low banks leaned over here and there , as if they were half curious , and half afraid , to see their darkening pictures in the water .
__label__1	Blind leaders of the blind !
__label__1	Either of us might be accused of it , you know. ” “ Only neither of us is , ” I remarked .
__label__1	<NAME> went on to say with considerable hesitation and reluctance that there was one thing more she wished us to know , and felt we ought to know , and which she hoped would not offend us .
__label__0	The letter penned , the <NAME> re-read it attentively , then signed it , preceding his name with the words “ Byt po semou , ” which , signifying “ So be it , ” constitutes the decisive formula of the <NAME> emperors .
__label__0	Four days later , on the 14th of <NAME> , the jangada passed the mouths of the <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ It ’ s a coincidence , Mr Twemlow ; ’ here he descended from his perch , and sauntered towards him ; ‘ that the friends I am standing by to-day are the friends at whose house I met you !
__label__0	He had excellent reasons for this , as he had just heard of the arrival of the real sovereign , named <NAME> or <NAME> .
__label__0	`` Not with you , <NAME> , '' was her answer .
__label__0	He landed on the <NAME> of <NAME> .
__label__1	I have been a determined character in later life , and I suppose I was then .
__label__0	cried <NAME> , with a shout of laughter ; `` and you 'll undertake the job , no doubt ? ''
__label__1	From this spot , <NAME> wandered along all the galleries , up and down all the staircases , and once again round the whole area of the yard .
__label__1	The company might have had other engagements , or they might have felt their inferiority , but in any case they dispersed by degrees , and not being replaced by other company , left their new patron in possession of the Break of Day .
__label__0	The black showed the greatest patience and even extreme zeal in instructing his pupil , and the pupil exhibited remarkable intelligence in profiting by the lessons he received from his master .
__label__0	The learned <NAME> pilgrim was accompanied by two friends , Dr. Erdl and <NAME> , a painter .
__label__1	There were so many of them , that although <NAME> put one hand under the bottom book and his other hand and his chin on the top book , and hugged them all closely , the middle book slipped out before he reached the door , and then they all tumbled down on the floor .
__label__1	Resigning himself to which condition with a perfectly satisfied manner , <NAME> begs the favour of another cup of coffee .
__label__1	He was out of breath by that time , as he might well be , and his heart seemed to jerk faster than the little shop-bell , as it quivered and jingled behind him with his hasty shutting of the door .
__label__0	In fact , quite the reverse .
__label__1	A great many more iniquities of a similar nature might have been disclosed , only the toast being all eaten , the tea having got very weak , and <NAME> holding out no indications of meaning to go , <NAME> suddenly recollected that he had a most pressing appointment with the shepherd , and took himself off accordingly .
__label__0	We know what we have to expect !
__label__0	On the 24th February , as the little squadron came forth from the strait , it encountered a violent storm , which dispersed it .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> has wealthy friends who would coin their very hearts to save her in such a strait as this .
__label__0	They left Khan-tcheou , and after riding for twelve days they reached the borders of a sandy desert , and entered the city of <NAME> .
__label__1	“ Hah ! ” said <NAME> at last , as he moved towards the papers on the table .
__label__0	They felt that they would be no friends of <NAME> 's if they were discouraged by impossibilities .
__label__0	The gulf has become a lake , but it is also an abyss , and no lead-line has yet sounded its depths .
__label__0	Even their decided novelty and very strange character produced any thing but a pleasing effect on the organs of sight .
__label__0	He lowered his voice and continued : `` But <NAME> will tell you all that , sir .
__label__0	The long twilight imparted a coolness to the atmosphere eagerly enjoyed by the passengers after the stifling heat of the day .
__label__1	`` Why , no , sir , I could n't .
__label__1	He was jocular , too , as to the heeling of his shoes ; but became grave on the subject of his cravat , and promised her that , when she could afford it , she should buy him a new one .
__label__1	Shall I give you a ride , <NAME> ?
__label__1	At six o'clock next morning , <NAME> : having exchanged his cocked hat for a round one , and encased his person in a blue great-coat with a cape to it : took his place on the outside of the coach , accompanied by the criminals whose settlement was disputed ; with whom , in due course of time , he arrived in <NAME> .
__label__1	She does not even know my name. ’ ‘ I ’ ll ask it for all that .
__label__0	He learnt <NAME> 's adventures , and through what various trials the colonists had passed .
__label__1	Here and there a Hatchment , with the whole science of <NAME> in it , loomed down upon the street , like an Archbishop discoursing on <NAME> .
__label__1	It was as well that he did so ; for although the <NAME> was not gone long , he was gone much longer than he had proposed .
__label__0	What if he should never again behold his <NAME> fatherland ?
__label__0	But there were two or three public buildings , a barrack , and a church dedicated to <NAME> Theresa , which was a cathedral by the side of the modest chapel at <NAME> .
__label__0	On what does the honorable gentleman base his _most firm conviction_ ? ''
__label__1	<NAME> thinks half so bad of me as my own father does .
__label__1	Nicholas could not go to bed without expatiating on the excellences and munificence of the brothers <NAME> , and relating the great success which had attended his efforts that day .
__label__1	‘ I ’ ve brought you a softer pillow , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ instead of the temporary one you had last night. ’ ‘ Thank you , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> will be given before you as to the circumstances attending that death , and you will give your verdict according to the -- skittles ; they must be stopped , you know , beadle ! -- evidence , and not according to anything else .
__label__0	This occupied them until February 15th .
__label__1	I must do <NAME> the further justice of saying that he had looked more and more ashamed and that he looked most ashamed and very earnest when he now replied with a burning face , `` Upon my word and honour , upon my life , upon my soul , <NAME> , as I am a living man , I 'll act according to your wish !
__label__1	So he remains , dodging and lurking about in the gloom of the staircase while they confer .
__label__1	I have never known the wind to be in the east for a single moment since the day when he took me to the porch to read the name .
__label__0	In the meanwhile <NAME> was ordered to mount guard below the windows of <NAME> , and when <NAME> received an order he obeyed it without any questioning .
__label__0	It was the crejimba , of the palm family , which does not bear edible fruit .
__label__1	This is marriage , <NAME> ; and <NAME> bless you both , in it , for a pair of babes in the wood as you are ! ’ My aunt said this in a sprightly way , and gave me a kiss to ratify the blessing .
__label__1	Has nothing but cold water to drink , and never feels thirsty ( great applause ) .
__label__0	Pretty time to tell us so !
__label__1	That night I knew he had a false and thankless heart .
__label__1	This was a joke ; so <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , all the specials , and <NAME> , went into fits of laughter of five minutes ’ duration .
__label__1	On glancing at the address , the parochial functionary observed that it contained no name .
__label__0	But on the morning of the 24th of <NAME> ’ s arms were extended toward a point in the horizon ; he raised himself , at first on his knees , then upright , and his hand seemed to make a signal .
__label__0	Then , with <NAME> 's assistance , he built a resting-place in an iceberg .
__label__1	I told her so , as she sat brooding after this outburst .
__label__1	Mrs. <NAME> continued to open and sort letters and to repeat occasionally in quite a charming tone of voice and with a smile of perfect composure , `` No , indeed . ''
__label__1	Evidently in observance of their nightly custom , she put some bread before herself , and touched his glass with her lips ; but <NAME> saw she was troubled and took nothing .
__label__0	At present , the colonists had reason on their side against <NAME> .
__label__1	We think we have hinted elsewhere , that <NAME> had a way of becoming sentimental after brandy .
__label__1	This done , and <NAME> having satisfied his appetite ( <NAME> could eat nothing but a small crust of bread which they made him swallow ) , the two men laid themselves down on chairs for a short nap .
__label__0	Does not its parallelism with the mountain chain suggest a causative relation ?
__label__1	I have derived inexpressible comfort from it .
__label__1	I am not a coward , <NAME> , but to tell you a secret , I am a little afraid of Jack. ’ ‘ No , no !
__label__0	As the latter was hanging back , <NAME> pushed him towards <NAME> , whose eyes expressed the liveliest gratitude .
__label__0	Too impatient to await the awakening of the astronomer and to hear what representations he had to make , <NAME> , the count , and the lieutenant , constituting themselves what might be designated “ the <NAME> ” of the colony , spent the whole of the remainder of the day in starting and discussing the wildest conjectures about their situation .
__label__1	I have felt sincerely interested in her , and have had a great desire to know something more about her .
__label__1	' ” He was drawing his hand from his breast ; the prisoner chancing to look up in his hurried wonder as he wrote , the hand stopped , closing upon something .
__label__0	`` The masters of the island ! ''
__label__0	“ I am here , ” replied <NAME> .
__label__1	`` And as <NAME> and you are happily good friends , I should like to know , '' said my guardian , `` what you think , my dear .
__label__0	The captain concluded the narrative of his life .
__label__0	There was nothing for it but to run her ashore .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> in a balloon !
__label__1	Then , and but then , he met her glance for an instant in her first surprise ; but when he touched her , in alighting , with his soft white hand , it overlooked him altogether as before .
__label__0	listened to the sound critically for an instant , and then said to himself in a relieved tone , but in his native tongue : `` One man all right !
__label__1	Shall I ever forget the morning I looked scornfully at him when he offered to carry my parasol ?
__label__0	It made him uneasy about the future .
__label__1	‘ The late <NAME> , gentlemen , was very fond of me , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	He ca n't be expected to know much of such a labyrinth . ''
__label__0	The surrounding attendants , and especially ladies , were much more inquisitive .
__label__1	In this state of things , matters seem to be approximating to a fix of another kind , when another inside passenger in a corner , who is nearly suffocated , cries faintly , ‘ I ’ ll get out. ’ This is no matter of relief or self-congratulation to the driver , for his immovable philosophy is perfectly undisturbed by anything that happens in the coach .
__label__0	The <NAME> was newly built , and had been making a trial trip a few miles outside the <NAME> of <NAME> .
__label__0	When we entered the house we found my uncle surrounded by workmen and porters , who were packing up .
__label__0	Before daybreak the next morning , the 26th of <NAME> , the horse was drawing the kibitka through the forests of birch trees towards the banks of the <NAME> .
__label__1	I neither wish to spare myself nor to be spared .
__label__0	`` Let us stand nearer , '' resumed <NAME> , who , glass in hand , kept examining the shore .
__label__1	I applied the key on hearing this and opened the door .
__label__0	That would be an imprudence I would not commit , even though the crew would allow me . ''
__label__1	It at once reduced <NAME> to begging , as a special favour , to be allowed to say what Mrs. <NAME> was most curious to hear .
__label__1	She fell upon her knees , and clinging to this stroller ’ s child looked up at her almost with veneration .
__label__1	‘ Now then ! ’ cried <NAME> , poking his head out at the front-door .
__label__0	From the governor 's house where they slept , to the palace of the king , the streets were kept by armed men .
__label__1	Every street was a sawpit , and there were no top-sawyers ; every passenger was an under-sawyer , with the sawdust blinding him and choking him .
__label__1	It was like her cordial voice in my ears .
__label__0	He eagerly fastened the cord round his waist , stuck on his lamp , clasped the child to his breast with his left arm , and , keeping his right hand free to hold the knife , he gave the signal agreed on , to have the rope pulled up .
__label__0	“ There is no doubt that the problem of the change of the terrestrial axis was correctly stated , and it should have been correctly worked out .
__label__0	No lateral gallery opened from the side walls of the pit , which was gradually narrowing into the shape of a funnel .
__label__1	`` <NAME> , '' said <NAME> , very slowly rubbing his gloved hands , as if , to his cold sense of touch , they were much the same in black kid or out of it , `` this was an ill-advised marriage of Mr .
__label__0	After putting into port at <NAME> and <NAME> , at the extremity of the peninsular of <NAME> , they reached the island of <NAME> ( <NAME> ) , situated near the eastern entrance of the straits of <NAME> , and the island of <NAME> , called <NAME> .
__label__0	The houses , built of fir-wood , blazed like torches -- a hundred and fifty flaming at once .
__label__1	The good brothers and <NAME> occupied some time in discussing the probability of his return ; and , when it became apparent that he would not come back , they hesitated whether or no to send after him .
__label__1	But , now that fortune had cast in his way a nameless orphan , at whom even the meanest could point the finger of scorn , he retorted on him with interest .
__label__1	The spirit of contradiction was strong in <NAME> 's breast , at the moment ; and it was rendered stronger by his friend 's confident smile .
__label__1	He was so very solicitous on this head that <NAME> gave him the strongest assurances that he did him no injustice .
__label__1	For , we turn up our eyes and say that we are all alike in death , and we might turn them down and work the saying out in this world , so far .
__label__0	`` That is a claim I ca n't admit , '' answered <NAME> , gravely , forcibly restraining himself .
__label__1	‘ Upon my soul and body ! ’ said Mr Toots , taking his seat beside her .
__label__1	The <NAME> 's Head It was a heavy mass of building , that chateau of Monsieur the <NAME> , with a large stone courtyard before it , and two stone sweeps of staircase meeting in a stone terrace before the principal door .
__label__0	The old boatman crouched down forward among his men , solely occupied in keeping off the ice blocks , a maneuver which was performed without noise .
__label__1	How many anxious years , how many pinching days and sleepless nights , before I scraped together that ten thousand pounds ! -- Ten thousand pounds !
__label__1	Though sometimes even they depart from me before a dread that arises when I look at <NAME> . ''
__label__1	‘ I say ? ’ ‘ Well ? ’ ‘ Are you going to come here regular ? ’ ‘ No , ’ rejoined <NAME> , shaking her head , ‘ I ’ m going away again to-night .
__label__0	Did he hesitate to speak ?
__label__1	That cruel man with the wooden leg aggravated my sufferings .
__label__0	<NAME> even swore that they were `` bleeding , '' and the others were too busy to contradict him .
__label__1	He , self-important , unbending , formal , austere .
__label__0	In what condition was he going to find it ?
__label__0	`` Such a supposition or something like it has been put forth by <NAME> , '' replied <NAME> ; `` but your own sense will convince you that it is quite untenable when you consider that lava , however hot and liquid it may be at the commencement of its journey , can not flow on for hundreds of miles , up hills , across ravines , and over plains , all the time in streams of almost exactly equal width . ''
__label__1	‘ Now , ’ said Mr Boffin , who , in his frankness , felt that it did not become him to have a gentleman in his employment five minutes , without reposing some confidence in him , ‘ you must be let a little more into our affairs , <NAME> .
__label__0	He was dressed in a suit of ample dimensions , loose neckerchief , open shirtcollar , disclosing a robust neck ; his cuffs were invariably unbuttoned , through which appeared a pair of red hands .
__label__1	When this was at last done , and addressing <NAME> as `` General , '' she gave him her arm , to the great entertainment of some idlers who were looking on , he was so discomposed and begged me so respectfully `` not to desert him '' that I could not make up my mind to do it , especially as <NAME> was always tractable with me and as she too said , `` <NAME> , my dear , you will accompany us , of course . ''
__label__1	Put him out , Smike. ’ The drudge knew better from long experience , than to hesitate about obeying , so he bundled the victim out by a side-door , and <NAME> perched himself again on his own stool , supported by Mrs. Squeers , who occupied another at his side .
__label__0	`` Too hard for me , '' said <NAME> .
__label__1	Does she know your son ? ’ ‘ <NAME> up together , sir , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	He took his father ’ s place as overman , and diligently superintended the works of this colony of miners .
__label__1	Her hand , for a moment , left the velvet chair to bring a knife within her reach upon the table ; then she stood as she had stood before .
__label__0	What , then , was her emotion when she accidentally saw the notice in the <NAME> !
__label__0	What one grasshopper does on a small scale , thousands do on a grand scale. ” “ It ’ s a terrible shower , ” said the hunter ; “ more so than hail itself in the devastation it causes. ” “ It is impossible to prevent it , ” replied <NAME> .
__label__1	There ain ’ t a gent ’ lman in all the land -- nor yet sailing upon all the sea -- that can love his lady more than I love her , though there ’ s many a common man -- would say better -- what he meant. ’ I thought it affecting to see such a sturdy fellow as <NAME> was now , trembling in the strength of what he felt for the pretty little creature who had won his heart .
__label__0	`` Well , yes , <NAME> , I am <NAME> , there is a brig <NAME> , and it will sail . ''
__label__0	He looked like a man equally prepared to enjoy superfluity or total want .
__label__1	You have been drawing pretty freely here ; your name occurs pretty often in <NAME> 's cash-book ; but you are in debt , of course ? ” “ I am afraid I must say yes , sir. ” “ You know you must say yes ; do n't you ? ” said <NAME> .
__label__0	My uncle , who already belonged to nearly every literary and scientific institution in <NAME> , immediately yielded to the amiable wishes of good `` And now , '' he said , after many expressions of gratitude and good will , `` if you will tell me what books you expected to find , perhaps I may be of some assistance to you . ''
__label__1	I was pretty good at most exercises in which country boys are adepts , but as I was conscious of wanting elegance of style for the <NAME> , -- not to say for other waters , -- I at once engaged to place myself under the tuition of the winner of a prize-wherry who plied at our stairs , and to whom I was introduced by my new allies .
__label__1	It was interesting to be in the quiet old town once more , and it was not disagreeable to be here and there suddenly recognized and stared after .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> demanded how he afterwards recognised him then ?
__label__1	After a few other preliminaries , equally brief , and having settled the road each party should take to avoid suspicion , they separated .
__label__1	And it was clear he meant to do it .
__label__0	How had <NAME> & Co. been able to build their foundries and collect their staff ?
__label__0	Now we can boldly raise a wall of snow as high as the gunwale ; and , if we want to , we can make it ten feet thick , for there is no lack of material . ''
__label__0	Then he put on the shirts of artists , and warriors , and merchants ; but these were no better .
__label__1	Mrs General consequently found her means so much diminished , that , but for the perfect regulation of her mind , she might have felt disposed to question the accuracy of that portion of the late service which had declared that the commissary could take nothing away with him .
__label__1	I say , how the <NAME> would bother 'em would n't he ? '
__label__0	How contradict those bold ones whom the chances of their enterprise had borne over that invisible face of the disc , which no human eye until then had ever seen ?
__label__0	That was ten years ago .
__label__1	I parted with the secret , even while I was angry with myself for doing so .
__label__1	A place of business in <NAME> like <NAME> 's place of business in <NAME> , would soon have driven the <NAME> out of its mind and into the <NAME> .
__label__1	You may also tell him , from me , that after abandoning his worldly goods and position to this butcherly mob , I wonder he is not at the head of them .
__label__1	At this momentous crisis , <NAME> proved herself a vigourous and useful ally , for not confining herself to expressing by scornful smiles a contempt for Mr <NAME> ’ s accomplishments , she took every opportunity of whispering into <NAME> ’ s ear expressions of condolence and sympathy on her being worried by such a ridiculous creature , declaring that she was frightened to death lest <NAME> should fall upon , and beat him , in the fulness of his wrath , and entreating <NAME> to observe how the eyes of the said <NAME> gleamed with love and fury ; passions , it may be observed , which being too much for his eyes rushed into his nose also , and suffused it with a crimson glow .
__label__1	Not so old as you think , friend , perhaps .
__label__0	Well , I don ’ t like such jokes , and the joker had better look out for himself , if he falls into my hands , I can tell him. ” As soon as the first gleam of light appeared in the east , the colonists , suitably armed , repaired to the beach under <NAME> .
__label__1	I dined with him yesterday. ” “ This is an authority to him to pay you that money , to lay out at your irresponsible discretion for your friend .
__label__1	Let us go forward and meet her. ’ As they advanced , she saw them coming , and seemed rather troubled .
__label__1	And I mean to be paid high , Mr Venus , I promise you. ’ ‘ You speak quite revengefully , Mr Wegg. ’ ‘ Revengefully , sir ?
__label__0	`` Ah , it 's you , is it , monsieur ? ''
__label__1	Do you know what that tune is , Mr .
__label__1	Everybody wakes at the same time .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> had previously conveyed to the island several cases of preserved food , besides clothing , and tools and firearms , and a supply of powder and shot .
__label__1	The lawn , the soft , smooth slope , the flower-garden , the clumps of trees where graceful forms of ash and willow are not wanting , the conservatory , the rustic verandah with sweet-smelling creeping plants entwined about the pillars , the simple exterior of the house , the well-ordered offices , though all upon the diminutive scale proper to a mere cottage , bespeak an amount of elegant comfort within , that might serve for a palace .
__label__1	Your sister will be in , in about a quarter of an hour .
__label__0	At that time the country was invaded by five armies , and the belligerents sent a succession of envoys to the <NAME> ambassador , hoping to obtain , if not substantial assistance , at least moral support .
__label__0	Perhaps in his heart <NAME> , in whom the journalist sometimes came to the surface , was not sorry to have the opportunity of sending forth to take its chance an exciting article relating the adventures of the settlers in <NAME> .
__label__0	“ The devastation , gentlemen , ” said the count , who persistently refused to recognize the <NAME> ’ s irritation , “ everywhere was terrible and complete .
__label__1	'When a man 's his own enemy , it 's only because he 's too much his own friend ; not because he 's careful for everybody but himself .
__label__1	‘ Yet I have gained a wonderful power over her , too , let her be as much in earnest as she will ! ’ The reflection brought back the yielding of her face and form as she had drooped under his gaze .
__label__1	Above all the noise we made , I heard them running up the stairs , and crying out -- I heard my mother crying out -- and <NAME> .
__label__0	“ Do not be afraid , <NAME> ! ” cried <NAME> .
__label__0	`` Then how shall we be able to make our way through this atmospheric fog ? ''
__label__1	He looked at the work upon the table , and praised the industry and speed of Mrs. Cratchit and the girls .
__label__1	‘ Nobody would , nobody could , you know .
__label__1	And you remember <NAME> , my dear , ath wath a ’ motht a mother to you ?
__label__0	At that place <NAME> had founded the colony of <NAME> in In a preceding volume we have narrated the fearful catastrophe which procured the name of <NAME> for this spot .
__label__1	They labour in these mills , upon an average , twelve hours a day , which is unquestionably work , and pretty tight work too .
__label__1	If I had been round the world since we parted , we could hardly have been better pleased to meet again .
__label__1	‘ Not for the world , ’ rejoined <NAME> .
__label__1	I knew from her own lips that she regarded herself as the innocent cause of his errors , and as owing him a great debt she ardently desired to pay .
__label__0	This continent is not much better known than the interior of <NAME> , and yet it is from no lack of enterprising travelers .
__label__0	`` To ask for means to leave a country , '' added <NAME> , `` When we have not yet arrived there , seems to me rather inopportune . ''
__label__1	He was contented , you will say .
__label__1	‘ Mr Merdle , this is -- ha -- indeed an honour .
__label__1	You must look to this , and see that her heart does not grow heavy among these solemn ruins .
__label__0	`` Very well , '' said the captain .
__label__1	‘ They were all fine babies , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	Still , to all appearances , the Projectile seemed to be quite as deeply immersed in the shadow as ever , and there was apparently not the slightest sign of such a state of things coming soon to an end .
__label__0	<NAME> , throw out the anchors ! ” The balloon , gradually losing its ascensional force , approached the ground ; the anchors ran along until , at last , one of them caught in the fissure of a rock , and the balloon remained motionless .
__label__0	<NAME> approach showed it to be of great extent .
__label__1	‘ What came of that , I needn ’ t say .
__label__0	<NAME> had asked to be allowed to “ blow ” in his turn , and it was great fun for him ; but he blew so hard that his productions took the most ridiculous shapes , which he admired immensely .
__label__1	What kind of place can it be that you are going to ? ’ ‘ I hardly know , <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> , pressing his sister ’ s hand .
__label__0	That great planet gravitates beyond <NAME> at the mean distance of 11,400,799,642 miles from the sun , and to traverse its vast orbit takes 1311 years , 294 days , 12 hours , 43 minutes , 9 seconds . ''
__label__1	I ’ m going to paint her gravely , one of these days , if she ’ s good. ’ The air of leisurely patronage and indifference with which this is said , as the speaker throws himself back in a chair and clasps his hands at the back of his head , as a rest for it , is very exasperating to the excitable and excited Neville .
__label__1	<NAME> under such circumstances being not to be thought of , <NAME> is attended by her maid , who , impressed from her own bed for that purpose , extremely cold , very sleepy , and generally an injured maid as condemned by circumstances to take office with a cousin , when she had resolved to be maid to nothing less than ten thousand a year , has not a sweet expression of countenance .
__label__0	The explorers who have succeeded him in the same countries unanimously testify to his exactness , and agree in praising his fidelity , knowledge , and sagacity .
__label__0	The stones rolled and sparkled like fiery balls when they crossed through the gleams of light .
__label__1	Remember of what importance you are to society , and do not allow yourself to be worried by what is so very inconsiderately told you by people who ought to know better .
__label__1	‘ Do you remember , <NAME> , on the day we were married , <NAME> ’ s speaking of the ships that might be sailing towards us from the unknown seas ? ’ ‘ Perfectly , my darling ! ’ ‘ I think ... among them ... there is a ship upon the ocean ... bringing ... to you and me ... a little baby , <NAME> ’ The <NAME> had stopped work for the night , and the paths and roads in its neighbourhood were sprinkled with clusters of people going home from their day ’ s labour in it .
__label__0	It is useless to say with what enthusiasm all , especially <NAME> , received this project .
__label__1	Among them all , none showed such fury as the man on horseback , who , throwing himself out of the saddle , and bursting through the crowd as if he were parting water , cried , beneath the window , in a voice that rose above all others , 'Twenty guineas to the man who brings a ladder ! '
__label__1	When he received her letter he was greatly moved , but did not the less sensibly feel that she was far divided from him by more than distance .
__label__0	The month of May had come -- it corresponds in those regions to the month of November in northern lands -- and the ice-packs which the current carried towards the north were beginning to drift past Tsalal .
__label__1	‘ If any drop of gloom were wanting in the overflowing cup , which is now “ commended ” ( in the language of an immortal Writer ) to the lips of the undersigned , it would be found in the fact , that a friendly acceptance granted to the undersigned , by the before-mentioned <NAME> , for the sum Of 23l 4s 9 1/2d is over due , and is <NAME> provided for .
__label__0	As yet they had not met with any of the aboriginal tribes living in the savage state .
__label__0	But having no taste for his father 's profession , he devoted himself to the sciences , and published a Treatise on the <NAME> , whilst he obtained a commission in the <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> , without pausing , laid his hand upon his shoulder , and laughingly and lightly went on : ‘ <NAME> , I don ’ t like to dispel your generous visions , and I would give any money ( if I had any ) , to live in such a rose-coloured mist .
__label__1	I trust he may not turn out -- well -- no matter -- my love to you , my dear , and long life to the baby ! ’ ‘ Your namesake , ’ said Mrs. <NAME> , with a sweet smile .
__label__1	‘ Who do you suppose will ever employ a professional man , when they see his boy playing at marbles in the gutter , or flying the garter in the horse-road ?
__label__1	A solitary window , gazed through years ago , looked out upon an ocean , miles and miles away ; upon its waters , fancies , busy with him only yesterday , were hushed and lulled to rest like broken waves .
__label__1	Her mother ’ s brother , gentlemen , failed for eight hundred pounds , as a law stationer. ’ ‘ Vell , ’ said <NAME> , who had grown rather restless during this discussion , ‘ vith regard to bis ’ ness. ’ The word was music to <NAME> ’ s ears .
__label__0	It would take about half an hour 's walking to get from one to the other .
__label__0	Save that it was in the month of February , the coldest of the whole year , and the ice was harder ; the travellers suffered terribly from the cold , but not from the wind or snow-storm .
__label__1	<NAME> at the birds , my pretty ! ’ ‘ Poor birds ! ’ said the child .
__label__1	‘ Are you always as busy as you are now ? ’ ‘ Busier .
__label__1	<NAME> continued to sit on the large stone , meditating upon what was best to be done , and revolving in his mind a plan for knocking at all the doors within five miles of <NAME> , taking them at a hundred and fifty or two hundred a day , and endeavouring to find <NAME> by that expedient , when accident all of a sudden threw in his way what he might have sat there for a twelvemonth and yet not found without it .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> ’ ee , <NAME> , ’ returned the <NAME> .
__label__0	`` I do not think he would , but he would not taste them . ''
__label__0	The aspect of the land is flat and monotonous , so that a journey of one or two miles will give as fair an impression of the country as a complete tour of the island .
__label__0	`` Well , we must go straight for him , '' said <NAME> ; `` it is dangerous , but what does it matter ?
__label__0	Only two yards remained to be raised from the surface .
__label__0	The wrists of the drummers were hung with bells and curiously-shaped pieces of iron , which jingled loudly as they were beating .
__label__0	Nothing of moment happened on the voyage ; the steamer , sustained on its large paddles , rolled but little , and the <NAME> almost justified its name .
__label__1	She is engaged to be married to a most worthy and deserving man in her own station of life .
__label__0	“ You will now readily understand , gentlemen , the apparatus that I have described to you is really a gas cylinder and blow-pipe for oxygen and hydrogen , the heat of which exceeds that of a forge fire .
__label__1	“ Lor ! ” I says , “ I ’ ll think of something else -- something comfortable -- and put it out of my head. ” So I thought of the new house and <NAME> , and was thinking at a great rate with that sheet there in my hand , when all of a sudden , the faces seemed to be hidden in among the folds of it and I let it drop. ’ As it still lay on the floor where it had fallen , Mr <NAME> picked it up and laid it on the chest .
__label__1	‘ May I ask , ’ he said , ‘ is this true about <NAME> ? ’ ‘ My dear doctor , ’ she returned , ‘ you ask me the very question that I was half disposed to ask you. ’ ‘ To ask me !
__label__1	‘ Dear Little Dorrit , it is not my imprisonment only that will soon be over .
__label__0	I can ’ t say. ” “ Why not ?
__label__1	As to a stocking , I didn ’ t know such a thing by name .
__label__1	You must be broken of it .
__label__1	If you dare to come here again unless you ’ re sent for , I ’ ll keep watch-dogs in the yard that ’ ll growl and bite -- I ’ ll have man-traps , cunningly altered and improved for catching women -- I ’ ll have spring guns , that shall explode when you tread upon the wires , and blow you into little pieces .
__label__1	People turned round and looked at him ; he made no gesture , caught nobody ’ s eye , let them pass away , and others come on and be succeeded by others , and took no notice .
__label__1	He bit his lip , frowned , laughed , and sat down in it , with a baffled , irresolute , impatient air , he was unable to conceal ; and biting his nail nervously , and looking at her sideways , with bitter discomfiture , even while he feigned to be amused by her caprice .
__label__1	There ’ s not a woman alive , that could tell me such a thing to my face -- to my own face. ’ <NAME> stroked his chin , as he said this , and glanced complacently at an opposite mirror .

__label__0	He reconnoitred the northern coast , and thence reached the shores of <NAME> , which <NAME> had announced his intention of visiting when he left <NAME> , and surveyed <NAME> .
__label__0	Content yourself with winding it up very , exactly , but do not touch the hands .
__label__0	The <NAME> was a vessel of one hundred and seventy tons , rigged as a brig , and carrying a screw and a steam-engine of one hundred and twenty horse-power .
__label__1	<NAME> , and thin , and pallid , he awoke at last from what seemed to have been a long and troubled dream .
__label__1	It is a pot of money. ” For it IS a pot , ’ said Mr Riderhood , with candour , ‘ and why deny it ? ’ ‘ Hear ! ’ from <NAME> as he touched his drawing .
__label__1	Never clapped eyes upon her ! ” “ Goodness , uncle !
__label__0	I returned to the saloon after having breakfast and set to work .
__label__1	Therefore <NAME> read the newspaper with profound attention and no comprehension , and therefore <NAME> said nothing whatever about <NAME> to himself , or admitted to himself that he was thinking about him , or would recognise in the most distant manner that <NAME> had anything to do with his feeling as lonely as <NAME> .
__label__0	There , hospitable as he was , like all the <NAME> of the old race , <NAME> lived with his daughter <NAME> , who after the death of her mother had taken charge of his household .
__label__1	When we were in our own room , and when she might perhaps have told me what I was so unprepared to hear , I gave her no encouragement to confide in me ; I never thought she stood in need of it .
__label__1	‘ What insupportable creature is this , coming in ? ’ said <NAME> , ‘ I can not hear it .
__label__0	It was an almost perpendicular ridge that ended in a regular wall rising abruptly in a straight line .
__label__0	I must say this for my uncle , that he stuck as close to me as possible .
__label__1	Is he ready to go ?
__label__1	He came round at the appointed time , took out his jackknife , and sat down to his meal .
__label__1	‘ Upon my soul , they ’ re perfect .
__label__0	Three miles to the south the dim outline of <NAME> was to be seen .
__label__1	He walked up one street , and down another , until exercise had abated the first passion of his grief ; and then the revulsion of feeling made him thirsty .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> as long as you have the opportunity . ''
__label__0	Soon the top of the sledge appeared , then the harnessed dogs , and then about thirty other animals , then great objects moving confusedly , and <NAME> leaping about with his head alternately rising and sinking in the frozen mist .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> 's words were , that she would live to bless us all for many years to come .
__label__1	Calls a house a rookery when there ’ s not a rook near it , and takes the birds on trust , because he sees the nests ! ’ ‘ Mr .
__label__0	But one thing _I_ know .
__label__0	<NAME> kept looking at the great trees , whose branches , waving in the wind , made them seem to her like giants gesticulating wildly .
__label__0	Matters remained thus until the third week of February .
__label__0	Beyond it we heard loud bellowings such as a troop of ruminants would produce .
__label__1	‘ How does she look now ? ’ ‘ Quite happy , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	Thus , they crossed the bridge , from the <NAME> to the Surrey shore , when the woman , apparently disappointed in her anxious scrutiny of the foot-passengers , turned back .
__label__1	<NAME> , after some villainous thinking and smiling , wrote , and read aloud , as follows : ‘ Wait answer .
__label__1	What is to become of us , if those shoes are not done to-night ? ” <NAME> , utterly lost !
__label__1	“ You and your yes , <NAME> , ” said <NAME> , taking a bite out of his bread-and-butter , and seeming to help it down with a large invisible oyster out of his saucer .
__label__1	In the waste-yard outside , the steam from the escape pipe , the litter of barrels and old iron , the shining heaps of coals , the ashes everywhere , were shrouded in a veil of mist and rain .
__label__1	‘ But nature will smile though priests may frown , and next day the sun shone brightly , and on the next , and the next again .
__label__0	By the death of <NAME> the number of the passengers was reduced to twelve .
__label__0	In their state of mind nothing appeared improbable .
__label__0	The rustling sound produced with every movement of the wearers of this singular ornament , increased by knocking against the cuirass or the buckler , with the addition of the tinkling of little bells , which also formed part of the warrior 's equipment , altogether made such a jumble of discordant sounds that we could not refrain from laughing .
__label__1	The engaging frankness with which he made this declaration really had a disinterested appearance and captivated my guardian , if not , for the moment , <NAME> too .
__label__1	I dreamt that it was this morning , and you and I had been talking as we have been this minute ; that I went upstairs , for the very purpose for which I am going now ; and that as I stretched out my hand to take <NAME> ’ s , and lead her down , the floor sunk with me , and after falling from such an indescribable and tremendous height as the imagination scarcely conceives , except in dreams , I alighted in a grave. ’ ‘ And you awoke , and found you were lying on your back , or with your head hanging over the bedside , or suffering some pain from indigestion ? ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	I begged <NAME> , in conclusion , to understand that my help must always be rendered without <NAME> 's knowledge or suspicion , and that there was no one else in the world with whom I could advise .
__label__1	I am not quite sure , because the wolf and you change forms .
__label__1	My <NAME> says she has been `` bored to death . ''
__label__0	The meal over , she offered me tea so pleasantly that I was quite puzzled whether to admire the dinner or my charming hostess the most .
__label__1	‘ To pursue HIS way in quiet ! ’ ‘ You will scarcely remain in my house , I presume , sir , against my will , ’ said <NAME> ; ‘ or you can scarcely hope to make an impression upon a man who closes his ears to all that you can say , and is firmly and resolutely determined not to hear you. ’ ‘ Mr .
__label__0	The exact length of the straits is 372 miles .
__label__0	At midday <NAME> disappeared from their view in the south ; it was the last sight these bold sailors were to have of <NAME> , and more than one gazed at it for a long time who was doubtless fated never to set eyes on it again .

__label__1	It was either you or the schoolmaster -- one of you , or the two between you -- that got the forged letter done ; remember that !

__label__0	“ Besides , it is very evident that the intention of the captain of this ship is to land , and , consequently , if not today , to-morrow at the latest , we shall make his acquaintance. ” “ Never mind ! ” said <NAME> .
__label__1	The way to <NAME> ’ s destination led them past the door , and they were going straight towards it .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ here ’ s Father !
__label__0	The engineer , revived by this rude shampooing , moved his arm slightly and began to breathe more regularly .
__label__0	Neither <NAME> nor the young <NAME> girl had any baggage .

__label__0	He must by this time have given me up !

__label__0	The sail was taken in , and everything made snug for a tedious period of inaction .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> , with clenched teeth and knitted brow , stood sternly , almost fiercely , regarding the boundless waste of water .

__label__1	Almost as she stopped , the two figures stopped ; and that one which to <NAME> ’ s thinking was like a distorted shadow of her mother , spoke to the other , earnestly , and with a pointing hand towards them .
__label__0	<NAME> , who had always particularly admired it , now hailed it as an old friend , and almost exhausted breath , imagination and vocabulary in the epithets with which he greeted this cynosure of the lunar mountains .
__label__1	And so _he_ goes up the postern stair .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> was very red and hot , for your outlaws are desperate fellows to shout .
__label__0	What voluptuousness to float amid this radiant ether , to bathe oneself in it , to wrap oneself in the sun 's pure rays .
__label__1	But it ’ s a dear good world , and I love it ! ’ ‘ It lies fair before you now , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	“ And , naturally , you made it ‘ radiant , ’ in the columns of the <NAME> Telegraph. ” “ Exactly. ” “ Do you remember , <NAME> , what occurred at <NAME> in 1812 ? ” “ I remember it as well as if I had been there , sir , ” replied the <NAME> correspondent .

__label__0	They found it still so swollen by the heavy rain that the water was a foot above the level .
__label__0	The lamps , fastened to long ropes , were lowered down the shaft , and it was thus ascertained that the four last ladders were wanting .
__label__1	I ’ ve found something. ’ ‘ What have you found ? ’ asked <NAME> , clutching him with both hands , so that they stood interlocked like a couple of preposterous gladiators .
__label__1	‘ And what have they made you sensible of ? ’ <NAME> ’ s play of eyes between the two holds good throughout the dialogue , to the end .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , ’ he said , with an impatient bite at the handkerchief in which his hand was wrapped , ‘ you had better take and fire a loaded gun at me. ’ ‘ But I love you , <NAME> , ’ cried Mrs. Heep .
__label__1	But , he was not far off , for presently she heard a troubled movement and a shouting coming along , which filled her with fear .
__label__0	A forest of firs , growing on the bank , had supplied the necessary materials ; the trunks , fastened together with osiers , made a platform on which a hundred people could have easily found room .
__label__0	He thought that an early examination of the southern coast of <NAME> , and of the northern coast of <NAME> , would be the most conducive to the interests of science .

__label__1	“ Wy ? ” says the patient , starting up in bed ; “ I ’ ve eat four crumpets , ev ’ ry night for fifteen year , on principle. ” “ Well , then , you ’ d better leave ‘ em off , on principle , ” says the doctor .
__label__1	If <NAME> thought , as she glanced at the mighty <NAME> , how agreeable it would be to have an hour ’ s gardening there , with a bright copper shovel , among the money , still she was not in an avaricious vein .
__label__1	In the midst of a great noise , occasioned by the prayers and entreaties of <NAME> , the cries and exclamations of the women , and the vehemence of the men , demonstrations were made of carrying off the lost son by violence .
__label__0	At last , impatient of further restraint , he burst out : `` Who the deuce cares for her secrets ?
__label__0	But the captain was out of hearing .
__label__0	By dint of a series of questions , he gained from the child a very intelligent account of her experiences .
__label__1	I heard the clocks strike twelve , and was still reading , without knowing what I read , when <NAME> touched me .
__label__1	‘ This good king had a queen , who eighteen years before , had had a son , who was called <NAME> .

__label__1	Do let us resolve ourselves into a <NAME> of the whole <NAME> !
__label__1	Mrs Meagles , the blithest and busiest of mothers , went about singing and cheering everybody ; but she , honest soul , had her flights into store rooms , where she would cry until her eyes were red , and would then come out , attributing that appearance to pickled onions and pepper , and singing clearer than ever .
__label__0	Wishing to escape all danger from this terrible weapon I made a desperate struggle , and the belt , which surrounded my waist and which had been hitched on a stone , gave way .
__label__1	At any rate , I made up my mind to be so dreadfully industrious that I would leave myself not a moment 's leisure to be low-spirited .
__label__0	May it not rather have been that King <NAME> was jealous of the fame of <NAME> , and did not wish to give him the opportunity of increasing his renown ?
__label__1	‘ The most extraordinary thing in the world , ’ said <NAME> , saluting both ladies with the utmost cordiality ; ‘ the most extraordinary thing .
__label__1	'It 's a simple question of identity , you will observe , ' said the doctor .
__label__1	‘ You ain ’ t got nothin ’ on your mind as makes you fret yourself , have you ? ’ inquired Sam .
__label__0	<NAME> was informed of its situation , and expressed his willingness to live there apart from his fellows .
__label__1	“ -- Had made some little stir in a certain part of the world where a good many people go , not always in gratification of their own inclinations , and not quite irrespective of the government expense -- ” In watching his face , I made quite a firework of the <NAME> 's sausage , and greatly discomposed both my own attention and <NAME> 's ; for which I apologized .
__label__1	These solemn words , which had been read at his father 's grave , arose in his mind as he went down the dark streets , among the heavy shadows , with the moon and the clouds sailing on high above him .
__label__0	But might not a time come when all their science would be at fault ?
__label__1	A noticeable relaxation of discipline had for some few days pervaded the <NAME> ’ House .
__label__1	The week passed away in a most delightful manner .
__label__1	He had slipped across the water in his first leisure , and had slipped as quickly back again for his farewell interview with <NAME> .
__label__0	This was the more singular , inasmuch as he could not be unaware that the <NAME> had put in at <NAME> d'Acunha before proceeding to the southern seas .
__label__1	He turned it over and over ; surveyed it with a contempt no language can express ; and inquired if I wished him to fix me a boot like _that_ ?
__label__0	`` Do you not understand , '' he replied , `` that this congelation of water will help us ?
__label__1	It is laborious , is it not ? ’ ‘ The labour is so pleasant , ’ she returned , ‘ that it is scarcely grateful in me to call it by that name. ’ ‘ Nothing good is difficult to you , ’ said I .
__label__1	Her name was Mrs. Markleham ; but our boys used to call her the <NAME> , on account of her generalship , and the skill with which she marshalled great forces of relations against the Doctor .

__label__1	Have you lately come to settle in this neighbourhood , or do you own to another neighbourhood ?
__label__1	‘ You couldn ’ t put it clearer , I am sure , ma ’ am. ’ As this was his usual hour for having a little confidential chat with Mrs. Sparsit , and as he had already caught her eye and seen that she was going to ask him something , he made a pretence of arranging the rulers , inkstands , and so forth , while that lady went on with her tea , glancing through the open window , down into the street .
__label__0	It was time ; the two enemies were gazing at one another .
__label__0	“ Oh for some wings , or else a balloon ! ” cried <NAME> , as he gazed around him ; and then , looking down to the rock upon which they were standing , he added , “ We seem to have been transplanted to a soil strange enough in its chemical character to bewilder the _savants_ at a museum. ” “ And do you observe , captain , ” asked the count , “ how the convexity of our little world curtails our view ?
__label__1	But , wonderful to add , it is very clean and bright , being nearly new ; and rattles through the streets of <NAME> gaily .
__label__1	After a moment ’ s hesitation , I answered ‘ No , ’ at hazard .
__label__0	The <NAME> fleet was defeated , and <NAME> had much difficulty in regaining the <NAME> coast in January , 1568 .

__label__0	In the first place , he must not travel as a courier of the Czar usually would .
__label__1	Well , I suppose it wants some years of sticking to , before you master it .
__label__0	It was there that <NAME> had agreed to meet his accomplices , and two days after gaining possession of the letter , he arrived at <NAME> .
__label__1	You ain ’ t so wery ‘ andsome that you can afford to throw avay many o ’ your good looks .
__label__1	As they were pretty certain of the road he must have taken , however , and kept on at a great pace , they came up with him , at the very moment when he had taken breath , and was breaking into a run again .
__label__0	It is so important , you know , so all important ; the difference of one half minute , you know , would so certainly mar the expectation of reunion with the earth -- ” And seeing a cloud gathering on <NAME> ’ s face , he added : “ I am sure <NAME> would be only too happy to render you any assistance in the revision. ” “ Sir , ” said the professor , bridling up , “ I want no assistant ; my calculations want no revision .
__label__0	In 1829 he reentered <NAME> by the western coast of the Gulf of <NAME> ; he then followed in the track of <NAME> and of <NAME> , recovered at Boussa the documents relative to the death of the former , and arrived on the 20th of August at <NAME> , where he was seized and held as a prisoner , until he expired in the arms of his faithful attendant <NAME> Lander. ” “ And what became of this Lander ? ” asked <NAME> , deeply interested .
__label__1	‘ As to what was found in the dust now .
__label__1	‘ I have been afraid to go near it ; for I am not often down in that part of the church , and do not know the ground. ’ ‘ Come down with me , ’ said the old man .
__label__0	They tarried a moment , then resumed their descent .

__label__1	My mother deferred to her very much -- more than usual , it occurred to me -- and we were all three excellent friends ; still we were different from what we used to be , and were not so comfortable among ourselves .
__label__1	‘ This is your pocket-book , ’ said <NAME> , producing one from his coat ; ‘ the certificates of your first marriage and of the boy ’ s birth , and your wife ’ s two letters , and every other paper that can support these statements directly or by implication , are here , are they ? ’ ‘ Every one of ‘ em , sir. ’ ‘ And you don ’ t object to their being looked at here , so that these people may be convinced of your power to substantiate your claim at once in law and reason , and you may resume your control over your own son without more delay .
__label__0	to teach them what war is , to inform them that we employ our time chiefly in devouring each other , in smashing arms and legs , and that too on a globe which is capable of supporting a hundred billions of inhabitants , and which actually does contain nearly two hundred millions ?
__label__1	I won her through a rash vow .
__label__0	One stole a sailor 's waistcoat , another put out his hand for the quarter-master 's cocked hat , but not knowing how to deal with it , pulled it towards him , instead of lifting it up , which gave the quarter-master an opportunity of interfering with his intention .
__label__1	To recount all the delight and wonder which the circumstances just detailed awakened at <NAME> ’ s , and all the things that were done , said , thought , expected , hoped , and prophesied in consequence , is beside the present course and purpose of these adventures .
__label__1	All through dinner , <NAME> combined her present appetite for eating and drinking with her past appetite for romantic love , in a way that made <NAME> afraid to lift his eyes from his plate ; since he could not look towards her without receiving some glance of mysterious meaning or warning , as if they were engaged in a plot .
__label__0	It is too bad that millions of horse-power should lie under our feet unavailable for our needs .
__label__1	The lips were parched , and cracked in many places ; the hard , dry skin glowed with a burning heat ; and there was an almost unearthly air of wild anxiety in the man ’ s face , indicating even more strongly the ravages of the disease .
__label__1	He was in the full heat and bustle of concluding these operations , when his uncle , <NAME> , accosted him .
__label__0	Opening a cupboard and taking out a bottle and a few glasses , he placed them on a tray .
__label__0	<NAME> to the Coast -- Troops of <NAME> -- A new River -- The Reason the <NAME> was not felt -- A woody Shore -- Reptile Promontory -- <NAME> envies <NAME> -- Explosion of <NAME> .
__label__1	His thoughts , not to be stopped or directed , still wandered where they would , and dragged him after them .
__label__0	He is brave ; he is sober ; he is safe ; he never makes a false step ; never glides or slips from his path .
__label__1	He had every reason given him to be so , but he was not ; and solely on his side , an estrangement began to arise between them .
__label__1	‘ And <NAME> said , when he came just now to see for letters -- but what signifies what he says ! ’ exclaimed <NAME> , reddening and breaking off .
__label__1	‘ She ought not to be alone here ; ought she , <NAME> ? ’ said <NAME> , anxiously .
__label__1	‘ So she wrote to me to say that if I ever felt myself hurt , ’ she looked down at her young mistress , ‘ or found myself worried , ’ she looked down at her again , ‘ I might go to her , and be considerately treated .
__label__1	Those fellows who were here one night .
__label__1	They were in three parties ; of whom the first , as the most numerous and important , was the slowest , and had been overtaken by one of the others on the way up .
__label__0	A little spluttering was heard and a tiny blue flame sprang up , making a choking smoke .
__label__1	What have you got to say to me ? ’ ‘ Bless you , <NAME> -- <NAME> , I mean -- a great many things , if you will come away somewhere , where we can talk comfortably .
__label__1	“ If I could buy the furniture now hired for me , ” said I , “ and one or two other little things , I should be quite at home there. ” “ Go it ! ” said <NAME> , with a short laugh .
__label__0	it is out of the question .
__label__1	‘ What ’ s a man made for ? ’ ‘ For nothing else ? ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	Of all our former collection of nautical and philosophical instruments , there remained only the chronometer and the compass .
__label__0	“ When shall we get away ? ” asked <NAME> .
__label__0	It was also less difficult to ventilate it , by means of canvas funnels which opened without .
__label__1	`` You copied some affidavits in that cause for me lately . ''
__label__1	But the last item was long , long , long , in linking itself to the rest .
__label__1	And yet <NAME> was not weeping upon the body , but was scolding violently upon her chair ; and all this amidst a clamour of tongues perfectly deafening , and which really appeared to have driven the unfortunate footman to the utmost verge of distraction .
__label__1	All the little changes that had crept in when the Heeps were there , were changed again .
__label__0	Between the <NAME> and <NAME> there is a distance of 2,900 miles , but with a good sea and favoring breeze , this was only a ten day ’ s voyage .
__label__1	‘ Your way lies there , sir , ’ said <NAME> , in a suppressed voice , that some devil might have owned with pride .
__label__0	But at the moment when <NAME> and the sailor were preparing to leave <NAME> , the vessel suddenly altered her course , and stood directly for <NAME> .
__label__0	They had never throughout this time been without fish , but they had suffered the cruelest tortures from thirst .
__label__0	And hatchet in hand , he was about to cleave the head of the animal , when <NAME> seized his arm , saying , -- `` Spare him , <NAME> . ''
__label__1	Some were fond of compounding this variety , and having it all on their plates at once .
__label__0	Give up just as we are on the verge of success ? ''
__label__1	Something to this general purpose I made out , but I was thrown into such a tumult of alarm , and hurry and distress , that in spite of every effort I could make to subdue my agitation , I did not seem , to myself , fully to recover my right mind until hours had passed .
__label__0	<NAME> arrived , and the enthusiasm showed no signs of diminution .
__label__0	The climate is very changeable ; in summer , storms are very frequent , many fall victims to the vivid lightning , and the wind is often so strong as even to blow over men on horseback : during the winter there is no rain , which all falls in the summer , and then scarcely enough to lay the dust , while the storms of hail are terrible ; during <NAME> 's residence in the country they were so severe that once 140 persons were drowned by the melting of the enormous mass of hail-stones that had fallen .
__label__0	But as the boat came nearer , her illusion was dispelled ; all hope forsook her , and she would have sunk in despair , but for the reassuring voice of <NAME> .
__label__0	Near this piece of furniture , I saw a chest bound with iron , on the cover of which was a copper plate , bearing the cypher of the <NAME> with its device .
__label__1	If you do , I can put her in the way of getting one .
__label__1	‘ Never read anything but letters and accounts .
__label__1	Mrs Sparkler , looking at herself in her mourning , was even tired of that view : though , naturally , not so tired of that as of the other two .
__label__1	I can not separate and define the feelings that arose in me after this ; it is enough that the vague duty and obligation I had felt upon me from the first of following the investigation was , without my distinctly daring to ask myself any question , increased , and that I was indignantly sure of there being no possibility of a reason for my being afraid .
__label__0	<NAME> ! ” <NAME> rushed toward him , and with the assistance of the Major , dragged him up again on the tree .
__label__0	The <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> visited the posts , strengthened by their orders .
__label__1	`` I wish , sir , '' said <NAME> , `` to leave a good name behind me .
__label__0	<NAME> soon saw there was nothing more to be got from his crew ; kindness and persuasion were fruitless ; he resolved to employ severity , and , if need be , to be pitiless ; he distrusted especially <NAME> , and even <NAME> , who , however , never dared to speak too loud .
__label__1	It was as true , ’ said <NAME> , nodding his nightcap , which was his only means of emphasis , ‘ as taxes is .
__label__0	The eloquent secretary of the <NAME> was no longer master of himself .
__label__0	said <NAME> , `` there is that unlucky land ! ''
__label__0	But my ear deceived me , for I found that I was not a hundred yards from the instrument .
__label__1	Never , never ! ’ One minute we are here ’ -- holding his tumbler before his eyes -- ‘ the next we are there ’ -- gulping down its contents , and striking himself emphatically a little below the chest -- ‘ in the silent tomb .
__label__1	But neither ever broached the theme .
__label__1	<NAME> clamps and girders , fire-proof from top to bottom ; mechanical lifts for the housemaids , with all their brushes and brooms ; everything that heart could desire .
__label__1	<NAME> , sir -- everybody knows <NAME> -- apples , cherries , hops , and women .
__label__1	He had reached the old house at last -- how hot the room was .
__label__0	He decided , therefore , to send a commissioner to the country , to whom he gave most extensive powers , and who , after having inquired into all that had taken place , should establish whatever form of government he thought most advisable .
__label__0	<NAME> and <NAME> rushed towards the jaguar .
__label__1	<NAME> and grind , fag and grind , turn the wheel , turn the wheel !
__label__1	‘ I have done no worse , I have not disgraced you .
__label__0	According to his observations , this meteorite will accomplish its revolution around the earth in three hours and twenty minutes , which implies a wonderful rate of speed . ''
__label__0	“ And what is her tonnage ? ” “ Two hundred and ten tons. ” “ I don ’ t think I am far out , ” continued <NAME> , “ in judging her speed at fifteen knots .
__label__1	‘ Why , they say , ’ returned his wife , ‘ that listeners never hear any good of themselves ; though you -- but pray how long have you been here , sir ? ’ ‘ This instant arrived , my own. ’ ‘ Then I may go on -- though if you had been here but a moment or two sooner , you would have heard your praises sounded by Georgiana. ’ ‘ Only , if they were to be called praises at all which I really don ’ t think they were , ’ explained <NAME> in a flutter , ‘ for being so devoted to Sophronia. ’ ‘ Sophronia ! ’ murmured <NAME> .
__label__1	He put on his hat and walked quickly down the garden , determined to investigate the matter to the very bottom .
__label__1	At sight of her child , Mrs. <NAME> started ; suddenly recollecting herself , she kissed him in a frantic manner ; then relapsing into a state of hysterical imbecility , the good lady requested to be informed where she was .
__label__1	It was because he grew so scared and trembling , and because he felt himself to be a poor , weak , ignorant , helpless man ( those used to be his words ) , that he wanted me so much to know a great deal , and be different from him .
__label__1	‘ Anybody else , <NAME> ? ’ he said , without looking up , and turning over the leaves .
__label__1	As his lineaments soften with life , their faces and their hearts harden to him .
__label__0	It is obvious that it was most unlikely that a number such as 76223 was the key of the document , and it produced no other result than to bring to the lips of <NAME> such a vigorous ejaculation that <NAME> disappeared like a shot !
__label__0	It received the name of <NAME> , in honour of <NAME> , <NAME> of the <NAME> .
__label__0	I was unable to move either way , and was doomed to a terrible and horrible death , that of starvation .
__label__1	I was smoking , and trying to suppress a rising tendency to shudder .
__label__1	‘ These two gentlemen have ordered supper in an hour ’ s time , ’ she said , taking her into the bar ; ‘ and your best plan will be to sup with them .
__label__1	She said them slightingly , but not with displeasure .
__label__1	For , sailors to be got the better of , were essential to <NAME> ’ s <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ And thank this gentleman , ’ interposed the old man , ‘ but for whose care I might have lost my little girl to-night. ’ ‘ No , no , master , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ that won ’ t do , that won ’ t. ’ ‘ What do you mean ? ’ cried the old man .
__label__1	Mr Toots generally said again , after a long interval of staring and hard breathing , ‘ How are you ? ’ To which <NAME> again replied , ‘ Quite well , <NAME> , thank you. ’ One evening Mr <NAME> was sitting at his desk , oppressed by correspondence , when a great purpose seemed to flash upon him .
__label__0	`` But till that time we must be very watchful , '' said <NAME> .
__label__1	The surprise of <NAME> at this summary proceeding , great as it was , was immeasurably exceeded by the astonishment of the doctor .
__label__1	‘ Then the sooner you go the better. ’ With these instructions , <NAME> placed a sum of money in the hands of his faithful servitor , and ordered him to start for <NAME> immediately , in pursuit of the fugitive .
__label__0	It could not well be otherwise .
__label__1	To the very last ( feeble action of liver ) , she addressed me in the same unfinished terms. ’ <NAME> has closed his eyes as the auctioneer has deepened his voice .
__label__0	Yes , yes ; I can swear to it !
__label__1	Now , considered as an abstract circumstance , there was no more obvious cause or reason why <NAME> should take the trouble of muffling this particular knocker , than there would have been for his muffling the knocker of any nobleman or gentleman resident ten miles off ; because , for the greater convenience of the numerous lodgers , the street-door always stood wide open , and the knocker was never used at all .
__label__0	Naturally , at the short distance of four or five paces , every shot killed an <NAME> ; but there was no time to re-load .
__label__1	I would sooner be put back again upon that piece of wreck , on which I have so often floated , since my preservation , in my dreams , and there left to drift , and drive , and die ! ’ ‘ Hooroar , my lad ! ’ exclaimed the <NAME> , in a burst of uncontrollable satisfaction .
__label__1	‘ They are very like their mamma , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , majestically .
__label__1	‘ “ Was it a large one ? ” inquired <NAME> .
__label__0	`` And here shall I sleep the sleep of eternity , if -- '' replied the captain .
__label__1	‘ And so I told her , both last night and today. ’ ‘ You told her truth , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ and did well to do so ; though I must say , at the same time , that if I had a daughter , and my freedom , pleasure , nay , my very health and life , depended on her taking a husband whom I pointed out , I should hope it would not be necessary to advance any other arguments to induce her to consent to my wishes. ’ <NAME> looked at <NAME> as if to see whether he spoke in earnest , and having nodded twice or thrice in unqualified assent to what had fallen from him , said : ‘ I must go upstairs for a few minutes , to finish dressing .
__label__1	‘ Well , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ what do you think ? ’ ‘ Oh , <NAME> , ’ said Mrs. <NAME> , trembling with agitation , ‘ you ’ re very kind , sir. ’ ‘ It ’ ll save you a good deal of trouble , won ’ t it ? ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	The torches were held over the opening : nothing could be seen .
__label__1	At breakfast-time my sister declared her intention of going to town with us , and being left at <NAME> 's and called for “ when we had done with our fine ladies ” -- a way of putting the case , from which <NAME> appeared inclined to augur the worst .
__label__1	That time passed , and her little Lucie lay on her bosom .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , ’ replied the unwelcome visitor .
__label__0	`` <NAME> is talking about the flesh of the bear , '' said <NAME> , `` but his grease is more useful than his flesh or his fur . ''
__label__1	Still , the average duration of human life is proved to have increased of late years .
__label__1	Make up the fires , and buy another coal-scuttle before you dot another i , <NAME> ! ''
__label__0	During this time they partook of some refreshment , and then they returned to their task .
__label__1	<NAME> little <NAME> put a forefinger into each of her ears when these rumours began to circulate , and retired into a corner , beseeching not to be told any more ; but <NAME> , begging permission of <NAME> to go and speak with her brother , and pretty plainly showing that she would take it if it were not given , struck out the more definite course of going to <NAME> ’ s for accurate intelligence .
__label__0	They stretched out their hands , and alternately struck their feet against the ground with frantic contortions .
__label__0	And so Mrs. <NAME> had access to the gaol .
__label__1	Nor had she any symptoms of declining , in the course of the ensuing week , when the constitutional viands still continued to disappear in regular succession , notwithstanding that <NAME> studied her as attentively as ever , and occupied his usual seat between the black skirts and the fender , with unwavering constancy .
__label__1	<NAME> times , ’ said <NAME> , thrice throwing out his left hand with all its fingers spread , and doing it so rapidly that the sense of sight could hardly follow the action , ‘ I ask of him in every place where go the foreigners ; and fifteen times , ’ repeating the same swift performance , ‘ they know nothing .
__label__0	The <NAME> of <NAME> , the ruler of a good many of these petty principalities , and who takes the title of <NAME> of the <NAME> , was remarkable for a complete disregard of cleanliness , a peculiarity in which , according to <NAME> , his court fully equalled him .
__label__0	With his natural buoyancy of spirits , he began to hope again .
__label__1	<NAME> was truly repentant , and would not say another syllable .
__label__1	‘ Well , <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> , thrusting his head out of the window .
__label__0	And then , what a view to reward us for our troubles and dangers !
__label__1	Then came the tea and coffee ; and then , the ball .
__label__1	‘ He ’ s shocked at the way your father goes on in , ’ replied Mrs. Weller .
__label__1	‘ That you should -- ha -- at this early hour , bestow any of your priceless time upon me , is -- ha -- a compliment that I acknowledge with the greatest esteem. ’ Mr Dorrit positively trembled in addressing the great man .
__label__1	We alighted in a pleasant wood towards the middle of the day , dined on a fallen tree , and leaving our best fragments with a cottager , and our worst with the pigs ( who swarm in this part of the country like grains of sand on the sea-shore , to the great comfort of our commissariat in <NAME> ) , we went forward again , gaily .
__label__1	‘ -- ‘ <NAME> , ain ’ t ? ’ With a stupid stare .
__label__1	There ’ s the <NAME> establishment , and there ’ s your mother ’ s <NAME> .
__label__1	I quickened my pace , and , passing among them , wondering at their looks , went hurriedly in .
__label__0	The curtains are made of reindeer-skins , sewn into the shape of a bell .
__label__1	Who takes the smallest notice of me ?
__label__1	When he had achieved this rush of vivacity and condescension , his <NAME> composed himself into the picture after <NAME> , and made a third cow in the group .
__label__0	`` Well , then , that probability will be enough for me , and since you offer me your services , get <NAME> to accept me as a passenger . ''
__label__1	He had been high with Mr Rugg , and had threatened to employ some one else .
__label__1	`` So I tell him honourably ( you are to know I have written to him about all this ) that we are at issue and that we had better be at issue openly than covertly .
__label__1	If our observant lady readers can deduce any satisfactory inferences from these facts , we beg them by all means to do so .
__label__1	And you ain ’ t gone , ain ’ t you ?
__label__1	If I was to tell you how I found out this word , you ’ d believe that .
__label__1	But <NAME> couldn ’ t get happily out of it .
__label__1	The above reward will be paid to any person who will give such information as will lead to the discovery of the said <NAME> , or tend to throw any light upon his previous history , in which the advertiser is , for many reasons , warmly interested . '
__label__1	Also , there were two double-bedded rooms , -- “ such as they were , ” the landlord said .
__label__1	The ole garden is open to you , and your airy pinions carry you through it .
__label__1	‘ My sister , you see , she ’ s that fond of you and yourn , and that accustomed to think on ’ y of her own country , that it wouldn ’ t be hardly fair to let her go .
__label__1	But <NAME> ’ s aunts soon agreed to regard my aunt as an eccentric and somewhat masculine lady , with a strong understanding ; and although my aunt occasionally ruffled the feathers of <NAME> ’ s aunts , by expressing heretical opinions on various points of ceremony , she loved me too well not to sacrifice some of her little peculiarities to the general harmony .
__label__0	To such a bargain the <NAME> officer was unwilling to agree without the consent of his commander ; so he begged the <NAME> captain to sail for <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> , hope , and charity , shared his whole nature among them .
__label__1	One sunny afternoon when I had come home from school with my books and portfolio , watching my long shadow at my side , and as I was gliding upstairs to my room as usual , my godmother looked out of the parlour-door and called me back .
__label__1	He has had a fever .
__label__0	The moment had arrived , but my travelling companions did not appear .
__label__0	Who can say the cause , the reason , the motive force of these cataclysms ? ''
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> , thus mutely appealed to ; and possibly feeling his personal pride and influence interested in the immediate reduction of <NAME> to reason ; gave utterance to about a couple of score of curses and threats , the rapid production of which reflected great credit on the fertility of his invention .
__label__1	`` So you kept him after all ? ''
__label__0	“ Pray , gentlemen , do not interrupt me , ” said the professor , authoritatively , as if _ex cathedra_ .
__label__1	I held him back with both arms ; and implored the men with whom I had been speaking , not to listen to him , not to do murder , not to let him stir from off that sand !
__label__1	‘ Having so much influence with you , <NAME> , as I have , perhaps I should have done better to have had a little chat with you in the first instance , before Mr Headstone spoke for himself .
__label__1	'Master of the workhouse , young man ! '
__label__1	There is something melancholy in it , and I don ’ t know why .
__label__1	‘ You have heard something , I des-say , of a change in my expectations , <NAME> , -- I should say , <NAME> ? ’ observed <NAME> .
__label__0	“ Let us get across first , and we shall soon find out the road to <NAME> on the other side of the river. ” “ To work , then , ” said <NAME> , beginning to empty the bottles .
__label__1	It had a black canal in it , and a river that ran purple with ill-smelling dye , and vast piles of building full of windows where there was a rattling and a trembling all day long , and where the piston of the steam-engine worked monotonously up and down , like the head of an elephant in a state of melancholy madness .
__label__1	And now , in this night-watch , mingling with the flow of the river and with the rush of the train , came the questions into <NAME> ’ s mind again : What could be in the depths of that mystery of <NAME> ’ s ?
__label__0	The <NAME> , upon which <NAME> 's fleet sailed , scarcely answered to the idea such a reminiscence inspires .
__label__0	But his daughter <NAME> , standing on the threshold of the door , had heard all .
__label__0	Five hundred feet only separated the explorers from the plateau , which they wished to reach so as to establish there an encampment for the night , but these five hundred feet were increased to more than two miles by the zigzags which they had to describe .
__label__0	The <NAME> in the <NAME> Telegraph. -- War between the <NAME> Journals. -- Mr .
__label__0	And , now , what is the extent of what we have seen ourselves ?
__label__1	‘ However , I have made up my mind that I will become respectable in the scale of society , and that I will not be dragged down by others .
__label__1	Meanwhile , <NAME> walked to and fro in his little back-office , troubled in mind by what had just occurred .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , my life , ’ said <NAME> , touching her cheek , with a grave smile , as she cast down her eyes and pouted again ; ‘ look at me .
__label__1	Mrs Wickam shaking her head , and letting fall several tears , pointed out the little group to <NAME> , and turned her eyes up to the ceiling .
__label__1	That 's all to be said at present .
__label__0	Is this Miss -- ” “ Yes , <NAME> , ” said <NAME> ; “ this is <NAME> and her brother , the two children condemned to orphanage by the cruel <NAME> ! ” “ Oh !
__label__0	There was not a living being left to tell the tale .
__label__0	The loss of the other face they could have easily borne -- with most of its details they had been already familiar .
__label__0	<NAME> numbered 1981 in 1750 .
__label__1	The <NAME> of <NAME> which has led to these remarks , is not walled , like other prisons , but is palisaded round about with tall rough stakes , something after the manner of an enclosure for keeping elephants in , as we see it represented in <NAME> prints and pictures .
__label__0	<NAME> and <NAME> ’ s interest was , therefore , contrary to that of <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Not if you are ready , <NAME> , my dear. ’ ‘ Well ! ’ exclaimed <NAME> , delighted .
__label__1	“ Yes , ” returned <NAME> , “ and you may suppose how mild it makes his gout .
__label__0	`` An idea which has just occurred to me -- '' `` An idea , '' said <NAME> ; `` one of your ideas !
__label__0	We saw fire across the forests several times , very far from the shore , and concluded that the country was well populated . ''
__label__0	The casting was to take place at twelve o'clock precisely .
__label__0	To facilitate the sale it has been decided that the biddings for this extensive region shall be made per square mile .
__label__0	This was accordingly done , and fortune favored the chief officer , <NAME> , <NAME> , a strong , jovial young fellow , and <NAME> , so good a boxer that he might have entered the lists with <NAME> himself .
__label__1	You are in a counting-house , you know , and you look about you. ” It struck me as a singular implication that you could n't be out of a counting-house , you know , and look about you ; but I silently deferred to his experience .
__label__1	'What do you mean by lagging and a lifer ? '
__label__0	There was nothing disagreeable in their features , and their eyes struck us as beautiful , so did their teeth , but they were very dirty .
__label__0	On the 24th January the two vessels started for the <NAME> , and stopped for a short time off <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> .
__label__1	In which a <NAME> is holden 13 .
__label__0	No incident marked the voyage to <NAME> .
__label__0	I must know first , through which countries the thirty-seventh parallel of southern latitude passes ? ” “ That ’ s <NAME> ’ s business ; he will tell you that , ” said <NAME> .
__label__1	But I , though a common dog , so struck at him as to make him draw .
__label__0	No other coast but the western coast of <NAME> could possibly , we thought , have been the scene of the shipwreck .
__label__1	‘ You mustn ’ t expect , ’ Mr <NAME> pursued , ‘ that I ’ m a-going to settle money on you , if you leave us like this , because I am not .
__label__1	Many accounts and account-books , many files of correspondence , and several strong boxes , garnished <NAME> ’ s room .
__label__1	Here , too , he read of men who , lying in their beds at dead of night , had been tempted ( so they said ) and led on , by their own bad thoughts , to such dreadful bloodshed as it made the flesh creep , and the limbs quail , to think of .
__label__1	Now this watch was a special favourite with <NAME> , having been carried about , beneath the shadow of his waistcoat , for a greater number of years than we feel called upon to state at present .
__label__0	It was the hand of <NAME> .
__label__1	Never let me hear him mentioned as a brother more ! ’ ‘ Dear <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , when they were left alone , and had remained silent for some few moments .
__label__0	The object grew rapidly as it approached them , and by an optical illusion the projectile seemed to be throwing itself before it .
__label__1	But , it was only the pleasanter to turn to <NAME> and to <NAME> , whose great forbearance shone more brightly than before , if that could be , contrasted with this brazen pretender .
__label__1	The nephew looked at him , in vain , in passing on to the door .
__label__0	And <NAME> gave one more despairing cry .
__label__0	He succeeded in stopping the hemorrhage .
__label__1	‘ I have done nothing to found any very strong claim upon your eloquence , I am sure. ’ ‘ He might have been burnt to death , if it hadn ’ t been for you , sir , ’ simpered <NAME> .
__label__1	During our long absence , it has suffered much from internal dissentions ; and the withdrawal of my name , coupled with this and other circumstances , has occasioned its dissolution .
__label__0	“ Your name ? ” asked the <NAME> , before giving the order for his brains to be blown out .
__label__0	The brig was lying right over on her side , for her masts being broken , pressed down by the weight of the ballast displaced by the shock , the keel was visible along her whole length .
__label__0	But his aim had been accurate , and his bullet had hit its mark ; before the arrival of his friends he had plunged his knife into the beast 's throat , and it fell , never to rise .
__label__1	My brother was a thoughtless , inconsiderate man , Mrs. Nickleby , and nobody , I am sure , can have better reason to feel that , than you. ’ This appeal set the widow upon thinking that perhaps she might have made a more successful venture with her one thousand pounds , and then she began to reflect what a comfortable sum it would have been just then ; which dismal thoughts made her tears flow faster , and in the excess of these griefs she ( being a well-meaning woman enough , but weak withal ) fell first to deploring her hard fate , and then to remarking , with many sobs , that to be sure she had been a slave to poor <NAME> , and had often told him she might have married better ( as indeed she had , very often ) , and that she never knew in his lifetime how the money went , but that if he had confided in her they might all have been better off that day ; with other bitter recollections common to most married ladies , either during their coverture , or afterwards , or at both periods .
__label__0	`` With a little earth spread on our aluminum planet we should have green peas in twenty-four hours .
__label__0	While these cares kept <NAME> far from his capital , small bodies of troops , sent in different directions , penetrated into the most distant provinces of the empire , with the object of extinguishing the last smouldering embers of resistance ; so many of the soldiers were employed in this way , that there remained in <NAME> itself but a very small body of troops .
__label__1	See if <NAME> is in the lodge , and beg him to come to me. ’ All the guests were now in consternation , and everybody rose .
__label__0	His powder-case , his cartridge-pouch , his lead , and his bullets , did not exceed a certain weight prescribed by the doctor .
__label__0	It took a whole day to put all these matters in order .
__label__1	Or `` One stone terrace ( cracked ) , one gondola in distance , one <NAME> senator 's dress complete , richly embroidered white satin costume with profile portrait of <NAME> Jogg the model , one Scimitar superbly mounted in gold with jewelled handle , elaborate <NAME> dress ( very rare ) , and <NAME> . ''
__label__1	Well , all I can say is , <NAME> , that I quite love the poor girl ; and that if she was twice as indifferent-looking , and twice as awkward as she is , I should be only so much the more her friend , and that ’ s the truth of it. ’ In fact , <NAME> had conceived an incipient affection for <NAME> , after witnessing her failure that morning , and this short conversation with her superior increased the favourable prepossession to a most surprising extent ; which was the more remarkable , as when she first scanned that young lady ’ s face and figure , she had entertained certain inward misgivings that they would never agree .
__label__0	The large ones , which are a very great trouble to build , and which are kept in sheds constructed specially for them , are twenty-six feet long , two and a half wide , and four deep .
__label__0	Previously , to sail from <NAME> to <NAME> by an eastward course would have involved the passage of the <NAME> , the <NAME> , the <NAME> , the <NAME> , the <NAME> ; but what had happened now ?
__label__0	But a few flashes backwards and forwards over the wires soon settled that point .
__label__0	A quarter of an hour after quitting the gasworks , <NAME> said softly to <NAME> , `` An amiable man , <NAME> !
__label__1	I have never had any such thing. ” In another moment we were in the brewery , so long disused , and she pointed to the high gallery where I had seen her going out on that same first day , and told me she remembered to have been up there , and to have seen me standing scared below .
__label__0	The boards of this prison were concealed under a thick mat , which deadened the noise of the feet .
__label__1	It would seem a simple matter to decide on these precautions ; but in my dazed , not to say distracted , state , it took so long , that I did not get out to further them until two or three in the afternoon .
__label__1	‘ You are from <NAME> , sir , are you .
__label__1	I am in want of nothing .
__label__0	He was on his feet in an instant .
__label__1	It ’ s a name , <NAME> , ’ said the Major firmly , as if he defied Mr Dombey to contradict him , and would feel it his painful duty to bully him if he did , ‘ that is known and honoured in the <NAME> possessions abroad .
__label__0	There seemed every prospect of the ships being imprisoned for many weeks , `` hemmed in , '' to use the expression of whalers , if indeed they did not run the risk of being crushed at once .
__label__1	<NAME> , she even went so far as to hint , obscurely , at an attachment entertained for her daughter by the son of an old neighbour of theirs , one <NAME> ( a young gentleman who might have been , at that time , four years old , or thereabouts ) , and to represent it , indeed , as almost a settled thing between the families -- only waiting for her daughter ’ s final decision , to come off with the sanction of the church , and to the unspeakable happiness and content of all parties .
__label__1	Their tops are battered , and broken , and blackened with smoke ; and , here and there , some taller stack than the rest , inclining heavily to one side , and toppling over the roof , seems to meditate taking revenge for half a century ’ s neglect , by crushing the inhabitants of the garrets beneath .
__label__1	‘ I do not pretend. ’ ‘ Oh !
__label__1	Never mind , <NAME> , never mind ! ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	The explorers question whether , by a strange chance , they had not been transported into some ancient mine , of the existence of which even the oldest miners in the county had ever known .
__label__0	A profound darkness ensued , which favored his flight .
__label__1	<NAME> crowding reflections , increasing the distress and fear I always felt when the name was mentioned , made me so agitated that I could scarcely hold my place at the table .
__label__1	The child who had been her little friend came there , almost as soon as it was day , with an offering of dried flowers which he begged them to lay upon her breast .
__label__0	The temperature was not so low as during the preceding winter , and its maximum did not exceed eight degrees Fahrenheit .
__label__1	He had his hands behind him under the skirts of his riding-coat , and he stood at <NAME> 's elbow as negligently as he might have stood at the <NAME> itself .
__label__0	It was , therefore , judged best to send a fresh despatch , requiring an immediate reply .
__label__1	I can not read what I have written with this gaunt hand .
__label__0	The <NAME> was then within sight of <NAME> !
__label__1	He lounged along moodily , and stopped at <NAME> to look about him , with as little interest in the crowd as any man might take , and was lounging on again , when a most unexpected object caught his eyes .
__label__0	In fact , these projectiles knocked his best metal plate to shivers .
__label__0	I remember it as if it were yesterday .
__label__1	What will they think of us !
__label__0	They had manufactured a great number of snares , into which fell numbers of blue foxes , the valuable fur of which served as a protection against cold , while their flesh enabled the sailors to economize their provisions .
__label__1	As he looked at the fire , I thought I saw a cunning expression , followed by a half-laugh , come into his face .
__label__0	About eleven o ’ clock lightning began to blaze continuously in the sky .
__label__1	`` As often as I can , '' said <NAME> , opening her eyes and smiling , `` because of earning sixpences and shillings ! ''
__label__1	I had seen tears in her eyes when I had brought new honours home from school , and I had seen them there when we last spoke about her father , and I had seen her turn her gentle head aside when we took leave of one another ; but I had never seen her grieve like this .
__label__1	Such an ugly villain too ! ” said <NAME> .
__label__1	I hope that contents you. ’ ‘ Upon your soul ? ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ You need not leave this place , sir , for it will be relieved of my presence in one minute , and it will be long , very long , before I darken these doors again. ’ ‘ Nicholas , ’ cried <NAME> , throwing herself on her brother ’ s shoulder , ‘ do not say so .
__label__1	Unfortunately , the property of <NAME> was settled upon herself .
__label__1	The recollection of all the wrongs he had sustained at <NAME> ’ s hands , had crowded on <NAME> ’ s mind , the moment <NAME> began to speak ; it wanted but a feather to turn the scale , and ‘ old Fireworks ’ did it .
__label__1	On the preceding occasion , one or two of the Bleeding Heart Yarders had obsequiously picked it up and handed it to its owner ; but Mr <NAME> had now so far impressed his audience , that the <NAME> had to turn and stoop for it himself .
__label__1	‘ I am not complaining , ’ he returned , ‘ I am only stating the case .
__label__0	When he had been borne home , <NAME> lay upon his bed utterly crushed .
__label__0	When the welcome word resounded on board the <NAME> on the 17th January , 1828 -- ( a day full of incidents according to <NAME> 's diary ) -- it was succeeded by `` <NAME> on the starboard bow ! ''
__label__0	He could never stop still in one place , and relieved himself with impetuous words and a superabundance of gesticulations .
__label__1	Observe the blood which is trickling from her finger ; also the gold-eyed needle of the period , with which she is at work. ’ All this , <NAME> repeated twice or thrice : pointing to the finger and the needle at the right times : and then passed on to the next .
__label__0	“ He is an intelligent , intrepid man , ” he added , “ whose passions have led him astray .
__label__1	‘ Why , no considerable change has taken place in the state of my system , since I see you cocked up behind your governor ’ s chair in the parlour , a little vile ago , ’ replied <NAME> .
__label__0	Fortunately the <NAME> or <NAME> priests interfered in their favour , and some of their property was restored to them , but the best part had gone to the bottom of the river with <NAME> 's canoe .
__label__0	I can see the zigzags after a rapid dart strike the arched roof of this mightiest of mighty vaults .
__label__1	The place through which he made his way at leisure was one of those receptacles for old and curious things which seem to crouch in odd corners of this town and to hide their musty treasures from the public eye in jealousy and distrust .
__label__1	'Not a bit of it , ' replied <NAME> .
__label__1	The wind has been and blown the door to , and I can ’ t get in. ’ ‘ Hah ! ’ said the gentleman , who took that very coolly .
__label__1	Perhaps you will sleep in your own room ?
__label__1	<NAME> , he believed that <NAME> had no particular pair of shoes .
__label__1	‘ They ’ ve got all the lot , <NAME> !
__label__1	That falteringly taken , he would glance at his brother not unadmiringly , put his hands behind him , and shuffle on so at his side until he took another pinch , or stood still to look about him -- perchance suddenly missing his clarionet .
__label__1	Besides , <NAME> , I 'm here , because I 've meant it by you , years and years .
__label__1	If you ’ ll believe me I ’ ve found that fellow , in the commonest little matters of the office that have been trusted to him , blurting out the truth , though expressly cautioned .
__label__1	His eyes were on <NAME> for an instant , and then looked at the ground as he addressed the master of the house .
__label__0	One explorer succeeded another , posts were established , and the country was opened to all comers .
__label__1	The varying illusions they present to the unaccustomed eye as it grows dark , are quite astonishing in their number and reality .
__label__1	Perhaps her mind had not got quite so far as the ceremony yet , but was lagging on the way there .
__label__0	But to the increasing surprise of <NAME> , they did not come across even the shadow of an <NAME> .
__label__1	I was so conscious of having passed through scenes of which they could have no knowledge , and of having acquired experiences foreign to my age , appearance , and condition as one of them , that I half believed it was an imposture to come there as an ordinary little schoolboy .
__label__1	‘ Say out what you have to say .
__label__0	<NAME> was there , and gave the benefit of his experience .
__label__0	Arriving at <NAME> from <NAME> , she had left part of her cargo at <NAME> , and thereafter -- in <NAME> , 1827 -- had set sail for <NAME> , where she had remained for a month .
__label__0	<NAME> to their meli-melonite their shell will describe the half of a hyperbola and never come back to beg pardon for having given that kick to the terrestrial ball ! ” And <NAME> threw his arms about like the semaphore at <NAME> , at the risk of breaking everything within a radius of six feet of him .
__label__0	That reminds me that , thirty years ago , <NAME> , going to seek the <NAME> Passage -- '' `` Commanded the <NAME> , '' said the doctor , quickly , `` a brig of about the tonnage of this one , and also carrying machinery . ''
__label__0	`` But the inhabitants of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , _ or <NAME> , if they bear the same proportion to their planet that we do ours , must certainly be regular Brobdignagians . ''
__label__1	Though <NAME> was not at that time aware of it , the class of gentlemen before alluded to , proceed on just the same principle in all their transactions .
__label__0	It was an opportunity for him to talk , and for me to hear , that old language of <NAME> , which is still in use in some <NAME> provinces .
__label__0	Gama at the same time was assured that in pursuing the line of the coast , he would find numerous cities ; `` Whereat we were so joyful , '' says <NAME> in his naïve and valuable narrative , `` that we wept for pleasure , praying God to grant us health that we might see all that which we had so much desired . ''
__label__1	It is not flattering to my self-love , but I am afraid you did. ’ ‘ How could you be so cruel ? ’ ‘ O Mr Wrayburn , ’ she answered , suddenly breaking into tears , ‘ is the cruelty on my side !
__label__1	There was plenty of width for that , and room to spare ; which is perhaps the reason why <NAME> thought he saw a locomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom .
__label__1	Both she and her brother , as they walked all together through the ancient streets , took great delight in what he pointed out of the <NAME> and the <NAME> ruin , and wondered—so his notes ran on—much as if they were beautiful barbaric captives brought from some wild tropical dominion .
__label__1	But , in an instant consciousness was gone again , and no spirit of <NAME> was in <NAME> ’ s crushed outer form .
__label__1	If you make a fool of me again , I 'll soon cure you , I warrant you ! '
__label__1	‘ I ’ m sure I heard you say as much , my dear , ’ retorted <NAME> in his cold sarcastic manner .
__label__0	“ We have , ” he said , “ neither investigated the northern shore from the site of <NAME> Antibes to the strait that brought us to <NAME> , nor have we followed the southern shore that stretches from the strait to the Gulf of <NAME> .
__label__1	`` Why , I must get a lodging of some sort , '' said <NAME> , pondering .
__label__0	As <NAME> had observed great stormy clouds formed a lowering and heavy vault , preventing any star rays .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> ’ s , up <NAME> way ? ’ Mr Wegg admits that he is bound for that port .
__label__0	Before starting , the doctor had prudently renewed his stock of water , having feared that he should not be able to touch ground in these regions , infested as they are by the Aouelim-Minian Touaregs .
__label__1	‘ And a little bit o ’ cold beef , ’ said the second coachman .
__label__1	And I don ’ t wonder at it , or complain of it , for I am sensible that I must be in the way , though I try to keep out of it as well as I can .
__label__0	At noon , the doctor , upon consulting his map , calculated that they were passing over the Uzaramo* country .
__label__0	<NAME> hallucinations took possession of her .
__label__1	‘ My mama departed this life , ’ said Mrs. Micawber , ‘ before <NAME> ’ s difficulties commenced , or at least before they became pressing .
__label__0	The way in which he got admission to this exclusive club was simple enough .
__label__1	This desperate threat effectually broke up the party .
__label__0	After coasting along the <NAME> shores as far as 52 degrees , <NAME> set out for <NAME> , which he reached on the 15th of September .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , what on earth -- do nothing for three or four weeks ! ’ ‘ It is a long time , ma ’ am , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> training is always desirable , whether the race be for place , cup , or sweepstakes . '
__label__0	ten-millionths of an inch in width ! ''
__label__1	“ You ! ” He appeared disposed to add more , but indignation choked his utterance , so he lifted up one of his very pliable legs , and , flourishing it above his head a little , to insure his aim , administered a good sound kick to <NAME> ; immediately after which , all the goblins in waiting crowded round the wretched sexton , and kicked him without mercy , according to the established and invariable custom of courtiers upon earth , who kick whom royalty kicks , and hug whom royalty hugs .
__label__0	“ Delighted. ” “ And so am I .
__label__0	He found it would be no easy task to leave it , and that in any case he must give up the idea of prosecuting his exploration ; he says , -- `` On the 11th of December , 1795 , ( after a delay of three months ) I accompanied the chatib ( one of the principal officers of the country ) to the monarch 's presence .
__label__0	Presently one of the passengers , after vigorously pushing his way through the importunate crowd of porters , came up to him and politely asked if he could point out the <NAME> consulate , at the same time showing a passport which he wished to have visaed .
__label__1	I have cast up the years of her age , year after year .
__label__0	She clung to her father with a frightened motion .
__label__0	In the evening they arrived alongside a narrow island , called <NAME> , from the name of the river which here comes in from the north-northwest , and mingles its waters with those of the <NAME> through a mouth about eight hundred yards across , after having watered the territories of the <NAME> and <NAME> .
__label__1	He is a child , you know ! ''
__label__1	To hear him ! ” cried my sister , with a clap of her hands and a scream together , -- which was her next stage .
__label__1	Here , too , the bride ’ s trustee ; an oilcake-fed style of business-gentleman with mooney spectacles , and an object of much interest .
__label__1	It is quite a novelty to have the blinds up , and the shutters open ; and they make themselves dismally comfortable over bottles of wine , which are freely broached as on a festival .
__label__1	Will you have a glass of wine ? ’ ‘ Yes , I will , ’ said the man ; ‘ and I don ’ t deceive you , Governors. ’ It was given him .
__label__0	Within less than ten fathoms a floe was balancing on the waves ; it fell and rose like the launch , threatening in its fall to crush it to atoms .
__label__1	‘ Nobody dead , is there ? ’ said <NAME> , alarmed at the horror in <NAME> ’ s countenance .
__label__0	I recognised magnificent rocks , hung with a tapestry of zoophytes of the most beautiful kind , and I was at first struck by the peculiar effect of this medium .
__label__1	You know the consequences of mixing them ? ” “ Perfectly. ” Certain small packets were made and given to him .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> , <NAME> , do n't you say a word nor yet stir .
__label__0	He tossed about on his sandy couch , scarcely giving a thought to the struggle of the elements .
__label__1	Let her come and go , unobserved and unquestioned .
__label__0	But nothing could oppose serious delay to our travellers .
__label__0	`` My son , '' said he to <NAME> , `` I give my daughter to thee . ''
__label__1	‘ The fact is , ’ resumed <NAME> , ‘ that before I left the country , where I have been for some time past , I undertook to deliver a message to you. ’ ‘ Ay , ay ? ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	Whatever he may think of it , he ought certainly to know it. ” Would you mind coming into the carriage ? ’ Mr <NAME> answered , ‘ Not at all , ’ and took his seat at <NAME> ’ s side .
__label__1	And , lastly , that <NAME> should be understood as distinctly pledging himself not to resort to the window , fireplace , or other surreptitious mode of escape in the meanwhile .
__label__1	Troubled as the future was , it was the unknown future , and in its obscurity there was ignorant hope .
__label__0	There were cresses , horse-radish , turnips , and lastly , little branching hairy stalks , scarcely more than three feet high , which produced brownish grains .
__label__1	There must be many ways of doing it .
__label__0	Did a brighter light burn in the depths of that obscured mind ?
__label__1	I suppose we had some notion that this was to end in marriage .
__label__1	‘ Now , boy , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ I am going to put a question to you. ’ ‘ As many as you please , ’ said I .
__label__1	When they are shut into the back room , they speak low .
__label__1	Mrs. Rouncewell confirms all this , not without personal pride , reserving only the one point of affability .
__label__0	A few strokes of the oar brought the canoe into a little creek , and its passengers leaped on shore .
__label__0	[ Illustration : Typical native of the <NAME> des <NAME> . ]
__label__0	Speaking of the moon , she is nearest to the earth in her perigee , and farthest from it in her apogee .
__label__0	He named it <NAME> , because of all that he needed he had been able to procure but one thing -- wood .
__label__0	They placed them over our outer clothing , and so loaded us that we could scarcely move . ''
__label__1	‘ It was the fright of that -- that noise and confusion last night , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	Devise your own means of putting him out of my way , and execute them .
__label__0	But the inhabitants showed themselves everywhere so hostile , and opposed such resistance to the strangers landing , that <NAME> after a long and dangerous voyage was obliged to return to <NAME> .
__label__0	His Projectile was proving intractable to the laws of gravitation .
__label__1	On two or three occasions he was employed on business which took him to a distance , and had formerly been transacted by <NAME> .
__label__0	`` Yes , <NAME> , '' the doctor answered , pressing the brave sailor 's hand .
__label__1	I told him what I had come for .
__label__0	Upon the 21st of <NAME> , 1721 , three vessels set sail from <NAME> , under his command .
__label__1	The Augurs of the <NAME> invariably predict that when <NAME> and that finger are in much conference , a terrible avenger will be heard of before long .
__label__0	That was a place which they were the first to set foot in .
__label__1	<NAME> , you shut up the shop ; say another word till your master comes home , at your peril ; and , when he does come home , tell him that <NAME> said he was to send a old woman 's shell after breakfast to-morrow morning .
__label__1	Go straight to the school , and say that you and I agreed upon it -- that we can ’ t overcome father ’ s opposition -- that father will never trouble them , but will never take you back .
__label__0	`` None whatever , '' said <NAME> , `` and the proof is , that the moon has preserved no trace of the gaseous envelope which always accompanies comets . ''
__label__1	I have got three sacks of ladies ' hair below , but none so beautiful and fine as this .
__label__1	Not you ! ” and throwing off other sarcastic sparks from the whirling grindstone of his indignation , <NAME> betook himself to his boot-cleaning and his general preparation for business .
__label__0	Her ebony brows have the form and charm of the bow of <NAME> , the god of love , and beneath her long silken lashes the purest reflections and a celestial light swim , as in the sacred lakes of <NAME> , in the black pupils of her great clear eyes .
__label__0	The direction of the route was determined by the mariner 's needle or compass .
__label__1	It was lost upon <NAME> , who was stooping at the moment to tie the boot-lace which the dog had torn .
__label__0	Fortunately there were hundreds of other animals to secure our little company from hunger , and even from thirst , at need .
__label__1	Indeed , such another lucky hit would almost have set him up in that way to his satisfaction .
__label__1	I never saw him before , in my life , but I instantly lay my finger on him and say “ <NAME> ! ” I see some cups and saucers of <NAME> make , equally strangers to me personally : I put my finger on them , then and there , and I say “ <NAME> , <NAME> , and Canton. ” It is the same with <NAME> , with <NAME> , and with bamboo and sandalwood from the <NAME> ; I put my finger on them all .
__label__0	We first resorted to emetics , and afterwards we succeeded in inducing perspiration , which relieved us greatly .
__label__1	As to the strange man ; if he had come back for his two bank-notes there could have been no dispute about them , because my sister was fully prepared to restore them .
__label__1	‘ Leave him alone , ’ said the green-coated stranger ; ‘ brandy-and-water -- jolly old gentleman -- lots of pluck -- swallow this -- ah ! -- capital stuff. ’ Having previously tested the virtues of a bumper , which had been mixed by the dismal man , the stranger applied the glass to <NAME> ’ s mouth ; and the remainder of its contents rapidly disappeared .
__label__0	But the sailors were exhausted after twenty-four hours of such terrible anxiety .
__label__1	‘ Oh ! ’ says Mr Wegg , with a sort of sense of being introduced ; ‘ I dare say you were all right enough in your own country , but I hope no objections will be taken to my saying that the <NAME> was never yet born as I should wish to match. ’ At this moment the greasy door is violently pushed inward , and a boy follows it , who says , after having let it slam : ‘ Come for the stuffed canary. ’ ‘ It ’ s three and ninepence , ’ returns <NAME> ; ‘ have you got the money ? ’ The boy produces four shillings .
__label__1	These would be hanging on the outskirts of a wide circle of people assembled round some itinerant juggler , opposed , in his turn , by a noisy band of music , or the classic game of ‘ Ring the <NAME> , ’ while ventriloquists holding dialogues with wooden dolls , and fortune-telling women smothering the cries of real babies , divided with them , and many more , the general attention of the company .
__label__1	“ My nephew , ” said the <NAME> , glancing at the supper preparation ; “ they said he was not arrived. ” Nor was he ; but , he had been expected with <NAME> .
__label__0	They simply intended to drive a gallery into the mountain .
__label__1	' I will , directly , sir , ' replied <NAME> : undoing the chain , and turning the key .
__label__1	When I looked down at the trampers whom we passed , and saw that well-remembered style of face turned up , I felt as if the tinker ’ s blackened hand were in the bosom of my shirt again .
__label__1	The visit did not originate with him. ’ ‘ He had some conversation with the poor man .
__label__1	Here , we found a gentleman with one eye , in a velveteen suit and knee-breeches , who wiped his nose with his sleeve on being interrupted in the perusal of the newspaper .
__label__0	We had then to go up a very narrow zigzag path , which follows the edge of the <NAME> glacier , and along the base of the Aiguille-du-Midi .
__label__1	<NAME> him that if , in his own present , he can find a reason to think less bitterly of me , I asked him to do so .
__label__0	and that is why I took refuge here , as the malefactors used to flee to the sanctuaries in the middle ages. ” “ God be praised ! ” said <NAME> , lifting her hands to heaven .
__label__1	What did I tell you when we came away from <NAME> that time ?
__label__0	There a Lascar came alongside in a canoe , sold him the handle of a sword in silver that bore the print of characters engraved on the hilt .
__label__0	When <NAME> had in his cruel irony held the <NAME> letter before the eyes which he believed were destroyed , <NAME> had been able to read , and had read the letter which disclosed the odious plans of the traitor .
__label__1	In this state they traversed without change , except of horses and pace , all the mire-deep leagues that lay between them and the capital .
__label__0	`` Indeed , master , '' replied <NAME> , scratching his sharp nose with the end of his forefinger , `` the experiment begins well , and if I had not prudently closed the supply-tap , I know not what would have happened . ''
__label__0	The sound , therefore , takes twenty seconds to ascend .
__label__1	I hope they may never come to hear of it .
__label__0	The boat was lost to sight , and the coast was not neared again until night was approaching .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> , in particular , was never wearied of telling him how on his return to the world he would be prosecuted for using false weights , and would certainly become acquainted with the inside of a prison .
__label__1	<NAME> gracious , such a woman ! ’ <NAME> shook his head with great solemnity , as though to imply that he supposed she must have been rather a dazzler .
__label__1	A few dull courts and narrow ways brought us to the sky-lighted offices of <NAME> and <NAME> ; in the vestibule of which temple , accessible to pilgrims without the ceremony of knocking , three or four clerks were at work as copyists .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , junior , if you don ’ t leave off chattering your teeth , and shaking with the cold , I ’ ll warm you with a severe thrashing in about half a minute ’ s time. ’ ‘ Sit fast here , genelmen , ’ said the guard as he clambered up .
__label__1	A gaudy parrot in a burnished cage upon the table tears at the wires with her beak , and goes walking , upside down , in its dome-top , shaking her house and screeching ; but Mr Carker is indifferent to the bird , and looks with a musing smile at a picture on the opposite wall .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> d ’ ye do , old fellow ? ’ This was a rival trainer of young noblemen and gentlemen , and the person of all others whom <NAME> most hated and dreaded to meet .
__label__1	‘ In one instant , after the clock struck two , the whole of this deserted and quiet spot had become a scene of most extraordinary life and animation .
__label__1	It was a happy time .
__label__1	'She was my daughter , ' said the old woman , nodding her head in the direction of the corpse ; and speaking with an idiotic leer , more ghastly than even the presence of death in such a place .
__label__0	On every side he was met with embarrassed silence or such replies as , `` The affair happened so long ago , I ca n't remember it , '' or , `` I was not witness to it . ''
__label__0	The orderly performed his culinary operations in the adjoining building , which he also used as a bed-room , and where , extended on what he called his “ good oak mattress , ” he would sleep soundly as a dormouse for twelve hours at a stretch .
__label__1	If you should happen , by any unlikely chance , to know a man more blest in a laugh than <NAME> 's nephew , all I can say is , I should like to know him too .
__label__0	Even this would be some compensation for all their trouble , courage , and intelligence .
__label__1	It was a fine morning , and it occurred to <NAME> that a pint of porter in the open air would lighten his next quarter of an hour or so , as well as any little amusement in which he could indulge .
__label__0	The knowledge of <NAME> , and the investigation of <NAME> literature , had inaugurated a scientific movement which has gone on ever since with increasing energy .
__label__1	And the day ended , and the night ended , and the morning came , and <NAME> , simply dressed as usual and having no one with her but <NAME> , came into the prison with the sunshine .
__label__1	‘ No , <NAME> , upon my word !
__label__1	‘ I don ’ t think he will , Sir. ’ ‘ Whenever I meet that <NAME> again , wherever it is , ’ said <NAME> , raising himself in bed , and indenting his pillow with a tremendous blow , ‘ I ’ ll inflict personal chastisement on him , in addition to the exposure he so richly merits .
__label__1	Gravely , <NAME> , for the subject is grave enough , you know how it is as well as I do .
__label__1	‘ “ <NAME> much better , ” he said at length , “ to shun all such thoughts and chances , and , in the peaceful shelter of the church , devote your lives to Heaven !
__label__1	So very great is the improvement Time has brought about in such habits , that a moderate statement of the quantity of wine and punch which one man would swallow in the course of a night , without any detriment to his reputation as a perfect gentleman , would seem , in these days , a ridiculous exaggeration .
__label__0	Fortunately , the hurricane had shifted a point towards the south , and the launch was able to run before the wind , straight for the Pole , running the risk of foundering , but sailing very fast ; a rock , reef , or piece of ice might at any moment rise before them , and crush them to atoms .
__label__1	‘ Be thankful for me , if you have a kind heart , as I think you have , ’ she said , ‘ that while I know well what I am , I can be cheerful and endure it all .
__label__1	But I thought -- I implore you to remember the narrow construction which has been my besetting sin -- that , in a case where there was so much disparity in point of years -- ’ ‘ That ’ s the way to put it , you see , <NAME> ! ’ observed <NAME> , with fawning and offensive pity .
__label__0	I will wait till you have done -- '' `` For what ? ''
__label__1	Lastly , up comes the flag over <NAME> 's unconscious head cheerfully proclaiming that <NAME> and <NAME> are in their happy home and that there is hospitality at the place in <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> , there is a tall <NAME> clock behind you ( placed there , ' a purpose ) that has a loud beat when it is in motion and can play music .
__label__0	Was it not a partial eruption of the volcano , or perhaps some meteor ? ''
__label__1	'They have n't no more philosophy nor political economy about 'em than that , ' said the beadle , snapping his fingers contemptuously .
__label__1	Then , he hastily proceeded to dispose the watches and jewellery beneath his clothing .
__label__1	It is extraordinary how long a man may look among the crowd without discovering the face of a friend , but it is no less true .
__label__0	They would find some one there to speak to , at all events .
__label__1	And I recollect two bursting to the opposite side of the parlour , while she was hugging me .
__label__1	‘ Not in health ? ’ ‘ N -- n -- o ; perhaps not in health exactly , ’ said <NAME> , pausing to consider , ‘ although he is a worn and feeble creature , and has that in his face which it would wring my heart to see in yours .
__label__1	To enlighten it with the lights of a stone passage , a flight of stairs , a brown window-curtain , and a black man .
__label__0	The name <NAME> comes from the <NAME> word `` sargazzo '' which signifies kelp .
__label__1	The dream will have come again .
__label__0	“ I owe you all , <NAME> .
__label__1	Let his foe follow him , and find him for himself , but not through me !
__label__0	The next day , at dawn , <NAME> and <NAME> , mounting the cart drawn by two onagers , took the road to the corral and set off at a round trot .
__label__1	That gently done , he called to him <NAME> and <NAME> .
__label__1	He stopped just as his eminently practical friend , still accompanied by the two young culprits , entered the room .
__label__1	‘ Perhaps you will think it strange , sir , ’ —this was said in a hesitating voice— ‘ that I should so soon ask you to allow me to confide in you , and to have the kindness to hear a word or two from me in my defence ? ’ ‘ Defence ? ’ <NAME> repeated .
__label__1	You have no more nat'ral sense of duty than the bed of this here <NAME> river has of a pile , and similarly it must be knocked into you. ” The altercation was conducted in a low tone of voice , and terminated in the honest tradesman 's kicking off his clay-soiled boots , and lying down at his length on the floor .
__label__0	`` The doctor has an answer for everything , '' was his only reply .
__label__1	He hath a lamb from the fold ! ’ cried the preacher , raising his voice still higher and pointing to the baby .
__label__0	these old vaultings are no longer quite secure , of course , and -- ” “ Mr .
__label__0	Harding also reminded his companions of the singular behaviour of <NAME> and Jup when they prowled round the mouth of the well , which placed <NAME> in communication with the sea , and he told them that he had explored the well , without discovering anything suspicious .
__label__1	We went on our way upstairs after this episode ; and , as we were going up , we met a gentleman groping his way down .
__label__1	There are dark pools of water , muddy lanes , and miserable habitations far below .
__label__0	`` Yes , I have no doubt of that , friend <NAME> , '' pursued <NAME> ; `` but to see the eclipse it would not be necessary to quit the dark hemisphere altogether .
__label__1	said my guardian , looking back over his shoulder half angrily ; only half angrily , for he never seemed to consider <NAME> an accountable being .
__label__1	It had vanished from the earth .
__label__1	‘ There ’ s an unfortunate devil , who has got a friend on the poor side , that ’ s glad to do anything of that sort .
__label__0	what stress the worthy man had laid on the verb `` float ! ''
__label__0	<NAME> was anxious , though she said nothing .
__label__1	He returned home one evening from an interview with her father , who had mentioned that she was out visiting -- which was what he always said when she was hard at work to buy his supper -- and found Mr Meagles in an excited state walking up and down his room .
__label__1	I ceased to draw back , and we went straight to the best parlour , where she left me .
__label__0	<NAME> , not wishing to retard him , obliged herself to walk .
__label__0	Besides , it was very likely that <NAME> was merely an island , and did not extend to the Pole .
__label__1	‘ My love , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ you professed yourself very fond of <NAME> Fitz-Marshall .
__label__0	March 24th was <NAME> Sunday , -- that day when the streets of the towns and villages of <NAME> are filled with flowers and leaves ; bells are ringing , and the air is filled with rich perfumes .
__label__0	they can ’ t be made like us , eh ? ” “ But they ARE just like us , Jack. ” “ Oh , no !
__label__0	“ Decidedly we have only one way , ” said <NAME> , “ one single way for leaving <NAME> , and that is , to build a vessel large enough to sail several hundred miles .
__label__1	'That 's the second , ' observed the woman with much deliberation .
__label__1	His forehead was narrow , his face wide , his head large , and his nose all on one side , as if <NAME> , indignant with the propensities she observed in him in his birth , had given it an angry tweak which it had never recovered .
__label__1	said he after giving us a courteous greeting .
__label__0	I took a malicious delight in watching the thousand little cascades that flowed down the side of the cone , carrying with them at times a stream of stones into the `` vasty deep '' below .
__label__1	<NAME> , why are you come again ? ’ ‘ Since then , ’ said <NAME> , with the same grasp of her arm , and the same look in her face , ‘ I have seen him !
__label__0	Both of them , moreover , were rigid disciples of the renowned <NAME> , who pronounces that to play the pawns well is “ the soul of chess ” ; and , accordingly , not one pawn had been sacrificed without a most vigorous defense .
__label__1	‘ I imagine not , sir -- I imagine not , ’ said <NAME> , in a very peremptory tone .
__label__0	<NAME> not <NAME> bought from <NAME> in 1803 at the price of sixteen million dollars ? ''
__label__1	He gave such a start when I put my hand upon his shoulder , that he made me start too .
__label__1	A broad , fine , honest sun lighted up the green pastures and dimpled water with the semblance of summer , while it left the travellers all the invigorating freshness of that early time of year .
__label__1	“ Six months , a year ! ” “ Not so long as that , ” said I .
__label__0	`` <NAME> has calculated that a force five times greater than that of our gun would suffice to send a meteor from the moon to the earth , and there is not one volcano which has not a greater power of propulsion than that . ''
__label__0	But <NAME> had not all this time been forgetful of her children , and had sent an expedition in search of them every year .
__label__0	But there was no longer a _Halbrane_ !
__label__0	Most of the natives of <NAME> who accompanied the embassy suffered from low fever and dysentery .
__label__1	Rather better than twelve years ago. ’ ‘ Rather better ? ’ said Mr Meagles , ‘ you mean rather worse .
__label__1	Wants to keep it close and quiet , and to keep you out of the way. ’ They were still debating this point when a shadow darkened the entry , and the glass door was opened by a messenger who brought a letter unceremoniously addressed , ‘ Riah. ’ To which he said there was an answer wanted .
__label__1	And if the <NAME> of <NAME> , a little hurt and irritated at this , took heart , and ventured to suggest that his wife was at least no worse off than the wives of other barons , the <NAME> begged all persons to take notice , that nobody but she , sympathised with her dear daughter ’ s sufferings ; upon which , her relations and friends remarked , that to be sure she did cry a great deal more than her son-in-law , and that if there were a hard-hearted brute alive , it was that <NAME> of <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ No , ’ replied <NAME> ’ ly , shaking her head , ‘ I ’ m afraid of the sea. ’ ‘ Afraid ! ’ I said , with a becoming air of boldness , and looking very big at the mighty ocean .
__label__1	Suppose my conscience -- ’ ‘ And we know what a conscience it is , my soul .
__label__1	<NAME> hustled him into a little noisy and rather dirty machinery , in a by-comer , and made him Member of <NAME> for <NAME> : one of the respected members for ounce weights and measures , one of the representatives of the multiplication table , one of the deaf honourable gentlemen , dumb honourable gentlemen , blind honourable gentlemen , lame honourable gentlemen , dead honourable gentlemen , to every other consideration .
__label__0	We were now convinced that this subterranean sea contained only fish known to us as fossil specimens -- and fish and reptiles alike were all the more perfect the farther back they dated their origin .
__label__1	‘ “ I will , ” rejoined the baron .
__label__0	“ Where would we be , ” said he , “ with only one balloon ?
__label__1	I rather thought that everyone was struck by his not being proud , and taking notice of us .
__label__0	The account of this expedition to a place which has only lately been revisited , would be of great interest ; but unfortunately , so far as we know , his journal has not been published .
__label__1	I was wondering who it was , who kept the fire off. ” With that , I poked tremendously , and having done so , planted myself side by side with <NAME> , my shoulders squared and my back to the fire .
__label__1	as soft as possible , if you please. ’ With which words , <NAME> sighed .
__label__0	So they had a chance of salvation , and the case was not quite so desperate .
__label__0	`` He believed that <NAME> and his companions must all have perished in the landslip of the hill of Klock-Klock ? ''
__label__0	Some sailors , however , succeeded in capturing a young woman , whom they carried on board with them .
__label__1	If he falls in my way , I shall tell him my mind ; if he don ’ t fall in my way , I shan ’ t , for it won ’ t be worth my while to do it .
__label__0	Then they began to act , each one as he thought best .
__label__0	However , as the wind was blowing from the north-east , in all probability the vessel was sailing on the starboard tack .
__label__1	Joy of D. who dances round J. while he eats his supper .
__label__0	Then arrived <NAME> and the others .
__label__0	They consisted of salted and dried meats , smoked fish , biscuit , and flour ; mountains of coffee and tea were deposited in the store-room .
__label__1	His back very much scarred by the whip ; and branded on the thigh and hips in three or four places , thus ( J M ) .
__label__0	They perceived by the tranquillity of the sea , in which no shallows troubled the waters , by its uniform color , which was stained by no yellow shades , by the absence of even a reef , that the coast was steep and that the ocean there covered a deep abyss .
__label__1	After which the six-footer comes into action and is much admired .
__label__0	`` Our science of optics is still very defective , and through our mile-and-three-quarter telescopes -- '' `` Listen to that , <NAME> , '' broke in <NAME> , turning to a second scientist .
__label__0	His bleeding arms , his body covered with cuts and bruises , told what his sufferings had been .
__label__1	( <NAME> himself always spoke of the year of our Lord as <NAME> : apparently under the impression that the <NAME> era dated from the invention of a popular game , by a lady who had bestowed her name upon it . )
__label__1	How much have I to be thankful for , in <NAME> ’ s kind intention to give me my articles , which would otherwise not lay within the umble means of mother and self ! ’ ‘ Then , when your articled time is over , you ’ ll be a regular lawyer , I suppose ? ’ said I .
__label__1	My convict never looked at me , except that once .
__label__1	<NAME> and red-eyed , his hopes plainly had deserted him , his sanguine mood was gone , and all his worst misgivings had come back .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> was giving it , with all due secrecy and circumspection .
__label__1	‘ Ye-es , ’ said the other , turning full upon him .
__label__0	I could understand , when looking through a lens at an object , why we get only its reversed image -- a simple law of optics explains _that_ .
__label__0	After setting on foot a public subscription , which realized nearly L1,200,000 , they began the gigantic work .
__label__1	The marriage was to make no change in their place of residence ; they had been able to extend it , by taking to themselves the upper rooms formerly belonging to the apocryphal invisible lodger , and they desired nothing more .
__label__0	<NAME> to the left , near the men 's side , is <NAME> , the <NAME> of <NAME> , into which , though it is rather small , and full of sunken rocks , she sometimes allows herself to wander , moody , and pouting , and not exactly knowing where she wants to go or what she wants to do .
__label__1	‘ Major Bagstock , my darling <NAME> , ’ drawled her mother , ‘ who is generally the most useless and disagreeable creature in the world : as you know -- ’ ‘ It is surely not worthwhile , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , looking round , ‘ to observe these forms of speech .
__label__1	‘ I have brought your bread , <NAME> , ’ said he ( they all spoke in <NAME> , but the little man was an <NAME> ) ; ‘ and if I might recommend you not to game -- ’ ‘ You don ’ t recommend the master ! ’ said <NAME> , showing his teeth as he smiled .
__label__0	<NAME> and the <NAME> were crossed , and the explorers penetrated into <NAME> , which <NAME> was to visit a few years later , a district inhabited by a people as fanatic and fierce as those of <NAME> .
__label__1	They were looking at the birds , while a medical gentleman who was so good as to attend <NAME> with much solicitude and compassion spoke with her cheerfully by the fire .
__label__0	The envoy had not reached <NAME> when <NAME> landed at the fort on <NAME> .
__label__0	He had returned to <NAME> , and made a fortune , and was now planting cabbages in his retirement , if the best-informed reporters were to be believed .
__label__1	‘ Let me see , said the blind man .
__label__0	It was under the action of this cylinder , charged with some explosive substance , nitro-glycerine , picrate , or some other material of the same nature , that the water of the channel had been raised like a dome , the bottom of the brig crushed in , and she had sunk instantly , the damage done to her hull being so considerable that it was impossible to refloat her .
__label__1	Now , I 'll tell you what I have got for supper , <NAME> .
__label__0	In fact , the canoe probably would not have been able to contain the articles possibly enclosed in the chest , which doubtless was heavy , since two empty barrels were required to buoy it up .
__label__1	But notwithstanding these drawbacks , the <NAME> , being heartily in earnest , read the service to the very last line , and with genuine feeling too ; and approving of it very much when he had done , turned in , under the counter ( but not before he had been upstairs , and listened at <NAME> ’ s door ) , with a serene breast , and a most benevolent visage .
__label__0	This kindness tended to attach the natives to the admiral , and from that day they came in numbers round the caravels ; their king came with them , a strong , vigorous , and somewhat stout young man of twenty years of age ; he was naked , like his subjects of both sexes , who showed him much respect , but with no appearance of servility .
__label__1	All these trivial incidents belonged to the routine of life , and the return of morning .
__label__0	I passed the whole of the following night with a nightmare on my chest !
__label__0	`` We have , '' said the Professor , who all this time was continuing his observations , `` and you may see by careful examination that these fossil fish have no identity with existing species .
__label__1	He was as good-natured a dancing-master as ever danced to the <NAME> , and he kept his word .
__label__1	‘ And what I recommend you for the present , is , don ’ t talk , <NAME> .
__label__0	`` You 're as wrong now as you thought you were right yesterday . ''
__label__0	In my present state of excitement and enthusiasm , I was always first .
__label__1	And he did it ; yes , he did !
__label__1	Having something more than a suspicion of the object of the gentleman ’ s visit , <NAME> preceded him to the <NAME> and <NAME> , and , turning sharp round , planted himself in the centre of the doorway .
__label__1	<NAME> night ! ’ She took the hand he offered her , and gratefully and almost reverently raised it to her lips .
__label__0	The difference evidently depends on the conductibility of certain rocks .
__label__0	“ May I be allowed to ask , <NAME> , to what I am indebted for the honor of this visit ? ” asked <NAME> presently .
__label__1	We felt our inexperience , and were unable to help ourselves .
__label__1	It was evident that in all this he had merely been imitating the motions of my fingers , and placing his hand upon the key , cup , & c. , as part of the process , without any perception of the relation between the sign and the object .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> ! ’ So saying , he nodded in a friendly manner , and took his leave : stopping when he had passed the outer door a little distance , and grinning with extraordinary delight .
__label__1	‘ I beg your pardon , <NAME> ; but have you ever done this sort of thing in your time ? ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	He even told <NAME> that his marriage was the last freak he would be able to allow himself .
__label__0	<NAME> , his two sailors , <NAME> , and <NAME> went off at once into the wood , where the animals had passed the night .
__label__0	The point is to know if we may count among our chances of being rescued , the return of the <NAME> vessel .
__label__1	Comes here every Sunday when they are at home. ’ ‘ An artist , I infer from what he says ? ’ ‘ A sort of a one , ’ said <NAME> , in a surly tone .
__label__1	I have a great respect for <NAME> , and no one in whom he is interested can be an object of indifference to me . ''
__label__1	Considering myself sufficiently incongruous on my legal eminence , I have until now suppressed my domestic destiny .
__label__1	<NAME> added , with strong marks of irritation , that the new way of fumigating clothes up yonder was infernal unconstitutional , for it burnt holes in them , and there was no remedy against the <NAME> .
__label__1	'You can do nothing to help me .
__label__0	Evidently the <NAME> , who have often had much to do with <NAME> ships , had finally learned the value of these objects ; since the visit of the _Fox_ they had come frequently to this great storehouse , and had pillaged incessantly , with the intention of leaving no trace of what had been there ; and now a long drift of half-melted snow covered the ground .
__label__1	'If you knew what I am sometimes , you would pity me , indeed .
__label__1	‘ Indeed ! ’ said <NAME> , surprised .
__label__1	‘ Doctors were called in -- great men who rolled up to my door in easy carriages , with fine horses and gaudy servants .
__label__1	On the grounds that it ’ s well understood along the cause ’ ays and the stairs that he done it .
__label__0	<NAME> was not taken into consideration .
__label__1	On our arrival in <NAME> , we had called with <NAME> at Mrs. <NAME> 's but had not been so fortunate as to find her at home .
__label__1	They left that fancy ware to boys and girls , and boarding-schools and books .
__label__0	Fifty-five years later <NAME> and <NAME> completed the valuable work of <NAME> , and drew up the map of the Manañon as far as <NAME> .
__label__0	to betray our colleagues and you ?
__label__0	After the long stay made by <NAME> in equinoctial <NAME> , the impulse his explorations would doubtless otherwise have given to geographical science was strangely checked by the struggle of the <NAME> colonies with the mother country .
__label__0	198 Pirogues of the <NAME> .
__label__1	She ran in , and was running out again when she saw me .
__label__0	But he hid his joy so well that the doctor did not even suspect it ; he asked himself why <NAME> 's eye shone with so unusual a lustre ; but that was all , and the natural reply to this question did not enter his head .
__label__1	It seems to require much mixing and compounding .
__label__0	After some moments of silence , which not one of us dreamed of breaking , `` Gentlemen , '' said he , in a calm and penetrating voice , `` I speak <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> equally well .
__label__0	They rose among the volumes of smoke to a height of five or six hundred feet .
__label__1	`` <NAME> and <NAME> , '' said he , rather out of breath , `` with all apologies for intruding , WILL you allow me to order up a person that 's on the stairs and that objects to being left there in case of becoming the subject of observations in his absence ?
__label__1	The quick eye of the <NAME> detected his helplessness immediately , and now , as she afterwards observed , she felt she had got him .
__label__1	And touched him with the back of his hand upon the breast , and backed to his chair , and sat down on it with a pale face , holding the arms , and shaking his head at him .
__label__1	I see none like them in that place , but he is admitted to be superior to all the rest .
__label__0	It hurled itself against the fleshy mass , passing through from one part to the other , leaving behind it two quivering halves of the animal .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> turned away their eyes more with disgust than with terror .
__label__1	I feel as if I do ; I know that , '' says <NAME> with a very genuine shudder .
__label__1	' I was a regular cunning sneak when I was at school .
__label__0	No atmosphere here interposed its layers of humidity or of unequal density to interrupt the stately majesty of their effulgence .
__label__1	He had been prepared to miss her very much , but not so much .
__label__0	`` As <NAME> , I am unwilling , we are unwilling , that others should go where we have not been .
__label__0	But there is a wide difference between a wish and its fulfilment !
__label__1	I had given my darling to him now , and I meant to go ; but I lingered for one more look of the precious face which it seemed to rive my heart to turn from .
__label__0	It is needless to say that <NAME> and <NAME> were happy .
__label__1	This artificial respiration ceasing , do I feel any faint flutter under my hand upon the chest ?
__label__1	Mr <NAME> , assenting , armed himself with his stool and the large ruler , and repaired with his employer to the scene of action , where <NAME> was already ringing a hand-bell with all her might , and yet without producing the smallest effect upon their mysterious lodger .
__label__1	I have n't had the letter more than a quarter of an hour . ''
__label__1	When would that trial come , through which her faith in , and her duty to , her dear husband , was to carry her , rendering him triumphant ?
__label__0	But they were mostly sailing vessels , of which , of course , <NAME> could make no use .
__label__0	That the captain was to receive the sum of 97,740 francs within ten days of their arrival at <NAME> .
__label__0	You will be alone , under the eye of a God who reads the depths of the heart ; but you will be neither lost nor forgotten , as was <NAME> .
__label__0	“ Who are you , my friend ? ” <NAME> asked him .
__label__1	is the likeness gone , and is it my gal -- only my gal -- that ’ s to change so ! ’ ‘ We shall all change , mother , in our turn , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	“ These will be good ! ” cried <NAME> , going to the sailor ’ s aid .
__label__1	‘ Do stop all night ! ’ ‘ I couldn ’ t indeed , <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> , who was almost dead from nausea and the closeness of the room .
__label__1	‘ Not I , <NAME> , thank you , ’ said <NAME> , laughing .
__label__0	But we are still descending .
__label__0	“ At any rate , we must make haste , ” said <NAME> .
__label__1	O ye sun , moon , and stars , the great man !
__label__0	I saw a fathomless , a bottomless abyss , which yawned beneath the turgid waves .
__label__0	It must have been the glitter of those spangles in the bright flames issuing from the steamboat ’ s funnel which had attracted his attention .
__label__1	I will not say a word more .
__label__1	'Very true , ' said the undertaker ; 'they would indeed . '
__label__1	‘ Ye-es , if I can , ’ returned the other , promptly .
__label__1	<NAME> away. ’ ‘ It is upon honour , sir ? ’ the other still stipulated , with respectful firmness .
__label__1	`` I have achieved that reputation , I suppose . ''
__label__0	It seemed to them , when they had finished , as if they had scarcely been working more than a few minutes .
__label__0	“ No , my <NAME> ; but the passage does not seem dangerous .
__label__0	<NAME> , his iron-tipped spear in his hand , wished to go to <NAME> ’ s help , and attack the dangerous animal in its own element .
__label__0	<NAME> had evidently hit upon the only plausible reason of this deviation .
__label__1	At this hour and by this light it changes into threatening hands raised up and menacing the handsome face with every breath that stirs .
__label__0	“ Will you tell me where <NAME> is ? ” asked <NAME> .
__label__0	When all these precautions had been taken -- `` My friends , '' said <NAME> , and his voice betrayed some emotion , `` if these wretches endeavour to seize <NAME> , we shall defend it -- shall we not ? ''
__label__0	They were pursuing the high road to <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> , very apoplectic , still exhibits his deportment about town , still enjoys himself in the old manner , is still believed in in the old way .
__label__0	`` Which is the highest in the lot ? ''
__label__1	I was nearly going away without the pie , but I was tempted to mount upon a shelf , to look what it was that was put away so carefully in a covered earthenware dish in a corner , and I found it was the pie , and I took it in the hope that it was not intended for early use , and would not be missed for some time .
__label__0	A few minutes later , <NAME> , seated with his comrade in a corner of the hold , told him all that had occurred on board the brig .
__label__1	‘ In the river , ’ somebody rejoins .
__label__0	At six o'clock all our preparations were completed , and M. Fridriksson shook hands heartily with us .
__label__0	With these intrepid men , whose names have been preserved , and amongst whom was <NAME> de <NAME> , one of the historians of the expedition , <NAME> retired to an uninhabited island at a greater distance from the coast , to which he gave the name of <NAME> .
__label__1	So I went there to thank her. ’ ‘ <NAME> , ’ said her young mistress , putting her hand up over her shoulder that the other might take it , ‘ <NAME> almost frightened me when we parted , and I scarcely like to think of her just now as having been so near me without my knowing it .
__label__1	'Look down , ' said <NAME> , lowering the lantern into the gulf .
__label__1	She came to meet me with a smile of welcome and her hand extended , but seemed to change her mind in a moment and kissed me .
__label__1	‘ “ Still wasting the precious hours , ” said the monk at length , turning to the eldest sister as he spoke , “ still wasting the precious hours on this vain trifling .
__label__1	He lighted the second at the ashes of the first , and smoked on , looking sideways at his companion , who , preoccupied with his own case , hardly looked at him .
__label__1	`` It is enough that the time will come when this good woman will find that it WAS much , and that forasmuch as she did it unto the least of these -- This child , '' he added after a few moments , `` could she possibly continue this ? ''
__label__0	We would fight to the death , of course , but after that !
__label__1	For myself , I know no station in which , the occupation of to-day cheerfully done and the occupation of to-morrow cheerfully looked to , any one of these pursuits is not most humanising and laudable .
__label__1	When he called his mother names , because she wouldn ’ t give up the young lady ’ s property , and she relenting , caused him to relent likewise , and fall down on one knee and ask her blessing , how the ladies in the audience sobbed !
__label__1	To offer it or hint at it would be to drive him to an extremity , if nothing else did . ''
__label__0	But new obstacles soon presented themselves ; the passages were closing in consequence of the incessant crowding of the floating masses ; every moment threatened to close up the clear water before the <NAME> , and if she were nipped , it would be hard to get her out .
__label__0	But the colonists ' object was not simply to admire the magnificent vegetation .
__label__0	The _hällristningar_ , for so they call the graphic representations so often met with on the rocks of <NAME> and <NAME> , enable us to picture to ourselves these swift vessels , which could carry a considerable crew .
__label__1	Always proceeding from a rigid mouth and closed teeth , as if the jaw were locked and the face frozen up in pain .
__label__0	These could not hinder the progress of the raft , which offered little resistance to the wind .
__label__1	God bless you ! ’ and withdrew .
__label__1	Yes , it was ; there they were .
__label__1	His walk is as erect , his bearing is as stiff as ever it has been .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> has gone to get a book or two he wants , and will probably be back before me .
__label__0	`` And the labourers going to the fields !
__label__0	We had to seek repose at more than twenty-five fathoms in the bowels of the deep .
__label__0	The most celebrated of these narrows is the _pongo_ , or gate , of <NAME> , in the heart of the <NAME> , where the <NAME> has hewn for itself a bed only fifty-five fathoms wide , with all but perpendicular sides .
__label__1	‘ Just keep your eye upon him for a few minutes , ’ murmured <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ I tell you , ’ returned <NAME> boldly , ‘ that I don ’ t know .
__label__0	`` Well , we 'll talk about it to-morrow ; I have n't time now . ''
__label__0	What _had_ switched them off ?
__label__1	In conclusion , if you feel a sense of having injured me , and a desire to make some small reparation , I hope you will think how respectable you might have been yourself and will contemplate your blighted existence. ’ Was it strange that the wretched man should take this heavily to heart ?
__label__0	`` Thus , my friends , '' said <NAME> , `` all motion suddenly stopped produces heat .
__label__0	<NAME> was coming down the ladder , when his whistling was cut short by a sudden exclamation of surprise .
__label__0	Was it not one of her children , <NAME> , whose audacious voyage in 1611 gave her possession of the island named after him situated within the seventy-first parallel ?
__label__1	That ’ s nothing , <NAME> ! ’ ‘ Truly , it ain ’ t as much as one could sometimes wish it to be , my dear , ’ he admitted , drawing his hand across his mouth .
__label__1	They have made a perfect palace of the house , positively. ’ ‘ It is handsome , ’ said Mr Dombey , looking round .
__label__0	It shows _à priori_ that each letter is modified in virtue of the ciphers of the number and according to the place which it occupies. ” “ And why ? ” “ Because in no language will you find words with three consecutive repetitions of the letter _h. ” _ <NAME> was struck with the argument ; he thought about it , and , in short , had no reply to make .
__label__1	Everything of father ’ s had gone wrong that night , and he hadn ’ t pleased the public at all .
__label__1	It was not to be .
__label__1	`` By all means , <NAME> . ''
__label__0	It roared ; it yelled ; it shrieked with glee as of demons let loose .
__label__0	[ Illustration ] The doctor remembered <NAME> 's ingenious theory about these meteors ; he supposed that certain clouds composed of prisms of ice are hanging in the air ; the sun 's rays falling on these prisms are refracted at angles of sixty and ninety degrees .
__label__0	At the bottom of the ladder was a deck , lighted by electricity .
__label__1	The cheering thought that he was labouring on where <NAME> had just toiled before him , would , of itself , have been a stimulant to <NAME> in the perpetual resumption of his studies ; but coupled with the actual lightening of his load , consequent on this assistance , it saved him , possibly , from sinking underneath the burden which the fair <NAME> piled upon his back .
__label__0	the time for throwing out poor Satellite ? ''
__label__1	They left you , you say -- at those races , as I understand .
__label__0	The present case compelled them to dispense with hunting-dogs , and , no matter what <NAME> ’ s agility might be , he could not be expected to have the scent of a setter or a greyhound .
__label__1	I had told <NAME> of the terrible event , and it had greatly shocked him ; but there could be no doubt of the kindness of keeping it a secret , and he had come to help me in this last service .
__label__1	`` I would greatly prefer , officer , '' <NAME> returns stiffly , `` my <NAME> 's name being entirely omitted from this discussion . ''
__label__1	During the half-hour , the young gentlemen , broken into pairs , loitered arm-in-arm up and down a small piece of ground behind the house , or endeavoured to kindle a spark of animation in the breast of <NAME> .
__label__1	What has this to do with me ? ''
__label__1	‘ Oh , very , <NAME> , very , ’ replied <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Therefore , my dear Doctor , ’ said the <NAME> , giving him several affectionate taps , ‘ you may command me , at all times and seasons .
__label__1	‘ I ’ ve a good sitiwation here , sir. ’ ‘ If you change your mind at any time , ’ returned <NAME> , ‘ come to me at my works , and you ’ ll always find an opening in the lime-kiln. ’ ‘ Thankee sir , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	it was he who threw us the ladder ! ''
__label__0	and no war in prospect ! ''
__label__1	If any true friend and well-wisher could make you a bankrupt , you would be a <NAME> ; but as a man of property you are a Demon ! ’ After despatching this second bolt with a still greater expenditure of force , <NAME> laughed and cried still more .
__label__0	<NAME> , in 1616 , found in the bay of that name <NAME> ; he was followed in 1619 by <NAME> , and in 1719 by <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , who were never heard of again .
__label__0	They took the articles as they came , intending to sort them afterwards .
__label__1	Physicians ’ prescriptions carefully prepared , ” and all the rest of it .
__label__1	<NAME> constitution has much to do with the development of such facts , no doubt ; but in this case , appetite carried it hollow over the tender passion ; Mr Dombey being very cool and collected , and the Major fretting and fuming in a state of violent heat and irritation .
__label__0	He was taken back on shore loaded with presents , and the kind welcome which he had received induced eighteen of his companions , thirteen women and five men , to come on board .
__label__1	Mr Carker , who was quite prepared for a cold reception , wrote upon a card that he must take the liberty of pressing for an interview , and that he would not be so bold as to do so , for the second time ( this he underlined ) , if he were not equally sure of the occasion being sufficient for his justification .
__label__1	how , is , my , lit , tle , friend ? ’ over and over and over again .
__label__1	WHY should the <NAME> have refused the note ?
__label__1	In his lifetime , and likewise in the period of <NAME> 's `` time '' of seven long years , there dwelt with <NAME> in the same law-stationering premises a niece -- a short , shrewd niece , something too violently compressed about the waist , and with a sharp nose like a sharp autumn evening , inclining to be frosty towards the end .
__label__0	Both have dense fogs , and , in spring and autumn , winds so fierce that the very vegetables in the fields are frequently rooted up .
__label__0	The post of the <NAME> became once more a sinecure , and if his salary was not reduced , it was because the burgomaster and the counsellor could not make up their minds to decide upon it .
__label__1	Could we walk , my friends , without strength ?
__label__1	“ I have seen it done very often in my time , <NAME> , between more people than I should like to mention to you ; but it never came to anything after all. ” ‘ “ You must have seen some queer things , ” said <NAME> , with an inquisitive look .
__label__1	That hope deferred , which , ( as the <NAME> very correctly tells us , Mr Dombey would have added in a patronising way ; for his highest distinct idea even of <NAME> , if examined , would have been found to be ; that as forming part of a general whole , of which <NAME> and <NAME> formed another part , it was therefore to be commended and upheld ) maketh the heart sick .
__label__0	Most of them anointed their hair and beards with a yellow ointment , and some even rubbed their faces with the same stuff . ''
__label__0	`` Do n't you know that the sea turned it over ? ''
__label__0	`` But suppose a Selenite to be six times smaller than a man like us ! ''
__label__0	The study of natural history , the publication of his diary , and his correspondence , occupied him until 1817 , at which time he expected to go with a caravan to <NAME> .
__label__1	The boy sprung up , stroked his face with his hand , and threw his wasted arms round his neck , crying out that he was his dear kind friend .
__label__1	Oh , I should be so glad if you did know better , but I am so very much afraid that I must know best ! ’ <NAME> asked her , laughing outright , whether she ever saw her own face or heard her own voice ?
__label__1	This man pursued <NAME> closely , and professed to be devoted to her .
__label__1	Mr and <NAME> have sent me the kindest note possible ( which Mr Rokesmith just now read to me out aloud , for I ain ’ t good at handwritings ) , offering to find me another little child to name and educate and bring up .
__label__0	`` We have nothing to do but to go away , '' whispered <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> , taken prisoner by the natives , owed to this sad circumstance his long residence in the country and the collection of the first authentic documents relating to the forests and the savage natives of <NAME> , the <NAME> , with a commercial jealousy which they were not singular in evincing , having until now kept secret all the information which had come to light concerning an island of which they were endeavouring to make a colony .
__label__0	It had been ascertained to have two tributaries : the <NAME> , part of whose course had been traced , whilst its source had been pointed out by the natives , and the <NAME> , the mouth and lower portion of which had been carefully examined by <NAME> .
__label__0	But before proceeding to the narrative of the adventures of <NAME> and <NAME> , we will devote a small space to the record of the work done by the <NAME> naturalist , <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Not come in search of you , you see ; but still seeking some one .
__label__1	'If they have -- I do not know how they can , but if they have -- any reference to me , ' said <NAME> , 'pray let me hear them at some other time .
__label__1	The curse of those occasions is heavy upon me , for I always remember them .
__label__1	Is not this a pretty fellow to talk as big as you have heard him now ? ’ ‘ And as I heard him last night , ’ said <NAME> ; ‘ as I heard him last night when he sneaked into my house , and -- he !
__label__0	for each man , for every degree .
__label__0	The speed of the <NAME> was considerably abated , and with irregular course she sometimes swam in the bosom of the waters , sometimes floated on their surface .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	She had looked upon town and country , and beyond these , into the immensity of the sea , the infinity of the heavens .
__label__1	More and more agitated , <NAME> paced her room , and paced the gallery , and looked out at the moon with a new fancy of her likeness to a pale fugitive hurrying away and hiding her guilty face .
__label__1	Mr Dorrit will allow me to withdraw. ’ ‘ Hum .
__label__1	<NAME> do it , Sir. ’ As <NAME> put himself very temptingly within the reach of <NAME> ’ s clenched fist , there is little doubt that that gentleman would have complied with his earnest entreaty , but for the interposition of <NAME> , who , hearing the dispute , emerged from the office , mounted the stairs , and seized his master by the arm .
__label__1	Never , never , never ! ’ He had a violent fit of trembling , and then sunk into his chair .
__label__0	What became of the princess we do not hear , but on parting with <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , she bestowed on them great marks of favour .
__label__1	From the moment of that interchange of looks , they never uttered his name , or any reference to him , aloud ; nor ever pursued the subject of the robbery , when <NAME> spoke of it .
__label__0	But , who struck the first blow ?
__label__1	‘ Similarly , ’ resumes <NAME> , ‘ I have observations as I can offer upon certain points and parties ; but I make no objections , Mr Venus .
__label__1	Clapping her hands with pleasure and running on before me for a short distance , my little acquaintance stopped at a door and remaining on the step till I came up knocked at it when I joined her .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> ’ s friend , closing the room-door , ‘ here is a young friend of mine whom we must assist .
__label__1	Mr <NAME> heard this account with a degree of admiration not altogether consistent with the project in which he had just concurred , but his friend attached very little importance to his behavior in this respect , probably because he knew that he had influence sufficient to control <NAME> ’ s proceedings in this or any other matter , whenever he deemed it necessary , for the advancement of his own purposes , to exert it .
__label__0	However , at that moment the engineer observed that the wire appeared to be slack , and on arriving at post Number 74 , <NAME> , who was in advance stopped , exclaiming -- `` The wire is broken ! ''
__label__1	In one part , carcases of houses , inauspiciously begun and never finished , rotted away .
__label__1	But he caught her by the arm .
__label__1	In the pleasant towns of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , her figure came to be quite well known for some short weeks , and then again passed on .
__label__0	How long was it ago ?
__label__1	I hate it. ’ ‘ Hate it , <NAME> ? ’ ( <NAME> bewildered . )
__label__0	Assuredly if the adventurer was taciturn he was not inquisitive .
__label__1	I ain ’ t a goin ’ to be drownded and not paid for it ! ’ <NAME> looked at him , as though he were claiming to be a Ghost .
__label__1	She then bent over the unconscious man , and , for the first time , kissed him on the cheek , and kissed the poor maimed hand that was nearest to her .
__label__1	Of courthe you do ; I needn ’ t athk .
__label__1	‘ Let us cut this matter short , and not bandy words here with hare-brained profligates .
__label__0	“ Do you know what this plant is ? ” asked <NAME> of the sailor .
__label__0	It belongs neither to you , nor to me , nor the eider-down hunter , nor to any of the living beings who may still exist so marvelously in the interior of the earth . ''
__label__1	‘ Be careful , sir , ’ said <NAME> , looking steadily at him .
__label__1	[ ‘ With a morbid expectation , ’ murmured <NAME> to <NAME> , ‘ that somebody is always going to tell him the truth. ’ ) ‘ This is <NAME> ’ s boat , ’ said Mr Inspector .
__label__0	The question was continually being asked , “ What does the professor really think ? ” “ Our friend the professor , ” said <NAME> , “ is not likely to tell us very much ; but we may feel pretty certain of one thing : he wouldn ’ t keep us long in the dark , if he thought we were not going back to the earth again .
__label__1	Are you there , my friend ?
__label__0	`` My dear uncle , '' I exclaimed , and the big tears rolled down my hot and feverish cheeks .
__label__1	He wound his arms round the old man ’ s body , and held him back .
__label__0	But a greater danger was at hand , and one that it was too late to prevent .
__label__1	`` How long should I have to hold out ? ''
__label__1	But I held her tight all the while , and could have wept over her I do n't know how long .
__label__1	`` Pretty well , grandmother , I think . ''
__label__0	It was gravely asserted that among the animals , there was an elephant not larger than a monkey , but as fierce as a lion , and a cock which was fed upon coal .
__label__0	A sad voyage , for the courageous searching party to come back to the port without bringing home <NAME> with them !
__label__1	I don ’ t like red noses .
__label__0	`` Yes , they are gaining ground gradually , '' said <NAME> ; `` it is evident that they are going to attack us . ''
__label__0	<NAME> care to have all our weapons close at hand .
__label__0	He was not seriously injured .
__label__1	Mr Feeder says he has no doubt of it .
__label__0	`` The heat of the ground is so great in some parts that it is impossible to stand on it for a minute at a time .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> could not determine this in his mind .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , I can not bear to see you so , and think that I have been the cause .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> came to a squeezed house , with a ramshackle bowed front , little dingy windows , and a little dark area like a damp waistcoat-pocket , which he found to be number twenty-four , <NAME> , <NAME> .
__label__1	Had these been such , their imprisoned rays of light would have taken flight that moment , and they would have been as dull as lead .
__label__0	In an instant , our travellers , changing attitudes , formed the new group with tolerable success .
__label__0	[ Illustration : He traced the coast of Tartary . ]
__label__1	I mistrust that by his coming back of his own accord , and showing himself innocent before them all , some one would be confounded , who—to prevent that—has stopped him , and put him out of the way. ’ ‘ That is a dreadful thought , ’ said <NAME> , turning pale .
__label__0	For a second or so they gazed with enraptured fascination at all they could see .
__label__1	‘ Well , but the <NAME> of <NAME> !
__label__1	‘ With pleasure , Monsieur. ’ Thereupon the woman withdrew and left him to look at the room .
__label__0	The bridge was the most urgent work .
__label__0	They could not stay in the town , as it was in flames , and about to be left by the last of the marauders .
__label__1	I don ’ t want him any longer .
__label__0	`` In the first place , <NAME> , '' answered <NAME> , `` we are in the dark about it all .
__label__0	“ We must wait till to-morrow , ” he repeated ; adding , for he had become distrustful of the future , “ that is to say , if to-morrow ever comes. ” Although not very learned in astronomy , <NAME> was acquainted with the position of the principal constellations .
__label__1	‘ Well , Mr <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	Therefore , he awaited the next day with the greatest anxiety .
__label__1	<NAME> , ’ continued Mrs. Pott , raising herself in the arms of her attendant , ‘ my brother , the lieutenant , shall interfere .
__label__0	The <NAME> and <NAME> translation changes it to the 117th meridian .
__label__1	inquired the <NAME> ; taking advantage of the next interval of breathlessness on the part of his friend to propound the question .
__label__1	And I get too much of Mrs. <NAME> 's first and second . ''
__label__0	But they reckoned without an accident which they were powerless to prevent , and neither their zeal nor their skill-fulness could , under the circumstances , have done more .
__label__1	More composure came to me after a while , and we talked as we used to talk , lying on the grass at the old Battery .
__label__1	I am disposed to think , however , that this was occasioned by his not aiming at that object ; as there was a white marble hearth before the fender , which was more convenient , and may have suited his purpose better .
__label__0	On the 7th of February he approaches King <NAME> 's <NAME> and runs to the east , where he soon sights the Cape of <NAME> of <NAME> , and the island named after that navigator .
__label__0	We must here make one important remark with regard to the map by which they were taking observations .
__label__1	Not seeing with precision what was very hard , <NAME> shook his head ; using that important part of himself as a sort of fairy cloak that would fit anything .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> would soon have jumped at it , and he would not have hesitated to do as I did , for nothing ’ s more natural than for one man to give himself up to save two others .
__label__0	On the 17th they set out in the usual line of march , a line which it was hard work for <NAME> to keep , his ardor constantly compelled him to get ahead of the <NAME> , to the great despair of his mule .
__label__0	As far as I was concerned , death had claimed me for his own .
__label__1	Why , then he lurked about and dogged me in the street .
__label__1	I ran to him -- as well as I know , to repeat my appeal for help .
__label__1	The chaining of the door behind her , as she went forth , disenchanted <NAME> of that first relief she had felt .
__label__1	Nothing but flight can save us .
__label__1	Then <NAME> unlocked the door and picked up my sister , who had dropped insensible at the window ( but who had seen the fight first , I think ) , and who was carried into the house and laid down , and who was recommended to revive , and would do nothing but struggle and clench her hands in <NAME> 's hair .
__label__0	`` Because we make their skins into drum heads ! ''
__label__1	‘ My picture , ’ <NAME> proceeded , ‘ goes on to represent ( under correction from you , <NAME> ) , the true lover as ever impatient to be in the presence or vicinity of the beloved object of his affections ; as caring very little for his case in any other society ; and as constantly seeking that .
__label__1	The walls and ceiling were blackened with flies .
__label__1	It would be a splendid thing for me .
__label__1	He had the special peculiarity of some birds of prey , that when he knitted his brow , his ruffled crest stood highest .
__label__1	I got away from him , without knowing how I did it , and mended the fire in the room where we had been together , and sat down by it , afraid to go to bed .
__label__0	The stream of lava swelled like a river about to overflow its banks , and threatened to demolish the sole obstacle which could prevent it from overrunning the whole <NAME> .
__label__1	Hence the concession , and hence the appearance of <NAME> , piloted in by the man , man .
__label__0	A portion of <NAME> , which stretches to the north of that country , was the first to be recognized .
__label__1	You hag , you cat , you dog , you brimstone barker ! ''
__label__1	‘ It was at that time that mama was most solicitous about my <NAME> .
__label__1	Having achieved this feat , he sighed again , and applied himself assiduously to the pie .
__label__1	I wish to hear you state it to me , father. ’ Strange to relate , <NAME> was not so collected at this moment as his daughter was .
__label__1	So we got on , until she was able to smile , and then to laugh , and then to sit up , half ashamed ; while <NAME> recalled her stray ringlets , dried her eyes , and made her neat again , lest her uncle should wonder , when she got home , why his darling had been crying .
__label__0	“ Can we not avoid them by keeping to the shore ?
__label__1	But read the rest , Jo. ” “ The rest , eh , <NAME> ? ” said <NAME> , looking at it with a slow , searching eye , “ One , two , three .
__label__1	Yielding at once to the impulse of her affection , timid at all other times , but bold in its truth to him in his adversity , and undaunted by past repulse , <NAME> , dressed as she was , hurried downstairs .
__label__0	Compelled at the end of these ten years , in consequence of the revolutions which convulsed <NAME> , to take refuge at <NAME> and other islands of the same group , their efforts were there crowned with more success .
__label__0	<NAME> o'clock was striking ; <NAME> was an hour in advance of time .
__label__0	To complete our sketch , we must give an account of <NAME> 's expedition to the <NAME> , and <NAME> 's exploration to the source of the <NAME> , in 1817 .
__label__1	It never is , to obstinate and sullen natures ; for they struggle hard to be such .
__label__1	Remembering the old man ’ s curious manner , and the farewell he had taken of him ; unaccountably fervent at the time , but quite intelligible now : a terrible apprehension strengthened on the <NAME> , that , overpowered by his anxieties and regrets for <NAME> , he had been driven to commit suicide .
__label__0	“ There , ” exclaimed <NAME> , “ our iron-clads can come here after all !
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , I have forgotten this gentleman ’ s name. ’ <NAME> bends over her , and calls to her , ‘ Mr .
__label__1	<NAME> elevates his one eyebrow , and after respectfully staring at his master to express interest , swallows a great gulp of coffee , still staring at him .
__label__1	Can I hope that she will still remain the same <NAME> as of old ?
__label__0	<NAME> made him nice little sweet dishes , which the invalid devoured with great relish , for if he had a pet failing it was that of being somewhat of a gourmand , and <NAME> had never done anything to cure him of this fault .
__label__0	<NAME> was <NAME> ’ s sorrowful story , and she recounted it in so simple and unaffected a manner , that it was evident she never thought her conduct had been that of a heroine through those long trying years .
__label__1	“ Five more days , and then the day before the day !
__label__0	`` And all my limbs are sound and capable of new exertion ? ''
__label__1	In commercial phrase , coffins were looking up ; and , in the course of a few weeks , <NAME> acquired a great deal of experience .
__label__1	All this time I had never been able to consider my own situation , nor could I do so yet .
__label__0	<NAME> and <NAME> had gone shooting in the neighborhood , and brought back some feathered game , which was well received in the larder .
__label__0	That they had gone to the <NAME> or <NAME> regions was extremely unlikely , for those were the very regions they intended to displace .
__label__1	To the <NAME> , therefore , I directed my steps .
__label__0	Important operations were now entrusted to him .
__label__0	And herein what a strange succession of different events all tending to the same end .
__label__0	They then proceeded together towards the little stream .
__label__1	I am much better here , ’ said <NAME> , faintly .
__label__0	The mouth of the <NAME> is a bad place for a vessel , and the sea is heavy there . ''
__label__0	At <NAME> he met <NAME> .
__label__0	His guests congratulated him heartily as he ended his narration ; and <NAME> ’ Moore no doubt expected confidence for confidence , but he waited in vain .
__label__0	[ Illustration ] The next morning the doctor rose early , and made his way over the drifts to the lighthouse .
__label__0	`` At half-past nine , '' says <NAME> , `` we were at the mouth of <NAME> River .
__label__1	He says , no varnish can hide the grain of the wood ; and that the more varnish you put on , the more the grain will express itself .
__label__1	And I have got it ! ''
__label__0	And I fancy , when you have seen our tight-rigged little craft , when you have observed how she behaves at sea , when we sail round our island , for we will do so together -- I fancy , I say , that you will no longer hesitate to let me go .
__label__1	Not before dark night did the men and women come back to the children , wailing and breadless .
__label__1	<NAME> , ” said <NAME> , “ after being all of a heap for half an hour , struck out a plan .
__label__1	<NAME> ’ t come back next day ; didn ’ t come back next week ; missis had bills printed , sayin ’ that , if he ’ d come back , he should be forgiven everythin ’ ( which was very liberal , seein ’ that he hadn ’ t done nothin ’ at all ) ; the canals was dragged , and for two months arterwards , wenever a body turned up , it was carried , as a reg ’ lar thing , straight off to the sassage shop .
__label__1	He saw nothing of it , for before he looked at her , she had again cast down her eyes !
__label__1	At such times , a stranger , looking from one of the wooden bridges thrown across it at <NAME> , will see the inhabitants of the houses on either side lowering from their back doors and windows , buckets , pails , domestic utensils of all kinds , in which to haul the water up ; and when his eye is turned from these operations to the houses themselves , his utmost astonishment will be excited by the scene before him .
__label__0	She holds the adventurer in horror !
__label__1	I do n't know what may happen if I am carried beyond myself at last !
__label__1	On the Sunday morning we all set forth to walk to the little church in the park .
__label__0	326 a <NAME> traveller made his name famous .
__label__0	This was not , however , the case with various scholars of other nationalities , such as <NAME> and <NAME> , who wrote to congratulate D'Urville on his approaching voyage and on the important results to science which might be hoped for .
__label__0	He made no objection to the signal given by the others to return ; he even helped to cut the ropes by which the cannon balls had been attached .
__label__1	So fixed was his figure , that it would have been matter of some difficulty to bend him sufficiently to get him in the carriage-door , if he had not received the timely assistance of a maternal pull from within .
__label__0	But soon the bushes contract , and the arborisations increase .
__label__1	The excellent old gentleman being at these times a mere clothes-bag with a black skull-cap on the top of it , does not present a very animated appearance until he has undergone the two operations at the hands of his granddaughter of being shaken up like a great bottle and poked and punched like a great bolster .
__label__0	Thus five determined persons were about to abandon themselves to the mercy of the tempestuous elements !
__label__0	Was not his sadness only the result of his seclusion ?
__label__0	`` I begin to think that very curious things happen in <NAME> ! ''
__label__0	They were well made and martial-looking , but wore no clothes beyond a kind of apron .
__label__1	The preparations without doors had not been neglected either ; a nun of great personal attractions was telling her beads on the little portico over the door ; and a brigand with the blackest possible head of hair , and the clearest possible complexion , was at that moment going round the town in a cart , consulting the miniature of a lady .
__label__1	If he withdrew them for a moment , it was only to glance at a clock in some neighbouring shop , and then to strain his sight once more in the old quarter with increased earnestness and attention .
__label__0	The captain soon found out by <NAME> 's interpretation ( he understanding the <NAME> tongue ) the right cause of this terrible catastrophe .
__label__1	Why , when these fellows of our acquaintance drink and you drink with them , the more talkative they get , the more silent you get .
__label__1	It ’ s his right evening , and he ’ s very regular. ’ ‘ I suppose , ’ said Mr Toodle , relishing his meal infinitely , ‘ as our <NAME> is a doin ’ now about as well as a boy can do , eh , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Oh !
__label__0	One studies ten years to become an engineer or physician , an advocate or attorney , and should less time be spent in acquiring the knowledge to make a good husband ?
__label__1	“ And that same man , remember , ” pursued the gentleman , throwing his finger at <NAME> heavily , -- “ that same man might be summoned as a juryman upon this very trial , and , having thus deeply committed himself , might return to the bosom of his family and lay his head upon his pillow , after deliberately swearing that he would well and truly try the issue joined between Our Sovereign Lord the King and the prisoner at the bar , and would a true verdict give according to the evidence , so help him God ! ” We were all deeply persuaded that the unfortunate <NAME> had gone too far , and had better stop in his reckless career while there was yet time .
__label__1	At length it becomes plain that the old lady or gentleman has not long to live ; and the plainer this becomes , the more clearly the old lady or gentleman perceives that everybody is in a conspiracy against their poor old dying relative ; wherefore the old lady or gentleman makes another last will—positively the last this time—conceals the same in a china teapot , and expires next day .
__label__1	There would be the dangerous villain : the man I hate : gone ; another secured in his place ; and my influence over the girl , with a knowledge of this crime to back it , unlimited . '
__label__0	During the following days , from the 15th to the 20th of April , the weather was very uncertain ; the temperature fell suddenly twenty degrees , and the atmosphere experienced severe changes , at times being full of snow and squally , at other times cold and dry , so that no one could set foot outside without precautions .
__label__0	But if their works were to require a foundry capable of casting a gun a million times larger than a four hundred pounder , and a projectile weighing one hundred and eighty thousand tons , they would want thousands of workmen ; and where , oh !
__label__0	<NAME> and <NAME> , having bought horses , had already taken the road to <NAME> , where events were to reunite the principal personages of this story .
__label__1	It is that which makes me bold .
__label__1	<NAME> ’ s mother , drying her eyes ( and moistening them , poor soul , more than she dried them ) , now took from the ground a small basket , and submissively addressed herself to the turnkey , saying , would he please to listen to her for a minute ?
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> and his companions , before returning to <NAME> , desired to ascertain the probable direction this inundation of lava was about to take .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> ’ s the matter with me , ’ replied <NAME> nervously .
__label__0	It was now four o ’ clock in the morning .
__label__0	The passage of the <NAME> in front of <NAME> having been regarded by <NAME> as impracticable , a strong body of troops crossed , several versts up the river , by means of bridges formed with boats .
__label__0	The two vessels chosen , the <NAME> and <NAME> , under <NAME> and <NAME> , were carefully equipped , and stocked with everything necessary for so long a voyage , the famous Dampier , who had acquired a great reputation by his daring adventures and piracies , did not disdain to accept the title of chief pilot , and although this trip was richer in material results than in geographical discoveries , the account of it contains a few curious particulars worthy of preservation .
__label__1	<NAME> said he played the fife .
__label__1	But it succeeded , and she asked , after a silence : ‘ Is he married ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , deary , ’ said the mother .
__label__1	<NAME> , what does it matter , after all ! ’ Having arrived at this comfortable frame of mind ( to which she had been greatly assisted by certain short interjectional remarks of the philosophical <NAME> ) , <NAME> consoled <NAME> with many kind words , and requested as a personal favour that whenever she thought of <NAME> , she would do nothing else but laugh at her , all the days of her life .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , I think , sir , ’ replied <NAME> .
__label__0	The widow ’ s fortune was considerable .
__label__0	<NAME> one among them , our friend <NAME> , for instance , been favored with a glimpse at the interior of the projectile , what would he have seen ?
__label__1	I ’ d take it by any force , I ’ d have it at any price !
__label__0	The <NAME> was at the end of <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ But it can ’ t be helped , I ’ ve done my duty , <NAME> , I have indeed .
__label__1	I know how listlessly and wearily each of that wretched pair dragged on their heavy chain through a world that was poisoned to them both .
__label__0	In order to nip the evil in the bud , he had the mutinous captains seized , and notwithstanding their reputation and the brilliancy of their past services , he made them get into a boat , and abandoned them on the shore .
__label__1	The attitude was no less familiar to her than the tone of voice had been .
__label__0	To M'Nicholl 's question : `` Why ca n't these streaks be simply prolonged mountain crests reflecting the sun 's rays more vividly by their superior altitude and comparative smoothness ? ''
__label__1	It was all the same to him .
__label__1	When it became quite dark , and they returned home , the young lady would sit down to the piano , and play some pleasant air , or sing , in a low and gentle voice , some old song which it pleased her aunt to hear .
__label__0	`` Oh no , <NAME> , certainly not , '' replied the <NAME> .
__label__1	And I find ( <NAME> ’ <NAME> said ) that in a given time a hundred thousand persons went to sea on long voyages , and only five hundred of them were drowned or burnt to death .
__label__1	I tell him again , much he cares about the truth. ’ ‘ Our connexion being at an end , Mr Boffin , ’ said the Secretary , ‘ it can be of very little moment to me what you say. ’ ‘ Oh !
__label__0	Since we are speaking of the <NAME> , we shall put the chronological order of discoveries a little on one side , that we may relate as well as those of <NAME> and <NAME> , the expeditions of <NAME> .
__label__0	Then , possessed in this hour of peril with superhuman strength , he threw himself behind it , and planting his feet on the ground , by main force placed it out of danger .
__label__0	If <NAME> had not sent <NAME> to Lucknow what misfortunes would have been averted , not to speak of the assassination of the sailor !
__label__1	Being of age now and having taken the step I have taken , I consider myself free from any accountability to <NAME> ; but <NAME> being still a ward of the court , I do n't yet ask her to renew our engagement .
__label__0	In the north of <NAME> the rainy season is in <NAME> ; in the south it occurs in March .
__label__1	Now , <NAME> , I am employed by <NAME> , <NAME> , to follow her and find her , to save her and take her his forgiveness .
__label__0	Chance at last favored them , and it was <NAME> who put them on the right track .
__label__0	`` Look sharp also after our recruits , '' added the captain .
__label__1	But he ’ s worth a dozen men , and I let him say of me whatever he likes in consequence -- he knows that. ’ In return for this complimentary address , a very gruff hoarse voice bade Mr Groves ‘ hold his noise and light a candle. ’ And the same voice remarked that the same gentleman ‘ needn ’ t waste his breath in brag , for most people knew pretty well what sort of stuff he was made of. ’ ‘ Nell , they ’ re -- they ’ re playing cards , ’ whispered the old man , suddenly interested .
__label__1	So far from asking you for interference , I merely wish to claim your strict neutrality. ’ <NAME> going on to reply , she rests her eyes again , knowing her ears to be quite enough for the contents of so weak a vessel .
__label__0	<NAME> and her daughter silently followed , and all felt an unaccountable impression of sadness , as if they had a presentiment of some coming calamity .
__label__1	The fault is mine , and only mine .
__label__0	At these words we leaped from our beds , and hurried to make our toilet .
__label__1	But although she would gladly have given him her hand and thanked him for what he had said at their last meeting , it was always a relief to find , when they came nearer to each other , that the person who approached was not he , but a stranger ; for even if she had not dreaded the effect which the sight of him might have wrought upon her fellow-traveller , she felt that to bid farewell to anybody now , and most of all to him who had been so faithful and so true , was more than she could bear .
__label__1	‘ Not on no account , ’ replied <NAME> .
__label__0	Will this means of locomotion allow us to visit those suns which swarm in the firmament ?
__label__1	But , less inexorable than iron , steel , and brass , it brought its varying seasons even into that wilderness of smoke and brick , and made the only stand that ever _was_ made in the place against its direful uniformity .
__label__1	But he told me to-night that he wished to do so in the morning. ’ ‘ Ah !
__label__1	I hate mine. ’ ‘ It was forced upon me , ’ said the gloomy <NAME> , ‘ because it was understood that we wanted a barrister in the family .
__label__0	On their way <NAME> and <NAME> were careful to preserve the wire which had been laid down by the captain between the corral and the grotto , and which might at a future time be of service .
__label__1	‘ I fear -- I hope it is not against the rules -- that she will bring the children. ’ ‘ The children ? ’ said the turnkey .
__label__0	He contented himself , therefore , with keeping the balloon at one hundred feet from the ground , and , at that elevation , a feeble current drove it toward the western horizon .
__label__1	‘ And she has been. ’ ‘ Well , sir , there were violent quarrels at first , I assure you , ’ said <NAME> ; ‘ but she is quite a shadow now .
__label__0	As for me , amused and occupied by the incidents of travel , I had begun to forget the inevitable future ; but now I was once more destined to realize the actual state of affairs .
__label__1	In the service I mentally insert <NAME> ’ s name -- I put her in among the <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ You have not been sent for ? ’ ‘ Not at all , not at all .
__label__0	When night fell , the shore was illuminated by a thousand fires , to which the crew responded by throwing rockets .
__label__1	I did MY part. ’ ‘ Excellently , ’ replied <NAME> , taking his hand .
__label__1	She had not been married many weeks , when that man 's brother saw her and admired her , and asked that man to lend her to him -- for what are husbands among us !
__label__1	‘ Will you never be a <NAME> , my dear child ! ’ said <NAME> , with pathetic reproachfulness .
__label__1	‘ I can ’ t bear to look at you .
__label__1	And when the day came on , which must remove her in her earthly shape from earthly eyes for ever , he led him away , that he might not know when she was taken from him .
__label__1	All this time , however , there hovered upon the tip of his tongue a confession that the very same objections which <NAME> had stated to the employment of his nephew in this commission applied with at least equal force and validity to himself , and a hundred times had he been upon the point of avowing the real state of his feelings , and entreating to be released from it .
__label__0	This center , formed of indefinite molecules , began to revolve around its own axis during its gradual condensation ; then , following the immutable laws of mechanics , in proportion as its bulk diminished by condensation , its rotary motion became accelerated , and these two effects continuing , the result was the formation of one principal star , the center of the nebulous mass .
__label__1	`` My dear <NAME> , '' said she , rising from her desk with her usual sweetness of temper , `` these are really ridiculous preparations , though your assisting them is a proof of your kindness .
__label__1	We have been checked -- brought up suddenly , I would say -- upon the -- shall I term it threshold ? ''
__label__0	They can not penetrate them ; the means of transport are insufficient , and the heat and disease , and savage disposition of the natives , are impassable obstacles .
__label__0	After a short excursion inland , during which they visited the huts of the natives , which were shaped like beehives , the officers and naturalists prepared to re-embark .
__label__0	<NAME> , she was resigned to what <NAME> should decide .
__label__0	He also provided means to enable MM .
__label__1	‘ You missed a friend , you know ; or you missed a foe , you know ; or you wouldn ’ t have come here , you know .
__label__1	‘ Whenever it may be necessary that you and I should have any further communication together , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ I will come back .
__label__1	My Missis as I had the hard time wi ' -- Stop though !
__label__1	Among other items , <NAME> and <NAME> , solicitors , of <NAME> , were instructed by their client <NAME> , <NAME> , to address a letter to Mr <NAME> , enclosing the sum of twenty-four pounds nine shillings and eightpence , being the amount of principal and interest computed at the rate of five per cent .
__label__0	<NAME> also showed great courage and much of that presence of mind which may justly be called `` the reasoning of bravery . ''
__label__1	‘ Ah , dear me ! ’ sighed <NAME> , giving me the tea-caddy scoop instead of her fingers .
__label__1	‘ I am not going to tread upon forbidden ground , <NAME> , ’ says <NAME> , when they have walked some distance and are turning ; ‘ you will understand in another moment that I can not help referring to—what shall I say ? —my infatuation. ’ ‘ Had you not better avoid it , <NAME> ?
__label__1	<NAME> , having nothing more to say , began to chalk , slowly and laboriously , on the table .
__label__1	‘ I am sure I shall have a good one in that case. ’ To see how Miss Squeers tossed her head , and the corn-factor flattened his nose , while this conversation was carrying on !
__label__1	The punch was ready-made in a red pan in the bedroom ; a little table , covered with a green baize cloth , had been borrowed from the parlour , to play at cards on ; and the glasses of the establishment , together with those which had been borrowed for the occasion from the public-house , were all drawn up in a tray , which was deposited on the landing outside the door .
__label__0	The bullet did its work ; it hit the animal , and , sliding off the rounded surface , was lost in two miles depth of sea .
__label__0	`` Do not let us accuse the sun , '' said <NAME> , `` it is not his fault , but that of the moon , which has come and placed herself like a screen between us and it . ''
__label__1	If they could be brought to me loose , to sort , I should hardly have the face to claim ‘ em as mine .
__label__1	I sent for you , in order that I might say -- hum -- impressively say , in the presence of Mrs General , to whom we are all so much indebted for obligingly being present among us , on -- ha -- on this or any other occasion , ’ Mrs General shut her eyes , ‘ that I -- ha hum -- am not pleased with you .

__label__1	One might have fancied he had talked it off ; and that what was left , all standing up in disorder , was in that condition from being constantly blown about by his windy boastfulness .
__label__0	Mrs. C. Hoey , 1897 ; An Antarctic Mystery , 1898 .
__label__1	There was a Mrs <NAME> lived at <NAME> before me , and perhaps you ’ re mistaking me for her .
__label__1	`` This is a truly sad time , Mr .
__label__1	But the moment <NAME> understood the full extent of his misfortune , self-preservation dictated an attempt at flight .
__label__0	Had I felt the need of talking to somebody very strongly , I might have resorted to the boatswain , who was always disposed to chatter ; but what had he to say that could interest me ?
__label__0	`` Then he must have found all that remained of the crew of the <NAME> -- my brother <NAME> and those who had survived with him ? ''
__label__0	Nothing could exceed the melancholy monotony of the hours which we passed in the midst of a fog so thick that the wind could not lift its curtain .
__label__0	On the 16th of June the jangada , after fortunately clearing several shallows in approaching the banks , arrived near the large island of <NAME> , and the following evening she stopped at the village of <NAME> , which is situated on the left side of the <NAME> .
__label__0	`` <NAME> , '' according to his narrative , `` is by far the largest sheet of water known in these regions .
__label__1	It was called <NAME> , <NAME> 's <NAME> ; and I had no other guide to <NAME> 's <NAME> than the <NAME> Rope-walk .
__label__1	'It is , ' was the reply .
__label__0	As the glasses had been returned to the watches of the engineer and reporter , <NAME> burned a little linen to serve as tinder .
__label__1	‘ Because you understand , ’ resumed the <NAME> , coming back again to enforce this charge upon his mind , ‘ there may be , for anything I can say , a chase ; and I might be took while I was waiting , if you didn ’ t show yourself smart with the door. ’ Rob again assured the Captain that he would be prompt and wakeful ; and the Captain having made this prudent arrangement , went home to Mrs <NAME> ’ s for the last time .
__label__0	A telescope-case would probably be the property of some one on board a ship ; and the figures obviously referred to the astronomical wonders that had been experienced .
__label__0	My first emotions having subsided , I found that the scene before me by no means came up to my expectations .
__label__1	By and by she tries again .
__label__1	<NAME> assented to all this , and we went out immediately after breakfast to pursue our investigations .
__label__1	That morning ’ s breakfast passed heavily off .
__label__1	‘ I can ’ t think how he can have picked up what he knows , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ unless I have committed myself -- let something drop at <NAME> ’ s , for instance -- which has been overheard .
__label__1	I had my box brought alongside me in a barrow. ” “ Are you here for good ? ” “ I ai n't here for harm , young master , I suppose ? ” I was not so sure of that .
__label__1	Although <NAME> had roused himself from sleep , he was not thoroughly awake .
__label__0	The intercourse of the explorers with the <NAME> and the inhabitants generally were all the more pleasant that it was confirmed by banquets given on land and on board the <NAME> in honour of the kings of <NAME> and the <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Hush ! ’ said <NAME> , suddenly , ‘ Edith ! ’ The loving mother can scarcely be described as resuming her insipid and affected air when she made this exclamation ; for she had never cast it off ; nor was it likely that she ever would or could , in any other place than in the grave .
__label__0	I never was your son !
__label__1	You and I may well stumble at the word , ’ returned <NAME> , laughing .
__label__0	I cried , rising in astonishment , `` did you say the tide , <NAME> ? ''
__label__0	cried <NAME> ; `` let us have more of it ! ''
__label__0	“ Let her sleep ! ” said the engineer .
__label__0	This mountain is considered one of the most difficult to cross in the whole chain .
__label__1	‘ I should rob my family , ’ he said , ‘ if I was to offer ninepence for it. ’ This was a disagreeable way of putting the business ; because it imposed upon me , a perfect stranger , the unpleasantness of asking <NAME> to rob his family on my account .
__label__0	`` If <NAME> does sometimes go on dry ground , '' said I , `` he at least chooses desert islands . ''
__label__1	I should have had the pleasure of -- of returning with <NAME> at an earlier period ; but , in the first place , we didn ’ t know the name of the relation to whose house she had gone , and , in the second , as she had left that relation ’ s and gone to another at a distance , I think that scarcely anything short of the sagacity of the <NAME> , would have found her out in the time. ’ Florence was sure of it .
__label__1	'You 're a-going to accommodate us , and wot 's to prevent my standing treat for a pint or so , in return ? '
__label__1	‘ A positive fool , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	I hope it is not self-indulgent to shed these tears as I think of it .
__label__0	Nevertheless , space was thenceforth but imperfectly lighted .
__label__0	He was one of those originals which nature sometimes invents in the freak of a moment , and of which she then breaks the mould .
__label__1	It was not alluded to in any way , and no pale young gentleman was to be discovered on the premises .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> ! ’ cried <NAME> , ‘ at <NAME> !
__label__0	Returning to <NAME> , <NAME> began to study <NAME> languages , and more especially the <NAME> , which at that time was known only through the imperfect works of <NAME> .
__label__0	The whale , having taken another breath , had dived again ; but soon it came up and projected fifteen feet into the air that combination of gases and mucous fluid which escapes from its vent-holes .
__label__1	And I do not consider , I will not consider , I can not consider , ’ said Mrs. Sparsit , with a most extensive stock on hand of honour and morality , ‘ that I _should_ be scrupulously true , if I allowed names to be mentioned under this roof , that are unfortunately—most unfortunately—no doubt of that—connected with his. ’ <NAME> knuckled his forehead again , and again begged pardon .
__label__1	But looking at the old man as he stood quiet with his head bowed and his eyes cast down , he felt that to relinquish an inch of his baldness , an inch of his grey hair , an inch of his coat-skirt , an inch of his hat-brim , an inch of his walking-staff , would be to relinquish hundreds of pounds .
__label__1	She only said , ‘ Oh , dear , dear <NAME> !
__label__1	‘ I beg your pardon ; not at all , ’ contradiction rising in him .
__label__1	That ’ s the last short speech , do you understand ? ’ Silas , released , put his hand to his throat , cleared it , and looked as if he had a rather large fishbone in that region .
__label__1	'Do you think this respectful or proper conduct , Mrs. Mann , ' inquired <NAME> , grasping his cane , 'to keep the parish officers a waiting at your garden-gate , when they come here upon porochial business with the porochial orphans ?
__label__1	Beholding him in the trim described at the conclusion of the last chapter , he stood aghast in wonder and consternation .
__label__1	What other reason could Miss Tox have for connecting Mr Dombey with her summer days and dandelion fetters ?
__label__1	It shrunk , collapsed , and dwindled down into a bedpost .
__label__1	Is it , <NAME> ? ’ A deceiving Bella she was , to look at him with that pensively abstracted air , as if her mind were full of her book , and she had not heard a single word !
__label__1	‘ After all , you haven ’ t said what you mean to do yourself , <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ What is the matter between us ? ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	The yard or two of smile on the part of the alligator might have been invested with the meaning , ‘ All about this was quite familiar knowledge down in the depths of the slime , ages ago. ’ ‘ But , ’ said <NAME> , possibly with some slight perception to the foregoing effect , ‘ your speaking countenance remarks , Mr Venus , that I ’ m duller and savager than usual .
__label__1	‘ Thank you , ’ stammered Mr Sparkler , ‘ she ’ s uncommonly well -- at least , poorly. ’ ‘ In <NAME> ? ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	The time was , sir , when my dear brother Ned and I were two poor simple-hearted boys , wandering , almost barefoot , to seek our fortunes : are we changed in anything but years and worldly circumstances since that time ?
__label__0	The following fact will give an idea of the hospitality of these people .
__label__0	<NAME> was with his master ; <NAME> was there ready to sacrifice himself for all ; <NAME> was more a farmer than he had even been a sailor ; <NAME> , who completed his studies under the superintendence of <NAME> ; and <NAME> , who founded the <NAME> , the best-informed journal in the world .
__label__0	But , happily , the breeze did not blow from that side .
__label__1	exclaimed the doctor , aghast in his turn .
__label__1	When the <NAME> had said these words , ‘ Gentlemen , we will resume our studies at seven tomorrow , ’ the pupils bowed again , and went to bed .
__label__1	( I thank my honourable friend for that cheer . )
__label__1	Judge for yourself whether any other admirer shall love you and live , whose life is in my hand. ’ ‘ What do you mean , sir ? ’ ‘ I mean to show you how mad my love is .
__label__0	Since then , he always called him Dr. Spilett .
__label__0	Thus the 3rd of <NAME> arrived , and they might calculate upon launching the vessel in ten days .
__label__0	In an instant the full horror of my situation seized me .
__label__1	`` This is a sorrowful case , '' said my guardian after asking him a question or two and touching him and examining his eyes .
__label__1	Had he come on board alone ? ” “ No. ” “ How many were with him ? ” “ Two <NAME> gentlemen. ” “ Had they conferred together ? ” “ They had conferred together until the last moment , when it was necessary for the <NAME> gentlemen to be landed in their boat. ” “ Had any papers been handed about among them , similar to these lists ? ” “ Some papers had been handed about among them , but I do n't know what papers. ” “ Like these in shape and size ? ” “ <NAME> , but indeed I do n't know , although they stood whispering very near to me : because they stood at the top of the cabin steps to have the light of the lamp that was hanging there ; it was a dull lamp , and they spoke very low , and I did not hear what they said , and saw only that they looked at papers. ” “ Now , to the prisoner 's conversation , <NAME> Manette. ” “ The prisoner was as open in his confidence with me -- which arose out of my helpless situation -- as he was kind , and good , and useful to my father .
__label__1	‘ What you will , <NAME> , ’ she answered , without turning her head , and with supreme indifference .
__label__0	Dr. <NAME> hastened to avail himself of such good fortune , and rapidly ascending resumed his aerial journey amid a long wake of golden morning sunshine .
__label__1	There was none of the noise and clamour of a schoolroom ; none of its boisterous play , or hearty mirth .
__label__1	As soon as they were established in their new residence , and her father had entered on the routine of his avocations , she arranged the little household as exactly as if her husband had been there .
__label__0	“ The courier ? ” inquired the Czar eagerly .
__label__0	<NAME> would have liked to skirt these northern lands , in order to reach the sooner <NAME> and the entrance of <NAME> ; but , much to his chagrin , the bank-ice obliged him to take only the passes to the south .
__label__1	The host smiled , disappeared , and shortly afterwards returned with a steaming jorum : of which , the first gulp brought the water into <NAME> 's eyes .
__label__0	He glanced to the right and to the left , and rapidly swung his tail .
__label__0	I think I see him everywhere. ” “ So this young man was not <NAME> ? ” “ It was not <NAME> Strogoff. ” “ Dost thou know , old woman , that I can torture thee until thou avowest the truth ? ” “ I have spoken the truth , and torture will not cause me to alter my words in any way. ” “ This <NAME> was not <NAME> ? ” asked a second time <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> computes the number of inhabitants at three millions .
__label__1	But it 's a weak chance if he 'd come , sir ! ''
__label__0	Sailors at the commencement of the century could not possibly foresee the radical changes which the introduction of this agent would produce .
__label__0	He recovered , however , and the expedition set sail again on November 25th .
__label__0	`` Well , the brig is n't in the channel yet , I fancy ! ''
__label__0	always you ! ” And <NAME> ’ s voice died away in a prolonged “ <NAME> ! ” <NAME> , after this , applied himself diligently , during all his spare time , to the work of <NAME> ’ s education .
__label__1	'Why , now she 's on the other tack ! '
__label__1	It IS a wilderness , ’ said the old man with much animation .
__label__0	By degrees , they appear to swell out , break , and gain in number what they lose in grandeur ; their heaviness is so great that they are unable to lift themselves from the horizon ; but under the influence of the upper currents of air , they are gradually broken up , become much darker , and then present the appearance of one single layer of a formidable character ; now and then a lighter cloud , still lit up from above , rebounds upon this grey carpet , and is lost in the opaque mass .
__label__1	But I will not do that .
__label__1	There would be more of an adventurous spirit in it , and consequently more of a certain sort of poetry . ''
__label__1	No one remained now but the excitable Jew , who had already raised the skirts of <NAME> 's coat to his lips several times .
__label__1	Every word he uttered had a force that no other grace could have imparted to it .
__label__0	The arsenal and forts of <NAME> being unable to supply the necessary men , stores , & c. , captains , sailors , equipment , and provisions , had to be imported from <NAME> .
__label__0	The latter , all the while swearing that he would not go , went on board with a regular arsenal of hunting weapons , among which were two double-barrelled breech-loading fowling-pieces , and a rifle that had withstood every test , of the make of <NAME> , <NAME> & <NAME> , at <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> for her father was the first distinct emotion that made head against the flood of sorrow which overwhelmed her .
__label__1	<NAME> had kept his chair all night .
__label__1	‘ I ’ m not going to sleep in the fresh air ; no , nor I ’ m not going into the country either .
__label__0	It must first be invented , then made .
__label__1	While these observations were being exchanged between <NAME> and <NAME> ; and while the boy in the gray livery , marvelling at the unwonted prolongation of the dinner , cast an anxious look , from time to time , towards the glass door , distracted by inward misgivings regarding the amount of minced veal which would be ultimately reserved for his individual cravings ; there rolled soberly on through the streets of <NAME> , a private fly , painted of a sad green colour , drawn by a chubby sort of brown horse , and driven by a surly-looking man with his legs dressed like the legs of a groom , and his body attired in the coat of a coachman .
__label__0	My master will be sending for us directly. ” “ I shan ’ t go. ” “ Oh !
__label__0	I should have thought an assassination would have better suited an assassin ’ s son ! ” “ Torres ! ” exclaimed <NAME> , “ defend yourself , or I will kill you like a mad dog ! ” “ Mad !
__label__0	Its nationality to you , at least , will be a secret .
__label__0	I tried to speak , but <NAME> stopped me by a gesture , and , picking up a piece of chalk-stone , advanced to a rock of black basalt , and traced the one word : What a light shot through my mind !
__label__0	They raised such a whirlwind of water in their course that it was impossible to distinguish them clearly .
__label__0	interrupted <NAME> ; `` it seems to me the <NAME> should not be forgotten , unless indeed it came by land , '' he added jestingly .
__label__0	It was difficulty to persuade them to leave the vessel .
__label__1	Let him call again. ’ <NAME> gave vent to his usual grunt , as much as to say ‘ I thought so ! ’ and , the ring being repeated , went to the door , whence he presently returned , ushering in , by the name of <NAME> , a pale gentleman in a violent hurry , who , with his hair standing up in great disorder all over his head , and a very narrow white cravat tied loosely round his throat , looked as if he had been knocked up in the night and had not dressed himself since .
__label__1	The reflections of Mrs. Nickleby were of the proudest and most complacent kind ; and under the influence of her very agreeable delusion she straightway sat down and indited a long letter to <NAME> , in which she expressed her entire approval of the admirable choice she had made , and extolled <NAME> to the skies ; asserting , for the more complete satisfaction of her daughter ’ s feelings , that he was precisely the individual whom she ( Mrs. Nickleby ) would have chosen for her son-in-law , if she had had the picking and choosing from all mankind .
__label__0	Can it be another projectile ? ''
__label__1	<NAME> ’ t look for him in me , at thirty shillings a week , but look for him in <NAME> , at I don ’ t know how much a year ! ’ ‘ Good ! ’ cried several voices .
__label__1	A doleful place to be born and bred in , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Yes indeed , sir ! ’ ‘ If she had constantly thought of herself , and settled with herself that everybody visited this place upon her , turned it against her , and cast it at her , she would have led an irritable and probably an useless existence .
__label__0	“ While you soar to the heights , I plunge into the depths. ” “ Fare ye well .
__label__0	asked a tall man , in a harsh voice , who , standing in the shadow , quickly threw the light of a lantern on <NAME> 's face .
__label__0	Hence the necessity of dispelling the darkness .
__label__1	‘ She has actually passed me without the slightest acknowledgment of my presence ! ’ The young lady turned and curtsied .
__label__1	Charged with this message , the fat boy returned , slumbering as peaceably in his dickey , over the stones , as if it had been a down bed on watch springs .
__label__1	In one of these pauses of invention , the scientific gentleman was gazing abstractedly on the thick darkness outside , when he was very much surprised by observing a most brilliant light glide through the air , at a short distance above the ground , and almost instantaneously vanish .
__label__1	And it was not a contest of politeness , or by any means a matter of form , for she knew very well that her husband wished to enter the house in this order , that he might have a favourable opportunity of inflicting a few pinches on her arms , which were seldom free from impressions of his fingers in black and blue colours .
__label__0	which was echoed again and again from the cliff and rocks .
__label__0	We must now leap over a period of forty years , to arrive at <NAME> de la Sale .
__label__0	We were exceedingly well received , and without taking too much advantage of the goodness of these worthy people , I should have liked very much to have rested with them after the fatigues of the journey .
__label__1	<NAME> in company , gentlemen , in God ’ s name .
__label__1	He may not have money , but he always has what is much better -- family , my dear . ''
__label__1	Although you can not be fully conscious of the villainy of this man to whom you are about to give your hand , some of his deeds you know .
__label__0	In the afternoon , <NAME> sent the lieutenant to procure water and to take possession of the island in the name of King <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Did you ever hear of the great commercial house of <NAME> & <NAME> ?
__label__1	And as our utmost endeavours could only elicit from <NAME> himself sweeping assurances that everything was going on capitally and that it really was all right at last , our anxiety was not much relieved by him .
__label__1	cried Fagin , following him hastily .
__label__0	But as in that place the channel was not more than twenty feet in depth , it was certain that the sides of the submerged brig would reappear at low water .
__label__0	I am certain as to having made no mistake .
__label__0	“ Never mind , ” said <NAME> , “ though I do not see the land , I feel it ... it is there ... there ... as sure as the fact that we are no longer at <NAME> ” But the fog was not long in rising .
__label__1	‘ It ’ s from <NAME> and <NAME> ’ s. ’ ‘ And it ’ s uncommon handsome o ’ <NAME> and <NAME> , as knows so little of me , to come down vith a present , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	And he must be buried , you know . ''
__label__1	When I got into the streets upon this Sunday morning , the air was so clear , the houses were so bright and gay : the signboards were painted in such gaudy colours ; the gilded letters were so very golden ; the bricks were so very red , the stone was so very white , the blinds and area railings were so very green , the knobs and plates upon the street doors so marvellously bright and twinkling ; and all so slight and unsubstantial in appearance—that every thoroughfare in the city looked exactly like a scene in a pantomime .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> returned no other reply than by taking the little <NAME> in her arms , and making his cockade perfectly flat and limp with her caresses .
__label__0	At last the <NAME> came into view ; and , at a quarter-past eleven in the evening of the 11th , the train stopped in the station on the right bank of the river , before the very pier of the <NAME> line .
__label__0	There were no mines to be opened , and no shafts to be driven thousands of feet into the crust of the earth .
__label__1	‘ Are you satisfied with that , or shall I finish it a little more ? ’ said <NAME> , showing the sketch to Mr Dombey .
__label__1	One other quotation from the same Preface may serve to introduce a fact that my readers may think curious .
__label__1	asked <NAME> , advancing to meet him .
__label__1	‘ But if we talk of examples to be shunned , ’ said he , ‘ if we come to boys that should be a warning and a beacon to all their fellows , here ’ s the one , and I hope you won ’ t spare him .
__label__0	I think that <NAME> , our natural leader ; the Major , who would not yield his place to anybody ; and your humble servant , <NAME> Paganel. ” “ And me , ” interrupted <NAME> .
__label__1	He sat in his usual place and attitude like a great stuffed figure .
__label__0	<NAME> was forced to acknowledge that nothing tangible had hitherto presented itself to his mind .
__label__1	‘ Tell him I am sorry that we ever met. ’ ‘ No more ? ’ said <NAME> after a pause .
__label__0	a servant who orders your dinner ; who likes what you like ; who packs your trunk , without forgetting your socks or your linen ; who has charge of your keys and your secrets , and takes no advantage of all this !
__label__0	`` That is the fate in store for our Earth ? ''
__label__1	Mrs <NAME> coughed as before , and drew lines on the carpet with the ivory end of her parasol .
__label__1	I have seen so much business done on sharp principles that , to tell you the truth , Mr <NAME> , I am tired of them. ’ Mr <NAME> laughed .
__label__1	That it is in the stare of the pictures .
__label__1	We parted , overwhelmed with grief ; and I think <NAME> enjoyed herself completely .
__label__0	The last ranks of the herd were now passing over the rails , while the first had already disappeared below the southern horizon .
__label__0	`` But if any one seizes it in our absence ? ''
__label__1	He seldom or never took the liberty of standing with his back to the fire unless he was quite alone .
__label__1	In these , the <NAME> ’ s most glaring moments of unreason , <NAME> would shut her up and knock her on the table , apostrophising her with the compliment , ‘ O you ARE a stupid old Donkey !
__label__0	The inevitable consequences of such conduct are easily comprehended ; that night the thermometer fell below -44° , and the mercury froze .
__label__0	It furnished the ships touching there , now a merchantman , now a pirate , with horses and with wild pigs , the flesh of which had a well-known reputation for delicacy of flavour .
__label__1	What I suffered from that placard , nobody can imagine .
__label__0	`` Very well then , '' said <NAME> quietly ; `` as we are safe , let us have breakfast . ''
__label__1	I was sorry presently that this was all we said about that .
__label__1	In a short pause which ensued , she had a fancy that she felt <NAME> touch her hair , and that with no ungentle hand ; but , looking at her , in her timid hope , she found that lady sitting with the skirt of her dress tucked up , her hands folded on one knee , and her feet upon the fender , frowning at the fire .
__label__1	If you would empower me to do it , I would do it for you with the greatest satisfaction ! ''
__label__1	‘ There ’ s a friend he took to very much at last .
__label__0	The descent began at twenty-five minutes past one at night , and the chamber , drawn under by the reservoirs full of water , disappeared from the surface of the ocean .
__label__1	I didn ’ t before I was married ; but I do now , because <NAME> does .
__label__0	This contrivance is much used by the <NAME> ; and when a fête is given , the host , as a matter of politeness , always presents one to each of his guests , who use them before any ceremonial banquet .
__label__1	And I might have a nice little bit of hot roast meat spoiling at home all this time -- how does HE know I haven ’ t ?
__label__0	This road , after running right down to the coast took a sudden bend in the direction of <NAME> .
__label__1	This very exacting member of the fold appeared to be endowed with a sixth sense , in regard of knowing when the <NAME> Milvey least desired her company , and with promptitude appearing in his little hall .
__label__1	This reflection would make the Captain profoundly melancholy , until the return of Mr Toots ; when he would fall to his cards again , with many side winks and nods , and polite waves of his hook at <NAME> , importing that he wasn ’ t going to do so any more .
__label__1	The letter had made no difference between us except that the seat by his side had come to be mine ; it made none now .
__label__1	Not one of them would harm you. ” “ I am not frightened for myself , my father .
__label__1	‘ The cause is too good a one to fail. ’ They arranged to proceed upon their journey next evening , as a stage-waggon , which travelled for some distance on the same road as they must take , would stop at the inn to change horses , and the driver for a small gratuity would give <NAME> a place inside .
__label__1	She was generally spoken of as ‘ a great manager ’ of children ; and the secret of her management was , to give them everything that they didn ’ t like , and nothing that they did -- which was found to sweeten their dispositions very much .
__label__1	The coach was in the yard , shining very much all over , but without any horses to it as yet ; and it looked in that state as if nothing was more unlikely than its ever going to <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> had saved <NAME> ’ s life in <NAME> ; <NAME> had rendered his master a like service in the <NAME> .
__label__0	“ But at what time , ” asked <NAME> , “ must your daughter have left the <NAME> territory ? ” “ About the same time that you did , ” replied Fedor .
__label__1	You call her Little Dorrit ? ’ No road in that direction .
__label__1	That , <NAME> , having been solemnly assured by one not then producible that <NAME> was not the son of <NAME> , and this person having offered to make oath to that effect , if necessary , they had by this communication been first led to doubt the claim set up , which they would otherwise have seen no reason to dispute , supported as it was by evidence which they had no power of disproving .
__label__0	But soon the flow completely failed them either the tide was going down , and it was about the hour , or it could no longer be felt at this distance from the mouth of the <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ How can I see any objection to such a kind offer , sir ? ’ replied <NAME> with his whole heart .
__label__1	I have had a tiring day , and I ’ ll go to bed. ’ This broke up the agreeable party .
__label__1	I do n't attach any value to money .
__label__0	I approached , and was bound to believe my own eyes .
__label__0	“ They are to cross at <NAME> , and so will we. ” “ But about <NAME> ? ” asked <NAME> .
__label__0	Nevertheless the vast hall presented a curious spectacle .
__label__1	After a few moments ’ silence , it had relaxed into its usual weak condition .
__label__1	<NAME> walk into the back shop , sir . ''
__label__1	‘ There was something behind the door , <NAME> , which perwented our getting it open , for ever so long , <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> .
__label__1	What may be called its private life was confined to the hearth , and all easy-chair , and an old-fashioned occasional round table that was brought out upon the rug after business hours , from a corner where it elsewise remained turned up like a shining mahogany shield .
__label__1	He , a broken , bankrupt , sick , dishonoured prisoner .
__label__1	‘ Whatever it be , ’ said <NAME> , flushed with anger , ‘ I shall not look to you to make it more. ’ ‘ Nicholas , my dear , recollect yourself , ’ remonstrated Mrs. Nickleby .
__label__0	Other navigators of the <NAME> seas had all halted below it .
__label__1	I see he is going to speak to you . ''
__label__1	The sadness of the scene imparted a sombre tinge to the feelings of <NAME> .
__label__0	“ <NAME> has given me a nosegay and I am quite content .
__label__0	His town had just been burnt , his generals and his best soldiers had perished in a battle with the people of <NAME> , and he himself had had a narrow escape when his house and all his treasures were destroyed by fire .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> received them with many expressions of pleasure and kindness , showing special delight at seeing <NAME> again .
__label__0	At this exclamation <NAME> opened his eyes , and , gazing at <NAME> , then at the others -- `` You ! ''
__label__0	But it is not the history of his success , but the history of his trials , which deserves to be related .
__label__0	What would be the measure of the eccentricity of its path ?
__label__1	'Your having interfered in this dear boy 's behalf before , ' said <NAME> ; 'your coming here , at so great a risk , to tell me what you have heard ; your manner , which convinces me of the truth of what you say ; your evident contrition , and sense of shame ; all lead me to believe that you might yet be reclaimed .
__label__0	To this I owed my being discovered .
__label__1	She stands looking at him as he writes on , all unconscious , and only her fluttering hands give utterance to her emotions .
__label__0	His family were rich , and having large commercial transactions they were able to encourage the taste for explorations which he showed .
__label__0	The waters of this river are still almost strangers to any craft but the native canoe .
__label__1	`` You are a good woman . ''
__label__1	It was done in a minute .
__label__1	‘ My house , ’ answered the disconsolate <NAME> , affected perhaps by its loneliness .
__label__1	They told her I was gone to seek her , and what my parting words was. ’ ‘ Is that another letter in your hand ? ’ said I .
__label__1	‘ Now , my men , ’ said the single gentleman ; ‘ you have done very well .
__label__0	“ Yes , ” replied the old <NAME> calmly .
__label__0	The intensity of the solar light and heat , too , was very seriously diminishing , although <NAME> ( being on the equator of an orb which had its axes always perpendicular to the plane in which it revolved ) enjoyed a position that gave it a permanent summer .
__label__0	The advance towards the north was less perilous than a return to the south ; it was time to think of going into winter-quarters .
__label__1	This unhappy boy , <NAME> , has been the occasion of much domestic trouble and uneasiness ; both during the lifetime of my late dear wife , and since .
__label__1	It was nearly midnight when they rushed out , wild , burning with wine , their blood boiling , and their brains on fire , to the gaming-table .
__label__1	It may prevent some persons laying under suspicion alonger me. ” “ You can say what you like , ” returned the sergeant , standing coolly looking at him with his arms folded , “ but you have no call to say it here .
__label__1	That lady seemed to think very little about it , for the supper being by this time on table , she gave her hand to <NAME> and repaired with a stately step to the left hand of <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> , who had now rejoined his master , made a wry grimace , as he thought of his magnificent , but too frail <NAME> shoes .
__label__0	April came ; <NAME> had supplies for only eighteen months .
__label__1	‘ Dear Miss Trotwood , is that all the history ? ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> across <NAME> , and so—passing from the many-coloured crowd and glittering shops—into another long main street , the <NAME> .
__label__0	The sudden calm of this portion of the ocean came , without doubt , from the ascending motion of the columns of air , while the tempest , which was a cyclone , turned rapidly about this peaceful centre .
__label__0	He first reached the small kingdom of <NAME> , the capital of which , <NAME> , comprises a thousand houses .
__label__1	The low , bad , unimpressible face is coming up from the depths of the river , or what other depths , to the surface again .
__label__1	It happened that in the street they had several times passed a dingy house , apparently empty , with bills in the windows , announcing that it was to let .
__label__0	<NAME> , however , with the recognition of his fellow-savants , to which <NAME> gave such eloquent expression in his reply to the address at his reception at the <NAME> , <NAME> consoled himself by composing songs ; and maintained until his death , which was hastened by all he had undergone , the zeal for information on all subjects , even torture , which led him to question the executioner on the scaffold of <NAME> . ''
__label__1	But , that it was hopeless to question him on that one reserved point , <NAME> , with his small eyes too near together , saw full well .
__label__0	Dates of an excellent flavour are its most valuable export .
__label__1	But just as my first impulse had been to pity her , so was his .
__label__1	‘ And you have heard , no doubt , my darling pet , ’ said <NAME> , detaining her hand , ‘ that your Papa , whom we all perfectly adore and dote upon , is to be married to my dearest Edith this day week. ’ ‘ I knew it would be very soon , ’ returned <NAME> , ‘ but not exactly when. ’ ‘ My darling <NAME> , ’ urged her mother , gaily , ‘ is it possible you have not told <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Why should I tell <NAME> ? ’ she returned , so suddenly and harshly , that Florence could scarcely believe it was the same voice .
__label__0	Why did the orchestra hurry with its harmonies ?
__label__0	`` I myself have some pretensions to playing a good game .
__label__0	As a fact there was nothing to recall me to <NAME> .
__label__0	And he does n't spare the money on the way , either : he has offered a large reward to the engineer of the <NAME> if he gets us to <NAME> well in advance of time . ''
__label__1	‘ You needn ’ t mind me. ’ ‘ To answer it in person , however inconvenient the journey , ’ pursued <NAME> , ‘ rather than by letter .
__label__1	You separated yourself from my affairs .
__label__0	`` But the print of the shoes ? ''
__label__0	They are not in such complete dependence on the <NAME> as always to contribute to his forces in war , or to pay him tribute in time of peace . ''
__label__0	In many places , hollows here and hillocks there attested great dislocations at some other period of the terrestrial mass .
__label__1	`` Since you want to know what we know , '' says she , `` I 'll tell you .
__label__1	If he is not -- and you tell me he is not ; on any pretence ; it is indifferent to me what -- my doors are shut against him henceforth , and yours , I take it for granted , are open to him. ’ To this address , my aunt had listened with the closest attention , sitting perfectly upright , with her hands folded on one knee , and looking grimly on the speaker .
__label__1	It was impossible to escape the observation of them , for he showed them whenever he spoke ; and bore so wide a smile upon his countenance ( a smile , however , very rarely , indeed , extending beyond his mouth ) , that there was something in it like the snarl of a cat .
__label__1	By degrees , however , as some of it cleared away through the open door , an assemblage of heads , as confused as the noises that greeted the ear , might be made out ; and as the eye grew more accustomed to the scene , the spectator gradually became aware of the presence of a numerous company , male and female , crowded round a long table : at the upper end of which , sat a chairman with a hammer of office in his hand ; while a professional gentleman with a bluish nose , and his face tied up for the benefit of a toothache , presided at a jingling piano in a remote corner .
__label__1	The childish feet of long ago , did not tread such enchanted ground as theirs do now .
__label__1	Mr Carker the Manager treats no one ; neither is he treated ; but alone in his own room he shows his teeth all day ; and it would seem that there is something gone from Mr <NAME> ’ s path -- some obstacle removed -- which clears his way before him .
__label__1	‘ If that is all you want , ’ said <NAME> , pointing to the pen , and smiling , in spite of himself , at the affected embarrassment of the schoolmaster ’ s daughter , ‘ perhaps I can supply his place. ’ Miss Squeers glanced at the door , as if dubious of the propriety of advancing any nearer to an utter stranger ; then round the schoolroom , as though in some measure reassured by the presence of forty boys ; and finally sidled up to <NAME> and delivered the pen into his hand , with a most winning mixture of reserve and condescension .
__label__0	It was evident that he was no longer sustained by his moral energy , which had lost the power of reaction against his physical weakness .
__label__1	That 's my mother. ” “ Oh ! ” said he , coming back .
__label__1	<NAME> , and stream , and meadow , and summer days , shone brightly in her view , and there was no dark tint in all the sparkling picture .
__label__0	The word <NAME> , of <NAME> origin , signifies _grass plain_ , and justly applies to the whole region .
__label__0	“ <NAME> o ’ clock , ” replied <NAME> .
__label__0	His eye was steady , lively , rapid in its changes .
__label__1	It is a partnership affair , a money-speculation .
__label__0	The <NAME> detachment was now not more than fifty paces behind him .
__label__1	I was to go abroad .
__label__1	It is most unfortunate for me that I wish you to see me at my best , and that I know you see me at my worst. ’ She moved slowly on when he paused , and he moved slowly on beside her .
__label__1	<NAME> was at first inclined to be surprised that the <NAME> should attach importance to conversations apparently so trivial ; but feeling assured that they must have some hidden purpose , he set himself to consider what it was likely to be .
__label__0	The <NAME> , a frigate of eighteen guns , was equipped at <NAME> at the latter end of 1768 , and placed under command of <NAME> d'Eveux de <NAME> , known later as Caret-de Fleurien .
__label__1	‘ Fill your glass , and pass the wine , ’ said the indefatigable visitor .
__label__1	My life has been passed in this poor prison , and my teaching has been very defective ; but let me implore you to remember later and better days .
__label__0	The first beat of the hammer on the bell awoke me from my dreams .
__label__0	Consequently , even before the train had stopped , the doors were opened , and the panic-stricken passengers thought only of getting out of the carriages .
__label__0	Game was so scarce that for four days the explorers were without food .
__label__0	It was the Major who was the medium of communication between these two souls , evidently made for each other .
__label__0	All the carpenter ’ s work that was needed was to clear some trees of their branches : this was a business of some days .
__label__1	It was the more questionable justice , <NAME> thought , in the <NAME> , from his having certainly overheard that great authority give his assent on the previous evening , to the proposition ( stated by <NAME> ) that poor dear little <NAME> was more old-fashioned than ever .
__label__1	‘ Oh , <NAME> , ’ says <NAME> , ‘ when I looked in to have a little lesson with the children just now , I got the message that you left for me ; and as soon as I could recover my spirits at all , I came on after you .
__label__0	The chiefs themselves could not withhold that mark of respect .
__label__1	I wish I could think it was only manner -- I hope it may be -- ’ ( Here the affectionate relative heaved a deep sigh , and shook her head despondingly ) .
__label__1	‘ You have forgotten the water , sir , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	The reporter could not affirm it , but he and his companions almost despaired of the result .
__label__1	On one occasion , when an execution had just been put in , coming home through some chance as early as six o ’ clock , I saw her lying ( of course with a twin ) under the grate in a swoon , with her hair all torn about her face ; but I never knew her more cheerful than she was , that very same night , over a veal cutlet before the kitchen fire , telling me stories about her papa and mama , and the company they used to keep .
__label__0	Nevertheless , it has seldom happened to me to sleep so well as I did on that particular night .
__label__0	<NAME> stole around behind some clumps of shrubbery , while <NAME> remained motionless where he was .
__label__1	If there was only one man with a wooden leg what a property he ’ d be ! ’ ‘ So he would ! ’ observed the landlord and <NAME> both together .
__label__0	It was composed of <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> .
__label__0	It was a canoe seventy feet long , five broad , and three deep ; the prow raised like that of a <NAME> gondola , and the whole hollowed out of a trunk of a kahikatea .
__label__0	If we had started when there was an eclipse of the moon , all our passage would have been in the shadow , which would have been a pity . ''
__label__0	Half an hour was passed in terrible anxiety .
__label__0	`` Here is another indisputable example .
__label__1	I am not much used to parties ; but this is one of business , and such fooleries are an important part of it sometimes .
__label__1	She felt so afraid of her husband , that being on the staircase , she had not the power to retreat to her room ( which she might easily have done before he had fastened the door ) , but stood there staring .
__label__1	Does she go out to shun her <NAME> , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ La bless you , no , <NAME> ’ am .
__label__0	The graceful creatures , snuffing danger in the breeze , seemed to be disturbed and uneasy .
__label__0	They took them , looked at them as if they had never seen such things before , and threw them aside with an angry air . ''
__label__1	However , you did not. ’ ‘ I meant to have acknowledged it when I first came in this evening , sir. ’ ‘ Not a business-like acknowledgment , ’ returned <NAME> ; ‘ however , let that pass .
__label__1	All further inquiries were superseded by the appearance of old <NAME> , who , running upstairs and just recognising <NAME> , passed at once into <NAME> ’ s room .
__label__0	If I have no faults now , I shall soon get like everybody else .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> has gone for an airing on the <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ He was there once before , ’ said my aunt presently .
__label__0	The shore at this place was composed of fine sand interspersed here and there with little sandy hillocks , behind which were scattered `` groves and very thick forests which were wonderfully pleasant to look upon . ''
__label__0	`` They measured no fewer than a thousand and ninety-five lunar mountains and crater summits with a perfect success .
__label__1	No sense reported anything unusual there .
__label__1	He is among us ! ” “ Among us ! ” from the universal throat again .
__label__1	The stranger , however , picking up her cap with an air of gallantry , interposed .
__label__0	And this had brought him to his present state , this was the source of his passionate pity for the fate of the imaginary shipwrecked mariners !
__label__1	About five-and-twenty boys were studiously engaged at their books when we went in , but they rose to give the Doctor good morning , and remained standing when they saw <NAME> and me .
__label__1	They all returned his look .
__label__1	But as the Jew , looking back , waved his hand to intimate that he preferred being alone ; and , moreover , as the little man could not very easily disengage himself from the chair ; the sign of the <NAME> was , for a time , bereft of the advantage of <NAME> 's presence .
__label__0	<NAME> , stones , twisted branches , wet clay , closed up the galleries open to the south winds .
__label__1	Shortly afterwards , <NAME> appeared , looking lovely , <NAME> thought ; and attired in such a number of skirts that it was quite an excursion to walk round her .
__label__1	It appeared on the whole , to <NAME> herself , that this same society in which they lived , greatly resembled a superior sort of <NAME> .
__label__1	Let 's see ; there 's <NAME> , one ; <NAME> , two ; Blackfriars , three ; <NAME> , four ; Westminster , five ; <NAME> , six. ” He had checked off each bridge in its turn , with the handle of his safe-key on the palm of his hand .
__label__0	Between the 22d and 42d degrees the <NAME> soil slopes eastward , and all the travelers had to do was to follow the slope right down to the sea .
__label__0	And how could her presence at the bay facilitate our means of getting there ? ” <NAME> waited an instant before answering , and then said , rather evasively : “ I have no wish to obtrude my opinions .
__label__1	Sitting beside him , I made a pretence of working for my dear , as he had always been used to joke about my being busy .
__label__1	His mother was on the stage. ’ ‘ Was she ? ’ rejoined <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Not contented , <NAME> , ’ said Mr Chuckster , ‘ with making friends with <NAME> , he has cultivated the acquaintance of his father and mother .
__label__1	She shook her head as if she had not derived all the comfort she had fondly expected from this interview , but thanked him nevertheless for the trouble he had kindly taken .
__label__1	It would be easier for the weakest poltroon that lives , to erase himself from existence , than to erase one letter of his name or crimes from the knitted register of <NAME> Defarge. ” There was a murmur of confidence and approval , and then the man who hungered , asked : “ Is this rustic to be sent back soon ?
__label__0	`` Besides , '' <NAME> went on , `` let us consider the result .
__label__0	The rainy season had commenced , and it would soon be impossible to travel otherwise than by boat .
__label__1	‘ I didn ’ t know it would be so ; it was impossible for me to foresee it .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> eyed him intently as he turned from the bottom line of the first page to the top line of the second , and from the bottom of the second to the top of the third , and from the bottom of the third to the top of the fourth ; but not the slightest alteration of countenance afforded a clue to the feelings with which he received the announcement of his son ’ s marriage , which <NAME> knew was in the very first half-dozen lines .
__label__1	I thought he would be more glad if I came upon him with his breakfast , in that unexpected manner , so I went forward softly and touched him on the shoulder .
__label__0	<NAME> with the Indians soon commenced , and the most rigorous honesty prevailed .
__label__1	The man in uniform whom he had sent to fetch this equipage then handed him up a dark lantern at his request , and when he had given a few directions to the driver , we rattled away .
__label__0	Nevertheless , the brig put out slowly into the ice-streams , while the ice crushed noisily against her bows ; the packs at this time were six or seven feet thick ; it was necessary carefully to avoid them , for if the ship should try to withstand them , it ran the risk of being lifted half out of the water and cast on her beam-ends .
__label__1	It is far better to lie down at night beneath an open sky like that yonder -- see how bright it is -- than to rest in close rooms which are always full of care and weary dreams .
__label__1	As I trusted that I might have sufficient influence with <NAME> to prevent her taking any very rash step if I fully accepted the confidence she was so willing to place in me , poor girl , I proposed that she and I and <NAME> should go to the academy and afterwards meet my guardian and <NAME> at <NAME> 's , whose name I now learnt for the first time .
__label__1	I am not , as I hope you are aware , a governess -- ’ ‘ O dear no ! ’ said Mr Dorrit .
__label__0	`` We shall see you at work , '' answered <NAME> ; `` I 'll gladly eat it , <NAME> . ''
__label__1	<NAME> nodded , and <NAME> the elder gave vent to an extraordinary sound , which , being neither a groan , nor a grunt , nor a gasp , nor a growl , seemed to partake in some degree of the character of all four .
__label__1	There was a snap of cold , last week .
__label__1	'Am I to go with you ? '
__label__0	If its speed had been enormous , he could have understood that the fall would not have taken place ; but , with a relatively moderate speed , that resistance to the moon 's attraction could not be explained .
__label__0	`` First of all , my friend , '' answered <NAME> , `` every aerolite does not fall to the earth ; it is only a small proportion which do so ; and if we had passed into an aerolite , it does not necessarily follow that we should ever reach the surface of the moon . ''
__label__1	Here <NAME> is much dismayed by the graces and accomplishments of his nieces that are and by the beauty of <NAME> , his niece that is to be , and by the affectionate salutations of these young ladies , which he receives in a sort of dream .
__label__1	‘ I an ’ t a talker , ’ replied the other .
__label__0	And then he had the curiosity to examine this flaw with a strong magnifier which he unscrewed from one of the telescopes .
__label__1	' A few -- a very few -- will suffice , <NAME> , ' said the young man , drawing his chair towards her .
__label__1	Not that there is any scarcity of far better and more endearing and more accomplished girls than I am ; not that I am much , but that they have made so much of me ! ’ <NAME> ’ s affectionate heart was overcharged , and she sobbed while she pictured what would happen .
__label__1	<NAME> , <NAME> , was balancing himself on two legs of an office stool , spearing a wafer-box with a penknife , which he dropped every now and then with great dexterity into the very centre of a small red wafer that was stuck outside .
__label__0	The launch was unloaded ; <NAME> and <NAME> put the sledge together ; all its parts were in good condition .
__label__0	`` Yes , madam ; but circumstances have been against me .
__label__0	The doctor , when he saw all the signs of winter 's approach , became very uneasy ; he knew the difficulties <NAME> had found in getting to <NAME> 's <NAME> , after leaving his ship ; and indeed , having once tried to pass the ice , he was obliged to return to his ship , and go into winter-quarters for the fourth year ; but he had at least a shelter against the weather , food , and fuel .
__label__0	His detachment of the weight is really the starting point for every new improvement in sounding gear .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> understood her quite as well as if she had said a thousand .
__label__1	`` There must have been great intellectual friction going on there under the auspices of such a man ! ''
__label__0	The inhabitants have no food but batatas , and when they run short they are obliged to live upon a little tree called `` achupalla , '' for which they have to contend with the bear of the Andes .
__label__1	Having darkened the window , and straightened the pieces of carpet on the floor , the <NAME> surveyed these preparations with great delight , and descended to the little parlour again , to bring <NAME> to her bower .
__label__0	`` My father has some secret cause of trouble , that I can not even guess , '' replied <NAME> , as a sad anxiety spread over her face .
__label__0	It was indeed the boat which <NAME> had stolen , and it was simply smashed to pieces ; in a word , only the formless wreckage of a craft which has been flung against rocks by the sea , remained .
__label__0	I became alarmed , and determined to discover what were our resources .
__label__0	And he drew quickly back , gliding like a savage into the thickest underwood .
__label__1	It was a consequence of his playing the accompaniment without notes , and of her being a heedless little creature , very apt to go wrong , that he followed her lips most attentively , with his eyes as well as hands ; carefully and softly hinting the key-note from time to time .
__label__0	It led him into an `` immense rotunda lighted from the top , and ending in an arched vault , at least sixty feet high .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> , leaving to his son everything that referred to the commercial side of the expedition , kept himself principally to his room , thinking and writing .
__label__1	`` I do n't expect nothink at all , sir , much , but that 's the true hist'ry on it . ''
__label__1	A prison taint was on everything there .
__label__0	The most absolute silence reigned around him ; a light wind shook the tree-tops and gently rocked the car , inviting the hunter to taste the sleep that stole over him in spite of himself .
__label__0	The act of fidelity and homage was accompanied , as may be easily imagined , with presents both rich and numerous , as well as by a heavy tax which was levied without much difficulty .
__label__1	I was sitting in front of the box one night with <NAME> , and <NAME> was in the place he liked best , behind <NAME> 's chair , when , happening to look down into the pit , I saw <NAME> , with his hair flattened down upon his head and woe depicted in his face , looking up at me .
__label__1	It hid in doorways too , rubbing its horrible shoulders against doors , and drawing them up to its ears , as if it were laughing .
__label__1	To whomsoever the head had originally belonged , <NAME> would have regarded it as a personal favour if he had not cut quite so many teeth .
__label__0	They had suffered a thousand privations and been exposed to a thousand dangers in the midst of these barbarous negro tribes .
__label__1	Never , since I have been here ! ''
__label__1	Reflects Mrs Veneering ; fair , aquiline-nosed and fingered , not so much light hair as she might have , gorgeous in raiment and jewels , enthusiastic , propitiatory , conscious that a corner of her husband ’ s veil is over herself .
__label__1	But , it was the old scared lost look that troubled <NAME> ; and through his absent manner of clasping his head and drearily wandering away into his own room when they got up-stairs , <NAME> was reminded of Defarge the wine-shop keeper , and the starlight ride .
__label__0	<NAME> came on ; the train passed on at full speed , in the midst of the roaring of the tigers , bears , and wolves which fled before the locomotive ; and the marvels of <NAME> , <NAME> ruined <NAME> , <NAME> , the ancient capital , <NAME> , <NAME> , and the <NAME> town of <NAME> , where <NAME> would have been proud to see his country 's flag flying , were hidden from their view in the darkness .
__label__1	He believed that Mr <NAME> was disposed to entertain a ripe regard for him , and he knew that he had a sincere regard for Mr Meagles and his good wife .
__label__1	`` I am sorry , with all my heart , to find you so resolute .
__label__0	On the <NAME> men 's hearts never fail them .
__label__0	But the industry of these people was especially shown in the construction of their pirogues .
__label__0	`` Let me tell you you are wrong , <NAME> ; for the well-being of all is at stake , and the captain 's imprudence may cost us all dear . ''
__label__0	This question seemed a very hard one .
__label__1	<NAME> had scarcely settled herself on a little heap of straw in one corner , when she fell asleep , for the first time that day .
__label__1	What more can I say for you than that I know you deserve her !
__label__1	In a kind of heedlessness , for which I can not blame myself enough , I have , I have no doubt , mentioned Mr Carker the <NAME> much oftener than was necessary ; and have allowed his name sometimes to slip through my lips , when it was against your expressed wish .
__label__1	Could I ever be happy again , <NAME> ? ’ Despite his vexation and concern , <NAME> could scarcely help smiling , as he rejoined , ‘ Now , do you think , mother , that such a result would be likely to ensue from the most cruel repulse ? ’ ‘ Upon my word , my dear , I don ’ t know , ’ returned Mrs. Nickleby ; ‘ really , I don ’ t know .
__label__1	`` My dear friend , I am afraid he will , '' returns the old man , looking up at him like a pygmy .
__label__0	“ It is the wind , ” said he .
__label__1	The sun came proudly up in all his majesty , the noble river ran its winding course , the leaves quivered and rustled in the air , the birds poured their cheerful songs from every tree , the short-lived butterfly fluttered its little wings ; all the light and life of day came on ; and , amidst it all , and pressing down the grass whose every blade bore twenty tiny lives , lay the dead man , with his stark and rigid face turned upwards to the sky .
__label__1	It would kill me if I saw her too soon. ” Sometimes , it was given in a tender rain of tears , and then it was , “ Take me to her. ” Sometimes it was staring and bewildered , and then it was , “ I do n't know her .
__label__1	The truth is , that the old lady ’ s evidently increasing admiration was <NAME> ’ s principal inducement for going away .
__label__1	‘ May I ask , ’ said I , ‘ without any hazard of repeating the mistake , how my old friends <NAME> and <NAME> are ? ’ ‘ Miss Wickfield , ’ said <NAME> , now turning red , ‘ is , as she always is , a pattern , and a bright example .
__label__0	<NAME> again began to hope .
__label__1	And their assembled friends being not a bit behindhand , roared out lustily .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> was now on board the ‘ Duncan , ’ but <NAME> was there also .
__label__1	She must be well brought up , and well guarded from reposing any foolish confidences where they are not deserved .
__label__1	`` My dear <NAME> , '' said my guardian , `` I have long had something in my thoughts that I have wished to say to you . ''
__label__1	He appeared to have a very extraordinary and miscellaneous connection , and very odd calls he made , some at great rich houses , and some at small poor ones , but all upon one subject : money .
__label__1	Regularly every Sunday , morning and afternoon , she occupied the same seat with the boy at her side ; and though they were both poorly dressed -- much more so than many of their neighbours who were in a lower station -- they were always neat and clean .
__label__1	'Wounded desperate , miss , ' replied <NAME> , with indescribable complacency .
__label__1	<NAME> me. ’ As <NAME> progressed in his explanation , <NAME> ’ s countenance grew more and more dignified .
__label__1	There are no ends of ways of leaving here .
__label__1	Nor was the atmosphere quite free from zephyr whisperings of the thirty beds which had just been cleared away , and of which we were further and more pressingly reminded by the occasional appearance on the table-cloth of a kind of <NAME> , not mentioned in the <NAME> of <NAME> .
__label__0	The addition of a couple of iron runners would be all that was requisite to convert it into an excellent sledge , which , if a sail were hoisted , might be deemed certain to make a rapid progress over the smooth surface of the ice .
__label__0	“ We must get rid of the cylinder-chests , the spiral , and the <NAME> battery .
__label__1	`` And a nice brother he is -- half-brother I mean to say .
__label__0	At length , at about six o'clock in the evening , a shapeless vapor appeared at a little height above the level of the sea ; it looked like a puff of smoke ; the sky was perfectly cold , so this vapor was no cloud ; it would keep appearing and disappearing , as if it were in commotion .
__label__1	There ’ s something moving in the name .
__label__1	She will never believe it of him , but he has cut away and left her. ’ ‘ Pray , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ why will she never believe it of him ? ’ ‘ Because those two were one .
__label__1	But the heart is the bird .
__label__0	I shortly stated what I required , and the chatib seconded me , though not with the zeal that I might have wished .
__label__0	`` At any rate , it makes very little difference to us , '' said <NAME> .
__label__1	I think not at all , <NAME> , '' he returned with an effort .
__label__0	`` We are floating on its surface , friend Ned . ''
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> looked mildly at <NAME> , and said -- ‘ I should like to speak to you in private .
__label__0	`` Whales have been known to go thousands of miles with a harpoon in the side , and this one might even have been struck in the north of the <NAME> and come to die in the south of the <NAME> , and it would be nothing astonishing . ''
__label__1	Little Dorrit timidly said Yes , she believed so ; and resumed : ‘ -- Had gone on to those who were expecting him , and that this remembrance was stolen or kept back from nobody .
__label__1	But I AM such a nasty little thing ! ’ ‘ My dear ! ’ urged <NAME> again .
__label__0	M. Fridriksson was not present , and I was afterwards sorry to hear that he and the governor did not agree on some matters connected with the administration of the island .
__label__1	I have little hope that my poor boy will ever read these words , or gladden your eyes with the sight of his frank face any more. ” No , no ; no more , ’ said <NAME> , sorrowfully meditating ; ‘ no more .
__label__0	Hearing that <NAME> was looking for a servant , and that his life was one of unbroken regularity , that he neither travelled nor stayed from home overnight , he felt sure that this would be the place he was after .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> 's opinion was that the temperature would become more mild by degrees as they approached the pole .
__label__0	`` Not for a moment ; for what is true of the eastern coast of <NAME> is not true of the western coast , which has a higher temperature .
__label__0	<NAME> noticed that of the two reporters <NAME> alone had rejoined the steamer .
__label__0	Like them they are entirely naked , if we except some ornaments of shells which they attach to their arms and legs .
__label__1	I know this in much the same way , I suppose .
__label__0	A rope leads to the ground .
__label__1	In a similar anticipation of life afloat , and in the <NAME> , <NAME> , instead of helping Mrs. Micawber and his eldest son and daughter to punch , in wine-glasses , which he might easily have done , for there was a shelf-full in the room , served it out to them in a series of villainous little tin pots ; and I never saw him enjoy anything so much as drinking out of his own particular pint pot , and putting it in his pocket at the close of the evening .
__label__0	The major could scarcely restrain himself from cursing their destiny .
__label__0	In 1509 Juan Diaz de <NAME> , in concert with <NAME> , discovered a vast province , since known by the name of <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> was the result of my strenuous effort to resist his iron will .
__label__0	Without allowing himself to be disconcerted by an incident which he regarded as a simple contretemps , <NAME> proceeded in the direction of <NAME> , where after a day and a half 's journey he met <NAME> , travelling with the <NAME> caravan .
__label__0	The adventurer , seated opposite to <NAME> , who was always taciturn , listened to all that was said , but took no part in the conversation .
__label__0	The ships were surrounded by a crowd of pirogues , and every variety of fruit was exchanged for glass beads .
__label__0	We must now say a few words on the stay at <NAME> .
__label__1	I ’ m very much obliged to you ! ’ ‘ Grateful soul ! ’ cried the dwarf .
__label__0	“ In fact , <NAME> , ” he said in conclusion , “ I am here to inquire whether you and your friends would be disposed to join us in our present quarters. ” “ I am obliged to you , <NAME> , ” answered the major stiffly ; “ but we have not the slightest intention of abandoning our post .
__label__0	In fact , as regards practical effect , the transit described by the ball ought to be as extended as possible , and this tension could only be obtained under the condition that the projectile should be impelled with a very great initial velocity .
__label__1	That made me think of all my past life ; and that brought me , as it ought to have done before , into a better condition .
__label__1	It was a large house , but one of broken fortunes ; for the spacious offices were little used , their walls were damp and mossy , their windows broken , and their gates decayed .
__label__1	I congratulate you on your feathers .
__label__0	With the beginning of the year 1866 the heat was very great , but the hunting in the forests did not stand still .
__label__1	I went out of my senses immediately ; became a mere driveller next day , on receipt of a little lace-edged sheet of note-paper , ‘ Favoured by papa .
__label__1	When shall we look upon his like again ?
__label__1	At first , they were read as D. I. C. ; but , on being more carefully examined , the last letter was found to be G. There was no record or legend of any prisoner with those initials , and many fruitless guesses were made what the name could have been .
__label__1	He added in a low voice , ‘ With my tiddle tol toor rul ’ -- when he was providentially stopped by <NAME> , who announced : ‘ <NAME> ! ’ And enter that fair enslaver , with a blue nose and indescribably frosty face , referable to her being very thinly clad in a maze of fluttering odds and ends , to do honour to the ceremony .
__label__1	As we leave the same day , will you -- will you take me somewhere that morning , <NAME> -- early -- before we go to church ? ’ <NAME> seemed to understand her , as so true a lover so truly loved should , and confirmed his ready promise with a kiss -- with more than one perhaps , or two or three , or five or six ; and in the grave , peaceful evening , <NAME> was very happy .
__label__1	Having settled this point to the perfect satisfaction of all parties , concerned and unconcerned , we sat down round the fire in the ladies ’ cabin—just to try the effect .
__label__0	A Struggle of Generosity. -- The Last Sacrifice. -- The <NAME> Apparatus. -- <NAME> ’ s Adroitness. -- Midnight. -- The <NAME> ’ s Watch. -- <NAME> ’ s Watch. -- The <NAME> falls asleep at his Post. -- The Fire. -- The <NAME> of the Natives. -- Out of <NAME> .
__label__1	In trickery , evasion , procrastination , spoliation , botheration , under false pretences of all sorts , there are influences that can never come to good .
__label__0	<NAME> over , Harding and his companions left <NAME> and returned to the beach .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> was overwhelmed by this new complication .
__label__1	It was a great dim , shabby pile , with high old oaken pews , among which about a score of people lost themselves every Sunday ; while the clergyman ’ s voice drowsily resounded through the emptiness , and the organ rumbled and rolled as if the church had got the colic , for want of a congregation to keep the wind and damp out .
__label__1	There is a dusty old pew-opener who only keeps herself , and finds that quite enough to do .
__label__0	He maintained that it was absolutely impossible to impress upon any body whatever a velocity of 12,000 yards per second ; that even with such a velocity a projectile of such a weight could not transcend the limits of the earth 's atmosphere .
__label__1	“ Yes , ” repeated the stranger , looking round at the rest of the company with his right hand extended towards the witness , <NAME> .
__label__1	Have YOU ever done anything , sir ? ’ ( turning to his nephew . )
__label__1	The gentleman who was spreading the marmalade returned , without looking up from that occupation , ‘ What did he call the <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Called him Lovely , ’ said the other gentleman .
__label__0	The chamberlain , the gold horn blower , the captain of the messengers , the captain for royal executions , the captain of the market , the keeper of the royal burying-ground , and the master of the bands , sat surrounded by a retinue and splendour which bespoke the dignity and importance of their offices .
__label__0	To dwell upon it ourselves would be to exceed the limits we laid down for our work .
__label__1	It ’ s made out of a boat ! ’ ‘ Made out of a boat , is it ? ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	We have said in walked <NAME> , but the statement is not distinguished by our usual scrupulous adherence to fact .
__label__0	“ Because they think that they are certain to take us , ” replied the doctor ; “ and , they will succeed if we descend much farther .
__label__0	But his services are not the less real , and are of such a nature that only a man possessed of prodigious power , could render them .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> was buried on the coast .
__label__0	Suddenly she heard , in the shade , a voice murmur in her ears , -- `` <NAME> , dear <NAME> !
__label__1	It is the boat we wait for !
__label__1	And he was so modest , too .
__label__1	‘ A charming subject of reflection for you , very charming .
__label__1	It was a passionate , loving , thankful , womanly action , but the hand made no response -- dropped cold and heavy , and took to its knitting again .
__label__1	I saw her , not a minute before you came up , pass in at that door. ’ The old man looked at him attentively .
__label__1	'Then my aunt invests you with full power , ' said <NAME> , smiling through her tears ; 'but pray do n't be harder upon the poor fellows than is indispensably necessary . '
__label__1	‘ I have not the smallest doubt it ’ s the fame of the phenomenon -- that ’ s the man ; him in the great-coat and no shirt-collar .
__label__0	All these questions presented themselves simultaneously to the minds of the colonists , but how could they be answered ?
__label__1	When he came to bid us good-bye , he brought his mother with him for the first time .
__label__1	Now , what do you say -- eh ! -- now -- come -- what do you say to that -- an ’ t you sorry you took so much trouble for nothing ?
__label__1	Five of 'em strung up in a row , and none left to play booty , or turn white-livered ! '
__label__0	It happened also , on the 23rd of November , that <NAME> made a joyful discovery .
__label__1	`` Why , indeed , sir , unless it is to cool her down ! ''
__label__0	<NAME> , I wish to speak with you -- alone ! ” The engineer ’ s companions , respecting the wish , retired .
__label__1	I have determined to remove this weight from my mind .
__label__0	But the making of a new axis was possible—it may be said easy—if the engineers only had the fulcrum dreamt of by <NAME> and the lever imagined by <NAME> .
__label__1	He sought to raise himself a little .
__label__1	Also how she had seen a countess and a lord some days before , and how the lord `` was much about as tall as <NAME> ; '' at which <NAME> pulled up his collars so high that you could n't have seen his head if you had been there .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> knew Dr. <NAME> personally , and guaranteed the intrepidity of his dauntless friend .
__label__1	They received an early visit from <NAME> , who led that extensive department of life in the <NAME> that winter ; and the skilful manner in which she and <NAME> fenced with one another on the occasion , almost made her quiet sister wink , like the glittering of small-swords .
__label__1	He ’ s a pleasant wretch , but he wants principle. ’ ‘ What were you doing for <NAME> ? ’ asked <NAME> .
__label__1	You came down here , sir , to expose the treachery and falsehood of an individual on whose truth and honour you had placed implicit reliance -- eh ? ’ Here <NAME> indulged in a prolonged sneer ; and taking off his green spectacles -- which he probably found superfluous in his fit of jealousy -- rolled his little eyes about , in a manner frightful to behold .
__label__0	“ A pound of coffee , old <NAME> ?
__label__0	“ We must attack the dyke , ” said <NAME> , raising his pick ; “ for at the other side of the break , at more or less depth , we shall assuredly find the vein , the existence of which I assert. ” “ And was it on the surface of these rocks that you found out the fire-damp ? ” asked <NAME> .
__label__1	It was an immense and solid building , erected at a vast expense .
__label__0	But to get into the office and up to the clerk ’ s little window was a much more difficult business .
__label__0	Their turbans are not large , but are very high and flattened in front .
__label__0	They were too surely the first victims of the frenzied natives .
__label__1	Be seated , <NAME> , I beg , <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> , woman , have you found what you want yet ? ’ She had been collecting sheets and blankets from a press , and hastened to gather them up , and to reply , ‘ Yes , Jeremiah. ’ <NAME> helped her by carrying the load himself , wished the old man good night , and went up-stairs with her to the top of the house .
__label__0	[ Illustration ] Hatteras could not depend on his blasting-cylinders of eight or ten pounds of powder , whose action would have been insignificant against such large masses ; they were only of use to break the field-ice ; hence he placed in the opening a thousand pounds of powder , carefully laying it where it should be of the utmost service .
__label__1	When should I awaken the heart within her that was mute and sleeping now ?
__label__0	While these events were taking place , another boat , laden with fifteen armed men , came alongside the <NAME> , and took possession of her without any resistance from the sailors , surprised by the rapidity of the action .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> had regularly assisted at our councils , with a meditative and sage demeanour .
__label__0	“ Indeed , ” said he , “ the fact of anyone endeavoring to influence my resolution , shows that <NAME> ’ s communication must be of great importance .
__label__0	The liquefied substances soon after reached the bottom of the barrier .
__label__1	He is journeying to-day into the iron country farther north to look about him .
__label__1	She surmised , she said , that Mr <NAME> had lost better and higher opportunities by marrying his pretty wife ; and Love in a cottage , painting pictures for dinner , was so delightfully interesting , that she begged her papa to give him the commission whether he could paint a likeness or not : though indeed both she and <NAME> knew he could , from having seen a speaking likeness on his easel that day , and having had the opportunity of comparing it with the original .
__label__1	‘ You know what I mean , do you , <NAME> ? ’ inquired <NAME> , looking hard at him , through the spectacles .
__label__0	`` Perhaps no one looked after this timepiece .
__label__1	“ You are right , ” he returned .
__label__1	Mrs <NAME> attributed certain views of furthering the marriage to my friend here , in conversation with me before it took place ; and I endeavoured to undeceive her .
__label__1	‘ So you vouldn ’ t subscribe to the flannel veskits ? ’ said <NAME> , after another interval of smoking .
__label__0	“ My friends , except from cold , we have nothing to fear .
__label__1	I knew how quick she always was to divine the truth , and that she would never be the first to breathe his name .
__label__0	The influence to which the priests of <NAME> had subjected <NAME> began gradually to yield , and she became more herself , so that her fine eyes resumed all their soft <NAME> expression .
__label__0	Approaching the window , <NAME> saw with much surprise a sort of flattened bag floating in space and only a few yards off .
__label__1	She has a lover , who has followed her , first all the way from <NAME> , and then all the way from <NAME> , and who has just confided to me that he means to follow her everywhere .
__label__1	May I hold the pens ? ’ The remembrance of her pretty joy when I said yes , brings tears into my eyes .
__label__1	There was some secret , sure perception between them , which set them against one another in all ways .
__label__0	Every now and then I paused to discover if any loud appeal was made to me , well knowing that in that dense and intensified atmosphere I should hear it a long way off .
__label__0	“ And you would have done better to have accepted my offer ; it would have allowed you to have waited for our departure , rested from you fatigues , and descended with us to the frontier ; so many days of walking saved. ” “ To be sure ! ” answered <NAME> .
__label__0	“ What have you to tell me , <NAME> ? ” he asked .
__label__0	“ <NAME> has lost its chance of getting back to the earth .
__label__0	Nevertheless , it seemed that <NAME> had foreseen everything needful for this undertaking , and that he had made the necessary studies .
__label__0	“ Close the door , <NAME> ! ” said <NAME> .
__label__1	The lady says what ’ s right .
__label__0	`` Those are mountains of ice , the first we have met with .
__label__1	‘ I am charmed , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ let me assure you , with <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Why what bloodshot , draggled , dishevelled spectacle is this ! ’ cried Mortimer .
__label__1	One said she lived in the <NAME> , and had singed her whiskers by doing so ; another , that she was made fast to the great buoy outside the harbour , and could only be visited at half-tide ; a third , that she was locked up in <NAME> jail for child-stealing ; a fourth , that she was seen to mount a broom in the last high wind , and make direct for <NAME> .
__label__1	He recognized the friends the instant they reappeared , but their reappearance had no effect on his composure .
__label__0	I cried , dragging my uncle along ; and , for the first time , he made no resistance to my wishes .
__label__0	said <NAME> , `` I am really sorry that we did not start when the earth was full , that is to say , when our globe was in opposition to the sun . ''
__label__1	His visitor professes his regret to hear it and asks him does he remember Jo .
__label__1	That , he considered it plain that such price was stateable in a single expressive word , and that the word was , ‘ Halves ! ’ That , the question then arose when ‘ Halves ! ’ should be called .
__label__1	Why , how old are you ? ’ ‘ I don ’ t know. ’ Mr <NAME> opened his eyes very wide , and appeared thoughtful for a moment ; then , bidding the child mind the door until he came back , vanished straightway .
__label__0	In spite of the cold , he had not been seen since the day of his arrival from <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> , he 's a good sailor , although he 's <NAME> -- there are good people everywhere -- and he takes in his supplies at the <NAME> . ''
__label__1	Next , you really have done wonders for me , <NAME> , in easing my money-perplexities , and with such a guardian and steward beside me , as the preserver of my life ( I am hardly strong yet , you see , for I am not man enough to refer to her without a trembling voice -- she is so inexpressibly dear to me , Mortimer !
__label__1	She laid her hand on my arm , and hurried me on to one of the sombre streets , of which there are several in that part , where the houses were once fair dwellings in the occupation of single families , but have , and had , long degenerated into poor lodgings let off in rooms .
__label__1	I trust , sir , that I have never pointed the noble instrument which is placed in my hands , against the sacred bosom of private life , or the tender breast of individual reputation ; I trust , sir , that I have devoted my energies to -- to endeavours -- humble they may be , humble I know they are -- to instil those principles of -- which -- are -- ’ Here the editor of the <NAME> , appearing to ramble , <NAME> came to his relief , and said -- ‘ Certainly. ’ ‘ And what , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> -- ‘ what , <NAME> , let me ask you as an impartial man , is the state of the public mind in <NAME> , with reference to my contest with the _Independent_ ? ’ ‘ Greatly excited , no doubt , ’ interposed <NAME> , with a look of slyness which was very likely accidental .
__label__1	‘ I don ’ t defend myself , <NAME> , ’ said the penitent <NAME> ; ‘ but the fellow has such a queer way with him and is such an artful dog , that first of all he set me upon thinking whether there was any harm in telling him , and while I was thinking , screwed it out of me .
__label__0	`` If it is , '' continued <NAME> , `` I should not be afraid to go across the ice-fields . ''
__label__0	In fifteen days later , a day light the most brilliant would have replaced a midnight the most <NAME> .
__label__0	As the favourable season was now approaching , D'Entrecasteaux determined to avail himself of it to reach the land of the <NAME> , which had been seen by <NAME> , and visited some years later by <NAME> , who , imagining he was making a new discovery , named it <NAME> .
__label__0	The detective had remained behind .
__label__0	At about ten o ’ clock , however , <NAME> caught sight of a number of black objects moving on the ice blocks .
__label__0	The future would soon teach me that .
__label__1	‘ Did you ? ’ <NAME> retorted .
__label__0	It takes eleven days to go from <NAME> to <NAME> , but water is not so scarce on this journey , which is generally made upon oxen .
__label__1	This would not do , it was quite clear .
__label__0	<NAME> knew from experience the usefulness of this practice and its good influence on the men , so valuable that it is never neglected on board of ships which winter in the polar seas .
__label__0	Finding <NAME> absorbed in a melancholy silence , <NAME> left her old wooden chair , fixed a taper on the end of a candlestick , lit it , and placed it near a small waxen <NAME> , sheltered in her niche of stone .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> would not pronounce upon this ; he desired to postpone the decision for twenty-four or forty-eight hours .
__label__1	The man who was seated there , was tall and dark , and wore a large cloak .
__label__1	‘ What should you say this was ? ’ demanded Mr Swiveller .
__label__0	But so irregular was the formation of the valleys that <NAME> was obliged to conduct the exploration in a strictly methodical manner .
__label__1	It was the figure of an old man with a bowed head , wearing a large brimmed low-crowned hat , and a long-skirted coat .
__label__1	I tell you that you shall have as bad , and twice as bad , if you so much as open your mouths about him. ’ ‘ If I catch him , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ I ’ ll only stop short of flaying him alive .
__label__0	About the 7th of December , twenty days after the discovery of the castaways , they perceived the bay where the `` Jeune-Hardie '' was lying .
__label__0	Just study yourself as you live from day to day , my dear Last .
__label__1	I believe , ” said <NAME> , rather halting in his reassuring words , as the stony manner of all the three impressed itself upon him more and more , “ I state the case , <NAME> ? ” <NAME> looked gloomily at his wife , and gave no other answer than a gruff sound of acquiescence .
__label__0	He declared himself , therefore , ready to start .
__label__0	At this moment there opened before us a large grotto dug in a picturesque heap of rocks and carpeted with all the thick warp of the submarine flora .
__label__0	Top and <NAME> were to remain with the engineer , <NAME> , and <NAME> , for a bark or a cry at a wrong moment would give the alarm .
__label__1	From the goodness of all about me I derived such consolation as I can never think of unmoved .
__label__1	`` <NAME> mentioned , '' pursued <NAME> , addressing himself again to my guardian , `` mentioned to the housekeeper , who , as he may have observed , is an old and attached retainer of the family -- '' ( `` That is , when I walked through the house the other day , on the occasion of my going down to visit <NAME> and <NAME> , '' <NAME> airily explained to us . )
__label__0	They had no doubt that the civil war was at an end , and to them it appeared impossible that the just cause of the <NAME> had not triumphed .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , ’ he resumed ; ‘ your dear sister , our Fanny , has contracted ha hum -- a marriage , eminently calculated to extend the basis of our -- ha -- connection , and to -- hum -- consolidate our social relations .
__label__1	‘ It seemed at first as if it was only <NAME> that he objected to meet .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> also placed at the summit of the mainmast a `` crow 's nest , '' a sort of cask staved in at one end , in which a look-out remained constantly , to observe the icefields .
__label__0	There was no reason for stopping for a whole hour ; <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> walked on , though there was nothing to show them what was the exact direction of this unknown tunnel .
__label__0	Moreover , the steep sides , where breathing was difficult , were clothed with magnificent forests of tapering pines , and firs , and wide-spreading cypress and cedar-trees .
__label__0	“ The goodwife is in better health than I am , if that ’ s possible , ” replied Ford , “ and it will be a pleasure to her to see you at her table .
__label__1	The lady modestly hesitated to reply , lest there should be any impropriety in holding an interview with <NAME> , with closed doors .
__label__0	`` We found new cause for surprise in the population of the colony .
__label__0	It was <NAME> , already called <NAME> by <NAME> .
__label__1	It never , in its uttermost pride and passion , knew the shadow that had fallen on his , in the dark corner , on the night of the return ; and often since ; and which deepened on it now , as he looked up .
__label__1	Their looks are not prepossessing , and their manners are peculiar .
__label__1	‘ Oh yes , <NAME> , I ’ m very well pleased , thank you , ’ returned <NAME> , who had suddenly become so very upright that she seemed to have put an additional bone in her stays .
__label__1	The legal gentleman being by this time rather giddy and perplexed in his ideas ( for this was one of the operations of the tobacco on his nervous system ) , took the opportunity of slinking away into the open air , where , in course of time , he recovered sufficiently to return with a countenance of tolerable composure .
__label__0	Two stout arms , an iron constitution , a powerful frame , and an indomitable courage were all loyally devoted to his master ’ s service , and fairly entitled him to his _soi-disant_ designation of “ The <NAME> of Montmartre. ” Unlike his master , he made no pretension to any gift of poetic power , but his inexhaustible memory made him a living encyclopaedia ; and for his stock of anecdotes and trooper ’ s tales he was matchless .
__label__0	The first object that caught their attention as they emerged upon the open rocks was the unfortunate professor , who was scrambling down the mountain-side , piteously displaying a fragment of his shattered telescope .
__label__1	But at that instant the conversation , whatever it was , which had been carrying on near this fire was resumed , and the tones of the voice that spoke -- she could not distinguish words -- sounded as familiar to her as her own .
__label__0	But there was little time for <NAME> to examine the changes which a few hours had wrought .
__label__0	I did not attempt to controvert this singular and astounding assertion .
__label__1	They had already got the length of opening the hearse to take the coffin out , when some brighter genius proposed instead , its being escorted to its destination amidst general rejoicing .
__label__1	It ’ s a sensible and proper thing indeed , what Mrs <NAME> has said ! ’ exclaimed the old lady .
__label__1	We were taking an early dinner at this house , on the day after our arrival , which was Sunday , when a steamboat came in sight , and presently touched at the wharf .
__label__1	My own two hands , and feet likewise , being very cold , however , on this particular occasion , I crept below at midnight .
__label__0	At last , late in the evening of <NAME> Day , amidst the most enthusiastic cheers of all the inhabitants of <NAME> , who welcomed them with a splendid pine brand procession , <NAME> and his friends , thoroughly used up , feet swelled , limbs bruised , bones aching , stomachs seasick , eyes bleared , ears ringing , and brains on fire for want of rest , took their places in the <NAME> Car waiting for them , and started without a moment 's delay for <NAME> , about a hundred miles distant .
__label__1	Her loving and innocent face rising before him , had no softening or winning influence .
__label__0	The next day , April 1st , when the <NAME> ascended to the surface some minutes before noon , we sighted land to the west .
__label__1	<NAME> had caught up , by the rusty nozzle , an old pair of bellows , which were just undergoing a flourish in the air preparatory to a descent upon the head of <NAME> , when <NAME> , with an earnest gesture , stayed his arm , and , taking another step in advance , came so close behind the schoolmaster that , by leaning slightly forward , he could plainly distinguish the writing which he held up to his eye .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , stay , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ You claim to have one plain motive in all you do yourself .
__label__1	We reached the city , late that night .
__label__1	‘ Like a demd native ? ’ asked the husband .
__label__1	I have already said , sir , that I have had my suspicions of <NAME> , in reference to <NAME> , for some time .
__label__1	“ Weel ! ” thinks I , “ he ’ s got a pretty good start , and if he bean ’ t whoam by noo , he never will be ; so you may coom as quick as you loike , and foind us reddy ” -- that is , you know , schoolmeasther might coom. ’ ‘ I understand , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ I have now said all I have to say : except that this young couple parted , firmly , though not without tears and sorrow , on the evening when you last saw them together. ’ <NAME> heard a terrible shriek , and saw no ghastly figure , sitting or standing ; saw nothing but a heap of torn and miry clothes upon the floor .
__label__0	During the last twelve hours the atmosphere of the projectile had become charged with this deleterious gas .
__label__0	Their voices sounded faintly to each other .
__label__0	In fact , it was a huge bear ; lost in the fog , it came and went with great danger to the men , whose presence it certainly did not suspect .
__label__1	Now , as they went along , <NAME> reflected , that I might , after all , have been brought there on some genuine and serviceable errand tending to <NAME> 's safety , and , bethinking himself that in that case interruption must be mischievous , left his guide and <NAME> on the edge of the quarry , and went on by himself , and stole round the house two or three times , endeavouring to ascertain whether all was right within .
__label__1	Anything else we can do for him , besides giving her up ?
__label__1	`` That 'll do , my good friend ! ''
__label__0	The surveillance to which he was subjected hastened <NAME> 's departure , and upon the 7th of September he started for <NAME> .
__label__1	`` She in all respects deserves it , '' says my Lady .
__label__1	When you go downstairs , tell <NAME> so , and send her up to me ; and while I speak to her , let no one come -- not even aunt .
__label__1	“ Only , if this is a private room specially ordered for the occasion , I should think the public room must be a _very _comfortable one ; ” with this , my uncle sat himself down in a high-backed chair , and took such an accurate measure of the gentleman , with his eyes , that <NAME> and <NAME> could have supplied him with printed calico for a suit , and not an inch too much or too little , from that estimate alone .
__label__1	The dolls ’ dressmaker looked on until he rolled himself into a corner with his <NAME> slippers uppermost , and then , resolving in the first place to address her ministration to the salt and snuff , gave him more water and slapped his back .
__label__1	I know that , but for the mercy of <NAME> , I might easily have been , for any care that was taken of me , a little robber or a little vagabond .
__label__1	But his name is <NAME> . ''
__label__1	It was a most wonderful closet , worthy of <NAME> and of <NAME> .
__label__0	By this time the intelligent <NAME> was raised to the duty of valet .
__label__1	‘ To-morrow morning , sir , we give a public breakfast -- a _fete champetre_ -- to a great number of those who have rendered themselves celebrated by their works and talents .
__label__0	Harding often talked over this project with <NAME> , and he found him strangely bent upon undertaking this voyage , for which determination he himself could give no sufficient reason .
__label__1	Equally , when he lay still and staring , he would repeat it for hours without cessation , but then , always in a tone of subdued warning and horror .
__label__1	‘ I am ready to walk with you. ’ ‘ Thank you , Mr Headstone .
__label__1	If you get it ( which you may after a time ) , that memorial must be entered in that Department , sent to be registered in this Department , sent back to be signed by that Department , sent back to be countersigned by this Department , and then it will begin to be regularly before that Department .
__label__1	It was when they turned into the welcome shade of the cool old hall , that <NAME> observed a great change to have come over the <NAME> ; as if the golden arm uplifted there , had struck him a poisoned blow .
__label__1	‘ It must not turn me , but it is the truth ; no doubt it is. ’ ‘ Only remember what we have been since that bright morning when we turned our backs upon it for the last time , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ only remember what we have been since we have been free of all those miseries -- what peaceful days and quiet nights we have had -- what pleasant times we have known -- what happiness we have enjoyed .
__label__1	Everybody having eaten everything , the table was cleared in a most alarming hurry , and with great noise ; and the spirits , whereat the eyes of <NAME> glistened , being arranged in order , with water both hot and cold , the party composed themselves for conviviality ; <NAME> being stationed in a large armchair by the fireside , and the four little <NAME> disposed on a small form in front of the company with their flaxen tails towards them , and their faces to the fire ; an arrangement which was no sooner perfected , than Mrs. <NAME> was overpowered by the feelings of a mother , and fell upon the left shoulder of <NAME> dissolved in tears .
__label__1	Or she might be as ugly as she was rich , without any fear of losing me .
__label__1	‘ You are the <NAME> who married the widow of my late nephew , <NAME> , of <NAME> ! -- Though why <NAME> , I don ’ t know ! ’ ‘ I am , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	The inhabitants of <NAME> would not have taken them there at any price .
__label__0	The captives , still strictly guarded , saw the funeral cortege leave the inner inclosure of the “ pah ” ; then the chants and cries grew fainter .
__label__1	Here somebody cried out , ‘ Shame , <NAME> !
__label__1	Wery good indeed , Samivel. ’ <NAME> nodded his head an extraordinary number of times , in the excess of his gratification , and waited in a listening attitude for <NAME> to resume his statement .
__label__1	He was fatter than ever .
__label__1	It has aged me , tired me , vexed me , disappointed me .
__label__1	We all three went home together next day .
__label__0	It was eleven o ’ clock when the banquet , which had begun at half-past seven , came to an end by a toast proposed by the <NAME> in honour of the engineers of the <NAME> Practical Association and the success of their undertaking .
__label__1	My guardian did not seek to dissuade me , and I went .
__label__1	'We shall see , ' returned the old gentleman with a searching glance .
__label__1	`` Are the pictures all as they used to be ? ''
__label__0	He wanted to say a word further in the <NAME> ’ s interest , but <NAME> stopped him with a glance , and afterward said to him : “ No , <NAME> , we must think of those who ventured their lives .
__label__1	You are that restless and that roving -- '' `` Yes !
__label__1	If I may ! ’ ‘ Why , it ’ s but a dull life that we lead here , boy , I am afraid , ’ he said .
__label__1	It died upon my lips , and from that hour till now has never passed them. ’ Mrs. Markleham , with a short groan , leaned back in her easy-chair ; and retired behind her fan , as if she were never coming out any more .
__label__0	He is very crafty ; we must try to be even craftier . ''
__label__1	Yes. ’ ‘ Can you guess , ’ said <NAME> , folding her small hands tight in one another , and looking at him with all the earnestness of her soul looking steadily out of her eyes , ‘ what I am going to ask you not to do ? ’ ‘ I think I can .
__label__1	said <NAME> , feeling in his breast with a look of alarm .
__label__1	Now think of her , and tell me , Newman. ’ ‘ Yes , I will , I will , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ And why not ? ’ retorted <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Very disagreeable , <NAME> , and so was Lavvy. ’ ‘ They are sometimes a little liable to it , ’ observed the patient cherub ; ‘ but I hope you made allowances , <NAME> , my dear ? ’ ‘ No .
__label__1	Then , the <NAME> locks the iron-barred gates that divide the sanctuary from the chancel , and all of the procession having scuttled into their places , hide their faces ; and then the intoned words , ‘ WHEN THE <NAME> MAN— ’ rise among groins of arches and beams of roof , awakening muttered thunder .
__label__0	Shall I tell you my theory ?
__label__0	Top particularly was enchanted with this improvement , for he had not , and never could have possessed <NAME> ’ s skill in climbing ladders , and often it was on <NAME> ’ s back , or even on that of the orang that he had been obliged to make the ascent to <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> Harding evidently could not resist fifty ruffians , all well-armed , who , either by penetrating by main force into <NAME> , or by starving out the besieged , could obtain from them what they wanted .
__label__1	‘ O , it was excellent ! —I wouldn ’ t dance with you , you know. ’ Edwin scarcely seems to see the force of this ; begs to know if he may take the liberty to ask why ?
__label__0	However , after traveling for two hours , fatigue overcame him , and he slept .
__label__0	On the eleventh day we sighted <NAME> , over which towered <NAME> , which , the weather being clear , we made out very readily .
__label__0	MY uncle was walking about the bottom of the crater like a wild beast in a cage .
__label__1	He was standing close beside it , with one of his skeleton hands over his mouth , and the other resting on the <NAME> ’ s table .
__label__0	`` It will doubtless attract the bears this way , for they are fond of the smell . ''
__label__1	I doubt whether two young birds could have known less about keeping house , than I and my pretty <NAME> did .
__label__0	After pondering for a few moments , the captain spoke again .
__label__1	He slept heavily , and his tray of shoemaking tools , and his old unfinished work , were all as usual .
__label__0	He awaited them calmly , aimed at the nearest , and fired ; but the bullet struck the animal in the middle of his forehead , without penetrating the skull .
__label__1	In what , Mrs. Snagsby does not with particularity express , but she knows that <NAME> was <NAME> 's son , `` as well as if a trumpet had spoken it , '' and she followed <NAME> when he went on his last visit to the boy , and if he was not his son why did he go ?
__label__0	Thousands of luminous sheets and barbed tongues of fire were cast in various directions .
__label__0	Arriving upon the shores of an irregular lake , of vast extent , the whole party embarked in yachts , and proceeded to a bridge which is thrown across the narrowest part of the lake , and beyond which it appeared to stretch away indefinitely .
__label__0	From nothing they must supply themselves with everything .
__label__1	As to me , I sat on his left hand , and the rest were grouped about us , on the nearest beds and on the floor .
__label__1	“ You say again you are quite sure that it was the prisoner ? ” The witness was quite sure .
__label__1	Every night my Lady casually asks her maid , `` Is <NAME> come ? ''
__label__0	At length , looking at me and shaking his head , he answered , -- `` No , not both .
__label__0	Neither the islet nor <NAME> were visible , and could not be from thence , for the rising ground and the curtain of trees closed the northern horizon .
__label__0	Several times I thought the <NAME> was preparing for attack ; but <NAME> contented himself with allowing his adversary to approach , and then fled once more before it .
__label__0	The sailor and his companions naturally followed the route which cut diagonally across the island , and they were thus obliged to follow the stream which flowed towards the sea .
__label__1	says <NAME> , biting his thumb with the appetite of vexation .
__label__1	‘ Never , ’ said my aunt , ‘ be mean in anything ; never be false ; never be cruel .
__label__0	Here the river widened considerably .
__label__1	‘ Does she like it ? ’ ‘ She ’ ll like it better , ’ returned that strong-minded lady , ‘ when she has tea ; so let us have it , and don ’ t bother. ’ ‘ Sweet Sally ! ’ cried <NAME> , extending his arms as if about to embrace her .
__label__1	Looking in , I saw a lighted candle on a table , a bench , and a mattress on a truckle bedstead .
__label__1	Who should we bury , <NAME> ? ’ returned the sexton .
__label__0	`` I only ask to be allowed to pay . ''
__label__1	This is a great advancement for her in life , Mr Rokesmith .
__label__1	Even the two players at dominoes glanced up from their game , as if to protest against philosophical philanthropy being brought by name into the Break of Day .
__label__1	All others belonging to him have gone to the <NAME> and the Glory , and I have a mind that they ’ re drawing him to them -- leading him away. ’ ‘ No , no , no , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	( By this time he had found the eye-glass , and put it up again . )
__label__0	`` I hear the lowing plainly , '' I said ; `` there are , then , seals and walrus also in the sea at the base . ''
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> opens both the doors exactly as he would have done yesterday , or as he would have done ten years ago , and makes his old-fashioned bow as she passes out .
__label__0	“ There is the pass of <NAME> , on the slope of the volcano , in latitude , 37 degrees 30 ’ , or , in other words , only half a degree out of our way. ” “ That would do , but are you acquainted with this pass of <NAME> , <NAME> ? ” said <NAME> .
__label__1	My back was turned towards the distant Hulks as I walked on , and , though I could see the old lights away on the spits of sand , I saw them over my shoulder .
__label__1	I have been offered and rejected , put up and appraised , until my very soul has sickened .
__label__0	Evidently the Gulf of <NAME> would be emptied to form a huge territory of the <NAME> , which the Mexicans and <NAME> might claim in accordance with the <NAME> doctrine .
__label__0	He undertook to find all that was needed , and offered to take him to a <NAME> , not further than four miles off at most , where he could get supplies of all he wanted .
__label__1	The latter so received it , and remained silent .
__label__0	The operation , ably directed by <NAME> , was a complete success .
__label__0	“ Something more you must lend me , ” he said , addressing the Jew .
__label__1	Her name is beautiful too , ’ said <NAME> , shaking her head with energy , and arranging herself in her chair ; ‘ <NAME> is at once uncommon , as it strikes me , and distinguished .
__label__1	As a portion of the world affect to despise the power of money , I must try and show them what it is. ’ And being , by this time , in a pleasant frame of mind for slumber , <NAME> went to bed .
__label__1	Do that again , boys. ’ The two combatants went to work afresh , and chopped away until the swords emitted a shower of sparks : to the great satisfaction of Mr Crummles , who appeared to consider this a very great point indeed .
__label__1	Which the playacting have likeways brought him to <NAME> along with me .
__label__1	We ’ ll make some regular <NAME> Nights of it. ’ I felt extremely flattered by this arrangement , and we commenced carrying it into execution that very evening .
__label__1	Of course , she has remained here ever since .
__label__0	<NAME> tracks of blood , scattered limbs , charred trunks of bodies , showed here and there ; none could guess how many victims lay dead and mangled under those ruins .
__label__0	<NAME> , therefore. ” “ Captain Harding , ” replied <NAME> , “ I think that we ought to do everything to discover this unknown benefactor .
__label__1	Are you quite sure , Mr Rokesmith , that you have never had a disappointment in love ? ’ ‘ Quite sure .
__label__0	As to taking you to <NAME> , is it not you , <NAME> , who are now taking me there ?
__label__1	‘ It seems improbable because it is improbable , ’ his friend returned .
__label__1	B. , aged twenty-four next birthday , and committed for eighteen months ’ solitary , had himself said ( not that he had ever shown himself particularly worthy of belief ) his ruin began , as he was perfectly sure and confident that otherwise he would have been a tip-top moral specimen .
__label__0	The nearer we approached the more nearly vertical became its slope .
__label__0	“ The exploration of the <NAME> and its tributaries was the object of several expeditions , the principal of which I shall mention : Between 1749 and 1758 , <NAME> made a reconnoissance of the river , and visited <NAME> ; from 1785 to 1788 , <NAME> and <NAME> travelled across the deserts of <NAME> , and ascended as far as the country of the <NAME> , who assassinated <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and so many other unfortunate men .
__label__1	We 've come a long way ; never mind .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> , innocent , will not fly ! ” The scene which followed these words was heart-rending .
__label__0	[ Illustration ] The doctor and his companions went through all these emotions ; they had reached the western limit of the ice-field , and yet they saw the ship disappear , taking no note of their presence .
__label__0	It is composed of a <NAME> pile , which I do not work with bichromate of potash , but with sodium .
__label__1	`` He certainly was not active in it .
__label__1	I dare say she ’ ll manage to do it. ’ ‘ Probably , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	He went away in high spirits .
__label__1	I was cold , and I trembled violently , but not a word he uttered was lost .
__label__0	<NAME> was thrust forward by his guards to the foot of the terrace , and <NAME> said to him , “ You came to see our goings out and comings in , <NAME> spy .
__label__1	‘ This , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ seems to be some deed of sale of the right of presentation to the rectory of <NAME> , in the valley of <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> and sleep blot out these scenes and thoughts : and when the morning shines again , it gilds the house-tops of a lively city , before whose broad paved wharf the boat is moored ; with other boats , and flags , and moving wheels , and hum of men around it ; as though there were not a solitary or silent rood of ground within the compass of a thousand miles .
__label__1	The small servant stood with humility in presence of <NAME> , and hung her head .
__label__0	We were mute with astonishment , overcome by a kind of feeling which was next door to apathy .
__label__1	Take me away ! ’ With one swift turn of her lithe figures <NAME> laid the little beauty on a sofa , as if she had never caught her up .
__label__1	‘ It ’ s better for me to be stupid than uncomfortable , isn ’ t it ? ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	The <NAME> , as has been said , was <NAME> 's yacht , which had left <NAME> on the islet , and which was to return there some day to fetch him .
__label__0	Nothing could be more dejected than the aspect of that frozen sea ; not a single living creature relieved the solitude ; both the travelers , <NAME> from a scientific point of view , <NAME> from an aesthetic , were alike impressed by the solemnity of the scene , and where the lengthened shadow of the sail cast upon the ice by the oblique rays of the setting sun had disappeared , and day had given place to night , the two men , drawn together as by an involuntary impulse , mutually held each other ’ s hands in silence .
__label__0	This is self-evident , the interposition of the Earth being possible only between this visible face and the <NAME> .
__label__0	Moreover , if the detective had been on board at that moment , <NAME> would have joined issue with him on a quite different subject , and in an entirely different manner .
__label__0	The icebergs which are formed in the open sea by the accumulation of ice are not before us .
__label__1	She stopped at the corner , and putting her hand in his , wished him good night .
__label__0	Apparently the natives thought the victim in the wrong , for they continued to frequent the market with their former confidence .
__label__0	[ Illustration : `` Good-bye , <NAME> , '' said <NAME> . ]
__label__0	Many of the adventurers wished to enjoy this unexpected good fortune in a peaceable manner in their own country , and eagerly asked for their dismissal .
__label__1	There were two men of secret appearance lounging in <NAME> , and thoughtfully fitting their feet into the cracks of the pavement as they talked together , one of whom said to the other when they first passed me , that “ Jaggers would do it if it was to be done. ” There was a knot of three men and two women standing at a corner , and one of the women was crying on her dirty shawl , and the other comforted her by saying , as she pulled her own shawl over her shoulders , “ <NAME> is for him , 'Melia , and what more could you have ? ” There was a red-eyed little Jew who came into the Close while I was loitering there , in company with a second little Jew whom he sent upon an errand ; and while the messenger was gone , I remarked this Jew , who was of a highly excitable temperament , performing a jig of anxiety under a lamp-post and accompanying himself , in a kind of frenzy , with the words , “ O Jaggerth , <NAME> , <NAME> !
__label__0	He was much surprised to see a strong current at this place .
__label__1	He had charged himself with drink , for the playing out of his game , and was impatient to begin .
__label__1	He catches at it , thinks he ’ ll make sure of the contents of the pockets anyhow , in case he should be parted from it , bends right over the stern , and in one of these heavy squalls , or in the cross-swell of two steamers , or in not being quite prepared , or through all or most or some , gets a lurch , overbalances and goes head-foremost overboard .
__label__1	<NAME> ’ t give it to him .
__label__0	You must mean the <NAME> , surely. ” “ How ? ” demanded <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ There ain ’ t a better nor a kinder father going , than mine is. ’ ‘ Why don ’ t you want to see him then ? ’ inquired his patron .
__label__1	This will be a blow to him , I am much afraid ! ’ She hurried on , without resting , and hurried on until they had passed under the gatehouse into the street ; once there , she asked : ‘ Has he followed us ?
__label__0	`` With the <NAME> apparatus , M. Aronnax ; one is carried on the back , the other is fastened to the waist .
__label__1	‘ What ’ s the matter ? ’ said the short dark man .
__label__1	Is it blank cartridge or ball ?
__label__1	But not as she did .
__label__1	It ’ s so nonsensical ! ’ ‘ My love , ’ said I , ‘ I have work to do. ’ ‘ But don ’ t do it ! ’ returned <NAME> .
__label__0	The terrestrial orbit will bend toward the wandering star , and the earth , becoming its satellite , will be drawn such a distance that the rays of the sun will have no action on its surface . ''
__label__0	So the sailor actively pursued his researches , though he exclaimed , when some animal which he had not even time to recognize fled into the long grass , “ If only we had had the dog Top ! ” But <NAME> had disappeared at the same time as his master , and had probably perished with him .
__label__1	‘ Finish by telling me how your father left you , <NAME> .
__label__0	The <NAME> belong more especially to two distinct races , the <NAME> and the <NAME> .
__label__0	After two days ' row the canoes came in sight of <NAME> , at a spot where the stream divides into three `` rivers '' of great width , with marshy level banks covered with palm-trees .
__label__1	If in my knowledge of THE secret I do what I can to spare an innocent girl ( especially , remembering your own reference to her when you told my story to the assembled guests at <NAME> ) from the taint of my impending shame , I act upon a resolution I have taken .
__label__1	If I could clear this mystery for her , or prove her to be well related , or find that having the honour to be a remote branch of your ladyship 's family she had a right to be made a party in <NAME> and <NAME> , why , I might make a sort of a claim upon <NAME> to look with an eye of more dedicated favour on my proposals than she has exactly done as yet .
__label__0	On the river , vessels of all sorts crammed with visitors gathered round the enormous mass of timber , and the waters of the <NAME> literally disappeared even up to the left bank beneath the vast flotilla .
__label__1	The sergeant made some kind of report , and some entry in a book , and then the convict whom I call the other convict was drafted off with his guard , to go on board first .
__label__1	As he spoke , there was another great cry of pity from the beach ; four men arose with the wreck out of the deep , clinging to the rigging of the remaining mast ; uppermost , the active figure with the curling hair .
__label__0	With a favorable wind she would certainly have made eleven knots an hour had not the high waves somewhat impeded her progress .
__label__1	‘ Yes , to state , ’ said the little man , ‘ I thank my honourable friend , if he will allow me to call him so ( four hears and one certainly from <NAME> ) , for the suggestion .
__label__1	‘ The fact is , he is my servant , but I allow him to take a good many liberties ; for , between ourselves , I flatter myself he is an original , and I am rather proud of him. ’ ‘ Ah , ’ said the red-haired man , ‘ that , you see , is a matter of taste .
__label__0	cried the <NAME> , his voice betraying unwonted excitement as he put the glass again to his eye .
__label__1	‘ I beg your pardon , <NAME> ’ am ? ’ said Mr Boffin , coming to a stop .
__label__1	<NAME> , please to give the lad some wine. ’ Mr <NAME> ’ s glance followed <NAME> with sharp disfavour , as he left the room under the pilotage of Mrs <NAME> ; and it may be that his mind ’ s eye followed him with no greater relish , as he rode back to his <NAME> ’ s with <NAME> .
__label__1	If P. J. T. in seventeen-forty-seven , or in any other year of his period , drank such wines—then , for a certainty , P. J. T. was <NAME> .
__label__1	“ My good <NAME> , so he was .
__label__0	`` We ca n't be more than forty-eight hours from the <NAME> , '' said <NAME> , who could now begin to speak once more .
__label__1	The time was once when men as knowing as <NAME> would walk on turret-tops in the starlight and look up into the sky to read their fortunes there .
__label__0	At last , after three long and weary hours of navigation , that is to say , about six o'clock in the evening , we found a place at which we could land .
__label__1	‘ They hear of poor Jews often , and are very good to them. ’ ‘ Bother that ! ’ returned <NAME> .
__label__0	Judging from his appearance I should have been a long time before I had suspected him to be what he was , a mighty hunter .
__label__0	There <NAME> put on the sealskin , which very nearly covered him .
__label__0	No reasoning could make him believe it .
__label__1	‘ This is a dry game .
__label__0	This is an interesting fact , and a singular avowal for an <NAME> of the sixteenth century , deeply imbued with superstition ; it offers one more proof that the idea of the <NAME> is not innate , as some theologians have imagined .
__label__1	Some few attempts at cleanliness and order were manifest , though made in a reckless , gipsy way , that might have connected them , at a glance , with the younger woman .
__label__0	Crossing the line for the third time , they passed the site given by <NAME> as that of the <NAME> , without finding them ; and , upon the 6th of December , entered the <NAME> , the merit of discovering which belongs to <NAME> .
__label__1	Let us waste no words about it .
__label__1	You have never entertained in secret any other proposal ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , ’ she returned , almost scornfully , ‘ what other proposal can have been made to _me_ ?
__label__1	said <NAME> , pausing near the door .
__label__0	When they reached the spot the bird was dead , and the body of <NAME> was quite concealed beneath his mighty wings .
__label__1	'Give her a whiff of fresh air with the bellows , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> ; 'and you slap her hands , <NAME> , while <NAME> undoes the petticuts . '
__label__0	Upon the 2nd of November Surville descried an island , which received the name of <NAME> , from the contrary winds which for three days checked the progress of the ship .
__label__1	So could you. ’ ‘ I hope so , ’ replied <NAME> .
__label__0	`` Yes , <NAME> , coal ; that is to say , our preservation ! ''
__label__0	Let us have supper and then get some sleep. ” “ Supper by all means , ” said <NAME> , “ but no fire ; nothing but biscuit and dried meat .
__label__0	<NAME> lovingly watched its flight , when he heard these words pronounced by a voice full of emotion : `` You are indeed a brave man . ''
__label__1	There was one point which Mr <NAME> deemed it unnecessary to enlarge upon , and that was the fact of the modest quencher , which , by reason of its intrinsic strength and its coming close upon the heels of the temperate beverage he had discussed at dinner , awakened a slight degree of fever , and rendered necessary two or three other modest quenchers at the public-house in the course of the evening .
__label__1	‘ It is singular enough that I had intended to volunteer a full explanation this very day ; so , if you will give me another glass of wine , I will satisfy your curiosity. ’ The decanters passed from hand to hand with unwonted briskness , and <NAME> , looking round on the faces of his friends with a cheerful smile , proceeded -- ‘ All the changes that have taken place among us , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ I mean the marriage that _has _taken place , and the marriage that <NAME> take place , with the changes they involve , rendered it necessary for me to think , soberly and at once , upon my future plans .
__label__0	The doctor , astonished , almost frightened , gazed at him silently .
__label__0	He had never thought of his proposal being met with any objection .
__label__1	It came into my head that he must have occupied this very vault of mine , and I got out of bed to assure myself that there were no red marks about ; then opened the door to look out into the passages , and cheer myself with the companionship of a distant light , near which I knew the chamberlain to be dozing .
__label__0	<NAME> is situated in exactly 77 @ south latitude , and 16 @ east longitude .
__label__1	Shortly afterwards , Mrs. <NAME> appeared .
__label__0	There was food enough to sustain ten persons for fifteen days , or the dead man forever .
__label__1	Or he may have been muddled altogether by long staring at whatever he HAS got , and by drink , and by hanging about the <NAME> 's Court and hearing of documents for ever , '' returns <NAME> .
__label__0	And madmen are respected on the prairies , even if they are not believed .
__label__0	<NAME> came in at last , and began to excuse himself for having kept them waiting ; but he had to approve a plan for the gasometer , rectify some of the machinery -- But everything was going on well !
__label__1	It was far otherwise with little <NAME> .
__label__0	Here , as in <NAME> , the doors were of basalt . ''
__label__0	The barbarous and inconsiderate greed of these fishermen will one day cause the disappearance of the last whale in the ocean .
__label__1	I will not disgrace your recommendation .
__label__0	<NAME> had come out of his long stupor .
__label__0	The <NAME> durst not finish his sentence , but his face expressed clearly his horror .
__label__1	As she started up , and they all three looked at one another , it became a noise of clamouring voices and of the stir of feet ; then all the windows were heard to be hastily thrown up , and shouts and cries came floating into the house from the river .
__label__1	If a crowd of ghosts were to put themselves into his exact shape , and he stood amongst them , there is something that would tell me how to point him out .
__label__1	It was <NAME> , and I had to stir the pudding for next day , with a copper-stick , from seven to eight by the <NAME> clock .
__label__0	that is the perfection of vessels !
__label__1	<NAME> looked about him for the <NAME> , and saw it not .
__label__1	‘ Have some legal help. ’ ‘ Perhaps I had better. ’ ‘ Have Rugg. ’ ‘ There is not much to do .
__label__0	No one now spoke , even in a low voice .
__label__0	The castle of <NAME> soon disappeared in the murky atmosphere , as well as the tower of <NAME> , which raises its head on the <NAME> .
__label__1	He had nothing with him but his boat , and came on apace .
__label__1	He knew , as every one employed as he was did , that he was never safe ; that flight was impossible ; that he was tied fast under the shadow of the axe ; and that in spite of his utmost tergiversation and treachery in furtherance of the reigning terror , a word might bring it down upon him .
__label__0	The <NAME> obtained ready permission to disembark his sick , and found every facility for revictualling .
__label__1	‘ I saw the writer yesterday. ’ ‘ The writer ? ’ ‘ Mr Dombey .
__label__1	Dilating and dilating since the sun went down last night , it has gradually swelled until it fills every void in the place .
__label__0	The mole no longer protected the coast , which was directly exposed to the attacks of the open sea .
__label__0	Throughout this day ( Sunday ) the house in <NAME> <NAME> was as if uninhabited , and <NAME> , for the first time since he had lived in that house , did not set out for his club when Westminster clock struck half-past eleven .
__label__0	`` It is the floating light of <NAME> , '' he continued .
__label__1	‘ I ’ m a intimate friend of his and his Uncle ’ s .
__label__1	She suffers him to stand by the door and asks him what he wants .
__label__1	I should not have the courage to mention this to any one but you .
__label__1	Touch my face with yours , in case I should not hold out till you come back .
__label__1	I am the person you inquired for . '
__label__0	<NAME> , the governor of <NAME> , received baptism from the chaplain of the <NAME> .
__label__0	If there was no rotation , a mere flip would suffice , but they can ’ t put down that diurnal spin .
__label__0	“ Oh no , <NAME> , ” <NAME> hastened to reply , seeing the young girl ’ s apprehension .
__label__1	You get husky bread and sour drink by it ; and he gets sausage of <NAME> , veal in savoury jelly , white bread , strachino cheese , and good wine by it .
__label__1	Will he be <NAME> , or <NAME> , or <NAME> , or <NAME> , or what will he be ? ” And now when I look at him ; a precious , unconscious , helpless infant , with no use in his little arms but to tear his little cap , and no use in his little legs but to kick his little self -- when I see him a lying on his mother ’ s lap , cooing and cooing , and , in his innocent state , almost a choking hisself with his little fist -- when I see him such a infant as he is , and think that that uncle <NAME> , as was once a-going to be so fond of him , has withdrawed himself away , such a feeling of wengeance comes over me as no language can depicter , and I feel as if even that holy babe was a telling me to hate him. ’ This affecting picture moved Mrs. Kenwigs deeply .
__label__1	Some despairing gingerbread that had been vainly trying to dispose of itself all over the country , and had cast a quantity of dust upon its head in its mortification , again appealed to the public from an infirm booth .
__label__0	During the early morning hours nothing noteworthy took place ; the land grew different in the northeast ; a few elevations , the beginning of a mountainous district , indicated a change .
__label__0	There must have been a wreck , since there is a castaway .
__label__0	He was about to make an exclamation of surprise when he saw the young girl lay her finger on her lips .
__label__1	The wood is quite fresh where it gave way .
__label__1	‘ Let me see the names , ’ replied <NAME> , impatiently extending his hand for the bills .
__label__0	Would you yield to the thirst for gold ?
__label__1	Many among them were pressing forward to shake him by the hand again , when he drew his arm through <NAME> ’ s , and hurried from the prison , far more sad and melancholy , for the moment , than when he had first entered it .
__label__0	A quarter of an hour later Hans paused to enable us to look back .
__label__1	“ It is all I could do , ” said <NAME> .
__label__1	Where I live , I mean. ’ ‘ Indeed ! ’ returned <NAME> quickly .
__label__1	I will hear no more. ’ He did not speak again until they had walked some half-a-mile in silence , when he gravely broke out with : ‘ What would your best friends say , <NAME> ?
__label__0	The next day a huge mountain was seen , which rose abruptly to a height of 12,000 feet above a far-stretching land .
__label__1	‘ The <NAME> , with an agitation she could not repress , hastily tore off the <NAME> and broke the scented seal .
__label__0	He inhabited a town called <NAME> , which was two miles in extent , and situated upon the eastern shore of the lake called <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Blessed if she didn ’ t send ‘ em all to sleep till twelve hours arter the election was over .
__label__1	What is her observation upon that ?
__label__0	The mists , which are frequent , moisten the soil and make it especially favourable for the cultivation of corn and the vine .
__label__0	He came and worked near him , and occupied himself in different things , so as to fix his attention .
__label__1	They hurried away , through several streets , without stopping or speaking .
__label__1	And it really did me good , for though nobody but <NAME> and I knew anything about it , I somehow felt as if it had diminished the separation between <NAME> and me and had brought us together again for those moments .
__label__0	At daybreak the next morning , the 15th of October , the change of weather predicted by <NAME> occurred .
__label__0	But at length a painful sensation drew them from their watchings .
__label__0	The drops of hot blood splashed over these festive monsters , and the whole of this detestable crew groveled under a rain of blood .
__label__1	The pint-pots were great strokes of genius : but the milk-can was a perfect masterpiece . '
__label__0	They sought every means of plundering him , chased him out of their company , and forced him to seek refuge with the guides and donkey-drivers , who cordially welcomed him .
__label__1	‘ Sir ! ’ ‘ <NAME> , I am your humble servant , ’ said Mr Quilp , to whom the monosyllable was addressed .
__label__1	‘ And the man as puts me in , ‘ ull never let me out till you go yourself. ’ ‘ Bless my heart and soul ! ’ ejaculated <NAME> .
__label__1	The Captain himself was in the last extremity of shabbiness , with large whiskers , and an old , old brown great-coat with no other coat below it .
__label__1	He must be made a partner , brother <NAME> ; and if he won ’ t submit to it peaceably , we must have recourse to violence. ’ ‘ Quite right , ’ replied brother Ned , nodding his head as a man thoroughly determined ; ‘ quite right , my dear brother .
__label__1	It ’ s nigh six in the morning. ’ ‘ Is it though ?
__label__0	Just then the locomotive gave a sharp screech , and the train passed out into the darkness of the night .
__label__0	Although <NAME> is the country of stagnation , and customs and fashion always remain much the same in it , the many events which had taken place made it desirable to obtain more exact particulars of a nation with whom Europeans might possibly enter into advantageous friendly relations .
__label__0	Taking example by the guide , I gave way to a kind of painful somnolency , during which I seemed both to hear and feel continued heavings and shudderings in the mountain .
__label__1	Before I leave this place , <NAME> shall hear me . '
__label__1	No one who could hear , and might , by possibility , understand ? '
__label__1	The Secretary learns , too , that confidence between man and wife would seem to obtain but rarely when virtue is in distress , so numerous are the wives who take up their pens to ask Mr Boffin for money without the knowledge of their devoted husbands , who would never permit it ; while , on the other hand , so numerous are the husbands who take up their pens to ask Mr Boffin for money without the knowledge of their devoted wives , who would instantly go out of their senses if they had the least suspicion of the circumstance .
__label__1	For yourselves you speak , and not for Alice , or for me. ” ‘ The sisters , as with one accord , cried that their lot was cast together , and that there were dwellings for peace and virtue beyond the convent ’ s walls .
__label__0	Besides , in his present position , the manoeuvre had become a very perilous one , for the <NAME> threatened to break away before he should be able to get into the car again .
__label__1	He again found <NAME> alone with <NAME> , and he again addressed the whole of his soothing speech to <NAME> , as if she were a prey to the liveliest and most affectionate anxieties .
__label__0	Both animals and birds , influenced by the heaviness of the atmosphere , remained motionless and silent .
__label__1	Such an idle thing should be repeated , with my glad consent , fifty times a day , to save you a moment ’ s heart-ache , <NAME> Dorrit. ’ She had taken courage now , and answered , far more in her usual manner , ‘ You are so good !
__label__1	Here , <NAME> had taken unto himself the best table , and had got all the leaves up , and was holding a kind of black <NAME> , with the aid of a quantity of black pins .
__label__1	‘ Won ’ t THAT extract a look from him ? ’ -- ‘ Can it be possible THAT makes no impression on him ? ’ Such questions <NAME> would propose to herself , often as many times in a day as there were hours in it .
__label__1	They have brought him to a rich end , truly !
__label__1	You ’ ll hardly believe it , <NAME> , ’ said Mr Meagles , laughing within himself , ‘ but it came out that it would never do , because you and he , walking down to <NAME> together , had glided into a friendly conversation in the course of which he had referred to his intention of taking a partner , supposing at the time that you were as firmly and finally settled as <NAME> ’ s Cathedral .
__label__1	His hat was off , before he opened the door ; his comforter too .
__label__1	Put that clock aboard a ship an ’ pack it off to <NAME> , an ’ the time will go on just the same .
__label__0	And these four men were all that remained of the crew of the <NAME> .
__label__1	My walking-stick is also to be seen on application to the chaplain of the <NAME> of <NAME> , who is strictly forbidden to take any money for showing it .
__label__1	‘ I must leave you somewhere for a few minutes , ’ said the schoolmaster , at length breaking the silence into which they had fallen in their gladness .
__label__0	But the lambs might bleat as pitifully as they liked , the mothers never stirred .
__label__0	The corral , with its clumps of trees , the little stream which watered it , its wide carpet of grass , was suddenly illuminated .
__label__0	<NAME> , who had been looking out of the window , now turned hastily towards his companions .
__label__0	Seven or eight leagues south-west lay Ulietea .
__label__1	‘ I wonder , ’ thought the boy , ‘ if one of these gentlemen knew there was nothing in the cupboard at home , whether he ’ d stop on purpose , and make believe that he wanted to call somewhere , that I might earn a trifle ? ’ He was quite tired out with pacing the streets , to say nothing of repeated disappointments , and was sitting down upon a step to rest , when there approached towards him a little clattering jingling four-wheeled chaise , drawn by a little obstinate-looking rough-coated pony , and driven by a little fat placid-faced old gentleman .
__label__1	Through all these meditations which every day of his life crowded about her , he thought of her otherwise in the old way .
__label__1	‘ Mrs Boffin , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ is a highflyer at <NAME> .
__label__1	Why are you not in your usual spirits , <NAME> ? ’ <NAME> faltered that she was much the same as she was in general ; she was not aware of being different .
__label__0	we must have better information to go by .
__label__0	His forces , united to those of <NAME> , had as yet been unsuccessful before <NAME> , and nothing gave the prisoners any hope of a speedy deliverance .
__label__1	‘ God bless her , she is as easily scared as a bird , ’ said I .
__label__1	Let me know how you would have dealt with me if you had regarded me as being what you would have considered on equal terms with you. ’ ‘ It is impossible , Mr Wrayburn .
__label__1	<NAME> and <NAME> had often dealt in hides , but never in hearts .
__label__1	cried the Jew , his eyes flashing with rage .
__label__0	`` You are free , monsieur ; but I shall not go with you .
__label__0	Send your answer to the initials K. Z. , at <NAME> , <NAME> , _poste restante_ .
__label__0	The main point is to complete our armament with the least possible delay .
__label__0	`` Certainly , '' replied <NAME> ; `` but that will render the working of the piece more difficult .
__label__0	But how was this information to be obtained ?
__label__0	I added impatiently and eagerly .
__label__1	I only know that I don ’ t like it .
__label__1	Why , I have known that grandmother of mine lie in her bed and drink her four-teen glasses of liquor before breakfast ! ’ Mrs. Gradgrind , weakly smiling , and giving no other sign of vitality , looked ( as she always did ) like an indifferently executed transparency of a small female figure , without enough light behind it .
__label__1	`` Anyhow , here I stand , this present day , <NAME> married to <NAME> 's widder .
__label__0	They now gave open demonstration of their joy by making the towns of Nossa-Senhora-del-Desterro , <NAME> , and <NAME> one blaze of light with their illuminations , and marching through the streets singing verses in honour of <NAME> . ''
__label__1	<NAME> , we are observed ! -- we are discovered ! ’ <NAME> looked round .
__label__0	`` The latitude before we left `` And , '' said <NAME> , `` how far are we from the nearest sea to the west ? ''
__label__0	“ This man , whom I received with hospitality , only came to me to propose that I should purchase his silence to offer me an odious bargain that I shall never regret having refused , whatever may be the consequences of his denunciation ! ” “ Always this method ! ” thought Judge <NAME> ; “ accusing others to clear himself. ” But he none the less listened with extreme attention to <NAME> ’ s recital of his relations with the adventurer up to the moment when <NAME> let him know that he knew and could reveal the name of the true author of the crime of <NAME> .
__label__0	At this point of his narrative <NAME> gives an account of the `` Old Man of the <NAME> , '' the chief of the <NAME> sect called the <NAME> , who were noted for their religious fanaticism and terrible cruelty .
__label__1	There is no bridesmaid , unless <NAME> is one ; and no better father than <NAME> .
__label__1	That she should struggle against the fascinating influence of his delightful art -- delightful nature I thought it then -- did not surprise me either ; for I knew that she was sometimes jaundiced and perverse .
__label__1	<NAME> does go so far as to say , ’ pursued the meekest of little men , much encouraged , ‘ that what such people miscall their religion , is a vent for their bad humours and arrogance .
__label__0	It is impossible to say .
__label__1	The confined entrance was so dark that it was impossible to make out distinctly what kind of person opened the door ; but it appeared to be an old woman .
__label__1	I don ’ t go there on purpose , you know , but I happen to be in the neighbourhood very often ; and when I find myself there , why -- why I call. ’ ‘ Nat ’ rally , ’ observed the <NAME> .
__label__0	On this very day , just as <NAME> and his party were on their way from <NAME> to <NAME> , the mail dashed by at full speed ; but though the horses were at a gallop , <NAME> caught sight of the glittering weapons of the mounted police that rode by its side , as they swept past in a cloud of dust .
__label__0	Two state-rooms in the rear were , however , unoccupied -- those which had been engaged by <NAME> .
__label__0	When he arrived there , he found a city measuring three miles in circumference , which had been for a long time the capital of the <NAME> , before it was conquered by Gengis-Khan , the grandfather of the reigning emperor .
__label__0	They were determined to struggle to the last minute , to do anything to retard their fall .
__label__1	“ <NAME> , ” says the <NAME> ’ en , “ will you take a observation round the shop. ” “ Well , ” says the man , “ I ’ ve done. ” “ Do you see wot you want ? ” says the <NAME> ’ en “ No , I don ’ t , ” says the man .
__label__1	The breath of the men was cloud , the breath of the mules was cloud , the lights were encircled by cloud , speakers close at hand were not seen for cloud , though their voices and all other sounds were surprisingly clear .
__label__1	how devoutly he wished he could !
__label__1	He seized it with the same rapid impatience which had characterised his speech , and hastily made his way to the other side of the screen .
__label__1	‘ You ’ ll consider yourself guardian , jointly with me , of this child , <NAME> , ’ said my aunt .
__label__0	It was the voice of <NAME> , and the person he addressed was <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> had re-counted the teaspoons , re-weighed the sugar-tongs , made a closer inspection of the milk-pot , and ascertained to a nicety the exact condition of the furniture , down to the very horse-hair seats of the chairs ; and had repeated each process full half a dozen times ; before he began to think that it was time for Mrs. Corney to return .
__label__1	I stopped at the umble point of my learning , and says I , “ Hold hard ! ” When you offered to teach me <NAME> , I knew better .
__label__1	We all got up then ; and my mother said hurriedly that , as it was so late , and <NAME> and <NAME> approved of early hours for young people , perhaps I had better go to bed .
__label__1	You were always driving and riving and shouldering and passing , to that restless degree that I had no chance for my life but in rust and repose .
__label__0	`` They have a herb , '' he says , `` of which they collect great quantities during the summer for the winter ; they esteem it highly , and the men alone use it in the following manner : they dry it in the sun and carry it on their necks in a small skin of an animal in the shape of a bag , with a horn of stone or of wood , then constantly they make the said herb into powder , and put it into one of the ends of the said horn ; they then place a live coal upon it and blow through the other end , and so fill their body with smoke that it issues from the mouth and nostrils , as if from the shaft of a chimney .
__label__0	The <NAME> was no longer moving , the heat was becoming unbearable .
__label__0	To the north the disc of the sun seemed like a ball of fire , already horned by the cutting of the horizon .
__label__0	He could never persuade himself to believe that they should get so near their aim and still miss it .
__label__1	‘ To the old country , sir , ’ I rejoin .
__label__1	‘ That ’ s the pint , sir , ’ interposed <NAME> ; ‘ out vith it , as the father said to his child , when he swallowed a farden. ’ ‘ We want to know , in the first place , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ whether you have any reason to be discontented with your present situation. ’ ‘ Afore I answers that ‘ ere question , gen ’ l ’ m ’ n , ’ replied <NAME> , ‘ I should like to know , in the first place , whether you ’ re a-goin ’ to purwide me with a better ? ’ A sunbeam of placid benevolence played on <NAME> ’ s features as he said , ‘ I have half made up my mind to engage you myself. ’ ‘ Have you , though ? ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	`` I wished to give you a sight of the curious spectacle of a submarine eruption . ''
__label__1	Of <NAME> laughing gaily ; and of <NAME> being so fond of Agnes that she will not be separated from her , but still keeps her hand .
__label__1	Through these streets , <NAME> walked , dragging <NAME> after him ; now stepping into the kennel to embrace at a glance the whole external character of some small public-house ; now jogging on again , as some fancied appearance induced him to believe it too public for his purpose .
__label__1	I wish to prove to <NAME> that I can rise to a heighth of which perhaps she hardly thought me capable .
__label__1	The looks of all of them were dark , repressed , and revengeful , as they listened to the countryman 's story ; the manner of all of them , while it was secret , was authoritative too .
__label__0	This was the cart entering the circle of light , and <NAME> could hear the noise made by the door , as his companions shut it and fastened the interior bars .
__label__1	That ’ s the lad ! ’ <NAME> pulled down his spectacles from his forehead to his eyes , and looked at <NAME> Junior standing upright in the corner : his head presenting the appearance ( which it always did ) of having been newly drawn out of a bucket of cold water ; his small waistcoat rising and falling quickly in the play of his emotions ; and his eyes intently fixed on Mr Carker , without the least reference to his proposed master .
__label__0	This they enclosed with palisades ; and in respect of energy and activity , it might have been mistaken for one of the great cities of the <NAME> .
__label__1	`` Never you mind for me , miss .
__label__0	She will not doubt me for an instant !
__label__0	Thus it may be that , contemporary with the later geological epochs , they are due to the expansion of natural forces .
__label__0	During low water the natives roamed about near the <NAME> , but were not troublesome ; I heard them frequently repeat the word `` <NAME> , '' and by their gestures I understood that they invited me to go on land , an invitation that I declined .
__label__0	<NAME> 's note had evidently been written and sent as soon as the convicts had shown themselves there .
__label__1	'Has it long gone the half-hour ? '
__label__0	The <NAME> left in exchange hatchets and toys which were carried off to the forest with many delighted gestures .
__label__1	We thought it a pity he should go away .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> had not supposed that he should be attacked so soon ; he was rinsing out his mouth when the hubbub began , and did not hear my cries for help .
__label__0	<NAME> jockeys in this steeplechase , this hunt after information , they leaped hedges , crossed rivers , sprang over fences , with the ardor of pure-blooded racers , who will run “ a good first ” or die !
__label__0	There was a shrill shriek of the projectile which traversed the air under the impetus from milliards of milliards of litres of gas developed by the instantaneous deflagration of two thousand tons of meli-melonite .
__label__0	`` He became an honest man again ! ''
__label__1	<NAME> had a composite meal to make , of chops , and porter , and tea ; and indignantly pretended to prepare it for herself , though her sister did all that in quiet reality .
__label__1	Suddenly a spasm shoots across her face and she turns deadly pale .
__label__0	In spite of the roughness of the sea , and constant bad weather throughout his voyage of 108 days , D'Urville had carried on all his usual observations on the height of the waves , which he estimated at 80 and occasionally as much as 100 feet , off <NAME> ; the temperature of the sea at various depths , & c. <NAME> having found a capital supply of fresh water on the right bank of <NAME> , and at a little distance a site suitable for the erection of an observatory , the tents were soon pitched by the sailors , and several officers made a complete tour of the bay , whilst others opened relations with the aborigines , one of whom was induced to go on board , though it was only with the greatest difficulty that he was persuaded to throw away his _Banksia_ , a cone used to retain heat , and to keep the stomach and the front part of the body warm .
__label__1	He ’ s close to the door .
__label__0	It was easy to see that it was composed of blocks of all sizes , from twenty to three hundred feet in height , and of all shapes , round like towers , prismatic like steeples , pyramidal like obelisks , conical like factory chimneys .
__label__0	`` Can not you say whether you have slept well or not ? ''
__label__0	Even <NAME> may be said to have a representative in the person of this miserable Jew. ” “ And even in him , ” said <NAME> , “ perhaps we shall not find so indifferent a representative as we at present imagine. ” The Spaniards who had arrived on board the <NAME> consisted of nine men and a lad of twelve years of age , named <NAME> .
__label__0	And it is not a face of superhuman grandeur which arises before my astonished eyes : it is <NAME> , fierce guardian of the south pole , flaunting the ensign of the <NAME> in those high latitudes !
__label__0	<NAME> remained as if spellbound for a time ; the voice ceased and all was silence .
__label__1	Then they would climb and clamber upstairs with him , and romp about him on the sofa , or group themselves at his knee , a very nosegay of little faces , while he seemed to tell them some story .
__label__1	At first my face was so strange to me that I think I should have put my hands before it and started back but for the encouragement I have mentioned .
__label__1	But forgetting his purpose or changing his mind before he came close to him , he seized his hand and vowed eternal friendship , declaring with an agreeable frankness that from that time forth they were brothers in everything but personal appearance .
__label__0	In this difficult task he was seconded by <NAME> , and by his entire staff , who invariably showed the greatest zeal in their efforts for the advancement of science .
__label__1	‘ I imagined all this when he was a boy .
__label__0	Now , they had been talking in the room for a few minutes , when a light knock was heard at the door .
__label__0	Then passing to another idea , -- “ Think , ” said he , “ how astounded <NAME> and his companions must have been when , next morning , they found the place empty , and the machine flown away ! ” “ I am utterly indifferent about knowing what they may have thought , ” said the reporter .
__label__1	`` I told you this was the growlery , my dear .
__label__1	I shall transact the business : you will transact the pleasure .
__label__1	You feared that I should be beforehand with you .
__label__0	Every hour of our expedition on the raft had been so much lost time !
__label__1	‘ We should all have been lost without <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ I have come here in consequence of receiving this bit of paper , ’ rejoined <NAME> .
__label__0	The same evening <NAME> and <NAME> disappeared in the mists of the horizon .
__label__1	But I should say their cook at the <NAME> wanted a little looking after .
__label__0	`` You must be right , <NAME> , '' was my reply , `` for I feel as if I could do justice to any meal you could put before me . ''
__label__1	Sikes and his companion enveloped their necks and chins in large dark shawls , and drew on their great-coats ; <NAME> , opening a cupboard , brought forth several articles , which he hastily crammed into the pockets .
__label__0	Where was he at this moment ?
__label__1	! ’ ‘ Nonsense ! ’ said <NAME> , turning back again .
__label__1	Her beautiful serene eyes met mine as she came towards me .
__label__1	'She will be persuaded now , ' cried the young lady .
__label__0	After this , <NAME> found another corpse , that of a man of fifty , exhibiting traces of the sufferings that had killed him .
__label__1	They and the accounts were all found correct , and the books and the papers resumed their places in the bag .
__label__1	Staggering as if struck by lightning , he lost his balance and tumbled over the parapet .
__label__1	'She is looking down , and the candle is behind her .
__label__0	`` Yes , he told me himself . ''
__label__0	But to return on board without <NAME> , and after having so completely failed in his search , was what he could not bring himself to do .
__label__1	I entreated <NAME> not to regard this as a thoughtless passion which could ever yield to any other , or had the least resemblance to the boyish fancies that we used to joke about .
__label__1	The turnkey nodded ; and the companion passed in without being asked whom he wanted .
__label__0	`` What a brute I am ! ''
__label__1	But it ’ s very near the sea .
__label__0	Conscious of the superiority which his theoretical and practical knowledge and his services had earned for him above the herd of courtiers , <NAME> naturally felt more keenly than another would have done the unjust treatment he received from <NAME> with regard to certain complaints laid by the people of <NAME> against the <NAME> officers .
__label__0	They had been lying hardly a quarter of an hour , when <NAME> started up with a cry so loud and sudden as instantly to awaken his companions .
__label__1	I saw the wasted limbs -- which a few hours before had been distorted for the amusement of a boisterous gallery , writhing under the tortures of a burning fever -- I heard the clown ’ s shrill laugh , blending with the low murmurings of the dying man .
__label__0	Thus they were condemned to close imprisonment .
__label__0	After taking him aside they made him understand that there was no time to be lost -- that they must make up their minds to act .
__label__1	That ’ s what you ’ ll have to break to her .
__label__0	A little later , we see him exploring the river <NAME> , and advancing , in the north of the continent , to within 225 miles of <NAME> 's Bay .
__label__1	For a little while he sat with his hand over his face , but when he removed it , fell into his usual manner .
__label__1	cried the Dodger at this moment , ' I heard the tinkler . '
__label__1	`` In short , <NAME> , '' he says , `` Jew as you are , you never laid such snares as I 'll contrive for my young brother , <NAME> . '' '
__label__1	In the evening I started , by that conveyance , down the road I had traversed under so many vicissitudes .
__label__1	He might have done it thrice , but the pony kicked up his heels and shook his head , as if he were suddenly taken with convulsions of delight , and <NAME> being frightened , ran away -- not straight to where her mother and <NAME> ’ s mother were , though , lest they should see how red her cheeks were , and should ask her why .
__label__1	The illuminated village had seized hold of the tocsin , and , abolishing the lawful ringer , rang for joy .
__label__1	‘ Where shall we drive you , sir ? ’ said the post-boy .
__label__1	Besides which , she is so charmingly ugly , ’ relapsing into languor .
__label__1	Away , with a shriek , and a roar , and a rattle , from the town , burrowing among the dwellings of men and making the streets hum , flashing out into the meadows for a moment , mining in through the damp earth , booming on in darkness and heavy air , bursting out again into the sunny day so bright and wide ; away , with a shriek , and a roar , and a rattle , through the fields , through the woods , through the corn , through the hay , through the chalk , through the mould , through the clay , through the rock , among objects close at hand and almost in the grasp , ever flying from the traveller , and a deceitful distance ever moving slowly within him : like as in the track of the remorseless monster , <NAME> !
__label__1	‘ Nothing , ‘ Tilda , ’ replied <NAME> , sobbing .
__label__0	Here expecting to be able to gain a few hours time by signalling to the outer telegraph station on <NAME> , he had caused to be painted on a sail in large black letters : `` THE <NAME> ARE BACK ! ''
__label__1	‘ You have answered very well , <NAME> .
__label__1	He had left a letter at the <NAME> addressed to his physician , and his physician had got the letter , and the letter would be produced at the <NAME> on the morrow , and it would fall like a thunderbolt upon the multitude he had deluded .
__label__1	Nearly two thousand pounds profit from him already though .
__label__1	He turned his head as they entered , and showed the surprise with which he saw a stranger .
__label__0	`` My good sir , there will always be enough for a solitary individual ; besides , once arrived up there , I shall do my best to economize , and not to breathe except on grand occasions ! ''
__label__1	We have been speaking of you every day. ’ ‘ To tell you the truth , sir , I am glad to find you alone , ’ said <NAME> , with some natural hesitation ; ‘ for I am anxious to say something to you .
__label__1	“ Why , <NAME> , ” says she -- and she coom a deal closer and squeedged a deal harder than she ’ d deane afore -- “ dost thou think it ’ s nat ’ ral noo , that having such a proper mun as thou to keep company wi ’ , I ’ d ever tak ’ opp wi ’ such a leetle scanty whipper-snapper as yon ? ” she says .
__label__1	`` It would n't have been much to his advantage to have been clapped into prison by the whole bill and judgment trade of <NAME> . ''
__label__1	Think of her ; think of all the sorrows and afflictions you have shared together ; of all the trials , and all the peaceful pleasures , you have jointly known. ’ ‘ I do .
__label__1	As my father 's came there .
__label__0	`` There 's something there , evidently , '' said the doctor .
__label__1	The removal of <NAME> Dorrit herself from their customary association , did not mend the matter .
__label__0	There they managed to arrange for him a couch of sea-weed which still remained almost dry .
__label__1	If my affection has been truly disinterested , <NAME> , let me prove it now ! ’ Mr <NAME> shot back abruptly into the parlour , and said , wringing <NAME> by the hand : ‘ How-de-do ?
__label__1	‘ O , you Fool ! ’ said Mrs. Sparsit , when she was alone at her supper .
__label__0	`` Can you believe that you will ever die ? ''
__label__0	The colonists of <NAME> , too had explored <NAME> , but so little disposition was there at this time to believe in the existence of a new world , that <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> were all thought to be a continuation of the <NAME> continent .
__label__1	I wo n't squeeze you tighter than I can help .
__label__0	A party of <NAME> led the explorers to their settlement on an island in the river .
__label__0	<NAME> , draughts , cards , dominoes -- everything in fact , but a billiard table ? ''
__label__1	Now pray remark , <NAME> , and Mr Sols , the depth of my wife ’ s penetration .
__label__1	Mrs. Squeers , sir , was as partial to that lad as if he had been her own ; the attention , sir , that was bestowed upon that boy in his illness !
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> did not object to this arrangement , but urged that before any step could possibly be taken in it , it must be submitted to my guardian .
__label__1	A dry subject for a young lady , but an important subject too .
__label__0	“ Yes ; and I heard afterward that the <NAME> was saved. ” “ Saved ! ” exclaimed young <NAME> , his very life hanging on the lips of the <NAME> .
__label__0	Hatteras could not employ this device on an ice-field which perhaps was moving ; on firm land it would have been possible ; and the uncertainty of their route made it doubtful whether they would return by the same path .
__label__0	Perhaps we may have to fire ; so we have one shot in the rifle ; four for the two muskets ; twelve in the two revolvers ; or seventeen in all , which might be fired in a quarter of a minute .
__label__0	It was not the iceberg itself , as yet , but vast fields cemented by the cold .
__label__1	Without presuming to decide where doctors disagreed , it did appear to <NAME> , viewing it as a question of common sense and not of so-called legal penetration , that this new system was -- might be , in the presence of so great an authority -- say , <NAME> ?
__label__1	How could they be near us , and be green and fresh ?
__label__0	The plants themselves were infected by a similar strange metamorphosis .
__label__0	At any rate , it was not enough to frighten away the band , and <NAME> had only just time to get up to <NAME> , where at least he was in safety .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> ! ’ ‘ You were brought up by an uncle , then ? ’ said I .
__label__1	He stood for a moment at his own hall door , looking sedately at the elegant equipage as it rattled away .
__label__0	The trees , belonging to the species already discovered , were magnificent .
__label__1	'You should , indeed , ' replied <NAME> .
__label__0	His eye is prompt , his arm sure . ''
__label__0	It was impossible to reach the crater of <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> ? ’ cried the little creature , glancing sharply at my face , and then peeping round at <NAME> ’ s .
__label__0	The population appeared considerable , and was estimated at 30,000 in <NAME> alone .
__label__1	‘ Get up , pig ! ’ growled the first .
__label__1	The general aspect of the room recalled him to himself at once ; but he had no sooner cast his eye on the figure of a man who was brooding over the dusty fire , than , letting his hat fall on the floor , he stood perfectly fixed and immovable with astonishment .
__label__1	I wonder what you will say when you come to this !
__label__0	This was a sign of friendship ; harmony followed , and war and bloodshed were thought of no more .
__label__0	<NAME> with the resemblance of the language and habits of the Indians of these parts to those of the <NAME> , <NAME> was very soon persuaded that he was not far distant from that river , and made several excursions in order to approach it .
__label__0	On the 12th of December , 1769 , <NAME> descried land in 35 degrees 37 minutes S .
__label__1	‘ Now , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , calmly feeling for his whisker , ‘ it won ’ t do .
__label__1	‘ Demd scarce , or I shouldn ’ t want it , ’ interrupted <NAME> .
__label__1	He had been sobbing violently in his conflict with the <NAME> , and his face was wet with tears .
__label__0	It was , however , the <NAME> , as he became assured when he saw the water rising , although the wind was not violent .
__label__1	Look over your hand , <NAME> , and see what you have .
__label__0	What was his dismay , when he found nothing left of the fortress but a few ashes !
__label__1	Even in this temple of good intentions , an exceptionally sharp boy exceptionally determined to learn , could learn something , and , having learned it , could impart it much better than the teachers ; as being more knowing than they , and not at the disadvantage in which they stood towards the shrewder pupils .
__label__0	And , besides , this side , looking towards the east , is not exposed as the other is to the trade-winds , which in this hemisphere blow from the northwest. ” “ Then , captain , ” replied the sailor , “ let us build a house on the edge of the lake .
__label__0	As for the traces which <NAME> ought to have left of his passage through the wood , there was not a vestige of them visible : so they followed the barely perceptible paths along which <NAME> had tracked some enemy , and which the dense foliage darkly overshadowed .
__label__1	Now attend a moment ! ’ said the old man .
__label__1	They listened as he spoke again within its silent walls .
__label__0	We waited silent and motionless to learn the fate of <NAME> , although the evil spirit of the crew was but little worthy of our pity .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> in love ! ’ repeated my aunt .
__label__1	I took the opportunity of moving well behind my table .
__label__1	<NAME> and water I alwayth take. ’ He had already called for a glass , and now called for another .
__label__1	The brothers were in a perfect ecstasy ; and their insisting on saluting the ladies all round , before they would permit them to retire , gave occasion to the superannuated bank clerk to say so many good things , that he quite outshone himself , and was looked upon as a prodigy of humour .
__label__1	He is as dead as the Doges ! ’ Mrs General , always on her coach-box keeping the proprieties well together , took pains to form a surface on her very dear young friend , and Mrs General ’ s very dear young friend tried hard to receive it .
__label__1	‘ For what did I say to myself arter having amused myself with that there stretch of a comic idea , as a sort of a playful game ?
__label__1	‘ And if it be a necessity— ’ <NAME> faltered .
__label__1	'Not for the world , ' replied <NAME> .
__label__0	“ There are other offenders besides political exiles in <NAME> , ” said the chief of police .
__label__1	I hope they will manage their little income. ’ ‘ Oh !
__label__0	Across these openings were thrown bridges which could be easily destroyed .
__label__0	The <NAME> carries provisions for five or six years , and coal in proportion .
__label__0	It did not appear likely that <NAME> would be threatened unless the ground was shaken by an earthquake .
__label__0	<NAME> could scarcely contain his anger .
__label__0	<NAME> had thought of all this ; but he intended to act prudently and without pushing things to extremes .
__label__0	Following the example of <NAME> , who had set up his observatory on the islet of <NAME> , <NAME> landed there and took his observations , whilst his people traded with the natives , who were , throughout his stay , peaceful , friendly , and civil .
__label__1	'So I _do_ do as she bids me , ' replied <NAME> ; ' I should n't have been milled , if it had n't been for her advice .
__label__1	In this , too , there is perhaps more dandyism at <NAME> than the brilliant and distinguished circle will find good for itself in the long run .
__label__1	He had taken two or three undecided turns up and down while uttering these broken sentences , retaining the poker in one hand and rubbing his hair with the other , with a good-natured vexation at once so whimsical and so lovable that I am sure we were more delighted with him than we could possibly have expressed in any words .
__label__1	'How do you do , sir ?
__label__1	‘ The night afore the last day o ’ the last election here , the opposite party bribed the barmaid at the <NAME> , to hocus the brandy-and-water of fourteen unpolled electors as was a-stoppin ’ in the house. ’ ‘ What do you mean by “ hocussing ” brandy-and-water ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
__label__0	One evening , after a warm day in which the ice had given unmistakable signs of breaking up , he turned the conversation to the question of an open sea .
__label__0	After exploring Babylonia he went to <NAME> , and as the express purpose of his travels was to collect all the information he could relating to the lengthy wars that had taken place between the Persians and <NAME> , he was most anxious to visit the spots where the battles had been fought .
__label__1	“ He may have been married already , and her cruel mortification may have been a part of her half-brother 's scheme , ” said <NAME> .
__label__0	thought the doctor , `` what is that ? ''
__label__1	At first , I had to shut some gates after me , and now and then to stand still while the cattle that were lying in the banked-up pathway arose and blundered down among the grass and reeds .
__label__1	The same great manufacturer , always with an immense variety of work on hand , in every stage of development , passed <NAME> onward in his mill , and worked her up into a very pretty article indeed .
__label__1	“ You with an old father , and you with pleasant and playful ways ? ” “ Well ! ” returned <NAME> .
__label__1	Then , what submission , what cringing and fawning , what servility , what abject humiliation !
__label__0	Yes , but not for everything !
__label__1	`` The house is yonder , '' <NAME> exclaimed .
__label__1	Affery was the first to move , and she , wringing her hands , pursued her mistress .
__label__1	said the Jew , scowling fiercely on the boy .
__label__1	I was a boyish husband as to years .
__label__0	<NAME> , having by a rapid movement firmly fixed his hat upon his head , calmly continued his harangue : `` There is no one among you , my brave colleagues , who has not seen the <NAME> , or , at least , heard speak of it .
__label__0	After having appointed <NAME> de la <NAME> , <NAME> de <NAME> , viceroy of <NAME> , he caused five vessels to be fitted out , which being laden with provisions and ammunition for two years , were to transport <NAME> and a certain number of soldiers , artizans , and gentlemen to the new colony , which they were about to establish .
__label__1	Something is wrong somewhere , but what something , what may come of it , to whom , when , and from which unthought of and unheard of quarter is the puzzle of his life .
__label__0	`` Yes , M. Aronnax ; you have the right to be proud of your countryman .
__label__0	Avoiding <NAME> , whose inhabitants are fanatics and thieves , <NAME> entered <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ The same mistake presents itself to me , in one shape or other , at every turn , ’ said brother Charles .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> much so , for our peace , perhaps , my dear , ’ returned her mother ; ‘ but we won ’ t complain .
__label__1	The younger brother stood apart .
__label__1	What should you say was the cause for those lights , now ? ’ The scientific gentleman smilingly anticipated <NAME> ’ s reply that he could assign no cause for them at all .
__label__0	How he labored to recover himself by work !
__label__0	<NAME> explained that he only wanted to recover their books and papers , and to visit the scene of their death ; and the sultan in reply denied having anything belonging to them , adding a warning against his guest 's going to the place where they died , for it was a `` very bad place . ''
__label__0	The old myth of the <NAME> realized !
__label__0	This material , which consists of the ramicles of a certain palm-tree growing very abundantly on the river banks , is in universal use in the district .
__label__1	After a few words of course , they sallied into the street .
__label__0	This profusion of winged beings enlivened the scene .
__label__0	`` The air confined in his body , freed from external pressure , would burst him like a shell , or like a balloon that suddenly rises to too great a height in the air !
__label__1	Every possible inquiry was made , and every place was searched .
__label__0	Send your men to the forecastle , sir . ''
__label__0	It was with these almost miserable means , which , however , had given <NAME> much trouble to collect , that he prepared to wage war with a sovereign whose dominions were of greater extent than those appertaining to the King of <NAME> -- an enterprise from which he would have turned back if he had foreseen half its difficulties .
__label__0	These unfortunate people , consisting of <NAME> , <NAME> , soldiers and civilians , numbered some thousands , and formed a column which extended over several versts .
__label__0	In face they resemble the <NAME> , but they have rounder chins , and they are far less black .
__label__0	On the 21st April , <NAME> passed between the <NAME> and <NAME> , in order to avoid the <NAME> , where he might have met some <NAME> pirates , and after a good voyage he arrived at <NAME> on the 7th August , 1806 .
__label__0	He selected Yves-Joseph de <NAME> .
__label__1	Supposing then , for instance -- any unlikely thing will do for a supposition -- that you and your mother were to have a serious quarrel. ’ ‘ My dear <NAME> , ’ interposed Mrs. <NAME> , laughing good-naturedly , ‘ suggest some other supposition !
__label__1	There ’ s the <NAME> promoted to that living at four hundred and fifty pounds a year ; there are our two boys receiving the very best education , and distinguishing themselves as steady scholars and good fellows ; there are three of the girls married very comfortably ; there are three more living with us ; there are three more keeping house for the <NAME> since Mrs. <NAME> ’ s decease ; and all of them happy. ’ ‘ Except -- ’ I suggest .
__label__1	‘ You are cold ; I felt you tremble .
__label__1	Come. ’ Down they sat to breakfast , but it was evident , notwithstanding the boasting of <NAME> , that he laboured under a very considerable degree of nervousness , of which loss of appetite , a propensity to upset the tea-things , a spectral attempt at drollery , and an irresistible inclination to look at the clock , every other second , were among the principal symptoms .
__label__0	The guests of the <NAME> immediately began to stream towards the supper-rooms .
__label__0	They had a famous chief , named <NAME> , a real Vercingetorix , so that you need not be astonished that the war with the <NAME> has become chronic in the <NAME> , for in it is the famous tribe of the <NAME> , who defend their lands under the leadership of <NAME> Thompson. ” “ But , ” said <NAME> , “ are not the <NAME> in possession of the principal points in <NAME> ? ” “ <NAME> , dear <NAME> , ” replied <NAME> .
__label__1	I was obliged to hurry away ; I was kept out late ; and I felt all night such pangs of remorse as made me miserable .
__label__1	After a short absence ( during which he could be heard to speak in a softened soothing tone ) he returned , bearing in his hand a lamp .
__label__0	He confined himself to the bare proposition , adding that the voyage to <NAME> was only five or six days -- the distance , in fact , being only about a thousand miles .
__label__0	The Nanay with its left bank bounded it to the north for about a mile , and for nearly the same distance to the east it ran along the bank of the larger river .
__label__1	But <NAME> , looking up and smiling through her tears , cried , `` Yes , I do !
__label__0	Soon <NAME> 's barks ceased , and the vessel continued her course at a few cable-lengths from the coast .
__label__0	The latter held him as in a vice , and it was impossible for him to move .
__label__0	The public awaited with interest its final decision .
__label__1	When he reached home Mrs. Maylie was sitting in the little parlour .
__label__1	‘ If not , we must try the young lady ’ s persuasion ; and that is what anybody but you would have done at first. ’ <NAME> was taking a pinch of snuff with various grotesque contractions of countenance , eulogistic of the persuasive powers appertaining unto young ladies , when the murmur of inquiry and answer was heard in the outer office , and <NAME> tapped at the door .
__label__0	The sailors went on shore and saw the <NAME> , the Gulf of <NAME> , and reached the <NAME> del Retrete_ or _de los <NAME> , in the <NAME> of <NAME> .
__label__1	I am rejoiced to see you , <NAME> , even under present circumstances. ’ I believed that ; for he seemed to relish them very much .
__label__0	But in addition to this there were certain facts which were undeniable .
__label__1	<NAME> , delighted to be of use , brought down the books under his arm in a great bustle ; and waited , cap in hand , to hear what message he was to take .
__label__1	My Lady , with a disdainful gesture of the hand that holds the screen , assures him of his being worth no complaint from her .
__label__1	Many flaunting dolls had to be gaily dressed , before the money was in the dressmaker ’ s pocket to get mourning for Mr Dolls .
__label__1	<NAME> was thinking , with a sneer upon his lips , on the altered manner of <NAME> that day , and how soon their fellowship in a bad design had lowered his pride and established a familiarity between them , when his attentive ear caught the rustling of a female dress upon the stairs , and the footstep of a man .
__label__1	Bear with a wretch , <NAME> , bear with a wretch , ma ’ am , who feels the noble sacrifices you make for him , but is goaded almost to madness , ’ Mr <NAME> slapped his forehead , ‘ when he thinks of competing with the rich and influential. ’ ‘ When you have to compete with the rich and influential , it will probably be mentioned to you , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ in good time .
__label__1	“ Nothing was ever discovered , <NAME> ? ” “ Nothing. ” “ Do you know what is become of <NAME> ? ” “ I should think from the color of his clothes that he is working in the quarries. ” “ Of course you have seen him then ? -- Why are you looking at that dark tree in the lane ? ” “ I saw him there , on the night she died. ” “ That was not the last time either , <NAME> ? ” “ <NAME> ; I have seen him there , since we have been walking here. -- It is of no use , ” said <NAME> , laying her hand upon my arm , as I was for running out , “ you know I would not deceive you ; he was not there a minute , and he is gone. ” It revived my utmost indignation to find that she was still pursued by this fellow , and I felt inveterate against him .
__label__0	`` Meanwhile the <NAME> had been sent to <NAME> for repairs .
__label__0	Heads where _x_ ’ s knocked against _x_ ’ s like nuts in a bag , brains which rejoiced in algebraic formulæ , hands which threw about triple integrals as an equilibrist plays with glasses and bottles , intelligences which understood this sort of thing : ∫∫∫Φ ( _xyz_ ) _dx dy dz_ —these were the wise men who appeared worthy of all the admiration of a woman , attracted to them proportionally to their mass and in inverse ratio to the square of their distances .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> ’ s a little restless in his sleep .
__label__0	He was then to survey the whole of the north-west coast , from 30 degrees N. lat .
__label__0	And the only man who could have furnished this evidence had been killed through <NAME> !
__label__1	At length , the two money-lenders obtained shelter in a house next door , and , being accommodated with a ladder , clambered over the wall of the back-yard -- which was not a high one -- and descended in safety on the other side .
__label__0	At half-past one , notwithstanding all efforts , the raft came up against a thick barrier and stuck fast .
__label__1	Why not , Mr Carker ? ’ said the boy .
__label__1	<NAME> engaged beds for himself and <NAME> at the inn where the coach stopped , and repaired , without the delay of another moment , to the lodgings of <NAME> ; for his anxiety and impatience had increased with every succeeding minute , and were almost beyond control .
__label__0	`` I ca n't say the same of you , '' replied <NAME> ; `` you had at least one sensible moment in all your lives , and that was about an hour ago ! ''
__label__1	‘ You have a packet left with you which you were to give to <NAME> , if it was not reclaimed before this place closed to-night. ’ ‘ Yes. ’ ‘ I reclaim it. ’ Little <NAME> took it from her bosom , and gave it into her hand , which remained stretched out after receiving it .
__label__1	Knowing you were alone , was it possible that I could stay away ? ’ ‘ You may hang your head , to make yourself the more attractive ; _I_ don ’ t know what they see in you when you hold it up , ’ thought Mrs. <NAME> ; ‘ but you little think , my dearest love , whose eyes are on you ! ’ That she hung her head , was certain .
__label__1	We both grub on in a muddle .
__label__0	They had no doubt about it themselves !
__label__0	An irresistible attraction glued me to the glass !
__label__1	Ruin him , seize and sell his lands and goods , drive him from house and home , and drag him forth a beggar in his old age , to die in a common jail. ” ‘ “ But the costs , my dear Sir , the costs of all this , ” reasoned the attorney , when he had recovered from his momentary surprise .
__label__0	About ten of them were there , lashing the water with their powerful tails , and attacking the <NAME> with the long teeth of their lower jaw .
__label__0	He was told that its color came simply from the presence of organic corpuscles .
__label__1	I have done what I thowt should be done , but I never looked fur any good to come of my stan ’ ning where I do .
__label__0	My uncle was fearful to be too ready with his supply of food .
__label__0	<NAME> rejoiced in a well-sheltered harbor , which enabled her to utilize all the rich products of the <NAME> and the <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> Tsing signifies `` heavenly spot , '' and the town owes this name to its agreeable climate and clear blue sky , and the fertility of its neighbourhood .
__label__1	‘ Wery desp ’ rate ch ’ racter , your Wash-up , ’ replied <NAME> .
__label__1	I have been throwed , all sorts of styles , all my life ! ''
__label__1	Oh , bless him , bless him ! ’ mumbled the old woman , holding up her skinny hand , and grinning frightfully at her daughter .
__label__1	‘ How very odd you are to-day , my dear !
__label__0	No misfortune could damp his ardour , his was one of those great spirits which seem only invigorated by trouble and disasters .
__label__1	you needn ’ t mind reading that , ’ interrupted the client .
__label__0	The manufacture of a hand-saw cost infinite trouble , but at last an instrument was obtained which , when vigorously handled , could divide the ligneous fibers of the wood .
__label__1	We arranged a time for <NAME> to come out by the coach and share my early dinner .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , you amaze me , ’ cried <NAME> .
__label__0	He had to live somehow , and so he joined this not very honorable company ; they neither asked him who he was nor whence he came , and so <NAME> became a captain of the woods , and for many years he followed the trade of a chaser of men .
__label__1	That I was ashamed to tell him exactly how I was placed , and what I had come down to , I do not seek to conceal ; but I hope my reluctance was not quite an unworthy one .
__label__1	-- Of _shoes_ , sir , ' said <NAME> , turning upon him , and laying great emphasis on the word ; 'seized the loaded pistol that always goes upstairs with the plate-basket ; and walked on tiptoes to his room .
__label__0	<NAME> and silver pipes , and canes , dazzled the eye in every direction .
__label__1	<NAME> ! ’ When <NAME> arrived at this point , he turned the corner at which he had been long hesitating , and fell fast asleep .
__label__0	Even the <NAME> would leave its bed and float away into space .
__label__1	In the midst of this sensation , the beadle arrives .
__label__1	Let him take care of his face ! ” “ And you have observed , my wife , ” said <NAME> , in a deprecatory manner , “ the anguish of his daughter , which must be a dreadful anguish to him ! ” “ I have observed his daughter , ” repeated madame ; “ yes , I have observed his daughter , more times than one .
__label__0	The young girl in her turn , exhibited , not a passport , since passports are no longer required in <NAME> , but a permit indorsed with a private seal , and which seemed to be of a special character .
__label__0	But the colonists ’ object was not simply to admire the magnificent vegetation .
__label__1	Some of us have damp ways , and some of us have dry ways .
__label__1	`` Quite strong enough for that , miss ! ''
__label__0	But was not his calm only apparent ?
__label__0	There was a subject for conversation which the whole evening could not exhaust .
__label__1	With the thought , her purity and goodness came before him in their brightest light .
__label__1	My aunt being supremely indifferent to Mrs. Crupp ’ s opinion and everybody else ’ s , and rather favouring than discouraging the idea , Mrs. Crupp , of late the bold , became within a few days so faint-hearted , that rather than encounter my aunt upon the staircase , she would endeavour to hide her portly form behind doors -- leaving visible , however , a wide margin of flannel petticoat -- or would shrink into dark corners .
__label__0	While such were the thoughts of those occupying the first carriage , what was happening in the second ?
__label__0	Armed with javelins , they uttered shrill cries , and showed dispositions far from peaceful .
__label__1	The perfect formation of that accomplished lady ’ s surface rendered it difficult to displace an atom of its genteel glaze , but <NAME> thought she descried a slight thaw of triumph in a corner of her frosty eye .
__label__0	<NAME> took great delight in arranging it with her own hands , and adorning it for the reception of the loved inmate .
__label__1	‘ I don ’ t mind it at all .
__label__0	But <NAME> did not look back .
__label__0	When I reflected that this marvellous electric agent , after having afforded motion , heat , and light to the <NAME> , still protected her from outward attack , and transformed her into an ark of safety which no profane hand might touch without being thunderstricken , my admiration was unbounded , and from the structure it extended to the engineer who had called it into existence .
__label__1	Not near the mark , not near the mark. ’ ‘ Oh ! ’ said <NAME> , watching him as he benevolently gulped down a good draught of his mixture .
__label__1	For example , these ravishing ear-rings and this necklace so superb to correspond , were what one called a love-gift .
__label__0	He had been to the <NAME> , to <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , and had succeeded in finding an important point on the western coast of <NAME> , where the establishment of a <NAME> colony seemed to him easy , and its prosperity certain .
__label__1	I claimed a share in the profits of some business I brought to you , and , as I persisted , you arrested me for an old advance of ten pounds , odd shillings , including interest at fifty per cent , or so. ’ ‘ I remember something of it , ’ replied <NAME> , carelessly .
__label__1	The furniture was all very solid and good , like his watch-chain .
__label__0	`` I see a vast lake black as pitch and round as a crater ; it is surrounded by such lofty mountains that their shadows reach clear across , rendering the interior quite invisible ! ''
__label__1	Indeed , I have , now and again , been more surprised by printed news that I have read of myself , than by any printed news that I have ever read in my present state of existence .
__label__0	He seemed to me like a genie of the sea ; and , as he walked before me , I could not help admiring his stature , which was outlined in black on the luminous horizon .
__label__1	I looked at him eagerly when he looked at me , and slightly moved my hands and shook my head .
__label__0	I say seventy-five fathoms , though I had no instrument by which to judge the distance .
__label__1	I justify myself by the authority of these Books , ’ she cried , with stern emphasis , and appearing from the sound that followed to strike the dead-weight of her arm upon the table .
__label__0	`` Say 'our ' boat , at least , <NAME> , '' replied the engineer , disarmed for the moment .
__label__1	How they came there , or how long they had been there , <NAME> didn ’ t know ; but when he saw them , he sat up in bed , and answered all the <NAME> ’ s questions at full length , and whispered to him that <NAME> was not to know anything about it , if he pleased , and that he had set his mind upon her coming to the party .
__label__1	Her eyes met mine for but an instant , yet I saw how much she knew of what had passed .
__label__1	‘ I hope there is ! ’ replied Kate .
__label__0	15 Merchant of <NAME> .
__label__0	It was not until the 2nd of January in the present year ( 1840 ) that they sighted land -- east of the <NAME> .
__label__0	[ Illustration ] <NAME> took things less philosophically , so eager was he to renew his explorations .
__label__1	‘ And here ’ s the sunny place on the white wall where they one day measured one another .
__label__1	‘ We shall be very slow to-day , dear , ’ she said , as they toiled painfully through the streets ; ‘ my feet are sore , and I have pains in all my limbs from the wet of yesterday .
__label__1	The prisoner had got into a coach , and his daughter had followed him , when <NAME> 's feet were arrested on the step by his asking , miserably , for his shoemaking tools and the unfinished shoes .
__label__1	On this point opinion was divided .
__label__0	Let Sunday be a day of rest ; you will see , <NAME> , that the <NAME> is read as usual ; the religious exercises do the men good , and a sailor more than any one ought to put his trust in <NAME> . ''
__label__0	`` Suppose what ca n't be supposed , '' replied the matter-of-fact <NAME> , `` what can not possibly be supposed , unless indeed the original impulse proved too weak .
__label__1	Wherever I looked I saw the ominous words that ran in it repeated .
__label__1	‘ Do you know , young man , ’ whispered <NAME> , drawing his chair closer to <NAME> , ‘ whether she has left <NAME> anything ? ’ ‘ Who ’ s he ? ’ inquired Sam .
__label__1	Mrs Tickit , though minutely circumstantial in her reply , had no settled opinion between five seconds and ten minutes .
__label__1	“ Dear boy , ” he said , as I sat down by his bed : “ I thought you was late .
__label__0	I hope you will not make me regret that I consented to give you a passage on the <NAME> . ''
__label__0	Waiting for a ship might be a tedious affair , for <NAME> is not much frequented .
__label__1	Another soft knock at the outer door attracts his attention as he goes down-stairs .
__label__0	His plan was bold , but it might succeed , thanks to the darkness of the night .
__label__1	‘ Well , so your old master and young mistress have gone ? ’ ‘ Where ? ’ rejoined <NAME> , looking round .
__label__0	This meadow was to be surrounded by a palisade , high enough to prevent even the most agile animals from leaping over .
__label__1	<NAME> , <NAME> , admission for admission .
__label__0	His first act was to vigorously wring the hand which <NAME> extended to him .
__label__1	Try easy now. ’ He tried easy now ; but the luck resisted ; wouldn ’ t come .
__label__1	'Well , then , ' rejoined <NAME> , ' I would n't .
__label__0	quick ! ” And these daring men did not hesitate a moment to avail themselves of this last desperate means of escape .
__label__1	He thinks he has awakened his friend .
__label__1	What could have made them so late ?
__label__1	Little <NAME> came out wonderfully , told various comic stories , and sang a serious song which was almost as funny as the anecdotes .
__label__1	Here , a chaos of carts , overthrown and jumbled together , lay topsy-turvy at the bottom of a steep unnatural hill ; there , confused treasures of iron soaked and rusted in something that had accidentally become a pond .
__label__1	Some said one thing , and some another ; but all talked together , and all agreed upon two points : first , that it was very meritorious and highly praiseworthy in Mrs. Kenwigs to do as she had done : and secondly , that there never was such a skilful and scientific doctor as that Dr Lumbey .
__label__1	Whispering to <NAME> that <NAME> had never in his life expressed surprise , and was considered not to know what it meant , the <NAME> watched him as he eyed his mast-head , and afterwards swept the horizon ; and when the revolving eye seemed to be coming round in his direction , said : ‘ <NAME> , my lad , how fares it ? ’ A deep , gruff , husky utterance , which seemed to have no connexion with <NAME> , and certainly had not the least effect upon his face , replied , ‘ Ay , ay , shipmet , how goes it ? ’ At the same time <NAME> ’ s right hand and arm , emerging from a pocket , shook the <NAME> ’ s , and went back again .
__label__0	“ Doctor Krapf proposes to push forward , in the west , by way of the <NAME> , a river lying under the equator .
__label__0	The heavens had remained wonderfully clear .
__label__0	“ There is some station in this desert , then , ” said <NAME> , “ and hunters too , for these are regular setters. ” Paganel was just about to recount his nocturnal experiences , when two young men appeared , mounted on horses of the most perfect breed , true “ hunters. ” The two gentlemen dressed in elegant hunting costume , stopped at the sight of the little group camping in gipsy fashion .
__label__0	But what sort of a sailor are you ? ” “ Everyone can be a sailor when he must , ” said <NAME> calmly .
__label__0	The murmur began again ; I listened , and it seemed to me that a voice -- a voice which I did not know -- whispered these words : -- `` Pym .
__label__1	It was on the very next day after he had eased his mind by arriving at this decision , that the Major , sitting at his breakfast , saw an apparition so tremendous and wonderful in <NAME> Tox ’ s little drawing-room , that he remained for some time rooted to his chair ; then , rushing into the next room , returned with a double-barrelled opera-glass , through which he surveyed it intently for some minutes .
__label__0	`` Yes , two or three of those terrible shocks , so common in these regions where the sea penetrates by infiltration , and a day comes when the quantity of accumulated vapour makes its way out and destroys everything on the surface . ''
__label__0	As for <NAME> , he seemed to have heard these particulars for the first time .
__label__1	And now , ’ said <NAME> , with a real and genuine earnestness shining through the levity of his manner and his slipshod speech , ‘ I do conjure my relative , not to stop half way , but to set right , as far as she can , whatever she has done wrong -- not for the honour of her family , not for her own fame , not for any of those considerations which unfortunate circumstances have induced her to regard as hollow , and in point of fact , as approaching to humbug -- but because it is wrong , and not right. ’ <NAME> ’ s legs consented to take him away after this ; and leaving them alone together , he shut the door .
__label__0	`` No , '' exclaimed <NAME> , after some moments , `` no , we are not falling !
__label__1	He passed a great many public-houses ; but , at length paused before one in a by-way , whose parlour , as he gathered from a hasty peep over the blinds , was deserted , save by one solitary customer .
__label__0	`` Perhaps in <NAME> ; you know the <NAME> is a rapid traveller .
__label__1	He knew himself by no other name than One Hundred and <NAME> , <NAME> , when he made shoes under my care .
__label__1	Everything was so strange -- the stranger from its being night in the day-time , the candles burning with a white flame , and looking raw and cold -- that I read the words in the newspaper without knowing what they meant and found myself reading the same words repeatedly .
__label__1	To this favour , <NAME> immediately replied , with his respectful compliments , that he would have the honour of waiting on the <NAME> , at the time appointed ; accompanied , in accordance with their kind permission , by his friend <NAME> of the <NAME> .
__label__1	So far , we are not pursued. ” Houses in twos and threes pass by us , solitary farms , ruinous buildings , dye-works , tanneries , and the like , open country , avenues of leafless trees .
__label__0	This evening we shall reach the confluence of the <NAME> and <NAME> , and after that there is not much chance of meeting natives on the way to Auckland. ” “ How far is it now , ” said <NAME> , “ to the confluence of the <NAME> and <NAME> ? ” “ Fifteen miles ; just about what we did yesterday. ” “ But we shall be terribly delayed if this interminable scrub continues to obstruct our path. ” “ No , ” said <NAME> , “ we shall follow the banks of the <NAME> , and then we shall have no obstacle , but on the contrary , a very easy road. ” “ Well , then , ” said <NAME> , seeing the ladies ready , “ let us make a start. ” During the early part of the day , the thick brushwood seriously impeded their progress .
__label__1	hush ! ’ cried <NAME> , suddenly starting up , and covering <NAME> ’ s mouth with his trembling hand .
__label__1	‘ Not if your wish is gratified , ’ replied <NAME> .
__label__1	The design was efficacious ; for I remember that my mother seemed more at ease during the rest of the evening , and that <NAME> observed her less .
__label__1	One of <NAME> ’ s friends was named <NAME> , and the other <NAME> .
__label__0	But hang me , if I can endure your Algebra ! ''
__label__1	At this early hour many sickly girls , whose business , like that of the poor worm , is to produce , with patient toil , the finery that bedecks the thoughtless and luxurious , traverse our streets , making towards the scene of their daily labour , and catching , as if by stealth , in their hurried walk , the only gasp of wholesome air and glimpse of sunlight which cheer their monotonous existence during the long train of hours that make a working day .
__label__1	He had been stoned in the streets .
__label__1	After great difficulty and much puzzling , he contrived to read as follows : -- My dear young Man .
__label__1	<NAME> , I have heard from the woman who would have been my wife if I had lived , the revolting truth that I should have purchased her , caring nothing for me , as a <NAME> buys a slave .
__label__1	All these proceedings occupied <NAME> so much , that it was not until the following day that he saw <NAME> again .
__label__1	Mrs. Crewler couldn ’ t see me before we left -- couldn ’ t forgive me , then , for depriving her of her child -- but she is a good creature , and has done so since .
__label__1	‘ It really , ’ said <NAME> , suddenly , taking a letter out of his pocket , and giving it to me , ‘ put <NAME> quite out of my head ! ’ The letter ( <NAME> never missed any possible opportunity of writing a letter ) was addressed to me , ‘ By the kindness of T. Traddles , <NAME> , of the <NAME> Temple. ’ It ran thus : -- ‘ You may possibly not be unprepared to receive the intimation that something has turned up .
__label__0	<NAME> and <NAME> were ahead , choosing the way and looking out for game .
__label__1	Their money may be soon got out of them , without violence , ’ said the man .
__label__0	The ground had once more become a dead level , the last mountains of the <NAME> were passed , and a long carpet of verdure unrolled itself over the monotonous prairie beneath the horses ’ tread .
__label__1	Within , were a few wooden partitions , behind which such customers as found it more convenient to take away their dinners in stomachs than in their hands , Packed their purchases in solitude .
__label__1	‘ You wanted the lord , did you ? ’ he said , stopping short when he reached the door , as if a new light had broken in upon him , and confronting <NAME> again .
__label__1	I mean to burn him at last. ’ ‘ Ha ha ! ’ cried <NAME> .
__label__0	“ Come , <NAME> , come , ” said <NAME> .
__label__0	This day , the 18th of March , there remained only provisions for two days , although they limited their consumption to the bare necessaries of life .
__label__0	On the 21st June the <NAME> once more set sail and touched at <NAME> , and at the <NAME> , where D'Urville had hoped to meet <NAME> , who would have been able to give him some valuable hints on the navigation of the coast of <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> to me in half an hour , and I ’ ll tell you more. ’ <NAME> waited upon him at the time mentioned , and then learnt all that had taken place on the previous day , and all that was known of the appointment <NAME> had made with the brothers ; which was for that night ; and for the better understanding of which it will be requisite to return and follow his own footsteps from the house of the twin brothers .
__label__1	He dotes upon the children to the last and remembers the commission he has undertaken for an absent friend .
__label__0	It was needful , therefore , to descend again to the east-south-east .
__label__1	I can do it without <NAME> , of course , but this is the shortest way . ''
__label__1	‘ There are many pleasanter places even in this dreary world , than <NAME> when it blows hard ; and if you throw in beside , a gloomy winter ’ s evening , a miry and sloppy road , and a pelting fall of heavy rain , and try the effect , by way of experiment , in your own proper person , you will experience the full force of this observation .
__label__0	Once in a while they could descry a caravan resting in a “ kraal , ” awaiting the freshness and cool of the evening to resume its route .
__label__0	It is a question of time .
__label__0	It was to say the least very extraordinary , and they were compelled to believe that <NAME> was not or was no longer inhabited .
__label__1	He pulled it off and showed 'em me .
__label__1	They all had a listless and dreary air of waiting somebody 's pleasure , and the most talkative of the ladies had to speak quite rigidly to repress a yawn .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> , I understood , was also a bright particular star ; but it was his misfortune to have his glory a little dimmed by the extraordinary lustre of <NAME> .
__label__0	`` <NAME> , you could not remain in <NAME> , and your safety could only be assured by bringing you to such a distance that your persecutors could not take you . ''
__label__0	By the way , I must buy some shoes and shirts .
__label__1	We all drew nearer to the cages , feigning to examine the birds .
__label__1	If the matter had only been properly taken up at first , as I wished it to be !
__label__1	But <NAME> , waking , told in a hurry how they came to be together , and all the why and wherefore of that matter .
__label__1	‘ Come , dear boy ! ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	`` Ah , <NAME> , '' shouted the old sailor , `` that 's a real miracle !
__label__0	Mary and <NAME> were the captain ’ s only children .
__label__1	He was the meekest of his sex , the mildest of little men .
__label__0	he cried , as soon as he had recovered the use of his speech , `` after we had once passed <NAME> , the needle of this compass pointed to the southward instead of the northward . ''
__label__1	' I want a boy , and he mus n't be a big 'un .
__label__1	What power could I have over them , but that they were bound in the bonds of their sin , and delivered to me ! ’ More than forty years had passed over the grey head of this determined woman , since the time she recalled .
__label__0	This young man , about nine and twenty years of age , almost a giant in stature , but well proportioned , surprised Freycinet by the extent of his information .
__label__0	Before long half the sky was overspread .
__label__0	At last , on the 26th July , a messenger arrived from the King of <NAME> to inquire into the strange conduct of the <NAME> of <NAME> , and the cause of his detention of the white men .
__label__1	she ’ ll make a sweet miniature. ’ As <NAME> spoke , she held up an ivory countenance intersected with very perceptible sky-blue veins , and regarded it with so much complacency , that <NAME> quite envied her .
__label__0	Besides , as we approach the centre , I expect to find it luminous -- '' `` Nothing is impossible . ''
__label__0	This return to light , if not to heat , rejoiced them all .
__label__1	Shall I tell you more ?
__label__0	The harbor was free from the ice which is generally forced there by the east-wind ; the sharp peaks , covered with snow , looked like a number of white waves .
__label__1	Thus encumbered the old gentleman lifted his legs awkwardly once or twice , as if they were very clumsy and imperfect pieces of machinery , and then looking down on his own side of the wall , burst into a loud laugh .
__label__1	And thus it came to pass , that <NAME> declared , in the parlour after supper , to wit , and twenty minutes before eleven o ’ clock p.m. , that he had never been so happy in all his days .
__label__0	My uncle thanked him warmly , in the <NAME> language , for his kind hospitality , speaking truly from the heart .
__label__1	Soon as I come out of the Mill to-night , I hastened to hear what was said of Stephen—for I know wi ’ pride he will come back to shame it ! —and then I went again to seek <NAME> , and I found him , and I told him every word I knew ; and he believed no word I said , and brought me here. ’ ‘ So far , that ’ s true enough , ’ assented <NAME> , with his hands in his pockets and his hat on .
__label__0	<NAME> as he was , he did not stop to see as he wrote if the assemblage of letters made intelligible words .
__label__1	<NAME> to the bottom of the river rather than the surface , by reason of the slime and ooze with which it was covered , and its sodden state , this boat and the two figures in it obviously were doing something that they often did , and were seeking what they often sought .
__label__1	‘ Here ’ s <NAME> , dear Mrs Quilp , ’ said her husband .
__label__0	The little island proved to be nothing more than an arid rock rising abruptly about forty feet above the water .
__label__0	`` And when does the next train pass here ? ''
__label__1	But that is not the subject on which I wish to speak with you. ’ ‘ Oh ! ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	The mystery was about to be unveiled .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and the <NAME> nobles have appeared , somewhat prematurely , perhaps , upon the scene .
__label__0	<NAME> was about to invade the sanctity of the “ oudoupa , ” when he reeled backward .
__label__0	Little <NAME> flung himself on his neck in such tumultuous delight that he nearly threw the worthy secretary down , and made him say , “ <NAME> _petit bonhomme_ .
__label__1	Put her in a room in <NAME> here with any six people old enough to be her parents , and her parents may be there for anything she knows .
__label__1	‘ Oh ! ’ thought <NAME> , ‘ that this slender chance might not be lost , and that I might prevail , if it were but for one week ’ s time and reconsideration ! ’ ‘ You are charged with some commission to me , sir , ’ said <NAME> , presenting herself in great agitation .
__label__1	These various signs and tokens , marked by the little woman , are not lost upon her .
__label__1	`` Will you run over , once again , what the boy said ? ''
__label__1	If he had retorted or openly exasperated me , it would have been a relief and a justification ; but he had put me on a slow fire , on which I lay tormented half the night .
__label__1	And I can always like you now , and your sister will not tease or trifle with you .
__label__1	`` You are very obliging , <NAME> .
__label__1	As fast asleep as she is now , I hope ! ''
__label__1	‘ Have a chop ! ’ ‘ Not for the world , my good sir ! ’ cried <NAME> , stopping him on his way to the bell ; ‘ appetite and myself , <NAME> , have long been strangers. ’ <NAME> was so well pleased with his new name , and appeared to think it so obliging in <NAME> to confer it upon him , that he shook hands with him again , and laughed rather childishly .
__label__1	Still very pale , she is dressed in slight mourning and wears two beautiful bracelets .
__label__1	Let him do it , if it must be done , when I am not here to see it .
__label__0	“ It ’ s quite clear to me , from the way in which they made off , that they are unacquainted with fire-arms .
__label__0	The ridge , however , had been violently ruptured , and now rose perpendicularly from the water .
__label__0	said the <NAME> , shuddering at the idea .
__label__0	Its houses are empty , containing not so much as a mat .
__label__0	At this point the excavation exhibited a depth of six and a half feet and the work of the masonry was begun .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> sat opposite the tipstaff ; and the tipstaff sat with his hat between his knees , whistling a tune , and looking out of the coach window .
__label__0	Besides other things the nets brought up , were several flabellariae and graceful polypi , that are peculiar to that part of the ocean .
__label__1	Therefore I hinted to Peggotty that she would find <NAME> much recovered from the shock of <NAME> ’ s decease ; and indeed he came in like a bridegroom .
__label__1	There was some company in the room , and <NAME> said to me as she joined it , “ You are to go and stand there boy , till you are wanted. ” “ There ” , being the window , I crossed to it , and stood “ there , ” in a very uncomfortable state of mind , looking out .
__label__0	The engineer and <NAME> , each armed with a double-barrelled gun , and <NAME> carrying his rifle , had nothing to do but start .
__label__1	Never let us be parted any more , <NAME> .
__label__1	With these concluding words , <NAME> gives a shake to each of the hands he holds , and relinquishing them , backs a pace or two in a broad-chested , upright attitude , as if he had made a final confession and were immediately going to be shot with all military honours .
__label__1	I am always afraid of inconveniencing busy men , being an idle man. ’ ‘ I should not have thought so , from your appearance. ’ ‘ No ?
__label__1	They let you off easily enough , ” sneered <NAME> .
__label__0	Should he perceive <NAME> , we could not prevent a collision which might have terrible results .
__label__1	`` And now , '' proceeds the lawyer , still without minding her , `` you had better go .
__label__0	The following days brought new discoveries .
__label__0	“ Confound that excellent woman , ” he said ; “ if she hadn ’ t called me to the telephone I should not have run the chance of being struck by lightning. ” And to insure being left in quiet , he judiciously put the telephone out of action .
__label__0	The <NAME> steamer was announced to leave that very evening , and it became necessary to find <NAME> , if possible , without delay .
__label__0	When an incident is described that is already past , photographs of its main features are transmitted with the narrative .
__label__1	Once out of it , there ’ s no knowing when we may come back to it .
__label__1	`` Will somebody give me a quart pot ? ''
__label__0	The terrible fall had begun .
__label__1	<NAME> brother to <NAME> ? ” “ Who 's he ? ” said <NAME> .
__label__1	I ca n't go into a long explanation before company ; but I could n't help it , upon my honour . '
__label__1	I turned directly , came back , and looked again .
__label__1	At length , he gave the matter up , as hopeless for that night , and suddenly breaking into a run as though to force himself away , scampered off at his utmost speed , nor once ventured to look behind him lest he should be tempted back again .
__label__1	This led me to speculate whether any of them ever tumbled down , and then I fancied that I felt light falls on my face , -- a disagreeable turn of thought , suggesting other and more objectionable approaches up my back .
__label__0	The question now arose as to which it was wise to take ; and this of itself was no small difficulty .
__label__1	For some moments , I was so lost in reconsidering what I had heard and seen in <NAME> Street that I was quite unable to talk to <NAME> or even to fix my attention on what she said to me , especially when I began to inquire in my mind whether there were , or ever had been , any other gentlemen , not in the dancing profession , who lived and founded a reputation entirely on their deportment .
__label__0	What could be passing in his mind ?
__label__1	It sickened her , for blows fell heavily and cruelly on the quiet of the night .
__label__0	Setting sail from <NAME> , on March 15th , 1603 , the two chiefs of the enterprise first ascended the <NAME> , as far as the harbour of <NAME> , 240 miles from its mouth .
__label__1	I have no lover , of course .
__label__0	“ And what do you say is your surmise as to your present position ? ” he asked .
__label__0	there is some mystery in that man ’ s life , ” said <NAME> , “ and it appears as if he had only re-entered society by the path of remorse. ” “ I don ’ t know what sort of a man we have brought here , ” said the sailor .
__label__0	The current was so rapid that the boat went at the rate of four or five miles an hour .
__label__0	<NAME> was still following him .
__label__1	Betwixt you and me , ma'am , ' returned <NAME> , 'that 's the great principle ; and that 's the reason why , if you look at any cases that get into them owdacious newspapers , you 'll always observe that sick families have been relieved with slices of cheese .
__label__1	`` Is it possible , '' whispered my guardian as we put a chair for the little creature and got her to sit down with her load , the boy keeping close to her , holding to her apron , `` that this child works for the rest ?
__label__1	There have been a meeting to-night where he have been spoken of in the same shameful way .
__label__1	<NAME> Leicester generally refers back in his mind to <NAME> and arranges a sequence of events on a plan of his own .
__label__0	“ Who ’ s there ? ” asked J. T. <NAME> .
__label__1	It made me giddy and faint in a moment .
__label__0	It would be sufficient , I said , for five or six of us to reconnoitre further south for twelve or fifteen miles .
__label__1	In these matrimonial dialogues they never addressed each other , but always some invisible presence that appeared to take a station about midway between them .
__label__0	continued <NAME> , `` they 've got into a good place . ''
__label__0	According to <NAME> , who quotes this remarkable fact from an old native , Laing retained his <NAME> costume , and gave out that he had been sent by his master , the king of <NAME> , to visit <NAME> and describe the wonders it contained .
__label__0	Unfortunately , to reach them would necessitate a march of one hundred and thirty miles south ; and this was why <NAME> thought it best to go first to <NAME> , as it was not only much nearer , but also on the direct line of route .
__label__0	Notwithstanding this `` et cetera , '' I must not omit to mention fish that <NAME> will long remember , and with good reason .
__label__0	Her loquacity exhausted itself in preference on the evils of the times , and the little worries of the household .
__label__1	‘ Yes , <NAME> , it is , ’ replies <NAME> , advancing .
__label__0	In place of accepting the breakfast of the sergeant , <NAME> invited the commandant and his wife to come and have theirs on board the jangada .
__label__1	To show you how mistaken you are , and what an unfounded assumption yours is , I will lay before you a certificate of <NAME> 's burial , which I happened to have carried in my pocket-book , ” with a hurried hand he produced and opened it , “ ever since .
__label__0	Even <NAME> would have surprised him by an exhibition of such stoicism .
__label__0	The calculations of the Professor were perfectly correct .
__label__1	Perhaps you would n't mind <NAME> 's coming in , <NAME> ? ''
__label__1	You have been in every line I have ever read since I first came here , the rough common boy whose poor heart you wounded even then .
__label__1	Whether he knew what had happened , whether he recollected what they had said to him , whether he knew that he was free , were questions which no sagacity could have solved .
__label__0	`` A febrifuge , '' answered the engineer .
__label__0	On the contrary this was a uniform mass of verdure , out of which rose two or three hills of no great height .
__label__1	She has beauty still , and if it be not in its heyday , it is not yet in its autumn .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> stopped to hear no more ; but darting from the surgery into the outer shop , cried in a stentorian voice , ‘ Ben , my boy , she ’ s bolted ! ’ <NAME> , who had been slumbering behind the counter , with his head half a foot or so below his knees , no sooner heard this appalling communication , than he made a precipitate rush at <NAME> , and , twisting his hand in the neck-cloth of that taciturn servitor , expressed an obliging intention of choking him where he stood .
__label__1	And I took him down to the churchyard , and set him on a certain tombstone there , and he showed me from that elevation which stone was sacred to the memory of <NAME> , late of this <NAME> , and Also <NAME> , <NAME> of the Above .
__label__0	A false step would have been dangerous on the narrow passes sloping down to the sides of the gulfs ; but I walked with firm step , without feeling any giddiness .
__label__1	If she went to <NAME> , and told her what had passed , that very act might bring down the irreparable mischief that he threatened he had the power , and that she knew he had the will , to do .
__label__1	‘ Stay a moment , <NAME> ; stay another moment .
__label__0	It appeared there as if the mountain was vomiting flame .
__label__0	<NAME> mists passed like clouds close to the ground .
__label__1	The gradual change from land to water , on the approach to <NAME> Cuttle ’ s lodgings , was curious .
__label__0	There were also some panopyres , slightly luminous ; and lastly , some oculines , like magnificent fans , forming one of the richest vegetations of these seas .
__label__1	Penetrating to the heart of this region , he arrives by a court and a long whitewashed passage at a great brick building composed of bare walls , floors , roof-rafters , and skylights , on the front of which , if it can be said to have any front , is painted <NAME> 'S <NAME> 's Shooting Gallery , & c. , he goes ; and in it there are gaslights ( partly turned off now ) , and two whitened targets for rifle-shooting , and archery accommodation , and fencing appliances , and all necessaries for the <NAME> art of boxing .
__label__0	The waves rebounded in dazzling foam , the beach entirely disapppearing under the raging flood , and the cliff appearing to emerge from the sea itself , the spray rising to a height of more than a hundred feet .
__label__0	I think that the ‘ Bonadventure ’ will be safe there. ” “ Perfectly , ” replied <NAME> , “ and besides , the north coast is merely sand , very uninteresting to look at. ” “ I shall not be sorry , ” resumed the engineer , “ to pass not only to-night but to-morrow in that bay , which is worth being carefully explored. ” “ I think that we shall be obliged to do so , whether we like it or not , ” answered <NAME> , “ for the sky looks very threatening towards the west .
__label__0	They offered the viands to her in their fingers ; and she had only to take the trouble to open her mouth .
__label__1	He stood , half turned from the prisoner , lounging with his elbow against the bar .
__label__0	Proved as it was by the incident of the bullet , it was hereafter an unquestionable fact , and such a discovery could not but cause great uneasiness among the colonists .
__label__0	They had just met for the first time at this fete in the <NAME> , of which they had been ordered to give an account in their papers .
__label__1	It ’ s him ! ’ ‘ What does this good woman mean ? ’ cried Mr Blandois , turning white , hot , and slowly rising with a look of such deadly wrath that it contrasted surprisingly with the slight force of his words .
__label__0	`` Captain , '' said <NAME> , following him , `` from there we ought to see the stores . ''
__label__0	Nevertheless , I think that we should return to <NAME> by the south coast. ” “ But , ” observed <NAME> , “ from <NAME> to <NAME> there must be at least another ten miles .
__label__0	The <NAME> boat had arrived one moment before ours , and its crew were already clambering up the steep sides of the rock , flinging down the penguins as they went , the birds showing no small surprise at being thus summarily dispossessed of the island , of which they had been hitherto the only inhabitants .
__label__1	<NAME> was the first , and walked by himself smoking .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , <NAME> ; it ’ s near <NAME> ’ s , and handy for me , you know .
__label__0	In that case , the velocity would have decreased by degrees , but the Projectile itself would not have suddenly stopped . ''
__label__1	At the top of the table , seated in an arm-chair rather higher than the rest , was a particularly fat gentleman with a very round , red face .
__label__0	Strangers were not allowed to inspect two other magazines in which were stored powder and other war-materials , strong liquors , iron , & c. All these places were for the present abandoned by the new sovereign , who held his court at <NAME> .
__label__0	The travellers continued their journey southwards , rounding <NAME> , which they had first touched at its most northerly point .
__label__0	He is well known in all the <NAME> .
__label__0	He uttered this word so sharply that each one obeyed , and the sledge resumed its monotonous progress .
__label__0	Say rather breakfast-time , for we certainly have begun another day . ''
__label__1	<NAME> raised the hand that it might clasp her neck and join its fellow there .
__label__1	Unless it was taken by somebody in jest -- only in jest , dear grandfather , which would make me laugh heartily if I could but know it -- ’ ‘ Who would take money in jest ? ’ returned the old man in a hurried manner .
__label__0	“ The attempt has often been made , gentlemen , ” said the doctor , “ to rise and descend at will , without losing ballast or gas from the balloon .
__label__0	<NAME> had accepted and promised expressly to be there .
__label__1	He was apparently about to proceed to do so , when <NAME> , who had been eyeing him with great curiosity , said with considerable scorn , ‘ Haven ’ t I seen you at the theatre , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Certainly , ’ replied the unabashed stranger .
__label__1	A long room with three long rows of desks , and six of forms , and bristling all round with pegs for hats and slates .
__label__1	`` <NAME> , '' said <NAME> then , raising her blue eyes tenderly to his face , `` after what our cousin <NAME> has said , I think no choice is left us .
__label__0	Now I have a chance offered me to complete , or , rather , to make over my knowledge of medicine , surgery , history , geography , botany , mineralogy , conchology , geodesy , chemistry , physics , mechanics , hydrography ; well , I accept it , and I assure you , I did n't have to be asked twice . ''
__label__0	For a moment neither of us spoke .
__label__1	But the governing powers of the <NAME> ’ Company were always ready for them , by picking out a few boys who had turned out well in spite of the system , and roundly asserting that they could have only turned out well because of it .
__label__0	Flashes of lightning rivaled in intensity the volcano ’ s eruption .
__label__0	The château of <NAME> stands in the gorge of the 'Dents-du-Midi ' twenty hours from <NAME> .
__label__1	The girl gradually recovered her senses ; and , staggering to a chair by the bedside , hid her face upon the pillow : leaving <NAME> to confront the new comers , in some astonishment at their unlooked-for appearance .
__label__0	The stores of the <NAME> contained some excellent wine , some of which was broached to do honor to the occasion .
__label__0	Will <NAME> took in the lower reef of his topsails .
__label__1	Her absence in his altered fortunes made it , and him in it , so very desolate and so much in need of such a face of love and truth , that he turned against the wall to weep , sobbing out , as his heart relieved itself , ‘ O my Little Dorrit ! ’ The day was sunny , and the <NAME> , with the hot noon striking upon it , was unwontedly quiet .
__label__0	`` It is an infamous shame , '' cried <NAME> , who broke out for the twentieth time .
__label__1	'For , ' says he , 'it 's being ground to bits in a slow mill ; it 's being roasted at a slow fire ; it 's being stung to death by single bees ; it 's being drowned by drops ; it 's going mad by grains . '
__label__0	`` And we 're still going up ! ''
__label__1	“ It was neither a very true nor a very polite thing to say , ” she remarked , directing her eyes to the ships again .
__label__1	Her grandfather was basking in the sun outside , breathing the perfume of the flowers , and idly watching the clouds as they floated on before the light summer wind .
__label__0	The pilot was silent for a few moments ; they felt that he was reflecting before he spoke .
__label__1	To add to his defeat , <NAME> , considering any such efforts an invasion of his peculiar privilege , eyed the offender steadily , through his glass , as if astonished at his presumption , and audibly stated his impression that it was an ‘ infernal liberty , ’ which being a hint to <NAME> , he put up HIS glass , and surveyed the object of censure as if he were some extraordinary wild animal then exhibiting for the first time .
__label__0	It was the men of commerce who were the leaders in this movement , and who first undertook to cross the <NAME> .
__label__1	“ After not setting eyes upon you or hearing of you for so long a time , do I find you here ! ” “ Do n't call me <NAME> .
__label__1	We also parted with more of our freight at different times , so that when we came to change horses , I was again alone outside .
__label__0	I looked at all points of the horizon .
__label__0	<NAME> figures , tattooed on the wood , set forth the rank and achievements of the deceased .
__label__1	The abode of Mrs <NAME> was not easy to find , lying in such complicated back settlements of muddy Brentford that they left their equipage at the sign of the <NAME> , and went in search of it on foot .
__label__1	interposed the nurse , hastily depositing in her pocket a green glass bottle , the contents of which she had been tasting in a corner with evident satisfaction .
__label__0	They live all together , men and women and children , in one hut , in the centre of which a fire is lighted .
__label__1	It shall be made to pay ; don ’ t you be afraid .
__label__0	They were the dead of the <NAME> villages , carried by the <NAME> to the level of the sea , and which the vultures , the only undertakers of the country , had not been able to devour .
__label__1	<NAME> and I going to church , therefore , must have been a moving spectacle for compassionate minds .
__label__1	‘ I asked one of your references , and he said you were pious. ’ ‘ Well , sir , I hope I am a little in that line , ’ replied <NAME> .
__label__1	'It 's all bought up as fast as it can be made , ' said the fellow .
__label__1	All his proceedings were the result of the nicest and coldest calculation ; and it was not without cause that Mrs. Sparsit habitually observed of him , that he was a young man of the steadiest principle she had ever known .
__label__0	It was <NAME> , and <NAME> brought me here , to my master ! ” <NAME> ended his account by saying what had been his grief at finding the inanimate body , in which he vainly sought for the least sign of life .
__label__1	There is terror in the carriage , there is weeping , there is the heavy breathing of the insensible traveller .
__label__1	<NAME> had also been appointed Secretary , and had been enjoined to give instant notice of resignation to <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , for ever and ever .
__label__1	The attention of the company was then directed , by a natural transition , to the little girl who had had the audacity to burn her hair off , and who , after receiving sundry small slaps and pushes from the more energetic of the ladies , was mercifully sent home : the ninepence , with which she was to have been rewarded , being escheated to the <NAME> family .
__label__1	He patiently awaits an explicit answer ; and <NAME> , more baffled by his patience than by anything else , at last desperately whispers a name in his ear .
__label__1	We shall meet at dinner-time .
__label__0	Imagine the waters of the lake aroused by a hurricane , then suddenly solidified by an intense frost , and some conception may be formed of the aspect of the lake three hours after the irruption of this irresistible torrent of lava .
__label__1	`` A tremendous family to provide for ! ''
__label__1	When you lose , you ’ re martyrs ; but I don ’ t find that when you win , you look upon the other losers in that light .
__label__0	My first sensation was perhaps a natural one .
__label__1	That purpose , providently to detach herself in the beginning from all the clankings of their chain that were to come , and to shelter herself with the fiction of her innocent belief in their mutual affection , and their adaptation to each other .
__label__0	They could not be mistaken in the nature of the irradiation thrown from the glowing nucleus , whose clear rays were shattered by all the angles , all the projections of the cavern .
__label__1	What a sweet singer you was when you first come !
__label__1	‘ I beg your pardon , sir , ’ says I , ‘ if you please , I ’ m looking for the dog. ’ ‘ Dog ? ’ he says .
__label__0	But let us hasten to add that Quiquendone has neither industry nor commerce , and that it does very well without them .
__label__0	“ Yes , <NAME> , and the waters of the Forth are as rough as the sea. ” “ Well , <NAME> , here it never rains .
__label__0	He had before him a man convicted of the most heinous of crimes , and the man never flinched .
__label__1	The old gentleman thought that two handsomer or finer young fellows could scarcely stand side by side than those on whom he looked with so much pleasure .
__label__0	But <NAME> , too , was gone ; and when , upon the 14th , the sounding-line was dropped upon its site , it was only with the same result so oftentimes obtained before .
__label__0	Therefore the chapter that he devotes to <NAME> , recording the marvellous and rapid advance of this effort at colonization , excited a lively interest in <NAME> , where the development and growing prosperity of <NAME> were very imperfectly known .
__label__0	How many of them remain ? ” “ The document , ” said <NAME> , “ only spoke of one castaway. ” “ Well , if he is still on the island , ” replied <NAME> , “ it is impossible but that we shall find him. ” The exploration was continued .
__label__0	“ My conscience , ” exclaimed <NAME> , “ I must say I am surprised at such a declaration from the Secretary of a Geographical Society ! ” “ And why so ? ” said <NAME> , touched in his weak point .
__label__1	Mrs Blimber was a little alarmed by this -- comparatively speaking -- profligate behaviour ; and especially by the alteration in the character of the music , which , beginning to comprehend low melodies that were popular in the streets , might not unnaturally be supposed to give offence to <NAME> .
__label__0	He therefore determined to seek , with no further delay , the land recently discovered by the <NAME> .
__label__0	Still , in the end limes , bitter oranges , cocoa-nuts , bread-fruits , guavas , and others were found .
__label__1	What shall we do ? ’ Do ! ’ said the stout old host , who regarded only the last words of the sentence .
__label__1	The mild <NAME> could not possibly bear malice at such a time , if at any time .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , ’ said he , using that familiar address for the first time in their communication , ‘ do you remember my telling you , as we walked up and down one hot morning , looking over the harbour at <NAME> , that <NAME> ’ s baby sister who was dead seemed to <NAME> and me to have grown as she had grown , and changed as she had changed ? ’ ‘ Very well. ’ ‘ You remember my saying that our thoughts had never been able to separate those twin sisters , and that , in our fancy , whatever <NAME> was , the other was ? ’ ‘ Yes , very well. ’ ‘ Arthur , ’ said Mr Meagles , much subdued , ‘ I carry that fancy further to-night .
__label__1	This observation must be limited exclusively to his daughter .
__label__1	“ Where have you been , you young monkey ? ” said Mrs. <NAME> , stamping her foot .
__label__0	Some were wrestling , others on horseback mixed with the pedestrians .
__label__0	After dressing the unfortunate man 's wounds , I readjusted the bandages on his head , and turned to <NAME> .
__label__0	After some time , <NAME> stopped us .
__label__0	Towards evening a violent tempest raged about the snowy summit ; it was impossible to withstand the force of the hurricane ; they had to lie down on the ground , but so low was the temperature that they ran a risk of being frozen to death at once .
__label__1	‘ You see and hear this foolish creature .
__label__1	They may have been realised , or they may not have been realised -- ’ ‘ Let us say , then , may not have been realised , ’ observed Mr Meagles .
__label__0	“ This is what <NAME> feared , ” murmured <NAME> , changing countenance .
__label__1	Give him time to get rid of it , you know .
__label__1	He only requires to be understood .
__label__0	Rescued , at all events , from the exposure to a perilous temperature of 60 degrees below zero , the community was installed in its new home .
__label__0	Then , when his glance fell from the wonders of the air to the calm surface of the ocean , he saw no less astonishing productions of the animal kingdom , among others , medusæ thirty feet broad ; they served as food for the other fish , and they floated like islands amid the sea-weed .
__label__1	<NAME> ’ t agitate yourself , Louisa. ’ ‘ It ’ s very foolish of me , ’ said <NAME> , sitting down , and taking out her pocket-handkerchief , ‘ but he ’ s -- he ’ s such a perfect Dombey ! ’ Mr <NAME> coughed .
__label__1	It is something so new to Pleasant to see her father an object of sympathy and interest , to find any one very willing to tolerate his society in this world , not to say pressingly and soothingly entreating him to belong to it , that it gives her a sensation she never experienced before .
__label__1	‘ I left off as I began -- of my own fancy. ’ The exquisite indifference of her manner in saying this : an indifference quite removed from dulness or insensibility , for it was pointed with proud purpose : was well set off by the carelessness with which she drew her hand across the strings , and came from that part of the room .
__label__0	This noise was most decidedly of barking .
__label__0	The engineer and his two companions threw themselves between the sea and the seals .
__label__1	I wished that <NAME> had not met me , or that I had not yielded to him and gone with him , so that , of all days in the year on this day , I might not have had <NAME> in my breath and on my clothes .
__label__0	“ Oh , by all means ! -- Five years later , it was Major Laing ’ s destiny to force his way across the desert of <NAME> , penetrate to <NAME> , and perish a few miles above it , by strangling , at the hands of the Ouelad-shiman , who wanted to compel him to turn Mussulman. ” “ Still another victim ! ” said the sportsman .
__label__1	B-u-u-ust me ! ” said <NAME> , who all this time had been putting on his clothes , “ if I ai n't , what with piety and one blowed thing and another , been choused this last week into as bad luck as ever a poor devil of a honest tradesman met with !
__label__0	He calculated that they were still five or six miles from the coast , and this distance was too great for them to attempt traversing during the night in the midst of unknown woods .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> paid , the door was unbolted , and out they came ; the uncombed gentleman bestowing a friendly nod upon <NAME> , who happened to be passing at the moment .
__label__1	Ten o'clock at night ? ” “ Yes , sir .
__label__0	With the assurance that they would not fail to keep their appointment with military punctuality , the two officers cordially wrung their friend ’ s hand and retired to the <NAME> for a game at piquet .
__label__1	He stopped short at the door on seeing a stranger , twirled in his hand a perfectly round old hat without any vestige of a brim , and resting himself now on one leg and now on the other and changing them constantly , stood in the doorway , looking into the parlour with the most extraordinary leer I ever beheld .
__label__1	`` Are there any more of you besides <NAME> ? ''
__label__1	How the time wears , I know not ; until I am recalled by my child-wife ’ s old companion .
__label__0	Fortunately , <NAME> discovered a bustard ’ s nest with a dozen of large eggs in it , which <NAME> cooked on hot cinders .
__label__0	They appeared neither vexed nor alarmed when we shot birds .
__label__1	There was no sleep for <NAME> on that night when <NAME> turned so easily in his bed ; there was no sleep for little Miss Peecher .
__label__1	In this last respect , servants are the devil .
__label__1	I tell you that the time was , when I loved him better than you ever did ! ’ She stood with her bright angry eyes confronting the wide stare , and the set face ; and softened no more , when the moaning was repeated , than if the face had been a picture .
__label__1	The name of Mr Tite <NAME> has been mentioned to me as representing some highly influential interest among his creditors .
__label__0	It remained to select the men who should compose the party .
__label__1	`` And you know -- and I know -- that you have not sent her away for the reasons you have assigned , but for the purpose of separating her as much as possible from -- excuse my mentioning it as a matter of business -- any reproach and exposure that impend over yourself . ''
__label__0	It was the only portion of the globe which had escaped the indefatigable activity of <NAME> ; and perhaps we owe the small advantage of having first landed there to the sad event which ended his days .
__label__0	THE <NAME> had not so suddenly left the ball-room of the <NAME> , when the fete he was giving to the civil and military authorities and principal people of <NAME> was at the height of its brilliancy , without ample cause ; for he had just received information that serious events were taking place beyond the frontiers of the <NAME> .
__label__1	A white figure advancing along this path , proved to be nothing more ghostly than Mr Boffin , easily attired for the pursuit of knowledge , in an undress garment of short white smock-frock .
__label__1	I can do more good with it , perhaps , than you can. ’ ‘ Just the wery thing , to be sure , ’ said <NAME> , brightening up ; ‘ o ’ course you can , sir. ’ ‘ Say no more about it , ’ said <NAME> , locking the pocket-book in his desk ; ‘ I am heartily obliged to you , my good friend .
__label__0	The hunters who wandered far from the camp were massacred by the <NAME> , and sickness found an easy prey in men overwhelmed with ennui , disappointment , and misery .
__label__1	Over ! ’ And the <NAME> , hooking off his glazed hat , pulled his handkerchief out of the crown , wiped his grizzled head despairingly , and tossed the handkerchief in again , with the indifference of deep dejection .
__label__0	The ice masses had just `` weighed anchor , '' as the sailors say .
__label__1	Do you see ? ’ ‘ I understand , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ This evil , if evil it be , has been of my own seeking .
__label__1	' I can , ' said <NAME> , almost aloud .
__label__1	‘ You may see him now , ’ said she , ‘ if you ’ ll condescend to take a peep. ’ With these mysterious words , she preceded the visitor into a little parlour behind the shop , with a little window in it commanding a very little dull back-yard .
__label__1	‘ He is very , very ill , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	Having given this pledge , which was rather a bold one , and not particularly easy of redemption , <NAME> lost no time in sallying forth , and taking measures for its immediate fulfilment .
__label__1	The uncle , a rigid old gentleman of strong force of character ; the nephew , habitually timid , repressed , and under constraint. ’ Mistress Affery , fixedly attentive in the window-seat , biting the rolled up end of her apron , and trembling from head to foot , here cried out , ‘ Jeremiah , keep off from me !
__label__0	`` Besides , '' continued the doctor , `` if the captain is on board he will know better than we what is to be done , and so much the better because we are perfectly ignorant ; for his singularly brief letter gives us no clew to the probable aim of the voyage . ''
__label__1	These , with their perplexities and inconsistencies , were the shifting quicksands of my mind , from the time of my departure to the time of my return home , three years afterwards .
__label__1	A day passed away and his mother was not there ; another flew by , and she came not near him ; a third evening arrived , and yet he had not seen her -- , and in four-and-twenty hours he was to be separated from her , perhaps for ever .
__label__0	The doors , which are in the centre , are so low that they can only be entered on the knees .
__label__1	Of their appearance I shall have something to say , presently .
__label__0	`` Well , I suppose not , except it may be a certain amount of pain in the ears , '' was my rather grim reply .
__label__1	‘ You never mean it ! ’ ‘ Mean what , <NAME> dear ? ’ ‘ Well !
__label__1	Even when , slightly thawing under the influence of sparkling champagne , she related to her son-in-law some passages of domestic interest concerning her papa , she infused into the narrative such <NAME> suggestions of her having been an unappreciated blessing to mankind , since her papa ’ s days , and also of that gentleman ’ s having been a frosty impersonation of a frosty race , as struck cold to the very soles of the feet of the hearers .
__label__0	<NAME> is surrounded by reefs , through which , not without danger , the <NAME> found a passage , casting anchor in the same place as <NAME> had done , namely in <NAME> Bay .
__label__0	<NAME> 's reply to this taunt was a desperate facer , which , however , <NAME> managed to stop while on its way towards the <NAME> 's nose .
__label__1	I depreciated <NAME> ; I depreciated <NAME> .
__label__1	As he bent forward , to be nearer , with the utmost show of delicacy and respect , and with his teeth persuasively arrayed , in a self-depreciating smile , she felt as if she could have struck him dead .
__label__0	`` Or , '' continued <NAME> , `` its speed will be sufficient , and it will continue its elliptical course , to gravitate forever around the orb of night . ''
__label__1	`` You do n't mind these things ; neither does <NAME> .
__label__0	How , then , could we decide whether we had reached the pole ?
__label__1	His temper gave abundant promise of being imperious in after-life ; and he had as hopeful an apprehension of his own importance , and the rightful subservience of all other things and persons to it , as heart could desire .
__label__0	[ 2 ] The declination is the variation of the needle from the true meridian of a place .
__label__0	The drops of water , dried by evaporation , no longer sparkled on the walls .
__label__1	Wheresoever the strong tide met with an impediment , his gaze paused for an instant .
__label__0	A second time they had been sent on the wrong track by an erroneous interpretation of the document .
__label__0	The same reception awaited the Spaniards at the <NAME> , at <NAME> , and at <NAME> , upon which ginger was found for the first time .
__label__1	I say to them , What else are you made for ?
__label__1	I am almost sure he will grant it now , if I ask him .
__label__1	‘ After this , the beads were all unheeded ; the playthings which were offered to her were utterly disregarded ; her playmates , for whom but a moment before she gladly left the stranger , now vainly strove to pull her from her mother ; and though she yielded her usual instantaneous obedience to my signal to follow me , it was evidently with painful reluctance .
__label__0	Harding instructed his companions in many things , principally explaining to them the practical applications of science .
__label__1	Gently <NAME> , gently. ’ ‘ Strange sitivation for one o ’ the family , ’ observed <NAME> , hoisting the aunt into a chair .
__label__1	And so all my endeavours to cancel the past and to raise myself in the world , and to raise you with me , are to be beaten down by <NAME> low whims ; are they ? ’ ‘ I will not reproach you , Charley. ’ ‘ Hear her ! ’ exclaimed the boy , looking round at the darkness .
__label__1	Even the coming sun made but a pale waste in the sky , like a sad sea .
__label__1	I was afraid of staying then to speak to either woman , lest I should bring her into trouble .
__label__1	The fright and abhorrence that <NAME> smoothed out of her strong face as she ended this diversion , showed how seriously she had meant it .
__label__1	And slily he traileth along the ground , And his leaves he gently waves , As he joyously hugs and crawleth round The rich mould of dead men ’ s graves .
__label__0	The bank was very equal ; there was no fear that the raft would run aground , and before two o ’ clock they arrived at the river ’ s mouth , a few paces from the <NAME> .
__label__0	To satisfy his companions , <NAME> began to uncover the window at the bottom of the projectile , which would allow them to observe the earth direct .
__label__1	He had been overthrown into gutters ; bespattered with mud ; violently flattened against posts .
__label__1	‘ An addition to our little <NAME> , <NAME> , ’ said the <NAME> ; ‘ Mr <NAME> ’ s son. ’ Young <NAME> blushed again ; and finding , from a solemn silence which prevailed , that he was expected to say something , said to <NAME> , ‘ How are you ? ’ in a voice so deep , and a manner so sheepish , that if a lamb had roared it couldn ’ t have been more surprising .
__label__1	My Lady walks upon the other side .
__label__1	But this latter <NAME> object ( in short sleeves ) always appeared to be the great inoffensive aim of her existence .
__label__0	Then suddenly a faint rim of the solar orb reveals itself on the edge of the opposite sky .
__label__1	<NAME> , seated at an open window with her arm upon its cushioned ledge and looking out at the evening shadows falling on the park , has seemed to attend since the lawyer 's name was mentioned .
__label__1	<NAME> ’ t you injured me enough already ? ’ ‘ I have never injured you , <NAME> , wilfully. ’ ‘ You are my brother , ’ said the Manager .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> makes a hurried remark to the effect that they may be doing the deceased a service , that he hopes so .
__label__0	By these two means they would be enabled to restore to the vitiated air its life- supporting properties .
__label__0	<NAME> was agreeably surprised to see a large number of islands and islets , the bays , & c. , of which were sure to afford excellent anchorage during the monsoons .
__label__0	No one was in sight .
__label__1	‘ Now , boy ! ’ said Mr Carker , putting his hand on young <NAME> ’ s shoulder , and bringing him out into the middle of the room .
__label__1	<NAME> , love , I am telling <NAME> that he never saw you abroad. ’ ‘ No such luck , sir , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	How are you now , my dear ?
__label__0	No news of the fleet having reached the army for twenty-one weeks , they had given up all hope of seeing it again , and great was <NAME> 's joy when <NAME> appeared before him , though the hardships he had endured had altered him almost beyond recognition .
__label__1	It had long been customary , as she never changed her room , for those who had anything to say to her apart , to wheel her to her desk ; where she sat , usually with the back of her chair turned towards the rest of the room , and the person who talked with her seated in a corner , on a stool which was always set in that place for that purpose .
__label__1	‘ The only name I could possibly care to know , to-night. ’ ‘ Sissy Jupe. ’ ‘ Pardon my curiosity at parting .
__label__1	`` You could n't name an individual human being -- except myself -- that my little woman is more set and determined against than Jo , '' says <NAME> .
__label__0	As early as 1816 Major Peddie , starting from <NAME> , reached <NAME> , on the <NAME> , succumbing , however , to the fatigue of the journey and unhealthiness of the climate soon after his arrival in that town .
__label__0	At first , work on the outside occupied the crew ; the sails were kept furled on the yards instead of being placed at the bottom of the hold , as the earlier explorers did ; they were merely bound up in a case , and soon the frost covered them with a dense envelope ; the topmasts were not unshipped , and the crow's-nest remained in its place .
__label__0	They , no doubt , would wish to see the unfortunate man again .
__label__0	And indeed , the next day the extremity of the peninsula was reached , and the whole length of the forest had been traversed ; but there was nothing to indicate the retreat in which the convicts had taken refuge , nor that , no less secret , which sheltered the mysterious unknown .
__label__1	What <NAME> ’ s father was to me , she made him .
__label__0	He had scarcely touched land , when the natives assembled in a crowd upon the strand , prostrated themselves at his feet , and welcomed him with signs of the most profound respect .
__label__0	That very night , at 12 o'clock , within nineteen hours at furthest , at the very moment of <NAME> , they were to reach her resplendent surface .
__label__1	The board being now clear of the more substantial articles of food , and punch , wine , and spirits being placed upon it and handed about , the guests , who had been previously conversing in little groups of three or four , gradually fell off into a dead silence , while the majority of those present glanced from time to time at <NAME> , and the bolder spirits did not even hesitate to strike the table with their knuckles , and plainly intimate their expectations , by uttering such encouragements as ‘ Now , <NAME> , ’ ‘ Wake up , <NAME> , ’ ‘ All charged , sir , and waiting for a toast , ’ and so forth .
__label__0	Kai-Koumou was the only one of all the chiefs that obeyed the call of <NAME> , who had returned to the lake district , and he was the first to announce to his tribe the defeat of the national insurrection , beaten on the plains of the lower <NAME> .
__label__1	`` And not only here , but you will go to <NAME> 's too , perhaps ?
__label__1	It was a by-street , and there was nobody about , or in the few wretched shops they passed .
__label__0	<NAME> defended him with great warmth and with all his powers , but he could not succeed in saving him .
__label__0	These words stirred up his comrades .
__label__1	In short , she had such a natural , captivating , winning manner that in a few minutes we were sitting in the window-seat , with the light of the fire upon us , talking together as free and happy as could be .
__label__0	“ <NAME> , ” said his master , as he appeared in answer to his summons , “ we are going to have a turn before breakfast .
__label__0	At this point indicated on the planisphere one of these currents was rolling , the Kuro-Scivo of the <NAME> , the <NAME> , which , leaving the Gulf of <NAME> , where it is warmed by the perpendicular rays of a tropical sun , crosses the Straits of <NAME> along the coast of <NAME> , turns into the <NAME> to the <NAME> , carrying with it trunks of camphor-trees and other indigenous productions , and edging the waves of the ocean with the pure indigo of its warm water .
__label__1	<NAME> broke with him when I was by , and he was very angry at it .
__label__0	At half-past twelve the train stopped at <NAME> where <NAME> was able to purchase some <NAME> slippers , ornamented with false pearls , in which , with evident vanity , he proceeded to encase his feet .
__label__1	In Mr Plornish ’ s judgment you would be the worse for it .
__label__0	<NAME> left the mountains inhabited by the Circassians to the south , and after a wearisome journey of two months arrived at the camp of <NAME> <NAME> on the banks of the <NAME> .
__label__0	“ Do you not hear some noise behind us ?
__label__1	I should dearly like to know , of course ; ’ ( which her anxious face confirmed ; ) ‘ but I wait until you can tell me of your own free will .
__label__1	There were some people slinking about as usual when we passed out into the street , who were evidently anxious to speak with him ; but there was something so conclusive in the halo of scented soap which encircled his presence , that they gave it up for that day .
__label__0	In 1857 he worked up farther to the northward , and invested the fortification of <NAME> , built by the <NAME> on the bank of the river .
__label__1	Every feeling of sympathy for her forlorn condition , and of admiration for her heroism and fortitude , aggravated the indignation which shook him in every limb , and swelled his heart almost to bursting .
__label__1	A happy party they were , that night .
__label__0	The courageous <NAME> tried to rise , but could not stand .
__label__0	exclaimed <NAME> ; `` a remarkably simple way for putting an end to the world ! ''
__label__0	The light of our <NAME> 's coil , increased tenfold by the myriad of prismatic masses of rock , sent its jets of fire in every direction , and I could fancy myself traveling through a huge hollow diamond , the rays of which produced myriads of extraordinary effects .
__label__1	‘ My life ! ’ said <NAME> , taking her in his arms .
__label__1	<NAME> and he had so much to do with one another in all things else , that it is hard to imagine his complaint , if he had one , being solely his own affair .
__label__1	It was a more difficult task to take leave of the inmates of <NAME> , from whom they had received so much hospitality and kindness .
__label__1	If I had been her secretary , steward , half-brother , poor relation , -- if I had been a younger brother of her appointed husband , -- I could not have seemed to myself further from my hopes when I was nearest to her .
__label__1	‘ I did this for years ; long , long years they were .
__label__0	A glass cover , six inches thick and strengthened with upper fastenings , closed it tightly .
__label__1	‘ Though I am old and ugly now , -- much older by life and habit than years though , -- I was once as young as any .
__label__0	Now , there is nothing of the kind , and it was found in a perfect state of preservation . ''
__label__1	But , invested for the moment with extraordinary power , he raised himself completely : obliging me to rise too , or I could not have still supported him .
__label__1	This slight , small , patient figure , neatly dressed in homely stuffs , and indicating nothing but the dull , household virtues , that have so little in common with the received idea of heroism and greatness , unless , indeed , any ray of them should shine through the lives of the great ones of the earth , when it becomes a constellation and is tracked in <NAME> straightway -- this slight , small , patient figure , leaning on the man still young but worn and grey , is she , his sister , who , of all the world , went over to him in his shame and put her hand in his , and with a sweet composure and determination , led him hopefully upon his barren way .
__label__0	The inhabitants , having driven off their flocks of sheep , their camels , and their horses , were taking refuge in the plains of the north .
__label__1	<NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , looking round him with increased caution , and speaking in a whisper .
__label__1	By <NAME> , I wish it was the case with us ! ’ ‘ Why ? ’ ‘ Because if it was , I ’ d take the lead with you , <NAME> , and be as wise as <NAME> , dull Care !
__label__1	“ So , ” said <NAME> , “ I must be taken as I have been made .
__label__1	‘ Master ! ’ he cried , stooping on one knee and catching at his hand .
__label__1	Now , young man , you just have the kindness to take yourself off to the schoolroom , and take the boys off with you , and don ’ t you stir out of there till you have leave given you , or you and I may fall out in a way that ’ ll spoil your beauty , handsome as you think yourself , and so I tell you. ’ ‘ Indeed ! ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	You ’ re all affection and et cetera , ain ’ t you ? ’ ‘ Oh , yes , my Lady ! ’ ‘ Yes , I ’ m sure you are ; and so ’ s that gentlemanly creature Grangeby .
__label__1	As it is the custom in these parts to give a horse a gallon or so of cold water whenever he is in a foam with heat , we halted for that purpose , at a log inn in the wood , far removed from any other residence .
__label__1	Such <NAME> as he and Ma make of themselves ! ''
__label__0	They made their way then along the narrow valley separating two of the largest spurs of <NAME> .
__label__1	If you do n't like it , I ca n't help it .
__label__0	Just as <NAME> dismounted to discover the exact direction of the road , he heard a confused murmuring sound from the west .
__label__1	I ’ ll write another to-morrow morning .
__label__1	Is it possible ! ’ cried <NAME> , ‘ that anyone of my own sex can have sat by , and not have seen the misery these men have caused me ?
__label__1	Mr <NAME> replied by taking from his pocket a small and very greasy parcel , slowly unfolding it , and displaying a little slab of plum-cake extremely indigestible in appearance , and bordered with a paste of white sugar an inch and a half deep .
__label__0	`` Why , do you think -- '' `` Why not ?
__label__0	The natives , intimidated by the lesson they had received in the evening , remained in concealment , whilst the <NAME> picked cocoa-nuts , and gathered anti-scorbutic plants .
__label__1	‘ I say , my dear , ’ rejoined that lady , with a face of unfathomable mystery , ‘ what does this invitation to dinner mean ?
__label__1	<NAME> ’ s servant ! ’ said <NAME> earnestly .
__label__1	I mourned for my child-wife , taken from her blooming world , so young .
__label__1	Their especial interest in the public-house would seem to imply some latent rakishness in the canine character ; for little was eaten there , and they , having no taste for beer or tobacco ( Mrs <NAME> ’ s dog is said to have smoked , but proof is wanting ) , could only have been attracted by sympathy with loose convivial habits .
__label__1	‘ I am a determined character , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	She shall be rich -- noble ! ’ <NAME> took out his pocket-handkerchief , and wiped his eyes .
__label__1	`` Cos , '' says Jo with a perplexed stare but without being at all shaken in his certainty , `` cos that there 's the wale , the bonnet , and the gownd .
__label__1	Unembellished by any violence of gesticulation , this might have seemed no very high compliment to the lady 's charms ; but , as <NAME> accompanied the threat with many warlike gestures , she was much touched with this proof of his devotion , and protested , with great admiration , that he was indeed a dove .
__label__1	I believe there was not a soul in the place , except myself , who knew that she did it purposely to wound and gall me !
__label__1	`` His successor is in my house now -- in possession , I think he calls it .
__label__0	I will now add that all our observations , so far made , have only served to confirm me in my opinion .
__label__0	`` We must let him alone ! ''
__label__0	It was evidently a hard , impenetrable body , and not the soft substance that forms the bodies of the great marine mammalia .
__label__0	But it was with the young mulatto that he claimed to have contracted the heaviest obligation .
__label__0	“ I am always wrong ! ” replied <NAME> , and he hurried on to finish his task .
__label__1	I am the umble instrument of umbly serving him , and he puts me on an eminence I hardly could have hoped to reach .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> , with folded arms , remained motionless .
__label__0	The instruments suspended under the awning clattered together as though they would be dashed to pieces ; the pipes of the spiral bent to and fro , threatening to break at every instant ; and the water-tanks jostled and jarred with tremendous din .
__label__1	But as ‘ them two clever ones ’ -- Mrs Affery ’ s perpetual reference , in whom her personality was swallowed up -- were agreed to accept <NAME> as a matter of course , she had nothing for it but to follow suit .
__label__0	ignorant and barbarous brethren , whom religion alone can instruct and civilize. ” Dr. <NAME> , yielding to the priest ’ s request , talked to him long and fully about <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , ’ returned my aunt gravely , ‘ I can ’ t say .
__label__0	<NAME> is comprised in the series of ringed mountains of the first order , in the division of great circles .
__label__0	To hear them talk , it would have been more extraordinary if nothing of the kind appeared .
__label__0	`` Let us go down and urge the captain to leave these parts , where we ought never to have come , at once ! ''
__label__1	Even children so require sustaining under the general excitement that a pieman who has established himself for the occasion at the corner of the court says his brandy-balls go off like smoke .
__label__1	It was in his childish days .
__label__1	The Chief <NAME> had signified , in return , that he had no objection to look on at the most expensive thing in that way that could be done ; and the day of the dinner was now come .
__label__1	But it was in vain for the kind Captain to make such preparations for <NAME> , who sorely tried to do some honour to them , but could touch nothing , and could only weep and weep again .
__label__1	Therefore , when <NAME> and I sat down with him by his fire , I asked him first of all whether he relied on <NAME> 's judgment and sources of information ?
__label__0	`` That was well said , captain , '' replied the sailor ; `` but , all the same , it is my opinion that we shall not find that gentleman until he pleases . ''
__label__0	The limits of the horizon , too , had become much circumscribed .
__label__1	C. ” ’ said the stranger -- ‘ queer set out -- old fellow ’ s likeness , and “ P .
__label__0	They then left the transformation to complete itself , and it would not take less than ten or twelve days for the sulphuret of iron to be changed to sulphate of iron and the alumina into sulphate of alumina , two equally soluble substances , the others , flint , burnt coal , and cinders , not being so .
__label__0	`` But , '' asked the doctor of <NAME> , `` are you not going to tell the crew about this letter ? ''
__label__1	‘ If you ’ re afraid of the fox , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ you may dismiss all present expectations of seeing that animal .
__label__0	The apparatus had been placed at one of the windows of the dining-room at <NAME> , and consequently overlooked the shore and the bay .
__label__1	After breakfast she took me to her own home , and a beautiful little home it was .
__label__1	Cramped in all kinds of dim cupboards and hutches at <NAME> 's , the oldest of men carried on the business gravely .
__label__1	You brought no one with you ? ” “ <NAME> , sir !
__label__1	‘ And Mr Sloppy , whenever you come to my house , be sure you never go away without having had a good dinner of meat , beer , vegetables , and pudding. ’ This still further brightened the face of affairs ; for , the highly sympathetic <NAME> , first broadly staring and grinning , and then roaring with laughter , <NAME> and <NAME> followed suit , and <NAME> trumped the trick .
__label__0	The atmosphere was less buoyant than that of the earth , but no difficulty in ascending was to be apprehended .
__label__0	He will find his master ! ” “ Who ? ” asked <NAME> .
__label__1	Because he felt any new compunction towards it ?
__label__1	Is that long enough ? ’ I answered , laughing , that I thought we might get through it in that time , but that he must come also ; for he would find that his renown had preceded him , and that he was almost as great a personage as I was .
__label__0	Dozens of babies , who were born at the time when the works were resumed , had never yet breathed the outer air .
__label__1	But all happiness has an end -- hence the chief pleasure of its next beginning -- and as it was now growing late , they agreed it was time to turn their faces homewards .
__label__1	Be that as it may , he had directed Mrs. Pocket to be brought up from her cradle as one who in the nature of things must marry a title , and who was to be guarded from the acquisition of plebeian domestic knowledge .
__label__1	She can ’ t be more than seventeen -- say eighteen at the outside .
__label__0	`` The poor man must no doubt have been in this state for a long time , '' said <NAME> .
__label__0	Having seen no sign of land in this direction , and a strong southerly wind blowing at the time , <NAME> retraced his course as far as S. lat .
__label__1	‘ For rest and relief. ’ She glanced round the sombre room , and appeared from the motion of her lips to repeat the words to herself , as calling it to witness how little of either it afforded her .
__label__1	The sun was striking in at the great windows of the court , through the glittering drops of rain upon the glass , and it made a broad shaft of light between the two-and-thirty and the Judge , linking both together , and perhaps reminding some among the audience how both were passing on , with absolute equality , to the greater Judgment that knoweth all things , and can not err .
__label__0	The passage till then impracticable , became all at once possible .
__label__1	It ’ ll lead in a roundabout manner to your buying damage and waste of <NAME> and Co. at a nominal price , or even getting it for nothing. ’ ‘ Aha ! ’ thought the dressmaker .
__label__1	To know something of the life of one in whom I felt such interest ; to see her in the street , to pass the house in which she lived , to meet her sometimes in her walks , to hope that a day might come when I might be in a condition to tell her of my love , this was the utmost extent of my thoughts .
__label__1	But he saw nothing of this .
__label__1	<NAME> little children ! ’ ‘ Ah , poor little children ! ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	Nothing being said on the other side , he had to begin again , and began with new embarrassment .
__label__0	He must risk his life even to afford to all he might meet the proof of his want of sight .
__label__1	And with that , <NAME> would utter a melodious chirrup , and cry ‘ <NAME> ; ’ and <NAME> , who , for any sign of life he had previously given , might have been a wooden or stuffed representation of a blackbird indifferently executed , would come to the side of the cage in three small jumps , and , thrusting his bill between the bars , turn his sightless head towards his old master -- and at that moment it would be very difficult to determine which of the two was the happier , the bird or <NAME> .
__label__0	Two hundred houses at the very least !
__label__1	They had lounged away in a poverty-stricken , purposeless , accidental manner , quite natural and unimpeachable .
__label__0	They now resorted to the only remaining expedient .
__label__0	The inhabitants of this part of the country are well aware of this , and so take measures to guard against it .
__label__1	Perhaps it was so likened by the lonely <NAME> , standing on the brink of the lock .
__label__1	`` I suppose it 's chops at the <NAME> 's Arms . ''
__label__0	The force of the wind carried the doctor farther onward than he wanted to go ; but it changed a second time , and bore him back exactly to his starting-point , on the sort of enclosed island where he had passed the preceding night .
__label__1	How well I recollect the kind of day it was !
__label__1	<NAME> night , my dear. ’ Somehow , <NAME> was not so well pleased with this assurance and this prospect as she might have been .
__label__1	When I cries out that night , “ I know you now !
__label__1	I must tell you how it was .
__label__0	He also thanked God for having brought about this meeting with <NAME> , which at the same time enabled him to do a good action , and afforded him additional means for concealing his true character .
__label__1	‘ Whatever you want most , if I could be that .
__label__1	They were the prelude to the first reception of Mr and <NAME> at dinner , and they skilfully placed <NAME> on his usual ground in the new family .
__label__0	On the 13th June , 1597 , the <NAME> abandoned the ship , which had not stirred from her icy prison , and commending themselves to the protection of <NAME> , the two open boats put to sea .
__label__0	Here they form a ring , surrounding a little inland lake , that communicates with the sea by means of gaps .
__label__1	It might be worthwhile , sometimes , to inquire what <NAME> is , and how men work to change her , and whether , in the enforced distortions so produced , it is not natural to be unnatural .
__label__1	He knew no better fields than those near <NAME> , and no better means of getting at them than by passing Mr <NAME> ’ s house .
__label__0	The plain was furrowed in some places by fantastic winding creeks surrounded by box , and whose waters were rather temporary than permanent .
__label__1	<NAME> ! ’ at intervals all day , and ‘ Lock ho !
__label__1	You have hit the probabilities exactly. ’ ‘ And with regard to your head Governor , ’ said the <NAME> , ‘ why an interview had better come about nat ’ ral between us .
__label__1	'By all means , ' observed <NAME> , with great alacrity .
__label__1	“ ‘ Blow me , ” says <NAME> ; and the mare neighed as if she were precisely of the same opinion .
__label__0	If Madame the <NAME> becomes as cold as this every time that her surface is withdrawn from the sunlight for fourteen days , I do n't think , boys , that her hospitality is much to hanker after ! ''
__label__1	<NAME> looked at it -- it was the picture that resembled <NAME> -- as if it were a living thing ; and with a wicked , silent laugh upon his face , that seemed in part addressed to it , though it was all derisive of the great man standing so unconscious beside him .
__label__0	Three days ' march from hence , the traveller came to the town of Lin-tsing , standing at the mouth of the Yu-ho canal , the principal rendezvous for the innumerable boats that carry so much merchandise to the provinces of <NAME> and <NAME> .
__label__0	Besides , the leaders of the expedition no longer acted in concert , so after repairing the largest of the vessels in the <NAME> , where <NAME> boasts of having sown the first orange-pips which were ever brought to <NAME> , the <NAME> set out for <NAME> in <NAME> , where they arrived on the 15th of November , after a cruise of seven months , not forty-five days , as M. Ferdinand <NAME> asserts in the <NAME> , and as M. Ed .
__label__0	In fact , the castaways would have been always able to procure fire , in some mode or other , but no human power could supply another grain of corn , if unfortunately this should be lost !
__label__0	At length the vessel hove in sight of the town of <NAME> , upon the island of the same name , and , on the 15th of April , at 11 o ’ clock in the morning , she anchored in the port .
__label__0	`` The idea is good , '' replied the reporter ; `` but could you climb to the top of those giants ? ''
__label__0	The interior is of pitchy blackness , but so vast is the gulf that the summits of several mountains situated in it can be made out at a depth of some 300 fathoms , so only fancy where their bases must be !
__label__0	It was from here that he organized his sledge and canoe expeditions ; he discovered <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> .
__label__1	I advised you to ; but no , it ’ s not your way to take advice .
__label__0	Apart , in separate compartments , were spread out chaplets of pearls of the greatest beauty , which reflected the electric light in little sparks of fire ; pink pearls , torn from the pinna-marina of the <NAME> ; green pearls of the haliotyde iris ; yellow , blue and black pearls , the curious productions of the divers molluscs of every ocean , and certain mussels of the water-courses of the <NAME> ; lastly , several specimens of inestimable value which had been gathered from the rarest pintadines .
__label__1	“ <NAME> and <NAME> , ” cried one of the nurses to two of the children , “ if you go a bouncing up against them bushes you 'll fall over into the river and be drownded , and what 'll your pa say then ? ” At the same time this nurse picked up Mrs. <NAME> 's handkerchief , and said , “ If that do n't make six times you 've dropped it , <NAME> ! ” Upon which Mrs. <NAME> laughed and said , “ Thank you , <NAME> , ” and settling herself in one chair only , resumed her book .
__label__0	The end of the bridge which rested on the right bank of the <NAME> was to be firm , but the other end on the left bank was to be movable , so that it might be raised by means of a counterpoise , as some canal bridges are managed .
__label__1	‘ We call it a Hall up in <NAME> , because it sounds better , but they don ’ t know it by that name in these parts .
__label__1	“ Perhaps it is as well we _did _lose sight of him , for he has been living alone there , in the most abject misery , all the time , and he is poor -- very poor. ” ‘ “ Very good , ” said the attorney .
__label__0	There , by the united efforts of the settlers the pieces of wreck were hauled up .
__label__0	“ You had much better buy a full cargo of fine cod than throw your money into the <NAME> Sea. ” “ That ’ s not the question , ” said the Major .
__label__1	He then stirred the fire and left me .
__label__1	You may file a strong man 's heart away for a good many years , but it will tell all of a sudden at last . ''
__label__0	During the night the ship might disappear and leave for ever , and , this ship gone , would another ever return to the waters of <NAME> ?
__label__0	Climbing down the crater , they went round the cone and reached their encampment of the previous night .
__label__1	‘ Who sent it me ? ’ ‘ Why , your friend , ’ replied the man .
__label__0	Stop your talk , and answer me a few questions .
__label__1	For <NAME> wos wery good to me too , and I knows it . ''
__label__1	So we took our departure after a very loving farewell between <NAME> and her betrothed , and during our walk she was so happy and so full of old <NAME> 's praises that I would not have said a word in his disparagement for any consideration .
__label__1	A field of outsiders are always going in to bowl at the <NAME> , and we block the balls. ’ <NAME> asked what became of the bowlers ?
__label__1	They kept him , many times , from what did him real harm .
__label__1	I ’ ll tell you wot it is , sir ; them as is always a-idlin ’ in public- houses it don ’ t damage at all , and them as is alvays a-workin ’ wen they can , it damages too much .
__label__0	`` Not a president elected by the nation , '' replied <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> with his right hand signalled to the man at the wheel what direction he was to take , and with his left hand he indicated to <NAME> the orders for the engines .
__label__1	‘ Very , very , <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> , without moving a muscle of his face .
__label__1	He had scarcely moved since the trial began ; and now that the judge ceased to speak , he still remained in the same strained attitude of close attention , with his gaze bent on him , as though he listened still .
__label__1	Then , he launched into a general eulogium on the <NAME> .
__label__0	This Dirk Peters had really existed ?
__label__1	‘ It gives me great pleasure , ’ said Mr Dombey , with cumbrous gallantry , ‘ that a gentleman so nearly connected with myself as <NAME> is , should have had the honour and happiness of rendering the least assistance to Mrs Granger. ’ Mr <NAME> bowed to her .
__label__0	It was probably <NAME> , for they ascertained , after doubling it , that the land inclined towards the north-east , and the east .
__label__0	<NAME> and water were easily procurable there .
__label__1	Are people really left all night , untried , in those black sties ? —Every night .
__label__1	And all that night the coffin stands ready by the old portmanteau ; and the lonely figure on the bed , whose path in life has lain through five and forty years , lies there with no more track behind him that any one can trace than a deserted infant .
__label__1	I hardly understand you. ’ ‘ What will you take to be paid out ? ’ said the butcher .
__label__1	<NAME> there no stranger with him ? ’ ‘ I ’ ll take my world-without-end everlasting <NAME> that you warn ’ t with him , ’ answered <NAME> .
__label__1	The gentlemen soon saunter after them .
__label__1	The morning hurry and flutter had been great ; for , long and anxiously as I had waited for <NAME> , his hint had come like a surprise at last .
__label__0	`` It would be a superb idea , though , '' said <NAME> .
__label__0	But <NAME> would not own herself vanquished .
__label__0	We took it at first , as <NAME> had done , for a sailing vessel .
__label__1	The uncongenial oddity of its surroundings , with the two brass knobs of the iron safe of <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> staring from a corner , like the eyes of some dull dragon , only made it the more delightful .
__label__1	‘ It ’ s a long way from her home to the wharf , and then she was alarmed to see a couple of young scoundrels fighting , and was timorous on the water besides .
__label__1	Early in the afternoon the subdued sound of his heavy military trot is heard on the turf in the avenue as he rides on with imaginary clank and jingle of accoutrements under the old elm-trees .
__label__1	* * * * * I HAVE now arrived at the close of this book .
__label__0	On the 1st of December , 1783 , three hundred thousand spectators were crowded around the Tuileries .
__label__0	From this date , the usual incidents of navigation in these latitudes were repeated day by day .
__label__0	During the night , or rather what ought to have been the night of the 19th-20th , my sleep was disturbed by a strange dream .
__label__1	At some distance from the factories , and on the highest and pleasantest ground in the neighbourhood , stands their hospital , or boarding-house for the sick : it is the best house in those parts , and was built by an eminent merchant for his own residence .
__label__0	The captain must have thrown it into the sea when I was no longer on board. ” “ But the captain ?
__label__0	The Projectile advanced , but the scene of desolation seemed to remain unchanged .
__label__1	'Oh , you know , <NAME> , he must be mad , ' said Mrs. Sowerberry .
__label__0	You are not a myth ?
__label__1	So will my daughter <NAME> be .
__label__1	'Why , what does the boy mean ? '
__label__1	As we were going along , she asked me what he had said ; and I told her he had said it was all right .
__label__0	We were then upon the dangerous coast of <NAME> .
__label__1	On my knees , I am certain , in my heart and soul I am certain , nothing !
__label__0	An elephant that belongs to an Indian who lives but a hundred steps from here . ''
__label__0	You are quite correct , it is the 26th of March. ” “ Strange ! ” muttered <NAME> .
__label__1	The child had sat at his parents ’ feet for hours together , with his little hands patiently folded in each other , and his thin wan face raised towards them .
__label__0	“ Look , father ! ” <NAME> was not mistaken .
__label__1	Again and again he listened for the sound of wheels behind .
__label__1	A Stage-coach Ride from that City to 153 <NAME> , and thence to <NAME> .
__label__1	The latter character carried it hollow at this period of the voyage , and triumphed over the <NAME> at every meal , by inquiring where he supposed the <NAME> ( which left <NAME> a week after us ) was _now_ : and where he supposed the ‘ <NAME> ’ steam-packet was _now_ : and what he thought of sailing vessels , as compared with steamships _now_ : and so beset his life with pestilent attacks of that kind , that he too was obliged to affect despondency , for very peace and quietude .
__label__0	The greater portion of this is laid out in gardens .
__label__0	For the first year and a half of his existence he had been the foster-child of the sturdy wife of a vine-dresser of <NAME> -- a lineal descendant of the heroes of ancient prowess ; in a word , he was one of those individuals whom nature seems to have predestined for remarkable things , and around whose cradle have hovered the fairy godmothers of adventure and good luck .
__label__0	The vessel could get under weigh at once .
__label__0	There 's an iceberg we can cut into !
__label__1	‘ It is entirely a private and personal matter , that has brought me here , <NAME> , ’ continued <NAME> , faltering , ‘ and <NAME> -- ’ ‘ Here ! ’ interposed the <NAME> , as an assurance that he was at hand , and might be relied upon .
__label__0	“ Perhaps tomorrow the river may be practicable. ” “ And will that save my unhappy men ? ” cried <NAME> .
__label__1	I have seen passion in many forms , but I have never seen it in such a form as that .
__label__0	The chief question now was , whether this was merely a vein which would yield comparatively little , or a bed occupying a large extent .
__label__0	`` To know what is going on in <NAME> . ''
__label__1	Why are we now in the mansions of the rich and great , my friends ?
__label__0	In short , they sometimes went faster than they liked , and had some difficulty in keeping their feet ; but hope gave them strength , for it was not at random that they made their way along the shore .
__label__0	This sight of course made the <NAME> still more anxious for reprisals , and the natives on their side had to avenge the death of five chiefs and a score of men .
__label__1	‘ How came you here ? ’ ‘ Child ! ’ cried <NAME> , hurrying in .
__label__0	Gum-trees growing here and there were covered with enormous ants ' nests , and soon deprived of gum by those insects .
__label__1	‘ Fire away ! ’ ‘ I ha ’ coom , ’ <NAME> began , raising his eyes from the floor , after a moment ’ s consideration , ‘ to ask yo yor advice .
__label__1	I don ’ t say whether with having some knowledge of it that hasn ’ t come out. ’ ‘ You don ’ t surprise me .
__label__0	The whole journey there and back might be performed in eight days .
__label__0	I folded my arms , as well as I could , and looked my uncle full in the face .
__label__0	As fate would have it then , <NAME> and his two companions were saved .
__label__0	By dint of close economy , combined with tact and prudence , she managed to support and educate him , working day and night , denying herself everything , that she might give him all he needed , watching over him and caring for him like a mother .
__label__1	Of course he might come in. ’ And so he did .
__label__0	Would not the millions of spectators that had thronged <NAME> to witness their departure , now rush to the other extremity of the <NAME> to welcome them back ?
__label__1	‘ My secretary would have to make himself master of the foreign policy of the world , as it is mirrored in the newspapers ; to run his eye over all accounts of public meetings , all leading articles , and accounts of the proceedings of public bodies ; and to make notes of anything which it appeared to him might be made a point of , in any little speech upon the question of some petition lying on the table , or anything of that kind .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> had made his preliminary arrangements , and was looking over the coffee-room blinds at the passengers in the street , when the waiter entered , and announced that the chaise was ready -- an announcement which the vehicle itself confirmed , by forthwith appearing before the coffee- room blinds aforesaid .
__label__1	M. R. F. , who is a much younger cavalier than I , and a professed admirer of beauty , was so affable as to remark the other day ( he paid us a visit of two days up the river there , and much objected to the accommodation of the hotel ) , that <NAME> ought to have her portrait painted .
__label__1	<NAME> , with such power of movement as he has , arranges himself a little to receive him .
__label__0	<NAME> fell from <NAME> ’ s eyes .
__label__0	<NAME> fish and animals seemed to form strange conjunctions .
__label__1	asks Mrs. Bagnet , stopping in her cheerful talk .
__label__0	After a moment or two of the most profound interest , it was a great gratification to all to learn that the <NAME> was on the right parallel , and only about 15 miles west of the precise spot where the Projectile had disappeared beneath the waves .
__label__1	She thought of the sunrise on rolling rivers , of the sunrise on wide seas , of the sunrise on rich landscapes , of the sunrise on great forests where the birds were waking and the trees were rustling ; and she looked down into the living grave on which the sun had risen , with her father in it three-and-twenty years , and said , in a burst of sorrow and compassion , ‘ No , no , I have never seen him in my life ! ’ If <NAME> had had the inclination and the power to write a satire on family pride , he would have had no need to go for an avenging illustration out of the family of his beloved .
__label__1	We are very thankful to you , ’ she added aloud ; ‘ but neither of us could part from the other if all the wealth of the world were halved between us. ’ Mrs <NAME> was a little disconcerted by this reception of her proposal , and looked at the old man , who tenderly took <NAME> ’ s hand and detained it in his own , as if she could have very well dispensed with his company or even his earthly existence .
__label__1	‘ Before that boy says a word , hear me. ’ <NAME> bit his lip and shook his head in a threatening manner , but appeared for the moment unable to articulate a syllable .
__label__1	The old man , looking up at the cages after another look at us , went through the list .
__label__0	For himself , although the departure of the <NAME> had displeased his companions , he continued his route , and reached the river St. Joseph , where he found an encampment of <NAME> , and where <NAME> speedily rejoined him .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> on one side , <NAME> and <NAME> on the other , going along by the palisade , surveyed the absolutely dark and deserted corral .
__label__0	164 <NAME> -- Discovery of <NAME> -- The coast of <NAME> -- <NAME> at <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> -- Joao da Nova -- <NAME> 's second expedition -- The King of <NAME> -- The early life of <NAME> -- The taking of <NAME> -- The siege and capture of <NAME> -- Second expedition against <NAME> -- Ceylon -- The <NAME> -- Death of <NAME> -- Fate of the <NAME> empire of the <NAME> .
__label__0	Many times since have I thought of this singular phenomenon without being able to find for it any satisfactory explanation .
__label__1	“ <NAME> is the best policy , ” is it ?
__label__0	This shooting globe suddenly appearing in shadow at a distance of at most 200 miles , ought , according to <NAME> , to have a diameter of 2,000 yards .
__label__1	His coat was ever so sleek , and his complexion so clear , that the prince resolved to essay the purifying qualities of the same water that his friend resorted to .
__label__1	The rich and beautiful wardrobe purchased by these agents , in the course of a few weeks made its way through the intervening country , bristling with custom-houses , garrisoned by an immense army of shabby mendicants in uniform who incessantly repeated the <NAME> ’ s Petition over it , as if every individual warrior among them were the ancient Belisarius : and of whom there were so many Legions , that unless the <NAME> had expended just one bushel and a half of silver money relieving their distresses , they would have worn the wardrobe out before it got to <NAME> , by turning it over and over .
__label__1	said I , knowing how it pleased her to have her confidence received with an appearance of interest .
__label__0	This was succeeded by a still worse road , running for a league alongside of the river , which is scarcely ten paces wide here , although it was then swollen by the melting of the snow .
__label__1	I am as giddy as a drunken man .
__label__0	He accordingly resolved to manufacture and employ pyroxyle , although it has some inconveniences , that is to say , a great inequality of effect , an excessive inflammability , since it takes fire at one hundred and seventy degrees instead of two hundred and forty , and lastly , an instantaneous deflagration which might damage the firearms .
__label__1	It is still Monday night. ” “ Thank God ! ” “ And you have all to-morrow , Tuesday , to rest in , ” said <NAME> .
__label__0	“ The war-tree of these cannibals ! ” said the doctor ; “ the Indians merely carry off the scalp , but these negroes take the whole head. ” “ A mere matter of fashion ! ” said <NAME> .
__label__0	While <NAME> , in a feverish , nervous state , repaired to the pilot-boat , the others directed their course to the police-station at <NAME> .
__label__0	The girl was about to follow him , when a blow from a lance struck him , and he was thrown into the water .
__label__1	‘ Two witnesses to it ; <NAME> knows the nature of an oath , he does ; we shall have you there , sir .
__label__0	A painful suspicion seized me .
__label__1	As she gently opened the window , and looked eastward down the prison yard , the spikes upon the wall were tipped with red , then made a sullen purple pattern on the sun as it came flaming up into the heavens .
__label__0	At the moment the men who have been following the eagles ' movements see them alight to eat the meat , they raise fearful cries , the meat is dropped and the eagles take to flight , and thus the men have no difficulty in taking the diamonds that are attached to the meat .
__label__0	And do you know how many grains one ear bears ? ” “ No , upon my word. ” “ About eighty ! ” said <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Better there than here , ’ said a third voice aloud -- <NAME> ’ s , though she did not move .
__label__1	`` I looked in here , '' he observes , `` just before you , with the intention of giving this deceased man , whom I never saw alive , some employment at his trade of copying .
__label__1	No favoring in this shop .
__label__1	After a great many jokes about squeezing the ladies ’ sleeves , and a vast quantity of blushing at sundry jocose proposals , that the ladies should sit in the gentlemen ’ s laps , the whole party were stowed down in the barouche ; and the stout gentleman proceeded to hand the things from the fat boy ( who had mounted up behind for the purpose ) into the carriage .
__label__1	‘ But why did you tell her ?
__label__1	When he turned round again with a composed countenance , his subordinate still stood in the same place , and the dolls ’ dressmaker sat behind the door with a look of horror .
__label__0	The next morning I went on to the bridge .
__label__1	What the unknown prisoner had written will never be read , but he had written something , and hidden it away to keep it from the gaoler. ” “ My father , ” exclaimed <NAME> , “ you are ill ! ” He had suddenly started up , with his hand to his head .
__label__1	But he set up no monopoly of the general attention , or the conversation .
__label__0	“ He hides it very well , but he is a poet himself when his time comes , and he admires as much as we do all these beauties of nature .
__label__1	`` This , '' returned <NAME> , `` is as it should be .
__label__1	' I ' b dot certaid you cad , ' said <NAME> , who was the attendant sprite ; 'but I 'll idquire . '
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> , do n't you go a-sidling round the gallery like that '' -- the dirty little man was shuffling about with his shoulder against the wall , and his eyes on the intruder , in a manner that looked threatening -- '' because I know you and wo n't have it . ''
__label__0	A hundred and fifty miles only separated them in longitude , and seventy in latitude .
__label__1	‘ No -- not much o ’ that either ; you ’ ve lost ten minutes here , and gone away as wise as you came , arter all .
__label__0	I was stretched on the ground , just under the shelter of a bush of algae , when , raising my head , I saw some enormous mass , casting phosphorescent gleams , pass blusteringly by .
__label__0	It appeared prudent to him to heighten the palisade and to flank it with a sort of blockhouse , which , if necessary , the settlers could hold against the enemy .
__label__1	I have brought an old friend with me. ’ Looking round , he saw <NAME> in her big cap which had been long abandoned , with a basket on her arm as in the bygone days , chuckling rapturously .
__label__0	`` Be easy on that matter , '' I replied , `` there is no fear of my delaying on the road . ''
__label__1	Holding up his hands in a last prayer to have his fate reversed , he saw an alteration in the <NAME> 's hood and dress .
__label__1	When her husband was brought in , she turned a look upon him , so sustaining , so encouraging , so full of admiring love and pitying tenderness , yet so courageous for his sake , that it called the healthy blood into his face , brightened his glance , and animated his heart .
__label__1	He asked her , after short consideration , why she supposed so .
__label__0	That a phrase so evidently irritating should be pronounced by two of the principal men in the country !
__label__1	‘ To make his fortune , ’ Mr <NAME> repeated , in the same dumb manner .
__label__1	‘ Show us into the room at once , without announcing us , ’ said the little man , ‘ and it ’ s yours. ’ <NAME> threw the painted tops into a corner , and led the way through a dark passage , and up a wide staircase .
__label__1	To be sure , the better and profounder part of her character was not within his scope of perception ; for in natures , as in seas , depth answers unto depth ; but he soon began to read the rest with a student ’ s eye .
__label__0	<NAME> was the <NAME> country , with its villages topped with roofs turned over like <NAME> caps .
__label__1	We may never meet again. ’ ‘ In our course through life we shall meet the people who are coming to meet _us_ , from many strange places and by many strange roads , ’ was the composed reply ; ‘ and what it is set to us to do to them , and what it is set to them to do to us , will all be done. ’ There was something in the manner of these words that jarred upon <NAME> ’ s ear .
__label__0	He saw his daughter alone , without a protector .
__label__1	My opinion is “ keep ‘ em at it ” . ’ ‘ My good madam , ’ returned Mr Dombey , ‘ you have not acquired your reputation undeservedly ; and I beg you to believe , <NAME> , that I am more than satisfied with your excellent system of management , and shall have the greatest pleasure in commending it whenever my poor commendation -- ’ Mr <NAME> ’ s loftiness when he affected to disparage his own importance , passed all bounds -- ‘ can be of any service .
__label__1	In this yard a wash of sheets and table-cloths tried ( in vain , for want of air ) to get itself dried on a line or two ; and among those flapping articles was sitting in a chair , like the last mariner left alive on the deck of a damp ship without the power of furling the sails , a little woe-begone young man .
__label__0	The <NAME> lamp was of no use here .
__label__0	These wise words of <NAME> , in his <NAME> la <NAME> , might have been used by <NAME> , so exactly do they correspond with and express his sentiments .
__label__0	he was compelled , therefore , to give up the idea , and let his new friend run the chances of a public conference .
__label__0	[ Illustration ] The Governor was born on the island of <NAME> , and he has never left the place ; he did the honors of his capital , which consisted of three wooden houses , for himself and the Lutheran minister , of a school , and shops which were supplied by what was cast upon the shore from wrecked ships .
__label__1	The night wore out , and , as he stood upon the bridge listening to the water as it splashed the river-walls of the <NAME> of <NAME> , where the picturesque confusion of houses and cathedral shone bright in the light of the moon , the day came coldly , looking like a dead face out of the sky .
__label__0	<NAME> is an old sea-dog , who has carried his canvas bag into every corner of the world . ''
__label__1	‘ This whelp is the only creature she cares for .
__label__1	It won ’ t do. ’ ‘ No , ’ said Mr Boffin , with his voice still dropped , ‘ it really won ’ t .
__label__1	Their mode of bestowing the prisoners at night ( which is of general adoption ) differs from ours , and is both simple and effective .
__label__1	The irresolute fingers fluttered more and more ineffectually about the trembling lip on every such occasion , and the sharpest practitioners gave him up as a hopeless job .
__label__1	Consequently he fills and empties his glass with a smack of his lips and is proceeding with his refreshment when an idea enters his mind .
__label__1	`` You may -- the memory of what is past half makes me hope you will -- have pain in this .
__label__0	At six in the morning I rose .
__label__0	`` Well , I repeat to you , '' replied the burgomaster , tartly , `` that if the people of <NAME> do not profit by this occasion to vindicate their rights , they will be unworthy of their name . ''
__label__0	`` We shall have to beat the forest , '' said the engineer , `` and rid the island of these wretches .
__label__0	The horses and the cattle here are of incomparable docility .
__label__0	Why did the candles , just as at the theatre , burn with unwonted refulgence ?
__label__1	sounded all over the <NAME> .
__label__1	When from thy boiling store , thou shalt fill each jar brim full by-and-by , dost thou think that thou wilt always kill outright the robber Fancy lurking within—or sometimes only maim him and distort him !
__label__1	The matron looked , from the little kettle , to the beadle , who was moving towards the door ; and as the beadle coughed , preparatory to bidding her good-night , bashfully inquired whether -- whether he would n't take a cup of tea ?
__label__1	The stranger said nothing until <NAME> put his key in his door ; then , seeming to make sure of his identity from the action , he spoke : ‘ I beg your pardon , ’ he said , coming from the window with a frank and smiling air , and a prepossessing address ; ‘ the beans. ’ <NAME> was quite at a loss .
__label__0	A few icebergs were visible in the distance , while some drifts and packs were still going east .
__label__1	<NAME> being presently served up stairs , he kept a watch on Fledgeby until <NAME> ’ s cup was empty , and then directed him with his finger ( as if that young gentleman were a slow Retriever ) to go and fetch it .
__label__1	A damp mist rose from the river , and the marshy ground about ; and spread itself over the dreary fields .
__label__1	‘ I should give her , ’ said the doctor at length , ‘ a tea-spoonful , every now and then , of hot brandy and water. ’ ‘ Why , that ’ s exactly what we ’ ve done , sir ! ’ said the delighted landlady .
__label__0	After all , they were but making a voyage -- a strange , yet a transient , excursion through solar regions hitherto untraversed ; but if the professor ’ s calculations were correct -- and why should they be doubted ? -- their little vessel was destined , after a two years ’ absence , once more to return “ to port. ” The landing , indeed , might be a matter of difficulty ; but with the good prospect before them of once again standing on terrestrial shores , they had nothing to do at present except to make themselves as comfortable as they could in their present quarters .
__label__1	But he had not spoken out of his own will and desire ; and he felt it in his heart a noble return for his late injurious treatment to be faithful to the last to those who had repudiated him .
__label__0	The enormous heaps were melting away with majestic slowness .
__label__0	It was supposed that <NAME> had slept on shore , to be ready to visit the workshops in the morning .
__label__0	Then Harding raised his voice , and to the extreme surprise of his companions , he uttered these words , -- “ <NAME> , you asked for us !
__label__0	Fortune again smiled upon the courageous traveller , and he had now the prospect of seeing these distant lands under exceptionally good and safe circumstances .
__label__0	`` No , <NAME> , '' answered the captain ; `` when the doctor took you from your icy tomb , I did not know who you were , and you have saved me at the risk of your own life , knowing who I was . ''
__label__1	said <NAME> , clenching his fist .
__label__0	That the head of <NAME> was a little too small for his body we admit , but that it was filled to the meninges will be believed .
__label__1	Do you make that of it ? ” <NAME> answered , “ Those are not the exact words. ” “ Not the exact words ! ” repeated the gentleman bitterly .
__label__1	In the meantime , under the surgeon ’ s directions , some men brought a hurdle , on which others made a thick bed of spare clothes covered with loose straw , while he himself contrived some bandages and slings from shawls and handkerchiefs .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> and the sailor were not men to draw back , but they knew that any imprudence on their part , of which they would be the first victims , would fall afterwards on their companions .
__label__1	One of his eyes ( perhaps the eye that used to peep through the keyhole ) was also weak , and looked larger than the other , as if it couldn ’ t collect itself .
__label__1	`` This , '' said <NAME> , `` is my Beauty daughter , <NAME> -- plays and sings odds and ends like her father .
__label__0	cried <NAME> , springing up at a bound .
__label__0	<NAME> imprecations burst from the boat , which immediately continued its way .
__label__0	How I regret not having seen once more <NAME> la Chaise and the circus in the <NAME> ! ''
__label__0	But still I should like them to be submitted to a final examination , in order to make their worth incontestable and uncontested. ” “ Go on , <NAME> , ” said <NAME> ; “ I am ready to answer all your questions. ” “ They are simple enough , as you will see .
__label__1	She went through with me , she went through with the <NAME> , she went through with herself , she went through with everythink .
__label__1	I do n't tell it you on information received .
__label__0	Let us camp here , where we have provisions , and let one of us take your orders to <NAME> to go on to <NAME> Bay. ” This unexpected proposition was greeted with astonishment , and by <NAME> with openly-expressed opposition .
__label__1	The wickets were pitched , and so were a couple of marquees for the rest and refreshment of the contending parties .
__label__0	He took up the torn envelope , and examined it .
__label__1	A-a-matter of business -- do n't be distressed .
__label__0	The gravest questions of morals and politics may be discussed , and even solved .
__label__0	<NAME> was evidently preoccupied , and frequently turned , trying to catch , either some distant noise , or remote glimmer of light .
__label__0	The <NAME> , in reference to the <NAME> or the Projectile , was in her last phase , or octant as it is called , and showed a sharp-horned , attenuated , but brilliant crescent strongly relieved by the black background of the sky .
__label__0	After a few days passed at <NAME> , <NAME> and <NAME> entered <NAME> , and , <NAME> Fedor settling down in <NAME> , neither his son nor his daughter had any occasion to leave him , except to go and see their old mother .
__label__1	Catching up the light , they made the best of their way home , at a good round trot ; and long after their dusky forms had ceased to be discernible , the light might have been seen twinkling and dancing in the distance , like some exhalation of the damp and gloomy atmosphere through which it was swiftly borne .
__label__1	At last he resolved to watch <NAME> and know more of her story .
__label__1	<NAME> , doomed man , while she is near !
__label__0	Man is made for society and not for solitude , and solitude can only engender despair .
__label__0	The land on which man lives is henceforth familiar to him , and he has now only to turn to account the vast resources of the countries to which access has recently become easy , or of which he can without difficulty possess himself .
__label__1	He showed his anxious sense of this last deprivation , by often feeling the lips of other persons when they were talking , and then putting his hand upon his own , as if to assure himself that he had them in the right position .
__label__1	I have thought of that , many times since , to be sure ! ’ She folded her arms tightly on her breast , and laughed in a tone that made the howl of the old woman musical .
__label__1	The salutation between <NAME> and his friends was strictly confined to the freemasonry of the craft ; consisting of a jerking round of the right wrist , and a tossing of the little finger into the air at the same time .
__label__1	At once I put bills up in the windows ; for , I was in debt , and had scarcely any money , and began to be seriously alarmed by the state of my affairs .
__label__0	158 Natives of <NAME> .
__label__0	The settlers , having become potters , made nothing but pottery .
__label__0	She was evidently not without an object .
__label__0	“ Would you believe it that there is not a chart on board ? ” “ Is that so ? ” “ It is indeed .
__label__1	Affery opened it a very little , with a flaring candle in her hands and asked who was that , at that time of night , with that knock !
__label__1	The public-houses by the wayside , from being empty and noiseless as those in the remoter parts had been , now sent out boisterous shouts and clouds of smoke ; and , from the misty windows , clusters of broad red faces looked down upon the road .
__label__1	And suppose I said to that venerable earl , “ My Lord , I am here before your lordship , presented by your lordship ’ s near kinsman , my friend upon my left , to indicate that programme ; ” what would his lordship answer ?
__label__0	We will rather summarize the traveller 's report of the physical aspect of the country .
__label__1	The available space in it was not much larger than a hackney-coach ; but no one could have wished the bar bigger , that space was so girt in by corpulent little casks , and by cordial-bottles radiant with fictitious grapes in bunches , and by lemons in nets , and by biscuits in baskets , and by the polite beer-pulls that made low bows when customers were served with beer , and by the cheese in a snug corner , and by the landlady ’ s own small table in a snugger corner near the fire , with the cloth everlastingly laid .
__label__1	You 'll hardly believe what I am going to tell you .
__label__1	Their undisguised intimacy , and the character I now know <NAME> to bear , made that not at all adventurous .
__label__1	The murdered person was a woman , -- a woman a good ten years older , very much larger , and very much stronger .
__label__0	Never did a voyage begin more prosperously , or a passenger start in better spirits .
__label__1	‘ Do you remain long here ? ’ inquired Doctor Slammer of <NAME> , as they walked on most amicably together .
__label__1	It is well meant , I have no doubt , but I reject it .
__label__0	“ And you , <NAME> , ” resumed <NAME> enthusiastically , “ you will be still the governor of the island !
__label__1	A maid of honour of the court of Charles the <NAME> , with large round eyes ( and other charms to correspond ) , seems to bathe in glowing water , and it ripples as it glows .
__label__1	Up came the sun to find him washed and brushed , methodically dressed in decent black coat and waistcoat , decent formal black tie , and pepper-and-salt pantaloons , with his decent silver watch in its pocket , and its decent hair-guard round his neck : a scholastic huntsman clad for the field , with his fresh pack yelping and barking around him .
__label__0	“ <NAME> ? ” asked the chief of the police .
__label__0	Towards the west , a cloudy belt , clearly visible at the horizon , increased the gloom , and the eye could not discover if the sky and water were blended together in the same circular line .
__label__1	I do <NAME> forget , though I do not read it as he did .
__label__1	I was told by your guardian that you discontinued it under the shock that we have all felt so acutely .
__label__0	At eight o ’ clock , the summit of the <NAME> was lost in portentous darkness .
__label__0	`` Yes , he will come , but who will command ? ''
__label__1	said <NAME> , chafed into perfect defiance of his venerable friend by the current of his regrets ; `` cause it ca n't come out in the 'dictment ; 'cause nobody will never know half of what he was .
__label__1	I have no more. ’ ‘ May I hope to prove them all ? ’ said Mr Dombey , with solemn gallantry , laying down a drawing he had held , and motioning towards the harp .
__label__0	The three great regions form the sub-titles of the three books which compose the story .
__label__1	I wish the whole school was here .
__label__1	<NAME> , swift-responsive , appears , receives instructions whom to produce , skims away , produces the aforesaid , and departs .
__label__0	to crystallize this liquor , only an extremely easy operation is required .
__label__1	‘ I thought perhaps you wouldn ’ t mind , in this fine weather , coming home by water , <NAME> .
__label__1	asked <NAME> , in a low voice , of <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Not a word. ’ ‘ To him or anyone ? ’ pursued the Manager .
__label__0	“ What is the matter ? ” cried the captain , rushing on the bridge .
__label__1	‘ Was there ever such a -- !
__label__1	And how , until the present hour , when authorities mighty in the <NAME> and learned in the law declared their successful labours ended , they had confided in no other human being .
__label__1	Ever so fur as I went , ever so fur the mountains seemed to shift away from me .
__label__0	Never had any man , since the first creation of the human race experienced a similar emotion to that now felt by the great navigator .
__label__0	Certainly if <NAME> had any important matter to communicate to his master he could not employ a more sure or more rapid messenger , who could pass where neither the colonists could , nor even Top himself .
__label__1	He stood at a little distance from the door , with his face towards it ; and with the sleeves of his coat turned back at the wrists , was occupied in bestowing the most vigorous , scientific , and straightforward blows upon the empty air .
__label__1	Taking the furniture with them , of course ?
__label__0	`` Captain , '' said <NAME> , turning with a smile to M'Nicholl ; `` no use in trying to catch <NAME> ; slippery as an eel , he has an answer for everything .
__label__1	As the old lady had been so kind to him in his illness , he endeavoured to think no more of the subject just then ; so he listened attentively to a great many stories she told him , about an amiable and handsome daughter of hers , who was married to an amiable and handsome man , and lived in the country ; and about a son , who was clerk to a merchant in the <NAME> <NAME> ; and who was , also , such a good young man , and wrote such dutiful letters home four times a-year , that it brought the tears into her eyes to talk about them .
__label__0	He was received by the whole troop of his majesty ’ s wives , to the harmonious accords of the “ upatu , ” a sort of cymbal made of the bottom of a copper kettle , and to the uproar of the “ kilindo , ” a drum five feet high , hollowed out from the trunk of a tree , and hammered by the ponderous , horny fists of two jet-black virtuosi .
__label__0	The engineer , aided by his companions , including <NAME> , who was once more obliged to leave his boat , commenced the preliminary operations , the object of which was to rid the wool of that fat and oily substance with which it is impregnated , and which is called grease .
__label__0	“ We will take a little rest , and recruit our strength .
__label__0	There was no longer any illusion possible .
__label__1	The cook and housemaid screamed .
__label__1	‘ Come on then , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	Hence she had at last consented to play off against <NAME> a stricken market-gardner known to be ready with his offer on the smallest encouragement , and hence -- as this occasion had been specially assigned for the purpose -- that great anxiety on her part for <NAME> ’ s presence which had occasioned her to leave the note he has been seen to receive .
__label__1	More impracticable men and boys persist in walking into <NAME> 's sleep and terrifying him with unaccountable questions , so that often when the cock at the little dairy in <NAME> Street breaks out in his usual absurd way about the morning , <NAME> finds himself in a crisis of nightmare , with his little woman shaking him and saying `` What 's the matter with the man ! ''
__label__0	It had been so much talked of , even through the <NAME> cable , that jesters pretended that this slender fly had stopped a telegram on its passage and was making the most of it .
__label__1	How long have they taken these lodgings for ? ’ ‘ Only from week to week , ’ replied <NAME> .
__label__0	These ruffians , united by a secret bond , strangled victims of every age in honour of the goddess <NAME> , without ever shedding blood ; there was a period when this part of the country could scarcely be travelled over without corpses being found in every direction .
__label__0	Was it a confession of remorse which thus escaped from this man 's conscience ?
__label__1	When am I to get my money ready ?
__label__0	After seventeen days ' march they reached the <NAME> of <NAME> in <NAME> .
__label__1	Among the slain was a cow , and among the scattered articles unowned , a widow ’ s cap .
__label__1	Should I sleep at night in one of those wooden bins , with the other luggage , and wash myself at the pump in the yard in the morning ; or should I be turned out every night , and expected to come again to be left till called for , when the office opened next day ?
__label__0	In a mystery every one found himself upon the earth again .
__label__1	But he no more dreamed that <NAME> looked on <NAME> , as it were , from a new and far-off place ; that while his eyes often sought the lovely face , they seldom met its open glance of sisterly affection , but withdrew themselves when hers were raised towards him ; than he believed that it was <NAME> ’ s ghost who sat beside him .
__label__0	They wore no vestige of clothing ; their skin was black and their hair woolly ; and the partition of the nostrils had a sharp bone thrust through by way of ornament .
__label__0	Clearly , it needed a good strong imagination to find any human likeness in that flame .
__label__1	`` I believe it , my dear Charley .
__label__1	And I know I am so ; and I know she is overjoyed when she can bring it to my mind. ’ ‘ A good pretence ! ’ said <NAME> , with no less anger , haughtiness , and bitterness ; ‘ but too threadbare to cover what I plainly see in this .
__label__1	So he said , ‘ Florence , you may go and look at your pretty brother , if you like , I daresay .
__label__0	They were almost touching the surface of the sea !
__label__0	But <NAME> had reserved them for a strange destiny , and after having , on the 20th of March , escaped from <NAME> , besieged by the troops of <NAME> , they found themselves seven thousand miles from the capital of <NAME> , which was the principal stronghold of the <NAME> , during the terrible War of Secession .
__label__1	But , next day , he resumed the subject by saying in his off-hand manner and with a slighting laugh , ‘ Well , <NAME> , when shall we go to this Maecenas of yours ?
__label__1	has been an effective Something , in the way of preventing me from turning to at <NAME> .
__label__1	Squeers was jealous of the influence which his man had so soon acquired , and his family hated him , and <NAME> paid for both .
__label__1	No man spoke , but the steersman held up his hand , and all softly backed water , and kept the boat straight and true before it .
__label__1	He did it , whether or no .
__label__1	Mr Mortimer Lightwood and Mr <NAME> took a coffee-house dinner together in Mr Lightwood ’ s office .
__label__1	He said no more , and there was silence for some quarter of an hour until supper appeared .
__label__0	At all events , we shall get there some day . ''
__label__1	‘ N-not particularly so , I think , sir , ’ rejoined <NAME> , with his teeth chattering in his head .
__label__0	“ Well , <NAME> , what ’ s your report ? ” asked <NAME> .
__label__0	The extreme distance to which sound is carried when the temperature is low is an astonishing fact ; it is only equalled by the brilliancy of the constellations in the northern skies ; the waves of light and sound are transmitted to great distances , especially in the dry cold of the nights .
__label__0	<NAME> , therefore , prepared a magnificent repast -- the two little peccaries , kangaroo soup , a smoked ham , stone-pine almonds , <NAME> tea ; in fact , all the best that they had , but among all the dishes figured in the first rank the savory peccaries .
__label__1	No one , however , had been there .
__label__0	On their way <NAME> and <NAME> were careful to preserve the wire which had been laid down by the captain between the corral and the grotto , and which might at a future time be of service .
__label__1	‘ Can ’ t say. ’ ‘ Will it be long before <NAME> is disengaged , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Don ’ t know. ’ Here the man proceeded to mend his pen with great deliberation , while another clerk , who was mixing a <NAME> powder , under cover of the lid of his desk , laughed approvingly .
__label__0	Let her go ! ” said the young captain , working her to get away from the reefs .
__label__1	I don ’ t say she and I are alike -- I know there is a long , long way between us .
__label__0	Once when he landed , he had a slight skirmish with some of the inhabitants , who seemed to be very thinly scattered over the country .
__label__1	The poor side , you say ?
__label__0	These two vessels , the property of Messrs. Enderby , were fitted up for whale-fishing , and were in every respect well qualified for the long and arduous task before them , which , according to <NAME> 's instructions , was to combine discovery in the <NAME> seas with whaling .
__label__1	But what could I do ?
__label__1	Here <NAME> , seized with a fit of coughing in the midst of his triumph , breaks off to ejaculate , `` Oh , dear me !
__label__0	In 29deg 2 ’ south latitude , and 165deg 42 ’ east longitude , to the east of <NAME> , is found a little island , six miles in circumference , overlooked by <NAME> , which rises to a height of 1,100 feet above the level of the sea .
__label__0	At the second of these fêtes , on the first day of the year , the whole population , men and women alike , appeared dressed in white , following the tradition that white brings good fortune , and every one brought gifts to the king of great value .
__label__0	It is not for me to go to the bath ; the bath will come to me .
__label__0	Then <NAME> seemed to grow enormously , his features to assume superhuman proportions .
__label__1	But the <NAME> had somehow come to the knowledge that <NAME> kept a school .
__label__0	Singularly enough , all these transformations rest upon principles which were perfectly familiar to our remote ancestors , but which they disregarded .
__label__0	A whole hour at least would elapse before the hull of the brig could emerge from the water of the channel .
__label__1	‘ The question has been asked before , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ and the answer has been , No .
__label__1	But you said to-night that you would not be afraid of him , under any circumstances , and that gives me—who am so much afraid of him—courage to tell only you .
__label__0	M. de <NAME> had only seen this bay at high tide , and as soon as this new sight met his view his first idea was to regain the former watering-place .
__label__0	Neither spurts of vapor nor hot springs surround it , and the whole volcanic power of that region is concentrated in one sublime column .
__label__1	Through the rusted bars , tastes , rather than glimpses , were caught of the jumbled neighbourhood ; and nothing within range , nearer or lower than the summits of the two great towers of Notre-Dame , had any promise on it of healthy life or wholesome aspirations .
__label__1	I ’ m umbly anxious for his good. ’ I gave him no answer , and went upstairs into the quiet room where <NAME> had so often sat beside me at my books .
__label__0	These are the ordinary proportions . ''
__label__0	<NAME> had instructions to survey the neighbourhood of the <NAME> , where the <NAME> Government hoped to find a place suitable for the reception of the wretches then huddled together in their convict-prisons ; but the flag of <NAME> had just been unfurled on the shores of <NAME> and <NAME> , in King <NAME> 's <NAME> , <NAME> , the little Leschenault inlet , and on the <NAME> , so that there was no longer any reason for a new exploration .
__label__0	You are always harking back on that subject , like brave <NAME> . ''
__label__0	I am one of the agents of the <NAME> . ''
__label__0	Once in a while , the reflection of a wandering ray of light in the dull water disclosed a succession of ditches regularly arranged , and , by one last gleam , the eye could make out the calm and sombre forms of palm-trees , sycamores , and gigantic euphorbiae .
__label__0	In fact he had seen that <NAME> had said nothing about the document which formed the material proof of his innocence .
__label__1	`` <NAME> of <NAME> 's <NAME> .
__label__0	Then the three traveling companions , acted upon by some unaccountable influence above that of intoxication , inflamed by the air which had set their respiratory apparatus on fire , fell motionless to the bottom of the projectile .
__label__1	To begin with , <NAME> is the lady you had the parley with at what ’ s-his-name place. ’ ‘ Martigny , ’ interposed <NAME> with an air of infinite languor .
__label__0	With these words they returned to their companions .
__label__1	<NAME> is the dread power of the man , and so terribly evident it is that he makes no idle boast , that <NAME> begins to apologize .
__label__0	If the operation was effected , the terrestrial axis would be undoubtedly changed , and then the catastrophes foreseen would be accomplished in all their plenitude .
__label__0	The <NAME> , signalling danger , tacked about , but <NAME> , annoyed by this action , which was likely to affect the confidence of the crews , crowded sail on the <NAME> , and , by passing the <NAME> , showed his determination to maintain his southern course .
__label__0	<NAME> , a little contracted in territory , gave nevertheless 9,000 ducats , proving her love for scientific experiments .
__label__1	What is your love to mine ?
__label__0	“ <NAME> me , <NAME> , I say , ” repeated <NAME> .
__label__1	you should have rung the worker ’ s bell , ’ said the footman , touching the handle of one in the door-post .
__label__0	This fearful revelation took them like a stroke of apoplexy .
__label__1	He charged her with it in no measured terms ; and was so urgent with his daughter to go round to the <NAME> and entreat him to turn her out , that she was never reproduced after the first failure .
__label__1	You never run up and down stairs for me , all day long .
__label__0	Since we are being borne along in space we shall end by falling into some center of attraction or other . ''
__label__1	But it was generally said that <NAME> was a woman of system with children ; and no doubt she was .
__label__0	Then he murmured some phrases in an undertone which none in the solitude of the <NAME> forests could hear , and which no one , had he been anywhere else , would have heard .
__label__0	<NAME> 's four moons , for instance , though on an average actually 2-1/2 times farther from their planet 's centre than the <NAME> is from us , are comparatively four times nearer to him on account of his radius being eleven times greater than the <NAME> 's .
__label__0	`` Let us be off , '' replied <NAME> .
__label__1	He lies a little turned away , but his eyes are surely open .
__label__0	“ Must the poor man be left there ? ” “ He must , <NAME> , ” replied <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ I am sir , ’ replied the landlord .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> remained but a few minutes alone with <NAME> , and soon recalled his companions ; but he said nothing to them of the private matters which the dying man had confided to him .
__label__1	‘ He ’ ll be doing something desperate ; he ’ ll murder somebody .
__label__0	These ladies , I suppose , have never seen it .
__label__1	Not I , I hope ! ’ ‘ You hope , indeed !
__label__1	'He has brought me to this lonely place to murder me ! '
__label__1	The people who have been better off , and have paid rates for many years , are the first to sink when they come into the house ; and let me tell you , <NAME> , that three or four inches over one 's calculation makes a great hole in one 's profits : especially when one has a family to provide for , sir . '
__label__0	`` Let us trust in <NAME> , '' said the old sailor ; `` he is able to preserve us ! ''
__label__1	However , it ’ s soon set right .
__label__1	He receives these salutations with gravity and buries them along with the rest of his knowledge .
__label__1	He did each single thing , as if he did nothing else -- a pretty certain indication in a man of that range of ability and purpose , that he is doing something which sharpens and keeps alive his keenest powers .
__label__1	But , next come the <NAME> , and Mr Perch ; and Mr Perch brings <NAME> to talk it over in the kitchen , and to spend a pleasant evening .
__label__0	The roof is very high , the walls of the rooms are covered with gold and silver , and on this gold and silver are paintings of dragons , birds , horses , and other animals , so that nothing can be seen but gilding and pictures .
__label__1	He had that rather wild , strained , seared marking about the eyes , which may be observed in all free livers of his class , from the portrait of <NAME> downward , and which can be traced , under various disguises of <NAME> , through the portraits of every Drinking Age .
__label__1	‘ My opinion is -- no will. ’ It appeared a wonderful thing to me , but it turned out that there was no will .
__label__1	Her husband added with some exultation , ‘ But you may thank your fortunate stars -- the same stars that made you Mrs Quilp -- you may thank them that I ’ m upon the old gentleman ’ s track , and have got a new light .
__label__0	The ship will be built in the stocks of <NAME> & Co. , who will arrange everything with you .
__label__1	This is our sitting-room , -- just such chairs and tables and carpet and so forth , you see , as they could spare from home .
__label__1	Some of them had been in <NAME> but three days , some but three months , and some had gone out in the last voyage of that very ship in which they were now returning home .
__label__0	My uncle , who now was simply Professor Hardwigg , was so eager to advance , that he bolted his food like a greedy clown .
__label__0	Thus then , at the end of the seventeenth century , a great part of the new world was known .
__label__1	Mr <NAME> came and sat down on the other side of her , and she felt the fraternal railing come behind her , and apparently stretch on to include <NAME> .
__label__0	An <NAME> criminal , you know , is always better concealed in <NAME> than anywhere else . ''
__label__0	Before three in the morning they arrived at the corral .
__label__1	' I hope the gentleman will understand that it is n't my fault , sir ? '
__label__0	but at the bottom of the valleys , and not exceeding a few hundred feet in height . ''
__label__0	Still the weather grew colder , and in these high latitudes even <NAME> felt the influence of the approaching winter .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> draws near and examines the directions .
__label__1	With the view of seeing if this were so , and , in any case , of bidding him good night , if he were yet sitting among his books , I turned back , and going softly across the hall , and gently opening the door , looked in .
__label__1	Not in the least likely .
__label__1	Notwithstanding an unusual flow of company , the master of the wine-shop was not visible .
__label__1	In taking me to him my guardian told me this , and also explained how it was that he had come to think of me .
__label__1	What is it , <NAME> ? ” “ <NAME> , ” said I , taking hold of his rolled-up shirt sleeve , and twisting it between my finger and thumb , “ you remember all that about <NAME> 's ? ” “ Remember ? ” said <NAME> .
__label__0	`` Friend <NAME> , this is my answer .
__label__1	It is very doubtful whether <NAME> knows how to laugh .
__label__0	He passed <NAME> and <NAME> ' Land of the <NAME> , where he easily recognized <NAME> and <NAME> Philip Bays , and left this archipelago after having named it <NAME> , by which appellation it is now known .
__label__1	What have paupers to do with soul or spirit ?
__label__0	He was ordered not to open the sealed packet until three years should have expired , when <NAME> would have completed the term of his mission .
__label__1	The stranger did not recognize me , but I recognized him as the gentleman I had met on the stairs , on the occasion of my second visit to <NAME> .
__label__1	The miserable shop of the wood-sawyer was so small , that its whole surface furnished very indifferent space for this legend .
__label__0	The request having been granted , <NAME> , with the nine soldiers , all punctiliously wearing the regimental tunic of scarlet and trousers of invisible green , presented themselves at the door of the colonel ’ s room , where he and his brother-officer were continuing their game .
__label__1	“ I might as well ask you , ” said <NAME> , “ how you manage ? ” “ No ; because when I come in from the forge of a night , any one can see me turning to at it .
__label__0	I was , I think , occupied in collecting my plants , when I heard a noise like an avalanche falling from a very tall tree .
__label__1	Under cover of the night , the feeble-minded beadle comes flitting about <NAME> with his summonses , in which every juror 's name is wrongly spelt , and nothing rightly spelt but the beadle 's own name , which nobody can read or wants to know .
__label__1	She may be dead ! ’ The vaunting cruelty with which she met my glance , I never saw expressed in any other face that ever I have seen .
__label__1	During the bustle of preparation at the railway , Mr Dombey and the <NAME> walked up and down the platform side by side ; the former taciturn and gloomy , and the latter entertaining him , or entertaining himself , with a variety of anecdotes and reminiscences , in most of which <NAME> was the principal performer .
__label__1	They are gone , and I resume the journey of my story .
__label__1	Perhaps her admiration , such as it was , had originated long ago , when she first found anything that was beautiful appearing in the midst of the squalid fight of her existence .
__label__0	His works do not , however , bear upon geography or political economy , but treat only of inscriptions , coins , manuscripts , and literature -- in a word , of everything connected with the intellectual and material history of the country .
__label__0	The way in which his advance was received the good orderly never divulged , but henceforward he maintained the firm conviction that there was something very much amiss up in the sky .
__label__1	' I 'll answer for that boy 's truth with my life ! '
__label__1	asked <NAME> , coaxing him , with her arms round his neck .
__label__0	The natives carried off their wounded , leaving thirty or forty dead upon the field of battle .
__label__1	<NAME> Leicester receives the gout as a troublesome demon , but still a demon of the patrician order .
__label__1	‘ And I am so grateful to you for it , <NAME> , so bound to you , that there is no name for the affection of my heart .
__label__1	And he never did well in the streets , he never did well out of sight .
__label__1	'In that way of business , ' rejoined <NAME> ; 'and so are the people of the house .
__label__1	Besides , it would never do for a man who had been aboard ship from his boyhood to turn luxurious all at once .
__label__0	`` Everything , <NAME> , '' answered Harding , `` and we have no means of preventing them . ''
__label__1	Thinks it long enough for <NAME> .
__label__0	It was not much , but it was very refreshing for a crew accustomed to little but salt meat .
__label__1	But ever while he laughs , he glances over his paralytic shoulder at <NAME> and eagerly watches him as he unlocks the padlock of a homely cupboard at the distant end of the gallery , looks here and there upon the higher shelves , and ultimately takes something out with a rustling of paper , folds it , and puts it in his breast .
__label__0	“ We have neither <NAME> bark , nor sulphate of quinine. ” “ No , ” said <NAME> , “ but there are willows on the border of the lake , and the bark of the willow might , perhaps , prove to be a substitute for quinine. ” “ Let us try it without losing a moment , ” replied <NAME> .
__label__0	At a sign from the chief of the police <NAME> and <NAME> were taken away .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> could not but welcome such a guest , and shook hands cordially .
__label__1	He came near me no more ; but devoted himself to an old gentleman in long gaiters , to meet whom a pint of special port seemed to come out of the cellar of its own accord , for he gave no order .
__label__0	The colonists were now half way between <NAME> and the corral , having still two miles and a half to go .
__label__1	Beadles are but men : and <NAME> smiled .
__label__1	‘ Did I look well in snuff-colour ?
__label__1	He took her home , and stayed till she was recovered ; and , having no money to pay the coach , went back in state to <NAME> , bidding the driver ( for it was Saturday night ) wait at the door while he went in for ‘ change. ’ ‘ Mr <NAME> , sir , ’ said <NAME> cheerfully , ‘ Good evening ! ’ Monstrous as <NAME> ’ s tale had appeared , at first , Mr <NAME> did , that night , half suspect his affable employer of some deep villany .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> had taken his sister from a convent , while there was yet time to ward off the impending veil , the cheapest garment she could wear , and had bestowed her as a prize upon a very rich Farmer-General , poor in family .
__label__0	His height diminished with the fantastic swiftness of objects rising in the air .
__label__1	Do n't think me hard with you , my dear , but as soon as ever you feel equal to it , get your shoes on and be ready . ''
__label__0	This continuous shower accounted for the swamps and marshes that formed the sole surface of the country .
__label__1	Would you use a carpet having a representation of flowers upon it ? ’ There being a general conviction by this time that ‘ No , sir ! ’ was always the right answer to this gentleman , the chorus of <NAME> was very strong .
__label__1	“ My dear doctor , ” said I to <NAME> , in this very room , the very last time he came .
__label__1	From what we have said of this young gentleman , and the natural admiration the reader will immediately conceive of his character , it may perhaps be inferred that he is to be the hero of the work which we shall presently begin .
__label__1	This is an unseasonable hour , but here is a young woman who has been making statements which render my visit necessary .
__label__0	They then presented the new comers with pieces of dried wood which they had lighted ; and appeared to invite them to set fire to the pile .
__label__0	Whoever it was , the only thing practicable was to do as the engineer proposed , to go to the <NAME> and there wait for day .
__label__1	Set me free ! ’ ‘ <NAME> ? ’ he repeated , ‘ Mrs Dombey ? ’ ‘ Tell him , ’ said <NAME> , addressing her proud face to <NAME> , ‘ that I wish for a separation between us , That there had better be one .
__label__1	‘ “ Quit the room , or you are a dead man , ” said the ill-looking fellow with the large sword , drawing it at the same time and flourishing it in the air .
__label__0	<NAME> exaggerated the exploits of these pirates , which however presented something of the marvellous .
__label__0	From time immemorial <NAME> had never come out except at meal times , and when he went to regulate the different clocks of the town .
__label__0	They may be divided into three parts .
__label__0	It was Boy who finally achieved the rescue of the <NAME> , for he consented to pay to Obie the ransom he demanded for them and their people .
__label__0	“ As I have said already , ” resumed the learned geographer , “ after having crossed <NAME> , the 37th degree of latitude cuts the islands of <NAME> d ’ Acunha .
__label__0	But after some few miles of tract the nature of the soil gradually changes and the country shows itself worthy of the name .
__label__0	<NAME> had no trouble in finding a tree suitable for the mast .
__label__0	The steam hissed and puffed out , the screw began to stir the waves , and by eight o ’ clock the last peaks of <NAME> disappeared in the shadows of the night .
__label__0	Certainly , if any thing could have surprised him , this <NAME> would , for he had never seen the stranger in his life before .
__label__1	As he turned the key in the lock , he surveyed me with some astonishment which was not diminished when he looked from me to my companion .
__label__1	It ’ s gone on in the other wans to the assembly-rooms , and there it ’ ll be exhibited the day after to-morrow .
__label__0	His brother <NAME> , who had acted as his secretary , published a brief narrative of the journey , containing several curious details respecting the antiquities of <NAME> , which have been , however , largely supplemented by works brought out by Englishmen .
__label__1	'Bless her , she 's going off ! '
__label__0	This enormous hole was beyond all measurement , and formed a gloomy abyss , the bottom of which the sun 's rays could never reach .
__label__1	What answer do you make ? ’ ‘ Sir , ’ he rejoined , with an occasional separation and reunion of those delicate tips , ‘ my answer must be qualified ; because , to betray <NAME> ’ s confidence to his mother , and to betray it to you , are two different actions .
__label__1	I ’ m an old man to begin. ’ Pushing up his spectacles again ( for they were useless any longer to conceal his emotion ) , he covered his face with his hand , and sobbed aloud , and his tears fell down upon his coffee-coloured waistcoat .
__label__0	The cocoa-nuts from which it received its name were procured with difficulty .
__label__0	`` What do you intend to do ? ''
__label__0	cried the sailor , `` this is queer ! ''
__label__0	My notion was that , as he either could not or dared not wind up so extraordinary a work of imagination , <NAME> had given it to be understood that he had not received the last three chapters from <NAME> , whose life had ended under sudden and deplorable circumstances which <NAME> did not make known .
__label__0	On the 8th January anchor was finally weighed , and the second entrance to the strait was slowly navigated against the tide .
__label__0	A fine white ash-dust began to fall , and this increased the terror of Nu-Nu , whose lips trembled over his two rows of black ivory .
__label__0	<NAME> got up under our feet like birds in the long grass .
__label__0	The traveller at once fell ill and became so weak that it was impossible for him to resort to a country place .
__label__1	‘ Not in the least , ’ replied <NAME> ; ‘ I like it very much , although I am no smoker myself. ’ ‘ I should be very sorry to say I wasn ’ t , ’ interposed another gentleman on the opposite side of the table .
__label__1	What a girl you are ! ’ ‘ The child ’ s father is employed by the house that employs me ; that ’ s how I came to know it , <NAME> .
__label__1	And is your brother acquainted with all this , my dear ? ’ ‘ Oh , no , no , ’ replied <NAME> , changing colour .
__label__0	<NAME> , who did not forget to clear his vision and his memory by an occasional application to his demijohn , maneuvered very ably when passing through this archipelago .
__label__0	`` I am afraid the <NAME> will force me to violent measures , '' said <NAME> , upon learning what had passed .
__label__1	It was like asking , as a favour , to be sentenced to transportation from <NAME> .
__label__1	It did not , however , so continue .
__label__1	Outer doors of chambers are shut up by the score , messages and parcels are to be left at the <NAME> 's Lodge by the bushel .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , not that , ever ! ’ More surprised than before , and a little more frightened , she looked to him for an explanation of his last words .
__label__0	They have no doctors , but only enchanters , who jump , dance , and play musical instruments around the invalid 's bed till he either dies or recovers .
__label__1	Therefore , on the removal of the cloth , the <NAME> developed himself as a choice spirit in the broader and more comprehensive range of narrating regimental stories , and cracking regimental jokes , which he did with such prodigal exuberance , that <NAME> was ( or feigned to be ) quite exhausted with laughter and admiration : while Mr <NAME> looked on over his starched cravat , like the <NAME> ’ s proprietor , or like a stately showman who was glad to see his bear dancing well .
__label__0	<NAME> was discovered -- no human being emerged from the opening .
__label__1	<NAME> did not see that ; but felt it incumbent on her to continue talking .
__label__0	The sickness that had afflicted him for so many years was simply perpetual drunkenness .
__label__1	He made no mention of the way in which he had employed himself ; merely informing <NAME> that a letter addressed to him under his assumed name at the <NAME> Office , <NAME> , would readily find him , and entreating that worthy friend to write full particulars of the situation of his mother and sister , and an account of all the grand things that <NAME> had done for them since his departure from <NAME> .
__label__0	But you know that in my hunter ’ s way I can just as easily skin and cut up a piece of game as kill it. ” “ I ’ m sure of that , <NAME> .
__label__0	The air was full of the noise of avalanches falling from the hills to the bottom of the ravines , and the cracking of the ice-field produced a deafening sound .
__label__1	All ’ s over. ’ Therefore , the police sent for something to cover it , and it was covered and borne through the streets , the people falling away .
__label__1	But I can go and earn some more , when I like ; ca n't I , <NAME> ? '
__label__1	<NAME> , with her brother 's wink , shakes her head and purses up her mouth into no without saying it .
__label__1	`` Really , <NAME> , '' returns the lawyer , `` I state the fact .
__label__0	All was completely arranged by the 12th of February .
__label__1	‘ And as a matter of form , which will be agreeable to your own feelings , before we go out ( for I ’ ll walk with you part of the way , though my leg gives under me with weariness ) , let ’ s have a look at the stock in trade. ’ Mr <NAME> produced it , and it was perfectly correct ; Mr Venus undertook to produce it again in the morning , and to keep tryst with Mr Wegg on <NAME> ’ s doorstep as the clock struck ten .
__label__0	<NAME> seizing the telescope which the sailor had put down , put it to his eye , and in a hoarse voice , -- “ The black flag ! ” he exclaimed .
__label__1	He had a great admiration for bright eyes , and sweet faces , and pretty legs and feet ; in short , he was fond of the whole sex .
__label__1	The sick man laid his hand upon his attendant ’ s arm , and motioned him to stop .
__label__1	That did not extend to me , she told me in a gush of love and confidence ( at that time , I had known her something less than five minutes ) ; if they were all like <NAME> , it would be quite another thing .
__label__1	All its disputes , all its ill-will and bad blood , rise up before you .
__label__0	His eyes were fixed on the top of the volcano .
__label__1	Indeed , the quarrel , from slight beginnings , rose to a considerable height , and was assuming a very violent complexion , when both parties , falling into a great passion of tears , exclaimed simultaneously , that they had never thought of being spoken to in that way : which exclamation , leading to a remonstrance , gradually brought on an explanation : and the upshot was , that they fell into each other ’ s arms and vowed eternal friendship ; the occasion in question making the fifty-second time of repeating the same impressive ceremony within a twelvemonth .
__label__1	‘ I have stood before him face to face , and he crushed me down in the dirt of his contempt , and walked over me .
__label__1	“ Have you heerd nought ? ” “ <NAME> , ” says I , “ I heerd street-door shut , no time at a ’ ago .
__label__0	The diver answered with his hand , mounted immediately to the surface of the water , and did not appear again .
__label__0	“ You will get used to the outer world , and most likely forget all about our dark coal pit. ” “ No , <NAME> , never ! ” said <NAME> , and she put her hand over her eyes , as though she would recall the remembrance of everything she had lately quitted .
__label__1	But I could make nothing of the word .
__label__1	“ 'You know , <NAME> , that it is among the <NAME> of these Nobles to harness us common dogs to carts , and drive us .
__label__0	This token was a grey and yellow garment worn and patched , an ill-omened rag thrown down at the foot of a tree .
__label__0	This dugong , which also bears the name of the halicore , closely resembles the manatee ; its oblong body terminated in a lengthened tail , and its lateral fins in perfect fingers .
__label__1	'So do I , ' cried <NAME> .
__label__1	After dinner , her son took his turn ; and when <NAME> , himself , and I were left alone together , leered at me , and writhed until I could hardly bear it .
__label__1	At least I -- I should think he was. ’ ‘ Georgiana , darling ! ’ said <NAME> , holding up a forefinger , ‘ Take care ! ’ ‘ Oh my goodness me ! ’ exclaimed <NAME> , reddening .
__label__1	For , coming along I had thought well of what I was going to say .
__label__1	He was taken ill in the night -- quite prostrate he was -- in consequence of <NAME> ; and after being drugged with black draughts and blue pills , to an extent which <NAME> ( whose father was a doctor ) said was enough to undermine a horse ’ s constitution , received a caning and six chapters of <NAME> Testament for refusing to confess .
__label__0	This tablet bore the following inscription : -- Who have suffered and perished in the cause of science and the service of their country .
__label__0	Having finished their repast , my two companions laid themselves down upon their rugs , and found in sleep a remedy for their fatigue and sufferings .
__label__1	He observed the look and said , ‘ To my mother , of course .
__label__0	After due reflection and discussion , <NAME> had nearly decided to follow the coast road to <NAME> , when <NAME> made an unexpected proposition .
__label__0	And that one was <NAME> , who was quietly sipping a cup of hot coffee as if he and the old world would last for ever .
__label__1	A crazy old staircase I found it to be , feebly lighted on each landing by a club-headed little oil wick , dying away in a little dungeon of dirty glass .
__label__0	`` And thou art right , <NAME> .
__label__1	In the atmosphere of vague anxiety and dread that lowered about them in connexion with their fugitive brother , this sound , unusual there , became almost alarming .
__label__1	It was odd enough to see the change that came over <NAME> as <NAME> proceeded .
__label__1	It ’ s a part of my character to be waited on ! ’ He half filled the tumbler as he said it , and drank off the contents when he had done saying it .
__label__1	He ain ’ t a father to neither .
__label__0	He went on without stopping , feeling no fatigue , obeying a potent instinct which allowed no room for thought .
__label__1	Every word. ” <NAME> bent forward to look at me more nearly , as if my reply had been rather more hurried or more eager than he could quite account for .
__label__0	At ten paces not an object was visible .
__label__0	It is divided from the mainland of Te-Wahi-Punamub [ 1 ] by the <NAME> .
__label__1	I am in statu quo. ’ ‘ And Mrs. Micawber ? ’ I pursued .
__label__1	But the figure that he seeks is not among them .
__label__1	He was going to say `` to a shade , '' but substituted this , as more appropriate .
__label__0	The two were in incessant communication .
__label__1	But by obliging me to employ a boy , <NAME> has embarrassed me to that extent , overwhelmed as I am with public business , that I do n't know which way to turn .
__label__0	It was on the 20th of December that all the arrangements at the corral were completed .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> would not lose a single point of view , nor a single detail of the straits .
__label__1	I say , ‘ Come in ! ’ but someone taps again .
__label__0	The captain had only to pick his men .
__label__1	At the time when , to have been a tumbler in the mud of the streets , would have been a godsend to me , a prize in the lottery to me , you were at the <NAME> Opera .
__label__1	The old woman ’ s face was shrewdly anxious and expectant ; that of her daughter was expectant too , but in a less sharp degree , and sometimes it darkened , as if with gathering disappointment and incredulity .
__label__1	still going on ; but where !
__label__1	'Give me a shawl here .
__label__1	<NAME> , your father 's daughter ! ” “ I thought , my father , ” said <NAME> , excusing herself , with a pale face and in a faltering voice , “ that I heard strange feet upon the stairs. ” “ My love , the staircase is as still as Death. ” As he said the word , a blow was struck upon the door .
__label__1	The young gentlemen oozed away , semi-annually , to their own homes ; but they never broke up .
__label__1	‘ Friend of yours , sir ? ’ ‘ Not exactly a friend , ’ replied <NAME> , in a low tone .
__label__1	Mrs <NAME> crossed the hall , feeling its pavement cold to her stockingless feet , and peeped in between the rusty hinges on the door , which stood a little open .
__label__0	At first only noisy and very lively , the natives soon became threatening .
__label__0	It is a reservoir of about 135 feet square , built of brick , and in the centre is a pretty temple dedicated to <NAME> .
__label__1	Could I not have asked her any day ? ’ ‘ Then you don ’ t care to know ? ’ ‘ I do not. ’ Mr Flintwinch , having expelled a long significant breath said , with his former emphasis , ‘ For I have accidentally -- mind ! -- found out. ’ ‘ Wherever she lives , ’ said <NAME> , speaking in one unmodulated hard voice , and separating her words as distinctly as if she were reading them off from separate bits of metal that she took up one by one , ‘ she has made a secret of it , and she shall always keep her secret from me. ’ ‘ After all , perhaps you would rather not have known the fact , any how ? ’ said <NAME> ; and he said it with a twist , as if his words had come out of him in his own wry shape .
__label__1	said <NAME> , anxiously bringing a chair towards my table .
__label__1	Finding her still very restless on this head , they made him up a bed in an inner room , to which he presently retired .
__label__0	The khan has established a mint here for the benefit of trade , and it is an inexhaustible source of revenue to him .
__label__1	We merely know that after a short pause <NAME> said , ‘ Lor , do adun , <NAME> ! ’ and that his hat had fallen off a few moments before -- from both of which tokens we should be disposed to infer that one kiss , or more , had passed between the parties .
__label__1	In so vast a country , where there are thousands of millions of acres of land yet unsettled and uncleared , and on every rood of which , vegetable decomposition is annually taking place ; where there are so many great rivers , and such opposite varieties of climate ; there can not fail to be a great amount of sickness at certain seasons .
__label__0	It ran about here , there , and everywhere , it clambered up one of the bulwarks of the raft , it leaped upon the sack of provisions , and then finally descended lightly , fell like a football and landed on our powder barrel .
__label__1	`` Yes , <NAME> , '' said he with a gentle seriousness , `` it is to be forgotten now , to be forgotten for a while .
__label__1	What childhood did you ever leave to me ?
__label__0	The traveller then gained an island at a little distance from the shore , from which he saw several whales gambolling in the water .
__label__0	But in the void through which the Projectile was now floating , no fluid whatever interposed between the eye of the observer and the object observed .
__label__0	It was the voice of <NAME> shouting : `` Look out there !
__label__1	If the mistress put such a construction upon the behaviour of her new friends , what could the companion urge against them ?
__label__1	I appeal to you , sir , ’ proceeded <NAME> with increasing spirit , ‘ not to pursue me .
__label__0	Why , the heat of his stomach will melt the ice , and the bone , springing straight , will pierce him with its sharp points. ” “ Well !
__label__1	I was very much afraid of him again , now that he had worked himself into this fierce hurry , and I was likewise very much afraid of keeping away from home any longer .
__label__1	If I could be dyed black , and made <NAME> ’ s slave , I should consider it a compliment .
__label__0	Next day , <NAME> reconnoitred what appeared to him to be the extreme south of <NAME> , and called it <NAME> .
__label__0	And all dressing in haste rushed to the windows , which they opened .
__label__0	What is the good ? ” he would say , and refused to leave his black domain .
__label__1	‘ I fear I must , ’ said <NAME> , with heroic firmness .
__label__1	This he had several times hinted at the club : in connexion with little jocularities , of which old <NAME> , old <NAME> , old J. Bagstock , old <NAME> , or so forth , was the perpetual theme : it being , as it were , the <NAME> ’ s stronghold and donjon-keep of light humour , to be on the most familiar terms with his own name .
__label__1	Consequently , I was not prepared , at seven o ’ clock next morning , to receive the following communication , dated half past nine in the evening ; a quarter of an hour after I had left him : -- ‘ The die is cast -- all is over .
__label__0	<NAME> was neither surprised nor vexed at the reply ; indeed , his object in asking was rather to establish the fact that <NAME> had not been there than that he had .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> ’ s hollow down by the flare is not there now .
__label__0	For the present he tried to console himself with the hope that the deviation of the Projectile would be followed by no worse consequence than carrying them towards the northern border of the <NAME> , where for several reasons it would be comparatively easier to alight .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> had risen from his seat , and taken two steps with his eyes shut , to accompany his description with appropriate action , when he started violently , in common with the rest of the company , and hurried back to his chair .
__label__1	‘ I say , ’ whispered <NAME> to <NAME> , as the man let down the steps , ‘ they don ’ t suppose we ’ re going to kill game enough to fill those bags , do they ? ’ ‘ Fill them ! ’ exclaimed old <NAME> .
__label__0	Incisions are made into the alburnum of the seringueiras ; below the wound small pots are attached , which twenty-four hours suffice to fill with a milky sap .
__label__1	after it was given out so ‘ tickerlerly , that <NAME> wasn ’ t to be made free with ! ’ exclaimed <NAME> .
__label__1	How can one expect she should , when she is so very unlike a <NAME> ? ’ Miss Tox looked as if she saw no way out of such a cogent argument as that , at all .
__label__1	He seemed to feel that as long as <NAME> could make no discovery without his knowledge , he was so far safe .
__label__1	‘ You see , my love , she ’ s already quite contented and comfortable , and means to say goodbye to her sister <NAME> and her little pets , and her good honest husband , with a light heart and a smile ; don ’ t she , my dear ? ’ ‘ Oh yes ! ’ cried <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ There is no longer any occasion for uneasiness , ma ’ am .
__label__0	Do not make us lose it , my friend . ''
__label__1	In all the rooms , the mouldering shutters were fast closed : the bars which held them were screwed tight into the wood ; the only light which was admitted , stealing its way through round holes at the top : which made the rooms more gloomy , and filled them with strange shadows .
__label__1	At length , when the lark came headlong down , with an accumulating stream of song , and dropped among the green wheat near him , rippling in the breath of the morning like a river , he sprang up from his reverie , and looked round with a sudden smile , as courteous and as soft as if he had had numerous observers to propitiate ; nor did he relapse , after being thus awakened ; but clearing his face , like one who bethought himself that it might otherwise wrinkle and tell tales , went smiling on , as if for practice .
__label__0	<NAME> ran forward , seized the paper , and read : -- `` Altam ... , <NAME> , December 13 , 1860 , longitude 12..° , latitude `` The <NAME> ? ''
__label__1	you know ! ’ The <NAME> , with responsive gravity and mystery , immediately waved his hook towards the little parlour , whither Mr <NAME> followed him .
__label__0	I don ’ t know a better fashion of traveling than in a mountebank ’ s caravan -- a movable house , which goes or stops wherever you please .
__label__0	It is doomed to more or less speedy destruction , the cause of which it bears within itself , and from which nothing can save it. ” The colonists looked at each other , then at the engineer .
__label__1	If they had known about us , you might have felt yourself called upon to conciliate them .
__label__1	If the <NAME> proposed to new skylight the market-place , the <NAME> got up public meetings , and denounced the proceeding ; if the <NAME> proposed the erection of an additional pump in the <NAME> , the <NAME> rose as one man and stood aghast at the enormity .
__label__0	`` Well then , talking <NAME> , '' replied <NAME> with a smile , `` the mean distance of the Moon from the Earth being sixty terrestrial radii , the length of the conic shadow , in consequence of atmospheric refraction , is reduced to less than forty-two radii .
__label__1	‘ The younger brother had been a traveller in many countries , and had made his pilgrimage through life alone .
__label__0	See , they ’ ve sent us a nice little southeast breeze , that will put us on the right track again. ” In fact , the <NAME> was resuming a more northerly route , and on the morning of the 20th she was passing over an inextricable network of channels , torrents , and streams , in fine , the whole complicated tangle of the <NAME> ’ s tributaries .
__label__0	I must say she has arrived very opportunely. ” “ Our boat ? ” murmured the engineer .
__label__1	He was a miserable wretch , but her word was more than a law for him .
__label__0	After a careful examination of <NAME> , <NAME> , who had good reason to fear the <NAME> , paid a visit by night to <NAME> , and looked down on the waters of the <NAME> .
__label__0	The <NAME> troops , who were descending the <NAME> , received every day fresh reinforcements , and , what was more serious , they were led by an officer , a traitor to his country , but a man of much note , and of an audacity equal to any emergency .
__label__0	Your pay will continue as before .
__label__1	‘ He ’ ll do , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ though it ain ’ t what I call him. ’ The servant inquired if they had any appointment ?
__label__0	And , instantly , opening the upper valve , he let some hydrogen escape , and slowly descended , taking the ground at about two hundred feet from the edge of the oasis .
__label__1	So immensely absurd ! ’ It fell to his lot , now , to stipulate for secrecy .
__label__1	There was my brother , as I read in chance <NAME> papers now and then , rising to be prosperous and famous .
__label__0	Though there was sufficient depth of water to allow a light craft to pass the bar , there was not enough for the <NAME> , whose draught of water was considerable .
__label__1	And I intend always doing it. ’ ‘ You are a long-headed fellow , Fledgeby. ’ ‘ May be , or may not be .
__label__1	The representatives of the <NAME> dropped in next , and Mr Merdle ’ s physician dropped in next .
__label__1	<NAME> , my dear , arrange with <NAME> about money , and let her have it when and how she pleases .
__label__0	But at this time , during a storm , the flagship became separated from the fleet , and although search was made several times , no tidings of her were obtained .
__label__0	The greatest men have travelled as we are doing .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> , much stiffened as to his cravat , and sobered down as to his spirits , was at home for the holidays , and appeared to feel himself aggrieved by the solicitude of his excellent mother that he should be attentive to <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> tacked in and out along the <NAME> coast ; he saw the two mountains -- <NAME> and <NAME> ; he explored a harbour to which he gave the name of <NAME> del Principe , and an archipelago which he called the <NAME> of <NAME> .
__label__1	It may not be the same . '
__label__0	All regarded him with profound emotion .
__label__1	You know your aunt ? ’ ‘ A little , ’ I replied .
__label__1	Mrs. <NAME> was unanimously voted into the chair , and Mrs. Rogers being stationed on her right hand , and Mrs. Raddle on her left , the meal proceeded with great merriment and success .
__label__0	When , therefore , the <NAME> government decided , in 1823 , to send reinforcements to Kamtchatka to put an end to the contraband trade carried on in <NAME> , the command of the expedition was given to <NAME> .
__label__1	I felt then , more than ever , that she was my better <NAME> ; and if I thought of her sweet face and placid smile , as though they had shone on me from some removed being , like an <NAME> , I hope I thought no harm .
__label__1	‘ She was off somewhere at daybreak this morning .
__label__0	<NAME> gave it the name of the `` little sun , '' to show that he understood the explanation .
__label__1	As <NAME> blows his nose and coughs his cough of sympathy , a step is heard without .
__label__1	This is by no means a disparagement to his character ; for many official personages , who are held in high respect and admiration , are the victims of similar infirmities .
__label__0	They all recognized <NAME> by those words .
__label__0	<NAME> evening , <NAME> had his turn of delirium .
__label__1	I observe it , because I can ’ t help observing it , being accustomed to take a powerful sight of notice ; but I don ’ t object .
__label__1	And <NAME> , the audacious creature who presumed , even in the dimmest and remotest distance of her imagination , to conjure up the degrading picture , ‘ I am a ’ most inclined , ’ said <NAME> , bursting with the fulness of her anger and the weakness of her means of revenge , ‘ to turn atheist when I think of it ! ’ But instead of adopting this course of retaliation , <NAME> , on second thoughts , brought out the suspicious bottle , and ordering glasses to be set forth upon her favourite drum , and sinking into a chair behind it , called her satellites about her , and to them several times recounted , word for word , the affronts she had received .
__label__1	‘ I think I remember having had a few interviews like that , with ladies out of doors .
__label__1	We have to think of the <NAME> more than ourselves. ” “ _I_ know , <NAME> know , ” rejoined <NAME> , carelessly .
__label__1	Sounds of recognition and greeting pass between the <NAME> and somebody else , at the stair-foot .
__label__1	Six quiet years ( I find I am saying it for the second time ) I had passed at <NAME> , seeing in those around me , as it might be in a looking-glass , every stage of my own growth and change there , when , one November morning , I received this letter .
__label__1	The vendor observing this , increased in loquacity .
__label__1	Then , I considered , when I had got safe back again , this was a nice thing to have done !
__label__1	`` -- Even in them I am shocked , for the credit of <NAME> , to be constrained to inform you that the party has not triumphed without being put to an enormous expense .
__label__0	<NAME> for <NAME> ! ” At this moment the ascensional force of the balloon increased prodigiously , and <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , waved a last good-by to their friends .
__label__0	`` They have arrived , lieutenant , '' exclaimed a young midshipman , `` and they are doing what all travelers do when they arrive in a new country , taking a walk ! ''
__label__1	These are not business manners , sir , nor business looks , but she carries me out of myself. ’ ‘ Why don ’ t you leave him alone ? ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	Had an iron bar on her right leg. ’ ‘ Ran away , the negro <NAME> .
__label__1	I never speak to him at such an hour .
__label__0	<NAME> and creepers were uninjured , and they had even to cut them away with the axe , as they had done in the deepest recesses of the forest .
__label__1	Not much in that , is there ?
__label__0	`` It is necessary to carry a notice there to point out the position of our island and say that <NAME> is here in case the <NAME> yacht should come to take him off .
__label__0	`` Let us look for it , '' replied <NAME> .
__label__0	`` Yes , sir ; it shall go to the pole . ''
__label__1	I have reflected that if I should wear out , he will be able to watch that judgment .
__label__1	And this had passed into such a habit with him , that , if he could not be correctly said to have his tongue at his fingers ’ ends , he might certainly be said to have it anywhere but in his face : which being , as we have already seen , of a harsh and repulsive character , was not oiled so easily , but frowned above all the smooth speeches -- one of nature ’ s beacons , warning off those who navigated the shoals and breakers of the World , or of that dangerous strait the <NAME> , and admonishing them to seek less treacherous harbours and try their fortune elsewhere .
__label__0	urged <NAME> , who was much disturbed by the servant 's disappearance .
__label__0	<NAME> offered no farther opposition ; it would always be in his power to put in his word when the stances should be more propitious .
__label__0	As things stood with the <NAME> , and even admitting that she could be floated again , an accident would have rendered her return impossible before the winter set in .
__label__1	The exchange is made , however , and then the passenger who has given up his seat makes a third upon the box , seating himself in what he calls the middle ; that is , with half his person on my legs , and the other half on the driver ’ s .
__label__0	Nevertheless , <NAME> and his companions , being anxious to finish it , and , it must be said , very much confused at being thus imprisoned by the beasts , were about to try a direct attack , when the captain thought of a new means of defence .
__label__1	Still , nobody appeared , to claim the dusty youngster from <NAME> , <NAME> .
__label__0	Not to mention rumours which agitated the maritime population and excited the public mind , even in the interior of continents , seafaring men were particularly excited .
__label__0	The remains of <NAME> were at first laid in the monastery of <NAME> ; in 1513 , they were removed to the <NAME> monastery of <NAME> .
__label__1	A constable , sir , if you please ! ’ <NAME> stood as one entranced , with his eyes opened wide and fixed upon the ground , regardless alike of the tremulous hold which Mr <NAME> maintained on one side of his cravat , and of the firmer grasp of <NAME> upon the other ; although this latter detention was in itself no small inconvenience , as that fascinating woman , besides screwing her knuckles inconveniently into his throat from time to time , had fastened upon him in the first instance with so tight a grip that even in the disorder and distraction of his thoughts he could not divest himself of an uneasy sense of choking .
__label__0	404 `` <NAME> , <NAME> LIFTING , <NAME> VERY BRIGHT '' .
__label__0	I left him in the dying man 's cabin , and returned to my room much affected by this scene .
__label__0	<NAME> away by the waves three times in his efforts to re-embark , he was finally swallowed up without the possibility of assistance being rendered to him , or even the fact of his death being ascertained -- so violent were the waves , and so dark the night ! ''
__label__1	In a little while we had shut the door of the dark and empty sluice-house , and were passing through the quarry on our way back .
__label__0	The crew did not utter a word .
__label__0	answered Altamont in great alarm , indicating a point in the horizon .
__label__1	Whether they turned into it on his movement or on hers matters little .
__label__0	A dense grove of calmadores was descried on the horizon , about three miles away , on the north of the prairie .
__label__1	But she joined in the forfeits , and loved her love to admiration with all the letters of the alphabet .
__label__1	“ O dear me ! ” said I , as if I found myself compelled to give up Biddy in despair .
__label__0	The natives no sooner came on board than they began to pilfer , and it was necessary to fire a cannon to get rid of them ; a wound which one of the natives received in the fray soon changed their disposition , and a discharge of musketry was the reply to the shower of arrows which they let fly from their boats .
__label__1	He suffered himself to be led to the table , where , after having been introduced to the company in due form , he was accommodated with a seat near the chairman and called for a glass of his favourite beverage .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> found that his three companions had risen , and were waiting his arrival to commence breakfast , which was ready laid in tempting display .
__label__0	As for the savages , they returned to the shore about eleven o'clock in the morning , as soon as the coral tops began to disappear under the rising tide ; but I saw their numbers had increased considerably on the shore .
__label__0	Indeed , half a dozen chickens and a fine cock were walking about , flapping their wings and chattering .
__label__0	He had in all his bearing that inexpressible something which tells you that the man is genuine and of frank and upright character .
__label__1	‘ No , not all of you , ’ said the strange man emphatically .
__label__0	“ Why , then , we ’ d have to invent one ! ” replied a facetious member of this grave Society .
__label__1	It was yet night when she awoke , nor did she know how long , or for how short a time , she had slept .
__label__0	It was a dead world , such as we see it to-day . ''
__label__1	However , the <NAME> were so patriotic after all , that they never had pitched their property into the <NAME> yet , but , on the contrary , had been kind enough to take mighty good care of it .
__label__1	Upon my word I am , though I wasn ’ t acquainted with the party .
__label__1	It seems very strange , as there must be right somewhere , that an honest judge in real earnest has not been able to find out through all these years where it is . ''
__label__1	‘ How you frightened me ! ’ ‘ I meant to , you jade , ’ returned the dwarf .
__label__1	I have been dining with the day 's client ; or seeing him dine -- it 's all one ! ” “ That was a rare point , <NAME> , that you brought to bear upon the identification .
__label__1	<NAME> uses me to it .
__label__1	‘ I am afraid you have been giving her some of your wicked looks , my lord , ’ said the intended .
__label__0	“ Manoel loves your daughter , he is loved by her , and in this union they will find the happiness -- -- ” At the first words of <NAME> had risen , without being able to control a sudden start .
__label__1	It had an official look , however , and there was nothing merely ornamental to be seen .
__label__1	'Very good , ' said that gentleman , sipping his peppermint ; ' I 'll call at <NAME> 's as I go home , and tell him to send to-morrow morning .
__label__0	<NAME> rejoined his comrades without opening his lips , and we had no further trouble about him .
__label__1	Why , we ain ’ t had such a thing happen here , my dear , not for I couldn ’ t name the time when .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> ’ t , <NAME> ’ ly ! ’ said <NAME> , tapping her gently on the shoulder .
__label__1	He had been married now a year ; and Mrs. <NAME> had never released him from her determined pity a moment .
__label__0	These poor cetaceans have been so hunted that they have become very rare in the <NAME> and its affluents , and so little time is left them to grow that the giants of the species do not now exceed seven feet .
__label__0	All these lands belonged to the <NAME> group , which is also known as the <NAME> , a very suitable name for this archipelago .
__label__0	Unfortunately the south winds had ceased , and when they re-commenced , they brought the expedition within an inch of destruction .
__label__1	Then he approached the window with dignity ; looking on at <NAME> ’ s news exactly as he had looked on at the dinners in that very room .
__label__1	If she had died without this happiness -- and she is an old woman now and ca n't look to live very long -- she would have blessed him with her last breath , if she had had her senses , as her beloved son <NAME> .
__label__0	He told us so himself .
__label__0	It was that of a lofty mountain , capped with snow .
__label__0	It was only made for two persons , without counting the iemschik , who kept his equilibrium on his narrow seat in a marvelous manner .
__label__0	The `` kiwi '' is about the size of a small turkey , and , like the ostrich , has not the power of flying .
__label__1	'She 's always a-doin ' of it , <NAME> , sir ; she chucks me under the chin , please , sir ; and makes all manner of love ! '
__label__0	`` Yes , '' answered <NAME> , `` it has certainly been done quite lately . ''
__label__0	<NAME> , thanks to the eddy produced by the prolongation of one of the spurs running out into the stream , the current was absolutely _nil_ .
__label__0	That 's a mean way of refusing politely what we ask for . ''
__label__0	On the 7th of April , 1774 , <NAME> sighted the <NAME> group , after seeking them in vain for five consecutive days in the different positions assigned to them by geographers .
__label__1	We went as quietly as we could , but four of us made some noise on the aged boards , and when we came to the second story we found we had disturbed a man who was standing there looking out of his room .
__label__1	It was characteristic of the police people that they had all more or less suspected poor Joe ( though he never knew it ) , and that they had to a man concurred in regarding him as one of the deepest spirits they had ever encountered .
__label__1	I am obliged to you , <NAME> ; it is like your usual discretion .
__label__1	He made his face shine with the punch , so that it looked as if it had been varnished all over .
__label__0	“ ‘ Sir , ’ said he to the <NAME> , ‘ in doubting my statements , you have grossly affronted me ; in believing the thing to be impossible , you have been egregiously mistaken ; and , in proof thereof , you will now eat this beef-steak raw , or you will give me instant satisfaction ! ’ The <NAME> had a wholesome dread of the brawny traveller , and <NAME> eat the steak , although not without a good many wry faces .
__label__0	There was , however , a dark side to the picture .
__label__1	The idea of daring to pretend to assert that you have eyes in your head , and yet ask me what ’ s the matter ! ’ ‘ Is it Mr Sparkler , dear ? ’ ‘ Mis-ter Spark-ler ! ’ repeated <NAME> , with unbounded scorn , as if he were the last subject in the <NAME> system that could possibly be near her mind .
__label__0	he cried , with real joy , `` ah , ah , and here we have the chronometer and the thermometers .
__label__0	Besides this , at every three miles on the road there is a little hamlet of about fourteen houses where the couriers live , who carry messages on foot ; these men wear a belt round their waists and have a girdle with bells attached to it , that are heard at a long distance ; they start at a gallop , quickly accomplishing the three miles and giving the message to the courier who is waiting for it at the next hamlet ; thus the emperor receives news from places at long distances from the capital in a comparatively short time . ''
__label__1	For not one moment after I have ceased to speak , will I stay here ! ’ He turned upon her with his ugliest look , and gripped the table with his hand ; but neither rose , nor otherwise answered or threatened her .
__label__0	The opening into this shaft or well was twelve feet wide .
__label__1	And this from which we run away , striking out the light and overturning one another into the street , is all that represents him .
__label__1	The Jew thrust his head out of the room door when <NAME> had left it ; looked after him as he walked up the dark passage ; shook his clenched fist ; muttered a deep curse ; and then , with a horrible grin , reseated himself at the table ; where he was soon deeply absorbed in the interesting pages of the Hue-and-Cry .
__label__0	The horses were so well rested that they were quite fresh again , and kept up a canter almost constantly .
__label__0	According to the narrative of <NAME> experienced serious difficulties , due to bad weather , from the 1st to the 4th of January , 1828 .
__label__0	And she would certainly have fallen had not <NAME> ’ s arm supported her .
__label__1	We were all extremely glad to see <NAME> so put down , and exalted <NAME> to the skies : especially when he told us , as he condescended to do , that what he had done had been done expressly for us , and for our cause ; and that he had conferred a great boon upon us by unselfishly doing it .
__label__0	<NAME> is not according to the usual custom of their race. ” <NAME> no longer doubted that the expressions he had heard , had proceeded from this tawny group , and had been exchanged between the old gypsy and the woman to whom he gave the <NAME> name of <NAME> .
__label__1	The terrible crowd with which these halls and galleries were filled , so shocked me , that I abridged my stay within the shortest limits , and declined to see that portion of the building in which the refractory and violent were under closer restraint .
__label__1	In the galleries themselves , and more especially on the stair-cases , there lingered a great number of people , who came there , some because their rooms were empty and lonesome , others because their rooms were full and hot ; the greater part because they were restless and uncomfortable , and not possessed of the secret of exactly knowing what to do with themselves .
__label__1	So there ain ’ t no other character ; ain ’ t there , my lad ? ’ Walter briskly waved his hand in the negative .
__label__0	The <NAME> cast anchor in <NAME> Bay on the 22nd of April , and their reception was as friendly as had been anticipated .
__label__1	And I can not bear to think , ’ cried <NAME> , covering her tears with her hands , ‘ I can not bear to think that you of all the world should see him in his only moments of degradation. ’ ‘ Pray , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ do not be so distressed .
__label__0	One of his assailants , in a spirit of self-devotion , attracted to himself the blows of <NAME> .
__label__1	It was as stately and as dark as ever , when he went by and glanced up at its frowning front .
__label__0	The appearance of the country is similar to that of <NAME> , but is on a smaller scale , for <NAME> is only seven or eight leagues in circumference .
__label__0	Having travelled through <NAME> , <NAME> reached <NAME> in May , 1802 .
__label__1	This old gentleman , or the <NAME> ? ''
__label__0	The young woman , who was seated aft , was profoundly affected as she looked out upon the ocean , darkening now with the twilight , on which she had ventured in so frail a vessel .
__label__1	I faltered , “ I do n't know. ” “ Might a mere warmint ask whose property ? ” said he .
__label__1	It is not worth your noticing .
__label__0	It presented a most animated appearance .
__label__0	`` The entrance to the town , upon the side nearest the sea , '' says <NAME> , `` is protected by a battery which overlooks the entire fort , and is surmounted by one enormous piece of artillery capable of discharging a five-hundred pound shot , which is so renowned throughout the <NAME> , that its reputation alone is enough to protect <NAME> . ''
__label__1	Before they separated , however , that gentleman and <NAME> drew <NAME> aside with an air of some mystery ; and <NAME> , thrusting his forefinger between two of <NAME> ’ s ribs , and thereby displaying his native drollery , and his knowledge of the anatomy of the human frame , at one and the same time , inquired -- ‘ I say , old boy , where do you hang out ? ’ <NAME> replied that he was at present suspended at the <NAME> and <NAME> .
__label__1	This was very disagreeable to a guilty mind .
__label__0	asked M'Nicholl , who was carefully studying the situation .
__label__0	But the orang had not touched the ground , when the snowy sheet arose and dispersed in the air in such innumerable flakes that the light of the sun was obscured for some minutes .
__label__0	Therefore it is that I sleep in corners , all alone , for fear that his true name should be discovered . ''
__label__1	The child looked round the room as she took her seat .
__label__1	`` I have been quite alarmed .
__label__0	“ The fair is to be closed , ” said one .
__label__1	And it is satisfactory to me , as your father , my dear <NAME> , to know that you do not come to the consideration of that question with the previous habits of mind , and habits of life , that belong to many young women. ’ ‘ No , father , ’ she returned , ‘ I do not. ’ ‘ I now leave you to judge for yourself , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> , a <NAME> , and <NAME> , a <NAME> , who had both given many a proof of skill and knowledge , were appointed to the command of the expedition , which consisted of two vessels built at <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ How now ? ’ said <NAME> , looking sternly round .
__label__0	<NAME> has proved this incontestably .
__label__1	An elderly lady , though not very far advanced in years , with a proud carriage and a handsome face , was in the doorway as we alighted ; and greeting <NAME> as ‘ My dearest <NAME> , ’ folded him in her arms .
__label__0	Provisions are found there in the greatest profusion , and very cheap ; but clothing , <NAME> cutlery , and furniture fetch an enormous price .
__label__0	The population of this group , if we accept D'Urville 's account , form a kind of transition between the copper-coloured , or the <NAME> , and the black or <NAME> races .
__label__0	`` It is an impossible supposition , '' said the practical <NAME> ; `` unless that impulsive force had failed ; but even then its speed would diminish by degrees , and it would not have stopped suddenly . ''
__label__0	The ‘ <NAME> ’ continued her voyage and arrived at <NAME> .
__label__0	The balloon rose a hundred feet or so , and , aided by the cylinder , soon passed above the surrounding summits .
__label__0	To the hurrahs which greeted him he replied by a graceful bow ; then , waving his hands to request silence , he spoke in perfectly correct English as follows : `` Gentlemen , despite the very hot weather I request your patience for a short time while I offer some explanations regarding the projects which seem to have so interested you .
__label__0	He penetrated a little further north than the <NAME> , and into <NAME> a good deal further east than <NAME> .
__label__1	`` He says -- I know it 's very foolish , we are both so young -- but he says , '' with a burst of tears , `` that he loves me dearly , <NAME> . ''
__label__1	‘ Gone ! ’ He remained in the same attitude , looking steadfastly at him .
__label__1	This going home to clean himself is one of the man ’ s incomprehensible compromises with inexorable facts ; he , and his hat , and his boots , and his clothes , never showing any trace of cleaning , but being uniformly in one condition of dust and grit .
__label__1	When he had gone a little way , he looked back .
__label__0	A favorable result of his arrival , however , was the order which was given to raise the camp that very day , and remove the headquarters to <NAME> .
__label__0	Why have they allowed you to come here ? ” “ To use whatever influence a boundless admiration may have on him who is its object ! ” “ What ! ” exclaimed J. T. <NAME> , “ you have consented to talk thus to me !
__label__0	`` You have your chronometer at hand ? ''
__label__1	And whatever opinion you take away of me , shall make no difference in my remembrance of you .
__label__1	How many years is it , ’ said <NAME> , pondering , ‘ since I first noticed him , quite a little child , dragging himself about on a pair of tiny crutches ?
__label__1	‘ Yes , ’ says <NAME> , with sudden spirit , ‘ The politeness was my guardian ’ s , not mine .
__label__1	‘ And Oh my Eye , I ’ m so sore ! ’ cried <NAME> , starting , over on his back , in a spasmodic way that caused the dressmaker to retreat to the wall .
__label__1	He was a very poor man , who seemed to have no regular employment , but now went roaming about the banks of the river when the tide was low , looking out for bits and scraps in the mud ; and now worked at the unpromising little patch of garden-ground before his cottage ; and now tinkered up a miserable old boat that belonged to him ; or did some job of that kind for a neighbour , as chance occurred .
__label__0	The gallant fellows knew that they were working for the fazender of <NAME> -- for the man whom they loved , for the chief of the excellent family who treated their servants so well .
__label__1	Not six—but what believes as he has doon his duty by the rest and by himseln .
__label__0	<NAME> doubtless with sight which enabled him to pierce the obscurity , he was always in the thick of the fight uttering from time to time -- a sharp hissing sound , which was with him the sign of great rejoicing .
__label__0	The bed was hard , the shelter unsatisfactory , the situation painful -- lying in the open air , five thousand feet above the level of the sea !
__label__0	From <NAME> proceeded to <NAME> in <NAME> , a place not visited by any <NAME> vessel since the time of <NAME> , arriving on the 27th December , 1827 .
__label__1	I saw a figure like myself lying dressed in my clothes on a bed .
__label__1	<NAME> after book was added to the heap of failures , <NAME> being firmly watchful of us all the time .
__label__1	It was very hard , but I turned back , though with a heavy heart , and began laboriously and methodically to plod over the same tedious ground at a snail ’ s pace ; stopping to examine minutely every speck in the way , on all sides , and making the most desperate efforts to know these elusive characters by sight wherever I met them .
__label__0	Consequently a <NAME> could catch an occasional glimpse of our Earth , without altogether quitting the dark side . ''
__label__0	The result , however , of this decision was to create a rivalry entirely without precedent between the different towns of these two States .
__label__0	<NAME> here ; look there ! ” And as <NAME> spoke , he pointed to some scythes , and sickles , and other implements of husbandry that had been left upon the ground .
__label__1	He did not retain it , but laid it gently down , took a candle , looked more closely at the injuries on the head , and at the pupils of the eyes .
__label__1	Then would he come down to that house with a slap upon the table , and meet the honourable gentleman foot to foot .
__label__1	‘ Well , ma ’ am , she will soon be quite comfortable , I hope , ’ returned <NAME> .
__label__1	As <NAME> said this , with the becoming indignation of an ill-used man ; and as <NAME> felt that it rather tended to convey a reflection on the honour of the parish ; the latter gentleman thought it advisable to change the subject .
__label__1	‘ You rendered us a very important service this morning , sir , ’ said he , ‘ will you allow us to offer a slight mark of our gratitude by begging the favour of your company at dinner ? ’ ‘ Great pleasure -- not presume to dictate , but broiled fowl and mushrooms- -capital thing !
__label__0	`` Are these cetaceans as large as those of the northern seas ? ''
__label__1	‘ O , sir , sir , sir ! ’ ‘ Then why , ’ retorted <NAME> , with some slight tinge of a blush , ‘ don ’ t you out with your reason for having your spoon in the soup at all ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , I will tell you the truth .
__label__1	But the eyes of this history can follow him westward , by <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and the <NAME> , to <NAME> and the <NAME> .
__label__1	And so little objection had <NAME> to being deferential in the last degree , that if he might have laid himself at Mr <NAME> ’ s feet , or might have called him by some such title as used to be bestowed upon the <NAME> , he would have been all the better pleased .
__label__0	But what can be the meaning , ” he added seriously , “ of all this displacement of the heavenly bodies ? ” “ What is that great building at <NAME> , captain , with a top like a cap ? ” asked <NAME> .
__label__0	Fix the detective , had foreseen the advantage which <NAME> 's escapade gave him , and , delaying his departure for twelve hours , had consulted the priests of <NAME> .
__label__1	They renewed their charitable efforts , and he beat them off .
__label__0	Professor Agassiz very properly protested against the pretended unhealthiness o the climate of a country which is destined to become one of the most active of the world ’ s producers .
__label__1	‘ This is <NAME> , sir. ’ ‘ I came , ’ said <NAME> , rising , ‘ to beg the favour of a little conversation with you on the subject of the <NAME> family. ’ Plornish became suspicious .
__label__1	I thought I ’ d try another room , and shake it off .
__label__0	A chapel , dedicated to <NAME> , overlooked it from the top of a huge rock , whose foot was laved by the waters of the subterranean sea .
__label__0	But with this miserable cabin they were obliged to be content .
__label__0	The country over which they were passing was remarkable for its fertility .
__label__0	Just as the last growlings of the thunder were lost in the recesses of the mountain , <NAME> felt <NAME> ’ s hand pressing his , and he heard her whisper these words in his ear : “ Cries , brother !
__label__0	“ No , but the gutta percha has evidently softened or melted in the heat , and the hydrogen is escaping through the silk. ” “ How can we prevent that ? ” “ It is impossible .
__label__1	I was guarded in my answer , for I was troubled in my mind with what I had heard and seen .
__label__0	So it remained prudently below .
__label__0	He had nothing better to do than , taking chance for his guide , to wander aimlessly through the streets of <NAME> .
__label__1	Let me have a word with you . '
__label__0	and the Ouest they reached <NAME> , where they went on board the <NAME> and crossed the <NAME> .
__label__0	About eleven o'clock in the morning , the first range of mountains that form the centre of the island was traversed , and we had killed nothing .
__label__1	‘ I made an observation to my friend , sir , ’ replied <NAME> , always ready to enter into conversation .
__label__1	If it means that I grow a little too fervid , or perhaps even hyperbolical , in extolling my native land , I admit the full justice of the remark .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> , followed by several thousand men , made his entry into the <NAME> camp .
__label__1	When we had fortified ourselves with the rum and milk and biscuits , and were going out for the walk with that training preparation on us , I was considerably surprised to see <NAME> take up a fishing-rod , and put it over his shoulder .
__label__0	It was to the brothers Frobisher , fur traders , and to a <NAME> , who reached <NAME> , that their discovery is partially due .
__label__0	Now , <NAME> was nothing but an island .
__label__0	he would exclaim as he patted them gently , `` you must not forget the noble part you are to play up there .
__label__1	There is whispering and wondering all day , strict search of every corner , careful tracing of steps , and careful noting of the disposition of every article of furniture .
__label__0	Lastly , yards , masts , boom , spars , oars , etc. , were all furnished by the first week in October , and it was agreed that a trial trip should be taken round the island , so as to ascertain how the vessel would behave at sea , and how far they might depend upon her .
__label__1	I asked him what he thought of <NAME> ?
__label__0	“ You mustn ’ t be vexed , <NAME> ! ” “ Why should I be vexed , my child ? ” “ And you will let me do it ? ” “ What do you mean ? ” said <NAME> , getting uneasy .
__label__0	The sea was as deserted as the land , and it was there , a few hundred feet from the coast , that the engineer must have found a tomb .
__label__0	I tried to cry out , and arouse him .
__label__1	‘ Come , come , <NAME> , ’ urged <NAME> , at his side .
__label__1	<NAME> said she did n't know ; perhaps they were designed for teachers , perhaps for the stage .
__label__1	But here again they were disappointed , for the gate was closed , and some fierce dogs , barking at their approach , obliged them to retreat .
__label__1	I was so concerned , I recollect , even for the honour of <NAME> , that when <NAME> said , as we drove through its dark streets to the inn , that , as well as he could make out , it was a good , queer , out-of-the-way kind of hole , I was highly pleased .
__label__0	In 1789 , <NAME> published his translation of the drama of S'akuntala , that charming specimen of <NAME> literature , so full of feeling and refinement .
__label__0	The noise redoubling , sometimes producing a continual shower , I soon understood the cause .
__label__1	With that hospitable invitation , the <NAME> said ‘ Good day ! ’ and walked out and shut the door ; leaving Mr Carker still reclining against the chimney-piece .
__label__1	Do not mind the rain .
__label__0	Therefore it was probable that Harding could easily solve the question of “ island or continent , ” to which he attached so much importance .
__label__0	`` Did you know , sir , '' he asked , smiling , `` that the sea contained such riches ? ''
__label__1	When I had money enough , I used to get half-a-pint of ready-made coffee and a slice of bread and butter .
__label__1	She had been singing some time , rising between whiles to bend over him and speak to him , when <NAME> came in .
__label__0	On the first morning of the cruise <NAME> , who , like most Russians , spoke <NAME> fluently , was explaining these peculiarities to <NAME> ; the count was present , and the conversation perpetually recurred , as naturally it would , to the phenomena which remained so inexplicable to them all .
__label__0	<NAME> next determined the position of the island of <NAME> ; sighted the islands of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and finally , entering the channel of <NAME> , surveyed a large number of points in the chain of islands stretching from <NAME> and <NAME> in the direction of <NAME> .
__label__1	But I say this , fearing you may want money to save your own blood from exposure and disgrace -- make as much as you can ! ’ <NAME> shook his head , but looked at him thoughtfully too .
__label__1	So I wagged , and hid myself , and that began it. ’ ‘ And you mean to tell me , ’ said Mr Carker , taking him by the throat again , holding him out at arm ’ s-length , and surveying him in silence for some moments , ‘ that you want a place , do you ? ’ ‘ I should be thankful to be tried , <NAME> , ’ returned <NAME> , faintly .
__label__1	It was evident that very grave and eventful proceedings were on foot ; but various surmises were afloat , respecting their precise character .
__label__1	“ Dear <NAME> , have you heard what becomes of her property ? ” “ Well , old chap , ” said <NAME> , “ it do appear that she had settled the most of it , which I meantersay tied it up , on <NAME> .
__label__0	“ But where was the last place he was in ? ” “ With the <NAME> Calfoucoura. ” “ In the line we have been following ? ” “ Yes. ” “ And who is this Cacique ? ” “ The chief of the <NAME> , a man with two tongues and two hearts. ” “ That ’ s to say false in speech and false in action , ” said <NAME> , after he had translated this beautiful figure of the <NAME> language .
__label__0	The collation which had been taken at the commencement , called in the language of the country `` Refresco , '' had been intended only to whet the appetites of the guests for what was to follow .
__label__1	You see , it had been sunk there by the man as wore it , and I got it up. ’ ‘ How do you know it was sunk by the man who wore it ? ’ asked <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ It ’ s on the spot , you see , and a very cheerful place. ’ ‘ And when , ’ hints Mr Dombey , ‘ would it be convenient ? ’ ‘ I shall make a point , ’ says <NAME> , ‘ of pledging myself for any day you think best .
__label__0	In the lunar orography they have discerned some chains of mountains , which are chiefly distributed over the northern hemisphere .
__label__0	Now that a crowd of adventurers , attracted by the treasures which had been brought back to <NAME> , vied with each other in hastening to <NAME> , now that he could assemble 500 men -- after leaving an important garrison at <NAME> under <NAME> 's command , -- <NAME> had no further reason for delay .
__label__1	`` So you gave him notice ? ''
__label__0	-- '' The _eccentricity_ is _less_ than _unity_ ! ''
__label__1	A part of the <NAME> , indeed , contained so much public spirit and private virtue that not even this strong leverage could move it to good fellowship with a tainted accuser .
__label__1	The milliner -- who was not morose or hard-hearted , only newly insolvent -- was touched , took her in hand with goodwill , found her the most patient and earnest of pupils , and made her a cunning work-woman in course of time .
__label__0	`` Professor , I am sorry for one of the best vessels in the <NAME> navy ; but they attacked me , and I was bound to defend myself .
__label__1	He quite shook hands with me -- which was a violent proceeding for him , his usual course being to slide a tepid little fish-slice , an inch or two in advance of his hip , and evince the greatest discomposure when anybody grappled with it .
__label__1	When he knew I saw him , he looked frightened ; for he started , and shrunk away .
__label__1	Yes , yes , yes. ’ ‘ Your position , my dear <NAME> , is now a fine one .
__label__1	Here he would crease up his eyelids and kiss his fingers to me , though I am happy to say he had ceased to be particular in his attentions since I had been so altered .
__label__1	He now abruptly opens them , and says , in unison with the deepened voice ‘ Ah ! ’ —rather as if stopping himself on the extreme verge of adding— ‘ men ! ’ ‘ I have been since , ’ says <NAME> , with his legs stretched out , and solemnly enjoying himself with the wine and the fire , ‘ what you behold me ; I have been since a solitary mourner ; I have been since , as I say , wasting my evening conversation on the desert air .
__label__1	As <NAME> sat on a large old-fashioned window-seat , where there was ample room for two , it was also natural that <NAME> should sit down beside her ; and as to <NAME> ’ s being unusually spruce and particular in his attire that day , why it was a high festival and a great occasion , and that was the most natural thing of all .
__label__0	They rocked under the shark 's movements , which beat them with indescribable fury .
__label__1	Yes , verily , my lords and gentlemen and honourable boards , adapting your Catechism to the occasion , and by <NAME> ’ s help so you must .
__label__1	You are well on your way to the poor wronged gentleman , and , with a fair sea voyage , and a fair land journey , you will be soon at his dear side. ” She repeated in the same tone , sunk to a whisper , “ I have been free , I have been happy , yet his <NAME> has never haunted me ! ” “ Only one thing more , ” said <NAME> , laying stress upon it as a wholesome means of enforcing her attention : “ he has been found under another name ; his own , long forgotten or long concealed .
__label__0	<NAME> had doubtless soon fallen into the hands of <NAME> .
__label__1	In the interest of seeing her , ever drawing , with no hand to stay her , nearer and nearer to the bottom of this new <NAME> ’ s Staircase .
__label__1	Some straggling carts and coaches rumbling by , first broke the charm , then others came , then others yet more active , then a crowd .
__label__0	Several days elapsed without the reappearance of <NAME> .
__label__0	Five hundred of the natives confronted them , but apparently with no hostile intentions ; they gave them some fish-hooks and old iron in exchange for some of the natural productions of the island , such as figs , and dragon 's blood , a resinous substance taken from the dragon-tree , which has a very pleasant balsamic odour .
__label__0	A great mass of ice , drifting northward with the tide , was rushing towards the brig with the speed of an avalanche .
__label__0	Starting on the 3rd June , 1789 , from <NAME> , on the southern shores of the <NAME> of the <NAME> , accompanied by a few Canadians , and several Indians who had been with <NAME> , he reached 67 degrees 45 minutes N .
__label__0	And , as we shall not fire from the windows of <NAME> , the pirates will not think of causing irreparable damage by throwing shell against it .

__label__0	He would like an <NAME> consul and a doctor to reside in a port he called <NAME> , and finally he requested that certain articles of <NAME> manufacture should be sent to <NAME> , a very thriving sea-port of his .
__label__1	Their conference was very short , but very decided .
__label__1	I was there , as I have mentioned , at all hours .
__label__1	To return to the letter .
__label__0	He approached the girl , took her hand , and put to her the invariable question : “ <NAME> , are you ready ? ” to which she replied as usual , “ I am ready ! ” For a few versts more the raft continued to drift amongst the floating ice .
__label__1	‘ You might have knowed that the gentleman wanted the door shut , without being told , I think. ’ Mr Short obeyed , observing under his breath that his friend seemed unusually ‘ cranky , ’ and expressing a hope that there was no dairy in the neighbourhood , or his temper would certainly spoil its contents .
__label__1	When that time should come , it would not be the heavier to him , for this that she was going to do ; and it might fall something lighter upon her .
__label__1	“ ' I do n't know how she 's there , ' says <NAME> , shivering dreadful with the horrors , 'but she 's standing in the corner at the foot of the bed , awful mad .
__label__1	Still I think it charming .
__label__0	“ So , <NAME> , ” added the engineer , “ you have made a discovery of great importance to us .
__label__1	You couldn ’ t expect that , could you , <NAME> ’ am ? ’ ‘ Oh !
__label__1	Ill-assorted couple , unhappy in themselves and in each other , bound together by no tie but the manacle that joined their fettered hands , and straining that so harshly , in their shrinking asunder , that it wore and chafed to the bone , <NAME> , consoler of affliction and softener of anger , could do nothing to help them .
__label__1	Are you , or are you not , a particular friend of the defendant ’ s ? ’ ‘ I was just about to say , that -- ’ ‘ Will you , or will you not , answer my question , <NAME> ? ’ If you don ’ t answer the question , you ’ ll be committed , <NAME> , ’ interposed the little judge , looking over his note-book .

__label__0	Before the conquerors of the <NAME> the <NAME> <NAME> have been wiped out .
__label__0	D'Urville made no pause in the hydrographical survey of the northern island of <NAME> , keeping up daily communication with the natives , who brought him supplies of pigs and potatoes .
__label__1	‘ And whose should you say it was ? ’ inquired Mr <NAME> , rubbing the pastry against his nose with a dreadful calmness .
__label__0	The calculated time of impact was 2 hours 47 minutes 35.6 seconds .
__label__1	But I also know what <NAME> is .
__label__1	With these last words she snaps her teeth together as if her mouth closed with a spring .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> had , it is true , exhausted fifty-two of the eighty days in which he was to complete the tour , and there were only twenty-eight left .
__label__1	He wandered through the rooms : lately so luxurious ; now so bare and dismal and so changed , apparently , even in their shape and size .
__label__0	You can well understand that there would not be water enough for my Nautilus . ''
__label__1	<NAME> , sir , I am sure , ’ said <NAME> , beginning to regard himself in quite a new light .
__label__1	‘ Can you drink anything ? ’ was his next inquiry .
__label__1	It is remarkable that what we call the world , which is so very credulous in what professes to be true , is most incredulous in what professes to be imaginary ; and that , while , every day in real life , it will allow in one man no blemishes , and in another no virtues , it will seldom admit a very strongly-marked character , either good or bad , in a fictitious narrative , to be within the limits of probability .
__label__1	That 's very pleasant , you know !
__label__1	It is in <NAME> , but not of it .
__label__0	In that case , '' said <NAME> , `` the thing can be arranged .
__label__0	But how were we to release her from her bed in the ice and restore her to her natural element ?
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> couldn ’ t bear the climate , my dear .
__label__0	<NAME> , although exceedingly anxious for news , could ascertain nothing at this place .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> paid him sincere compliments on his mythological visitants , and so did the Major , though he could not forbear adding : “ But mind no fits of absence of mind , my dear <NAME> ; and if you take a fancy to learn <NAME> , don ’ t go and study it in a <NAME> grammar. ” Things went on perfectly smoothly on board .
__label__1	I had the honour of being passed on the road. ” “ Coming up the hill , and at the top of the hill , both ? ” “ <NAME> , it is true. ” “ What did you look at , so fixedly ? ” “ <NAME> , I looked at the man. ” He stooped a little , and with his tattered blue cap pointed under the carriage .
__label__0	But the most astounded personage in the town was <NAME> the burgomaster .
__label__0	But the investigation , though decided upon by the municipal council , produced no result .
__label__1	This , at the time I write , has been proved , I believe , to be the case ; but , as it would have been flat blasphemy against the system to have hinted such a doubt then , I looked out for the penitence as diligently as I could .
__label__1	Now softer , and now louder , now inaudible , now ringing very slowly over bad ground , now brisk and merry , it came on ; until with a loud shouting and lashing , a shadowy postillion muffled to the eyes , checked his four struggling horses at his side .
__label__0	It was a matter of debate that night whether the professor should be invited to join the party ; it was scarcely likely that he would care to come , but , on the whole , it was felt to be advisable to ask him .
__label__0	“ Go then , <NAME> , ” said he , “ go for God , for <NAME> , for my brother , and for myself ! ” The courier , having saluted his sovereign , immediately left the imperial cabinet , and , in a few minutes , the <NAME> .
__label__1	This gentleman is his very particular friend , <NAME> -- ’ ‘ Mr .
__label__0	I estimated its value at L500,000 at least .
__label__0	There they had regularly installed themselves , awaiting the moment to put their abominable schemes into execution .
__label__1	Her nerves is so very delicate , you see , and soon unstrung .
__label__1	‘ I think , <NAME> , ’ he said , ‘ that the employment you can give <NAME> , and the kindness you can show her -- ’ ‘ Yes and I will , ’ said <NAME> , quickly .
__label__0	Those Spaniards who had remained faithful to the cause of order , were obliged to take up arms , and they valiantly defended the admiral , losing but one man in this sad affair .
__label__1	‘ Why , don ’ t you believe that you are kept here , as a cheap example , and a famous instance of the clemency of <NAME> and <NAME> , redounding to the credit of the illustrious <NAME> ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , ’ replied his brother , mildly , ‘ I have long believed that I am kept here for more kind and disinterested reasons. ’ ‘ But you were going , ’ said the Manager , with the snarl of a tiger-cat , ‘ to recite some <NAME> precept , I observed. ’ ‘ Nay , <NAME> , ’ returned the other , ‘ though the tie of brotherhood between us has been long broken and thrown away -- ’ ‘ Who broke it , good Sir ? ’ said the Manager .
__label__0	`` No , '' answered <NAME> ; `` it is an avalanche detached from a lunar mountain . ''
__label__0	“ Ah , doctor ! ” said <NAME> again , with a deep sigh , “ I ’ ll think more than once of my lumps of solid gold-ore !
__label__1	‘ And pray , what did you mean by that , sir ? ’ demanded <NAME> , turning angrily on his assistant .
__label__0	There could be no doubt about it !
__label__1	“ Really , then ? ” said <NAME> , as an amendment .
__label__1	What more could I hope to do by prolonging the interview ?
__label__0	Nothing worthy of notice occurred on the voyage from <NAME> to <NAME> .
__label__0	In fact , even his <NAME> politeness could not suppress two or three decided yawns , which of course the mathematicians were too absorbed to notice .
__label__1	Her thought at such times may be condensed into the two words that oftenest did duty together in all her conversations : ‘ My Sept ! ’ They were a good pair to sit breakfasting together in <NAME> Canon Corner , <NAME> .
__label__0	It must be confessed that this gave some anxiety to the secretary of the <NAME> , who had never sought happiness in such close approximations .
__label__0	But while <NAME> made the stowage and provisioning of the yacht his chief business , he did not forget to fit up the rooms of <NAME> and <NAME> for a long voyage .
__label__0	The traveller was not to be deceived .
__label__1	‘ A new boy , young gentlemen , ’ said the <NAME> ; ‘ Trotwood Copperfield. ’ One <NAME> , who was the head-boy , then stepped out of his place and welcomed me .
__label__0	At seven in the evening <NAME> had not returned .
__label__1	But the likeness ends outside .
__label__1	It ’ s very comfortable , thank you. ’ ‘ I have the pleasure of knowing Mr Dombey , ’ observed <NAME> .
__label__0	Some women were with them .
__label__0	The two notables might even now see the orifices of the pipes which were laid on in the laboratory .
__label__0	`` <NAME> , '' murmured <NAME> , `` I am thy betrothed . ''
__label__0	`` Let us eat if you care to , '' was the answer ; `` although our condition is stupid , not to say disgraceful . ''
__label__0	He took part in the expedition sent by <NAME> about 1510 , to seek for the famous Spice Islands , under the command of <NAME> de <NAME> and of <NAME> , which discovered <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> .
__label__1	The spinster aunt was knitting .
__label__0	But where a stranger would have suspected nothing , the sharpened senses of the <NAME> detected the approach of danger .
__label__0	The view was very extensive , but beyond the cape it ended in <NAME> .
__label__1	From hour to hour I reproach myself for that excess of faith and trustfulness which has led to such distressing consequences ; and almost from minute to minute , I hope that Mr Dombey may explain himself , and relieve the torture I undergo , which is extremely wearing .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> ! ’ cried <NAME> , looking up .
__label__1	‘ Now , don ’ t allow yourself to be fatigued beyond your powers ; there ’ s a amiable bein ’ .
__label__0	<NAME> at these caricatures of all periods , of which my portfolio is full . ''
__label__0	Did he understand that he had made a grave mistake ?
__label__0	“ To be sure he will !
__label__1	said the people , turning to look after her as she rushed away .
__label__0	The destruction of the population of <NAME> whose bones lay about the village was not attributable to that catastrophe .
__label__0	Gradually fields covered with cereals came in sight , whole acres covered with bristling ears of corn , hay-ricks in the shape of large bee-hives , blooming orchards , a fine garden worthy of <NAME> , in which the useful and agreeable were blended ; then came sheds ; commons wisely distributed , and last of all , a plain comfortable dwelling-house , crowned by a joyous-sounding mill , and fanned and shaded by its long sails as they kept constantly moving round .
__label__1	Little <NAME> was not ashamed of her poor shoes .
__label__0	Not that he was uneasy about the future , but he wanted to know at any cost _why_ his projectile had deviated .
__label__1	“ Keep your eyes upon me , dear child , and mind no other object. ” “ I mind nothing while I hold your hand .
__label__0	`` I hope so , <NAME> .
__label__0	`` Perhaps for the travellers as well ! ''
__label__1	But she gave us her blessing , and the assurance of her lasting friendship , and spoke to us , generally , as became a Voice from the Cloister .
__label__1	He 's a thief , a liar , a devil , all that 's bad , from this night forth .
__label__0	He appeared in the streets of <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ You have no connection with any of those rascally papers have you ? ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	A hailstorm of extreme violence assailed the travelers , and obliged them to seek a shelter among the rocks .
__label__1	Copperfield. ’ ‘ I am glad to see you , sir .
__label__1	What with taking heed of these two faces , and what with feeling conscious that the stealthy occupation must set some mark on her own , <NAME> soon began to think that there was not a candid or a natural face among them all but <NAME> ’ s .
__label__1	I therefore supposed that Mrs. <NAME> was not at home , and was quite surprised when the person appeared in the passage without the pattens , and going up to the back room on the first floor before <NAME> and me , announced us as , `` Them two young ladies , <NAME> ! ''
__label__1	As she would not hear of staying to dinner , lest she should by any chance fail to arrive at home with the grey pony before dark ; and as I apprehend <NAME> knew her too well to argue any point with her ; some lunch was provided for her there , and <NAME> went back to her governess , and <NAME> to his office .
__label__0	said <NAME> , holding his chronometer in his hand .
__label__1	It is a part of <NAME> 's policy and mastery to have no political opinions ; indeed , <NAME> opinions .
__label__0	As soon as the movement was assured , and there could be no error as to the height to which the flood would rise , all those interested in the undertaking were seized with no little excitement .
__label__0	Their address in the use of arms and their bearing supported this idea , but it was impossible to know with any certainty .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , at once , here ! ’ His passion was so great , that he could not articulate , but stood clenching his fist , tearing his hair , and stamping upon the ground .
__label__1	It will be two o ’ clock by the time we get back .
__label__1	He has been for some time particularly desirous to serve his country in a post of good emoluments , unaccompanied by any trouble or responsibility .
__label__1	No more than that was ever said against her , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , father , ’ said Mrs. Joram .
__label__0	Small heathers , rosy and white , peeped out timidly above the lingering snow , and seemed to smile at the little heat they received .
__label__0	Until further information , therefore , I shall maintain it to be a sea-unicorn of colossal dimensions , armed not with a halberd , but with a real spur , as the armoured frigates , or the ` rams ' of war , whose massiveness and motive power it would possess at the same time .
__label__1	said my guardian with his good-humoured smile .
__label__1	No visitor can ever have set foot on those shores , with a stronger faith in the <NAME> than I had , when I landed in <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> and his companions had not omitted to observe how severe was the temperature during the winters of <NAME> .
__label__0	As to <NAME> , he was swimming bravely .
__label__1	Here , after gradually failing in loftier hopes , he had “ read ” with divers who had lacked opportunities or neglected them , and had refurbished divers others for special occasions , and had turned his acquirements to the account of literary compilation and correction , and on such means , added to some very moderate private resources , still maintained the house I saw .
__label__1	Then he fell to dumbly playing , without striking the notes , while his little pupil was taken to an open window for air , and was otherwise petted and restored .
__label__1	<NAME> , to relieve him , bade adieu , with many thanks , to <NAME> , and gave her arm to <NAME> .
__label__0	There , however , lies the way to <NAME> , and it is in the midst of ponds , pools , lakes , and swamps , from which the sun draws poisonous exhalations , that the road winds , and entails upon the traveler the greatest fatigue and danger .
__label__1	As these things passed through his thoughts , he jumped upon his feet , and again walked forward .
__label__1	Only because I am sure that you would too .
__label__1	He was greatly interested to hear that I knew <NAME> , and spoke of him with such warmth that I made him tell <NAME> what he thought of him .
__label__0	A tear glistened in the eyes of the dying man .
__label__1	There ’ s time , and to spare , for me to go and come back before the ship sails .
__label__1	He came into my mind as connected with his old chivalrous manner of mentioning my mother 's name and with what my guardian had informed me of his engagement to her sister and his unconscious connexion with her unhappy story .
__label__1	You know Snagsby the stationer ? ''
__label__0	A few days later , King O-Too and several other chiefs visited the <NAME> , and brought them a present of ten or a dozen large pigs and some fruit .
__label__0	Now , this wall is seamed with fissures and clefts which already allow the sulphurous gases generated in the interior of the volcano to escape. ” “ Well ? ” said <NAME> , his brow suddenly contracting .
__label__0	“ Let us see , however , ” he said , “ if there is not some assemblage of letters which appears to form a word -- I mean a pronounceable word , whose number of consonants is in proportion to its vowels .
__label__0	Moreover , the narrative of the voyage was written not by <NAME> , but by a <NAME> named <NAME> .
__label__1	I considered , after some hours were gone , if my tears were really hard to flow now , as they seemed to be , what , in connexion with my loss , it would affect me most to think of when I drew near home -- for I was going home to the funeral .
__label__0	<NAME> can not fail to see us , and his eyes will be constantly on the lookout in that direction .
__label__0	At last the wire touched the rocks on the beach .
__label__0	Besides , we all began to get used to this kind of existence .
__label__0	`` You are right , '' said the doctor , `` and it 's certain they came last night . ''
__label__1	No words can describe the <NAME> ’ s consternation at this sight .
__label__1	As many of the jury as can crowd together at the table sit there .
__label__0	Other than the corrections listed above , printer 's inconsistencies in spelling , punctuation and hyphenation have been retained .
__label__1	‘ How can I be otherwise , my own love , when I see your empty chair ? ’ ‘ My empty chair ! ’ She clings to me for a little while , in silence .
__label__0	By an ingenious device he sets before the rescuers a search which compels their circumnavigation of the globe around a certain parallel of the southern hemisphere .
__label__1	But those were capital days , too , in <NAME> !
__label__0	The <NAME> , being destined to a journey in arctic seas , contained the best arrangements for winter-quarters : the large room for the crew was well provided for ; the corners , where dampness first forms , were shut off ; in fact , when the temperature is very low , a film of ice forms on the walls , especially in the corners , and when it melts it keeps up a perpetual dampness .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> was now made acquainted with the strange history of <NAME> and the colonists of <NAME> .
__label__1	You recollect the case of the <NAME> and the <NAME> , <NAME> ? ’ <NAME> intimated , by a retrospective shake of the head , that he should never forget it -- as indeed it was not likely he would , so long as it continued to be cited daily .
__label__0	Upon the 25th of <NAME> started for <NAME> , a very small town near the <NAME> frontier .
__label__0	In appearance , at least , <NAME> had agreed to light the town , which had much need of it , `` especially at night , '' as <NAME> wittily said .
__label__1	That , his position and attitude were , on the whole , sublime .
__label__1	Every black spot in every mountain of water that rolled away was a bit o ’ the ship ’ s life or a living man , and so she went to pieces , <NAME> , and no grass will never grow upon the graves of them as manned that ship. ’ ‘ They were not all lost ! ’ cried <NAME> .
__label__0	Am I right , <NAME> , maestro illustrissimo ? ''
__label__0	exclaimed <NAME> , `` all our plants will be frozen ! ''
__label__1	‘ Wait outside a few minutes , <NAME> , will you ? ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	This group covers an area of 370 square leagues , and it is formed of sixty groups of islands , among which the <NAME> group is remarkable , over which <NAME> exercises sway .
__label__0	They took it into their heads that some mischief was meant to the sun and the moon .
__label__1	‘ I am afraid it is a poor room for you , ’ said <NAME> , with a smile of welcome , as she offered the post of honour by the fireside .
__label__1	Seven-eighths of my stock is old-fashioned .
__label__1	We must not let you pass out of our knowledge .
__label__1	‘ My dear , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ I ’ m very sorry .
__label__1	‘ If there is a gentleman in this party , ’ said <NAME> , looking round and scarcely able to make his white lips form the words , ‘ he will acquaint me with the name and residence of this man. ’ There was a dead silence .
__label__0	<NAME> and <NAME> looked at each other ; they had not yet troubled themselves about the projectile ; their first thought had been for the traveler , not for the car .
__label__1	I saw a rigidity come upon the whole school as if they had been turned into stone , and found <NAME> in the midst of us , with <NAME> at his side , and Mrs. and <NAME> looking in at the door as if they were frightened .
__label__1	Accordingly , when she had gained her bedchamber , bolted herself in , and began to meditate on the scene she had just witnessed , the most terrific pictures of slaughter and destruction presented themselves to her imagination ; among which , a full-length portrait of <NAME> borne home by four men , with the embellishment of a whole barrelful of bullets in his left side , was among the very least .
__label__0	The ascensional movement suddenly ceased .
__label__0	Since 1817 the <NAME> had been pretty well the only people who had done any satisfactory business with the people of <NAME> , a state of things resulting from the presence of <NAME> residents at the court of <NAME> , on whom alone of course depended the maintenance of the exceptionally cordial relations so long established between them and the government to which they were accredited .
__label__1	I will go , upon your invitation. ’ ‘ Why , when I invite you to my house , ma ’ am , ’ said <NAME> , opening his eyes , ‘ I should hope you want no other invitation. ’ ‘ No , indeed , sir , ’ returned Mrs. Sparsit , ‘ I should hope not .
__label__1	There will be a day of reckoning sooner or later , and it will be a heavy one for you if they are wronged. ’ <NAME> did not allow a muscle of his face to indicate that he heard one word of this parting address .
__label__1	I wonder you do n't starve in your own way also .
__label__1	But first she searched her pocket and found that her money was all gone -- not a sixpence remained .
__label__1	‘ With all my heart , ’ said Mr Swiveller .
__label__1	`` Why , he paid you for them , you know , and handsome too , '' says <NAME> .
__label__0	`` Yes , '' said <NAME> , `` but his reserve does him honour , and it is right to respect the feeling which he has about his sad past . ''
__label__1	Every man sits down , dull and languid ; swallows his fare as if breakfasts , dinners , and suppers , were necessities of nature never to be coupled with recreation or enjoyment ; and having bolted his food in a gloomy silence , bolts himself , in the same state .
__label__0	The buzzing of the over-heated boiler was heard , and the steam was escaping from the valves .
__label__0	`` But let them at least give me back my shoes ! ''
__label__1	Tired of walking , repulsed and pushed about , stunned by the noise and confusion , anxious for her brother and the nurses , terrified by what she had undergone , and the prospect of encountering her angry father in such an altered state ; perplexed and frightened alike by what had passed , and what was passing , and what was yet before her ; <NAME> went upon her weary way with tearful eyes , and once or twice could not help stopping to ease her bursting heart by crying bitterly .
__label__0	<NAME> had hastened up to his wife and eagerly asked : “ Has he spoken ? ” “ No , ” replied <NAME> , “ but he has yielded to my entreaties , and wishes to see you. ” “ Ah , dear <NAME> , you have succeeded ! ” “ I hope so , Edward. ” “ Have you made him any promise that I must ratify ? ” “ Only one ; that you will do all in your power to mitigate his punishment. ” “ Very well , dear Helena .
__label__0	The current is not so rapid and the islets are easily avoided , so that there were no touchings or groundings .
__label__1	`` Well , sir , '' says <NAME> , holding his hat at the side of his head in his deference towards his best customer , `` I was wishful to say a word to you , sir . ''
__label__0	At this elevation rain is unknown , and vapors only condense into snow or hail .
__label__1	Here he is ! -- He looks quiet. ’ With these words , which had the effect of causing the harmless <NAME> painful agitation , Mr Fledgeby withdrew to his former post , and the old man entered the counting-house .
__label__0	Any one who saw him would have called him bold , and any one who heard him would have called him coldly passionate ; he was a man who would never retreat , and who would risk the lives of others as coldly as his own .
__label__1	<NAME> , don ’ t deny that. ’ ‘ Yes , I believe she is considered so , ’ replied <NAME> .
__label__0	On the 27th , in the morning , in the presence of the authorities of the <NAME> , the _Halbrane's_ anchor was lifted , the last good wishes and the final adieus were exchanged , and the schooner took the sea .
__label__0	He had besides sworn not to see his mother .
__label__0	In spite of their losses , the <NAME> called this island , in memory of the refreshment they had enjoyed there , <NAME> .
__label__1	At this moment the noise grew louder .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> is the gentleman ’ s name. ’ ‘ I hope you have preserved the unities , sir ? ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	But at any rate he would be in a position to give an account of what had taken place before this terrible execution .
__label__0	Would the old hands side with the new-comers ?
__label__1	you have brought your pigs to a very indifferent market , Arthur. ’ If <NAME> had patience , <NAME> had not .
__label__0	`` And our friend <NAME> , '' said a third , saluting the sailor named .
__label__1	Some slight symptoms of vitality having been awakened in <NAME> by the soda-water , he suffered himself to be prevailed upon to wash his face and hands , and to submit to be brushed by <NAME> .
__label__0	cried <NAME> ; after some moments ' silence .
__label__1	`` <NAME> , '' said the boy , standing still to gaze at us .
__label__0	It was time ; the two icebergs met with irresistible force , crushing the whale between them .
__label__0	“ If so , he must be well acquainted with the country , and it is possible that he has left the <NAME> road , depending on rejoining it later. ” “ But then we should be in advance of him , ” answered the pendja-baschi ; “ for we left <NAME> within an hour after his departure , and have since followed the shortest road with all the speed of our horses .
__label__0	If ever complete isolation was to be found on earth , it was on this little out-of-the-way island .
__label__1	<NAME> and lustrous as she was , there was that in her face and air which seemed to separate her hopelessly from <NAME> , and from everyone , for ever more .
__label__1	A very good likeness in its way , but it wants force of character .
__label__0	But there was a great deal of discontent among them .
__label__1	The second officer , who had attended to it closely , then copied it out and called in another man in uniform ( there were several in an outer room ) , who took it up and went away with it .
__label__1	Once more I say , time presses .
__label__0	The Professor , who was looking on , held his chronometer in his hand .
__label__1	‘ He has kissed one of ‘ em ! ’ exclaimed the delighted little man .
__label__1	If <NAME> had not arrived at that wise decision firmly to restrain himself from loving <NAME> , he would have lived on in a state of much perplexity , involving difficult struggles with his own heart .
__label__1	‘ He is dead , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	It seemed as if there were moments when he could by no means have sworn but that the old man was an ancient retainer of his , who had been meritoriously faithful .
__label__0	It is the depôt and market for the richest productions of <NAME> , such as pearls and precious stones , and merchants come from long distances round to purchase them .
__label__1	`` And now , '' says <NAME> , stirring the fire , `` touching this same bundle of letters .
__label__0	He said `` Keep quiet , I shall be safe as long as there is no one in Peru who does not know that I can in a moment take the life of any one who should dare to form the project of attempting mine . ''
__label__0	“ As you please , <NAME> Starr. ” “ Have you your lamp ? ” “ Yes , and I only wish it was still the safety lamp , which we formerly had to use ! ” “ Sure enough , ” returned <NAME> , “ there is no fear of fire-damp explosions now ! ” <NAME> was provided with a simple oil lamp , the wick of which he lighted .
__label__1	The coach , with <NAME> inside , came up in due time , and I took my box-seat again , and arrived in <NAME> safe , -- but not sound , for my heart was gone .
__label__1	It ’ s like helping an outside passenger up , ven he ’ s been pitched off a coach , and puttin ’ your hand in his pocket , vile you ask him , vith a sigh , how he finds his-self , Sammy. ’ With this figurative illustration of his meaning , <NAME> unclasped his pocket-book , and drew forth a dirty sheet of letter-paper , on which were inscribed various characters crowded together in remarkable confusion .
__label__0	There was not a variation in the surface of the soil , not a hillock of sand , not a pebble , to relieve the gaze .
__label__0	From on high I shall still participate in your enterprises , and I fear not but that they will prosper . ''
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> , perhaps thinking that such a process might be productive of inconvenience to himself , declined to offer the temptation , and , soon after , called up <NAME> .
__label__1	She felt she must do that , or he might suspect the truth .
__label__0	But as the aeronauts were being hurried on at a speed of 70 miles a second , this vague aspect of the earth soon developed itself into definite outlines .
__label__0	<NAME> came ; nothing occurred to alarm them , or to mar its beauty .
__label__1	that has it , ’ replied <NAME> , ‘ and ready iced too .
__label__1	And he is in prison . ''
__label__0	And as <NAME> endeavoured to seize the hand which had just saved him , the stranger folded his arms , his chest heaved , his look darkened , and he appeared to wish to escape , but making a violent effort over himself , and in an abrupt tone , -- `` Who are you ? ''
__label__1	“ I have looked at her from my prison-window , when I could not bear her light .
__label__0	[ Illustration ] And , in fact , three or four young hares , springing about in the heath and young moss , ran boldly towards the three men ; they were so cunning that even <NAME> was softened .
__label__1	It ’ s no fun , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ unless we take them by surprise .
__label__1	'What do _you_ do here ? '
__label__1	What he supposed , for example , <NAME> would do , if he and <NAME> ever should encounter ?
__label__1	‘ He bites. ’ ‘ Eh , <NAME> , eh ? ’ pursued the client .
__label__1	‘ Why didn ’ t ‘ ee punch his head , or lay theeself doon and kick , and squeal out for the pollis ?
__label__0	In the woods are found black and brown bears , the lynx , ermine , weasel , minever , squirrel , marmot , beaver , fox , elk , and the wild goat .
__label__1	I shall look in by-and-by when I ’ m out , to see how you get on , <NAME> .
__label__1	But while he did this , and wore the most careless and indifferent deportment that his practised arts enabled him to assume , he inwardly resolved , not only to visit all the mortification of being compelled to suppress his feelings , with additional severity upon <NAME> , but also to make the young lord pay dearly for it , one day , in some shape or other .
__label__1	‘ Thank you , ’ replied <NAME> ; ‘ I ’ d rather not. ’ ‘ What do _you _think , <NAME> ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> , you have addressed some remarks to me. ’ <NAME> turned round , bent his head meekly , and smiled .
__label__0	A railway train from <NAME> Francisco to <NAME> , and a transatlantic steamer from <NAME> to <NAME> , would doubtless bring them to the end of this impossible journey round the world within the period agreed upon .
__label__1	Almost in an instant afterwards , as I leaned back in my seat , he looked in , with his lighted lantern in his hand , an excited and quite different man .
__label__0	The great number of plants discovered by the naturalists in this part , induced <NAME> to give it the name of <NAME> .
__label__1	Thank you , sir , thank you .
__label__1	She had the misfortune to lose her husband when she had been married a few months .
__label__1	‘ You are putting it on yourself , father , and getting into all this injury of your own accord ! ’ said the young gentleman morosely .
__label__0	A middle-aged , respectable woman to help dress the ladies of the troupe of the `` Theatre Royal of <NAME> . ''
__label__0	“ And I hope the inundation will have gone down in twenty-four hours , ” said <NAME> .
__label__1	Once a year , ’ she answered , shaking her head .
__label__1	The servant-maid had ticked the two words ‘ Mr Clennam ’ so softly that she had not been heard ; and he consequently stood , within the door she had closed , unnoticed .
__label__1	<NAME> , I wo n't be smothered any more .
__label__0	In other words , while <NAME> , going eastward , saw the sun pass the meridian eighty times , his friends in <NAME> only saw it pass the meridian seventy-nine times .
__label__1	So now , '' said <NAME> , going up to him and giving him her trembling hand , `` we are only cousins again , <NAME> -- for the time perhaps -- and I pray for a blessing on my dear cousin , wherever he goes ! ''
__label__1	To complete it , she seated herself in a chair by the side of the little chair , and protectingly drew under her arm the spare hand that crept up to her .
__label__1	The <NAME> disappears , and in a few moments returns .
__label__0	<NAME> , his formidable jaws open , preceded the colonists , and he was followed by <NAME> , armed with a knotty cudgel , which he brandished like a club .
__label__1	The gaps remain , and there are not unpopular lodgings among the rubbish .
__label__0	The fine season this year was full two months in advance , and it is to be feared the bad season may come sooner than usual . ''
__label__0	“ <NAME> , ” said the engineer , “ you have always shown much deference to my advice ; will you , in this matter , yield to me ? ” “ I will do as you please , <NAME> , ” answered the sailor , who was not at all convinced .
__label__0	And at the same time he muttered to himself : “ I certainly have seen this fellow somewhere ! ” <NAME> was not the man to allow a conversation to drop which was likely to interest him , and for very good reasons .
__label__1	Let him keep to ’ t .
__label__0	When at last the kinship of all these forces was discovered , it is simply astounding that 500 years should still have to elapse before men could analyze and describe the several modes of vibration that constitute these differences .
__label__1	The confined room , strong of parchment-grease , is warehouse , counting-house , and copying-office .
__label__0	At 1152 feet , the <NAME> positively refused to go a single inch further .
__label__0	On the fifth day the invalid found himself quite cured and got up .
__label__1	`` I am at a loss , sir , '' said I , `` to imagine what you can have to communicate in total confidence to me , whom you have never seen but once ; but I should be very sorry to do you any injury . ''
__label__1	‘ Oh , don ’ t you think he ’ s changed ? ’ said Mrs. Heep .
__label__0	The _Saint-Jean <NAME> was made ready for sea at <NAME> , and provisioned for three years , with every requisite for a distant expedition .
__label__1	‘ Isn ’ t it ? ’ Mr <NAME> acquiesced ; ‘ but I want one ; and I know you have got several little wedding keepsakes about , with scissors and tweezers and such things in them .
__label__1	‘ Our brother is not worth a thought , far less a tear .
__label__1	‘ Restrain him , ’ cried <NAME> ; ‘ Winkle , <NAME> -- he must not peril his distinguished life in such a cause as this. ’ ‘ Let me go , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	All I was going to say was , that I hold myself under an obligation to the coincidence , that ’ s all. ’ ‘ Oh !
__label__1	I would fain linger yet with a few of those among whom I have so long moved , and share their happiness by endeavouring to depict it .
__label__0	The time was then propitious for sowing this single precious grain of corn .
__label__0	He was much impressed by the wealth of the faithful and the peculiar characteristics of that city , which lives for and by the <NAME> cultus .
__label__0	It was nightfall before the promontory was doubled .
__label__0	He got in , however , without saying any thing .
__label__1	She can not endure their restraint and will walk alone in a neighbouring garden .
__label__1	`` If , sir , '' she begins , `` in my knowledge of my secret -- '' But he interrupts her .
__label__1	There 's no time to lose . '
__label__1	‘ At all events I should prepare them here for the possibility of my going away suddenly , ’ said <NAME> ; ‘ I should lose no time in doing that. ’ As the thought occurred to him , he took up his hat and hurried to the green-room .
__label__0	His embarrassment and consternation had been great , when on arriving at the confluence of the <NAME> and <NAME> , he had not found <NAME> , who was to have been awaiting him .
__label__1	‘ I wrote him a note , I said it was a painful thing .
__label__0	“ And when it is in the pot , ” asked <NAME> naturally , “ what will it be like ? ” “ An excellent piece of beef , ” replied <NAME> .
__label__0	On the 30th October <NAME> rejoined <NAME> and <NAME> at <NAME> , finding them considerably weakened by fever and the effects of the climate .
__label__1	As we advanced , I began to feel misgivings that my companion lost confidence .
__label__0	They set about it so precipitately that in less than half an hour not a single boat remained in sight .
__label__0	His mind is at the top of the volcano !
__label__1	<NAME> goes out with an air of native gentility ; and <NAME> , to whom it is , on an emergency , as natural to be groom of the ceremonies as it is to be anything else , shows her downstairs , not without gallantry .
__label__1	<NAME> and blest the morning that should rise on such a night : for men , delayed no more by stumbling-blocks of their own making , which are but specks of dust upon the path between them and eternity , would then apply themselves , like creatures of one common origin , owing one duty to the Father of one family , and tending to one common end , to make the world a better place !
__label__1	‘ And yet with such a true and gallant spirit , ’ pursued <NAME> .
__label__0	At a certain period , the earth consisted only of an elastic crust , liable to alternative upward and downward movements in virtue of the law of attraction .
__label__0	Their shell is still soft , their flesh extremely tender , and after they have cooked them they eat them just like oysters .
__label__1	You spoke of my sister ’ s tears .
__label__1	She has been with us a long time : we don ’ t forget her claims upon us , and I hope we know how to make allowances. ’ ‘ You hope to know how to make allowances ? ’ she returned , in a level , measured voice .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> is very nearly nineteen , ’ replied the widow .
__label__1	When the <NAME> had considered it a little while , she said to the tiny woman , And you keep watch over this every day ?
__label__1	Further , he became particular in his attentions to the ladies ; and dancing with <NAME> , whispered to her -- whispered to her ! -- though not so softly but that <NAME> heard him say this remarkable poetry , ‘ Had I a heart for falsehood framed , I ne ’ er could injure You ! ’ This , <NAME> heard him repeat to four young ladies , in succession .
__label__0	This same year , King Emmanuel wishing to organize a regular government in the <NAME> , had made <NAME> da Cunha his viceroy , but <NAME> having become temporarily blind was obliged to resign his power before he had exercised it .
__label__1	‘ Nor was this the whole extent of the baron ’ s misfortunes .
__label__1	Do you think I don ’ t know what a woeful day it was for the soft little creature when you first came in her way -- smirking and making great eyes at her , I ’ ll be bound , as if you couldn ’ t say boh !
__label__0	But , in short , <NAME> did not suffer much from the inclemency of the weather , and it was the same with the corral , which , less exposed than the plateau , and sheltered partly by <NAME> , only received the remains of the hurricanes , already broken by the forests and the high rocks of the shore .
__label__0	It was then the favourable season for attempting explorations in the <NAME> .
__label__0	But when my uncle came to understand that they were <NAME> miles , of eight thousand yards each , he was obliged to be more moderate in his ideas , and , considering the horrible roads we had to follow , to allow eight or ten days for the journey .
__label__1	‘ If he has had time to think of it , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ he has not had time to think better of it -- or differently of it , if that ’ s better .
__label__1	A great deal of laughter ensued , and Mrs. <NAME> volunteered to humour him , so she took a slight sip out of her glass .
__label__1	Light mists arise , and the dew falls , and all the sweet scents in the garden are heavy in the air .
__label__0	He accordingly began to make threatening gestures , when , to the unmitigated astonishment of himself and the captain , the animal darted forward , and in one single bound gained the summit of the rock .
__label__0	The schooner was to sail on the 15th of <NAME> , and on the eve of that day I had no reason to think that Captain Len Guy had repented him of his categorical refusal .
__label__1	As the day declined into the afternoon , and the air , which had been at intervals clear enough to allow the <NAME> coast to be seen , became again charged with mist and vapour , <NAME> 's thoughts seemed to cloud too .
__label__0	The good child knelt down , exclaiming , “ Oh Lord God !
__label__1	Long before we saw the sea , its spray was on our lips , and showered salt rain upon us .
__label__1	And beside him , white with rage or fear , or both , were the scowling features of the man who had accosted him in the inn-yard .
__label__1	‘ I am quite rejoiced , Mr Carker , ’ said the lady-mother , at breakfast , after another approving survey of him through her glass , ‘ that you have timed your visit so happily , as to go with us to-day .
__label__0	It was , therefore , much better to tow it to the beach at <NAME> .
__label__1	The coat was wide-skirted ; and in that respect like _the_ coat , but , oh how different !
__label__1	‘ Let me get at him , <NAME> , ’ cried <NAME> , as he rushed at the ill- starred youth .
__label__1	And as I felt that it came quicker , and as I felt that he saw that it came quicker , I felt that I had less chance than ever of getting anything out of him .
__label__1	The visitor said that was well , and he would return for the information , relying on its being obtained .
__label__1	He needed no second entreaty ; and she prepared her father ’ s bed , and begged him to lie down .
__label__0	The street boys shouted after him , — “ Go along , old pole-shifter ! ” “ Hallo , old clock-jobber ! ” “ <NAME> ’ s the figuring tinker ? ” And a mob gathered and began to hustle him , and he had to seek refuge in the <NAME> mansion , where Mrs. <NAME> did her best to console him .
__label__0	Whatever you do will be best , when you wish me to join you in your researches , I am ready to follow you . ''
__label__1	In the mildest language , I adore you .
__label__1	<NAME> , ’ said <NAME> to his old acquaintance , the hard-headed gentleman , ‘ a glass of wine ? ’ ‘ With great satisfaction , <NAME> , ’ replied the hard-headed gentleman solemnly .
__label__0	Unless he was saved by a miracle , <NAME> might now be considered as irrevocably lost .
__label__1	It 's a monomania with him to think he is possessed of documents .
__label__1	It 's a freehold , by <NAME> ! ” “ Is it indeed ?
__label__0	He was looking at the ship , which was five or six miles to leeward .
__label__1	‘ Your people don ’ t usually travel in character , do they ? ’ said <NAME> , pointing to the dresses of the dogs .
__label__1	He 's game enough now , I 'll engage .
__label__0	`` But that is the top of the volcano ! ''
__label__1	‘ And have a highly respectable reference for everything , have you ? ’ <NAME> replied that she had , and laid her uncle ’ s card upon the table .
__label__1	I HAD one , but what he may think about it at the present time I can ’ t say .
__label__1	About something relating to <NAME> , he believed .
__label__1	They have no fixed offices , their legal business being transacted in the parlours of public-houses , or the yards of prisons , whither they repair in crowds , and canvass for customers after the manner of omnibus cads .
__label__1	I verily believe that the announcement in the newspapers when his mother was confined was 'On Tuesday last , at her residence in Botheration Buildings , Mrs. Skimpole of a son in difficulties . ' ''
__label__1	‘ If ever one mortal had reason to be penetrated with love and reverence for another : with such attachment as would make the hardest service in his behalf a pleasure and delight : with such grateful recollections as must rouse the utmost zeal and fidelity of his nature : those are the feelings which I should entertain for you , and do , from my heart and soul , believe me ! ’ ‘ I do believe you , ’ replied the old gentleman , ‘ and I am happy in the belief .
__label__1	treat him kindly , <NAME> for my sake ! '
__label__0	Destitute of the necessaries of life , without clothes , without efficient shelter from the almost perpetual severity of this glacial latitude , unarmed , and unlearned in any industrial art which would enable them to construct the more necessary utensils , they passed a miserable life , and could only exist with difficulty .
__label__0	Besides , the frequent rains of <NAME> visit <NAME> 's region in like abundance .
__label__1	‘ Damn that boy , he ’ s gone to sleep again .
__label__0	In the spring of 1007 , three vessels carrying 160 men and some cattle , left <NAME> ; the object in view was the foundation of a permanent colony .
__label__0	Before this tent , on a japanned table inlaid with precious stones , was placed the sacred book of the <NAME> , its pages being of thin gold-leaf delicately engraved .
__label__1	She says to her , “ Rise up from worse than death , and come with me ! ” Them belonging to the house would have stopped her , but they might as soon have stopped the sea .
__label__0	It was a run of eighty miles , and was accomplished in two hours .
__label__1	Again , <NAME> , in pursuit of her strong purpose with reference to her father , and her steady resolution to believe that she was herself unwittingly to blame for their so cold and distant relations , would recall to mind that this gentleman was his confidential friend , and would think , with an anxious heart , could her struggling tendency to dislike and fear him be a part of that misfortune in her , which had turned her father ’ s love adrift , and left her so alone ?
__label__1	When I say we speak <NAME> and <NAME> , I mean they do .
__label__1	Except the clock , there was not such an accurate and unimpeachable instrument in existence as the little thermometer which hung behind the door .
__label__0	<NAME> in his turn entered <NAME> , and recognized <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> .
__label__1	Mrs. <NAME> was so much affected on this particular occasion , that , assisting <NAME> to his hat after breakfast , and being then alone with him in the hall , she imprinted a chaste kiss upon his hand , murmured ‘ My benefactor ! ’ and retired , overwhelmed with grief .
__label__0	It seemed as though a vast sheet of silk had been torn apart for an infinity of length .
__label__1	They are generally of opinion that it will be shorn of some of its emoluments , and made uncomfortable by newly-devised checks and restrictions ; and those who are beyond all hope of it are quite sure they would rather not have it , and don ’ t at all envy the person for whom it may prove to be reserved .
__label__0	His attitude and mien were that of a man utterly stupefied .
__label__1	‘ Well , <NAME> , ’ said the other -- ‘ Doctor <NAME> was of the same mind , I believed .
__label__1	I am going to <NAME> on business .
__label__0	But their searches were vain , and during the half of that day they sought to no purpose among the thickets of trees which covered the islet .
__label__0	When they take observations , they turn their backs to the north , the reverse position to that which they occupy when they study a terrestrial map .
__label__1	Keep this quiet , and make no inquiry for me ; it is useless .
__label__1	The rest of the <NAME> property being left to <NAME> ’ s father , I could at any time , without unsettling more than the two sums , have made a pretence of finding it .
__label__1	However , he married the young lady , and they lived in a humble dwelling , probably possessing a porch ornamented with honeysuckle and woodbine twining , until she died .
__label__0	But , I do n't know if I am right or not , there seems to be a sea breeze ! ''
__label__1	<NAME> said nothing , but folding his arms , and thrusting his head forward so as to obtain a nearer view of <NAME> ’ s face , scanned his features closely .
__label__1	He took very little supper , but was a long time over it , and often reverted to his brother ’ s declining state .
__label__0	Most of them were known to the captain , and <NAME> , who had accompanied <NAME> in 1767 , and Cook two years later , received a warm welcome from them .
__label__1	I saw you with money yesterday .
__label__1	It was all over now .
__label__0	if , as we supposed , <NAME> employed the <NAME> in works of vengeance .
__label__0	Scarcely had he caught a glimpse of the hunter , when he bounded through the air ; but he had not touched the ground ere a bullet pierced his heart , and he fell to the earth dead .
__label__1	‘ Upon my honour , ’ says <NAME> , ‘ although it ’ s an unusual sort of thing in a private gentleman ’ s house , I must beg leave to call upon you to drink what is usually called a -- in fact a toast. ’ The Major very hoarsely indicates his approval .
__label__0	He fully experienced the intellectual gratification -- much greater than , perhaps , would be thought -- of the man who , after hours of obstinate endeavor , saw the impatiently sought-for sense of the logogryph coming into view .
__label__1	As I had never even heard of the first remedy , and always had the second in the closet , I gave Mrs. Crupp a glass of the second , which ( that I might have no suspicion of its being devoted to any improper use ) she began to take in my presence .
__label__0	The conversation , beginning with a few disconnected phrases , soon gave place to loud and steady snores .
__label__1	The female servants and female visitors were running constantly to and fro ; and there were such multitudinous demands for hot water , such repeated outcries for needles and thread , and so many half-suppressed entreaties of ‘ Oh , do come and tie me , there ’ s a dear ! ’ that <NAME> in his innocence began to imagine that something dreadful must have occurred -- when he grew more awake , and remembered the wedding .
__label__0	At sight of them he began dancing and singing and throwing dust upon his head .
__label__0	The night passed without incident , and on the next day , the 15th of February , the journey through the forest , rather tedious than difficult , was continued .
__label__0	He teaches me what I must do .
__label__1	On hearing this most unexpected sound , <NAME> looked , first incredulous , and afterwards amazed .
__label__1	There are three there , <NAME> , with a jolly large blue unicorn and gold pitchfork on 'em : which is the old lady 's arms . '
__label__0	An <NAME> well versed in geography .
__label__1	But bring him here , upon this crowded deck .
__label__1	The child sat watching and thinking of these things , until the phantom in her mind so increased in gloom and terror , that she felt it would be a relief to hear the old man ’ s voice , or , if he were asleep , even to see him , and banish some of the fears that clustered round his image .
__label__0	Millions of luminous fragments streaked the sky with their blazing fires .
__label__0	This `` great attraction '' was to close the performance .
__label__0	[ 1 ] [ 1 ] Thermometer ( < i > thermos < /i > , and < i > metron < /i > , measure ) ; an instrument for measuring the temperature of the air. -- Manometer ( < i > manos < /i > , and < i > metron < /i > , measure ) ; an instrument to show the density or rarity of gases. -- Chronometer ( < i > chronos < /i > .
__label__0	From this point to <NAME> the beach was very narrow between the edge of the forest and the reefs .
__label__1	I wish your ladyship good day . ''
__label__0	Our ears must have deceived us , and our eyes have cheated us !
__label__1	said <NAME> , apparently refreshed .
__label__0	Doubtless it was right to retrace my steps in an upward direction .
__label__1	<NAME> & <NAME> for the plaintiff , Aug. 28 , 1827. ” All regular , <NAME> ; perfectly. ’ <NAME> coughed and looked at <NAME> , who said ‘ Perfectly , ’ also .
__label__0	They did not doubt that if <NAME> had arrived safely at <NAME> , <NAME> would have sent him back immediately .
__label__1	Again , as if by agreement , they looked at one another with one meaning in their faces .
__label__1	Now , this is a pretty sort of thing , isn ’ t it , that you should have been left here , all these years , and no money paid after the first six -- nor no notice taken , nor no clue to be got who you belong to ?
__label__1	Knowing that your clear head would propose that alternative , I have gone over the calculations in my mind ; and I find that to compound a felony , even on very high terms indeed , would not be as safe and good for me as my improved prospects in the Bank. ’ ‘ Bitzer , ’ said <NAME> , stretching out his hands as though he would have said , <NAME> how miserable I am !
__label__0	It was not a body abandoned to the waves ; it was a living man , swimming with a strong hand , disappearing occasionally to take breath at the surface .
__label__0	<NAME> knows all about it !
__label__1	Such a staircase , with its accessories , in the older and more crowded parts of <NAME> , would be bad enough now ; but , at that time , it was vile indeed to unaccustomed and unhardened senses .
__label__1	The family had left that part a week before ; they had called in such trifling debts as were outstanding , discharged them , and left the place by night .
__label__1	inquired <NAME> : anxious to encourage any symptoms of good-humour in the unwelcome visitors .
__label__0	`` He 's a spy sent to keep us in view !
__label__1	‘ But what ’ s the use of tapping ? ’ he said , ‘ She ’ ll never hear .
__label__1	It was a case of jealousy .
__label__0	“ Then how did it manage ? ” “ At what distance from the sea did you leave this turtle ? ” asked the engineer , who , having suspended his work , was reflecting on this incident .
__label__1	‘ However doubtful reason I may have , <NAME> , ’ said Mr Dombey , still going majestically on , as if she had not spoken , ‘ to hold the occasion in very pleasant remembrance just now , there are appearances in these things which must be maintained before the world .
__label__0	The train will be there in an hour , and will stop there ten minutes .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> that off ; ’ which he did , with his right thumb on his left .
__label__1	`` What are you talking of ? ''
__label__0	They found there a considerable quantity of ammunition and provisions , conveyed thither by the convicts in order to form a reserve .
__label__0	I thought to myself that the boat might very well be used in the latter case .
__label__1	I have brought misery on what I dearly love , I know -- you know !
__label__0	But think of <NAME> after <NAME> .
__label__1	He made his way by sea to <NAME> , and back , after hearing the narrative to which <NAME> had assisted me .
__label__1	He was taken on board , and instantly manacled at the wrists and ankles .
__label__0	<NAME> vines abounded and climbed over the trees in long festoons as they do in <NAME> .
__label__0	Indeed , on the morning of the 17th , the “ Bonadventure ” had been forty-eight hours at sea , and nothing showed that she was near the island .
__label__1	I was regularly turned on my back when I found him taken up by your establishment , I do assure you . ''
__label__0	But the moon grew larger to their eyes , and they fancied if they stretched out their hands they could seize it .
__label__1	The grave beneath the tree , where both my parents lay -- on which I had looked out , when it was my father ’ s only , with such curious feelings of compassion , and by which I had stood , so desolate , when it was opened to receive my pretty mother and her baby -- the grave which <NAME> ’ s own faithful care had ever since kept neat , and made a garden of , I walked near , by the hour .
__label__0	The rain and the heavy spray raised by the storm , and the coming on of night , made it necessary to put the <NAME> under a close-reefed topsail and jib , under which pressure of sail she behaved splendidly .
__label__0	<NAME> is a regular jungle , an almost impenetrable mass of brushwood , above which rise thickets of rimas , tamarind , fig , and palm trees .
__label__1	They asked me to be industrious and faithful , and I promised to be so .
__label__1	I can ’ t stop a minute , or I shall be missed , and I don ’ t want ‘ em to miss me. -- Eh , <NAME> ? ’ He seemed to have an insatiate delight in appealing to her and looking at her ; excitedly sticking his hair up at the same moment , like a dark species of cockatoo .
__label__0	It is one of those errors which some admire , others blame ; which God alone can judge .
__label__0	356 FEAR , <NAME> ON CLAWBONNY 'S <NAME> , '' <NAME> .
__label__1	It ’ s nat ’ ral in young folk , <NAME> ’ r <NAME> , when they ’ re new to these here trials , and timid , like my little bird , -- it ’ s nat ’ ral. ’ She clung the closer to him , but neither lifted up her face , nor spoke a word .
__label__1	And I would wish in conclusion to remind you , as a business precaution , in case it should be necessary to recall the fact in any communication with <NAME> , that throughout our interview I have expressly stated my sole consideration to be <NAME> 's feelings and honour and the family reputation .
__label__0	Latterly he had seen much , but he had reflected more .
__label__1	The unwelcome visitors advanced into the middle of the room .
__label__0	I can understand that an Englishman should give up his life and his fortune for the honor of his country .
__label__1	And he told her the truth , too ; for his small heart swelled , and his face glowed , when he saw how much they all admired her , and how she was the beautiful little rosebud of the room .
__label__1	‘ So they used to say in that part of the country I come from , ’ observed <NAME> , complacently , ‘ but I think oil ’ s better. ’ ‘ Better than what ? ’ roared <NAME> , adding some rather strong language in an undertone .
__label__0	Yes , another moment , and , in my turn , I should have made a fool of myself .
__label__1	If she had remained here , sir , she would have improved , no doubt . ''
__label__1	‘ Now , I ask you , ’ said Mr Meagles in the blandest confidence , falling back a step himself , and handing his daughter a step forward to illustrate his question : ‘ I ask you simply , as between man and man , you know , DID you ever hear of such damned nonsense as putting <NAME> in quarantine ? ’ ‘ It has had the result of making even quarantine enjoyable. ’ ‘ Come ! ’ said Mr Meagles , ‘ that ’ s something to be sure .
__label__1	He stopped at <NAME> ’ s door , according to custom , and knocked to say good-night .
__label__1	‘ He ’ s in a cab , sir , at the door .
__label__0	They offered him a room , which he accepted without ceremony , in his frank and hearty way .
__label__0	It was Schroeter who in 1789 first drew attention to them .
__label__0	In short , the colonists had reason to be extremely satisfied , for this chest contained tools , weapons , instruments , clothes , books ; and this is the exact list of them as stated in <NAME> <NAME> 's note-book : -- Tools : -- 3 knives with several blades , 2 woodmen 's axes , 2 carpenter 's hatchets , 3 planes , 2 adzes , 1 twibil or mattock , 6 chisels , 2 files , 3 hammers , 3 gimlets , 2 augers , 10 bags of nails and screws , 3 saws of different sizes , 2 boxes of needles .
__label__1	The entreaties to remain were pressing , but <NAME> was inflexible .
__label__0	The misfortune that had befallen his telescope was a never-ending theme of complaint ; and just now , when <NAME> was entering the narrow zone of shooting-stars , and new discoveries might have been within his reach , his loss made him more inconsolable than ever .
__label__0	As he had no certainty , however , of any immediate danger , he did not wake his companions , who were sleeping soundly after their fatigue , and after a little dozed off himself , and slumbered heavily for some hours .
__label__1	Such a present of plate as you have made 'em , is enough to bring tears into anybody 's eyes .
__label__0	Soon after a rumour was spread of the discovery of a large river flowing in a north-westerly direction .
__label__1	You have no idea how the <NAME> of the country ( overlook the <NAME> nature of the phrase , and don ’ t be bored by it ) tends to being left alone .
__label__1	‘ Not this morning , ’ he said to the dog .
__label__1	His manner is the gravely impressive manner of a man who has not committed himself in life otherwise than as he has become the victim of a tender sorrow of the heart .
__label__0	At all events , the engineer only communicated his impressions to <NAME> , for he thought it useless to explain to his companions the suspicions which arose from what perhaps was only Top ’ s fancy .
__label__0	They were those of the convicts who , four months previously , had landed on <NAME> !
__label__1	`` And I ai n't took back to Tom-all-Alone 's .
__label__1	When she came there of an evening , she always shrunk from accepting his escort home , and ran away with me instead .
__label__1	All the passengers are very dismal , and seem to have tremendous secrets weighing on their minds .
__label__0	`` No , '' replied the mate , `` and the proof is that the others , drifting on , are leaving it behind ! ''
__label__1	What I have learned has left me doubting , misbelieving , despising , regretting , what I have not learned ; and my dismal resource has been to think that life would soon go by , and that nothing in it could be worth the pain and trouble of a contest. ’ ‘ And you so young , <NAME> ! ’ he said with pity .
__label__0	<NAME> had procured in the town some morsels of “ tchornekhleb , ” a sort of barley bread , and a little mead , called “ meod ” in <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Hi ! ’ cried the woman , raising a cracked voice .
__label__1	Evidently close at hand from the peculiar shock it communicated to the air , yet subdued as if it were far off .
__label__1	‘ I say , ’ he proceeded , ‘ Miss Dombey !
__label__0	<NAME> , born at <NAME> about 1465 , and brought up in the household of the <NAME> of <NAME> , had gained his first experience in arms in the wars against the Moors .
__label__1	`` What do you want , sir ? ''
__label__0	<NAME> had the skill to make the owners of his ships partake in the hope which he had conceived .
__label__1	<NAME> was a sight wondrous to behold , and full of matter , when , jauntily waving his double eye-glass by its ribbon , and jauntily drooping to an <NAME> , he , in the most accidental manner ever seen , found himself at Mr Merdle ’ s shoulder , and embraced that opportunity of mentioning a little point to him , on which he particularly wished to be guided by the light of his practical knowledge .
__label__1	The <NAME> , and other distinguished gentlemen crowded to render homage to the <NAME> Clubber ; and <NAME> stood bolt upright , and looked majestically over his black kerchief at the assembled company .
__label__1	Her mother had taken it rather as a disturbance than otherwise , to be visited , as she reclined upon her sofa ; young people , <NAME> felt herself all unfit for ; Sissy she had never softened to again , since the night when the stroller ’ s child had raised her eyes to look at <NAME> ’ s intended wife .
__label__1	<NAME> looked after him , but neither moved nor spoke for some time : when he broke what almost seemed the silence of stupefaction , by a scornful laugh .
__label__0	She never hesitated for an instant as to the course she should adopt , but determined to go to <NAME> immediately , to learn the best and worst .
__label__0	Until 1815 he remained with the army , but after the peace he employed his leisure in visiting <NAME> and <NAME> .
__label__1	The victim cried , but in a subdued manner as if she feared to raise her voice , and <NAME> , comforting herself with a pinch of snuff , ascended the stairs , just as <NAME> had safely reached the office .
__label__1	If there was any word of comfort that would be a solace to her in her dying hour , and only I possessed it , I wouldn ’ t part with it for <NAME> itself. ’ The mere vehemence of her words can convey , I am sensible , but a weak impression of the passion by which she was possessed , and which made itself articulate in her whole figure , though her voice , instead of being raised , was lower than usual .
__label__1	The real Banking-house by <NAME> , the real business of the past day , the real strong rooms , the real express sent after him , and the real message returned , would all be there .
__label__1	After <NAME> had got into bed , he lay awake for a long time , still bemoaning his analysis , and saying he knew it was all wrong , and they couldn ’ t have analysed a murderer worse , and -- how would Doctor Blimber like it if his pocket-money depended on it ?
__label__0	And lastly , were I a theologian , I would tell him that the scheme of the <NAME> , according to <NAME> , seems to be applicable , not merely to the earth , but to all the celestial worlds .
__label__1	‘ You ’ re one of the thort , <NAME> , that keepth a prethiouth thight of money out of the houthe .
__label__0	These English or <NAME> adventurers , established in the <NAME> of <NAME> , off the coast of <NAME> , had sworn implacable hatred to <NAME> .
__label__0	You understand that we have nothing to do here with projectiles weighing at most but half a ton . ''
__label__1	As to the ladies , they were already abed , behind the red curtain , which was carefully drawn and pinned up the centre ; though as every cough , or sneeze , or whisper , behind this curtain , was perfectly audible before it , we had still a lively consciousness of their society .
__label__0	However , about eleven o ’ clock , the wind fell , the sea went down , and the speed of the vessel , as she labored less , greatly increased .
__label__0	Why should I live longer , now that I have dispersed my existence over the earth ?
__label__1	'Then perhaps she 'll go off in that way , if you do n't make a row , ' said the young man .
__label__0	`` The ` Assumption ' can not last , '' replied <NAME> .
__label__0	`` Let us try to clear this mass of snow away , '' replied the captain .
__label__1	The young gentleman uttered this exultant sound with mysterious significance .
__label__1	Who 's the worse for the loss of a few things like these ?
__label__1	I don ’ t mind telling YOU , because we have always been favourites of each other ’ s , and because you are not like a Pa , but more like a sort of a younger brother with a dear venerable chubbiness on him .
__label__1	‘ Now with regard to the matter on which I , with the concurrence of these gentlemen , sent for you , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	Could there indeed be a better place than a dark and deep coal mine for the freaks of fairies , elves , goblins , and other actors in the fantastical dramas ?
__label__1	He will love and honour you as I will .
__label__0	So reasoned <NAME> and his comrades in the <NAME> mines .
__label__1	I don ’ t know what harm I may have brought about , but , great or little , I did it for you , <NAME> .
__label__0	`` At any rate , they have not tried ; still , I stand up for my countrymen .
__label__0	Oh , yes , I know , there was the loss of our schooner !
__label__1	For the reasons I have mentioned I would select you .
__label__1	My mother dropped her work , and arose hurriedly , but timidly I thought .
__label__1	For yourself , unfortunate girl , orphaned and degraded from the first of these evil anniversaries , pray daily that the sins of others be not visited upon your head , according to what is written .
__label__0	“ We are cut off ! ” cried <NAME> .
__label__0	`` I should like to know how people set about it , '' observed <NAME> incredulously .
__label__0	They are trimmed with velvet or some other ornament .
__label__1	`` Yes , yes , '' says the good old gentleman , reverting to his lesson of wisdom .
__label__0	This floating mass carried the <NAME> with it , in the midst of the ice-field , the edge of which could not be seen ; to provide for any accident that might happen , <NAME> had a large supply of provisions carried on deck , as well as materials for camping , clothing , and cover ; as <NAME> had done under similar circumstances , he surrounded the ship with hammocks filled with air to protect her from damage .
__label__0	His fourth voyage had increased geographical knowledge by the discovery of the <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , the <NAME> , with the coasts of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , Costa-Rica , <NAME> , and <NAME> , the <NAME> , and the Gulf of <NAME> .
__label__0	`` Is that your opinion , <NAME> ? ''
__label__0	<NAME> was named captain-general of the squadron , with unlimited powers .
__label__0	<NAME> to his well-known liberality , as much as to his reputation for courage , he gathered together 570 men , of about equal numbers of cavalry and infantry , with which he set out by land for <NAME> .
__label__0	“ But I don ’ t want to bother myself about whether it will be cold or not .
__label__1	I did not set this down as a discovery , rashly .
__label__0	Destitute of human inhabitants , <NAME> was now left to the tenancy of such birds and beasts as had escaped the recent promiscuous slaughter .
__label__0	In his hand was a branch of a tree , which served as a crook for this antediluvian shepherd .
__label__1	It ’ s not possible. ’ ‘ No , <NAME> ’ am , ’ said <NAME> ‘ No more did my Uncle ’ s child .
__label__0	According to the daily custom on board the <NAME> , its air should have been renewed four hours ago ; but I did not suffer much , although <NAME> had not yet made any demand upon his reserve of oxygen .
__label__1	Dear Mr Fledgeby , do sit down. ’ Dear Mr <NAME> did sit down , and satisfied himself ( or , judging from the expression of his countenance , <NAME> himself ) that nothing new had occurred in the way of whisker-sprout since he came round the corner from the <NAME> .
__label__1	“ Now you know me. ” ‘ With these words the apparition turned towards the baron , as if composing himself for a talk -- and , what was very remarkable , was , that he threw his cloak aside , and displaying a stake , which was run through the centre of his body , pulled it out with a jerk , and laid it on the table , as composedly as if it had been a walking-stick .
__label__1	‘ The opinion of those other branches of my family , ’ pursued Mrs. Micawber , ‘ is , that <NAME> should immediately turn his attention to coals. ’ ‘ To what , ma ’ am ? ’ ‘ To coals , ’ said Mrs. Micawber .
__label__1	But he is master of his own actions ; and upon that point ( which is not at all material ) I can ’ t speak positively. ’ The difference between papa ’ s being master of his own actions and Mr <NAME> ’ s being nothing of the sort , was forcibly expressed by <NAME> in her manner of stating the case .
__label__1	'He can not be hardened in vice , ' said <NAME> ; 'It is impossible . '
__label__1	‘ <NAME> ’ had taken her down into <NAME> for a wedding trip , and there she had seen my aunt , too ; and both my aunt and <NAME> were well , and they had all talked of nothing but me .
__label__1	We must know all about you. ’ ‘ Yes , my deary , but not through letter-writing , because letter-writing -- indeed , writing of most sorts hadn ’ t much come up for such as me when I was young .
__label__0	<NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , will gradually be abandoned , as well as <NAME> and the lower parts of <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Where are they , <NAME> : where are they ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , hush ! ’ replied <NAME> ; and as he assisted <NAME> to dress , he detailed the plan of action on which he proposed to enter .
__label__1	He ’ d have made a good ‘ un in our line , but it would have been too limited for him ; his genius would have busted all bonds , and coming over every obstacle , broke down all before it , till it erected itself into a monneyment of -- Well , I ’ ll think of the rest , and say it when conwenient. ’ Making a halt in his reflections at this place , <NAME> again put his glass to his lips , and drawing a dirty letter from his pocket , proceeded to con over its contents with the air of a man who had read it very often , and now refreshed his memory rather in the absence of better amusement than for any specific information .
__label__1	Bail you to any amount , and only charge half a crown .
__label__0	May heaven give us strength to enable us once more to revisit the light of day .
__label__1	As <NAME> moves about to execute this order , it appears that he is lame , though able to move very quickly .
__label__1	`` Really , I think I could do a greater thing than that if the need were pressing .
__label__1	If any bagman of that day could have caught sight of the little neck-or-nothing sort of gig , with a clay-coloured body and red wheels , and the vixenish , ill tempered , fast- going bay mare , that looked like a cross between a butcher ’ s horse and a twopenny post-office pony , he would have known at once , that this traveller could have been no other than <NAME> , of the great house of <NAME> and <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> .
__label__1	Gentlemen , we ’ ve port , sherry , cigars , and most excellent champagne .
__label__0	The <NAME> chain does not attain any very great height , the highest summit not being more than five thousand feet .
__label__1	After awhile , he began to remember a few disjointed fragments of what the judge had said : though it had seemed to him , at the time , that he could not hear a word .
__label__1	‘ Keep your mouth shut ! -- I want to know , you sir , whether you charge that there crime on <NAME> ? ’ ‘ If you ever do know , you won ’ t know now. ’ ‘ Perhaps you done it yourself ? ’ said <NAME> , with a threatening action .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> 's great-aunt conquered a confirmed habit of living into which she had fallen , and <NAME> became a part of our establishment .
__label__0	The coxswain said some words in his outlandish tongue , doubtless warning the men to keep on their guard .
__label__0	<NAME> waited impatiently for milder weather ; he frequently consulted the barometer , but no confidence could be placed in this instrument , which in these high latitudes seems to lose some of its customary accuracy ; in these regions there are many exceptions to the general laws of nature : for instance , a clear sky was not always accompanied by cold , nor did a fall of snow raise the temperature ; the barometer was uncertain , as many explorers in these seas have noticed ; it used to fall when the wind was from the north or east ; when low it foretold fine weather ; when high , rain or snow .
__label__1	‘ Halloa ! ’ he cried , calling him roughly back .
__label__0	It spread equally among all classes of citizens -- men of science , shopkeepers , merchants , porters , chair-men , as well as `` greenhorns , '' were stirred in their innermost fibres .
__label__1	But she was not to be so easily left .
__label__1	‘ There ’ s only one way in which money can be made of it , and that is by taking it to her .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , you Sir ! ’ shouted <NAME> fiercely .
__label__1	A joke ’ s a joke. ’ ‘ Upon my soul ! ’ said the whelp .
__label__1	I called <NAME> back , and when she came -- at first pretending to smile , but as she drew nearer to me , looking grieved -- I took her in my arms and said , `` It matters very little , <NAME> .
__label__1	“ You won ’ t scream ? ” said <NAME> doubtfully .
__label__0	I did not know a single word of the <NAME> language , and yet by a sort of mysterious instinct I understood what the guide had said .
__label__0	If my life is still useful to my people , and a miracle is necessary to save me , that miracle will be performed ; if not , I shall die !
__label__0	A few horses were also killed which had relapsed into a wild state since the departure of the colony founded by <NAME> .
__label__1	To say that she is flung down on her side in the waves , with her masts dipping into them , and that , springing up again , she rolls over on the other side , until a heavy sea strikes her with the noise of a hundred great guns , and hurls her back—that she stops , and staggers , and shivers , as though stunned , and then , with a violent throbbing at her heart , darts onward like a monster goaded into madness , to be beaten down , and battered , and crushed , and leaped on by the angry sea—that thunder , lightning , hail , and rain , and wind , are all in fierce contention for the mastery—that every plank has its groan , every nail its shriek , and every drop of water in the great ocean its howling voice—is nothing .
__label__0	He made his four hearty meals every day , regardless of the most persistent rolling and pitching on the part of the steamer ; and he played whist indefatigably , for he had found partners as enthusiastic in the game as himself .
__label__1	HE was not altered , but he was surprised to see how altered I was and appeared quite pleased .
__label__0	`` Such a journey , '' says Dumour in his funeral oration on D'Orbigny , `` in countries so different in their productions , climate , the character of their soil , and the manners and customs of their inhabitants , was necessarily full of ever fresh perils .
__label__1	What do you suppose ruined me , now ? ’ ‘ Wy , ’ said <NAME> , trimming the rush-light , ‘ I s ’ pose the beginnin ’ wos , that you got into debt , eh ? ’ ‘ <NAME> owed a farden , ’ said the cobbler ; ‘ try again. ’ ‘ Well , perhaps , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ you bought houses , wich is delicate English for goin ’ mad ; or took to buildin ’ , wich is a medical term for bein ’ incurable. ’ The cobbler shook his head and said , ‘ Try again. ’ ‘ You didn ’ t go to law , I hope ? ’ said <NAME> suspiciously .
__label__1	‘ Why , as to <NAME> , you see , ’ returned Mr Boffin , with his hand still to his chin , ‘ the odds are that <NAME> and me may never go upon the water .
__label__0	No greater distance north has ever been attained since <NAME> 's time , except on the <NAME> coast -- where <NAME> and <NAME> Islands were discovered , and where at this moment , as we write , <NAME> is exploring .
__label__1	‘ Now let us see , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	“ He ’ ll be colonel-major or brigadier-general some day. ” <NAME> seemed so enchanted that it would have been useless to express a contrary opinion , either to the profession of arms or the probable future of his children .
__label__1	He needed no persuasion , and was soon asleep .
__label__0	This friendly reception encouraged the naturalists to land and penetrate to the interior , in search of new plants and unknown productions .
__label__1	The Jew grinned ; and , making a low obeisance to <NAME> , took him by the hand , and hoped he should have the honour of his intimate acquaintance .
__label__1	As luck would have it , <NAME> ’ s friend was of a playful turn , and hearing <NAME> sigh , she took it into her head to rally the lovers on their lowness of spirits .
__label__1	‘ There is abundance of incident , sprightly dialogue , strongly-marked characters -- ’ ‘ -- All unavailing without a strict observance of the unities , sir , ’ returned <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> ’ t you pity <NAME> , and I won ’ t pity <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Ha ! ’ he said , ‘ I thought so .
__label__0	But see those piles there , with fragments of a tent hanging to them . ''
__label__0	In that latitude , the degree of longitude represents eight and forty miles .
__label__1	She bent over him softly , kissed him , and came to the table .
__label__1	They all open <NAME> ’ s work .
__label__1	The setting sun was glowing on the strange lady , over the garden-fence , and she came walking up to the door with a fell rigidity of figure and composure of countenance that could have belonged to nobody else .
__label__1	With an encouraging nod or two , he immediately went out to alter the arrangements , and left her by herself to follow as she had proposed .
__label__1	<NAME> ! ’ ‘ When shall I come to see you , Mr Boffin. ’ ‘ When you like .
__label__0	Therefore , if any representatives of animal life exist in the <NAME> , they must have taken refuge in those bottomless abysses where our eyes were unable to track them .
__label__1	Nelly , kneeling down beside the box , was soon busily engaged in her task , and accomplishing it to a miracle .
__label__1	he says we ’ re dear , ’ cried the oldest and ugliest teacher .
__label__1	‘ When you were sitting by her , ’ said I , ‘ you seemed to be no less her guardian angel than mine ; and you seem so now , Agnes. ’ ‘ A poor angel , ’ she returned , ‘ but faithful. ’ The clear tone of her voice , going straight to my heart , made it natural to me to say : ‘ The cheerfulness that belongs to you , <NAME> ( and to no one else that ever I have seen ) , is so restored , I have observed today , that I have begun to hope you are happier at home ? ’ ‘ I am happier in myself , ’ she said ; ‘ I am quite cheerful and light-hearted. ’ I glanced at the serene face looking upward , and thought it was the stars that made it seem so noble .
__label__0	The elephant , which its owner had reared , not for a beast of burden , but for warlike purposes , was half domesticated .
__label__0	These thoughts kept him busy all day ; that evening they encamped as usual , and each one took his turn at watching near these unknown lands .
__label__0	`` Have we been deceived by an illusion ? ''
__label__1	I came here some nine months before you ; I had had one crop before you came .
__label__0	<NAME> nothing more about that , or rather , say nothing more at all .
__label__0	The launch tossed helplessly about , now plunged into deep abysses , now oscillated on the pointed crest of a wave , inclining often at an angle of more than forty-five degrees .
__label__0	He was , in fact , a thorough <NAME> , adventurous , but not an adventurer ; a hare-brained fellow , a kind of <NAME> , only possessing relays of wings .
__label__1	Now I think of it , the gentleman who brought us to your house . ''
__label__1	It is just half a year since I first saw this delicate morsel , and , oh dear , what a delicate morsel it is !
__label__1	There was a bright moon , but it was behind the clouds .
__label__1	‘ Till it poured down like rain , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	Self-acting ink , that ‘ ere ; it ’ s wrote your mark upon the wall , old gen ’ l ’ m ’ n .
__label__0	said <NAME> , in a voice which betrayed his emotion .

__label__0	( 1 ) The legendary etymology of this piscatorial designation is <NAME> , the `` door-keeper , '' in allusion to <NAME> , who brought a fish said to be of that species , to our Lord at His command .
__label__1	‘ Where is my old pensioner all this while ?
__label__1	Where ’ s that there fresh lad , that nothing couldn ’ t tire nor put out , and that sparkled up and blushed so , when we joked him about <NAME> ’ s <NAME> , that he was beautiful to look at ?
__label__1	The other gentleman with him , in the red under-waistcoat and dark moustache , is the <NAME> <NAME> , his bosom friend .
__label__1	Keys turned , doors clashed , footsteps passed along distant passages : no cry was raised , or hurry made , that seemed unusual .
__label__0	And the two crouched on the piece of ice , which their weight detached from the floe .
__label__1	‘ Not a very old prisoner _that_ !
__label__1	<NAME> had done the <NAME> Head the honour to request that the supper should be choice and delicate .
__label__1	<NAME> there no other neck to clasp ; no other face to turn to ?
__label__1	Now , brother Ned , my dear fellow , I ’ m ready .
__label__1	Mr <NAME> was even graver than it was his custom to be , and quite silent .
__label__1	But , the lesser grindstone stood alone there in the calm morning air , with a red upon it that the sun had never given , and would never take away .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> , whom I can not report as prepossessing in appearance , and whose manner was grim , listened to the proceedings , as part of woman 's wrongs , with a disdainful face .
__label__0	In the wide open spot , for instance , connected on the south with vast continents and terminating in a point , it would be no easy matter to recognize the reversed image of the <NAME> , the <NAME> , and <NAME> .
__label__1	But according to my count , it 's ten times ten -- it 's a hundred o'clock .
__label__0	`` That 's <NAME> ; '' said M'Nicholl ; `` I know it well ; it 's the darkest spot on the Moon : many a night I gazed at it from my little observatory in <NAME> , <NAME> . ''
__label__0	To the northwest rose <NAME> , which concealed a great part of the horizon .
__label__1	It costs no more than any other plan of arrangement , but it speaks an amount of consideration for those who are reduced to seek a shelter there , which puts them at once upon their gratitude and good behaviour .
__label__0	They soon reached a narrow space , at the bottom of a deep ravine , and there a terrible sight met their eyes .
__label__0	It was needful to hurry as fast as possible from the gulf where the ships had so incautiously involved themselves .
__label__1	It ’ s very gratifying to think that we should have been the means of introducing her into such society , and I ’ m quite glad of it -- quite rejoiced -- for she certainly is an exceedingly well-behaved and good-natured little person .
__label__1	You have a noble nature , and <NAME> 's love may make you worthier every day . ''
__label__0	It was his own fancy to follow the trade of ‘ monk , ’ which few would have liked .
__label__0	He caught at it at once , and , placing his two hands upright at a distance of three inches one from the other , he made us understand that he meant to indicate the width of the little river which formed our watering place ; and then , holding them wider apart , he indicated that the second width was to represent that of the river <NAME> ; and , separating them still more , he gave the breadth of the strait which divides his country from <NAME> .
__label__1	The eyes were there , before he had laid himself along .
__label__0	<NAME> , in his joy on reaching at last the <NAME> continent , thought he would manifest it by executing a perilous vault in fine style ; but , tumbling upon some worm-eaten planks , he fell through them .
__label__0	They also , during this season , made fierce war against the jaguars .
__label__1	'You seem out of humour , <NAME> . '
__label__1	‘ The monk -- even the monk -- could bear with some grief here ; for it was long since these sisters had met , and there were furrows in their blanched faces which years could never plough .
__label__1	Having , as it were , taken formal possession of his clerkship in virtue of these proceedings , he opened the window and leaned negligently out of it until a beer-boy happened to pass , whom he commanded to set down his tray and to serve him with a pint of mild porter , which he drank upon the spot and promptly paid for , with the view of breaking ground for a system of future credit and opening a correspondence tending thereto , without loss of time .

__label__0	“ <NAME> , ” said <NAME> ; “ we have come to ask a favor. ” Imagining that at least half his property was to be confiscated , the Jew began to break out into his usual formula about being a poor man and having nothing to spare ; but <NAME> , without heeding his complainings , went on : “ We are not going to ruin you , you know. ” <NAME> looked keenly into the captain ’ s face .
__label__1	‘ How do we know whom he is deceiving there ?
__label__0	`` Do you want to be within a few miles of the Pole without being able to reach it ? ''
__label__1	She raised her veil , for an instant , while she preferred the inquiry , and disclosed a countenance of most uncommon beauty , though shaded by a cloud of sadness , which , in one so young , was doubly remarkable .
__label__1	very true , so they must ; very proper indeed ! ’ rejoined <NAME> with that sort of half-sigh , which , accompanied by two or three slight nods of the head , is pity ’ s small change in general society ; ‘ and that ’ s what I very often tell my brother , when our servants go away ill , one after another , and he thinks the back-kitchen ’ s rather too damp for ‘ em to sleep in .
__label__1	<NAME> recognised the sally in his usual way , and took in his provender in his usual way .
__label__1	<NAME> E. S. <NAME> was nominated and supported by <NAME> .
__label__1	What her pitiful look saw , at that early time , in her father , in her sister , in her brother , in the jail ; how much , or how little of the wretched truth it pleased God to make visible to her ; lies hidden with many mysteries .
__label__1	Drawing forth two very small scraps of paper , he proceeded -- ‘ And now , gentlemen , but one word more .
__label__1	<NAME> bowed , said he was very well , and seemed very much astonished at the outward appearance of the proprietor of <NAME> Hall : as indeed he was .
__label__1	He was quiet and attentive ; watched the opening proceedings with a grave interest ; and stood with his hands resting on the slab of wood before him , so composedly , that they had not displaced a leaf of the herbs with which it was strewn .
__label__0	It was then four o ’ clock in the afternoon , and from the poop the passengers could see the quartermaster gazing at the ship , standing with folded arms on a rock , motionless as a statue .
__label__0	<NAME> , defended by the three brothers <NAME> with but 170 Spaniards , was exposed for eight consecutive months to the incessant attacks of the Peruvians , who had now become expert in the use of the arms which they had taken from their enemies .
__label__1	And so she said to me , did I know the way to the burying ground ?
__label__1	`` And you are to go down at twelve ? ''
__label__1	The <NAME> is as yet unable to elaborate a scheme for winning <NAME> , but his first idea has gained possession of him , and he thinks the doubling up of Mr Dombey would be a move in the right direction .
__label__1	‘ However , ’ said that fascinating gentleman , wiping his eyes again , ‘ if we go on in this way , we shall seem to be almost making game of Mr Riah , or of <NAME> and Co. Saint Mary Axe , or of somebody : which is far from our intention .
__label__1	‘ There ’ s no more to tell , <NAME> .
__label__1	When I first had the happiness of looking upon you , it was one fifteen , and had stood at that figure for a lengthened period .
__label__1	“ Time 's up , ” said <NAME> , “ and I must be off .
__label__1	But I was bound to try everything , you know , with such a charge upon my hands .
__label__1	He ’ s my brother. ’ ‘ He ’ s MY brother ! ’ cried the preacher .
__label__0	I remained thus until six in the morning , without <NAME> noticing me .
__label__0	`` Where can they have gone to ? ''
__label__1	The reason is all mine , I do not insinuate that it is in any way yours. ’ ‘ Well , sir , ’ she returned , repeating a little less haughtily than before her former invitation to him to be seated : to which he now deferred , as she seated herself .
__label__0	`` Nothing is more easy than to reduce this mass to one quarter of its bulk .
__label__0	But on this occasion , instead of <NAME> , an old and extinct volcano , we were inside a mountain of fire in full activity .
__label__0	Well , arranging these letters in a column , one under the other , and then placing against them the letters of my name and deducting one from the other the numbers of their places in alphabetical order , I see the following result : <NAME> _n_ and _j_ we have 4 letters “ Now what is the column of ciphers made up of that we have got by this simple operation ?
__label__1	But I can ’ t think about the lesson .
__label__0	I can affirm that no later than last evening an author was seen bending over his desk , holding in one hand an open volume of the `` Spectator , '' while with the other he was thawing his ink by the flame of the lamp .
__label__1	But I feel it , I do feel it , although I am disgusted. ’ Miss Knag here relapsed into softness , and the young ladies renewing their attentions , murmured that she ought to be superior to such things , and that for their part they despised them , and considered them beneath their notice ; in witness whereof , they called out , more emphatically than before , that it was a shame , and that they felt so angry , they did , they hardly knew what to do with themselves .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> was not even ambitious of a higher rise ; he did not want to make a fortune ; he did not concern himself with the buying or selling of cargoes ; but everything connected with that admirable instrument a sailing ship , <NAME> understood to perfection .
__label__1	the only neighbouring thing at all akin to the other little captives , some of whom , shrinking from the hot hands of drunken purchasers , lie drooping on the path already , while others , soddened by close contact , await the time when they shall be watered and freshened up to please more sober company , and make old clerks who pass them on their road to business , wonder what has filled their breasts with visions of the country .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> was in the last degree amazed and disconcerted at sight of <NAME> , and had murmured involuntarily , ‘ Look here !
__label__0	`` Well , young or old , '' added <NAME> , `` he 's a good capture . ''
__label__1	As she read on , years seemed to fall away from her son like the imaginings of a dream , and all the old dark horrors of his usual preparation for the sleep of an innocent child to overshadow him .
__label__0	<NAME> had his long boat lowered , and got into it with <NAME> and <NAME> , the comptroller <NAME> , the secretary <NAME> , and some others .
__label__0	Now the wool furnished by the musmons was composed of very short hairs , and was in a good condition to be felted .
__label__1	That this correspondence with the public enemy was not a correspondence of to-day , or of yesterday , or even of last year , or of the year before .
__label__1	I was very angry with him indeed , for the first time in my life , but it only lasted a moment .
__label__1	He seemed to be the only restless thing , except the clocks , in the whole motionless house .
__label__1	Why , _the_ mill -- the mill as takes up so little room that it 'll work inside a Stone Jug ; and always goes better when the wind 's low with people , than when it 's high ; acos then they ca n't get workmen .
__label__1	He had been , in his own person , connected with the incident he so pathetically described ; he had been by name remembered and commended in close association with it ; and his fortunes must have a particular interest in his employer ’ s eyes .
__label__0	They would not start , therefore , until the morning of the 27th .
__label__0	It was completely desert ; not so much as a single point of rock relieved the bare uniformity of its surface .
__label__1	<NAME> as the young man was of all wrong , every artful insinuation stung , every well-considered sarcasm cut him to the quick ; and when <NAME> noted his pale face and quivering lip , he hugged himself to mark how well he had chosen the taunts best calculated to strike deep into a young and ardent spirit .
__label__0	`` He appears young , and will be easy to educate , and we shall not be obliged to use force to subdue him , nor draw his teeth , as is sometimes done .
__label__1	To <NAME> and <NAME> , and into <NAME> .
__label__0	`` Three cheers for the <NAME> ! ''
__label__1	On his way home , on the evening he set aside for this momentous purpose , he took the precaution of stepping into a chemist ’ s shop and buying a bottle of the very strongest smelling-salts .
__label__1	I know she is here with me. ’ ‘ Then , ma ’ am , ’ said Mr Meagles , ‘ allow me to make known to you that I shall be happy to have her back , and that my wife and daughter will be happy to have her back .
__label__1	His tone lingered in the air , almost like the tone of a musical instrument .
__label__1	<NAME> , my second ( ten and a half ) , is the child who contributed two and nine-pence to the <NAME> .
__label__0	Never yet had any <NAME> wintered in these regions , in the midst of that slothful and immovable sea , which according to the very false expressions used by <NAME> , forms the girdle of the world , and in which is heard the uproar caused by the rising of the sun .
__label__1	The <NAME> assisted in the conversation , like a regular member of the establishment .
__label__0	They themselves were but castaways , but it was to be feared that another might not have been so fortunate , and their duty was to go to his succor .
__label__1	NOW lift me , my love. ’ <NAME> very softly raised the weather-stained grey head , and lifted her as high as <NAME> .
__label__1	He was a chance acquaintance , made abroad. ’ ‘ A chance acquaintance made abroad ! ’ she repeated .
__label__1	<NAME> ill , sir ? ’ Mr <NAME> had staggered up , with his lower jaw dropped , catching <NAME> by the shoulder , and pointing to the half-door .
__label__1	The falser he , the truer <NAME> ; the meaner he , the nobler <NAME> .
__label__0	This was the case with <NAME> , <NAME> , and that unknown orb which was moving in the orbit of the minor planets ; but <NAME> , on the other hand , had assumed splendid proportions ; <NAME> was superb in its luster , and <NAME> , which hitherto had been imperceptible without a telescope was pointed out by <NAME> , plainly visible to the naked eye .
__label__1	‘ It was very cruel , I know , ’ she said , still looking out -- and said with such calm disdain , that the Major was discomfited , and could think of nothing in reply .
__label__1	Within a few more minutes he is reported as sending his respects , and could my Lady please to receive him for a word or two after her dinner ?
__label__0	A few years later <NAME> d'Urville gave the name of <NAME> to the group .
__label__0	It is therefore not astonishing that many of his assertions were either rectified or denied after this more careful exploration .
__label__0	`` Any one else would have found it open , '' cried <NAME> ; `` that <NAME> , that -- '' `` Come , <NAME> , '' said the doctor , purposely interrupting him , `` it 's now only the 5th of <NAME> ; we should not despair ; a path may open before us suddenly ; you know the ice often breaks into separate pieces , even when the weather is calm , as if it were driven apart by some force of repulsion ; at any moment we may find the sea free .

__label__1	“ In that more peaceful state , I have imagined her , in the moonlight , coming to me and taking me out to show me that the home of her married life was full of her loving remembrance of her lost father .
__label__1	For many years the persistent <NAME> has been pointing , with no particular meaning , from that ceiling .
__label__1	Be careful , <NAME> , be careful .
__label__0	This was a mere phantom of my fancy !
__label__0	Being unable to go up <NAME> , he determined to go around Prince of <NAME> , to reach <NAME> Channel .

__label__0	<NAME> , after his marriage with the niece of the <NAME> de <NAME> , who belonged to one of the first families in <NAME> , accompanied the emperor , who was on his way to <NAME> , to the port of embarkation ; but the general , soon becoming tired of the frivolities of a court , so little in accordance with the active habits of his past life , set out again for <NAME> in 1530 , and landed at <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> ’ s to the brim too .
__label__0	Before this province of <NAME> belonged to Kublaï-Khan it was governed by a very pacific king , who shunned war , and was very merciful to all his subjects .
__label__1	“ I see that I hold a sanctuary in their hearts , and in the hearts of their descendants , generations hence .
__label__0	Top held him up by his clothes ; but a strong current seized him and drove him towards the north , and after half an hour of exertion , he sank , dragging Top with him into the depths .
__label__1	cried <NAME> , to all appearance much relieved .
__label__0	It is the height of the tide , and I am anxious to study its curious phenomena . ''
__label__1	<NAME> stepped forward to hand her to the Pill-Box which was at the service of all the Pills in <NAME> Court <NAME> ; and she got into that vehicle with distinguished serenity , and was driven away .
__label__1	The panic-stricken men pointed to where such articles were kept ; the murderer , hastily selecting the longest and strongest cord , hurried up to the house-top .
__label__1	<NAME> is not a very comfortable lodging , but perhaps I thought it less so when I first saw it than you would have done , because you have been in many different countries and have seen many different customs .
__label__1	'The very same man I told you of , who came so suddenly upon me at the inn , ' said <NAME> .
__label__0	we ought always to treat an adversary with respect ; rest assureed if <NAME> is still alive we shall find him all the more easily ; because if he has not , like you , been amusing himself with freeing oppressed birds , he must be looking for _you_ .
__label__0	He evidently heard and understood , but no less evidently was he strangely determined not to speak to the colonists ; for one evening , <NAME> , listening at the door of his room , heard these words escape from his lips : -- `` No !
__label__1	On the table before him , stood a pot of ale , a cold round of beef , and a very respectable-looking loaf , to each of which he distributed his favours in turn , with the most rigid impartiality .
__label__1	Let him remember it in that room , years to come .
__label__1	Some indication of a neck being developed in him by these means , he and the sharer of his life 's evening again fronting one another in their two porter 's chairs , like a couple of sentinels long forgotten on their post by the <NAME> , <NAME> .
__label__1	The space before the prison was cleared , and a few strong barriers , painted black , had been already thrown across the road to break the pressure of the expected crowd , when <NAME> and <NAME> appeared at the wicket , and presented an order of admission to the prisoner , signed by one of the sheriffs .
__label__1	Oh , <NAME> ! ’ cried <NAME> , putting her hands before her face , as her tears started on it , ‘ I almost feel as if I had been papa ’ s enemy , instead of his loving child .
__label__0	`` On my word , <NAME> , I am your man , '' answered <NAME> ; `` and although I think your plan a very bold one , you can count on me to the end . ''
__label__0	At this juncture , thirty of the crew became incapable of performing their duty .
__label__0	<NAME> vapour , forming a kind of crown of smoke , is emitted from it , whilst the atmosphere at the bottom is perfectly cool .
__label__0	He started up , and went toward the wood ; but what was his surprise to perceive a purely natural phenomenon !
__label__1	They asked me a good many questions ; as , what my name was , how old I was , where I lived , how I was employed , and how I came there .
__label__1	`` He is not in the way to do so now , my dear , '' replied my guardian .
__label__0	The pieces which were cut off soon encumbered the hut .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> , the passenger , shaking himself out of it in chains of straw , a tangle of shaggy wrapper , flapping hat , and muddy legs , was rather like a larger sort of dog .
__label__0	There was no longer any doubt as to the pirates ’ intentions .
__label__1	`` I would like to kiss her ! ''
__label__0	He much feared that his anticipations would again be disappointed .
__label__1	`` Better now , '' quoth <NAME> , motioning the lawyer to sit down and read to him alone .
__label__0	Still I wished to go forward .
__label__1	‘ But let me go on thinking the facts out , and avoid confusing them with my speculations .
__label__1	Their need for watching one another should be over now , but they do it all this time , and the stars watch them both through the opened window .
__label__1	He had scarcely time to take down his canister , and stealthily convey some money into the hands of <NAME> , his former favourite , and <NAME> , who had the claim upon him that he was naturally of a maritime build , before the <NAME> was abandoned by them all ; and <NAME> whispering that he ’ d carry on smart , and hail <NAME> again before he went aboard , shut the door upon himself , as the last member of the party .

__label__1	Dash it , <NAME> , '' says that gentleman , `` you really ought to be careful how you wound the feelings of a man who has an unrequited image imprinted on his 'eart and who is <NAME> altogether happy in those chords which vibrate to the tenderest emotions .
__label__1	‘ Stop a minute , ’ said <NAME> ; ‘ I wos a-going to say , he always brings now , a flat bottle as holds about a pint and a half , and fills it vith the pine-apple rum afore he goes avay. ’ ‘ And empties it afore he comes back , I s ’ pose ? ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	they are firing at us ! ''
__label__0	Round the Nautilus the sea dashed furiously .
__label__0	This popular error as to distance had the happy effect of inducing navigators to try to cross the <NAME> , a feat which , had they been aware of the 15,000 miles of ocean separating <NAME> from <NAME> , they would scarcely have dared to attempt .
__label__0	On the table lay also a volume which had been read and re-read a hundred times .
__label__0	DURING <NAME> FEW days which followed nothing occurred worthy of note .
__label__0	The colonists were desirous of reaching the plain upon which the superior cone of <NAME> had fallen , but the lava arrested their progress .
__label__1	If you should ever get so far as this in this long letter , you will perhaps say , Surely Little <NAME> will not leave off without telling me something about her travels , and surely it is time she did .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , passing his hand over his forehead and turning suddenly round , as though the subject but that moment flashed upon him , ‘ what has become of <NAME> ? ’ He had been sentenced to transportation for a great many years , she said .
__label__1	My mind flew back to <NAME> ; and could it be <NAME> , I thought , who used to draw the skeletons !
__label__1	If you had brought up your adopted daughter wholly in the dark confinement of these rooms , and had never let her know that there was such a thing as the daylight by which she had never once seen your face , -- if you had done that , and then , for a purpose had wanted her to understand the daylight and know all about it , you would have been disappointed and angry ? ” <NAME> , with her head in her hands , sat making a low moaning , and swaying herself on her chair , but gave no answer .
__label__0	Down at the bottom of it all there is some appearance of truth ; and you see that they were right about the sources of the Nile. ” “ Nothing could be more correct , ” said <NAME> .
__label__0	The vapor whirled in the air to an immeasurable height , as if the valves of an immense boiler had been suddenly opened .
__label__0	Another cry , this time a perfect howl , answered him .
__label__0	`` Not at such a latitude .
__label__1	My only other remembrances of the great festival are , That they would n't let me go to sleep , but whenever they saw me dropping off , woke me up and told me to enjoy myself .
__label__1	The bronze face , the shaggy black hair and beard , the coarse woollen red cap , the rough medley dress of home-spun stuff and hairy skins of beasts , the powerful frame attenuated by spare living , and the sullen and desperate compression of the lips in sleep , inspired the mender of roads with awe .
__label__0	“ Poor child ! ” he thought to himself .
__label__1	If it had ever been meant to be lived in , I might have thought it small , or inconvenient , or lonely ; but never having been designed for any such use , it became a perfect abode .
__label__0	“ Very good ; you may groom them and saddle them as quickly as you like .
__label__0	Notwithstanding his fatalism , and though resigned , he would not believe himself in safety until within the walls of <NAME> .
__label__0	At this moment the young girl observed , by the light which the chafing-dish cast upon <NAME> 's face , that despair and determination were struggling in his rough features for the mastery .
__label__0	And ever since that day she has seen in her dreams the fiery commissary , enfolding her in an impassioned embrace !
__label__0	<NAME> tufts of grass bordered the shining pavement , and no one would have thought of tearing them away , for they deadened the noise made by the passers-by .
__label__0	<NAME> and <NAME> dragged the bellows on a hurdle ; also a quantity of vegetables and animals , which they besides could renew on the way .
__label__0	The layers of ice melted as if by enchantment ; and immediately , for economy 's sake , the gas was put out , the air apparatus alone consuming its usual quantity .
__label__1	‘ He sought the pig with all the ardour of their early friendship -- but , alas !
__label__0	The number of icebergs coming from the nor'-west was therefore increasing ; there were now a hundred of them , and a collision with any of these might have a most disastrous result .
__label__1	‘ I thought it was “ adore. ” ’ ‘ “ Love , ” my dear , ’ retorted <NAME> .
__label__1	For , it would seem that <NAME> must always be taken early ; though whether for any more distinctly stomachic reason than that , as the early bird catches the worm , so the early purl catches the customer , can not here be resolved .
__label__0	<NAME> would say what he had to say , and then he held his peace .
__label__0	If any difficulty should arise on sea , give us warning by firing three shots . ''
__label__1	‘ But WERE you ever married , <NAME> ? ’ says I .
__label__1	‘ Is it possible , sir , ’ said Mr Dorrit , reddening excessively , ‘ that you have -- ha -- had the audacity to place one of my rooms at the disposition of any other person ? ’ Thousands of pardons !
__label__1	`` He appears to be an excellent master , '' I observed .
__label__1	‘ Not vary ! ’ repeated <NAME> , raising his eyes to the ceiling .
__label__0	I naturally led up the conversation to the giant unicorn , and examined the various chances of success or failure of the expedition .
__label__1	That ’ s flat. ’ So saying , <NAME> slipped into a tall empty closet which opened with two half doors , and shut himself up ; intending to slip out directly <NAME> was safe inside his own room .
__label__1	I chose it as a conspicuous part of the house .
__label__1	He drank deeply of it , and throwing his aching limbs upon the bank , sank into a delicious trance .
__label__1	He did so ; and , by the light of the lamps , saw the girl 's retreating figure , already at some distance before him .
__label__0	It is quite incomprehensible. ” A moment afterwards the noise of wheels and whip showed that the berlin , drawn by the tarantass ’ horses , was driving rapidly away from the post-house .
__label__1	But , despite the punch and the manager , who told a variety of stories , and smoked tobacco from a pipe , and inhaled it in the shape of snuff , with a most astonishing power , <NAME> was absent and dispirited .
__label__0	Of this , however , there was now no trace ; the <NAME> of <NAME> had been replaced by a vast expanse of water , which had at first all the appearance of being utterly desert ; but on the following morning the explorers unexpectedly sighted a little island , which , unless it should prove , as was only too likely , to be of recent origin they concluded , from its situation , must be a portion of the northernmost territory of <NAME> .
__label__0	On the 10th of December , a week after his return to <NAME> , <NAME> saw the stranger approaching , who , in a calm voice and humble tone , said to him : “ <NAME> , I have a request to make of you. ” “ Speak , ” answered the engineer , “ but first let me ask you a question. ” At these words the stranger reddened , and was on the point of withdrawing .
__label__0	Now let us say that it signifies _a_ or _o. ” _ After this was done , the judge found out the letter which recurred most frequently after _h , _ and so on , and he formed the following table : _h_ = 23 times _d p q_ = 16 -- _g v_ = 13 -- _o r x z_ = 12 -- _f s_ = 10 -- _e k l m n_ = 9 -- _j t_ = 8 -- _b i_ = 8 -- _a c_ = 8 -- “ Now the letter _a_ only occurs thrice ! ” exclaimed the judge , “ and it ought to occur the oftenest .
__label__0	After traveling fully half a <NAME> mile , we had met neither a farmer at the door of his hut , nor even a wandering shepherd with his wild and savage flock .
__label__1	Was it quite consistent , in candour , with our taking that resolution against Mr Fledgeby , that you should afterwards address Mr Fledgeby as your dear and confidential friend , and entreat a favour of Mr Fledgeby ?
__label__1	A team of horses couldn ’ t draw her back now ; the bolts and bars of the old <NAME> couldn ’ t keep her. ’ ‘ How did it happen ?
__label__1	‘ A very good fellow indeed ! ’ returned <NAME> .
__label__1	Therefore , the constable , still holding Kit in the same manner , and pushing him on a little before him , so as to keep him at about three-quarters of an arm ’ s length in advance ( which is the professional mode ) , thrust him into the vehicle and followed himself .
__label__0	Their eyes could not pierce through the thick mist which had gathered beneath the car .
__label__0	The caulking operations were completed , and also the slide for lowering the vessel to the base of our floating mountain .
__label__1	It was after much consideration of this fact , and much pondering over such an unfortunate combination of circumstances , that a bright idea occurred to the <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> reviving the notion of the ball , would be scouted as a malignant idiot .
__label__1	'Ca n't you look at the gentleman , you obstinate boy ? '
__label__0	And then he had the curiosity to examine this flaw with a strong magnifier which he unscrewed from one of the telescopes .
__label__0	<NAME> calculated the quantity of spirits of wine overflowed into the little vial soldered to the lower part of the instrument , and said : `` A hundred and forty degrees <NAME> [ 4 ] below zero ! ''
__label__1	`` Never have a mission , my dear child . ''
__label__0	The danger lies there , and a terrible danger ! ''
__label__1	Have you dined with <NAME> yet ? ” “ Not yet. ” “ Well , ” said <NAME> , “ he 'll give you wine , and good wine .
__label__1	I feared you would think too much of what passed here just now .
__label__1	<NAME> , I beg your pardon ; this is my friend <NAME> .
__label__1	What are you stopping for ? ” said I .
__label__1	She looked away at the river , as she walked with her hands folded before her ; and that was all he could make of her without showing his face .
__label__0	Would Feofar-Khan , satisfied with his first success , wait some time before marching on <NAME> ?
__label__1	She was in town , but not at home , having gone to <NAME> directly after breakfast on some Borrioboolan business , arising out of a society called the <NAME> <NAME> .
__label__1	Do you think you can degrade , or bend or break , me to submission and obedience ? ’ Mr <NAME> smiled , as he might have smiled at an inquiry whether he thought he could raise ten thousand pounds .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> ’ s half sorry he advised you now .
__label__0	But it is not enough to have kicked him out .
__label__0	Matters being thus decided , the building of a vessel large enough to sail either to the <NAME> in the north , or to <NAME> in the west , was no longer talked of , and they busied themselves in their accustomed occupations , with a view to wintering a third time in <NAME> .
__label__1	Why , <NAME> ’ r <NAME> , you was but the heighth of the littlest of these , when I first see you !
__label__0	How long I remained buried in this drowsiness I can not judge , but , when I woke , the sun seemed sinking towards the horizon .
__label__0	As my uncle spoke , we reached the sandy shore , and saw and heard the waves breaking monotonously on the beach .
__label__1	But <NAME> , with her lips only , shaping the two words , ‘ Her father , ’ he delayed no longer .
__label__1	The person who does copying . ''
__label__0	The situation did not change in the least , though a discovery I suddenly made seemed to complicate it very much .
__label__0	We had no time to make reflections ; it was above everything necessary to get out of our dangerous anchorage , to which the rapidity of the current was a great obstacle . ''
__label__0	`` They are already laying the pipes , and the works are entirely completed . ''
__label__1	‘ So your name ’ s <NAME> , eh ? ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	Then <NAME> decided energetically that they should at once set about devising means of safety .
__label__0	substituted for the `` Cape of <NAME> , '' the name of the `` Cape of <NAME> , '' for he saw that now the route to <NAME> was open at last , and his vast plans for the extension of the commerce and influence of his country were about to be realized .
__label__1	He has the faded appearance of a gentleman in embarrassed circumstances ; even his light whiskers droop with something of a shabby air .
__label__0	<NAME> will represent <NAME> or <NAME> ; the <NAME> , <NAME> or <NAME> ; while I , as <NAME> , the newly born goddess of <NAME> , floating gracefully over you both , extend my hands so , fondly patronizing the one , but grandly ordering off the other , to the regions of eternal night !
__label__1	He appeared to have settled into his original foundation , like a building ; and I must confess that my faith in his ever Moving , was not much greater than if he had been a building .
__label__1	You are a young man that I should like to put in the witness-box , to humanise the minds of the legal profession .
__label__0	It is quite possible that one of these animals , surprised by the inundation , might have climbed up into this OMBU , and be hiding now among its thick foliage. ” “ You haven ’ t met any of them , at any rate , I suppose ? ” said the Major .
__label__0	<NAME> ’ s life hung on a thread , and this thread might break at any moment .
__label__0	The little band left the cavern and began to ascend through the dark passage .
__label__0	I struggled with him and tried to force him away .
__label__1	Naturally , therefore , a funeral with this uncommon attendance excited him greatly , and he asked of the first man who ran against him : “ What is it , brother ?
__label__1	‘ Thank you , my lord , ’ said Mr <NAME> ; ‘ thank you .
__label__1	It is more than probable , I think , that the gentleman may not relish my company ; and although I am the dusty figure you see , I am too proud to thrust myself into his. ’ ‘ Lord love you , ’ said the landlord , ‘ it ’ s only <NAME> ; HE isn ’ t particular. ’ ‘ Is he not ? ’ asked <NAME> , on whose mind , to tell the truth , the prospect of the savoury pudding was making some impression .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , I were never good at showin o ’ t , though I ha had ’ n my share in feeling o ’ t .
__label__0	Now , reserving for another discussion the means of producing this velocity , I will call your attention to the dimensions which it will be proper to assign to the shot .
__label__0	It required immense courage to rise by means of those frail envelopes which only contained heated air .
__label__1	She ’ s extremely sorry to lose you , Mr <NAME> , but a sense of her duty to society reconciles her .
__label__1	To me , the remembrance of our last parting has been ever mournful and painful. ” “ But you said to me , ” returned <NAME> , very earnestly , “ 'God bless you , God forgive you ! '
__label__1	‘ Your lovely woman was told her fortune to night on her way home .
__label__1	‘ You know forty-seven songs , ’ said the man , with a gravity which admitted of no altercation on the subject .
__label__1	<NAME> , no less steadily , kept them in sight .
__label__1	You remember the night when I first looked in here , and found you floating your powerful mind in tea ? ’ Still swilling tea , Mr <NAME> nodded assent .
__label__0	He had stated that he would reach the <NAME> !
__label__0	As it happened , the King of <NAME> , <NAME> , soon after marched against the town of <NAME> .
__label__1	In the grammar of Mrs Merdle ’ s verbs on this momentous subject , there was only one mood , the <NAME> ; and that <NAME> had only one Tense , the Present .
__label__0	The pirogues were full of women , who might vie with most Europeans in pleasant features , and who certainly excelled them in beauty of form . ''
__label__1	The shape of every branch and twig is expressed in a deep red glow , and as the light wind stirs and ruffles it , they seem to vegetate in fire .
__label__1	‘ A fool of <NAME> ! ’ exclaimed <NAME> .
__label__1	She said no more at the time ; but she presently stopped and looked at me again ; and presently again ; and after that , looked frowning and moody .
__label__0	But neither the unfortunate vessel nor her crew was destined ever to return to <NAME> .
__label__1	So I reversed my previous answer , and sat down to dinner in ten minutes afterwards ; and a capital dinner it was .
__label__0	There they found an empty house , the door wide open .
__label__1	<NAME> at her now , my <NAME> , how she turns upon her poor old mother with her looks. ’ As <NAME> drew her purse out with a trembling hand , and eagerly fumbled for some money , which the other old woman greedily watched for -- their heads all but touching , in their hurry and decrepitude -- <NAME> interposed : ‘ I have seen you , ’ addressing the old woman , ‘ before. ’ ‘ Yes , my <NAME> , ’ with a curtsey .
__label__1	Do not keep me here , but let me go at once .
__label__1	<NAME> knows , <NAME> , it is a lenient and considerate one , when we remember all ! ’ ‘ If it be lenient and considerate to punish you at all , <NAME> , for the misdeed of another , ’ she replied gently , ‘ yes. ’ ‘ We have been an ill-omened race to him , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	`` Tony , '' he says hurriedly to his astonished companion , `` let us be quick in putting the things together and in getting out of this place .
__label__1	‘ The duty done , and act of reparation performed , which can alone enable me to contemplate my fellow mortal , I shall be known no more .
__label__0	`` Well , '' said <NAME> , `` let 's go find the commander ; I 'll undertake to tell him . ''
__label__0	The fur company established at <NAME> at the mouth of the <NAME> also did much towards the exploration of the <NAME> .
__label__1	Such were Mr Quilp ’ s first proceedings on entering upon his new property .
__label__0	`` Yes , '' answered <NAME> ; `` but entering is not all , we have got to get out of it too . ''
__label__1	I openly say , unpalatable as it may be , that I consider <NAME> 's affairs in a very bad way , that I consider <NAME> C. himself in a very bad way , and that I regard this as an exceedingly ill-advised marriage .
__label__0	His new freight represented fifty pounds , and he rated it far below the two hundred tons of cured hides which were stowed away in his hold .
__label__1	‘ It ’ s new to you , I believe ? ’ said this <NAME> , when <NAME> had extolled the place .
__label__1	At the <NAME> ’ s <NAME> , the gallant steed , the <NAME> ’ s ark , yellow bird , and the officer in the <NAME> , were made as welcome as their child-owner .
__label__1	Say no more , <NAME> , say no more , my child .
__label__1	The bank is very steep , and was slippery with rain , and half-melted ice .
__label__1	He had no particular design or plan before him : no energetic wickedness ruffled his lassitude .
__label__1	No book , no work , no occupation of any kind but her own thought , beguiled the tardy time .
__label__1	‘ The frolicsome youth of the neighbourhood , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ whom I should be delighted to pitch from this elevation into the churchyard below , without any intermediate ceremonies , have probably turned the lamp out .
__label__1	‘ May I be allowed , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , turning his white teeth on Mrs <NAME> like a light -- ‘ a lady of your excellent sense and quick feeling will give me credit , for good reason , I am sure -- to address what I have to say , to Mrs Dombey , and to leave her to impart it to you who are her best and dearest friend -- next to Mr Dombey ? ’ Mrs <NAME> would have retired , but <NAME> stopped her .
__label__1	And however far off that may be , I will never tire of trying .
__label__1	Come straight to the stolen money ! ’ ‘ Wretch that you are , ’ she answered , and now her hands clasped her head : ‘ through what fatal error of <NAME> ’ s , through what incompleteness on his part , who was the only other person helping in these things and trusted with them , through whose and what bringing together of the ashes of a burnt paper , you have become possessed of that codicil , I know no more than how you acquired the rest of your power here -- ’ ‘ And yet , ’ interrupted <NAME> , ‘ it is my odd fortune to have by me , in a convenient place that I know of , that same short little addition to the will of <NAME> , written by a lady and witnessed by the same lady and our old intriguer !
__label__0	<NAME> , the naturalist , an officer named <NAME> , and <NAME> landed alone and unarmed , running the risk of being maltreated .
__label__0	A fine breeze and a fair sea , and our shirts for a sail . ''
__label__1	Hearing a footstep and the rustle of a dress , the <NAME> turned with a palpitating remembrance of the dreadful Mrs MacStinger , at the instant when <NAME> made a motion with her hand towards him , reeled , and fell upon the floor .
__label__1	And I know <NAME> thought so too .
__label__1	‘ There is no hope for you .
__label__1	‘ Wot ’ s the matter now ? ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> 's eye could take in the whole extent in an easy sweep from the <NAME> to the <NAME> , thus embracing within one glance not only the two polar stars of the present day , but also <NAME> and <NAME> , which , by reason of the _precession of the <NAME> , are to be our polar stars 12,000 years hence .
__label__0	The pilot alone , standing in the bow , showed his tall stature , scarcely defined in the earlier shadows .
__label__1	There appearing to be no other door on that floor , and the keeper of the wine-shop going straight to this one when they were left alone , <NAME> asked him in a whisper , with a little anger : “ Do you make a show of <NAME> ? ” “ I show him , in the way you have seen , to a chosen few. ” “ Is that well ? ” “ _I_ think it is well. ” “ Who are the few ?
__label__0	Long before he had spoken his last words , they had once more become mute as statues , and now were both eagerly watching , pencil in hand , spyglass to eye , the northern lunar hemisphere towards which they were rapidly but indirectly approaching .
__label__0	Had the proposition now been made to go back to the summit of <NAME> , I should have declined the offer in a most indignant manner .
__label__0	`` A secret -- which , '' stammered my uncle .
__label__0	At about half-past eleven the reservoirs were emptied , and our vessel rose to the surface of the ocean .
__label__0	There exists amongst the Indians a legend similar to that connected with <NAME> 's <NAME> in the <NAME> , telling how one of their heroes split open the rocks and drained dry the valley of <NAME> , after which , content with his exploit , he retired to the sacred town of <NAME> , where he did penance for 2000 years , inflicting upon himself the greatest torture .
__label__0	I also found my cousin and affianced wife as warm on the subject as was her father .
__label__0	`` What do you want to say , <NAME> ? ''
__label__1	‘ Why , it _is_ difficult , sir , I confess , ’ said the tall footman .
__label__1	I never saw him afterwards , but I sometimes imagine that I descry a faint reflection of him in <NAME> .
__label__0	A short-sighted , jealous policy , resulting in the putting back for half a century the progress of <NAME> .
__label__0	It was then eight o'clock , the hour at which their companion was to leave them .
__label__0	The surveys , the gradings , the cuttings , and the other preliminary labors in the great <NAME> , gave them incalculable aid .
__label__1	With these materials and the aid of the kettle , he filled a tumbler with a hot and odorous mixture , measured out and compounded with as much nicety as a physician ’ s prescription .
__label__0	Supposing we had succeeded in reaching the southern and distant shores of this extraordinary sea , what would have become of us ?
__label__1	Before you answer , keep this hat well in your mind and also this walking-stick. ’ ‘ I am willing , <NAME> , to come to terms. ’ ‘ Willing won ’ t do , <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ How goes the world this forenoon , gentlemen ?
__label__1	When a porter had put his luggage in the coach , and received his fare , he turned round and was gone ; and before my uncle had well begun to wonder what had become of him , half a dozen fresh ones started up , and staggered along under the weight of parcels , which seemed big enough to crush them .
__label__0	She appeared ignorant of nearly everything relating to life , and , although evidently intelligent , was wanting in many elementary ideas , such as time , for instance .
__label__1	At this rate you wo n't last my time . ''
__label__1	The client , with his dejection insensibly relieved and his vague hopes rekindled , takes pen and ink and writes the draft , not without perplexed consideration and calculation of the date it may bear , implying scant effects in the agent 's hands .
__label__1	‘ However , a sociable word or two on these mistakes became an easy introduction between us , and the weather was hot , and he helped me to a cool cabin on deck alongside his own , and his first school had been at <NAME> as mine had been , and he had learnt <NAME> as I had learnt it , and he had a little history of himself to relate -- God only knows how much of it true , and how much of it false -- that had its likeness to mine .
__label__0	This was a question which rendered me very uneasy and uncomfortable .
__label__1	During the whole of this scene , which lasted some three hours , he had plenty of shouting and weeping and sentimental company , and throughout <NAME> held him by the collar , as if to restrain him from flying at the objects of his brief devotion and tearing them to pieces .
__label__1	If I must come backwards and forwards , ’ mused the <NAME> with a dejected face , ‘ I may as well have something to come for. ’ ‘ Something to come for ? ’ screamed the old woman .
__label__1	‘ Well , then , why <NAME> ’ T you think so ? ’ said my aunt .
__label__1	`` Yes , my dear , '' said I .
__label__0	It was evident that his strength had been gradually undermined by illness , but his voice seemed yet powerful , as he said in <NAME> , and in a tone which evinced extreme surprise , -- “ Sir , I have no name. ” “ Nevertheless , I know you ! ” replied <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> ( translation from <NAME> ) .
__label__1	The aunt , the two young ladies , and <NAME> , each vying with the other in paying zealous and unremitting attentions to the old lady , crowded round her easy-chair , one holding her ear-trumpet , another an orange , and a third a smelling- bottle , while a fourth was busily engaged in patting and punching the pillows which were arranged for her support .
__label__1	‘ Why , no doubt everybody has heard it noticed ! ’ <NAME> in truth was no unreasonable inference ; seeing that Mr <NAME> would probably be the last person , in any assemblage of the human species , to receive an impression from anything that passed in his presence .
__label__0	We were in the centre of four cross paths -- somber and narrow tunnels .
__label__1	When a man rides an amiable hobby that shies at nothing and kicks nobody , it is only agreeable to find him riding it with a humorous sense of the droll side of the creature .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> followed , with a thoughtful countenance .
__label__0	I began to think him particularly lukewarm and unenthusiastic .
__label__1	I believe your father is acquainted with his daughter <NAME> ’ s writing .
__label__1	‘ I was going to do so .
__label__1	This here conduct of yourn won ’ t suit my book , <NAME> .
__label__0	He was then 150 miles from the <NAME> , and was told that it would take him no less than ten days to reach the great river , on account of the rapids and shallows .
__label__0	The billows fell as if by magic , the whole foaming sea seemed leveled , and the <NAME> flew over its tranquil bosom into a quiet basin beyond the formidable bar ; but almost the same minute the ocean burst forth again with all its fury , and the towering breakers dashed over the bar with increased violence .
__label__0	> < pyroxyle sometimes with xile > ` yle ' ending was accepted by undisputed `` majority rule '' > < aluminum and aluminium > The former accepted .
__label__1	The <NAME> ’ s delight and wonder at the quiet housewifery of <NAME> in assisting to clear the table , arrange the parlour , and sweep up the hearth -- only to be equalled by the fervency of his protest when she began to assist him -- were gradually raised to that degree , that at last he could not choose but do nothing himself , and stand looking at her as if she were some Fairy , daintily performing these offices for him ; the red rim on his forehead glowing again , in his unspeakable admiration .
__label__1	He was quite incapable of any compassionate feeling about the boy , or about his fate .
__label__0	`` There is no winter there , '' he says ; `` a soil dry and fertile , with game , and birds of every species in great abundance , who filled the air with hitherto unknown notes ; it was a real concert for us .
__label__0	But if one was at the head of his own men , the other was on board of his own ship .
__label__1	' I must leave you now , indeed . '
__label__0	Up to this period the <NAME> Company had been unable to add to the narrow strip of territory which they possessed at the ports , but it was now to benefit by the conflict between the nabobs and rajahs of <NAME> .
__label__1	Then , he sat down by the light of a single candle , and began to think , for the first time , on all that had taken place that day .
__label__0	During the two weeks that followed our last interesting conversation , there occurred nothing worthy of being especially recorded .
__label__1	There is no other message to send , I thank you , dear papa , that it would be at all agreeable to you to take. ’ They parted in an outer drawing-room , where only Mr <NAME> waited on his lady , and dutifully bided his time for shaking hands .
__label__1	I must do the best I can , for the present , I suppose. ’ In spite of himself , he appeared abashed by my aunt ’ s indignant tears , and came slouching out of the garden .
__label__0	Look out for your boat-hook ! ''
__label__1	She prayed him to forgive her , before my Agnes came into this world .
__label__1	‘ What is the matter ? ’ ‘ She is not one yet ! ’ cried the boy , embracing her still more closely .
__label__1	‘ Will you therefore be so good as to give me the address of <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Dear , dear , dear ! ’ said the Patriarch , ‘ how very unfortunate !
__label__1	‘ Why , I ’ m not exactly out of place , nor in , ’ faltered <NAME> .
__label__1	It is the light of <NAME> . ''
__label__1	<NAME> , my boy ! ’ He was so perfectly satisfied both with his quotation and his reference to it , that he could not help repeating the words again in a low voice , and saying he had forgotten ‘ em these forty year .
__label__0	There was a very steep winding path on the left , which the mules never would have attempted .
__label__0	A certain expression in <NAME> 's angry exclamation had struck the Captain like a shot , and set his temples throbbing violently .
__label__1	‘ Let me go with you. ’ ‘ Not to-night .
__label__1	Except when a constrained and singular reserve crept over her ; and then she seemed ( but <NAME> hardly understood this , though she could not choose but notice it , and think about it ) as if she were humbled before <NAME> , and ill at ease .
__label__1	But he watched her too ; and he saw that this indication of a knowledge on his part , of something that had passed between herself and her husband , rankled and smarted in her haughty breast , like a poisoned arrow .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> is already enough impressed by <NAME> , to feel indignant that <NAME> ( far below her ) should hold his prize so lightly .
__label__1	While they were on the way back , Mr <NAME> , upon whom his present functions sat very irksomely , took an opportunity of whispering in his ear that if he would confess his guilt , even by so much as a nod , and promise not to do so any more , he would connive at his kicking <NAME> on the shins and escaping up a court ; but <NAME> indignantly rejecting this proposal , Mr <NAME> had nothing for it , but to hold him tight until they reached <NAME> , and ushered him into the presence of the charming <NAME> , who immediately took the precaution of locking the door .
__label__1	‘ Would you have any objection to write down to <NAME> , and ask this favour of <NAME> ?
__label__0	Were these waters supplied with fish or not ?
__label__1	“ And she is of so aristocratic a disposition -- ” “ Yes , ma'am , ” I said again , with the same object as before .
__label__1	All men who know that there are laws against instructing slaves , of which the pains and penalties greatly exceed in their amount the fines imposed on those who maim and torture them , must be prepared to find their faces very low in the scale of intellectual expression .
__label__0	<NAME> any of these men of the abyss wandering about the deserted shores of this wondrous sea of the centre of the earth ?
__label__1	And yet I should have dearly liked , I own , to have touched her lips ; to have questioned her , that she might have opened them ; to have looked upon the lashes of her downcast eyes , and never raised a blush ; to have let loose waves of hair , an inch of which would be a keepsake beyond price : in short , I should have liked , I do confess , to have had the lightest licence of a child , and yet to have been man enough to know its value .
__label__0	While wintering at <NAME> , <NAME> was always surprised at the voracity of his guides ; he says somewhere that two men -- two , you understand -- ate in one morning a whole quarter of a musk-ox ; they tear the meat into long shreds , which they place in their mouths ; then each one , cutting off at his lips what his mouth can not hold , passes it over to his companion ; or else the gluttons , letting the shreds hang down to the ground , swallow them gradually , as a boa-constrictor swallows an animal , and like it stretched out at full length on the ground . ''
__label__1	<NAME> cats scamper across the road .
__label__0	`` All the better , '' replied our Frenchman , `` if it carries me up to the moon . ''
__label__1	He was pursued and taken with the property in his possession , and was sentenced to two years ’ imprisonment .
__label__1	For I naturally said , `` Esther !
__label__0	The Ister or <NAME> , the <NAME> or <NAME> , the <NAME> , or <NAME> ; and he finishes by relating how the alliance , and afterwards the union between the Scythians and <NAME> took place , which explains the reason why the young women of that country are not allowed to marry before they have killed an enemy and established their character for valour .
__label__1	<NAME> , who had been uneasily biting his thumb-nail and looking at her , collected his face into a sterner expression .
__label__1	All the better for her !
__label__0	Over the bed of the streams ran a liquid substance without any appearance of limpidity , streaked with distinct veins , which did not reunite by immediate cohesion when they were parted by the blade of a knife !
__label__1	Mellers it , is the word I should employ , Mr Boffin. ’ His wooden conceit and craft kept exact pace with the delighted expectation of his victim .
__label__1	Why , his father ’ s my friend ; he ’ s to come back to me directly , he is .
__label__0	It is an incontestible fact that he knew <NAME> , and also that he was quartermaster on the <NAME> .
__label__1	We encamped near a solitary log-house , for the sake of its water , and dined upon the plain .
__label__1	‘ And you have a distance before you , and will walk faster without me. ’ Being by this time close to <NAME> , they resolved , in consequence , to take that way over the <NAME> , and they left her ; <NAME> giving her his hand at parting , and she thanking him for his care of her brother .
__label__1	‘ Under such circumstances , what could a man of <NAME> ’ s spirit do ?
__label__0	It would be difficult to imagine a collection of greater ruffians .
__label__1	But though he was afraid to make up to them , he couldn ’ t bear to lose sight of them ; so when they walked faster he walked faster , when they lingered he lingered , and when they stopped he stopped ; and so they might have gone on , until the darkness prevented them , if <NAME> had not looked slyly back , and encouragingly beckoned <NAME> to advance .
__label__1	Of her father ’ s being groundlessly suspected , she felt sure .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> was inclined to think that such was the case , for the development of these storms was attended by the renewal of volcanic symptoms .
__label__1	To have seen the mother and son , like two great bats hanging over the whole house , and darkening it with their ugly forms , made me so uncomfortable , that I would rather have remained downstairs , knitting and all , than gone to bed .
__label__1	I am incapable of designs .
__label__0	The lake is of fresh water , rich in fish , and frequented by hippopotami and aquatic birds .
__label__1	‘ She looks upon me as mere child , sir .
__label__1	'Do n't believe that , ' said <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> n't only one wot can go up town .
__label__1	If he be ever asked how , why , when , or wherefore , he shuts up one eye and shakes his head .
__label__1	Each of you will do what is best for the other , if not what is best for yourselves . ''
__label__1	In spite of her request , he could not help opening the packet that night when he went to bed .
__label__0	By what means , by the exercise of what acuteness had these two ordinary mortals ascertained that which so many persons of the highest rank and importance scarcely even suspected ?
__label__1	<NAME> and glad as <NAME> truly was , that her young mistress should be advanced towards her proper place in the scene of her old neglect , and that she should have her father ’ s handsome wife for her companion and protectress , she could not relinquish any part of her own dominion to the handsome wife , without a grudge and a vague feeling of ill-will , for which she did not fail to find a disinterested justification in her sharp perception of the pride and passion of the lady ’ s character .
__label__1	Unseen by the spy , <NAME> stood at his side , and touched him on the shoulder like a ghostly bailiff .
__label__1	‘ Yes , he is , <NAME> , ’ replied the landlady .
__label__0	A hundred whales of the largest size could hardly have dashed up the ocean waves more violently .
__label__0	The corpses of Kara-Tete and his wife were raised , the limbs were bent , and laid against the stomach according to the <NAME> usage ; then came the funeral , not the final interment , but a burial until the moment when the earth had destroyed the flesh and nothing remained but the skeleton .
__label__1	He was a trifle above the middle size , and apparently rather weak in the legs ; but this circumstance by no means detracted from his own admiration of his top-boots , which he contemplated , in their elevated situation , with lively satisfaction .
__label__0	Was the brig about to penetrate far into the bay ?
__label__1	With such rich golden hair , such soft blue eyes , and such a bright , innocent , trusting face !
__label__1	<NAME> , when evening came , he took a way to his lodgings that led through fields , with any design of finding <NAME> in those fields , is not so certain as that she regularly walked there at that hour .
__label__1	I will carry out your views , sir ; but , under protest. ’ Mr Rugg then stated , not without prolixity , the heads of his protest .
__label__1	Then came the question , which of the two next doors ?
__label__0	As a last effort his hands convulsively clutched at a clump of reeds , but they could not stop him , and he disappeared beneath the waters of the river .
__label__0	`` Also , '' says <NAME> , `` there was perhaps no other country in the world where the obedience and submission of the subjects was carried further .
__label__1	But upon my soul I can ’ t make flourishes , and I would rather be disappointed than try. ’ If he meant to follow home what was in <NAME> ’ s thoughts , it was skilfully done .
__label__0	`` Sir , '' continued <NAME> , `` let us suppose an impossibility : if <NAME> should this day offer you your liberty ; would you accept it ? ''
__label__1	Or do you think that my having been unfortunate is a sufficient reason why our relative positions should be changed , and that she should command and I should obey ?
__label__1	You have n't got the family face . ''
__label__0	A few minutes more were all that the doomed man had to live !
__label__1	I have had to-day ’ s practice at home and abroad , on a march , and aboard ship , and I ’ ll tell you this : I don ’ t know that I have ever pursued it under such quiet circumstances as here this day .
__label__0	`` The Indians in their pirogues surrounded our frigates , hovering about for three or four hours before beginning to exchange a few fish , or two or three otter skins ; they seized every opportunity of robbing us ; they tore off all the iron which could be easily carried away , and they took every precaution to elude our vigilance at night .
__label__1	Here , among his many boxes labelled with transcendent names , lives <NAME> , when not speechlessly at home in country-houses where the great ones of the earth are bored to death .
__label__0	Toward five o ’ clock , the day began to dawn , bluish clouds marbled the upper stratum of clouds .
__label__0	The work of fortification was finished April 15th .
__label__1	‘ I thought so , ’ he observed .
__label__0	Giving the <NAME> Point a good wide berth , the <NAME> found the fog gradually clearing away , and by half-past three the passengers , looking under it , enjoyed the glorious view of the <NAME> mountains east of <NAME> , which had obtained for this entrance the famous and well deserved appellation of the <NAME> .
__label__1	She would have some fair reason for looking down upon me , I thought , if she saw me frightened ; and she would have no fair reason .
__label__1	‘ And whatever we are to say to you , sir , ’ exclaimed Mrs. <NAME> , addressing young <NAME> ’ s deliverer , ‘ I am sure I don ’ t know. ’ ‘ You need say nothing at all , ’ replied <NAME> .
__label__0	`` The sea is bad , the wind violent , but twenty miles in that light boat of the <NAME> does not frighten me .
__label__1	With a window near it , out of which our house can be seen , and IS seen many times during the morning ’ s service , by <NAME> , who likes to make herself as sure as she can that it ’ s not being robbed , or is not in flames .
__label__0	“ I have no longer the right to think of them ! ” <NAME> and the mujik soon arrived in the mercantile quarter of the lower town .
__label__0	<NAME> was seized with a desperate rage .
__label__1	Her cutting , gentlemen , was simplicity itself .
__label__0	If this astounding news , instead of flying through the electric wires , had simply arrived by post in the ordinary sealed envelope , <NAME> would not have hesitated a moment .
__label__1	For , there was something coming in the echoes , something light , afar off , and scarcely audible yet , that stirred her heart too much .
__label__0	When day breaks , however , <NAME> , this palace will not look so very gloomy .
__label__0	`` I never heard of a ship of this name in these seas . ''
__label__1	The ladies agreed that it _was _ very strange , but were unanimously of opinion that it must be very important , or <NAME> & <NAME> would never have sent ; and further , that the business being urgent , she ought to repair to <NAME> & <NAME> ’ s without any delay .
__label__1	They bore the trying spectacle in silence , until the mysterious visitor was at a safe distance ; when they burst into pebbles and yells , and likewise into reviling dances , and in all respects buried the pipe of peace with so many savage ceremonies , that , if Mr <NAME> had been the chief of the Cripplewayboo tribe with his war-paint on , they could scarcely have done greater justice to their education .
__label__0	Would the captain put out a boat ?
__label__1	‘ You are a little low this evening , <NAME> , ’ said the Father of the <NAME> .
__label__0	The <NAME> had been now more than two months at anchor .
__label__0	All this was but a pretext for murders , raids , and pillage .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> walked all the way , and talked to me so kind , it quite knocked me over .
__label__0	`` Who is his own brother , sir . ''
__label__1	Having dismissed his attendant , and seen the box safely deposited in the coach-office , he looked into the coffee-room in search of <NAME> .
__label__0	What was the <NAME> going to do with the <NAME> ?
__label__0	“ <NAME> , ” asked <NAME> , a few days later , “ do you think all this could have happened if <NAME> had been still alive ? ” “ <NAME> , <NAME> , ” answered <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ What _can_ he mean by this ? ’ said <NAME> , when the horse had executed this manoeuvre for the twentieth time .
__label__1	‘ My dear , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ if you will mention to Copperfield what our present position is , which I have no doubt he will like to know , I will go and look at the paper the while , and see whether anything turns up among the advertisements. ’ ‘ I thought you were at <NAME> , ma ’ am , ’ I said to Mrs. Micawber , as he went out .
__label__1	'Well , I suppose it is , ' growled <NAME> .
__label__1	Several men were drowned in the attempt to swim across , not long ago ; and one , who had the madness to trust himself upon a table as a raft , was swept down to the whirlpool , where his mangled body eddied round and round some days .
__label__0	It was too little ; for , as the wind did not freshen , they only advanced very slowly towards the <NAME> coast .
__label__0	This event gave them a proof of the severity of the climate . ''
__label__0	This time it is certain that the sea is breaking upon the rocks at no great distance .
__label__1	<NAME> let me take these bags from you .
__label__1	“ <NAME> ’ t trouble yourself about the warming-pan. ” The warming-pan !
__label__0	A minute afterwards they were in the presence of Mrs. Scorbitt and J. T. <NAME> .
__label__1	So quietly did the mowing of the old scythe go on , that fully three months had passed unnoticed since the two <NAME> brothers had been laid in one tomb in the strangers ’ cemetery at <NAME> .
__label__1	He remembered how he used to look up into her pale face ; and how her eyes would sometimes fill with tears as she gazed upon his features -- tears which fell hot upon his forehead as she stooped to kiss him , and made him weep too , although he little knew then what bitter tears hers were .
__label__1	It would have been better , under any circumstances , to have gone on !
__label__0	As to his narrative , with the exception of some exaggerations of detail according to the taste of that time , it is exact , and the greater part of the descriptions which we owe to him have been verified by modern travellers and learned men , especially by M. Alcide d'Orbigny .
__label__0	He explored the coal-bunkers , the store-room , the powder-store , and armory , in which last he seemed to be particularly attracted by a cannon mounted on the forecastle .
__label__1	She added in the same breath , as if fearful of any further questioning , ‘ But please will you leave a card or message ? ’ These unusual answers might naturally have provoked some more inquiries .
__label__1	‘ Ah ! ’ Mrs <NAME> curled the little finger of her left hand as who should say , ‘ I have caught you .
__label__1	‘ Now , <NAME> , attend to what I am going to say , and promise and vow to be obedient. ’ ‘ I promise and vow , my dear. ’ ‘ You ask no questions .
__label__1	And he was -- honourable and manful -- for two year going on , and we was just the same at home here as afore. ’ <NAME> ’ s face , which had varied in its expression with the various stages of his narrative , now resumed all its former triumphant delight , as he laid a hand upon my knee and a hand upon <NAME> ’ s ( previously wetting them both , for the greater emphasis of the action ) , and divided the following speech between us : ‘ All of a sudden , one evening -- as it might be tonight -- comes little Em ’ ly from her work , and him with her !
__label__1	'He is a child of a noble nature and a warm heart , ' said <NAME> , colouring ; 'and that <NAME> which has thought fit to try him beyond his years , has planted in his breast affections and feelings which would do honour to many who have numbered his days six times over . '
__label__1	When they had got through such studies as they had in hand , they stood leaning on the window-sill , and looking down upon the patch of garden .
__label__0	`` No such luck , '' replied <NAME> ; `` nothing of the kind is likely to happen ; and even if it did , we should not profit by it .
__label__0	The postilions , stimulated by a promise of a princely <NAME> , drove rapidly along over a well-kept road .
__label__0	For this retreat <NAME> was preparing in secret .
__label__1	“ How does she use you , <NAME> ; how does she use you ? ” she asked me again , with her witch-like eagerness , even in <NAME> 's hearing .
__label__0	The weather during that day was horrible ; the snow , caught up in dense whirls , covered the brig with an impenetrable veil ; at times , under the influence of the hurricane , the fog would rise , and their terror-stricken eyes beheld the <NAME> 's Thumb rising on the shore like a spectre .
__label__0	`` Pardon me , sir , '' I resumed , `` but this liberty is only what every prisoner has of pacing his prison .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , laughing boisterously , ‘ they dean ’ t put too much intiv ’ em .
__label__1	I am not clear , Mr Boffin , but that the hive may be satirical. ’ ‘ At all events , they work , ’ said Mr Boffin .
__label__0	shouted <NAME> ; `` that bear has got rather too many paws ! ''
__label__1	Yes , he was the Father of the place .
__label__1	I work hard , and read Law insatiably .
__label__0	But in <NAME> he was not appreciated according to his worth. ” “ He was a sturdy fellow ! ” said <NAME> , “ but what became of him ? ” “ He died at the age of thirty-nine , from the consequences of his long fatigues .
__label__0	“ And the ‘ <NAME> , ’ making sail , soon disappeared .
__label__1	'Not one , ' replied <NAME> , in a voice rendered husky by regret ; 'not one . '
__label__0	<NAME> looked over and greedily read the work as it proceeded .
__label__0	If the hood had not been securely fastened , it would have been blown away long before .
__label__1	Noticing him at his distance , she turns an inquiring look on the other Mercury who has brought her home .
__label__1	‘ I know you ’ ll be sorry afterwards .
__label__1	“ And if you keep it under your skirts like that , who 's to help tumbling ?
__label__1	Unconscious of this prediction , <NAME> continued to occupy precisely the same ground in reference to the Doctor and to Mrs. Strong .
__label__1	The subject did not admit of a doubt .
__label__1	The rain had been thick and heavy all day , and with little intermission for many days .
__label__1	I made my way to <NAME> , and said , that I believed I had the pleasure of seeing an old schoolfellow there .
__label__0	In fact , I see them there already -- '' `` In my mind 's eye , <NAME> ! ''
__label__1	I have no other information. ” “ No , to be sure. ” “ Now , whether , ” pursued <NAME> , “ he had used the child 's mother ill , or whether he had used the child 's mother well , <NAME> does n't say ; but she had shared some four or five years of the wretched life he described to us at this fireside , and he seems to have felt pity for her , and forbearance towards her .
__label__0	“ Everything is possible , ” replied <NAME> , who was getting uneasy .
__label__1	<NAME> , thrusting Mr Flintwinch aside , proceeded straight up-stairs .
__label__0	They had no means of quitting the reef ; no fire , nor any means of obtaining it .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> said I wasn ’ t to , because people wouldn ’ t believe the attendance was good if they saw how small I was first. ’ ‘ Well , but they ’ ll see how small you are afterwards , won ’ t they ? ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	But at this moment <NAME> came up , put his hand upon <NAME> 's shoulder , and , showing his warrant , said , `` You are really <NAME> ? ''
__label__1	I mean I am a man of more -- more -- ” “ Say gallantry , while you are about it , ” suggested <NAME> .
__label__0	What we call diffused light on <NAME> , the grateful result of refraction , the luminous matter held in suspension by the air , the mother of our dawns and our dusks , of our blushing mornings and our dewy eyes , of our shades , our penumbras , our tints and all the other magical effects of _chiaro-oscuro_ -- this diffused light has absolutely no existence on the surface of the <NAME> .
__label__0	And yet how many presumptions there were against him !
__label__1	Be so good as chair that there member in this direction , will you ? ''
__label__1	‘ I am afraid we must live expensively for the first week , ’ returned <NAME> , with a groan , ‘ and then we must make up for it .
__label__1	‘ It ’ s quite dreadful , ’ said <NAME> , stopping his ears .
__label__1	<NAME> cares about me now , and it ’ s very nat ’ ral they shouldn ’ t. ’ Here the old lady tossed her head , and smoothed down her lavender-coloured silk dress with trembling hands .
__label__0	Just now let us think of something far more pressing . ''
__label__0	And if one of these creatures went from Behring to <NAME> , it must be simply because there is a passage from one sea to the other , either on the <NAME> or the <NAME> side . ''
__label__1	There is the registrar below the judge , in wig and gown ; and there are two or three maces , or petty-bags , or privy purses , or whatever they may be , in legal court suits .
__label__1	`` You are very poor , ai n't you ? ''
__label__1	“ In their presence , ” pursued <NAME> , “ I will tell you , young man , what to say to <NAME> .
__label__0	The colonists were soon obliged to fight at close quarters , not without receiving some wounds , though happily very slight ones .
__label__0	They could not succeed in killing any sort of game , and their only nourishment was a species of samphire , containing a quantity of carbonate of soda and acid juice .
__label__0	When the folly as well as the uselessness of the adventure was pointed out to him , he contented himself with replying , `` If the thing is feasible , the first to do it ought to be an Englishman . ''
__label__0	With a little garden clay , I could raise you a splendid crop of peas in twenty-four hours .
__label__1	Mr Clennam , I am surprised that a gentleman who is capable of having a heart of his own , should be capable of the heartlessness of treating mine in that way .
__label__0	<NAME> decided upon -- Conjectures -- Preparations -- The three Passengers -- First Night -- Second Night -- <NAME> -- Searching the <NAME> -- Searching the <NAME> -- No one -- Animals -- Plants -- A Dwelling -- Deserted .
__label__1	It ’ s the only thing in all the world that I am fit for , or that ’ s fit for me .
__label__1	‘ Who could have told you that I took another service at <NAME> , and that they afterwards moved all the way here ?
__label__1	As he could not move a hand , he could make no sign of distress ; but , through this close watching ( if through no secret sympathy or power ) the little creature attained an understanding of him that <NAME> did not possess .
__label__0	“ I do not see anything , ” said <NAME> , after having for perhaps the hundredth time read through the document .
__label__1	It ’ s the parting from her old playfellow and friend -- her favourite cousin -- that has done this .
__label__1	There 'll he nobody but Ma to thank for it . ''
__label__1	At length , without the slightest notice , she opened her eyes again , and recommenced in a short , sharp manner : ‘ What happens then , I ask !
__label__0	Would it not be best to let <NAME> judge of what he ought to do , and to warn him , at least , of the danger which threatened him ?
__label__1	What could I say but yes !
__label__0	Fortunately , I eventually found means to free my raft , and float it again . ''
__label__1	I expect it come about from that. ’ ‘ I saw just now , that that man ’ s clothes were scattered about the floor of his cell .
__label__1	“ Is it possible ! ” repeated <NAME> , bitterly .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> then caned <NAME> for being discovered in tears , instead of cheers , on account of <NAME> ’ s departure ; and went back to his sofa , or his bed , or wherever he had come from .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> had great experience in hackney cabs , and her starting in one was generally a work of time , as she was systematic in the preparatory arrangements .
__label__1	We who were left walked on towards the house .
__label__1	Its motto is , Keep the Grubber always at it .
__label__0	A few lightning-flashes , reflections from a distant storm , illuminated the horizon .
__label__0	For a man who had never studied legislation , he had drawn up some very wise rules for the administration of justice , for the collection of taxes , the apportionment of the <NAME> , and the working of the mines .
__label__1	‘ Nearly half an hour. ’ ‘ Well , I never saw such people in all my life as you are , for time , up here ! ’ Mrs. Nickleby would exclaim in great astonishment ; ‘ I declare I never did !
__label__0	He was clothed in a robe of sombre-coloured silk , and wore a velvet cap , very similar in shape to that of <NAME> mountaineers .
__label__1	`` She 's gone forrard to the Police Office , '' returns <NAME> .
__label__1	' I would not have had them here , for the world . '
__label__0	They examined it under all its different aspects , physical , meteorological , economical , or moral , up to its bearings on politics or civilization .
__label__0	Near its centre , on the south-east , are the islands inhabited by the <NAME> , a race who live by pillaging the people of the mainland .
__label__0	<NAME> was twenty years old .
__label__0	<NAME> was just in the mood to take <NAME> ’ s part , which drew from <NAME> the remark that <NAME> could not be held responsible for any accidental injury done by her cannon , and if the <NAME> ’ s long nose came in the way of the ball , the <NAME> must submit to the mischance .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> concluded by drawing a rather disagreeable picture of the discomforts of hanging ; and , with great friendliness and politeness of manner , expressed his anxious hopes that he might never be obliged to submit <NAME> to that unpleasant operation .
__label__1	What dear flowers ! ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	The long festoon of the liana curled round its higher branches , moving away to the other side of the clearing , and disappeared again into the forest .
__label__1	<NAME> go on to something else besides our having no nonsense about us. ’ ‘ Yes , my love , ’ said Mr Sparkler .
__label__1	‘ You ’ ll excuse my saying , sir , ’ returned my aunt , ‘ that I think it would have been a much better and happier thing if you had left that poor child alone. ’ ‘ I so far agree with what <NAME> has remarked , ’ observed <NAME> , bridling , ‘ that I consider our lamented Clara to have been , in all essential respects , a mere child. ’ ‘ It is a comfort to you and me , ma ’ am , ’ said my aunt , ‘ who are getting on in life , and are not likely to be made unhappy by our personal attractions , that nobody can say the same of us. ’ ‘ No doubt ! ’ returned <NAME> , though , I thought , not with a very ready or gracious assent .
__label__1	I am afraid , ’ she added , her momentary composure forsaking her , ‘ I am afraid I may not have said , strongly enough , how deeply I felt such disinterested love , and how earnestly I prayed for his future happiness .
__label__1	I tell you this , that you may know we knew enough of you to persuade Mr Boffin to let us lead you on , deluded , to the last possible moment , in order that your disappointment might be the heaviest possible disappointment .
__label__0	Hans with his usual imperturbable calm remained at the helm .
__label__1	I opened the door ; and at first looked down , to my amazement , on nothing but a great umbrella that appeared to be walking about of itself .
__label__1	‘ If you had money now -- ’ said Mr Dombey .
__label__0	Many a time have I considered the matter ; I feel almost sure of it .
__label__0	The <NAME> made a sign at which all the crowd bent low their heads .
__label__0	_Engraved by E. Morieu._ ] At the same period a master in the <NAME> , <NAME> by name , was appointed by an Edinburgh firm to the command of an expedition , to obtain seal-skins in the southern seas , where two years were to be spent .
__label__1	He was a morose , savage-hearted , bad man ; idle and dissolute in his habits ; cruel and ferocious in his disposition .
__label__1	I dare say I owe as much as good-natured people will let me owe .
__label__1	In such a case I could show you reasons , I think , which would induce you to yield it . '
__label__1	There is some inconvenience in the necessity of writing <NAME> , ’ said Mr Dombey , making a fictitious autograph on his knee ; ‘ but it is merely of a private and personal complexion .
__label__1	For the first time he felt that in that sharp fire , he had slowly forged the iron which could break the prison door of his daughter 's husband , and deliver him .
__label__1	‘ And when does the ship sail , <NAME> ? ’ asked my aunt .
__label__1	Viewing the matter precisely in this light , <NAME> , without the slightest intimation of his purpose , sprang vigorously out of bed , struck the <NAME> so smart a blow in the chest as to deprive him of a considerable portion of the commodity which sometimes bears his name , and then , recapturing his nightcap , boldly placed himself in an attitude of defence .
__label__0	On the left there comes the <NAME> and the <NAME> , flowing from the northeast ; and on the right the <NAME> , which joins the main stream twenty-eight hundred miles from the <NAME> , and can be ascended by steamboats for over two hundred miles into the very heart of <NAME> .
__label__1	A dull anger that she should be seen in her distress , and that the involuntary look she had so resented should come to this fulfilment , smouldered within her like an unwholesome fire .
__label__1	‘ Have you been travelling ? ’ Mr Short replied in the affirmative with a nod and a smile .
__label__0	Upon the 3rd of July , anchor was finally weighed , and ten days later , <NAME> put in at <NAME> in the <NAME> of <NAME> for refreshments .
__label__1	Nothing but mysteries in connection with <NAME> ’ s house .
__label__0	Near <NAME> are some mines of auriferous quartz , of which the commander was able to obtain a specimen , and in the interior is the lake of <NAME> , said to be of immense depth , and which is the source of the torrent of the same name that dashes in the form of a magnificent waterfall over a basalt rock eighty feet high , barring its progress to the sea .
__label__0	Will you promise me to do so ? ” “ On my honor , ” answered <NAME> .
__label__1	Revived by soup , <NAME> discourses mildly of the <NAME> with <NAME> and <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ He wouldn ’ t blow up alone .
__label__0	He took the bullet , turned it over and over , rolled it between his finger and thumb ; then , turning to <NAME> , he asked , -- “ Are you sure that the peccary wounded by this bullet was not more than three months old ? ” “ Not more , captain , ” replied <NAME> .
__label__0	How closely he follows , and imparts to his readers , the scientific probabilities of the universe beyond our earth , the actual knowledge so hard won by our astronomers !
__label__0	“ Well , <NAME> , ” she said , “ each to his lot in this world .
__label__1	Her mother eyed her sharply for a moment , and feeling herself on unsafe ground , said , as a diversion : ‘ My charming <NAME> , you must come and kiss me once more , if you please , my love. ’ Florence complied , of course , and again imprinted her lips on Mrs <NAME> ’ s ear .
__label__0	He is to keep you at <NAME> as if you were his daughter .
__label__1	To all this Clennam merely replied that , granting the whole protest , nothing in it lessened the force , or could lessen the force , of the voluntary and public exoneration of his partner .
__label__1	To <NAME> heretofore the <NAME> , of <NAME> .
__label__0	They had removed all difficulties .
__label__1	Perhaps we had better go to your place of residence .
__label__1	‘ Now you may mizzle , jemmy ( as we say at <NAME> ) , and if <NAME> will take the chair I ’ ll operate on him. ’ ‘ What do you say , <NAME> ? ’ inquired <NAME> , laughing , and resigning his seat .
__label__0	`` Yes , we will save him ! ''
__label__1	He had been known in <NAME> as <NAME> .
__label__1	I have seen him so terrify a client or a witness by ceremoniously unfolding this pocket-handkerchief as if he were immediately going to blow his nose , and then pausing , as if he knew he should not have time to do it before such client or witness committed himself , that the <NAME> has followed directly , quite as a matter of course .
__label__1	The discussions ended in our hiring for him , by the month , a neat little furnished lodging in a quiet old house near <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> 's wounds , covered with compresses and lint , were pressed neither too much nor too little , so as to cause their cicatrisation without determining on inflammatory reaction .
__label__1	To which <NAME> retorts , `` I say so ! ''
__label__0	It would seem that life is so precious to them that they are impelled to worship all that can prolong it !
__label__0	After a halt at <NAME> , on the coast of <NAME> , he resumed his voyage ; sighted the desert island of <NAME> of <NAME> , on the 26th March , and steered towards <NAME> , where he hoped to meet with the same friendly reception as <NAME> and <NAME> had done before him .
__label__0	We were nearly six hundred yards above the city ; but nothing betrayed the horizontal displacement of the balloon , for the mass of air in which it is enclosed goes forward with it .
__label__1	He meant to be clear of the town very early ; before the Hands were in the streets .
__label__1	I trace the same current now , flowing through all his quiet and unobtrusive proceedings. -- I am about to sign my name , you observe , at the foot of the articles which Mr Chuckster will witness ; and placing my finger upon this blue wafer with the vandyked corners , I am constrained to remark in a distinct tone of voice -- don ’ t be alarmed , ma ’ am , it is merely a form of law -- that I deliver this , as my act and deed .
__label__1	Between the real landscape and its shadow in the water , there was no division ; both were so untroubled and clear , and , while so fraught with solemn mystery of life and death , so hopefully reassuring to the gazer ’ s soothed heart , because so tenderly and mercifully beautiful .
__label__0	“ If he had quitted the island he would have taken away his weapons and his tools , ” replied <NAME> .
__label__0	The sun rising above a clear horizon , announced a magnificent day , one of those beautiful autumn days which are like the last farewells of the warm season .
__label__0	With the first rays of the sun they saw a little island , six miles to windward of them .
__label__0	It would be too small for them , '' replied <NAME> simply .
__label__1	But this little death has made me ask myself the question , seriously , whether I wasn ’ t too bent upon pleasing myself .
__label__0	To save trouble , we will establish our manufactory at the place of production .
__label__0	With him , a thing promised was a thing done .
__label__0	The wind grew decidedly calmer , and happily the sea fell with it .
__label__0	Naturally enough , we were all deeply impressed by the fearfulness of our position , which may be summed up in a few words .
__label__0	They went on as before , hand in hand , speaking little , <NAME> looking about on every side ; twice a day they halted .
__label__0	We were lying upon the back of a sort of submarine boat , which appeared ( as far as I could judge ) like a huge fish of steel .
__label__0	Lieutenant Procope had brought in his hand a mercurial thermometer , and <NAME> carried an aneroid barometer , by means of which he could estimate the depth of their descent below the level of the <NAME> .
__label__0	But how much do you agree to give me for the hire -- the hire , one day ? ” “ You shall have twenty francs , ” said <NAME> .
__label__0	Four barrels of the revolver were still undischarged .
__label__0	To right and left ran long , dark galleries , where sight was lost .
__label__0	At daybreak <NAME> examined the landing-place ; the yawl , which was now their only boat , would carry the crew and the passengers .
__label__0	The engineer announced to the stranger that his dwelling was ready to receive him , and the latter replied that he would go and sleep there that very evening .
__label__1	However , he steamed in and out of his little back Dock according as he was wanted or not wanted in the <NAME> presence , and business had gone on in its customary course .
__label__0	The danger was not only from the wind which battered against the travelers , but from the avalanche of stones and broken trunks which were hurtling through the air .
__label__0	“ You are <NAME> ? ” asked <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ But now isn ’ t it , <NAME> , isn ’ t it , <NAME> , invigorating , ’ said Mrs. Markleham , mechanically following her with her eyes , ‘ to find a man at <NAME> ’ s time of life , with the strength of mind to do this kind of thing ?
__label__1	`` Ca n't help it , '' he returned .
__label__0	There were seventeen superiors , arrayed in large cloaks of white satin , richly trimmed with spangled embroidery ; their shirts and trousers were of silk ; and a very large turban of white muslin was studded with a border of different coloured stones ; their attendants wore red caps and turbans , and long white shirts , which hung over their trousers ; those of the inferiors were of dark blue cloth .
__label__1	'Well , well , ' said <NAME> , with a sigh , ' I 'll send the <NAME> round presently . '
__label__0	in 1668 , and elected by her a member of the <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> for your nurture of him , moan for your corruption of him , moan for your loss of him , moan for mine ! ’ She clenched her hand , and trembled through her spare , worn figure , as if her passion were killing her by inches .
__label__0	The journey promised well , much better than the expedition begun in the dead of winter in search of coal .
__label__1	He has a wife ; that wife is attached to , and dependent on him .
__label__0	But I forgot I did n't come alone . ''
__label__0	<NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> set out with the <NAME> princess and the <NAME> ambassadors , and it was during this voyage , which lasted eighteen months , that it seems most probable that <NAME> visited the islands of <NAME> and other islands in the <NAME> , as well as <NAME> and the towns on the coast of <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ For I aint , you must know , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ much of a hand at reading writing-hand , though I can read my Bible and most print .
__label__1	I knew as well , when I saw my mother ’ s head lean down upon his shoulder , and her arm touch his neck -- I knew as well that he could mould her pliant nature into any form he chose , as I know , now , that he did it .
__label__0	“ At last ! ” said <NAME> , when on the evening of the 22nd of September they were strolling about at the mouth of the mine .
__label__0	The morning of February 13th arrived .
__label__0	At the moment <NAME> pronounced these words with an accent of despair , <NAME> made a step forward to run to <NAME> 's aid ; then he stopped , struggling against himself and his prejudices .
__label__1	Pick me up ; I want to hear better .
__label__0	`` You know they are not there , as you have stolen them ! ''
__label__0	`` That 's tolerably certain , '' replied <NAME> , quietly ; `` I think they will make fun of you , sir .
__label__0	The cacique dined at the admiral 's table , apparently enjoying the repast ; after he had himself tasted of the different viands and beverages , he sent the dishes and goblets to the members of his suite ; he had good manners , spoke little , but showed great politeness .
__label__0	Dr. <NAME> was received with all the honors by the guards and favorites of the sultan ; these were men of a fine race , the <NAME> so-called , a pure type of the central <NAME> populations , strong , robust , well-made , and in splendid condition .
__label__1	I had never thought it possible that we three could be together undisturbed , once more ; and I felt , for the time , as if the old days were come back .
__label__0	`` A crater , '' he said , `` you hear ? ''
__label__1	‘ I were very patient wi ’ her .
__label__0	`` Take him , guide , '' returned <NAME> , `` and I shall still be your debtor . ''
__label__1	‘ May I take the liberty to say something ? ’ ‘ You may , ’ <NAME> graciously conceded .
__label__0	I am compelled to hold onto the mast , which bends like a reed beneath the violence of the storm , to which none ever before seen by mariners bore any resemblance .
__label__0	He is a true man , worthy of your entire confidence. ” <NAME> was on the point of replying that he had never doubted his good faith , when the man came in and brought his engagement written out in due form .
__label__1	Do you believe what I am saying ? ’ ‘ I fear I must .
__label__1	I had to preside , too , over the entertainment , consisting of a dish of fish , a roast fowl , a sweetbread , vegetables , pudding , and <NAME> ; and it was so pleasant to see how she enjoyed it , and with what state and ceremony she did honour to it , that I was soon thinking of nothing else .
__label__1	I do n't know why anything should be otherwise than safe and well here , thank God ; but I have been so put out all day , and I am not as young as I was !
__label__0	Nothing from you would vex me ! ” “ Speak , Nadia. ” “ Why , now that the <NAME> ’ s letter has been taken from you , are you so anxious to reach <NAME> ? ” <NAME> tightly pressed his companion ’ s hand , but he did not answer .
__label__0	Sometimes I heard the melancholy tones of his organ ; but only at night , in the midst of the deepest obscurity , when the <NAME> slept upon the deserted ocean .
__label__0	I have the honor , my brave colleagues , to propose a trial of this little experiment . ''
__label__0	What our schooner has done , their boat may have done !
__label__0	<NAME> in gold money a hundred francs , and twenty francs for the hire. ” The old man folded his hands in meek resignation .
__label__1	The shade of a young butcher rises , like the apparition of an armed head in <NAME> .
__label__0	_Venex a leur_ secours , ou ils sont <NAME> ! ” ( On the 27th of June , 1865 , the three-mast vessel <NAME> , of <NAME> , has foundered after a long <NAME> in the <NAME> , on the coast of <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Character portraits , oh yes -- they ’ re not real military men , you know. ’ ‘ No ! ’ ‘ Bless your heart , of course not ; only clerks and that , who hire a uniform coat to be painted in , and send it here in a carpet bag .
__label__1	I saw but little of the girl ’ s face , over which her hair fell loose and scattered , as if she had been disordering it with her own hands ; but I saw that she was young , and of a fair complexion .
__label__1	And finished his breakfast as if the flavour of the <NAME> , and also of the ham and toast and eggs , were a little on the wane .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> delighted too , I should say , from the manner in which he ’ s looking this way. ’ Here <NAME> ( previously instructed for the purpose ) interposed her many curls and whispered her sister to observe how jealous Mr <NAME> was .
__label__0	Up till then , no Tartar detachment had been seen , which showed that the raft was not abreast of the outposts .
__label__1	A shadowy idea of wickedness committed , haunts every individual in the party ; and each one secretly thinks the other a companion in guilt , whom it would be agreeable to avoid .
__label__0	We disembarked at our yesterday 's landing-place , and <NAME> again led the way towards the hill of Klock-Klock .
__label__1	‘ You had much better go and marry <NAME> , the carrier .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> and his <NAME> forfeit the good Opinion of all worldly and prudent People On the next morning after <NAME> ’ s disclosure had been made , <NAME> returned home .
__label__1	<NAME> ’ t mention it , but it ’ s the most extraordinary accidental likeness you ever saw -- her very portrait , sir ! ’ By this time it was past eleven o ’ clock ; and <NAME> ’ s sister declaring that she ought to have been at home a full hour ago , a coach was procured , into which she was handed with great ceremony by brother Ned , while brother <NAME> imparted the fullest directions to the coachman , and besides paying the man a shilling over and above his fare , in order that he might take the utmost care of the lady , all but choked him with a glass of spirits of uncommon strength , and then nearly knocked all the breath out of his body in his energetic endeavours to knock it in again .
__label__0	Therefore an explosive substance must be manufactured , which would make a deep trench in some other part of the shore .
__label__1	'Not to press you to alter your determination , ' pursued the young man , 'but to hear you repeat it , if you would .
__label__1	Then , maybe , <NAME> ’ r <NAME> , seein ’ none but <NAME> there , she might take heart to creep in , trembling ; and might come to be laid down in her old bed , and rest her weary head where it was once so gay. ’ I could not speak to him in reply , though I tried .
__label__0	Perhaps even this water , having to contend against the accumulated subterraneous fires of the interior of the earth , had become partially vaporized .
__label__1	As he went his way , up the ancient street , he saw the cheerful light of the blazing fires gleam through the old casements , and heard the loud laugh and the cheerful shouts of those who were assembled around them ; he marked the bustling preparations for next day ’ s cheer , and smelled the numerous savoury odours consequent thereupon , as they steamed up from the kitchen windows in clouds .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> L. <NAME> 's <NAME> .
__label__0	Had not <NAME> , in 1751 , sailed into the <NAME> seas ?
__label__0	“ That ’ s all very well for children ! ” “ <NAME> ’ t be proud , friend <NAME> , ” replied the reporter .
__label__1	‘ Whatever possessed that poor unfortunate <NAME> , that she must go and be married again , ’ said my aunt , when I had finished , ‘ I can ’ t conceive. ’ ‘ Perhaps she fell in love with her second husband , ’ <NAME> suggested .
__label__0	It might have been fancied that she had weighed anchor , thinking that she had to deal with her match , and had left the coast .
__label__0	We were in sight of the island for twelve hours , and then it was lost in the evening mists .
__label__1	'And what have you got , my dear ? '
__label__0	Sometimes the taste of these designs is really wonderful .
__label__0	These people have the following strange custom : when a man has been condemned and put to death , they take the body , cook , and eat it ; but in the case of a natural death they do not eat the body .
__label__1	‘ Why don ’ t you enliven us yourself , <NAME> ? ’ said a young man with a whisker , a squint , and an open shirt collar ( dirty ) , from the bottom of the table .
__label__1	Whenever I watched the vessels standing out to sea with their white sails spread , I somehow thought of <NAME> and <NAME> ; and whenever the light struck aslant , afar off , upon a cloud or sail or green hillside or water-line , it was just the same. -- <NAME> and <NAME> and the strange house and the strange life appeared to have something to do with everything that was picturesque .
__label__0	`` Neither quicker nor slower , dear friends , '' interposed <NAME> , desirous to stop a quarrel ; `` we are floating , you know , in an absolute void , where specific gravity never counts . ''
__label__0	Then , since <NAME> is 77deg 3 ’ 11 ” as much as to say seventy-seven degrees counted from the meridian of <NAME> which the Americans take for their starting-point for longitudes concurrently with the <NAME> -- it followed that the island must be situated seventy-seven and seventy-five degrees west of the meridian of <NAME> , that is to say , on the hundred and fifty-second degree of west longitude .
__label__1	‘ Con-found it , no , ’ rejoined <NAME> , stopping for an instant to smash a fly with the ruler .
__label__0	The disposition of these volcanic strata absolutely confirms the theories of <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ And <NAME> is here , ’ said <NAME> , in rapid conclusion ; ‘ and , could you believe it ?
__label__1	<NAME> face to face for the first time with the daughter of his supposed murderer , it was natural that <NAME> should have his own secret reasons for a careful scrutiny of her countenance and manner .
__label__0	He was now in the latitude of <NAME> -- i.e .
__label__1	With means at hand of building decent cabins , it was wonderful to see how clumsy , rough , and wretched , its hovels were .
__label__0	It is generally agreed now to recognize in <NAME> 's description of the <NAME> , the group to which <NAME> gave the name of <NAME> .
__label__1	`` Only hear that , <NAME> , '' said Mrs. Cratchit .
__label__1	For the most part <NAME> notices things in general , with a face as unchanging as the great mourning ring on his little finger or the brooch , composed of not much diamond and a good deal of setting , which he wears in his shirt .
__label__1	‘ That woman , <NAME> , ’ said the Major , ‘ is , in her way , a Lucifer .
__label__1	I don ’ t pretend to stand between your mother and you. ’ ‘ Will you tell her that I have come home ? ’ ‘ Yes , <NAME> , yes .
__label__0	These people lead a miserable life .
__label__0	There was no one in the rooms nor in the storehouse , which had been respected by the band of quadrumana .
__label__1	Long enough to be chilled to the heart , but I don ’ t know how long .
__label__1	What does anybody want here ?
__label__1	You had better determine to leave him here for the present ! ’ ‘ I am very much obliged to you , ’ said my aunt ; ‘ and so is he , I see ; but -- ’ ‘ Come !
__label__1	It was spacious , and I dare say had once been handsome , but every discernible thing in it was covered with dust and mould , and dropping to pieces .
__label__1	His eyes looked so very sinister , as he put his leg into the room and glanced round at <NAME> , that she thought with a sudden coldness , if he were to go straight up-stairs to murder the invalid , what could she do to prevent him ?
__label__0	“ Can you explain this ? ” asked the count .
__label__0	The question was , whether a chimney could be discerned between the two masts of the vessel , which was now at a distance of only five miles .
__label__1	She never left him all that night .
__label__1	For , although an ingenious Allegory relating to a butcher , a three-legged stool , a dog , and a leg of mutton , this narrative consumed time ; and they were in great suspense .
__label__0	Ice or vapor will do , but water wo n't ! ''
__label__0	My two sailors received me half dead .
__label__0	With cables properly fixed , the launch , it seemed , might be effected without any mishap .
__label__1	“ <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> and <NAME> .
__label__1	Will you have the goodness to come a little forward , <NAME> ? ’ The apple-faced man having sheepishly complied with this request , stood chuckling and grinning in a front row .
__label__1	‘ Yes , yes , yes , yes. ’ ‘ And if , my dear Frederick -- if you could , without putting any great constraint upon yourself , throw a little ( pray excuse me , <NAME> ) , a little polish into your usual demeanour -- ’ ‘ <NAME> , <NAME> , ’ said the other , shaking his head , ‘ it ’ s for you to do all that .
__label__0	Did the neighborhood of some mysterious body retain it firmly imbedded in ether ?
__label__1	Mr Blandois , not at all put out by this omission on the part of the correspondents of the house of <NAME> and Co. , took his pocket-book from his breast-pocket , selected a letter from that receptacle , and handed it to Mr Flintwinch .
__label__0	Now then , prepare to receive orders for a new tableau !
__label__0	There can not be two roads .
__label__0	The artillery was composed of the old culverin of the château , taken in 1339 at the attack on <NAME> , one of the first occasions of the use of cannon in history , and which had not been fired off for five centuries .
__label__1	I threw it off in argument some little time back .
__label__1	‘ You are fevered and ill. ’ <NAME> waved his hand carelessly , and concealing the indisposition he really felt , now that the excitement which had sustained him was over , took a hurried farewell of <NAME> , and left him .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> describes over and over again .
__label__1	I dare say you would , <NAME> .
__label__1	She stood , like a spirit , beside him , and he bent over his work .
__label__0	The country was still barren , and looking as if no living being had ever set foot in it .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> and my companions were also dressing .
__label__1	I ’ ve never took charity yet , nor yet has any one belonging to me .
__label__0	`` Well , '' cried I , `` do you not see these different layers of calcareous rocks and the first indication of slate strata ? ''
__label__0	A boat was let down .
__label__1	As he said this with his widest smile , and bent down close to her to pat his horse ’ s neck , <NAME> meeting his eyes , saw , rather than heard him say , ‘ There is no news of the ship ! ’ Confused , frightened , shrinking from him , and not even sure that he had said those words , for he seemed to have shown them to her in some extraordinary manner through his smile , instead of uttering them , <NAME> faintly said that she was obliged to him , but she would not write ; she had nothing to say .
__label__1	For amusement , they walk , run , fish , paint , read , and ride out to take the air in carriages provided for the purpose .
__label__1	Oliver held up the bottom of the pocket with one hand , as he had seen the Dodger hold it , and drew the handkerchief lightly out of it with the other .
__label__1	I judged him to be about my own age , but he was much taller , and he had a way of spinning himself about that was full of appearance .
__label__1	I had taken care to have it well understood in <NAME> Britain when my birthday was .
__label__1	‘ They are not worth your notice , ’ said the dismal man .
__label__0	`` The convicts discovered her in her little harbour only eight days ago , they put to sea in her , and -- '' `` And ? ''
__label__1	My father ( a farmer ) made a will and left his farm and stock and so forth to my mother for her life .
__label__1	As they go down the little street and the <NAME> pause for a minute looking after them , Mrs. Bagnet remarks to the worthy Lignum that <NAME> `` almost clings to <NAME> like , and seems to be really fond of him . ''
__label__1	‘ This is not all of ’ em , even as we already know ’ em , ’ said <NAME> , with many nods of hidden meaning .
__label__1	But its sound had revived a long train of miserable <NAME> , and the procession would not stop with the bell , but continued to march on .
__label__1	Having made various ineffective attempts to fit the parcel ( which was some two feet square ) into the crown thereof , <NAME> took it under his arm , and after putting on his fingerless gloves with great precision and nicety , keeping his eyes fixed upon <NAME> all the time , he adjusted his hat upon his head with as much care , real or pretended , as if it were a bran-new one of the most expensive quality , and at last departed on his errand .
__label__0	As to bottles and tumblers , that was only play .
__label__0	“ Because the ‘ <NAME> ’ is a steam-yacht , and I can not perceive any trace of smoke either above or near that vessel. ” “ Perhaps she is simply sailing , ” observed <NAME> .
__label__0	Let us not forget that , according to <NAME> 's narrative , there were thousands of natives on <NAME> , and if your brother -- if his companions are prisoners -- '' `` I hope , <NAME> , our artillery will protect the <NAME> better than the <NAME> was protected by her guns .
__label__0	Their labours were now carried on with feverish ardour .
__label__1	I felt very ignorant , but what could I do ?
__label__0	<NAME> proposed to return to this enchanting island the next day , for he wished to depopulate it of all the eatable quadrupeds .
__label__1	He had now an opportunity of observing that as to the phrenological formation of the backs of their heads , the Professing Philanthropists were uncommonly like the Pugilists .
__label__0	During several hours the <NAME> floated in these brilliant waves , and our admiration increased as we watched the marine monsters disporting themselves like salamanders .
__label__0	II. , p. Attack upon an <NAME> .
__label__1	The right hand path , friend , is the road. -- There is no ill news for our good gentleman , I hope ? ’ <NAME> thanked him , and made him a hasty answer in the negative ; he was turning back , when his attention was caught by the voice of a child .
__label__0	<NAME> such a scene in an appropriate setting , the whole lit up with a dim and wavering light , and you can perhaps form some idea how it struck me when it first burst upon me . ''
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> takes out his papers , asks permission to place them on a golden talisman of a table at my <NAME> 's elbow , puts on his spectacles , and begins to read by the light of a shaded lamp .
__label__1	A bran-new <NAME> , redolent of fresh mortar and size , and fronting nothing at all , had taken for its sign The <NAME> ; but that might be rash enterprise -- and then it hoped to sell drink to the workmen .
__label__1	<NAME> as the picture was , its very flatness and extent , which left nothing to the imagination , tamed it down and cramped its interest .
__label__0	Still , like energetic men they made ready for a new struggle with the elements , and with themselves , in case they should feel themselves growing faint-hearted .
__label__0	It was doubtful , yet <NAME> resolved to dare everything in order to rejoin his companions .
__label__0	At the end of October the embassy arrived at <NAME> , a pretty town , the rajah of which was an inveterate opium-smoker .
__label__1	<NAME> had , by this time , put her hand in <NAME> ’ s ; and was looking very earnestly , and with increasing agitation , into every new street into which they turned .
__label__1	`` What have I to do with that , or what have you ?
__label__0	`` How can you doubt it , <NAME> ?
__label__0	“ A little -- some fifty feet , ” replied the doctor , who kept his eyes fixed on the barometer .
__label__1	I used to think there were so many whom you might have married , who would not have brought such charge and trouble on you , and who would have made your home a worthier home .
__label__0	After a thousand scenes of pillage , of vexation , and attacks by armed forces , their caravan arrived , in October , at the vast oasis of <NAME> .
__label__1	'No , I know you 're not .
__label__1	‘ A lady ! ’ says <NAME> , pluming his ruffled feathers .
__label__1	The common welfare was my business ; charity , mercy , forbearance , and benevolence , were , all , my business .
__label__0	Whole `` smalas '' of penguins , standing motionless in interminable rows , brayed their protest against the invasion of an intruder -- I allude to myself .
__label__1	Although she sometimes asked a question , she never seemed to expect a reply , but rambled on as if she were in the habit of doing so when no one but herself was present .
__label__1	`` Have you many pupils , Mr .
__label__0	“ I think so , too , ” returned <NAME> , “ and these arms and tools will make up the stores of <NAME> .
__label__0	“ Blessed be God for having vouchsafed to me the joy before I die of having pressed your friendly hands , and having heard , once more , the language of my country ! ” The missionary here grew weak again , and the whole day went by between hope and fear , <NAME> deeply moved , and <NAME> drawing his hand over his eyes more than once when he thought that no one saw him .
__label__1	I wake , of course , when we get under weigh , for there is a good deal of noise .
__label__1	But he suffered Mr Casby to go out , without offering any further remark , and then took a peep at him over the little green window-blinds .
__label__1	Her darling was a pleasant sight too , embracing her and thanking her , and protesting against her taking so much trouble for her -- which last she only dared to do playfully , or <NAME> , sorely hurt , would have retired to her own chamber and cried .
__label__1	Meantime , all holy angels shower blessings on his head , and prosper and preserve him. ’ She was hurrying past <NAME> , when he threw himself before her , and implored her to think , but once again , upon the fate to which she was precipitately hastening .
__label__0	Accordingly , they were left on one of the <NAME> , <NAME> , in 12 degrees 15 minutes S. lat , and 169 degrees W. long .
__label__1	We are not going to wear the bottoms of our boilers out any faster than we wear ’ em out now , for all the humbugging sentiment in <NAME> and Ireland. ’ By way of ‘ going in ’ to the fullest extent , <NAME> rejoined , ‘ Mr .
__label__1	‘ She goes on errands as well as any one. ’ <NAME> laughed .
__label__1	But <NAME> had gone home after dressing her mistress , and the fat boy came back again more disturbed than before .
__label__0	It was about this time that the question began to be mooted whether it would not be right to reopen some communication with the Englishmen at <NAME> .
__label__1	The son of my old friend <NAME> , of <NAME> , is a born fool , Sir. ’ Here the <NAME> laughed till he was almost black .
__label__1	He lent it at ten , and thought that pretty high .
__label__0	From the moment that <NAME> had fallen by his side , <NAME> had not ceased his attentions to him .
__label__1	<NAME> was in attendance , and loitered about until the expected train came in .
__label__0	Obliquely to the oval of the island ran a stream through a wide meadow falling into the sea on the west by a narrow mouth .
__label__1	In a very little time <NAME> comes down and tells him that <NAME> will join him directly and place herself under his protection to accompany him where he pleases .
__label__1	We desire that , too ; that he may not by any chance be made her prey again .
__label__1	Still more , when his mourning 'at is unfortunately made so small as that the weight of the black feathers brings it off , try to keep it on how you may. ” A ghost-seeing effect in <NAME> 's own countenance informed me that <NAME> had entered the room .
__label__1	<NAME> , wines , all the accessories we wanted , and all of the best , were given out by our host from his dumb-waiter ; and when they had made the circuit of the table , he always put them back again .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> and brother <NAME> entered the counting-house together ; but <NAME> , without looking round , impatiently waved his hand as a caution that profound silence must be observed , and followed the nib of the inexperienced pen with strained and eager eyes .
__label__1	‘ He knows best , ’ meaning <NAME> , ‘ for he has always been at my elbow , whispering me .
__label__0	<NAME> and <NAME> were called into existence by the Creator probably at the same period of time .
__label__0	`` I will go and let him know . ''
__label__0	How plant the flag of his country among the waves ?
__label__1	‘ I am dull , but you couldn ’ t have made me talk if you were. ’ Some little touch of conscience answering this perception of her having gained a purpose , called bloom enough into Mrs <NAME> ’ s face to make it look brighter as she sat smiling her best smile on her dear <NAME> , and shaking her head with an affectionate playfulness .
__label__1	It appeared to be something droll , for occasionally there was a laugh and a cry of `` Silence ! ''
__label__1	It ’ s a pleasure to me to look at you. ’ ‘ I have nothing left to begin with , ’ returned <NAME> , blushing , ‘ because I was going to say that it was a pleasure to me to look at you , <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Yes , and I am afraid I was seldom or never as good as I ought to have been , <NAME> .
__label__1	Their way lay , for the most part , through the low grounds , and open plains ; and except these distant places , and occasionally some men working in the fields , or lounging on the bridges under which they passed , to see them creep along , nothing encroached on their monotonous and secluded track .
__label__0	A piece of crimson damask excited the most vivid admiration from all the assembled natives .
__label__1	I know that I lounged about the streets , insufficiently and unsatisfactorily fed .
__label__0	At the same moment the crumbling masses of the hill slid down upon them and they instantly concluded that they were doomed to be buried alive .
__label__1	“ But I do n't know how to originate , in such a case .
__label__1	It ’ s Gaffer ! ’ They ran to the rope , leaving him gasping there .
__label__1	It was idle to say more , so I proposed that we should join <NAME> and <NAME> , who were a little in advance , and I gave up <NAME> in despair .
__label__0	The expeditions of <NAME> were followed by those of <NAME> and of <NAME> , to whom we owe , if not new discoveries , important observations on the tides , the variation of the weather and the temperature , and on a number of natural phenomena .
__label__1	His long , fantastic legs which might have reached the ground , were cocked up , and crossed after a quaint , fantastic fashion ; his sinewy arms were bare ; and his hands rested on his knees .
__label__0	<NAME> too , as well as heat , could be modified , tempered , and _genialized_ if I may use the expression , by the air .
__label__1	A rickety table , with spare bundles of papers , yellow and ragged from long carriage in the pocket , ostentatiously displayed upon its top ; a couple of stools set face to face on opposite sides of this crazy piece of furniture ; a treacherous old chair by the fire-place , whose withered arms had hugged full many a client and helped to squeeze him dry ; a second-hand wig box , used as a depository for blank writs and declarations and other small forms of law , once the sole contents of the head which belonged to the wig which belonged to the box , as they were now of the box itself ; two or three common books of practice ; a jar of ink , a pounce box , a stunted hearth-broom , a carpet trodden to shreds but still clinging with the tightness of desperation to its tacks -- these , with the yellow wainscot of the walls , the smoke-discoloured ceiling , the dust and cobwebs , were among the most prominent decorations of the office of Mr <NAME> .
__label__1	I am exhausted. ’ ‘ It is very bad weather , monsieur , ’ said the landlady .
__label__1	All this time I was deeply anxious to know what she was going to do with me ; but she took her dinner in profound silence , except when she occasionally fixed her eyes on me sitting opposite , and said , ‘ Mercy upon us ! ’ which did not by any means relieve my anxiety .
__label__0	`` If I were sure of hitting him , I would do so , even at the risk of having my head torn open , but he would flee at my approach .
__label__1	Neither was his manner influenced .
__label__1	‘ Come in , my love , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	We inhabit a new world , peopled by ourselves -- the projectile !
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> was then crossed , and on the 10th July , <NAME> arrived at <NAME> , the furthest point reached by his predecessors .
__label__0	D'Entrecasteaux then proceeded to reconnoitre the northern portion of the archipelago , and to trade with the natives .
__label__0	Sometimes profound obscurity thickened around him , and then he could see nothing , so feeble was the light ; but this was a purely passing phenomenon , and due to the raft , which , floating above his head , intercepted the solar rays and made the night replace the day .
__label__1	‘ I always like to hear a good argument , ’ continued the bagman , ‘ a sharp one , like this : it ’ s very improving ; but this little argument about women brought to my mind a story I have heard an old uncle of mine tell , the recollection of which , just now , made me say there were rummer things than women to be met with , sometimes. ’ ‘ I should like to hear that same story , ’ said the red-faced man with the cigar .
__label__1	‘ You will find her , ’ pursued my aunt , ‘ as good , as beautiful , as earnest , as disinterested , as she has always been .
__label__1	<NAME> , without the least discomposure or surprise , but congratulating the old lady in an approving manner on being ‘ very lively to-night ’ , handed her back to her chair .
__label__1	The day being very warm and the street a quiet one , the windows were wide open ; and it was easy to hear through the <NAME> blinds all that passed inside .
__label__1	There was another long pause .
__label__1	On the contrary , they are most acceptable .
__label__1	He has a scar on the corner of his mouth , two cuts on and under his arm , and the letter E on his arm. ’ ‘ Ran away , negro boy <NAME> .
__label__1	Why I KNOW of fifteen and sixpence that came to <NAME> one night last month , to see me dance the <NAME> Fling ; and what ’ s the consequence ?
__label__1	‘ He is rather anxious , ’ pursued the old gentleman , ‘ to have you in his own service -- take care what you ’ re doing , or you will fall down and hurt yourself. ’ ‘ To have me in his service , <NAME> ? ’ cried <NAME> , who had stopped short in his work and faced about on the ladder like some dexterous tumbler .
__label__1	Quickening their pace , they turned up a road upon the left hand .
__label__1	and he won ’ t come in. ’ ‘ Who ? ’ cried Mr Dombey .
__label__0	48 , would deliver a lecture on Mormonism in car No .
__label__1	Thereupon all the young ladies rose and began shaking their skirts out behind .
__label__1	‘ However , ’ said <NAME> , appearing to pluck up his spirits , ‘ we ’ ll hope it ’ s not so bad as that comes to .
__label__0	The cats brought by the visitors were welcomed with special enthusiasm , for the island was infested with immense numbers of rats , who worked havoc on the plantations .
__label__0	All his apprehensions came from this quarter , and he dreaded every instant to hear some flourish of trumpets , announcing the arrival of the lieutenant of the <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ What do you suppose he meant ? ’ ‘ Mas ’ r <NAME> , ’ he replied , ‘ I ’ ve put the question to myself a mort o ’ times , and never found no answer .
__label__1	Whether there was , or not , we must leave the reader to determine , when we have faithfully recorded the behaviour of the individual in question .
__label__1	<NAME> walked in , taking her sister with her ; and they went up-stairs with powder going before and powder stopping behind , and were left in a spacious semicircular drawing-room , one of several drawing-rooms , where there was a parrot on the outside of a golden cage holding on by its beak , with its scaly legs in the air , and putting itself into many strange upside-down postures .
__label__1	You see ? ” “ Yes ! ” “ Perhaps he obtained it as his last and utmost precaution against evil , yesterday .
__label__1	He stood at the window , looking over the prison-parapet with its grim spiked border , and breathed a benediction through the summer haze towards the distant land where she was rich and prosperous .
__label__1	But when she sat down on the seat , she was a handsome lady still ; and well I knew the bright eye with its lofty look , that had been a light in my very dreams at school .
__label__0	monsoon before reaching the <NAME> , which form the extreme north of the <NAME> .
__label__0	My uncle came out of his cabin pale , haggard , thin , but full of enthusiasm , his eyes dilated with pleasure and satisfaction .
__label__0	“ Yes , but we are assured on one point , ” answered <NAME> .
__label__0	In most <NAME> towns and villages we have been regarded as demigods , and treated in consequence with universal kindness , civility , and veneration ; but here , alas , what a contrast !
__label__1	‘ <NAME> ? ’ ‘ No -- the other gentleman. ’ <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Yes , sir. ’ ‘ Poor Quanko -- never recovered it -- bowled on , on my account -- bowled off , on his own -- died , sir. ’ Here the stranger buried his countenance in a brown jug , but whether to hide his emotion or imbibe its contents , we can not distinctly affirm .
__label__1	For he was furnished with that completeness that if the coach-lamps had been blown and stormed out , which did occasionally happen , he had only to shut himself up inside , keep the flint and steel sparks well off the straw , and get a light with tolerable safety and ease ( if he were lucky ) in five minutes .
__label__1	‘ His daughter has gone to fetch him , but I can ’ t wait ; therefore , if you please , I will leave a message for him with you. ’ ‘ You see , my friend , ’ <NAME> put in , ‘ we are the kind of people who know the value of time , and you are the kind of people who don ’ t know the value of time. ’ ‘ I have not , ’ retorted <NAME> , after surveying him from head to foot , ‘ the honour of knowing _you_ , —but if you mean that you can make more money of your time than I can of mine , I should judge from your appearance , that you are about right. ’ ‘ And when you have made it , you can keep it too , I should think , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	Our not remote ancestors held the right of life and death over the surrounding vulgar .
__label__0	`` The wind is breaking the ice against which we are propped , just as it has that of the promontory , and we shall be either driven out or buried ! ''
__label__1	His hair was thin and weak , which was partly attributable to his having never devoted much time to its arrangement , and partly to his having worn for five- and-twenty years the forensic wig which hung on a block beside him .
__label__1	The hysterics called up <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> did not reply , but pointed upwards .
__label__1	‘ Or abroad. ’ ‘ Surely , ’ the <NAME> answered .
__label__0	`` They are mistaken , '' answered <NAME> ; `` if they would only reflect , and consider our condition , they would see we are simply going from one imprudence to another . ''
__label__0	Moreover , there was some delay in the return of the messengers who had been sent by the King of <NAME> to the different chiefs on the banks of the river , and lastly , <NAME> ( the <NAME> Water ) had to be consulted in order to ensure the safety of the travellers in their journey to the sea .
__label__0	Still farther away , a black spot almost invisible , already caught <NAME> ’ s eye .
__label__1	‘ Stay here the while , all !
__label__1	'You seem to think , ' retorted the doctor , 'that everybody is disposed to be hard-hearted to-day , except yourself , <NAME> .
__label__1	I think -- I mean , he told us -- that he had been in practice three or four years and that if he could have hoped to contend through three or four more , he would not have made the voyage on which he was bound .
__label__0	I count on you , Pencroft. ” “ No , <NAME> , ” replied the sailor ; “ I have the rigging of the vessel to finish and to look after , and you will have to do without me. ” “ And you , <NAME> ? ” “ I must go to the corral to-morrow , <NAME> , ” replied the lad .
__label__1	‘ I -- I -- remember it very well indeed. ’ ‘ <NAME> is the lady I speak of , ’ said brother Charles .
__label__0	Twenty-three men died , amongst them <NAME> , the astronomer , who was much regretted .
__label__1	Being roused in the morning at the appointed time , and roused with difficulty , after his late fatigues , <NAME> instructed <NAME> to make a fire in the yard of sundry pieces of old timber , and to prepare some coffee for breakfast ; for the better furnishing of which repast he entrusted him with certain small moneys , to be expended in the purchase of hot rolls , butter , sugar , <NAME> bloaters , and other articles of housekeeping ; so that in a few minutes a savoury meal was smoking on the board .
__label__1	‘ Oh , if it ’ s nothing particular , ’ said <NAME> , with a smile , ‘ you can speak with me first. ’ ‘ I think I ’ d better see arter it at once , ’ said <NAME> , still hesitating .
__label__1	In the yard , was the man with the shadowy grievance respecting the Fund which the <NAME> embezzled , who had got up at five in the morning to complete the copying of a perfectly unintelligible history of that transaction , which he had committed to Mr <NAME> ’ s care , as a document of the last importance , calculated to stun the Government and effect the <NAME> ’ s downfall .
__label__0	“ I know no more about him than you do , captain , ” said <NAME> .
__label__1	He had never experienced a greater relief than in hearing the sweet voice of the young lady as she begged her to be calm , and not allow herself to become the prey of such fearful fancies .
__label__1	You leave your good father , my dear , in hands as earnest and as loving as your own ; he shall be taken every conceivable care of ; during the next fortnight , while you are in <NAME> and thereabouts , even <NAME> 's shall go to the wall ( comparatively speaking ) before him .
__label__1	‘ When she finds how much we know , and how we know it , ’ he said , ‘ and that she is clearly compromised already , we are not without strong hopes that we may be enabled through her means to punish the other two effectually .
__label__1	‘ You can if you like .
__label__1	‘ Ah ! ’ said <NAME> , taking up her curls , and running them over his hand like water , ‘ here ’ s another orphan , you see , sir .
__label__1	She bore him company with her pride , resentment , hatred , all as plain to him as her beauty ; with nothing plainer to him than her hatred of him .
__label__0	am I on the <NAME> ? ''
__label__0	<NAME> ’ s approval was most welcome to the young fellows ; they had great faith in the practical good sense of the pilot , and not without reason .
__label__0	As for the <NAME> , which are comprised in this number , they were inhabited by a warlike race , very superior in intelligence to those of the <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> there no party of her own , in other times , on which the stars had shone ?
__label__0	If , however , the forests of <NAME> failed him with their wild beasts , agoutis , peccaries , and cabiais , the birds flew in flocks from the banks of the river and fearlessly perched on the jangada .
__label__0	Only by the exercise of wonderful patience and tact were the <NAME> able to avert bloodshed on this emergency .
__label__1	In the morning she was just the same , <NAME> .
__label__0	They had cold water , that is to say , the most powerful sedative that can be employed against inflammation of wounds , the most efficacious therapeutic agent in grave cases , and the one which is now adopted by all physicians .
__label__1	That is the subject _we_ think of , and it gives us , from morning to night , enough to think about , without embarrassing our heads concerning others .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> had made his unavailing expedition to <NAME> in the midst of a great pressure of business .
__label__0	he kept saying to himself ; `` what ship is that ?
__label__1	‘ Mr Dombey , to a man in your position from a man in mine , there is no show of subservience compatible with the transaction of business between us , that I should think sufficient .
__label__1	The <NAME> changed the motion of her head , which had not yet left off nodding , and suddenly began to shake it from side to side , with a vehemence which threatened to dislocate her neck .
__label__1	Has a perfectly natural and easy air and is not in the least embarrassed by the great presence into which he comes .
__label__1	Pretty Nell ! ’ Mr <NAME> looked , as he was , all open-mouthed astonishment .
__label__1	Let the Doctor play the winning game ; I will play the losing one .
__label__0	Leave him to go off alone , after we ’ ve been all over the world together !
__label__1	<NAME> at me. ” “ Oh , botheration ! ” returned <NAME> , with a lighter and more good-humoured laugh , “ do n't _you_ be moral ! ” “ How have I done what I have done ? ” said <NAME> ; “ how do I do what I do ? ” “ <NAME> through paying me to help you , I suppose .
__label__0	<NAME> had left the jangada , but instead of mounting to the fort he had made for the village , crossing the ravine which led off from the right on the level of the bank .
__label__0	<NAME> 's visage darkened with the skies , and for two days the poor fellow experienced constant fright .
__label__1	I think <NAME> ’ s means were straitened at about this time ; but it is little to the purpose .
__label__0	Nevertheless , I want to ask you whether it is your intention to go ashore , captain ? ''
__label__0	“ Would you like me to try and swim across ? ” said <NAME> .
__label__1	Is it not enough that I should have suffered as I have , night and day ; that I should almost have sunk in my own estimation from very shame of having been brought into contact with such people ; but must I also be exposed to this unjust and most unfounded charge ! ’ ‘ You will have the goodness to recollect , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ that when you use such terms as “ unjust ” , and “ unfounded ” , you charge me , in effect , with stating that which is untrue. ’ ‘ I do , ’ said <NAME> with honest indignation .
__label__1	‘ I will have a respectful , prompt , and ready bearing towards myself , ’ he continued , ‘ and towards <NAME> , and towards your mother .
__label__1	<NAME> , ’ said Mrs. Leo Hunter , ‘ I must make you promise not to stir from my side the whole day .
__label__0	A solemn ceremonial which he saw at <NAME> , no longer allowed him to doubt the existence of the practice .
__label__1	Every one had a friendly nod and a kind word for “ poor Mrs. <NAME> ” ; and sometimes , when she stopped to exchange a few words with a neighbour at the conclusion of the service in the little row of elm-trees which leads to the church porch , or lingered behind to gaze with a mother ’ s pride and fondness upon her healthy boy , as he sported before her with some little companions , her careworn face would lighten up with an expression of heartfelt gratitude ; and she would look , if not cheerful and happy , at least tranquil and contented .
__label__1	But Mr Carker rising to depart , she only thanked him with her mother ’ s prayers and blessings ; thanks so rich when paid out of the Heart ’ s mint , especially for any service Mr <NAME> had rendered , that he might have given back a large amount of change , and yet been overpaid .
__label__0	<NAME> as I had been to the steam ferry boats of the <NAME> , I found the long oars of the boatmen but sorry means of locomotion .
__label__0	As he was about to enter the camp , <NAME> , passing among the officers approached and remained motionless before him .
__label__1	Softened sounds and hum of traffic pass it and flow on irregularly into the lonely Precincts ; but very little else goes by , save violent rushes of wind .
__label__1	‘ Do it ! ’ The <NAME> was so impressed by the possession of his tremendous secret -- by the fact of <NAME> Dombey being at that moment under his roof , while the innocent and unconscious <NAME> sat opposite to him -- that a perspiration broke out on his forehead , and he found it impossible , while slowly drying the same , glazed hat in hand , to keep his eyes off Mr Toots ’ s face .
__label__0	At all events , the poor creature was quite quiet and sad !
__label__1	Never separate the two , like the heathen waggoner .
__label__1	'You do n't mean to say that 's the boy who had the fever , I hope ? '
__label__1	In fact , there was a story current among us ( I have no idea , and never had , on what authority , but I have believed it for so many years that I feel quite certain it is true ) , that on a frosty day , one winter-time , he actually did bestow his gaiters on a beggar-woman , who occasioned some scandal in the neighbourhood by exhibiting a fine infant from door to door , wrapped in those garments , which were universally recognized , being as well known in the vicinity as the <NAME> .
__label__1	It was not like sleep -- and yet it must have been , or why those pleasant dreams of the little scholar all night long !
__label__0	`` It 's strange , '' said <NAME> , `` that a private person should try to make his way from <NAME> to Behring Strait .
__label__0	364 `` <NAME> , I 'VE <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> '' .
__label__0	The doctor insisted on joining the party .
__label__1	‘ “ My love , ” said the baron .
__label__0	It was evidently the cue of both sides to be silent .
__label__0	<NAME> kept his name a secret ; otherwise no one would have gone with him .
__label__1	‘ Mr Wegg , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ as I did name to you , I think , on a former occasion , if not on former occasions -- ’ ‘ On former occasions , ’ interrupted <NAME> .
__label__1	Indeed , so much affection for him had been added in this one evening to my gratitude that I hoped I already began to understand him through that mingled feeling .
__label__1	troubled me none the less because I went on .
__label__0	The <NAME> could never be reached , but was it not possible that her surface could be carefully observed ?
__label__1	As I had a sorrowful wish to see the old place once more , before it was locked up , I engaged to meet them there in the evening .
__label__1	<NAME> would have walked into any poverty-stricken debtor ’ s house , and pointed him out to a bailiff , though in attendance upon a young child ’ s death-bed , without the smallest concern , because it would have been a matter quite in the ordinary course of business , and the man would have been an offender against his only code of morality .
__label__1	‘ With what I shall call your unhallowed opinions , you have been quite shocking this lady : who , as I have already told you , is a born lady , and who , as I have not already told you , has had her own marriage misfortunes to the tune of tens of thousands of pounds—tens of Thousands of <NAME> ! ’ ( he repeated it with great relish ) .
__label__0	It was useless to think of crossing <NAME> , with its fanatic population , in <NAME> dress .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> nods his sagacious head , advances it yet closer , and drops into a whisper .
__label__0	It is the depôt for all the traffic between <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , and itself produces choice merchandize , silks , saffron , horses , and asafoetida .
__label__1	But though her glance took sharp cognizance of the sleeper , it was sharp too for the waking man ; and when he touched her hand with his , and in spite of all his caution , made a chinking , golden sound , it was as bright and greedy as a raven ’ s .
__label__1	‘ You ’ re to have it every day , he says .
__label__1	‘ For what , ’ says the good woman , ‘ must his feelings be , if he was to come upon any of the poor servants that he once deceived into thinking him immensely rich ! ’ Cook is so struck by this moral consideration , that <NAME> improves it with several pious axioms , original and selected .
__label__0	I am neither an orator nor a man of science , and I had no idea of addressing you in public ; but my friend <NAME> has told me that you would like to hear me , and I am quite at your service .
__label__1	And when you used to tell the stories ?
__label__0	Have me hanged , if you choose. ” “ Hanged ! ” exclaimed <NAME> , overcome by a sudden feeling of anger .
__label__1	Em ’ ly was took bad with fever , and , what is very strange to me is , -- maybe ‘ tis not so strange to scholars , -- the language of that country went out of her head , and she could only speak her own , that no one unnerstood .
__label__1	After an interval of Mrs. Kidgerbury -- the oldest inhabitant of <NAME> , I believe , who went out charing , but was too feeble to execute her conceptions of that art -- we found another treasure , who was one of the most amiable of women , but who generally made a point of falling either up or down the kitchen stairs with the tray , and almost plunged into the parlour , as into a bath , with the tea-things .
__label__1	If it won ’ t , we all remark to each other that it ’ s very cold , rub our hands , cover ourselves with coats and cloaks , and lie down again to doze , talk , and read ( provided as aforesaid ) , until dinner-time .
__label__0	“ What a magnificent beast ! ” cried <NAME> .
__label__1	I have seen enough of you to know that you are a bully and coward .
__label__1	Such a precious loud hymn , <NAME> , while the tea was a brewing ; such a grace , such eatin ’ and drinkin ’ !
__label__0	Behind a huge pyramidal rock they found a hole in the mountain-side , like the mouth of a great tunnel .
__label__0	The natives now demanded good <NAME> dollars and <NAME> clothing , both of which were altogether wanting on the <NAME> .
__label__0	Nothing could be easier than to execute this project , and this is how the engineer intended to set to work .
__label__1	Chokings and nervous jerkings , however , are nothing new to me when I think with anxiety of those I love .
__label__1	We were twelve boarders , and there were two Miss Donnys , twins .
__label__0	However , two hypotheses come here into our consideration .
__label__0	At Oubinsk he gave his horse a whole night ’ s rest , for he wished on the next day to accomplish the hundred versts which lie between <NAME> and <NAME> without halting .
__label__0	In another twenty-four hours , or forty-eight at the most , if the land does not appear , <NAME> will steer to the north again ! ''
__label__1	‘ If he has seen any of them , he must have seen them in the street , going to , or returning from , their work , and not here .
__label__0	Moreover , it was unnecessary to manufacture rigging , that of the <NAME> having been saved entire , so that the hull only of the vessel needed to be constructed .
__label__0	“ Yes , ” answered the <NAME> , “ there are some things even a plain merchant can not receive without returning. ” “ <NAME> ? ” “ Blows , young man .
__label__0	On the 21st of February , at six o'clock in the morning , the boat , with us all ( we numbered thirteen ) in it , left the little creek and doubled the point of <NAME> .
__label__1	“ Why need you tell me what I have not asked ?
__label__0	Like all convalescents , he was tremendously hungry , and the reporter allowed him to eat as much as he liked , for he trusted to that instinct , which is too often wanting in reasoning beings , to keep the orang from any excess .
__label__1	I can ’ t be drowned. ’ ‘ I can be ! ’ returned <NAME> , in a desperate , clenched voice .
__label__0	“ Now , then , tell me , without a moment ’ s thought -- you understand -- the first number than comes into your head. ” “ 76223 , ” answered <NAME> , all in a breath .
__label__1	I tried to eat my parting breakfast , but my tears dropped upon my bread-and-butter , and trickled into my tea .
__label__1	The old abbey flourished then ; and the five sisters , living on its fair domains , paid yearly dues to the black monks of St Benedict , to which fraternity it belonged .
__label__1	<NAME> ! ” My uncle gave a loud stamp on the boot in the energy of the moment , and -- found that it was gray morning , and he was sitting in the wheelwright ’ s yard , on the box of an old Edinburgh mail , shivering with the cold and wet and stamping his feet to warm them !
__label__0	Who this beneficent stranger is , whose intervention has , so fortunately for us , been manifested on many occasions , I can not imagine .
__label__1	‘ No better yet ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
__label__1	says <NAME> slightly , `` we have n't got much good out of <NAME> .
__label__0	Thirteen days later , both ships came in sight of <NAME> at the entrance to the <NAME> of <NAME> , which they hastened to enter .
__label__1	<NAME> was gone ; had been besieged in its <NAME> and “ suspended , ” when the last tidings came over .
__label__0	At every turn of the path we were following , the lake appeared in all its length and breadth .
__label__1	I may have been seen to slap her face -- nothing more .
__label__0	Some , such as those of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and others , transmitted their good wishes ; the rest maintained a prudent silence , quietly awaiting the result .
__label__1	Though that seems wretchedly prejudiced—does it not ? —for I never saw him .
__label__0	<NAME> also observed the presence of minerals on the hills , and his discovery has been verified in late years by the proved existence of gold , iron , copper , coal , and nickel .
__label__0	The certificates could be bought at waste-paper prices .
__label__0	`` In your little room , sir , '' replied <NAME> , `` and in your museum , sir ; and I should have already classed all your fossils , sir .
__label__1	Her mother died when she was a baby , and her father denied her nothing .
__label__1	' I ask one promise , ' said <NAME> .
__label__1	Lastly , the looking-glass reflects <NAME> and <NAME> , and two other stuffed <NAME> interposed between the rest of the company and possible accidents .
__label__1	‘ Is fork , sir , fork , ’ replied Mr Swiveller slapping his pocket .
__label__0	But my eye was no sooner applied to the glass than it was quickly snatched out of my hands .
__label__0	Few as those hours were , they seemed to those on board as if their end would never come .
__label__0	`` Well , gentlemen , '' said he , `` I 'm off , you see ; and , if you will examine my passport when I get back , you will be able to judge whether I have accomplished the journey agreed upon . ''
__label__1	She , too , was turning homeward , when she heard a strange sound .
__label__1	Was he much the better for his wealth ?
__label__0	`` The trap-hole alone would take ten or fifteen minutes to open . ''
__label__1	She also stumbled , with a large balance of success against her failures , through various philanthropic recommendations to Try our Mixture , Try our <NAME> , <NAME> our Orange-flavoured Pekoe , challenging competition at the head of <NAME> ; and various cautions to the public against spurious establishments and adulterated articles .
__label__1	‘ Be careful how you go , my dear friend .
__label__0	<NAME> went up to him and asked if he had lost his way .
__label__1	This grew so strong with me , that I resolved to go back to the yard before I took my dinner , and ask the boat-builder if he thought his attempting to return by sea at all likely ?
__label__1	`` Yet , <NAME> , '' said I , looking round , `` I miss something , surely , that I am accustomed to ? ''
__label__1	‘ I took care of it , for you , or I dare say it would have been lost long before this , ’ replied <NAME> .
__label__0	It was all clear now .
__label__1	R. W. scratched his head and looked apologetically all round the table until he came to his wife , when observing her as it were shrouded in a more sombre veil than before , he once more hinted , ‘ My dear , I am really afraid you are not altogether enjoying yourself ? ’ To which she once more replied , ‘ On the contrary , R. W. Quite so. ’ The wretched Mr <NAME> ’ s position at this agreeable entertainment was truly pitiable .
__label__0	As heroic as they had before been credulous , fastening ropes round their waists , they rushed into the waves to the aid of those on the wreck .
__label__1	Would you recommend his being spoken to , or his being left alone ?
__label__0	asked <NAME> , trying to keep cool .
__label__1	inquired <NAME> , casting a contemptuous look at <NAME> .
__label__0	Their ears , frightfully distended , held dangling to them disks of wood and plates of gum copal .
__label__1	‘ Yes , ’ he said without emotion , ‘ it was <NAME> , he knew .
__label__0	It costs less for fodder , and is more reliable. ” “ Well , you may have your choice , master , but I stick to my idea. ” It now was noon .
__label__0	Some unseen and mysterious obstacle intervened and stopped me .
__label__1	I have thought sometimes ; ’ Sissy very timid here ; ‘ that perhaps I tried to learn too much , and that if I had asked to be allowed to try a little less , I might have— ’ ‘ No , <NAME> , no , ’ said <NAME> , shaking his head in his profoundest and most eminently practical way .
__label__1	For this purpose there are schools in <NAME> ; and there are churches and chapels of various persuasions , in which the young women may observe that form of worship in which they have been educated .
__label__1	Now , the whole place was , or it should have been , quite as delightful a place as ever ; and yet it did not impress me in the same way .
__label__0	At this instant a kind of bouquet of flames shot forth from the crater , the brilliancy of which was visible even through the vapors .
__label__0	I merely had the armoury , generally kept jealously closed , opened , and with a severe look I pointed to it with one hand , whilst with the other I motioned the savages to the canoes .
__label__1	Get behind the door , old chap , and have the jack-towel betwixt you. ” I took the advice .
__label__1	When the morning—_the_ morning—came , and we met at breakfast , it was curious to see how eager we all were to prevent a moment ’ s pause in the conversation , and how astoundingly gay everybody was : the forced spirits of each member of the little party having as much likeness to his natural mirth , as hot-house peas at five guineas the quart , resemble in flavour the growth of the dews , and air , and rain of <NAME> .
__label__0	The rest of the ships lay to for some time to await her , but in vain , and the twelve vessels then continued their navigation upon the open sea , and not , as had been the manner hitherto , steering simply from cape to cape along the shores of <NAME> .
__label__0	The twelve men who held the balloon by twelve cords fastened to the equatorial circle , let them slip a little between their fingers , and the balloon rose several feet higher .
__label__1	I said ( in a tone of conviction ) , “ Ah-h ! ” “ Yes .
__label__0	$ 5,446,675 Such was the sum which the public poured into the treasury of the <NAME> .
__label__1	You are so very violent , that really I -- ' At this instant , Mrs. <NAME> stepped hastily forward to replace the carpet , which had been kicked up in the scuffle .
__label__0	At the same time the <NAME> element became larger and larger , and the difference between the manners of the <NAME> and their conquerors was less marked .
__label__0	<NAME> and <NAME> , during this time , had gone to fetch the boat , moored a few hundred feet higher up , on the bank of the <NAME> , and by the time they returned , <NAME> was ready to start .
__label__1	Your lodging ( which I have arranged for ) will be paid by me .
__label__1	Was it on a Monday morning , when the butcher-boy had been to our house for orders , and bought a ballad of me , which , being unacquainted with the tune , I run it over to him ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , <NAME> , right !
__label__0	They had been only a few days in port , when a sailor found a leaden plate upon which was an inscription in <NAME> .
__label__0	The truth is , that my spirits rose so rapidly , that I began to be indifferent to what had once appeared to be a terrible journey .
__label__1	Here is my umble dwelling , <NAME> ! ’ We entered a low , old-fashioned room , walked straight into from the street , and found there Mrs. Heep , who was the dead image of <NAME> , only short .
__label__1	He was to be another father to him , and they were all to live together in a garden of roses , weren ’ t they ?
__label__1	Then we all went to <NAME> , a narrow alley at a very short distance .
__label__0	Many a time , but for their devotion and courage the small band could not have gone on .
__label__0	He neither thought of eating nor drinking .
__label__1	‘ Do you mean that a prisoner forgives his prison ? ’ said she , slowly and with emphasis .
__label__1	We fed at the same times , on the same kind of viands , in the same dull manner , and with the same observances .
__label__0	It is well known what inroads the <NAME> had made under Gengis-Khan , and in 1206 this chieftain had made <NAME> , an ancient <NAME> town , his capital .
__label__0	He wished to ascertain his position and see if the ice-field had not been drifting again .
__label__1	<NAME> on in the night , <NAME> opened his eyes .
__label__1	What I ha getn , I mun mak th ’ best on. ’ ‘ <NAME> , ’ said the chairman , rising , ‘ think on ’ t agen .
__label__0	“ What does Thalcave mean ? ” asked <NAME> .
__label__0	It was now seen how advantageous the engineer 's arrangements had been .
__label__1	‘ Nor I neither , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	And having caught some inkling of our story , the young people about us -- as young as you and I are now , <NAME> -- may come to us for sympathy , and pour distresses which hope and inexperience could scarcely feel enough for , into the compassionate ears of the old bachelor brother and his maiden sister. ’ Kate smiled through her tears as <NAME> drew this picture ; but they were not tears of sorrow , although they continued to fall when he had ceased to speak .
__label__1	Yet she could not help returning ; and her work would soon fall unheeded from her hands again .
__label__0	On the contrary , they looked , if possible , more dreary and inhospitable than before .
__label__1	If the room to which my bed was removed were a sentient thing that could give evidence , I might appeal to it at this day -- who sleeps there now , I wonder ! -- to bear witness for me what a heavy heart I carried to it .
__label__0	However , the leak increased rapidly , although the pumps were worked incessantly .
__label__0	`` And do you speak thus to _me_ ? ''
__label__1	It was a prison for men .
__label__1	' I am sure I thought it was the boy , or I would n't have meddled with him .
__label__1	When we had retired for the night , and <NAME> and I had had our usual talk in our pretty room , I went out at my door again and sought my guardian among his books .
__label__1	'Will you disclose the whole ? '
__label__1	It is not necessary to make any guesses on the subject , however ; for the sudden entrance of the two young ladies whom <NAME> had seen on a former occasion , caused the conversation to flow afresh .
__label__0	The doubt caused me serious uneasiness .
__label__0	When the cart reached the palisade , it stopped .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> then seized the terrified boy by the collar with very little ceremony ; and all three were quickly inside the house .
__label__0	Seeing only certain objects and in a limited space , always in contact with the colonists , to whom he would soon become accustomed , having no desires to satisfy , better fed , better clothed , it was natural that his physical nature should gradually improve ; but was he penetrated with the sense of a new life ?
__label__0	She would only be safe by quitting <NAME> for ever .
__label__1	‘ He has never had occasion to acquire such little arts .
__label__0	<NAME> Nadia know who he was ?
__label__0	Above them they could see the blue sky-roof , and from their position were enabled to survey the surrounding country .
__label__1	To one who had been tossing on a restless bed so long , even these few green leaves and this tranquil light , although it languished among chimneys and house-tops , were pleasant things .
__label__0	Albatrosses passed in the air , the expanse of their wings being at least four yards and a half , and justly called the vultures of the ocean ; some gigantic petrels , and some damiers , a kind of small duck , the underpart of whose body is black and white ; then there were a whole series of petrels , some whitish , with brown-bordered wings , others blue , peculiar to the <NAME> seas , and so oily , as I told <NAME> , that the inhabitants of the <NAME> had nothing to do before lighting them but to put a wick in .
__label__1	When it was not too wet or inclement for her child to be with her , they went together ; at other times she was alone ; but , she never missed a single day .
__label__1	Every one waited with his grasp set , and his body bent down to the work , ready to reverse and wind in .
__label__1	You know how poor we are ’ ( it is probable he did , having some reason to know it !
__label__1	She hesitates , but he motions again , and she sits down .
__label__1	‘ You know all now , ’ she said , raising her eyes to <NAME> ’ s .
__label__1	That I could not absolutely pledge myself to like it , until I knew something more about it .
__label__1	Struck by the energy of her manner , <NAME> looked up in her face with great surprise .
__label__1	Nobody accepting the challenge , and his pipe being by this time smoked out , he proceeded to amuse himself by sketching a ground-plan of <NAME> on the table with the piece of chalk which had served him in lieu of counters ; whistling , meantime , with peculiar shrillness .
__label__0	Thus we are not surprised to learn that eight days after the landing of the King of <NAME> , <NAME> was forced to resign his office and his pension , both of which had been bestowed upon him for life by <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ I _have_ an idea ! ’ They complied ; <NAME> none the less readily , for being all abroad ; and <NAME> , seated in the centre , with his hands upon his knees , thus stated his idea , with his usual manner of having got the statement by heart .
__label__1	But in reply to these considerate representations , and many others both from <NAME> and <NAME> , <NAME> could only be brought to state that he was never merrier in his life ; and so went on all day , and so went towards home at night , still turning over and over again the same subjects , thinking over and over again the same things , and arriving over and over again at the same conclusions .
__label__1	and away with me ! ’ ‘ To-night ? ’ murmured the old man .
__label__0	To advance further under these circumstances was not only to risk his life , but to place the results of all his fatigues and efforts in jeopardy .
__label__0	Stringent orders were given , and all thieves caught in the act were flogged in the presence of their fellow-countrymen , who , however , as well as the culprits themselves , treated the affair only as a joke .
__label__0	<NAME> tradition has it that the <NAME> came in the first instance , some thirteen hundred years ago , from the <NAME> .
__label__1	And yet -- and yet -- she sends a look in that direction as if it were her heart 's desire to have that figure moved out of the way .
__label__1	I dare say they will report progress to-morrow morning . ''
__label__1	Hardly relying on my own interpretation of the indistinct sounds he made , I caused <NAME> to hear them .
__label__1	Hold me , somebody , while I laugh it out . '
__label__0	“ Considerable importance , ” replied the engineer ; “ for if it flows through the cliff there is probably some cavity , which it would be easy to render habitable after turning away the water. ” “ But is it not possible , captain , that the water flows away at the bottom of the lake , ” said <NAME> , “ and that it reaches the sea by some subterranean passage ? ” “ That might be , ” replied the engineer , “ and should it be so we shall be obliged to build our house ourselves , since nature has not done it for us. ” The colonists were about to begin to traverse the plateau to return to the <NAME> , when <NAME> gave new signs of agitation .
__label__1	‘ Who brought him to you first ? ’ pursued <NAME> ; ‘ and how , without me , could you ever have wound him in your net as you have ? ’ ‘ The net is a large one , and rather full , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	If I don ’ t brood over all I want , it is the better for me , and not the worse for anyone .
__label__1	He can ’ t go too soon .
__label__0	The reporter leaning up in a corner , watched these preparations without saying anything .
__label__1	No , nor in the hall , which was so bare that he could see that , at a glance .
__label__0	Moreover , he would not , in any event , abandon <NAME> , but would escort her to <NAME> .
__label__1	It was altogether unaccountable that a young gentleman whose imagination had been strangled in his cradle , should be still inconvenienced by its ghost in the form of grovelling sensualities ; but such a monster , beyond all doubt , was <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ The person I object to , is Mr <NAME> Wrayburn. ’ The Secretary remembered him .
__label__1	I am seldom called upon to put my young friends into mourning ; not into real mourning , that is ; Court mourning they are rather proud of .
__label__0	On this island were a number of mountains of conical form with the base very large .
__label__1	And she evidently thought so , for she wept most grievously .
__label__0	The mosquitoes of <NAME> have a deserved reputation for driving away such visitors as do not care to leave much of their blood with the redoubtable diptera .
__label__0	But the settlers were all attached to each other by a cord , as is frequently done in ascending mountains .
__label__0	A few minutes later a telegram was dispatched to the secretary of the underwriters at <NAME> , requesting answers to the following queries : `` About the ship <NAME> -- when did she leave <NAME> ?
__label__0	In fact , the substances thrown up fell back again into the abyss , and it did not seem that the lava , though swollen by the internal pressure , had yet risen to the orifice of the crater .
__label__1	When I went upstairs to bed , our house being small and this young woman 's ears sharp , I stuffed the sheet into Mrs. <NAME> 's mouth that she should n't say a word of surprise and told her all about it .
__label__1	‘ Then they are not the Misers I mean .
__label__1	Say what they are. ’ ‘ Mr .
__label__0	This was why <NAME> was in command instead of <NAME> ; why the captain was a prisoner in his cabin ; and why , in short , the <NAME> was directing her course towards <NAME> .
__label__1	The word <NAME> , besides , gives a pretty form to the lips .
__label__0	On the 12th of December Carteret sorrowfully perceived that the western monsoon had commenced .
__label__1	Thus , the rustling of an <NAME> 's wings got blended with the other echoes , and they were not wholly of earth , but had in them that breath of <NAME> .
__label__1	After a delay of two or three hours , the young ladies were informed that their services would be dispensed with until further notice , and at the expiration of two days , the name of <NAME> appeared in the list of bankrupts : <NAME> received an intimation per post , on the same morning , that the business would be , in future , carried on under the name of <NAME> , and that her assistance would no longer be required -- a piece of intelligence with which Mrs. <NAME> was no sooner made acquainted , than that good lady declared she had expected it all along and cited divers unknown occasions on which she had prophesied to that precise effect .
__label__1	And the man we have in hiding down the river , is <NAME> 's Father. ” What purpose I had in view when I was hot on tracing out and proving <NAME> 's parentage , I can not say .
__label__1	'And mind you do n't poison it , ' said <NAME> , laying his hat upon the table .
__label__1	So saying , he put his umbrella under his arm , drew off his right glove , and extended the hand of reconciliation to that most indignant gentleman ; who , thereupon , thrust his hands beneath his coat tails , and eyed the attorney with looks of scornful amazement .
__label__0	The happy ones coming from the hands of <NAME> went proudly from one house to another , showed themselves off without daring to shake themselves , like the big children that they were .
__label__0	<NAME> , who had succeeded in regaining his feet , set-out in pursuit of him , abandoning <NAME> .
__label__1	Besides , that lonely girl with the dark hair runs in my head .
__label__0	The doctor called the attention of his friends to the fact that these animals began to lose their white winter plumage , or hair , to put on their summer dress ; they were evidently getting ready for summer , while their sustenance appeared in the form of moss , poppy , saxifrage , and thin grass .
__label__0	so I suppose they drop into it. ” “ What you mean to say , <NAME> , is that the superior brilliancy of the moon eclipses that of stars of the sixth magnitude , therefore they vanish as she approaches. ” “ How beautiful all this is ! ” repeated <NAME> again and again , with her whole soul in her eyes .
__label__1	She was eighty-nine if she was a day , and tries to pass upon us now , for ten year younger .
__label__1	I shall come to you again in your regular order , '' returned Mrs. Pardiggle with demonstrative cheerfulness .
__label__0	His opinion was shared , moreover , by the geographer , as it corroborated his own notion about <NAME> .
__label__1	The young ladies laughed very heartily , and the old one tried to look amiable , but couldn ’ t manage it .
__label__1	Let ’ s have a good ‘ un ! ’ ‘ Hurrah ! ’ ‘ Noo then , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ let ’ s have yan more to end wi ’ , and then coot off as quick as you loike .
__label__0	The officers of the quarter-deck hurried to the after-part of the vessel .
__label__1	<NAME> giv ' herself a deal o ' trouble with me afore I left ( for I am almost awful dull ) , as I should view it in this light , and , viewing it in this light , as I should so put it .
__label__1	“ Kit ’ s coming to-morrow morning , I know .
__label__0	And when you are on the river and stop for the night , you must be careful to anchor far from land , for otherwise the lions come to the vessel , seize upon a man , and devour him .
__label__1	‘ Hope I see you well , sir , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ You have said more than enough to him on business , before now .
__label__1	“ Now you know all about it , <NAME> , ” said <NAME> .
__label__0	During the three years and a half which had elapsed since their escape from <NAME> , it might be said that they had had everything their own way .
__label__1	It seems to me , at this hour , that I have never seen such sunlight as on those bright April afternoons ; that I have never seen such a sunny little figure as I used to see , sitting in the doorway of the old boat ; that I have never beheld such sky , such water , such glorified ships sailing away into golden air .
__label__0	At last , after having sailed over more than 12,000 miles without meeting with a single island , in a sea where so many and such populous archipelagos were destined to be discovered , the fleet came upon two desert and sterile islands , called for that reason the <NAME> , but of which the position is indicated in much too contradictory a manner , for it to be possible to recognize them .
__label__0	Do you see , ” he added , laughing , “ I had no confidence , for my part , in your forests and your prairies ; they were out of reason .
__label__0	What cares were lavished on him to bring him back to life !
__label__1	‘ The best thing you can do , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ for the time being , at all events , is to come home with me , godmother .
__label__1	How do you do , my Lord ? ’ ‘ Veway hot , <NAME> , ’ said his Lordship .
__label__1	‘ You are a young man , ’ she said , nodding .
__label__0	`` True , '' replied the president ; `` but we will overcome that , for the force of impulsion will depend on the length of the engine and the powder employed , the latter being limited only by the resisting power of the former .
__label__0	This was not his first tiger , and advancing to within ten feet of the animal he remained motionless , his gun to his shoulder , without moving a muscle .
__label__1	<NAME> ’ t tell me so if she has not. ’ ‘ She has , ’ cried <NAME> .
__label__0	The explorer next visited <NAME> , a harbour little used , as it is too much exposed to the west winds ; and thence he proceeded to the country of the <NAME> , or , as <NAME> 's map calls them , the <NAME> .
__label__1	I am too well aware that when , in the inscrutable decrees of <NAME> , you were reserved for me , it is possible you may have been reserved for one , destined , after a protracted struggle , at length to fall a victim to pecuniary involvements of a complicated nature .
__label__1	‘ I know another case , ’ said the little old man , when his chuckles had in some degree subsided .
__label__1	And you think that at no time of your father ’ s life was my name of <NAME> ever familiar to him ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , sir. ’ He felt , from the tone in which she spoke , that she was glancing up at him with those parted lips ; therefore he looked before him , rather than make her heart beat quicker still by embarrassing her afresh .
__label__1	But she asked him , in a rapid , urgent manner , to let her stay -- to let her feel assured ( I heard her murmur some broken words to this effect ) that she was in his confidence that night .
__label__1	This person , '' the other bearer , `` we engaged in the street outside for a pint of beer .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ I dare say you have been annoyed in the <NAME> ; there are some odd gentry there .
__label__1	‘ They keep ‘ em locked up there till they want ‘ em , ’ resumed the little man .
__label__0	A little before eleven o ’ clock , <NAME> and the reporter , rifle in hand , were behind the gate , ready to open it at the first bark of their dog .
__label__1	It came upon me as the close of the benignant history I had been pursuing , and I felt that I had but one thing to do .
__label__0	They rose like an amphitheater on natural terraces ; their waters gradually flowed together under folds of white smoke , and corroding the edges of the semi-transparent steps of this gigantic staircase .
__label__1	I will not lose sight of him again , in a hurry. ’ With these words , <NAME> shook <NAME> ’ s hand once more , and , having done the same by <NAME> , threw himself into an arm-chair , his jolly red face shining again with smiles and health .
__label__1	As often as I raised my eyes from what I was about , I met hers .
__label__1	Do you suppose I haven ’ t often thought that things might go on irregular and untidy here , after I was taken away ?
__label__0	At any rate , for humanity ’ s sake alone , it would be right to wait .
__label__1	I have undertaken then to let you know that—in short , that <NAME> has informed me that he has long watched your progress with particular interest and pleasure , and has long hoped that the time might ultimately arrive when he should offer you his hand in marriage .
__label__0	<NAME> , as we have seen , had traced the course of that river past the valley of <NAME> , to <NAME> , near <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> over , we get into another vehicle which is ready at the door ( for the coach has been changed in the interval ) , and resume our journey ; which continues through the same kind of country until evening , when we come to the town where we are to stop for tea and supper ; and having delivered the mail bags at the Post-office , ride through the usual wide street , lined with the usual stores and houses ( the drapers always having hung up at their door , by way of sign , a piece of bright red cloth ) , to the hotel where this meal is prepared .
__label__0	There commenced a series of misfortunes for <NAME> ; in a few months she lost some of her children .
__label__1	I ha ’ gone t ’ th ’ brigg , minded to fling myseln ower , and ha ’ no more on ’ t .
__label__0	They disdainfully rejected all that we offered , even iron , looking-glasses , handkerchiefs , and pieces of cloth .
__label__0	on the sum that might be recovered .
__label__0	`` Do you know , my dear <NAME> , '' said <NAME> , `` that the explanation you gave yesterday on the subject of the bottle has not satisfied me at all !
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , wakken oop , will ‘ ee ? ’ After several burrowings into the old corner , and many exclamations of impatience and fatigue , the figure struggled into a sitting posture ; and there , under a mass of crumpled beaver , and surrounded by a semicircle of blue curl-papers , were the delicate features of <NAME> .
__label__1	These , it seemed , were calculations of compound interest on what he called ‘ the principal amount of forty-one , ten , eleven and a half ’ , for various periods .
__label__0	On the way <NAME> had discovered a tree , the branches of which the Indians of <NAME> employ for making their bows .
__label__1	The shopkeepers of the town , although they had a very indistinct notion of the nature of the offence , could not but be much edified and gratified by this spectacle .
__label__1	When he comes back , he has recovered his composure , except that he contends against an avoidance of the boy , which is so very remarkable that it absorbs the woman 's attention .
__label__1	The last time I was in the <NAME> , a civil able-bodied person in a white apron pounced out upon me from a doorway , and whispering the word ‘ Marriage-licence ’ in my ear , was with great difficulty prevented from taking me up in his arms and lifting me into a proctor ’ s .
__label__0	<NAME> of <NAME> visited that part of <NAME> in <NAME> which is watered by the <NAME> and <NAME> , and saw the ruined city of <NAME> , passing by what is said to be the furnace into which <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> were thrown , and the tower of <NAME> , which he describes as follows .
__label__0	He was said to be of <NAME> descent , but no trace of it was observable in his name , his character , or his appearance .
__label__1	Guster is minding the shop , for the 'prentices take tea in the kitchen with <NAME> and Mrs. Snagsby ; consequently , the robe-maker 's two daughters , combing their curls at the two glasses in the two second-floor windows of the opposite house , are not driving the two 'prentices to distraction as they fondly suppose , but are merely awakening the unprofitable admiration of <NAME> , whose hair wo n't grow , and never would , and it is confidently thought , never will .
__label__1	And your sister <NAME> has a fine brave spirit of another kind , a spirit of pure devotion , a beau-ti-ful spirit !
__label__1	If I hadn ’ t been upon my guard , I am convinced she would have had my blood. ’ ‘ I think the better of her for it , ’ said I , indignantly .
__label__0	They had scarcely rejoined <NAME> and <NAME> , before the islet was overrun with pirates in every direction .
__label__1	It was like sitting in a vault strewn with dead bodies -- the cap , the noose , the pinioned arms , the faces that he knew , even beneath that hideous veil. -- <NAME> , light !
__label__1	He was smoother and more polite to me than the elder ; but I saw this .
__label__1	To go on -- ” “ But this is my father 's story , sir ; and I begin to think ” -- the curiously roughened forehead was very intent upon him -- “ that when I was left an orphan through my mother 's surviving my father only two years , it was you who brought me to <NAME> .
__label__1	It ’ s the most singular circumstance I ever knew. ’ Undoubtedly it was singular , that if <NAME> did feel a strong interest in <NAME> , it should not rather have been the interest of a maiden aunt or grandmother ; that being the conclusion to which the difference in their respective ages would have naturally tended .
__label__1	But she had scarcely entered , when another woman , similarly laden , came in too ; and she was closely followed by a man in faded black , who was no less startled by the sight of them , than they had been upon the recognition of each other .
__label__1	“ I think it probable , ” said the <NAME> , breaking silence with an effort , “ that the relapse you have described , my dear friend , was not quite unforeseen by its subject. ” “ Was it dreaded by him ? ” <NAME> ventured to ask .
__label__0	`` My morning 's game , '' answered the doctor , modestly , `` and you 'll see no fox was ever wanted more than this one . ''
__label__1	He has been doing so ever since it fell dark .
__label__1	I know not where to go .
__label__0	“ <NAME> , then , has some internal heat , ” said <NAME> .
__label__0	The landlord of the “ <NAME> , ” as it was called , was a coarse man with an ill-tempered face , who must have considered himself his principal customer for the gin , brandy and whisky he had to sell .
__label__0	These mutual compliments were interrupted by the arrival of the seven horses , saddled and ready .
__label__1	No man thinks of walking in this desolate place , or of turning it to any account .
__label__1	I say , he struck me .
__label__1	‘ I have sent him a letter that I ’ ll trouble him to attend to , or he and I will fall out , I can tell him ! ’ ‘ Does he know where I am , aunt ? ’ I inquired , alarmed .
__label__1	He cast himself on the grass by the <NAME> side , in an indolent way , with his back in that direction , and , having gathered a few blades , fell to chewing them .
__label__0	`` It is incomprehensible that we have not come in sight of them , '' said the captain .
__label__0	They saw few or no churches , but the prophet 's mansion , the court-house , and the arsenal , blue-brick houses with verandas and porches , surrounded by gardens bordered with acacias , palms , and locusts .
__label__1	Since then , I have taken heart to write a good many trifling pieces .
__label__0	[ Illustration : Captain <NAME> 's chart of <NAME> . ]
__label__1	I ’ d drop him in the water-butt , and put the lid on ; and if I found he was insensible to kindness , I ’ d try the other persvasion. ’ The elder <NAME> bestowed a look of deep , unspeakable admiration on his son , and , having once more grasped his hand , walked slowly away , revolving in his mind the numerous reflections to which his advice had given rise .
__label__0	That coffer yonder contains diamonds of the value of many millions , most of them mementoes of the time when , husband and father , I thought happiness possible for me , and a collection of pearls gathered by my friends and myself in the depths of the ocean .
__label__1	To many a single combat with <NAME> , did <NAME> gallantly devote herself , and if ever Mrs Pipchin in all her life had found her match , she had found it now .
__label__1	‘ Poor little thing , ’ said <NAME> ; ‘ she has been dreaming , I daresay. ’ Dreaming , perhaps , of loving tones for ever silent , of loving eyes for ever closed , of loving arms again wound round her , and relaxing in that dream within the dam which no tongue can relate .
__label__0	Once arrived in that country , circumstances must determine his future course .
__label__0	End of the <NAME> EBook of <NAME> , by <NAME>
__label__1	The poor child clings to her for awhile , as she clings to him , and then , when the old man calls , he says “ I must go !
__label__1	Here ’ s your health , sir. ’ ‘ Hold hard there , ’ interposed the mottled-faced gentleman , with sudden energy ; ‘ your eyes on me , gen ’ l ’ m ’ n ! ’ Saying this , the mottled-faced gentleman rose , as did the other gentlemen .
__label__1	Similarly , when I am reminded by any chance of what it was that the waves were always saying , my remembrance wanders for a whole winter night about the streets of <NAME> -- as I restlessly did with a little friend and I parted company .
__label__0	There was a great abundance of this plant growing in the district , and <NAME> gathered a large supply , so that they were sure of food for several days .
__label__1	I saw that a crisis was at hand , and it came .
__label__1	Can I in no way repay your confidence ?
__label__0	But what would have been the condition of the colonists if his state had been aggravated , -- if , for example , the ball had remained in his body , if his arm or his leg had had to be amputated ?
__label__1	Six of those last-named little promissory notes , all due on the same day , <NAME> , and all intrusted to me ! ’ ‘ It ’ s very gratifying , isn ’ t it ? ’ said <NAME> , holding his plate for some more minced veal .
__label__1	`` Why have you told my story to so many persons ? ''
__label__1	‘ Morning , morning , morning ! ’ said Mr Boffin , with a wave of his hand , as the office door was opened by the dismal boy , whose appropriate name was <NAME> .
__label__0	murmured the engineer , leaping first up the ladder .
__label__0	`` Their food is chiefly shell-fish .
__label__1	Her worthy lord stretched his neck and eyes until she had crossed the yard , and then , not at all sorry to have had this opportunity of carrying his point , and asserting the sanctity of his castle , fell into an immoderate fit of laughter , and laid himself down to sleep again .
__label__1	and then they can take it out and give it to him , and then all be happy ! ’ The interruption was seasonable , for the bell had nearly rung itself out .
__label__0	According to the latest news obtained by the <NAME> ’ s courier , <NAME> could not be yet in the hands of the invaders .
__label__1	‘ I doubt , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ if he can be here till next day. ’ ‘ Then I will come next night too , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	Before turning to retrace his steps , he stopped upon the margin , to look down at the reflected night .
__label__0	The work had begun immediately and carried on with indefatigable energy .
__label__1	The hearty old landlord was trying to look very cheerful and unconcerned , but failing signally in the attempt .
__label__0	My office would be no longer a sinecure , and the council would be obliged to double my salary -- unless it should arrest me myself , for disturbing the public peace ! ''
__label__1	It won ’ t answer to have <NAME> about , while this business of ours is about .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> wiped from his forehead the perspiration which his walk had engendered , glanced complacently at the cocked hat , and smiled .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> was now so poor that he could not even hire a boat ; he was forced to rely upon public charity .
__label__1	As the knocking , however , instead of accommodating itself to his lazy state , increased in vigour and became more importunate , as if in earnest remonstrance against his falling asleep again , now that he had once opened his eyes , <NAME> began by degrees to comprehend the possibility of there being somebody at the door ; and thus he gradually came to recollect that it was Friday morning , and he had ordered <NAME> to be in waiting upon him at an early hour .
__label__1	Look how you considers of us , and writes of us , and talks of us , and goes up wi ’ yor deputations to Secretaries o ’ State ’ bout us , and how yo are awlus right , and how we are awlus wrong , and never had ’ n no reason in us sin ever we were born .
__label__1	<NAME> , without being quite enthusiastic on the subject , replied that he was glad of any opportunity , however slight , to oblige Mr Carker , whose wish on such a point was a command : and that the wooden Midshipman would consider himself happy to receive in his berth any visitor of Mr <NAME> ’ s selecting .
__label__0	Well , at the rate of two hundred and forty miles every twelve hours , which does not come near the rapidity of our railroad trains , by travelling day and night , it would take only seven days to cross <NAME> ! ” “ But then you could see nothing , make no geographical observations , or reconnoitre the face of the country. ” “ Ah ! ” replied the doctor , “ if I am master of my balloon -- if I can ascend and descend at will , I shall stop when I please , especially when too violent currents of air threaten to carry me out of my way with them. ” “ And you will encounter such , ” said <NAME> .
__label__1	That ’ s what your daughter wants .
__label__1	‘ They are so beautiful ! ’ said Mrs. <NAME> , sobbing .
__label__1	But I do not believe this .
__label__1	It may be that he became a little smarter in his dress after that memorable occasion ; and he certainly liked in his leisure time to walk towards that quarter of the town where Mr <NAME> ’ s house was situated , on the vague chance of passing little Florence in the street .
__label__1	' I 've got to be in <NAME> to-night ; and I know a 'spectable old gentleman as lives there , wot 'll give you lodgings for nothink , and never ask for the change -- that is , if any genelman he knows interduces you .
__label__0	“ <NAME> , one would have thought that <NAME> and <NAME> had given the word to fire together ! ” “ Gentlemen , ” said <NAME> , as he reloaded his gun , “ this is becoming more serious .
__label__0	That day was exceptionally calm and the crew was able to get some rest ; numerous birds were swimming and flying about the ship ; among others , the doctor noticed some wild birds which were very like teal , with black neck , wings , and back , and a white breast ; they were continually diving , and often remained more than forty seconds under water .
__label__1	And that it was a highly agreeable boast to both of us , and that we must both be very proud of it , was a conclusion quite established in his own mind .
__label__1	<NAME> , ’ said the elder lady , ’ this is not a fit conversation for the servants to overhear .
__label__0	Would it not , before we proceed to set up winter quarters for seven or eight months , be better to leave the iceberg altogether , if such a thing were possible ?
__label__1	Why , good people , when he comes smoothly spinning through the <NAME> to-night , like a slow-going benevolent Humming-Top , and when you come about him with your complaints of the Grubber , you don ’ t know what a cheat the Proprietor is !
__label__0	<NAME> , then aged seventy , was a man of great worth , full of evangelical fervor , charitable and good , and in countries where the representatives of religion are not always examples of the virtues , he stood out as the accomplished type of those great missionaries who have done so much for civilization in the interior of the most savage regions of the world .
__label__0	Were not <NAME> and <NAME> both incorporated into the <NAME> in 1845 ? ''
__label__0	There was a well-organized police , and a system of relays which worked with perfect regularity , and enabled the sovereign to transmit his orders with rapidity from one end of the empire to the other .
__label__1	Remember how poor we are. ’ Mrs. <NAME> shook her head , and said , through her tears , that poverty was not a crime .
__label__1	inquired the man with the keys .
__label__1	‘ How could you go away so long , without saying a word to me or letting me hear of you or know anything about you ? ’ asked the poor little woman , sobbing .
__label__1	‘ You have had no former cause of complaint on the sentimental score , <NAME> , and you will have none in future .
__label__1	The newspaper-reading turnkey has told them all .
__label__1	For a man so expert in most things of that kind , <NAME> takes time to open the door and makes some noise too .
__label__0	`` It is , then , the bread-tree ? ''
__label__1	He was disconcerted and walked to the window ; I almost believed with an intention of jumping out , until he turned and I was reassured by seeing in his eyes what he had gone there to hide .
__label__0	The captain afterwards visited <NAME> , where the natives gave him the most appreciative welcome .
__label__0	Suddenly <NAME> , taking a spring , left the floor and remained suspended in the air , like <NAME> 's monk of the <NAME> des Anges_ .
__label__1	Therefore I had wanted to be alone , and therefore I said , now alone , in my own room , `` Esther , if you are to be happy , if you are to have any right to pray to be true-hearted , you must keep your word , my dear . ''
__label__0	But at least there remained Mrs. Scorbitt !
__label__0	An old <NAME> prayer-book was lying on the corner of the tomb ; the volume was open , and the page exposed to view was that which contained the office for the celebration of the 25th of August .
__label__1	Besides you -- you ’ re disappointed , <NAME> , and , not knowing what you say , expose yourself. ’ ‘ Yes , you pitiful dastard , ’ retorted the lovely damsel , ‘ I understand you .
__label__1	All the love and duty I could ever have rendered to him is transferred to you . ''
__label__1	“ ‘ I may as well see one real chair , as two or three complete sets of false ones , ” said <NAME> , bringing out his head from under the bedclothes .
__label__0	But , sit down , my dear Dick. ” “ No , I won ’ t sit down ! -- Then , you really intend to attempt this journey ? ” “ Most certainly !
__label__1	This is to be hushed up if it can be .
__label__1	He was so lavish of this condescension , that he not only bowed to her , in a particular manner , on several occasions , but even entrusted such stately recognitions of her to his sister as ‘ pray tell your friend , <NAME> , that she is very good , ’ or ‘ mention to <NAME> , <NAME> , that I am obliged to her ; ’ specialities which made a deep impression on the lady thus distinguished .
__label__1	Like his impudence ! ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	Her bosom was heaving in a distressful manner that I greatly pitied , but I thought it better not to speak .
__label__0	Besides , for many months the <NAME> had been attracting the public attention ; the singularity of its build , the mystery which enshrouded it , the incognito maintained by the captain , the manner in which <NAME> received the proposition of superintending its outfit , the careful selection of the crew , its unknown destination , scarcely conjectured by any , -- all combined to give this brig a reputation of something more than strangeness .
__label__1	If great criminals told the truth -- which , being great criminals , they do not -- they would very rarely tell of their struggles against the crime .
__label__1	The old woman then produced some wretched substitutes from the bottom of the heap of rags , which she turned up for that purpose ; together with a girl ’ s cloak , quite worn out and very old ; and the crushed remains of a bonnet that had probably been picked up from some ditch or dunghill .
__label__1	<NAME> firm , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , looking down .
__label__1	Will you oblige me by giving it the calmest and coolest perusal , and by discussing the subject afterwards with me , in the tone and spirit in which alone it ought to be discussed ?
__label__1	By Heaven I will , if I hang on to the foot-board. ’ ‘ You shall be horsewhipped if you do , ’ returned <NAME> .
__label__1	There was an innocent piece of dinner-furniture that went upon easy castors and was kept over a livery stable-yard in <NAME> , <NAME> ’ s , when not in use , to whom the <NAME> were a source of blind confusion .
__label__0	Their trunks at the base measured twenty feet in circumference , and their bark was covered by a network of furrows containing a red , sweet-smelling gum .
__label__1	The tall man was standing in the snug little bar , with his hands behind him , quite at home .
__label__1	Nor hurt ? ’ she asked him , anxiously .
__label__1	‘ Come , sir , ’ she said , with a cruel pleasure in repeating the stab , ‘ I will be as open with you as you can desire .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> ’ t tell me you did .
__label__0	The sides were everywhere entire ; but points of rock jutted out here and there , and by means of these points it would have been quite possible for an active creature to climb to the mouth of the well .
__label__1	The light about the head is shining on me as I go ! ’ The golden ripple on the wall came back again , and nothing else stirred in the room .
__label__0	His object now was to raise within the center of the well , and with a coincident axis , a cylinder 900 feet high , and nine feet in diameter , which should exactly fill up the space reserved for the bore of the <NAME> .
__label__0	Do you still doubt his honesty ? ''
__label__1	Dances and marches are performed alternately , to the enlivening strains of a piano ; and now and then some gentleman or lady ( whose proficiency has been previously ascertained ) obliges the company with a song : nor does it ever degenerate , at a tender crisis , into a screech or howl ; wherein , I must confess , I should have thought the danger lay .
__label__1	The way was purposely confused , no doubt .
__label__0	The horse is about the same , as well as the hare , the elephant , the porpoise , the tiger ; but the cat , the squirrel , the rat , panther , sheep , ox , dog , monkey , goat , reach 103° ; and the warmest of all , the pig , goes above `` That is humiliating for us , '' said <NAME> .

__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> had hooked him in the coat collar with the handle of his umbrella , and was hanging on at the other end with all his might and main .
__label__0	`` I know , I guess , what this pretended meteor is !
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> , the mate , the boatswain , <NAME> , and <NAME> , whom I accompanied , went up again towards the schooner in order to make a minute investigation of the hull .
__label__0	`` Friends , '' he said , `` it is now twenty minutes past ten .
__label__1	‘ Take off your cap , child , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ and let me see you. ’ My mother was too much afraid of her to refuse compliance with this odd request , if she had any disposition to do so .
__label__1	People couldn ’ t ask one to wedding breakfasts .
__label__1	Holding my mind as steadily as I could to these points , I went into the next room with them .
__label__1	Its effect was precisely what a more experienced observer would have foreseen .
__label__1	As she glanced down into the yard , she saw <NAME> come in and leer up with the corner of his eye as he went by .
__label__0	With his strong hand he bent me to the ground , his companion doing the same to <NAME> .
__label__1	Then he too stood , with his doubled hand upon the table near it , waiting to be addressed .
__label__1	His desire to impart something that was on his mind , his unspeakable yearning to have speech with his friend and make a communication to him , so troubled him when he recovered consciousness , that its term was thereby shortened .
__label__1	But , thinking that the Jew , being so much his senior , must know best , he followed him quietly to the table , and was soon deeply involved in his new study .
__label__1	As fate would have it , Mrs. <NAME> chanced to bring in , at this moment , a small parcel of books , which <NAME> had that morning purchased of the identical bookstall-keeper , who has already figured in this history ; having laid them on the table , she prepared to leave the room .
__label__0	it shan ’ t be said that a <NAME> officer can not cope with a piece of poetry .
__label__1	Altogether I was lost in amazement , and sat staring at her , quite oblivious , I am afraid , of the laws of politeness .
__label__1	<NAME> , indeed ! ’ cried <NAME> , bridling up .
__label__1	Good-bye , <NAME> ! ’ and with a kiss for each Miss <NAME> turned to the door .
__label__1	`` But in that he was influenced by passion , not by reason .
__label__1	Not long before , I had read in the newspapers , how a gentleman unknown had come to the <NAME> in the night , and had gone to bed , and had destroyed himself , and had been found in the morning weltering in blood .
__label__0	As they pronounced these words with a menacing air , the two notables , with folded arms and bristling air , confronted <NAME> , ready to do him some violence , if by a gesture , or even the expression of his eye , he manifested any intention of contradicting them .
__label__1	But , as years went on , my dear boy would have wearied of his child-wife .
__label__0	They built a church in two centuries , a painter painted but few pictures in the course of his life , a poet only composed one great work ; but these were so many masterpieces for after-ages to appreciate .
__label__1	What can I do to save him , sir ? '
__label__1	I then proceeded to the object of my visit .
__label__1	We received the news of their safe arrival , and perhaps another letter , or perhaps two ; but , since then , they have gradually taken their road in life -- we , ours -- and we have held no correspondence. ” “ Perfectly so , madame , ” replied the spy .
__label__0	Her energy was evidently both prompt and persistent , and her calmness unalterable , even under circumstances in which a man would be likely to give way or lose his self-command .
__label__1	and gave my little basket of housekeeping keys such a shake that they sounded like little bells and rang me hopefully to bed .
__label__0	`` Before beginning the work , let us examine the hull and see what the damage is , and whether it can be repaired .
__label__0	`` Without doubt ; but do n't be proud of it , '' answered the doctor with a laugh .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> grows jealous , and the middle-aged Lady apprehensive , which brings the Pickwickians within the Grasp of the Law 25 .
__label__0	Moreover , it was unnecessary to manufacture rigging , that of the “ Speedy ” having been saved entire , so that the hull only of the vessel needed to be constructed .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> gracious , <NAME> , what is the matter , what have you been doing ? ’ cried <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ How could you presume to come here on such an errand , you scoundrel ? ’ ‘ <NAME> !
__label__0	During the struggle , at the first blow I struck Torres in his chest , my manchetta was stopped by some hard substance under his poncho , like a plate of metal -- -- ” “ That was the case ! ” said <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> , who had been engaged in a manner in which every reader may imagine for himself or herself , was hurrying downstairs in obedience to his angry summons , when he encountered a new surprise .
__label__1	‘ Who ’ s that ? ’ cried a stout old man , who was putting on a nightcap as if he were going to bed in a vault .
__label__0	“ She is very pretty , ” said <NAME> .
__label__0	For the <NAME> , _Director of the Observatory of Cambridge._ An observer endued with an infinite range of vision , and placed in that unknown center around which the entire world revolves , might have beheld myriads of atoms filling all space during the chaotic epoch of the universe .
__label__0	The rest , amounting to 120 , men who were left to guard the fort of <NAME> , after many vicissitudes which can not be related here , perished by the hands of the <NAME> , or were obliged to take refuge in the <NAME> settlements on the coast of <NAME> .
__label__0	But , if she could neither glide off nor move , she ran the risk of being for ever fastened to these rocks , and then <NAME> 's submarine vessel would be done for .
__label__1	`` And it is a remarkable example of the confusion into which the present age has fallen ; of the obliteration of landmarks , the opening of floodgates , and the uprooting of distinctions , '' says <NAME> with stately gloom , `` that I have been informed by <NAME> that Mrs. Rouncewell 's son has been invited to go into <NAME> . ''
__label__0	In 1636 and 1637 <NAME> with forty-seven canoes , and a large number of <NAME> and <NAME> , followed the <NAME> as far as the junction of its tributary the <NAME> , and then ascended , first it , and afterwards the <NAME> , to within thirty miles of <NAME> , which he reached with a few men .
__label__1	Were they not ? ’ ‘ When she told you you would be a judge ?
__label__1	‘ Ah , my beloved Lizzie ! ’ he said , faintly .
__label__1	The amiable face with which he said it , I think I shall never forget .
__label__0	To work , <NAME> , to work , and let us not lose an hour ! ” During eight days more , that is to say until the 7th of February , the lava continued to flow , but the eruption was confined within the previous limits .
__label__0	“ Because , I tell you , the mass of <NAME> is so inferior to that of the moon , that <NAME> would become the moon ’ s satellite ; the moon could not possibly become hers. ” “ Assuming , however , ” continued <NAME> , “ such to be the case -- ” “ I am afraid , ” said the lieutenant , interrupting him , “ that I can not assume anything of the sort even for a moment. ” <NAME> smiled good-humoredly .
__label__1	what is to be done ! ’ It naturally occurred to him on very little reflection , that the first step to take would be to communicate with one of the Mr Garlands instantly .
__label__0	<NAME> shouldered his gun and fired ; a sailor dropped into the bottom of the boat .
__label__0	of the spot where the Nile , after flowing through the lake with an ever perceptible current , bends towards <NAME> in the <NAME> territory .
__label__0	This unbroken level discouraged the beholder , and gave him that kind of malady called the “ desert-sickness. ” The impassible monotony of the arid blue sky , and the vast yellow expanse of the desert-sand , at length produced a sensation of terror .
__label__1	‘ I am sorry I have troubled you unnecessarily , sir , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	`` I say that , at the time I threw myself into the sea , I heard the men at the wheel say , ` The screw and the rudder are broken . '
__label__1	But the duties and responsibilities make the recompense small , and they are so very heavy that I fear to undertake them. ’ ‘ Do you decline to undertake them , sir ? ’ inquired <NAME> , with his hand on the bell-rope .
__label__1	‘ My dear Copperfield , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ I have already done so , because I begin to feel that I have not only been inconsiderate , but that I have been positively unjust to <NAME> .
__label__1	In the distance one way , <NAME> showed as a black mist ; in another distance hills began to rise ; in a third , there was a faint change in the light of the horizon where it shone upon the far-off sea .
__label__1	and goes on with the <NAME> letters . ''
__label__1	Bless you , father , not he ! ’ This was intended for Mr Toodle ’ s private edification , but Rob the <NAME> , whose withers were not unwrung , caught the words as they were spoken .
__label__1	The pastry-cook is hard at work in the funereal room in <NAME> , and the very tall young men are busy looking on .
__label__1	Can you tell me , this last time , that you feel quite , quite sure , no new affections of mine , and no new duties of mine , will ever interpose between us ?
__label__1	Probably much more ! ” ’ I whispered a few words to <NAME> , who was weeping , half joyfully , half sorrowfully , at my side ; and there was a movement among us , as if <NAME> had finished .
__label__1	‘ Was that half-past twelve , <NAME> ? ’ said <NAME> , in a sharp and grating voice .
__label__1	I examined the place , and the body , and the papers , and everything .
__label__1	What queer bills are to be bought , and at what prices ?
__label__1	The house is a ruin , and the rats fly from it .
__label__1	'Well , and what if he did , you little ungrateful wretch ? '
__label__1	`` You said on that occasion , '' I recommenced , `` that you might possibly have the means of advancing my interests and promoting my fortunes by making discoveries of which I should be the subject .
__label__1	Says the beadle , no , sir , he is not here .
__label__1	‘ Only a gentleman and his wife , Miss. ’ ‘ And who are they ?
__label__1	I should have liked to know her .
__label__1	“ Not in season ! ” says I .
__label__1	The anxiety of his mind , and the numerous meditations which <NAME> had awakened , prevented his share of the mortar of punch producing that effect upon him which it would have had under other circumstances .
__label__0	By degrees and with the course of years the knowledge of these rich countries had increased .
__label__1	There an ’ t better land in the country than this perwerse lad grazed on , and yet he goes and catches cold and indigestion and what not , and then his friends brings a lawsuit against ME !
__label__1	She sat at the window , when the sun began to sink behind the smoke ; she sat there , when the smoke was burning red , when the colour faded from it , when darkness seemed to rise slowly out of the ground , and creep upward , upward , up to the house-tops , up the church steeple , up to the summits of the factory chimneys , up to the sky .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> then once again dropped off to sleep , with a confused consciousness that <NAME> was still engaged in relating a long story , the chief point of which appeared to be that , on some occasion particularly stated and set forth , he had ‘ done ’ a bill and a gentleman at the same time .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> , not much doubting who the young man was , unlocked the door ; which he had no sooner done than <NAME> entered with great precipitation , and carefully relocking it on the inside , deliberately put the key in his waistcoat pocket ; and , after surveying <NAME> from head to foot , said -- ‘ You ’ re a wery humorous young gen ’ l ’ m ’ n , you air , <NAME> ! ’ ‘ What do you mean by this conduct , <NAME> ? ’ inquired <NAME> indignantly .
__label__0	The delay at <NAME> was rendered very disagreeable by earthquakes and typhoons , which are always of constant occurrence there .
__label__1	To whom could it belong ?
__label__1	Boiled beef and greens constitute the day 's variety on the former repast of boiled pork and greens , and Mrs. Bagnet serves out the meal in the same way and seasons it with the best of temper , being that rare sort of old girl that she receives <NAME> to her arms without a hint that it might be <NAME> and catches light from any little spot of darkness near her .
__label__1	Your sex have such a surprising animosity against one another when you do differ .
__label__0	But all that , my friends , is the secret of the <NAME> of all things ; and beginning by the work of the insects , I have perhaps let myself be carried too far , in investigating the secrets of the future .
__label__0	And by this promise he bound both himself and his companions .
__label__1	The arrival of this unexpected heir soon taking wind in the court still makes good for the <NAME> and keeps the court upon its mettle .
__label__1	‘ Hey ! ’ cried the lady of the caravan , scooping the crumbs out of her lap and swallowing the same before wiping her lips .
__label__1	‘ Thank you ! ’ He certainly never had seen this old woman before .
__label__1	You or I to finish ? ’ ‘ I ! ’ she answered , with increased determination , if it were possible .
__label__0	There was every reason to hope they might camp that same night on the banks of the <NAME> , an important river which throws itself into the <NAME> , south of <NAME> .
__label__1	And directed by my own hand , Number nine <NAME> Place ! ’ exclaimed old Sol .
__label__0	`` Your cool , clear head has not yet quite recovered from the shock , my dear <NAME> ; '' replied <NAME> , with a smile .
__label__0	Moreover , the vicinity of the <NAME> , and the prevailing west wind , made the climate of this district particularly damp .
__label__1	The waking traveller , therefore , stole a little nearer , and yet a little nearer , and a little nearer to the sleeping traveller ’ s bed , until he stood close beside it .
__label__1	‘ Containing a position which I deny , ’ interrupted he of the dirty countenance .
__label__0	`` The point , '' says the traveller , `` from which the <NAME> issues , was now shown to me , and appeared to be at the same level on which I stood , viz. , 1600 feet above the level of the <NAME> ; the source of the <NAME> , which I had already measured , being 1470 feet .
__label__1	It was this , I conceive , which led to the <NAME> 's being advised by the gallery to “ turn over ! ” -- a recommendation which it took extremely ill .
__label__1	Would you begin without my uncle ? ’ ‘ I forgot the collector , ’ said <NAME> ; ‘ oh no , that would never do. ’ ‘ He ’ s so particular , ’ said Mrs. <NAME> , turning to the other married lady , ‘ that if we began without him , I should be out of his will for ever. ’ ‘ Dear ! ’ cried the married lady .
__label__1	He finished reading it there , with his back towards me , and after he had finished and had folded it up , stood there for some minutes with the letter in his hand .
__label__1	And as to giving of you up , or reporting where you are , yes verily , and by <NAME> ’ s help , so I won ’ t , <NAME> catechism , make a note on ! ’ This the <NAME> said , reference and all , in one breath , and with much solemnity ; taking off his hat at ‘ yes verily , ’ and putting it on again , when he had quite concluded .
__label__1	You yourself , ’ said Mr Meagles , persuasively , as if the provocation to be angry were not his own at all , ‘ want to give the poor passionate girl another chance , I know , Clennam. ’ ‘ It would be strange and hard indeed if I did not , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ when you are all so forgiving .
__label__1	The <NAME> , <NAME> , and Mr Toots are come ; the clergyman is putting on his surplice in the vestry , while the clerk walks round him , blowing the dust off it ; and the bride and bridegroom stand before the altar .
__label__1	<NAME> to see you look , and hear you speak , as you did on that night when we parted , is happiness to me that there are no words to utter ; and to be loved and trusted as your brother , is the next gift I could receive and prize ! ’ ‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , looking at him earnestly , but with a changing face , ‘ what is that which is due to me , and must be rendered to me , at the sacrifice of all this ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , in a low tone .
__label__1	I never was responsible in my life -- I ca n't be . ''
__label__1	Pieces too ; why , you could write us a piece to bring out the whole strength of the company , whenever we wanted one. ’ ‘ I am not quite so confident about that , ’ replied <NAME> .
__label__1	The man could not be more particular as to the time at which he saw her ( he got into dense confusion when he tried to be ) , than that it must have been before nine .
__label__0	He had taken thirty days to cross <NAME> , the <NAME> , the <NAME> , and the <NAME> plains , giving the <NAME> ample time to double <NAME> , and arrive on the opposite side .
__label__0	[ Illustration ] After they had followed these footprints for a short time , the doctor said , -- `` Well , that is clear enough . ''
__label__0	He was an old man of <NAME> race , with a long white beard , and he looked sullen and angry .
__label__0	`` I have remarked that pyramidal peak myself , '' replied <NAME> ; `` but I can assure you that so far it has received no name as yet , although it is likely enough to have been distinguished by the terrestrial astronomers .
__label__1	‘ Dis-gusting ! ’ ejaculated both the young ladies .
__label__1	At <NAME> ’ s time of life it was not to be expected that she should examine herself very closely on the congruity or stability of her position in Mr <NAME> ’ s house .
__label__0	At <NAME> , as indeed elsewhere , there existed no means of transport , -- for the same reasons as at the previous villages , neither carriages nor horses were to be had .
__label__1	The villainy , however , which could first borrow money of his faithful follower , and then abbreviate his name to ‘ <NAME> , ’ was more than he could patiently bear .
__label__1	`` And this poor person came about the house three or four days , hoping to get a glimpse of you , miss -- all she wanted , she said -- but you were away .
__label__0	“ <NAME> to me , <NAME> , ” continued <NAME> ; “ it is to your interest to speak .
__label__1	`` Well , well , '' said my guardian , comforting him ; `` well , well , well , dear boy ! ''
__label__1	I was in this family before you were born .
__label__0	He felt that <NAME> ’ s arrival contradicted his conjectures .
__label__1	And keep as near me , as you can . '
__label__0	He has either remained in <NAME> , or we shall arrive at <NAME> before him , so as to cut him off ; in either case he will not reach Irkutsk. ” “ A rugged woman , that old <NAME> , who is evidently his mother , ” said the deh-baschi .
__label__1	‘ Think of soon returning to the old country , sir ! ’ repeats the Doctor .
__label__1	There was no one with <NAME> but Mr F. ’ s <NAME> , which respectable gentlewoman , basking in a balmy atmosphere of tea and toast , was ensconced in an easy-chair by the fireside , with a little table at her elbow , and a clean white handkerchief spread over her lap on which two pieces of toast at that moment awaited consumption .
__label__1	Among the wretched creatures before him whom he must single out for special address was one who almost from his infancy had been an offender against the laws ; who , after repeated imprisonments and punishments , had been at length sentenced to exile for a term of years ; and who , under circumstances of great violence and daring , had made his escape and been re-sentenced to exile for life .
__label__1	Not go as I have said ? ''
__label__0	We were turning our backs on <NAME> .
__label__0	His death had evidently occurred some months previously , probably very soon after the unfortunate man had been carried away by the drift .
__label__0	Soon recalled by the friendly signs and demonstrations of the <NAME> , they showed great surprise at their clothes , their faces , and the whiteness of their skin .
__label__1	<NAME> retired behind his elbow at first , but relented at the sight of sponge-cake and allowed me to take him on my lap , where he sat munching quietly .
__label__0	The journals of all <NAME> were untiring in their praises of the bold explorers , and the <NAME> struck off an edition of three hundred and seventy-seven thousand copies on the day when it published a sketch of the trip .
__label__1	It might be almost anything. ’ ‘ Those are the letters. ’ Mr Flintwinch , who had been observantly pausing all this time with a cup of tea in his hand , and his mouth open ready to swallow the contents , began to do so : always entirely filling his mouth before he emptied it at a gulp ; and always deliberating again before he refilled it .
__label__1	“ I think you have got the ague , ” said I .
__label__0	However , the admiral was received at court with a certain measure of favour , the narrative of his second voyage doing much to reinstate him in public opinion .
__label__0	It is the boat. ” “ The ship ’ s boat ? ” exclaimed <NAME> .
__label__1	How the last faint traces of hope , the remotest glimmering of any good to be derived from his efforts in this den , faded from the mind of <NAME> as he looked in dismay around !
__label__0	I was perfectly ignorant of the matter .
__label__0	Soldiers , armed with bows and arrows , were drawn up in line of battle ; but by this time the balloon was expanding , and rising quietly beyond their reach .
__label__0	Orders had been given to march rapidly .
__label__1	However , we must take it as it comes .
__label__0	“ But let us see where we are , ” he said .
__label__0	They heaved the log a second time .
__label__0	so be it ! ” answered <NAME> .
__label__1	But , at last , we came to the door of his cell ; and <NAME> , looking through a little hole in it , reported to us , in a state of the greatest admiration , that he was reading a <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Hollo ! ’ said <NAME> , ‘ I ought to know that ‘ ere head and them features ; the eyeglass , too , and the broad-brimmed tile !
__label__1	‘ And where did you leave <NAME> , reverend sir ? ’ <NAME> had left him at <NAME> .
__label__1	`` A job , '' says <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> ’ t say , “ Oh , <NAME> , <NAME> ! ” That ’ s childish .
__label__1	‘ Take care that other people know when to hold theirs. ’ ‘ You jade , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ if your husband has been idiot enough to trust you with his secrets , keep them ; keep them , she-devil that you are ! ’ ‘ Not so much his secrets as other people ’ s secrets , perhaps , ’ retorted the woman ; ‘ not so much his secrets as yours .
__label__1	`` Since father died , sir , I 've gone out to work .
__label__0	`` And when arrived at this dead point , what will become of us ? ''
__label__0	“ Come , ” said <NAME> , “ the blackguards have not been there yet .
__label__0	This first trip resulted in the discovery of emerald mines at <NAME> , mentioned by <NAME> authors , which had been abandoned for centuries .
__label__0	The <NAME> soldiers were almost immediately under arms .
__label__0	exclaimed <NAME> ; `` What is the meaning of it , <NAME> ? ''
__label__0	And yet in these parts , to advance is all very well , but one must also maintain his position and not run the risk of losing it .
__label__0	Some handfuls of grass , leaves , and dry moss were placed under the fagots and disposed in such a way that the air could easily circulate , and the dry wood would rapidly catch fire .
__label__1	In winter-time , the snow will linger there , long after it has melted from the busy streets and highways .
__label__1	`` You are a vixen , a vixen ! ''
__label__0	The boat returned to the brig towards evening , bringing back the visitors to the shore ; <NAME> had bought several dozen eider-duck 's eggs , which were twice as large as hen 's eggs , and of a greenish color .
__label__1	If you ever read this letter , <NAME> , I am likely to be dead .
__label__0	I often looked at the instruments hanging from the partition .
__label__1	The polite and attentive stranger would desire , say , to consult her inclinations on the subject of potatoes .
__label__1	But he could as easily have changed a clear sky by looking at it in surprise , as affect her .
__label__1	The town , which was sluggish and uninteresting enough , was something like the back of an <NAME> watering-place , out of the season .
__label__1	These were fitted into a large window until that time bare of ornament ; and when the sun shone brightly , as she had so well loved to see it , the familiar patterns were reflected in their original colours , and throwing a stream of brilliant light upon the pavement , fell warmly on the name of <NAME> .
__label__0	I must add that , during the night , the phosphorescent waters of the <NAME> rivalled the electric power of our watch-light , especially in the stormy weather that threatened us so frequently .
__label__1	Among her pre-matrimonial transactions with <NAME> ’ s father , <NAME> ’ s mother had raised money of him at a great disadvantage on a certain reversionary interest .
__label__1	I had no claim , and I finally resolved , and ever afterwards abided by the resolution , that my heart should never be sickened with the hopeless task of attempting to establish one .
__label__1	He could not lose it now , though it was but such a speck in the landscape .

__label__0	They very rarely succeed in a good show of yellow .
__label__1	‘ It ’ s a stupid name , ’ she said , shaking her curls for a moment .
__label__1	‘ What a timid little goose our Amy is !
__label__1	‘ Yes , ’ said Mr Carker , ‘ we have received it !
__label__1	He can not do so , she tells him , too plainly or too briefly .
__label__1	‘ Not very well , dear Mr Boffin ; I have fluttered myself by being -- perhaps foolishly -- uneasy and anxious .
__label__1	And the communication I have got to make is , that he has great expectations. ” <NAME> and I gasped , and looked at one another .
__label__1	This was his unvarying reply .
__label__0	Are not these acts , which we see so frequently committed by <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> navigators , a true sign of the times ?
__label__1	It is to be hoped it enjoyed itself ; for Mr Merdle ’ s own share of the repast might have been paid for with eighteenpence .
__label__1	I hope I may not be misunderstood on this subject , for it is one in which I take a strong and deep interest .
__label__0	The cavern widened here considerably , the sea forming a little lake .
__label__1	But there ’ s no need to talk ; tomorrow will soon be here. ’ ‘ And wha-at ’ s to be done tomorrow ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
__label__0	An iron will prevented me from ever yielding to any obstacle .
__label__0	Besides a sufficient stock of pure brandy , he arranged two water-tanks , each of which contained twenty-two gallons .
__label__0	<NAME> had scarcely set his foot on shore when three thousand of the inhabitants of <NAME> came forth to meet him , an honor due to the president who had signalized their country by his choice .
__label__1	Starting on equal terms , I want to put before you how you have shown your gratitude to me , for doing all I could to further your wishes with reference to my sister .
__label__0	said <NAME> , with a puzzled air .
__label__1	The store of creature comforts was not the chief part of the visitor ’ s reception .
__label__1	Shaken out of destiny ’ s dice-box into the company of a mere smuggler ; -- shut up with a poor little contraband trader , whose papers are wrong , and whom the police lay hold of besides , for placing his boat ( as a means of getting beyond the frontier ) at the disposition of other little people whose papers are wrong ; and he instinctively recognises my position , even by this light and in this place .
__label__1	I am not a traitor. ” “ He lies ! ” cried the smith .
__label__1	‘ You mean mischief , <NAME> ! ’ The old man raised his eyes inquiringly .
__label__0	Could you marry me , <NAME> ? ” “ Yes , <NAME> , I could , if you are sure that I am able to make you happy , ” answered the maiden , raising her innocent eyes to his .
__label__1	Never shall I forget the repulsive sight that met my eye when I turned round .
__label__1	His mind would run upon that spot .
__label__0	`` Now , '' thought <NAME> , `` we 've got him .
__label__1	How much are you out of pocket ?
__label__1	Accepting the <NAME> as the type of self-sufficient stupidity and conceit—a custom , perhaps , like some few other customs , more conventional than fair—then the purest jackass in <NAME> is <NAME> , <NAME> .
__label__1	There was a good fire in the room , and a breathless smell of warm black crape -- I did not know what the smell was then , but I know now .
__label__1	Meanwhile <NAME> and <NAME> walk to and fro , quietly talking together .
__label__1	By degrees , the shutters were opened ; the window-blinds were drawn up ; and people began passing to and fro .
__label__1	If my heart were pure and all untried , and you its idol , could you ask more ; could you have more ? ’ ‘ <NAME> not , <NAME> , ’ he returned coolly .
__label__0	All the cone trembled as if it was about to plunge into a fathomless gulf .
__label__0	The ships quitted this inhospitable town , on the 29th of March , and the voyage continued , a close surveillance being kept over the <NAME> pilots , whom <NAME> was obliged to cause to be flogged .
__label__1	<NAME> has pulled down his spectacles from his forehead , and walked out to the door .
__label__0	Not having been able to leave the town before the first operations of the siege , he found himself shut up , to his great disgust ; but , not accustomed to succumb to difficulties , he resolved to escape by some means or other .
__label__1	She caught the hand which <NAME> instinctively placed in hers , and , blowing out the light , drew him after her up the stairs .
__label__0	<NAME> can not be far off .
__label__0	When this occurred we saw the sea foaming along the sides of the ice packs , covering them with spray like the rocks on the coast of a floating island , but without hindering their onward march .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> had paid the first appointed portion of the debt to Mr Dombey , and was hopeful of working his way through the rest ; and to cast him down afresh , when he had sprung up so manfully from his troubles , was a very distressing necessity .
__label__0	`` But this statement is not mathematically correct , because the equinox does not necessarily begin at noon . ''
__label__1	‘ No , my son , ’ he resumed , with a snap of his fingers .
__label__0	It was at this time that a rich merchant of <NAME> , <NAME> , in concert with a skilful mariner , named <NAME> , conceived a project for reaching the Indies by a new route .
__label__0	The main question before the navigators of the fifteenth century was the opening up of an easier communication with the shores of <NAME> .
__label__0	The dog , excited by his master ’ s words , ran towards the extremity of the cavern , and there redoubled his barking .
__label__0	The next morning at four o'clock I was awakened by the steward whom <NAME> had placed at my service .
__label__1	‘ What can <NAME> think when he hears you ? ’ ‘ Oh !
__label__0	The spot where the projectile sank under the waves was exactly known ; but the machinery to grasp it and bring it to the surface of the ocean was still wanting .
__label__0	`` Yes , '' said <NAME> , `` there is still a great deal that <NAME> ca n't even attempt . ''
__label__1	‘ Thank you , ma ’ am , ’ said <NAME> , knuckling his forehead again , in return for the favour of Mrs. Sparsit ’ s improving conversation .
__label__1	“ And , ” he says , “ when your fellow-men is up , be it their lives or be it their watches , sharp is ever the word with you .
__label__1	Besides her consideration money , her daily contract included meals .
__label__0	This fatal region was only a desert , unfrequented even by animals .
__label__1	'Why , the gentleman 's got him , ' replied the officer .
__label__1	The iron country farther north is , I suppose , the congenial direction for a boy with these tendencies . ''
__label__0	Above all , near the leaden granitic sky , were immense birds , more powerful than the cassowary and the ostrich , which spread their mighty wings and fluttered against the huge stone vault of the inland sea .
__label__1	And it takes away the hunger as well as wittles , deary. ’ She hands him the nearly-emptied pipe , and sinks back , turning over on her face .
__label__1	“ Indeed I am lost here .
__label__1	The Jew then , taking leave of his affectionate friend , returned homeward , attended by <NAME> and the boys : <NAME> , meanwhile , flinging himself on the bed , and composing himself to sleep away the time until the young lady 's return .
__label__1	Squeers , ’ said the waiter , looking in at this juncture ; ‘ here ’ s a gentleman asking for you at the bar. ’ ‘ Show the gentleman in , <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> , in a soft voice .
__label__0	Two days subsequent to the governor 's banquet , the officers found themselves at a dinner-party of fifty guests , where no less than forty-four separate dishes were served at each of the three courses of which the dinner consisted .
__label__0	If you dare , meet me there ! ” “ At Judge <NAME> ’ s ? ” said <NAME> , evidently disconcerted .
__label__1	The second letter , at that moment in <NAME> ’ s breast-pocket , particularly remembered him by name .
__label__0	The elegant penmanship all through might easily pass for copper plate engraving -- except on one page , dated `` <NAME> , after dinner_ , '' where , candor compels me to acknowledge , the `` Solid Men '' appear to have succeeded in rendering his iron nerves the least bit wabbly .
__label__0	“ Is the fracture recent ? ” asked Harding .
__label__1	So I said as much .
__label__0	We are about to become the plaything of the great phenomena of the earth !
__label__1	<NAME> praised <NAME> more to me that night than ever she had praised him yet .
__label__1	He took the same occasion of inviting them to a comprehensive entertainment , to be given to the whole College in the yard , and at which he signified he would have the honour of taking a parting glass to the health and happiness of all those whom he was about to leave behind .
__label__1	Anything you like. ” “ But , <NAME> , do hear me speak .
__label__1	Love to <NAME> at the next music-lesson. ’ ‘ You expect <NAME> , then ? ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	I heard him say so . '
__label__0	It is for my luggage and instruments that I am afraid .
__label__0	The atmosphere , violently agitated by the electric commotions , could not recover its former purity , and there was almost invariably rain and fog , except for three or four fine days on which several excursions were made .
__label__1	‘ Wery good , <NAME> , a dispensation if you like it better , ’ returned <NAME> ; ‘ I call it a dispensary , and it ’ s always writ up so , at the places vere they gives you physic for nothin ’ in your own bottles ; that ’ s all. ’ With these words , <NAME> refilled and relighted his pipe , and once more summoning up a meditative expression of countenance , continued as follows -- ‘ Therefore , my boy , as I do not see the adwisability o ’ stoppin here to be married vether I vant to or not , and as at the same time I do not vish to separate myself from them interestin ’ members o ’ society altogether , I have come to the determination o ’ driving the <NAME> , and puttin ’ up vunce more at the <NAME> , vich is my nat ’ ral born element , Sammy. ’ ‘ And wot ’ s to become o ’ the bis ’ ness ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
__label__0	`` The planet that we call the <NAME> , '' continued the <NAME> , as grave as a judge , `` will become uninhabitable to human beings , after a lapse of 400 thousand years from the present time . ''
__label__0	`` Then you did n't turn it over enough ! ''
__label__0	`` The town of <NAME> , '' says the narrative , `` shut in between bare hills , can be seen from afar ; the whiteness of its buildings rendering it very conspicuous .
__label__1	The opened half-door was opened a little further , and secured at that angle for the time .
__label__0	At this moment some of the crew told me that two or three of the Manevaï men on board had done the same thing during the last three or four days , and M. Gressien , who had been watching their movements since the morning , thought he had seen the warriors of the two tribes meet on the beach and have a long conference together .
__label__0	And indeed the table was laid .
__label__1	I rose and joined <NAME> , who was by this time putting on her bonnet .
__label__1	You go and tramp , ' he ses .
__label__0	With my spiral I have subjected it inside to as much as one hundred and fifty-eight degrees sometimes , and the covering does not appear to have suffered. ” “ A cloud !
__label__0	It was a charming house , built of wood and brick , hidden in groves of emerophilis .
__label__0	remarked my uncle as we sat down to a late breakfast ; `` refresh yourself , my boy , and we will take a run through the town . ''
__label__1	If the result should be -- ha -- mutually satisfactory , I might afterwards engage him to try his hand upon my family. ’ The exquisitely bold and original thought presented itself to Mr Sparkler , that there was an opening here for saying there were some of the family ( emphasising ‘ some ’ in a marked manner ) to whom no painter could render justice .
__label__1	A buzz and hum go up around me , as if the boys were so many bluebottles .
__label__0	A few days after the ceremony , <NAME> and <NAME> , accompanied by <NAME> , took the route to <NAME> .
__label__1	Well ; arter the tea was over , they sang another hymn , and then the shepherd began to preach : and wery well he did it , considerin ’ how heavy them muffins must have lied on his chest .
__label__1	I fancied , as I looked at her , that I slipped hopelessly back into the coarse and common boy again .
__label__0	These were the <NAME> , the <NAME> , and <NAME> , so named because it was the tenth island seen .
__label__0	He had received warning that three <NAME> ships awaited him in the open sea , with the intention of barring his passage ; however , without taking any heed of this news , he put to sea , cleverly avoided meeting his enemies , and steering directly westward , he lost all sight of land .
__label__0	I ’ m sure they must feel like worshipping us ! ” “ Let them worship away , then , ” replied the doctor , “ but at a distance .
__label__1	`` They would n't have nothink to say to me if I wos to go to a nice innocent place fur to live .
__label__1	He has time before him , and the race to run .
__label__0	On the next day , therefore , by means of the sextant , the engineer made the necessary observations to verify the position which he had already obtained , and this was the result of his operation .
__label__1	There is no lack of comfortable furnished apartments in <NAME> , and no difficulty in finding some that are proportionate to very slender finances ; but the former were too good , and the latter too bad , and they went into so many houses , and came out unsuited , that <NAME> seriously began to think he should be obliged to ask permission to spend the night in the theatre , after all .
__label__0	Were n't we both half-killed by the shock ?
__label__0	It was certainly on the way , but as certainly it could not now reach <NAME> for several days ; and , this being the last English territory on <NAME> 's route , the robber would escape , unless he could manage to detain him .
__label__0	As they turn their backs to the north , the east is on their left , and the west to their right .
__label__0	This information could not but cause him great uneasiness , and increase his wish of being beyond the <NAME> , so as to judge for himself of the truth of these rumors , and enable him to guard against any possible contingency .
__label__1	However , sir , such as the place is , and so long as it lasts , here it is at your service . ''
__label__0	Upon the one side learned men , such as <NAME> , declared the discoveries made by <NAME> to be illusory , for the reason that <NAME> , and , as a matter of course , the Ten Years Siege , existed only in the imagination of the <NAME> poet ; whilst others , and principally the <NAME> portion of his critics , adopted his conclusions .
__label__0	I exclaimed , `` the same name as our sailing-master 's . ''
__label__1	This last manifestation as by far the most alarming , by reason of its threatening his prolonged stay on the premises , necessitated vigorous measures .
__label__0	The shades of night were drawing on .
__label__0	<NAME> has done it as well as I. ” “ At what height ? ” asked <NAME> .
__label__0	“ That give us -- nothing ! ” And in fact the _h_ placed under the _r_ could not be expressed by a cipher , for , in alphabetical order , this letter occupies an earlier position to that of the _r._ The _p , _ the _y , _ the _j , _ arranged beneath the letters _o , t , e , _ disclosed the cipher 1 , 4 , 5 , but as for the _s_ and the _l_ at the end of the word , the interval which separated them from the _g_ and the _a_ was a dozen letters , and hence impossible to express by a single cipher , so that they corresponded to neither _g_ nor _a_ .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , as <NAME> turned to go .
__label__1	I want to say a word to you. ’ He raised himself a little in his low bed , as she kneeled beside it to bring her face near him ; and put his hand between hers .
__label__0	But that was not <NAME> ’ s idea , who did not intend to give up the wicket , but have it in his power to send off the news just as the events occurred .
__label__0	Do you hear me , <NAME> ?
__label__0	I felt ready to choke .
__label__0	<NAME> is one of the largest islands in <NAME> .
__label__1	At length , he stopped in front of one , more humble in appearance and more dirty than any he had yet seen ; and , having crossed over and surveyed it from the opposite pavement , graciously announced his intention of putting up there , for the night .
__label__0	Innocent ! ” Then complete silence fell on all .
__label__1	It led to my remarking , with more zeal than discretion , that it came with a bad grace from him , to whom <NAME> had lent money in my presence but a week or so before .
__label__1	The suspense seemed to have taken a new lease , and to have begun afresh from a recent date .
__label__1	But do n't you fret yourself on that score .
__label__0	Every arrangement had been made to insure safety and speed , for crossing the Andes is something more than an ordinary journey .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , ’ said the watchful <NAME> , observing the effect which the praise of <NAME> had produced .
__label__0	`` You must be mistaken , <NAME> . ''
__label__0	They must therefore be saved beforehand , or all hope would be lost .
__label__1	I mustn ’ t be put upon , as a numble person , too much .
__label__1	Under pretence of looking for <NAME> , she got him out against the stream of gay company now pouring in for the evening assembly , and got him into a coach that had just set down its load , and got him home .
__label__1	‘ Nothing for me , sir , thank you , ’ anxiously undrawing the strings of the little bag ; ‘ but if , while you stay here , you could be so kind as to teach my sister cheap -- ’ ‘ My child , I ’ ll teach her for nothing , ’ said the dancing-master , shutting up the bag .
__label__1	Mr <NAME> was much distressed when the quarter of an hour expired , and came hopping in , a very bad second .
__label__0	<NAME> , because the overturned block , having slid by degrees , had found a resting-place on the lateral walls , which kept it in that position .
__label__0	cried the <NAME> , gesticulating well enough _à l'étudiant_ , but rather mixing his metaphors .
__label__1	<NAME> , in her innocent affliction , might have answered , ‘ Oh my brother , oh my dearly loved and loving brother !
__label__0	<NAME> , an optimist by nature , found everything agreeable , and as by chance both lodging and food were to his taste , he jotted down in his book some memoranda particularly favorable to the town of Nijni-Novgorod .
__label__1	Around and around the house the leaves fall thick , but never fast , for they come circling down with a dead lightness that is sombre and slow .
__label__1	His shop was shut and he was not there , which was a relief to <NAME> , and left her quite alone .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> made this one last objection , that the presence of <NAME> was necessary to discover traces of the <NAME> or <NAME> .
__label__0	The pennant hung motionless from the maintop-gallant- mast truck .
__label__1	After a few words of preparation , we then went in search of <NAME> , whom we found , grouped with his hat and gloves , as a model of deportment , on the sofa in his private apartment -- the only comfortable room in the house .
__label__0	To gratify this natural yearning of humanity , to afford not only to every foreigner but to every native in the land an opportunity of beholding the three heroes who had reflected such indelible glory on the <NAME> name , and to do it all in a manner eminently worthy of the great <NAME> , instantly became the desire of the <NAME> .
__label__0	This done and a fresh stock of provisions having been laid in , he resumed his voyage .
__label__1	<NAME> to see it accomplished , and yet patient , she waited for the last fall , as for the ripeness and fulness of the harvest of her hopes .
__label__0	“ Very well , ” said <NAME> , without speaking of the anonymous letter .
__label__0	He traced out his island , which he called <NAME> , and made a line for the little river upon the shore of which we were -- placing it two-thirds of the length of the island from north to south .
__label__1	By degrees , old <NAME> , thus familiarized with the idea of his son 's marriage , had worked up his parental feelings to the height of contemplating that event as being near at hand and had given his gracious consent to the young couple commencing housekeeping at the academy in <NAME> Street when they would .
__label__0	Top , at the foot of the palisade , was jumping , barking , but it was with pleasure , not anger .
__label__1	The nervousness and dread that were upon him inspired that vague uneasiness respecting the <NAME> , which a great change would naturally awaken , with such feelings roused .
__label__0	These wretches , who were as miserable and debased as possible , subsisted upon the raw flesh of seals and penguins .
__label__1	Sounding <NAME> , and finding him of her opinion , <NAME> resorted to the <NAME> of <NAME> , attended by her cavalier .
__label__1	A hard family likeness was on all these things .
__label__1	“ Of course I know that. ” “ How do you know it ? ” said I .
__label__1	After very anxious scrutiny , he came out of his retreat , and went briskly down the street as if he were going away altogether ; then , suddenly turned about , and went , at the same pace , and with the same feint , up the street .
__label__0	For this reason he named the river which flowed into the sea at this place <NAME> dos <NAME> ( River of good tokens ) .
__label__0	“ Why , for my part , on the contrary , I should have taken special care to preserve megatheriums and pterodactyles , and all the antediluvian species of which we are unfortunately deprived by his neglect. ” “ And I say , ” returned <NAME> , “ that <NAME> did a very good thing when he abandoned them to their fate -- that is , if they lived in his day. ” “ And I say he did a very bad thing , ” retorted <NAME> , “ and he has justly merited the malediction of <NAME> to the end of time ! ” The rest of the party could not help laughing at hearing the two friends disputing over old Noah .
__label__1	You hold your life on the condition that to the last you shall struggle hard for it .
__label__0	These were then easily taken out , and drawn away by the lower end , which was hermetically sealed by means of a strong ligature .
__label__0	<NAME> and phlegmatic , with a clear eye , <NAME> seemed a perfect type of that <NAME> composure which <NAME> has so skilfully represented on canvas .
__label__0	The wall had fallen headlong and been then shattered to fragments , and a few of the rocks of the large room were piled one above another to form this point .
__label__1	“ Let us never be blind , ” said <NAME> , “ to her faults of temper , but it is to be hoped she meant well. ” At about this time , I began to observe that he was getting flushed in the face ; as to myself , I felt all face , steeped in wine and smarting .
__label__1	‘ You talk big , you do , but things look pretty black against yourself , to my thinking .
__label__0	The young captain was very much annoyed , however , at the prospect of emptying his coal-bunkers , for he had covered his ship with canvas , intending to take advantage of the slightest breeze .
__label__0	`` But , '' urged <NAME> , `` a town which has been un-lighted for eight or nine hundred years -- '' `` All the more necessary is it , '' replied the burgomaster , emphasizing his words .
__label__1	<NAME> is devoted to him .
__label__1	He is pointing at an empty chair and at a stain upon the ground before it that might be almost covered with a hand .
__label__1	Of the remaining four , two , who grasped their foreheads convulsively , were engaged in solving mathematical problems ; one with his face like a dirty window , from much crying , was endeavouring to flounder through a hopeless number of lines before dinner ; and one sat looking at his task in stony stupefaction and despair -- which it seemed had been his condition ever since breakfast time .
__label__1	Had you any conversation with the prisoner ? ” “ Hardly any .
__label__1	He was still too weak to get up to breakfast ; but , when he came down into the housekeeper 's room next day , his first act was to cast an eager glance at the wall , in the hope of again looking on the face of the beautiful lady .
__label__0	This replacing of the disc was at least an hour 's work .
__label__1	‘ I think there ’ s something , ’ said <NAME> , turning as pale as he could turn .
__label__1	no mistake about that , ’ said a very red-faced man , behind a cigar .
__label__0	Its effect is immediate , but very temporary .
__label__0	The <NAME> , recognizing the rights of individuals , did not attempt to change the religion , laws , or customs of their subjects .
__label__1	'You should , lady , and I know you will , ' rejoined the girl , rising .
__label__0	<NAME> spoke freely of the vanity of competition , of the madness of rivalry , and of the need of agreement between men so far from home .
__label__1	We can go to the <NAME> , or the <NAME> for the <NAME> , or the <NAME> , I dare say ; and the sooner we go the better. ’ With this extraordinary jumble of charitable institutions , Mrs. Nickleby again gave way to her tears .
__label__0	Was not this like a blessing direct from <NAME> ?
__label__1	Within , there were two glasses of rum and milk prepared , and two biscuits .
__label__1	'And this man that 's to be his master -- you , sir -- you 'll treat him well , and feed him , and do all that sort of thing , will you ? '
__label__1	Not less so , when she added : ‘ Even now , I see _you_ shrink from me , as if I had been cruel. ’ Little Dorrit could not gainsay it .
__label__1	‘ Of course you like dancing ? ’ ‘ Oh no , I don ’ t , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	cried M'Nicholl stoutly ; `` I deny the existence of anything of the kind , and I denounce every one that maintains any such whim as a visionary , if not a fool ! ''
__label__1	Big Vig ’ -- and the count was proceeding to enter <NAME> in his tablets , as a gentleman of the long robe , who derived his name from the profession to which he belonged , when Mrs. Leo <NAME> interposed .
__label__0	`` I am certain of it . ''
__label__0	They saw it as I saw it myself , and they will confirm my words . ''
__label__1	<NAME> pound a week -- it ’ s too cheap , <NAME> .
__label__0	There will not always be scientific men , perhaps ; but there always will be poets. ” “ We can still see cataracts , ” said <NAME> .
__label__1	It was a dark , cold night , with a chill , damp wind , which blew the rain heavily against the windows and house-fronts .
__label__1	‘ It is refreshing to know that you hold my excellent friend , <NAME> , in such high esteem .
__label__1	Was he to be told that , he wished to know again , by his own son on his own hearth , to his own face ?
__label__0	“ That ’ s just like you SAVANTS .
__label__1	Everything about him tended to confirm him in the custom of looking on himself as an elderly man , from whom such aspirations as he had combated in the case of <NAME> ( though that was not so long ago either , reckoning by months and seasons ) , were finally departed .
__label__1	‘ I never know ’ d a respectable coachman as wrote poetry , ‘ cept one , as made an affectin ’ copy o ’ werses the night afore he was hung for a highway robbery ; and he wos only a <NAME> man , so even that ’ s no rule. ’ But <NAME> was not to be dissuaded from the poetical idea that had occurred to him , so he signed the letter -- ‘ Your love-sick Pickwick. ’ And having folded it , in a very intricate manner , squeezed a downhill direction in one corner : ‘ To <NAME> , <NAME> , at <NAME> ’ s , <NAME> ’ s , <NAME> , <NAME> ’ ; and put it into his pocket , wafered , and ready for the general post .
__label__0	The train , now detached from the engine , remained a little behind , whilst the locomotive rushed forward with increased speed .
__label__0	<NAME> begged him to tell them all again .
__label__1	‘ I know all about it , <NAME> !
__label__1	There was a bar at the <NAME> , with some alarmingly long chalk scores in it on the wall at the side of the door , which seemed to me to be never paid off .
__label__0	<NAME> could only obtain very vague information of their ceremonies and religion .
__label__0	There was a certain similarity between his disposition and that of <NAME> , but their sympathies were different .
__label__1	Will you tell them to send him up ? ''
__label__1	I said to <NAME> , meanwhile , that even if <NAME> were recognized and taken , in spite of himself , I should be wretched as the cause , however innocently .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> felt that Mrs. <NAME> had audaciously anticipated him , and presumed to be wiser than he .
__label__1	For , <NAME> often stops short at itself and dies with the doer of it ; but <NAME> , never .
__label__1	Does our fiendish contemporary wince ?
__label__1	`` A quarter past , '' said <NAME> , counting .
__label__0	In order to carry out this disguise , he had recourse to many expedients .
__label__1	All people knew ( or thought they knew ) that he had made himself immensely rich ; and , for that reason alone , prostrated themselves before him , more degradedly and less excusably than the darkest savage creeps out of his hole in the ground to propitiate , in some log or reptile , the <NAME> of his benighted soul .
__label__1	If the truth has come out , as it plainly has in a manner that there ’ s no standing up against -- and a very sublime and grand thing is <NAME> , gentlemen , in its way , though like other sublime and grand things , such as thunder-storms and that , we ’ re not always over and above glad to see it -- I had better turn upon this man than let this man turn upon me .
__label__1	But the offices are shut up now , <NAME> .
__label__0	The crust of the vast globe still yielded under the influence of the seething , boiling mass , which was forever at work beneath .
__label__1	‘ Not at all , sir , ’ replied <NAME> ; ‘ it was my fault .
__label__0	There was so much uncertainty in their enterprise !
__label__1	‘ I am a lone lorn creetur ’ , ’ were Mrs. Gummidge ’ s words , when that unpleasant occurrence took place , ‘ and everythink goes contrary with me. ’ ‘ Oh , it ’ ll soon leave off , ’ said <NAME> -- I again mean our Peggotty -- ‘ and besides , you know , it ’ s not more disagreeable to you than to us. ’ ‘ I feel it more , ’ said Mrs. Gummidge .
__label__0	a fall is a grand thing !
__label__0	`` They are snow , '' he exclaimed .
__label__1	‘ I ’ ll take my Alfred <NAME> , ’ muttered Mr Riderhood , slowly relaxing into a dark smile , ‘ that you know a move .
__label__0	<NAME> exquisite dishes , which seemed to descend from heaven , were placed successively before the guests , and the richest wines of <NAME> flowed in profusion during this splendid repast , served nine hundred feet beneath the surface of the earth !
__label__0	The only quadrupeds were pigs , dogs , and rats , who multiplied rapidly .
__label__1	But no temperature made the melancholy mad elephants more mad or more sane .
__label__1	In face , watchful behind a blind ; habitually not uncensorious and contemptuous perhaps .
__label__0	`` Well , then , what do you mean by repeating the name of the man whose pernicious advice led my brother to the island on which the <NAME> was lost , the greater part of her crew was massacred , and where we have not found even one left of those who were still here seven months ago ? ''
__label__1	The night crept on apace , the moon went down , the stars grew pale and dim , and morning , cold as they , slowly approached .
__label__1	I was not aware of it myself , but I felt it necessary to uphold the institutions of my county , and to evince a familiarity with them ; so I shook my head , as much as to say , ‘ I believe you ! ’ ‘ And the <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ You can make almost any theme amusing to me , <NAME> , but not this. ’ ‘ Well ! ’ cried <NAME> , ‘ I am a little ashamed of it myself , and therefore let us change the subject. ’ ‘ It is so deplorably underhanded , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Indeed ? ’ was all she answered .
__label__1	<NAME> , sir , ’ returned brother <NAME> : no less mildly than before , but firmly too : ‘ I come here against my will , sorely and grievously against my will .
__label__1	It may be something in the air -- there is plenty in it -- or it may be something in himself that is in fault ; but <NAME> , otherwise Jobling , is very ill at ease .
__label__1	After this memorable event , I went to the hatter 's , and the bootmaker 's , and the hosier 's , and felt rather like <NAME> 's dog whose outfit required the services of so many trades .
__label__1	On my imparting this discovery in confidence to <NAME> , she informed me that her brother dealt in lobsters , crabs , and crawfish ; and I afterwards found that a heap of these creatures , in a state of wonderful conglomeration with one another , and never leaving off pinching whatever they laid hold of , were usually to be found in a little wooden outhouse where the pots and kettles were kept .
__label__1	Every session had its anecdotes of that kind , and the actors were all there .
__label__0	The presence of humanity , even of the lowest type , would have revealed itself in some form or other , by boundaries , by buildings , even by ruins .
__label__1	I found <NAME> to be a middle-aged gentleman , with a short throat , and a good deal of shirt-collar , who only wanted a black nose to be the portrait of a pug-dog .
__label__1	‘ It ’ s quite another matter in the case of a man like me .
__label__1	`` Now we 're all right again .
__label__0	It was built of long planks , bent at each end , and kept in position by two strong cords .
__label__1	That would make it quite complete , that would : quite. ’ When he had become restored to his usual condition by these and other comments on his approaching triumph , <NAME> put away his book , and , having locked the chest with great caution , descended into the kitchen to warn <NAME> to bed , and scold her for having afforded such ready admission to a stranger .
__label__1	<NAME> , the gentleman who had the pleasure of meeting <NAME> at the house of their mutual acquaintance , <NAME> , a few days since , begs to inclose <NAME> the herewith invitation .
__label__0	`` Excellent , my dear <NAME> ; only permit me to offer one remark : My wish is to tell my story once for all , to everybody , and then have done with it ; then there will be no need for recapitulation .
__label__1	I prepared <NAME> for <NAME> ’ s arrival and it was not long before he came .
__label__1	My dear friend Mr <NAME> is dying. ’ The dressmaker clasped her hands , and uttered a little piteous cry .
__label__0	The engine , which was constructed on a new system , was a high-pressure one , of 160-horse power , and put in motion a double screw .
__label__1	‘ That ’ s capital ! ’ he whispered , giving <NAME> such a hug that it squeezed a new expression into his face .
__label__0	But we were not in any great danger , and he might have been saved , since the rest of us were saved . ''
__label__1	While he smoked out his cigar in peace , she made his bed , and put the small room in order for his repose .
__label__1	If you tell me that he is dead , I am in your debt and bound to you for life .
__label__0	But all depended on <NAME> ’ s success in his perilous enterprise .
__label__1	Thoroughly tired , I went to bed too , at midnight ; passed the next day on the Dover coach ; burst safe and sound into my aunt ’ s old parlour while she was at tea ( she wore spectacles now ) ; and was received by her , and <NAME> , and dear old Peggotty , who acted as housekeeper , with open arms and tears of joy .
__label__0	to-morrow we will go and hunt the bear . ''
__label__0	`` Up with the helm , reverse the engines . ''
__label__0	Other plates , closely fitted , covered the lenticular glasses , and the travelers , hermetically enclosed in their metal prison , were plunged in profound darkness .
__label__1	is there no chord in your heart that I can touch !
__label__0	As he obtained neither encouragement nor help from the colonial government , he went to <NAME> , where the governor , who did not wish to deprive <NAME> of the credit of being the first to arrive at <NAME> , rejected his proposals .
__label__1	For it seemed that <NAME> had a dreadful Uncle , who not only volunteered examinations of him , in the holidays , on abstruse points , but twisted innocent events and things , and wrenched them to the same fell purpose .
__label__0	`` Captain , '' answered the carpenter , `` it is true we have no family awaiting us in <NAME> , but our country is our country : do n't you think of going back ? ''
__label__1	`` Then it was your young man who came for me .
__label__1	Worn out as she was , and fatigued in mind and body , she sat up alone , counting the minutes , until he returned -- penniless , broken-spirited , and wretched , but still hotly bent upon his infatuation .
__label__0	“ Well , my dear <NAME> , ” said <NAME> , “ here is a very secure retreat , well hid in the depths of the rock , but it is , however , uninhabitable. ” “ Why uninhabitable ? ” asked the sailor .
__label__1	The little dried gentleman was so occupied with his own depressed reflections that he did not notice the remark until the sound of Mr Fledgeby ’ s voice had died out of the counting-house .
__label__1	You are sure you understand. ’ He had wormed a finger , in the darkness , through a button-hole of <NAME> ’ s coat , and was screwing that corner of the garment tight up round and round , in an extraordinary manner .
__label__1	And besides , <NAME> ! -- Will you never , without strong reason , let pass your lips what I am going to say ? ’ She bent forward to say it in a whisper .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> , then , loved <NAME> , but quietly , as a man would love when he has ten years before him in which to obtain the beloved object .
__label__1	‘ As to myself , sir , ’ said Mr Rugg , hoping that his eloquence had reduced him to a state of indecision , ‘ it is a principle of mine not to consider myself when a client ’ s inclinations are in the scale .
__label__1	Sit ye down , and give me your forgiveness for having ever been a worrit to you , <NAME> ’ l -- what have my contraries ever been to this ! -- and let us speak a word about them times when she was first an orphan , and when <NAME> was too , and when I was a poor widder woman , and you took me in .
__label__1	I devote myself at daybreak to-morrow morning , to bringing <NAME> here .
__label__1	Slowly , therefore , and in a quiet tone of voice , he explained them as best he could , and enlarged on the nature of <NAME> ’ s service .
__label__0	He never could have imagined that <NAME> was being tracked as a robber around the globe .
__label__0	His face , on which a bluish light cast a peculiar hue , became almost fearful to look at , and then , as if his eyes had been opened to the bright blaze spreading across the river , “ Ah ! ” he exclaimed , “ then Heaven itself is against us ! ” <NAME> , the capital of <NAME> , is a populous town , containing , in ordinary times , thirty thousand inhabitants .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> p ’ raps it ’ s a more tenderer word , ’ said <NAME> , after a few moments ’ reflection .
__label__1	‘ I look sharply after most men that I deal with , and most of all I looked sharply after you .
__label__1	The latter faithful appendage is also invariably a part of the old girl 's presence out of doors .
__label__0	From the windows of the palace important preparations on the opposite shore could be distinctly seen .
__label__1	“ No objection. ” I thanked him and ran home again , and there I found that <NAME> had already locked the front door and vacated the state parlor , and was seated by the kitchen fire with a hand on each knee , gazing intently at the burning coals .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> , the officers , and engineers consulted together , and had it posted up that , if the offender was surprised on board , he would be thrown without further trial into the sea .
__label__0	“ Let us be off ! ” said he , in a decided tone .
__label__1	She put her needless candle in the shadow at a distance , crept up to his bed , and put her lips to his ; then , leaned over him , and looked at him .
__label__0	This town is built on the <NAME> , and the greater part of its outer walls is now in ruins .
__label__1	Is it possible , I wonder , that there was any analogy between the case of the <NAME> population and the case of the little Gradgrinds ?
__label__1	<NAME> ith a bad piethe of bithnith , thith ith .
__label__1	<NAME> as the counting-house dial , which he maintained to be the best time-keeper in <NAME> next after the clock of some old , hidden , unknown church hard by , ( for <NAME> held the fabled goodness of that at the <NAME> to be a pleasant fiction , invented by jealous West-enders , ) the old clerk performed the minutest actions of the day , and arranged the minutest articles in the little room , in a precise and regular order , which could not have been exceeded if it had actually been a real glass case , fitted with the choicest curiosities .
__label__1	‘ There ’ s something wrong ! ’ ‘ How do you know it ? ’ demanded <NAME> .
__label__1	In damp weather , the place is rendered close , by the steams of moist acts of parliament and frouzy petitions ; general postmen grow faint as they enter its infected limits , and shabby figures in quest of franks , flit restlessly to and fro like the troubled ghosts of <NAME> Letter-writers departed .
__label__0	Hissing and spluttering as the hot lava came in contact with it , the water was in a continual state of ebullition , and the fish that abounded in its depths defied the angler ’ s craft ; they were , as <NAME> remarked , “ too much boiled to bite. ” At the beginning of April the weather changed .
__label__0	Are there not people living in the Observatory who could explain all this ? ” “ <NAME> likely ; but what of that ? ” “ Let us be philosophers , and wait patiently until we can hear their explanation. ” <NAME> smiled .
__label__1	But I held to it , and the harder it was , the stronger I held , for I was determined , and my mind firm made up .
__label__0	cried <NAME> as enthusiastically as his companions ; `` all 's not over yet by a long shot ! ''
__label__1	I have no more to say .
__label__1	Never mind ; send some bread -- only a loaf of bread and a cup of water .
__label__1	So let it be. ’ After yielding herself up , in this pattern manner , to sisterly advice and the force of circumstances , <NAME> became quite benignant : as one who had laid her own inclinations at the feet of her dearest friend , and felt a glow of conscience in having made the sacrifice .
__label__0	I should have liked to help you to escape , but it was so difficult to avoid the vigilance of my grandfather .
__label__0	`` No , but I have some quicksilver . ''
__label__1	In this complicated dilemma , Mr Veneering approaches the large man with extended hand and , smilingly assures that incorrigible personage that he is delighted to see him : who in his fatal freshness instantly replies : ‘ Thank you .
__label__1	The old gentleman having exhausted his powers of persuasion , alighted to lead him ; whereupon the pony , perhaps because he held this to be a sufficient concession , perhaps because he happened to catch sight of the other brass-plate , or perhaps because he was in a spiteful humour , darted off with the old lady and stopped at the right house , leaving the old gentleman to come panting on behind .
__label__1	The air was filled with phantoms , wandering hither and thither in restless haste , and moaning as they went .
__label__1	‘ Why , confound the woman , ’ exclaimed <NAME> , ‘ she IS sentimental !
__label__1	His great theme was ‘ Warren the ěn_gine_ driver , ’ whom he pressed into the service of every sentence he uttered .
__label__1	The ground was measured , some usual forms gone through , the two principals were placed front to front at the distance agreed upon , and <NAME> turned his face towards his young adversary for the first time .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> ( of <NAME> Salem-House <NAME> , <NAME> ) presided , and on his right sat the distinguished guest .
__label__1	And now come here , and I 'll show you how to take the marks out of the handkerchiefs . '
__label__1	Better far than all the <NAME> put together know him. ’ Mrs. Tope ’ s care has spread a very neat , clean breakfast ready for her lodger .
__label__1	To see the great wheels slowly turning , and to think of being run down and crushed !
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> had estimated the average height of the chain at 22,000 feet , and even this would appear to be less than the reality .
__label__1	“ O my father ! ” for he stood before her when she lifted up the eyes she had momentarily darkened with her hand ; “ such a cruel , bad sight. ” “ I know , my dear , I know .
__label__1	I saw them first at their work ( basket-making , and the manufacture of palm-leaf hats ) , afterwards in their school , where they sang a chorus in praise of <NAME> : an odd , and , one would think , rather aggravating , theme for prisoners .
__label__1	When I tried to conquer my misplaced love , and to be generous to the man who was more fortunate than I , though he should never know it or repay me with a gracious word , in whom had I watched patience , self-denial , self-subdual , charitable construction , the noblest generosity of the affections ?
__label__0	<NAME> albatrosses are also met with here , some of them measuring seventeen feet from tip to tip of their wings .
__label__0	“ Things must indeed change should it ever be brought to a conclusion !
__label__1	‘ Now , ’ said Mr Garland when they had made some further inquiries of him , ‘ I am not going to give you anything -- ’ ‘ Thank you , sir , ’ Kit replied ; and quite seriously too , for this announcement seemed to free him from the suspicion which the Notary had hinted .
__label__0	The evil deeds of such men would certainly , in the course of three years have betrayed their existence and lurking-places .
__label__1	‘ He broke it over me .
__label__1	At that point , my convict became so frantically exasperated , that he would have rushed upon him but for the interposition of the soldiers .
__label__0	But had not <NAME> escaped one peril only to fall into another ?
__label__1	It was not too much trouble , and Mr <NAME> came up .
__label__0	It was wonderful to see how rapidly the bottles of wine and the flasks of rum and of brandy were emptied , and to witness the speedy disappearance of the viands with which the table had been covered .
__label__0	A noise of bolts was now heard , the door opened , and two men appeared .
__label__1	“ What do you mean ? ” said I , half suspecting him to be mad .
__label__1	<NAME> and patience , hope and patience ! ’ These words were uttered in too low a tone to reach the ears of the young men .
__label__0	The sight of the <NAME> enchanted him .
__label__0	At length this vast effusion of electric light faded away , and soon after the “ Nautilus , ” now the tomb of <NAME> , reposed in its ocean bed .
__label__1	‘ There , Mr Blandois ! ’ said <NAME> , showing it , ‘ I hope you may think that worth coming so high to see .
__label__1	'You must compose yourself , ' said the doctor supporting her .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , dear , ’ she said , ‘ I have been looking for you everywhere. ’ As she sat down by the side of <NAME> , she stooped and kissed her hand .
__label__0	A few moments more , and they had fallen in the forest of <NAME> .
__label__1	' I am not here by accident , ' he added after a lengthened silence ; 'nor have I heard all this to-night , for I knew it yesterday -- only yesterday .
__label__1	Wretched marriages don ’ t come of such things , in our degree ; only wretchedness and ruin .
__label__0	“ Perhaps there may be some valuable substance in this volcano , which it will spout forth , and which we may turn to good account ! ” <NAME> shook his head with the air of a man who augured no good from the phenomenon whose development had been so sudden .
__label__0	That which play had robbed him of , he resolved to recover from the <NAME> .
__label__1	' I think you will , ' said Mrs. Mann , who had noticed the tone of the refusal , and the gesture that had accompanied it .
__label__1	His enemy , muttering to himself , after wringing his wounded hand for sometime , slowly drew off his neck-kerchief and bound it up ; then held it in his other hand , and sat upon his table with his sullen face looking down .
__label__0	The brig obeyed at once , turning to the point directed ; the screw churned the water , and the <NAME> plunged under a full head of steam between two swiftly running ice-streams .
__label__1	<NAME> hands have strewn the ground deep with snow , that the lightest footstep may be lighter yet ; and the very birds are dead , that they may not wake her .
__label__1	‘ It ’ s tolerably clear to _me_ , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ that the little puss can get small good out of such companionship. ’ ‘ Are you speaking of young <NAME> , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Yes , ma ’ am , I ’ m speaking of Louisa. ’ ‘ Your observation being limited to “ little puss , ” ’ said Mrs. Sparsit , ‘ and there being two little girls in question , I did not know which might be indicated by that expression. ’ ‘ Louisa , ’ repeated <NAME> .
__label__1	They 're only jealous , <NAME> , because he wo n't give it to them . '
__label__0	The police had great difficulty in keeping back the crowd , and as the hour when <NAME> was due approached , the excitement rose to its highest pitch .
__label__1	<NAME> Whiffers then added that he feared a portion of this outrage might be traced to his own forbearing and accommodating disposition .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> allowed <NAME> to obey it , in silence .
__label__0	said I , `` it no longer changes its place ? ''
__label__0	There they intended to be guided by circumstances as to their route across the invaded country , either together or separately , according as their news-hunting instinct set them on one track or another .
__label__0	The rate of progress , however rapid it might be , can not produce any sensible effect on the human frame when it takes place in a vacuum , or when the mass of air circulates with the body which is carried with it .
__label__0	In a few minutes the engineer was made acquainted with the state of affairs .
__label__1	‘ You ’ re the best of human creatures .
__label__0	The worthy magistrate recalled to his mind all the incidents of the incomprehensible performance .
__label__0	<NAME> thunder growled in the sky .
__label__0	During the day she skirted <NAME> , passed <NAME> , and directed her course rapidly eastward .
__label__1	Learning from <NAME> that the invitation referred to the evening then wearing away , I expressed my readiness to do honour to it ; and we went off together to the lodging which <NAME> occupied as <NAME> , and which was situated near the top of the <NAME> ’ s <NAME> .
__label__0	The entire vegetation which could thrive on this mass of lava consisted of two or three kinds of rugose grass , which grew on the rocks , scanty bushes , especially the paper-mulberry , the 'hibiscus , ' and the mimosa , and some plantains .
__label__1	Upon this doubtful ground , lived Mrs. Wititterly , and at Mrs. Wititterly ’ s door <NAME> knocked with trembling hand .
__label__0	A weight of four thousand pounds is represented by a displacement of the air amounting to forty-four thousand eight hundred and forty-seven cubic feet ; or , in other words , forty-four thousand eight hundred and forty-seven cubic feet of air weigh about four thousand pounds .
__label__0	They then ascended to <NAME> , when they were always ready to go to bed .
__label__1	But see how they glisten with old remembrances !
__label__0	`` I believe you , '' added <NAME> , `` and these derelicts are more dangerous than a rock , for they are now here and again there , and there 's no avoiding them . ''

__label__0	“ Whatever happens , do not leave this spot. ” “ You will find me where I now am. ” <NAME> pressed her hand , and , turning the corner of the slope , disappeared in the darkness .
__label__0	The granite , worn by the water for an infinite time , was very slippery , and falls were to be dreaded .
__label__0	I have endeavoured in vain to trace the origin , or cause of formation of this extraordinary association , and have reason to suppose , that it is now unknown to the generality of the <NAME> , and may possibly be even so to the Purrah themselves , in a country where no traditionary records are extant , either in writing or in song . ''
__label__1	‘ Come in , come in , whoever you be : I can ’ t see you till I light a match , yet I seem to know the sound of your speaking .
__label__1	He frightened every one away from him when he was alive , to profit us when he was dead !
__label__1	<NAME> , Florence. ’ <NAME> turned so pale , and spoke so earnestly , that <NAME> did not need her restraining hand upon her lips .
__label__0	The sea became more and more boisterous .
__label__1	and I should like to leave a small balance in his favour , to be settled when he can .
__label__0	At the fifty-fifth , a loud cry was heard in the street , followed by applause , hurrahs , and some fierce growls .
__label__0	The constancy of this refreshing breeze renders the climate of the river <NAME> agreeable , and even delightful. ” The <NAME> has likewise testified that if the temperature does not drop below 25 degrees <NAME> , it never rises above 33 degrees , and this gives for the year a mean temperature of from 28 degrees to 29 degrees , with a range of only 8 degrees .
__label__1	But don ’ t let us stop to listen to it ; let us get away ! ’ Her hurry is over as soon as they have passed out of the Close .
__label__1	That was how the phrase began to circulate , and what it meant ; nothing more. ’ ‘ How do they call him ? ’ said the landlady .
__label__1	It is for his good .
__label__1	<NAME> had been dozing ; but looked worse , and was more feverish than he had appeared yet .
__label__0	`` Men or beasts may possibly object to our visit .
__label__0	The <NAME> de <NAME> had the frigate _Aurora_ built at his own cost for this experiment .
__label__0	Besides , the smell would have betrayed it ; and in that case <NAME> could not have carried a lighted match with impunity through the space filled with hydrogen .
__label__1	All the ladies in the prison had got hold of the news , and were in the yard .
__label__0	The moment of departure had come .
__label__1	So I thanked her ardently for this mark of her affection , and for all her other kindnesses towards me ; and after a tender good night , she took her nightcap into my bedroom .
__label__0	The stay of the <NAME> at the <NAME> of <NAME> had not , however , been sufficiently long to allow <NAME> to investigate many subjects of much interest , but this omission was remedied by the polite readiness shown by some of the leading residents in supplying him with valuable papers on the agriculture of the island , its commerce , its financial position , the industrial pursuits , and the social condition of the people , the correct appreciation of which demanded a more careful and minute examination than a mere passing traveller could possibly give to them .
__label__0	`` Nevertheless , <NAME> , you possess an extreme rapidity of movement , which does not agree well with the power of electricity .
__label__1	He rather congratulated himself on his prudence when the single gentleman , without notice or explanation of any kind , double-locked the door .
__label__0	They then directed their course to <NAME> 's <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ It created an immense sensation .
__label__1	‘ Mrs Blimber , ’ said Mr Toots , ‘ allow me to present my wife. ’ Mrs Blimber was delighted to receive her .
__label__1	‘ You ’ re the only person that ’ s kind to me , Goodwin. ’ At this affecting appeal , <NAME> got up a little domestic tragedy of her own , and shed tears copiously .
__label__1	<NAME> do not be uneasy when I tell you , but it was not quite so airy , nor so bright , nor so cheerful , nor so happy and youthful altogether as I should have liked it to be .
__label__1	Then is there a singular kind of parallel between her and the little glass chandeliers of another age embellishing that assembly-room , which , with their meagre stems , their spare little drops , their disappointing knobs where no drops are , their bare little stalks from which knobs and drops have both departed , and their little feeble prismatic twinkling , all seem <NAME> .
__label__0	Two powerful locomotives , carrying nine cars of invited guests , amongst whom was <NAME> , vice-president of the road , stopped at this point ; cheers were given , the <NAME> and <NAME> performed an imitation <NAME> battle , fireworks were let off , and the first number of the <NAME> was printed by a press brought on the train .
__label__1	'No , no , ' rejoined <NAME> , finding his voice .
__label__0	THE HALF-MILE square of forest was cleared .
__label__1	`` What do you say , <NAME> ? ''
__label__0	However , <NAME> was so well hidden among high rocks , that it could scarcely be discovered either from the land or the sea .
__label__1	I have felt it dreadfully .
__label__0	The next day the settlers went to collect some and returned to <NAME> with an ample supply of cycas stems .
__label__1	You didn ’ t tell me , <NAME> , my dear , ’ added Mrs. Nickleby , turning round with an air of less reserve than she had before assumed , ‘ what your friend ’ s name is. ’ ‘ His name , mother , ’ replied <NAME> , ‘ is Smike. ’ The effect of this communication was by no means anticipated ; but the name was no sooner pronounced , than Mrs. <NAME> dropped upon a chair , and burst into a fit of crying .
__label__0	The wind was fair ; the poor castaways put out to sea on this frail raft .
__label__1	I suppose the opening prospect confused me .
__label__1	‘ We should all try to discharge our duty , <NAME> , and I humbly endeavour to discharge mine , <NAME> ; but it is a hard trial to betray a master , <NAME> , whose clothes you wear , and whose bread you eat , even though he is a scoundrel , Sir. ’ ‘ You are a very good fellow , ’ said <NAME> , much affected ; ‘ an honest fellow. ’ ‘ Come , come , ’ interposed <NAME> , who had witnessed <NAME> ’ s tears with considerable impatience , ‘ blow this ‘ ere water-cart bis ’ ness .
__label__1	Take a chair , <NAME> Weller. ’ <NAME> took a chair , and <NAME> took a box , and the umpires took what they could get , and looked at the almanac and one or two papers which were wafered against the wall , with as much open-eyed reverence as if they had been the finest efforts of the old masters .
__label__0	Of the other men , <NAME> and <NAME> seemed to be the best ; <NAME> was a jolly fellow , always laughing and joking ; <NAME> , a man about thirty-five years old , had an energetic , but rather pale and sad face .
__label__1	The boy who addressed this inquiry to the young wayfarer , was about his own age : but one of the queerest looking boys that <NAME> had even seen .
__label__1	of the honour of his alliance .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> went hurriedly up to the Major .
__label__0	Why should we trouble ourselves about the sufferings and tortures to be endured from hunger when death stared us in the face under so many other swifter and perhaps even more horrid forms ?
__label__0	They are so numerous as to render the interior plateau quite rugged , and were formerly so many openings giving vent to fire and volcanic matter .
__label__0	asked <NAME> , triumphantly , `` It would have enabled us to exchange telegrams with the <NAME> ! ''
__label__0	I often had a good laugh to myself , thinking of your astonishment and the <NAME> 's at seeing a lot of <NAME> poultry scratching for worms on a Lunar dunghill ! ''
__label__1	“ Oh ! ” she replied , glancing over her shoulder as he slouched after us , “ because I -- I am afraid he likes me. ” “ Did he ever tell you he liked you ? ” I asked indignantly .
__label__0	He again interrupted the clerk , who , quite unmoved , merely replied : “ It is his right , sir , it is his right -- at ten copecks a word. ” And he telegraphed the following news , just brought him by <NAME> : “ <NAME> fugitives are escaping from the town .
__label__0	To modify the conditions of the <NAME> ’ s movement is beyond the powers of man .
__label__1	The closing of the door recalled him to himself .
__label__0	<NAME> and <NAME> were first of all told to extract the grease from the dugong , and to keep the flesh , which was destined for food .
__label__0	Supposing <NAME> makes a mistake when he puts <NAME> ’ s theory in practice ?
__label__0	But , <NAME> , this wedding -- this wedding that we are both thinking of -- when is it coming off ?
__label__0	Perhaps it only existed in my own imagination .
__label__0	Was it not with the help of his old defender that he had hoped to strive for his rehabilitation ?
__label__1	' I 'll tell you what it is , gentlemen , ' said he , 'we 're all afraid . '
__label__0	`` as the captain 's letter had said . ''
__label__1	He thought of it , felt how easy it would be to do , and longed to do it ; but had no more power to withdraw the veil than to dismiss the spectre at his side .
__label__0	Five minutes after leaving the cart , <NAME> and <NAME> arrived at the edge of the wood before the clearing beyond which rose the palisade .
__label__1	<NAME> was in my room in the morning before I was up , to bring me that reproachful shaving-water , and to put out my clothes .
__label__1	I have heard her , many a time , talk just like him .
__label__1	He had not a word .
__label__1	I have understood that it was , to the last , her proudest boast , that she never had been on the water in her life , except upon a bridge ; and that over her tea ( to which she was extremely partial ) she , to the last , expressed her indignation at the impiety of mariners and others , who had the presumption to go ‘ meandering ’ about the world .
__label__1	She stopped , and reddened again .
__label__1	‘ I couldn ’ t believe my eyes .
__label__1	<NAME> was glad to walk out into the night air -- was even glad , in spite of his great experience , to sit down upon a door-step for a little while : feeling sick and faint .
__label__1	‘ Yes , Miss. ’ And threw back his head and laughed .
__label__0	It is quite visible from the earth ; and astronomers can study it with ease , particularly during the phase between the last quarter and the new moon , because then the shadows are thrown lengthways from east to west , allowing them to measure the heights .
__label__0	The burgomaster and the counsellor sat down beside each other on a small stone bench , like two worthy people whose souls were in close sympathy .
__label__1	I sincerely believe that in all the madness of <NAME> politics , few public men would have been so earnestly , devotedly , and affectionately caressed , as this most charming writer : and I have seldom respected a public assembly more , than I did this eager throng , when I saw them turning with one mind from noisy orators and officers of state , and flocking with a generous and honest impulse round the man of quiet pursuits : proud in his promotion as reflecting back upon their country : and grateful to him with their whole hearts for the store of graceful fancies he had poured out among them .
__label__1	The Jew shook his head impatiently , and said in a whisper , 'Is _he_ here ? '
__label__0	<NAME> was wise enough to understand this , and felt he must set an example in obedience .
__label__0	He made for the <NAME> , quickly gained his chamber , and slid under the bedclothes , while an army of a hundred thousand men kept watch under his windows .
__label__1	The short-hand writers , the reporters of the court , and the reporters of the newspapers invariably decamp with the rest of the regulars when <NAME> and <NAME> comes on .
__label__0	<NAME> was the region the <NAME> was now visiting , a perfect meadow , a close carpet of seaweed , fucus , and tropical berries , so thick and so compact that the stem of a vessel could hardly tear its way through it .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> was nearly at his side ; <NAME> , still heading some of her women , was visible in the inner distance , and her knife was in her hand .
__label__0	“ No , my Lord , ” replied <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ What the dey -- ’ ‘ As a bait for you , ’ repeated his friend ; ‘ old <NAME> told me so himself. ’ ‘ What a fine old cock it is ! ’ exclaimed <NAME> ; ‘ a noble rascal ! ’ ‘ Yes , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ he knew she was a smart little creature -- ’ ‘ Smart ! ’ interposed the young lord .
__label__1	When they had both accosted it , and spoken many kind words , <NAME> turned back one last time with her hand stretched out , saying , ‘ Good-bye , good <NAME> !
__label__0	<NAME> tools and , above all , guns were eagerly sought for by the islanders in exchange for their provisions ; and the mercenery traders , regardless of consequences , readily gratified their desires .
__label__0	This proud old man remained motionless , as insensible and silent as a stone statue ; and even at the solemn moment when the bell announced the miracle of transubstantiation , he did not bow his head , but gazed directly at the sacred host which the priest raised above the heads of the faithful .
__label__1	He then rubbed that out and turned the letter `` r , '' and asked me the same question .
__label__1	Go aside ! ” said <NAME> .
__label__0	Let this car be abandoned in space .
__label__1	It was as if a professed unbeliever in ghosts should be frightened by a ghost story .
__label__1	The long rows of gaunt black piles , slimy and wet and weather-worn , with funeral garlands of seaweed twisted about them by the late tide , might have represented an unsightly marine cemetery .
__label__0	On the 19th October the <NAME> passed the mouth of the <NAME> , which <NAME> had crossed near <NAME> on his first expedition , and a little later they came in sight of <NAME> .
__label__1	I know my duty better now .
__label__0	Thus , highly excited , <NAME> 's moral energy triumphed over physical weakness , and he rose to his feet .
__label__0	They talked in a low voice , and the blind man , adding what they told him to what he already knew , was able to form an exact idea of the state of things .
__label__0	Now , just as I was writing , the newspaper was lying on the ground , folded in such a manner that only two syllables of the title were visible ; these two syllables were <NAME> .
__label__1	But he thought it better not to ask the question ; and walked back to the shop : thinking over all he had seen and heard .
__label__1	He is truly military , and full of anecdote .
__label__1	In my child ’ s name , if not in my own , I make the admission in the fullest manner , at the same time reserving -- ha -- shall I say my personal dignity ?
__label__0	Desirous of satisfying the <NAME> mob , as well as the mob of other countries , the <NAME> Government decided to bring J. T. <NAME> to trial .
__label__1	As ever I took of you .
__label__0	Instead of following the track of <NAME> , we have fallen on that of young Guinnard. ” This announcement was heard with profound silence .
__label__1	She falters , trembles , and puts her hand confusedly to her head .
__label__0	They felt an undefinable dread of the abyss !
__label__0	<NAME> ice everywhere , the route open , the road sure !
__label__1	I am not one of your players of music , stage actors , writers of books , or painters of pictures , who assume a station that the laws of their country don ’ t recognise .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> of <NAME> is not to be plundered and nobody suspected .
__label__0	But this obstacle could not stop <NAME> : he hurled himself against it with frightful violence .
__label__1	‘ It ’ s nearly eleven o ’ clock , <NAME> .
__label__1	And I am glad of another thing , and that is , that of course you know you may depend upon my keeping it and always so far deserving it .
__label__1	<NAME> dear ! ’ <NAME> stood for a moment , immovable .
__label__1	‘ Ve thought ve should ha ’ been obliged to strait-veskit him last night ; he ’ s been a-ravin ’ all day ; and he says if he can ’ t see you afore to-morrow night ’ s over , he vishes he may be somethin ’ unpleasanted if he don ’ t drownd hisself. ’ ‘ Oh , no , no , <NAME> ! ’ said <NAME> , clasping her hands .
__label__0	returned <NAME> , with so piteous an emotion that the old man seemed to return to the world of the living .
__label__1	“ It depends upon how you dewelop your talents .
__label__1	I know this is a confidence , ” she modestly said , after a little hesitation , and in earnest tears , “ I know you would say this to no one else .
__label__1	This some one was the dolls ’ dressmaker , with a little basket on her arm , and her crutch stick in her hand .
__label__0	He made the captain sit down on his stool , and inquired solicitously for the various Englishmen he had known on the former voyage .
__label__0	In leaving this pearl hidden in the mantle of the tridacne he was allowing it to grow slowly .
__label__1	The business will get rather complicated if I ’ ve many more customers .
__label__1	Three are to meet at the gatehouse to-night .
__label__0	<NAME> faith , and let my device be yours -- ‘ Excelsior ! ’ ” “ ‘ Excelsior ’ be it then , ” said the sportsman , who did not understand a word of <NAME> .
__label__0	`` What will you do then ? ''
__label__0	Soon hunting for game became more easy and its results more abundant .
__label__1	While extinguishing the candles , <NAME> , quite as a matter of course took up the glass from which that honest gentleman had drunk , and coolly tossed it under the grate , where it fell shivering into fragments .
__label__0	My uncle played a regular accompaniment to my gestures and words .
__label__1	‘ My friend and partner , Mr Venus , gives me to understand , ’ remarked that man of might , addressing him , ‘ that you are aware of our power over you .
__label__0	Its very memory , even now , makes my soul shudder , and my blood run cold .
__label__0	He went on , though often almost despairingly , through bogs and rivers , and across mountains , till he had traversed the whole of the uninhabited part of the continent , where only a few bold travelers have ventured ; and at last , in an exhausted and all but dying condition , he reached the hospitable dwelling of <NAME> ’ Moore , where he said he had found a happy home in exchange for his labor .
__label__0	We have passed the point at which the projectile would have stopped if its speed had only been 12,000 yards at starting .
__label__0	The child shook its head and made no reply .
__label__0	This water at first spread a smell like soup , which soon changed into a strong odor of sulphur .
__label__1	“ I beg your pardon , <NAME> Jaggers. ” “ Halloa ! ” said he , facing round , “ what 's the matter ? ” “ I wish to be quite right , <NAME> , and to keep to your directions ; so I thought I had better ask .
__label__0	At dawn next morning , all the slumberers started to their feet and rushed to the shore , shouting “ <NAME> , hurrah ! ” as <NAME> <NAME> ’ s loud cry , “ The <NAME> , the <NAME> ! ” broke upon his ear .
__label__1	`` That they are what they are , do not blame me ! ''
__label__1	If you ’ re going there , look into the theatre , and see how that ’ ll tell. ’ <NAME> promised to do so , if he could , and drawing a chair near the fire , fell into conversation with the manager at once .
__label__0	A luminous ceiling , decorated with light arabesques , shed a soft clear light over all the marvels accumulated in this museum .
__label__1	‘ I am delighted to hear it .
__label__0	Had the sealing-master been crushed to death in the narrow part of the hold where he was shut up ?
__label__1	said the nurse , picking up the cork of the green bottle , which had fallen out on the pillow , as she stooped to take up the child .
__label__1	‘ I like your conversation much .
__label__1	This light in hand young <NAME> knew perfectly that it was not .
__label__0	But it was to be supposed that this direction changed beyond that point , and that the <NAME> continued to the north-west , towards the spurs of <NAME> , among which the river rose .
__label__0	It was only too easy to recognize the letters of two names , arranged in two lines , thus : The <NAME> !
__label__0	The sea became gradually calmer .
__label__1	The mean man had , of course , got the better of the generous man .
__label__1	But really , when I hear it remarked in several companies , and in very good company , that however worthy of a foreigner , it is not worthy of the spirit of an Englishman to remain in the <NAME> when the glorious liberties of his island home admit of his removal to the <NAME> , I thought I would depart from the narrow professional line marked out to me , and mention it .
__label__1	I call her probably the very worst woman that ever lived in the world , except my drunken grandmother .
__label__0	`` Do you know any who belong to the latter category ? ''
__label__1	The rolling wheels were noiseless , and the sharp ring and clatter of the horses ’ hoofs , became a dull , muffled tramp .
__label__0	They expected unforseen incidents , and new phenomena ; and nothing would have astonished them in the frame of mind they then were in .
__label__1	But you wouldn ’ t have had the whole weight of any uncomfortable secrets if she had been with you , because she would have known how to relieve you of ‘ em , and I don ’ t. ’ ‘ Yes , yes , you do , ’ returned the Instrument-maker .
__label__0	It produces water-cresses , purslain , sorrels , turnips , and <NAME> radishes in abundance , as well as oats and clover .
__label__1	But , I said to <NAME> that , before I could go abroad , I must see both <NAME> and <NAME> .
__label__1	She felt unwilling , almost unable , to go on to her own chamber ; and turning into the drawing-rooms , where the clouded moon was shining through the blinds , looked out into the empty streets .
__label__0	First of all he made a thorough survey of <NAME> , their present fortress ; not for the purpose of defence , but of escape .
__label__0	Still , not a single resort for refuge did the inaccessible shore present .
__label__1	'Why , ' whispered <NAME> , 'as you cross the lawn -- ' 'Yes ? '
__label__1	‘ But , <NAME> , my dear friend , ’ said <NAME> , suddenly recovering his gravity , and drawing the great man ’ s great man into a <NAME> , by the lappel of his coat ; ‘ you must persuade the <NAME> to see me , and my client here. ’ ‘ Come , come , ’ said the clerk , ‘ that ’ s not bad either .
__label__1	Here is my little woman ! ''
__label__0	The different stock were kept apart , for wild sheep and bullocks would not have got on together at all .
__label__1	“ You know that I am always with him to the full extent of the time allowed , and that I should be with him all day long , if I could .
__label__0	Buried in recollection , or lost in thought , or magnetized by the bright Sun , they seemed to be half asleep while steeping their limbs in his vitalizing beams .
__label__1	‘ If you was to take and show that man the buoy at the <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> in the same tone , ‘ and ask him his opinion of it , <NAME> ’ r , he ’ d give you an opinion that was no more like that buoy than your Uncle ’ s buttons are .
__label__1	This is the most I consider possible .
__label__0	<NAME> thou not but a tool in my hands ? ''
__label__0	Instead of the rudimentary trilobites , I perceived the remains of a more perfect order .
__label__0	`` Thank you , <NAME> , '' said <NAME> ; `` the cold does not injure your memory , though it is decidedly on the advance .
__label__0	The vast plain on which it stands , although exceedingly fine , yields in verdure and fertility , and simple beauty of appearance , to the delightful country surrounding the less celebrated city of <NAME> .
__label__0	Our march had not been interrupted by this incident .
__label__0	A light breeze blew from the south .
__label__1	It ’ s some time since I was articled , but the payment of that hundred pounds was a great pull .
__label__0	In consequence of the intense cold , their fingers felt as if burned when they touched the rounds .
__label__0	“ But have we still far to go to the northward ? ” “ One hundred and fifty miles at <NAME> ” “ In that case , ” said <NAME> , “ I ’ ll turn in and sleep a bit. ” “ Sleep , sir ; sleep ! ” urged <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ The Helter-Skelter Plate at the races , child -- the plate that was run for on the second day. ’ ‘ On the second day , ma ’ am ? ’ ‘ Second day !
__label__1	If two angels could be concerned in it , I believe it would change their nature . ''
__label__0	I know he has had no appetite , because his words stick in his inside , and it would take a very clever devil to drag even one out of him . ''
__label__1	<NAME> ’ t let her come here , <NAME> ! ’ which was a corruption of <NAME> .
__label__1	I know too much about it , sir .
__label__0	On the 4th December , <NAME> sighted an island completely overgrown with vegetation .
__label__1	They were yet in the ardour of their work , when the child , raising her head from the ground over which she bent , observed that the bachelor was sitting on the stile close by , watching them in silence .
__label__1	If <NAME> were in her worst , I intensified it .
__label__0	She was the cause of the disaster !
__label__0	The weather , which had hitherto been fine , broke up , and , the wind becoming violent , it was necessary to continue the course following the forty-sixth parallel .
__label__1	`` I pouring out of window !
__label__1	To an unfortunate bachelor of a fellow who has lived alone all his life , you know , it ’ s positively delicious .
__label__1	And besides , it was not a long-considered step .
__label__1	Why have I alluded to it ?
__label__1	‘ How ? ’ was <NAME> ’ s inquiry , in a low and slow voice , after a silence .
__label__0	In May , 1801 , <NAME> , still accompanied by the faithful <NAME> , embarked at <NAME> , whence he proposed going first to <NAME> de <NAME> , and then to the lofty plains of <NAME> .
__label__1	The top shelf in the right-hand corner -- oh ! '
__label__1	It said , `` What the de-vil are you crying for ? ''
__label__0	From a <NAME> print engraved by <NAME> , vol .
__label__1	Never had visitors a more hospitable reception .
__label__0	Here <NAME> , accompanied by <NAME> Maston—a very good portrait—and <NAME> , descended in a balloon on the point in question , and , after unheard-of dangers , succeeded in capturing a lump of coal weighing half a pound , which was all the circumpolar deposit contained .
__label__1	Here one of you boys , carry that show into the barn .
__label__1	So little did I know of the world !
__label__1	‘ <NAME> us all aboot it , mun ; coom , quick ! ’ Although he could not keep pace with <NAME> ’ s impatience , Mr Squeers related the lucky chance by which <NAME> had fallen into his hands , as quickly as he could , and , except when he was interrupted by the admiring remarks of his auditors , paused not in the recital until he had brought it to an end .
__label__1	Will you take no counsel with me ?
__label__0	Three parts of this day I spent on the platform .
__label__1	`` Draw off a bit here , <NAME> , '' says <NAME> as a kind of shabby palanquin is borne towards them , surrounded by a noisy crowd .
__label__1	‘ I feel , my dear , ’ said <NAME> , quite amazing herself by the business-like manner in which she was getting on , ‘ that the subject must be a painful one to you , but I am mixed up in it also ; for -- I don ’ t know whether you may know it or suspect it -- I am the willed-away girl who was to have been married to the unfortunate gentleman , if he had been pleased to approve of me .
__label__0	This proposal was agreed to , and <NAME> and <NAME> prepared to start immediately .
__label__0	She related that a native who had agreed to exchange a wooden bolster for a knife , was shot by an officer because he wanted to take back his merchandise when he had been paid for it .
__label__0	The wagon was put up at the <NAME> .
__label__0	The moon and the earth were nothing but gaseous masses originally .
__label__1	Give us ’ old. ’ A shilling passes ; and , in that spirit of confidence which should pervade all business transactions between principals of honour , this piece of business is considered done .
__label__1	‘ She ’ s got hold o ’ some inwention for grown-up people being born again , <NAME> -- the new birth , I think they calls it .
__label__0	But she dared not , and she did well .
__label__0	He soon perceived that the travelers whose shouts he had heard were at no great distance .
__label__1	His face was a queer , good-tempered , crooked-featured piece of workmanship , ornamented with a couple of eyes that must have worn a very joyous expression at one time , for they sparkled yet .
__label__1	`` So I am told , sir , '' returned <NAME> , still musing and looking on the ground .
__label__1	If I were , or could be , in your place , I should be satisfied of that .
__label__0	The colonists at first thought the island was rent asunder , and rushed out of <NAME> .
__label__1	'If your inclinations chime with your sense of duty -- ' <NAME> began .
__label__0	“ It is a catastrophe that may have very serious consequences .
__label__0	It had followed him from <NAME> , and had come by the <NAME> , on which steamer he himself was supposed to be .
__label__0	`` While wintering there , <NAME> 's officers explored all the neighboring coasts : <NAME> , <NAME> 's <NAME> ; <NAME> , <NAME> 's <NAME> , to the south ; and <NAME> , <NAME> , to the north .
__label__1	‘ A schooner , from <NAME> or <NAME> , laden with fruit and wine .
__label__1	I begged <NAME> to be comforted , for ( as he said ) we had ever been the best of friends , and ( as I said ) we ever would be so .
__label__0	But taking the different densities into consideration , it was easy to reckon that this point would be situated at 47/60ths of the whole journey , _i.e._ , at 78,514 leagues from the earth .
__label__0	From thence we looked upon a vast sea which , towards the north , distinctly traced its boundary line upon the sky .
__label__1	His pockets were as full of it as his head .
__label__1	She simpered a little , affected extreme vexation and hesitation , and at last arrived at the conclusion that she supposed she must go .
__label__0	There is a reason for everything unaccountable which has happened here , and that reason I shall discover .
__label__1	If you please , miss , I am a little present with his love , and it was all done for the love of you .
__label__0	The feathered tribes of the island were all represented -- tetras , jacamars , pheasants , lories , as well as the chattering cockatoos , parrots , and paroquets .
__label__0	However , before returning to the dockyard , <NAME> conceived the idea of fabricating certain machines , which greatly excited the curiosity of his companions .
__label__1	Not many ; but though they would appear nothing , if I thought of other things , they seem a long , long time , when I think of him .
__label__1	‘ He said about an hour , ’ replied <NAME> -- politely of course , but without any indication of being stricken to the heart by <NAME> ’ s charms .
__label__1	It would suit ( he considers ) a young bride , to perfection ; especially if of a rather diminutive style of beauty .
__label__1	Stay. ’ He hastily put away a padlocked cash-box that was on the table , and substituted in its stead an empty purse .
__label__0	The expedition upon the bank of the river had been sent by the governor of <NAME> .
__label__0	`` Wait a moment , and be as patient as <NAME> was .
__label__1	Moved by these considerations , a stout lady opened the proceedings by inquiring , with an air of great concern and sympathy , how Mr <NAME> was ; whereunto Mr Quilp ’ s wife ’ s mother replied sharply , ‘ Oh !
__label__1	‘ Yes ! ’ the Father of the <NAME> assented .
__label__1	‘ Nonsense ! ’ cried <NAME> -- somewhat resentful of the idea .
__label__1	‘ We have no <NAME> left , positively , ’ said <NAME> , advancing her shrivelled ear ; for Mr <NAME> was saying something to <NAME> .
__label__1	All day long , little <NAME> has cried for her , and asked me , over and over again , whether <NAME> ’ ly was wicked ?
__label__0	`` My friends , '' said the doctor , intervening for the best , `` come , a little calm , it can all settle itself .
__label__1	`` Ah , my <NAME> , I have sometimes thought -- forgive my being so free -- that YOU are not happy . ''
__label__0	What recollections of the past these names brought back to him !
__label__1	‘ <NAME> requires me to put perfect faith in him , and he shall not be disappointed. ’ She went up to <NAME> one day , to meet him , in order that they might make some purchases .
__label__1	Mr Feeder then gave him to understand that he would be expected to inform <NAME> and <NAME> , in superfine small-hand , that Mr P. Dombey would be happy to have the honour of waiting on them , in accordance with their polite invitation .
__label__0	<NAME> had complete command over himself .
__label__1	Let me first see that he is in visiting order . '
__label__0	He was perfectly contented and satisfied .
__label__0	They were , however , disappointed in their expectations .
__label__0	“ This little isle is just a paradise ! ” “ Yes , ” replied <NAME> , “ a paradise to these poor , shipwrecked fellows that <NAME> had pity on , but I am sorry that <NAME> was not an extensive and fertile island , with a river instead of a stream , and a port instead of a tiny bay exposed to the open sea. ” “ And why , captain ? ” asked <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Let me see , ’ said <NAME> , as they went along ; ‘ I have been , <NAME> , upon the honourable roll of solicitors of the <NAME> of <NAME> , and attorneys at <NAME> , five years ; and -- except gratuitously taking instructions , on an average once a fortnight , for the will of <NAME> who has nothing to leave -- I have had no scrap of business but this romantic business. ’ ‘ And I , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ have been “ called ” seven years , and have had no business at all , and never shall have any .
__label__0	The <NAME> went at a rapid pace .
__label__1	‘ I try to believe and hope so still .
__label__1	Mrs Gowan ’ s door was attended by a family servant of several years ’ standing , who had his own crow to pluck with the public concerning a situation in the Post-Office which he had been for some time expecting , and to which he was not yet appointed .
__label__0	Perhaps ours do not reach them . ''
__label__0	`` But it is very easy to set up a graphic communication with the earth . ''
__label__0	We must now leave the peninsula of the <NAME> for that of <NAME> , where we have to record the result of several interesting journeys .
__label__1	‘ Now , I may be wrong in my conclusions ; it is very likely that I am , but my individual impression is , that the gulf between my family and <NAME> may be traced to an apprehension , on the part of my family , that <NAME> would require pecuniary accommodation .
__label__1	No effort had been made to clean the room -- it seemed in its nature almost hopeless of being clean ; but the small waxen form from which so much solemnity diffused itself had been composed afresh , and washed , and neatly dressed in some fragments of white linen ; and on my handkerchief , which still covered the poor baby , a little bunch of sweet herbs had been laid by the same rough , scarred hands , so lightly , so tenderly !
__label__0	A robber does n't quite like to leave traces of his flight behind him ; and , besides , he is not obliged to have his passport countersigned . ''
__label__1	I will not sit here , and hear such comparisons made. ’ With that she stalked out , and made the door bang after her .
__label__1	‘ Bof -- fin ! ’ ‘ Yes , <NAME> , ’ he answered , coming out of a fit of abstraction , with a sigh .
__label__0	“ The convicts passed over , but -- ” “ But what ? ” said <NAME> , who foreboded some new misfortune .
__label__0	Perhaps I was never to know who he was , from whence he came , or where he was going to , but I saw the man move , and apart from the _savant_ .
__label__1	There was a pause , during which , <NAME> , who had covered her face with one hand , gave free vent to her tears .
__label__0	The audience , panting , all in a heat , gesticulates and howls .
__label__0	But <NAME> 's calculations were in their turn corrected by the observations of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and others ; but it was reserved for the labors of <NAME> and <NAME> finally to solve the question .
__label__0	He could not land , as all the harbours were blocked up with ice , and he was obliged to make for <NAME> del Fuego .
__label__1	She had nothing for it now , therefore , but to run after the chaise , and to call to Mr Abel to stop .
__label__1	‘ And I never , ’ added <NAME> , ‘ was more delighted in my life than to observe last night , my dear , that your good sense had already told you this. ’ With which sentiment , and various hints of the pleasure she derived from the knowledge that her daughter inherited so large an instalment of her own excellent sense and discretion ( to nearly the full measure of which she might hope , with care , to succeed in time ) , Mrs. <NAME> concluded a very long and rather illegible letter .
__label__1	Sure enough , before long the pony came trotting round the corner of the street , looking as obstinate as pony might , and picking his steps as if he were spying about for the cleanest places , and would by no means dirty his feet or hurry himself inconveniently .
__label__1	But look where he will , he still beholds him close to the opposite houses , making his way with his wary hand from brick to brick and from door to door , and often , as he creeps along , glancing over at him watchfully .
__label__0	Such a shot , the honour of which belonged to his dear boy .
__label__1	As it extorted nothing from that gentleman but a smile , the old lady tossed her head , and smoothed down her apron preparatory to another speech , when she was stopped by <NAME> .
__label__1	They are nothing but good to me .
__label__1	They were all silent for a long while .
__label__0	`` <NAME> , by the help of <NAME> , I will bring your lover back to you ! ''
__label__0	If the pirates continued to attack them in this way , if they renewed their attempt to land by means of a boat , they could be destroyed one by one .
__label__1	But I -- but I wish you had not watched me. ’ He understood the emotion with which she said it , to arise in her father ’ s behalf ; and he respected it , and was silent .
__label__1	I fancied that I could detect in his manner a consciousness of this , and a purpose of always holding her in suspense .
__label__1	<NAME> may complain , but if <NAME> grumbles by so much as a word -- oh dear , down with him , down with him directly .
__label__1	'The game of that is , that they always leave it open with a catch , so that the dog , who 's got a bed in here , may walk up and down the passage when he feels wakeful .
__label__1	‘ And yesterday too , master. ’ ‘ Dear me , you ’ ve had a deal of trouble .
__label__1	Doors were slamming violently , lamps were flickering or blown out , signs were rocking in their frames , the water of the kennels , wind-dispersed , flew about in drops like rain .
__label__0	It was almost too much happiness to be true .
__label__1	He seems fully determined to drop down ; don ’ t he ? ’ Mr <NAME> opined that such was clearly his intention .
__label__1	`` Oh , that 's not quite the worst of it , <NAME> dear ! ''
__label__1	And <NAME> at the door , inquiring who is within .
__label__1	‘ How do you find yourself arter it , my love ? ’ ‘ <NAME> ! ’ exclaimed Mrs. Weller .
__label__1	<NAME> pointed to the empty glass , as though it were a sufficient refutation of the charge , and briefly said that he was going downstairs to supper .
__label__1	You have long had a good model before you , in your cousin <NAME> .
__label__1	`` In fact , <NAME> , '' proceeds <NAME> , `` it is not holding up a good model for imitation to ask the officer any such questions as you have put to him .
__label__0	`` And without the delay of a single day , '' added <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> became aware that the huge disc that had been looming through the clouds after the shock was the form of the retreating earth , to the proximity of which the one high tide they had experienced was also to be attributed .
__label__1	I speak , ’ said Mrs. Micawber , ‘ as a female , necessarily ; but I have always been of opinion that <NAME> possesses what I have heard my papa call , when I lived at home , the judicial mind ; and I hope <NAME> is now entering on a field where that mind will develop itself , and take a commanding station. ’ I quite believe that <NAME> saw himself , in his judicial mind ’ s eye , on the woolsack .
__label__0	And was all danger over ?
__label__1	If I had taken ten times as many glasses of wine as I had , I should have known that he never had stood in that relation towards me , and should in my heart of hearts have repudiated the idea .
__label__0	That man is to be pitied the most who can not wean himself from gloomy reflections by actual work , or some practical pursuit .
__label__1	‘ When will <NAME> be back , sir ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> flew swiftly by , and summer came .
__label__0	`` We have much poorer luck , '' answered <NAME> ; `` if we could only get enough bear 's meat , we would do very well . ''
__label__1	I wish you would forget it. ” “ I forgot it long ago. ” “ Fashion of speech again !
__label__1	I never doubted until within this hour or two , that he had , or could have such a paper .
__label__0	On this day the two lovers -- one might say , the two betrothed -- were seated upon the verdant bank .
__label__1	Either the master or the manner of this remark , which was made very ruefully , delighted <NAME> so much , that his consequent shout of laughter roused the Jew from his reverie , and induced him to inquire what was the matter .
__label__0	<NAME> is at the top of the rock , where you see those very green trees .
__label__0	The keel , of good oak , measured 110 feet in length , this allowing a width of five-and-twenty feet to the midship beam .
__label__1	<NAME> , ’ adds <NAME> , ‘ can exceed their good-humour .
__label__1	really I can ’ t blame you , <NAME> , ’ says <NAME> , with frankness .
__label__1	<NAME> and still eastward through the stale streets he takes his way , until he reaches his destination : a miserable court , specially miserable among many such .
__label__0	At first <NAME> bore his captivity with resignation , which may have been partly due to <NAME> 's doing all he could to soothe him , at least by words .
__label__1	‘ I want to speak to you , who spoke to me this morning , ’ said <NAME> , pointing out with his finger the man whom he addressed .
__label__1	‘ Oh ! ’ said <NAME> , catching him a smart box on the ear .
__label__1	My low tap at the door was answered by <NAME> .
__label__1	And you can come down from a balloon in a parach -- no you can ’ t though .
__label__1	‘ I play my game to the end in spite of words ; and Death of my Body and Death of my Soul !
__label__0	His clothes were powerless to protect him .
__label__1	Mr Lightwood , here has been a wicked cruel murder .
__label__1	‘ I augur all sort of good from your sensible decision. ’ ‘ <NAME> , you do us a great deal of honour , ’ he rejoined .
__label__1	I know I might keep it off if I only tried hard enough , and sometimes I do try hard enough , and at other times I don ’ t and won ’ t .
__label__1	This capital of the state of <NAME> is a bustling , busy town , with a great deal of traffic of various kinds , and in particular of water commerce .
__label__0	Our road grew lighter and lighter .
__label__0	They even go so far as to poison the fountains that the birds generally drink from .
__label__1	Then followed the recognition of <NAME> , and then the greeting of <NAME> , and then that of Mr Pluck , and finally , to complete the young lady ’ s mortification , she was compelled at Mrs. Wititterly ’ s request to perform the ceremony of introducing the odious persons , whom she regarded with the utmost indignation and abhorrence .
__label__0	62 degrees 20 minutes and W. long .
__label__1	It being Saturday night , I found the landlord looking rather grimly at these records ; but as my business was with <NAME> and not with him , I merely wished him good evening , and passed into the common room at the end of the passage , where there was a bright large kitchen fire , and where <NAME> was smoking his pipe in company with <NAME> and a stranger .
__label__0	`` You are right , sir , '' replied <NAME> ; `` the discussion has become irregular .
__label__0	Here round _ “ tucumas , ” _ or ficuses , capriciously twisted like centenarian olive-trees , and of which <NAME> had fifty-four varieties ; here round the kinds of euphorbias , which produce caoutchouc , _ “ gualtes , ” _ noble palm-trees , with slender , graceful , and glossy stems ; and cacao-trees , which shoot up of their own accord on the banks of the <NAME> and its tributaries , having different melastomas , some with red flowers and others ornamented with panicles of whitish berries .
__label__0	There they seated themselves in the stern , and without preamble , <NAME> , lowering her voice to be heard by him alone , began : “ <NAME> , I am the daughter of an exile .
__label__1	Let us draw further back .
__label__0	`` <NAME> , '' replied <NAME> , after a moment 's reflection , `` I do not know what the object it , but I do know why it maintains our level . ''
__label__0	The frigate approached the cetacean .
__label__1	Do n't be afraid of it . ''
__label__1	'Yes , ' said <NAME> , recoiling a few steps , as if to be nearer assistance in case she should require it .
__label__1	And if the time should come when I can stretch out a hand to render the least service to one whom it is better not to name even here , I will not fail to do it for her dear daughter 's sake . ''
__label__1	He shall not do it again , if I can help it ; I ’ ll expose him !
__label__1	This fact is interesting , as illustrating the secret connection and sympathy which always exist between great minds .
__label__0	<NAME> to throw some light upon the mystery , <NAME> hurriedly made his way through the oleander bushes that overhung the shore , took up some water in the hollow of his hand , and carried it to his lips .
__label__1	‘ You don ’ t know who he is !
__label__1	When she paid the coachman she took her money out of a hard steel purse , and she kept the purse in a very jail of a bag which hung upon her arm by a heavy chain , and shut up like a bite .
__label__0	<NAME> , armed with a gun , lightly crossed the ledge which sheltered them .
__label__1	' I 'll fetch him directly , ' said Mrs. Mann , leaving the room for that purpose .
__label__1	You have such a gentle nature , and you are always right. ’ ‘ You talk , ’ said <NAME> , breaking into a pleasant laugh , as she sat at work , ‘ as if I were the late <NAME> Larkins. ’ ‘ Come !
__label__0	The <NAME> entered <NAME> roadstead upon the 23rd of March , and three days later the vast collection of natural curiosities was landed .
__label__1	‘ Not a word , ’ resumed <NAME> , ‘ and never will be .
__label__1	‘ At any rate I ’ m going .
__label__0	The first man who speaks will have to reckon with me ! ''
__label__1	‘ And now here ’ s my poor fellow , ’ Mrs <NAME> pursued , ‘ receiving notice that he is to hold himself in expectation of a baby , and all the expenses attendant on such an addition to his family !
__label__1	‘ So you said just now , my dear , ’ replied <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Think of me. ’ ‘ Tell me how <NAME> to think of you , <NAME> , and you ’ ll change me altogether. ’ ‘ I don ’ t mean in that way .
__label__0	It was then possible to land , and , picking up such of the enemy 's weapons as were scattered about , the victors contented themselves with towing away one of their pirogues and destroying the others . ''
__label__1	‘ Forgive ME ! ’ For there were tears in her eyes , and they were prettier in his sight ( though they smote him on the heart rather reproachfully too ) than any other glitter in the world .
__label__0	`` That 's agreed , '' replied <NAME> , laughing and blushing at the same time .
__label__1	Mr <NAME> had uncovered on looking in at the door , and remained so .
__label__0	exclaimed <NAME> , `` that this vessel will be difficult to get afloat again . ''
__label__0	The boatswain had just struck six bells .
__label__1	‘ Look at him , ’ cries <NAME> , stretching out his hand admiringly and tenderly , though rallyingly too .
__label__1	So , with people lounging and lying wherever shade was , with but little hum of tongues or barking of dogs , with occasional jangling of discordant church bells and rattling of vicious drums , <NAME> , a fact to be strongly smelt and tasted , lay broiling in the sun one day .
__label__0	They were almost famished : fortunately , the larder was not far off , and <NAME> was noted for being an expeditious cook .
__label__1	In an official manager of these displays much celebrated for his platform tactics , <NAME> recognised ( in a suit of black ) the counterpart of a deceased benefactor of his species , an eminent public character , once known to fame as Frosty-faced Fogo , who in days of yore superintended the formation of the magic circle with the ropes and stakes .
__label__1	I have no idea whether this took any time .
__label__0	There was no land within 100 miles .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> took no pains to conceal his implacable dislike of <NAME> , yet he never referred it , however distantly , to such a source .
__label__1	Little Em ’ ly had overcome her shyness , and was sitting by my side upon the lowest and least of the lockers , which was just large enough for us two , and just fitted into the chimney corner .
__label__1	<NAME> stands amazed in the disk of light , like a ragged figure in a magic-lantern , trembling to think that he has offended against the law in not having moved on far enough .
__label__1	‘ Of <NAME> and <NAME> , in the wine trade , ’ he replied .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> had been despatched to make various preliminary inquiries , with the view of finding out some captain or other who wanted a cabin-boy without any friends ; and was returning to the workhouse to communicate the result of his mission ; when he encountered at the gate , no less a person than <NAME> , the parochial undertaker .
__label__1	Here ’ s <NAME> ! ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	Suddenly he stood still , and asked <NAME> point-blank if he knew where she was ?
__label__0	“ Did you not weep ? ” “ Yes. ” “ I should have wept too .
__label__0	`` Well , what do you think of that ? ''
__label__0	Besides his telephone , each reporter , as the reader is aware , has in front of him a set of commutators , which enable him to communicate with any desired telephotic line .
__label__0	`` Well , where are you going to put the mine ? ''
__label__0	The last gleams of twilight were melting into night .
__label__1	A double tier of bedroom galleries , with old clumsy balustrades , ran round two sides of the straggling area , and a double row of bells to correspond , sheltered from the weather by a little sloping roof , hung over the door leading to the bar and coffee-room .
__label__1	Much as if one nostril was caught up with a horse-hair and a little fish-hook .
__label__1	said the Jew , when they had regained the passage .
__label__1	‘ Did I indeed , sir ? ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	`` I am to remain on this gaudy platform on which my miserable deception has been so long acted , and it is to fall beneath me when you give the signal ? ''
__label__1	‘ Then , as we understand each other , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ will you allow me to ask you whether you consider me a highly virtuous , exemplary , and well-conducted man in private life ; and whether , as a person whose business it is to take charge of youth , you place the strongest confidence in my unimpeachable integrity , liberality , religious principles , and ability ? ’ ‘ Certainly I do , ’ replied the father-in-law , reciprocating the schoolmaster ’ s grin .
__label__1	‘ And you can hardly think , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ having experience of what we see , in the <NAME> here , every day , of the various unaccountable and negligent proceedings of men , in respect of their testamentary arrangements -- of all subjects , the one on which perhaps the strangest revelations of human inconsistency are to be met with -- but that mine are made ? ’ I inclined my head in acquiescence .
__label__1	'Not too strong , ' replied <NAME> , with a delicate cough .
__label__1	It was not that the wind swept all the brawlers into places of shelter , as it had swept the hail still lingering in heaps wherever there was refuge for it ; but that it seemed as if the streets were absorbed by the sky , and the night were all in the air .
__label__1	He is such a ridiculous fellow ! ''
__label__0	“ You see then , friend , ” he added , “ that it is a straight course .
__label__0	The course was continued to the south , and <NAME> 's perseverance was soon rewarded by the appearance of land , to which he gave the name of <NAME> Circumcision .
__label__1	The countenance of <NAME> fell , and anxiety overspread his features .
__label__1	<NAME> must have irritated him , -- made faces at him .
__label__1	This consideration was very potent in many quarters , but nowhere more so than among the young clerks and partners who had never been in the slightest danger of overdoing it .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> returned to <NAME> in the year 1849 .
__label__1	There ’ s not a <NAME> in this town , sir , man , woman , or child , but has one ultimate object in life .
__label__1	Without a word , without a shadow on the fire of her bright eye , without abatement of her awful smile , she looked on Mr Dombey to the last , in moving to the door ; and left him .
__label__0	<NAME> as the thing seems , a noise -- a real noise , such as the town had certainly not heard since the taking of the donjon by the Spaniards in 1513 -- terrible noise , awoke the long-dormant echoes of the venerable <NAME> mansion .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> as ever. ’ ‘ And your mother , and the clergyman , and all of ‘ em ? ’ ‘ Quite well. ’ ‘ Where , ’ said <NAME> , with an effort -- ‘ where is -- _she_ , <NAME> ? ’ and he turned away his head , and covered his eyes with his hand .
__label__0	The gas furnished the requisite heat , and the provision chest supplied the materials for their first repast .
__label__0	At the same time with the gusts of wind a noise was heard beneath the frozen soil ; icebergs , broken from the promontory , dashed away noisily , and fell upon one another ; the wind blew with such violence that it seemed sometimes as if the whole house moved from its foundation ; phosphorescent lights , inexplicable in that latitude , flashed across the whirlwinds of the snow .
__label__1	‘ Well , will you leave a message , <NAME> , or will you call again ? ’ ‘ Ask him to be so kind as to leave out word what has been done in my business , ’ said the man ; ‘ for <NAME> ’ s sake don ’ t neglect it , <NAME> Lowten. ’ ‘ No , no ; I won ’ t forget it , ’ replied the clerk .
__label__1	A four-oared galley hovering about in so unusual a way as to attract this notice was an ugly circumstance that I could not get rid of .
__label__1	But she seemed to be a good sort of fellow , and showed a high regard for the <NAME> .
__label__0	Is it the product of the melting of these snows ?
__label__1	‘ You are unusually mysterious tonight. ’ ‘ Cold , perhaps , ’ returned <NAME> ; ‘ cold , perhaps .
__label__1	Then , the miserable bakers ' shops were beset by long files of them , patiently waiting to buy bad bread ; and while they waited with stomachs faint and empty , they beguiled the time by embracing one another on the triumphs of the day , and achieving them again in gossip .
__label__1	At all events , I hope I have something impressible within me , which feels—deeply feels—the disinterestedness of your painfully laying your inner self bare , as a warning to me. ’ <NAME> ’ s steadiness of face and figure becomes so marvellous that his breathing seems to have stopped .
__label__1	Excuse me , but you do seem a little tired , and unless you ’ re very anxious to get on -- ’ ‘ Yes , yes , we are , ’ returned the old man fretfully .
__label__1	This is the offer you mentioned , sir ? ’ ‘ Yes .
__label__0	At this time <NAME> was a large community , of some thousand Indians capable of bearing arms , who recognized the authority of the missionaries of the different tribes .
__label__0	I was , therefore , in constant communication with , at all events the letters of , <NAME> , <NAME> , and other great men .
__label__1	`` I thank you for your preparation , '' returns <NAME> after a silence , without moving hand , foot , or feature , `` which I hope is not necessary ; though I give it credit for being well intended .
__label__1	No speck , nor spot , nor spatter soiled the purity of any of <NAME> ’ s household gods , large , small , or middle-sized .
__label__1	‘ That , ’ replied <NAME> , ‘ that , I think , can be got over. ’ ‘ But the salary is so small , and it is such a long way off , uncle ! ’ faltered <NAME> .
__label__1	The most is made , however , of the means it possesses , and it is as well regulated as such a place can be .
__label__1	No one can assist you ; you are to work it out for yourselves .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> 's head had been crushed against the roof , but , though recovery seemed hopeless , they laid the body on a soft cushion , and soon had the satisfaction of hearing it give vent to a slight sigh .
__label__0	It ran as follows : `` After examining one by one the different theories , rejecting all other suggestions , it becomes necessary to admit the existence of a marine animal of enormous power .
__label__1	It seemed to fill to inconvenience the little bar in which the widow landlady and her two daughters received him ; it was much too big for the narrow wainscoted room with a bagatelle-board in it , that was first proposed for his reception ; it perfectly swamped the little private holiday sitting-room of the family , which was finally given up to him .
__label__1	The figures in this boat were those of a strong man with ragged grizzled hair and a sun-browned face , and a dark girl of nineteen or twenty , sufficiently like him to be recognizable as his daughter .
__label__1	“ Hah ! ” said Mrs. <NAME> , restoring <NAME> to his station .
__label__0	The night passed quietly , for the breeze died away with the last light of day , and only rose again with the first streaks of dawn .
__label__0	First they ate “ hotchpotch , ” soup with the meat swimming in capital broth .
__label__0	As the gypsy took two or three steps forward , and was about to interrogate <NAME> more closely , the door of the cottage opened .
__label__0	And <NAME> left her , for the tears were also welling up in his eyes and witnessing against the words of hope to which he had just given utterance .
__label__0	If <NAME> 's <NAME> is closed , <NAME> is not , to the west of <NAME> 's <NAME> ; in my opinion , we ought to go up this sound as far as <NAME> , and thence to <NAME> .
__label__0	`` An age , a cycle , according to the use you make of them .
__label__0	<NAME> ’ s arrangements were made , and on this evening a note fell from the top of the earthworks into <NAME> ’ s hands .
__label__1	‘ What is the matter ? ’ asked her visitor .
__label__1	<NAME> compassion , such gentleness , as that with which she bent down weeping and put her hand upon the mother 's might have softened any mother 's heart that ever beat .
__label__1	Mr Headstone , I don ’ t say what you have got upon your conscience , for I don ’ t know .
__label__1	Up to this time , Mr <NAME> had transacted little or no business at his quarters in <NAME> , except in the sleeping line ; but now that he had become a fortune-teller , he was often closeted after midnight with Mr Rugg in his little front-parlour office , and even after those untimely hours , burnt tallow in his bed-room .
__label__1	Mr Boffin heard of you through a certain Mr Lightwood .
__label__1	If you only repose half as much confidence in me as I repose in you after what I 've experienced of you , that 'll do .
__label__0	“ I snatched it from Kara-Tete when he fell at your feet .
__label__0	While they were digging the house , the doctor happened to stumble upon a small stove which had not been injured by the explosion , and with a piece of chimney that could be easily repaired : the doctor carried it away in triumph .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> is no more a robber than I am a murderer . ''
__label__1	She wanted no strengthening in her firmness ; but if she had had need of any , she would have derived it from his kindling face .
__label__1	`` Why , I hear of her , <NAME> , '' replied <NAME> , `` through <NAME> , but I see very little of her .
__label__1	Not an ill wind , I hope ? ’ ‘ No , ’ replied my aunt .
__label__0	Who shakes the seam during tempestuous nights ?
__label__1	But it may be true. ” “ If it is -- ” <NAME> began , and stopped .
__label__1	They said no more , but sat apart ; the mother communing with her money ; the daughter with her thoughts ; the glance of each , shining in the gloom of the feebly lighted room .
__label__0	You go forward listlessly , often looking behind you !
__label__0	`` Under the circumstances , '' he said , `` I ought to neglect no precautions .
__label__0	Four days afterward , on the fourth of September , the order of discharge arrived .
__label__0	I too much feared the counteraction of disappointment .
__label__1	<NAME> ’ t I , <NAME> , my dear ?
__label__0	<NAME> had but few steps to go ; and , rushing upon the plank , he crossed it , and fell unconscious on the deck , just as the <NAME> was moving off .
__label__0	On board of a pirogue , with two companions only , <NAME> penetrated , with some Algonquins , to the <NAME> , and remained conqueror in a great battle fought on the borders of a lake which has received his name ; he then descended the river <NAME> , as far as the <NAME> .
__label__1	At last I rose to go to bed , much to the relief of the sleepy waiter , who had got the fidgets in his legs , and was twisting them , and hitting them , and putting them through all kinds of contortions in his small pantry .
__label__1	I can walk quite strongly .
__label__0	The night passed without any important change .
__label__0	`` We found , '' says the narrative , `` different houses where we could repair our sails , salt our provisions , construct two boats , lodge the naturalists and geographical engineers , and the governor kindly lent us his own for the establishment of our observatory .
__label__0	And in this condition of mind , over-excited by the succession of wonders continually passing before my eyes , I should not have been surprised to meet at the bottom of the sea one of those submarine towns of which <NAME> dreamed .
__label__0	On the 29th October , the <NAME> reached the north-eastern portion of <NAME> .
__label__1	We feared there must be something the matter , but he resolutely denies it. ’ ‘ No , no , ’ said <NAME> , colouring beneath <NAME> ’ s gaze ; ‘ there is really nothing .
__label__1	`` Oh , <NAME> , my dear , so much the worse , so much the worse ! ''
__label__0	The reporters ' items , just like the different stories and all the other component parts of the journal , are classified automatically according to an ingenious system , and reach the hearer in due succession .
__label__1	You will wear the green velvet jacket ? ’ ‘ No , no , ’ replied <NAME> .
__label__1	A drowsy city , <NAME> , whose inhabitants seem to suppose , with an inconsistency more strange than rare , that all its changes lie behind it , and that there are no more to come .
__label__1	Since leaving home , they had halted here and there for necessary refreshment , and had frequently been delayed , especially in the night time , by waiting for fresh horses .
__label__0	Then the <NAME> regions were purchased under the auctioneer ’ s hammer .
__label__0	It was necessary to reconnoitre the corral , in order to ascertain if it was occupied .
__label__0	<NAME> did not beg off , and recommenced our story .
__label__1	On further consideration , I remember that he tried hot roast pig and bottled ale as a cure for sea-sickness ; and that he took these remedies ( usually in bed ) day after day , with astonishing perseverance .
__label__1	<NAME> had given me his arm and was taking me away when <NAME> came up .
__label__1	And now , the grand chain riveted to the last link , the discreet automaton ceased , and the sixteen , two and two , took a walk among the furniture .
__label__1	She sends you her regard .
__label__1	The ground most commonly taken by these better men among the advocates of slavery , is this : ‘ It is a bad system ; and for myself I would willingly get rid of it , if I could ; most willingly .
__label__0	No man had ever been nearer acquiring this glory for himself and his country .
__label__1	Always think of me as quite an old man .
__label__0	It is quite possible that <NAME> 's reasoning is correct , and that I have lost my nine thousand dollars .
__label__0	cried the colonel ; `` it 's you who are going to play a spade ! ''
__label__1	`` Where what is left among us of deportment , '' he added , `` still lingers .
__label__0	A more suitable time was required for that question .
__label__1	'Yes , <NAME> , ' said <NAME> .
__label__0	[ Illustration ] From this moment the land grew lower , whence the doctor concluded that it did not extend very far to the north .
__label__1	<NAME> drew out the key , closed the door , locked it on the inside , took out the key again , and held it in his hand .
__label__0	On the north side of the peak was an immense mass of snow and ice ... . To the east lay the great plain , rising as it receded , until , in the distant horizon , it appeared to mingle with the sky . ''
__label__0	They are about fifty in number .
__label__0	Towards evening it approached the <NAME> group , the rough summits of which I recognised the following day .
__label__1	In respect of <NAME> ’ s <NAME> , the <NAME> ’ s parental and admiration knew no change .
__label__1	‘ It was you , I believe , that were wishing to see <NAME> ! ’ ‘ It was , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	My son -- my only son , <NAME> -- has been his brother ; Mrs. Squeers has been his mother , grandmother , aunt , -- ah !
__label__1	There was a christening party at the largest coffin-maker ’ s and a funeral hatchment had stopped some great improvements in the bravest mansion .
__label__1	In pursuance of my intention of referring to my own fictions only when their course should incidentally connect itself with the progress of my story , I do not enter on the aspirations , the delights , anxieties , and triumphs of my art .
__label__1	I ’ ll begin it. ’ ‘ You seem disappointed , ’ observed <NAME> .
__label__0	The maneuver would have been a difficult job for five men if the <NAME> had not carried a double yard , on the <NAME> plan .
__label__0	“ At length ! ” he said , over and over again , “ water !
__label__1	Do you recollect him ? ’ No .
__label__0	At first sight the ocean seemed lactified .
__label__1	I had on ’ y to think as she was found , and it was gone .
__label__1	It is accomplished at last , and he proceeds alone in quest of his adviser .
__label__1	Many of them came out to look after him , and to observe to one another , with great unctuousness , that he was ‘ pulled down by it. ’ Mrs Plornish and her father stood at the top of the steps at their own end , much depressed and shaking their heads .
__label__0	Could they enter any of its doors while the whole party of <NAME> was plunged in a drunken sleep , or was it safer to attempt to make a hole in the walls ?
__label__0	The colonists divided their work , and their arms never tired .
__label__1	Little Dorrit would have been glad to make her visit to Mrs Gowan , alone ; but as <NAME> , who had not yet recovered from her <NAME> ’ s protest , though it was four-and-twenty hours of age , pressingly offered her company , the two sisters stepped together into one of the gondolas under Mr <NAME> ’ s window , and , with the courier in attendance , were taken in high state to Mrs Gowan ’ s lodging .
__label__1	They had determined not to admire <NAME> ’ s picture .
__label__1	If it was his whim to surprise us , his whim succeeded .
__label__1	And now , to be defied and spurned , to be held up to her in the worst and most repulsive colours , to know that she was taught to hate and despise him : to feel that there was infection in his touch , and taint in his companionship -- to know all this , and to know that the mover of it all was that same boyish poor relation who had twitted him in their very first interview , and openly bearded and braved him since , wrought his quiet and stealthy malignity to such a pitch , that there was scarcely anything he would not have hazarded to gratify it , if he could have seen his way to some immediate retaliation .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> raised his eyes piously to the ceiling in thankfulness ; and , bringing them down again to the brim of the cup , lifted it to his nose .
__label__0	And if it is not objectionable to you , <NAME> , I would render myself again worthy of the reputation which I have acquired in these parts , the question of reis , and not that of conceit , being , you understand , the principal. ” “ Go on , then , friend , ” replied <NAME> laughingly ; “ but be quick !
__label__0	Your head is surrounded with bandages and poultices that must not be touched .
__label__0	Hence every man went back to his place .
__label__1	'It 's quite a cruelty , ' said <NAME> .
__label__0	`` Your dead sleep quietly , at least , <NAME> , out of the reach of sharks . ''
__label__1	But it ’ s not that ; oh , no , it ’ s not that. ’ ‘ How do you know it ’ s not that ? ’ said <NAME> , after a silence .
__label__1	He had not returned sooner , he replied , simply because he had no means of living in <NAME> , save those he had resigned ; whereas , in <NAME> , he lived by giving instruction in the <NAME> language and literature .
__label__0	He passed <NAME> and <NAME> and <NAME> 's <NAME> , opening out of <NAME> 's <NAME> , without examining them , the last named at so great a distance that he did not even recognize it .
__label__1	For then you know , <NAME> , you would always have the horse and cart to bring you over to see me , and could come for nothing , and be sure of coming. ’ ‘ The sense of the dear ! ’ cried <NAME> .
__label__1	'Because of <NAME> 's account of him , the said <NAME> . '
__label__1	I had been afraid until then to say a word about the play .
__label__0	They prostrated themselves before him ; they howled ; they felt him ; they became even annoyingly familiar ; but at the same time they had the consideration to offer him a superb banquet consisting of sour milk and rice pounded in honey .
__label__1	Have you any fresh <NAME> for my daughter , sir ? ’ <NAME> understood the tone of triumph in which this interrogatory was put ; but remembering the necessity of supporting his assumed character , produced a scrap of paper purporting to contain a list of some subjects for drawings which his employer desired to have executed ; and with which he had prepared himself in case of any such contingency .
__label__1	‘ For I don ’ t remember you. ’ ‘ It ’ s not at all likely you should .
__label__1	“ Ay ! ” returned the sergeant , “ two .
__label__1	And he and <NAME> led the way .
__label__1	But you have given me such a specimen of both , that I should be a fit subject for both if I remained silent respecting them .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , my dear friend , I am very sorry to see you here. ’ ‘ I am very sorry to be here , sir , ’ said <NAME> ; ‘ but your conduct , <NAME> , has rendered this deputation from your constituents imperatively necessary. ’ ‘ My conduct , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , looking round upon the deputation with gracious magnanimity -- ‘ my conduct has been , and ever will be , regulated by a sincere regard for the true and real interests of this great and happy country .
__label__0	When at last I came back to a sense of life and being , my face was wet , but wet , as I soon knew , with tears .
__label__1	“ Glasses round ! ” “ This other gentleman , ” observed <NAME> , by way of introducing <NAME> , “ is a gentleman that you would like to hear give it out .
__label__0	This was the dwelling-place of those races well known to us in <NAME> history ; the <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> .
__label__0	And the girdle of reeds which encircles them through which a pirogue can with difficulty make its way !
__label__1	Of the air with which old <NAME> , with his hat under his left arm ( the inside presented at the clergyman like a cannon ) and his eyes creasing themselves up into his wig , stood stiff and high-shouldered behind us bridesmaids during the ceremony , and afterwards saluted us , I could never say enough to do it justice .
__label__1	Two or three violins and a wind instrument from the Opera band reside within its precincts .
__label__0	`` I can understand , <NAME> , the delight of wandering about in the midst of such riches .
__label__1	`` I think you had better call me guardian , my dear . ''
__label__0	The productions of both appear to be the same , and there is an absence of brushwood in the forests of both .
__label__0	When <NAME> received this news , after giving way for a few moments to a very natural grief , pleading his great age and the different way in which he had behaved with regard to <NAME> and <NAME> when they were his prisoners , he recovered his calmness and awaited his death with a soldier 's courage .
__label__1	There are engagements to be met , this week , which would bring the catastrophe before many days were over , even if I would postpone it for a single day by going on for that space , secretly knowing what I know .
__label__1	‘ My name is <NAME> , ’ said the gentleman .
__label__0	[ Illustration : A soft voice said in his ear , `` Have good courage , uncle . '' ]
__label__0	Hitherto we have forgotten home too much , and those who are dear to us . ''
__label__1	The house stands , large and weather-proof , in the long dull street ; but it is a ruin , and the rats fly from it .
__label__0	“ Follow me , Kennedy. ” “ What do you wish , sir ? ” “ Let us alight .
__label__1	Would you be so good as look arter her , <NAME> , for a minute ? ’ Mrs. Gummidge nodded and disappeared .
__label__1	Now , if you stand there , refusing to give evidence , I 'll punish you for disrespect to the bench ; I will , by -- ' By what , or by whom , nobody knows , for the clerk and jailor coughed very loud , just at the right moment ; and the former dropped a heavy book upon the floor , thus preventing the word from being heard -- accidently , of course .
__label__1	‘ Yes. ’ ‘ Yes what ? ’ said the inexorable Wegg : ‘ I won ’ t take yes .
__label__0	Another puzzling problem and sadly bewildering to poor <NAME> , who had now almost lost his reason by attempting to clear up questions that were proving altogether too profound for his overworked brains .
__label__1	Ma can do it. ’ ‘ At any rate , my love , ’ said <NAME> , soothingly , ‘ that ’ s over. ’ ‘ Yes , it ’ s over , ’ returned <NAME> , ‘ but there ’ s nothing gained by that .
__label__1	‘ Not at your peril ? ’ ‘ No , <NAME> , ’ said Mr Boffin , shaking his head good-humouredly .
__label__1	and coming half across the room to meet me , kneeled down upon the ground and kissed me , and laid my head down on her bosom near the little creature that was nestling there , and put its hand to my lips .
__label__1	So long as their progress was confined to the streets of <NAME> , the facetious <NAME> kept his professional green spectacles on , and conducted himself with becoming steadiness and gravity of demeanour ; merely giving utterance to divers verbal witticisms for the exclusive behoof and entertainment of <NAME> .
__label__1	You heard him , but a little time ago .
__label__1	Through costly-coloured glass and paper-mended window , through cathedral dome and rotten crevice , it shed its equal ray .
__label__1	He has a yellow look in the spectral darkness of a candle that has guttered down until the whole length of its wick ( still burning ) has doubled over and left a tower of winding-sheet above it .
__label__0	of gold. ” <NAME> uttered an exclamation of surprise .
__label__0	But the first thing to do , when the weather is so cold , is to build a snow-house . ''
__label__0	At length he accosted <NAME> once more , and said -- “ And this DUNCAN -- where is she going ? ” “ To <NAME> , <NAME> , ” was the reply .
__label__1	The <NAME> Reverend the <NAME> will please to bear in mind that I have seen the world. ’ Here <NAME> gets a little behind the <NAME> , to inspect his coat-buttons .
__label__0	President <NAME> , the originator of the enterprise , was strongly encouraged in its feasibility by the astronomers of <NAME> , and took upon himself to provide all the means necessary to secure its success .
__label__0	But his successors in this country , more especially D'Entrecasteaux , discovered to their detriment that they did not preserve this quality .
__label__1	`` At a rough kind of fellow -- a sort of human hedgehog rolled up , '' said <NAME> , `` who is a baker in this neighbourhood and from whom we borrowed a couple of arm-chairs .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> , in his very curious work on <NAME> , tells us that in 1865 , only fifteen bales of _phornium_ were exported , that four years later the export amounted to the almost incredible number of 12,162 bales , and in 1870 to 32,820 bales , valued at 132,578_l_ .
__label__0	The engineer even observed that these barks had something strange in them , like those which the dog had uttered at the mouth of the well in <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> is talked of but war , and they speak of it , with a freedom which is astonishing , as having broken out between the <NAME> and the Vistula. ” The readers of the <NAME> would not fail to be as well informed as <NAME> ’ s “ cousin. ” But as <NAME> , seated at the left of the train , only saw one part of the country , which was hilly , without giving himself the trouble of looking at the right side , which was composed of wide plains , he added , with <NAME> assurance , “ Country mountainous between <NAME> and Wladimir. ” It was evident that the <NAME> government purposed taking severe measures to guard against any serious eventualities even in the interior of the empire .
__label__0	With such a balance the <NAME> might begin operations at once .
__label__1	‘ And naturally , ’ continued <NAME> , ‘ I who am , <NAME> PRESENT -- hem -- an unprotected female , can not afford to lose by the apartments. ’ ‘ Of course you can ’ t , ma ’ am , ’ replied <NAME> .
__label__1	Perhaps you ’ ll kindly let me have it , and I ’ ll trot off to my work. ’ ‘ I let you have it ? ’ said <NAME> , turning his head towards her ; for he had been sitting blinking at the light , and feeling his cheek .
__label__1	‘ When we first spoke together , <NAME> , you told me that your sister had risen out of the disadvantages of your past lives as superior to you as the tower of <NAME> Cathedral is higher than the chimneys of <NAME> .
__label__0	Several had departure signals , and were preparing to put to sea at morning tide ; for in this immense and admirable port there is not one day in a hundred that vessels do not set out for every quarter of the globe .
__label__0	It was only necessary to repress the marvellous dexterity of the natives in emptying pockets .
__label__1	But when we recollect , in addition , how very cruel and severe it is , and that a solitary life is always liable to peculiar and distinct objections of a most deplorable nature , which have arisen here , and call to mind , moreover , that the choice is not between this system , and a bad or ill-considered one , but between it and another which has worked well , and is , in its whole design and practice , excellent ; there is surely more than sufficient reason for abandoning a mode of punishment attended by so little hope or promise , and fraught , beyond dispute , with such a host of evils .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> ’ s deep dejection was in strange contrast to his general hilarity .
__label__0	The <NAME> visited several deserted huts .
__label__0	More than one felt his heart swell with emotion .
__label__1	Pending which , the long-initiated Tip , with an awful enjoyment of the <NAME> ’ s resources , pointed out the common kitchen fire maintained by subscription of collegians , the boiler for hot water supported in like manner , and other premises generally tending to the deduction that the way to be healthy , wealthy , and wise , was to come to the <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> and <NAME> then drove their sticks underneath the animal , and by their united efforts managed without difficulty to turn it on its back .
__label__0	`` M. Aronnax , '' he said , in rather an imperious tone , `` I require you to keep one of the conditions that bind you to me . ''
__label__0	<NAME> ! ” cried the doctor , “ the water-tank ! ” <NAME> caught his friend ’ s idea on the instant , and , snatching up with desperate strength one of the water-tanks weighing about one hundred pounds , he tossed it overboard .
__label__0	<NAME> man that he was , he would not betray his captain , and perhaps he was massacred . ''
__label__1	May I be permitted to inquire , if you are charged to convey that information to me in those hopeless words , by the lady of whom we speak ? ’ ‘ I have no charge from her. ’ ‘ The drowning man catches at the straw .
__label__0	It was enough to scour the clay with sand , then to mold the bricks and bake them by the heat of a wood fire .
__label__1	‘ With eyes bent upon the ground , then , or only raised enough to prevent his stumbling over such obstacles as lay in his way , the religious man moved slowly forward until he reached a small postern in the wall of the sisters ’ orchard , through which he passed , closing it behind him .
__label__0	`` You have a good stock of names for them anyhow , '' observed <NAME> , `` if that does any good . ''
__label__1	Mr Feeder like-wise says , that if he may advise , he would recommend Mr Toots to learn the guitar , or , at least the flute ; for women like music , when you are paying your addresses to ‘ em , and he has found the advantage of it himself .
__label__1	All this intelligence I dutifully imparted to my aunt , only reserving to myself the mention of little Em ’ ly , to whom I instinctively felt that she would not very tenderly incline .
__label__1	And she ses to me 'do it ' and I dun it and she giv me a sov'ring and hooked it .
__label__1	It was rather expensive at first , in consequence of the increase in the undertaker 's bill , and the necessity of taking in the clothes of all the paupers , which fluttered loosely on their wasted , shrunken forms , after a week or two 's gruel .
__label__1	Let him go on with the luggage , if you wish it , and do you follow with us .
__label__1	No doubt I see this , because I know it is so ; but I am astray , and seem to see nothing .
__label__0	`` I should fancy it must be so , <NAME> , '' answered the carpenter .
__label__1	Nicholas could not help suspecting that , for some reason or other , he was sent out of the way on purpose , and that the young lady was there in his absence .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> looked more astonished than hospitable , at sight of this uninvited party in his dining-room .
__label__1	Anything to equal the determined reticence of <NAME> under that roof I never saw elsewhere , even in him .
__label__1	Still , very steadfastly and quietly walking towards it , a peaceful figure too in the landscape , went <NAME> , shoeless , through the wet grass .
__label__0	Accordingly they went on without stopping , fording the <NAME> of <NAME> and also the <NAME> , a few miles further on .
__label__0	I can see their bournouses puffed out by the wind .
__label__0	“ The Tartars have burnt out his eyes ! ” replied <NAME> , extending her hands , as if imploring pity .
__label__1	‘ Will she call me “ <NAME> ” ? ’ cried <NAME> .
__label__1	He had glittering eyes , -- small , keen , and black , -- and thin wide mottled lips .
__label__1	‘ Next ( to clear the ground before coming to business ) , you ’ ve placed in this yard a skulking , a sneaking , and a sniffing , menial. ’ ‘ He hadn ’ t a cold in his head when I sent him here , ’ said Mr Boffin .
__label__1	But , perhaps , nobody 's ever did ?
__label__0	were his stifled mutterings , as he struggled in the arms of the <NAME> giant who had at last succeeded in securing him .
__label__1	‘ My dear ’ ; and he stopped and turned to me : ‘ would you like to see your -- ’ ‘ No , father , ’ <NAME> interposed .
__label__0	All his efforts were in vain , however , and to his repeated cries of “ <NAME> , <NAME> ! ” echo was the only response .
__label__1	says <NAME> , who likes nothing better than to model his conversation on forensic principles .
__label__1	‘ I should not allow , ’ said <NAME> , with an evident increase of pious sentiment , and slowly shaking his head as he poised himself upon his toes and heels alternately , ‘ my suitable provision for my child to be influenced by a piece of youthful folly like the present .
__label__0	With the egotism of madness , he believed himself the owner of a treasure he must conceal and defend .
__label__0	A more splendid programme was impossible , and it was clearly traceable to the able mind which had laid down the route taken by <NAME> and D'Entrecasteaux .
__label__1	'Amen to that , my child ! '
__label__1	‘ You know him , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ I haven ’ t been not to say right slap through him , very lately , ’ Mr <NAME> made answer , ‘ having been otherways employed , Mr Boffin .
__label__1	And really it did seem possible .
__label__1	Likeways when I went to them two Governors , <NAME> and the t ’ other Governor , with my information , I may have been a little over-eager for the cause of justice , or ( to put it another way ) a little over-stimilated by them feelings which rouses a man up , when a pot of money is going about , to get his hand into that pot of money for his family ’ s sake .
__label__1	<NAME> was as easy as ever ; but perhaps , as she sat with her eyes cast down , it might have been rather more perceptible that his attention was concentrated upon her for certain moments , than its concentration upon any subject for any short time ever was , elsewhere .
__label__0	The captain then offered the presents he had brought for the king which were gratefully accepted .
__label__1	The astonished and dismayed Rob staring after them , saw that they stopped , and fell to earnest conversation very soon ; and more than once observed a darkly threatening action of the younger woman ’ s hand ( obviously having reference to someone of whom they spoke ) , and a crooning feeble imitation of it on the part of Mrs <NAME> , that made him earnestly hope he might not be the subject of their discourse .
__label__0	There is enough for everybody . ''
__label__0	The <NAME> offered me a cup of the milk , which was still warm .
__label__0	The whole party then returned to the ship , after arranging a rendezvous with <NAME> , and ordering him to procure the necessary means of conveyance across the country .
__label__1	Every gentleman who hears me , is probably acquainted with the reply made by an individual , who -- to use an ordinary figure of speech -- “ hung out ” in a tub , to the emperor <NAME> : -- “ if I were not <NAME> , ” said he , “ I would be Alexander. ” I can well imagine these gentlemen to say , “ If I were not Dumkins I would be <NAME> ; if I were not Podder I would be Struggles. ” ( <NAME> . )
__label__1	‘ He was killed , ’ gasped <NAME> .
__label__1	I can act with philosophy in such a case as that .
__label__1	You ’ re an active woman at that time , and if you want to get that paper , you can get it .
__label__0	This sailor was a companion of her father ’ s , one of the crew of the <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Ah , <NAME> ? ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	On the 21st he doubled the most northerly cape of <NAME> , to which he gave the name of <NAME> , and entered a channel sprinkled with islands near the mainland , which inspired him with the hope of finding a passage to the <NAME> <NAME> .
__label__0	“ Then , gentlemen , ” said the astronomer , “ with your leave we will for this purpose make an appointment a few weeks hence .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> ’ s brow darkened during the recital .
__label__0	An important dispatch from <NAME> , it was said , was the cause of it .
__label__0	It was further observed that <NAME> itself was almost void of scintillation .
__label__0	<NAME> did not interrupt him .
__label__1	asked <NAME> , adding , as <NAME> nodded assent , 'What name shall I tell my good friend . '
__label__0	Under this pelisse , a short skirt , also dark , fell over a robe which reached the ankles .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> had received them with a familiar nod and a friendly look , but without any more particular greeting in the midst of his address .
__label__1	That she may be able to recognise the faces and know the persons .
__label__0	<NAME> 's instructions were now to spend the winter in the exploration of the <NAME> .
__label__0	Then , what was their Projectile to become ?
__label__0	Some took sides with <NAME> , but the large majority shook their heads and declared against him ; it was absurd , impossible , they declared , that the tour of the world could be made , except theoretically and on paper , in this minimum of time , and with the existing means of travelling .
__label__1	I ’ ve been a- turnin ’ the bis ’ ness over in my mind , and he may make his-self easy , <NAME> .
__label__0	He can try again. ” “ Why , these apes are so cunning , ” returned <NAME> ; “ they won ’ t show themselves again at the windows and so we can ’ t kill them ; and when I think of the mischief they may do in the rooms and storehouse -- ” “ Have patience , ” replied <NAME> ; “ these creatures can not keep us long at bay. ” “ I shall not be sure of that till I see them down here , ” replied the sailor .
__label__0	`` My regular hour for breakfast , '' exclaimed <NAME> , `` and I do n't see the shadow of a reason for changing it now . ''
__label__0	At the same time as the coal , the store of wood was renewed at <NAME> , and they profited by the current of the <NAME> having again become free , to float down several rafts .
__label__1	I ’ ve brought little Wackford up , on purpose to show to parents and guardians .
__label__1	As the sparks fell thick and bright about him , I could see his hands , and touches of his face , and could make out that he was seated and bending over the table ; but nothing more .
__label__0	`` Not to anybody , '' I protested .
__label__1	And as the boy hurried away with his hand to his head , singing quite a different sort of tune , <NAME> chuckled very heartily to himself , and entered the churchyard , locking the gate behind him .
__label__1	He was the meanest cur existing , with a single pair of legs .
__label__0	But his stay amongst them was too short to enable him to appreciate their character thoroughly ; and he certainly never suspected that they indulged in the horrible practice of cannibalism .
__label__0	All was black , and such a dense black that , after some minutes , my eyes had not been able to discern even the faintest glimmer .
__label__0	`` Would you not , in that case , <NAME> , attempt the adventure ? ''
__label__1	She steeped a piece of linen in a basin , into which she poured some liquid from a bottle , and laid it with a gentle hand upon the sore .
__label__0	This was represented to the commander .
__label__1	‘ A likely some one , _you_ , to come into anybody ’ s thoughts in such an aspect ! ’ he exclaimed .
__label__0	What wood should be employed ?
__label__0	He discovered successively the <NAME> , and <NAME> and <NAME> , the last of the group .
__label__0	When <NAME> supported the proposition of <NAME> , he took for granted that he should accompany the expedition .
__label__0	`` There can be no doubt of it .
__label__1	You ’ re quite right to mention it. ’ ‘ I beg your pardon , <NAME> , ’ faltered <NAME> , ‘ but we go out quite plenty Sir , thank you. ’ ‘ What would you have then ? ’ asked Mr Dombey .
__label__1	said <NAME> , clapping him on the shoulder with an air of protection that had something serious in it , though he laughed .
__label__0	I was far more willing to allow that this chimney of an extinct volcano was covered by lava of a kind refractory to heat -- in fact a bad conductor -- which did not allow the great increase of temperature to percolate through its sides .
__label__1	This was said in such a hearty tone , and the voice was so exactly what it should have been from such a speaker , and there was such a cordiality in the manner , that <NAME> was emboldened to speak again .
__label__0	When he left Armenia he took a north-easterly course towards <NAME> , a kingdom lying on the south side of the <NAME> , whose ancient kings , says the legend , `` were born with an eagle traced on their right shoulders . ''
__label__1	He interested you very much. ’ ‘ Well , my dear , ’ returned <NAME> , giving her a squeeze , ‘ it ’ s kind of you to find that reason out , and I hope it may have been so , and indeed to a certain extent I believe it was so , but I am afraid not to the whole extent .
__label__1	There was a fire in the tap-room , and some country-labourers were drinking before it .
__label__0	<NAME> Harding feared above all lest the liquefied matter should overflow the shore , for in that event the dockyard could not escape .
__label__1	Then why should they quarrel with us ?
__label__1	At length , his eyes wandered to a little dirty window on the left , through which the face of the clerk was dimly visible ; that worthy chancing to look up , he beckoned him to attend .
__label__1	Mr <NAME> ’ s companion resumed the conversation .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> led me towards the central staircase ; half way down he opened a door , traversed the upper deck , and landed in the pilot 's cage , which it may be remembered rose at the extremity of the platform .
__label__0	`` Your explanation is ingenious , my dear companion , '' replied <NAME> , `` but inadmissible . ''
__label__1	says Mrs. Bagnet , quietly threading her needle .
__label__1	Who can describe the pleasure and delight , the peace of mind and soft tranquillity , the sickly boy felt in the balmy air , and among the green hills and rich woods , of an inland village !
__label__1	She knows its influence perfectly , has studied it too well to miss a grain of its effect on any one .
__label__1	`` I will not hear you say such shameful words ! ''
__label__1	‘ Oh , no , I ’ m sure it wouldn ’ t , ’ replied the clerk , moving a little more into the centre of the doorway .
__label__1	Oh , he is a worthy gentleman , <NAME> !
__label__1	And let you never speak a word more in his favour , or you ’ ll disown your own father , likewise , and what your father says of him he ’ ll have to come to say of you .
__label__0	The two new friends felt themselves drawn closer together by the friendship this worthy man had for them both .
__label__1	If <NAME> and I were to go to some country lodging as soon as I can move , and if I had a week there in which to grow stronger and to be revived by the sweet air and to look forward to the happiness of having <NAME> with me again , I think it would be better for us . ''
__label__0	He rushed about the room wild with delight and satisfaction .
__label__0	`` Do you believe in the influence of the moon upon distempers ? ''
__label__0	It was instantly answered by another voice , shriller , louder , quicker , more joyous and triumphant in tone , but slightly tinged with a foreign accent : `` King !
__label__0	For <NAME> made no start at the terrible accusations .
__label__0	Not a particle , however , could he see of the disc that had glittered so resplendently before his eyes a few moments ago .
__label__1	That from what has been stated to me , sir , I assert that you were by no means justified in attempting to force your sister ’ s inclinations as you did , and that you should rather have endeavoured by your kindness and forbearance to have supplied the place of other nearer relations whom she had never known , from a child .
__label__1	Often after dark , one other figure walked alone before the <NAME> ’ s house .
__label__0	`` We have passed the point where we should have stopped if we had had no more initial velocity than the Cambridge men allowed us ! ''
__label__0	Some cordage gave way , which endangered the foremast .
__label__0	He crossed the <NAME> again and hunted through the quarters on the other side , where the crowd was much less considerable .
__label__1	“ It is noble in you to tell me that you have other causes of unhappiness .
__label__0	`` How much food have we left ? ''
__label__1	<NAME> is a great favourite of mine , ’ said Mrs. Sparsit , ‘ as indeed he is of most people .
__label__0	It would be necessary to fell a half-mile square of the forest which was situated at the junction of the <NAME> and the <NAME> -- that is to say , the whole river side of the fazenda , to form the enormous mass , for such were the _jangadas , _ or river rafts , which attained the dimensions of a small island .
__label__1	‘ Demnition pleasant , and a tip-top sawyer. ’ ‘ And what said he ? ’ asked <NAME> , knitting his brows .
__label__0	Besides , they did not wash more than four times a year , as was done by families in the olden times , and it may be added , that Pencroft and <NAME> , while waiting for the postman to bring him his newspaper , distinguished themselves as washermen .
__label__0	Here and there luminous spots appeared , dying out and rekindling constantly , in all directions , like fantastic lights dancing over the surface of an immense lagoon .
__label__1	As the dear old infant would be with us directly , he begged that I would make an appointment for the morning , when he might set himself right through the means of an unreserved conversation with me .
__label__0	<NAME> , `` Histoire de la <NAME> . ''
__label__0	“ Ah , my brave boy ! ” thought <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Wish you good-night , <NAME> , ’ said Mrs. Craddock .
__label__0	At last the brig found a passage and advanced through it slowly ; often a huge floe delayed her for hours ; the fog embarrassed the steersman ; at one moment he could see a mile ahead , and it was easy to avoid all obstacles ; but again the snow-squalls would hide everything from their sight at the distance of a cable 's length .
__label__1	‘ They are strangers in this part of the town , <NAME> .
__label__1	I came all this way to see him in his new clothes. ’ ‘ Ah what a pity ! ’ cried <NAME> .
__label__0	Nevertheless he made his preparations for departure ; the news spread immediately throughout the city , and , as we have seen , a great concourse of spectators thronged the piers of the <NAME> 's <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> has become a fixed fact in <NAME> , as it is in the <NAME> and in <NAME> .
__label__1	There is one cock who gets upon a post to crow , and seems to take particular notice of me as I look at him through the kitchen window , who makes me shiver , he is so fierce .
__label__0	In fact , <NAME> after leaving <NAME> visited the province of <NAME> with its capital of the same name , and what struck him most in this country , ( and we can not but think that the bold explorer was also a keen hunter ) was the great number of lions that were to be seen about its mountains and plains .
__label__1	The idea ! ’ said Mrs. Nickleby , drawing herself up , ‘ niece to the <NAME> of Paving ! ’ ‘ Pray , mama , come away ! ’ whispered <NAME> .
__label__1	I never was so wickedly wronged .
__label__1	He arrived post-haste with the intelligence one evening , and had a long conference with my guardian .
__label__1	`` I shall do it better for the wish , '' he answered ; `` it will make me enter on these new duties as on another sacred trust from you . ''
__label__0	But , I must repeat that we had not before our eyes that fabulous land which <NAME> described .
__label__1	Not caring to go too near the door , until the appointed time , <NAME> crouched into an angle of the wall , and awaited its arrival .
__label__0	Leaving the devious windings of the footpath , they went as a crow would fly across the country .
__label__0	Since the affair of <NAME> all the powers of his mind were concentrated on one object -- to become free !
__label__1	In such a very hard manner and with eyes so particularly green that <NAME> 's natural gravity is much deepened by the contemplation of that venerable man .
__label__1	As to whether your name is <NAME> , or <NAME> ? ” The official turned towards him with sudden distrust .
__label__0	The two Zealanders who had asked to accompany <NAME> were landed with him .
__label__1	cried a loud , hoarse voice , as soon as they set foot in the passage .
__label__1	Stumping with fresh vigour , he goes in at the dark greasy entry , pushes a little greasy dark reluctant side-door , and follows the door into the little dark greasy shop .
__label__0	Looking up , he now said , “ Incident to this expected shock , there may be a variety of dangers .
__label__0	Eight days after its departure , the <NAME> returned into the bay of <NAME> , with a whole flotilla of steamboats .
__label__1	‘ No , Pa. ’ ‘ Is there anybody else who would take his chance between Yes and <NAME> , if you would let him , my dear ? ’ ‘ Not that I know of , Pa. ’ ‘ There can ’ t be somebody who won ’ t take his chance when you want him to ? ’ said the cherub , as a last resource .
__label__1	It may have been a weakness , but if so , it was equally the weakness , I believe , of King Frederick of Prussia. ’ These remarks being offered to Mr <NAME> , who had not the courage to come out for single combat , but lurked with his chest under the table and his eyes cast down , <NAME> proceeded , in a voice of increasing sternness and impressiveness , until she should force that skulker to give himself up .
__label__0	After a short stay off the coast of <NAME> , <NAME> visited <NAME> , where the same incidents which had marked <NAME> 's visit were repeated .
__label__1	On purpose to annoy me , for he knows how I doat upon them ! ’ A grisly little fiction concerning her lovers is <NAME> ’ s point .
__label__1	The newly married pair , on their arrival in <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , were received by the Chief <NAME> .
__label__0	But I declare to you that I have had enough of the <NAME> , and I will not follow him to the <NAME> . ''
__label__0	If I had been sailing for the last two months with bandaged eyes , and without knowing whither the <NAME> was bound , and had been asked during the first few hours at our moorings , `` Are you in the <NAME> or in <NAME> ? ''
__label__0	He had not time to fire all the barrels .
__label__1	Therefore to have the opportunity of speaking to one so well informed about it as yourself , is an immense relief to me .
__label__0	And <NAME> , swelling out his cheeks , blew so much and so well into the tube -- taking care to twirl it round at the same time -- that his breath dilated the glassy mass .
__label__1	Begging your pardon , <NAME> , ’ said Mr Perch , hesitating at the door , ‘ he ’ s rough , <NAME> , in appearance. ’ ‘ Never mind .
__label__0	“ This prisoner , who was he ?
__label__1	When I was old enough , I was to be apprenticed to <NAME> , and until I could assume that dignity I was not to be what Mrs. <NAME> called “ Pompeyed , ” or ( as I render it ) pampered .
__label__1	‘ To be sure , I opened the packet. ’ ‘ And read it ? ’ said the old man .
__label__0	“ <NAME> , ” continued <NAME> , “ do you not know that he defended you when you were the <NAME> ’ sport ; that he risked his life for me ? ” <NAME> was still silent .
__label__1	He looked dejectedly round , and slunk away ; and , as he reached the door , the titterings of the paupers broke into a shrill chuckle of irrepressible delight .
__label__1	He made that promise when he proposed these curious interviews , and has kept it so faithfully and pleasantly , that if I ever felt any trifling uneasiness about them in the beginning ( which I don ’ t think I did , <NAME> ; his manner was so plain and true ) it very soon vanished , and left me quite glad when the day was coming .
__label__0	The half-breed continued to be very friendly with the son of <NAME> , so that the latter began to consider whether the sailing-master might not be counted on in an attempt to regain possession of the ship .
__label__1	I comforted her and would have raised her , but she cried no , no ; she wanted to stay there !
__label__0	The noise was truly awful .
__label__1	‘ Then , ’ said <NAME> , producing a small document from his pocket and unfolding it very slowly , ‘ this is a writ of execution , and if it ’ s not conwenient to settle we ’ ll go over the house at wunst , please , and take the inwentory. ’ Poor Madame Mantalini wrung her hands for grief , and rung the bell for her husband ; which done , she fell into a chair and a fainting fit , simultaneously .
__label__1	I want the room cleared of these two scum. ’ ‘ That ’ s not going to be done , <NAME> , ’ replied Mr Boffin , sitting composedly on the library-table , at one end , while the Secretary sat composedly on it at the other .
__label__1	Is it fear or is it anger now ?
__label__1	There was a draped doorway , but no door ; and as he stopped here , looking in unseen , he felt a pang .
__label__0	`` Which I shall take advantage of , '' exclaimed the <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ If I had had but that money before -- If I had only known of it a few minutes ago ! ’ muttered the old man .
__label__1	Therefore , I note here , though it may not be at all necessary , that there are hundreds of <NAME> ( as they are called ) , far more remarkable than that fancied in this book ; and that the stores of the Prerogative Office teem with instances of testators who have made , changed , contradicted , hidden , forgotten , left cancelled , and left uncancelled , each many more wills than were ever made by the elder Mr Harmon of <NAME> .
__label__1	Everybody was excited , except the fat boy , and he slept as soundly as if the roaring of cannon were his ordinary lullaby .
__label__0	No train was expected from the east , neither had there been time for the succour asked for by telegraph to arrive ; the train from <NAME> to <NAME> <NAME> was not due till the next day .
__label__1	Although <NAME> had been brought up by philosophers , he was not theoretically acquainted with the beautiful axiom that self-preservation is the first law of nature .
__label__1	I have a good deal to say to you. ’ ‘ What papers are those ? ’ inquired <NAME> , as the little man deposited on the table a small bundle of documents tied with red tape .
__label__0	Among these savages four Europeans were observed , who had a long time before deserted from the whale-ship _Rochester_ .
__label__0	<NAME> , to whom the captain left the business of refilling the water tanks and taking in supplies of fresh meat and vegetables , had every reason to be satisfied with <NAME> , who , no doubt , expected to be paid , and was paid , handsomely .
__label__1	“ <NAME> is _not _wholesome , <NAME> , ” says the doctor , wery fierce .
__label__1	‘ Coming down the yard now , <NAME> , ’ replied the hostler .
__label__1	He comes down , he goes to <NAME> , he relates what we have agreed upon , and he states our case better than we could .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> down , <NAME> , ’ said Mr Toots .
__label__1	Not that he ever said anything , or did anything , openly importing hostility ; I only noticed that he always beat his sparks in my direction , and that whenever I sang <NAME> , he came in out of time .
__label__1	bawled <NAME> , calling in a state of great excitement , up the staircase ; 'here 's one of the thieves , ma'am !
__label__0	`` My dear young lady , '' said <NAME> , at last , `` do you know that our master has been out of sorts for several days ?
__label__1	Several times she has gone out early , and been absent until evening .
__label__0	Without that how are we to know to what distance we can send one of those pretty shot with which we are provided ? ” “ Try them , <NAME> , ” replied the engineer .
__label__1	Can you spare me a very few minutes ? ’ ‘ Surely , surely , ’ returned brother <NAME> , looking at him with an anxious countenance .
__label__0	at this last moment I ask you , have we not long been betrothed to each other in our secret hearts ?
__label__1	The turnkey looked as if he thought the request a strange one and rather out of the common way , but nevertheless he laid down his paper , and coming round where <NAME> ’ s mother stood , took the basket from her , and after inspecting its contents , handed it to <NAME> , and went back to his place .
__label__0	Their provisions were giving out , and each man had but a third of a ration , in order to allow to the dogs enough food in proportion to their work .
__label__1	‘ I am quite glad , ’ said <NAME> , arrived at her own door , ‘ to know you .
__label__0	His first mate would not delay the execution of an order for ten days .
__label__1	Two persons. ’ ‘ To be sure , they didn ’ t buy anything , ’ cried the boy .
__label__1	God bless you , dear Mr Clennam .
__label__1	The ‘ young gal ’ was re-engaged ; but on the stipulation that she should only bring in the dishes , and then withdraw to the landing-place , beyond the outer door ; where a habit of sniffing she had contracted would be lost upon the guests , and where her retiring on the plates would be a physical impossibility .
__label__0	The engineer wished to see if the wire still ran along the side .
__label__0	It was probable that they would find a little of everything , and they agreed that it was exactly what was necessary for the colony of <NAME> .
__label__0	The ocean claimed a fresh victim each succeeding day .
__label__0	The entrance into this metallic tower was by a narrow aperture contrived in the wall of the cone .
__label__1	The greater part of the guests had gone to bed as soon as the eating and drinking were over ; and we , who had remained whispering and listening half-undressed , at last betook ourselves to bed , too .
__label__1	Within a minute afterwards , he was , to all outward appearance , as unsubstantial as ever .
__label__1	I do not remember that I ever saw a light in all the house .
__label__1	The pupils ate apples and put straws down one another 's backs , until <NAME> 's great-aunt collected her energies , and made an indiscriminate totter at them with a birch-rod .
__label__1	We asked a gentleman by us if he knew what cause was on .
__label__0	answered <NAME> , trembling with excitement .
__label__1	The climate being a thirsty one , there was never , at any hour of the day , a scarcity of loungers in the spacious bar , or a cessation of the mixing of cool liquors : but they were a merrier people here , and had musical instruments playing to them o ’ nights , which it was a treat to hear again .
__label__0	In many doubtful or dangerous places , it became necessary for us to be tied together by a long rope in order that should any one of us be unfortunate enough to slip , he would be supported by his companions .
__label__1	‘ Is it , ’ said <NAME> junior , taking heed of his visitor ’ s brown face , ‘ anything about -- Tonnage -- or that sort of thing ? ’ ( Pausing for a reply , he opened his right eye with his hand , and stuck his glass in it , in that inflammatory manner that his eye began watering dreadfully . )
__label__1	<NAME> came back as we finished exchanging these hurried words and gave me his arm to take me to the coach .
__label__0	A general altercation had arisen from a disagreement between the sailor <NAME> and <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> had made no remark about this .
__label__1	His family is as old as the hills , and infinitely more respectable .
__label__0	`` And what conclusion did you draw from it ? ''
__label__1	‘ We saw him pass this morning , afore he got off his horse ; when you were ready to take it. ’ ‘ Ay , ay , ’ returned <NAME> , appearing to wish that his readiness had carried him to any other place. -- ‘ What ’ s the matter with her ?
__label__1	<NAME> saw him put it there .
__label__1	‘ You deserve to have a house of your own ; don ’ t you , poor pa ? ’ ‘ I don ’ t deserve it better than another , my dear. ’ ‘ At any rate I , for one , want it more than another , ’ said <NAME> , holding him by the chin , as she stuck his flaxen hair on end , ‘ and I grudge this money going to the Monster that swallows up so much , when we all want -- Everything .
__label__1	<NAME> ’ ll remember like a good soul , won ’ t ye , that the market price is dreffle high just now ?
__label__0	I should have a violent attack of the cramp if I were not to have some sort of exercise .
__label__0	After being carried off by the <NAME> scouts on the <NAME> , <NAME> had been taken to <NAME> .
__label__1	'Whoever it was , I 'd serve them the same . '
__label__0	And what changes might not have occurred in nine days !
__label__0	“ Should the slightest accident happen , waken me , ” said <NAME> , “ and , above all things , don ’ t lose sight of the barometer .
__label__1	Rather a light purse , ’ added <NAME> , throwing it into the air and catching it dexterously , ‘ but enough to amuse a gentleman for half an hour or so. ’ ‘ We ’ ll make a four-handed game of it , and take in <NAME> , ’ said the stout man .
__label__1	She tried to recall the way they had come , and to look in the direction where the fire by which they had slept last night was burning .
__label__1	‘ I wonder that you presume to speak of impulses to me ’ -- both the teachers assented -- ‘ I am astonished ’ -- both the teachers were astonished -- ‘ I suppose it is an impulse which induces you to take the part of every grovelling and debased person that comes in your way ’ -- both the teachers supposed so too .
__label__1	'Well , well , Mrs. Mann , ' he replied in a calmer tone ; 'it may be as you say ; it may be .
__label__0	“ What reply do you want from me ? ” said <NAME> quietly .
__label__1	The world was very busy now , in sooth , and had a deal to say .
__label__0	She received her guests none the less cordially however , and organized a little dance in spite of the remonstrances of the missionaries ; only the _fête_ had to be conducted so to speak in silence , that the noise might not reach the ears of the police on duty on the beach .
__label__0	Had they formerly invaded it , so that certain unaccountable peculiarities might be explained in this way ?
__label__1	It ’ s no fault of mine .
__label__1	She had never breathed her dread of him to any one but <NAME> .
__label__1	Once there ( and it was always lurking thereabout ) , it is very active and nimble in Mrs. <NAME> 's breast , prompting her to nocturnal examinations of <NAME> 's pockets ; to secret perusals of <NAME> 's letters ; to private researches in the day book and ledger , till , cash-box , and iron safe ; to watchings at windows , listenings behind doors , and a general putting of this and that together by the wrong end .
__label__1	At the justice-room , they found the single gentleman , who had gone straight there , and was expecting them with desperate impatience .
__label__0	Even your hat would not stay on your head .
__label__0	She consulted the officers , who all gave their approval in writing ; and she found in <NAME> a devotion and skill which were speedily to be put to a severe proof .
__label__1	<NAME> care of the birdcage in my hand , will you ? ’ ‘ Thinks of a birdcage , afore me ! ’ cried the old woman , apostrophizing the ceiling .
__label__1	I see , ’ said the stranger , half aside , ‘ negus too strong here -- liberal landlord -- very foolish -- very -- lemonade much better -- hot rooms -- elderly gentlemen -- suffer for it in the morning -- cruel -- cruel ; ’ and he moved on a step or two .
__label__1	He must be stopped somehow. ” “ You mean that you ca n't accept -- ” “ How can I ? ” I interposed , as <NAME> paused .
__label__1	And another thing , my dear .
__label__1	‘ No , not exactly. ’ ‘ Figures of some sort , I would venture a bet , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Supposing we should decide , on to-morrow ’ s inquiries , to send <NAME> down to <NAME> to this lady , who would go with him ? ’ inquired Mr Dombey , after some reflection .
__label__1	He didn ’ t wish to trouble nobody , and if he had troubled anybody by what he said , he asked pardon , that was all .
__label__0	This immense circle is one mass of glittering whiteness .
__label__1	The <NAME> of <NAME> sends a splendid pile of dust and ashes , with silver wheel-boxes , patent axles , all the last improvements , and three bereaved worms , six feet high , holding on behind , in a bunch of woe .
__label__1	Look at him ! ’ ‘ Well , I _am_ looking at him , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	You must accommodate the visit to the demands upon my time .
__label__1	But it might have been. ’ ‘ Of how much ? ’ ‘ Oh !
__label__1	As the old man , <NAME> , sat by , helping her in such small ways as he could , he found it difficult to make out whether she really did realize that the deceased had been her father .
__label__1	<NAME> would have stopped him too , and indignantly ordered him to speak openly or not at all , but that he said , in a low Voice -- ‘ <NAME> -- the young lady who has just left the room -- ’ <NAME> suffered him to proceed .
__label__0	Arrived at the headquarters of the <NAME> , as most of the kings of this part of <NAME> are called , the expedition was detained for a long time , and only obtained permission to depart on payment of a large sum .
__label__1	‘ And if she knew ! ’ She knew that he was shaking the house by his walking to and fro ; and she declared it another of the miseries of being poor , that you couldn ’ t get rid of a haunting Secretary , stump -- stump -- stumping overhead in the dark , like a Ghost .
__label__1	<NAME> was about to take his chocolate .
__label__1	‘ It still wants a pair of arms .
__label__0	But others found it after <NAME> , and others will find it again . ''
__label__1	‘ Get along with you , or I ’ ll have you carried out ! ’ ‘ My comfort is , ’ said <NAME> , looking back at Mr Dombey , ‘ that I have told a piece of truth this day which ought to have been told long before and can ’ t be told too often or too plain and that no amount of <NAME> -- I hope the number of ‘ em mayn ’ t be great ’ ( here Mrs <NAME> uttered a very sharp ‘ Go along with you ! ’ and <NAME> repeated the look ) ‘ can unsay what I have said , though they gave a whole year full of warnings beginning at ten o ’ clock in the forenoon and never leaving off till twelve at night and died of the exhaustion which would be a Jubilee ! ’ With these words , <NAME> preceded her foe out of the room ; and walking upstairs to her own apartments in great state , to the choking exasperation of the ireful <NAME> , sat down among her boxes and began to cry .
__label__0	In any case , I shall trust rather to my own intelligence than theirs . ''
__label__1	In the first place because I want to profit by everything you tell me , and in the second place because I have no secrets from <NAME> . ''
__label__0	The massive walking-beam rose and fell above the deck ; at one end a piston-rod worked up and down ; and at the other was a connecting-rod which , in changing the rectilinear motion to a circular one , was directly connected with the shaft of the paddles .
__label__1	This was prudent , for in point of fact , the dwarf , knowing his disposition , was lying in wait at a little distance from the sash armed with a large piece of wood , which , being rough and jagged and studded in many parts with broken nails , might possibly have hurt him .
__label__0	`` However , '' returned the engineer , `` your search has been unsuccessful , since you are only three just as you went ! ''
__label__0	<NAME> would not have mentioned it if he had not been sure , without having seen it with his own eyes . ''
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , madam ? ’ ‘ And the dismal evening , and -- and everything , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Now , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ speak up ! ’ After the four days he had passed , this address fell rudely and discordantly on <NAME> ’ s ear .
__label__1	Oh , <NAME> , you silly , silly , silly puss ! ''
__label__1	But that lady , kissing me , and making me put them back in my pocket , replied that she couldn ’ t think of it .
__label__0	The elliptical curve was being rigidly carried out .
__label__0	asked the old sailor , who was always seeking information from the doctor .
__label__1	‘ I am not aweer , <NAME> , that you have any right to address your conversation to me .
__label__1	In a word , I was too cowardly to do what I knew to be right , as I had been too cowardly to avoid doing what I knew to be wrong .
__label__1	‘ You see what a dry , shrivelled , withered old chip it is , ’ returned <NAME> , when the other was at length silent .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> was perfectly right .
__label__0	Warm beverages , such as coffee and tea , were regularly distributed to the sailors morning and evening ; and as it was important to live on meat , they shot ducks and teal , which abounded in these parts .
__label__1	That boy , <NAME> , ’ said the Major in a lower tone , ‘ will live in history .
__label__1	And my child is a troublesome bad child , and costs me a world of scolding .
__label__1	‘ An unusually cold spring , ’ says Mr Dombey -- to deceive the world .
__label__1	For dinner we ’ ll have a tureen of the hottest and strongest soup available , and we ’ ll have the best made-dish that can be recommended , and we ’ ll have a joint ( such as a haunch of mutton ) , and we ’ ll have a goose , or a turkey , or any little stuffed thing of that sort that may happen to be in the bill of fare—in short , we ’ ll have whatever there is on hand. ’ These liberal directions <NAME> issued with his usual air of reading an inventory , or repeating a lesson , or doing anything else by rote .
__label__1	It had begun to grow dark , and I had shut the window ( I had been lying , for the most part , with my head upon the sill , by turns crying , dozing , and looking listlessly out ) , when the key was turned , and <NAME> came in with some bread and meat , and milk .
__label__0	And lastly , a pallisade , high and regularly built , surrounded the summit of the hill .
__label__1	‘ I am thy poor friend , with all my heart and mind. ’ [ Picture : <NAME> and <NAME> in the sick room ] The wounds of which she had spoken , seemed to be about the neck of the self-made outcast .
__label__1	‘ What more could you do ! ’ sneered Quilp , ‘ couldn ’ t you have done something less ?
__label__1	The first effects of the latter was the strange delusion , founded upon a well-known medical theory , strongly contended for by some , and as strongly contested by others , that an hereditary madness existed in his family .
__label__1	I really don ’ t know what to say , ’ replied Mrs. Curdle .
__label__1	<NAME> , it did sometimes happen that it was not easy to find another , without making a long circuit ; and so I had passed that way , upon the whole , pretty often .
__label__1	So strange , to have the road-dust on his feet instead of the coal-grit .
__label__1	Here ’ s a burial volume , just the thing !
__label__0	Now then , having said this much , I will begin. ” And slowly articulating each syllable , he repeated the following sentences : “ LE 27th <NAME> , 1862 , _le trois-mats <NAME> , de _Glasgow , a sombre_ apres une longue <NAME> dans les mers <NAME> sur les cotes de la <NAME> -- in <NAME> .
__label__1	My employer -- ’ Here <NAME> provokingly left off ; and began to peel the lemons that had been under my directions set before him , together with all the other appliances he used in making punch .
__label__0	The peaks on the north and east had disappeared from view , and nothing was visible save the fantastic <NAME> of some towering rocks here and there .
__label__1	Terms , twenty guineas per annum .
__label__1	Then , you were to pay up your subscription , get your card of membership and your riband and medal , and were evermore to live upon a platform , and evermore to say what <NAME> said , and what the <NAME> said , and what the sub-Treasurer said , and what the <NAME> said , and what the sub-Committee said , and what the Secretary said , and what the Vice-Secretary said .
__label__1	If I felt that I could ever give him the best right he could have to be my protector , and if I felt that I could happily and justly become the dear companion of his remaining life , superior to all lighter chances and changes than death , even then he could not have me bind myself irrevocably while this letter was yet so new to me , but even then I must have ample time for reconsideration .
__label__1	<NAME> , overhearing her , called up a look , to justify the eulogium , but it was hardly the right look .
__label__1	I would not lose her now , for all the treasures of the world .
__label__1	'It wrings my heart to hear you ! '
__label__0	“ It is I , <NAME> ! ” said <NAME> “ Yes , it is you , captain , ” replied <NAME> , without the least sign of surprise at <NAME> ’ s recovery .
__label__0	After this second misfortune he could not make up his mind to appear before the King of <NAME> .
__label__1	`` 'To promote the conversation , ' as a joker might say .
__label__1	‘ He cut her face right open , and pounded her in the most brutal manner , when she took him ; but she never loosed her hold till he was locked up .
__label__1	You 'll lose your temper with the whole round of 'em , again and again ; and I shall take you on a score of warrants yet , if I have luck . ''
__label__0	A nice sort of captain , indeed , to let all this merchandise be lost , and do such wrong to his crew ! ''
__label__0	His crews , embittered and fatigued , caused him great uneasiness , and in his narrative of the voyage , this great man , superior though he were to all human weaknesses , and a being whom adverse fate could not humble , bemoans himself bitterly over this trial .
__label__0	The object , however , of supreme interest was the great expanse of the terrestrial disc , which was rapidly drawing down obliquely towards them .
__label__0	During this excursion they saw several wild boars , which however , did not offer to attack the little band , and it appeared as if they would not meet with any dangerous beasts ; when , in a thick part of the wood , the reporter thought he saw , some paces from him , among the lower branches of a tree , an animal which he took for a bear , and which he very tranquilly began to draw .
__label__1	I knew this meant , in our local dialect , like two young thrushes , and received it as a compliment .
__label__1	In the course of that letter , I told <NAME> that I had a particular occasion for half a guinea ; and that if she could lend me that sum until I could repay it , I should be very much obliged to her , and would tell her afterwards what I had wanted it for .
__label__0	The conditions are not identical .
__label__0	Although he had received very costly presents , <NAME> was anything but satisfied , and declared that if the travellers did not make him other and more valuable gifts , he would require their guns , pistols , and powder , before he allowed them to leave <NAME> .
__label__1	The seizure of the station with a fit of trembling , gradually deepening to a complaint of the heart , announced the train .
__label__0	<NAME> and <NAME> are thus united by an uninterrupted metal ribbon , which measures no less than three thousand seven hundred and eighty-six miles .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> had , that day , invited his three friends to dinner ; they were all seated round the fire , drinking their wine , when <NAME> presented himself , as above described .
__label__1	And there was a passive congeniality between them , besides this active one .
__label__1	A blazing sun upon a fierce August day was no greater rarity in southern <NAME> then , than at any other time , before or since .
__label__0	`` <NAME> , '' said <NAME> , `` you will lower the launch and send six men to bring coal aboard . ''
__label__1	‘ Ah ! ’ thinks <NAME> , ‘ his own words ! ’ ‘ Seeing what I have seen to-night , and hearing what I have heard , ’ adds <NAME> , with great earnestness , ‘ I shall never know peace of mind when there is danger of those two coming together , with no one else to interfere .
__label__0	asked the old man , with glistening eyes .
__label__0	He came out of the house in which he was hidden .
__label__0	For myself , I began to feel the most fearful and devouring hunger .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> , after having examined that part of the <NAME> where the cycas grew , took their bearings , and returned to <NAME> , where they made known their discovery .
__label__1	What did he earn by it ?
__label__0	From thirty-two men who had embarked on the schooner , our number was reduced to twenty-three : how low was that figure yet to fall ?
__label__1	He shook the snow from his hat and clothes , and brushed it away from his face , while I was inwardly making these remarks .
__label__1	'And his master , too , I think you said , <NAME> ? '
__label__1	He was ‘ only a plasterer , ’ Little <NAME> said , as a caution to him not to form high social expectations of <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ If anyone had told me this yesterday , ’ said <NAME> , with majesty , ‘ or even half-an-hour ago , I should have been tempted , I almost believe , to strike them to the earth .
__label__1	I was fluttered by her being unexpectedly so near ( she was almost within speaking distance before I knew her ) and would have risen to continue my walk .
__label__0	It appeared that the <NAME> must have been the first to trade with them , for they were quite unacquainted with the use or value of iron , and preferred a single coloured bead to a hatchet , or a nail six inches long .
__label__0	They hastened their gait , and in about half an hour they were climbing up the steps of <NAME> .
__label__1	The kind of foreign help which people usually seek for their children , I can afford to despise ; being above it , I hope .
__label__1	Down to -- ah , poor poor fellow ! -- to the end , he never received me but with something of his old merry boyish manner .
__label__0	If , however , we strip this narrative of all that is ridiculous and grotesque , and calculated to please the imaginations of his contemporaries , it remains certain that <NAME> 's expedition is one of the most remarkable of this epoch , so fertile in gigantic enterprises ; and it furnishes the first information upon the immense zone of country lying between the Andes and the <NAME> .
__label__1	I came to think that the <NAME> was walled up before me , that the energy and action of my life were at an end , that I never could find any refuge but in the grave .
__label__0	For two years , three years , this went on ; but <NAME> , humbled by solitude , always looking for some ship to appear on the horizon , asking himself if the time of expiation would soon be complete , suffered as none other ever suffered !
__label__1	‘ How are you , <NAME> ? ’ said he .
__label__1	I appeal to our mutual friend Smallweed whether he has or has not heard me remark that I ca n't make him out . ''
__label__1	They had gone rustling away as if their little dresses were made of autumn-leaves : and they came rustling back , in like manner .
__label__1	And for what place of all places ?
__label__1	<NAME> , <NAME> , this long while !
__label__1	The firm was known as <NAME> and <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Good gracious , <NAME> , ’ returned the <NAME> , ‘ I said tonight ’ s a week , that I ’ d come tonight , didn ’ t I ?
__label__1	Let him keep his eye on those chimneys , going on as straight as ever he can , and presently he 'll see 'em down a turning on the left , shut in by a great brick wall which forms one side of the street .
__label__0	The passage of the <NAME> was thus open to the besiegers .
__label__1	It ’ s my business to see it .
__label__1	At that instant , <NAME> , who has been lying in wait for nothing else all along , says in a deep warning voice : ‘ Clara ! ’ My mother starts , colours , and smiles faintly .
__label__0	This was the conclusion at which <NAME> arrived , after mature reflection .
__label__0	The belts all parallel to <NAME> ’ s equator were very distinct in their markings .
__label__0	The pupils seemed to be singularly enlarged .
__label__1	Mr Dombey , Sir. ’ <NAME> bowed .
__label__0	When <NAME> and his companions recovered consciousness , thanks to the attention lavished upon them , they found themselves in the cabin of a steamer , without being able to comprehend how they had escaped death .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> and the <NAME> cook had quite surpassed themselves .
__label__0	They all ate heartily , but talked more than they ate , eagerly asking <NAME> questions about the wonders of the country they were just beginning to traverse .
__label__1	That ’ s all. ’ <NAME> rested his elbow on the arm of his chair , and shaded his face with his hand .
__label__1	Did you think that I was long gone ? ’ It is as the face of a woman , shaded by a quantity of rich dark hair .
__label__0	`` Then come amphibious animals and fish , whose temperature varies very much according to that of the water .
__label__0	Why shouldn ’ t I work my way out of the scrape as well as they did ?
__label__0	This woody islet did not offer the varied aspects of <NAME> , arid and wild in one part , but fertile and rich in the other .
__label__0	He wanted to know exactly how long the storm was going to last ; whereupon he was referred to the barometer , which seemed to have no intention of rising .
__label__0	no ! ” “ You wish to drive me mad ? ” “ My son , ” exclaimed <NAME> , “ listen to me !
__label__1	`` What 's the matter with the cat ? ''
__label__1	‘ There ! ’ cried the coachman , appealing to <NAME> , with a sort of exalting despair ; ‘ that ’ s the way the young lady ’ s been a goin ’ on for up ’ ards of a mortal hour , and me continivally backing out of no thoroughfares , where she would drive up .
__label__0	The ship was to follow a route parallel with that of the boat , of which it was never to lose sight for a moment ; but M. <NAME> had scarcely been gone a quarter of an hour when <NAME> .
__label__1	What with one job and another , there ’ s lodging -- and good lodging too -- pretty well all the year round , rent free , and a weekly allowance besides , <NAME> , that would provide her with a great many comforts she don ’ t at present enjoy .
__label__1	Not for your sake , but for the sake of others .
__label__0	The only individual whose soul seemed unstirred by the approaching earth was <NAME> .
__label__0	Thereupon <NAME> began to choose his crew , bearing in mind the captain 's wishes about the independence and health of the men .
__label__1	said <NAME> with great enjoyment .
__label__0	In truth , I was simply in the presence of a very ordinary product of the earth , of singular and gigantic proportions .
__label__0	Soon the ice began to break up rapidly , and it became imprudent to venture upon the plain without a staff to sound the passages ; for fissures wound in spirals here and there .
__label__0	This traitor , impelled by insane ambition as much as by hate , had ordered the movement so as to attack <NAME> .
__label__0	I have only been able to make out one or two fugitive observations , jotted down in a mere mechanical way .
__label__1	I have resolved to bear the shame that will attach to me -- resolved to know that it attaches falsely -- that you know it too -- and that he does not , never can , and never shall .
__label__1	‘ I scorn your shifty evasions , and I scorn you , ’ said the schoolmaster .
__label__1	Now , what do you say ? ’ ‘ I say , ’ returned Mr Boffin , leaning forward in alarmed appeal , with his hands on his knees , ‘ that I am sure I don ’ t want to trifle .
__label__1	Volumes could not have said more .
__label__0	Meanwhile the terrors of this winter 's night had increased .
__label__1	In the gloomy tile-paved entry to the gloomy tile-paved staircase , <NAME> bent down on one knee to the child of his old master , and put her hand to his lips .
__label__1	He wore a very precise shirt-frill , and carried a pair of first-rate spectacles on his forehead , and a tremendous chronometer in his fob , rather than doubt which precious possession , he would have believed in a conspiracy against it on part of all the clocks and watches in the <NAME> , and even of the very Sun itself .
__label__0	He listened without opening his mouth .
__label__1	Why , it is an idea , ’ said <NAME> , with sarcastic dignity , ‘ the absurdity of which almost relieves its treachery. ’ ‘ Pray , <NAME> , ’ urged <NAME> , ‘ do not say such dreadful things. ’ ‘ Dreadful things ! ’ repeated <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> ’ s place was at the bottom of the school , at the opposite end of the long room .
__label__0	We have contracted a debt , and I hope that we shall one day pay it. ” “ You are right in speaking thus , my dear <NAME> , ” replied <NAME> .
__label__0	But first let us light up . ''
__label__1	The third , and not the least numerous or influential , is composed of all that delicate gentility which can not bear a superior , and can not brook an equal ; of that class whose Republicanism means , ‘ I will not tolerate a man above me : and of those below , none must approach too near ; ’ whose pride , in a land where voluntary servitude is shunned as a disgrace , must be ministered to by slaves ; and whose inalienable rights can only have their growth in negro wrongs .
__label__1	No matter that it was utterly irreconcilable with the nature of things and course of events that the wretched honourable gentleman could possibly produce a Precedent for this -- <NAME> would nevertheless thank the honourable gentleman for that ironical cheer , and would close with him upon that issue , and would tell him to his teeth that there Was NO Precedent for this .
__label__0	Now stony roads took the place of the old mining tramways .
__label__1	‘ Now , my reliance is on you. ’ ‘ But it must not be on me , <NAME> , ’ returned <NAME> , with a pleasant smile .
__label__0	* * * * * And that very evening , an hour or two only before the discharge was to take place , and while <NAME> and <NAME> were thus congratulating themselves , <NAME> , shut up in his room at <NAME> , jumped to his feet and whooped like a Redskin .
__label__1	However , I now wrote a comforting letter to Mrs. Micawber , in our joint names , and we both signed it .
__label__0	It was to be regretted that the brig ’ s two boats had not been saved ; but one , as has been said , had gone to pieces at the mouth of the <NAME> , and was absolutely useless ; the other had disappeared when the brig went down , and had not again been seen , having doubtless been crushed .
__label__1	Mr Cripples ’ s pupils , who were by this time coming to school , desisted from their morning recreation of cuffing one another with bags and books , to stare with all the eyes they had at a stranger who had been to see <NAME> .
__label__1	As soon as she could walk , she began to explore the room , and then the house ; she became familiar with the form , density , weight , and heat , of every article she could lay her hands upon .
__label__1	At this point , the <NAME> , with a show of being very particular with a view to proceedings to be had thereafter , desired the jailer to communicate 'the names of them two files as was on the bench . '
__label__0	Fifteen years ago I settled down comfortably at <NAME> with my <NAME> ; she has presented me with ten children , who in their turn will present me with grandchildren . ''
__label__1	How are you ? ’ ( very shortly . )
__label__1	‘ <NAME> must have gone down to the <NAME> , sir .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> senior , taking off his upper coat , and seating himself with his accustomed gravity .
__label__1	Rob the <NAME> discharged himself of his duty with so much exactness and judgment , when thus put to the proof , that the <NAME> presented him , at divers times , with seven sixpences , in token of satisfaction ; and gradually felt stealing over his spirit the resignation of a man who had made provision for the worst , and taken every reasonable precaution against an unrelenting fate .
__label__0	“ What distance have we traversed to-day ? ” asked <NAME> , disposing of some alarming mouthfuls .
__label__1	<NAME> , make room for one of these gentlemen on the box .
__label__1	You know -- dear me , what a very elegant button this is , <NAME> !
__label__1	What else is to be expected ! ’ ‘ I am even a poorer man of business than I am a man , sir , ’ returned <NAME> , ‘ and I could hardly express my deficiency in a stronger way .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , Mr Rokesmith , I can ’ t say what I consider them , ’ returned the young lady .
__label__0	Whatever his punctuality , he could not prevent the delays which were certain to occur ; and a delay of only two or three days would be fatal to his tour . ''
__label__1	And in any one of these his many cares , from first to last , <NAME> never flagged nor faltered .
__label__1	And thus for a fortnight matters went on .
__label__1	`` Now , little housewife , '' said my guardian , looking at his watch , `` I was strictly timed before I came upstairs , for you must not be tired too soon ; and my time has waned away to the last minute .
__label__1	‘ Is there anybody at home ?
__label__0	She waited -- <NAME> waited also .
__label__0	Let us add that he turned this long cruise to account , to fix astronomically , and with remarkable accuracy , the latitude of various points .
__label__1	‘ Not in that place , p ’ raps , ’ returned the <NAME> , with a wink .
__label__1	He closed his book hastily ; and was at once ushered into the imposing presence of the renowned <NAME> .
__label__0	In a few days , sundry indications of an island or a continent appeared , such as floating weeds , land-birds , & c. On the 5th of October the colour of the sea changed , and on the morning of the 6th , a coast running west by north-west was perceived .
__label__1	The box was packed at last , and then there came supper , with some little delicacy provided for the occasion , and as a set-off against the expense of which , <NAME> and her mother had feigned to dine when <NAME> was out .
__label__1	As a vast fire will fill the air to a great distance with its roar , so the sacred flame which the mighty <NAME> had fanned caused the air to resound more and more with the name of <NAME> .
__label__0	But <NAME> clung to him only the more fiercely , and they had been contending thus without the doctor seeing them for many seconds , when , suddenly the rifle went off .
__label__1	He was five foot nine and a half , and he lays in five-and-twen-ty foot of ground. ’ ‘ RAT -- tat-tat , <NAME> -- tat-tat , <NAME> -- tat-tat , ’ across the yard .
__label__0	Is it always to be thus ?
__label__1	‘ When I proposed to come with Mr and <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ Mrs <NAME> urged me to do so , in order that I might give her my small report -- it ’ s not worth anything , Mr Rokesmith , except for it ’ s being a woman ’ s -- which indeed with you may be a fresh reason for it ’ s being worth nothing -- of <NAME> Hexam. ’ ‘ Mr Boffin , ’ said the Secretary , ‘ directed me to come for the same purpose. ’ As they spoke they were leaving the little street and emerging on the wooded landscape by the river .
__label__1	All the time we were out , the two gentlemen smoked incessantly -- which , I thought , if I might judge from the smell of their rough coats , they must have been doing , ever since the coats had first come home from the tailor ’ s .
__label__1	You want another dose ! ’ said Mr Flintwinch .
__label__0	said <NAME> , who , more active than his companions , first reached the plateau .
__label__1	To a certain written statement respecting not wishing to be regarded in a certain light .
__label__1	The time came , without bringing with it any relief to my feelings , and the company came .
__label__1	And what ’ s going to be undertook for that unfortunate young woman , <NAME> , now ? ’ ‘ You touch a point that my thoughts have been dwelling on since yesterday , ’ said I , ‘ but on which I can give you no information yet , <NAME> .
__label__1	He saw her bosom throb , and saw her face flush and turn white .
__label__0	As to its dimensions , I could only conjecture them to be admirably proportioned .
__label__0	<NAME> -- for it was she -- was thus able , without knowing it , to render to the mother those attentions which she had herself received from the son .
__label__1	<NAME> , <NAME> , fly ! ’ So , they went softly up the kitchen stairs on tiptoe , and <NAME> with her light hand softly removed the fastenings of the house door , and <NAME> , having received a parting hug , made off .
__label__1	It was not yet daylight ; for the candle was still burning , and it was quite dark outside .
__label__1	I am sure , ’ added <NAME> , glancing at her pretty face , ‘ he can have very little idea of the pleasure he denies himself. ’ ‘ Oh , my dear <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ what shall we do , if he continues to be angry with us ? ’ ‘ Why , wait patiently , my dear , until he thinks better of it , ’ replied <NAME> cheerfully .
__label__1	`` Much obliged to you , ma'am ! ''
__label__0	It may readily be supposed that an event which deprived <NAME> of a large number of officers , and of thirty-two of his best sailors , was calculated to upset the plans of the expedition .
__label__1	‘ Excuse my putting it to you , <NAME> , but now really !
__label__1	‘ If anybody comes on office business , take their messages , and say that the gentleman who attends to that matter isn ’ t in at present , will you ? ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	He now said he would ‘ go and look up Mr Rugg ’ , from whom his excited state of mind appeared to require another back ; and bundling up his papers , and exchanging one more hearty shake of the hand with <NAME> , he went at full speed down-stairs , and steamed off .
__label__0	After leaving <NAME> , <NAME> set sail on the 3rd of January , for the south-east , to explore the only part of the ocean which had hitherto escaped him .
__label__0	`` But , my good sir -- '' `` I tell you to come .
__label__0	Until now , its dynamic force has remained under restraint , and has only been able to produce a small amount of power . ''
__label__1	Her manner was more winning than she had cared to let it be to me before , and I thought I saw <NAME> 's influence in the change .
__label__0	What this incomparable mountain really is , with all the projections converging toward it , and the interior excrescences of its crater , photography itself could never represent .
__label__0	`` Travels in the <NAME> of <NAME> . ''
__label__0	<NAME> had raised himself a little and gazed without seeing .
__label__1	He strolled westward this time , pacing the long streets with hurried footsteps , and agitated by a thousand misgivings and apprehensions which he could not overcome .
__label__1	Do I know anything about your combinings ? ’ ‘ No no , sir -- certainly not ; not by any means , ’ returned <NAME> .
__label__1	Give me your hand , <NAME> , give me your hand. ’ <NAME> gave it ; but Mr <NAME> had driven his heart out of it , and nothing could change his face now , from its white , shocked look .
__label__1	His recollections were few enough , but they were all of one kind -- all connected with the poverty and misery of his parents .
__label__0	It is about fifty-five leagues to the west of the <NAME> frontier .
__label__0	`` But probably <NAME> never knew the real dimensions of these craters .
__label__0	Something appeared , startled by my noise .
__label__0	`` I will come back , '' answered Dr. Wilkins .
__label__1	Thus , they lingered on till the hour of separating for the night was long past ; and then they found that they might as well have given vent to their real feelings before , for they could not suppress them , do what they would .
__label__1	<NAME> and time have taught me what to do .
__label__1	Dismissed ! ’ said <NAME> , giving <NAME> his hand before lightly waving it , as if he waved the whole subject away .
__label__0	According to him , “ a soft and gentle breeze is constantly observable , and produces an evaporation , thanks to which the temperature is kept down , and the sun does not give out heat unchecked .
__label__0	<NAME> found himself at the pole of cold , beyond the countries seen by his predecessors ; he consequently expected a terrible winter , on a ship lost amid the ice , with a turbulent crew .
__label__1	Will you graciously let me kiss your hand ? ''
__label__0	The last intelligence of <NAME> Grant was from <NAME> on the 30th of May , 1862 , as appeared in the _Mercantile and <NAME> .
__label__0	Now <NAME> had more than once seen <NAME> vessels , and he persuaded his friends to go and meet the strangers , and to receive them kindly .
__label__0	In a moment the reporter and his two companions had crossed the corral and reached the gate of the palisade behind which <NAME> was heard growling sullenly .
__label__0	The conical peak of <NAME> looked black against the bright sky , which seemed all ablaze with the splendor of the rising sun .
__label__1	Mrs <NAME> ’ s back being then towards him , the military gentleman shook his forefinger as a sign that her myrmidons were not to apprise her of his presence , and stealing up close behind her , tapped her on the neck , and cried playfully ‘ Boh ! ’ ‘ What , Mr Slum ! ’ cried the lady of the wax-work .
__label__1	Of course it ’ s an exertion , but still , when I know how much depends upon me in this house , I am obliged to make it .
__label__1	Only hear them ! ” <NAME> , mad , and dangerous footsteps to force their way into anybody 's life , footsteps not easily made clean again if once stained red , the footsteps raging in <NAME> <NAME> afar off , as the little circle sat in the dark <NAME> window .
__label__1	‘ But we must think of dear Pa , ’ said <NAME> ; ‘ I haven ’ t told dear Pa ; let us speak to Pa. ’ Upon which they turned to do so .
__label__1	‘ Yes , sir , it was , ’ replied <NAME> ; ‘ and _blue bore_ , <NAME> , if you like that better ; ha !
__label__1	‘ Gentlemen , ’ said the coach-horser , ‘ rather than disturb the harmony of this delightful occasion , perhaps <NAME> will oblige the company. ’ ‘ Raly , gentlemen , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ I ’ m not wery much in the habit o ’ singin ’ without the instrument ; but anythin ’ for a quiet life , as the man said wen he took the sitivation at the lighthouse. ’ With this prelude , <NAME> burst at once into the following wild and beautiful legend , which , under the impression that it is not generally known , we take the liberty of quoting .
__label__0	<NAME> neither tried to join them nor to go near <NAME> .
__label__1	Mr Dombey , <NAME> Skewton. ’ The lady in the chair was gracious .
__label__0	Let us follow the liana ! ” And off they went as happy as children home for their holidays .
__label__0	If this was an <NAME> craft , we should blow up , perhaps , but we should at all events go faster ! ''
__label__0	It was in <NAME> , the vast riches of which had been hinted at in the accounts given of their travels by <NAME> and <NAME> , that the attention of the <NAME> was now concentrated .
__label__1	With a pitiful and plaintive look for her wayward sister ; for her idle brother ; for the high blank walls ; for the faded crowd they shut in ; for the games of the prison children as they whooped and ran , and played at hide-and-seek , and made the iron bars of the inner gateway ‘ Home. ’ Wistful and wondering , she would sit in summer weather by the high fender in the lodge , looking up at the sky through the barred window , until , when she turned her eyes away , bars of light would arise between her and her friend , and she would see him through a grating , too .
__label__1	He was altogether too unsettled in his mind over it , to appreciate it comfortably I thought , or to have anybody to dine with him , without making a chop with his jaws at the visitor .
__label__1	'What business is it of yours ? '
__label__0	<NAME> here rose , and her presence , which inspired <NAME> with despair , imparted some courage to <NAME> .
__label__1	For as she looked , she saw him murdering that fond idea to which she had held in spite of him .
__label__1	Do you still think , in spite of it , that I do not mean what I say ? ” “ You would never marry him , <NAME> ? ” She looked towards <NAME> , and considered for a moment with her work in her hands .
__label__0	His examination lasted some few minutes , and then he lowered the glass , set it up on deck , and leaned on it as if it had been a walking-stick .
__label__1	The weather was warm , and the people were sitting at their doors , or strolling in their little gardens as he passed , enjoying the serenity of the evening , and their rest from labour .
__label__1	I had cut the connexion .
__label__0	The front was set apart especially for the ladies , and , under the carpenter ’ s hands , was to be speedily converted into a comfortable room , covered with a thick carpet , and fitted up with a toilet table and two couches .
__label__0	Ice is drifting down the <NAME> , which will not be long in freezing , and in that case the <NAME> might perhaps cross. ” “ Will your Highness allow me to make an observation ? ” said the chief of the merchants .
__label__1	‘ Well , <NAME> , ’ said Mrs. Crummles , who was seated there in full regal costume , with the phenomenon as the <NAME> in her maternal arms , ‘ next week for <NAME> , then for Winchester , then for -- ’ ‘ I have some reason to fear , ’ interrupted <NAME> , ‘ that before you leave here my career with you will have closed. ’ ‘ Closed ! ’ cried Mrs. Crummles , raising her hands in astonishment .
__label__0	It returned without having found the requisite depth at a cable 's length from shore .
__label__0	I did require a good night 's rest , and I went off reflecting at the last moment that my perilous adventure in the interior of the earth , in total darkness , had lasted four days !
__label__0	Upon its embattled walls floated the national colors of <NAME> .
__label__0	Constant skirmishes ensued , with heavy loss to the blacks , until we reached <NAME> , where we remained for a day .
__label__0	It had been decided that a military fete should mark the inauguration of the <NAME> headquarters in this important city .
__label__1	Good-bye ! ’ And so he left her : first observing that she sat down on the corner of a seat , and not only rested her little hand upon the rough wall , but laid her face against it too , as if her head were heavy , and her mind were sad .
__label__1	cried the stranger ; ' I speak of one ; a meek-looking , pale-faced boy , who was apprenticed down here , to a coffin-maker -- I wish he had made his coffin , and screwed his body in it -- and who afterwards ran away to <NAME> , as it was supposed .
__label__1	He ruminated for a minute ; eyeing the broker , meanwhile , as a deep genius ; and then called the Instrument-maker aside .
__label__0	The cries of the terrified musmons and goats indicated the alarm which possessed them .
__label__0	I passed the evening reading , writing , and thinking .
__label__1	‘ My hand quite shakes. ’ ‘ You were the life of the party last night , <NAME> ’ am , you know , ’ returned <NAME> , ‘ and you suffer for it , to-day , you see. ’ Edith , who had beckoned <NAME> to the window , and was looking out , with her back turned on the toilet of her esteemed mother , suddenly withdrew from it , as if it had lightened .
__label__0	He was charged , arrested , tried , and sentenced to death .
__label__0	“ I was afraid you would , ” replied <NAME> , looking intently at the chess-board .
__label__1	And this was the feature of the conversation which impressed <NAME> , as a man not used to it , very disagreeably : making him doubt if it were quite right to sit there , silently hearing a great nation narrowed to such little bounds .
__label__0	A decided resolution was therefore immediately taken .
__label__1	‘ I beg to ask my son , from motives of -- ah -- curiosity , ’ Mr <NAME> observed , with a decided change in his manner , ‘ how he becomes possessed of this -- hum -- timely information ? ’ ‘ It ’ s not a long story , sir , ’ returned <NAME> , <NAME> , ‘ and you shall have it out of hand .
__label__1	Many ladies and gentleman , now grown up to be interesting members of society , have been indebted to her care .
__label__0	The hunters had scarcely entered the bushes when they saw <NAME> engaged in a struggle with an animal which he was holding by the ear .
__label__0	After an examination of the ocean , I looked upward , towards the strange and mysterious sky .
__label__0	Once more again before the travellers ' eyes the <NAME> 's disc revealed itself in all the old familiar features so characteristic of lunar landscapes -- no blending of tones , no softening of colors , no graduation of shadows , every line glaring in white or black by reason of the total absence of refracted light .
__label__1	I don ’ t ask what it is , as you have not told me ; but the fact is so .
__label__0	It was the same with the “ cockyleeky , ” a cock stewed with leeks , which merited high praise .
__label__1	<NAME> Leicester feels it incumbent on him to observe a crushing aspect towards <NAME> because it is whispered abroad that these necessary expenses will , in some two hundred election petitions , be unpleasantly connected with the word bribery , and because some graceless jokers have consequently suggested the omission from the <NAME> service of the ordinary supplication in behalf of the <NAME> of <NAME> and have recommended instead that the prayers of the congregation be requested for six hundred and fifty-eight gentlemen in a very unhealthy state .
__label__1	My dear Clennam , I thoroughly confide in you ; you have it in your power to be quite as useful to me as I have , or have had , it in my power to be useful to you ; your old place awaits you , and wants you very much ; there is nothing to detain you here one half-hour longer. ’ There was silence , which was not broken until <NAME> had stood for some time at the window with his back towards them , and until his little wife that was to be had gone to him and stayed by him .
__label__1	However , as Mrs. Chillip says , sir , they undergo a continual punishment ; for they are turned inward , to feed upon their own hearts , and their own hearts are very bad feeding .
__label__0	When it had rolled on , the men reappeared on the surface , and counted each other rapidly ; but all the horses , except <NAME> , who still bore his master , had gone down forever .
__label__1	Even when she had made the circuit of the enclosure , and , returning to the porch , sat pensively waiting for their friend , she took her station where she could still look upon them , and felt as if fascinated towards that spot .
__label__0	A quarter of an hour afterwards <NAME> and <NAME> descended the last ladder , and set foot on the lowest floor of the pit .
__label__1	It is natural , under these circumstances , that he , in his turn , should remember the friend to whom he is indebted for so promising an acquaintance .
__label__0	The <NAME> had never found a more picturesque and attractive country in any of their voyages .
__label__0	The cold forced him to return .
__label__1	Has there been none here this fifteen years ? ’ Thus was she always balancing her bargains with the <NAME> of heaven , posting up the entries to her credit , strictly keeping her set-off , and claiming her due .
__label__1	<NAME> has prevented me from mixing much with general society in any but a professional character ; still I trust I am competent to perceive that she is a highly genteel young lady .
__label__0	D'Urville now set to work on a very strange task , which , as compared with others of a similar kind , was likely to be of considerable value .
__label__1	Not a little more magnificence , therefore , on the part of <NAME> .
__label__0	All <NAME> would unite with me to save so devoted a son as he has been to her .
__label__1	said she in reply to my inquiry .
__label__1	I am invested with no authority for diverging from them .
__label__0	“ I thought I heard someone walking behind us , ” replied the young miner , listening more attentively .
__label__1	<NAME> , perhaps , of banquets , as the starved usually do , and of ease and rest , as the driven slave and the yoked ox may , its lean inhabitants slept soundly , and were fed and freed .
__label__1	Some called for ladders , some for sledge-hammers ; some ran with torches to and fro as if to seek them , and still came back and roared again ; some spent their breath in impotent curses and execrations ; some pressed forward with the ecstasy of madmen , and thus impeded the progress of those below ; some among the boldest attempted to climb up by the water-spout and crevices in the wall ; and all waved to and fro , in the darkness beneath , like a field of corn moved by an angry wind : and joined from time to time in one loud furious roar .
__label__1	`` <NAME> , '' said I , `` do you remember , when we were overtaken by the thunder-storm , <NAME> 's speaking to you of her sister ? ''
__label__1	Happily for me , I am so much engaged that I have no time to think about it .
__label__0	<NAME> , which was reached the next day , is the last of the <NAME> missions on the <NAME> .
__label__0	The <NAME> never left him , continually seeking to prove to him the necessity of bringing the ships nearer to the land ; and when the admiral positively refused to consent to this , he declared him to be his prisoner .
__label__1	His picture , dark and gloomy , earnestly speechless on the wall , with the eyes intently looking at his son as they had looked when life departed from them , seemed to urge him awfully to the task he had attempted ; but as to any yielding on the part of his mother , he had now no hope , and as to any other means of setting his distrust at rest , he had abandoned hope a long time .
__label__1	<NAME> , <NAME> , I am sorely grieved to see in you more traces of a character as sullen , angry , and wild , as the night now closing in .
__label__0	That worthy fellow persisted in seeing in the <NAME> of the Nautilus one of those unknown _savants_ who return mankind contempt for indifference .
__label__1	And if passengers be decoyed in the way of trade , and people be inconvenienced in the way of trade , what man , who is a sharp tradesman himself , shall say , ‘ We must put a stop to this ? ’ Impressed by the deep solemnity of the public announcement , I ( being then ignorant of these usages ) was for hurrying on board in a breathless state , immediately ; but receiving private and confidential information that the boat would certainly not start until Friday , April the First , we made ourselves very comfortable in the mean while , and went on board at noon that day .
__label__0	His big , strong hand grasped the side , and at the risk of causing the boat to capsize , he hoisted himself up to the side , stepped over it , and sat down to draw his breath .
__label__1	‘ When a boy gets weak and ill and don ’ t relish his meals , we give him a change of diet -- turn him out , for an hour or so every day , into a neighbour ’ s turnip field , or sometimes , if it ’ s a delicate case , a turnip field and a piece of carrots alternately , and let him eat as many as he likes .
__label__1	‘ You have got good measure , <NAME> ; but the price is not so bad. -- And you , ’ said <NAME> , turning to the other visitor , ‘ do you buy anything here , miss ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , sir. ’ ‘ Nor sell anything neither , miss ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , sir. ’ Looking askew at the questioner , <NAME> stole her hand up to her friend ’ s , and drew her friend down , so that she bent beside her on her knee .
__label__0	Evidently , therefore , the most advisable plan was to sail directly for the bay of <NAME> , the <NAME> , the finest harbor on the <NAME> and one of the safest in the world .
__label__0	Shortly after passing the <NAME> , the corvette sighted <NAME> , which the inhabitants call <NAME> .
__label__1	Far from it. ’ ‘ Six children , sir ? ’ exclaimed <NAME> .
__label__0	The equilibrium of the balloon had been calculated at the level of the sea ; and , as the country was continually ascending , and had reached an elevation of from six to seven hundred feet , the balloon would have had a tendency to go lower than the surface of the soil itself .
__label__1	The door was opened , quickly , by some one shrouded in the darkness , and was as quickly closed , when they had passed out .

__label__1	A field-marshal has his uniform ; a bishop his silk apron ; a counsellor his silk gown ; a beadle his cocked hat .
__label__1	I find myself suddenly checked and stopped short , in the execution of my design , by a mystery which I can not penetrate .
__label__1	Oliver leaned his head upon his hand when the old man disappeared , and pondered , with a trembling heart , on the words he had just heard .
__label__0	“ By far the most prudent , ” said <NAME> .
__label__0	I had no idea which side he would take .
__label__0	“ In the house ? ” “ Yes ! ” All five advanced and indeed , through the window fronting them , they saw glimmering a feeble light .
__label__1	I ’ m a mother to both .
__label__1	‘ Ah ! ’ replied <NAME> , ‘ talk of the country , indeed !
__label__1	‘ I say nothing of his plea for claiming my confidence .
__label__1	Have you observed any gradual alteration in <NAME> ? ’ I had observed it , and had often wondered whether she had too .
__label__1	Every eye was fixed on <NAME> ’ s face .
__label__0	`` Besides , '' added <NAME> , `` may we not find in the sound some ship that has been forced to winter there . ''
__label__1	‘ The fact is -- but I have an appointment at the <NAME> , if you ’ ll have the goodness to excuse me. ’ With that he rose in a great hurry , and was going out of the room , when I made bold to say that I feared , then , there was no way of arranging the matter ?
__label__1	‘ We ’ ll go and look at ‘ em. ’ Away we went .
__label__0	The enormous mass as it passed grazed his chest , taking away his breath as though it had been a cannon-ball , then crushing to powder the flints on the road , it bounded into the abyss below .
__label__0	<NAME> of the inhabited earth in these unknown worlds he gathered incalculable treasures .
__label__0	And before that we have got _red_ and _let_ .
__label__1	<NAME> , having rambled through the handsome house , from room to room , seeks her own chamber , where the care of <NAME> has surrounded her with luxuries and comforts ; and divesting herself of her handsome dress , puts on her old simple mourning for dear <NAME> , and sits down to read , with <NAME> winking and blinking on the ground beside her .
__label__0	Full of spirits , the party left the Hive , and chattering and singing as they went , made their way down to the frozen shore , where they fastened on their skates .
__label__1	Mr Toots , who had been detained by an important letter from the <NAME> of <NAME> , found <NAME> out after a time ; and having looked at him for a long while , as before , inquired if he was fond of waistcoats .
__label__1	‘ We don ’ t know , ’ said <NAME> , answering this mute appeal aloud .
__label__0	His strength visibly returned , so vigorous was his constitution .
__label__1	Of all the world , unchanged .
__label__0	The reporter , therefore , thought it best to simply bathe the two wounds with cold water .
__label__1	When the executive perceived that <NAME> and his friends were disposed to resist the authority of the law , they very significantly turned up their coat sleeves , as if knocking them down in the first instance , and taking them up afterwards , were a mere professional act which had only to be thought of to be done , as a matter of course .
__label__0	replied the three members of the committee .
__label__1	There was another private house besides <NAME> ’ s in <NAME> ’ s Place : not to mention an immense Pair of gates , with an immense pair of lion-headed knockers on them , which were never opened by any chance , and were supposed to constitute a disused entrance to somebody ’ s stables .
__label__1	There was duty to be done , and it was done , but not harshly .
__label__1	Say the next day ! ’ I said the next day ; and he put on his great-coat and lighted his cigar , and set off to walk home .
__label__1	After two hours and a half of this odd travelling ( including a stoppage at a small town , where we were saluted by a gun considerably bigger than our own chimney ) , we reached <NAME> , and straightway repaired to an extremely comfortable hotel : except , as usual , in the article of bedrooms , which , in almost every place we visited , were very conducive to early rising .
__label__1	In fact , as to this question of opposition , the fair <NAME> 's observation was superfluous , <NAME> on these occasions always delivering in his own candidateship , as a kind of handsome wholesale order to be promptly executed .
__label__1	‘ Quite unnecessary , ’ replied <NAME> ; ‘ name them to me , and I can procure the attendance of a friend afterwards. ’ ‘ Shall we say -- sunset this evening ? ’ inquired the officer , in a careless tone .
__label__1	<NAME> Peggotty suggesting to me , in a whisper , what had already occurred to myself , I took out my purse ; but I could not prevail upon her to accept any money , nor could I exact any promise from her that she would do so at another time .
__label__0	<NAME> had succeeded in assembling together fifteen hundred artisans .
__label__1	The little dressmaker stood up at the foot of the bed , humming her song , and nodded to him brightly .
__label__1	What does it matter whether such a blighted life as mine comes to an end , now , next week , or next year ?
__label__0	The learned geographer was so lost in delight , that he seemed hardly to have started before they came in sight of the <NAME> camp , or <NAME> , situated in the heart of a valley .
__label__1	You know the horse-riders are famous for never minding what they say , ’ addressing <NAME> .
__label__1	Then he asked me to fetch some of the stuff he used , for the little hurt he had had , and to get it at the best place , which was at the other end of town from there ; and then , after kissing me again , he let me go .
__label__1	For <NAME> is as proud , <NAME> ’ am , ’ said the Major , ‘ as Lucifer. ’ ‘ A charming quality , ’ lisped <NAME> ; ‘ reminding one of dearest Edith. ’ ‘ Well , <NAME> ’ am , ’ said the Major .
__label__1	‘ If so be , ’ said the <NAME> to Mr Toots , with not a little shame and hesitation , ‘ as you ’ ll excuse my doing of it , brother. ’ ‘ Captain Gills , ’ returned Mr Toots , ‘ whatever you do , is satisfactory to me. ’ The <NAME> thanked him heartily , and promising to come back in less than five minutes , went out in quest of the person who had entrusted Mr Toots with this mysterious message .
__label__1	Is SHE working ? ’ ‘ She is , ’ says Veneering .
__label__0	A quarter of an hour afterward <NAME> was on board the jangada .
__label__0	From 1757 to 1804 it was only part of the captaincy which bears the name of the great river at whose mouth it is placed ; but since 1826 it has been the capital of the large province of <NAME> , borrowing its latest name from an <NAME> tribe which formerly existed in these parts of equatorial <NAME> .
__label__0	In short , they assigned all the reasons that people invent who have made up their minds to refuse .
__label__1	You gave me leave , at any time within a year , to renew the subject of our last discourse . '
__label__1	It did not pass away , as weightier things had done ; but came uppermost again , and yet again , and many times that day , and often afterwards .
__label__0	This important chain which separates <NAME> from <NAME> was still at a great distance , and they could not hope to reach it until the end of the day .
__label__1	Without mentioning any names or going into any details , I gave him to understand that if he was aware of anybody -- <NAME> , <NAME> , or <NAME> -- being about the chambers , or about the immediate neighborhood , he had better get <NAME> , <NAME> , or <NAME> out of the way while you were out of the way. ” “ He would be greatly puzzled what to do ? ” “ He was puzzled what to do ; not the less , because I gave him my opinion that it was not safe to try to get <NAME> , <NAME> , or <NAME> too far out of the way at present .
__label__0	<NAME> and nearer it came , but without noise , without sparks , without a trail , though its lower part was brighter than ever .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> might have asked with <NAME> ‘ into my grave ? ’ so chill and earthy was the place .
__label__1	He had to think , too , of Mr Toots , and Mr Feeder , <NAME> , of all the boys ; and of <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> ; of home , and of his aunt and <NAME> ; of his father ; <NAME> and <NAME> , <NAME> with the poor old Uncle who had got the money he wanted , and that gruff-voiced Captain with the iron hand .
__label__0	The window had hardly been open for longer than a second , yet that second had been enough to admit a terrible icy chill into the interior of the Projectile .
__label__1	I think she gave it him .
__label__1	At such times , he would look constantly round him , for fear of thieves , and would keep slapping all his pockets in turn , to see that he had n't lost anything , in such a very funny and natural manner , that <NAME> laughed till the tears ran down his face .
__label__1	Yes , they do happen to be bloody .
__label__0	There was none of the wild disorder and deafening tumult that usually accompany the discharge of volcanic matter , but the heated lava , rising with a uniform gentleness , quietly overran the limits of the crater , like the flow of water from the bosom of a peaceful lake .
__label__0	His faith in the engineer was complete ; nothing could disturb it .
__label__0	A grateful glance from <NAME> repaid <NAME> for the imprudence of her tongue .
__label__1	He , anything but a guide , a support , and a friend to me !
__label__1	I could eat nothing and could not sleep , and I grew so nervous under those delays and the slow pace at which we travelled that I had an unreasonable desire upon me to get out and walk .
__label__1	‘ Off with you ! ’ The boys applied whip and spur , the waiters shouted , the hostlers cheered , and away they went , fast and furiously .
__label__1	‘ Very sorry , ’ said the crestfallen <NAME> .
__label__0	During the day the different articles were carried to <NAME> , where they were methodically arranged in the great hall .
__label__0	No one suspected the odious part played by <NAME> ; no one guessed that the pretended courier of the <NAME> was a traitor .
__label__0	<NAME> Sounds. -- A Night Attack. -- <NAME> and <NAME> in the Tree. -- Two Shots. -- “ Help !
__label__1	Because , in minds that have been practically formed by rule and line , from the cradle upwards , this is so curious , so incomprehensible. ’ ‘ Stop a bit ! ’ cried <NAME> , who all this time had been standing , as before , on the hearth , bursting at the very furniture of the room with explosive humility .
__label__0	They wished to put some further questions to him .
__label__1	<NAME> ’ s very well as far as he goes , but the real friend is <NAME> -- not Short. ’ Eking out these professions with a number of benevolent and protecting looks and great fervour of manner , <NAME> stole away on tiptoe , leaving the child in a state of extreme surprise .
__label__0	There existed in the right side of the hill , as well as in the left , on either side of the fissure , certain winding passages , and it was by crawling along these in the darkness that <NAME> , <NAME> , and the others reached a cavity which let in light and air in abundance .
__label__0	The rain was not very heavy , but the wind was terrific .
__label__0	Next day the ceremony was to be continued by a holocaust of pigs .
__label__0	In the meantime M. de Chastes having died , his privilege was transferred to M. de <NAME> , with the title of Vice-admiral and Governor of <NAME> .
__label__0	“ I ’ ll pay the villains off ! ” cried the sailor , shaking his fist in a menacing manner .
__label__0	You know -- the three turtles that were in the boat .
__label__0	`` We will begin our researches as soon as possible .
__label__1	‘ Here is your letter , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	“ No , <NAME> , my dear , nor you ! ” He got his arm round her , and held her .
__label__0	laughed one of the group .
__label__1	I traced his progress downwards , step by step , until at last he reached that excess of destitution from which he never rose again .
__label__0	This latter plan met with the approval of <NAME> , and a decision once come to , not a moment was wasted .
__label__0	Was it simple chance which brought it to that part of the <NAME> , where the maps mentioned no land except <NAME> , which itself was out of the route usually followed by vessels from the <NAME> , from <NAME> , and from the <NAME> coast ?
__label__0	It was the body of a sailor about thirty years old , in a perfect state of preservation ; he wore the usual dress of <NAME> sailors ; the doctor could not say how long he had been dead .
__label__1	‘ What DID you do here when you were here before ? ’ asked <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ To our house , where you came this morning .
__label__0	The blocks were manufactured by <NAME> under <NAME> ’ s directions by means of the turning lathe .
__label__1	Only four of them passed .
__label__1	Do you hear me say he struck me ? ’ ‘ I hear , I hear , ’ replied one of those who held him .
__label__0	I remarked that my uncle , the Professor , had a strong tendency to resume his old impatient character , and I could not but make a note of this disagreeable circumstance in my journal .
__label__1	The old lady submitted to this piece of practical politeness with all the dignity which befitted so important and serious a solemnity , but the younger ladies , not being so thoroughly imbued with a superstitious veneration for the custom , or imagining that the value of a salute is very much enhanced if it cost a little trouble to obtain it , screamed and struggled , and ran into corners , and threatened and remonstrated , and did everything but leave the room , until some of the less adventurous gentlemen were on the point of desisting , when they all at once found it useless to resist any longer , and submitted to be kissed with a good grace .
__label__0	`` He came in order to be lost , '' answered <NAME> ; `` he brought his crew to death , like all those whose foolhardiness leads them here .
__label__1	Twice , <NAME> knocked with a careful hand , and listened .
__label__0	The bell-ringer has evidently lost his self-control .
__label__1	I don ’ t mean -- Heaven forbid ! -- that you intended it ; but you hardly know with what a sudden swing you removed yourself from me. ’ ‘ However ! ’ said the boy , taking no heed of the remonstrance , and pursuing his own mortified disappointment , ‘ I know what this means , and you shall not disgrace me. ’ ‘ It means what I have told you , <NAME> , and nothing more. ’ ‘ That ’ s not true , ’ said the boy in a violent tone , ‘ and you know it ’ s not .
__label__0	His face , usually so stolid , showed that something disturbed him .
__label__0	`` We had gone but a few paces , '' he says , `` when a noise from the forest struck upon our ears .
__label__1	We ’ ll drink the daisies of the field , in compliment to you ; and the lilies of the valley that toil not , neither do they spin , in compliment to me -- the more shame for me ! ’ A moody smile that had overspread his features cleared off as he said this merrily , and he was his own frank , winning self again .
__label__1	At length that low roar of many voices ran through the crowd which usually announces the arrival of whatever they have been waiting for .
__label__0	“ My Lord -- <NAME> ! ” she exclaimed , clasping her hands , “ I tell you my father is there !
__label__1	I was greatly dejected and distressed , but in an incoherent wholesale sort of way .
__label__1	Pity there was not a word of truth in that superstition about bodies bleeding when touched by the hand of the right person ; you never got a sign out of bodies .
__label__1	I am very , very sorry , dearest Pa , to have brought home all this trouble. ’ ‘ My pet , ’ returned her father , in the simplest good faith , ‘ don ’ t make yourself uneasy about that .
__label__1	‘ As thick , ’ repeated Mr Rugg , ‘ as we could reasonably have expected .
__label__1	The town was as entirely deserted as if the inhabitants had abandoned it , rather than hold communication with him .
__label__0	Nails and pieces of iron were much sought after by these people , whom <NAME> likens to the natives of Noukha-Hiva .
__label__0	The gallery now began to trend downwards in a horizontal direction , with about two inches of fall in every furlong .
__label__1	‘ Although I found that the necessity for self-command and restraint became every day more imperious , and the difficulty greater , I never , for one instant , spoke or looked but as I would have done had you been by .
__label__1	It was nearly nine o ’ clock when he reached <NAME> .
__label__0	When the high temperature of the oven had reduced it to a liquid , or rather a pasty state , <NAME> collected with the tube a quantity of the paste , he turned it about on a metal plate previously arranged so as to give it a form suitable for blowing , then he passed the tube to <NAME> , telling him to blow at the other extremity .
__label__1	Blowed if I shouldn ’ t have left out lakes , never having clapped eyes upon one , to my knowledge .
__label__0	`` And where is he now ? ''
__label__0	`` You will not permit it ? ''
__label__1	‘ My dear , ’ said <NAME> , leading her towards me , ‘ here is a gentleman of the name of <NAME> , who wishes to renew his acquaintance with you. ’ It would have been better , as it turned out , to have led gently up to this announcement , for Mrs. Micawber , being in a delicate state of health , was overcome by it , and was taken so unwell , that <NAME> was obliged , in great trepidation , to run down to the water-butt in the backyard , and draw a basinful to lave her brow with .
__label__0	They gazed , and hoped , and even felt refreshed by the breath of the tempest .
__label__0	`` At last , her influence prevailed , and <NAME> , in exchange for what he could tell , proposed that <NAME> should leave him on some island in the <NAME> , instead of giving him up to the <NAME> authorities .
__label__0	The submarine flora struck me as being very perfect , and richer even than it would have been in the arctic or tropical zones , where these productions are not so plentiful .
__label__1	‘ When I was last here , ’ I faltered , ‘ Miss <NAME> told me he was sailing here and there .
__label__1	‘ Secondly , isn ’ t Fledgeby both Pubsey and Co. ? ’ The old man answered with a reluctant nod .
__label__1	But you shall see him in his own home , and then you 'll understand him better .
__label__0	This temperature is only the temperature produced by the radiation of the stars ; that is to say , what the terrestrial globe would undergo if the sun disappeared one day . ''
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> raised its white peaks towards the sky ; the snow and mist exaggerated its size so that it appeared colossal ; the temperature remained a few degrees above the freezing-point ; cascades and cataracts appeared on the sides of the mountain ; avalanches kept falling with a roar like that of artillery .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> sat in the workhouse parlour , with his eyes moodily fixed on the cheerless grate , whence , as it was summer time , no brighter gleam proceeded , than the reflection of certain sickly rays of the sun , which were sent back from its cold and shining surface .
__label__0	<NAME> being aware of this , hurried the embarkation of his provisions , and set sail after an interval of twelve days .
__label__1	Some of the luggage , however , piled against the panels , soon settled this difficulty , and my sleep would not have been very much affected that night , I believe , though it had failed to do so .
__label__1	What should I gain by that , and how much should I lose ! ’ <NAME> ’ s expressive little eyebrows remonstrated with the fire for some short time before she rejoined : ‘ <NAME> ’ t think that I press you , <NAME> ; but wouldn ’ t you gain in peace , and hope , and even in freedom ?
__label__0	The grief of <NAME> and his companions , who were all strongly attached to the intrepid Harding , can be better pictured than described .
__label__1	Others drew forth , with clashing noise , upon the ground , great sheets of glowing steel , emitting an insupportable heat , and a dull deep light like that which reddens in the eyes of savage beasts .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> then added that he had obtained a special podorojna for <NAME> , and that the <NAME> authorities could in no way hinder his progress .
__label__0	And under these lines was a name , a signature , the name of <NAME> !
__label__0	This is by no means the only point upon which the <NAME> navigator differs from <NAME> .
__label__1	She might have been , but that was past !
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> , sitting in the twilight by the open window , enjoys his wine .
__label__1	When he had said goodbye all round and came to <NAME> , he could not but mark the difference between their present separation and their parting at <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> , satisfied , expresses high approval and awaits her coming at the door .
__label__0	`` Ah , vivacious and ardent youth ! ''
__label__0	In a few moments this prayer would ascend to the feet of the <NAME> .
__label__1	This gained upon me as we went along ; so that the nearer we drew , the more familiar the objects became that we passed , the more excited I was to get there , and to run into her arms .
__label__1	‘ Thou changest me from bad to good .
__label__0	He was a mining engineer of about five and thirty years of age .
__label__0	Passing the mountainous district of <NAME> , where coffee is cultivated , after a month 's delay at <NAME> on account of illness , <NAME> entered <NAME> , the capital of <NAME> , which he calls the most beautiful city of the <NAME> , on the 2nd of June .
__label__0	“ The death of the sacrilegious , my friends , ” replied <NAME> .
__label__1	But speaking of this trespass -- with apologies to <NAME> and <NAME> for the length at which I have pursued so dry a subject -- is there nothing for me from your men <NAME> and <NAME> ? ''
__label__0	You stick at nothing. ” “ Major , will you bet your Purdy-Moore rifle against my telescope ? ” “ Why not , <NAME> , if it would give you any pleasure. ” “ Done , <NAME> ! ” exclaimed <NAME> .
__label__1	Among other havens of domestic tranquillity and peace of mind , my feet will naturally tend towards the King ’ s <NAME> .
__label__0	It required two persons to eat a strawberry , and four to consume a pear .
__label__1	By all means ! ’ Assuming , with a shiver of resignation , a deadly cheerfulness .
__label__1	<NAME> looks from <NAME> to the woman , and from the woman to <NAME> , waiting for one of them to unravel the riddle .
__label__1	Stooping again to come out at the low-arched door , they left it burning , and retraced their way to the courtyard ; seeming to recover their sense of hearing as they came down , until they were in the raging flood once more .
__label__0	In <NAME> , on the contrary , we find roughness , and a harsh , unsympathizing way of feeling , while his chivalrous qualities disappear entirely behind the rapacity and perfidy which are the salient features of his character .
__label__1	‘ Poor , poor Walter ! ’ sighed <NAME> .
__label__0	Have you -- ” “ To whom have we the honor of speaking ? ” at last interposed <NAME> , in the coldest and most measured tone , and drawing himself up to his full height .
__label__1	You can hear that , miss ? ” “ I can hear , ” said <NAME> , seeing that he spoke to her , “ nothing .
__label__1	‘ Where might it be deposited at present ? ’ asked Mr Boffin , in a wheedling tone .
__label__1	What is the matter with you ? ’ While <NAME> raised up the collector , <NAME> had performed the same office for <NAME> , who now regarded his late adversary in tipsy amazement .
__label__1	In this way they travelled on until near midnight , when they stopped to supper , for which meal the single gentleman ordered everything eatable that the house contained ; and because <NAME> ’ s mother didn ’ t eat everything at once , and eat it all , he took it into his head that she must be ill. ‘ You ’ re faint , ’ said the single gentleman , who did nothing himself but walk about the room .
__label__1	“ I am a <NAME> , ” said <NAME> , “ I am desperate .
__label__1	The bride ’ s father , our good friend there , is a noble person , and I am proud to know him ( great uproar ) .
__label__0	The two preaching friars were so discouraged at this outset of the expedition that they gave up all idea of going to <NAME> , and left the two Venetians and <NAME> to prosecute the journey together as best they could .
__label__1	Again they went all round the room , scarcely heeding <NAME> if at all , and returned to that corner .
__label__1	That ’ s all. ’ With that , and ‘ Good night , ’ the Secretary lowers the window , and disappears .
__label__1	Mr F. ’ s Aunt holding out like a grim fortress , and <NAME> becoming in need of refreshment , a messenger was despatched to the hotel for the tumbler already glanced at , which was afterwards replenished .
__label__0	The most important places passed en route by <NAME> were <NAME> , a densely populated town , the inhabitants of which had been sold as slaves by the <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , the capital of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and the wells of <NAME> , where he met an escort sent by the sultan .
__label__0	One day in the island , three or four to return , they might hope therefore that on the 17th they would again reach <NAME> .
__label__0	`` On the contrary , '' said <NAME> , imitating the tone and gestures of the president , `` on the contrary , when the visible face of the moon is lit by the sun , it is because the moon is full , that is to say , opposite the sun with regard to the earth .
__label__1	Something of distrust lingered about him still ; for he would often come , even in the dark evenings , and call in a timid voice outside the door to know if she were safe within ; and being answered yes , and bade to enter , would take his station on a low stool at her feet , and sit there patiently until they came to seek , and take him home .
__label__0	<NAME> was so abundant that one man alone could collect enough of it in ten days to fill a measure .
__label__0	“ <NAME> , ” said he , “ can you restrain your impatience for one hour only ? ” “ But , captain , just think !
__label__0	I even hesitated to tell you any thing about it , for fear of exciting your regret ! ” “ What ! ” said <NAME> , again , “ abandon these treasures -- a fortune for us ! -- really for us -- our own -- leave it behind ! ” “ Take care , my friend !
__label__1	He saw us , as we took leave of each other .
__label__0	answered the <NAME> of <NAME> .
__label__0	The smoking crater presented the appearance of a hollow sulphurous semi-circle about 1200 feet wide and 300 feet deep , covered with the débris of pumice and other stones .
__label__1	<NAME> evening , citizen , ” filling his glass .
__label__1	‘ I ’ ll tell you how I did it , ’ said the delighted <NAME> , putting his hair into a condition as elevated as himself .
__label__0	The next day , March 26th , I resumed my miner 's work in beginning the fifth yard .
__label__1	You ’ ll be hurt. ’ ‘ Wait one instant , <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> looked after Mr Baps when he went to cheer up Mrs Baps ( who , being quite deserted , was pretending to look over the music-book of the gentleman who played the harp ) , as if he thought him a remarkable kind of man ; and shortly afterwards he said so in those words to <NAME> , and inquired if he might take the liberty of asking who he was , and whether he had ever been in the <NAME> of <NAME> .
__label__0	Then <NAME> gave him a letter from the king and queen , couched in the following terms : -- `` <NAME> , our Admiral in the ocean , `` We have ordered <NAME> Bovadilla to explain to you our intentions .
__label__0	Were not these facts providential ?
__label__0	`` Does that astonish you , my boy ? ''
__label__1	‘ Why are you tearing about the streets , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ in this improper manner ? ’ ‘ I was—I was run after , sir , ’ the girl panted , ‘ and I wanted to get away. ’ ‘ Run after ? ’ repeated <NAME> .
__label__0	“ Courage , my friends ! ” cried <NAME> ; “ courage !
__label__0	It must not be supposed that the doctor could entirely extinguish his cylinder , during these halts .
__label__1	You mustn ’ t show yourself to him , child .
__label__0	There were deodars , <NAME> firs , casuarinas , gum trees , eucalypti , hibiscus , cedars , and other trees , generally of a moderate size , for their number prevented their growth .
__label__0	A difficulty about this , however , presented itself .
__label__0	On the sea shore , a low land covered with trees and shrubs , the balmy odours of which reached the ships , rose like an amphitheatre towards the mountains , whose summits were lost in the skies .
__label__0	May reflection and repentance bring him to a better mind ! ” But before <NAME> was transferred , <NAME> wished to do the honors of his rock to his friends .
__label__1	'If it be painful to him , ' she thought , 'to come back here , how painful it will be to me !
__label__0	Upon the evening of the 27th a sudden squall was followed by a rising wind , which carried the vessel straight to the Cape .
__label__1	Self-elected saints with gloomy brows , this sightless , earless , voiceless child may teach you lessons you will do well to follow .
__label__1	‘ Well , now I look at him closely , there _is_ a likeness. ’ ‘ We were always considered like each other , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , with a cunning look just lurking in the corners of his eyes , ‘ only I was really of a serious nature , and he never was .
__label__1	Finding all remonstrances unavailing , <NAME> pulled his hat firmly on , threw his father ’ s coat over his arm , and taking the old man round the waist , forcibly dragged him down the ladder , and into the street ; never releasing his hold , or permitting him to stop , until they reached the corner .
__label__1	Mrs <NAME> was a meek woman , of a fair complexion , with her eyebrows always elevated , and her head always drooping ; who was always ready to pity herself , or to be pitied , or to pity anybody else ; and who had a surprising natural gift of viewing all subjects in an utterly forlorn and pitiable light , and bringing dreadful precedents to bear upon them , and deriving the greatest consolation from the exercise of that talent .
__label__1	‘ Not at all , <NAME> , not at all , ’ returned the other haughtily .
__label__1	If he be seeking his own star as he methodically turns and turns upon the leads , it should be but a pale one to be so rustily represented below .
__label__1	A murmur of voices had been audible on the outside , and , at the moment of our entrance , a clapping of hands : which latter noise , I was surprised to see , proceeded from the generally disconsolate Mrs. Gummidge .
__label__0	But we must consider that delicate question with the <NAME> .
__label__0	The colonists had reached the bottom of the basalt cliff .
__label__1	By and by , I saw him , with the majority of a lobster on his plate , eating his dinner at the feet of <NAME> !
__label__0	Consequently , he called together such of his colleagues as were at the moment in <NAME> , and without any expression of his own opinions simply read to them the laconic text itself .
__label__0	But an unforeseen circumstance , viz. , the detonation produced by the <NAME> , had the immediate effect of troubling the terrestrial atmosphere , by accumulating a large quantity of vapor , a phenomenon which excited universal indignation , for the moon was hidden from the eyes of the watchers for several nights .
__label__0	The voice which had pronounced the words , “ Well repaid ! ” was that of no other than <NAME> .

__label__0	`` Is there any news about the captain ? ''
__label__1	‘ When he was waiting to be the object of your munificence , so freely bestowed for my sake , and when I was unhappy in the mercenary shape I was made to wear , I thought it would have become him better to have worked his own way on .
__label__1	A dismal swamp , on which the half-built houses rot away : cleared here and there for the space of a few yards ; and teeming , then , with rank unwholesome vegetation , in whose baleful shade the wretched wanderers who are tempted hither , droop , and die , and lay their bones ; the hateful Mississippi circling and eddying before it , and turning off upon its southern course a slimy monster hideous to behold ; a hotbed of disease , an ugly sepulchre , a grave uncheered by any gleam of promise : a place without one single quality , in earth or air or water , to commend it : such is this dismal Cairo .
__label__1	‘ Time was , ’ he said , ‘ when it was well to watch even your rising little star , and know in what quarter there were clouds , to shadow you if needful .
__label__0	A current in the lake runs along by the upper bank to the mouth of the <NAME> ; this current they hoped to utilize , and with its assistance to reach the outlet of <NAME> .
__label__0	Her powerful machinery was brought to bear upon the hauling-chains .
__label__1	“ This , ” said she , pointing to the long table with her stick , “ is where I will be laid when I am dead .
__label__1	I have ever since connected the feeling with that spot and time and with everything associated with that spot and time , to the distant voices in the town , the barking of a dog , and the sound of wheels coming down the miry hill .
__label__1	Yes , <NAME> told this gentleman to look sharp , and he not only said he would look sharp , but he actually did , and presently came running back with the newest loaves , and the freshest butter , and the largest oysters , ever seen .
__label__0	<NAME> was at the helm .
__label__1	My poor dear Alfred , who is greatly worried just now about his affairs , went out rather early .
__label__0	The worn-out horses had stretched themselves full length on the ground , except <NAME> , who slept standing , true to his high blood , proud in repose as in action , and ready to start at his master ’ s call .
__label__1	He was a <NAME> , or something of that sort , if I am not mistaken .
__label__1	‘ Well , well ! ’ returned <NAME> , with a patient , even a submissive , air .
__label__1	When they were all drawn back , it was found to be locked , and worst of all , the key was gone .
__label__1	She looked at her watch , and it was twenty minutes past two .
__label__0	<NAME> gave the name of <NAME> to this harbour of refuge , which he left on the morning of the 23rd of July .
__label__1	I declare here ’ s some one else .
__label__1	There used to be a poem when I learnt lessons , something about Lo the poor Indians whose something mind !
__label__0	<NAME> silence reigned in the corral .
__label__1	Accordingly , <NAME> , as the man who has the greatest reputation to sustain , becomes the interpreter of the general instinct .
__label__0	After pondering one day , he said : “ It seems to me , captain , that you have turned into <NAME> , and that I am your man Friday .
__label__0	“ <NAME> , ” said he , “ we left <NAME> without permission from the authorities !
__label__1	Let me look at you .
__label__1	His hair still hung in curls about his face , and his eyes were very bright ; but their light was of <NAME> , not earth .
__label__1	If <NAME> would have the distinguished goodness to occupy the other salon especially reserved for him , for but five minutes , all would go well .
__label__0	I thanked <NAME> , and went up to the shelves of the library .
__label__0	Each day <NAME> and <NAME> ascended the plateau of <NAME> .
__label__1	Here , for example , I have been speaking to you this morning about tumblers .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> could not help looking attentively at his newly-arrived fellow-traveler .
__label__1	There 's more where that come from .
__label__1	Besides , my dearest <NAME> will be her natural and constant guardian when you return , and I had better not encroach upon her trust , perhaps .
__label__1	Here , <NAME> -- <NAME> -- take these things away , and open another bottle -- d ’ ye hear ? ’ The fat boy rose , opened his eyes , swallowed the huge piece of pie he had been in the act of masticating when he last fell asleep , and slowly obeyed his master ’ s orders -- gloating languidly over the remains of the feast , as he removed the plates , and deposited them in the hamper .
__label__1	<NAME> sought to learn their secret ; sought to find out what it was she had missed ; what simple art they knew , and she knew not ; how she could be taught by them to show her father that she loved him , and to win his love again .
__label__0	`` Breakfast , '' answered the cool , audacious <NAME> , who always brought up this solution at the most difficult juncture .
__label__0	All along this land there are other inhabited islands .
__label__1	Such an honour and pleasure -- it ’ s both , <NAME> ’ s mother , it ’ s both -- is not to be forgotten so soon .
__label__1	there ’ s no accounting for tastes ; ’ but the ladies resolved unanimously that <NAME> had an aristocratic air ; and nobody caring to dispute the position , it was established triumphantly .
__label__0	From this point , by following the right bank of the watercourse , they would arrive at the spurs of <NAME> , among which they would naturally seek a retreat , and they could not have been long in discovering the corral , then uninhabited .
__label__0	Here he was abandoned by his negro servants , who were unwilling to accompany him to the country of the Moors .
__label__1	The means of happiness are on the cards and the dice .
__label__0	It was under these circumstances that the young girl undertook her father 's conversion ; and her influence was so effective that the old watchmaker promised to attend high mass at the cathedral on the following Sunday .
__label__0	A second flash of lightning rent the darkness , and was followed by a score of others in quick succession .
__label__1	So powerfully was his imagination impressed by it , that when his driver stopped , after having asked the way more than once , and said to the best of his belief this was the gateway they wanted , Mr <NAME> stood hesitating , with the coach-door in his hand , half afraid of the dark look of the place .
__label__1	‘ Em ’ ly is like me , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ and would like to see him. ’ Em ’ ly was confused by our all observing her , and hung down her head , and her face was covered with blushes .
__label__0	August 18th , <NAME> was sighted through the mist , and the next day the <NAME> cast anchor in <NAME> Bay .
__label__0	If the carpenter , the only healthy man on board , did not succeed in perfectly stopping it , he at least considerably diminished it .
__label__0	The doctor saw himself kept within doors , and he folded his arms ; there was nothing to be done , except every hour to clear away the entrance-hall and to repolish the ice-walls which the heat within made damp ; but the snow-house was very finely built , and the snow added to its resistance by augmenting the thickness of its walls .
__label__0	And now , after _a_ or _o , _ what are the letters which figure oftenest in our language ?
__label__1	Then Mrs Bangham , long popular medium of communication with the outer world , began to be infirm , and to be found oftener than usual comatose on pavements , with her basket of purchases spilt , and the change of her clients ninepence short .
__label__0	<NAME> ’ s and <NAME> ’ s rifles then spoke , and no doubt imparted some very disagreeable intelligence to two of the convicts , for they fell backwards .
__label__1	‘ What ’ s this ? ’ said the single gentleman thrusting out his head .
__label__0	In vain <NAME> tried to calm <NAME> , whose head seemed on fire .
__label__1	A sad and desolate place it was , a gloomy , sorrowful place that gave me a strange sensation of mournfulness and even dread .
__label__1	There is a splendid wedding in the church .
__label__1	<NAME> , my dear young friend , with three lumps of sugar to the tumbler. ’ ‘ Wery sorry to say , sir , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ that they don ’ t allow that particular wanity to be sold in this here establishment. ’ ‘ Oh , the hardness of heart of these inveterate men ! ’ ejaculated <NAME> .
__label__0	Then her chattering was heard in all the streets of the neighbourhood , where she had long been known .
__label__1	Let us find my brother. ’ ‘ Not yet .
__label__1	So powerful is use , and so desirable to be good use in the beginning .
__label__1	He had read many books ; and <NAME> ’ s poetry appeared to have left a strong impression on his mind : especially the opening of The <NAME> of the <NAME> , and the great battle scene in <NAME> , in which , no doubt from the congeniality of the subjects to his own pursuits and tastes , he had great interest and delight .
__label__1	‘ Perhaps , ’ he returned , ‘ I have said enough .
__label__0	They slid rather than walked down the spur , that their figures might be lost in the dark mass of the mountain .
__label__1	I had barely time to get down again before the coach started , and I could hardly see the family for the handkerchiefs they waved .
__label__0	A frightful death was in store for them , since they must either be devoured by the fire or by the caimans .
__label__1	He had no wife to call in and astonish , so he rang the bell for his servant .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , ’ said Mr Dombey , ‘ this is my daughter Florence .
__label__1	This , my young companion -- ’ ‘ Stop a bit , ’ interposed <NAME> .
__label__1	He had not previously uttered a word .
__label__0	He reflected an instant and replied , -- “ Two cables lengths at the most. ” “ But what is a cable ’ s length ? ” asked <NAME> .
__label__1	A <NAME> Day and <NAME> Still impassive , as behoves its breeding , the <NAME> town house carries itself as usual towards the street of dismal grandeur .
__label__1	<NAME> had said , when he stayed there for an hour , en route , and left the letter for <NAME> -- <NAME> had received it surely ? ’ ‘ Yes. ’ ‘ A thousand pardons !
__label__1	You needn ’ t direct your glances towards me , ’ said Mrs. Wititterly , with a sudden burst of spite ; ‘ I am not <NAME> , no , nor <NAME> , <NAME> , nor am I <NAME> , nor <NAME> either. ’ <NAME> looked at her again , but less steadily than before ; and resting her elbow on the table , covered her eyes with her hand .
__label__1	If he had been in <NAME> indeed , and the time had been sunset , and the scene a stately terrace !
__label__1	As <NAME> walked on , and the voice drew nearer , he found it proceeded from a small boy , who was hurrying along , to join one of the little parties in the old street , and who , partly to keep himself company , and partly to prepare himself for the occasion , was shouting out the song at the highest pitch of his lungs .
__label__0	Why should it sink into craters ?
__label__1	At least , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ you are known to be alive and unharmed .
__label__0	The very man whose office it had been contemplated to suppress for ten years .
__label__0	On a nearer approach <NAME> found himself in view of a low , flat country of somewhat barren aspect .
__label__0	At length the difficulty of obtaining provisions , the rain , and the continual alarm in which the firing of the <NAME> kept them , induced the islanders to offer terms of peace .
__label__1	Then , <NAME> sat up and took a long look at his figure , and then cried : ‘ Hi -- I -- i !
__label__1	‘ It was pretty far in the night , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ when she asked me for some drink ; and when she had taken it , gave me such a patient smile , the dear ! -- so beautiful !
__label__0	<NAME> folded his arms stoically , and said not a word .
__label__1	I wanted to persuade <NAME> to come and see <NAME> , but on my proposing it she ran off to her own room and locked herself in ; so I went to Traddles without her , and walked away with him on air .
__label__0	At a quarter to twelve the sun , then seen only by refraction , looked like a golden disc shedding its last rays upon this deserted continent and seas which never man had yet ploughed .
__label__0	They had also to be careful not to fall into one or other of them , which would have been both dangerous and humiliating ; to be taken in their own snares !
__label__1	Sometimes , I had proceeded restlessly from place to place , stopping nowhere ; sometimes , I had lingered long in one spot .
__label__0	<NAME> , delighted at having found her again , approached the girl .
__label__1	I did see from the first , that there was no affection on your part for Mr Dombey -- how could it possibly exist between such different subjects ?
__label__0	But <NAME> could not continue the struggle any longer .
__label__0	“ Yes , <NAME> , quite that number. ” “ Farther still , Paganel. ” “ If you doubt me , I can give you the names. ” “ Oh , oh , ” said the Major , coolly .
__label__0	Now you come to tell me that the bearer of this letter is in my power .
__label__0	The aeronauts remained as they were , completely motionless , and lost not a detail of the populous city .
__label__0	They were not men to mind the wind tearing at their hair , nor the rain wetting them to the skin , and a blow from a hammer is worth just as much in bad as in fine weather .
__label__1	‘ My brother and I are just the same .
__label__1	It ’ s a great deal worse than <NAME> ’ s. ’ Captain Cuttle , without altering his position , signed to Mr Toots not to mind him ; and presently turned round , with his glazed hat thrust back upon his ears , and his hand composing and smoothing his brown face .
__label__1	The first time he came to our old place was when my father was alive .
__label__0	The season must have been abnormally advanced , for although we continued to see a vast number of testaceans , we did not catch sight of a single whaling-ship in all this fishing-ground .
__label__1	It was , to conceal what had occurred , from those who were going away ; and to dismiss them on their voyage in happy ignorance .
__label__0	<NAME> as were their actual discoveries , their rectification of the errors of their predecessors were of yet greater value .
__label__1	Not troubled by any such weak imagining , <NAME> merely speculated on the time of life at which his beard had begun , and thought once more what a good ‘ un he was for the part .
__label__1	Without saying a word , she walked up with a cordial face , shook hands with him , and patted him on the arm .
__label__0	Judging by appearances , we of the present day know much more on this subject than did the fellow-countrymen and contemporaries of <NAME> .
__label__0	Through the panel of the saloon I saw the bottom of the rocks brilliantly lit up by our electric lamp .
__label__1	Fortified by such encouragement , he could venture to say <NAME> ; and now <NAME> ’ s mind was relieved .
__label__1	That done , he replaced the candle and took the hand again .
__label__0	The blazing head of the great bolt that rivets the lunar hemispheres in union inseverable ?
__label__1	And gradually , what I had done at random , seemed to shape itself into a purpose , <NAME> ” “ What purpose ? ” the spy asked .
__label__0	You must aid me with your advice , your experience ! ''
__label__1	At length he went back again , and took the road which leads from <NAME> to <NAME> .
__label__1	Mr Lillyvick ? ’ It was , indeed , the collector of water-rates who , regarding Nicholas with a fixed look and immovable countenance , shook hands with most portentous solemnity , and sat himself down in a seat by the chimney-corner .
__label__1	said the Jew , seizing the Dodger tightly by the collar , and threatening him with horrid imprecations .
__label__1	Thus it was , however ; and the last drop of blood having been extracted from the flints , and the last screw of the rack having been turned so often that its purchase crumbled , and it now turned and turned with nothing to bite , <NAME> began to run away from a phenomenon so low and unaccountable .
__label__1	Such a man came upon him , like a ghost , at noon in the July weather , as he sat on his heap of stones under a bank , taking such shelter as he could get from a shower of hail .
__label__0	Her smoke was lost in the morning mist .
__label__0	`` Well , at noon we shall see the point . ''
__label__0	“ We shall finish it , ” he said to the engineer , “ we shall finish it , captain , and it is time , for the season is advancing and the equinox will soon be here .
__label__1	) , that I think she may come , on his account , to be kind to me. ’ I fathomed the depth of the rascal ’ s whole scheme , and understood why he laid it bare .
__label__1	Looking round , he beholds the young man of the name of <NAME> , much discomfited and not presenting a very impressive letter of introduction in his manner and appearance .
__label__1	Go away ! ’ Dear Mr Clennam , As I said in my last that it was best for nobody to write to me , and as my sending you another little letter can therefore give you no other trouble than the trouble of reading it ( perhaps you may not find leisure for even that , though I hope you will some day ) , I am now going to devote an hour to writing to you again .
__label__1	<NAME> ’ t let him come up till I ’ ve got away .
__label__1	<NAME> ’ s <NAME> is the name Mrs <NAME> christened it when we come into it as a property .
__label__1	One timid look around -- one moment 's pause of hesitation -- he had closed it behind him , and was in the open street .
__label__1	said the doctor , laying <NAME> gently down again .
__label__1	‘ In-deed ! ’ rejoined <NAME> , cringing excessively .
__label__1	All right ! ’ But appearing to be incensed by imaginary contradiction , or other ill-usage , Mr F. ’ s <NAME> , instead of relapsing into silence , made the following additional proclamation : ‘ I hate a fool ! ’ She imparted to this sentiment , in itself almost <NAME> , so extremely injurious and personal a character by levelling it straight at the visitor ’ s head , that it became necessary to lead Mr F. ’ s <NAME> from the room .
__label__1	Another thing in <NAME> that I could not understand when it first began to develop itself , but which I soon arrived at a sorrowful comprehension of , was this : As I became stronger and better , <NAME> became a little less easy with me .
__label__1	‘ Get down to life ! ’ Mr Fledgeby seemed to think it rather a good suggestion , and with a nod turned round .
__label__0	This was the cause of the accumulation of ice , which became gradually soldered together , under the double influence of the increased pressure and of the cold .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> has improved even in this little time , I have no doubt , ’ said <NAME> , glancing proudly at her daughter .
__label__1	As I rode back in the lonely night , the wind going by me like a restless memory , I thought of this , and feared she was not happy .
__label__0	I would have fled from him , but it was impossible , so narrowly did he watch me .
__label__0	The <NAME> was once again in motion , and both the doctor and <NAME> awoke .
__label__0	The volcano rocked and trembled with the convulsions of internal disturbance , and <NAME> and his companions , convinced that the mountain was doomed to some sudden disruption , rushed into the open air .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> shakes his head .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> found himself twenty hours behind time .
__label__1	That he must know of <NAME> ’ s abrupt departure , and that he must divine its cause , was not to be doubted .
__label__0	Many others succumbed , and twelve only returned from the expedition .
__label__0	From November to March the sky is always cloudless , and a constant south wind prevails , as the coast is sheltered by the mountain range of the Andes .
__label__0	The heath began to show timidly its little pale , rosy flowers .
__label__0	But that distant echo was the only response produced by <NAME> ’ s shouts , while a heavy gloom hung over all the part east of the island .
__label__0	I wish we were there now !
__label__0	The mariner 's compasses were also found to be quite free from injury .
__label__0	This was an essential condition to the success of the enterprise , and continued actively to engage the public attention .
__label__1	If you ’ ll give me a look-in in the forenoon , you shall know what I have heerd ; but tell the young woman from <NAME> ’ en <NAME> , that it ’ s over .
__label__1	You shall go by the way we have come , and I will go forward by the path .
__label__0	At last the <NAME> said , addressing <NAME> : “ Then you have no hope whatever ? ” “ None , ” was the reply .
__label__0	One fact is worthy of notice ; he was recommended to show the greatest respect towards <NAME> , at the very time when his brother <NAME> was arrested and thrown into a prison , where he was destined to remain forgotten for twenty years .
__label__1	I want you to burn something for me. ’ ‘ What ? ’ ‘ Only this folded paper .
__label__1	I have been under a Taboo in that infernal scoundrel ’ s service .
__label__1	He acquiescing , we followed at a distance : never losing sight of her , but never caring to come very near , as she frequently looked about .
__label__1	'He hung about , not to come over here afore dark , but he 'll be here soon , ' replied <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Mississes , <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> , with an alarming frown .
__label__1	‘ “ A man , ” replied the figure .
__label__1	He could have laid hands upon himself for his cowardice , but it was the very shadow of his defeat , and could not be separated from it .
__label__1	And , although I trembled for the agony it might one day be to him to have his strong assurance shivered at a blow , there was something so religious in it , so affectingly expressive of its anchor being in the purest depths of his fine nature , that the respect and honour in which I held him were exalted every day .
__label__0	An <NAME> and a <NAME> both together in the midst of the wilderness ! ” “ And the whole of it is to remain useless ! ” “ Perhaps !
__label__1	‘ “ However , ” said the old gentleman , “ that ’ s not the point .
__label__0	<NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , all ask this favor , that we should accompany them .
__label__0	`` We can not tell whom we shall have to deal with , '' said <NAME> .
__label__0	`` That is foreseen , '' replied <NAME> .
__label__1	The blood has not flushed into his face so suddenly and redly for many a long year as when he recognizes <NAME> .
__label__0	These might be safely recomputed without doing > violence to the spirit of the original work .
__label__0	“ Ay , sir , a <NAME> , ” said <NAME> .
__label__0	Moreover <NAME> had collected a vast number of interesting observations on natural history , physical geography , astronomy , and the new science of anthropology , then in its earliest infancy .
__label__0	The horn of retreat for him had sounded ; he was about to be replaced at <NAME> by a younger missionary , and he was preparing to return to <NAME> , to end his days in one of those convents which are reserved for the old servants of God .
__label__1	There were some trifles there -- poor useless things -- that she would have liked to take away ; but that was impossible .
__label__0	The naval doctors , <NAME> and <NAME> , were placed in charge of the natural history department , whilst the staff was composed of officers most remarkable for their scientific attainments , among whom may be mentioned MM .
__label__0	However , after two hours , appearing to have formed a resolution , he came to find <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> J. T. <NAME> given this unexpected news to the world ?
__label__1	He is a cordial young fellow , and we will have him to meet the brother and sister at dinner .
__label__1	‘ As I ’ ve told you , <NAME> , I ’ ve the best of friends .
__label__0	Whether it was a passage or no , it mattered little ; it was at least a refuge ; and , driven by wind and wave , the <NAME> , under the dexterous guidance of the lieutenant , dashed in between its perpendicular walls .
__label__1	When we rejoined him in the drawing-room he said he would give us a little ballad which had come into his head `` apropos of our young friend , '' and he sang one about a peasant boy , `` Thrown on the wide world , doomed to wander and roam , <NAME> of his parents , bereft of a home . ''
__label__1	So many hundred Hands in this <NAME> ; so many hundred horse <NAME> .
__label__0	This fish was of an unknown species , having a body like a great eel , and upon the back of his head a very tenacious skin , in fashion like a purse , wherewith to take the fishes .
__label__0	<NAME> 's confused replies , and the half-broiled head of a man , found by <NAME> in a pirogue in <NAME> , placed the existence of this barbarous practice beyond the possibility of doubt .
__label__1	‘ O , nowhere in particular , ’ replied <NAME> , a little put out as it seemed by the question ; ‘ I ’ m only anxious that you should think me so , and do me justice .
__label__0	This archipelago was discovered by <NAME> , an <NAME> , and <NAME> , an Englishman , jointly , in 1821-22 .
__label__1	My handkerchief wo n't hurt you . ''
__label__0	The inspector read the permit with attention .
__label__1	The two days became three , and the three days became four .
__label__1	“ Do you ? ” “ Ca n't say , ” said I. I felt here , through a tingling in my blood , that if <NAME> 's shoulder had claimed another hair 's breadth of room , I should have jerked him into the window ; equally , that if my own shoulder had urged a similar claim , <NAME> would have jerked me into the nearest box .
__label__1	<NAME> , that you could remember , long ago , another child who loved you dearly , you being but a child yourself .
__label__1	The dinner and dessert being three hours long , the bashful Member cooled in the shadow of <NAME> faster than he warmed with food and drink , and had but a chilly time of it .
__label__0	`` May God keep him safe from all harm , '' was the utterance of many that day .
__label__1	Finally Mr Podsnap telegraphs to Mrs Veneering , ‘ We have brought him in. ’ Another gorgeous dinner awaits them on their return to the Veneering halls , and <NAME> awaits them , and <NAME> and <NAME> await them .
__label__1	It was the night of a little party at the <NAME> ’ s , which was given on the occasion of <NAME> ’ s departure for <NAME> , whither he was going as a cadet , or something of that kind : <NAME> having at length arranged the business .
__label__1	The weightiest of men had said to projectors , ‘ Now , what name have you got ?
__label__0	Even <NAME> 's knowledge was lost to me , for this puzzling person did not appear once during our passage at full speed .
__label__1	You must not stir from my side during the whole interview .
__label__1	‘ I find I gets on better at supper when I does , ’ replied Sam .
__label__1	Upon the next day , therefore , Mr Toots , putting into requisition some of the greatest marvels that <NAME> and Co. had ever turned out , went off to Mr <NAME> ’ s upon this design .
__label__0	He then made me go round to the south of the church , and coming out of the grove of cedars surrounding it , 'This is the mountain , ' he said , looking maliciously up into my face , 'that when you were on the other side of it , was between you and the fountains of the <NAME> ; there is no other .
__label__1	It came upon him in a moment of inspiration , as he was smoking an early pipe in <NAME> Place after breakfast ; and it was worthy of the tobacco .
__label__0	The eighty miles between <NAME> and <NAME> were traversed in six days .
__label__0	The settlers made a hearty meal , for their appetites were sharpened , and measures were then taken that the night might be passed in safety .
__label__1	‘ Exceedingly kind notes , proposing that you should visit them for change of scene .
__label__1	She would officially succeed to the chamber she had rented so long .
__label__1	<NAME> took the bit off , and put it in her mouth .
__label__1	The room was but small , and the clients seemed to have had a habit of backing up against the wall ; the wall , especially opposite to <NAME> 's chair , being greasy with shoulders .
__label__1	“ You deserve a very admirable husband , and whoever he is , he ’ ll be a very lucky man. ” As <NAME> said this , his eye involuntarily wandered from the widow ’ s face to the comfort around him .
__label__1	Before breakfast in the morning , <NAME> walked out to look about him .
__label__0	`` Now , '' said the doctor , `` we have only to cross this , and reach <NAME> , at the entrance of <NAME> . ''
__label__1	I 've been negotiating with this gentleman on behalf of <NAME> , <NAME> , and one way and another I 've been in and out and about his premises a deal .
__label__1	‘ Was it property that we ever thought of ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , ’ cried Mrs. <NAME> , ‘ I scorn it. ’ ‘ So do I , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ and always did. ’ ‘ My feelings have been lancerated , ’ said Mrs. <NAME> , ‘ my heart has been torn asunder with anguish , I have been thrown back in my confinement , my unoffending infant has been rendered uncomfortable and fractious , <NAME> has pined herself away to nothing ; all this I forget and forgive , and with you , uncle , I never can quarrel .
__label__1	‘ How can you be so thankless to your best friend , <NAME> ?
__label__1	Jinks , ’ said the magistrate , ‘ you ’ re a fool. ’ <NAME> looked humbly at the great man , and bit the top of his pen .
__label__1	'We had our eyes fixed full upon each other ; and I could swear to him . '
__label__1	There was something so very agreeable in being so intimate with such a waistcoat ; in being called <NAME> , in such an intimate way , by such a voice ; in being on such off-hand terms so soon , with such a pair of whiskers ; that <NAME> was uncommonly pleased with himself .
__label__0	“ To land here would be a ticklish matter ! ” said the <NAME> .
__label__1	'It seems a strange sort of a thing , a knock coming at such a time in the morning , ' said <NAME> , surveying the pale faces which surrounded him , and looking very blank himself ; 'but the door must be opened .
__label__0	At noon , <NAME> himself came to work the ship 's log .
__label__1	I could n't be worse off if I was a what's-his-name -- man and a brother ! ''
__label__0	In that way we reached the shore , but alone , without our brave officer . ''
__label__1	Much as I desired to put an end to the interview , I felt that I had no right to present myself ; that it was for <NAME> alone to see her and recover her .
__label__0	“ Why should not <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , united to the archipelagoes of the <NAME> , have once formed a sixth part of the world , as important as <NAME> or <NAME> , as <NAME> or the two <NAME> ?
__label__1	`` What was your remark , my dear friend ? ''
__label__0	<NAME> established himself at <NAME> ; although he was an old man , his wife was still young .
__label__0	“ But we shall see. ” The blacksmith set to work .
__label__1	To watch the shadows of the clouds and leaves , and seem to feel a sympathy with shadows .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> , like a tall tower in a flat country , seemed to project himself across the table-cloth , hide the light from the honourable Member , cool the honourable Member ’ s marrow , and give him a woeful idea of distance .
__label__1	His man looked back pretty often as he went , but got no hint of him .
__label__1	You ’ ll begin to take charge at once , of all that ’ s going on in the new house , will you ? ’ ‘ Most willingly .
__label__1	I should break through the wall to come to you .
__label__0	Two magnificent flights of steps , several hundred feet long , all of granite , exceedingly well finished , and still in their places , are the only remains of a magnificent temple .
__label__0	J. P. When <NAME> had finished reading this article , <NAME> turned to the geographer and said , “ You see , <NAME> , there can be convicts in Australia. ” “ Escaped convicts , that is evident , ” replied <NAME> , “ but not regularly transported criminals .
__label__0	cried <NAME> , `` and that we were there , too !
__label__1	After waiting some quarter of an hour alone in the family sitting-room , which presented traces of having been so hastily arranged after a meal , that one might have doubted whether it was made tidy for visitors , or cleared for blindman ’ s buff , Mr and <NAME> became aware of the entrance of Mrs <NAME> , majestically faint , and with a condescending stitch in her side : which was her company manner .
__label__0	`` He was about to throw himself over , when <NAME> held him back .
__label__0	He held his instruments in his hands , having evidently been calculating the exact height of the mountain .
__label__1	He ’ d be afraid of you , and wouldn ’ t talk .
__label__1	<NAME> is now at work upon embroidery or some such pretty thing , and as she bends her head over it , my Lady watches her in silence .
__label__0	The sun was shining brightly ; the doctor held the lens so that the rays should be focused on the tinder , which took fire in a few seconds .
__label__1	The warm-hearted darling leaned across her cousin <NAME> and kissed me , and then looking up in his face , boldly said , `` At all events , cousin <NAME> , I WILL thank you for the companion you have given me . ''
__label__1	‘ I told you this morning , ’ said the old gentleman , laying his hand upon his brother ’ s shoulder , ‘ that I came to you in mercy .
__label__0	<NAME> had a great desire to play on it .
__label__1	‘ Nor want anything , ’ cried the boy .
__label__0	Completely master of himself , he closed his eyes , in order not to see the inexpressible anguish which agitated the revered countenance of his mother .
__label__0	Things hanging in the saloon were sensibly returning to their normal position .
__label__1	An exhausted composure , a worn-out placidity , an equanimity of fatigue not to be ruffled by interest or satisfaction , are the trophies of her victory .
__label__0	I know where you are , <NAME> , and I know where to find you .
__label__1	That Mr <NAME> was himself perplexed , and that in no small degree , by the contents of the letter , was sufficiently obvious .
__label__0	To-morrow Captain Nemo might take us far from all land .
__label__0	`` It is enough to break one 's heart ! ''
__label__0	if we only had the <NAME> ! ''
__label__1	'Add five pounds to the sum you have named ; give me five-and-twenty pounds in gold , ' said the woman ; 'and I 'll tell you all I know .
__label__0	At the end of this room opened another smaller room , hung with cloth of gold , in which were 300 men of the king 's guard armed with poniards .
__label__0	The winter , although severe , ended favorably enough .
__label__1	laughed the same woman , when old <NAME> , producing a flannel bag with money in it , told out their several gains upon the ground .
__label__1	And at a table sat the old man himself ; the only living creature there ; his white face pinched and sharpened by the greediness which made his eyes unnaturally bright -- counting the money of which his hands had robbed her .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> was suspected , with three companions .
__label__0	They had then little to fear from the waves , which always endanger small craft .
__label__1	She has an extensive acquaintance at <NAME> among appalling old gentlemen with thin legs and nankeen trousers , and is of high standing in that dreary city .
__label__0	This fresh obstacle forced us to seek a new road , or to pass around the foot of the avalanche .
__label__0	But he 's a good fellow , you may depend on it . ''
__label__1	The sprightly <NAME> is reputed , in that grass-grown city of the ancients , <NAME> , to be stimulated by an urgent curiosity which impels her on all convenient and inconvenient occasions to sidle about with a golden glass at her eye , peering into objects of every description .
__label__0	cried <NAME> , who could not repress his indignation .
__label__1	The house was silent as the grave .
__label__1	There was a very dirty lady in his little room , and two wan girls , his daughters , with shock heads of hair .
__label__0	`` Last night , '' cried J. T. <NAME> , _ex abrupto_ , `` our president was publicly insulted during the meeting .
__label__0	They had , however , the good sense to regain the continent , where in comparative ease , they could await the end of the winter .
__label__0	I had taken my place with <NAME> in the saloon ; through the open window we could see the lower beds of the <NAME> .
__label__0	A thick white beard flowed over his chest ; a fur cap covered his head ; his aspect was grave and austere .
__label__0	Did not <NAME> M'Connell see it also ? ''
__label__0	<NAME> now reminded us that it was imprudent to prolong our stay upon this Land of the <NAME> -- a name to be retained .
__label__1	As to <NAME> , he conceives it utterly impossible that anything can be wanting , in any direction , by any one who has the good fortune to be received under that roof ; and in a state of sublime satisfaction , he moves among the company , a magnificent refrigerator .
__label__0	He undertook to convey all documents of every kind collected during the voyage to <NAME> ; but being taken prisoner by an <NAME> frigate , he was deprived of his property , in defiance of justice ; and when <NAME> obtained the objects of natural history , of which she had been robbed -- the expression is not too strong when we recall the instructions given by the <NAME> government with regard to <NAME> 's expedition -- they were in so bad a condition that they had lost much of their value .
__label__1	The way -- now you won ’ t ask any more , you know ? ’ said <NAME> , turning his eyes , which were now fast getting drowsy and stupid , upon her .
__label__1	When he put his lips to hers , besides , he took himself into custody by the wrists , and backed himself among the ottomans and chairs and tables as if he were his own Police officer , saying to himself , ‘ Now , none of that !
__label__0	He dug his heels into the sides of his steed , and made for the shore .
__label__1	I thought you was poor , my improvident friend ! ’ Why , <NAME> , how hard it was upon a man !
__label__1	She walked among ‘ em with my child , minding only her ; and brought her safe out , in the dead of the night , from that black pit of ruin !
__label__1	I kissed her hand , and she took him in her arms , and went away caressing him .
__label__1	You are to pay all charges out of my purse , You hear the condition of your going ? ” “ And must obey , ” said I .
__label__1	And now go ! ” At the mention of each name , she had struck the table with her stick in a new place .
__label__1	I endure without murmuring , because it is appointed that I shall so make reparation for my sins .
__label__1	While the meal was in progress , their host remarked that the old man seemed much fatigued , and evidently stood in need of rest .
__label__0	But to what nation did she belong ?
__label__1	Towards which , what ’ s your views , old lady ? ’ Mrs Boffin , a smiling creature , broad of figure and simple of nature , with her hands folded in her lap , and with buxom creases in her throat , proceeded to expound her views .
__label__1	I ’ ll carry them myself. ’ Not ceasing to talk and bustle , in a state of great excitement , Mr <NAME> directed the removal and arrangement of the books , appearing to be in some sort beside himself until they were all deposited on the floor , and the cab was dismissed .
__label__0	The chief having died a few days before our travellers appeared , his sudden death was attributed to the missionary , and the tribe resolved to immolate him .
__label__0	You and your companions will not , perhaps , have so much to complain of in the chance which has bound you to my fate .
__label__1	I shall very well know how to manage and smooth old Bounderby ! ’ Their shadows were defined upon the wall , but those of the high presses in the room were all blended together on the wall and on the ceiling , as if the brother and sister were overhung by a dark cavern .
__label__0	They watch for days at their breathing-holes , and seize them the moment they come upon the ice .
__label__1	They crossed from the <NAME> into <NAME> <NAME> 's <NAME> ; struck down the small street which terminates at <NAME> 's <NAME> ; through <NAME> and <NAME> ; down the little court by the side of the workhouse ; across the classic ground which once bore the name of <NAME> ; thence into <NAME> ; and so into <NAME> the <NAME> : along which the <NAME> scudded at a rapid pace , directing <NAME> to follow close at his heels .
__label__0	But if , as saith the proverb , there is no road which does not lead to <NAME> , so there is no circuit so long as not to lead to <NAME> , and of this Della <NAME> was to make proof .
__label__1	‘ I am very glad to hear your time is nearly out. ’ What does he say ?
__label__1	I ’ ll take the opportunity , if you please , of entering your name in our Callers ’ <NAME> for the day. ’ Young <NAME> made another great show of changing the volume , taking up a pen , sucking it , dipping it , and running over previous entries before he wrote .
__label__1	I am obliged to you , Carker. ’ Mr <NAME> bent his head slowly , and very softly rubbed his hands , as if he were afraid by any action to disturb the current of Mr <NAME> ’ s confidence .
__label__0	A landing was effected upon the volcanic island of <NAME> .
__label__0	I shall not soon forget that. ” “ But , <NAME> , how can we be sure that these two hands do not belong to the same body ? ” “ What can put such a notion in your head , <NAME> ? ” asked <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> was already master of <NAME> and the <NAME> , besides the colonies in the <NAME> regions at <NAME> , in <NAME> ’ s <NAME> ; at <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , in <NAME> Sea ; and on the western coast of <NAME> .
__label__0	I showed these stones to several inhabitants of <NAME> , who have assured me that there exists an entire mountain of them . ''
__label__1	Most inquiries there I leave to you , if you 'll be so good as to make 'em .
__label__0	Was it his proxim ity to <NAME> shores ?
__label__1	But , yes , I know I may .
__label__1	“ Yes , madame , ” answered <NAME> ; “ this is our poor prisoner 's darling daughter , and only child. ” The shadow attendant on <NAME> and her party seemed to fall so threatening and dark on the child , that her mother instinctively kneeled on the ground beside her , and held her to her breast .
__label__1	We alighted at one of the entrances to the Square she had mentioned , where I directed the coach to wait , not knowing but that we might have some occasion for it .
__label__1	‘ Everything was done for the best , my dear <NAME> ; everything was done for the kindest and best , we know .
__label__1	And will you tell them all that I have thought of them every day , and that my heart is faithful to them everywhere ?
__label__1	‘ Besides you , I mean , <NAME> , ’ returned the craven <NAME> .
__label__0	I was on the point of fainting .
__label__0	It was a meadow land , dotted here and there with clumps of trees , and watered by a little stream , which sprung from the slopes which closed it in on one side .
__label__1	It has not done me much good. ’ ‘ Nothing -- whatever it is -- seems to have done anybody much good who comes here , ’ she returned in all simplicity ; ‘ but I want to learn just the same. ’ ‘ I am afraid you are so weak , you see , ’ the milliner objected .
__label__0	`` That , '' shouted the doctor , `` I know what it is ; let 's go look at it ; it will tell us of itself why it was put here . ''
__label__1	And I only wish , with all my heart and soul , that any one of us came out of this matter half as well as he does. ’ So saying , <NAME> walked out of the room , leaving <NAME> and <NAME> in most unpleasant astonishment .
__label__0	Then the <NAME> led the way into the <NAME> of a deserted <NAME> , where there was a good , blazing fire to warm them , and a substantial meal of fine , juicy slices of venison soon broiling , of which they did not leave a crumb .
__label__0	If my memory serves me , you are referring to the lighting plan of <NAME> . ''
__label__1	And where were they all now ?
__label__1	‘ The avocations of R. W. , my husband , ’ Mrs <NAME> explained , on resuming her seat , ‘ keep him fully engaged in the <NAME> at this time of the day , or he would have had the honour of participating in your reception beneath our humble roof. ’ ‘ Very pleasant premises ! ’ said Mr Boffin , cheerfully .
__label__0	What crowds must be flocking to the churches !
__label__1	‘ And imposition , ’ added <NAME> , laughing ; ‘ we won ’ t leave out the imposition .
__label__1	' ” “ It 's pity , ” said I , scornfully , as I finished my interrupted breakfast , “ that the man did not say what he had done and would do again. ” “ Squires of the <NAME> ! ” <NAME> was now addressing the landlord , “ and <NAME> !
__label__0	<NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> were present on board the boat , and assisted at the operation with an interest which may readily be comprehended .
__label__1	‘ I am particular in describing how my uncle walked up the middle of the street , with his thumbs in his waistcoat pockets , gentlemen , because , as he often used to say ( and with great reason too ) there is nothing at all extraordinary in this story , unless you distinctly understand at the beginning , that he was not by any means of a marvellous or romantic turn .
__label__1	Here and there , the set of the current had worn down the bank into a little creek , and we were all suspicious of such places , and eyed them nervously .
__label__0	He was , therefore , extremely surprised at seeing a large number of men upon the shore , and at perceiving a battery of four pieces on the beach , and a fort , pierced with twenty embrasures and surmounted by the <NAME> flag , upon a hill .
__label__1	The strange boy whistled ; and put his arms into his pockets , as far as the big coat-sleeves would let them go .
__label__1	It was so emphatically a fallen sport -- a something , once innocent , delivered over to all devilry -- a healthy pastime changed into a means of angering the blood , bewildering the senses , and steeling the heart .
__label__0	He read the letter slowly , so as to take in its meaning fully .
__label__1	<NAME> , and gloomy , and black , in truth it was , and sullen and dark were the rooms , once so bustling with life and enterprise .
__label__0	In 1787 , <NAME> discovered the now famous ruins of <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> explained the whole matter in a few words .
__label__1	`` That 's the whole of it . ''
__label__1	But all these sights were of short duration , being speedily broken up by coffee , and the desertion of the room .
__label__1	I suppose I would sell mine , if I could get enough for it. ’ And so she would come round again to the war with herself .
__label__1	I regretted the necessity , but it must be done .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> comfort at this fireside , sir. ’ ‘ Do you understand it , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Why , in a general way , sir , ’ Mr <NAME> was beginning slowly and knowingly , with his head stuck on one side , as evasive people do begin , when the other cut him short : ‘ You <NAME> ’ T understand it , <NAME> , and I ’ ll explain it .
__label__0	It might be imagined that this realization of his true position would have led him to a better mind , and that , in some degree at least , he would have been induced to regard the few fellow-creatures with whom his lot had been so strangely cast , otherwise than as mere instruments to be turned to his own personal and pecuniary advantage ; but no -- the desire of gain was too thoroughly ingrained into his hard nature ever to be eradicated , and secure in his knowledge that he was under the protection of a <NAME> officer , who , except under the most urgent necessity , would not permit him to be molested in retaining his property , he determined to wait for some emergency to arise which should enable him to use his present situation for his own profit .
__label__1	It gave him little surprise , however ; for he had been revolving in his mind a change of life , and thought and hoped he saw his new-born resolutions carried out in this .
__label__1	A miniature painter lived there , for there was a large gilt frame screwed upon the street-door , in which were displayed , upon a black velvet ground , two portraits of naval dress coats with faces looking out of them , and telescopes attached ; one of a young gentleman in a very vermilion uniform , flourishing a sabre ; and one of a literary character with a high forehead , a pen and ink , six books , and a curtain .
__label__1	Mr Dombey , not knowing the game , sat down to watch them for his edification until <NAME> should return .
__label__0	I detected a restrained irritation in these words .
__label__0	Officers such as Messrs. Pascal , <NAME> , and <NAME> , have brought back precious documents from their expeditions .
__label__1	There is inquiry on foot , and pursuit .
__label__0	I do n't know what irresistible motive induced me to interfere personally , and once again to protest !
__label__1	It brought a great many boxes , which were bumped and tossed upon the roof , almost as painfully as if they had been deposited on one ’ s own head , without the intervention of a porter ’ s knot ; and several damp gentlemen , whose clothes , on their drawing round the stove , began to steam again .
__label__1	Go on with your report. ’ ‘ Am I pardoned ? ’ he asked , with an air of half abashed gallantry .
__label__0	`` The majestic height and the vigour of the trees , '' says <NAME> , `` the productions of the tropical and temperate zones , alternating with each other , bear witness at once to the fertility of the soil and the salubrity of the climate .
__label__1	Mr and <NAME> on occasions of ceremony faced each other in the centre of the board , and thus the parallel still held ; for , it always happened that the more <NAME> was pulled out , the further he found himself from the center , and nearer to the sideboard at one end of the room , or the window-curtains at the other .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> never removed his stern eye from the boy until he had deposited number four on the counter and was at a safe distance again .
__label__0	In the sixteenth century <NAME> , the lieutenant of one of the brothers <NAME> , descended the <NAME> , arrived on the main river in 1540 , ventured without a guide across the unknown district , and , after eighteen months of a navigation of which is record is most marvelous , reached the mouth .
__label__1	“ Pass that torch slowly along these walls , that I may see them , ” said <NAME> to the turnkey .
__label__1	<NAME> -- very queer ! ’ After pondering deeply and with a face of exceeding wisdom for some time , Mr <NAME> drank some more of the beer , and summoning a small boy who had been watching his proceedings , poured forth the few remaining drops as a libation on the gravel , and bade him carry the empty vessel to the bar with his compliments , and above all things to lead a sober and temperate life , and abstain from all intoxicating and exciting liquors .
__label__1	The local influence of my family was quite unavailing to obtain any employment in that department , for a man of <NAME> ’ s abilities .
__label__0	The surface of the sea remained as frozen as ever , and the two vessels , high up on their icy pedestals , remained unaltered in their critical position .
__label__1	I think he loves me better every day , and is kinder and more affectionate than he was the day before .
__label__1	<NAME> was a tall figure , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ a splendid woman , with a noble shape , and a nose , gentlemen , formed to command and be majestic .
__label__0	Indeed , it was produced in vacuo , which insured both its steadiness and its intensity .
__label__1	‘ That ’ s the ticket , sir. ’ Very much perplexed by this summary disposition of this person , <NAME> walked back into the prison , revolving in his mind what he had better do .
__label__1	Such an amazing power of taking people by surprise ! ’ <NAME> paid no regard whatever to these compliments , nor to the dubious and frightened look into which the lawyer gradually subsided , nor to the shrieks of his wife and mother-in-law , nor to the latter ’ s running from the room , nor to the former ’ s fainting away .
__label__1	`` It makes no pretensions , but it is a comfortable little place , I hope , and will be more so with such bright young looks in it .
__label__0	The index registered only 133 grammes !
__label__0	Upon the 15th of July , a tall woman , apparently some forty-five years of age , of majestic appearance , and who seemed to be much respected by the natives , came on board the <NAME> .
__label__0	and with what disinterestedness and enthusiasm must be embued the savants , sailors , and explorers , who give up all the joys of existence to contribute to the best of their power to the progress of knowledge and to the moral and intellectual development of humanity .
__label__1	You see he has just rusticated long enough to excite curiosity , and not long enough for men to have forgotten that deuced unpleasant -- by-the-bye -- you know the rights of the affair , of course ?
__label__1	He would have followed her , but <NAME> , twisting his hand in his coat collar , dragged him towards the passage by which they had entered .
__label__1	‘ It ain ’ t many that comes into a poor place , that deems it worth their while to move their hats , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	There are four of us here , four friends , and the life of one is of no more worth than the life of another .
__label__1	The moon , as <NAME> had foretold , was rapidly on the wane ; large tiers of dark , heavy clouds , which had been gradually overspreading the sky for some time past , now formed one black mass overhead ; and large drops of rain which pattered every now and then against the windows of the chaise , seemed to warn the travellers of the rapid approach of a stormy night .
__label__0	Had their lives been the forfeit of this first attempt at colonization ?
__label__1	“ <NAME> out of this office .
__label__1	‘ Who is that ? ’ ‘ Only me , sir , ’ replied the voice .
__label__1	Sometimes he stopped at the fire-place , and sometimes at the door , making believe that he was staring with all his might into shop-windows .
__label__1	If <NAME> comes home on account of ill health , he must not be allowed to go back , and we must endeavour to make some more suitable and fortunate provision for him in this country. ’ Mrs. <NAME> was so overcome by this generous speech -- which , I need not say , she had not at all expected or led up to -- that she could only tell the Doctor it was like himself , and go several times through that operation of kissing the sticks of her fan , and then tapping his hand with it .
__label__1	Nor have I been debarred , Though seas between us braid ha ’ roared , ( <NAME> ) from participating in the intellectual feasts he has spread before us .
__label__0	And <NAME> 's famous family watch , which had always kept <NAME> time , would have betrayed this fact , if it had marked the days as well as the hours and the minutes !
__label__1	The painter hadn ’ t made the scar , but I made it ; and there it was , coming and going ; now confined to the upper lip as I had seen it at dinner , and now showing the whole extent of the wound inflicted by the hammer , as I had seen it when she was passionate .
__label__1	There ’ s nothing lost , neither , by one ’ s being here ; because the boys ’ money comes in just the same as if I was at home , and Mrs. Squeers she keeps them in order .
__label__0	The channel was easily traversed , and the boat touched the opposite shore of the islet .
__label__0	One is involuntarily reminded of the famous inscription on the gate of the <NAME> of <NAME> -- `` 'Lasciate ogni speranza , voi ch ' entrate . ' ''
__label__1	“ Unsettled weather , a long journey , uncertain means of travelling , a disorganised country , a city that may not be even safe for you. ” “ My dear <NAME> , ” said <NAME> , with cheerful confidence , “ you touch some of the reasons for my going : not for my staying away .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , suddenly appearing before him , ‘ where ’ s my bedroom ? ’ <NAME> stared at his master with the most emphatic surprise ; and it was not until the question had been repeated three several times , that he turned round , and led the way to the long-sought apartment .
__label__1	Let them keep always at it .
__label__1	I know how natural it was that he should regard my presence as something offensive ; I felt it must be so , myself. ’ ‘ He did not say so ? ’ ‘ No ; he said nothing : but I saw that his glance rested on me for a moment , and I was prepared for what would happen -- for what has happened .
__label__1	When they stopped , he was a little surprised to find himself in the act of smoking ; but , on reflection , he remembered when and where he had taken the cigar .
__label__1	Oliver having 'caught it , ' in fulfilment of <NAME> 's prediction , followed that young gentleman down the stairs to breakfast .
__label__1	Finally , I went out into the air , with a dim perception that there was something unwonted in the conduct of the sunshine , and found that I had slumberously got to the turnpike without having taken any account of the road .
__label__0	We shall see a little later how slightly the reception given to <NAME> some years afterwards resembled that just related .
__label__1	I have said that I do not admit these things .
__label__0	As to <NAME> , his first satellite , <NAME> , half as far from him as our Moon is from the <NAME> , is comparatively , though not actually , eight times nearer . ''
__label__1	You see -- <NAME> , an Englishman ? ” <NAME> held it open in his hand , gazing in his earnest face .
__label__0	About the 10th of February , the preparations were pretty well completed ; and the balloons , firmly secured , one within the other , were altogether finished .
__label__1	In those two compressions , or dints , the only little change that the face ever showed , resided .
__label__0	It might really be said that he expected to be wrecked , and had prepared for it beforehand. ” “ Nothing is wanting , indeed , ” murmured <NAME> thoughtfully .
__label__1	It was evening when I arrived , much fatigued by the journey I had so often made so easily .
__label__0	The aspect of the banks was magnificent .
__label__1	I am going to do so .
__label__1	‘ I shall not require the carriage at night , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	Several unlucky ones had scarcely time to make way for their passage .
__label__0	“ More than fifteen hundred inhabitants !
__label__1	I recalled , too , that the one-eyed gentleman had shuffled forth against the wall when I was the innocent cause of his being turned out .
__label__0	All this was strange , if not alarming , not to mention the rockets , signals , lights , and lanterns of every sort .
__label__1	Again -- these three white little loaves are for <NAME> .
__label__0	The <NAME> easily avoided the breakers of <NAME> to port and the <NAME> reefs to starboard , placed at 130° long .
__label__0	`` Is the steam full on ? ''
__label__1	‘ No orders has come in for any friend o ’ yourn. ’ ‘ I mean my live friend there. ’ ‘ O !
__label__1	`` I am sorry to say I am . ''
__label__0	The <NAME> offered a retreat sufficient for the present .
__label__0	There , very fortunately , for <NAME> saw that his provisions were becoming exhausted , he found in an oven a dozen “ pogatchas , ” a kind of cake prepared with sheep ’ s fat and a large supply of plain boiled rice .
__label__0	I went up to him .
__label__0	`` Did you hear the detonation , which certainly ought to be loud ? ''
__label__1	`` <NAME> , '' said <NAME> with a rough sort of salutation , `` you bear your wrongs more quietly than I can bear mine .
__label__1	<NAME> gives a howl at the recollection .
__label__1	Can you feel quite assured of that , my dear ? ''
__label__0	They had furnished themselves with instruments of extreme precision , which would show if the <NAME> described its curve in the plane of the Equator .
__label__1	I fancy , even already , that unavailing attendance on delays and evasions has made you something less elastic than you used to be. ’ ‘ Private anxieties may have done that for the moment , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ but not official harrying .
__label__1	I have been so , many years .
__label__1	<NAME> hesitated for a moment , thinking that one or other of them would notice it ; but finding that neither did , he stopped , came back , picked it up , and laid it himself on Mr <NAME> ’ s desk .
__label__1	‘ And a manager ’ s wife , ’ added Mrs. Crummles , in her accustomed tragedy tones .
__label__1	‘ If I dropped a tear upon your hand , may it wither it up !
__label__0	We remained mute , not stirring , and not knowing what surprise awaited us , whether agreeable or disagreeable .
__label__1	<NAME> among the undertakers and the equipages and the calves of so many legs all steeped in grief , <NAME> sits concealed in one of the inconsolable carriages and at his ease surveys the crowd through the lattice blinds .
__label__1	Up , then , would come Mrs General ; taking all the colour out of everything , as <NAME> and <NAME> had taken it out of herself ; writing <NAME> and <NAME> , in Mr Eustace ’ s text , wherever she could lay a hand ; looking everywhere for Mr Eustace and company , and seeing nothing else ; scratching up the driest little bones of antiquity , and bolting them whole without any human visitings -- like a Ghoule in gloves .
__label__1	‘ Then what do you think , mother , has become of ‘ em ?
__label__1	‘ So he thinks ; but he ’ s used to call this his own , because it ’ s the one first left to him ; the one that was his legacy when it was all he took under the will. ’ ‘ When he shows his light , ’ said <NAME> , keeping watch upon his dusky figure all the time , ‘ drop lower and keep closer. ’ He went on again , and they followed again .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , he be a soizable ‘ un , he be. ’ ‘ Goodness , <NAME> !
__label__0	The bait he used was a small piece of meat , by means of which he concealed his hook .
__label__0	I thank you , nevertheless , and I consider myself as twice your debtor. ” And having said so , <NAME> saluted the young men , who in turn saluted him , and set out on their way to the farm .
__label__0	It was then a quarter to four o ’ clock .
__label__1	‘ Ay , ’ said the <NAME> , reverentially ; ‘ it ’ s a almighty element .
__label__0	For a whole hour the two ladies were closeted with the quartermaster , but nothing transpired about their interview .
__label__1	We must both die ; we are both connected with the dead already , each by a little child .
__label__1	'She charged me to keep it safe , ' replied the woman with a groan , 'and trusted me as the only woman about her .
__label__0	It was late , and half dark outside , for at this date the sun was on the edge of the horizon , and would very soon disappear below it .
__label__1	`` What company is this , <NAME> ? ''
__label__0	It was evidently a block without any possible egress .
__label__1	‘ An unexpected playsure , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , taking his glass out of his right eye , where it had , until now , done duty on <NAME> , and fixing it in his left , to bring it to bear on <NAME> .
__label__1	`` Pray think , once more , <NAME> , '' said I .
__label__1	of course do you understand that for any other purpose he ’ s no man for me , nor for you ? ’ ‘ I have frequently said to <NAME> , sir , ’ returned <NAME> , ‘ that he was of no use at all in the business .
__label__0	You can follow his plan .
__label__1	One disagreeable result of whispering is that it seems to evoke an atmosphere of silence , haunted by the ghosts of sound -- strange cracks and tickings , the rustling of garments that have no substance in them , and the tread of dreadful feet that would leave no mark on the sea-sand or the winter snow .
__label__1	‘ -- To be crammed , sir , ’ repeated <NAME> .
__label__1	The latter part of the proposal is so directly to the purpose that <NAME> says with emotion , `` <NAME> , my trump , your fist ! ''
__label__0	<NAME> prudently lowered the foresail , not wishing to be caught by a sudden gust while carrying too much canvas ; it was perhaps an unnecessary precaution on such a calm night , but <NAME> was a prudent sailor and can not be blamed for it .
__label__1	It is not dark enough yet .
__label__0	stifled its desperate complaint , and urged forward our poor worn-out mechanism , despite itself .
__label__1	But happily ( and Mrs. Snagsby tightly shakes her head and tightly smiles ) that boy was met by <NAME> yesterday in the streets ; and that boy , as affording a subject which <NAME> desires to improve for the spiritual delight of a select congregation , was seized by <NAME> and threatened with being delivered over to the police unless he showed the reverend gentleman where he lived and unless he entered into , and fulfilled , an undertaking to appear in <NAME> 's Court to-morrow night , `` to -- mor -- row -- night , '' Mrs. Snagsby repeats for mere emphasis with another tight smile and another tight shake of her head ; and to-morrow night that boy will be here , and to-morrow night Mrs. Snagsby will have her eye upon him and upon some one else ; and oh , you may walk a long while in your secret ways ( says Mrs. Snagsby with haughtiness and scorn ) , but you ca n't blind ME !
__label__1	She was alarmed by an occurrence in the house which might have alarmed a stronger person , and was made ill by the distress and agitation .
__label__1	There were samples of cheap clocks , and samples of cheap vases of flowers .
__label__1	Then you see , '' said <NAME> , shaking his head , `` I am hopeless of understanding it . ''
__label__1	‘ I shall not drink my love to you , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> : ‘ I shall drink to the little Dombey .
__label__1	‘ If you will have it so , or must have it so , ’ replies <NAME> , ‘ I ’ ll not leave you here .
__label__0	exclaimed <NAME> , thinking of his absent tooth .
__label__1	‘ When the question was referred to <NAME> -- I needn ’ t name him , ’ said <NAME> , checking himself -- ‘ I understand , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ N. ’ <NAME> darkly nodded -- ‘ was referred to him , his answer was , “ Money , or no release. ” ’ ‘ Lord bless my soul ! ’ cried <NAME> .
__label__0	“ <NAME> , indeed ! ” muttered the Jew maliciously between his teeth .
__label__1	‘ It was as true , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ as turnips is .
__label__0	That direction was at once taken , but again it was found impossible to cut a passage , and when night came the crew had to make the ship fast to a huge block of ice .
__label__1	Let me give you a card , sir , of an establishment where those six boys can be brought up in an enlightened , liberal , and moral manner , with no mistake at all about it , for twenty guineas a year each -- twenty guineas , sir -- or I ’ d take all the boys together upon a average right through , and say a hundred pound a year for the lot. ’ ‘ Oh ! ’ said the gentleman , glancing at the card , ‘ you are the <NAME> mentioned here , I presume ? ’ ‘ Yes , I am , sir , ’ replied the worthy pedagogue ; ‘ Mr .
__label__1	Unfortunately <NAME> is no snuff-taker .
__label__1	Mrs <NAME> will do her mending , or her ironing , or her nursing , whatever it is , without minding me : and you ’ ll smoke your pipe , too , if you ’ re so disposed , <NAME> , won ’ t you ? ’ ‘ Thank ’ ee , <NAME> , ’ said Mr Toodle .
__label__1	<NAME> rose the sun next morning , from his absence in strange countries and up rose <NAME> with it to receive the <NAME> , who was already at the door : having turned out earlier than was necessary , in order to get under weigh while <NAME> was still slumbering .
__label__1	He took his usual poor eighteenpennyworth of food in his usual indigestive way , and had as little to say for himself as ever a wonderful man had .
__label__0	Two hundred feet from the vessel there was a hole in the ice , a sort of circular crevasse , made by the seals with their teeth , and always dug out from the inside to the outside ; it was there that the seals used to come to breathe on the surface of the ice ; but they were compelled to take care to prevent the aperture from closing , for the shape of their jaws did not permit them to make the hole from the outside , and in any danger they would not be able to escape from their enemies .
__label__1	Perhaps , see the great crowd of people with its rush and roar , bearing down upon them , too .
__label__1	Now I ’ ve took the liberty of coming here -- ‘ Won ’ t you sit down ? ’ said Mr Carker , smiling .
__label__1	<NAME> Guppy sitting on the window-sill , nodding his head and balancing all these possibilities in his mind , continues thoughtfully to tap it , and clasp it , and measure it with his hand , until he hastily draws his hand away .
__label__0	After a noble course of some seventeen hundred miles it mingles its cloudy waters with those of the <NAME> through a mouth eleven hundred feet wide , but such is its vigorous influx that many a mile has to be completed before those waters lose their distinctive character .
__label__0	They were delirious with joy .
__label__0	<NAME> took a revolver from the rack , and assured himself that it was loaded and primed .
__label__1	‘ Sir. ’ Stay here. ’ <NAME> seemed uncertain .
__label__1	There is a dog , <NAME> , connected with -- but excuse me .
__label__1	‘ We must get more , ’ said the old man , ‘ we must earn it , <NAME> , hoard it up , scrape it together , come by it somehow .
__label__1	‘ And the world shall deal by you as it does by me , till one or both of us shall quit it for a better .
__label__0	It is His own secret that <NAME> will tell us !
__label__0	However , he and his companions were determined to fight to the last gasp .
__label__1	There was a great stage , too , looking very clean and smooth after the streets ; and there were people upon it , talking about something or other , but not at all intelligibly .
__label__0	Hans , the guide , occupied himself in preparing food .
__label__0	The “ superb specimen of a chelonian ” was no longer there !
__label__1	Thank you very much. ’ One other little circumstance connected with <NAME> I must not omit ; for I had reason to remember it thereafter , when all the irremediable past was rendered plain .
__label__1	<NAME> ’ t I say so ? ’ Here Mrs. <NAME> sobbed .
__label__0	The latter , knowing well that without special tools it would be nearly impossible for him to manufacture a gun which would be of any use , still drew back and put off the operation to some future time , observing in his usual dry way , that <NAME> and <NAME> had become very skilful archers , so that many sorts of excellent animals , agouties , kangaroos , capybaras , pigeons , bustards , wild ducks , snipes , in short , game both with fur and feathers , fell victims to their arrows , and that , consequently , they could wait .
__label__1	I ca n't stand it any longer .
__label__1	Are the two so deeply separated in this town , that there is no place whatever for an honest workman between them ? ’ <NAME> shook her head in silence .
__label__1	These answers and his manner were strange enough to cause my guardian to inquire of <NAME> , as we all walked across <NAME> 's <NAME> together , whether <NAME> were really , as his lodger represented him , deranged .
__label__1	Before we went , I wrote <NAME> a full statement of all that had happened , and <NAME> wrote me back a capital answer , expressive of his sympathy and friendship .
__label__0	The magistrate , who had often read and re-read his “ <NAME> , ” was perfectly acquainted with the steps in the analysis so minutely described by <NAME> , and he resolved to proceed in the same way on this occasion .
__label__0	A vague idea of ruin began to take possession of his mind : he must yield to necessity ; he must do the best he could .
__label__1	As the heat of the glowing day when they had stopped to drink at the streams of melted ice and snow , was changed to the searching cold of the frosty rarefied night air at a great height , so the fresh beauty of the lower journey had yielded to barrenness and desolation .
__label__1	Come here , <NAME> and Poddles. ’ <NAME> was the pet-name of the boy ; <NAME> of the girl .
__label__1	From this employment she suddenly desisted , and said to <NAME> , much to my confusion : ‘ Who ’ s your friend ? ’ ‘ Mr .
__label__1	As she knew <NAME> ( indeed <NAME> and I both thought that she evidently associated him with the receipt of her wages ) , she immediately relented and allowed us to pass in .
__label__0	Then crossing the <NAME> , he arrived at <NAME> on the 21st November .
__label__1	So here I am , a poor devil of an artist. ’ <NAME> was beginning , ‘ But on the other hand -- ’ when <NAME> took him up .
__label__1	“ <NAME> and dress yourself , emigrant. ” <NAME> complied , and was taken back to the guard-house , where other patriots in rough red caps were smoking , drinking , and sleeping , by a watch-fire .
__label__0	Then , a large spot seemingly nailed to the firmament , bordered by a silvery cord ; it was the earth !
__label__1	I have the face of this man , who was going to be released next day , before me now .
__label__1	‘ I should be the victim of their fury , ’ replied <NAME> .
__label__0	He thought of <NAME> Grant and his two sailors , and their deliverance from cruel bondage .
__label__1	It will do you good. ’ <NAME> hesitated ; but , yielding to his curiosity , rose .
__label__0	I had returned to my room , where <NAME> and <NAME> had remained silent enough .
__label__1	For I will not , I will not , I won ’ t , I won ’ t , I won ’ t ! ’ ‘ <NAME> , my dear , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ consider your child. ’ ‘ Yes , ’ shrieked Mrs. <NAME> , ‘ I will consider my child !
__label__1	<NAME> ’ t stand staring at me , but do look sharp , will you ? ’ Offering no further observation , <NAME> huddled on his clothes .
__label__0	<NAME> is logical in everything it does .
__label__1	‘ This is what your loving <NAME> calls the best time in the day and night , ’ said the person of the house .
__label__1	He will never forget that at <NAME> ’ s he first saw <NAME> .
__label__0	“ What a pity ! ” said <NAME> , “ such a useful tree , and which has such beautiful nuts ! ” As to the birds , they swarmed among the scanty branches of the eucalypti and casuarinas , which did not hinder the display of their wings .
__label__1	And now it seems to be everybody , except you. ’ Oho !
__label__1	He will write to her every alternate day , and tell her all his adventures .
__label__0	<NAME> , antelopes , and ostriches were seen running and bounding with marvellous agility in the midst of forests of acacias , mimosas , souahs , and date-trees .
__label__1	'Not at all , my dear , ' said <NAME> humbly .
__label__0	<NAME> is the strange romance conceived by the more than human genius of the greatest poet of the <NAME> .
__label__0	There was certainly something wrong .
__label__1	And still , through all this grotesque revival of what he remembered as having once been prettily natural to her , he could not but feel that it revived at sight of him , and that there was a tender memory in it .
__label__1	I could see in the action of <NAME> 's fingers as they worked that she attended to what I said ; but she did not look up .
__label__0	At the end of fifteen days the repairs of the <NAME> were completed .
__label__1	‘ Now , <NAME> , ’ said Mr Carker , taking him by the shoulder , ‘ come along ! ’ The prodigal son was evidently nervous of visiting the parental abode ; but Mr Carker pushing him on before , he had nothing for it but to open the right door , and suffer himself to be walked into the midst of his brothers and sisters , mustered in overwhelming force round the family tea-table .
__label__0	Upon the 1st of December , 1799 , he returned to <NAME> , and left it finally with a caravan upon the 7th of April , 1800 .
__label__1	I have none to spare myself , having to attend court very soon .
__label__0	<NAME> and <NAME> were silent , although they were no less angry than the captain at the haughty coolness of their opponent .
__label__1	I ’ ll tell you what I ’ ve said and done tomorrow. ’ Without waiting for a reply , he darted off at a rapid pace , and , plunging into the crowds which thronged the street , was quickly lost to view .
__label__1	I entreated her to rise , and got my arms about her to help her up ; but she only pressed that hand of mine which was nearest to her grasp , and hung her head over it and wept .
__label__1	‘ I fully understands my instructions , do I , <NAME> ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
__label__0	In the evening , after supper , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , again ascended the plateau of <NAME> .
__label__1	Will you give me the address ? ’ Mr <NAME> repeated it , and the Secretary wrote it down in his pocket-book .
__label__1	I told him that he addressed my interest or what he supposed to be my interest quite as unsuccessfully as he addressed my inclination , and he would now understand that I requested him , if he pleased , to go away immediately .
__label__1	‘ Silence ! ’ cried <NAME> , suddenly rising up , and striking his desk with the book .
__label__1	And as she blows , and shading it with her lean hand , concentrates its red spark of light , it serves in the dim morning as a lamp to show him what he sees of her .
__label__0	<NAME> and his friends took the <NAME> 's gig .
__label__1	It was written with a plain , unaffected , homely piety that I knew to be genuine , and ended with ‘ my duty to my ever darling ’ -- meaning myself .
__label__0	Without expecting game , some useful plant might be met with , and the young naturalist was delighted with discovering a sort of wild spinach , belonging to the order of chenopodiaceae , and numerous specimens of cruciferae , belonging to the cabbage tribe , which it would certainly be possible to cultivate by transplanting .
__label__1	He makes so much of you , that it ’ s my opinion you think you ’ ve only to call your Pussys by the dozen , to make ’ em come. ’ ‘ You forget , Mrs. Tope , ’ <NAME> interposes , taking his place at the table with a genial smile , ‘ and so do you , <NAME> , that <NAME> and <NAME> are words prohibited here by common consent and express agreement .
__label__0	“ A ship ! ” exclaimed <NAME> , starting to his feet .
__label__1	‘ Before I hear you , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , when the door was closed , ‘ I wish you to hear me. ’ ‘ To be addressed by <NAME> , ’ he returned , ‘ even in accents of unmerited reproach , is an honour I so greatly esteem , that although I were not her servant in all things , I should defer to such a wish , most readily. ’ ‘ If you are charged by the man whom you have just now left , <NAME> ; ’ Mr <NAME> raised his eyes , as if he were going to counterfeit surprise , but she met them , and stopped him , if such were his intention ; ‘ with any message to me , do not attempt to deliver it , for I will not receive it .
__label__0	The population , so sparsely sprinkled throughout the arid countries which the ambassador had come through , were collected here , and <NAME> .
__label__1	In the back kitchen , I raved as became me .
__label__1	She has called to me in her sleep before now , sir ; as I have sat by , watching , I have seen her lips move , and have known , though no sound came from them , that she spoke of me .
__label__0	`` Certainly you have , <NAME> , '' replied the engineer quickly .
__label__0	E. Frewer , 1876 ; Field of Ice , 1876 ; <NAME> of the <NAME> , tr .
__label__0	He was accordingly hung up by the heels , whereupon he soon regained his senses , and the next day was completely restored .
__label__1	He sat looking at the horse ’ s ears , as if he saw something new there ; and sat so , for a considerable time .
__label__1	For some changes in the fortunes of my friends , I was prepared .
__label__0	For myself , I was not particularly sorry .
__label__0	Like the immense majority of his fellow beings , he had looked at the <NAME> , heard her talked of , written poetry about her , but , in the strict sense of the term , he had probably never seen her -- that is -- scanned her , examined her , surveyed her , inspected her , reconnoitred her -- even with an opera glass !
__label__0	The clock was striking twelve , the hour of breakfast .
__label__1	I never to my knowledge see you afore though , not even in court .
__label__1	But that ’ s not all , sir .
__label__0	“ Yes , and a famous one , ” replied <NAME> .
__label__1	Kit no sooner comes in , than that single gentleman ( never was such a busy gentleman ) charges all the glasses -- bumpers -- and drinks his health , and tells him he shall never want a friend while he lives ; and so does Mr <NAME> , and so does <NAME> , and so does Mr Abel .
__label__0	There would be no storms , no lee-shore to fear .
__label__1	I thought of myself , lying here , when that first great change was being wrought at home .
__label__1	I believe I had at this time some lurking distrust of <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ How does he bear it , my dear creature ? ’ asks <NAME> .
__label__0	I hastened to dress myself , and my companions followed my example .
__label__1	On the grounds that you may take me where you will , and get me sworn to it .
__label__0	It was in these trying circumstances that two brave officers , <NAME> and <NAME> , proposed to the admiral to attempt to cross from <NAME> to <NAME> in <NAME> canoes .
__label__0	So then it was all true ?
__label__0	This was anything but a cheering prospect for the <NAME> , whose policy it was to maintain the system that had hitherto worked so well .
__label__1	As we walked to and fro , all four together , before breakfast , I deemed it right to recount what I had seen .
__label__0	<NAME> is but the motion of atoms , a simple oscillation of the particles of a body .
__label__1	<NAME> laid his hand upon his shoulder .
__label__1	It was the journey ’ s fitting end , and might have been the end of everything ; it was so ruinous and dreary .
__label__1	<NAME> vaulted rooms with cool uncarpeted floors , great dogs upon the hearths for the burning of wood in winter time , and all luxuries befitting the state of a marquis in a luxurious age and country .
__label__0	“ But isn ’ t there another thing to be done ? ” said <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> had lighted the lamp , but had put it aside in a corner , that they might enjoy the fire-light undisturbed .
__label__0	We will see about the sun by and by . ''
__label__0	The expedition next sent out under the command of <NAME> Dumont d'Urville was merely intended by the minister to supplement and consolidate the mass of scientific data collected by <NAME> in his voyage from 1822 to 1824 .
__label__1	Having eaten and drunk to Mr <NAME> ’ s extreme contentment , given him his drink , and put everything in neat order , she wrapped herself in an old coverlet and lay down upon the rug before the fire .
__label__0	It appeared likely that <NAME> would return to its habitual apathy , which that unexpected event had for a moment disturbed .
__label__1	Every eye then turned to the five judges and the public prosecutor .
__label__0	Two days later we were not far from the coast of <NAME> , somewhere near what <NAME> sailors call <NAME> , and then the < i > <NAME> < /i > stretched out direct for the <NAME> , between <NAME> and <NAME> .
__label__1	I thall keep your brother here after the performanth .
__label__0	How do we detect the existence of life ?
__label__0	But if it is justifiable to reproach <NAME> with having held cheaply the political rights of the <NAME> , it must be conceded that he manifested the most laudable solicitude for their spiritual well-being .
__label__1	A deaf serving-woman and the light porter completed Mrs. Sparsit ’ s empire .
__label__1	When he looked out from his shelter in the distance , and saw that I waved my hat to him to come up , he rejoined me , and there we waited ; sometimes lying on the bank , wrapped in our coats , and sometimes moving about to warm ourselves , until we saw our boat coming round .
__label__0	But a degree of intelligence appeared in his face that showed some educational influences must have been at work on his savage , untamed nature .
__label__1	Even money could not buy them now ; everything must come out , and everybody must know all .
__label__1	You will always be my solace and resource , as you have always been .
__label__1	She eyed him narrowly , while he spoke ; and cast upon him a look of intelligence which sufficiently showed that she guessed what had been passing in his thoughts .
__label__1	<NAME> ! ’ looking into the lines .
__label__1	Is there none in this room ?
__label__0	“ <NAME> , ” said <NAME> , “ you need not reproach yourself .
__label__1	My love to you ! ’ Some of the fog that hung about old <NAME> seemed to have got into his throat ; for he spoke huskily .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> ’ s in this , I see , <NAME> ? ’ he said to Mr Abel Garland .
__label__1	'It is , ' replied <NAME> , 'that you must endeavour to forget me ; not as your old and dearly-attached companion , for that would wound me deeply ; but , as the object of your love .
__label__1	‘ I don ’ t know , ’ I said , pretending to be undecided , ‘ whether I shall take a shot or not. ’ ‘ <NAME> is got wery shy , I ’ m told , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	“ Yes. ” “ Do you know that man who took my horses ? ” “ No. ” “ Had you never seen him before ? ” “ Never. ” “ Who do you think he was ? ” “ A man who knows how to make himself obeyed. ” <NAME> fixed his piercing gaze upon the <NAME> , but the other did not quail before it .
__label__1	‘ The consequences may be dreadful , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	Then my brain grew calmer , my imagination wandered into vague unconsciousness , and I soon fell into a deep sleep .
__label__1	They appeared exceedingly well-taught , and not better taught than fed ; for a more chubby-looking full-waistcoated set of boys , I never saw .
__label__0	The iron balustrade around the platform was lowered , and the lantern and pilot cages were pushed within the shell until they were flush with the deck .
__label__0	An hour later and the entire population of twenty-two had met in the chamber adjoining the gourbi .
__label__1	But how the graces and elegancies which she had dispersed about the poorly-furnished room went to the heart of <NAME> !
__label__1	They apply so happily to the late case that <NAME> has come from the library to my <NAME> 's room expressly to read them aloud .
__label__0	Up to this time no other means have been devised , and it is this that has always prevented long journeys in the air. ” “ My dear <NAME> , I have only one word to answer -- I shall not lose one particle of gas. ” “ And yet you can descend when you please ? ” “ I shall descend when I please. ” “ And how will you do that ? ” “ Ah , ha !
__label__1	‘ There ’ s a footstep ! ’ exclaims <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> walked up and down the shop for some time , cogitating profoundly , and bringing his bushy black eyebrows to bear so heavily on his nose , like clouds setting on a mountain , that <NAME> was afraid to offer any interruption to the current of his reflections .
__label__0	“ Let us embark now , ” said <NAME> .
__label__1	She was waiting at the foot of the stairs -- was sitting on the bottom stair , in fact -- to receive Pa when he came down , but her only object seemed to be to get Pa well out of the house .
__label__0	`` Do you want , then , to kill me , little by little ? ''
__label__1	He was so good as to make an appointment for to-night , when you would be at home. ’ A dark gentleman .
__label__1	In a few instances , <NAME> , coming behind some under-sized young man with a shining hat on , and his sleek hair twisted into one flat curl on each side of his head , almost without glancing at him touches him with his stick , upon which the young man , looking round , instantly evaporates .
__label__1	`` The first until we meet to-morrow , the second as a farewell to this theme between us for ever . ''
__label__1	I never have any money .
__label__1	Mr Baptist , as a grateful little fellow in a position of trust , was among the workmen , and had done as much towards the cheering as a mere foreigner could .
__label__0	“ Two ; my friend <NAME> , and my servant Neb. ” “ That will be three , ” replied <NAME> ; “ and with <NAME> and me five .
__label__1	Mr Sloppy having shaken his head to a considerable extent , proceeded to remark that he thought <NAME> ‘ must have took ‘ em from the Minders. ’ Being asked what he meant , he answered , them that come out upon him and partickler his chest .
__label__1	‘ -- I said , ’ proceeded old <NAME> , ‘ that still there was no certain information got yet .
__label__0	<NAME> to pacify him , <NAME> assured him that every exertion should be made to procure the instrument , and directed <NAME> to go to the Jew and borrow it .
__label__1	The old man , sometimes by his side and sometimes with the child , lent his aid to both , went here and there on little patient services , and was happy .
__label__1	It was the Charter of the <NAME> .
__label__1	His tap at the glass roused her from the musing solitude in which she sat , and she came to the door to open it ; aiding her steps with a little crutch-stick .
__label__0	His calm temperament seemed to indicate an interior fire , kept well under control .
__label__0	The responsibility for the general safety is mine , and I will not yield any of it to anyone .
__label__1	said <NAME> , improving the accident .
__label__1	Do I understand aright ? ’ <NAME> answered in a low voice : ‘ It is only known to us three who are here together. ’ ‘ It is not at all known to the young lady , your friend ? ’ ‘ On my soul , no ! ’ ‘ I require you , then , to give me your similar and solemn pledge , <NAME> , that it shall remain the secret it is , and that you will take no other action whatsoever upon it than endeavouring ( and that most earnestly ) to erase it from your mind .
__label__0	This diversion was to be effected both up and down the river , on the <NAME> bank .
__label__1	But it left a little figure visible upon a lonely shore , and <NAME> was always staring at it .
__label__1	Mouldering away before our eyes .
__label__0	<NAME> was then very little known , its capital <NAME> , contained no less than 15,000 inhabitants .
__label__1	“ I lighted on you , <NAME> , coming out of the prison of the <NAME> while I was contemplating the walls , an hour or more ago .
__label__1	When we are at home here , of an evening , and shut the outer door , and draw those curtains -- which she made -- where could we be more snug ?
__label__1	`` <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , '' returns <NAME> , `` put it to her ladyship to clear that up .
__label__0	The upper ladder , which generally hung from the door to the landing , was in its place , but the lower ladder was drawn up and raised to the threshold .
__label__1	I adopted her , to be loved .
__label__0	It , however , has passed away .
__label__0	The head of the “ Bonadventure ” was put towards <NAME> , and a fair wind filling her sails , she ran rapidly along the coast .
__label__1	His money always as good as the bank -- always. ’ As Mrs. <NAME> said this , she applied her handkerchief to her eyes , and went out of the room to get the receipt .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> ’ nly not , ’ replied <NAME> ; ‘ what ’ s the good o ’ flannel veskits to the young niggers abroad ?
__label__0	The <NAME> of the <NAME> XI .
__label__1	Stealing lower down the stairs , and observing what passed , she saw her father come out in his morning gown , and start when he was told his wife had not come home .
__label__0	<NAME> ’ s place was , of course , to be in front of the wagon , and M. Olbinett , who did not much care for equitation , was to make room for himself among the baggage .
__label__0	“ There is no doubt about it now , ” repeated Harding .
__label__0	The three travellers uttered a short prayer over their companion , and at seven o'clock in the morning they set off again for the ship .
__label__0	A whole ration was set aside for the four dogs which should draw it .
__label__0	These poor priests receive from the <NAME> Government a most ridiculously inadequate salary , and collect one quarter of the tithe of their parish -- not more than sixty marks current , or about L3 10s .
__label__0	I tried to continue the conversation .
__label__1	At this sally , the boys laughed .
__label__1	He found the Doctor reading in his arm-chair at a window .
__label__1	He is my only relation in the world , <NAME> , and unless you plead for me , I fear I have lost even him .
__label__1	At first , none but the surgeon went close to it .
__label__1	You are -- hum -- quite accurate , I have no doubt .
__label__0	<NAME> was the commencement of the Anglo-Russian Company .
__label__1	`` I should have got a lawyer , and he would have said ( as I have often read in the newspapers ) , 'My client says nothing , my client reserves his defence ' : my client this , that , and t'other .
__label__0	Their faces were peculiar , but pleasant ; they had small eyes and thick lips , the upper one being painted or tattooed . ''
__label__0	<NAME> was in mortal suspense .
__label__0	Three hours of terrible fatigue , walking incessantly , had only brought us to the foot of the great mountain .
__label__1	I can not help thinking , ’ said Mrs. Micawber , with an air of deep sagacity , ‘ that there are members of my family who have been apprehensive that <NAME> would solicit them for their names. -- -I do not mean to be conferred in <NAME> upon our children , but to be inscribed on <NAME> of <NAME> , and negotiated in the <NAME> Market. ’ The look of penetration with which Mrs. Micawber announced this discovery , as if no one had ever thought of it before , seemed rather to astonish my aunt ; who abruptly replied , ‘ Well , ma ’ am , upon the whole , I shouldn ’ t wonder if you were right ! ’ ‘ Mr .
__label__0	This metal , in fact , is the most tenacious , the most ductile , and the most malleable , and consequently suitable for all moulding operations ; and when smelted with pit coal , is of superior quality for all engineering works requiring great resisting power , such as cannon , steam boilers , hydraulic presses , and the like .
__label__1	Mr Dombey , my love , ’ pursued the <NAME> , turning to his wife , ‘ is so confiding as to -- do you see our little friend ? ’ Mrs Blimber , in an excess of politeness , of which Mr <NAME> was the object , apparently did not , for she was backing against the little friend , and very much endangering his position on the table .
__label__0	It was natural that they should take the same means of transport , and that they should follow the same route to the <NAME> steppes .
__label__1	'Well , ' said the robber , grasping <NAME> 's wrist , and putting the barrel so close to his temple that they touched ; at which moment the boy could not repress a start ; 'if you speak a word when you 're out o'doors with me , except when I speak to you , that loading will be in your head without notice .
__label__0	Did he hope , by arousing the wrath and vengeance of <NAME> , to detach the sailing-master from his allegiance and induce him to become an accomplice in <NAME> 's own designs ?
__label__0	Manco-Capac had taught the men agriculture and mechanical arts , whilst Mama-Oello instructed the women in spinning and weaving .
__label__0	`` Especially , '' replied M'Nicholl , `` if the stature of the <NAME> is in proportion to the mass of their globe . ''
__label__0	<NAME> complied with the request , and crossing the country lying between the <NAME> and the <NAME> , they arrived at their destination .
__label__0	He had been at work exactly an hour .
__label__1	He could detect a design upon it when nobody else had any perception of the fact .
__label__0	`` Thanks , yes , the passport is all right . ''
__label__1	We danced for an hour with great gravity , the melancholy child doing wonders with his lower extremities , in which there appeared to be some sense of enjoyment though it never rose above his waist .
__label__1	What is there that any woman couldn ’ t do , that she shouldn ’ t do -- especially on the subject of another woman ’ s good looks ? ’ I really thought it was all over with <NAME> , after he had uttered this libellous pleasantry .
__label__0	After coasting along a series of low and rocky islands , which were named after the principal officers , the vessels reached <NAME> , on the coast of <NAME> .
__label__1	I ’ m glad he has lost his mistress .
__label__1	‘ Well , <NAME> , what ’ s the matter with you ? ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	The usual diligence and order of the Counting-house at the <NAME> were overthrown .
__label__1	The poor old creature had taken the upward course of the river Thames as her general track ; it was the track in which her last home lay , and of which she had last had local love and knowledge .
__label__1	There was no appearance of its inmates stirring at that early hour .
__label__1	My father had left a small collection of books in a little room upstairs , to which I had access ( for it adjoined my own ) and which nobody else in our house ever troubled .
__label__1	My sister , Mrs. <NAME> , with black hair and eyes , had such a prevailing redness of skin that I sometimes used to wonder whether it was possible she washed herself with a nutmeg-grater instead of soap .
__label__1	‘ Then , my friend , ’ cried <NAME> , starting up and taking his work-roughened hand , ‘ it shall be begun all over again ! ’ <NAME> looked alarmed , and replied in a hurry -- for him , ‘ <NAME> , no .
__label__0	Every one had worked at the construction of the mill , and on the 1st of December it was finished .
__label__0	`` I do n't ask the question with any idea of backing out , '' observed the Captain quietly ; `` as a matter of purely scientific inquiry , I repeat my question : how are we to return ? ''
__label__1	So he got into his place , still making complaints , and the keeper got into the place next him , and the convicts hauled themselves up as well as they could , and the convict I had recognized sat behind me with his breath on the hair of my head .
__label__1	I was disagreeable too , <NAME> ; we were all of us disagreeable together .
__label__0	<NAME> howling for her breakfast !
__label__0	The mineral kingdom reigned supreme .
__label__1	“ Now your dinner is done , ” <NAME> presently said , “ why do n't you call a health , <NAME> ; why do n't you give your toast ? ” “ What health ?
__label__0	The duty of this committee was to resolve the three grand questions of the cannon , the projectile , and the powder .
__label__0	We must go to seek him . ''
__label__0	`` We must have , '' said <NAME> , `` several touch-holes , so as to fire it at different points at the same time . ''
__label__0	`` Well , sir , you will only get your deserts . ''
__label__1	And when you used him shamefully , I took his part and loved him -- There !
__label__1	‘ We mustn ’ t let him go ?
__label__1	If you ’ ll show me <NAME> ’ s room I ’ ll step up myself. ’ ‘ What name , <NAME> ? ’ said the waiter .
__label__0	A new trench was made by the same means in the rocky border of the lake forming a small stream , to which they gave the name of <NAME> , and which was thus an affluent of the <NAME> .
__label__0	The doctor took his bearings , by means of lunar observations , and consulted the excellent map that he had with him for his guidance .
__label__1	After the first six months or so I had taken <NAME> 's advice in reference to the propriety of writing to <NAME> to say that I was happy and grateful , and with her approval I had written such a letter .
__label__1	Day after day , and night after night , found her still by the pillow of the unconscious sufferer , still anticipating his every want , still listening to those repetitions of her name and those anxieties and cares for her , which were ever uppermost among his feverish wanderings .
__label__1	“ <NAME> , ” said I , when we were walking homeward , “ I wish you could put me right. ” “ I wish I could ! ” said <NAME> .
__label__0	Absorbed in these thoughts , it can be understood how <NAME> could remain insensible to the miseries even of her captivity .
__label__0	“ The wire is no doubt still working between <NAME> and <NAME> , and there -- Shall we start , little father ? ” “ Let us wait till to-morrow , ” answered <NAME> .
__label__1	and such peals of laughter as the little woman herself ( who would just as soon have cried ) greeted every jest with !
__label__0	“ We shall find it , father ! ” exclaimed <NAME> .
__label__1	We stopped to dine at <NAME> , and being now in <NAME> , were waited on , for the first time , by slaves .
__label__0	`` We obey your orders , <NAME> . ''
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , ’ said that eccentric functionary , ‘ furniter ’ s cheap where you come from , <NAME> .
__label__1	She detested us , she was miserable with us , she couldn ’ t bear it , she wouldn ’ t bear it , she was determined to go away .
__label__1	I had seen <NAME> frequently .
__label__1	Nevertheless , Mr <NAME> played so well -- some games with the Major , and some with <NAME> , whose vigilance of eye in respect of Mr Dombey and <NAME> no lynx could have surpassed -- that he even heightened his position in the lady-mother ’ s good graces ; and when on taking leave he regretted that he would be obliged to return to <NAME> next morning , <NAME> trusted : community of feeling not being met with every day : that it was far from being the last time they would meet .
__label__1	Why have they not been here ? '
__label__0	I was making my observations , when <NAME> and <NAME> awoke almost at the same time , under the influence of this reviving air .
__label__0	The young men were both squatters and settlers .
__label__1	Mr Dombey goes upon a journey 21 .
__label__0	He was on his way to be sacrificed in honour of the white men !
__label__0	The canoe was hauled up on the beach near the <NAME> , and all proceeded towards the ladder of <NAME> .
__label__1	But now he was ill at ease about her .
__label__1	‘ Do you think he is in earnest , my dear Major ?
__label__0	There is an <NAME> mosque , called Goman-Dammesec , meaning the synagogue of <NAME> , and this building has not its equal ; it is said to have been <NAME> 's palace , and it contains a glass wall , built apparently by magic .
__label__0	If one of the mules stopped , they urged it on with a guttural cry , and if that proved unavailing , a good-sized pebble , thrown with unerring aim , soon cured the animal ’ s obstinacy .
__label__0	Where should it be celebrated ?
__label__0	But what epithets he lavished on them , including the names of all the saints in the calendar , when they behaved like docile and conscientious animals !
__label__0	This courageous woman made heroic efforts to restrain herself , lest she should disturb <NAME> ’ s coolness .
__label__1	It was a harder day ’ s journey than yesterday ’ s , for there were long and weary hills to climb ; and in journeys , as in life , it is a great deal easier to go down hill than up .
__label__0	As long as it went through more frequented waters , we often saw the hulls of shipwrecked vessels that were rotting in the depths , and deeper down cannons , bullets , anchors , chains , and a thousand other iron materials eaten up by rust .
__label__1	With an old sheepskin knapsack at his back , and a rough , unbarked stick cut out of some wood in his hand ; miry , footsore , his shoes and gaiters trodden out , his hair and beard untrimmed ; the cloak he carried over his shoulder , and the clothes he wore , sodden with wet ; limping along in pain and difficulty ; he looked as if the clouds were hurrying from him , as if the wail of the wind and the shuddering of the grass were directed against him , as if the low mysterious plashing of the water murmured at him , as if the fitful autumn night were disturbed by him .
__label__0	Do you know my past ? ... .
__label__0	`` Your captain is in a remarkable hurry ! ''
__label__1	‘ Leave her alone , everybody ! ’ cried Mrs. Sparsit , with great energy .
__label__1	`` This has been without prejudice ? ''
__label__1	And it 's really very hard , ” said <NAME> .
__label__0	The only explanation which can be given , he says , seems to me to result from the experience known to all the world .
__label__1	As I have grown older , I think I have had experience of some other houses doing business on the principle of <NAME> and <NAME> !
__label__1	Did he leave them here ?
__label__0	We now began to climb the blackish rocks , amid unforeseen stumbles , and over stones which the ice made slippery .
__label__0	`` Wait a moment , my dear <NAME> , '' he responded ; `` you must take precautions after your illness before going into the open air . ''
__label__1	I should be happy , myself , to propose two months -- three -- an indefinite period , in fact -- but I have a partner .
__label__1	I give ‘ em away to the young ladies .
__label__1	By the light of the fire he can be seen looking towards the moonlight .
__label__1	And now I tell you , once and away , <NAME> , that <NAME> , commonly called <NAME> , his hand and no other , done the deed , on his own confession to me .
__label__1	Oh , for mercy ’ s sake , tell uncle that I never loved him half so dear as now .
__label__1	It was a very lame pretence on both sides ; the lamer , because we both went into the coffee-room , where he had just finished his breakfast , and where I ordered mine .
__label__1	Of <NAME> , conflicting rumours went abroad .
__label__1	It was the sergeant who had spoken to me , and he was now looking round at the company , with his handcuffs invitingly extended towards them in his right hand , and his left on my shoulder .
__label__1	A man has confidence in untried friends , he remembers the many offers of service so freely made by his boon companions when he wanted them not ; he has hope -- the hope of happy inexperience -- and however he may bend beneath the first shock , it springs up in his bosom , and flourishes there for a brief space , until it droops beneath the blight of disappointment and neglect .
__label__1	And the President ’ s <NAME> 94 A Night Steamer on the <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ None of your close shavers the <NAME> ain ’ t .
__label__1	The child answered that that was not its name ; it was a garden -- his brother ’ s .
__label__0	The workmen of Quiquendone are as efficient as those of any other town in the world , you must know ; and we shall go neither to <NAME> nor <NAME> for our models !
__label__0	The fifteen hundred miles was the extent of the frontier which separates colonized <NAME> from the various <NAME> tribes .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , beckoning me aside into a window .
__label__0	He sailed from <NAME> , the port of <NAME> , on the 19th November , 1567 .
__label__1	‘ I have made head against many trials ; but the misery of another , and such misery , is involved in this one , that I declare to you I am rendered desperate , and know not how to act. ’ In truth , it did seem a hopeless case .
__label__1	Mrs Chivery , speaking as a mother and not as a diplomatist , had then , from a different point of view , desired her husband to recollect that their <NAME> had never been strong , and that his love had fretted and worrited him enough as it was , without his being driven to do himself a mischief , as nobody couldn ’ t say he wouldn ’ t be if he was crossed .
__label__1	The old man paused a moment while it was gently closed and fastened on the inside , and satisfied that this was done , walked on at a slow pace .
__label__0	`` I would n't give up my four thousand of the bet , '' said <NAME> , as he took his seat , `` for three thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine . ''
__label__1	And that opens a pretty picture of things , I hope ?
__label__1	I am not speaking of myself , <NAME> , but of her mother , and of her .
__label__1	At first I was painfully awake and vainly tried to lose myself , with my eyes closed , among the scenes of the day .
__label__0	`` Do as he bids , '' replied <NAME> , who was always a strict disciplinarian .
__label__1	`` Would any one believe this ? ''
__label__1	The chance to hush it is to let in these people now in a wrangle with your footmen .
__label__1	‘ But I am more than a lad , ’ said <NAME> , with his clutching hand , ‘ and I WILL be heard , sir. ’ ‘ As a schoolmaster , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ you are always being heard .
__label__1	This is him as I have seen brought up by hand .
__label__1	Tied up all day with his disciplined show upon him , subdued to the performance of his routine of educational tricks , encircled by a gabbling crowd , he broke loose at night like an ill-tamed wild animal .
__label__0	At 11,000 feet all trace of vegetation had disappeared .
__label__1	Mr Dombey would be delighted to leave <NAME> in such admirable guardianship .
__label__1	Who am I , and who is he ? ’ ‘ Professore , ’ returned the ambassador , ‘ and who is <NAME> ? ’ Without appearing at all interested in the latter question , <NAME> angrily whistled Mr Dorrit away .
__label__1	Probably we shall make the most of it that is to be made. ’ ‘ Probably , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	During this whole time the whelp moved about with <NAME> like his shadow , assisting in all the proceedings .
__label__1	When we got outside the door , <NAME> informed me that <NAME> , being now ‘ a little nearer ’ than he used to be , always resorted to this same device before producing a single coin from his store ; and that he endured unheard-of agonies in crawling out of bed alone , and taking it from that unlucky box .
__label__0	“ Your Highness , ” answered <NAME> , “ ask me rather the name of the man who lies at your feet ! ” “ That man , I know him !
__label__0	In the harbour of <NAME> on the coast of <NAME> , <NAME> .
__label__0	`` Seven hundred and seven miles from <NAME> , '' replied <NAME> , with imperturbable calmness .
__label__0	He returned to <NAME> , while <NAME> remained pensive .
__label__1	That I am too old ? ” said <NAME> .
__label__0	After several delays , caused by the desire of the <NAME> Company to make <NAME> give them a testimonial as to the treatment he had met with from the government of <NAME> , and which he steadily refused , <NAME> at last obtained permission to repair his vessel .
__label__1	I made myself known to your sister .
__label__1	The boy , <NAME> , was training for and with a schoolmaster .
__label__1	On one of them , which was a fringed scarf for a dress of ceremony , I saw the armorial bearings of a Noble , and the letter E. “ I saw this , within the first minute of my contemplation of the patient ; for , in her restless strivings she had turned over on her face on the edge of the bed , had drawn the end of the scarf into her mouth , and was in danger of suffocation .
__label__0	From the ocean their gaze returned to the island which they commanded entirely , and the first question was put by <NAME> in these terms : “ About what size is this island ? ” Truly , it did not appear large in the midst of the immense ocean .
__label__0	I will go and repeat at <NAME> all I have seen , all I have heard ; I swear it by <NAME> above !
__label__0	Hence the <NAME> 's <NAME> gives each man eight pounds of meat a day , or twelve pounds of fish , or two pounds of pemmican . ''
__label__1	I admired and loved him , and his approval was return enough .
__label__1	It quite spoiled my pleasure for that night because it was so very embarrassing and so very ridiculous .
__label__1	But the altar of our country sir -- ’ ‘ You ’ ll have a hackney-coach , I suppose ? ’ interrupted the constable , holding <NAME> ( whom his other captors had released ) carelessly by the arm , a little above the elbow .
__label__1	Yielding , therefore , the chair at the bedside to the quaint old housekeeper , <NAME> sits at a table a little removed , sympathetically sighing .
__label__0	Many come to seek fortunes who only find trouble and sorrow , and then they throw the blame on chance , and forget the true cause is their own idleness and vice and want of commonsense .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , ’ cried <NAME> eagerly , as he looked from the coach window , ‘ they are at the corner of the lane still !
__label__1	I will not be put down .
__label__1	Only first exchange that nightcap for some more appropriate covering , or we shall be taken for madmen . '
__label__1	‘ I want to see a ruddier touch here , <NAME> , ’ he said , indicating his own healthy cheek by way of pattern .
__label__0	In a few days the schooner would reach <NAME> d'Acunha , and I should part with her and her captain for good and all .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , <NAME> , certainly -- fifty more if you like to hear ‘ em -- strange life mine -- rather curious history -- not extraordinary , but singular. ’ In this strain , with an occasional glass of ale , by way of parenthesis , when the coach changed horses , did the stranger proceed , until they reached <NAME> bridge , by which time the note-books , both of <NAME> and <NAME> , were completely filled with selections from his adventures .
__label__0	“ I mean this : the guanaco is only good for eating when it is killed in a state of rest .
__label__1	Nor was the scenery , as we approached the junction of the <NAME> and <NAME> rivers , at all inspiriting in its influence .
__label__0	when the happy company thought they had lost their guiding thread !
__label__0	Was he weary of this return to a civilized mode of existence ?
__label__0	A letter had apprised him of the death of his wife , and at the same time of the departure of his daughter , who had obtained from the government an authorization to join him at <NAME> .
__label__1	His scrambling home , from week 's end to week 's end , is like one great washing-day -- only nothing 's washed ! ''
__label__1	The party that had overtaken them , and followed in their train , consisted of only three members : one lady and two gentlemen .
__label__1	And finding nobody about the parlours , it occurred to him , that he could perhaps originate the proceedings with better effect in the kitchen ; so into the kitchen he went .
__label__1	‘ Ah , my poor head ! ’ said Mrs. <NAME> , with a faint smile .
__label__0	A perfect concord ruled the little colony .
__label__0	Where are you ? ” “ <NAME> beneath you , ” laughed the merry fellow .
__label__1	He had a strong idea that the coffin he had seen was running after him ; and , pictured as hopping on behind him , bolt upright , upon its narrow end , always on the point of overtaking him and hopping on at his side -- perhaps taking his arm -- it was a pursuer to shun .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> made at the door .
__label__0	This lasted for three days ; to the inquiry whether he was well treated , he said “ Yes and no ! ” without further answer ; he was a prisoner , and except that he expected immediate execution , his state seemed to him no better than that in which he had left his unfortunate friends .
__label__0	One of the fears he entertained had been that , during his descent , the cord might be cut above him , but he had seen no projection from the walls behind which anyone could have been concealed .
__label__0	`` Well , then , I 'll drink for both of us .
__label__0	This unfortunate beast had scarcely eaten three mouthfuls ; but the offence , the abuse , the crime -- whatever you will -- was committed and duly indicted , for the magistrates , at that time , had already begun to know how to write .
__label__1	that ’ s not a general rule by any means , ’ observed Mrs. Nickleby ; ‘ for I remember , as well as if it was only yesterday , employing one that I was particularly recommended to , to make me a scarlet cloak at the time when scarlet cloaks were fashionable , and she had a very red face -- a very red face , indeed. ’ ‘ Perhaps she drank , ’ suggested <NAME> .
__label__0	said <NAME> , pressing the boatswain 's hand ; and he added , `` In case we do n't come back , <NAME> , wait till the next thaw , and try to push on to the Pole .
__label__0	A Throng of People on the Horizon. -- A Troop of Arabs. -- The Pursuit. -- It is He. -- Fall from Horseback. -- The <NAME> Arab. -- A Ball from Kennedy. -- <NAME> Manoeuvres. -- Caught up flying. -- <NAME> saved at last .
__label__1	Mrs. Tisher at the same time grouped herself behind her chief , as representing <NAME> ’ s first historical female friend at <NAME> fort .
__label__1	It struck me as being not at all like the manner or appearance of a man who had advanced in life by the usual road of years , cares , and experiences .
__label__0	Just as we were about to leave the little port where the raft had been constructed , my uncle , who was very strong as to geographic nomenclature , wanted to give it a name , and among others , suggested mine .
__label__0	They were brought by <NAME> ’ s sons , and <NAME> <NAME> paid the sum stipulated for his various purchases , adding his cordial thanks , which the worthy Irishman valued at least as much as his golden guineas .
__label__1	`` Let me see , <NAME> , '' said I , pretending to consider .
__label__0	Fishes are , of course , unable to live in it , and those which descend through the <NAME> , the Weber , and other streams soon perish .
__label__0	He 's made us scrape against rocks , reefs , and land , as if he had never taken a voyage before !
__label__1	Among my boys , this summer holiday time , I see an old man making giant kites , and gazing at them in the air , with a delight for which there are no words .
__label__1	If any class deserve to be protected and assisted by the Government , it is that class who are banished from their native land in search of the bare means of subsistence .
__label__1	I admire her -- as my friend does -- exceedingly .
__label__0	In the obscurity , then very dense , he found it difficult to see ; but it was a human body that lay there , less than ten paces off , and perfectly motionless !
__label__0	They were therefore under the necessity of traveling six hundred miles before they could tread a free soil .
__label__1	inquired <NAME> , turning to the doctor .
__label__1	The evil spirit of his life had flitted away again , months ago , and he had heard no more of her since .
__label__0	He soon made some snares with creepers , by the aid of which the warren henceforth every day furnished its quota of rodents .
__label__1	‘ Now , I pass to sick and deranged impressions ; they are so strong , that I rely upon them ; but there are spaces between them that I know nothing about , and they are not pervaded by any idea of time .
__label__0	At seven o'clock in the morning , the thermometer stood at 8° above zero .
__label__1	‘ I won ’ t take one of the others , ’ said <NAME> , tying the knots of the bundle very tight , in the severity of her resolution .
__label__1	You hear ; I think that ’ s apology enough. ’ ‘ You will not understand me , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	As I found ( after pacifying him ) that he was a little boy with a naturally large head , I thought that perhaps where his head could go , his body could follow , and mentioned that the best mode of extrication might be to push him forward .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , does it ? ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	It was drowned in the tintinnabulation of the gong , which sounding again with great fury , there was a general move towards the dining-room ; still excepting <NAME> the stony boy , who remained where he was , and as he was ; and on its way to whom <NAME> presently encountered a round of bread , genteelly served on a plate and napkin , and with a silver fork lying crosswise on the top of it .
__label__1	It flattered him to picture to himself , this proud and stately woman doing the honours of his house , and chilling his guests after his own manner .
__label__1	We was living then in a solitary place , but among the beautifullest trees , and with the roses a-covering our <NAME> to the roof .
__label__0	“ It is by their movements that the velocity of light has been calculated ; and they have been made available for the determination of terrestrial longitudes. ” “ It must be a wonderful sight , ” said the captain .
__label__1	It is no distance -- comparatively speaking ; and though consideration is due to the kindness of your proposal , I assure you that is a mere matter of form. ’ Shall I ever forget how , in a moment , he was the most sanguine of men , looking on to fortune ; or how Mrs. Micawber presently discoursed about the habits of the kangaroo !
__label__1	He always concluded by addressing <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ All night long , ’ pursued the other , hurriedly , ‘ I had dreams of him -- and yet I didn ’ t sleep -- in his blood .
__label__1	If you want information regarding your uncle Provis , you had much better come and tell no one , and lose no time .
__label__1	`` Now , mistress , '' says the lawyer , tapping the key hastily upon the chimney-piece .
__label__0	When these tempests are at their height the sea seethes and boils . ''
__label__1	From the exterior of <NAME> 's Shooting Gallery , and the long entry , and the bare perspective beyond it , <NAME> augurs well .
__label__1	‘ Very seasonable. ’ ‘ Seasonablest veather I ever see , sir , ’ rejoined <NAME> .
__label__0	There was not a shadow of doubt on that point .
__label__0	said the burgomaster , passing his handkerchief over his rubicund face .
__label__1	‘ Compliments. ’ ‘ Love ! ’ repeated <NAME> , with a little stamp of her foot .
__label__0	The worst thing about it is the delay it would cause ; but it would save us great fatigue , and perhaps danger .
__label__0	why was <NAME> so much worse ?
__label__1	What ’ s the matter ? ’ <NAME> persisted that there was nothing the matter ; and maintained it so resolutely , that his nephew had no resource but to make a very indifferent imitation of believing him .
__label__1	The afternoon wore away , however , and he did not appear .
__label__1	What is a dainty repast to <NAME> is then set before him , and he begins to gulp the coffee and to gnaw the bread and butter , looking anxiously about him in all directions as he eats and drinks , like a scared animal .
__label__0	That is much deeper than where you have been yet ; it may be fifty or sixty feet , and you will have to support a pressure of quite two atmospheres .
__label__1	Oh , pray stop them , Mr Quilp ! ’ ‘ I ’ ll stop ‘ em , ’ cried <NAME> , diving into the little counting-house and returning with a thick stick , ‘ I ’ ll stop ‘ em .
__label__1	I have supposed the head to be all-sufficient .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> for ever ! ’ roared the honest and independent .
__label__1	I ’ m quick to take this fright , I know , and my head is summ ’ at light with wearying and watching. ’ ‘ There , there , there ! ’ returned <NAME> .
__label__1	This one was a sailor , with two anchors and a flag and G. F. T. on his arm .
__label__0	A religious family , like that of <NAME> ’ s , had availed themselves enthusiastically of this occasion of taking him with them .
__label__0	I asked with anxious interest .
__label__1	Permit me , sir -- if you hold the card a little slanting , this way , you catch the light upon the up-stroke .
__label__0	When the whole earth got cool in the first hours of the world 's morning , the diminution of the volume of the earth produced a state of dislocation in its upper crust , followed by ruptures , crevasses and fissures .

__label__1	One summer afternoon ; a year , wanting some odd days , after the marriage in the <NAME> church ; there was a buzz and whisper upon ‘ Change of a great failure .
__label__0	Any stranger entering the mine was brought before <NAME> , that he might give an account of himself .
__label__0	They were puzzled by the reserve of a man generally so talkative ; on this occasion they had to drag the words out of his mouth ; usually he was a ready story-teller , now he gave only evasive answers to the questions of the rest .
__label__0	`` You have found the castaway ? ''
__label__1	That ’ s an under-handed mind , sir. ’ ‘ Do you say there ’ s something against him ? ’ <NAME> asks .
__label__1	I always say the same of you. ’ ‘ That ’ s “ Curse <NAME> with all my heart ! ” then , if you do , ’ thought <NAME> , as <NAME> hurried out .
__label__0	They were discouraged by the death of <NAME> .
__label__1	Not , however , that <NAME> would do here alone. ’ Mr <NAME> was going to say ‘ No ? ’ interrogatively , but he saw his danger and said it assentingly , ‘ <NAME> , Oh dear no ; she wouldn ’ t do here alone. ’ ‘ No , <NAME> .
__label__1	I say it ’ s obstinacy , and nothing shall ever convince me that it isn ’ t .
__label__1	You don ’ t know what <NAME> is , sir , when he is aroused by anything that appeals to his feelings very strongly ; then he is terrific , sir , is <NAME> , absolutely terrific .
__label__0	The salt produced by these wâdys , or depressions of the soil , form an important article of commerce with <NAME> and the whole of the <NAME> .
__label__0	Besieged in his capital by a large force , he saw himself all at once deprived of the aid of those for whose advantage he had incurred so great a risk .
__label__1	In a word , I never saw anybody so thoroughly jovial as <NAME> was , down to the very last moment of the evening , when I took a hearty farewell of himself and his amiable wife .
__label__0	His able geographical and historical book at once provoked plentiful criticism .
__label__1	You haven ’ t seen a beadle lately ? ’ ‘ As an Englishman who has been more than twenty years in <NAME> , no. ’ ‘ Then , ’ said Mr Meagles , laying his forefinger on his companion ’ s breast with great animation , ‘ don ’ t you see a beadle , now , if you can help it .
__label__1	He had come into the office of the station , from its interior , in an unsettled way , immediately after <NAME> had gone out to the train ; and he had been hurriedly reading the printed bills and notices on the wall .
__label__0	Where were we to come out ?
__label__1	And thus poor <NAME> sickened and grew worse , and fell into heavy danger of death , and lay severely ill for many a long round of day and night .
__label__1	`` Why , I would n't pass another night there for any consideration that you could offer me , '' says <NAME> , haggardly staring .
__label__1	‘ I should like to sleep on that question to-night , ’ he answered doubtfully .
__label__1	My dear , for the moment -- true .
__label__1	It comes over me at times. ’ Was it gone ?
__label__1	‘ At least , ’ said Mr Inspector , ‘ you will not object to leave me your card , sir ? ’ ‘ I should not object , if I had one ; but I have not. ’ He reddened and was much confused as he gave the answer .
__label__1	‘ What will you take to go out ? ’ I beg your pardon , ’ replied <NAME> .
__label__1	He laughed as he retired with the bird -- it was a plump one .
__label__0	`` Faith , '' muttered <NAME> , somewhat flurried , `` I 've seen people at <NAME> 's as lively as my new master ! ''
__label__1	Then kindness requires that I should n't go near them -- and I wo n't . ''
__label__1	I told him that he was more like himself in those latter words than in anything he had said yet .
__label__0	There , under the intelligent hands of the engineer and his companions , everything prospered .
__label__1	But with such an extraordinary compromise between an unqualified assent and a qualified dissent , that his visitor was much disconcerted .
__label__0	They were able , however , to turn to account some empty tins which had contained soups ; the labels , although dirty and tarnished , were much admired by the natives , one of whom strutted proudly about for some days wearing an empty tin on his head , bearing four labels of `` concentrated essence of meat . ''
__label__0	“ And what has become , ” he said , “ of all our old comrades in <NAME> ? ” “ As far as I can tell you , ” answered the captain , “ they are all in <NAME> still ; only <NAME> isn ’ t by any means where we expected to find it. ” “ And <NAME> ?
__label__0	The night is passed in temporary huts made of the leaves of the heliconia , brought on purpose .
__label__1	One face , and not an agreeable one , though it was handsome , seemed maliciously watchful of this pretty girl , and indeed of every one and everything there .
__label__0	“ That is agreed , ” said <NAME> at length .
__label__1	‘ The veil that has long been interposed between Mrs. Micawber and myself , is now withdrawn , ’ said <NAME> ; ‘ and my children and the <NAME> of their Being can once more come in contact on equal terms. ’ As we were all very grateful to him , and all desirous to show that we were , as well as the hurry and disorder of our spirits would permit , I dare say we should all have gone , but that it was necessary for <NAME> to return to her father , as yet unable to bear more than the dawn of hope ; and for someone else to hold <NAME> in safe keeping .
__label__1	In my weakness and entire dependence on him , the dear fellow had fallen into the old tone , and called me by the old names , the dear “ old Pip , old chap , ” that now were music in my ears .
__label__1	My shoes were by this time in a woeful condition .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> ! -- On Tuesday last , at <NAME> ’ s , <NAME> , by the <NAME> Reverend the <NAME> of <NAME> , <NAME> , of <NAME> , <NAME> , to <NAME> , only daughter of the late <NAME> , <NAME> , of <NAME> .
__label__1	I needn ’ t tell you , <NAME> , that I am under great obligations to Mr Headstone , and that I am very anxious for Mr Headstone to succeed in all he undertakes .
__label__1	Several players were stationed , to ‘ look out , ’ in different parts of the field , and each fixed himself into the proper attitude by placing one hand on each knee , and stooping very much as if he were ‘ making a back ’ for some beginner at leap-frog .
__label__1	She was bent , they told me , on committing suicide .
__label__1	You are travelling for amusement and instruction .
__label__0	`` You are right , <NAME> , and if we mean to make <NAME> by the 20th of April , we must go under steam , or we shall be cast on the coast of Labrador. -- Mr .
__label__0	He gave his orders in a clear voice , not repeating them , but so as to be heard at once , and he was understood .
__label__1	The rooms were low and damp , the clammy walls were pierced with chinks and holes , the rotten floors had sunk from their level , the very beams started from their places and warned the timid stranger from their neighbourhood .
__label__1	Mr Merdle is a most extensive merchant , his transactions are on the vastest scale , his wealth and influence are very great , but even he -- Bird , be quiet ! ’ The parrot had shrieked another shriek ; and it filled up the sentence so expressively that <NAME> was under no necessity to end it .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> moved his arm again , then his head , and a few incomprehensible words escaped him .
__label__1	‘ “ First , ” ’ said <NAME> , ‘ “ When <NAME> ’ s faculties and memory for business became , through causes into which it is not necessary or expedient for me to enter , weakened and confused , -- HEEP -- designedly perplexed and complicated the whole of the official transactions .
__label__0	Our feet crushed with a dry and crackling sound the remains of those prehistoric fossils , for which the museums of great cities quarrel , even when they obtain only rare and curious morsels .
__label__0	The huge volcano which was the first stage of our daring experiment is above five thousand feet high .
__label__1	It was now <NAME> 's turn to approach the gate : which he did , holding his breath .
__label__0	It was singular , to be sure , but it was really a fact .
__label__1	‘ Look at yourself in the glass. ’ Mr Merdle involuntarily turned his eyes in the direction of the nearest mirror , and asked , with a slow determination of his turbid blood to his temples , whether a man was to be called to account for his digestion ?
__label__0	The tempests which are frequent during the seasons of the equinox , and which are so prolific in catastrophes , are above all terrible over this immense ocean , which opposes no obstacle to their fury .
__label__1	I told <NAME> I would make haste back and inquired of <NAME> as we went in whether there was not a gentleman with <NAME> .
__label__0	Their knowledge of mathematics and astronomy facilitated their settlement and enabled them to gather , as well from the ancient annals of the country , as during their journies , a prodigious quantity of most valuable information concerning the history , ethnography , and geography of the <NAME> .
__label__0	The latter were preparing to charge , when some of the more moderate among the officers caused an arrangement to be entered into , by virtue of which <NAME> was to withdraw to his own province after receiving 100,000 pesos to defray the expenses of the armament .
__label__0	For some moments there was silence under that dark and gloomy vault .
__label__1	‘ For her own sake , ’ repeated <NAME> , warming , ‘ and for her brother ’ s , and as a perfectly disinterested person. ’ ‘ Really , <NAME> , ’ remarked the dressmaker , ‘ since it comes to this , we must positively turn you with your face to the wall. ’ She had hardly done so , when <NAME> arrived , and showed some surprise on seeing <NAME> there , and <NAME> shaking her little fist at him close before her eyes , and the <NAME> Mrs T. with her face to the wall .
__label__1	<NAME> comes up to make herself useful , and falls to work immediately .
__label__1	In case you was to think it , ’ said Mr Boffin , with a look of peculiar shrewdness , ‘ so honourably independent in you as to make it a relief to your mind , to make that furniture over to me in the light of a set-off against the quarter ’ s rent , why ease your mind , ease your mind .
__label__1	That was the subject in my mind .
__label__1	‘ By-the-bye , I HAVE thought of somebody too .
__label__0	His joy overflowed , not in long phrases , but in short ejaculations .
__label__0	“ Nothing. ” “ Have patience. ” “ Is the time approaching when you will force the old woman to speak ? ” “ It is approaching , Sangarre. ” “ When will the old woman speak ? ” “ When we reach Tomsk. ” “ And we shall be there -- ” “ In three days. ” A strange gleam shot from <NAME> ’ s great black eyes , and she retired with a calm step .
__label__1	The whole place seemed restless and troubled ; and the people were crowding and flitting to and fro , like the shadows in an uneasy dream .
__label__0	> There are also inconsistent spellings , for example `` aluminum '' and > '' aluminium '' .
__label__1	<NAME> again turned to her maid and took counsel with her in a low voice , while Rob the round-eyed , mindful of his patron ’ s secret charge , looked on and listened .
__label__1	Not of late years , ’ replied the <NAME> , with a flourish of his hand .
__label__1	“ It is true what madame says , ” observed <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> , down with him , fifty fathoms down ; his struggles grew fainter and fainter , until they wholly ceased .
__label__1	Having got behind the hedge , and put him in the light , I took a shot at him and brought him down plump .
__label__1	When there is not , the character of the scenery is always the same .
__label__0	`` It must then be admitted that the document has already a distant date ? ''
__label__1	He will , he will indeed. ’ ‘ He wull , he wull ! ’ replied <NAME> impatiently .
__label__1	said the board , looking very knowing ; 'we are the fellows to set this to rights ; we 'll stop it all , in no time . '
__label__1	Would you ? ” and began dancing backwards and forwards in a manner quite unparalleled within my limited experience .
__label__1	“ You scarcely seem to like your hand , ” said <NAME> , with the greatest composure .
__label__1	I only brought it in joke. ’ ‘ You had better be careful how you indulge in such jokes again , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ or you may find an allusion to pulling noses rather a dangerous reminder for the subject of your facetiousness .
__label__1	‘ She ’ ll never get better as long as you ’ re here. ’ All the ladies concurred in this opinion ; so <NAME> was pushed out of the room , and requested to give himself an airing in the back yard .
__label__0	All approached , and saw to their extreme surprise , a boat floating down the current .
__label__1	I mean , Mrs. Bagnet , there he was , dying without ever having been taught much more than to know his right hand from his left .
__label__0	`` A fine lesson for princes , who thus in their lives are reminded that they are mortal , and that after their death the earth which contains their corpse will not be their own .
__label__1	<NAME> is no object here .
__label__0	He was so young to die !
__label__1	His blood is infected , and objects lose their natural aspects in his sight .
__label__1	I ’ ll slit his nose and ears , flog him , maim him for life .
__label__1	<NAME> sighed , and shook his head despondingly .
__label__1	A pause succeeded , during which the honest and irrepressible baby made a series of leaps and crows at little Jane , who appeared to me to be the only member of the family ( irrespective of servants ) with whom it had any decided acquaintance .
__label__0	They were separated one from the other , and disabled , but they succeeded in meeting together again , and by the 14th of July , the squall had carried them within sight of <NAME> .
__label__0	And having shaken hands with his friends , on the 12th of November , at six o'clock A.M. , after strictly informing them not to open his prison before the 20th , at six o'clock P.M. , he slid down the projectile , the plate of which was at once hermetically sealed .
__label__1	`` He would n't keep out of <NAME> , and I suppose he 's over head and ears in debt .
__label__0	`` Are those from <NAME> of any interest ? ''
__label__1	<NAME> in the deepening gloom looks down upon the ground , half frightened and half shy .
__label__0	[ Illustration ] `` They were never buried , '' cried the doctor ; `` these poor men were surprised by death as we find them . ''
__label__1	`` You said about ten , '' Tony repeats .
__label__1	She fades in her turn , and he fades , and all fades , and there is no flute , no Master , no <NAME> , no <NAME> , no anything but heavy sleep .
__label__1	‘ My dear , I have remained all night at my table , pondering again and again on what has so painfully passed between us .
__label__0	It was useless to contemplate removing him to <NAME> , for he had expressed his wish to remain in the midst of those marvels of the “ Nautilus ” which millions could not have purchased , and to wait there for that death which was swiftly approaching .
__label__1	chatters Grandfather Smallweed , swallowing his rage .
__label__0	The steward was choking under the grip of his powerful hand .
__label__0	For the first time the long line of coast which forms the peninsula of <NAME> , the <NAME> of <NAME> , and the base of the Gulf of <NAME> , had been explored continuously from cape to cape .
__label__0	The bears , which were extremely numerous at that period of the year , made frequent visits to the crew .
__label__1	'Ah , to be sure , ' said the <NAME> ; 'when is it to be done , <NAME> ? '
__label__0	`` Two of their number , '' says the narrative , `` which carried about sixty armed men , approached within hearing , and the natives began their war-song , but seeing that this attracted little attention , they began throwing stones at the <NAME> , and paddled along the shore .
__label__0	At that moment the trembling of the screw sensibly diminished , then it stopped entirely .
__label__0	This would be utter folly , and it was hard to admit that <NAME> was such a fool .
__label__1	To this , Mrs. Nickleby only replied that she durst say she was very stupid , indeed she had no doubt she was , for her own children almost as much as told her so , every day of her life ; to be sure she was a little older than they , and perhaps some foolish people might think she ought reasonably to know best .
__label__1	Such are the changes which a few years bring about , and so do things pass away , like a tale that is told !
__label__1	Boats were putting off , torches were lighting up , people were rushing tumultuously to the water ’ s edge .
__label__0	the soul of the little colony !
__label__0	The <NAME> still floated ; some streaks of light were filtering through the liquid beds .
__label__1	At that meal , for which he had no appetite , everything was quite as solemn and genteel as at the others ; and when it was finished , he followed <NAME> upstairs .
__label__1	He said , shaking hands with me , ‘ Copperfield , you are a true friend ; but when the worst comes to the worst , no man is without a friend who is possessed of shaving materials. ’ At this dreadful hint Mrs. Micawber threw her arms round <NAME> ’ s neck and entreated him to be calm .
__label__1	Thoroughly used to him as he was , he found something new and strained in him that was for the moment perplexing .
__label__1	She is very sensible of your handsome intentions , and wishes you good evening , and wishes you well . ''
__label__0	<NAME> not the journey being accomplished under the most favorable circumstances ?
__label__0	It seems as if the ship had rather foundered than blown up. ” “ Does that astonish you , my boy ? ” asked the engineer .
__label__1	“ You get me a file. ” He tilted me again .
__label__1	“ What , ” said <NAME> , varying his apostrophe after missing his mark -- “ what are you up to , <NAME> ? ” “ I was only saying my prayers. ” “ Saying your prayers !
__label__1	‘ He ’ s very sorry for giving offence .
__label__1	And my eldest brother lean ’ d upon his sword , Mr Boffin , And wiped away a tear. ’ Much impressed by this family circumstance , and also by the friendly disposition of Mr Wegg , as exemplified in his so soon dropping into poetry , Mr Boffin again shook hands with that ligneous sharper , and besought him to name his hour .
__label__0	In a few moments , however , my thoughts were far away , back in my <NAME> home , with <NAME> and the old cook .
__label__0	“ That was an attack for you ! ” said <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ It seems to me , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ that you have had no money at all , ever since we have been married. ’ ‘ What seems to you , ’ said Mr Lammle , ‘ to have been the case , may possibly have been the case .
__label__1	Until then , good-bye. ’ As <NAME> said this , he got into the coach which had by this time arrived , followed by the tipstaff .
__label__1	I beg your pardon ! ” said <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ What your uncle says is very true , <NAME> , my dear , ’ said Mrs. Nickleby .
__label__1	He had a brown hat on his head , and a dirty belcher handkerchief round his neck : with the long frayed ends of which he smeared the beer from his face as he spoke .
__label__1	‘ And is gone , I know not where. ’ ‘ He should ha ’ stopped and fought it out , <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> contemptuously .
__label__1	He picked the people up at <NAME> , I think ? ’ The phrase would have given nobody mortal offence .
__label__1	`` Not that it affects you , though , I 'm sure , '' said <NAME> , putting up the steps .
__label__0	`` I 'll never answer a question reasonable or unreasonable , unless it is asked in a proper manner ! ''
__label__1	It would avail me nothing to extenuate it now .
__label__0	It was , however , not the only source of revenue ; and <NAME> calculated , that deducting the maintenance of troops , the pay of the civil officers , and all the expenses of the administration , the King of <NAME> drew no less than ten million francs from the <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ But , <NAME> bless me ! ’ cried Mr Meagles , rubbing his hands with a relish , ‘ it was an uncommonly pleasant thing being in quarantine , wasn ’ t it ?
__label__1	It is true that How not to do it was the great study and object of all public departments and professional politicians all round the <NAME> Office .
__label__1	And seven o ’ clock in the evening finds him trotting out into <NAME> , to trot to the corner and save a sixpence in coach-hire .
__label__1	`` Ha ' n't you no relations , now , '' asks <NAME> with a twinkle in his eyes , `` who would pay off this little principal or who would lend you a good name or two that I could persuade my friend in the city to make you a further advance upon ?
__label__0	`` What are you doing here ? ''
__label__1	For on his beginning to review , with the vivacity natural to himself and to his situation , the leading points in his own affairs , he soon discovered that the <NAME> had relapsed into his former profound state of mind ; and that while he eyed him steadfastly from beneath his bushy eyebrows , he evidently neither saw nor heard him , but remained immersed in cogitation .
__label__0	<NAME> movable desks , made to slide in and out at will , allowed one to rest one 's book while reading .
__label__1	‘ You are as right as right can be , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> ‘ and far be it from me to tell you otherwise .
__label__1	While we were still on our way to those detached apartments across the paved yard at the back , he asked me how often I had seen <NAME> eat and drink ; offering me a breadth of choice , as usual , between a hundred times and once .
__label__1	She was sinking under a painful and incurable disease , and wished to recover him before she died .
__label__0	He knew that the shores of the lake were frequented by huge alligators , and was well aware of the voracity of those monsters .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> watched his strange adversary with visible anxiety .
__label__0	But he had failed to realize how it might extend to <NAME> ; and when now he was obliged with his own eyes to witness the waves of ocean rolling over what once had been the lovely shores of <NAME> , he was well-nigh frantic with desperation .
__label__1	How long have I been here ? ” For , I had a strange and strong misgiving that I had been lying there a long time -- a day and a night , -- two days and nights , -- more .
__label__1	I am sure I hardly know how it ’ s done ! ’ ‘ Are many of the young ladies with you ? ’ I inquired .
__label__1	If the question concerned an outfit for <NAME> , <NAME> would know all about it and would be quite excited .
__label__1	He was a very easy , pleasant fellow indeed , and his manners were exceedingly winning .
__label__1	On his house-top , he displayed pike and cap , as a good citizen must , and in a window he had stationed his saw inscribed as his “ Little Sainte Guillotine ” -- for the great sharp female was by that time popularly canonised .
__label__1	On the sideboard a variety of miscellaneous articles were huddled together , the most conspicuous of which were some very cloudy fish-sauce cruets , a couple of driving-boxes , two or three whips , and as many travelling shawls , a tray of knives and forks , and the mustard .
__label__0	“ We are not making progress , ” said the doctor .
__label__0	`` Is there really no way of warning him ? ''
__label__1	During the whole interval , whenever I went to the bottom of the staircase , I heard her footstep , saw her light pass above , and heard her ceaseless low cry .
__label__1	Say what you mean. ’ ‘ Merely , my dear fellow , that I have the honour and pleasure of a speaking acquaintance with such a Patriarch as you describe , and that I address him as Mr Aaron , because it appears to me <NAME> , expressive , appropriate , and complimentary .
__label__1	It 's only a question between the larger sum and the smaller .
__label__1	They were very fond of one another : that was certain .
__label__1	Being engaged in the adjustment of some accounts -- an occupation to which the silence and solitude of his retreat were very favourable -- he had not strayed from his den for two whole days .
__label__1	And so I worked at home and did cleaning and nursing and washing for a long time before I began to go out .
__label__0	<NAME> confirmed the <NAME> guide 's narrative of her touching history .
__label__0	Then he continued , — “ Now , fellow-shareholders , follow me , and let us start for the <NAME> Pole. ” And the audience rose as if to pack their baggage ready for shipboard .
__label__0	cried <NAME> : `` well , a very fanciful eye may detect a face , though , for the sake of <NAME> 's beauteous sister , I regret to say , a terribly pockmarked one ! ''
__label__0	By-the-way , the moon did come up , too , and all red , as if she was in a rage. ” While the three friends went on chatting of this and other things , and <NAME> examined the luminary of night from an entirely novel point of view , the heavens became covered with heavy clouds to the northward , and the lowering masses assumed a most sinister and threatening look .
__label__0	“ And now , corporal , what is your business with me ? ” asked <NAME> .
__label__0	`` Because I am an <NAME> ? ''
__label__1	“ He ( pointing to the young gentleman in sky-blue ) is the only son of the powerful <NAME> of Filletoville. ” ‘ “ Well then , my dear , I ’ m afraid he ’ ll never come to the title , ” said my uncle , looking coolly at the young gentleman as he stood fixed up against the wall , in the cockchafer fashion that I have described .
__label__1	Alter this law , sir , and what will be the effect of your rash proceeding on a class of practitioners very worthily represented , allow me to say to you , by the opposite attorney in the case , <NAME> ?
__label__0	It must in all truth be confessed , things as yet had gone on well , and I should have acted in bad taste to have complained .
__label__1	<NAME> and dark he found it .
__label__0	The depth of the sea is not great at <NAME> -- not more than some hundreds of fathoms ; but towards the south is a depression of 1,500 fathoms .
__label__1	He delighted to live , barrack-fashion , among the elegant furniture , and he bullied the very pictures with his origin .
__label__1	Yet he said it with so much meaning , too , that I felt he as perfectly understood <NAME> to be my benefactress , as I understood the fact myself .
__label__1	‘ Why , you see , ’ said Mr Perch , first turning round to shut the door carefully , ‘ she takes what has happened in our <NAME> so much to heart , <NAME> .
__label__0	He was sure his strength would return more quickly in his room , with the air and sight of the sea !
__label__1	<NAME> , ’ said that excellent gentleman , lowering his voice , ‘ there is the most trifling , the most excusable breach of confidence in what I am about to say ; and yet if my friend Pyke there overheard it -- such is that man ’ s delicate sense of honour , Mrs. Nickleby -- he ’ d have me out before dinner-time. ’ Mrs. <NAME> cast an apprehensive glance at the warlike <NAME> , who had walked to the window ; and <NAME> , squeezing her hand , went on : ‘ Your daughter has made a conquest -- a conquest on which I may congratulate you .
__label__1	`` Do n't you be afraid of that .
__label__0	This vessel was especially equipped for a voyage of discovery upon the <NAME> coast .
__label__1	‘ It is not worth my while , ’ pursues <NAME> , becoming handsomely mollified , ‘ and it is the reverse of important to my position .
__label__1	No , my Life ! ’ ‘ Good-bye , dearest Pa. Good-bye ! ’ ‘ Good-bye , my darling !
__label__1	Mr <NAME> did not return upon the next day , or the next , or for several days ; and in the meanwhile <NAME> , without any new alarm , lived like a quiet bird in a cage , at the top of the old Instrument-maker ’ s house .
__label__0	It was <NAME> , slightly wounded in the shoulder , and <NAME> , safe and sound , whom their friends received with open arms .
__label__1	`` She has no daughter of her own , has she ? ''
__label__1	As this change stole on <NAME> , once like sunshine in the <NAME> ’ s house , the <NAME> became older in appearance , and more grave ; but the sweetness of his temper , the placid kindness of his manner , and his benevolent solicitude for her , if they were capable of any increase , were increased .
__label__0	“ The savage wretches ! ” exclaimed <NAME> , trembling with indignation .
__label__1	Mr Clennam is a very gentlemanly man -- very gentlemanly .
__label__1	I was ingenuous and young , and I thought so .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> often examined the channels , and decided , in consequence of the shape of the southern coast , to attempt a passage in that direction .
__label__0	`` To-morrow , '' added the <NAME> , rising , `` to-morrow , at twenty minutes to three p.m. , the <NAME> shall float , and leave the <NAME> of <NAME> uninjured . ''
__label__1	Tell me of my ingratitude .
__label__0	But the <NAME> , remembering what had happened to them in the <NAME> , refused the invitation while presenting compliments and excuses to the king .
__label__1	‘ Eh ? ’ cried the old man , surveying him from head to foot .
__label__1	The more you value your number one , the more careful you must be of mine ; so we come at last to what I told you at first -- that a regard for number one holds us all together , and must do so , unless we would all go to pieces in company . '
__label__1	It would be worth no man ’ s while to mislead me ; it would really be too easy -- too poor a success , to yield any satisfaction .
__label__1	Now , Mr <NAME> ’ s gentleman has it whispered in his ear that this witness is disposed to be friendly to the prisoner -- which , to say the truth , he is rather glad to hear , as his strength is considered to lie in what is familiarly termed badgering .
__label__1	I tell you she has designs on Pa. And more than that , I tell you Pa considers her such a wonder , such a paragon of accomplishment , and such an acquisition to our family , that he is ready to get himself into a state of perfect infatuation with her at any moment .
__label__0	`` I should as soon believe in one calculation as in the other. -- But -- by the by -- why does not such extreme heat cook us all up like so many beefsteaks ? ''
__label__1	In short , sir , ’ with an irrepressible outburst , ‘ in the passion into which he lashed me , I would have cut him down if I could , and I tried to do it. ’ ‘ You have clenched that hand again , ’ is <NAME> ’ s quiet commentary .
__label__0	The King , Seif-Ed-din , who was then reigning over <NAME> , was still a child , and his Prime Minister , Kodja-Atar , a skilful and cunning diplomatist , governed in the king 's name .
__label__1	‘ That ain ’ t no word for it .
__label__1	O Tom , tell me the truth ! ’ ‘ I don ’ t know what you mean , <NAME> ! ’ ‘ As you lie here alone , my dear , in the melancholy night , so you must lie somewhere one night , when even I , if I am living then , shall have left you .
__label__0	He was standing at the fore part near his flag , which a slight breeze displayed above his head .
__label__1	The objects he had lately pursued , turned worthless beside her ; such success as was almost in his grasp , he flung away from him like the dirt it was , compared with her .
__label__0	A new discovery was made on the 5th of September .
__label__0	It was not that any one of them regretted the fatigue they had so heedlessly endured or the dangers they had run , but they felt their hope of success was gone , for there was no chance of coming across <NAME> between the <NAME> and the sea , as <NAME> must have heard if any prisoners had fallen into the hands of the <NAME> on the coast of the <NAME> .
__label__1	But <NAME> has spared you this , R.W. , whatever it may have thought proper to inflict upon her ! ’ Here Mrs <NAME> burst into tears .
__label__1	What , surely must I understand ? ” “ That I can not wish to renew that chance intercourse with you of long ago , under these different circumstances .
__label__0	That is the substance of what I told <NAME> .
__label__0	He was a much-esteemed physician at <NAME> .
__label__1	Even when that event had happened , to the great relief of everybody , he was heard under the portico , during the rest of the ceremony , now fainter , now louder , now hushed , now bursting forth again with an irrepressible sense of his wrongs .
__label__0	The settlers then approached the ape and gazed at it attentively .
__label__0	Day and night he persevered in his astronomical pursuits , declared his intention of never abandoning his comet , and swore positively that nothing should induce him to set foot in the car of the balloon .
__label__0	The animals had also perished in the catastrophe ; the birds , as well as those representing the fauna of the island -- all either crushed or drowned , and the unfortunate Jup himself had , alas !
__label__0	The weather was very bad .
__label__1	cried the doctor , as usual , all in a bustle .
__label__1	`` You 're a dear , good , wise , quiet , blessed girl ; but you have your prepossessions .
__label__1	'Well , ' said the undertaker 's wife , when <NAME> had finished his supper : which she had regarded in silent horror , and with fearful auguries of his future appetite : 'have you done ? '
__label__0	As to the next two words , <NAME> and <NAME> , it is only <NAME> that has any meaning to us. ” “ But that is a valuable scrap of information , ” said <NAME> .
__label__0	We stood it on end .
__label__0	`` But if the vegetable and animal productions of this country , '' says <NAME> , `` are similar to those of many others , its aspect can not be compared with them , and I doubt whether the deep valleys of the <NAME> and <NAME> offer so terrible , and at the same time so picturesque , a prospect .
__label__1	‘ I can ’ t , I daren ’ t. ’ ‘ Help !
__label__0	`` I do n't know , officer , '' replied the <NAME> , listening attentively to a confused murmur which came through the thick branches .
__label__0	Just at that moment <NAME> ’ s horse gave a smothered neigh and disappeared .
__label__1	Is n't there bright eyes somewheres , wot you love the thoughts on ? ” O Estella , <NAME> !
__label__0	or a new torture invented by these blacks ?
__label__0	Such being the case , it can be easily understood how a sudden jerk would separate the front from the hinder part .
__label__1	`` So am I , they tell me . ''
__label__1	The little play of feature that his face presented , was cut deep into it , in a few hard curves that made it more like work ; and he had certain notches in his forehead , which looked as though <NAME> had been about to touch them into sensibility or refinement , when she had impatiently thrown away the chisel , and said : ‘ I really can not be worried to finish off this man ; let him go as he is. ’ With too great length of throat at his upper end , and too much ankle-bone and heel at his lower ; with an awkward and hesitating manner ; with a shambling walk ; and with what is called a near sight—which perhaps prevented his observing how much white cotton stocking he displayed to the public eye , in contrast with his black suit—Mr .
__label__1	‘ I have almost forgotten that there is anything to do in the world but to go out tossing on the sea here .
__label__0	`` A splendid fellow , '' said my uncle ; `` only he little suspects the marvelous part he is about to play in the history of the world . ''
__label__0	Who could have believed it possible ? ” “ Let us get on , ” was the engineer ’ s invariable reply .
__label__0	The women , though sad-looking and mournful , had rather agreeable features , without much expression .
__label__1	Yes , ’ said <NAME> , aloud , as he locked his iron safe .
__label__0	The islands which <NAME> calls the islands of the Papuans are <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , which are situated almost immediately below the equator .
__label__1	This glorious establishment had been early in the field , when the one sublime principle involving the difficult art of governing a country , was first distinctly revealed to statesmen .
__label__1	The old man , having obeyed his directions , sat down on the edge of a chair , and , folding his hands before him , gradually yielded to the influence of the warmth , and dozed .
__label__0	We could hear it increasing in volume every moment .
__label__0	We made a brief pause at the place where <NAME> and <NAME> seized upon the boat which bore them towards higher latitudes , even to that horizon of dark vapour whose rents permitted them to discern the huge human figure , the white giant .
__label__0	Some leagues beyond are the ruins of <NAME> or <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> and I do not forget our duty -- what is my duty is <NAME> 's , as we have often said together -- and with your approval and consent , father , we will devote ourselves to making your life agreeable . ''
__label__0	Nothing more until the moment when , like lightning , I saw the undaunted Captain hanging on to one of the creature 's fins , struggling , as it were , hand to hand with the monster , and dealing successive blows at his enemy , yet still unable to give a decisive one .
__label__0	<NAME> , close to him , said one word , “ The knout ! ” “ Yes , ” cried <NAME> , who could no longer restrain himself ; “ the knout for this wretched old woman -- the knout to the death ! ” A Tartar soldier bearing this terrible instrument of torture approached <NAME> .
__label__1	`` My dear boy , '' said <NAME> , `` I am harder with myself when I do anything that gives you pain .
__label__1	<NAME> else at your time of life , and after what has passed -- my dear <NAME> , I have lost my pocket handkerchief again -- would be glad to leave here , one would suppose. ’ ‘ I should not like to feel , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ as if the house was avoided .
__label__0	But even these undertakings , <NAME> 's computation of the <NAME> arc , the calculations which determined the latitude and longitude of certain large cities in <NAME> , and a map which gave the environs of <NAME> in detail with geometrical exactitude , were still insufficient data for a map of <NAME> .
__label__0	In this way , under the influence of the air projected by the blowing-machine , the coal would be transformed into carbonic acid , then into oxide of carbon , its use being to reduce the oxide of iron , that is to say , to rid it of the oxygen .
__label__1	‘ Take ‘ em away , take ‘ em away to the Fondling ! ’ With these awful remarks , <NAME> sat himself down in a chair , and defied the nurse , who made the best of her way into the adjoining room , and returned with a stream of matrons : declaring that <NAME> had spoken blasphemy against his family , and must be raving mad .
__label__1	In her bower she was , but not alone , for besides the old lady her mother of whom mention has recently been made , there were present some half-dozen ladies of the neighborhood who had happened by a strange accident ( and also by a little understanding among themselves ) to drop in one after another , just about tea-time .
__label__0	<NAME> , ” answered <NAME> , with comic gravity , “ it appears that there is -- or rather formerly was -- a trunk of _ ‘ turuma , ’ _ which every year at the same time descended the <NAME> , stopping several days at <NAME> , and going on into <NAME> , halting at every port , where the natives ornamented it with little flags .
__label__0	“ This creek evidently runs to the sea .
__label__1	Quite correct , <NAME> dear ; but I didn ’ t see you do it , so I asked .
__label__1	It ’ s a wery strange thing now , where this here letter can ha ’ come from. ’ As <NAME> said this , he did what a great many people do when they are uncertain about the writer of a note -- looked at the seal , and then at the front , and then at the back , and then at the sides , and then at the superscription ; and , as a last resource , thought perhaps he might as well look at the inside , and try to find out from that .
__label__1	‘ Ask , you dog. ’ Not caring to venture within range of such missles again , the boy discreetly sent in his stead the first cause of the interruption , who now presented herself at the door .
__label__1	Because , as I say , it is not good for man to be alone. ’ <NAME> appears to commit this original idea to memory .
__label__1	That could hardly be , she knew , until an hour past midnight ; but in the country silence , which did anything but calm the trouble of her thoughts , time lagged wearily .
__label__0	`` It is more than useful , it is necessary !
__label__1	Mr <NAME> , with a sniff of corresponding intensity , then added , ‘ Anything more ? ’ ‘ Not at present , sir , not at present .
__label__0	answered <NAME> , without manifesting the slightest irritation .
__label__1	I am staying at the house of papa ’ s agent , <NAME> , in <NAME> , <NAME> .
__label__1	His anxiety , his eagerness , and affliction at this pass are pitiable to behold .
__label__0	The shells were a little open ; the <NAME> came near and put his dagger between to prevent them from closing ; then with his hand he raised the membrane with its fringed edges , which formed a cloak for the creature .
__label__1	She took the first opportunity of angrily ordering my father out of the house , in his presence , and my father has never seen her since. ” I thought of her having said , “ <NAME> will come and see me at last when I am laid dead upon that table ; ” and I asked <NAME> whether his father was so inveterate against her ?
__label__0	With such a weapon a marksman would find no difficulty in lodging a bullet in the eye of a chamois at the distance of two thousand paces .
__label__1	‘ Do you see where we are ? ’ ‘ Yes , my love .
__label__1	The waiter returned , and ushered three gentlemen into the room .
__label__0	At that moment I was leaning forward on the starboard netting .
__label__0	We are going to eat some meat ; and what meat ! ''
__label__0	Their shortest way was to cross the <NAME> on the ice , which then covered it .
__label__1	I forgive you ; but I am so grieved , <NAME> , that you should have such bad passions in your heart. ’ They had persuaded her that I was a wicked fellow , and she was more sorry for that than for my going away .
__label__1	Do you think it good ? -- Warn her father against me .
__label__1	<NAME> looked to such men as his good friend to do such things .
__label__1	And so , indeed , it proved , for the <NAME> gradually coming to herself ; and asking with wild emotion , ‘ <NAME> dear , are you safe ? ’ and further , ‘ George love , what has happened ?
__label__1	' I know he is , ' rejoined <NAME> .
__label__1	`` 'Presents her compliments to Mr .
__label__1	‘ Ay , ’ rejoined <NAME> , taking his arm .
__label__0	That gentleman took a carriage , and the party were soon landed on one of the quays .
__label__1	I am all right , ” said gruff Old Orlick .
__label__1	`` How de do , gentlemen , how de do !
__label__1	This the <NAME> , in a moment of uncommon conviviality , had confided to <NAME> and his Uncle , between the repetitions of lovely Peg , on the night when <NAME> the broker was paid out .
__label__0	Every one munched away at it with a pleasure which may be easily understood .
__label__1	I have been thinking , sir , for some time , that I was getting it , and now I have got it .
__label__0	Nor is it a piece of a shattered planet ! ''
__label__0	<NAME> hastened to join him in the shop , and received an affable `` Good-day . ''
__label__0	[ Illustration : Discovery of <NAME> . ]
__label__0	He was deadly pale ; his eyes stared , and his lips were painfully contracted .
__label__1	You don ’ t know him half as well as I do , <NAME> .
__label__1	If a man don ’ t wrap up , ’ said the Major , taking in another button of his buff waistcoat , ‘ he has nothing to fall back upon .
__label__0	On the 18th of October , 1771 , the <NAME> , commanded by <NAME> , and the <NAME> de <NAME> , under the <NAME> , midshipman , set sail .
__label__1	She stood still , and listened .
__label__1	so do I. I see it all afore me , upon my soul I do , <NAME> .
__label__0	`` I shall have been there three years , come <NAME> . ''
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> got it ? ” “ Yes , sir , ” said both the men together .
__label__0	“ Who ’ s there ? ” he cried , in no very amiable tone .
__label__1	I had had a moment 's time to think , since I had urged that duty on myself , and I was quite sure .
__label__1	It is my duty to attend to your interests with a cool head , and I can quite understand that to your excited feelings I may appear , at such times as the present , insensible .
__label__1	But the melted snow had found its way into the carriage , and I had got out two or three times when a fallen horse was plunging and had to be got up , and the wet had penetrated my dress .
__label__0	What a freak of nature , a bird 's beak on a mollusc !
__label__1	“ You are an aristocrat , and must have an escort -- and must pay for it. ” “ I have no choice , ” said <NAME> .
__label__1	put his horses into a canter and took us forward at such a rate , uphill though it was , that the wheels sent the road drift flying about our heads like spray from a water-mill .
__label__1	What discussion , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Shall I tell him , Mr Fledgeby ? ’ asked <NAME> .
__label__1	Thus for ten days <NAME> bent over his pillow , laying her cheek against his .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> was of her opinion .
__label__0	They thought of returning to <NAME> ; the sky had become perfectly clear , and while waiting for the moon to rise , the splendor of the stars was magnificent .
__label__1	When she , cast out of home , come here to me , and dropped upon them planks , her wownded heart was broke .
__label__1	`` None , little woman , that <NAME> would readily understand , '' said he .
__label__1	Nor can it have been the general expression of her face , which was very sparkling and pretty for an old lady .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , ’ said the lady , hurriedly , and looking into her face with great earnestness .
__label__1	He found a contest still always going on in his breast between his promise to keep <NAME> in none but good aspects before the mind of Mr Meagles , and his enforced observation of <NAME> in aspects that had no good in them .
__label__0	Neither the accustomed bleating of the sheep nor <NAME> 's voice could be heard .
__label__1	‘ Would you not like to be rich NOW , my darling ? ’ ‘ How can you ask me such a question , <NAME> dear ?
__label__0	But he did not know that part of this scene , although it passed so rapidly , had been observed by <NAME> , <NAME> ’ s spy .
__label__0	And if even it was brought to the surface , how would the travelers have borne the terrible shock which 20,000 feet of water had perhaps not sufficiently broken ?
__label__1	Without my knowing why , these tears allied themselves with the quietly sad smile which was so fixed in my remembrance , and shook me more with hope than fear or sorrow .
__label__1	But I must impose one or two conditions on you , before you enter my house in that capacity .
__label__1	And me bound , too , to a born devil that only wants the will , and has the power to , to -- ' Panting for breath , the old man stammered for a word ; and in that instant checked the torrent of his wrath , and changed his whole demeanour .
__label__0	This , however , was out of the question .
__label__1	Where the dexterity of the lawyers , eager to discover a flaw ?
__label__1	To set this point at rest , for once and for ever , we hasten to undeceive them , and stride to its commencement .
__label__1	<NAME> , rousing up the <NAME> betimes in the morning , proposed that they should carry thither such furniture out of the little parlour as would grace it best , so that Florence might take possession of it when she rose .
__label__0	In the east and west were two capes gently sloping to the water ; at their end the sea was breaking , and the wind was carrying a slight foam .
__label__0	I woke then , and every time in a very bad humour with <NAME> .
__label__1	She certainly held down her head , and examined the corner of a very smart little apron , with more closeness than there appeared any absolute occasion for .
__label__1	What do you mean , boy ? ’ ‘ I ’ ll explain to you , then , ’ said the gentleman , after another and a dismal pause , ‘ why you wouldn ’ t paper a room with representations of horses .
__label__1	You know , just accustom yourself to talk it over , with your tact and in your quiet way , with him and <NAME> , and see what you all make of it .
__label__1	‘ Rough , cold night , <NAME> , ’ replied the man ; ‘ and there ’ s a wind got up , that drifts it across the fields , in a thick white cloud. ’ ‘ What does <NAME> say ? ’ inquired the old lady .
__label__0	I did honour to the repast .
__label__1	‘ It is not anybody who has been here before , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ for he is tumbling up every stair .
__label__0	“ And my mission to <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> ‘ em to call again. ’ ‘ Oh , but please will you come and show the lodgings , ’ returned the girl ; ‘ It ’ s eighteen shillings a week and us finding plate and linen .
__label__0	The best thing to do now was to get to the <NAME> as quick as possible at the appointed rendezvous .
__label__1	However , he was resolved to stick to the <NAME> ; and so the work of form-filling , corresponding , minuting , memorandum-making , signing , counter-signing , counter-counter-signing , referring backwards and forwards , and referring sideways , crosswise , and zig-zag , recommenced .
__label__0	Their voyage was very quick ; the sea , which was always open , was easy sailing , and it seemed really easier to go away from the Pole than to approach it .
__label__1	‘ Tight-Jeff or Slack-Jeff , it don ’ t much signify : it ’ s only tight-rope and slack-rope .
__label__1	‘ Quite a young woman , ’ said <NAME> , musing .
__label__1	How many times I went up and down the street , and round the square -- painfully aware of being a much better answer to the old riddle than the original one -- before I could persuade myself to go up the steps and knock , is no matter now .
__label__1	Then , without a scrap of courage , but with a great deal of desperation , I went softly in and stood beside her , touching her with my finger .
__label__1	Away they dash and rattle through the streets ; and as they pass along , a thousand heads are turned to look at them , and a thousand sober moralists revenge themselves for not being married too , that morning , by reflecting that these people little think such happiness can ’ t last .
__label__0	As to the results of his expedition they were almost none as to discoveries , and the stones , which he had put on board in the midst of so many dangers , were valueless .
__label__1	It is to be regretted , I suppose , but it could not be helped . ''
__label__0	The breaking up of the frozen ocean was a magnificent spectacle , and “ the great voice of the sea , ” as the whalers graphically describe it , was heard in all its solemnity .
__label__1	I well remember mamma ’ s clasping her hands , and exclaiming “ This will end in a little man ! ” ’ ( Here Mr <NAME> glanced at his host and shook his head with despondency . )
__label__1	‘ Oh yes I have , I have my faults , no man knows his faults better than I know mine .
__label__0	Having to wait till noon to find his exact position , he ordered the steamer to take a short circular course of a few hours ' duration , in hope of sighting the buoy .
__label__0	Five hundred feet from the rocks the sea was boiling under the action of subterraneous fires .
__label__0	`` In the museum at <NAME> ? ''
__label__1	<NAME> and <NAME> was no more -- his children no more .
__label__1	`` My friends , '' says he , `` what is this which we now behold as being spread before us ?
__label__1	This is not your resolution ; call it up , <NAME> , call it up ! ''
__label__1	Well ; all sorts of humbugs profess morality .
__label__0	<NAME> and <NAME> even watched at the bridge so as to be ready to lower it the moment their companion presented himself .
__label__0	During this stay the map of this archipelago was rectified and an opportunity was taken to visit <NAME> , where the <NAME> excited as much curiosity as they felt themselves at the sight of the many things which were new to them .
__label__1	However , it has nothing to do with the present subject , excepting that <NAME> looked so like it at the moment that it came into my head . ''
__label__0	The mountainous and craggy islets intercepted the beauties of this noble island from the view of the travellers .
__label__1	`` I am sorry , '' says <NAME> , `` to have touched so sore a place . ''
__label__1	There was something positively awful to me in this , and in the brightness of her eyes , as she said , looking fixedly at me : ‘ What is he doing ? ’ I repeated the words , more to myself than her , being so amazed .
__label__1	<NAME> of us two can repeat most poetry ?
__label__1	Do not be afraid to imagine it , or to say what it would be. ’ He looked steadfastly at <NAME> , and , so looking at him , seemed to change into a very old haggard man .
__label__1	What I say is , I must come off clear and full or not at all .
__label__0	said my uncle , more exasperated than ever .
__label__1	) ; teeming ideas of <NAME> , as a place of past and present mystery , romance , abundance , want , beauty , ugliness , fair country gardens , and foul street gutters ; all confused together , -- made the room dimmer than it was in <NAME> Dorrit ’ s eyes , as they timidly saw it from the door .
__label__0	“ Well ! ” said the reporter , pressing the sailor ’ s hand .
__label__1	He still wore knee-breeches , and dark cotton stockings on his nether limbs ; but they were not _the_ breeches .
__label__1	To have , as I may say , all friends round <NAME> ’ s at once , is a treat unlooked for !
__label__0	`` Never mind , '' I continued , `` let us fill our goatskin and gourds , and then try to stop the opening up . ''
__label__1	He might have begun in secret to despair of ever winning that gentleman ’ s favour , and might have thought that he was now and then disposed to put a slight upon him , which was hardly just .
__label__0	But there was a much greater quantity of ice this year , and on the 17th of July , the expedition fell in with an `` icefield '' of such extent that it took thirteen days to coast along it .
__label__0	And did not that discovery lead to the happy result of providing work for a large population , and restoring them to ease and comfort ?
__label__1	But looking round at the door , and seeing this dejected figure , he turns back to it , touches it with a mild hand , says ‘ Good night ! ’ A sob is his only acknowledgment .
__label__1	But you show it. ’ ‘ Show what ?
__label__0	The corral is only a store-house to them , and not a definitive encampment . ''
__label__0	The tempest of snow continued till the next day .
__label__0	He rang for the landlord , and , on his appearance , said , fixing his clear eyes upon him , `` Is this rabbit , sir ? ''
__label__0	It was the hand of a woman or child , a <NAME> !
__label__0	<NAME> , go and cut some resinous branches. ” Neb and <NAME> ran to the edge of the lake , shaded with pines and other green trees , and soon returned with some branches , which they made into torches .
__label__1	He could think of her being there , without a lurking misgiving that it would have been better if she had not come .
__label__0	She is a famous craft , you see , and she behaved admirably during the squall which struck us on our return. ” “ Could she not float in the river ? ” “ No doubt , captain , she could ; but there is no shelter there , and in the east winds , I think that the ‘ Bonadventure ’ would suffer much from the surf. ” “ Well , where would you put her , <NAME> ? ” “ In <NAME> , ” replied the sailor .
__label__0	`` Why , Mr <NAME> , '' replied the sailor , `` they would only have to start in the night with a good breeze , and they would be out of sight of the island in two hours . ''
__label__0	Arrived in harbour , after a prosperous voyage , <NAME> , to his no small surprise , found himself at first received with much respect , the governor <NAME> , as a shrewd man not willing to go against public opinion , doing him honour .
__label__0	People were restless who were never known to be restless before .
__label__1	Similarly , during two or three hours of drawl , and the winnowing of many bushels of words , <NAME> 's frequent expressions of impatience were taken up , with marvellous quickness , at a distance : the more readily , because certain men who had by some wonderful exercise of agility climbed up the external architecture to look in from the windows , knew <NAME> well , and acted as a telegraph between her and the crowd outside the building .
__label__1	If I got a little pair of shoes by any chance , she would take ’ em off and sell ’ em for drink .
__label__0	`` Then , M. Aronnax , I propose a curious excursion . ''
__label__0	`` Besides , if our guesses are right , '' said <NAME> , `` it must be said that we start with a fair chance of success .
__label__0	<NAME> would not as yet accuse him of anything , unless it was that he kept near <NAME> too constantly , but he did not let him out of his sight .
__label__0	At ten the moon will not be risen .
__label__0	<NAME> yourself caught on a narrow railroad bridge at midnight with an express train approaching at full speed , its reflector already dazzling you with its light , the roar of the cars rattling in your ears , and you may conceive the feelings of the travellers .
__label__0	It is evident that the ex-Viceroy had again become the hardy navigator of his earlier years .
__label__0	Both of them were about forty years of age ; both of them were tall and fair , with bushy whiskers and mustaches ; both of them were phlegmatic in temperament , and both much addicted to the wearing of their uniforms .
__label__1	And she has acted up to it glorious ! ''
__label__0	The tops of some baobabs , mimosas , and date-trees peeped up between the houses ; and , even at night , the activity of the place seemed very great .
__label__0	“ No paper , no paper ! ” exclaimed <NAME> .
__label__1	Then she glanced in a casual manner round the wine-shop , took up her knitting with great apparent calmness and repose of spirit , and became absorbed in it .
__label__1	‘ But we are always glad to come home , father ; now , are we not ?
__label__0	He gave them great hope ; indeed , the young girl could not help smiling at his sanguine prediction of success , and this odd way of foreseeing future events .
__label__1	‘ Perhaps you may not be aware , sir , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ that I intruded upon him when he was over here in <NAME> .
__label__1	He 'll be here soon enough for us all . '
__label__1	Nor are they desirous to prolong their visit , packing the few movables with all possible speed and never speaking above a whisper .
__label__0	My head was now wholly lost .
__label__1	We found my aunt alone , in a state of some excitement .
__label__1	asked <NAME> of the gentleman whom we had found in attendance on her .
__label__0	Still , they must be pardoned , both who were treacherous , and those who were led away to it !
__label__1	He carried so very attentive an expression on his countenance that it appeared as if the confidential discourse of the big stick required to be followed closely .
__label__1	According to the arrangement , the parties had six pistols each , which , after the word “ Fire ! ” _they were to discharge as fast as they pleased_ .
__label__0	All these wild stories were turned by him into songs , which earned him great applause in the winter evenings .
__label__0	The right bank of the river still continued to be the margin of the land , and only in one spot had its integrity been impaired .
__label__1	I turn my head , and see it , in its beautiful serenity , beside me .
__label__1	‘ Wicked one ! ’ ‘ You have been here before , if I am not mistaken ? ’ said Mr Dombey .
__label__1	I look upon you , sir , as a man who has placed himself beyond the pale of society , by his most audacious , disgraceful , and abominable public conduct .
__label__1	‘ And that is just what I mean ; that is just how it was with us , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	Having made up his mind on this important point , he circulated the glass ( from his right hand to left , and back again ) pretty freely , to enable him to act his part with the greater discretion , and then , after making some slight improvements in his toilet , bent his steps towards the spot hallowed by the fair object of his meditations .
__label__1	I had alighted from <NAME> 's back on the brink of the ditch when we came up , and had not moved since .
__label__0	These three men had been hurled overboard by a collision which had taken place between the “ Nautilus ” and the <NAME> frigate “ <NAME> , ” which had chased her .
__label__1	At the same time there came from a workshop across a little yard outside the window , a regular sound of hammering that kept a kind of tune : RAT -- tat-tat , <NAME> -- tat-tat , <NAME> -- tat-tat , without any variation .
__label__0	The <NAME> of the <NAME> XXII .
__label__1	I have had enough of that , and I ai n't going to have any more .
__label__1	“ Do n't you expect to see him ? ” said I .
__label__0	It shifted abruptly from south to north , but finally the <NAME> was carried away by it toward the west .
__label__0	The colonists , warned by the engineer , left their work and gazed in silence at the summit of <NAME> .
__label__1	The whole party arrived in safety at the Bush before <NAME> had recovered his breath .
__label__0	Standing there , with his arms stretched out like an exerciser , he made some grimaces , whose meaning was obvious to the prisoners .
__label__0	During the first days of June , <NAME> was obliged to stop to repair the ships , of which the keels were much damaged by the shallow water on the coast .
__label__0	Before we took our final departure from the island , however , I made some observations to calculate the distance we had gone over , and I put them down in my journal .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> is the type and model of a young drummer .
__label__1	The pleasantest part of the occasion by far , to <NAME> , was the painfullest .
__label__1	`` I am not the messenger , if you please , miss , '' returned my little maid .
__label__0	It is impossible to describe it .
__label__1	Let this intercede for me .
__label__1	The dwarf ’ s lodging on <NAME> hill comprised , besides the needful accommodation for himself and <NAME> , a small sleeping-closet for that lady ’ s mother , who resided with the couple and waged perpetual war with <NAME> ; of whom , notwithstanding , she stood in no slight dread .
__label__1	Really when he used to come in of an evening , and ask <NAME> in his meek voice how she was , and then sit down with his head against the wall , and make no attempt to say anything more , I liked him very much .
__label__1	It rather put me out at first this morning to see you and <NAME> looking so neat and pretty and to feel ashamed of <NAME> and myself too , but on the whole I hope I am better-tempered than I was and more forgiving to <NAME> . ''
__label__1	‘ I ’ m glad to hear it .
__label__0	Would they not , on the contrary , by employing the cart leave every arm free ?
__label__0	“ <NAME> , stand up. ” As <NAME> was already standing , he could not get any higher , but he waited modestly for the geographer ’ s questions .
__label__0	It was now confessedly the privilege and the right of these men to set limits to that selenographic science which had till now been making itself so very busy in reconstructing the lunar world .
__label__1	Little <NAME> , with a piercing cry , held her back .
__label__1	Having held the first bottle up to the light , and shaken it well to test its excellence , <NAME> placed them both on top of a chest of drawers ; folded the handkerchief in which they had been wrapped ; put it carefully in his pocket ; and took up his hat , as if to go .
__label__1	The commissary having been buried with all the decorations suitable to the service ( the whole team of proprieties were harnessed to his hearse , and they all had feathers and black velvet housings with his coat of arms in the corner ) , <NAME> began to inquire what quantity of dust and ashes was deposited at the bankers ’ .
__label__0	He resolved therefore to set to work without delay .
__label__0	`` <NAME> said , my boy -- very well said ; it is indeed a mighty hothouse .
__label__0	We must be particularly careful to guard against a rush of blood to the head . ''
__label__1	If you have nothing better to do than to walk up town with me , I shall be glad to introduce you to <NAME> ’ s daughter. ’ ‘ Mr .
__label__0	In 1855 , Brun-Rollet , a native of <NAME> , appointed consul for <NAME> in <NAME> , to take the place of <NAME> , who had just died , set out from <NAME> , and , under the name of Yacoub the merchant , trading in gums and ivory , got as far as <NAME> , beyond the fourth degree , but had to return in ill-health to <NAME> , where he died in 1857 .
__label__0	for eleven years , the survivors of the <NAME> schooner had been cast away there without any hope of succour .
__label__1	And <NAME> , who of course saw through her own threadbare blind perfectly , and who knew that <NAME> saw through it perfectly , and who knew that <NAME> would see through it perfectly , came out of this form , notwithstanding , as she had gone into it , with immense complacency and gravity .
__label__0	The sea remained fast ; still a few traces of seals announced the beginning of their visit , and that they were already come to breathe at the surface of the ice-field .
__label__0	`` I 'll tell you if I feel like it , '' cried <NAME> , folding his arms with an aspect of great dignity ; `` and I 'll not tell you if I do n't feel like it ! ''
__label__1	The <NAME> looked at her wistfully , and repeated ‘ No , ’ -- still lingering , and still showing embarrassment .
__label__1	' I despise 'em , ' said the beadle , growing very red in the face .
__label__0	The group , lying between 50 degrees 57 minutes , and 52 degrees 45 minutes S. latitude , and 60 degrees 4 minutes , 63 degrees 48 minutes west of the meridian of <NAME> , consists of several islets and two principal islands , named <NAME> and <NAME> .
__label__0	`` Well , a perfect vacuum as far as air is concerned . ''
__label__1	Mrs Clennam still sat intent .
__label__0	He had to wait for his turn .
__label__1	It is a bare office , with bare windows , looking on the iron view below .
__label__1	I can ’ t , ’ replied the girl ; ‘ <NAME> raked out the kitchen fire afore she went to bed , and locked up the kittle. ’ ‘ Oh , never mind ; never mind .
__label__0	The eastern coast of <NAME> advances perpendicularly northward .
__label__1	And , my good fellow , if you will open your bedevilments to me when they come thick upon you , I may show you better ways out of them than you can find for yourself. ’ ‘ Thank you , ’ said <NAME> , shaking his head dismally , and chewing rosebuds .
__label__1	At what an opportune moment they arrived , how they listened , and what they heard , is already known to the reader .
__label__1	He nodded , twice or thrice , to a passing friend ; and , resisting as many invitations to take a morning dram , pressed steadily onward , until they were clear of the turmoil , and had made their way through <NAME> into <NAME> .
__label__1	His voice , short , deep , and resonant , is not at all unlike the tones of the instrument to which he is devoted .
__label__1	In the heavy air of the room , and the heavy darkness that brooded in its remoter corners , I even had an alarming fancy that <NAME> and I might presently begin to decay .
__label__0	In <NAME> , after crossing <NAME> , between <NAME> and <NAME> , two of the <NAME> , <NAME> surveyed the eastern coast of <NAME> , in the neighbourhood of <NAME> , which presented a very picturesque appearance , with the hills clothed with grass and stunted trees and the shores with bushes .
__label__1	You came into this world with the same dispositions , and you passed your younger days together surrounded by the same adverse circumstances .
__label__1	But there ’ s no harm in my trying. ’ His breath fell like a flame of fire on <NAME> ’ s ear , it was so hot .
__label__0	On that account <NAME> hastened to <NAME> , and had some enormous grappling-irons fixed on an automatic system , which would never let the projectile go if it once succeeded in seizing it in its powerful claws .
__label__1	However , when we began to jolt upon a stone pavement , and particularly when every other conveyance seemed to be running into us , and we seemed to be running into every other conveyance , I began to believe that we really were approaching the end of our journey .
__label__0	The events which had happened during the last few days -- the struggle between <NAME> and <NAME> ; the search for the corpse , which had reappeared under such extraordinary circumstances ; the finding of the “ indecipherable ” document , if we can so call it ; the information it concealed , the assurance that it contained , or rather the wish that it contained , the material proof of the guiltlessness of <NAME> ; and the hope that it was written by the real culprit -- all these things had contributed to work the change in public opinion .
__label__1	But the small servant immediately pausing in her talk , he subsided again , and pleading a momentary forgetfulness of their compact , entreated her to proceed .
__label__1	And when I got downstairs , oh , how I cried !
__label__1	‘ It ‘ ull hold him easy , vith his hat and shoes on , and breathe through the legs , vich his holler .
__label__0	'Well , then , give me some rum . ' ''
__label__0	“ Am I right ? ” “ You are quite right , <NAME> , ” answered <NAME> ; “ and when we have reached <NAME> , we shall be at the foot of the <NAME> on the opposite side. ” “ How long will it take to get across the mountains ? ” “ Forty-eight hours , for we shall travel day and night .
__label__1	<NAME> is a little dim , but she is of the true descent ; and there are many who appreciate her sprightly conversation , her <NAME> conundrums so old as to have become in the cycles of time almost new again , the honour of taking the fair Dedlock in to dinner , or even the privilege of her hand in the dance .
__label__0	The most simple preparations for the great experiment , the questions of figures which it involved , the mechanical difficulties to be resolved -- in one word , the entire plan of work -- roused the popular excitement to the highest pitch .
__label__1	‘ He isn ’ t , ’ said <NAME> indignantly .
__label__0	In ten minutes we shall have her full of hot air. ” “ Here it is , doctor ! ” The <NAME> was now two-thirds inflated .
__label__1	But we preserved an unbroken silence .
__label__1	The board across the doorway too , acting as a trap equally for the feet of Mrs Higden coming out , and the feet of Mrs Boffin and <NAME> going in , greatly increased the difficulty of the situation : to which the cries of the orphan imparted a lugubrious and inhuman character .
__label__1	Nor were the two last-named gentlemen as much edified as they might have been by the moving passages narrated .
__label__0	<NAME> ran distracted through the passages , calling her companion , and asking to be taken to the <NAME> .
__label__1	In the entry hung his rusty large-brimmed low-crowned hat , as long out of date as his coat ; in the corner near it stood his staff -- no walking-stick but a veritable staff .
__label__0	`` No , '' answered <NAME> , leaning over the railing .
__label__1	She said she had tried to exert herself , and so , I have no doubt , she had .
__label__0	Towards seven o ’ clock in the morning , the “ Bonadventure , ” weathering the <NAME> , entered the strait and glided on to the waters , so strangely enclosed in the frame of lava .
__label__1	It ’ s mine , ’ retorted <NAME> .
__label__0	“ What means all this ? ” he murmured .
__label__1	‘ I believe every word you have said , ’ he returned .
__label__1	Though there <NAME> unintentionally threw him out by faltering , ‘ Oh , is it indeed ?
__label__0	But will it do you any good to devour it with your eyes ?
__label__0	“ Was it the devil who rang it ? ” No one answered .
__label__0	While looking , I saw two eagles circling about the summit of a lofty tower .
__label__1	The prisoner sprang up with a reproachful look , but <NAME> 's hand was close and firm at his nostrils , and <NAME> 's left arm caught him round the waist .
__label__1	‘ At about eight , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	Now I know he knows where she is gone. ’ ‘ Can not undertake to say , sir , I am sure ! ’ <NAME> again rejoined .
__label__1	<NAME> or no husband , that fellow is incapable of the feeling with which I am inspired towards the beautiful young creature whom he treats like a doll .
__label__1	`` If you wo n't let me speak -- '' `` You 're speaking now .
__label__1	I deigned to make him no reply ; and , taking up my hat , was going out to bed , when he came between me and the door .
__label__1	‘ Exactly so , <NAME> , ’ said Mr Toots , whose fervour of acquiescence was greatly heightened by his entire ignorance of the <NAME> ’ s meaning .
__label__1	It so fell out , that Mrs. Squeers ’ s journey , to some distance , to fetch three new boys , and dun the relations of two old ones for the balance of a small account , was fixed that very afternoon , for the next day but one ; and on the next day but one , Mrs. Squeers got up outside the coach , as it stopped to change at <NAME> , taking with her a small bundle containing something in a bottle , and some sandwiches , and carrying besides a large white top-coat to wear in the night-time ; with which baggage she went her way .
__label__1	He tried to shut it out , but it would stream in .
__label__0	This seemed a proper place for a solid building , and it could be easily fortified ; nature had adapted it for the purpose ; it was only necessary to make use of the place .
__label__0	Seated gloomily on the raft , clasping the stump of the mast mechanically , I thought of all I had read as to sufferings from starvation .
__label__1	However , I told him I was T. Copperfield , <NAME> , and he believed it , and gave me the letter , which he said required an answer .
__label__1	There was the widow before him , bouncing bodily here and there , with unwonted vigour ; and <NAME> hopping about , with a face expressive of the most intense solemnity , dancing ( as a good many people do ) as if a quadrille were not a thing to be laughed at , but a severe trial to the feelings , which it requires inflexible resolution to encounter .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> was extremely glad to see me , but a little confused too .
__label__0	THE <NAME> DAVIS STRAIT .
__label__0	“ Is it so ? ” he said roughly .
__label__0	The old trunks were divested of their clothing of creepers , cacti , ferns , mosses , and bromelias .
__label__0	`` And he came back alone -- alone -- from that voyage , having left <NAME> . ''
__label__1	`` I am quite indebted to you for the trouble you have taken already . ''
__label__0	Before commencing his recital , he told <NAME> about the escape of the convicts at <NAME> , and their appearance in <NAME> ; as also their complicity in the railway catastrophe .
__label__0	It floated on the stream of hot lava , amidst a falling cloud of cinders .
__label__1	But you ’ ll excuse me if I say , sir , that there are neither slaves nor slave-drivers in this country , and that people are not allowed to take the law into their own hands .
__label__0	How much blood had it not cost ?
__label__1	For it 's quite impossible that I can put my papers away . ''
__label__0	They appeared to talk in several distinct dialects , which differ remarkably from <NAME> or <NAME> .
__label__0	Although it was apparently much nearer to <NAME> than the moon to the earth , its superficies was hardly one-tenth as large , and so feebly did it reflect the light of the remote sun , that it scarcely emitted radiance enough to extinguish the dim luster of stars of the eighth magnitude .
__label__1	Some of the people of the chateau , and some of those of the posting-house , and all the taxing authorities , were armed more or less , and were crowded on the other side of the little street in a purposeless way , that was highly fraught with nothing .
__label__0	The serpent , who fled from them with great swiftness , carried his head out of the water , and one of them attempted to seize his tail .
__label__1	‘ Well , sir , her cousin -- you know it ’ s a cousin she ’ s going to be married to ? ’ ‘ Oh yes , ’ I replied .
__label__0	The hunters took the route by the sea and went forward rapidly .
__label__1	<NAME> electors of the borough of <NAME> .
__label__0	The doctor , by means of a temperature increased to one hundred and eighty degrees , gave the balloon a fresh ascensional force of nearly sixteen hundred pounds , and it went up to an elevation of more than eight thousand feet , the greatest height attained during the journey .
__label__0	`` Yes , joker , '' said <NAME> .
__label__0	Our knowledge of it is due chiefly to <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> and <NAME> .
__label__0	I am lost ! ” he would cry , as he ran from side to side .
__label__1	Being what it is , she neither knows nor cares . ''
__label__0	A great part of the copper sheathing had been torn from the hull , which every day sank lower .
__label__1	( In this he was very warmly supported by Mr and <NAME> . )
__label__1	‘ Upon my word , my dear , when there are so many pleasanter things to think of , I should be a goose if I did , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	Some well-intentioned , but rather obstinate persons , could not at first comprehend how , if the moon displays invariably the same face to the earth during her revolution , she can describe one turn round herself .
__label__1	The well-known shops , however , with their cheerful lights , did something for me ; and when I alighted at the door of the <NAME> ’ s <NAME> , I had recovered my spirits .
__label__0	“ We will not ask more from it , ” replied the sailor .
__label__1	'And I for his falsehood with my head ! '
__label__0	Notwithstanding this , the examination is carried out , the vein discovered .
__label__1	I understand your allusion , my love .
__label__1	She faintly shook her head upon the pillow , and kept her secret , as the boy had done .
__label__0	The islets surrounding this coast were reconnoitred by the navigators .
__label__1	‘ An escapade of a week or so. ’ ‘ And how are they all ?
__label__1	The apothecary 's apprentice , having completed the manufacture of the toothpick , planted himself in front of the fire and made good use of it for ten minutes or so : when apparently growing rather dull , he wished Mrs. Corney joy of her job , and took himself off on tiptoe .
__label__0	the giant is playing at cup and ball ; he is a conjurer. ” In fact , the substances thrown up fell back again in to the abyss , and it did not seem that the lava , though swollen by the internal pressure , had yet risen to the orifice of the crater .
__label__1	So stimulated , the business was extremely brisk , and the articles in stock went off with the greatest celerity .
__label__0	Could it be possible that the secretary of the <NAME> had made a mistake ?
__label__1	That <NAME> bottle was found by my noble benefactor and yours , after he entered on possession of the estate .
__label__1	‘ I fear there is something more , ’ stammered <NAME> with a half-smile , and looking towards <NAME> , ‘ it is a most awkward thing to say -- but -- the very mention of such a supposition makes one look like a puppy -- still -- may I ask if that lady supposes that I entertain any -- in short , does she think that I am in love with her ? ’ ‘ <NAME> embarrassment , ’ thought <NAME> , ‘ I have brought him to it , at last .
__label__0	`` A greater reason for making their acquaintance , '' said <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Do you pretend to believe , ’ Mrs Lammle resumes , sternly , ‘ when you talk of my marrying you for worldly advantages , that it was within the bounds of reasonable probability that I would have married you for yourself ? ’ ‘ Again there are two sides to the question , <NAME> .
__label__1	Still , there was no abatement in the storm , but it blew harder .
__label__0	The traditional soup of fragrant herbs ; cake , so often made to replace bread in <NAME> , composed of the flour of the manioc thoroughly impregnated with the gravy of meat and tomato jelly ; poultry with rice , swimming in a sharp sauce made of vinegar and _ “ malagueta ; ” _ a dish of spiced herbs , and cold cake sprinkled with cinnamon , formed enough to tempt a poor monk reduced to the ordinary meager fare of his parish .
__label__1	When <NAME> had finished his breakfast , he went out for a stroll on the beach .
__label__1	It is lowly , but airy , open at the back , and considered one of the 'ealthiest outlets .
__label__1	Has several marks of LASHING , and has irons on her feet. ’ ‘ Ran away , a negro woman and two children .
__label__1	When they arrived there , <NAME> left <NAME> in the coach , under pretence of preparing the old gentleman to receive him ; and sending up her card by the servant , requested to see <NAME> on very pressing business .
__label__1	<NAME> ’ t be cast down. ’ The face looked up at him imploringly , as he rose from wiping it , and gently replaced the coat that covered the writhing figure .
__label__1	‘ Good night , sir , good night , ’ cried the lawyer , retreating backwards towards the door .
__label__0	Some of these trees lay on the ground , and they had only to be barked , which was the most difficult thing of all , owing to the imperfect tools which the settlers possessed .
__label__1	‘ Neighbour ! ’ said the old man , stopping at the cottage where his young guide ’ s mother dwelt , ‘ how is it that the folks are nearly all in black to-day ?
__label__0	exclaimed the president of the <NAME> , with an immense sigh of relief .
__label__1	<NAME> will see to your accommodation .
__label__0	But before they sat down to table , the doctor said in a voice of triumph , as he pointed to his two companions , -- `` <NAME> , I carried away with me an Englishman and an <NAME> , did I not ? ''
__label__0	Since I had known him , never had he been so amiable and pleasant .
__label__1	‘ Show the gentlemen into the parlour , <NAME> , ’ said the landlady .
__label__0	The road was as deserted as all that part of the <NAME> which lay between the <NAME> and the lake .
__label__1	Ten thousand pounds could not effect it. ’ ‘ Sissy has effected it , father. ’ He raised his eyes to where she stood , like a good fairy in his house , and said in a tone of softened gratitude and grateful kindness , ‘ It is always you , my child ! ’ ‘ We had our fears , ’ <NAME> explained , glancing at <NAME> , ‘ before yesterday ; and when I saw you brought to the side of the litter last night , and heard what passed ( being close to <NAME> all the time ) , I went to him when no one saw , and said to him , “ <NAME> ’ t look at me .
__label__0	I made as little use of it as possible , trusting to my own agility and doing miracles in the way of feats of dexterity and strength upon the projecting shelves and spurs of lava which my feet seemed to clutch as strongly as my hands .
__label__1	His sister gently touched him on the shoulder , and pointed to it .
__label__0	I therefore think you have reason to hope still. ” The young squatter ’ s words caused great joy to his auditors .
__label__1	I was never unmindful of <NAME> , and she never left that sanctuary in my thoughts -- if I may call it so -- where I had placed her from the first .
__label__0	This colossal boundary then stretched away for nearly 150 leagues over the <NAME> desert , and , extending to the south of <NAME> , occupied what , if <NAME> had still existed , would have been its natural frontier .
__label__1	‘ When are you at home ? ’ ‘ When you like. ’ ‘ Breakfast-time ? ’ said <NAME> , in her abruptest and shortest manner .
__label__1	I freely admit , I am a woman of business .
__label__1	You are not to pocket other people 's pounds , shillings , and pence and escape scot-free . ''
__label__0	By a supreme instinct of self-preservation <NAME> uttered a cry .
__label__1	It was a curious place : a large wall , with a gate in the middle , and a gas-light burning inside .
__label__1	We agreed that he was either prevented from coming or that he had come and gone away , and <NAME> proposed to walk home with me .
__label__1	This is not to be received as a figure of speech .
__label__0	In a word , they were little better than prisoners .
__label__0	Hence this immense river system is under the same climatic conditions during the whole of its course .
__label__1	‘ Are they well ? ’ he asked .
__label__1	‘ How can I feel otherwise than flattered by your notice in any way ? ’ ‘ Oh !
__label__0	`` Still burning , and has been for the last three weeks . ''
__label__1	'Will she be buried to-morrow , or next day , or to-night ?
__label__1	<NAME> and her baby sister were so exactly alike , and so completely one , that in our thoughts we have never been able to separate them since .
__label__1	Its gentle touch , though it had been light and instantaneous , appeared still present to the old man 's sense of feeling .
__label__0	He was a tall , vigorous , broad-shouldered , deep-chested man .
__label__1	What a state of mind I was in !
__label__1	An errand of generosity brought him here unknown to us ; he was stopped at the barrier , and sent to prison. ” The old man uttered an irrepressible cry .
__label__0	<NAME> turned his stay at <NAME> to account by studying the light of the stars of the southern hemisphere , for he had noticed that several , notably the <NAME> , the <NAME> of the <NAME> , and others , seemed to have changed since the time of <NAME> .
__label__0	The reef against which the corvette had run , was , therefore , not so wide as the vessel itself ; in fact , it was but the pointed summit of a rock .
__label__1	This made me , I dare say , more timid and retiring than I naturally was and cast me upon Dolly as the only friend with whom I felt at ease .
__label__0	The mill and the poultry-yard particularly suffered .
__label__0	“ <NAME> , who accompanies me , ” continued the count , “ has been most severely tried by the disaster .
__label__0	This population , however , fluctuates very much according to the season .
__label__1	Mr <NAME> sat on a stool with a foot on the rail of another stool , and his hat on .
__label__1	Upon that there stool , at that there <NAME> , sets that there boy of mine , brought up and growed up to be a man , wot will errand you , message you , general-light-job you , till your heels is where your head is , if such should be your wishes .
__label__1	If he lives till it turns , he ’ ll hold his own till past the flood , and go out with the next tide. ’ We remained there , watching him , a long time -- hours .
__label__0	The chief of police appeared on the threshold .
__label__1	I am a widower with three daughters -- <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> -- and my desire is so to discharge the duties of life as to leave them a good name .
__label__1	`` He never finishes what he begins to say !
__label__1	They had had no respect for the old room high up , where the little bed had been ; he could hardly find a clear space there , to throw himself down , on the floor , against the wall , poor broken man , and let his tears flow as they would .
__label__1	<NAME> water is in general request at the office next day , and most of the party deem the bill an imposition .
__label__1	‘ I wish it would kill something of its own accord. ’ ‘ It ’ ll do that afore long , <NAME> , ’ observed the tall man , in a low , prophetic voice .
__label__1	On his way down , he overtook , in one of the passages , a stranger genteelly dressed in black , who was also moving towards the dining-room .
__label__1	The dwarf ’ s humour , as we know , was to have a fireside to himself ; and when he was disposed to be convivial , to enjoy himself alone .
__label__1	Like the <NAME> of questionable jollity in the song , They cared for <NAME> , no not they , and <NAME> cared for them .
__label__1	Over and above this , <NAME> was very anxious `` to learn housekeeping , '' as she said .
__label__0	The prison was an old missionary convent , situated on the bank of one of the principal iguarapes of the town .
__label__0	But though she may be brave -- and she certainly is so -- her strength must fail her , and , to say nothing of dangers and obstacles , she will be unable to endure the fatigue of such a journey .
__label__0	The last luggage-van has been robbed .
__label__0	`` Well , <NAME> , fortune was against us yesterday . ''
__label__0	All this was a gratuitous gift to the king from his subjects .
__label__0	`` <NAME> , <NAME> , '' replied the <NAME> ; `` <NAME> has a trick of knocking the bottom out of every weaker vessel .
__label__1	that ’ s all , is it ? ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	I tried this , I tried that , I tried t ’ other .
__label__0	It was only natural under these circumstances that the population rapidly decreased , and the day was not far off when it would be wholly exterminated .
__label__0	When <NAME> set out to discover <NAME> , he ascended more to the eastward in a straight line above Kazeh. ” “ Shall we keep on long in this way ? ” inquired the <NAME> .
__label__1	We meet with it in a chin , and we say , “ There it is !
__label__1	“ At any rate , ” said I , “ I have no warning given me just now , for you wrote to me to come to you , this time. ” “ That 's true , ” said <NAME> , with a cold careless smile that always chilled me .
__label__1	If I felt at all confused at that early time in endeavouring to reconcile anything he said with anything I had thought about the duties and accountabilities of life ( which I am far from sure of ) , I was confused by not exactly understanding why he was free of them .

__label__1	Are you sure that it would not be better to try that course ?
__label__0	On this he halted , faltered , his knees bent under him , and he uncovered his whole flank to the assaults of his enemies in the balloon .
__label__1	But she was too high !
__label__0	A rugged cavern of small extent appeared to offer a halting place to our weary bodies .
__label__1	‘ Immediately I see that Innocent in the <NAME> , <NAME> , I burst out laughing first , and then I choked. ’ <NAME> involuntarily proceeded to do the like again on the spot .
__label__0	Two large pirogues , each manned by thirty paddlers , showed an intention of attacking the vessels , but the latter immediately chased them .
__label__0	At midnight the steppe was profoundly dark .
__label__0	It is a sieve , whose interstices furnish a passage for the earth ’ s vapors in the shape of boiling geysers and solfataras .
__label__1	'It 's a cold ride from <NAME> , ma'am ; and I always find that spirits comes home warmer to the feelings . '
__label__1	Get along with you , my woman , ’ he added in her ear , ‘ get along with you , while you know you ’ re Affery , and before you ’ re shaken to yeast. ’ Mistress Affery , sensible of the danger in which her identity stood , relinquished the tea-pot as her husband seized it , put her apron over her head , and in a twinkling vanished .
__label__0	His father propped himself up against the rock .
__label__1	`` Have you no wish in reference to your case ? ''
__label__0	There will be dancing and singing. ” “ Thank you , <NAME> , but it ’ s impossible. ” “ Impossible ? ” “ Yes ; <NAME> ’ s visit will last some time , and I must take him back to Callander. ” “ Well , <NAME> , it won ’ t be for a week yet .
__label__0	They noted the direction , outlet and inclination of the paths .
__label__0	Fearing that some accident might have befallen his lieutenant , he had descended the course of the river for 150 miles , until he met with an unfortunate officer , who had been left behind for having addressed some remonstrances to his chief upon his perfidy .
__label__0	He handled him with the most exquisite delicacy , and his treatment so revived the lad ’ s strength , that it was soon evident that a few hours ’ rest would set him all right .
__label__0	“ It is a fortunate circumstance , ” responded the <NAME> .
__label__0	That thick , dismal savage blackness , which <NAME> 's pen is so fond of occasionally revelling in , surrounded them on all sides and crushed them like an iron shroud .
__label__0	<NAME> was surrounded by a detachment of <NAME> soldiers , made prisoner with all his men , and taken to <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> seemed to be vanquished by <NAME> 's coolness , for he quietly followed him , and they sat down aside from the rest of the passengers .
__label__1	“ Well to be sure ! ” said <NAME> , astounded .
__label__1	I am sure it must be <NAME> ’ s doing. ’ The arm <NAME> had begun to twine around her neck , unbent itself .
__label__1	That is to say , you will now take your money affairs entirely into your own hands , and you will draw from <NAME> one hundred and twenty-five pounds per quarter , until you are in communication with the fountain-head , and no longer with the mere agent .
__label__1	And when <NAME> saw the kindled eyes , the resolute face , the calm strong look and bearing of the man whose life always seemed to him to have been stopped , like a clock , for so many years , and then set going again with an energy which had lain dormant during the cessation of its usefulness , he believed .
__label__1	‘ I shall do very well , I thank you. ’ Mrs. Crupp , who had been incessantly smiling to express sweet temper , and incessantly holding her head on one side , to express a general feebleness of constitution , and incessantly rubbing her hands , to express a desire to be of service to all deserving objects , gradually smiled herself , one-sided herself , and rubbed herself , out of the room .
__label__1	‘ I excessively regret poor Gay , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ and the crew .
__label__1	`` I wish <NAME> was dead ! ''
__label__0	His companions uttered a shout .
__label__0	“ Yes , I would. ” “ Well , you would have done wrong in a zoological point of view , ” returned <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> mind. ’ ‘ But I DO mind , ’ said the <NAME> , laying her fan upon his lips .
__label__0	But certain local causes may considerably modify this figure .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> turned towards his crew , who surrounded him , both the old and the new .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> ’ said <NAME> ; and down they sat .
__label__1	What I was thinking of was this .
__label__0	These incidents are , so to speak , supernatural -- ” “ Supernatural ! ” exclaimed the sailor , emitting a volume of smoke from his mouth .
__label__0	A thick dark bar of cloud was rising higher and higher , and by degrees extinguishing the stars .
__label__1	Many years ago , it had had it in its mind to slide down sideways ; it had been propped up , however , and was leaning on some half-dozen gigantic crutches : which gymnasium for the neighbouring cats , weather-stained , smoke-blackened , and overgrown with weeds , appeared in these latter days to be no very sure reliance .
__label__1	‘ I haven ’ t nerve to play even if I could .
__label__1	‘ You can ’ t be trusted for a moment .
__label__1	No , that she won ’ t , but you little think why , <NAME> boy ! ’ While Mrs. Sliderskew , influenced possibly by some lingering feelings of disappointment and personal slight , occasioned by her old master ’ s preference for another , was giving loose to these grumblings below stairs , <NAME> was cogitating in the parlour upon what had taken place last night .
__label__0	There were the gigantic _ “ pria-rucus , ” _ ten and twelve feet long , cuirassed with large scales with scarlet borders , whose flesh was not much appreciated by the natives .
__label__1	He frequently glanced at his face as if there were something in it that gave him pain , and more than once he looked towards me as though he sought to ascertain whether I knew what the truth was .
__label__1	There ’ s no love lost between us , I assure you , ’ said <NAME> , tying her bonnet strings with a jerk .
__label__1	So that whether twenty <NAME> made a <NAME> , or hic haec hoc was troy weight , or a verb always agreed with an ancient <NAME> , or three times four was <NAME> a bull , were open questions with him .
__label__0	It is so indented with bays , that in several places , where they are on opposite sides , they are so deep as to make the distance from one side to the other very small .
__label__1	'What 's the matter with the -- eh ? -- Why -- Brittles -- look here -- do n't you know ? '
__label__1	‘ This proceeding is more absurd than the other. ’ ‘ I think it would be best to take it in , ’ replied <NAME> ; ‘ it would serve him right to take it in and keep it , wouldn ’ t it ? ’ ‘ It would , ’ said <NAME> ; ‘ shall I ? ’ ‘ I think it the most proper course we could possibly adopt , ’ replied <NAME> .
__label__1	He kept his eyes upon her , and kept advancing ; and she , completely under his influence , kept retiring before him .
__label__1	‘ I admire it greatly , sir , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	He had driven his mistress to her old house in <NAME> , where she had been met by Mr Carker -- <NAME> stood upon the very spot where she had seen him coming down .
__label__0	The weather was cold , the heavens grey , but it was not snowing .
__label__0	It will be seen that he was an original , and it will be seen also how much <NAME> had lost by the death of Judge <NAME> , inasmuch as his case would come before this not very agreeable judge .
__label__1	This devil whom you make an angel of .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , with such a sudden accession of violence that <NAME> started in his boots , ‘ I throw you off for ever , miss .
__label__0	In sheer desperation , he endeavored to increase the intensity of his vision by applying to his eyes some belladonna which he found in the <NAME> ’ s_ medicine chest ; with heroic fortitude he endured the tortures of the experiment , and gazed up into the sky until he was nearly blind .
__label__1	And they do say , <NAME> and <NAME> , ’ lowering his voice , ‘ that he ’ s taken a dislike to her , and that she ’ s left , unnoticed , among the servants , and that his mind ’ s so set all the while upon having his son in the <NAME> , that although he ’ s only a baby now , he is going to have balances struck oftener than formerly , and the books kept closer than they used to be , and has even been seen ( when he thought he wasn ’ t ) walking in the <NAME> , looking at his ships and property and all that , as if he was exulting like , over what he and his son will possess together .
__label__1	I came down of my own accord .
__label__0	On the 20th of October a contract was entered into with the manufactory at <NAME> , near <NAME> , which during the war had furnished the largest <NAME> , cast-iron guns .
__label__0	As they are not whitewashed , and the stone is brown in colour , the streets , which are very narrow , have usually a sombre appearance .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , posted themselves in different parts of the wood , whilst the two cavaliers and <NAME> galloped in a radius of half a mile round the corral .
__label__1	You 're no trouble at all .
__label__0	`` Have you no need of my services , sir ? ''
__label__1	There was a distant glimmer of something that was not quite darkness , rather than of light , in the sky ; and foreboding night was shivering and restless , as the dying are who make a troubled end .
__label__0	“ I doubted , ” said he , holding out his hand to Dr. <NAME> , “ but now I doubt no longer. ” He invited the doctor , <NAME> , and the faithful <NAME> , of course , to his own dwelling .
__label__1	And now , my dear Sir , I put it to you .
__label__0	161 Natives of the <NAME> .
__label__0	Having made the tour of the world , he was behind-hand five minutes .
__label__1	You could as soon take up and shoulder an eight and forty pounder by your own strength as turn that man when he has got a thing into his head and fixed it there .
__label__0	The air was filled with sulphurous suffocating vapor , and a clump of huge pines , struck by the electric fluid , scarcely twenty feet from the tarantass , flared up like a gigantic torch .
__label__0	This time his companions followed him in the new exploration .
__label__0	The professor kept muttering in incoherent phrases : “ Rascal !
__label__0	All was stowed away , and happily there was no want of room in <NAME> , in which they might have housed all the treasures of the island .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> is not here ? ''
__label__1	And now he ’ s to bring home a new mistress , a baby-faced chit of a girl !
__label__1	Do n't break cover too soon .
__label__0	`` We shall not even get halfway . ''
__label__0	O , if I only knew half as much as he does , I might be <NAME> of the <NAME> ! ''
__label__1	<NAME> wilt uphold her here to her last hour .
__label__1	‘ Bless me ! ’ said <NAME> , stepping hastily forward , ‘ what is the matter ? ’ This inquiry produced in <NAME> violent symptoms of a relapse ; and several young ladies , darting angry looks at <NAME> , applied more vinegar and hartshorn , and said it was ‘ a shame. ’ ‘ What is a shame ? ’ demanded <NAME> .
__label__1	said Mrs. Bumble , in a voice of command .
__label__0	Now , at any rate , it is well to go on towards the north .
__label__1	Mrs <NAME> was affected to tears .
__label__1	For it is past your usual time , and will soon be late , and the way is long , and there is much company out of doors to-night. ’ She accepted the support he offered her , and they slowly passed out of the churchyard .
__label__0	<NAME> and his companions were obliged to fire upon the natives in order to regain their ship , from whence they could examine them at their leisure .
__label__1	‘ Now , ’ said <NAME> , gasping no less from excitement than from the expenditure of so much energy , ‘ come on -- both of you -- both of you ! ’ With this liberal invitation the worthy gentleman communicated a revolving motion to his clenched fists , by way of appalling his antagonists with a display of science .
__label__1	‘ That there knife -- ’ ‘ Stop , ’ said the man , composedly .
__label__1	' I never will believe it , sir , ' replied the old lady , firmly .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> , aunt ; my friend <NAME> whom I have spoken to you about , regarding -- you know , aunt. ’ And here <NAME> , who was not at the moment extraordinarily sober , added the word ‘ <NAME> , ’ in what was meant to be a whisper , but which was an especially audible and distinct tone of speech which nobody could avoid hearing , if anybody were so disposed .
__label__0	`` Chance will perhaps give us the key to this mystery ! ''
__label__0	Whether it was science that emboldened <NAME> , his phlegmatic stoicism that propped up the <NAME> , or his enthusiastic vivacity that cheered the irrepressible <NAME> , I can not exactly say .
__label__0	Before reaching it he had to cross the <NAME> , a tributary of the <NAME> , and to pass through Wow-wow , a district of <NAME> , the capital of which , also called Wow-wow , contained some 18,000 inhabitants .
__label__0	Such were the internal arrangements of <NAME> ’ s <NAME> , the refuge where the little colony were full of hope that they would be able to brave the rigors of the stern winter-time that lay before them -- a winter-time during which <NAME> might possibly be projected even to the orbit of <NAME> , where the temperature would not exceed one twenty-fifth of the normal winter temperature of the earth .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> lost his wife when <NAME> was born , and during his long voyages he left his little ones in charge of his cousin , a good old lady .
__label__1	For the face , it expressed nothing but violent and evil passions .
__label__1	Do not use such strong words. ’ ‘ He might have laid my dear boy dead at my feet .
__label__1	<NAME> , whom I had seen at <NAME> 's on the same occasion , also turned up .
__label__0	It was decided that the castaway , or rather the stranger as he was thenceforth termed by his companions , should live in one of the rooms of <NAME> , from which , however , he could not escape .
__label__1	There was a faint light in a chamber window not far off , and <NAME> ran towards that house to ask their way .
__label__1	<NAME> threadbare coats and trousers , such fusty gowns and shawls , such squashed hats and bonnets , such boots and shoes , such umbrellas and walking-sticks , never were seen in <NAME> .
__label__1	A thick , yellow liquor defiles them , which is offensive to the touch and sight and more offensive to the smell .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> seemed to be rather more grave than usual , and it may be acknowledged that his gravity was justified by the circumstances .
__label__1	Down there ! ’ At first this , and her terrific screams , were all that could be got from <NAME> , by any tears , by any prayers , by any representations , by any means .
__label__0	In fact , they had corn , but not flour , and the establishment of a mill was necessary .
__label__0	your father consents ! ” cried <NAME> .
__label__1	'Did you tell him to lock her and bar her in ? '
__label__0	“ Just there , sir , ” returned Ford , “ and I was able to light it only by bringing my lamp near to the cracks in the rock .
__label__1	‘ I can ’ t get up , ’ said the child , ‘ because my back ’ s bad , and my legs are queer .
__label__1	How can I ever thank you ?
__label__1	‘ Because , ’ said my aunt , ‘ it ’ s all I have .
__label__0	But the next day being Sunday , and also <NAME> Sunday , all agreed to sanctify the day by rest .
__label__0	“ We have left the road , ” said <NAME> , feeling that he was treading no longer on powdery soil but on short grass .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , closing the door , and keeping his hand on the knob of the lock .
__label__1	There , <NAME> , there ! ’ ‘ Well , ’ said <NAME> , rather sulkily , but giving the proffered hand a respectful shake at the same time -- ‘ well , so you ought to be , and I am very glad to find you air ; for , if I can help it , I won ’ t have him put upon by nobody , and that ’ s all about it. ’ ‘ Certainly not , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ The chief evil of their presence in the house , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ is that I can not be as near papa as I could wish -- <NAME> being so much between us -- and can not watch over him , if that is not too bold a thing to say , as closely as I would .
__label__0	“ The ‘ <NAME> ’ cruised about on this coast until the 3rd of March .
__label__0	Stunned for a moment—and it was a wonder it was no worse—J .
__label__1	The roof yet vibrated with the cheering , when the assembly dispersed .
__label__0	What can I do better than follow the method of that great analytical genius , <NAME> ? ” Judge Jarriquez herein alluded to a story by the great <NAME> romancer , which is a masterpiece .
__label__0	<NAME> followed the most minute details upon the chart traced by <NAME> himself , and was enabled to recognize its perfect accuracy .
__label__0	He said to himself that he , <NAME> , was the principal cause of so many disasters , since his old companion , <NAME> , had but realised his own plans , and a feeling of horror took possession of him .
__label__1	<NAME> sat upon the other side of me , next to <NAME> , to whom we imparted the whole history of the engagement as soon as we got back .
__label__0	`` No , <NAME> , '' replied <NAME> obstinately .
__label__1	A fleet of barges were coming lazily on , some sideways , some head first , some stern first ; all in a wrong-headed , dogged , obstinate way , bumping up against the larger craft , running under the bows of steamboats , getting into every kind of nook and corner where they had no business , and being crunched on all sides like so many walnut-shells ; while each with its pair of long sweeps struggling and splashing in the water looked like some lumbering fish in pain .
__label__1	Is it your pleasure to take <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Ah ! ’ said Mr Boffin .
__label__1	In that branch of it , which is devoted to the reception of old or otherwise helpless paupers , these words are <NAME> , <NAME> BLESSINGS. ’ It is not assumed and taken for granted that being there they must be evil-disposed and wicked people , before whose vicious eyes it is necessary to flourish threats and harsh restraints .
__label__1	I could not dress myself without help ; but I made up the fire , which was still burning , and got some coffee ready for them .
__label__1	She was much given to tying up her head in a pocket-handkerchief , knotted under the chin .
__label__0	Three mattresses , thick and well wadded , spread on the disc forming the false bottom of the Projectile , were arranged in lines whose parallelism was simply perfect .
__label__1	Very often afterwards , in the midst of their talk , he would break off , to try to understand what it was that the waves were always saying ; and would rise up in his couch to look towards that invisible region , far away .
__label__1	When they entered together , the shadow of the night of the return again darkened Mr <NAME> ’ s face .
__label__0	But that which made him jump was the recollection that it contained the precious document , the loss of which was irreparable , as it carried with it that of all his hopes .
__label__1	He might as well have been born with a yard and a half of it , and a remnant over . ''
__label__0	He stumbled and fell , accidentally catching hold of a rope with both hands in his fall .
__label__1	He was going to say that you were not -- what ?
__label__0	He fired his revolver , and two of the convicts fell ; but a blow from a knife which he could not ward off made a gash in his shoulder .
__label__1	The granite quays are remarkable for their beauty , solidity , and extent .
__label__1	‘ I ’ m sure I never deserved it from him , no , nor from you .
__label__1	I therefore hope , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ that you can make yourself happy in those relations. ’ ‘ I should have nothing to wish , sir , if— ’ ‘ I understand you , ’ said <NAME> ; ‘ you still refer to your father .
__label__0	For , candidly and truly speaking , never before had mortal eye revelled on such a scene of starry splendor .
__label__0	<NAME> and I , ” replied <NAME> , “ go where danger is certainly to be found , and without doubt news also. ” “ To the invaded provinces ? ” asked <NAME> with some earnestness .
__label__1	<NAME> ’ s the matter ? ’ ‘ Aha ! ’ replied the old gentleman , ‘ I began to be afeerd that you ’ d gone for a walk round the <NAME> , Sammy. ’ ‘ Come , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ none o ’ them taunts agin the wictim o ’ avarice , and come off that ‘ ere step .
__label__0	Meanwhile , though it had been decided to return , rest had become so necessary that for three days no preparations for departure were made .
__label__0	<NAME> to his exertions in its behalf all over the country , the phrase is now the most popular of the day , well known and relished in every part of the <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Side of One-tree <NAME> , at twelve o ’ clock , Sir. ’ ‘ That ’ s not <NAME> ’ s land , is it ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , <NAME> ; but it ’ s close by it .
__label__1	And now the bell -- the bell she had so often heard , by night and day , and listened to with solemn pleasure almost as a living voice -- rung its remorseless toll , for her , so young , so beautiful , so good .
__label__1	The <NAME> pointed as before .
__label__1	Sit down by the fire , and warm your -- your other one. ’ The little counter being so short a counter that it leaves the fireplace , which would have been behind it if it had been longer , accessible , Mr Wegg sits down on a box in front of the fire , and inhales a warm and comfortable smell which is not the smell of the shop .
__label__1	There ’ s a Mausoleum down at my place , in the park , but I ’ m afraid it ’ s in bad repair , and , in point of fact , in a devil of a state .
__label__0	For my own part , too many thoughts crowded my brain , too many insoluble questions pressed upon me , too many fancies kept my eyes half open .
__label__1	When she loved him , <NAME> , right well .
__label__1	So when the coachman came round for his fee , he pleasantly asked him what he considered a very good fee indeed , now -- a liberal one -- and on his replying half a crown for a single passenger , said it was little enough too , all things considered , and left <NAME> to give it him .
__label__1	‘ Uncle , ’ said <NAME> , when she judged they must be near their destination , ‘ I must ask one question of you .
__label__0	The five convicts had evidently camped on this spot ; but , -- and this was the object of so minute an examination , -- a sixth footprint could not be discovered , which in that case would have been that of <NAME> .
__label__0	“ Fifteen feet at the most , ” replied <NAME> .
__label__0	This beneficent spring after having saved us from thirst during so many days would now enable me to regain the right road .
__label__1	She had nothing else to tell him but that <NAME> ’ s secret had no reference whatever to the cruel charge , or its withdrawal .
__label__0	`` But these travellers must have been imprudent , '' said I to <NAME> .
__label__1	I have not , ’ said <NAME> , noticing his hesitation , and speaking with embarrassment himself : ‘ I have not told him anything about our last conversation , Mr Carker ; not even him , believe me .
__label__0	Notwithstanding his great age , his strength is astonishing , and his threats used to make me tremble. ” “ Go on , <NAME> , my child , ” said <NAME> to the girl , who paused as though to collect her thoughts .
__label__0	“ <NAME> ’ t go too far , ” said the Major , gravely , to the two hunters .
__label__0	What was certain was that <NAME> had been a member of the band for many years , that an intimate friendship existed between him and <NAME> , that they were always seen together , and that <NAME> had watched at his bedside when he died .
__label__1	You know that when I became enough of a man to find myself an embodied conundrum , I bored myself to the last degree by trying to find out what I meant .
__label__0	Trees were selected , cut down , stripped of their branches , and cut into beams , joists , and planks .
__label__0	“ You wanted to speak to me , <NAME> ? ” said <NAME> .
__label__1	But , as it chanced to be immediately under his nose , it followed , as a matter of course , that he looked all over his desk for it , without finding it ; and happening in the course of his search to look straight before him , his gaze encountered the pale and terrified face of <NAME> : who , despite all the admonitory looks and pinches of <NAME> , was regarding the repulsive countenance of his future master , with a mingled expression of horror and fear , too palpable to be mistaken , even by a half-blind magistrate .
__label__1	How do you find yourself , sir ? ’ In acknowledgement of this question , addressed to him with extraordinary curtness , <NAME> , uncomfortably clutching the blue bag he carried , replied that he was pretty well , he thanked my aunt , and hoped she was the same .
__label__1	It was upon this occasion that <NAME> , seated on the top of his throne in full council , rose , in the exuberance of his feelings , and commanded the lord chief justice to order in the richest wines and the court minstrels -- an act of graciousness which has been , through the ignorance of traditionary historians , attributed to King Cole , in those celebrated lines in which his Majesty is represented as Calling for his pipe , and calling for his pot , And calling for his fiddlers three .
__label__1	Not a word was spoken when we first went in ; and the <NAME> clock by the dresser seemed , in the silence , to tick twice as loud as usual .
__label__0	the doctor said to him .
__label__1	They did their work in silence like the men ; and like them were over-looked by the person contracting for their labour , or by some agent of his appointment .
__label__1	I believe I have as much influence with your Papa as anybody has .
__label__1	<NAME> , ma ’ am , work ; we must all work .
__label__0	He knew where <NAME> had taken refuge , and under what name the innocent man had again begun a new life .
__label__1	perhaps <NAME> first , ’ I admitted , with a blush .
__label__1	Welcome to your house and home , my deary ! ’ In all the first bewilderment of her wonder , the most bewilderingly wonderful thing to <NAME> was the shining countenance of Mr Boffin .
__label__1	I am changed , even in the little time since you last saw me. ’ ‘ Go thy ways with him , <NAME> , ’ cried the sexton , ‘ and Heaven be with ye both ! ’ ‘ I am quite ready , ’ said the old man , meekly .
__label__1	Not to risk being done out of the sweat of my brow , by any chances , I should wish afore going further to be swore in. ’ ‘ I am not a swearer in of people , man. ’ The visitor , clearly anything but reliant on this assurance , doggedly muttered ‘ Alfred David. ’ ‘ Is that your name ? ’ asked <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> , however , checked the intrepid explorers , who continued to follow the <NAME> , now dwindled down to a stream only 300 roods wide , and arrived in February at <NAME> , where they were received with enthusiasm at the camp of some trappers and fur hunters from <NAME> .
__label__1	The likeness passed away , like a breath along the surface of the gaunt pier-glass behind her , on the frame of which , a hospital procession of negro cupids , several headless and all cripples , were offering black baskets of <NAME> fruit to black divinities of the feminine gender -- and he made his formal bow to <NAME> .
__label__1	Whatever prejudiced and unauthorised constructions your blind and envious wrath may put upon his character , it is a frank , good-natured character .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> ! ’ said <NAME> , clearing his throat , and warming with the punch and with the fire .
__label__1	‘ Get me money , ’ he said wildly , as they parted for the night .
__label__1	Nor did he ever again face the doughty Mrs Pipchin , under <NAME> ’ s roof .
__label__1	‘ Cause they had both stood betwixt him and his getting his living by the sweat of his brow .
__label__1	Agreeing fur to mak one side unnat ’ rally awlus and for ever right , and toother side unnat ’ rally awlus and for ever wrong , will never , never do ’ t .
__label__1	I had no right , I knew very well , to be uncomfortable because she confided in me , and I felt it was unreasonable ; still , with all I could do , I could not quite help it .
__label__0	<NAME> tremblings ran along the mountain caused by internal bubblings , deep noise , distinctly transmitted through the liquid medium were echoed with majestic grandeur .
__label__0	“ But I think I heard you mention a village at the confluence of these rivers. ” “ Yes , ” said the geographer , “ here it is , marked on <NAME> ’ s map .
__label__1	My dear good man , in this world none of us can have _everything_ our own way. ’ This again went to the former point , and showed Mr Meagles with all good breeding that , so far , he had been brilliantly successful in his deep designs .
__label__1	For I did love him once .
__label__0	No man is brave in presence of an earthquake , or a bursting boiler , or an exploding torpedo .
__label__0	The launch was to take place at ten o'clock .
__label__1	'Pretty well , thank you , sir ' replied Oliver , with considerable hesitation .
__label__1	I tried to show her how I had hoped I had come into the better knowledge of myself and of her ; how I had resigned myself to what that better knowledge brought ; and how I had come there , even that day , in my fidelity to this .
__label__1	I am in a counting-house , and looking about me. ” “ Is a counting-house profitable ? ” I asked .
__label__1	‘ Of all the men I know , you are the best adapted , by nature and by position , for society .
__label__1	‘ I am sure we are constantly hearing , ma ’ am , till it becomes quite nauseous , concerning their wives and families , ’ said <NAME> .

__label__1	‘ Temporaries carries it all before ‘ em here , I find , but though there ’ s a excellent party-wall between this house and the next , I mayn ’ t exactly like to go to it , <NAME> , notwithstanding ! ’ these Adventures Though the offices of <NAME> and <NAME> were within the liberties of the <NAME> of <NAME> , and within hearing of <NAME> , when their clashing voices were not drowned by the uproar in the streets , yet were there hints of adventurous and romantic story to be observed in some of the adjacent objects .
__label__0	But what has won the greatest honor for the <NAME> government is that on the 31st of July , 1857 , after numerous frontier disputes between <NAME> and <NAME> , about the <NAME> boundary , the course of the <NAME> was declared to be free and open to all flags ; and , to make practice harmonize with theory , <NAME> entered into negotiations with the neighboring powers for the exploration of every river-road in the basin of the <NAME> .
__label__1	How should you like to grow up a clever man , and write books , eh ? '
__label__1	‘ Well , <NAME> , ’ said the buxom female , ‘ I ’ m sure I only spoke to you out of kindness. ’ ‘ <NAME> likely , mum , ’ replied <NAME> .
__label__1	At our own door , I found little <NAME> coming home from a little party escorted by her little lover ; and I envied her little lover , in spite of his being subject to <NAME> .
__label__0	Cruising down the western shores of <NAME> 's Bay a long deep gulf no less than fifty miles across gradually came in sight of the eager explorers , yet when on the 29th August the two vessels had sailed up it for thirty miles only <NAME> gave orders to tack about , on the ground that he distinctly saw at the further end a chain of lofty mountains to which he gave the name of <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ I can not bear to see you so , sir , ’ said Mrs. Sparsit .
__label__1	They all clamoured , as we entered , to the assistant-master , who accompanied us , ‘ Look at me , <NAME> !
__label__0	<NAME> deserves much > of the credit for inspiring the early rocket pioneers , and ultimately > today 's space program .
__label__0	<NAME> 's companions stayed with him at the fort of <NAME> ; they appeared much pleased with the country , enjoying the dates and other fruits on the island , `` and nothing seemed to harm them . ''
__label__0	On the 10th February , when not far from <NAME> , the corvette was caught in a violent storm , which lasted for thirty-six hours , and she was more than once on the point of foundering .
__label__1	It was like passing from death to life ; it was drawing nearer Heaven .
__label__1	<NAME> , loo , loo ; <NAME> , loo , loo !
__label__1	Though I am in these present quarters through no immediately preceding fault of mine , I can very well understand that if I had n't gone into the vagabond way in my youth , this would n't have happened .
__label__1	I have a presentiment that he WILL mention it the first thing this morning . ''
__label__0	As to <NAME> , he was roaming about the shore .
__label__0	For three months , during which a day seemed an age , the <NAME> furrowed all the waters of the <NAME> , running at whales , making sharp deviations from her course , veering suddenly from one tack to another , stopping suddenly , putting on steam , and backing ever and anon at the risk of deranging her machinery , and not one point of the <NAME> or <NAME> coast was left unexplored .
__label__1	He may kill me for it if he likes , or if he dares , but if I am here I 'll give him up .
__label__0	D'Urville was greatly surprised to find that a good many inaccuracies had crept into the work of the great <NAME> navigator , and in that part of the account of his voyage which relates to hydrography , he quotes instances of errors of a fourth , or even third of a degree .
__label__1	I only meant did you want your horse minded. ’ ‘ I ’ m going to get down in the next street , ’ returned the old gentleman .
__label__0	All around , the lonely sea extended to the limits of the horizon .
__label__1	Yet , he knew so little about the inmates that he gave them names of his own invention : as ‘ Miss <NAME> ’ , ‘ <NAME> ’ , ‘ Aunt <NAME> ’ , ‘ Uncle <NAME> ‘ -- having no authority whatever for any such designations , but particularly the last -- to which , as a natural consequence , he stuck with great obstinacy .
__label__1	I read in bed ( but to this hour I don ’ t know what ) a good deal ; and reeled on deck a little ; drank cold brandy-and-water with an unspeakable disgust , and ate hard biscuit perseveringly : not ill , but going to be .
__label__0	<NAME> at that great chasm just below us , somewhat to the right .
__label__1	`` I am not at all tired , my dear , '' said I , `` and would much prefer to go out . ''
__label__0	I think the form and also the nature of this island strange .
__label__0	Who knows but we may come across some vestige of the crew of the <NAME> , supposing them to have succeeded in escaping from <NAME> . ''
__label__1	Come and see. ’ He went on again , and <NAME> accompanied him .
__label__1	Go up stairs and get me my bonnet and shawl .
__label__1	He never knocked like that .
__label__1	When all the rest were got in and were seated , one of these mild men still appeared , in smiling confusion , totally destitute and unprovided for , and , escorted by the butler , made the complete circuit of the table twice before his chair could be found , which it finally was , on Mrs <NAME> ’ s left hand ; after which the mild man never held up his head again .
__label__0	<NAME> and <NAME> , and , indeed , the whole party , gave themselves up for lost , as the horses were fast getting out of their depth , and six feet of water would be enough to drown them .
__label__1	However opinions may differ on a variety of subjects , I should think it would be universally agreed , <NAME> , that I am not much to boast of . ''
__label__1	Not deriving much comfort from this elucidation , I pursued the inquiry still further , and found that the Transcendentalists are followers of my friend <NAME> , or I should rather say , of a follower of his , <NAME> .
__label__0	`` We have fifty chances out of a hundred of getting over , '' said one .
__label__1	I was very much concerned for his misfortunes , and felt that any recognition short of ninepence would be mere brutality and hardness of heart .
__label__0	He speaks of the inhabitants of <NAME> as clever magicians , who , by their enchantments , obtain the fulfilment of all their wishes as well as the power of stilling storms and tempests .
__label__1	There was a bell on board ; and as the ship rolled and dashed , like a desperate creature driven mad , now showing us the whole sweep of her deck , as she turned on her beam-ends towards the shore , now nothing but her keel , as she sprung wildly over and turned towards the sea , the bell rang ; and its sound , the knell of those unhappy men , was borne towards us on the wind .
__label__0	The bow was bent , the arrow flew , taking the cord with it , and passed between the two last rounds .
__label__1	We have done all that -- we know the worst of it ; we have got to the bottom , we can ’ t fall , and what have we found ?
__label__0	Two years and a half were spent in this manner .
__label__0	“ It is only a question of quantity. ” “ Then could you not use this nitro-glycerine for loading firearms ? ” asked the sailor .
__label__0	The <NAME> entered the Straits of Fo-Kien , which separate the island of Formosa from the <NAME> coast , in the small hours of the night , and crossed the Tropic of <NAME> .
__label__1	This was , when he was asked a Parliamentary question on any one topic , to return an answer on any other .
__label__1	The house was kept by a characteristic old couple , with whom we had a long talk , and who were perhaps a very good sample of that kind of people in the <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Your object being only to see her again , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ you could effect it at any time you chose by that means. ’ Lord <NAME> acknowledged the hint with a great many squeezes of <NAME> ’ s hard , horny hand , and whispering that they would now do well to close the conversation , called to <NAME> that he might come back .
__label__0	We have now reached the highest ridge of the <NAME> chain , and thus have merely to descend the slopes of the mountain .
__label__0	“ My dear <NAME> , ” said <NAME> , “ I told you , when we came on board a little while ago , that though we had not brought back <NAME> , our hope of finding him was stronger than ever .
__label__1	The <NAME> and the <NAME> then passed on together until they parted , with many ceremonies , at the <NAME> ’ s door ; even then the <NAME> carried his hat under his arm , and gave his streaming white hair to the breeze .
__label__0	`` Whatever <NAME> thinks of , attempts , or tries , what does it matter to me ?
__label__0	“ Where are you , <NAME> ? ” he shouted .
__label__0	“ <NAME> enough , but curious , and , what ’ s more , peculiar to <NAME> .
__label__0	But there was more that he had in store for him .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> was ordered to keep him company , and made no remonstrance .
__label__0	replied the engineer quickly , `` yes , even if I have to penetrate into the bowels of this island ! ''
__label__1	A few strange faces in the streets ; a few other faces , half strange and half familiar , once the faces of <NAME> children , now the faces of men and women who come back from the outer world at long intervals to find the city wonderfully shrunken in size , as if it had not washed by any means well in the meanwhile .
__label__1	At the same time a singular combination of perfumes was diffused through the room , as if some brandy had been put by mistake in a lavender-water bottle , or as if some lavender-water had been put by mistake in a brandy-bottle .
__label__0	This morning <NAME> awoke in very bad humor .
__label__0	We entered their country , as they dared not oppose us ; we endeavoured to disembark as friends , but we landed and maintained our superiority by force of arms .
__label__0	He made several attempts to cross the frozen ocean on a sledge , but was always turned back by ice which would not bear him .
__label__1	This <NAME> was <NAME> , <NAME> , to the <NAME> of such Other Countries as -- as there may happen to be .
__label__1	in quick reply to a gesture of dissent from the housekeeper .
__label__0	The doctor left his notes , and <NAME> his furnaces .
__label__1	In the first place , I had made a perfect brute of myself to you , on the subject of <NAME> ; and I felt that if you were asked to any wedding of mine , you would naturally expect that it was with <NAME> , which involved explanations , that upon my word and honour , at that crisis , would have knocked me completely over .
__label__0	`` I agree with you , honest <NAME> , '' returned the burgomaster , `` I agree with you .
__label__1	<NAME> went through it all in his patient manner , and admired it all exceedingly .
__label__0	Fortunately the mistake of the measure taken was immediately ascertained , and the crew were so overjoyed that they fancied all danger over .
__label__0	The storm exasperated him , the gale made him furious , and he longed to lash the obstinate sea into obedience .
__label__0	But it did not last long .
__label__0	It was pointed at an angle of ninety degrees , and suspended upon truncheons , so that the president could balance himself upon it as upon a rocking-chair , a very agreeable fact in the very hot weather .
__label__1	<NAME> to the <NAME> , my dear ma ’ am , if you don ’ t believe me .
__label__1	Even when he kissed her -- and I never saw him approach her , but I felt that nature had given him the soul of a gentleman -- she seemed to cling closer to her uncle , even to the avoidance of her chosen husband .
__label__1	<NAME> presents his kind regards to <NAME> , and will feel obliged if he will inform him at what hour tomorrow morning it will be most convenient to him to meet <NAME> at the Theatre , for the purpose of having his nose pulled in the presence of the company .
__label__0	He alone besides can tell us , if he has more than a hope , a certainty , of returning some day to his country , but I doubt it ! ” “ And why ? ” asked the reporter .
__label__0	Top wore a necklace of teal and <NAME> wreaths of snipe round his body .
__label__1	He only knew that it was quite correct ; that everything had happened so ; that there he was , alone again , when all the other boys had gone home for the jolly holidays .
__label__1	`` I admit it most fully and freely , '' said I .
__label__1	The expected guests are rather select than numerous , being <NAME> and Mrs. Chadband and no more .
__label__0	It was an essay on ballooning .
__label__0	<NAME> or in <NAME> a terrestrial paradise in comparison to either .
__label__1	The station for the country house was at the opposite end of the town , the time was short , the road not easy ; but she was so quick in pouncing on a disengaged coach , so quick in darting out of it , producing her money , seizing her ticket , and diving into the train , that she was borne along the arches spanning the land of coal-pits past and present , as if she had been caught up in a cloud and whirled away .
__label__1	You were the first to mention her name .
__label__1	You can not think what a sad change has fallen on us since. ’ ‘ I am very , very sorry , to hear you speak like this , my dear ! ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> and he had now reached the shop , where <NAME> left his companion to make his purchases , after recommending him not to miss the steamer , and hurried back to the consulate .
__label__0	The guide now led the elephant out of the thicket , and leaped upon his neck .
__label__1	The discreet Mrs Wilfer now looking out of window and beholding her daughter in conference with her lodger , instantly tied up her head and came out for a casual walk .
__label__0	`` Well , I hope he 'll never know them ! ''
__label__1	`` And again , '' says mademoiselle with more tight and angry nods .
__label__1	‘ No , <NAME> , ’ cried <NAME> , interrupting him , and rubbing his hands in an ecstasy .
__label__1	I am bent upon it -- so is <NAME> .
__label__0	The wagon resumed its course in the opposite direction , and did not stop again till they halted for the night at the foot of <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ No , don ’ t , ’ said <NAME> , folding his crushed hat to lay his elbow on , and bringing himself still closer to the young lady ; ‘ upon my life , you oughtn ’ t to .
__label__0	Still , up to the 24th of January , 1779 , no important event occurred .
__label__1	<NAME> had not been idle , for there was a little cart at the door , and the effects were hurrying out already .
__label__0	On a sign from the engineer , <NAME> and <NAME> examined the bodies , already stiffened by the cold .
__label__1	How they had employed <NAME> as their sole clerk and agent , seeing to whom he was devoted .
__label__1	‘ I can ’ t help it , ’ cried Mrs. Nickleby .
__label__1	I should speak of foreign dancers , and the <NAME> End of <NAME> , and May Fair , and lords and ladies and honourables. ’ ‘ I trust , sir , ’ rejoined Mrs. Sparsit , with decent resignation , ‘ it is not necessary that you should do anything of that kind .
__label__0	<NAME> had admitted the tired dogs into the snow-house ; when the snow is falling heavily it serves as a covering to the animals , preserving their natural heat .
__label__1	About midnight I got out of bed and went to <NAME> , with the conviction that I had been asleep for four-and-twenty hours , and that Wednesday was past .
__label__1	‘ Thank you , it ’ s of no consequence , ’ retorted Mr Toots .
__label__0	Two days after starting , the <NAME> , having made four hundred and eighty miles , came in sight of the coast of <NAME> .
__label__0	The precincts were strewed with the dead wolves , and judging from their numbers , it was evident how violent the attack must have been , and how desperate the resistance .
__label__1	Very glad indeed to have the pleasure .
__label__0	“ Hurrah ! ” cried the sailor , who did not disdain to celebrate thus his own triumph .
__label__1	`` They 're wot 's left , <NAME> , '' says Jo , `` out of a sov-ring as wos give me by a lady in a wale as sed she wos a servant and as come to my crossin one night and asked to be showd this 'ere ouse and the ouse wot him as you giv the writin to died at , and the berrin-ground wot he 's berrid in .
__label__1	You see me at my greatest disadvantage .
__label__0	[ Illustration : `` The little band made their way towards the southeast . '' ]
__label__0	A hundred paces away from the prison , however , the waste land was crossed by one of those canals which flow through the town into the <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Now , <NAME> , who is that person ? ’ said <NAME> , pointing to <NAME> , who , as the spokesman of his friends , stood hat in hand , bowing with the utmost politeness and respect .
__label__1	You quite understand that the young lady do n't ride to-day , and that I dine at the young lady 's ? ” “ Quite so , sir ! ” When the waiter had felt my fast-cooling teapot with the palm of his hand , and had looked imploringly at me , and had gone out , <NAME> , careful not to move the shoulder next me , took a cigar from his pocket and bit the end off , but showed no sign of stirring .
__label__1	Mr <NAME> has seen him for some days past , and a very clever man I believe him to be .
__label__1	<NAME> curious , your delightful sex is ! ''
__label__1	The sound was far away -- now in one quarter , now answered in another -- nor was it any guide , for it often came from shipboard , as he knew .
__label__0	But at last he arrived at the partition dividing the after-cabin , and found the door opening into the magazine itself .
__label__1	‘ Any snow , or sleet , or slush , or anything of that sort ? ’ he asked .
__label__1	Mrs. Perkins , who has not been for some weeks on speaking terms with Mrs. Piper in consequence for an unpleasantness originating in young <NAME> ' having `` fetched '' young Piper `` a crack , '' renews her friendly intercourse on this auspicious occasion .
__label__1	Proud I am sure to have the honour !
__label__1	Those Saturdays were <NAME> for at least two little Christians among all the Jews , and did the holy <NAME> work of strengthening and knitting up a brother ’ s and a sister ’ s love .
__label__1	The evening grew more dull every moment , and a melancholy wind sounded through the deserted fields , like a distant giant whistling for his house-dog .
__label__1	‘ You ’ ll lose it again , if you don ’ t take care. ’ So just to prevent his losing it again , she put it on for him .
__label__0	if I had a harpoon , I bet my head that I could send it into one of the four yellow spots they have on their bodies .
__label__1	She then seemed to come to it all at once .
__label__0	`` But it is not a gun for powder , '' answered the <NAME> .
__label__0	row hard ! ” Not one of the rowers turned his head -- not an oar-stroke must be lost .
__label__1	Where does your sister live ? ’ ‘ Why , she is not settled yet , Mr Headstone .
__label__1	But I have an interest in the little creature , and a respect for her that I can not express to you .
__label__0	They set out accordingly about ten o ’ clock in the morning , <NAME> confident , <NAME> joyous , <NAME> murmuring aside , -- “ If , on my return , I find a fire at the house , I shall believe that the thunder itself came to light it. ” All three climbed the bank ; and arrived at the angle made by the river , the sailor , stopping , said to his two companions , -- “ Shall we begin by being hunters or wood-men ? ” “ <NAME> , ” replied <NAME> .
__label__0	The reporter 's argument was just , and besides , the incident of the bullet proved that a shot must have been fired in <NAME> within three months .
__label__1	“ You , is it , <NAME> ? ” “ It is , <NAME> .
__label__0	I soon threw myself on an ottoman , and took a book , which my eyes overran mechanically .
__label__1	‘ Declines to marry ? ’ another guesses .
__label__0	The simplest conversations threatened to wander to that point , and any word might kindle a blaze of controversy .
__label__1	The brother and sister of his false favourite had no such relief ; everything in their history , past and present , gave his delinquency a more afflicting meaning to them .
__label__1	Once for all ; I loved her none the less because I knew it , and it had no more influence in restraining me than if I had devoutly believed her to be human perfection .
__label__0	But they had to be careful with the spirits , the latter being more likely to produce than to quench thirst .
__label__1	Perhaps because her appearance was not of a commercial cast , or perhaps because it occurred to him that his having taken her to wife might expose his judgment to doubt in the minds of customers , Mr <NAME> laid his commands upon her that she should hold her peace on the subject of her conjugal relations , and should no longer call him Jeremiah out of the domestic trio .
__label__1	‘ Well , then , draw that little table into this window , and let me get out of hearing of those prosy politics. ’ ‘ Jane , ’ said <NAME> , to the servant who brought in candles , ‘ go down into the office , and bring me up the file of the <NAME> for eighteen hundred and twenty-six .
__label__0	The vessels left this harbour before the end of March , and steered to the west-north-west , in search of the land discovered by <NAME> , between 27 degrees and 28 degrees south .
__label__1	Do I know , without being very wise , where you would like to go , direct from these walls and from this room ? ’ ‘ You do , ’ returned <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Well , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Mr Headstone coming home , ma ’ am. ’ In about a minute , <NAME> again hailed .
__label__0	[ Illustration : Portrait of <NAME> .
__label__1	All times will be alike to me. ’ He listened to the man ’ s retreating footsteps until the sound had passed , and then , gazing up into the sky , saw , or thought he saw , the same black cloud that had seemed to follow him home , and which now appeared to hover directly above the house .
__label__0	Falling from the summit of <NAME> 's , it strikes the earth at the rate of 300 miles an hour , or five times quicker than the rapidest express train .
__label__1	My aunt and I were at that time vacating the two cottages at <NAME> ; I intending to go abroad , and she to return to her house at <NAME> .
__label__0	From this , our first real stage , we began to ascend the slopes of the <NAME> volcano .
__label__1	‘ Here they are , you see , ’ said Mr Meagles .
__label__1	I gave them an undertaking on which they sent down your discharge ; it ’ s very awkward , my dear <NAME> ; what will you do ?
__label__0	I had imagined that , the chance gone , I should have time to reflect and discuss the matter .
__label__1	‘ The strange gentleman -- him as had his arm hurt -- a-kissin ’ and huggin ’ -- ‘ ‘ Who , <NAME> ?
__label__1	‘ I ha never thowt yet , missus , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ o ’ askin thy name. ’ The old lady announced herself as ‘ Mrs .
__label__0	But , for your life , don ’ t do so until I give the word ! ” “ Be easy on that point. ” “ Otherwise , we should miss <NAME> , and he would be lost. ” “ Count upon me ! ” The <NAME> at that moment almost commanded the troop of horsemen who were still desperately urging their steeds at <NAME> ’ s heels .
__label__0	`` You are right , <NAME> , '' said the doctor ; `` if we leave to-morrow , Tuesday , February 26th , we ought to reach the <NAME> March 15th , at the risk of starving to death .
__label__1	But she never explained it ; and it had , in consequence , the charm of mystery , in addition to the advantage of the sharpest expression .
__label__1	<NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , have , collectively or separately , been the attendants of my career. ” ’ The relish with which <NAME> described himself as a prey to these dismal calamities , was only to be equalled by the emphasis with which he read his letter ; and the kind of homage he rendered to it with a roll of his head , when he thought he had hit a sentence very hard indeed .
__label__0	From this point the view of the sea was much extended , but on the right the high promontory prevented their seeing whether there was land beyond it .
__label__1	By the time the meal was over , the rain , which seemed to have worn itself out by coming down so fast , was nearly over too ; and it became feasible to go on deck : which was a great relief , notwithstanding its being a very small deck , and being rendered still smaller by the luggage , which was heaped together in the middle under a tarpaulin covering ; leaving , on either side , a path so narrow , that it became a science to walk to and fro without tumbling overboard into the canal .
__label__1	It ’ s a triumph , too , to tear her away from a gallant young rival : a great triumph for an old man !
__label__1	Come -- to play. ” “ Come nearer ; let me look at you .
__label__1	<NAME> could make no reply , but looked his anxiety to be gone at once .
__label__0	They were then occupying the center of a rocky plain , which the sun scorched with its parching rays .
__label__0	`` With this we could go round -- '' `` The world ? ''
__label__0	In a quarter of an hour he had obtained the following table : _a_ = 3 times _b_ = 4 -- _c_ = 3 -- _e_ = 9 -- _i_ = 4 -- _j_ = 8 -- _k_ = 9 -- _l_ = 9 -- _m_ = 9 -- _n_ = 9 -- _t_ = 8 -- Total ... 276 times .
__label__0	This was all his apparatus .
__label__0	Besides , it did not offer the same security , and its tenants , notwithstanding their watchfulness , were here always in fear of some shot from the convicts .
__label__1	said <NAME> , checking himself , with native majesty , 'this is them wicious paupers ! '
__label__0	Like the coral islands of the <NAME> , it may , for aught we know , be still rising by slow and imperceptible degrees .
__label__1	He stops in his rubbing and looks at her , with his hands on his knees .
__label__1	The commodities chiefly exposed for sale in the public streets are marine stores , hard-bake , apples , flat-fish , and oysters .
__label__1	I don ’ t kiss my coat-cuff ; I kisses the book. ’ It was not so much in deference to these strong testimonials to character , as in his restless casting about for any way or help towards the discovery on which he was concentrated , that <NAME> replied : ‘ You needn ’ t take offence .
__label__1	For two or three months , he contented himself with hinting that he feared the air began to disagree with him ; then , finding that the place really no longer was , to him , what it had been , he settled his business on his assistant , took a bachelor 's cottage outside the village of which his young friend was pastor , and instantaneously recovered .
__label__1	‘ I ’ ve found ‘ em out , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ No , <NAME> ’ s-delight , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ I am not afeard .
__label__0	He has as much right to speak here as any one ! ” “ Yes , ” said <NAME> , “ but his reserve does him honor , and it is right to respect the feeling which he has about his sad past. ” “ Certainly , <NAME> , ” answered the sailor , “ and there is no fear of my doing so again .
__label__1	His patronage did not stop here ; for he charged <NAME> to get the tea ready , and instructed her to buy certain tea-cakes , fresh butter , eggs , cold ham , and shrimps : to purchase which collation he gave her a bank-note for ten pounds , laying strict injunctions on her to be careful of the change .
__label__0	`` Three thousand six hundred and twenty-seven fathoms , '' replied the lieutenant , entering it in his notebook .
__label__1	When she had entered two or three laborious items in the account-book , <NAME> would walk over the page , wagging his tail , and smear them all out .
__label__0	“ Let us go in and watch , ” answered the engineer .
__label__0	Had Darwinian theories been in vogue in those days , no doubt <NAME> would have recognized in them that missing link between man and monkey , which is the despair of <NAME> 's followers .
__label__0	But not being contented with simply the produce , they made chase after the producers , the result of which was that they were able to bring back to <NAME> a dozen of these chelonians , which were really valuable in an alimentary point of view .
__label__1	<NAME> waited some little while before he spoke again .
__label__0	On coming down from the slight eminence <NAME> went on in front , as it had been agreed that he was to be our guide .
__label__0	<NAME> feet above this bridge is a second , fifty feet long by forty wide , and not more than eight feet thick in the middle .
__label__1	My <NAME> 's lips move , but they utter nothing .
__label__0	They were mimosas , figs , hibisci , and palm trees , mingled together in profusion ; and under the shelter of their verdant vault grew orchids , leguminous plants , and ferns .
__label__1	I think you must have remarked that I could not forbear a tribute to those charms when I put up the steps of the 'ackney-coach .
__label__1	It was all part of a system .
__label__1	It needed no great pressing to induce me to stay , for if my curiosity has been excited on the occasion of my first visit , it certainly was not diminished now .
__label__0	“ My companions are <NAME> like myself .
__label__1	Let me relieve you of that bundle !
__label__0	The lungs are satisfied with a provision of vegetable and farinaceous food .
__label__0	The enormous cavern was empty .
__label__1	Likewise you 're a oncommon scholar. ” “ No , I am ignorant and backward , Joe. ” “ Why , see what a letter you wrote last night !
__label__1	But the government of the country , having neither act nor part in them , is not in the receipt of any portion of the gratitude they inspire ; and , offering very little shelter or relief beyond that which is to be found in the workhouse and the jail , has come , not unnaturally , to be looked upon by the poor rather as a stern master , quick to correct and punish , than a kind protector , merciful and vigilant in their hour of need .
__label__1	Mr Merdle himself was usually late on these occasions , as a man still detained in the clutch of giant enterprises when other men had shaken off their dwarfs for the day .
__label__0	`` I ca n't tell ; '' answered <NAME> , `` but , as a conjecture , I should say that it is probably to the comparatively smaller area of the <NAME> and the more violent character of her volcanic action that the extremely rugged character of her surface is mainly due . ''
__label__1	There was but one consideration to set against the heavy loss of <NAME> , and though it was slight comfort to her burdened heart , she tried to think it some relief .
__label__0	But before entering on the narrative of this memorable campaign , we must give a few particulars of the man who has left us the most complete account of it , <NAME> or <NAME> as he is often called in <NAME> .
__label__0	There under the shade of the trees fluttered several couples of gallinaceae belonging to the pheasant species .
__label__0	And the doctor , dragging the old sailor under the tent , made him plunge his hands into a bowl of water , which the heat of the stove had kept liquid , although it was not much above the freezing-point ; but <NAME> 's hands had no sooner touched it than it froze at once .
__label__1	Just as anybody might. ’ ‘ Precisely so , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> detained it while he murmured a profusion of compliments , which <NAME> , remembering what had passed between them , rightly considered as so many aggravations of the insult he had already put upon her .
__label__0	and 151 degrees 55 minutes E. long .
__label__0	After some minutes , our fall was stopped .
__label__1	There was daily duty to discharge , and daily work to do -- for such commonplace spirits that are not heroic , often work hard with their hands -- and <NAME> was soon busy with her household tasks .
__label__0	But they found nothing , some curious formations of the rocks having deceived them .
__label__1	There were more than two full hours yet to elapse before she could come , and in that interval , which seemed a long one , I must confess I was nervously anxious about my altered looks .
__label__1	Whether him as I have spoke so much of , chanced to see ‘ em going theer , or whether ( which is most like , to my thinking ) he had heerd it from the woman , I doen ’ t greatly ask myself .
__label__0	They are much prone to drink to excess ; they are very proud and disdainful to strangers , and have no respect for the lives of human beings . ''
__label__0	Then imagine a fall from a height of four thousand miles !
__label__1	Even with those aids , I might not have come to myself as soon as I did , but that I saw <NAME> approaching with the keys , to let me out .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> now watched the captain with extreme care .
__label__1	How I persuaded myself that this was likely , I do n't know .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , ’ said his mistress and partner , flashing into a sudden energy that made <NAME> start , ‘ why do you goad me ?
__label__0	cried <NAME> , half rising from his bed , notwithstanding his weakness .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , my dear boy , ’ said Mr Meagles , on the evening of the following day , ‘ Mother and I have been talking this over , and we don ’ t feel comfortable in remaining as we are .
__label__0	I could no longer judge of the time that was passing .
__label__0	The wheels were in a good condition and firmly fixed , but the springs had lost all elasticity .
__label__0	`` We shall soon see , '' rejoined the sailor , `` but I would wager my head there are no rocks in the channel .
__label__1	Some ( among whom was <NAME> ) were disposed to think that <NAME> contemplated a matrimonial alliance ; but this idea the ladies most strenuously repudiated .
__label__0	Among them were a few isolated cones , revealing the mark of the eternal snows .
__label__1	The consequence was , that <NAME> had the double mortification of being an indispensable part of the circle when <NAME> and his friends were there , and of being exposed , on that very account , to all Mrs. Wititterly ’ s ill-humours and caprices when they were gone .
__label__1	When it thundered very loudly , he glanced towards <NAME> , having it in his mind that some of the tall chimneys might be struck by lightning .
__label__0	The `` Froöern '' had indeed been driven to a place forty miles from where <NAME> had taken up his winter quarters .
__label__1	‘ It ’ s the contemplation of this sort of thing , that makes me deplore my fate in being a bachelor .
__label__1	Come both of you ! ’ ‘ Come , <NAME> , ’ said the little man .
__label__1	My time is nearly all devoted to some very intimate friends .
__label__0	Although the King of <NAME> looked more than a hundred years old , he was very gay and light-hearted .
__label__0	The most abrupt declivity of these mountains confronts the <NAME> coast , but the western slopes are merely inclined planes .
__label__0	At last Pittonaccio seized it , and , uttering a horrible blasphemy , ingulfed himself in the earth .
__label__1	Mrs <NAME> stopped in her lamentations on the corruption of human nature , even when beckoned to the paths of virtue by a <NAME> ; and received her with a welcome something short of the reception due to none but perfect Dombeys .
__label__1	But I rejoice in its occurrence , for it has opened the way for me to approach <NAME> with this subject to-day , even if it has entailed upon me the penalty of her temporary displeasure .
__label__0	Then , turning towards the orb of day , whose last rays lapped the horizon of the sea , he exclaimed : `` <NAME> , sun !
__label__0	said the doctor , gazing at the chart .
__label__0	It had been a hard day 's work for the men .
__label__1	‘ I have every reason to believe , my dear -- indeed I may say I know , ’ returned <NAME> , ‘ that he is wealthy .
__label__0	One might have said that a corner from the virgin forests of <NAME> or <NAME> had been transported into this temperate zone .
__label__1	But , when one means to be good-natured and sportive with young people , one doesn ’ t think twice .
__label__1	<NAME> does not see , otherwise , what he has to do with marriage .
__label__0	“ The fewer one ’ s comforts , the fewer one ’ s needs ; and the fewer one ’ s needs , the greater one ’ s happiness. ” “ Now , now , ” said the Major , “ here is Paganel running a tilt against riches and gilt ceilings. ” “ No , <NAME> , ” replied the <NAME> , “ I ’ m not ; but if you like , I ’ ll tell you a little <NAME> story that comes into my mind , very APROPOS this minute. ” “ Oh , do , do , ” said <NAME> .
__label__1	We ’ ll try that too. ’ He stopped , and then walked on again .
__label__0	To judge by his appearance this miserable being had no longer anything human about him , and yet Harding , as had the reporter already , observed in his look an indefinable trace of intelligence .
__label__0	They then began to repent , but too late , the intrepidity which had prompted them to leave their native shores ; for intrepid they justly deserve to be called , seeing that again and again they asked the <NAME> sailors if they were not to be eaten , and it took several days of kind treatment to dispel this fear from their minds .
__label__0	Thus it had been agreed that <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> should remain at <NAME> , but an objection was raised , and <NAME> , who had not forgotten his business as reporter to the <NAME> , having declared that he would go by swimming rather than lose such an opportunity , he was admitted to take a part in the voyage .
__label__1	He encounters <NAME> ; and who he was , is herein made manifest The whole capital which <NAME> found himself entitled to , either in possession , reversion , remainder , or expectancy , after paying his rent and settling with the broker from whom he had hired his poor furniture , did not exceed , by more than a few halfpence , the sum of twenty shillings .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> and water-erily you mean , sir , ’ he returned , with some little thickness of speech , in consequence of the Gum-Ticklers having tickled it .
__label__1	I told him I had come up again to say how sorry I was that anything disagreeable should have occurred , and that I hoped he would not blame me much .
__label__1	Now , what ’ ll you read on ? ’ ‘ Thank you , sir , ’ returned <NAME> , as if there were nothing new in his reading at all .
__label__0	From thence he proceeded to <NAME> , where he remained for two years , and bought a large portion of the oriental manuscripts which now enrich the library of <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> at last resumed : “ Here is my plan : We have two hundred pounds of ballast left , since the bags we brought with us are still untouched .
__label__0	In fact , on the night of the 23rd , the hull entirely broke up , and some of the wreck was cast up on the beach .
__label__1	Thus , although a room of modest situation -- for its windows gave on <NAME> ’ s old corner -- and of no pretensions to velvet , satin , or gilding , it had got itself established in a domestic position analogous to that of an easy dressing-gown or pair of slippers ; and whenever the family wanted to enjoy a particularly pleasant fireside evening , they enjoyed it , as an institution that must be , in Mr <NAME> ’ s room .
__label__1	‘ You will not undeceive her I hope , Mr Boffin ? ’ she said , turning her head towards him , but not her eyes .
__label__0	The unfortunate <NAME> was lost in the storm !
__label__1	now I ’ m off. ’ ‘ I hope you are , ’ said <NAME> to himself .
__label__1	I know to a figure how you done it .
__label__1	‘ I ask you , <NAME> , are you frightened ?
__label__1	They whisper at the fountain , that although condemned to death he will not be executed ; they say that petitions have been presented in <NAME> , showing that he was enraged and made mad by the death of his child ; they say that a petition has been presented to the King himself .
__label__0	<NAME> went back to <NAME> , who stood beside <NAME> , with his arms crossed , looking quietly at the troubled waves .
__label__1	I ’ ve giv ’ notice of the circumstarnce to the police , and the police have took possession of it .
__label__0	He picked it up and turned it over and over .
__label__0	No ; these vibrations are due to the effervescence of the central fire .
__label__1	Her innocent face looked back so brightly over his shoulder , as he walked away with her , singing her the song of the child ’ s game : ‘ Who passes by this road so late ?
__label__1	You have always ( as I have informed Mrs General ) been my favourite child ; I have always made you a -- hum -- a friend and companion ; in return , I beg -- I -- ha -- I _do_ beg , that you accommodate yourself better to -- hum -- circumstances , and dutifully do what becomes your -- your station. ’ Mr <NAME> was even a little more fragmentary than usual , being excited on the subject and anxious to make himself particularly emphatic .
__label__0	Then <NAME> , having taken his measures with consummate prudence , and the surprise and terror of a nocturnal attack which he organized compensating for the inferiority of his troops , he made prisoners of his enemy and all his soldiers , his own loss amounting to but two men .
__label__0	One of the chiefs in the island sent to <NAME> as a delicacy , a quarter of a child , but the <NAME> commander caused it to be buried in the presence of the natives , who appeared much hurt by an act which they could not understand .
__label__1	replied the voice of the <NAME> , through the key-hole .
__label__1	But he bought more than one. ’ ‘ Yes , to be sure , sir ; he bought several ; and wishing to lay out his money to the best , he took my opinion to guide his choice , and we went over the collection together .
__label__0	It was indeed a position to drive the sanest man to madness !
__label__1	The lady was upon a journey all alone , strange as we might think it , and could she rest herself where you 're a setten for a hour or so .
__label__0	<NAME> and <NAME> were soon saddled , and in twenty minutes had carried their riders to the western extremity of the island , where they both dismounted and began to explore the coast .
__label__1	The two caps , reflected on the window-blind , were the respective head- dresses of a couple of Mrs. <NAME> ’ s most particular acquaintance , who had just stepped in , to have a quiet cup of tea , and a little warm supper of a couple of sets of pettitoes and some toasted cheese .
__label__1	I loved my darling so well that I was more concerned for their effect on her than on any one .
__label__1	Also , <NAME> , _his wife_ , having a ring and chain on the left leg. ’ ‘ Ran away , a negro boy named <NAME> .
__label__1	Some of the drivers are blacks , some whites .
__label__0	`` Yes , they tried to reach <NAME> 's <NAME> , and separated into several parties .
__label__1	'This purse , ' cried the young lady .
__label__1	What devil possesses you ? ’ ‘ Their name is <NAME> , ’ she replied , uprearing her proud form as if she would have crushed him ; ‘ you and your master have raised them in a fruitful house , and they shall tear you both .
__label__1	‘ Have you got your gloves on ? ’ Yes , Sir. ’ ‘ Then take the kiver off. ’ ‘ Yes , Sir. ’ The greengrocer did as he was told , with a show of great humility , and obsequiously handed <NAME> the carving-knife ; in doing which , he accidentally gaped .
__label__1	`` Not even any one who had attended on him ? ''
__label__0	`` Well , perhaps the Selenites have carried the integral calculus farther than you have ; and , by the bye , what is this ` integral calculus ? ' ''
__label__0	`` A man like <NAME> would not dodge with his enemy , or ensnare him , would not even maneuver !
__label__1	There is a positive vulgarity in carrying your business affairs about with you as you do. ’ ‘ How do I carry them about , <NAME> ? ’ asked Mr Merdle .
__label__1	Mr Wegg opens the gate , descries a sort of brown paper truncheon under Mr <NAME> ’ s arm , and remarks , in a dry tone : ‘ Oh !
__label__0	Our rapid passage across the <NAME> had not allowed him to put his project into execution , and he could not help showing his disappointment .
__label__1	However , ’ said <NAME> , relapsing into the cheerful , chattering tone , which was habitual to her , ‘ I have said my say , and a very long say it is , and a very wrong say too , I shouldn ’ t wonder at all .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> 's indifference did not content <NAME> .
__label__1	All this , <NAME> , although himself somewhat of an impetuous gentleman : knowing his friend 's peculiarities , bore with great good humour ; as <NAME> , at tea , was graciously pleased to express his entire approval of the muffins , matters went on very smoothly ; and <NAME> , who made one of the party , began to feel more at his ease than he had yet done in the fierce old gentleman 's presence .
__label__0	And so , if the document could be read , if the key had been found , if the cipher on which the system hung were known , no doubt of its truth could be entertained .
__label__1	When it is better for the happiness of all parties that no visiting should take place , ( as in the case of our brother <NAME> , and his establishment ) that is quite different. ’ I intimated that my aunt would be proud and delighted to make their acquaintance ; though I must say I was not quite sure of their getting on very satisfactorily together .
__label__0	In fact , it was to the end of the world that he wanted to go .
__label__0	“ What is there , <NAME> ? ” he asked .
__label__1	<NAME> ! ’ ‘ Yes , your Worship. ’ ‘ Is Grummer downstairs ? ’ ‘ Yes , your Worship. ’ ‘ Send him up. ’ The obsequious <NAME> retired , and presently returned , introducing the elderly gentleman in the top-boots , who was chiefly remarkable for a bottle-nose , a hoarse voice , a snuff-coloured surtout , and a wandering eye .
__label__1	‘ No , he didn ’ t , <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Son of Bitherstone of <NAME> .
__label__0	Let us call it <NAME> ! ” The engineer ’ s proposal was replied to by three hurrahs .
__label__0	The hull would be safe for some hours yet .
__label__0	The examination of the mine was carried on minutely .
__label__1	It was you , was it ? ’ ‘ Me ! ’ returned <NAME> , in a loud tone .
__label__1	You pusillanimous , abject , cringing dogs !
__label__1	Taking him into custody for that purpose , or overshadowing him as if he really were his <NAME> in visible form , Mr <NAME> clapped Mr <NAME> ’ s hat upon the back of his head , and walked him out by the arm , asserting a proprietorship over his soul and body that was at once more grim and more ridiculous than anything in Mr <NAME> ’ s rare collection .
__label__1	Is it , '' says <NAME> , glancing over the table , `` from bread in various forms , from butter which is churned from the milk which is yielded unto us by the cow , from the eggs which are laid by the fowl , from ham , from tongue , from sausage , and from such like ?
__label__1	They must not be confounded together .
__label__0	I to urge you to an act which would be the disgrace of a life consecrated to the highest speculations of the higher mechanics ? ” “ <NAME> , Mrs. Scorbitt !
__label__0	It now appeared clear that we were walking upon a kind of sedimentary soil , formed like all the soils of that period , so frequent on the surface of the globe , by the subsidence of the waters .
__label__0	<NAME> could neither sit , stand nor lie still for a second , though he tried all three .
__label__0	Some pipes full of opium lay upon the table .
__label__1	Her hair , braided by her own hands , was bound about a head , whose intellectual capacity and development were beautifully expressed in its graceful outline , and its broad open brow ; her dress , arranged by herself , was a pattern of neatness and simplicity ; the work she had knitted , lay beside her ; her writing-book was on the desk she leaned upon.—From the mournful ruin of such bereavement , there had slowly risen up this gentle , tender , guileless , grateful-hearted being .
__label__0	Feofar-Khan , including his own soldiers , and those of the <NAME> of <NAME> and Koun-douze , had now under his command two hundred and fifty thousand men , to which the <NAME> government could not as yet oppose a sufficient force .
__label__1	His appearance , after visiting Mrs. Smallweed with one of these admonitions , is particularly impressive and not wholly prepossessing , firstly because the exertion generally twists his black skull-cap over one eye and gives him an air of goblin rakishness , secondly because he mutters violent imprecations against Mrs. Smallweed , and thirdly because the contrast between those powerful expressions and his powerless figure is suggestive of a baleful old malignant who would be very wicked if he could .
__label__1	‘ But what makes you say this along of <NAME> , father ? ’ asked his wife , anxiously .
__label__1	<NAME> was the convincing reasoning of <NAME> ; and influenced by such arguments did <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> engage to array themselves in costumes which his taste and experience induced him to recommend as admirably suited to the occasion .
__label__1	But these flights of fancy seldom burnished the brass plate of <NAME> and <NAME> ’ s Offices into a tablet of golden hope , or shed a brilliant lustre on their dirty skylights ; and when the <NAME> and <NAME> talked about <NAME> and masters ’ daughters , <NAME> felt that he understood his true position at <NAME> and <NAME> ’ s , much better than they did .
__label__1	Let me speak of it in its place .
__label__1	The President will have a gentleman before him soon .
__label__1	<NAME> perhaps , but so it is ! ''
__label__1	In the course of a couple of hours the noble Refrigerator , at no time less than a hundred years behind the period , got about five centuries in arrears , and delivered solemn political oracles appropriate to that epoch .
__label__0	When <NAME> rose from the table , all followed her example , and seated themselves at the door of the cottage .
__label__1	`` <NAME> , will you allow me ?
__label__1	‘ My country rounds , ’ she added at length , ‘ brought me to <NAME> , <NAME> , the night before last .
__label__1	I couldn ’ t , <NAME> ! ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	It was there that <NAME> had disappeared .
__label__0	The <NAME> Crown exercises a real and despotic dominion over the larger portion of this vast country , and has a governor-general stationed at <NAME> , governors at <NAME> , <NAME> , and in <NAME> , and a lieutenant-governor at <NAME> .
__label__1	She shaded it , after this change , with her hands ; and when she arose , and with an affectionate embrace bade <NAME> good-night , went quickly , and without looking round .
__label__1	'Oh , he wo n't speak out , wo n't he ? '
__label__1	These articles having been promptly supplied , he walked on direct towards Leadenhall <NAME> at a good round pace , very different from his recent lingering one .
__label__0	Thus they die in the open air ; and at the end of ten days they are in a forward state of decomposition .
__label__1	Probably to assure herself that it is not the assent of a mere automaton , she reverses the form of her next sentence .
__label__1	Upon my word and honour , <NAME> , I don ’ t know anything more about it .
__label__1	‘ Hear , hear , ’ assented <NAME> ’ s client .
__label__1	`` And it sounds -- somehow it sounds , '' said <NAME> , `` like a small sum ? ''
__label__1	‘ I remember its making you very uneasy , indeed. ’ ‘ Ecod , you see <NAME> has a sharp eye , <NAME> ! ’ cried Mr Boffin , shaking his head with an admiring air .
__label__0	<NAME> is my uncle 's determination .
__label__0	The way the natives treated them would answer that question .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> grasped the undertaker by the arm , and led him into the building .
__label__1	It was a picturesque old house in a fine park richly wooded .
__label__0	These animals are so fierce that they rushed into the water to attack <NAME> 's sailors .
__label__0	I did not utter a word until the captain 's emotion had subsided .
__label__0	The sledge , shortening this route , took a chord of the arc described by the railway .
__label__0	He knows us too well for that .
__label__0	Then , by dint of lashing , throwing stones , and shouting , the animal was urged into a gallop .
__label__1	<NAME> has lighted his lantern , by drawing from the cold , hard wall a spark of that mysterious fire which lurks in everything , and , guided by this speck , they clamber up among the cobwebs and the dust .
__label__1	There 's them that ca n't and that wo n't have <NAME> , -- yes , I know the name ! -- alive in the same land with them , and that 's had such sure information of him when he was alive in another land , as that he could n't and should n't leave it unbeknown and put them in danger .
__label__0	my father is there ! ” And the poor girl started up , and leaning over the side of the yacht , wanted to throw herself into the sea .
__label__1	At last , one afternoon her husband ( to whom she had never , on any persuasion , opened her lips since that night ) , standing at the great south window , saw her drop upon the pavement .
__label__1	But few people noticed her at those times , in the garb she wore : or if they did , believed that she was tutored to excite compassion , and passed on .
__label__0	They made a halt at seven o'clock , the young woman being still in a state of complete prostration .
__label__1	A great white cap , with a quantity of opaque frilling that was always flapping about , apologised for <NAME> ’ s baldness , and made it so very difficult for her old black bonnet to retain its place upon her head , that it held on round her neck like a gipsy ’ s baby .
__label__0	The disc only presented to the travelers ' gaze one half brilliantly lit up , while the other disappeared in the darkness .
__label__1	‘ Little Dorrit , ’ he said , taking her hand again , and speaking lower than he had spoken yet , so that even <NAME> in the small room could not hear him , ‘ another word .
__label__1	I speak for myself , let me add , without including you .
__label__0	asked the engineer , `` for a depth sufficient for the keel of the <NAME> , would not be enough for those of our iron-clads . ''
__label__0	`` It was just because she was not an honest vessel ! ''
__label__1	But he slept out of the house too , at his mother ’ s lodging ; and before I had gone many hundred yards , came up with me .
__label__1	When I had gone down-stairs , I turned back that I might be a little bit more company to him yet , and looked in at the door , and said , “ Father dear , shall I take <NAME> ? ” <NAME> shook his head and said , “ No , <NAME> , no ; take nothing that ’ s known to be mine , my darling ; ” and I left him sitting by the fire .
__label__0	It was only necessary to demolish a piece of wall in order to allow it to flow out in a vast stream .
__label__0	When the disappearance of the five men had been ascertained , we fell into despair .
__label__1	`` If time could be spared , '' said <NAME> , `` which is the only thing that ca n't be spared in this case , I might get it out of that woman ; but it 's too doubtful a chance to trust to under present circumstances .
__label__1	I hope no bereavement has befallen her .
__label__1	He little suspected with whose money .
__label__1	‘ You are so changed , ’ said <NAME> -- ‘ I changed ! ’ she interrupted .
__label__1	‘ What is termed a fine woman ; a splendid woman. ’ ‘ Big nose , no doubt , ’ is the quiet commentary again .
__label__1	It has crept , as if for shelter , into the lintels of the great door -- under it , into the corners of the windows , into every chink and crevice of retreat , and there wastes and dies .
__label__1	Do you not know what is due to guests ?
__label__0	The prisoner remained quiet in the fore-cabin , and as he had been a sailor it appeared that the motion of the vessel might produce on him a salutary reaction .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , ’ said the visitor .
__label__1	Look to your feet , <NAME> , for we shall try your boots .
__label__0	This method , stated roughly , was that followed by <NAME> , and , in our own day , by <NAME> and <NAME> , with extraordinary success . ''
__label__1	Between the room and the men there were strong points of general resemblance .
__label__1	‘ Made to do ? ’ returned the <NAME> , administering more punishment , ‘ what do you take me for ? ’ And was then turned over on its back in <NAME> ’ s lap , and smothered with kisses .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , before whom Mrs General instantly loomed , ‘ no , I thank you .
__label__1	‘ But come , ’ said <NAME> , as if suddenly recollecting himself ; ‘ we must not forget our mission in the pleasure of this interview .
__label__1	It was understood to be a great occasion .
__label__0	I left <NAME> on <NAME> ’ s ship on the 12th of March , 1861 .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> looked at them for some moments , stretched his arms towards them , and , kneeling down , burst into deep sobs .
__label__1	Nothing could be more acceptable to me than the sweet presence of last evening , for all the remaining evenings of my existence ; but these are not fit surroundings for a young lady .
__label__0	And so it happened that on the 29th of December Alcide Pierdeux , “ Ingénieur au <NAME> des <NAME> de <NAME> , ” was hurrying with lengthy strides through the crowded streets of <NAME> .
__label__1	The very feet of the dog were bloody .
__label__1	In short , charity must have its romance , as the novelist or playwright must have his .
__label__0	lat. , and 27 degrees 21 minutes W .
__label__0	<NAME> , founded in 1611 , is situated at the confluence of the <NAME> and the <NAME> , on the right bank of the latter river .
__label__0	The good animal , hidden behind a thicket , had escaped the sight of the <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> ! ’ he thought , suddenly correcting himself , ‘ what a boy I am ! ’ ‘ It is better as it is , ’ said <NAME> , after he had lounged on , a few paces , and returned to the same spot .
__label__1	I have remarked that at those times , and when he is least like himself , he is most certain to be wanted on some business. ’ ‘ By <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	I really could not at first persuade myself as we rumbled heavily on , filling the bridge with hollow noises , and I held down my head to save it from the rafters above , but that I was in a painful dream ; for I have often dreamed of toiling through such places , and as often argued , even at the time , ‘ this can not be reality. ’ At length , however , we emerged upon the streets of <NAME> , whose feeble lights , reflected dismally from the wet ground , did not shine out upon a very cheerful city .
__label__1	The lady stepped lightly aside , and snatching the young man ’ s sword from his hand , before he had recovered his balance , drove him to the wall , and running it through him , and the panelling , up to the very hilt , pinned him there , hard and fast .
__label__1	As she was observed at this time to direct baleful glances towards the <NAME> , it has been supposed that this admirably consistent female intended by ‘ him , ’ <NAME> .
__label__0	At last M'Nicholl opened his eyes , stared at <NAME> for an instant , pressed his hand , looked around searchingly and anxiously , and at last whispered in a faint voice : `` How 's <NAME> ? ''
__label__0	I soon felt that strange and mysterious sensation which is awakened in the mind when looking down from lofty hilltops , and now I was able to do so without any feeling of nervousness , having fortunately hardened myself to that kind of sublime contemplation .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> wants to speak to you .
__label__1	Slowly and thoughtfully , <NAME> ’ s eyes turned from the door by which <NAME> had gone out , to <NAME> , rising from the carpet .
__label__1	As often as he began to consider how to increase this inheritance , or to lay it by , so often his misgiving that there was some one with an unsatisfied claim upon his justice , returned ; and that alone was a subject to outlast the longest walk .
__label__0	Then the overmen of the different pits came forward to shake hands with him , whilst the miners waved their caps , shouting , “ Farewell , <NAME> , our master and our friend ! ” This farewell would leave a lasting remembrance in all these honest hearts .
__label__1	I thought I had read in his face that he would like to speak to me alone .
__label__1	'Especially , when the exclusive young man has got a friend stopping with him , that 's arrived sooner than was expected from foreign parts , and is too modest to want to be presented to the <NAME> on his return , ' added <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> , <NAME> ! ’ As the ruin of <NAME> tottered off whimpering , and wiping its eyes with a gingerly remembrance of rouge in their neighbourhood , the old woman hobbled another way , mumbling and counting her money .
__label__0	So saying , he extended his hand to the <NAME> , who kissed it ; for there is nothing servile in this act of respect , it being usual among the <NAME> races .
__label__1	‘ I say I wonder <NAME> didn ’ t take you with him , dear. ’ ‘ Never you mind , <NAME> , ’ returned the <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> knew these fruits well .
__label__0	I must go. ” <NAME> approached <NAME> ; then , having looked at him , -- “ Let us go , then ! ” said he .
__label__0	Having made his calculations , <NAME> found that he would at most be able to keep them alive till the time for departure , by putting each and all on half rations .
__label__1	And sometimes she would entreat her , with humility , to sit down on the chair beside her bed , and would look at her ( as she sat there brooding ) with a face that even the rose-coloured curtains could not make otherwise than scared and wild .
__label__1	You speak as if he had threatened you in some dark way. ’ ‘ He has never spoken to me about—that .
__label__1	<NAME> kind for once , and sing us an <NAME> song. ’ ‘ What do you care for an <NAME> song ? ’ she returned .
__label__0	Who could tell whether a fratricidal struggle might not ensue ?
__label__1	A happy New Year to all the world .
__label__1	And so shall somebody else too .
__label__1	Thus he staggered on , creeping , almost mechanically , between the bars of gates , or through hedge-gaps as they came in his way , until he reached a road .
__label__1	Little <NAME> is waiting for the coroner and jury on their return .
__label__1	I have looked it in the face , in my different way ; look it in the face , you , in your different way .
__label__1	I have come to ask if you would let me stay with you ? ’ ‘ Why should you stay with me ?
__label__0	So the sailors were accustomed to climb into the chimney , whence , as from a watch-tower they could shoot the animals and drive them off .
__label__1	‘ The day had broken when <NAME> awoke , and found himself lying at full length on the flat gravestone in the churchyard , with the wicker bottle lying empty by his side , and his coat , spade , and lantern , all well whitened by the last night ’ s frost , scattered on the ground .
__label__1	Come on , and have it out in plain words !
__label__1	On the other hand , the question was , not what he thought of the point , but what she thought of it .
__label__0	He commenced operations by killing the fish with a bite near the gills , and proceeded to devour it , beginning at the head and finishing at the tail , without rejecting the bones , fins , scales , or entrails .
__label__0	`` I can not say , <NAME> , '' said the engineer .
__label__0	Now-a-days they are better known by the native name of <NAME> .
__label__1	He promptly says again , `` Have the goodness to hear me , <NAME> , '' and motions to the chair from which she has risen .
__label__1	I brought it with me to send from these parts , as <NAME> might be a painful name just now to the person it 's written to .
__label__1	She made no reply , but still pressed forward .
__label__1	To put before you any appeal to reconsider your purpose or to set narrow limits to it , would be , I feel , not less so .
__label__0	He was also included amongst the most active members of the <NAME> ; and the <NAME> frequently published clever articles signed by him .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> ’ at all , <NAME> , ’ replied his attendant .
__label__0	The <NAME> Government had just passed a law prohibiting the introduction of furs into the ports of the empire under most severe penalties .
__label__1	I sat down and said after a little effort to be as calm as I ought to be , `` One of my earliest remembrances , guardian , is of these words : 'Your mother , <NAME> , is your disgrace , and you were hers .
__label__1	We have never been readers in our family .
__label__0	“ No matter ? ” cried <NAME> , tearing his hair ; “ I ought not to have forgotten its double appellation .
__label__0	There was nothing more to be done but for each to take his place before the fog should be completely dissipated .
__label__0	But to the great surprise of the natives and the stupefaction of <NAME> , the captain refused .
__label__1	The grass was long ; but it was trodden down nowhere , save where their own feet had crushed it .
__label__1	He was down once , but they made a ring round him , and fought their way along .
__label__0	`` Where are we , where are we ? ''
__label__0	A strong buoy , strengthened by a couple of spars , was thrown into the ocean .
__label__0	It is thought that he went to <NAME> and to <NAME> , where his projects of transoceanic navigation were but badly received .
__label__0	But he could not make himself heard ; he dared not , could not make his friends even see him !
__label__0	It was at once <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , with semicircular doors , Pointed windows , <NAME> rose-windows , fantastic bell-turrets , -- in a word , a specimen of all sorts , half a <NAME> , half a <NAME> Grand Café .
__label__1	The boarders , and the teachers , and the servants , fell back upon the stairs , and upon each other ; and never was such a screaming , and fainting , and struggling beheld .
__label__1	No ; you are strict , you are ; we must wait over twelve o ’ clock , and get into Monday .
__label__1	But as the mahogany philosopher gave no evidence of being sentient of anything but warmth and tobacco , except once , when taking his pipe from his lips to make room for his glass , he incidentally remarked with exceeding gruffness , that his name was <NAME> -- a declaration that presented but small opening for conversation -- the Captain bespeaking his attention in a short complimentary exordium , narrated the whole history of <NAME> ’ s departure , with the change it had produced in his own life and fortunes ; and concluded by placing the packet on the table .
__label__0	His eldest son <NAME> , whose mother was descended from the incas , had the remainder of his states .
__label__1	Nothing doubting now that the stranger , if not Mr Ketch in person , was one of that company , the whole of the young family wailed the louder , while its more infantine members , unable to control the transports of emotion appertaining to their time of life , threw themselves on their backs like young birds when terrified by a hawk , and kicked violently .
__label__0	At length one man took off his breeches , tying them together by the ends , and having put the eggs into them , they carried them on a pike between two , while the third man carried the musket .
__label__1	However , as it must be done , I went down , after two or three false starts half-way , and as many runs back on tiptoe to my own room , and presented myself in the parlour .
__label__1	<NAME> , compelling the attendance of the waitress with one hitch of his eyelash , instantly replies as follows : `` Four veals and hams is three , and four potatoes is three and four , and one summer cabbage is three and six , and three marrows is four and six , and six breads is five , and three Cheshires is five and three , and four half-pints of half-and-half is six and three , and four small rums is eight and three , and three Pollys is eight and six .
__label__0	`` But Mr <NAME> and <NAME> ? ''
__label__1	That gentleman has lost his senses , and I am the unhappy cause. ’ ‘ YOU the cause ! ’ said <NAME> , greatly astonished .
__label__0	A few sailing-vessels , on the road to <NAME> , were making for the Cape of <NAME> .
__label__1	He washed , and was cured .
__label__1	If that house has failed , and he the first to bring the news ! -- Is the coach there ? ’ ‘ Yes , yes , ’ said <NAME> , startled by the fierce tone of the inquiry .
__label__0	`` The women sent their servants to find large pieces of their finest stuffs , tinted scarlet , rose , and straw colour , and perfumed with the most odoriferous oil .
__label__0	It was , perhaps , only natural that this clustered mass of birds , as representing the whole of the feathered tribe upon the surface of <NAME> , should resort to <NAME> , of which the meadows seemed to be the only spot from which they could get sustenance at all ; but as this sustenance would be obtained at the expense , and probably to the serious detriment , of the human population , it was absolutely necessary that every possible resistance should be made to the devastation that was threatened .
__label__1	'Only think , ' said <NAME> , shrugging his shoulders , and stretching out his hands ; 'only consider .
__label__0	The southern coast of the island still remained to be explored .
__label__0	It happened at last that the old man , abashed by these reproaches , took some pieces of gold from his old trunk , and began to buy back the damaged watches .
__label__1	These young ladies -- not supposed to have been actually christened by the names applied to them , though always so called in the family from the places of their birth in barracks -- are respectively employed on three-legged stools , the younger ( some five or six years old ) in learning her letters out of a penny primer , the elder ( eight or nine perhaps ) in teaching her and sewing with great assiduity .
__label__1	Does the old man look like a long-liver ? ’ ‘ He don ’ t look like it , ’ said <NAME> shaking his head , ‘ but these old people -- there ’ s no trusting them , <NAME> .
__label__0	`` Permit me , '' he continued , `` to recount to you briefly how certain ardent spirits , starting on imaginary journeys , have penetrated the secrets of our satellite .
__label__0	229 Portrait of <NAME> .
__label__1	Mrs <NAME> and <NAME> were driven to their own lodgings ; Mr <NAME> was graciously invited by <NAME> to return thither with Mr Dombey and the Major , in the evening , to hear some of <NAME> ’ s music ; and the three gentlemen repaired to their hotel to dinner .
__label__0	Their chief is a hundred paces ahead of them and they are rushing after him at headlong speed. ” “ Whoever they may be , <NAME> , they are not to be feared , and then , if necessary , we can go higher. ” “ Wait , doctor -- wait a little ! ” “ It ’ s curious , ” said <NAME> again , after a brief pause , “ but there ’ s something going on that I can ’ t exactly explain .
__label__1	We all sat round the fire ; while the sharp boy , who I now divined had lost his breath in putting the papers out , cleared them away again , and produced the tea-things .
__label__1	“ We really have not heads enough ; it would be a pity , I think. ” “ He was signalling with her when I saw her , ” argued <NAME> ; “ I can not speak of one without the other ; and I must not be silent , and trust the case wholly to him , this little citizen here .
__label__1	<NAME> said the <NAME> had a secret ?
__label__1	cried the new comer , breathless with haste .
__label__1	“ Are you <NAME> ? ” ‘ “ Yes , sir. ” ‘ “ Then I have to tell you that you are a— ” ( applying an appropriate epithet ) .
__label__0	<NAME> first crossed the <NAME> districts already explored by <NAME> , where he met with vast herds of zebras , antelopes , and ostriches , arriving in due course at <NAME> , where he bought some oxen , a cart , and a cock -- the last serving as an alarm-clock throughout the journey .
__label__1	But I was softened by the softened aspect of the man , and felt a touch of reproach .
__label__0	The three settlers were talking in <NAME> 's room , when they heard <NAME> utter quick barks .
__label__0	Stretched on the benches , they inhaled with delight the slight breeze caused by the speed of the steamer .
__label__1	And tell her that before she marries my boy , I ’ ll come and make your house so beautiful for you , if you ’ ll let me ! ’ I declared that nobody else should touch it ; and this gave <NAME> such delight that she went away in good spirits .
__label__0	It did not take more than a few days to perform this work , and indeed as soon as the machine had been commenced , <NAME> left his companions to follow the trade of wire-drawers , and occupied himself with manufacturing his battery .
__label__0	<NAME> was accompanied by <NAME> , a <NAME> ; they set out on the 6th of April , 1245 , and went first to <NAME> , where the king gave them letters to some relations living in <NAME> , who he hoped might facilitate their entrance into <NAME> .
__label__0	It seemed as if the returning was to be accomplished as easily as the going , when an unexpected accident occurred which rendered the situation of the explorers very serious .
__label__1	She had been saying all the while , `` Let me go ! ''
__label__0	As to flint , that would not be wanting in these regions of <NAME> origin .
__label__1	It was the poor schoolmaster .
__label__0	You have all passed it , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , destined never to return home ; and for you this cape was well named <NAME> ! ''
__label__1	Some remembrance of old Valentines , wherein a cherub , less appropriately attired for a proverbially uncertain climate , had been seen conducting lovers to the altar , might have been fancied to inflame the ardour of his timber toes .
__label__0	All three felt this , and they well knew that <NAME> would approve of their acting thus .
__label__0	The strangers gave them iron and glass wares , on which they set no store ; but one of them , having succeeded in possessing himself secretly of <NAME> 's cutlass , the others recommenced their hostile demonstrations , and it was necessary to fire at the robber , who was hit , when they all threw themselves into the river to gain the opposite shore .
__label__1	`` I felt it a good deal at first .
__label__0	One morning -- it was the 27th of August -- I was roused out of my bed by the rough voice of the innkeeper and the tremendous thumps he gave my door .
__label__1	My child is always dangerous , more or less .
__label__0	Be silent , and farewell ! ” It must be admitted that <NAME> ’ s fears were far from groundless .
__label__0	<NAME> , have you seen the coal-bunkers lately ? ''
__label__0	`` Soon , however , he saw breakers ahead of his boat , and found himself in the open sea .
__label__1	Not <NAME> our Manager , <NAME> -- the other <NAME> ; the <NAME> -- <NAME> !
__label__1	I can not bear to think of what did come , upon that memorable night ; of what must come again , if I go on .
__label__1	And so quick were my thoughts , that I saw myself despised by unborn generations , -- <NAME> 's children , and their children , -- while the wretch 's words were yet on his lips .
__label__1	You inquire , on board a steamboat , of a fellow-passenger , whether breakfast will be ready soon , and he tells you he should think so , for when he was last below , they were ‘ fixing the tables : ’ in other words , laying the cloth .
__label__1	`` Well , and how are you ? ''
__label__0	<NAME> and shoes went whirling through the air , and <NAME> thought he even heard the crack of revolvers mingling in the din , the rout approached the stairway , and flowed over the lower step .
__label__0	In the case of the <NAME> , it would be the road that ran along .
__label__0	We have a tendency to sink , and , in order to keep our elevation , I am compelled to give greater dilation to the hydrogen. ” “ The deuce ! ” exclaimed <NAME> with concern ; “ I see no remedy for that. ” “ There is none , <NAME> , and that is why we must hasten our progress , and even avoid night halts. ” “ Are we still far from the coast ? ” asked <NAME> .
__label__0	Few can possibly have forgotten the terrible storm from the northeast , in the middle of the equinox of that year .
__label__0	<NAME> and <NAME> started for <NAME> , a large Fellatah town on the west of <NAME> , on the 14th of December , 1823 , followed the <NAME> as far as <NAME> , and visited the ruins of <NAME> , and those of <NAME> , on the shores of a lake formed by the overflowing of the <NAME> , <NAME> and <NAME> , all towns of <NAME> .
__label__0	The difficulties will not increase , for , on our way thither , we leave behind us the coldest spots on the globe .
__label__1	‘ Yes , I know I am wrong , ’ she pleaded timidly , ‘ don ’ t think any worse of me ; it has grown up with me here. ’ The prison , which could spoil so many things , had tainted <NAME> ’ s mind no more than this .
__label__0	Perhaps some day we may have the honor of being registered among the minor planets. ” “ No chance of that , ” quickly rejoined <NAME> .
__label__0	They had to dispatch the fellow with rifles .
__label__1	In his sullen and unwholesome brooding , the unhappy man , with a dull perception of his alienation from all hearts , and a vague yearning for what he had all his life repelled , made a distorted picture of his rights and wrongs , and justified himself with it against her .
__label__0	When a rich man had no sons , he came to the king and asked of him some of his wards , who were immediately given to him .
__label__0	If we addressed them they replied , but if we continued our way seldom joined us in our excursions .
__label__1	So with every lithe action of the girl , with every turn of her wrist , perhaps most of all with her look of dread or horror ; they were things of usage .
__label__1	In one of its chambers , so repulsive a place that even the obtrusive stare blinked at it , and left it to such refuse of reflected light as it could find for itself , were two men .
__label__0	The rectilinear movement has thus become changed into a circular motion of extreme velocity , and it is now pursuing an elliptical orbit round the moon , of which it has become a true satellite .
__label__1	All his widowed mother could spare had been spent in qualifying him for his profession .
__label__0	“ Yes , <NAME> , 79,625. ” “ And how many sheep ? ” “ Including the one we are eating at this moment. ” “ No , without counting that , since it is three parts devoured. ” “ <NAME> , <NAME> , ” exclaimed <NAME> , laughing heartily .
__label__1	“ Now , would it not be better that he should let it go ? ” Still , the <NAME> , with shaded forehead , beat his foot nervously on the ground .
__label__1	But no such day had ever dawned on Mr Dombey , or his wife ; and the course of each was taken .
__label__0	After the chief men of a warlike and fierce appearance , with faces tattooed all over , had been a few minutes on board , D'Urville was preparing to ask them some questions , with the aid of a vocabulary published by the missionaries , when all at once they turned away from him , leaped into their canoes and pushed out into the open sea .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> was right ; we were close to a vessel of which the tattered shrouds still hung from their chains .
__label__1	But , there was no loud irruption into the courtyard , as he had expected , and he heard the gate clash again , and all was quiet .
__label__1	She resumed her seat , and had scarcely done so , when the doubtful page darted into the room and announced , <NAME> , and <NAME> , and <NAME> , and <NAME> , all at one burst .
__label__0	This time when the major rose he found himself with neither horse nor weapons ; and the next moment he was surrounded by enemies , who stripped him and wounded him in both hands and the right side , leaving him half dead at last to fight over his clothes , which seemed to them of great value .
__label__0	“ Whatever it is , in another hour we shall know all about it , ” said <NAME> .
__label__0	`` M. <NAME> and M. Auribeau , '' says the narrative , `` were encouraged to land by the sight of fires close to the shore .
__label__1	`` He comes here every evening , '' returned <NAME> , `` and is so fond of sitting in the corner there that it 's a treat to see him . ''
__label__0	How wonderfully had the field increased in extent , since eighteen months ago , when the first grain of wheat was sown !
__label__0	cried at this moment one of the men at the forewheel , who was superintending the operation .
__label__0	`` The Government is very severe upon that kind of offence .
__label__0	And we used to think him as useless as a rotten keel ! ''
__label__1	I took the child to one kept by a man named <NAME> , and left it there .
__label__1	Two half-quartern brans ; pound of best fresh ; piece of double Glo'ster ; and , to wind up all , some of the richest sort you ever lushed ! '
__label__1	But , when she suffered it to break loose , it was only for a moment .
__label__1	It then occurred to me as possible that the man might have slipped into my rooms ; so , lighting my candle at the watchman 's , and leaving him standing at the door , I examined them carefully , including the room in which my dreaded guest lay asleep .
__label__0	`` However that may be , '' replied <NAME> , `` let us go forward , or we shall be frozen . ''
__label__1	He is wretched , I have no doubt ; but he is nothing to me .
__label__1	' I have taken the measure of the two women that died last night , <NAME> , ' said the undertaker .
__label__0	They were severe , and the average observations of the thermometer did not give more than eight degrees of <NAME> .
__label__0	The doctor had carefully taken his position by the altitude of the stars , during the preceding night .
__label__1	<NAME> knew nothing about such questions , but he knew that his old home was a very poor place , and that his new one was very unlike it , and yet he was constantly looking back with grateful satisfaction and affectionate anxiety , and often indited square-folded letters to his mother , enclosing a shilling or eighteenpence or such other small remittance , which Mr Abel ’ s liberality enabled him to make .
__label__1	For it was a reg ’ lar good secret , that was ! ’ cried <NAME> , hugging herself .
__label__0	`` He breathes though , '' said <NAME> , putting his ear to the chest of the wounded man .
__label__0	On October 24th there was an earthquake of such violence that the governor , troops , and a portion of the people were compelled hastily to leave the town , and the loss was estimated at 120,000_l_ .
__label__0	<NAME> 's desire to find land at the <NAME> is perfectly comprehensible .
__label__1	Second : them poor things well out o ' this , and never no more will I interfere with Mrs. Cruncher 's flopping , never no more ! ” “ Whatever housekeeping arrangement that may be , ” said <NAME> , striving to dry her eyes and compose herself , “ I have no doubt it is best that Mrs. Cruncher should have it entirely under her own superintendence. -- O my poor darlings ! ” “ I go so far as to say , miss , moreover , ” proceeded <NAME> , with a most alarming tendency to hold forth as from a pulpit -- “ and let my words be took down and took to Mrs. Cruncher through yourself -- that wot my opinions respectin ' flopping has undergone a change , and that wot I only hope with all my heart as Mrs. Cruncher may be a flopping at the present time. ” “ There , there , there !
__label__1	On all the suspicious points , the dead man ’ s brother was the witness : all the explanations for the prisoner ( some of them extremely plausible ) went , by construction and inference , to inculcate him as plotting to fix the guilt upon his nephew .
__label__0	`` Then , '' added <NAME> , `` we can clear the plateau , and transplant wild plants to it . ''
__label__0	At this place the wall appeared to have been separated by some violent subterranean force .
__label__1	In their orderly and punctual progress they brought round <NAME> and twilight .
__label__1	The rooks were sailing about the cathedral towers ; and the towers themselves , overlooking many a long unaltered mile of the rich country and its pleasant streams , were cutting the bright morning air , as if there were no such thing as change on earth .
__label__0	A few of the aborigines , however , make themselves cloaks of opossum or kangaroo skin , stitching the pieces together with the nerve-fibres of the cassowary ; but this kind of garment is of rare occurrence .
__label__1	She had laughed and welcomed them , and made far too much of the dog , far , far , too much -- that is to say , supposing there had been any third person looking on who loved her .
__label__1	‘ Mr Wegg , ’ said <NAME> , with another flush .
__label__0	The temperature had risen , the thermometer standing at 25° above zero .
__label__1	There was one dim unformed fear lingering about his sister ’ s mind , to which she never gave utterance , which surrounded the graceless and ungrateful boy with a dreadful mystery .
__label__1	‘ If you please , partner , ’ said <NAME> , rubbing his hands .
__label__1	Lastly , from her pocket , and from the chimney-piece , and from an inverted basin on the highest shelf she brought halfpence , a few sixpences , fewer shillings , and fell to laboriously and noiselessly counting them , and setting aside one little heap .
__label__0	A second edition , illustrated with engravings which were meritorious rather from their fidelity to nature than their artistic merit , was issued in 1705 , and in 1785 the remaining copies of this issue were collected , and appeared under a new title .
__label__0	I must consider how to leave this country of the <NAME> , of which I shall not retain the most delightful of memories , as quickly as possible . ''
__label__1	laughed <NAME> , 'what a lark that would be , would n't it , <NAME> ?
__label__0	Corresponding to this in the southern hemisphere lies the <NAME> , or <NAME> , whose surface , as it extends along the western rim , is rather difficult to calculate .
__label__1	But , he had never seen his friend in his present aspect : he had never at all known him in his present character .
__label__1	What if his mother had an old reason she well knew for softening to this poor girl !
__label__0	Thus everything had become calm again ; the old existence had been resumed by men and beasts , beasts and plants ; even by the tower of <NAME> gate , which the explosion -- these explosions are sometimes astonishing -- had set upright again !
__label__1	‘ But I am in the humour , and I must be humoured , <NAME> , because after all I am a poor little thing , and have had a hard day with my bad child .
__label__1	‘ It ’ s below stairs , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , and he ran down after it .
__label__1	It being now the afternoon in the—College—of which you are the eminent head , the young ladies might gain nothing , except in name , by having the rest of the day allowed them .
__label__1	At last , when we had passed a couple of hours or so , very agreeably , he suddenly took up his hat , and leaning over the table and looking me full in the face , said , in a low voice : “ <NAME> , <NAME> , we ’ ve been vara pleasant toogather , and ar ’ ll spak ’ my moind tiv ’ ee .
__label__1	Our Dear Brother A touch on the lawyer 's wrinkled hand as he stands in the dark room , irresolute , makes him start and say , `` What 's that ? ''
__label__0	Neither <NAME> nor <NAME> cared to attend .
__label__1	'It 's a nasty trade , ' said <NAME> , when <NAME> had again stated his wish .
__label__0	As soon as <NAME> , who went before me , could comprehend what was passing , he stopped , and after exchanging ' some words in _patois_ with his comrades , declared that we must detach ourselves from M. N -- -- 's party .
__label__1	I may not dwell on all he did , to make the poor , weak creature love him , or my tale would have no end .
__label__1	<NAME> Mr and <NAME> , beaming !
__label__0	I exclaimed , unable to repress a gesture of incredulity .
__label__1	They went a little apart from the knot of people who had congregated about the coach , and fell upon each other ’ s neck , and sobbed , and wept with joy .
__label__0	`` But how have they endeavored to explain these lines of light ? ''
__label__1	`` I covet nothing , '' said <NAME> in the same light way .
__label__0	The mujik and <NAME> resumed their way and arrived at the posting-house .
__label__0	From this communication it appeared that two <NAME> captains , from <NAME> , had stated that <NAME> , in command of the <NAME> frigate <NAME> , had seen , `` near the <NAME> , in the <NAME> , men dressed in the <NAME> style , and in what he took to be <NAME> uniforms . ''
__label__1	I am rough , sir , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ I am as rough as a <NAME> ; but no one , unless , mayhap , it is a woman , can know , I think , what our little Em ’ ly is to me .
__label__1	‘ Things come about very strangely ! ’ thought <NAME> , as he walked home .
__label__1	The call being repeated , <NAME> looked out again , so cautiously that no part of the old man ’ s body was visible .
__label__0	But the view was intercepted by yet higher mountains .
__label__0	So the day passed , and night came on , calm and peaceful as the preceding had been .
__label__1	But under this difficulty , as under all the other difficulties of my journey , I seemed to be sustained and led on by my fanciful picture of my mother in her youth , before I came into the world .
__label__1	Indeed ! ’ ‘ Yes , ’ pursued my aunt , ‘ and he has done a pretty piece of business .
__label__0	A quarter of an hour later we were far away from that terrible monster !
__label__1	‘ Ah , to be sure ! ’ returned the Patriarch .
__label__1	It was natural that , in the midst of her affliction , she should often revert to that sweet young lady of whom she had only caught a hasty glance , but whose sympathy , expressed in one slight brief action , dwelt in her memory like the kindnesses of years .
__label__1	The daily visits I could make him were shortened now , and he was more strictly kept .
__label__1	<NAME> would come , however , in spite of her , when the carrier ’ s horse pleased -- and did .
__label__0	`` Well , if we give up the great theory of the central heat of the earth , I certainly can offer no reasons why anything should be looked upon as impossible . ''
__label__1	I have said so to Venus. ’ ‘ You certainly have , sir , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ My darling child , ’ cried <NAME> , languidly , ‘ you are not nervous ?
__label__1	On this occasion , <NAME> , responding to <NAME> 's pleasant face and pleasant efforts to please her , unbent exceedingly ; so the dinner was very pleasant , too .
__label__0	“ No , ” thought he , “ no unguarded proceedings .
__label__0	So I shall not be in the least surprised to see him coming out of his cabin some fine morning and taking command in the least supernatural way in the world . ''
__label__1	He also wrote a pamphlet , addressed to the seventeen learned societies , native and foreign , containing a repetition of the statement he had already made , and rather more than half intimating his opinion that the seventeen learned societies were so many ‘ humbugs. ’ Hereupon , the virtuous indignation of the seventeen learned societies being roused , several fresh pamphlets appeared ; the foreign learned societies corresponded with the native learned societies ; the native learned societies translated the pamphlets of the foreign learned societies into <NAME> ; the foreign learned societies translated the pamphlets of the native learned societies into all sorts of languages ; and thus commenced that celebrated scientific discussion so well known to all men , as the <NAME> controversy .
__label__0	Whatever might be our ultimate decision , we could not do better than place our material and install ourselves in this opportune shelter .
__label__0	<NAME> had been warned by the Tlascalans that he must place no trust in the protestations of friendship and devotion made by the Cholulans .
__label__0	These penguins are the real inhabitants of these dismal solitudes , and nature could not have created a type more suited to the desolation of the glacial zone .
__label__0	`` We shall see , stupid beast ! ''

__label__1	‘ If you want to cheek us , pay your ochre at the doors and take it out. ’ ‘ Kidderminster , ’ said <NAME> , raising his voice , ‘ stow that ! —Sir , ’ to <NAME> , ‘ I was addressing myself to you .
__label__0	<NAME> is the termination of a long range of volcanic mountains , of a different character to the system of the island itself .
__label__0	Thus perished the illustrious <NAME> on the 27th of April , 1521 .
__label__1	He lets him take the newspaper up to him in bed ; he gives him the crusts of his toast to eat ; he sends him on little errands about the house ; he tells him to come to me for sixpences .
__label__1	‘ Here ’ s your health , <NAME> , and may you speedily vipe off the disgrace as you ’ ve inflicted on the family name. ’ In honour of this toast <NAME> imbibed at a draught , at least two-thirds of a newly-arrived pint , and handed it over to his son , to dispose of the remainder , which he instantaneously did .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> ’ t fear me being any hindrance to you , I have no more to say , ma ’ am , ’ he remarked , as he moved towards the door .
__label__0	This settled , they set out in the morning .
__label__0	“ Come along , ” said <NAME> , so as to get his sister out of her embarrassment ; “ if we walk on we shall not talk so much. ” “ One moment , brother , ” she said .
__label__0	The supper must necessarily be very meager .
__label__1	And how am I to set about it ?
__label__1	There young <NAME> was , at any rate ; possessed of the gruffest of voices and the shrillest of minds ; sticking ornamental pins into his shirt , and keeping a ring in his waistcoat pocket to put on his little finger by stealth , when the pupils went out walking ; constantly falling in love by sight with nurserymaids , who had no idea of his existence ; and looking at the gas-lighted world over the little iron bars in the left-hand corner window of the front three pairs of stairs , after bed-time , like a greatly overgrown cherub who had sat up aloft much too long .
__label__0	But the balloon did not budge .
__label__0	Now , on the 17th of this month of October , towards three o ’ clock in the afternoon , <NAME> , enticed by the charms of the sky , thought of reproducing <NAME> , which was opposite to <NAME> , from <NAME> to <NAME> .
__label__1	“ <NAME> ? ” “ Something that crossed me ? ” “ I am conscious of nothing ; there can be nothing here .
__label__0	he exclaimed , `` it 's a fearful staircase ! ''
__label__0	replied <NAME> , who spent the next two hours pacing backward and forward on the quarter deck , watching the hauling in of the sounding line , and occasionally casting a glance towards all quarters of the sky .
__label__1	'As you like , my dear , as you like ' replied the Jew .
__label__1	Evening had come on when I lifted up my eyes and saw my guardian standing in the little hall .
__label__1	<NAME> has been done , to which you were morally if not really a party . '
__label__0	The captain-general being one of the latter nation , had never , according to them , tendered a whole-hearted allegiance to the <NAME> flag .
__label__1	he said , speaking in a homely , rustic way and with great vehemence .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> eyed the old man with great curiosity , and the remainder of the company smiled , and looked on in silence .
__label__0	It may be so ; but nothing can be less certain .
__label__1	If you ask me , <NAME> , whether from the first I believed <NAME> to be the murderer , I tell you candidly no , but he might be , notwithstanding , and there was enough against him to make it my duty to take him and get him kept under remand .
__label__1	Stamp them into the dust ; so that you take me , were it even mortally hating me ! ’ The frightful vehemence of the man , now reaching its full height , so additionally terrifies her as to break the spell that has held her to the spot .
__label__0	At first , accustomed to the open air , to the unrestrained liberty which he had enjoyed on <NAME> , the stranger manifested a sullen fury , and it was feared that he might throw himself onto the beach , out of one of the windows of <NAME> .
__label__0	`` A chain , <NAME> , whose first link , so far as we are concerned , is <NAME> 's ice-block , and whose last will be <NAME> .
__label__1	Nothing of any kind was missing .
__label__1	<NAME> and hours , days and nights , he remained in this same condition .
__label__0	`` I do not know , '' he replied .
__label__0	[ Illustration : Map of <NAME> 's discoveries , after <NAME> . ]
__label__1	<NAME> , poor me , poor me , my poor hand shakes like to drop off !
__label__0	After spending six months in this fruitless search , he was tired of playing the dupe , so giving up the business he returned to <NAME> on the 5th of October , leaving <NAME> de <NAME> and the pilot <NAME> de Alaminos to continue the search .
__label__1	‘ All right , ’ was the reply .
__label__1	'It 's a break-up of the system altogether .
__label__1	‘ The tiny woman ? ’ ‘ Ah ! ’ ‘ I don ’ t know , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	' I beg your pardon , ' said the <NAME> , looking up with an air of abstraction .
__label__1	Thus speaking , he leaned over , as if to replace her in her chair ; but the young lady , making a violent effort to disengage herself , he lost his balance , and measured his length upon the ground .
__label__0	And yet , what remained of the long journey of four thousand miles for the <NAME> ’ s courier to reach his end ?
__label__0	At last <NAME> sent forward one of the ship 's boats , under command of <NAME> , to seek the intrepid explorer .
__label__1	ha ! ’ laughed the old gentleman , rubbing his hands and wrists as if he were washing them .
__label__1	‘ Well , <NAME> , sir , ’ said brother <NAME> , who was always spokesman , ‘ now the young folks are happy , sir. ’ ‘ You didn ’ t keep ‘ em in suspense as long as you said you would , though , ’ returned <NAME> , archly .
__label__1	The completeness of his sympathy with her fancy for having a little <NAME> to protect and rear , he had shown in every act and word , and now that the kind fancy was disappointed , he treated it with a manly tenderness and respect for which she could hardly thank him enough .
__label__1	‘ It ’ s no use knocking , coachman .
__label__1	Then little Mrs. <NAME> proposed as a toast , ‘ Success to <NAME> agin <NAME> ’ ; and then the ladies emptied their glasses in honour of the sentiment , and got very talkative directly .
__label__1	`` Your mind will be all the better for not running on one point too continually , and I 'll tell you for a change .
__label__1	Mr Twemlow returning to his sofa , lays down his aching head on its slippery little horsehair bolster , with a strong internal conviction that a painful interview is not the kind of thing to be taken after the dinner pills which are so highly salutary in connexion with the pleasures of the table .
__label__0	If this was the case , it would be easy for the <NAME> to defend <NAME> , and any time gained against an invasion was a step towards repulsing it .
__label__1	They entered the house , the crowd opening right and left to let them pass , and cheering vociferously .
__label__0	“ <NAME> and save his life ! ” “ <NAME> ? ” “ That is for you to discover , ” answered the magistrate , “ and not for me to say. ” ON <NAME> FOLLOWING day , the 30th of <NAME> , <NAME> and <NAME> talked matters over together .
__label__1	This was the result of his day ’ s anxiety , and this was the decision he put in practice when the day closed in .
__label__0	The house , built by order of the <NAME> , and in which she had celebrated the marriage of one of her buffoons in 1740 , was nearly as large as ours ; but in front stood six cannons of ice ; they were often fired without bursting ; there were also mortars to hold sixty-pound shells ; so we could have some formidable artillery ; the bronze is handy , and falls even from heaven .
__label__1	I felt in the same way towards my school companions ; I felt in the same way towards Mrs. Rachael , who was a widow ; and oh , towards her daughter , of whom she was proud , who came to see her once a fortnight !
__label__0	After coasting <NAME> , he discovered several islands or islets in succession , upon which he did not touch .
__label__1	When I awoke , the wind had risen , and the sign of the house ( the Ship ) was creaking and banging about , with noises that startled me .
__label__0	The three miles which remained would take three hours to travel , and to keep to the course of the river it was necessary , above all things , to have a clear outlook .
__label__0	If <NAME> was right , was not <NAME> an ass ?
__label__0	An old gunner with a grey beard -- that I can see now -- with steady eye and grave face , went up to the gun and took a long aim .
__label__0	“ Stop that howling , <NAME> ! ” “ Let him alone , <NAME> .
__label__1	Looking out between the curtains , he espied Mr <NAME> , Mr Abel , the notary , and the single gentleman , gathered round the <NAME> , and talking to her with great earnestness but in very subdued tones -- fearing , no doubt , to disturb him .
__label__0	He was one of the most noticeable members of the <NAME> , though he seemed always to avoid attracting attention ; an enigmatical personage , about whom little was known , except that he was a polished man of the world .
__label__1	‘ Yes , here he is , flesh and blood , flesh and blood. ’ ‘ Vary little flesh , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	Were you one of many children ? ’ He shook his head .
__label__1	<NAME> at parting recapitulated to the old man all that she had said before , and bound him to their compact .
__label__1	`` What does <NAME> mean ? ''
__label__1	Come in , ma ’ am ! ’ then said Mrs. Sparsit , reversing her former word of command .
__label__1	‘ Then I ’ ll tell you wot it is , ’ said <NAME> , after a short meditation , ‘ this is a case for that ‘ ere confidential pal o ’ the <NAME> ’ s .
__label__1	I shall do well enough , and so will my husband .
__label__0	In an instant we were by his side .
__label__1	You don ’ t often meet with such behaviour in young men , and it strikes one more when one does meet with it. ’ ‘ Oh !
__label__1	'It is very inexcusable in him if he stops to play with any other boys , ' said the young lady , smiling .
__label__0	He must then content himself with gaining <NAME> , then the principal colony of the <NAME> in the <NAME> .
__label__0	`` You see , '' I said , after careful measurement , `` that I am not mistaken .
__label__1	Otherwise the staid old house was , as to its cleanliness and order , still just as it had been when I first saw it .
__label__0	But in spite of all , the storm raged with redoubled fury , and even the admiral feared for the result .
__label__1	As he gathers himself up again into an upright position , or into a position as nearly upright as he ever maintains , he is again conscious of being watched by his companion .
__label__1	‘ So much the worse , ’ returned <NAME> ; ‘ for they ’ ll have had all the advantage of the moonlight to get the start of us , and we shall lose it .
__label__1	Put the case that pretty nigh all the children he saw in his daily business life he had reason to look upon as so much spawn , to develop into the fish that were to come to his net , -- to be prosecuted , defended , forsworn , made orphans , bedevilled somehow. ” “ I follow you , sir. ” “ Put the case , <NAME> , that here was one pretty little child out of the heap who could be saved ; whom the father believed dead , and dared make no stir about ; as to whom , over the mother , the legal adviser had this power : “ I know what you did , and how you did it .
__label__1	Stumbled against them. ’ ‘ The people ? ’ ‘ Yes .
__label__0	`` And what do you conclude from this ? ''
__label__1	All that evening , <NAME> had been hunting and searching in byways and corners for the very person who now knocked at his door , while <NAME> had been pursuing the same inquiry in other directions .
__label__1	`` One in-door , and three out .
__label__1	It were the Poison-bottle on table .
__label__1	The very intelligence that shone in her deep blue eye , and was stamped upon her noble head , seemed scarcely of her age , or of the world ; and yet the changing expression of sweetness and good humour , the thousand lights that played about the face , and left no shadow there ; above all , the smile , the cheerful , happy smile , were made for <NAME> , and fireside peace and happiness .
__label__1	At sight of the young lady , <NAME> started and changed colour ; his heart beat violently , and he stood rooted to the spot .
__label__0	This is <NAME> .
__label__1	Containing the Story of the <NAME> ’ s Uncle 50 .
__label__0	A portable organ , an electrical machine , fireworks , and domestic and agricultural implements completed the collection of useful and ornamental presents intended to give the Tahitans an idea of <NAME> civilization .
__label__0	The part of the <NAME> where these people were employed , the very place where <NAME> had met Torres a few years before , was not very far from <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> noticed the first <NAME> .
__label__0	`` This time , '' said the doctor , detaching his harness , `` it 's a cairn , there 's no doubt of that . ''
__label__1	He was pitched out of his gig once , and knocked , head first , against a milestone .
__label__1	‘ Now , sir , what do you want ! ’ said a man with a large white bow at his button-hole , opening the door , and confronting him with a very stoical aspect .
__label__0	They would make their way with their hatchets , and thus lay the first draft of a road which would place <NAME> in communication with the end of the peninsula for a length of from sixteen to seventeen miles .
__label__0	“ The atmosphere of the earth has a height of six thousand fathoms , ” said the doctor ; “ and , with a very large balloon , one might go far .
__label__1	Now I have answered you , answer me .
__label__0	“ Into the house ! ” said <NAME> ; “ make haste ! ” And in truth , as they could not attack them at once , the best thing they could do was to get into shelter without delay .
__label__1	His personal recognition of each successive client was comprised in a nod , and in his settling his hat a little easier on his head with both hands , and then tightening the post-office , and putting his hands in his pockets .
__label__1	Say I am , my child ; say “ yes ” , dear boy , and <NAME> will love you ; and <NAME> ’ s love is a great deal better than mine , <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> , that the exiles would make common cause with the rebels ? ” exclaimed the Czar .
__label__0	As to the wall and buildings of the poultry-yard and the onagers stable , the fire had destroyed all .
__label__1	Do you know that since the change in our fortunes , though I appear to myself to have dreamed more than before , I have always dreamed of myself as very young indeed !
__label__0	During the night of the 8th of December , <NAME> was seized by a more violent delirium .
__label__1	When <NAME> asked him what he thought of the <NAME> , <NAME> said he had thought of that , too , and it was n't a bad idea .
__label__0	Now that I think of the matter calmly , and that I reflect upon it dispassionately ; now that months , years , have passed since this strange and unnatural adventure befell us -- what am I to think , what am I to believe ?
__label__1	“ What is this ? ” cried <NAME> , breathless and confused .
__label__1	Following it at a respectful distance , <NAME> passed into the bed-chamber , where a fire had been sometime lighted , and was burning briskly .
__label__1	There is nobody down here ; and one or two dull lamps upon the steamer ’ s decks are the only signs of life remaining , when our coach has driven away .
__label__1	Here he by no means diminished the impression he had just produced , for he ate hard eggs , shell and all , devoured gigantic prawns with the heads and tails on , chewed tobacco and water-cresses at the same time and with extraordinary greediness , drank boiling tea without winking , bit his fork and spoon till they bent again , and in short performed so many horrifying and uncommon acts that the women were nearly frightened out of their wits , and began to doubt if he were really a human creature .
__label__1	It was not until even the dusty cloud was no longer to be seen , that the gazers dispersed .
__label__1	He has not returned , sir. ’ ‘ No ? ’ said <NAME> , heating some rum in a little saucepan , and watching it to prevent its boiling over .
__label__0	Dr. <NAME> separated from his companions , made an excursion to the town of <NAME> , and rejoined the expedition , which resumed its march on the 12th of December .
__label__1	No shame upon her brow ; no late repentance bending her disdainful neck .
__label__0	The wretch who had betrayed his country now threatened to torture his mother .
__label__1	‘ What do you call this , sir ? ’ demanded the schoolmaster , administering a cut with the cane to expedite the reply .
__label__1	‘ Old lady , ’ said Mr Boffin , ‘ stop that noise !
__label__1	I would n't go free , now , if you was to fall down on your knees and ask me .
__label__0	He would see me , perhaps speak to me .
__label__1	Mrs. <NAME> curtseyed and smiled , and curtseyed again , and remarked , rubbing her hands as she did so , that she hadn ’ t the -- really -- the honour to -- ‘ To know us , ’ said the first gentleman .
__label__1	Dear Mr Clennam , I write to you from my own room at <NAME> , thinking you will be glad to hear from me .
__label__0	They were aware , also , that the mate was a man whom it would not do to vex , for <NAME> had given them to understand that <NAME> would break any man 's head who did not go straight .
__label__1	His being my lawyer , and his being the lawyer of your patron is a coincidence .
__label__1	He had fully convinced himself , notwithstanding , that his own proper share of the <NAME> was three and ninepence a week ; and that in this amount he , as an individual collegian , was swindled by the marshal , regularly every Monday .
__label__0	He is a great deal too indulgent to my little self. ” “ Well , then , dear Minha , ” said <NAME> , “ I shall profit by that permission to remind you -- -- ” “ Of what ? ” “ That you were very busy in the library at the fazenda , and that you promised to make me very learned about everything connected with the <NAME> .
__label__1	I vent all the vay down to the <NAME> o ’ <NAME> , arter you , last night. ’ ‘ Did you see the <NAME> o ’ <NAME> , <NAME> ? ’ inquired <NAME> , with a sigh .
__label__1	‘ Because his brother was a little eccentric -- though he is not half so eccentric as a good many people -- he didn ’ t like to have him visible about his house , and sent him away to some private asylum-place : though he had been left to his particular care by their deceased father , who thought him almost a natural .
__label__0	`` We are going where our <NAME> 's fancy takes us , <NAME> . ''
__label__0	As to the damage caused by the storm in the forest , that could not as yet be ascertained ; they would have to wait till the snowy covering was dissipated .
__label__1	But as he drew nearer and nearer home he forgot it again , and began to think how very dull and solitary the house would be inside .
__label__1	So they remain , quite still and silent : the old woman and her old chair , in the centre the bag and chest upon the shore , without anybody heeding them all eyes fixed upon the boat .
__label__1	He dressed himself `` all in his best , '' and at last got out into the streets .
__label__0	This was a suspension-bridge thrown over some rapids , about a mile from the place where they now were .
__label__1	I think that if we examine our own feelings , we shall find that the pianos , and the circulating libraries , and even the <NAME> Offering , startle us by their novelty , and not by their bearing upon any abstract question of right or wrong .
__label__1	Go at once I must , it stands to reason ; because I can ’ t live without breathing freely ; and I can ’ t breathe freely until <NAME> is out of this Marshalsea .
__label__0	long. , I found a small island , recognised in 1801 by <NAME> , and marked in the ancient <NAME> maps as <NAME> de la <NAME> , the meaning of which is The <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Having counted our funds , and reduced to order a great mass of unintentional confusion in the first place , and of wilful confusion and falsification in the second , we take it to be clear that <NAME> might now wind up his business , and his agency-trust , and exhibit no deficiency or defalcation whatever. ’ ‘ Oh , thank <NAME> ! ’ cried <NAME> , fervently .
__label__1	‘ I ’ ll find him , I warrant you. ’ With which assurance , <NAME> bounced into the dormitory , and , swinging his cane in the air ready for a blow , darted into the corner where the lean body of the drudge was usually stretched at night .
__label__1	‘ When that was gone , sir , ’ resumed <NAME> , ‘ and it did go , though I dribbled it out like so much blood , I had taken Mr Rugg into the secret .
__label__0	One thing was certain : Captain <NAME> had no intention of coming ashore .
__label__1	It was a temperance song ( whirlwinds of cheers ) .
__label__0	A vibration quivered through the atmosphere .
__label__1	‘ But having had the honour of making that gentleman ’ s acquaintance at the hotel at <NAME> , where we and much good company met some time ago , and having had the honour of exchanging company and conversation with that gentleman on several subsequent excursions , I can hear nothing -- no , not even from one of your appearance and station , sir -- detrimental to that gentleman. ’ ‘ You are in no danger , sir , of hearing any such thing from me .
__label__0	Here is the <NAME> document first. ” All that remained of it was the following : 62 _Bri gow sink stra aland skipp Gr that monit of long and ssistance lost_ “ There ’ s not much to be made out of that , ” said the Major , looking disappointed .
__label__1	`` When did he come from <NAME> ? ''
__label__1	'There 's always more or less orange-peel on the pavement in our street ; and I _know_ it 's put there by the surgeon 's boy at the corner .
__label__0	J. T. <NAME> , <NAME> , and the delegates of the <NAME> , were already in their cabins .
__label__0	<NAME> , placed in the apex of the pyramid , would remind you of those marvellous suspensions in the air performed by <NAME> , <NAME> , and a few other first class wizards .
__label__0	Several of the <NAME> pointed out to Cook the chief who had directed the carnage , and urged <NAME> to kill him .
__label__0	“ Ah , this magnificent <NAME> language .
__label__1	I took him to be nearer sixty than fifty , but he was upright , hearty , and robust .
__label__0	“ What can this be ? ” soliloquized the captain .
__label__1	Our own emotions are our recompense .
__label__0	`` Exactly , my observant nephew , '' exclaimed my uncle , elated and delighted , `` and it is quite probable that if we succeed in getting toward the polar regions -- somewhere near the seventy-third degree of latitude , where <NAME> discovered the magnetic pole , we shall behold the needle point directly upward .
__label__0	270 Natives of <NAME> .
__label__1	'You have borne more , and have been , through all , the best and gentlest creature that ever shed happiness on every one she knew , ' said Mrs. Maylie , embracing her tenderly .
__label__1	You do n't mean to set up for a new character with <NAME> after all these years , I hope ? ''
__label__0	This coast was inhabited , and three boats approached the vessels .
__label__1	‘ There is some spell about that boy , ’ said <NAME> , grinding his teeth .
__label__1	‘ Drink of this cup , you ’ ll find there ’ s a spell in its every drop ‘ gainst the ills of mortality .
__label__1	‘ Let us speak for ourselves , sir .
__label__0	“ I , dear <NAME> ! ” “ And what does Mrs. Scorbitt want with me ? ” “ To tell you that there is a storm coming your way. ” “ Well , I can not stop it— ” “ No , but I wanted to ask if you had taken care to shut your window— ” Mrs. <NAME> had hardly ended before a tremendous clap of thunder filled the air .
__label__1	They were immediately admitted into the lodge .
__label__1	After that , I observed that <NAME> and <NAME> , who had hitherto been very distant , entered into a defensive alliance against us , the common enemy , and exchanged a mysterious dialogue across the table for our defeat and overthrow .
__label__1	‘ Of course there is. ’ ‘ Who do you mean ? ’ said <NAME> , in the same mysterious manner .
__label__1	We were shut out that night , and sat at the iron gate , and walked about till morning .
__label__0	And on her part , she seemed to watch over others , and was never easy unless all whom she loved were together in the cottage .
__label__0	<NAME> feeling , you will say .
__label__1	In an arm-chair , with an elbow resting on the table and her head leaning on that hand , sat the strangest lady I have ever seen , or shall ever see .
__label__1	From personal intercourse with accomplished gentlemen connected with publications of this class , I have derived both pleasure and profit .
__label__0	<NAME> sold his wares , and then , worn out by the persecutions of the <NAME> merchants who were his companions , he joined the caravan at <NAME> , intending to traverse the unknown district between that town and <NAME> .
__label__0	After a rest of fifteen days , during which the peace had not been disturbed , <NAME> found all his invalids restored to health .
__label__0	Some cups of the infusion of elder berries , which took the place of coffee , had been served by <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> is not far off , and from <NAME> to <NAME> is only a step . ''
__label__1	And what I was going to say , sir , is , that if I knew him , and I might -- but I don ’ t know him and I must not -- I know that ! -- I would tell him that I shall never any more lie down to sleep without having prayed to <NAME> to bless him and reward him .
__label__0	The <NAME> walked straight to it , and we got on board as the first rays of light whitened the surface of the ocean .
__label__1	‘ Oh , you disgraceful old chap ! ’ The very breathing of the figure was contemptible , as it laboured and rattled in that operation , like a blundering clock .
__label__1	Being compelled to emerge into the main road , his ill fortune brought him at last where a small party of boys , headed by a ferocious young butcher , were lying in wait for any means of pleasurable excitement that might happen .
__label__1	She had hovered for a little while in the near neighbourhood of her abandoned dwelling , and had sold , and knitted and sold , and gone on .
__label__0	If there should be any land , he wanted to be the first to see it .
__label__1	‘ It does , ’ replied the child .
__label__1	And often and often of a night , he used to forget all his troubles in wondering whether the <NAME> would let the lady go on with the story , or would have her head cut off before it was finished. ’ ‘ And your father was always kind ?
__label__1	'If she lasts a couple of hours , I shall be surprised , ' said the apothecary 's apprentice , intent upon the toothpick 's point .
__label__0	Then burst forth the unending argument between the believers and the unbelievers in the societies of the wise and the scientific journals .
__label__1	How irrevocable would have been his knowledge of it , if he had remained with me but another hour !
__label__1	`` No , I do n't say that it was so , mother , but that I made it out to be so .
__label__0	<NAME> was left for him to do but to make an attack upon the sacred village of <NAME> , containing the tombs of several of the principal families .
__label__1	So sometimes I put a quiet tea at the window here , with a little quiet contemplation of the <NAME> ( which comes soothing ) , between the day , and domestic -- ’ ‘ <NAME> , ’ suggested <NAME> , sorrowfully .
__label__0	After pondering long , and as profoundly as he could , upon these figures , <NAME> came to the conclusion that , as the earth was now receiving about double the amount of light and heat that it had been receiving before the catastrophe , it was receiving about the same as the planet <NAME> ; he was driven , therefore , to the estimate of the measure in which the earth must have approximated to the sun , a deduction in which he was confirmed when the opportunity came for him to observe <NAME> herself in the splendid proportions that she now assumed .
__label__1	But I ’ ve no suspicions. ’ <NAME> said which , Mr Wegg smokes and looks at the fire with a most determined expression of <NAME> ; as if he had caught that cardinal virtue by the skirts as she felt it her painful duty to depart from him , and held her by main force .
__label__1	I can ’ t do that , for I am a poor , timid , nervous creature .
__label__0	But yet , the mines will be exhausted , no doubt , and more rapidly than the statistics make out ! ” “ That will happen , <NAME> ; and in my opinion <NAME> is very wrong in exchanging her fuel for the gold of other nations !
__label__1	' I have been a liar , and among liars from a little child , ' said the girl after another interval of silence , 'but I will take your words . '
__label__1	‘ You have a bad father , have you ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , <NAME> ! ’ returned <NAME> , amazed .
__label__1	An old red-brick mansion , used as a school , was in its place ; and a fine old house it must have been to go to school at , as I recollect it .
__label__0	This agent must be of a versatile disposition , and able to dissemble ; capable , in a word , of concealing the real meaning of projects which aimed at nothing less than withdrawing all the commerce of <NAME> from the hands of the <NAME> and <NAME> , and through them from the Venetians , in order to enrich <NAME> with it .
__label__1	In about a quarter of an hour Mr Chuckster ( with a pen behind his ear and his face inflamed with wine ) appeared at the door , and condescending to address Kit by the jocose appellation of ‘ Young Snob , ’ informed him that the visitors were coming out .
__label__1	Indeed there is nothing in the world I would n't do to show how much . ''
__label__0	But will his warriors consent ? ” “ Yes !
__label__1	You can not fail to know that she is far below him. ’ ‘ Raise her up ! ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	I ’ ve told her how I ’ m sitivated ; she ’ s ready to vait till I ’ m ready , and I believe she vill .
__label__0	We may be sure that these new shoes were large enough and never pinched the feet of the wearers .
__label__1	‘ If they hadn ’ t been both of a mind in it , how could it ever have been ?
__label__0	Then anger would prevail over grief .
__label__1	The <NAME> , at his best , appeared so poor a substitute for the love and pride of parents .
__label__1	‘ With respect to the pecuniary assistance enabling us to launch our frail canoe on the ocean of enterprise , I have reconsidered that important business-point ; and would beg to propose my notes of hand -- drawn , it is needless to stipulate , on stamps of the amounts respectively required by the various Acts of <NAME> applying to such securities -- at eighteen , twenty-four , and thirty months .
__label__1	Bred in meanness and hard dealing , this had rescued him to be a man of honourable mind and open hand .
__label__1	At other downward flights of steps , are other lamps , marking the whereabouts of oyster-cellars—pleasant retreats , say I : not only by reason of their wonderful cookery of oysters , pretty nigh as large as cheese-plates ( or for thy dear sake , heartiest of <NAME> Professors !
__label__0	Nothing of the sort , however ; his lips muttered no other words than these : “ I will get there ! ” Half an hour after the attack of the <NAME> horsemen , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> entered Nijni-Oudinsk .
__label__1	One of her sisterhood knitted beside her .
__label__1	Even you are a courtier , or think it necessary to become one to me ! ''
__label__0	<NAME> decided to continue the exploration of the coast and the survey of <NAME> Francis Archipelago alone -- a most important undertaking , as no navigator had examined its islands separately since its first discovery by <NAME> in 1627 .
__label__1	The performance seemed a little long to <NAME> and <NAME> , particularly when it stopped to afford the Clown an opportunity of telling <NAME> ( who said ‘ Indeed , sir ! ’ to all his observations in the calmest way , and with his eye on the house ) about two legs sitting on three legs looking at one leg , when in came four legs , and laid hold of one leg , and up got two legs , caught hold of three legs , and threw ’ em at four legs , who ran away with one leg .
__label__1	Never. ’ ‘ What has he done ? ’ ‘ He has made a slave of me with his looks .
__label__0	There is a rich supply of water , and we have no fear of suffering from thirst , which in our circumstances is of the last importance .
__label__1	It is she who should reproach ; not I .
__label__0	The sun had absorbed all the vapours .
__label__1	says the coroner with a melancholy shake of the head .
__label__0	Nineteen days afterwards he arrived before <NAME> , where the inhabitants assured him of the existence of an unknown land in the west of the <NAME> .
__label__1	I never was so happy ; in all my life I never was ! ’ The worthy soul hid her face in her handkerchief , and sobbed aloud ; for it was the first opportunity she had had of unburdening her heart , and it would have its way .
__label__1	“ I can not think , ” said <NAME> , raising her eyes after a silence “ why you should be so unreasonable when I come to see you after a separation .
__label__0	`` Has he gone to work , or to rest ? ''
__label__0	The explorers proceeded towards the south , disturbing numerous flocks of sea-birds and herds of seals , which threw themselves into the sea as soon as they saw the strangers at a distance .
__label__0	<NAME> , in fact , had been taken by Feofar-Khan some days previously , and it was thence that the invaders , masters of <NAME> , were to march upon <NAME> .
__label__1	You have expended a great deal on my education , and have always been as liberal to me in all things as it was possible to be .
__label__1	And I did so , on the supposition that you could not fail to be highly proud of it. ’ Now , there are these two curious touches of human nature working the secret springs of this dialogue .
__label__0	I must have walked like a somnambulist , without any knowledge of my steps , and <NAME> must have guided me here , after having dragged me from the waves ... Come , <NAME> !
__label__0	The port is frequented by a great many vessels from the neighboring countries .
__label__1	‘ There is no “ of course ” in the case , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , gradually breaking into a smile , in spite of the uneasiness which <NAME> ’ s obstinacy had given him .
__label__1	<NAME> macaroons , glittering liqueurs , magically-preserved tropical spices , and jellies of celestial tropical fruits , displayed themselves profusely at an instant ’ s notice .
__label__0	After this solid conversation every one made himself as comfortable as possible in the cavern , and soon fell asleep .
__label__1	But , does <NAME> feel still , as on the night when she knew that Mr Dombey would return to offer his alliance , that <NAME> knows her thoroughly , and reads her right , and that she is more degraded by his knowledge of her , than by aught else ?
__label__1	The house was no longer theirs .
__label__0	`` Besides , '' said the cautious <NAME> , `` if we take the commander back with us , and act under his commands , we shall have earned our pay ; but if we go back without him , it 's not so sure . ''
__label__1	I do n't care about it , I do n't know about it , I do n't want it , I do n't keep it -- it goes away from me directly .
__label__0	The latter was then led towards the mouth of the <NAME> , and all climbing the left bank of the river , reached <NAME> .
__label__1	Why money should be so precious to an <NAME> too dull and mean to exchange it for any other satisfaction , is strange ; but there is no animal so sure to get laden with it , as the Ass who sees nothing written on the face of the earth and sky but the three letters L. S. D. -- not <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , which they often stand for , but the three dry letters .
__label__1	Slipping us out at a little side gate , the old lady stopped most unexpectedly in a narrow back street , part of some courts and lanes immediately outside the wall of the inn , and said , `` This is my lodging .
__label__0	`` A man who was bound to you by no tie , <NAME> , and who , consequently , can not be accused of treachery . ''
__label__0	<NAME> was not more successful than his masters .
__label__0	“ Who ? ” answered <NAME> , “ but he -- ” The sailor ’ s sentence was cut short by a new tinkle of the bell .
__label__0	The engineer ’ s thought was at once understood .
__label__1	‘ I ’ ll come anywhere you like , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ or do anything you like .
__label__1	I wish her to know , and perhaps you will tell her ? ’ ‘ Do you think , at your sister ’ s age -- ’ hinted <NAME> .
__label__0	There are no large caravans constantly arriving in it , as at <NAME> ; nor are there so many strangers there as in the latter town ; whilst the market , held at three o'clock in the morning on account of the heat , appears deserted .
__label__1	That ain ’ t the worst on it , neither .
__label__0	“ After breakfast , <NAME> , ” replied <NAME> , “ we ’ ll discuss the program of our new expedition _en famille_. ” M. <NAME> ’ s breakfast seemed quite a <NAME> to the hungry guests .
__label__1	By this time they had visited the family on several occasions , and had always observed that even a passing allusion to Mr <NAME> when he was not among them , brought back the cloud which had obscured Mr <NAME> ’ s sunshine on the morning of the chance encounter at the <NAME> .
__label__1	The breakfast ended in a perfect understanding .
__label__0	The trees met like a bower overhead , and caused a half-darkness .
__label__0	Afterwards he sailed along the coast of <NAME> , where he was able to obtain provisions in abundance in exchange for <NAME> knives , hatchets , shirts , hats , and other articles of no great value .
__label__1	‘ A quiet , happy place -- a place to live and learn to die in ! ’ She would have said more , but that the energy of her thoughts caused her voice to falter , and come in trembling whispers from her lips .
__label__1	‘ You are quite sure , ’ said <NAME> junior , calling after him when he got to the door , unwilling wholly to relinquish the bright business idea he had conceived ; ‘ that it ’ s nothing about <NAME> ? ’ ‘ <NAME> sure. ’ With such assurance , and rather wondering what might have taken place if it _had_ been anything about tonnage , Mr <NAME> withdrew to pursue his inquiries .
__label__1	‘ Coarse person ! ’ said <NAME> , ‘ you anticipate my meaning , though in odious language. ’ Here Mrs <NAME> rested her elbow on the little table at her side , and suffering her wrist to droop in what she considered a graceful and becoming manner , dangled her fan to and fro , and lazily admired her hand while speaking .
__label__0	`` So did I , madam , and I am excessively disappointed .
__label__1	If it ’ s not a liberty , please to come and take a cup .
__label__1	Without I was informed agen , the danger ai n't so much to signify .
__label__1	‘ Pretty well. ’ ‘ And yet , ’ said I , ‘ I get so miserable and worried , and am so unsteady and irresolute in my power of assuring myself , that I know I must want -- shall I call it -- reliance , of some kind ? ’ ‘ Call it so , if you will , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	It can be proved , sir .
__label__1	`` Only I , '' returns the trooper , `` but as I know it , do me one more good turn and pull my hat over my eyes . ''
__label__0	They also heard the noise of a waterfall , which showed that a few hundred feet up the river there was a natural barrier .
__label__1	People who could lay hold of nothing else , set themselves with bleeding hands to force stones and bricks out of their places in walls .
__label__1	`` She was a noble vessel .
__label__1	`` No more did n't I of mine , '' cries Guster .
__label__1	I wos married fust , that vay myself , <NAME> , and <NAME> wos the consekens o ’ the manoover. ’ ‘ You give me no great encouragement to conclude what I have to say , ’ observed <NAME> , ‘ but I had better do so at once .
__label__1	A break-up of the constitootion is it ? -- werry good .
__label__1	‘ No , sir , ’ he said , shaking his head , ‘ all that ’ s past and over with me , sir .
__label__1	`` <NAME> , '' said <NAME> , with an interest he had never felt before , `` tell me if <NAME> will live . ''
__label__1	‘ Do you mean to go and seek your fortune ? ’ ‘ I expect I shall be forced to go to <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> , ‘ and live there. ’ ‘ You might have gone farther off , ’ I said , brightening a little , ‘ and been as bad as lost .
__label__1	The hue and cry going off to the <NAME> , and people coming thence to examine the iron , <NAME> 's opinion was corroborated .
__label__1	It still continued to rain heavily , and when we went down to the <NAME> ( for that was the mode of conveyance by which we were to proceed ) after dinner , the weather was as unpromising and obstinately wet as one would desire to see .
__label__1	<NAME> is confident that he invented that forcible figure—would fall to pieces .
__label__0	`` You can go now , M. Aronnax , '' said the <NAME> .
__label__1	I felt very brave at being left alone in the solitary house , the protector of Em ’ ly and Mrs. Gummidge , and only wished that a lion or a serpent , or any ill-disposed monster , would make an attack upon us , that I might destroy him , and cover myself with glory .
__label__0	Are you sure of it , my daughter ? ” “ Why should he have deceived me in this , ” replied <NAME> , “ when he deceived me in no other way ? ” <NAME> , however , by a kind of presentiment , <NAME> put questions upon questions to <NAME> .
__label__0	On the 4th of December , when the travelers awoke after fifty-four hours ' journey , the chronometer marked five o'clock of the terrestrial morning .
__label__0	<NAME> us over two hundred and thirty francs in silver money , or we will proceed to help ourselves. ” <NAME> began to yell with all his might : “ Thieves !
__label__1	Oh deep , exhaustless , mighty well of love , in which so much was sunk !
__label__1	‘ Thank you , dear <NAME> ! ’ said I .
__label__0	Her absolute silence as to her former life , when by speaking out she might benefit us , proves to me that some awful secret , which she dares not reveal , weighs on her mind .
__label__1	No tear , or sound of complaint escaped him ; but the unsettled look , and disordered haste with which he paced up and down the yard , denoted the fever which was burning within .
__label__1	`` Well , sir , '' says <NAME> .
__label__0	Accompanied by his slaves , he walked into the fields , and there met the owner of a fine plot of barley .
__label__1	“ Are you mixing that other bowl of punch ? ” said Stryver the portly , with his hands in his waistband , glancing round from the sofa where he lay on his back .
__label__1	‘ Well , godmother , ’ said <NAME> , as they remained upon the steps together , looking at one another .
__label__1	Sure as the morning came , it found him lingering near the house to ask if she were well ; and , morning , noon , or night , go where she would , he would forsake his playmates and his sports to bear her company .
__label__0	The fuci and llianas grew in rigid perpendicular lines , due to the density of the element which had produced them .
__label__0	At <NAME> there was no sign of any disturbance whatsoever .
__label__1	Some people maintains that an Englishman ’ s house is his castle .
__label__1	‘ Not for all the world and his wife .
__label__0	If there had been no lack of water !
__label__1	And if <NAME> got clear off , <NAME> 's pretty sure to be safe ; for <NAME> 's worth two of <NAME> any time . '
__label__0	“ What a frightful scene ! ” said <NAME> , with profound disgust .
__label__0	`` We have arrived at that period of the world 's existence when the first plants and the first animals made their appearance . ''
__label__1	One was the flippant contempt with which the guests evidently regarded her uncle , and the other , the easy insolence of their manner towards herself .
__label__0	Fifty years had now elapsed since the discovery of most of the islands of <NAME> , and everywhere changes had taken place as sudden as those in the <NAME> .
__label__0	It was now necessary to complete the observations of the evening before by measuring the height of the cliff above the level of the sea .
__label__0	On this subject , he regaled him with the most persuasive arguments , which , however , did <NAME> persuade <NAME> , and wasted his breath in pathetic entreaties , by which the latter seemed to be but slightly moved .
__label__0	It is the only injury the <NAME> has sustained .
__label__1	The table was long , and the dinner was long ; and <NAME> , overshadowed by a large pair of black whiskers and a large white cravat , lost sight of her father altogether , until a servant put a scrap of paper in her hand , with a whispered request from <NAME> that she would read it directly .
__label__1	What is the matter ? ’ ‘ <NAME> dare you , ’ said the old man , turning round on <NAME> , ‘ how dare you do it ?
__label__1	A liar too , ’ he added , in a lower voice as he drew closer to me , ‘ who knows how dear she is to me , and seeks to wound me even there , because there is a stranger nearby. ’ ‘ Strangers are nothing to me , grandfather , ’ said the young fellow catching at the word , ‘ nor I to them , I hope .
__label__1	`` If you think so , guardian , it is right . ''
__label__1	You will have to get the better of that objection , <NAME> , and to accustom yourself to it very probably on many similar occasions ; unless you adopt the remedy which is in your own hands , of giving me no cause of complaint .
__label__1	‘ They are sitting up beyond their usual hour , I suppose .
__label__0	<NAME> , more than mist , a thick yellow , mouldy-smelling fog .
__label__1	<NAME> in return , requiring name of such <NAME> .
__label__0	Might there not be rather a malevolent intention to thwart <NAME> ’ s plans ?
__label__1	‘ <NAME> ’ t you have it of that chap that took hold of me by the chin !
__label__1	Of course you gentlemen hardly failed to observe that he was towing by the neck and arms. ’ They had helped to release the rope , and of course not .
__label__1	I see he is listening , but can ’ t hear .
__label__0	<NAME> , compelled to wait till nightfall , in order to pass the fortifications , but not desiring to show himself , remained in the posting-house , and there partook of food .
__label__1	‘ I don ’ t deny , ’ added <NAME> , ‘ that my schooling was cheap .
__label__1	He had been over the <NAME> in the course of the morning and whimsically described the family pictures as we walked .
__label__1	<NAME> himself was the chief impediment .
__label__1	I was at the coach office to take leave of her and see her go ; and there was he , returning to <NAME> by the same conveyance .
__label__1	<NAME> let the weedur send her lattle boy to yan o ’ our school-measthers , while there ’ s a harse to hoold in a ’ <NAME> , or a gootther to lie asleep in .
__label__1	I hope you ’ re well ? ’ Encouraged by these gracious words , and by my aunt ’ s extending her hand , <NAME> came forward , and took the hand , and curtseyed her acknowledgements .
__label__1	says <NAME> , greedily curious .
__label__1	Repeating ‘ no ’ , and ‘ not the least ’ , and other short assurances to the same purport , <NAME> jogged on before us , at a queer , uneven pace ; and we followed : <NAME> , looking grave , I observed , and shaking his head to himself , without knowing that I saw him .
__label__1	This is a charming spot , is the <NAME> , but you must get to apprechiate it by degrees .
__label__1	We see enough ! ’ cried <NAME> .
__label__0	`` No doubt , <NAME> , '' cried the old watchmaker , `` and it will be no slight honour for me to have been able to cut and shape the crystal to the durability of a diamond !
__label__1	He winked , shook his head , smiled , winked again ; and , with an expression of countenance which seemed to denote that he was greatly amused with something or other , walked merrily away .
__label__1	There ’ ll be some lost time to make up , of course .
__label__0	`` The sun warms our projectile , which absorbs its rays ; but it does not warm the vacuum in which we are floating at this moment .
__label__1	<NAME> , <NAME> ! ’ Fascination Fledgeby , left alone in the counting-house , strolled about with his hat on one side , whistling , and investigating the drawers , and prying here and there for any small evidences of his being cheated , but could find none .
__label__1	Those who are habituated to the -- ha -- <NAME> , are pleased to call me its father .
__label__1	Do you wish to say anything further to him ? ’ ‘ You knew me , a long time before I came here and was changed , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , looking at me ; and a more villainous look I never saw , even on his visage .
__label__0	<NAME> arms , and a general air of decision gave him the appearance of a hardy , jolly , companion .
__label__1	He never smoked so late , and it seemed to hint to me that he wanted comforting , for some reason or other .
__label__0	`` Pen is right , '' said <NAME> ; `` it 's tempting Providence . ''
__label__1	Mrs. Sparsit first elevated , then knitted , her <NAME> eyebrows ; gathered up her work into its proper basket ; and rose .
__label__0	Scarcely was anchor cast in the <NAME> river before a great number of native vessels came to examine the frigate , offering for sale vegetables , fish , oranges , and a multitude of trifles , once so rare , now so common , but always costly .
__label__1	And dear me , it ’ s a long time ago , now , ain ’ t it ?
__label__1	‘ “ <NAME> were hid under the cushions and covers of the chairs ” ’ ; ( Here Mr <NAME> looked under himself on the settle . )
__label__0	But the subterranean sounds were too perceptible to allow of the supposition that it was of any great thickness .
__label__0	The frigates were so placed as to protect the boats as they neared the land , in the event of any attack by the savages , for our recollection of the treachery of the natives of the islands south of the <NAME> made us distrustful . ''
__label__1	'If he had , ' said <NAME> , 'the dog 'ud want to lead us away to where he did it .
__label__1	These were proud times for Mrs Nickleby ; never was anybody half so discreet and sage as she , or half so mysterious withal ; and never were there such cunning generalship , and such unfathomable designs , as she brought to bear upon <NAME> , with the view of ascertaining whether her suspicions were well founded : and if so , of tantalising him into taking her into his confidence and throwing himself upon her merciful consideration .
__label__0	This cleaning was done in vats filled with water , which was maintained at the temperature of seventy degrees , and in which the wool was soaked for four-and-twenty hours ; it was then thoroughly washed in baths of soda , and , when sufficiently dried by pressure , it was in a state to be compressed , that is to say , to produce a solid material , rough , no doubt , and such as would have no value in a manufacturing centre of <NAME> or <NAME> , but which would be highly esteemed in the <NAME> markets .
__label__1	It was a good thought .
__label__0	How is that for high ? ''
__label__1	I should have had it before to be of use to me .
__label__1	“ <NAME> hundred pounds. ” “ If I give you the money for this purpose , will you keep my secret as you have kept your own ? ” “ Quite as faithfully. ” “ And your mind will be more at rest ? ” “ Much more at rest. ” “ Are you very unhappy now ? ” She asked this question , still without looking at me , but in an unwonted tone of sympathy .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> , by this resolution , inevitably sacrificed himself ; he pronounced his own doom .
__label__1	‘ I shall make him fetch and carry , my dear , and I shall make him subject to me .
__label__0	“ They were destroyed by the Fouillanes in 1826 ; the city was one-third larger then , for <NAME> , an object generally coveted by all the tribes , since the eleventh century , has belonged in succession to the <NAME> , the Sonrayans , the <NAME> men , and the <NAME> ; and this great centre of civilization , where a sage like Ahmed-Baba owned , in the sixteenth century , a library of sixteen hundred manuscripts , is now nothing but a mere half-way house for the trade of <NAME> Africa. ” The city , indeed , seemed abandoned to supreme neglect ; it betrayed that indifference which seems epidemic to cities that are passing away .
__label__1	'What if I did it ! '
__label__1	She was subject to severe fits , which seemed to rack her frame almost beyond her power of endurance : and life was held by the feeblest tenure : but when a year and a half old , she seemed to rally ; the dangerous symptoms subsided ; and at twenty months old , she was perfectly well .
__label__0	`` After having passed the north pole , '' replied <NAME> .
__label__0	If the observer had then specially directed his attention to one of the more humble and less brilliant of these stellar bodies , a star of the fourth class , that which is arrogantly called the <NAME> , all the phenomena to which the formation of the <NAME> is to be ascribed would have been successively fulfilled before his eyes .
__label__1	‘ There ! ’ said <NAME> when they got into the street ; ‘ now you ’ re provided for. ’ <NAME> was about to thank him again , but he stopped her .
__label__1	said I. I always sat down on the other side of him .
__label__1	She laid her hand upon her breast , murmuring the sacred name that had been read to her ; and life passed from her face , like light removed .
__label__0	It is a question if he really visited all the places that he describes , and it seems probable that he did not ; in fact , in the narrative written at his dictation by <NAME> of Pisa it is stated `` Marco-Polo , a wise and noble citizen of <NAME> , saw nearly all herein described with his own eyes , and what he did not see he learnt from the lips of truthful and credible witnesses ; '' but we must add that the greater part of the kingdoms and towns spoken of by <NAME> Polo he certainly did visit .
__label__1	However striking such a contrast as this may be to lookers-on , none ever feel it with half the keenness or acuteness of perfection with which it strikes to the very soul of him whose inferiority it marks .
__label__0	The rich freight of the <NAME> , decided the Emperor to send a second fleet to the <NAME> .
__label__0	It was but a brief struggle ; the seal struggled for a few seconds , and was then suffocated on the breast of his adversary , who , dragging him away easily , in spite of his size , and springing lightly from one piece of ice to another , reached land and disappeared with his prey .
__label__0	And as for partners , if madam plays -- '' `` Certainly , sir , '' <NAME> quickly replied ; `` I understand whist .
__label__0	It is ten o'clock , and with your permission , lieutenant , I will turn in . ''

__label__0	In a mood of stolid and sullen resignation , I was about to take my accustomed place on the raft when my uncle placed his hand upon my shoulder .
__label__1	What was , was all summed up in this : that she was lost , and he bowed down with sorrow and remorse .

__label__0	But it was exactly this continuance of east wind which frightened the greater part of the sailors , who saw in this persistence , so favourable for the outward voyage , the promise of a formidable obstacle to their return home .
__label__1	The old woman looked at him , as though she had a strong impulse upon her to make another clutch at his head and throat , but was restrained by a certain dogged mystery in his face .
__label__0	Some presented the appearance of blue mountains of harmonious conformation ; upon others , much more distant , there appeared a prodigiously lofty cone , above the summit of which hung dark and heavy clouds .
__label__1	He had likewise a pair of little eyes that were always half shut up , and a mouth that was always half expanded into a grin , as if he had , that moment , posed a boy , and were waiting to convict him from his own lips .
__label__0	`` They 're not furrows , dear friend , '' said <NAME> , `` and ca n't be , either , simply on account of their immense size .

__label__1	But something has been -- You feel quite strong to-day , don ’ t you ? ’ ‘ <NAME> strong. ’ The hand he held crept up a little nearer his face .
__label__1	The upshot of it all was , that <NAME> was in raptures with him , and that they went upstairs to breakfast .
__label__1	It was a ragged head , the sandy hair of which , scrupulously parted on one side , and flattened down with pomatum , was twisted into little semi- circular tails round a flat face ornamented with a pair of small eyes , and garnished with a very dirty shirt collar , and a rusty black stock .

__label__0	Besides , they would have it that the <NAME> , who made them prisoners , would have dragged them into the interior , and it was impossible , they said , to hunt all through <NAME> for three men -- three <NAME> ; that the search would be vain and perilous , and cost more lives than it saved .
__label__1	His neck was saved for the halter , but he got some painful and slow-healing injury for his trouble ?
__label__1	<NAME> father said anything particular to you to-day or yesterday , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Away ! ’ was the first word he could utter as he literally gnashed his teeth .
__label__1	You asked me if I could have perfect faith in you , and I said yes , and I meant it. ’ It did not escape <NAME> ’ s notice that he began to look triumphant .
__label__1	It was the one grain of relief I had .
__label__1	‘ As to our being a pack of thieves , <NAME> , ’ said the man , as he spat out some blood , and wiped more from his face ; ‘ you know better than that at midday .
__label__1	You don ’ t see the reg ’ lar wagrants there ; trust ‘ em , they knows better than that .
__label__1	“ When I ask what I am to call myself to-day , <NAME> , ” I went on , “ I suggest what I have in my thoughts .
__label__1	If we had been waited on by any boat , I should have run in to shore , and have obliged her to go on , or to make her purpose evident .
__label__1	'The first question is , of what nature was her communication ? '
__label__0	Two men , besides , deserve to be mentioned for the encouragements and facilities which they afforded to the explorers , viz. , M. de Frontenac , Governor of <NAME> , and <NAME> , intendant of justice and police .

__label__0	It was a remarkable fact that , although in the very midst of the furious tempest , they did not suffer from it .
__label__1	My son is one of the last representatives of two old families .

__label__0	Our aeronauts had scarcely gone a distance of fifteen miles , having expended , as on the preceding day , one hundred and thirty-five cubic feet of gas to feed the cylinder , and two pints of water out of the remaining eight had been sacrificed to the demands of intense thirst .
__label__0	Having described my uncle , I will now give an account of our interview .
__label__0	He avowed over and over again his intention of never quitting the nucleus of his comet .
__label__0	answered the doctor ; `` what is the use of dressing warmly if one ca n't produce heat within himself ?
__label__1	“ Well , <NAME> ? ” “ I start for <NAME> , <NAME> , to-morrow , ” I was exceedingly careful what I said , “ and I thought you would kindly not mind my taking leave of you. ” “ This is a gay figure , <NAME> , ” said she , making her crutch stick play round me , as if she , the fairy godmother who had changed me , were bestowing the finishing gift .
__label__1	Mrs. Markleham -- you have not forgotten Mrs. Markleham ? ’ Forgotten the <NAME> !
__label__1	I bar , ’ said <NAME> , <NAME> , thoughtfully .
__label__0	However , after <NAME> had calmly surveyed the actual state of affairs , he determined to bring things to a crisis .
__label__1	I can speak to no one else about him , but poor Kit .
__label__0	What monster can fill himself with such huge volumes of water , and then unceasingly spout them out in such lofty jets ?
__label__1	But now she soothed him with gentle and tender words , smiled at his thinking they could ever part , and rallied him cheerfully upon the jest .
__label__0	The atlas was a magnificent work , comprising maps of every country in the world , and several planispheres arranged upon <NAME> ’ s projection , and of which the nomenclature was in <NAME> -- but which also bore neither date nor name of publisher .
__label__0	Those who remained at the fort also suffered terribly from cold , the thermometer sinking three degrees lower than it had done when <NAME> was at <NAME> , nine degrees nearer the pole .
__label__1	‘ There ’ s Em ’ ly ’ s cousin , him that she was to have been married to , ’ said <NAME> , rubbing his hands feebly , ‘ as fine a fellow as there is in <NAME> !
__label__0	My books -- my accounts ! -- '' With these words he sprang from his bed towards a book in which the names of his customers and the articles which had been sold to them were inscribed .
__label__1	'There now , <NAME> , ' remonstrated <NAME> , eagerly catching at the word .
__label__1	How <NAME> received the announcement I am unable to say ; for I was afraid to look at him just then , lest <NAME> 's sharpness should detect that there had been some communication unknown to him between us .
__label__0	The cable strained violently , and every half hour <NAME> had to take in a fathom to ease it .
__label__1	It ’ s here and there , and -- and , in short , it ’ s as good as nowhere , ’ said the old man , looking in bewilderment about him .
__label__1	Impassive faces , yet with a suspended -- not an abolished -- expression on them ; faces , rather , in a fearful pause , as having yet to raise the dropped lids of the eyes , and bear witness with the bloodless lips , “ THOU DIDST Seven prisoners released , seven gory heads on pikes , the keys of the accursed fortress of the eight strong towers , some discovered letters and other memorials of prisoners of old time , long dead of broken hearts , -- such , and such -- like , the loudly echoing footsteps of <NAME> escort through the <NAME> streets in mid-July , one thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine .
__label__1	Finally he gave a faint single rap , and <NAME> -- such was the compromising name of the avenging boy -- announced “ Mr .
__label__1	‘ And there really is no hurry , you know , ’ said <NAME> in a lower voice .
__label__1	“ I can not find it , ” said he , “ and I must have it .
__label__0	“ Yes , <NAME> , both on animals and men. ” “ You are not joking , <NAME> ? ” “ I am not , <NAME> .
__label__0	It may be imagined what were the apprehensions of <NAME> and <NAME> , when they thought of the combustible liquid on which the raft floated .
__label__1	<NAME> , you see , and abstruse set of solid mahogany pigeon-holes , one for every letter of the alphabet .
__label__0	`` You are <NAME> , I suppose ? ''
__label__1	'Not a penny , ' replied the girl , waving her hand .
__label__1	‘ Favourites ? ’ repeated <NAME> , with the veins in his forehead swelling quickly .
__label__1	`` Now , <NAME> , '' said he , `` the best thing you can do is to go along with <NAME> to look after your Guster -- '' `` My Guster , Mr .
__label__1	It is no mistake of mine , surely , to suppose that his having gained the priceless blessing of his life , is one cause of the animosity shown to him by his brother. ’ ‘ You touch upon a subject that is never breathed between us ; not even between us , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	`` Well , your head , except that you have one or two contusions , is exactly where it ought to be -- on your shoulders , '' said my uncle , laughing .
__label__1	Accompanying <NAME> to the gate , she as closely watched what followed .
__label__1	Let it lie there , let it lie .
__label__1	When we had exhausted the subject of the stars , or rather when I had exhausted the mental faculties of <NAME> , little Em ’ ly and I made a cloak of an old wrapper , and sat under it for the rest of the journey .
__label__1	Inquiring for the object of his solicitude , he learnt that he had timed his visit well ; for Mr Squeers was , in fact , at that moment waiting for a hackney coach he had ordered , and in which he purposed proceeding to his week ’ s retirement , like a gentleman .
__label__1	I am not changed towards you . ''
__label__0	Are you going by sea ? ” “ Neither by sea , nor by land , nor by air ! ” said <NAME> sweetly .
__label__0	Happily the prudence and address of President <NAME> averted the danger .
__label__0	The personal danger of <NAME> at this moment was great ; the troops sent by <NAME> were more numerous and better furnished with arms and ammunition than were his own , but his deepest cause of anxiety was not the possibility of his own condemnation and death , it was the fear lest all fruit of his efforts might be lost , and the knowledge of the hurtfulness of these dissensions to his country 's cause .
__label__0	Our safety depended on this last chance .
__label__0	The sailors then closed the rings , so that the savages found themselves in fetters .
__label__0	Had the <NAME> veered round ?
__label__0	When he recovered his senses , he found himself in the cabin of a mujik , who had picked him up and cared for him .
__label__1	‘ I hope you dote upon pictures ? ’ ‘ I assure you , <NAME> , ’ said Mr Dombey , with solemn encouragement of his Manager , ‘ that <NAME> has a very good taste for pictures ; quite a natural power of appreciating them .
__label__0	He goes on and does not appear to have discovered that he has left us behind ! ” “ To deceive me , too !
__label__1	And here , in the very first stage , I was supplanted by a shabby man with a squint , who had no other merit than smelling like a livery-stables , and being able to walk across me , more like a fly than a human being , while the horses were at a canter !
__label__1	The breath was scarcely out o ’ your poor mother- in-law ’ s body , ven vun old ‘ ooman sends me a pot o ’ jam , and another a pot o ’ jelly , and another brews a blessed large jug o ’ camomile-tea , vich she brings in vith her own hands. ’ <NAME> paused with an aspect of intense disgust , and looking round , added in a whisper , ‘ They wos all widders , <NAME> , all on ‘ em , ‘ cept the camomile-tea vun , as wos a single young lady o ’ fifty-three. ’ <NAME> gave a comical look in reply , and the old gentleman having broken an obstinate lump of coal , with a countenance expressive of as much earnestness and malice as if it had been the head of one of the widows last-mentioned , said : ‘ In short , <NAME> , I feel that I ain ’ t safe anyveres but on the box. ’ ‘ How are you safer there than anyveres else ? ’ interrupted <NAME> .
__label__1	Mrs. Chadband is a stern , severe-looking , silent woman .
__label__0	Once past their hiding place , <NAME> was certain of soon being able to outdistance the convicts , and execute his important mission successfully .
__label__0	<NAME> , for instance , is as ancient as man himself ; electricity was known 3000 years ago , and steam 1100 years ago .
__label__0	At the distance of half a mile was the entrance to the narrow bay , where was the landing-place for our tourists , who meant to return to Stirling by <NAME> .
__label__1	`` Disgrace never comes to <NAME> , '' returns the housekeeper .
__label__1	So off they set ; the plaintiff and defendant walking arm in arm , the officer in front , and eight stout coachmen bringing up the rear .
__label__0	In the evening , after a journey of only five miles , they camped under the gum-trees .
__label__0	When the latter came to <NAME> he showed himself very ill-disposed towards <NAME> , who had abandoned the service of <NAME> , and who , at this very moment was procuring for <NAME> a commerce which would soon immensely increase the maritime power of an already formidable country .
__label__1	I looked back through two years of my own life—out of jail , prosperous , happy , surrounded by blessings , comforts , good fortune—and thought how wide a gap it was , and how long those two years passed in solitary captivity would have been .
__label__0	That evening the balloon halted about forty miles from <NAME> , and ahead of it , but in the distance , rose the two sharp cones of <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> declared himself quite equal to the undertaking .
__label__0	Before anything else was done this boat had to be put in a safe place , because it might prove our only means of escape .
__label__1	I -- ha -- I did so ; and I found that it contained -- ahem -- two guineas .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> left <NAME> , where he had obtained food by writing saphics or talismans for the natives , upon the 21st of <NAME> , and reached <NAME> , where a large salt-market is held .
__label__0	<NAME> gives the following account of the interview : `` When we arrived we saw a large assembly of dukes and princes who had come from all parts with their attendants , who were on horseback in the neighbouring fields and on the hills .
__label__1	‘ We are thankful to come here for rest , sir , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	If it is decreed that we die to-morrow , let us die bravely , like <NAME> men , ready to appear without terror before the <NAME> Judge .
__label__0	As for wintering in that part of the antarctic circle , not a man of us could have survived it .
__label__1	As they were to remain with us that day and had taken their places to return by the coach next morning , I sought an opportunity of speaking to <NAME> .
__label__0	The warmest partisans of the enterprise now became its most ardent detractors .
__label__1	Yes , it is , it is .
__label__1	‘ Placed me in such an extremely awkward situation , ’ continued <NAME> .
__label__1	I rather feel it to be so .
__label__0	Now it must be said that was what the commander thought ; he allowed himself to think that at the last moment he would receive definite instructions as to the object of the voyage , and that he would remain in command of the <NAME> .
__label__0	Consequently , many millions of acres of the island had still escaped their investigations .
__label__1	The disposition of everything in the rooms , from the largest object to the least ; the arrangement of colours , the elegant variety and contrast obtained by thrift in trifles , by delicate hands , clear eyes , and good sense ; were at once so pleasant in themselves , and so expressive of their originator , that , as <NAME> stood looking about him , the very chairs and tables seemed to ask him , with something of that peculiar expression which he knew so well by this time , whether he approved ?
__label__0	Arrived in the open sea , the <NAME> discovered the <NAME> of <NAME> situated to the north-east of <NAME> , and then , more to the north , the <NAME> of <NAME> , now known as <NAME> .
__label__1	In the exercise of his skill , the appearance and the story of the <NAME> removed him from all other men .
__label__0	Use me like a staff. ” “ A good solid staff , <NAME> , ” answered <NAME> .
__label__1	Your Toxes and your Chickses may draw out my two front double teeth , <NAME> , but that ’ s no reason why I need offer ‘ em the whole set. ’ This proposition was also assented to by <NAME> , as an obvious one .
__label__0	“ But that is not all , <NAME> .
__label__0	Since January 31st the sun had appeared above the horizon , but it gave only a pale and brief light ; fortunately the moon would rise at half past six , and with this clear sky it would make their path plain .
__label__0	On this day for several hours I used my pickaxe vigorously .
__label__1	cries Judy with a stamp upon the ground .
__label__1	The procession then reformed ; the chairmen resumed their stations ; and the march was re- commenced .
__label__1	You could make no discovery in reference to me that would do me the least service or give me the least pleasure .
__label__1	`` I hope he did n't die of anything catching ?
__label__1	And then repeated aloud in a tone of astonishment : ‘ see me righted , sir ? ’ ‘ Ay , ay ! ’ said Mr Boffin .
__label__0	Under these circumstances , it was not surprising that <NAME> should not have confided to the count a project which , wild as it was , could scarcely have failed to widen the unacknowledged breach that was opening in their friendship .
__label__0	Behind in the west , but at a distance of four miles , rose the first trees of the forests of the <NAME> .
__label__1	He had secretly interposed against this confiding young man , for no better real reason than because the young man ’ s ways were not his ways .
__label__0	It was a harmless lizard , but it appeared to me a loathsome reptile .
__label__1	‘ What a jolly old Jack it is ! ’ cries the young fellow , with a clap of his hands .
__label__1	‘ They are not to be got rid of , for six months at least , unless they could be underlet , and that I don ’ t believe .
__label__1	'Oh , come in with you ! '
__label__1	Lie down again ; there 's a dear ! '
__label__1	`` Pray , pray tell me more . ''
__label__1	what was that , which sent the blood tingling to his heart , and deprived him of his voice , and of power to move !
__label__1	Every time I wrote to you. ’ The <NAME> took off his glazed hat , hung it on his hook , and smoothing his hair from behind with his hand , sat gazing at the group around him : a perfect image of wondering resignation .
__label__0	Has he ever understood that my gratitude to him is overflowing ?
__label__0	`` My dear boy , '' continued the grim Professor , clasping me to his heart , `` you are saved ! ''
__label__1	<NAME> looked from his wine glass at <NAME> and at Mr Lammle ; but mightn ’ t , couldn ’ t , shouldn ’ t , wouldn ’ t , look at <NAME> .
__label__1	The star had shown him where to find the God of the poor ; and through humility , and sorrow , and forgiveness , he had gone to his <NAME> ’ s rest .
__label__1	We will devise a story for you that should carry you through twenty times such a trivial scrape as this ; and if they want security in a thousand pounds for your reappearance in case you should be called upon , you shall have it .
__label__0	The principal trade of the country seems to be in horses and asses , which are sent to <NAME> or <NAME> and thence to <NAME> .
__label__1	Who was his friend with him ?
__label__1	Bless you , <NAME> , she expected they ’ d come back to her house. ’ ‘ Then where the devil is the woman ? ’ said the impatient gentleman , catching up his hat .
__label__0	It was nine o ’ clock before the festivities came to an end , and by that time the company , heated by the high temperature of the hall , and by their own exertions , felt the want of a little fresh air .
__label__1	‘ On the voyage , I shall endeavour , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ occasionally to spin them a yarn ; and the melody of my son <NAME> will , I trust , be acceptable at the galley-fire .
__label__0	Savages in general , and particularly the <NAME> , have a notion of dignity from which they never derogate .
__label__0	Had he not himself said from the beginning , in the firmest manner , that the secret of his life exacted from him our lasting imprisonment on board the <NAME> ?
__label__1	‘ As handsome as her ? ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ She ’ ll be quite happy , now she has come home again , ’ said <NAME> , nodding to her with an encouraging smile upon her wholesome face , ‘ and will be so pleased to see her dear Papa to-night. ’ ‘ Lork , <NAME> ! ’ cried <NAME> , taking up her words with a jerk .
__label__0	The captain concluded the narrative of his life .
__label__1	‘ Come ! ’ said the <NAME> , nudging him with his elbow , ‘ now ’ s your time !
__label__0	Hans , with the lamp , examined the sides of the tunnel in every direction .
__label__0	`` And at this stage of our journey , according to all known laws on the increase of heat , there should be here a temperature of < i > fifteen hundred degrees of <NAME> < /i > . ''
__label__0	He appeared anxious , timorous , ashamed , and his eyes were constantly fixed on the ground .
__label__1	They lingered about , in the fields , for some hours .
__label__1	It was a kind of festive occasion , and the parties were attired accordingly .
__label__0	chimed in <NAME> ; `` a wind of four miles an hour is very little use to a steamer going ten . ''
__label__0	“ Well , <NAME> will be disgusted ! ” “ And <NAME> will perhaps be very perplexed how to explain this disappearance , ” thought <NAME> .
__label__1	But she was a good plain sample of a nature that is ever , in the mass , better , truer , higher , nobler , quicker to feel , and much more constant to retain , all tenderness and pity , self-denial and devotion , than the nature of men .
__label__0	This placard , which was in <NAME> , read as follows : `` The <NAME> ! ''
__label__0	He wanted to see it more near , perhaps at close quarters , it might be to take away some bits of it .
__label__1	“ Wait a bit ! ” The united vastness and distinctness of this view so struck him , that he no longer asked if he might shake hands with me , but said he really must , -- and did .
__label__1	My opinion of the coal trade on that river is , that it may require talent , but that it certainly requires capital .
__label__1	But we always calls him <NAME> just the same .
__label__0	The Government house is pleasantly situated on the shores of the bay , and will be greatly improved in a few years if the young trees planted about it thrive .
__label__0	I ’ m ready. ” While he spoke he was mechanically getting paper from his note-book .
__label__1	He had all the cares of the world on his head in three months .
__label__1	‘ Yes , I did , Sir. ’ ‘ What do you think of it , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Think of it , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Yes .
__label__1	He felt the more resigned to it , forasmuch as <NAME> enjoyed herself completely , and <NAME> was delighted .
__label__1	‘ When I am found dead at the foot of the <NAME> , it will be by some of my own sort ; some of the working people who work among the lights yonder .
__label__0	It soon became needful to check their advances , as there were many sick among the crew , and it was unwise to allow too many natives on board .
__label__0	said <NAME> , `` if the earthly <NAME> were to be named over again , the name of <NAME> would suit it to a miracle ! ''
__label__0	Leaving <NAME> in 1813 , <NAME> visited the <NAME> , the valley of <NAME> , and the ancient port of <NAME> , districts which in our own day are traversed by parties of <NAME> , with their _Murray_ , <NAME> , or _Bædeker_ in their hands ; but which then were only to be visited at the risk of life .
__label__1	However , I forgive you this once , and look here , <NAME> ; that ’ s ’ -- <NAME> laid the little forefinger of her right glove on her lip , and then laid it on her father ’ s lip -- ‘ that ’ s a kiss for you .
__label__1	‘ You will not take the air to-day , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	It was therefore probable that the cetacean would not be able to extricate itself easily ; at any rate it was best to hasten , so as to cut off its retreat if necessary .
__label__1	I may be mistaken -- nothing is more likely -- but Mr <NAME> , ’ proceeded <NAME> , majestically waving her gloves , ‘ appears to me to be seated in a first-class equipage .
__label__0	His first act was to possess himself of a sailor 's clothes .
__label__0	`` The story which he has told is true in every point .
__label__0	Even at church , during the sermon , the faithful could not listen to <NAME> , the minister , in patience , and he threw himself about in the pulpit and lectured his flock with far more than his usual severity .
__label__1	<NAME> his admiration and his emulation of that shining enchanter .
__label__0	He tells us of the remarkable way in which the <NAME> kept any vow that they might have made ; that their two deities were <NAME> and <NAME> , and of the abundant growth of myrrh , cinnamon and other spices , and he gives a very interesting account of their culture and preparation .
__label__0	Towards the summit fluttered myriads of sea-fowl , and especially those of the web-footed species with long , flat , pointed beaks -- a clamorous tribe , bold in the presence of man , who probably for the first time thus invaded their domains .
__label__1	I heard of these doings of yours only last night , or you should have heard of ‘ em from me , sooner , take your oath of it .
__label__0	You will tell us , will you not , even for his own sake , all you can about his habits and his lurking-places ?
__label__1	It has not looked very long , when he sits up , chilled and shaking , slowly recovers consciousness of where he is , and makes himself ready to depart .
__label__1	The scientific gentleman was a bachelor .
__label__1	Who was it whose least word did what his utmost means could not ?
__label__0	How they hurry on , as if they were racing ! ''
__label__1	‘ <NAME> d ’ ye do , <NAME> ? ’ said Mr Toots .
__label__1	‘ Sam ! ’ said <NAME> , calling over the banisters .
__label__1	‘ Well , then , come along ! ’ said I. I could not help being rather short with him , but he appeared not to mind it .
__label__1	But , gentlemen of <NAME> , is it in cricket alone that your fellow-townsmen stand pre- eminent ?
__label__1	I carried them , one after another , to a bookstall in the <NAME> -- one part of which , near our house , was almost all bookstalls and bird shops then -- and sold them for whatever they would bring .
__label__1	What sort of stuff do you think I ’ m made of ?
__label__0	They extricated from amongst a large number of shot twenty barrels , the insides of which were lined with copper .
__label__0	The thickness of the walls of the projectile prevented any sound reaching from the inside to the outside .
__label__1	‘ Rokesmith. ’ ‘ No , it ain ’ t ! ’ cried <NAME> , clapping her hands , and shaking her head .
__label__0	A scornful smile passed over her face .
__label__0	`` They would have roasted , '' said the doctor , laughing .
__label__0	Of this Bougainville gives the following curious illustration : -- In 1828 the Suluans seized 3000 of the inhabitants upon the coast of <NAME> , and an expedition sent against them cost 140,000 piastres , and resulted in the killing of six men !
__label__0	“ To the water ! ” exclaimed <NAME> .
__label__1	She specially applied here at the house to be admitted , as not regularly belonging to our town , and—yes , you are right , <NAME> , you are right. ’ ‘ Now , stop a bit ! ’ cried <NAME> , once more .
__label__1	She had not a good place , she said ; the wages were low , and the work was hard .
__label__1	I thought all this very pretty and engaging , and <NAME> seemed to think so too , as we looked after them fading away in the light of a young moon .
__label__0	But desolate as the country appeared , <NAME> was on his guard against surprises , and gave orders to his party to form themselves in a close platoon .
__label__0	<NAME> was the density of the atmosphere that they could not be certain whether it was day or night .
__label__0	She fled and did not attack .
__label__0	<NAME> and <NAME> had become very skilful carpenters , and had nothing to do but to copy the models provided by the engineer .
__label__0	His head was full of the entreaties and persuasion of his companion , and he determined to embark secretly on the <NAME> , for <NAME> would not have authorized him to defy the prohibition of his family .
__label__1	Because , why should I do anything else ?
__label__1	He asked me as the subject arose in his mind , in his graceful , light-hearted manner and without the least embarrassment .
__label__1	<NAME> drew it suddenly away , and , for a moment , looked at her with the same strange dread ( there was a sort of wild avoidance in it ) as before ; but she presently said , ‘ Nothing , nothing .
__label__0	After receiving a visit from the queen-mother , <NAME> was invited to a _soirée_ given in his honour in the palace at <NAME> .
__label__1	Will you only promise that , <NAME> ? ’ Before the child could reply to this earnest solicitation , the street-door opened , and Mr Brass thrusting out his night-capped head called in a surly voice , ‘ Who ’ s there ! ’ Kit immediately glided away , and <NAME> , closing the window softly , drew back into the room .
__label__1	‘ I scarcely exist the next day ; I find the reaction so very great after a tragedy , my lord , and <NAME> is such a delicious creature. ’ ‘ Ye -- es ! ’ replied <NAME> .
__label__0	We are launched ; we have no obstacle before us , no stones in the way ; the road is open , more so than that of a ship battling with the sea ; more open than that of a balloon battling with the wind ; and if a ship can reach its destination , a balloon go where it pleases , why can not our projectile attain its end and aim ? ''
__label__0	In the children the upper jaw projects , but in adults it is about even with the lower .
__label__0	We have need of all our self-possession .
__label__1	Stunned as I was , as weak and helpless at first as I had ever been in my sick chamber , the necessity of guarding against the danger of discovery , or even of the remotest suspicion , did me service .
__label__1	The auspicious nuptials take place ; the newly married come home to this charming mansion ; the lady is received , let us suppose , by <NAME> .
__label__1	“ Bewitching Mrs. Copperfield ” , ’ I repeated stoutly .
__label__0	Nothing more common in connection with an eruption . ''
__label__1	She is rather long , notwithstanding ; but by and by I hear a rustling at the door , and someone taps .
__label__1	‘ What if I had found out one who knew your brother ’ s secret ; who knew the manner of his flight , who knew where he and the companion of his flight were gone ?
__label__0	I am convinced that under your charge it will furnish us with a great deal of amusement , and will serve to lighten materially the gloom of our hundred days of darkness .
__label__1	I used to think , when I got into that state , that people were all against me because of my first beginning ; and the kinder they were to me , the worse fault I found in them .
__label__1	<NAME> , old boy , you have seen the figures , and you know how they come out. ’ Mr Baptist , who had not the slightest arithmetical power of compensating himself in this way , nodded , with a fine display of bright teeth .
__label__1	“ He is a traitor since the decree .
__label__1	And they were married with the sun shining on them through the painted figure of Our Saviour on the window .
__label__0	In 1863 , after a long and sanguinary struggle , the Maories were entrenched in strong and fortified position on the <NAME> , at the end of a chain of steep hills , and covered by three miles of forts .
__label__0	At about half-past five , however , M'Nicholl , who had been gazing for some time with his telescope in a particular direction , called the attention of his companions to some bright specks of light barely discernible in that part of the horizon towards which the Projectile was evidently moving .
__label__1	Do you believe there is any chance of her consent , to balance against the outrage it would be to her ( loving dear old lady ! )
__label__1	She had reserved this last evening for her father , and they sat alone under the plane-tree .
__label__1	<NAME> enthroned herself upon a couch by the fire ; and Mr Carker , with his hat in his hand and his eyes bent upon the carpet , stood before her , at some little distance .
__label__1	I told you so beforehand , my dear , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	I immediately started for <NAME> , where the writer 's family lived ; the grandfather had served as quarter-master-general during the War of <NAME> .
__label__0	Beyond a lawn , surrounded by a wooden fence falling to pieces , was the shore , on the left of which was the mouth of the stream .
__label__1	Let me not be considered as wishing to detract from the merits of the former gentlemen .
__label__1	And what a happy wife ! ’ ‘ Aye , missus , I suppose she be , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	`` I do not say we are not , '' replied <NAME> ; `` but why ? ''
__label__0	When the <NAME> reached King <NAME> 's Harbour upon the 6th of February , the <NAME> had already arrived there , but in such a damaged condition that her captain had been obliged to run her aground .
__label__0	The ice-blocks appeared `` quite new '' ( to employ a perfectly accurate expression ) , and perhaps they had only been formed some days .
__label__1	I look along the road before me , where the distance already shortens and the journey 's end is growing visible ; and true and good above the dead sea of the Chancery suit and all the ashy fruit it cast ashore , I think I see my darling .
__label__1	And the <NAME> was above all !
__label__0	I felt the cold mount from my feet to my chest .
__label__1	There you sit , a man as has had his head broke from infancy up ’ ards , and has got a new opinion into it at every seam as has been opened .
__label__0	`` See , <NAME> , '' said <NAME> bluntly , `` help us get breakfast ready .
__label__1	‘ Now , <NAME> , ’ said he , ‘ now , woman , what are you doing ?
__label__1	And yet other ears and eyes were there and greedily taking in all that passed , and moreover they were the ears and eyes of no less a person than Mr <NAME> , who , having entered unseen when the child first placed herself at the old man ’ s side , refrained -- actuated , no doubt , by motives of the purest delicacy -- from interrupting the conversation , and stood looking on with his accustomed grin .
__label__0	The wave had torn him from the balloon net .
__label__0	`` This is what <NAME> feared , '' murmured <NAME> , changing countenance .
__label__0	It did not take <NAME> long to find out that the <NAME> was a bad sailer , and that he might anticipate much trouble during his voyage .
__label__1	There were tears in his voice too , as he answered : “ It is too late for that .
__label__1	<NAME> Jobling is buttoned up closer than mere adornment might require .
__label__0	<NAME> was far from being insensible to the sentiments of <NAME> , but yet he did not dare to speak .
__label__0	Two or three of them climbed on board , and in a determined manner came up to the main watch to look down into the orlop-deck to find out how many men were disabled , whilst a malignant joy lit up their diabolical features .
__label__0	`` But , my dear president , '' said the major , `` is not the cost price of aluminum extremely high ? ''
__label__1	Mr <NAME> was so astonished , and so uncomfortable , and so perfectly at a loss how to pursue the conversation , that he could only sit looking at his son by the light of the fire , with his hand resting on his back , as if it were detained there by some magnetic attraction .
__label__0	The <NAME> has only just arrived , and -- '' `` Yes , yes , I know .
__label__1	The smell of sawdust , beer , tobacco-smoke , and spirits is inseparable in his vocation from death in its most awful shapes .
__label__1	I should n't be at all surprised -- mark what I say ! -- if he got <NAME> a better situation . ''
__label__0	Our captain will see what ought to be done , and he will remember that time presses .
__label__1	<NAME> 's resolute right hand was occupied with an axe , in place of the usual softer implements , and in her girdle were a pistol and a cruel knife .
__label__1	Do you see those grovelling and wandering eyes ?
__label__1	<NAME> , who had stimulated this anxiety by his hard reserve of manner , and who had begun to understand his man very well , replied with an air ; as if he were saying something extraordinarily generous and great : ‘ Mr Boffin , I never bargain. ’ ‘ So I should have thought of you ! ’ said Mr Boffin , admiringly .
__label__0	The volcano to its very summit and the surrounding rocks were still covered with the unsullied mantle of snow that had fallen while the atmosphere was still to some extent charged with vapor ; but on the north side the snow had given place to the cascade of fiery lava , which , making its way down the sloping rocks as far as the vaulted opening of the central cavern , fell thence perpendicularly into the sea .
__label__1	Mrs <NAME> rang for candles as soon as the <NAME> had closed upon him .
__label__1	I am afraid I was in a tremulous state for a minute or so , though I did my best to disguise it .
__label__0	As for the <NAME> , they had no other ambition than to take possession of this new continent of the sky , and to plant upon the summit of its highest elevation the star- spangled banner of the <NAME> of <NAME> .
__label__0	The sailor and his two companions returned to the shore , to the place where they had left the <NAME> .
__label__0	What terror then could have driven them among the precipices of the Andes ?
__label__1	I am from the brown forests of the <NAME> , I am ’ —and so on , as before .
__label__1	‘ How should you like to be my number two , Nelly ? ’ ‘ To be what , sir ? ’ ‘ My number two , Nelly , my second , my Mrs Quilp , ’ said the dwarf .
__label__0	<NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and the two sailors , had just time to throw themselves flat on the ground before they swept past like a whirlwind , only a few paces distant .
__label__0	<NAME> and Co. evidently suffered from chronic attacks of aggravated “ cannonism ” !
__label__0	I jumped into a cab at the <NAME> , and from the cab into the <NAME> , where I had booked my cabin before I left <NAME> .
__label__0	He has leopards , lynxes and fine lions trained to hunt for wild animals , eagles strong enough to chase wolves , foxes , fallow and roe-deer , and , as <NAME> says , `` often to take them too , '' and his dogs may be counted by thousands .
__label__1	‘ In what respect ? ’ asked <NAME> .
__label__1	Do you know it , or do you not , <NAME> ? ’ says the Major , almost in a passion .
__label__1	He didn ’ t happen to take that particular five-pound note , but I have not the smallest doubt that he ’ s always up to something of that sort .
__label__1	‘ Bleeding Heart Yard ? ’ said <NAME> , with a puff and a snort .
__label__1	‘ You , injured by his haughty temper !
__label__0	Redoubled knocks were given with some blunt implement , probably a knotty stick , wielded by a vigorous arm .
__label__1	You can have as much flirting as you like -- at your Boffins .
__label__1	‘ And this is the bed to which society consigns me , is it ?
__label__1	I may not see her again for a long , long time .
__label__1	He was very fond of her , and said when he took her up in his arms , still sleeping , that whenever he died he would wish to be buried where his dear little child had laid her head .
__label__1	And yet I am rash to say so .
__label__1	I have no other trust , than that I have been with her since she came home , and that she has given me her confidence .
__label__1	‘ It will not be hard to find a trade for him. ’ <NAME> being buried under mountains now , the Secretary that very same day set himself to finish his affairs and have done with him .
__label__1	Sometimes , he went down alone from Saturday to Monday ; sometimes his partner accompanied him ; sometimes , he merely strolled for an hour or two about the house and garden , saw that all was right , and returned to <NAME> again .
__label__0	It was evident that there , in the depths of these narrow gorges , perhaps even in the interior of <NAME> itself , was the proper place to pursue their researches .
__label__1	You are faint with the closeness of the room , and the heat of these lamps .
__label__1	I asked him afterwards , why he had done so , and he made a plausible excuse ; but since last night , father , and when I remember the circumstances by its light , I am afraid I can imagine too truly what passed between them. ’ ‘ Let me know , ’ said her father , ‘ if your thoughts present your guilty brother in the same dark view as mine. ’ ‘ I fear , father , ’ hesitated <NAME> , ‘ that he must have made some representation to <NAME> Blackpool—perhaps in my name , perhaps in his own—which induced him to do in good faith and honesty , what he had never done before , and to wait about the <NAME> those two or three nights before he left the town. ’ ‘ Too plain ! ’ returned the father .
__label__1	`` I do n't know , '' he said as he looked at me , `` what it is that sets me off again -- but -- bosh !
__label__0	interrupted <NAME> , desirous to keep his friends from losing their tempers in idle disputation .
__label__1	The moment my aunt was restored , she flew at <NAME> , and calling her a silly old creature , hugged her with all her might .
__label__1	The grass was coarse and high , but there was yet the spot on which they had so often sat together , when change and sorrow were but names .
__label__1	Though how this man knows it was a sham , is a wonder of wonders to me. ” “ Never you trouble your head about this man , ” retorted the contentious <NAME> ; “ you 'll have trouble enough with giving your attention to that gentleman .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> shed bitter tears , giving way to despair at the thought of having lost the only being he loved on earth .
__label__1	There was no doing it in the night , for there was no getting a light by easy friction then ; to have got one I must have struck it out of flint and steel , and have made a noise like the very pirate himself rattling his chains .
__label__0	What might it not do under the lead of <NAME> ?
__label__0	No time was lost in looking for a place suited for conversion into a temporary hospital , and one being found , the sick on board , to the number of twenty , were removed to it for treatment the very next day .
__label__1	They were always forgiving me , in their vanity and condescension .
__label__0	<NAME> undid the belt which encircled the body of <NAME> underneath the torn poncho , and feeling his breast-pocket , exclaimed : “ The case ! ” A cry of joy escaped from <NAME> .
__label__1	I could no more have removed my eyes from her pale face than I could have stirred from the bench on which I sat .
__label__0	But M. Jules Garnier states that a tradition exists of the appearance of two large ships , which had sent boats on shore , near the northern extremity of <NAME> .
__label__0	He would have given much of the gold before him for a little water -- for he had to replace what had been thrown overboard when the negro was carried up into the air .
__label__0	The doctor knew that the word <NAME> meant `` eater of raw fish '' ; but he knew too that this name is considered an insult in this country , so he forbore giving it to the inhabitants of <NAME> .
__label__1	`` Why , my dear Minerva , '' answered <NAME> with his old gay laugh , `` it is neither a rural nor a cheerful place ; and when the sun shines here , you may lay a pretty heavy wager that it is shining brightly in an open spot .
__label__1	To have been out in such a wind , and not to have known it was blowing !
__label__0	He was horrified , for on the evening before he could still stand upright .
__label__0	<NAME> , and you shall see our excellent guide at work . ''
__label__1	We write these words now , many miles distant from the spot at which , year after year , we met on that day , a merry and joyous circle .
__label__1	I never saw a sight so pitiful as this before !
__label__1	'Tell your governor that <NAME> and <NAME> is here , will you ? '
__label__1	<NAME> is in a new situation , and his prospects are very good indeed .
__label__1	‘ I respect you , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> with emotion .
__label__1	Not my fault ! ’ and to pass on before the instant had elapsed which was requisite to his recovery of the realities about him .
__label__0	Our drift , which had been south , down to the pole , was now north , and , if that direction should continue , perhaps we might be favoured with such good fortune as would make up for all the evil that had befallen us !
__label__0	395 Gigantic vegetation on the banks of the <NAME> .
__label__1	I have seen two of them safely out of bed .
__label__1	A little pincushion , a little housewife , a little book , a little workbox , a little set of tables and weights and measures , and a little woman , all in one .
__label__1	And I should have done it ( though I have been to see you more than once down at <NAME> , when you little thought of me ) but for my old comrade 's wife here , who I find has been too many for me .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , ’ said my aunt , ‘ attention ! ’ <NAME> recovered himself , with a blush .
__label__0	As to the distance that separated <NAME> from the <NAME> of <NAME> , they calculated it about a hundred miles .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> , in 38 degrees 42 minutes S .
__label__0	It skirted at some distance the summits of <NAME> , and at about half-past seven in the evening reached the circle of <NAME> .
__label__0	“ From the recitals of the <NAME> .
__label__0	This is the way they began : ‘ Come in !
__label__1	<NAME> is so shy as she gives it to him that they drop it between them and almost knock their foreheads together as they pick it up .
__label__0	`` _Mille noms d'un boulet ! _ '' cried <NAME> , wildly gesticulating .
__label__0	The fragment of ice was already nearly crossed when the wind changed , and the motion of the waves in the offing began to be felt , causing the officers to agree in urging a retreat into the shelter of the ice-walls , for there was some danger if the wind freshened of the vessel being embayed against the ice and beaten to pieces by the waves and floating _débris_ .
__label__0	It was probable that , having seen their vessel engulfed in the channel , they had fled into the interior of the island .
__label__0	I became intoxicated with a sense of lofty sublimity , without thought of the abysses into which my daring was soon about to plunge me .
__label__0	We must see where we go .
__label__1	A delightful walk it was ; for it was a pleasant afternoon in June , and their way lay through a deep and shady wood , cooled by the light wind which gently rustled the thick foliage , and enlivened by the songs of the birds that perched upon the boughs .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> went next to <NAME> , the most easterly town of <NAME> Proper ; on leaving it , after a ride of seven days through magnificent forests abounding in game , he came to the province of <NAME> .
__label__0	I saw clearly he was a dangerous individual , and I must take precautions against him. ” “ And since then ? ” “ Since then he has remained in his cabin without attempting to go out. ” “ That ’ s well , Tom. ” Just at this moment <NAME> and <NAME> were summoned to the saloon where breakfast , which they so sorely needed , was awaiting them .
__label__1	The grass was green above the dead boy ’ s grave , and trodden by feet so small and light , that not a daisy drooped its head beneath their pressure .
__label__0	`` But , '' asked <NAME> , `` might it not happen that some day the Pole should get farther from its place ? ''
__label__1	Thus , even while he trembled , and turned burning hot at the idea of speedy death , he fell to counting the iron spikes before him , and wondering how the head of one had been broken off , and whether they would mend it , or leave it as it was .
__label__1	<NAME> , on that unfortunate occasion , commits himself under provocation. ’ ‘ And under mulled wine , ’ added the old lady .
__label__0	Had he in his turn succumbed ?
__label__1	For a moment it was a strange face , and then it was all the faces. ’ ‘ And then it was gone ? ’ ‘ Yes ; and then it was gone. ’ ‘ Where were you then , old lady ? ’ ‘ Here , at the chest .
__label__0	The clocks had been stopped on board .
__label__1	These stairs are a part of the bridge ; they consist of three flights .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> , dearest , about young Fledgeby. ’ ‘ Oh no , don ’ t !
__label__1	<NAME> ! ’ The form moved , rose , advanced , and dropped upon its knees at his feet .
__label__1	<NAME> , M.P. , wishes to be informed ( with something of a second-hand air of seeing the <NAME> Gentleman at the head of the <NAME> in his place ) whether it is intended to be conveyed that the vanished person has been spirited away or otherwise harmed ?
__label__0	<NAME> could have withstood the tenderness with which <NAME> spoke these last words .
__label__1	I do not think I have ever experienced so strange a feeling in my life ( I am wiser now , perhaps ) as that of being with them , remembering how they had been employed , and seeing them enjoy the ride .
__label__1	But , in general , <NAME> has had no secrets from the bosom of affection -- I allude to his wife -- and has invariably , on our retirement to rest , recalled the events of the day .
__label__1	‘ All that has ever been in my mind , since I was married , ’ she said in a low , submissive , tender voice , ‘ I will lay bare before you .
__label__0	The boatswain was inclined to oppose us .
__label__0	But there were many malcontents who were ready to revolt against their authority , and it was while this bad spirit was abroad that the admiral arrived at <NAME> .
__label__1	She was quicker to perceive the slightest matter here , than in any other case -- but one .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> , open your eyes , that ’ s a love !
__label__1	In the fulness of time a milliner came in , and to her she repaired on her own behalf .
__label__1	I noticed the scantiest necessaries in the way of furniture ; a few old prints from books , of Chancellors and barristers , wafered against the wall ; and some half-dozen reticles and work-bags , `` containing documents , '' as she informed us .
__label__1	At two o ’ clock we took the railroad ; the travelling on which was very slow , its construction being indifferent , and the ground wet and marshy ; and arrived at <NAME> in time to dine that evening .
__label__0	The deliverance of <NAME> at the time when he was dying of exhaustion in the forest of <NAME> ; the hospitable reception he had met with at the fazenda , the meeting with <NAME> on the <NAME> frontier , his embarkation on the jangada ; and lastly , the fact that <NAME> had seen him somewhere before .
__label__1	I must beg you to take this back , <NAME> Weller. ’ Wery well , ’ said <NAME> , with a discontented look .
__label__0	`` <NAME> , as I read one evening in the <NAME> , speaks of the Arcadians of <NAME> having a tradition that their ancestors were so ancient that they inhabited the <NAME> long before the <NAME> had ever become our satellite .
__label__1	I have wronged thee , <NAME> , but I will right thee yet , I will indeed .
__label__1	To which the bird of prey slowly rejoined , ‘ And what might YOUR name be , now ? ’ ‘ This is my friend , ’ Mortimer <NAME> interposed ; ‘ Mr <NAME> Wrayburn. ’ ‘ Mr <NAME> , is it ?
__label__1	‘ Nobody ’ s at home at present , ’ returned the child , with a glib assertion of her dignity , ‘ except the person of the house .
__label__1	But let him look at me , in prison , and in bonds here .
__label__1	At last , the old woman and the niece came in , -- the latter with a head not easily distinguishable from her dusty broom , -- and testified surprise at sight of me and the fire .
__label__0	Here <NAME> fixed his residence , while <NAME> remained as Governor of <NAME> .
__label__1	“ All work is stopped , all assemble there , nobody leads the cows out , the cows are there with the rest .
__label__0	On that day they finished the bear , with some biscuits they found on the ship , and a few cups of tea ; then fatigue overcame them , and each one sank into a sound sleep .
__label__1	Now , will you ? ’ ‘ There ’ s something more to be told , ’ said <NAME> , as stony and immovable as ever .
__label__0	A prison-cage was established in the <NAME> , and speedily became full , night and day , of refractory offenders .
__label__1	‘ The young lady of whom you speak is , as you know , <NAME> , shortly to be married , ’ said <NAME> , gravely ; ‘ therefore your admiration , if it be of that special nature which you seem to indicate , is outrageously misplaced .
__label__1	‘ What did you wish to know next , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ What became of <NAME> ?
__label__1	Early as it was , on the windy March morning , the room in which he lay abed was already scrubbed throughout ; and between the cups and saucers arranged for breakfast , and the lumbering deal table , a very clean white cloth was spread .
__label__1	‘ A telling move with a good many , I dare say , but it won ’ t put ME off my guard .
__label__0	It was useless attempting to conceal from ourselves the fatal truth .
__label__0	<NAME> -- His early history -- His disappointment -- His change of nationality -- Preparations for the expedition -- Rio de <NAME> -- St. <NAME> 's Bay -- Revolt of a part of the squadron -- Terrible punishment of the guilty -- <NAME> 's <NAME> -- <NAME> -- The <NAME> -- The <NAME> -- <NAME> and the <NAME> -- Death of <NAME> -- <NAME> -- The <NAME> and their Productions -- Separation of the <NAME> and <NAME> -- <NAME> to <NAME> by the Cape of <NAME> -- Last misadventures .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , when a hackney coach had been called , and the ladies and the luggage hurried in , ‘ gang to the <NAME> ’ s Head , mun. ’ ‘ To the <NAME> ? ’ cried the coachman .
__label__0	On the next day but one the weather grew calmer ; observations were taken , and as they proved the vessel to have run a great distance from the <NAME> of <NAME> , the commander had to choose between a detention off the coast of <NAME> , or off the <NAME> .
__label__1	We must have <NAME> , you know .
__label__0	Could I retract my word , and take upon myself the responsibility of compromising the future of my companions ?
__label__1	Although her face was wonderfully composed , it was apparent that she was wholly taken by surprise , and that what she had expected to be taxed with , in connection with her small servant , was something very different from this .
__label__0	The two vessels then made for <NAME> , on the coast of <NAME> , in order to allow the malady to run its course , before proceeding to the <NAME> , where they were to complete provisioning .
__label__1	It ’ s my handsome daughter , living and come back ! ’ she screamed again , dropping on the floor before her , clasping her knees , laying her head against them , and still rocking herself to and fro with every frantic demonstration of which her vitality was capable .
__label__0	Their numbers seemed even greater , perhaps owing to the influx of the stragglers of the tribe .
__label__1	‘ Fanny is not going to live with us just now , father .
__label__1	There he found Mr Rugg .
__label__1	<NAME> Leicester is not aware that any client of <NAME> has been in need of his assistance .
__label__0	“ Thanks ! ” he murmured hoarsely , but <NAME> did not hear him , for both alike had dropped fainting on the sand .
__label__1	It became a part of my life , and as inseparable from my life as my own head .
__label__1	“ I passed you on the road ? ” “ <NAME> , it is true .
__label__1	Because I wish to see you always at your best .
__label__0	But <NAME> said no word to his companions ; that evening they made their accustomed halt , and their supper consisted only of coffee .
__label__1	The school reopened next day .
__label__1	Must he go wrong all through wi ’ this side , or must he go wrong all through wi ’ that , or else be hunted like a hare ? ’ ‘ Indeed , indeed , I pity him from my heart , ’ returned <NAME> ; ‘ and I hope that he will clear himself. ’ ‘ You need have no fear of that , young lady .
__label__1	This made him almost grave .
__label__1	‘ Confound you , what do you mean ? ’ said the stout man rising a little , and supporting himself on his elbow .
__label__1	I don ’ t see why he shouldn ’ t be .
__label__1	You do n't forget how happily and peacefully my life is all marked out for me , and by whom ?
__label__0	Would not their track betray them ?
__label__1	The furniture was not the same , and the figure in the chair was not himself .
__label__0	The possession which places <NAME> on a par with <NAME> is the <NAME> , containing the tomb of <NAME> .
__label__1	I was a listening. ’ ‘ Was you , indeed ? ’ said Mr Wegg , dubiously .
__label__0	The chain of <NAME> alone remained luminous , and seemed encircled by a golden halo .
__label__1	In the midst of her incoherence , she stops , looks at her daughter , cries out that her wits are going , and hides her face upon the bed .
__label__0	Our love of `` Science '' rests upon our admiration of intellect , only unfortunately the intellect is too often that of other people , not our own .
__label__1	said Mrs. Sowerberry : looking piteously on the charity-boy .
__label__0	The country was swarming with hundreds of birds , of which one species received the name of the `` <NAME> , '' from the exceeding brilliancy of its plumage .
__label__1	It is not in keeping .
__label__0	The latter reproached him in a contemptuous manner for having nothing to offer him , while pretending to be the subject of a rich and powerful king .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> surveyed the rooms he passed through , on his way downstairs , with the scrutinising eye of a landlord ; thinking it not impossible , that before long , they and their contents would be his property .
__label__1	‘ For no better reason , truly , than because I was thinking , ’ he said , after a pause , ‘ of something like it , when it came by .
__label__1	At the <NAME> at <NAME> , they stopped to dine ; upon which occasion there was more bottled ale , with some more <NAME> , and some port besides ; and here the case-bottle was replenished for the fourth time .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> was only rounded on the 26th .
__label__1	‘ If <NAME> ’ s creditors will not give him time , ’ said Mrs. Micawber , ‘ they must take the consequences ; and the sooner they bring it to an issue the better .
__label__0	“ You would think that there was a whole band of these ruffians , ” <NAME> kept saying , “ and we can ’ t lay hands on a single one of them. ” Search was made in all directions .
__label__1	I had thought about that , while we had been there side by side .
__label__1	cried the girl , pressing her hair back with her hands .
__label__1	Mr <NAME> had said once , that he believed she was a ‘ love-child ’ ( which means anything but a child of love ) , and that was all the information <NAME> could obtain .
__label__1	<NAME> ’ s part in the pageant was humble enough , her duties being limited to holding articles of costume until <NAME> was ready to try them on , and now and then tying a string , or fastening a hook-and-eye .
__label__0	As soon as we were all ready , we were to sail away to some distance to avoid the consequences of the explosion , the effects of which would certainly not be concentrated in the interior of the earth .
__label__1	I am so sorry for it , I am so unwilling to believe it , I have tried so earnestly not to see it , that it is very hard to tell , even to you .
__label__1	My appetite vanished instantly , and I knew no peace or rest until the day arrived .
__label__1	That ’ s all over long ago .
__label__0	In this crown are many precious stones , and one of priceless worth : `` so brilliant are they , '' says this traveller , `` that at night , there is no occasion for any further light than that thrown back by these jewels . ''
__label__1	“ I write with so much difficulty , the cold is so severe , I am so fearful of being detected and consigned to an underground cell and total darkness , that I must abridge this narrative .
__label__1	I wavered again , and began to think here were greater expectations than my own .
__label__0	But to this man , whose wish was , as he had said , to do more than his duty , there came an heroic thought .
__label__1	Do you hear him ? ’ ‘ I believe you are right , mother , ’ replied Alice , in a low voice .
__label__1	The gate at which they had entered , was softly unfastened and opened by <NAME> ; merely exchanging a nod with their mysterious acquaintance , the married couple emerged into the wet and darkness outside .
__label__0	The large cave was lighted by the <NAME> ’ s_ lamps , while several lanterns , suspended at intervals along the acclivity that led to their deserted quarters above , gave a weird picturesqueness to the scene , that might vie with any of the graphic descriptions of the “ <NAME> ’ Entertainments. ” “ How do you like this , <NAME> ? ” said <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> has many of these breakfasts , <NAME> , ’ resumed the new acquaintance -- ‘ “ feasts of reason , ” sir , “ and flows of soul , ” as somebody who wrote a sonnet to Mrs. Leo Hunter on her breakfasts , feelingly and originally observed. ’ ‘ Was _he_ celebrated for his works and talents ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
__label__1	'He is not in danger , I hope ? '
__label__0	But the joiners had soon to be replaced by carpenters .
__label__1	‘ We meet and part to-night , ’ she said .
__label__1	‘ Now , <NAME> , ’ cried <NAME> , quite unconscious that there was anything the matter .
__label__0	Yet , according to the accounts of <NAME> and <NAME> , this whole sea was open in the summer months .
__label__1	This being purely a labour of love , <NAME> readily complied , and leaving the room for the purpose , almost immediately returned , supporting a sleek personage with an oily face , who , bursting from him , and giving to view the form and face of <NAME> , made straight up to <NAME> , and tucking that poor fellow ’ s head under his arm in a most uncouth and awkward embrace , elevated his broad-brimmed hat at arm ’ s length in the air as a token of devout thanksgiving , exclaiming , meanwhile , ‘ How little did I think of this here joyful meeting , when I saw him last !
__label__0	`` In half an hour we shall be certain about that , '' answered the reporter .
__label__0	The sailors complained of it , and symptoms of scurvy appeared on board .
__label__1	‘ Won ’ t you say , some of us ? ’ ‘ Meaning , ’ returned the little creature , ‘ every one of you , but you .
__label__0	And , worst of all , his mother was in the hands of the <NAME> , and the cruel <NAME> had undertaken to make her speak when he wished !
__label__1	This preposterous forcing of unpleasant drinks down the reluctant throats of travellers is not at all uncommon in <NAME> , but I never discovered that the scruples of such wincing landlords induced them to preserve any unusually nice balance between the quality of their fare , and their scale of charges : on the contrary , I rather suspected them of diminishing the one and exalting the other , by way of recompense for the loss of their profit on the sale of spirituous liquors .
__label__1	So far as my small maid is concerned , I might suppose time to have stood for seven years as still as the mill did half an hour ago , since little Emma , <NAME> 's sister , is exactly what <NAME> used to be .
__label__0	They could not go on at all , and refused to eat the <NAME> , a poor , burnt-up sort of lucerne that grew there .
__label__0	If the current was interrupted the magnet immediately became unmagnetised .
__label__0	On our return to the coast the boatswain discovered several caverns in the granitic cliffs , sufficiently spacious to house us all and afford storage for the cargo of the <NAME> .
__label__1	“ It ’ s unekal , ” as my father used to say wen his grog worn ’ t made half-and-half : “ it ’ s unekal , and that ’ s the fault on it. ” ’ ‘ I think you ’ re right , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , after a few moments ’ reflection , ‘ quite right. ’ ‘ P ’ raps , now and then , there ’ s some honest people as likes it , ’ observed <NAME> , in a ruminative tone , ‘ but I never heerd o ’ one as I can call to mind , ‘ cept the little dirty-faced man in the brown coat ; and that was force of habit. ’ ‘ And who was he ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
__label__1	It will have gone down in another hour. ’ ‘ It will be rather unpleasant going at this rate in the dark , won ’ t it ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
__label__1	In the garden there was not a weed to be seen , and to judge from some dapper gardening-tools , a basket , and a pair of gloves which were lying in one of the walks , old Mr <NAME> had been at work in it that very morning .
__label__1	`` Would you allow me to get it filled for you ? ''
__label__0	A ship intended for the search of the <NAME> and the <NAME> , and of <NAME> ?
__label__0	A few hares , which they were able to shoot , appeared on the shores of the bay , as well as the arctic mice , the burrows of which were like a honeycomb .
__label__0	It is the coldest we have seen here yet ! ''
__label__0	Their last ration of water was given them , and drunk with more avidity than satisfaction , for it was filthy , disgusting stuff .
__label__0	He appeared before <NAME> , not as the accused , but as himself the accuser ; then , his fortitude giving way under the remembrance of the unworthy treatment he had experienced , this unfortunate great man wept , and caused those around to weep with him .
__label__0	The town is always full of people , who come to exact what they call presents , but what might with more justice be styled forced contributions .
__label__0	By what means had they managed to enter into peaceful relations with the savage tribes of the district , and their cruel and grasping chiefs ?
__label__0	“ I shall soon have the pleasure of presenting them with these bracelets as a <NAME> Year ’ s gift. ” “ Then you suspect -- ” “ Some folks who came out free in Her Majesty ’ s ships. ” “ What !
__label__0	J. T. <NAME> , <NAME> 's Peak , <NAME> ; and the fourth to the sub-director of the <NAME> , <NAME> .
__label__0	Above her head rustled the white sails , which seemed like great white wings .
__label__1	‘ She would have been proud of you .
__label__0	At any rate , it produced an abundance of useful plants , and a naturalist would have had a good opportunity of studying many specimens of the vegetable kingdom .
__label__1	‘ Hurrah ! ’ And then there was another roaring , like that of a whole menagerie when the elephant has rung the bell for the cold meat .
__label__1	He has exhausted his resources and is bound henceforward to the tree he has planted . ''
__label__1	Undertakings have been entered on , to swell the reputation of the <NAME> for vast resources , and to exhibit it in magnificent contrast to other merchants ’ <NAME> , of which it requires a steady head to contemplate the possibly -- a few disastrous changes of affairs might render them the probably -- ruinous consequences .
__label__1	Shall we terminate our conference for the night ? ” “ A moment more. ” “ An hour , if you please. ” “ Sir , ” said the nephew , “ we have done wrong , and are reaping the fruits of wrong. ” “ _We_ have done wrong ? ” repeated the <NAME> , with an inquiring smile , and delicately pointing , first to his nephew , then to himself .
__label__0	It is solid ground , not a liquid basin , that the <NAME> Practical Association has purchased .
__label__1	‘ I can not say , ’ replied <NAME> .
__label__0	The cannon ought to be planted in a country situated between 0 @ and 28 @ of N. or S. lat .
__label__1	It was a raw evening , and the misty river , blurred to the eye with blazing lights and to the ear with harsh noises , showed where the barges were stationed in which the smiths worked , making guns for the <NAME> of the <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ It will be enough to say that this was not the case ; that she was not happy ; that they fell into complicated distresses and difficulties ; that she came , twelve months before her death , to appeal to my old friendship ; sadly changed , sadly altered , broken-spirited from suffering and ill-usage , and almost broken-hearted .
__label__0	`` It 's a matter of organization , '' answered the doctor , `` and one which I ca n't explain .
__label__0	He asserts that the fatigued state of the crew , who were reduced by privations , and who in spite of everything had not ceased to work the pumps , had decided the captain to stop and buy some slaves to aid them in this work .
__label__0	On this account the operation was enveloped in a mystery that the cleverest detectives of <NAME> and <NAME> failed to penetrate , and if it was discovered at last it was because the <NAME> had relaxed his severity after the completion of the works , and that there are traitors or chatterers even among negroes .
__label__1	You ought to know better. ’ The letter was reluctantly produced ; and as I handed it to the old lady , I saw how the unwilling hand from which I took it , trembled .
__label__1	‘ Then why DO you wait ? ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	What could I do , but kiss away her tears , and tell her how I doted on her , after that !
__label__1	It was occasioned , I suppose , by the reverend nature of respectability in the abstract , but I felt particularly young in this man ’ s presence .
__label__0	We can not blame their conduct greatly , for after all , from what point of view can they have judged us ?
__label__0	<NAME> , he 's a wise fellow is <NAME> . ''
__label__1	We are to be married whenever we can , and then I shall go to Pa at the office and write to <NAME> .
__label__0	This argument cut short the harpooner 's recriminations .
__label__1	And yet a clearer-minded man don ’ t walk. ’ In spite of his respect for <NAME> , <NAME> could not help inwardly rejoicing at the absence of this sage , and devoutly hoping that his limpid intellect might not be brought to bear on his difficulties until they were quite settled .
__label__0	<NAME> was far from abundant ; of coal there was none ; trees and shrubs were few in number , and to cut them down in prospect of the cold seemed a very questionable policy ; but there was no doubt some expedient must be devised to prevent disaster , and that without delay .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> , understanding the message , after some twenty repetitions , tied a wet cloth round his head to sober himself , and , having partially succeeded , put on his green spectacles and issued forth .
__label__1	‘ What a world of gammon and spinnage it is , though , ain ’ t it ! ’ This was addressed confidentially to both of us , as the morsel of a hand came away from the face , and buried itself , arm and all , in the bag again .
__label__0	One thousand miles still separated him from <NAME> .
__label__1	On Monday next , on the arrival of the four o ’ clock afternoon coach at <NAME> , my foot will be on my native heath -- my name , <NAME> ! ’ <NAME> resumed his seat on the close of these remarks , and drank two glasses of punch in grave succession .
__label__1	Die who would , it would still remain the same ; these sights and sounds would still go on , as happily as ever .
__label__0	`` It is <NAME> of <NAME> , surnamed <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Then where _are_ you going , pretty one ? ’ ‘ Now I come to think of it , I don ’ t know , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	At the bottom of the immense cavity burrowed hundreds of small extinguished craters , riddling the soil like a colander , and overlooked by a peak 15,000 feet high .
__label__0	In the meantime , <NAME> de <NAME> , sent by the King and Queen of <NAME> to compliment <NAME> in their names , arrived at <NAME> with four vessels .
__label__0	This time , thanks to the power of their arms as well as to the richness of the presents offered to the <NAME> , the reception was different , and the versatile prince agreed to all the demands of <NAME> : namely , a monopoly of the trade in aromatics and spicery , and the right of seizure upon all vessels which should infringe this privilege .
__label__1	He left his brother to be happy .
__label__0	On board no preparations for departure were visible .
__label__1	Mrs. Bumble , seeing at a glance , that the decisive moment had now arrived , and that a blow struck for the mastership on one side or other , must necessarily be final and conclusive , no sooner heard this allusion to the dead and gone , than she dropped into a chair , and with a loud scream that <NAME> was a hard-hearted brute , fell into a paroxysm of tears .
__label__1	I returned at night by the same railroad and in the same kind of car .
__label__1	I have , in my possession , in his hand and pocket-book , several similar imitations of <NAME> ’ s signature , here and there defaced by fire , but legible to anyone .
__label__1	‘ There , poor dear ! ’ ‘ Oh well , <NAME> !
__label__1	' A little drop of spirits , master , if it 's all the same , ' replied <NAME> .
__label__1	“ I am glad I think so , <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ That is , <NAME> , when they took some of the trouble out of you-know-who ’ s head , and put it you know where , there was a -- ’ <NAME> made his two hands revolve very fast about each other a great number of times , and then brought them into collision , and rolled them over and over one another , to express confusion .
__label__1	But these solemn lessons which succeeded those , I remember as the death-blow of my peace , and a grievous daily drudgery and misery .
__label__1	‘ No , ’ the man assented in a surly way ; ‘ my letter -- it ’ s wrote by my daughter , but it ’ s mine -- is about my business , and my business ain ’ t nobody else ’ s business. ’ As <NAME> passed out at the gate with an undecided foot , he heard it shut behind him , and heard the footstep of the man coming after him .
__label__0	In one of these excursions , <NAME> met a band of itinerant musicians and _improvisatori_ .
__label__1	Yet <NAME> was in one of his sanguine states and in good spirits and was thoroughly pleased to see <NAME> again , whom he had always liked .
__label__0	`` Why may not there be something plausible in such a hypothesis ? ''
__label__0	It was ten o'clock in the morning .
__label__0	The crew obeyed the captain and <NAME> because they gave no orders but such as were of urgent necessity .
__label__1	Take my arm ! ’ Then leaning on Mr Merdle ’ s arm , did Mr Dorrit descend the staircase , seeing the worshippers on the steps , and feeling that the light of Mr Merdle shone by reflection in himself .
__label__0	`` Well then , my boy , '' he said , `` lean on my arm , and we will stroll along the beach . ''
__label__0	The maiden depended on no one else , and had but to give the consent of her own heart .
__label__0	They had been wise in unloading the <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Of his general expectations here , ’ assented Mr Carker , dumbly as before .
__label__0	His admirable discovery led to many another .
__label__1	It was for me to smile .
__label__0	The <NAME> indeed possessed in the highest degree what may be called “ the memory of the eye. ” The <NAME> , on the contrary , appeared especially organized to listen and to hear .
__label__1	The water rose and rose as the sluice poured in , dispersing the scum which had formed behind the lumbering gates , and sending the boat up , so that the sculler gradually rose like an apparition against the light from the bargeman ’ s point of view .
__label__1	She was not , indeed , withheld by the same considerations as her agreeable friend ; for , having recently removed into the neighborhood of <NAME> from the remote but genteel suburb of <NAME> , she was not under the same apprehension of being recognised by any of her numerous acquaintances .
__label__0	At last , after trying for five minutes , he managed to utter this word : -- `` _Porpoise_ . ''
__label__0	This would have been contrary to <NAME> ’ s instructions .
__label__1	Have you any idea of any cause that can have overset him ? ’ ‘ You surprise me !
__label__1	I bore the weight of all our little cares , and all my projects ; <NAME> held the pens ; and we both felt that our shares were adjusted as the case required .
__label__1	‘ I am a demd villain ! ’ cried <NAME> , smiting himself on the head .
__label__0	That was where our picks tore out the last bit of coal in the seam .
__label__0	`` I would not trust you , '' replied <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ You will restrain any demonstrative championship or vengeance in this place , of course , <NAME> ? ’ said she , looking over her shoulder at me with the same expression .
__label__1	‘ I have not the least desire or intention to distinguish myself in that way .
__label__1	Upon the top of the bank was a low brick wall , surmounted by an iron railing .
__label__0	`` Yes , '' repeated J. T. <NAME> incessantly , whose confidence gained over everybody , `` our friends are clever people , and they can not have fallen like simpletons .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> , having shaved himself before a looking-glass of minute proportions , then marches out , bare-headed and bare-chested , to the pump in the little yard and anon comes back shining with yellow soap , friction , drifting rain , and exceedingly cold water .
__label__1	She could have choked in right good earnest , at the thought of being so humbled .
__label__0	Let us omit nothing on our part to give him the chance of rejoining us. ” “ May God grant it as you say , <NAME> ! ” replied the doctor , with much emotion .
__label__1	When she first saw me , might she not be a little shocked and disappointed ?
__label__1	As he could read in it , however , no additional information or anything to lead him to believe he had spoken falsely ; and as Mr <NAME> , left to his own meditations , sighed deeply , and was evidently growing maudlin on the subject of Mrs <NAME> ; the dwarf soon broke up the conference and took his departure , leaving the bereaved one to his melancholy ruminations .
__label__1	So dearly do I love the scene of my poverty and your kindness .
__label__1	It brushes the <NAME> cobwebs away , and pleases the <NAME> .
__label__0	Hans , the guide , who was half upset by the shock , was scarcely able to keep down a cry of pain and grief .
__label__0	Majestically the panorama of both banks moved along without a pause , as though some ingenious mechanism necessitated its unrolling in the opposite direction to that of the stream .
__label__1	<NAME> left it with the landlady , and was returning to pull his master ’ s boots off , after drying himself by the kitchen fire , when glancing casually through a half-opened door , he was arrested by the sight of a gentleman with a sandy head who had a large bundle of newspapers lying on the table before him , and was perusing the leading article of one with a settled sneer which curled up his nose and all other features into a majestic expression of haughty contempt .
__label__0	<NAME> and <NAME> , although they knew they ran the risk of being cut off , had not left their post , both that they did not wish to show themselves as yet to their assailants , and expose themselves to the “ <NAME> ’ s ” guns , and that they relied on Neb and <NAME> , watching at the mouth of the river , and on <NAME> and <NAME> , in ambush among the rocks at the <NAME> .
__label__0	The escort was commanded by <NAME> .
__label__0	If we are really near land , I should be afraid to approach it in the dark. ” The count expressed his approval of the lieutenant ’ s caution , and thereupon all sail was shortened so as to keep the _Dobryna_ from making any considerable progress all through the hours of night .
__label__0	How are we to know whither chance will carry us ?
__label__1	He had neither eaten nor drunk since last night , and , in addition to the anxiety of mind he had undergone , had been travelling about , from place to place almost incessantly , for many hours .
__label__1	‘ You ’ ll soon get the better of it , dear , ’ rejoined the friend .
__label__0	A pretext being necessary , he spread a rumour that the traveller was taking cannons and ammunition to <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> and <NAME> appeared an instant after at the threshold , almost at the same moment as <NAME> entered the room .
__label__0	After crossing the mountains that separate <NAME> from <NAME> , the <NAME> traveller entered the country , made famous by the valour of <NAME> , and studied its manners and customs with the care and attention that were among his most striking characteristics .
__label__1	He is more courted than anyone else .
__label__1	They did not so engross his attention , but that he saw , with gratitude , how the elder Mr Chivery kept the Lodge clear of prisoners ; how he signed to some , with his keys , not to come in , how he nudged others with his elbows to go out , and how he made his misery as easy to him as he could .
__label__1	That will be his place , -- there , ” striking the table with her stick , “ at my head !
__label__1	Many a night he vaguely and unhappily wandered there , when wine had brought no transitory gladness to him ; many a dreary daybreak revealed his solitary figure lingering there , and still lingering there when the first beams of the sun brought into strong relief , removed beauties of architecture in spires of churches and lofty buildings , as perhaps the quiet time brought some sense of better things , else forgotten and unattainable , into his mind .
__label__1	At length they arrived at the large stone .
__label__1	But , then , the thought darted across his mind that it was barely eleven o'clock ; and that many people were still in the streets : of whom surely some might be found to give credence to his tale .
__label__1	Although I am not disposed to maintain that the being born in a workhouse , is in itself the most fortunate and enviable circumstance that can possibly befall a human being , I do mean to say that in this particular instance , it was the best thing for <NAME> that could by possibility have occurred .
__label__0	`` But since the half-breed 's revelations about <NAME> -- '' `` Ah !
__label__1	At length there was a cry of silence , and a breathless look from all towards the door .
__label__1	Fortunately , however , the papers with his agents here being all sealed up and locked up , as he left them when he providentially came to <NAME> , the affairs are in that state of order that they can wait until my brother <NAME> recovers his health in <NAME> , sufficiently to come over , and administer , or execute , or whatever it may be that will have to be done. ’ ‘ He couldn ’ t have a better nurse to bring him round , ’ Mr <NAME> made bold to opine .
__label__0	They have even calculated -- -- '' `` Oh , dear ! ''
__label__1	‘ I am so blest , <NAME> -- my heart is so overcharged -- but there is one thing I must say. ’ ‘ Dearest , what ? ’ She laid her gentle hands upon my shoulders , and looked calmly in my face .
__label__0	You will see that the area is approximately four hundred and seven thousand square miles .
__label__1	That ’ s a cautious fellow. ’ ‘ He is a very cautious fellow indeed , ’ returned <NAME> .
__label__0	Then , infested with poulps , medusae , and cuttle-fish , they would become immense centres of infection , since their waves would not possess 'these vast stomachs that <NAME> had charged to infest the surface of the seas . ' ''
__label__1	<NAME> hung upon the eyelids of the child so long , that , when she awoke , <NAME> was already decorated with her large bonnet , and actively engaged in preparing breakfast .
__label__0	All the blocks of ice detached by our passage went the same way , and after two or three bounds , ingulfed themselves in the crevasse , as in the jaws of the minotaur , only the jaws of the minotaur closed after each morsel , while the unsatiated crevasse yawned perpetually , and seemed to await , before closing , a larger mouthful .
__label__0	He has , then , no longer any fear of his adversary ! ''
__label__1	‘ Ha ! ’ said the <NAME> , leaning back in his chair with his hand in his breast .
__label__1	And at seven o ’ clock P.M. <NAME> and his friends , and <NAME> and his wife , respectively retired to their private sitting-rooms at the <NAME> , opposite the <NAME> , <NAME> , where the waiters , from their costume , might be mistaken for Westminster boys , only they destroy the illusion by behaving themselves much better .
__label__1	There was mutton , a steak , and an apple-pie -- nothing in the remotest way connected with ganders -- and the dinner went on like a disenchanted feast , as it truly was .
__label__1	‘ Why , then , I ’ ll tell you one , ’ said <NAME> , throwing his pipe into the fire , and raising his voice .
__label__0	It was from the sides , by means of long boathooks or props thrust against the bed of the stream , that the jangada was kept in the current , and had its direction altered when going astray .
__label__1	<NAME> , this has been a dreadful day !
__label__1	“ Or I 'll have your heart and liver out. ” He tilted me again .
__label__1	During this interval , I glanced at <NAME> again , and observing the same expression on his face , and his eyes still directed to the distant light , I touched his arm .
__label__1	First , he took the two secret men .
__label__1	There yet remained a slight scar upon his face , and whenever he was recognised , as he was almost every minute by people sauntering in and out , he made a restless effort to conceal it with his glove ; showing how keenly he felt the disgrace he had undergone .
__label__0	`` The difficulty is , '' said the doctor , `` the bears seem to me very rare and very wild ; they are not civilized enough to come within gun-shot . ''
__label__1	If that was bad , I am sorry ; but you repeat it after consideration , and that seems to me to be at least no better .
__label__1	Mr <NAME> , after writhing about , in a great many strange attitudes , and often twisting his face and eyes into an expression like that which is usually produced by eating gooseberries very early in the season , was by this time awake also .
__label__1	I thought it had the most dismal trees in it , and the most dismal sparrows , and the most dismal cats , and the most dismal houses ( in number half a dozen or so ) , that I had ever seen .
__label__0	“ What did <NAME> do ? ” he repeated .
__label__1	It was what was always being dinned into you and me at school ; it ’ s what goes down best .
__label__1	The elder child remained with her father when the rest had gone away , and made his tea for him -- happy little house-keeper she was then ! -- and sat conversing with him , sometimes at the window , sometimes in the room , until the candles came .
__label__1	“ <NAME> 's your mother ? ” “ There , sir ! ” said I .
__label__0	But on this evening a looker-on might have observed that , even before the curtain rose , there was unusual animation among the audience .
__label__0	He had begun to take some nourishment .
__label__1	Then I told how that I was on my way to seek my niece , and they told me what manner of gentlefolks was in the house , and I waited to see any as seemed like her , going in or out .
__label__0	He seemed to be torn by a supreme convulsion .
__label__1	‘ Oh , my dear <NAME> , ’ cried <NAME> , wringing her hands as she ran up to embrace her , ‘ to think that you and <NAME> should be ruined !
__label__0	The fit lasted five hours .
__label__1	`` Well , sir , '' says the trooper , looking into his hat after another disconcerted pause , `` I am sorry not to have given you more satisfaction .
__label__1	“ Take that message back , and they will know that I received this , as well as if I wrote .
__label__1	We have arrngd for your being forded , carriage free , pr eight o'clock coach from <NAME> , on Monday morning next , to <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , where one of our clks will be in waiting to convey you to our offe as above .
__label__1	As his own position was not a very pleasant one until the matter was set at rest one way or other , he did so ; and <NAME> , plying her snuff-box at a most wasteful rate , corroborated his account .
__label__1	There was the smiting of the rock , and the gushing forth of the waters ; and there was a temperate man with ‘ considerable of a hatchet ’ ( as the standard-bearer would probably have said ) , aiming a deadly blow at a serpent which was apparently about to spring upon him from the top of a barrel of spirits .
__label__1	I swear it before the God that saw it !
__label__1	`` No , sir , '' I said , `` I do n't think I shall , '' really not seeing on consideration why I should be .
__label__1	But the turnpike-man gave him a meal of bread and cheese ; and the old lady , who had a shipwrecked grandson wandering barefoot in some distant part of the earth , took pity upon the poor orphan , and gave him what little she could afford -- and more -- with such kind and gentle words , and such tears of sympathy and compassion , that they sank deeper into <NAME> 's soul , than all the sufferings he had ever undergone .
__label__0	Before entering upon further explanation , he said that he counted upon the cordial co-operation of them all for the common welfare .
__label__1	Well , Mr Clennam , he addresses himself to the Government .
__label__1	`` So he tells me , '' returned my guardian .
__label__1	I hardly know how I got down , but I was soon at the bottom , and climbing , with two <NAME> officers who were crossing and had joined me , over some broken rocks , deafened by the noise , half-blinded by the spray , and wet to the skin .
__label__1	`` Dear mother , are you so resolved ? ''
__label__1	As one might go to survey the weather and the general aspect of the heavenly bodies .
__label__0	The sand of this desert is so fine that its particles are almost impalpable , and the action of the wind causes it to accumulate into heaps ten or twenty feet high , divided by deep valleys .
__label__1	‘ I have seen enough , ’ said <NAME> , as he threw himself into a chair in his little apartment .
__label__0	All clamoured for a return to the north .
__label__1	In the capital of the <NAME> ’ s name and dignity , such a child was merely a piece of base coin that couldn ’ t be invested -- a bad Boy -- nothing more .
__label__1	In the mean time , ma ’ am , I am of opinion , if you ask me my opinion , that the less she is talked about , the better. ’ The same evening , Mrs. Sparsit , in her chamber window , resting from her packing operations , looked towards her great staircase and saw <NAME> still descending .
__label__0	Not satisfied , however , with what he looked upon as too perfunctory an estimate , he measured , with all possible mathematical accuracy , the <NAME> or <NAME> , and ascertained its height to be no less than 27,500 feet .
__label__0	The <NAME> correspondent was named <NAME> .
__label__0	The engineer made a turning-lathe , with which he turned several articles both for the toilet and the kitchen , particularly buttons , the want of which was greatly felt .
__label__0	Paganel could not stand any more .
__label__1	Your necessities are greater than mine . ''
__label__0	From the 19th to the 20th of February the circle of investigation was extended to all the northern region of <NAME> , whose most secret nooks were explored .
__label__0	He felt within him the sacred fire of genius , he worked on unceasingly , he visited influential persons , spreading his ideas and defending them , and combating all objections with the most heroic energy .
__label__0	He was brought , indeed , very nearly lifeless on to the beach .
__label__0	He brought the news that in company with <NAME> and four other persons , he had reached a great river called the <NAME> , flowing towards the south .
__label__1	She ’ d deny it , and so would my master .
__label__1	Produced by <NAME> By <NAME> Book the First -- Recalled to <NAME> the Second -- the <NAME> Book the Third -- the Track of a Storm Book the First -- Recalled to Life I .
__label__0	His eyes slowly opened and then closed again , pained by the glare of light .
__label__1	‘ This fellow -- I grieve to say my brother ’ s son : a reprobate and profligate , stained with every mean and selfish crime -- this fellow , coming here today to disturb a solemn ceremony , and knowing that the consequence of his presenting himself in another man ’ s house at such a time , and persisting in remaining there , must be his being kicked into the streets and dragged through them like the vagabond he is -- this fellow , mark you , brings with him his sister as a protection , thinking we would not expose a silly girl to the degradation and indignity which is no novelty to him ; and , even after I have warned her of what must ensue , he still keeps her by him , as you see , and clings to her apron-strings like a cowardly boy to his mother ’ s .
__label__0	On the 5th August the <NAME> flotilla again put to sea and made 1200 miles west-north-west .
__label__1	You will presently see that we ca n't be too private .
__label__0	The sailors were advised to wear only one woollen shirt over their cotton shirts , and to hermetically close their seal cloaks .
__label__1	‘ I ’ ll be even with you. ’ ‘ Approach me again , you -- you -- you <NAME> of infamy , ’ gasped <NAME> , ‘ and if your head is human , I ’ ll break it .
__label__1	Meanwhile , and pending the arrangement of the proceedings , and a fair division of the speechifying , the public in the large room were eyeing , by turns , the empty platform , and the ladies in the <NAME> .
__label__1	On a healthy autumn day , the <NAME> prisoner , weak but otherwise restored , sat listening to a voice that read to him .
__label__0	Nothing but that was wanted to cap the climax !
__label__0	The corvette advanced some minutes to westward , and the apparatus , provided with air , bore the same explorers to the depths of the ocean .
__label__1	‘ None of it , ’ answered <NAME> .
__label__1	At all events , I will shut out the world with the bedclothes , and try. ’ <NAME> crossed the staircase to his raw and foggy bedroom , and was soon ready for bed .
__label__1	I have been carted out of <NAME> in the dead of night , and carried leagues away from it packed in straw .
__label__0	“ I will tell you why it seems so .
__label__0	`` <NAME> , '' said <NAME> , taking the sailor 's hand , `` we will build another _Bonadventure_ -- a larger one .
__label__0	The low coast of <NAME> , scarcely emerging from the sea , was not more than fifteen miles distant .
__label__1	Upon my word , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ I scarcely slept all last night through thinking of doing this ; and could not make up my mind when I was out , whether to do it or not ; and yet I am sure it is the true feeling of my heart , and I should have been quite miserable afterwards if I had not relieved it. ’ His honest voice and manner corroborated what he said , and quite established its ingenuousness .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> ’ t go on posturing like a Deaf and <NAME> , ’ said the ingenious Fledgeby , ‘ but express yourself like a <NAME> -- or as nearly as you can. ’ ‘ I had had sickness and misfortunes , and was so poor , ’ said the old man , ‘ as hopelessly to owe the father , principal and interest .
__label__0	The “ <NAME> ” now appeared in full view , with a spring on her cable , her head to the north , presenting her larboard side to the island .
__label__1	She will repeat it , in character , <NAME> , to-morrow morning. ’ ‘ In character ! ’ ‘ As <NAME> .
__label__0	We embraced each other heartily .
__label__0	Things were in this feverish state on the evening of the 14th , when , all at once , <NAME> 's dispatch arrived in <NAME> .
__label__1	I am as obstinate as one , I am more stupid than one , I get as much pleasure as one , and I should like to kick like one. ’ ‘ Not me , I hope , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , <NAME> ; I wouldn ’ t hurt _you_ .
__label__0	At the expiration of two months and a half the ribs had been set up and the first planks adjusted .
__label__1	What _could_ the boy be crying for ?
__label__1	The damsel held her peace , however , when an early messenger bore the request of <NAME> Koeldwethout next morning , and modestly retired to her chamber , from the casement of which she watched the coming of the suitor and his retinue .
__label__1	Indeed , it may be said of <NAME> , that one half of it appears to be burnt down , and the other half not to be built up .
__label__0	It did not follow the routes of the <NAME> and the <NAME> exactly , for they proved fatal to <NAME> d'Urville .
__label__1	‘ Ay ay , we ’ ll take care of the old woman .
__label__0	If so , <NAME> and his companions would escape scot free , except for a few vigorous douche baths .
__label__1	Think of this now , <NAME> and Mrs. Micawber .
__label__1	<NAME> would bark and caper round us , and go on before , and look back on the landing , breathing short , to see that we were coming .
__label__1	She supposed that we were following her , but as soon as the space was left clear , we approached the woman sitting by the fire to ask if the baby were ill. She only looked at it as it lay on her lap .
__label__0	“ May I ask you what is the most distant date when we may expect the relieving army ? ” “ Six days at most , sir , ” replied the <NAME> .
__label__0	`` My dear <NAME> , how can a judge give a wise sentence in a clerk 's wig ? ''
__label__1	`` My dearest <NAME> , '' asked <NAME> , `` why not ? ''
__label__1	“ You may get cheated , robbed , and murdered in <NAME> .
__label__1	In a wild incautious way I hurried there , and there -- with the horror of the death I had escaped , before my eyes in its most appalling shape , added to the inconceivable horror tormenting me at that time when the poisonous stuff was strongest on me -- I perceived that <NAME> had been murdered by some unknown hands for the money for which he would have murdered me , and that probably we had both been shot into the river from the same dark place into the same dark tide , when the stream ran deep and strong .
__label__0	They consisted principally of casuarinas and eucalypti , some of which next year would yield a sweet manna , similar to the manna of the <NAME> .
__label__0	To this <NAME> had very little trouble in finding an answer .
__label__0	Well , perhaps a stone -- '' And the sailor , raising a heavy block , was about to break in one of the sides of the chest , when the engineer arrested his hand .
__label__0	The vessel is hardly anchored when the <NAME> leaves her and makes for <NAME> 's Wharf at <NAME> as hard as ever his men can pull !
__label__1	His red hair hung down upon his bloodless face ; his beard was torn , and twisted into knots ; his eyes shone with a terrible light ; his unwashed flesh crackled with the fever that burnt him up .
__label__1	Let us make the friendly move of agreeing to look for it together .
__label__1	exclaimed the old lady , starting ; 'do n't talk in that way , child .
__label__1	‘ This happy idea , brave sir , ’ <NAME> resumed after drinking , ‘ was a happy idea for several reasons .
__label__1	Here is a poor lad who has never felt a parent ’ s care , who has scarcely known anything all his life but suffering and sorrow , presented to a man who he is told is his father , and whose first act is to signify his intention of putting an end to his short term of happiness , of consigning him to his old fate , and taking him from the only friend he has ever had -- which is yourself .
__label__0	If I take your deposit it must be in gold -- all gold .
__label__0	As to his sailor qualification , he was said to be skillful enough in navigating these seas , whose reefs make them very dangerous .
__label__0	They were a large kind of `` chaluts , '' like those on the <NAME> coasts , great pockets that the waves and a chain fixed in the smaller meshes kept open .
__label__1	I ses 'yes I can ' I ses .
__label__0	But these questions are of too much importance to be allowed to remain long unsettled. ” “ No !
__label__0	With a sigh I discovered that the bottom was still wholly invisible .
__label__0	The captain could not be relied on to restrain them ; the wretched man tore his hair and wrung his hands .
__label__0	As they climbed they were astonished to perceive every few moments a kind of vibration in the soil .
__label__0	The fleet had neither corn nor meat , and they could not make up their minds to feed upon the tortoises that abound in that part of the coast .
__label__1	He mended his pace , keeping his eyes upon the light with a strange intensity , as if he were taking aim at it .
__label__1	Grandfather Smallweed inquires of <NAME> , <NAME> 's twin sister .
__label__0	`` This scene , '' adds Laing , `` both by its nature and the sentiment which it inspired , formed an agreeable contrast with the noise , confusion , and the dissipation which pervaded a Timmannee town at the same hour ; but one must not trust too much to appearances , and I regret to add , that the subsequent conduct of the <NAME> natives did not confirm the good opinion which I had formed of them . ''
__label__1	The lodging was rather confined as to space , but I fancied that if Mrs. <NAME> 's household had been the only lodgers in <NAME> <NAME> 's or <NAME> 's , the sole advantage they would have found in the size of the building would have been its affording a great deal of room to be dirty in .
__label__0	cried the astonished and bewildered Professor .
__label__0	<NAME> someone wish to prevent <NAME> from troubling himself either uselessly or otherwise ?
__label__0	After a stay in April at the mouth of the <NAME> , the explorers surveyed the Liu-Kiu archipelago , a chain of islands connecting <NAME> with <NAME> , and the Bonin-Sima group , districts in which no animals were seen but big green turtles .
__label__1	Your father has absconded—deserted you—and you mustn ’ t expect to see him again as long as you live. ’ They cared so little for plain <NAME> , these people , and were in that advanced state of degeneracy on the subject , that instead of being impressed by the speaker ’ s strong common sense , they took it in extraordinary dudgeon .
__label__1	Therefore -- eh , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , sir. ’ ‘ Therefore , I call upon you both , to -- I think that ’ s the course , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , Sir. ’ ‘ To -- to -- what , <NAME> ? ’ said the magistrate pettishly .
__label__0	The <NAME> never moved a muscle of his face .
__label__1	The <NAME> stepped back in this emergency , with more agility than could have been anticipated in a man of his apparent decrepitude ; and , seizing up the pot , prepared to hurl it at his assailant 's head .
__label__0	<NAME> sank prostrate on the ground , and clasped his hands despairingly .
__label__0	There was good sense in <NAME> 's words ; I could not deny the fact .
__label__0	The journey was resumed at six in the morning ; the guide hoped to reach <NAME> by evening .
__label__1	‘ That was judicious , ’ remarked <NAME> ; ‘ and what else ? ’ ‘ I fretted and fumed all next day , and raised a great disturbance , ’ rejoined the old gentleman .
__label__1	It lay heavier on my breast than if I had been a most atrocious criminal , I dare say .
__label__1	I rely on that promise .
__label__1	‘ And I insist on being separated and left to myself , ’ said <NAME> , sobbing .
__label__1	From my point of view , he was the wrong twin all the time , and only externally like the <NAME> of <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> ’ t you be a fool and provoke me , <NAME> , but mind what you ’ re doing , and do it. ’ <NAME> , who was at heart in great fear of his sister , sulkily bent over his writing again , and listened as she said : ‘ If I determined that the clerk ought not to come , of course he wouldn ’ t be allowed to come .
__label__1	This lady had a basket with her , and she hadn ’ t known what to do with it , for a long time , until she found that on account of my legs being short , it could go underneath me .
__label__1	'Yes , I know you are , ' said the gentleman : 'You 're hungry too , a n't you ? '
__label__1	‘ I congratulate you , <NAME> , ’ said Mr <NAME> , who had meditated this neat address while coming along , ‘ on the day. ’ Mrs <NAME> thanked him with a magnanimous sigh , and again became an unresisting prey to that inscrutable toothache .
__label__0	After having passed the precipice , <NAME> , the reporter , and <NAME> prudently stepped aside to stop and take breath .
__label__1	‘ Now , if old <NAME> had entertained the most remote or distant idea of the state of the affections of <NAME> , he would just have razed the school-room to the ground , or exterminated its master from the surface of the earth , or committed some other outrage and atrocity of an equally ferocious and violent description ; for he was a terrible old fellow , was <NAME> , when his pride was injured , or his blood was up .
__label__1	'Yes , ' said the old lady , looking up for a moment from the broth ; 'that 's a portrait . '
__label__0	The doctor reacted against the gloominess of the situation and retained all the coolness and self-possession of a disciplined heart .
__label__1	They all four gathered socially about the little table , and took tea under that young lady ’ s active superintendence ; and the presence of <NAME> in the back parlour , brightened the <NAME> frigate on the wall .
__label__0	If we were schoolboys , we should all be skinned alive for our ignorance !
__label__0	At a height of about 31 feet the nature of the ground changed without becoming more practicable .
__label__1	How do they call her ?
__label__1	These have been his relations towards me .
__label__0	<NAME> , looking him straight in the face , continued : “ Yesterday , after the interview you had with <NAME> , my husband , you came to me and called me -- mother !
__label__0	In the neighbouring woods was heard the unpleasant cry of the lyre-pheasant and of two other birds , which feebly imitate the tinkling of a hand-bell and the jarring noise of the saw .
__label__0	`` Mere cattle stop the trains , and go by in a procession , just as if they were not impeding travel !
__label__0	It was now light , although the sun had not yet risen above the horizon .
__label__1	That a letter should be written to <NAME> early next morning , and forwarded per <NAME> , requesting his consent to <NAME> and <NAME> ’ s remaining at <NAME> , for the purpose and with the object already assigned , and begging an answer by the next coach -- , if favourable , the aforesaid parties to remain accordingly , and if not , to return to <NAME> immediately on the receipt thereof .
__label__0	I morally press the hand you refuse me .
__label__1	Yours have been of a much slighter kind , spread over a much shorter time .
__label__1	They had no other friends or home to leave , he said , and had come to share his fortunes .
__label__1	‘ You may make it necessary , if you are foolish or obstinate , <NAME> , ’ he observed , ‘ for me to send my daughter abroad again , for a term ; but I have a better opinion of you .
__label__1	He turned his thoughts back to the starting-point of this unknown injury ; and in the meantime <NAME> , having rolled his green packet pretty round , cut it carefully into three pieces , and laid it on a plate as if it were some particular delicacy .
__label__1	The quantity of walking exercise I took , was not in this respect attended with its usual consequence , as the disappointment counteracted the fresh air .
__label__0	In the centre stood an immense table , covered with pamphlets , amongst which were some newspapers , already of old date .
__label__1	On one of the back benches , remote in the subdued light and the strangeness of the place , sat the villainous whelp , sulky to the last , whom he had the misery to call his son .
__label__1	Seemed to scent a creditor .
__label__1	There were small gardens in front which , being wholly neglected in all other respects , served as little pens for the dust to collect in , until the wind came round the corner and blew it down the road .
__label__0	Then an irresistible drowsiness crept over their brain .
__label__1	<NAME> could not but assent again .
__label__1	The bulk of his property he divided into two equal portions -- one for <NAME> , and the other for their child , if it should be born alive , and ever come of age .
__label__1	And he said , Now , this schoolroom is a Nation .
__label__0	He was a man of thirty years , simply clad .
__label__1	Of unjust treatment in detention and hardship , and in cruel separation from his wife and child , he foreshadowed the likelihood , or the certainty ; but , beyond this , he dreaded nothing distinctly .
__label__0	Much more learned men than his nephew would have found it rather hard to refute his facts and arguments .
__label__1	Be good -- deserve it -- and abide by <NAME> 's instructions. ” She looked at me , and looked at <NAME> , and <NAME> 's countenance wrung out of her watchful face a cruel smile .
__label__1	After <NAME> had fixed a day for his departure to <NAME> , these symptoms increased ; and it became evident that something was in progress which affected the peace of the young lady , and of somebody else besides .
__label__0	The steward stood behind her chair , and waited to clear away , but she saved him the trouble by appropriating the plate and napkin .
__label__1	'Bayton , ' said the undertaker , looking from the scrap of paper to <NAME> .
__label__0	These petticoats , which are kept for grand occasions , are often inherited like diamonds , and are handed down from generation to generation .
__label__0	The movement set him thinking .
__label__1	Had he looked with greater interest and with a father ’ s eye , he might have read in her keen glance the impulses and fears that made her waver ; the passionate desire to run clinging to him , crying , as she hid her face in his embrace , ‘ Oh father , try to love me !
__label__1	‘ So good-bye , <NAME> , ’ said my aunt , ‘ and take care of yourself !
__label__1	Your manner , which I must say does not seem intended to propitiate , induces me to think it possible .
__label__0	Well , what succeeded with him collapsed with me. ” “ Collapsed ! ” exclaimed <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> had the shell been opened when the cat leaped out , slightly bruised , but full of life , and exhibiting no signs whatever of having made an aerial expedition .
__label__1	I want to speak to you. ’ ‘ In earnest , <NAME> of the secret chamber ? ’ asked <NAME> , clearing her pretty face .
__label__0	From what the travellers could learn , it was pretty certain that <NAME> would not let them go without exacting a considerable ransom .
__label__1	These crawling things had fascinated my attention , and I was watching them from a distance , when <NAME> laid a hand upon my shoulder .
__label__0	It recalled to Pencroft the day on which he lighted his only match , and all the anxiety of the operation .
__label__0	I owe you -- -- ” “ <NAME> ! ” answered <NAME> , “ you owe me nothing !
__label__1	But their self-forgetfulness charmed me .
__label__1	The best work and the worst , the plainest and the richest , the stateliest and the least imposing -- both of <NAME> ’ s work and <NAME> ’ s -- all found one common level here , and told one common tale .
__label__1	It is among their dignities .
__label__0	They could not but heartily admire his energy , which was only equaled by the young girl ’ s devotion .
__label__0	The elements , after having handled them so roughly , seemed now disposed to favor them to the utmost .
__label__1	Although <NAME> and <NAME> met daily under the <NAME> roof , nothing at any time passed between them having reference to <NAME> , after the time , more than half a year gone by , when <NAME> mutely showed the <NAME> Canon the conclusion and the resolution entered in his Diary .
__label__1	‘ Run on -- nothing to the hours , days , weeks , months , years , when we ’ re united -- run on -- they ’ ll fly on -- bolt -- mizzle -- steam-engine -- thousand- horse power -- nothing to it. ’ ‘ Can ’ t -- can ’ t we be married before to-morrow morning ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
__label__0	He ran forward , then returned , and seemed to entreat them to hasten their steps .
__label__0	He was everywhere received with cordial congratulations from officers , soldiers , and citizens .
__label__0	In order to testify his gratitude to the captain he plunged his fingers into a bag at his waist , and offered to anoint his hair with the tainted oil it contained .
__label__1	He took out of his pocket the most respectable hunting-watch I ever saw , and preventing the spring with his thumb from opening far , looked in at the face as if he were consulting an oracular oyster , shut it up again , and said , if I pleased , it was half past eight .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> said , ‘ Oh , <NAME> , <NAME> , this is really very careless ! ’ and piled them up afresh for him ; and this time , by dint of balancing them with great nicety , <NAME> got out of the room , and down a few stairs before two of them escaped again .
__label__1	`` It MUST be very good of Mrs. Jellyby to take such pains about a scheme for the benefit of natives -- and yet -- <NAME> and the housekeeping ! ''
__label__1	And yet his misgivings were not so dark as , imagined by the light of this later time , they would appear .
__label__0	They would have surely concluded that their present velocity would never be able to take them as far as the neutral point , not to talk of passing it .
__label__0	I said at last , coming to myself .
__label__0	It was to be feared that a terrible climax would occur on the summit of the tower , which rose three hundred and fifty-seven feet above the pavement .
__label__0	The Inventory -- Night -- A few Letters -- Continuation of the Search -- Plants and Animals -- <NAME> in great <NAME> -- On <NAME> -- The Departure -- <NAME> -- A Gleam of <NAME> -- Lost on the Sea -- A timely Light .
__label__0	“ And after that , why not golden wedding number two ? ” “ You would like a couple of fifties , would you , <NAME> ? ” said <NAME> .
__label__1	Now , if you will fetch any authorised neighbouring somebody to do it in return for my opening the door , I ’ ll open the door .
__label__1	‘ Indeed , ma ’ am ! ’ replied <NAME> , timidly .
__label__0	“ Oh ! ” ejaculated the astonished friends .
__label__1	In time my eyes gradually shut up ; and , from seeming to hear the clergyman singing a drowsy song in the heat , I hear nothing , until I fall off the seat with a crash , and am taken out , more dead than alive , by <NAME> .
__label__0	She hoisted no flag at her mizzen-peak .
__label__0	The darkness of the night added to the horrors of the situation , without hiding the ice which glowed in the last light of the evening .
__label__1	‘ In such good spirits ! ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	There was nothing for it , but to turn back and begin all over again .
__label__0	I communicated my fears and observations to <NAME> .
__label__1	Lastly , <NAME> was a prey to such slow musical madness , that when , in course of time , she had taken off her white muslin scarf , folded it up , and buried it , a sulky man who had been long cooling his impatient nose against an iron bar in the front row of the gallery , growled , “ Now the baby 's put to bed let 's have supper ! ” <NAME> , to say the least of it , was out of keeping .
__label__1	‘ Now , my life , ’ said <NAME> , taking her on his knee , ‘ tell me all about it. ’ All very well to say , ‘ Tell me all about it ; ’ but <NAME> was very much confused .
__label__1	<NAME> , sure of foot and strong of will , had so pressed onward , that the year enjoined by the old Instrument-maker , as the term during which his friend should refrain from opening the sealed packet accompanying the letter he had left for him , was now nearly expired , and <NAME> began to look at it , of an evening , with feelings of mystery and uneasiness .
__label__1	All through the night the wind blows , and abates not .
__label__1	I can not bear it , ’ said <NAME> , at once with a burst of tears , and a stamp of her little foot ; ‘ I shudder with horror of him , and I have come to you to protect me and all of us from him , if you will ? ’ ‘ I will , ’ cried <NAME> , with a sudden rush of amazing energy .
__label__0	All the passengers had got out of the train , the wheels of which were stained with blood .
__label__1	He wants the stick , now and then : it 'll do him good ; and his board need n't come very expensive , for he has n't been overfed since he was born .
__label__1	When the <NAME> had finished her toasting , she spread a clean cloth on a tray , and brought him some crisp slices and a great basin of weak tea , with which ( she said ) the doctor had left word he might refresh himself when he awoke .
__label__1	Mrs <NAME> ’ s first visit to the <NAME> ’ s bride at the new abode of <NAME> , was a grand event .
__label__0	The sky , covered with clouds , seemed to be laying in supplies for a fresh deluge .
__label__1	<NAME> , my love , you are by far the best loved of the three ; I have had you principally in my mind -- whatever I have done for your sake , my dear child , I have done freely and without murmuring. ’ Only the wisdom that holds the clue to all hearts and all mysteries , can surely know to what extent a man , especially a man brought down as this man had been , can impose upon himself .
__label__0	asked M'Nicholl and <NAME> in some astonishment .
__label__1	The elder <NAME> was in bed , I found , and <NAME> was milling his chocolate , which a melancholy little boy who was an apprentice -- it seemed such a curious thing to be apprenticed to the trade of dancing -- was waiting to carry upstairs .
__label__1	‘ I fear , ’ said <NAME> , hesitating , ‘ that mama -- my mother , I mean -- is waiting for me. ’ ‘ You needn ’ t make the least apology , my dear , ’ said <NAME> , smiling sweetly as she spoke ; ‘ I dare say she is a very respectable old person , and I shall be quite -- hem -- quite pleased to know her. ’ As poor Mrs. <NAME> was cooling -- not her heels alone , but her limbs generally at the street corner , <NAME> had no alternative but to make her known to <NAME> , who , doing the last new carriage customer at second-hand , acknowledged the introduction with condescending politeness .
__label__1	I was with him when he was sick and well , rich and poor .
__label__0	Just as they entered the <NAME> they encountered an immense number of whales , and the sailors were so terrified by their size and number , that they wished to fly ; it was not without much difficulty that <NAME> at last prevailed upon them to advance boldly , and they soon scattered their formidable enemies .
__label__1	<NAME> Inspector Bucket of the <NAME> has not yet struck his great blow , as just now chronicled , but is yet refreshing himself with sleep preparatory to his field-day , when through the night and along the freezing wintry roads a chaise and pair comes out of <NAME> , making its way towards <NAME> .
__label__0	Again you are right , <NAME> , ” said <NAME> .
__label__0	They hardly allowed themselves a moment 's repose , and the glare of the flames which shot from the crater enabled them to work night and day .
__label__1	‘ I ’ m not a going to hurt you .
__label__1	As they proceed with great gravity through the streets towards the region of <NAME> , <NAME> , observing his companion to be thoughtful , considers it a friendly part to refer to Mrs. Bagnet 's late sally .
__label__1	I only want you to do well , and to be comfortable. ” “ Well , then , understand once for all that I never shall or can be comfortable -- or anything but miserable -- there , <NAME> ! -- unless I can lead a very different sort of life from the life I lead now. ” “ That 's a pity ! ” said <NAME> , shaking her head with a sorrowful air .
__label__1	But if such shadows flit before him to his bewilderment , there is one other shadow which he can name with something like distinctness even yet and to which alone he addresses his tearing of his white hair and his extended arms .
__label__0	`` They are pretty numerous , '' replied <NAME> ; `` but they are so small and they move with such enormous velocity that they are very seldom seen .
__label__1	I have had enough of arguing to last one man his life . ''
__label__0	`` Such a fall , '' answered <NAME> , `` according to the calculations of <NAME> and <NAME> , would develop an amount of heat equal to that produced by sixteen hundred globes of burning coal , each globe equal in size to the earth itself .
__label__0	But we are going up -- going up , still going up .
__label__0	The car , which renders the management easy , had not then been invented , and a circular gallery was placed around the lower and contracted part of the <NAME> balloon .
__label__1	I felt that no one -- mother , sister , wife -- could honour him more than I. I did , indeed !
__label__1	If you will hold the candle for <NAME> , my friend , he 'll soon see whether there is anything to help you . ''
__label__0	“ <NAME> ! ” cried <NAME> ; “ for a simple merchant , <NAME> , you handle the hunter ’ s knife in a most masterly fashion. ” “ Most masterly , indeed , ” added <NAME> .
__label__0	But the surrounding ocean was deserted as far as the eye could reach , and the colonists must rely on themselves for regaining their native land .
__label__1	‘ You have heard <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , turning to me .
__label__1	<NAME> , <NAME> , run , in <NAME> ’ s name !
__label__0	Its powers of adjustability seemed to fail before the strange and bewildering scene .
__label__1	`` Hope , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , Precedent , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> .
__label__0	With the thick bark still covering them , they looked none the worse .
__label__1	You are to be a proctor .
__label__0	A question of life or death was now to be decided .
__label__1	Other men 's fathers may have died of the rheumatism or may have taken base contagion from the tainted blood of the sick vulgar , but the <NAME> family have communicated something exclusive even to the levelling process of dying by dying of their own family gout .
__label__0	I dwelt upon the fact that it was not necessary for all twenty-three to embark .
__label__0	There was still a height of a thousand feet to overcome .
__label__0	He already saw the moment when he would be at last allowed to think of his mother , of <NAME> , of himself !
__label__1	As to our table , you wo n't find that bad , I hope , for it will be supplied from our coffee-house here , and ( it is only right I should add ) at your expense , such being <NAME> 's directions .
__label__1	Say then , madame ! ’ Under this ferocious banter , she sat breathing harder , and her mouth was disturbed .
__label__1	‘ Your uncle ’ s time is very valuable , my dear ; and however desirous you may be -- and naturally desirous , as I am sure any affectionate relations who have seen so little of your uncle as we have , must naturally be to protract the pleasure of having him among us , still , we are bound not to be selfish , but to take into consideration the important nature of his occupations in the city. ’ ‘ I am very much obliged to you , ma ’ am , ’ said <NAME> with a scarcely perceptible sneer .
__label__1	he asked aloud , winking at us and pointing at her as she turned away , affecting to sweep the grate .
__label__1	`` The airs the fellow gives himself ! ''
__label__1	Is he at home ? ’ ‘ Mr Rokesmith is at home , ’ said <NAME> ; ‘ indeed , ’ pointing through the window , ‘ there he stands at the garden gate .
__label__0	I was powerless , almost unconscious .
__label__1	‘ Yes , <NAME> , ’ resumed <NAME> , ‘ it is. ’ Here , bending towards <NAME> , he whispered in a deep , hollow voice , ‘ A Buff ball , <NAME> , will take place in <NAME> to-morrow evening. ’ ‘ God bless me ! ’ exclaimed <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> suspicion may exist without that connexion . ''
__label__0	<NAME> drew on ; the sun ’ s disc , enlarged by refraction , was dipping blood-red below the horizon .
__label__0	His conduct and intelligence gave a favourable idea of the inhabitants of the <NAME> .
__label__1	All the people of the village were at the fountain , standing about in their depressed manner , and whispering low , but showing no other emotions than grim curiosity and surprise .
__label__1	`` We went our several ways , '' said <NAME> , `` and had little in common even before we agreed to differ .
__label__0	He will soon come to his senses , ” said <NAME> , quietly .
__label__1	But bearing in mind that them were which I meantersay of a stunning and outdacious sort , -- alluding to them which bordered on weal-cutlets and dog-fighting , -- a sincere well-wisher would adwise , <NAME> , their being dropped into your meditations , when you go upstairs to bed .
__label__1	‘ What can I do for you , sir ? ’ ‘ You can shake hands with me , <NAME> , if you please , ’ said I , putting out my own .
__label__0	Nevertheless he was still sad and reserved , and joined more in the work than in the pleasures of his companions .
__label__1	I am better by myself. ” If I was to be put upon my oath to-morrow , <NAME> , before a magistrate , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ I have no doubt I could venture to swear to those identical words. ’ Miss Tox expressed her admiration by saying , ‘ My Louisa is ever methodical ! ’ ‘ In short , <NAME> , ’ resumed her aunt , ‘ literally nothing has passed between your poor <NAME> and myself , until to-day ; when I mentioned to your Papa that <NAME> and <NAME> had written exceedingly kind notes -- our sweet boy !
__label__1	Your aunt is an old lady , <NAME> , and it ’ s what you must have looked for , often. ’ This consolatory farewell , <NAME> accompanied with a look of heartfelt anguish ; and being left alone with the two children again , and becoming conscious that the wind was blowing mournfully , she indulged in melancholy -- that cheapest and most accessible of luxuries -- until she was overpowered by slumber .
__label__1	The man , after looking at me for a moment , turned me upside down , and emptied my pockets .
__label__0	I scarcely dared to lower my eyelids , fearing to lose the last spark of this fugitive light .
__label__0	The <NAME> had dragged his companion towards the entrance of the <NAME> , and showed him the prairie , making him understand that now was the time when it was clear from the wolves ; but that not a moment was to be lost , for should this maneuver not succeed , it would only render the situation of those left behind more desperate , and that he knew his horse well enough to be able to trust his wonderful lightness and swiftness to save them all .
__label__0	They then jumped back , but almost at the same instant they rushed together , and with their left hands seized each other by the shoulder -- never to leave go again .
__label__1	He advanced to meet them , and tenderly obliging the old man to lean upon his arm , conducted him with slow and trembling steps towards the house .
__label__1	Why , he ’ s an uglier-looking thief than can be seen anywhere for a penny .
__label__0	After a few days ' stay their number increased rapidly , and they became , if not dangerous , at least a nuisance .
__label__1	`` My dear ma'am , '' returns <NAME> , moving across the small apartment , `` the humble individual who now addresses you received that young lady in <NAME> when she first came here from the establishment to which you have alluded .
__label__0	“ <NAME> me again about this Nicholas .
__label__1	Then to go back , you know , and find him in the same cramped place. ’ ‘ Ah yes !
__label__1	He inquired particularly after Mr Merdle .
__label__0	At these words the four men started after <NAME> , in the midst of blinding cinders ; they reached the end of the fiord , a little place ten feet broad , where the waves were gently breaking .
__label__1	Some evil-minded person who had seen him come upstairs with a handsome watch in his hand , perhaps .
__label__0	The joists grated on all sides .
__label__1	why <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Because , ’ said Mrs. Crisparkle , retiring on first principles , ‘ he came home intoxicated , and did great discredit to this house , and showed great disrespect to this family. ’ ‘ That is not to be denied , <NAME> .
__label__0	“ These vampires have a particular instinct which leads them to bleed you in the places where the blood most easily comes , and principally behind the ear .
__label__0	When his services were not required , either for carrying wood or for climbing to the top of some tree , <NAME> passed the greatest part of his time in the kitchen , where he endeavoured to imitate Neb in all that he saw him do .
__label__0	Had he been free , his master knew he would have fled away to the north as fast as his legs would have carried him .
__label__0	Birds , subsisting only on scraps thrown out to them did not cease to follow the population in its migration , and so numerous did they become that multitudes of them had repeatedly to be destroyed .
__label__0	His eyes would close , and in a tone of mild reproach he would answer : “ Why leave our home ?
__label__1	In vain did the eager <NAME> , and the enthusiastic <NAME> , do all that skill and experience could suggest , to regain the ground <NAME> had lost in the contest -- it was of no avail ; and in an early period of the winning game <NAME> gave in , and allowed the superior prowess of All-Muggleton .
__label__1	Having had great experience of the sex , and being perfectly acquainted with all those little artifices which find the readiest road to their hearts , Mr Chuckster , on taking his ground , planted one hand on his hip , and with the other adjusted his flowing hair .
__label__1	Though it has not yet finally disappeared , it is dwindling daily .
__label__1	To have struggled with him in the street , or to have exacted any lower recompense from him than his heart 's best blood , would have been futile and degrading .
__label__1	The boat had returned , and his guard were ready , so we followed him to the landing-place made of rough stakes and stones , and saw him put into the boat , which was rowed by a crew of convicts like himself .
__label__1	Their pride in these girls , and their submission of themselves to all their whims , was the pleasantest little testimony to their own worth I could have desired to see .
__label__0	`` What on earth is the matter with us ? ''
__label__1	So strange to have lived to his time of life , and yet to be beginning like a boy this summer morning !
__label__1	‘ I promise , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	cried <NAME> ; `` a fine breeze is blowing from the north-east , which will soon do our business for us . ''
__label__1	Men talk of <NAME> as an abstract thing , and lose sight of what is natural while they do so .
__label__0	It was just before we left <NAME> that I came to this decision .
__label__0	At this moment seven men of the crew , mute and immovable as ever , mounted the platform .
__label__1	What do you mean by this noise , you hussies ? '
__label__0	Once the winter had set in , none of us could have escaped from that most terrible of fates -- dying of cold .
__label__0	There was now eight feet of the opening above the water .
__label__0	In order to make their way through some thickets , they were obliged to cut down trees .
__label__1	I say this , because what I must bid you to do for <NAME> 's sake , is the hardest thing to do of all .
__label__0	Not knowing the number of the island ’ s inhabitants , they might suppose that <NAME> was defended by a large party .
__label__1	It reflects disgrace on no one living , except you who use it .
__label__1	'You will , ' said <NAME> , after a pause , 'take some money from me , which may enable you to live without dishonesty -- at all events until we meet again ? '
__label__0	“ I will go , too , brother , ” said the young girl .
__label__1	‘ You mean something more , as concerns myself and my intention .
__label__1	See how the rotten beams are tumbling down , and how the patched and broken windows seem to scowl dimly , like eyes that have been hurt in drunken frays .
__label__1	'Ca n't I be supposed to feel -- _I_ as brought him up porochially -- when I see him a-setting here among ladies and gentlemen of the very affablest description !
__label__0	This town was all in ruins and desolate , for the armies of the barbarians had been there , and <NAME> could not remain in it , but wished to go westward to the frontier of <NAME> .
__label__1	It was a cross-country road , full , after the first three or four miles , of holes and cart-ruts , which , being covered by the snow , were so many pitfalls to the trembling horses , and obliged them to keep a footpace .
__label__0	He knew this , but he also knew that he would certainly surmount them .
__label__1	‘ Was he not , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ You know he was not. ’ ‘ He was , ’ cried the woman .
__label__0	The whole southern slope of the <NAME> Alps poured its liquid masses into this single bed .
__label__1	Meanwhile , <NAME> enjoyed unmolested the full flavour of the gold knob at the top of his cane , as he would have done to the end of the interview if <NAME> had not come home , and caused the conversation to turn to his favourite topic .
__label__0	Give me that cord , <NAME> !
__label__1	In the agonies of composition , the elderly gentleman looked sometimes at the carpet , sometimes at the ceiling , and sometimes at the wall ; and when neither carpet , ceiling , nor wall afforded the requisite degree of inspiration , he looked out of the window .
__label__1	‘ On wi ’ ‘ em , ’ said <NAME> , forcing the wrong arm into the wrong sleeve , and winding the tails of the coat round the fugitive ’ s neck .
__label__0	I saw little of the <NAME> ; he was at work .
__label__1	I see it in your face. ’ They went into the nearest room , where <NAME> gave him the letter to read .
__label__1	It still increased , until our horses could scarcely face the wind .
__label__1	And how can I pay ?
__label__1	She dreamed of seeking her father in wildernesses , of following his track up fearful heights , and down into deep mines and caverns ; of being charged with something that would release him from extraordinary suffering -- she knew not what , or why -- yet never being able to attain the goal and set him free .
__label__0	“ Under the circumstances , he must know that you have a right to make a requisition of his goods. ” “ No , no , ” quickly rejoined <NAME> ; “ we will not do that .
__label__0	And by this reply from the engineer : -- `` We shall find one at the corral . ''
__label__1	‘ That is a black shadow to be following the girl , ’ said <NAME> , standing still ; ‘ what does it mean ? ’ He spoke in a low voice that sounded almost strange to <NAME> .
__label__0	Make a start , like a good fellow . ''
__label__0	`` Is Conseil going to risk it ? ''
__label__1	You must squeeze them , sir , or our connection will not continue to be as satisfactory as I could wish it to be to all parties .
__label__1	Shall I make any more apologies , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Not one , ’ replied that gentleman .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , I was in the way , was I ? ’ <NAME> smiled again , but made no answer .
__label__1	It ’ s only necessary to consider his history here , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ to know that. ’ ‘ He ’ s a monster of meanness ! ’ said my aunt .
__label__0	In short , the result was satisfactory , and the settlers had no reason to complain .
__label__1	They were not so successful as I could have wished ; for though the advantages of the school were undeniable , my aunt had not approved of any of the boarding-houses proposed for me .
__label__0	`` No , no , '' replied <NAME> ; `` I shall stop at <NAME> -- at least for some days . ''
__label__1	‘ You are always kind-hearted , and anxious to help the oppressed , my dear mother , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ so you will be favourably disposed towards him , I know. ’ ‘ I am sure , my dear <NAME> , ’ replied Mrs. Nickleby , looking very hard at her new friend , and bending to him with something more of majesty than the occasion seemed to require : ‘ I am sure any friend of yours has , as indeed he naturally ought to have , and must have , of course , you know , a great claim upon me , and of course , it is a very great pleasure to me to be introduced to anybody you take an interest in .
__label__1	They won ’ t do over here .
__label__0	The ground trembled , while these molten waves , launching into the sky their wreaths of smoke , evaporated the moisture of the mould and hurled it upward through the vent-holes of the stone lining in the form of dense vapor-clouds .
__label__0	We must have seen each other somewhere ? ” “ I do not think so , ” quickly answered <NAME> .
__label__1	That was the thing he had set his heart upon .
__label__1	Behold me here to prevent it ! ’ ‘ <NAME> is coming here ? ’ said <NAME> , with a smile .
__label__1	<NAME> bowed again and sat down ; his father looking round , he continued -- ‘ The gov ’ nor , sir , has drawn out five hundred and thirty pound. ’ ‘ Reduced counsels , ’ interposed <NAME> , senior , in an undertone .
__label__0	This parlour was the principal apartment of the burgomaster 's house , which was one of the pleasantest in <NAME> .
__label__0	He next visited <NAME> and took advantage of the information gathered on the spot , to write a short history of <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> .
__label__0	Far from picking up the wounded and the able-bodied men , who were trying to save themselves by swimming , the <NAME> , `` making way with sails set on the foremast , across the heads which were to be seen in the water , pierced some with lances , and also discharged their cannon over them . ''
__label__0	“ Oh , <NAME> , she is charming , ” exclaimed <NAME> , “ a thousand times too charming , and if I must tell you all , she would please me better if she were less so .
__label__1	'The boy next , ' said <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> and <NAME> ’ s warehouse was at the waterside .
__label__1	It was a great point too that <NAME> himself was flattered by the sensation he created , and after several efforts to preserve his gravity , burst into a loud roar , and so stood with his mouth wide open and his eyes nearly shut , laughing violently .
__label__1	But we held our own without any appearance of molestation .
__label__0	There was no wood to be found , however , but fortunately the rocks were covered with a poor , dry species of lichen .
__label__1	He entreated her , for her father 's sake , never to seek to know whether her father had become oblivious of the existence of the paper , or had had it recalled to him ( for the moment , or for good ) , by the story of the <NAME> , on that old Sunday under the dear old plane-tree in the garden .
__label__1	In that intent <NAME> will persevere , as his duty is .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> to see <NAME> Rosa. ’ This is the announcement of the parlour-maid in chief .
__label__0	<NAME> Dr. Ferguson have used two balloons , his chances of success would have been increased ; for , should one burst in the air , he could , by throwing out ballast , keep himself up with the other .
__label__0	Had he been made of pasteboard , with wheels on his paws , he would not have made less noise during his stay .
__label__1	There are bad people in it , Mr <NAME> , but if there were no bad people , there would be no good lawyers .
__label__1	When he did throw his head back , and take it off quick , I had a horrible fear , I confess , of seeing him meet the fate of the lamented <NAME> , and fall lifeless on the carpet .
__label__1	<NAME> mak ’ st me humbly wishfo ’ to be more like thee , and fearfo ’ to lose thee when this life is ower , and a ’ the muddle cleared awa ’ .
__label__0	said an ingenious naturalist , `` in which the animal kingdom blossoms , and the vegetable does not ! ''
__label__0	`` I can tell , '' replied my uncle , in a sharp and doctorial tone .
__label__0	“ No mistake about that , sir , ” replied <NAME> ; “ a <NAME> would rattle his castanets at the cannon ’ s mouth. ” “ But what is the meaning of it all ? ” asked the captain , more puzzled than before .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> was meditating ; it might be that the insects brought to mind , some painful passage in his own past life .
__label__1	‘ I have been telling <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , as the majestic lady came stalking up , ‘ that I have become , by a curious chance , Mr <NAME> ’ s Secretary or man of business. ’ ‘ I have not , ’ returned <NAME> , waving her gloves in her chronic state of dignity , and vague ill-usage , ‘ the honour of any intimate acquaintance with Mr Boffin , and it is not for me to congratulate that gentleman on the acquisition he has made. ’ ‘ A poor one enough , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	Beyond this bank the country was dotted with large and small lakes , much as those of <NAME> , <NAME> , and other black-watered lagoons .
__label__1	Then , he blessed me and stood waving his hand to me until I had passed the crook in the road ; and then I turned into a field and had a long nap under a hedge before I pursued my way home .
__label__0	`` A little more , '' said the doctor , `` and with a few trees I might imagine myself at <NAME> , or even in the hanging-gardens at <NAME> . ''
__label__0	In certain places the current flows with the speed of two miles and a half an hour .
__label__0	Less fortunate than his female companion , the poor fellow had received a frightful shock and his life was evidently in great danger .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> put his dead glove , which scarcely seemed to have any hand in it , on my fingers , and then on my guardian 's fingers , and took his long thin shadow away .
__label__0	The Captain soon saw this , by noticing with what difficulty <NAME> was panting .
__label__0	<NAME> consoled himself by saying that with the help of a mine they could soon open out the cliff when that was necessary , and then , as there was evidently nothing to be done in the gulf , he steered his vessel towards the strait and passed out at about two o'clock in the afternoon .
__label__1	Consequently says he , ‘ And , gentlemen , when the timbers of the <NAME> of the State are unsound and the Man at the <NAME> is unskilful , would those great <NAME> , who rank among our world-famed merchant-princes -- would they insure her , gentlemen ?
__label__1	It not only doubles up Mrs. Smallweed 's head against the side of her porter 's chair and causes her to present , when extricated by her granddaughter , a highly unbecoming state of cap , but the necessary exertion recoils on <NAME> himself , whom it throws back into HIS porter 's chair like a broken puppet .
__label__0	Hence he resolved to get on at any price a few degrees farther north ; seeing that he could neither try rowing with his crew exhausted , nor going under sail with the wind always unfavorable , he ordered the fires to be lighted .
__label__0	<NAME> threatened these exhausted men .
__label__1	Holly , mistletoe , red berries , ivy , turkeys , geese , game , poultry , brawn , meat , pigs , sausages , oysters , pies , puddings , fruit , and punch , all vanished instantly .
__label__0	“ My master is lost ! ” cried <NAME> .
__label__1	He might not be so gently dealt with outside as he is there .
__label__1	He had risen , as his father had before him , in the course of life and death , from <NAME> to <NAME> , and for nearly twenty years had been the sole representative of the Firm .
__label__1	How dare you appeal to me just now , you false rascal , as if we had been in discussion together ? ’ As we stood , front to front , I saw so plainly , in the stealthy exultation of his face , what I already so plainly knew ; I mean that he forced his confidence upon me , expressly to make me miserable , and had set a deliberate trap for me in this very matter ; that I couldn ’ t bear it .
__label__1	“ No ; nor will she miss now , ” cries The <NAME> , petulantly .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , sir ! ’ replied the young lady sharply , smiling though as she turned aside , and biting her lip , ( whereat Mrs. <NAME> , who was still standing on the stairs , glanced at her with disdain , and called to her husband to come away ) .
__label__0	Every day , the reporter and <NAME> , who had been voted purveyors to the colony , devoted some hours to the chase .
__label__1	As much as to say , `` <NAME> , we remember your existence when you are not here to remind us of it by your presence .
__label__0	But in 1514 <NAME> had asked the king to bestow upon him as a reward for his services the title of <NAME> of <NAME> , and it was this imprudent step which gave an advantage to his adversaries .
__label__1	All this she did without looking at me .
__label__0	It has been said that in the morning of the 2d of July the jangada had arrived at <NAME> d ’ Olivença , where they turn out in thousands those long strings of beads which are made from the scales of the _ “ coco de piassaba. ” _ This trade is here extensively followed .
__label__1	No ; he said confidently , no !
__label__1	‘ I never contemplated anything of this kind ; never dreamt of the possibility of it .
__label__0	But then the two rivals in popularity shook hands heartily and parted on terms of intimate friendship .
__label__0	<NAME> did not know what to make of him .
__label__0	He then retired , and closed the door .
__label__1	He had repeatedly said he would have everybody ’ s life , and become in effect the last man .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> , promise me you will. ” ‘ “ I do , I do , ” said the man , throwing himself passionately on his knees before her .
__label__0	`` Real polar stomachs , '' answered the doctor ; `` prodigious stomachs which can be dilated at will , and , I ought to add , can be contracted in the same way , so that they support starving as well as gorging .
__label__0	Then <NAME> went up to <NAME> .
__label__0	I had no heart for this bad fortune .
__label__0	Indeed it was not an ape , it was a human being , a man .
__label__0	These , all industriously copied into the evening papers , the people were carefully reading over again , some with honest regret , some deriving a great moral lesson from an attempt exceedingly reprehensible in every point of view , but most , we are sorry to acknowledge , with a feeling of ill concealed pleasure .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> had been idle a long time , and had just poured out his last glassful of wine with as complete an appearance of satisfaction as is ever to be found in an elderly gentleman of a fresh complexion who has got to the end of a bottle , when a rattling of wheels came up the narrow street , and rumbled into the inn-yard .
__label__1	<NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , shading his face with his hand , ‘ has always been my favourite child. ’ The blustrous <NAME> crimsoned and swelled to such an extent on hearing these words , that he seemed to be , and probably was , on the brink of a fit .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> was in high feather and spirits , but a little nervous withal .
__label__0	The chaste daughters of <NAME> willingly left the slopes of <NAME> and <NAME> at his call .
__label__1	For such variety of reasons , <NAME> 's was at that time , as to <NAME> intelligence , a kind of <NAME> ; and this was so well known to the public , and the inquiries made there were in consequence so numerous , that <NAME> 's sometimes wrote the latest news out in a line or so and posted it in the <NAME> windows , for all who ran through <NAME> to read .
__label__0	The travelers , at a distance of twenty-four miles ( reduced to four by their glasses ) could admire this vast crater in its entirety .
__label__0	“ Yes , <NAME> , ” replied <NAME> , “ Kai-Koumou is left alone with the warriors of his canoe .
__label__1	‘ Did you ever see a ghost ? ’ was the sullen retort .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> gazed on it in silence .
__label__1	Let it be. ” “ But , <NAME> .
__label__0	Not only had <NAME> announced that he would attain his object—and now the capital at his command enabled him to reach it without hindrance—but he would certainly not have appealed for funds if he was not certain of success .
__label__1	I am subject to -- gout '' -- <NAME> was going to say indisposition and would have said it to anybody else , but <NAME> palpably knows all about it -- '' and recent circumstances have brought it on . ''
__label__0	It was on a narrow platform placed above the telescope that the two savants passed their existence , execrating the day which hid the moon from their eyes , and the clouds which obstinately veiled her during the night .
__label__0	Towards five o ’ clock day began to break .
__label__0	The extumescences on the plain became more and more marked .
__label__0	From this point its course was pursued through a forest of magnificent trees .
__label__1	`` He was put there , '' says Jo , holding to the bars and looking in .
__label__1	But Mr Carker -- ’ ‘ Hush ! ’ said <NAME> , glancing cautiously up at the packer ’ s , and at the bottle-maker ’ s , as if , from any one of the tiers of warehouses , Mr Carker might be looking down .
__label__1	We had no more purchases to make now ; I had completed all his packing early in the afternoon ; and our time was disengaged until night , when he was to go to <NAME> for <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Is he as soft as ever ?
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> , however , thought some vague streaks of intermittent light which were perceived in the night , between the 14th and 15th , probably proceeded from a volcano which might be that of <NAME> , as the crater frequently emits flames .
__label__1	‘ Speak up like a man , since you are a man , and tell us about yourself and this Combination. ’ ‘ Wi ’ yor pardon , sir , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ I ha ’ nowt to sen about it. ’ <NAME> , who was always more or less like a Wind , finding something in his way here , began to blow at it directly .
__label__1	I wouldn ’ t be taken upon that. ’ ‘ Why not ? ’ asked <NAME> .
__label__1	And that I thus became immeshed in the web he had spun for my reception ? ” ’ <NAME> ’ s enjoyment of his epistolary powers , in describing this unfortunate state of things , really seemed to outweigh any pain or anxiety that the reality could have caused him .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> proposed to continue the exploration , that the question of the supposed wreck might be completely settled , and he asked at what distance <NAME> might be from the extremity of the peninsula .
__label__0	`` You are right , <NAME> , '' answered <NAME> , who had joined the two speakers ; `` she 's a good ship , and I must say that there was never a ship so well equipped for a voyage in the polar regions .
__label__1	Was he prejudiced against the race of lawyers ?
__label__0	At last , a certain Yusuf-al-Milky , a member of the <NAME> church , who , for some thirty years , had carried on traffic with the <NAME> tribes , and travelled in the provinces which <NAME> desired to visit , agreed to bear him company .
__label__1	He said , if that was n't law , he would be glad to know what was .
__label__0	<NAME> , <NAME> , and Lambert. -- A Rival of Mohammed. -- The <NAME> Mountains. -- <NAME> ’ s Weapons. -- One of <NAME> ’ s Manoeuvres. -- A Halt over a Forest .
__label__0	<NAME> hesitated , the wrinkles in his forehead deepened , and at length he said in calm voice : “ I have nothing to say , my Lord .
__label__1	'Do not think of that .
__label__1	At length , the Major having disposed of all the missiles that were convenient to his hand , and having called the Native so many new names as must have given him great occasion to marvel at the resources of the <NAME> language , submitted to have his cravat put on ; and being dressed , and finding himself in a brisk flow of spirits after this exercise , went downstairs to enliven ‘ <NAME> ’ and his right-hand man .
__label__0	The migrations of the <NAME> tribes are thoroughly understood in these days , thanks to the wider knowledge of languages and anthropology , but they were scarcely suspected in the time of <NAME> , who , indeed , was one of the first to collect legends on the subject .
__label__1	Promise me solemnly that nothing will influence you to alter the course on which we now stand pledged to one another. ” “ Nothing , Carton. ” “ Remember these words to-morrow : change the course , or delay in it -- for any reason -- and no life can possibly be saved , and many lives must inevitably be sacrificed. ” “ I will remember them .
__label__0	No <NAME> power had thought of taking possession of this archipelago , which commands the whole <NAME> .
__label__1	The scene was altered to a small bedroom , where the fairest and youngest child lay dying ; the roses had fled from his cheek , and the light from his eye ; and even as the sexton looked upon him with an interest he had never felt or known before , he died .
__label__1	V. The <NAME> Those were drinking days , and most men drank hard .
__label__0	Had the brig been attacked by pirates ?
__label__1	And they appended to their verdict , a recommendation to the <NAME> ( which Mr Inspector appeared to think highly sensible ) , to offer a reward for the solution of the mystery .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> ’ t alarm me at the very beginning .
__label__1	<NAME> Micawber himself came down to the counting-house , in the afternoon , to tell <NAME> that he must relinquish me on the day of his departure , and to give me a high character , which I am sure I deserved .
__label__1	<NAME> ! ’ Then there came a turnip , then a potato , and then an egg ; with a few other little tokens of the playful disposition of the many-headed .
__label__1	But I sat wondering and waiting in <NAME> 's close room , until I really could not bear the two casts on the shelf above <NAME> 's chair , and got up and went out .
__label__0	After two mistakes , he probably hesitated to attempt a third interpretation of the document .
__label__0	With this fecula was mingled a mucilaginous juice of disagreeable flavour , but which it would be easy to get rid of by pressure .
__label__1	‘ “ Family of Mr Gallanbile , MP .
__label__1	The amens of the dusty clerk appear , like <NAME> ’ s , to stick in his throat a little ; but <NAME> helps him out , and does it with so much goodwill that he interpolates three entirely new responses of that word , never introduced into the service before .
__label__0	The northern hemisphere , towards which they were now rapidly approaching , presented a strong contrast with the southern , by its vast plains and great depressions , checkered here and there by very remarkable isolated mountains .
__label__0	But the remembrance is too vague ; the impression , however , is far from being a pleasant one ! ” “ Where and when could you have met him ?
__label__1	‘ <NAME> ’ s the pleasant word as soom heer has spok ’ n wi ’ me ; monny ’ s the face I see heer , as I first seen when I were yoong and lighter heart ’ n than now .

__label__1	'Speak out , my friend , if you have anything to say .
__label__0	But if that sea-hog of a man has not been inside the <NAME> and even the ice wall by a good dozen degrees , may the first sea we ship carry me overboard . ''
__label__0	I could hope for nothing from one so infatuated with and devoted to his master .
__label__1	His head was all on one side , and one of his eyes was half shut up , as if he were taking aim at something with an invisible gun .
__label__0	For three days the weather caused the working of the ship to be unusually laborious , and the new crew behaved very well ; thereupon the boatswain congratulated them .
__label__0	“ But how did they come to think so ? ” asked <NAME> .
__label__0	But his vessel had no sooner been put to sea than he was again attacked by the bilious fever , from which he had suffered so severely .
__label__1	Should I do it if I did not ? ’ ‘ Are we to be estranged , <NAME> ? ’ asked <NAME> , gazing at her like one frightened .
__label__1	‘ As <NAME> ’ ly ’ s eyes -- which was heavy -- see this woman better , ’ <NAME> went on , ‘ she know ’ d as she was one of them as she had often talked to on the beach .
__label__0	“ Here , my child , ” he said to <NAME> , “ take this book and keep it .
__label__1	I stole it in my heart when she first showed it me hanging round her neck ; and the child 's death , perhaps , is on me besides !

__label__1	I think I have noticed that they have an inconsistent way of speaking about her , as if she had made some great self-interested success in marrying Mr Gowan , though , at the same time , the very same people , would not have dreamed of taking him for themselves or their daughters .
__label__1	I reply , then , they are not identical with those of Mr .
__label__0	The third arm , on the contrary , stretched right out in a horizontal position above the roaring waters , into which the lower leaves dipped .
__label__1	‘ You have no business there .

__label__1	‘ So she is , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ so she is .
__label__1	Now , the <NAME> has got its gentleman again , through me .
__label__0	The presence of danger soon , however , produced indifference , and more thought was bestowed upon the sublime beauty , than upon the strife with this terrible element .
__label__1	'Why , a beak 's a madgst'rate ; and when you walk by a beak 's order , it 's not straight forerd , but always agoing up , and niver a coming down agin .
__label__1	I 'm very glad to hear it , '' said <NAME> 's nephew , `` because I have n't great faith in these young housekeepers .
__label__1	‘ I think I have caught it now , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	Was it outside the house at present ockypied , to its disgrace , by that minion of fortune and worm of the hour , ’ said <NAME> , falling back upon his strongest terms of reprobation , and slapping the counter , ‘ that I , <NAME> , five hundred times the man he ever was , sat in all weathers , waiting for a errand or a customer ?
__label__1	What a strange peculiarity on the part of Mr Meagles , and where should we find another such case !
__label__0	In ten minutes it would be high-tide : and , if <NAME> had not made a rash promise , the <NAME> would be immediately detached .
__label__1	‘ Ay , ay ! ’ cried the boy , in the same tone .
__label__1	I shall wait for some encouragement and hope .
__label__0	He was to return to <NAME> as soon as the weather permitted , but he died in the island without having been able to convey to his land the useful implements , grains , and cattle , which had been given to him by the <NAME> Government .
__label__1	Now I lost him , now I saw him , now I lost him , now I was cut at with a whip , now shouted at , now down in the mud , now up again , now running into somebody ’ s arms , now running headlong at a post .
__label__1	The day was in its prime , the day was in its wane , and still , uneasy in mind and body , she slept on ; unconscious of her strange bed , of the noise and turmoil in the street , and of the light that shone outside the shaded window .
__label__1	The same pious care which enriched the abbey of St Mary , and left us , orphans , to its holy guardianship , directed that no constraint should be imposed upon our inclinations , but that we should be free to live according to our choice .

__label__0	I sent the <NAME> priests after him , I got you intoxicated at <NAME> , I separated you from him , and I made him miss the <NAME> steamer . ''
__label__0	The station resembles , from the variety of characters assembled , a small news exchange .
__label__1	Their owners had evidently come to that spot to make some needful repairs in the stage arrangements , for one of them was engaged in binding together a small gallows with thread , while the other was intent upon fixing a new black wig , with the aid of a small hammer and some tacks , upon the head of the radical neighbour , who had been beaten bald .
__label__1	The girl jumped up , with great alacrity ; poured it quickly out , but with her back towards him ; and held the vessel to his lips , while he drank off the contents .
__label__0	This was to be regretted , for it increased the risk of collision with the floating ice .
__label__1	I noticed that after the funeral <NAME> changed his clothes so far , as to make a compromise between his Sunday dress and working dress ; in which the dear fellow looked natural , and like the Man he was .
__label__0	As yet the hunt had not been successful .
__label__1	She observes him very cautiously , as though mentally feeling her way to her next remark .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> affirms that <NAME> is only united to <NAME> by the <NAME> of <NAME> , and he visits <NAME> .
__label__1	He decided in favour of this latter track , and pursued it with some toil ; the rise being steep , and the way worn into deep ruts .
__label__0	<NAME> hisses appeared to shake the gloomy granite roof of that mighty cavern -- hisses which carried terror to our hearts .
__label__1	I 'll tell true , indeed , Mrs .
__label__0	The train pursued its course , that evening , without interruption , passing <NAME> , crossing <NAME> , and reaching <NAME> .
__label__1	I fancy his figure before me now , standing near her sofa , with his rough cap in his hand , and the blue eyes of my child-wife raised , with a timid wonder , to his face .
__label__1	I don ’ t know what I should do , <NAME> , if I didn ’ t. ’ The mere idea of Mrs. <NAME> ’ s failing in her action , affected Mrs. Sanders so deeply , that she was under the necessity of refilling and re- emptying her glass immediately ; feeling , as she said afterwards , that if she hadn ’ t had the presence of mind to do so , she must have dropped .
__label__0	At least I have not missed the steamer , which is the most important thing . ''
__label__1	I felt so different from her , even making every allowance for the differences between a child and a woman ; I felt so poor , so trifling , and so far off that I never could be unrestrained with her -- no , could never even love her as I wished .
__label__1	<NAME> , seeming to apprehend that his singular friend was about to say something disagreeable , asked <NAME> to step downstairs and tell Mrs. Bedwin they were ready for tea ; which , as he did not half like the visitor 's manner , he was very happy to do .
__label__0	“ The more of those terrible creatures that are killed the better , at all events , ” said <NAME> , “ so let ’ s seize the chance , and it will not only give us a little diversion , but be doing a good action. ” “ Very well , set to work , then , ” said <NAME> .
__label__1	I loved that stupid mite in a passionate way that she could no more deserve than I can remember without feeling ashamed of , though I was but a child .
__label__0	<NAME> hams , slices of salt beef , smoked salmon , oat cakes , and barley meal scones ; tea _ad libitum_ , and whisky in abundance , and several bottles of port , composed this astonishing meal .
__label__0	<NAME> leaped about with joy ; besides , since the captain had made himself known , he had become very sociable and very gentle , preserving his ill-temper for some of the crew , whom his master disliked as much as he did .
__label__0	It is my intention to try my luck with my fishing line and hook . ''
__label__1	‘ And if I could deny her when the tears was on her face , <NAME> ’ r <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , tenderly adjusting it on the rough palm of his hand , ‘ how could I deny her when she give me this to carry for her -- knowing what she brought it for ?
__label__1	The man was a bad man , and willing enough to be in his pay .
__label__1	Mr <NAME> ’ s cook , who generally takes the lead in society , has said , it is impossible to settle down after this , and why not go , in a party , to the play ?
__label__1	'How well he looks , and how like a gentleman 's son he is dressed again !
__label__1	What have these pests of the earth been doing to _you_ ?
__label__1	I told her , too , how people in such voyages were sometimes wrecked and cast on rocks , where they were saved by the intrepidity and humanity of one man .
__label__0	`` So as to do here , '' replied <NAME> , `` that which <NAME> did the very first thing on <NAME> , by climbing <NAME> . ''
__label__1	When we got into the street ( which was strange enough to me ) and smelt the fish , and pitch , and oakum , and tar , and saw the sailors walking about , and the carts jingling up and down over the stones , I felt that I had done so busy a place an injustice ; and said as much to <NAME> , who heard my expressions of delight with great complacency , and told me it was well known ( I suppose to those who had the good fortune to be born <NAME> ) that <NAME> was , upon the whole , the finest place in the universe .
__label__0	And by the traitor ’ s suggestion , and in order that the event might be explained apart from him , as if by political hate , this small guard had been chosen from the little band of exiles .
__label__1	All this while , <NAME> , with his pipe in his mouth , walked up and down , complacently admiring , but never interfering ; in which condition , indeed , as to the business and his domestic affairs , he walked up and down through life .
__label__1	And I will say , ’ added Mr <NAME> , ‘ to his ill-looking face , that in my opinion the world would be no worse for his slipping out of it altogether. ’ ‘ Your opinion is not asked , ’ answered <NAME> .
__label__1	You have the honour of being sister to one of the greatest scoundrels unhung ; and , if I may venture to say so to a lady , you are in every respect quite worthy of him .
__label__0	`` It may be so , sir , '' I timidly observed , `` but why conceal it from posterity , if it be a useful , a worthy discovery ? ''
__label__1	“ Will you tell me who denounced him ? ” “ It is against rule , ” answered the first ; “ but you can ask Him of <NAME> here. ” The <NAME> turned his eyes upon that man .
__label__0	He did not remain on board his boat for eight months , I suppose .
__label__0	Several officers went up the Sedger in a yawl till they were stopped by the shallowness of the water .
__label__1	He has also one or two large scars on his back and hips. ’ ‘ Detained at the jail , a mulatto , named <NAME> .
__label__1	Perhaps we may resume this -- ha -- interesting conversation , ’ said Mr Dorrit , ‘ at another time ; unless it should be , what I hope it is not -- hum -- in any way disagreeable to -- ah -- Mrs General. ’ ‘ Mr Dorrit , ’ said <NAME> , casting down her eyes as she rose with a bend , ‘ must ever claim my homage and obedience. ’ Mrs General then took herself off in a stately way , and not with that amount of trepidation upon her which might have been expected in a less remarkable woman .
__label__0	Since the September equinox it had emerged from the northern horizon , rising by lengthened spirals up to the 21st of December .
__label__0	Ah -- what a journey -- what a marvelous and extraordinary journey !
__label__0	He was , in fact , the boatswain 's mate of the <NAME> , as his papers showed .
__label__0	He did not know what to do .
__label__1	<NAME> must be got into a butt by some agency before it can be drawn out ; and the wine of sentiment never having been got into Mr Riderhood by any agency , nothing in nature tapped him .
__label__0	In a single engagement seventy of <NAME> 's companions fell under the arrows of the savages , fearful weapons steeped in `` curare , '' so fatal a poison that the slightest wound was followed by death .
__label__0	This was a very grave dereliction from the instructions which ordered him to survey <NAME> , but the fact of forty sailors being _hors de combat_ and on the sick-list , will suffice to prove how foolish it would have been to make so perilous an attempt .
__label__0	“ What is the exact longitude of <NAME> ? ” asked <NAME> .
__label__0	In fact , as the fulling-mill was there , although not then in use , its beam moved with extreme power would serve to stretch out the wire by rolling it round itself .
__label__0	As soon as <NAME> 's ransom was paid , he claimed his freedom ; but <NAME> , who had only saved his life that he might make all the treasures of Peru his own , and shelter himself under the prestige and authority which the inca still exercised over his subjects , was soon wearied by his entreaties .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> and his companions climbed <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> is a universal practice .
__label__1	what shall I do ! ’ thinks <NAME> , clasping her hands .
__label__1	This is a good omen for you .
__label__1	How -- ha -- how are they all , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Thank you , sir , They ’ re all pretty well , sir .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> ’ t be frightened , mistress , ’ said <NAME> , after a pause .
__label__0	“ Here ’ s our work , ” said <NAME> , “ and if we ever see <NAME> again , he will know how to make something of this labyrinth. ” “ We shall see him again , <NAME> , ” cried <NAME> , “ and when he returns he must find a tolerable dwelling here .
__label__0	`` Not at present ; because the solar rays , beating directly upon our thermometer , would give , on the contrary , a very high temperature .
__label__1	‘ You -- you -- are not particularly attached to it , I dare say , ’ said <NAME> , trembling with anxiety .
__label__1	How did the verdict go , sir ?
__label__0	But in spite of the repulses they met with , they let no favourable opportunity pass of recommencing their attacks .
__label__1	‘ The monk turned to the second sister .
__label__0	`` Now inform the reporters of this straightway .
__label__1	As it was clear that he was a choleric fellow in some respects , Mr <NAME> was relieved to find him in such good humour , and , to encourage him in it , smiled himself .
__label__1	‘ We ’ ll go together , ’ repeated <NAME> .
__label__0	And the entire length of the coast , upon the shore below the higher level , is a stretch of low land , unbroken and covered by plantations .
__label__0	The colors for it were supplied from certain plants used in dyeing , and which were very abundant in the island ; only to the thirty-seven stars , representing the thirty-seven States of the <NAME> , which shine on the <NAME> flag , the sailor added a thirty-eighth , the star of “ the State of <NAME> , ” for he considered his island as already united to the great republic .
__label__0	`` Now then , friends , '' said M'Nicholl , rubbing his eyes but hardly able to keep them open , `` I 'm not over fond of talking , but this time I think I may offer a slight proposition . ''
__label__0	A bend of the cliff prevented them from being seen by those in the brig ; but two or three reports , and the crash of bullets on the rock , told them that the <NAME> was at no great distance .
__label__1	' I should by your description .
__label__0	Who are you dressed up in that way ? ''
__label__0	By this time , however , an important dispatch was flying east , bearing four different addresses : To the Secretary of the <NAME> , <NAME> ; To <NAME> , Vice-President _pro tem._ , <NAME> , <NAME> ; To J.T .
__label__0	They have abundance of goats and fowls , but few sheep are to be seen , and no bullocks .
__label__1	“ Did n't I tell you , ” said the other convict then , “ that he would murder me , if he could ? ” And any one could see that he shook with fear , and that there broke out upon his lips curious white flakes , like thin snow .
__label__1	Not even doing that much , so that the old lady were busy and pleased , he would quietly swallow what was given him , merely taking a corrective dip of hands and face into the great bowl of dried rose-leaves , and into the other great bowl of dried lavender , and then would go out , as confident in the sweetening powers of <NAME> and a wholesome mind , as <NAME> was hopeless of those of all the seas that roll .
__label__1	I was very sorry , but there was a higher consideration than sense .
__label__1	<NAME> , as pat as need be. ’ Newman reflected for a few seconds , and then hurried away , muttering that he would be back directly .
__label__0	<NAME> , who had taken good care to procure some feathers for himself , could indulge in any caprice he liked .
__label__1	It was not only a constraint upon the child ’ s mind , but even upon the natural grace and freedom of her actions .
__label__0	<NAME> , ” he said at length , “ I am not in the habit of speaking lightly .
__label__0	One chance in a thousand is always a chance , while death from hunger gave us not even the faintest glimpse of hope .
__label__0	On the contrary , I professed considerable interest in the subject , and asked him what it was about .
__label__1	‘ And I ’ ll tell you what , my dear Copperfield , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ your friend <NAME> is a young fellow who might be attorney-general .
__label__1	In three days ' time he was able to sit in an easy-chair , well propped up with pillows ; and , as he was still too weak to walk , Mrs. <NAME> had him carried downstairs into the little housekeeper 's room , which belonged to her .
__label__0	They were accompanied by the members of the <NAME> , and by deputations sent from all the <NAME> .
__label__1	What a demd savage lamb ! ’ cried <NAME> .
__label__1	O <NAME> , I think you had that trust too ! ’ He was touched in the cavity where his heart should have been—in that nest of addled eggs , where the birds of heaven would have lived if they had not been whistled away—by the fervour of this reproach .
__label__1	I know as well that you feel none towards me .
__label__0	They had been in the place for three days in much perplexity , when the raft arrived .
__label__0	`` Unfortunately , '' said <NAME> , `` they have only given us the ship 's fare . ''
__label__1	My sister , having so much to do , was going to church vicariously , that is to say , <NAME> and I were going .
__label__1	But the <NAME> forbid that I should repine under any visitation .
__label__1	Here was a gentleman of a great , not to say a grand , address , accustomed to rank and dignity , really setting a fine example how to behave to a Mayor .
__label__1	The family are not wealthy -- they ’ re poor , indeed -- and she lives upon a small jointure ; but if you come to blood , <NAME> ! ’ The <NAME> gave a flourish with his stick and walked on again , in despair of being able to say what you came to , if you came to that .
__label__1	Submitting , however , with a good grace to the caution that we had shown to be so necessary , he contented himself with sitting down among us in his lightest spirits and talking as if his one unvarying purpose in life from childhood had been that one which now held possession of him .
__label__0	He was a sailor of some sixty years , but still vigorous and sturdy , with , an open , honest countenance .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> took no heed of me when I went into the parlour where he was , but sat by the fireside , weeping silently , and pondering in his elbow-chair .
__label__1	‘ Would you let a woman like this , whom you could see , if you had any experience of anything , to be as false and insolent as a woman can be -- would you let her put her foot upon your family , and thank her for it ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , <NAME> , I am sure. ’ ‘ Then make her pay for it , you mean little thing .
__label__1	At mid-day following he reappeared at the <NAME> , in the character , not new to him , of a witness before a <NAME> ’ s <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> laughed ; and having given it a squeeze , tossed it up and let it go .
__label__1	I should say that was worth full twenty pound at the next assizes , without the honesty , sir. ’ ‘ ’ Soizes , ’ cried <NAME> , ‘ thou ’ d betther not talk to me o ’ ‘ Soizes .
__label__1	‘ A pet name , sir , ’ he explained again .
__label__1	Mr <NAME> was far from quarrelling , in his own breast , with the manner of his beautiful betrothed .
__label__0	The cart was in good condition .
__label__0	This evening the dinner , which promised to be the last of this first part of the voyage , was not served without a certain amount of ceremony .
__label__1	So , <NAME> goes home to <NAME> , <NAME> ’ s , to take a plate of mutton broth with a chop in it , and a look at the marriage-service , in order that he may cut in at the right place to-morrow ; and he is low , and feels it dull over the livery stable-yard , and is distinctly aware of a dint in his heart , made by the most adorable of the adorable bridesmaids .
__label__1	‘ Go on , <NAME> ; do go on .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> ! ” ‘ The goblin grinned a broader grin than before , as he said , “ Well , <NAME> , what do you say to this ? ” ‘ The sexton gasped for breath .
__label__1	‘ But there ’ s some of his old friends not so patient as me .
__label__0	`` I will do all in my power , <NAME> , and by the blessing of God I shall succeed . ''
__label__0	I do not intend to use any other , ” was the professor ’ s bluff reply .
__label__0	It has been found impossible to determine with certainty either the name or the nationality of <NAME> , and still less to settle the period of his birth .
__label__0	“ But , ” as the sailor said , “ they quite took the wind out of the sails of the <NAME> , for whom everything was done by a miracle. ” In fact , they were energetic ; an energetic man will succeed where an indolent one would vegetate and inevitably perish .
__label__1	Grandfather Smallweed inquires , slowly rubbing his legs .
__label__1	Better to borrow , better to beg , better to die ! ''
__label__1	To catch up in her arms the sick child who was dear to her , and hide it as if it were a criminal , and keep off all ministration but such as her own ignorant tenderness and patience could supply , had become this woman ’ s idea of maternal love , fidelity , and duty .
__label__0	Outside , as the night advanced , the tempest also increased in strength , until it was equal to that which had carried the prisoners from <NAME> to this land in the <NAME> .
__label__0	There is plenty of good birch bark and straw in the bottom ; it ’ s like a nest .
__label__0	It seemed impossible that , before long , the projectile would not strike her , if only at the north pole , the brilliant arch of which was so distinctly visible on the black sky .
__label__0	Everything incited them to discover the answer to this enigma , an answer which could only be the name of a man endowed with a truly inexplicable , and in some degree superhuman power .
__label__0	These pirates are regular jaguars , and it seems to me we ought not to hesitate to treat them as such !
__label__0	Its skin , chestnut-brown above and silvery underneath , would have made one of those beautiful furs so sought after in the <NAME> and <NAME> markets : the fineness and the lustre of its coat would certainly fetch <NAME> .
__label__0	On the 30th March , <NAME> dropped anchor in 32 degrees 50 minutes in the <NAME> of <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> as it is in a large city to avoid the suspicion of being watched , when the mind is conscious of danger in that regard , I could not persuade myself that any of the people within sight cared about my movements .
__label__1	‘ Dear me ! ’ exclaimed the old lady .
__label__0	“ I thought I was gone , ” said he , “ and as you came right into my mind , I made a hard fight for it .
__label__0	A frightful tempest -- for it was not a thaw -- was raging , whirlwinds of snow careered around , and it was so exceedingly cold that the helmsman felt his hands rapidly freezing .
__label__1	He saw her pause irresolutely at the door and look towards him ; and he saw no more .
__label__0	Inside this wall is another , having also eight buildings to be used in the same manner . ''
__label__1	‘ I want that pretty frock , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ and that little bonnet , and a petticoat or two , and anything else you can spare .
__label__1	This figure was the first to perceive that <NAME> was looking on ; upon which he winked to the <NAME> , and entreated him , with mock gravity , not to wake the gentleman .
__label__0	But I could not move .
__label__0	<NAME> Manasarowar lies at the foot of immense sloping prairies , to the south of the gigantic mountains .
__label__1	This deed was done last night at ten o'clock .
__label__1	This young gentleman has to accomplish a destiny .
__label__1	The more my aunt looked at him , the more he reproached her ; for she had lately taken to spectacles , and for some inscrutable reason he considered the glasses personal .
__label__1	<NAME> , when he was sufficiently cool , proceeded with his letter .
__label__1	‘ Mr <NAME> ? ’ said the suitor .
__label__1	I will if I can .
__label__0	This Macartney rightly interpreted as his _congé_ !
__label__0	During the whole evening the bands of the Preobra-jensky and <NAME> regiments had played without cessation polkas , mazurkas , schottisches , and waltzes from among the choicest of their repertoires .
__label__1	The elder <NAME> shook his head , as he replied with a sigh , ‘ I ’ ve done it once too often , <NAME> ; I ’ ve done it once too often .
__label__1	What say you , my dear sir ?
__label__1	<NAME> at this in my hand .
__label__1	Not changing his action even then , he opened and shut the palms of his hands as he warmed them , and looked down at it .
__label__1	So were his two companions .
__label__0	At the village of <NAME> , the poppy is largely cultivated for the preparation of opium ; here , owing probably , to the bad quality of the water , all the peasants suffer from wens .
__label__1	As they struck the bargain , <NAME> surveyed him with a painful interest .
__label__0	<NAME> had supposed <NAME> ’ s refusal of a horse was that he preferred walking , as some guides do , but he was mistaken , for just as they were ready , the <NAME> gave a peculiar whistle , and immediately a magnificent steed of the pure <NAME> breed came bounding out of a grove close by , at his master ’ s call .
__label__0	The king came to meet the <NAME> , and invited them to go on board his canoe .
__label__0	Returning to the bright light , and examining it well , <NAME> perceived on his negative an almost imperceptible little spot on the sea horizon .
__label__0	Traps were again set , and the machines manufactured by Harding were tried .
__label__1	How it got into his head , I can ’ t say ; I can only say that it never got out .
__label__1	'Ceptin <NAME> ; he 's had a drop. ” All this time ( still with both hands taking great care of the bird's-nest ) , <NAME> was rolling his eyes round and round the room , and round and round the flowered pattern of my dressing-gown .
__label__0	The first work was to make the openings .
__label__1	<NAME> , I will -- no matter , I will do my utmost possible in all things .
__label__1	<NAME> , who had expected no more uncommon appearance than <NAME> in a clean shirt , was not a little astonished to see that the opener was a man in handsome livery , and that there were two or three others in the hall .
__label__1	‘ There ’ s the likeness of a man being hung , and smoking the while , chalked outside the door. ’ Guided by this direction , <NAME> proceeded slowly along the gallery until he encountered the ‘ portrait of a gentleman , ’ above described , upon whose countenance he tapped , with the knuckle of his forefinger -- gently at first , and then audibly .
__label__1	‘ Here ’ s a perfectly disinterested person , <NAME> dear , ’ said the knowing <NAME> , ‘ come to talk with you , for your own sake and your brother ’ s .
__label__1	You are wet , and you look weary .
__label__1	'If you ever want me , I 'm here .
__label__1	All things in it are of the past .
__label__1	They have left off telling me to ‘ wait a few days more ’ .
__label__0	`` Their straight walls , '' says D'Urville , `` rose far above our masts , glowering down upon our vessels , which appeared of absurdly small dimensions , as compared with their huge masses .
__label__0	The wind , after veering to the west , had sunk to a perfect calm .
__label__1	The royal phantom also carried a ghostly manuscript round its truncheon , to which it had the appearance of occasionally referring , and that too , with an air of anxiety and a tendency to lose the place of reference which were suggestive of a state of mortality .
__label__0	Some skeletons of poulps are preserved in the museums of <NAME> and <NAME> , that measure two yards in length .
__label__1	‘ No , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , turning his oilskin cap round and round ; ‘ we ’ re a doin ’ pretty well , <NAME> ; we haven ’ t no cause to complain in the worldly way , <NAME> .
__label__0	The narrative of the adventures of the great Genoese navigator had over-excited the minds of the hearers .
__label__1	It is better to be torn to pieces at a spring , than to be a mouse at the caprice of such a cat. ’ He looked at her so hard with those eyes too near together that the sinister sight of each , crossing that of the other , seemed to make the bridge of his hooked nose crooked .
__label__1	There was a red brick house with a small paved courtyard in front , which anybody might have known belonged to the attorney ; and there was , moreover , another red brick house with <NAME> blinds , and a large brass door-plate with a very legible announcement that it belonged to the surgeon .
__label__1	<NAME> played the piano to him , sat by him , and worked and talked , and played some games at dominoes with me .
__label__1	And now Veneering shoots out of the <NAME> wherein he is accustomed , when contemplative , to give his mind to the carving and gilding of the Pilgrims going to <NAME> , in order to show Twemlow the little flourish he has prepared for the trumpets of fashion , describing how that on the seventeenth instant , at <NAME> ’ s <NAME> , the <NAME> , assisted by the <NAME> , united in the bonds of matrimony , <NAME> , of <NAME> , <NAME> , to <NAME> , only daughter of the late <NAME> , <NAME> , of <NAME> .

__label__1	You would then have been my ward until you were of age .
__label__1	The pointer always came that way , with a view to the <NAME> , where a sporting taste ( originating generally in bets of new hats ) is much in vogue .
__label__1	‘ How ’ s my <NAME> , best of children , object dearest affections broken-hearted invalid ? ’ To which the person of the house , stretching out her arm in an attitude of command , replied with irresponsive asperity : ‘ Go along with you !
__label__0	There could be no further doubt ; a man , a stranger , had been there .
__label__0	Let us keep our minds free from every other consideration .
__label__0	As to the nearest distance at which it would pass her , that must be the result of two forces , attraction and repulsion , affecting its motion .
__label__0	Points of the compass reversed !
__label__0	The sailors <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> zealously obeyed <NAME> 's orders ; and he admonished them not to accustom themselves to woollen garments , though the temperature in this latitude , situated just beyond the polar circle , was very low .
__label__0	Then they sank under the waves , to rise again in the year 69 , when they again subsided .
__label__0	<NAME> breathed more freely for a moment .
__label__1	Welcome to this stricken breast ! ’ She felt the words , although she could not utter them , and held him in her pure embrace .
__label__1	‘ “ They are here , sisters , ” said the elder lady in a trembling voice .
__label__0	The projectile 's position with regard to the moon had altered , and the base was now turned to the earth .
__label__1	Come now , think of somethink else. ’ To this encouragement , offered with the indulgent toleration of a wise and liberal expert , <NAME> would rejoin , reddening : ‘ Or , my dear , you might propose to the person of the house a duck. ’ ‘ Well , <NAME> ! ’ the <NAME> would exclaim ( still no word being spoken by <NAME> ) , ‘ you do surprise me when you speak of ducks !
__label__0	In reality , the great volcanic movement of the island , and all its attendant phenomena , are concentrated in the interior of the island ; there , horizontal layers or strata of rocks , piled one upon the other , eruptions of basaltic origin , and streams of lava , have given this country a kind of supernatural reputation .
__label__1	A man with no hat , and with broken shoes , and with an old rag tied round his head .
__label__1	One of you gentlemen has a servant called <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Both , ’ replied the notary .
__label__0	Suppose we talk about the question of light. ” “ Nothing is easier , ” replied Harding .
__label__1	You can hold a knife to that black eye , as you run along .
__label__1	I saw <NAME> lay her beads down .
__label__1	He is what they call a barrister , with nothing to do .
__label__0	<NAME> looked at his companions one after the other .
__label__0	<NAME> prepared himself most carefully for the journey , which was a great undertaking for him .
__label__1	Uttering this exclamation in a tone of great surprise , as his eyes rested on <NAME> , <NAME> brought himself into a sitting posture , and demanded who that was .
__label__1	Nor did he remove his hand into its former posture , but kept it in the same warning attitude until he had finished the paragraph , when he paused for a few seconds , with a smile upon his face , as who should say ‘ this editor is a comical blade -- a funny dog , ’ and then asked her what she wanted .
__label__0	`` I will accompany you , '' said <NAME> .
__label__0	resumed <NAME> with emotion ; `` to you as much as to me !
__label__1	Did you ever breed any Suffolk Punches yourself , sir ? ’ ‘ N-no , ’ I said , ‘ not exactly. ’ ‘ Here ’ s a gen ’ lm ’ n behind me , I ’ ll pound it , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ as has bred ‘ em by wholesale. ’ The gentleman spoken of was a gentleman with a very unpromising squint , and a prominent chin , who had a tall white hat on with a narrow flat brim , and whose close-fitting drab trousers seemed to button all the way up outside his legs from his boots to his hips .
__label__1	She then holds up her tiny fingers , and spells the word in the manual alphabet ; next , she takes her types and arranges her letters ; and last , to make sure that she is right , she takes the whole of the types composing the word , and places them upon or in contact with the pencil , or whatever the object may be. ” ‘ The whole of the succeeding year was passed in gratifying her eager inquiries for the names of every object which she could possibly handle ; in exercising her in the use of the manual alphabet ; in extending in every possible way her knowledge of the physical relations of things ; and in proper care of her health .
__label__0	On the 3rd of August an excursion which had been talked of for several days was made into the southeastern part of the island , towards <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ This is the hardest trial I have had .
__label__1	Even now , although he knew that the observation of an anxious mother was much more likely to be correct in such a case than his own , and although she reminded him of many little circumstances which , taken together , were certainly susceptible of the construction she triumphantly put upon them , he was not quite convinced but that they arose from mere good-natured thoughtless gallantry , which would have dictated the same conduct towards any other girl who was young and pleasing .
__label__1	A great sensation was created throughout the room by the entrance of a tall gentleman in a blue coat and bright buttons , a large lady in blue satin , and two young ladies , on a similar scale , in fashionably-made dresses of the same hue .
__label__1	‘ You are thoughtful today , <NAME> ! ’ ‘ Agnes , shall I tell you what about ?
__label__1	( When she spoke of their living together , she meant that the old gentleman had all the good things and all the good lodging , while she and her husband had what they could get , and were poked into two corner rooms over the Mews . )
__label__0	The respectable classes never go out except in the evening , unless compelled by some pressing circumstance or for the performance of religious duties ; and it is in the evening that the ladies especially show themselves .
__label__1	I saw the rooms that I was never to see again ; here , a door half open ; there , a door closed ; all the articles of furniture around .
__label__1	“ D -- n it all , sir ! ” said <NAME> , staring at him , “ am I not eligible ? ” “ Oh dear yes !
__label__1	‘ When , ’ said <NAME> , as he took the piece of paper , ‘ when shall I call again ? ’ This was addressed to the daughter , but the father answered immediately .
__label__1	Now , the fact was that the excellent doctor had never acted upon anything but impulse all through his life , and it was no bad compliment to the nature of the impulses which governed him , that so far from being involved in any peculiar troubles or misfortunes , he had the warmest respect and esteem of all who knew him .
__label__0	If free , would he attempt to fly , or would he remain ?
__label__1	She will be glad to see you , if you will permit me to let her know that you are here. ’ ‘ By all means , ’ returned <NAME> .
__label__1	But that had nothing to do with it .
__label__1	`` Sir , I have told you why .
__label__1	‘ Go away , and shut the door .
__label__0	`` After all , master , you are right , '' replied <NAME> , as if quite convinced .
__label__0	What became of them after that ? -- '' `` I will tell you what became of them , '' said <NAME> in an energetic voice .
__label__1	No crowd was about the door ; no people were discernible at any of the many windows ; not even a chance passerby was in the street .
__label__1	“ Touch that string , and he instantly changes for the worse .
__label__0	<NAME> to be always well supplied with the products in most general demand -- coffee , sugar , rice , tobacco , cotton stuffs , and gunpowder -- and being at all times ready to barter , and prepared to deal in secondhand wares , he had contrived to amass considerable wealth .
__label__0	A sort of tempest arose on the 3rd of November , the squall knocking the vessel about with fury , and the waves running high .
__label__0	We must follow the <NAME> , who seemed to guide him self by paths known only to himself .
__label__0	To this confusion the discoveries of the <NAME> expedition were destined to put an end .
__label__1	<NAME> person singular , I do not care ; second person singular , thou dost not care ; third person singular , she does not care , ’ returned <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ And he wouldn ’ t be persuaded by the ladies , wouldn ’ t he ? ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	When I had gone over that , in the same manner , I asked the governor if he had any person in his charge who was shortly going out .
__label__1	As to what is dearer to you than life , nothing can be so dear to a good citizen as the Republic. ” Loud acclamations hailed this rebuke .
__label__1	As to the divine <NAME> herself , she rubbed her hands as men of business do , and took a few turns up and down the office with her pen behind her ear .
__label__1	how to know the charm in its beginning !
__label__1	‘ I couldn ’ t help it. ’ ‘ Couldn ’ t help it ! ’ cried <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ And I think , ’ added Mr Inspector , in conclusion , ‘ that if all goes well with him , he ’ s in a tolerable way of getting it .
__label__0	In fact , at this hour , the rising tide would have turned back the current of the creek , if its mouth had only been a few miles distant .
__label__0	I appeal to your sagacity .
__label__1	The morning of day and the morning of life are but too much alike. ’ ‘ You speak truly , sir , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	Before us was the steersman 's cage , and I expected that <NAME> was there directing the course of the <NAME> .
__label__0	Let us hold ourselves ready .
__label__1	<NAME> would find that his confidence in the <NAME> was not misplaced. ’ <NAME> said no more , but looked on thoughtfully while they prepared the table for two persons , and set the wine upon it .
__label__1	Both Ada and I expressed our regret that he should go , then , only to be disappointed .
__label__1	I really will , you know ! ’ she answered .
__label__1	Mrs. <NAME> was a majestic female in a pink gauze turban and a light brown wig .
__label__1	He said , perhaps , the best thing in the way of amends that could be said .
__label__1	But <NAME> argued the matter with me .
__label__1	It had more than once happened , that the Judge in the black cap pronounced his own doom as certainly as the prisoner 's , and even died before him .
__label__1	‘ His ascendancy over papa , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ is very great .
__label__1	Returning to the <NAME> with which burden , he was descried coming round into the court , by the wary young Blight watching from the window : who instantly closed the outer door , and left the miserable object to expend his fury on the panels .
__label__0	Some , extending beyond the dome of smoke , dissipated it , leaving behind an incandescent powder .
__label__0	The foremost guide , <NAME> , had the most perilous task ; it was for him to make the steps over again , now more or less worn away by the ascending caravan .
__label__1	‘ But , if I am not sure of myself , I am sure of you , <NAME> , and I know what an upright man you are , and how much to be respected .
__label__0	As it was , fully a quarter of an hour elapsed before he could get any answer from <NAME> to tell <NAME> in reply to his inquiry .
__label__0	But meanwhile , a marvelous world , never before so close within the range of human vision , was revealing itself .
__label__1	Recent occurrences to which he need not more particularly allude , but which have not been altogether without notice in some Sunday Papers , and in a daily paper which he need not name ( here every other member of the company names it in an audible murmur ) , have caused him to reflect ; and he feels that for him and <NAME> to have any personal differences at such a moment , would be for ever to deny that good feeling in the general cause , for which he has reason to think and hope that the gentlemen in <NAME> ’ s <NAME> have always been distinguished .
__label__1	‘ Of all the king ’ s knights he ’ s the flower , And he ’ s always gay ! ’ With this adaptation of the <NAME> to himself , he stalked out of the room closely followed by <NAME> , whom perhaps he had pressed into his service because he tolerably well knew it would not be easy to get rid of him .
__label__1	He must have given him the slip somehow , or he would n't be so easy . '
__label__0	It is represented in the cryptogram by this queer succession of letters , _ncuvktygc_ .
__label__1	In the sad moonlight , she clasped him by the neck , and laid her face upon his breast .
__label__0	“ The captain is too good an observer to be mistaken , and , if it has not moved from its place , the island is just where he put it. ” “ We shall see. ” On the next day , therefore , by means of the sextant , the engineer made the necessary observations to verify the position which he had already obtained , and this was the result of his operation .
__label__0	On taking the bearings by the chart , I saw that we were passing the mouth of the <NAME> , and that our course was hurrying us towards the northern seas at a frightful speed .
__label__1	‘ I mean of the foreign man , ’ <NAME> explained .
__label__0	All proceeded towards <NAME> ’ s chapel , which had been handsomely decorated for the occasion .
__label__1	‘ You used the same expression that night , at the door , when I asked you what was going on here .
__label__1	making her eyes very large .
__label__1	To have committed no fault , and yet to be so entirely alone in the world ; to be separated from the only persons he loved , and to be proscribed like a criminal , when six months ago he had been surrounded by every comfort , and looked up to , as the chief hope of his family -- this was hard to bear .
__label__1	He followed , however , quickly ; and saw Mr Meagles going down the street with his enemy at his side .
__label__1	‘ You seem to be sorry , Rosa. ’ ‘ I am sorry for the poor old place .
__label__1	If your <NAME> said to Me -- I have given you his exact words , “ Louisa , I want nothing ; I am better by myself ” -- what do you think he ’ d say to you ?
__label__1	A chorus of bystanders took up the shout of <NAME> ’ s praise , shook their heads sagely , and unanimously cried , ‘ Very ! ’ As the enthusiasm in <NAME> Smorltork ’ s favour ran very high , his praises might have been sung until the end of the festivities , if the four something-ean singers had not ranged themselves in front of a small apple-tree , to look picturesque , and commenced singing their national songs , which appeared by no means difficult of execution , inasmuch as the grand secret seemed to be , that three of the something-ean singers should grunt , while the fourth howled .
__label__0	These interesting details , and the great quantity of pearls offered to <NAME> , confirmed him in his idea , that he must have reached the <NAME> countries described by <NAME> , and that he could not be far from the empire of <NAME> or <NAME> , of which the <NAME> traveller had described the marvellous riches which were perpetually dazzling the eyes of these avaricious adventurers .
__label__1	I never saw him ( for this happened five-and-twenty years ago , before you and I were , <NAME> ) , but I have heard my father mention that he was a showy man , and the kind of man for the purpose .
__label__1	So now , half-waking and all-winking , he may recall the house full of company , the coach-houses full of vehicles , the stables full of horses , and the out-buildings full of attendants upon horses , until he is undecided about the present and comes forth to see how it is .
__label__0	Seeing that the <NAME> was unable or unwilling to respond , he concluded to help himself , by beginning first of all to prepare a little tea .
__label__0	The descent then commenced in the following order : Hans went first , my uncle followed , and I went last .
__label__0	All at once , <NAME> uttered a cry .
__label__1	Accordingly we looked in at a baker ’ s window , and after I had made a series of proposals to buy everything that was bilious in the shop , and he had rejected them one by one , we decided in favour of a nice little loaf of brown bread , which cost me threepence .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , sir , I have company there. ’ ‘ Have you , by <NAME> ! ’ said <NAME> ; ‘ I suppose you happen to know whose premises these are ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , they are yours , and I am your servant in them. ’ ‘ Oh !
__label__1	How long was I to bear this ?
__label__0	There <NAME> was to await the result of the struggle between the brothers , which would decide the fate of the throne of <NAME> , but he had received letters of recall .
__label__1	'Now , ' muttered the Jew , as he knocked at the door , 'if there is any deep play here , I shall have it out of you , my girl , cunning as you are . '
__label__1	<NAME> , who had been giving me my first lesson in all-fours , was trying to recollect a scheme of telling fortunes with the dirty cards , and was printing off fishy impressions of his thumb on all the cards he turned .
__label__0	<NAME> discovered in the dry bed of a creek , a plant whose excellent properties had been frequently described by one of his colleagues in the <NAME> .
__label__1	And <NAME> , '' says <NAME> , opening his arms , `` here 's children too !
__label__1	And I am ashamed of you , sir , ’ said Mrs. <NAME> , lastly , ‘ for your slanders and suspicions .
__label__0	`` Yes , my friend ; merely by friction against the atmospheric strata .
__label__1	<NAME> , quite unconscious , reads on through his double eye-glass , occasionally stopping to remove his glass and express approval , as `` Very true indeed , '' `` Very properly put , '' `` I have frequently made the same remark myself , '' invariably losing his place after each observation , and going up and down the column to find it again .
__label__1	But please to drive on -- quick , please !
__label__0	This course of reasoning roused my drooping spirits , and I resolved to resume my journey without further delay .
__label__0	Could there have been a collision between the schooner and one of those gigantic floating masses which <NAME> was unable to avoid in the mist ?
__label__1	<NAME> is quite sure of it .
__label__0	But no Satellite appeared and , what was worse , not the slightest sound indicated his presence .
__label__1	I thought of it much afterwards .
__label__1	says the master , walking towards him without his coat and waistcoat , and looking more soldierly than ever in his braces .
__label__0	During long hours this work was prosecuted busily but silently ; <NAME> had the furnace-fires lighted to help him through this passage so providentially discovered .
__label__0	The yacht was evidently making her way in the direction of the former mouth of the <NAME> , and the captain was struck with the idea that he would do well to investigate whether there was any suitable mooring towards which he might signal her .
__label__1	Finally , becoming cataleptic , she has to be carried up the narrow staircase like a grand piano .
__label__0	`` But why , '' said <NAME> , `` should not these rays be simply spurs of mountains which reflect more vividly the light of the sun ? ''
__label__0	At seven o'clock in the evening of the 14th of <NAME> , the island being already wrapped in darkness , I was walking on the port after I had dined , walking briskly too , for it was cold , although dry weather .
__label__1	Rumbling along with most unwonted noise , the caravan stopped at last at the place of exhibition , where <NAME> dismounted amidst an admiring group of children , who evidently supposed her to be an important item of the curiosities , and were fully impressed with the belief that her grandfather was a cunning device in wax .
__label__1	It would be mean to suspect him .
__label__0	From that day , who could tell into what part of the <NAME> basin the <NAME> would take us ?
__label__1	I expected , every day , that my guardian might speak to me about the letter , but he never did .
__label__1	He was a year younger than I , and young-looking even when that allowance was made .
__label__1	‘ He gave us <NAME> last night to that degree that <NAME> gets up and makes him this speech across the table .
__label__0	<NAME> took measures to intercept them ; one escaped by rapid paddling , the other was caught , and although <NAME> assured the natives that the <NAME> came as friends , they seized their weapons , and commenced attacking them .
__label__1	For the first time in his life he had done an underhanded action , and he had done wrong .
__label__0	It was not the engineer who had invented this way of causing loud explosions , for , according to <NAME> , the Tartars have employed it for many centuries to drive away from their encampments the formidable wild beasts of <NAME> .
__label__0	Surely they had a wonderful variety of meaning .
__label__0	A frigate called the <NAME> was placed at his disposal , and he was left free to choose his own route both going and returning .
__label__0	I ’ m ready to begin over again , if it would be of any service to you .
__label__0	We have now only to speak of <NAME> .
__label__0	are you expecting goods from <NAME> ? ” asked the <NAME> .
__label__1	And betwixt ourselves , ’ sinking his voice lower yet , ‘ that woman ’ s name ain ’ t <NAME> neither , though she has a world of merits. ’ <NAME> ruffled his hair again , with both hands , as a further preparation for what he was going to say , and went on , with a hand upon each of his knees : ‘ There was a certain person as had know ’ d our Em ’ ly , from the time when her father was drownded ; as had seen her constant ; when a babby , when a young gal , when a woman .
__label__1	‘ Under the impression , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ that your peregrinations in this metropolis have not as yet been extensive , and that you might have some difficulty in penetrating the arcana of the <NAME> in the direction of the <NAME> , -- in short , ’ said <NAME> , in another burst of confidence , ‘ that you might lose yourself -- I shall be happy to call this evening , and install you in the knowledge of the nearest way. ’ I thanked him with all my heart , for it was friendly in him to offer to take that trouble .
__label__1	For some time , he appeared doubtful whether he ought to be relieved or disappointed by the intelligence ; but at length he breathed more freely ; and withdrawing his eyes , observed that it was no great matter .
__label__0	They were all <NAME> majos , agricultural laborers , and naturally as careless and apathetic as men of their class usually are , but they could not help being very considerably embarrassed when they discovered that they were left in solitude upon a detached and isolated rock .
__label__0	At last , their situation was absolutely intolerable .
__label__0	The general route of the <NAME> Indian <NAME> is as follows : Leaving <NAME> , it passes through <NAME> , crossing to the continent opposite <NAME> , goes over the chain of the <NAME> , runs thence north-east as far as <NAME> , skirts the nearly independent territory of <NAME> , ascends to <NAME> , turns thence eastwardly , meeting the <NAME> at <NAME> , then departs from the river a little , and , descending south-eastward by <NAME> and the <NAME> town of <NAME> , has its terminus at <NAME> .
__label__0	The two children were living in this touching manner in <NAME> , struggling patiently and courageously with their poverty .
__label__1	The perfect ease of manner with which he put the money up again and looked at me with a smile on his refined face , as if he had been mentioning a curious little fact about somebody else , almost made me feel as if he really had nothing to do with it .
__label__1	‘ Well , pretty nigh , ’ he said ; ‘ keep steady. ’ I kept as steady as I could , both in foot and face ; and having by this time got the dust out , and found his pencil-case , he measured me , and made the necessary notes .
__label__1	The lamps looked pale , and shook as if they were cold .
__label__0	She had two masts and all the sails and rigging of an ordinary clipper , which would enable her to take advantage of every favorable wind , though her chief reliance was on her mechanical power .
__label__0	Just as she was about to retire she could not refrain from going up to <NAME> to say good-night .
__label__0	<NAME> had a cask fixed at the head of the foremast -- what is called a crow's-nest -- and from thence an unremitting watch was kept .
__label__1	They made a path through booths and carriages and throngs of people , and never once stopped to look behind .
__label__0	Hence there exists a formidable accumulation of electric fluid at the poles , and it flows towards the land in a permanent stream .
__label__0	Do you say to yourself , ` This prison may be our tomb ? '
__label__1	Upon the undertaker 's stating in the <NAME> 's bar in the course of the day that he has received orders to construct `` a six-footer , '' the general solicitude is much relieved , and it is considered that <NAME> 's conduct does him great honour .
__label__0	At the same moment , firing broke out on the <NAME> and <NAME> of the town .
__label__0	there is quite a fortune here for me to realize if I am not the greatest of duffers ! ” It seemed as though the hands of <NAME> felt the enormous sum , and were already closing over the rolls of gold .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> showed his podorojna , made out in the name of <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> could go no farther , and old <NAME> felt ready to die .
__label__1	What ’ s behind me ? ’ He carried his finger slowly down to the wrist , and round the wrist , and affected to look at the back of the hand for what was behind him .
__label__0	The lines he had formed with the letters of his alphabet had no more sense in them that those of the document !
__label__1	With the funeral clang that it sounded into <NAME> ’ s heart , his sense of weakness returned .
__label__1	As few people are known in Tom-all-Alone 's by any <NAME> sign , there is much reference to <NAME> whether he means <NAME> , or the <NAME> , or <NAME> , or <NAME> , or <NAME> , or <NAME> , or the <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Let me see to your hurts first. ’ ‘ I have no hurts to see to , beyond a little soreness and stiffness that will soon pass off , ’ said <NAME> , seating himself with some difficulty .
__label__0	The boat scudded thus northward during the whole day , borne on by monstrous waves , preserving always , fortunately , a speed equal to theirs .
__label__1	`` But I am afraid , '' said I , `` this is an objection to all kinds of application -- to life itself , except under some very uncommon circumstances . ''
__label__1	So subdued I was by those tears , and by their breaking out again in the course of the quiet walk , that when I was on the coach , and it was clear of the town , I deliberated with an aching heart whether I would not get down when we changed horses and walk back , and have another evening at home , and a better parting .
__label__0	`` It would have blown once or twice since we have been looking at it . ''
__label__1	Dear me , sir , why did n't you send your young man round for me ?
__label__0	It is needless to say that no one troubled himself to institute a search after him , and , as <NAME> sententiously remarked , “ Perhaps old <NAME> is making money in <NAME> by exhibiting himself as the latest arrival from a comet ! ” But however great was the reserve which <NAME> might make on his part , nothing could induce <NAME> to conceal his experiences .
__label__1	I arrived at <NAME> 's , to his surprise , yesterday evening ; we agreed that I would not present myself elsewhere until all was well , or unless I could be useful ; I present myself here , to beg a little talk with your brother .
__label__1	This unlucky morning , of all mornings in the year , was the morning next after Mr <NAME> ’ s interview with <NAME> in her little carriage .
__label__0	Soon we were enveloped to the throat in india-rubber clothing ; the air apparatus fixed to our backs by braces .
__label__1	‘ Perhaps you ’ ll ask him , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ as he ’ s a stranger ? ’ ‘ Ask him what ? ’ returned <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> amusements are not wanting .
__label__1	At last , biting her thin lips , and bridling up , she said -- ‘ It can ’ t be .
__label__1	He says it ’ s his opinion that when a man has made a handsome sum by his business , he is bound to give it up ; and that <NAME> would be an assistance in it which any man might be proud of .
__label__1	Let me go my way , all of ye .
__label__0	But Fourrier of <NAME> , a distinguished member of the <NAME> des <NAME> , whose _Mémoires_ on the temperature of the Planetary spaces appeared about 1827 , reduced these figures to considerably diminished proportions .
__label__1	said <NAME> , reflectively , 'if I 'd only got that young boy of <NAME> , the chimbley-sweeper 's !
__label__1	Dear Mr Clennam , don ’ t let me see you weep !
__label__0	It was here that <NAME> , in 1826 , twenty-six years before the date when our story opens , was received by the proprietor of the fazenda .
__label__1	From whence have we derived that spiritual profit ?
__label__1	Let me carry through the rest of my misdirected life , the remembrance that I opened my heart to you , last of all the world ; and that there was something left in me at this time which you could deplore and pity. ” “ Which I entreated you to believe , again and again , most fervently , with all my heart , was capable of better things , <NAME> ! ” “ Entreat me to believe it no more , <NAME> .
__label__0	“ <NAME> ! ” said <NAME> , in a tone of the most supreme contempt .
__label__1	<NAME> and ventilation , drainage and water-service , all of the primest quality .
__label__1	<NAME> half a dozen more if you like , and we ’ ll find room for ’ em .
__label__1	It was of no avail .
__label__1	‘ Then he has done nothing .
__label__0	This seemed very odd ; he made another examination , and at last he looked at the glass , -- the object-glass was missing .
__label__1	He turned into the <NAME> , and , having revived himself by twice pacing the pavements of <NAME> 's Bench-walk and Paper-buildings , turned into the Stryver chambers .
__label__0	`` No -- except when he is setting a halyard .
__label__0	The boy ’ s heart sank ; the sailor had not been deceived in his forebodings ; the engineer , <NAME> , had not been found !
__label__0	As to <NAME> , he took part in the common work , and was not less skilful in it than his companions , which always rather astonished the sailor .
__label__0	If you were to believe him , <NAME> would n't blow his nose without consulting him .
__label__1	‘ We call Crummles that , because his style of acting is rather in the heavy and ponderous way , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	She is never to blame in any such instance .
__label__1	‘ ’ <NAME> won something she didn ’ t expect , I think , haven ’ t you , dear ? ’ said <NAME> , maliciously .
__label__1	Show me some way through the world -- some humble path that I may take alone , and labour in , and sometimes think of you as one who will protect and care for me as for a sister !
__label__1	And so he went on , content to read the book of her heart from the page first presented to him , little dreaming of the story that lay hidden in its other leaves , and murmuring within himself that at least the child was happy .
__label__0	Each utensil -- spoon , fork , knife , plate -- had a letter engraved on it , with a motto above it , of which this is an exact facsimile : The letter N was no doubt the initial of the name of the enigmatical person who commanded at the bottom of the seas .
__label__0	The frightened horses reared , and their driver could not manage to quiet them .
__label__0	The engineer , <NAME> , had collected the hundreds of workmen which composed the active and courageous population of the mine .
__label__1	‘ Yes , <NAME> , ’ she said , when that young lady had concluded .
__label__1	If that 's not the boy , sir , who had the orange , and threw this bit of peel upon the staircase , I 'll eat my head , and his too . '
__label__1	'Bear a hand with the boy , ' cried <NAME> , beckoning furiously to his confederate .
__label__1	Do n't tell me anything : I do n't want to know anything ; I am not curious. ” Of course I saw that he knew the man was come .
__label__1	Such are the humiliations that society has inflicted upon me , possessing the qualities I have mentioned , and which you know me to possess .
__label__1	A brown sunburnt gentleman , who appears in some inaptitude for sleep to be wandering abroad rather than counting the hours on a restless pillow , strolls hitherward at this quiet time .
__label__0	said <NAME> , who intended to fire after his companions .
__label__1	One of these papers was a letter to this girl <NAME> ; the other a will . '
__label__1	His thoughts , as yet , have no wider range than home .
__label__1	‘ Get off ! ’ cried <NAME> , indignant at this process , and vainly endeavouring to extricate himself from the grasp of his enthusiastic acquaintance .
__label__1	Soon he was up again , and away , -- not far into the country , but back towards <NAME> by the high-road -- then back again -- then over another part of the same ground as he already traversed -- then wandering up and down in fields , and lying on ditches ' brinks to rest , and starting up to make for some other spot , and do the same , and ramble on again .
__label__0	Now it happens that it is during the winter of the southern countries that it is at its most distant point from the sun , and consequently , in a situation for those regions to feel the greatest cold .
__label__0	`` He asked me , '' replied <NAME> , `` did I not remember <NAME> of the <NAME> , and whether he had perished in the fight with the mutineers or in the shipwreck ; whether he was one of the men who had been abandoned with <NAME> ; in short , he asked me if I could tell him how his brother died .
__label__1	It was curious and interesting , nevertheless , to be sitting up there behind four horses : well educated , well dressed , and with plenty of money in my pocket ; and to look out for the places where I had slept on my weary journey .
__label__0	wait , <NAME> ! ” exclaimed <NAME> ; “ I remember -- yes , I remember .
__label__0	He was always waited upon by a thousand pages and a thousand girls .
__label__0	While J. T. <NAME> was speaking , <NAME> , without interrupting him , had hastily put on his clothes ; and , in less than two minutes , the two friends were making for the suburbs of <NAME> with rapid strides .
__label__0	To him a voyage to <NAME> was merely a matter of course .
__label__0	But for the strong favourable winds which now blew , it seems probable that the vessels would never have issued in safety from amongst the formidable ice masses through which they finally worked their way at the cost of incredible exertions and fatigues , and in face of incessant danger .
__label__0	Now , I have supplementary reservoirs capable of holding a hundred tons .
__label__0	It would appear that progress is not possible to these savages , so nearly allied to brutes .
__label__0	Thereupon the doctor wrapped himself up as well as he could , and , staff in hand , walked away towards the sledge in the midst of a fog which the moonlight made almost bright .
__label__0	The longer he gazed upon them , the more absorbing became their attraction .
__label__1	<NAME> , who had made one very stiff bow , and risen from his chair , made another very stiff bow , and dropped into it again .
__label__0	The polar circle was soon passed , and the course shaped for <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ What is the matter ? ’ ‘ I don ’ t know .
__label__0	Anatomically , it is distinguished from the white whale and the <NAME> whale by the seven cervical vertebrae , and it has two more ribs than its congeners .
__label__1	‘ No , no , <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> , arresting his hand , ‘ A lady .
__label__1	The water was trickling out of a leaky butt , and a most wretched cat was lapping up the drops with the sickly eagerness of starvation .
__label__1	He departed on his errand , however , and immediately returned , ushering in its object .
__label__1	It was a nice sickly season just at this time .
__label__0	Undoubtedly the travelers would still have to encounter a violent recoil after the complete escapement of the water ; but the first shock would be almost entirely destroyed by this powerful spring .
__label__1	When the Major was too hoarse with meat and drink , and the display of his social powers , to render himself intelligible any longer , they adjourned to coffee .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> states that , having come to the end of <NAME> 's <NAME> , he found there many traces of the presence of men .
__label__0	From the foot of the wall to the canal side was hardly a hundred yards .
__label__1	‘ Yes , ’ rejoined <NAME> , looking round for an instant , and immediately carrying his eyes back again to the ceiling .
__label__0	Nevertheless , the telescopes revealed no distinctive features -- even after three hours ' navigation .
__label__0	It was the most important investigation he had undertaken .
__label__1	I don ’ t know any such person. ’ ‘ Well , <NAME> , then. ’ ‘ I never heard the name in my life. ’ ‘ Then , I have been deceived , and deluded , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	Therefore I take every opportunity of openly stating to a friend of <NAME> how <NAME> is situated .
__label__1	‘ You wouldn ’ t mind my cutting out something while we are at tea , would you ? ’ she asked her Jewish friend , with a coaxing air .
__label__0	At a height of a hundred feet rose the vaulted roof , supported on basalt shafts .
__label__1	Having a decided objection to his master ’ s being there at all , <NAME> appeared to consider it a high moral duty not to appear too much pleased with anything that was done , said , suggested , or proposed .
__label__1	'No , nor that neither , ' rejoined the girl .
__label__0	The half-breed had , in fact , reached the boat and raised himself alongside half out of the water .
__label__1	Thirdly , that this deed had been , with others , stolen from one who had himself obtained or concealed it fraudulently , and who feared to take any steps for its recovery ; and that he ( <NAME> ) knew the thief .
__label__1	I carried coffee , <NAME> , for a long time .
__label__1	`` This is a day , '' said <NAME> , gaily taking a little claret in a tumbler , `` that will ever be remembered here .
__label__0	The aeronauts took careful and complete note of the orographic conformation of the country .
__label__1	I never see such a naughty boy in all my days ! ’ ‘ You have been fighting for a bird ! ’ exclaimed his mother .
__label__0	The wind blew with extraordinary violence .
__label__1	After which , he walked home , whistling .
__label__0	In this difficulty he had recourse to <NAME> , who , by virtue of his authority and of the prestige which still clung to him , could appease the tumult , give the Spaniards some respite , and enable them to prepare for their retreat .
__label__0	It was the 27th of July , when <NAME> left the <NAME> .
__label__0	The noisy laughter of <NAME> was alone sufficiently shrill to ring out with its joyous note above every kind of clucking , chirping , hooting , whistling , and cooing .
__label__1	When they arrived at the gateway where he had paused in the dark not many hours before , to picture to himself on which of the rough stones of the street her feet had trodden , he lifted her again , and carried her up the staircase to their rooms .
__label__1	<NAME> , and repent of it .
__label__1	'Why , soldiers , why -- should we be melancholy , boys ? '
__label__0	Their hair is black and woolly , curly , but not thick .
__label__0	Thence he visited the town of <NAME> , standing on the right bank of the <NAME> , that he calls <NAME> , and this is the very centre of <NAME> .
__label__0	This was nothing less than a pretty sharp cold , at first somewhat endurable , but which soon covered the inside surface of the window panes with a thick coating of ice .
__label__1	‘ Only myself , ’ he assented with a sigh .
__label__0	`` Really , '' said the doctor , `` I believe we have experienced the greatest cold that has ever been observed , since our spirit thermometer indicated one day -72° ; and if I remember aright , the lowest temperatures ever observed before were only -61° at <NAME> , -65° at <NAME> , and -70° at <NAME> . ''
__label__1	I will take you there directly , without a minute 's loss of time .
__label__1	His heart beat quickly when he bethought himself of this ; and he half resolved to turn back .
__label__1	Now , you know the pains and penalties you are liable to , and so I need not dilate upon them , but I have a proposal to make to you .
__label__0	`` Would he come back , '' said I , `` now that what he thought was known to him and me only has come out ? ''
__label__0	The darkness was due rather to the thickness of the foliage than to the disappearance of the sun .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> ’ s oration upon this occasion , together with the debate thereon , is entered on the Transactions of the <NAME> .
__label__0	The fate of the whole party would hang in the balance for the ten minutes required to pass along that ridge .
__label__1	we are a growing too outrageous ! ’ ‘ <NAME> thinks well of Mrs Pipchin , <NAME> , ’ returned <NAME> , ‘ and has a right to choose his housekeeper , you know .
__label__0	The doctor glanced around him in the car .
__label__0	There was no saying how long this state of the atmosphere might last .
__label__0	<NAME> placed his hand upon <NAME> 's arm , and , lowering his voice , said , `` You have guessed who I am ? ''
__label__1	<NAME> and less respectable men might fall short of that mark , but Mr <NAME> was always up to it .
__label__0	I made no attempt to do this , being convinced that the hour would come when <NAME> would again speak to me of his brother , and of the efforts which he intended to make to save him and his companions .
__label__0	The thick window inserted in the bottom could bear any amount of weight , and <NAME> and his companions walked upon it as if it were solid plank ; but the sun striking it directly with its rays lit the interior of the projectile from beneath , thus producing singular effects of light .
__label__1	So I call upon <NAME> , before I say another word , to fetch him in and send him packing to the right-about. ’ The unsuspecting <NAME> was at that moment airing his many buttons within view of the window .
__label__0	`` But why , if you please , captain , '' asked <NAME> , knitting his brows , `` why should our hemisphere , as you say , be so badly divided ?
__label__0	Until it descended between the banks of the larger stream it would not be out of keeping with the picturesque landscape which stretched away on each side of it .
__label__0	For this purpose the frigate <NAME> was equipped at <NAME> , and the command was given to a most distinguished officer , <NAME> la <NAME> , who was to become vice-admiral in 1786 .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> had preceded me .
__label__1	<NAME> , I wonder you have never turned your thoughts to emigration. ’ ‘ <NAME> , ’ returned <NAME> , ‘ it was the dream of my youth , and the fallacious aspiration of my riper years. ’ I am thoroughly persuaded , by the by , that he had never thought of it in his life .
__label__1	<NAME> vistas of stately oaks and elm trees appeared on every side ; large herds of deer were cropping the fresh grass ; and occasionally a startled hare scoured along the ground , with the speed of the shadows thrown by the light clouds which swept across a sunny landscape like a passing breath of summer .
__label__1	“ 'See , gentlemen , ' said I , still keeping my hands upon her breast , 'how useless I am , as you have brought me !
__label__0	`` If the current goes to the pole , we shall go there ; and if it does n't , we sha n't .
__label__0	It was here that <NAME> was obliged to leave the railway , which at the time did not go beyond that town .
__label__1	But he did not hint to me that when I had been better looking he had had this same proceeding in his thoughts and had refrained from it .
__label__0	Besides , the <NAME> flag was hoisted on the summit of the iceberg , and <NAME> would have recognized it and come down to the shore had he been living .
__label__0	It is evident that he received with favour the project which <NAME> and <NAME> had just submitted to him ; and though <NAME> , in the fragment which we have just quoted , attributes to himself alone all the honour of the project , it is not less true that his father was the promoter of the enterprise , as the following charter shows , which we translate in an abridged form .
__label__0	If they could do this without observation , under cover of night , they might possibly reach the deep valleys of the <NAME> and put the <NAME> off the scent .
__label__1	‘ The great petition that I make to you ( there is another which grows out of it ) , the great supplication that I address to your merciful and gentle heart , is , that you will not disclose this to <NAME> until I am dead .
__label__0	It is very likely that he would have declared himself ready to put up with any amount of discomfort to be able to gratify his love of investigation ; but all were far too disheartened and distressed to care to banter him upon the subject on which he was so sensitive .
__label__1	Hereupon the coachman , and the guard , and <NAME> , and <NAME> , and <NAME> , and all the hostlers , and every one of the idlers , who are more in number than all the others put together , shout for the missing gentlemen as loud as they can bawl .
__label__1	He lowered it , and passed a remark on the next change of the moon .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> , charmed to see you .
__label__1	In some villages , large painted boards were fixed up : warning all persons who begged within the district , that they would be sent to jail .
__label__1	‘ Look on to the end -- ’ <NAME> was beginning to remonstrate , when he caught at the words : ‘ Ah !
__label__0	But the projected voyage was a very different thing ; and only the old sailors of the <NAME> were entirely indifferent to the dangers of such an enterprise , and ready to follow their chief whithersoever it might please him to go .
__label__1	<NAME> Leicester rises , adjusts her scarf about her , and returns to his seat .
__label__1	And if we were all Englishmen present , I would say , ’ added Mr Podsnap , looking round upon his compatriots , and sounding solemnly with his theme , ‘ that there is in the Englishman a combination of qualities , a modesty , an independence , a responsibility , a repose , combined with an absence of everything calculated to call a blush into the cheek of a young person , which one would seek in vain among the <NAME> of the Earth. ’ Having delivered this little summary , Mr Podsnap ’ s face flushed , as he thought of the remote possibility of its being at all qualified by any prejudiced citizen of any other country ; and , with his favourite right-arm flourish , he put the rest of <NAME> and the whole of <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> nowhere .
__label__1	At this humorous feat he laughed outright .
__label__1	<NAME> bracelet , produced by Veneering before going down , and clasped upon the arm of bride .
__label__0	The breeze was light , and as the current had then lost much of its force , <NAME> had absolute command over his vessel .
__label__0	There can be no doubt about the matter . ''
__label__1	‘ I entered on his lodgings t ’ other day , chiefly because I had seen this very board .
__label__0	[ Illustration : <NAME> in <NAME> . ]
__label__1	There 's no one here but the finest creature upon earth -- a child . ''
__label__0	Indeed , they had before believed that , surprised in the corral , <NAME> had fallen by a bullet , as <NAME> had fallen .
__label__1	Even when the lessons are done , the worst is yet to happen , in the shape of an appalling sum .
__label__1	However , they got to the corner of <NAME> Place without any molestation from that terrible fire-ship ; and the Captain mounting the coach-box -- for his gallantry would not allow him to ride inside with the ladies , though besought to do so -- piloted the driver on his course for <NAME> ’ s vessel , which was called the <NAME> , and was lying hard by <NAME> .
__label__1	Heaven be with you , <NAME> ! ’ cried <NAME> with emotion .
__label__1	I don ’ t know her ! ’ I knew her .
__label__1	‘ Not to see her , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ though I could have seen her , I daresay , if I had asked , Mr Dombey being out of town : but to say a parting word to <NAME> .
__label__0	Though there was sufficient depth of water to allow a light craft to pass the bar , there was not enough for the “ Nautilus , ” whose draught of water was considerable .
__label__1	‘ If you please , <NAME> ’ am , Mr Carker sends his respectful compliments , and begs you would spare him one minute , if you could -- for business , <NAME> ’ am , if you please. ’ ‘ Really , my love , ’ said <NAME> in her mildest manner ; for her daughter ’ s face was threatening ; ‘ if you would allow me to offer a word , I should recommend -- ’ ‘ Show him this way , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	No search had been made up here , for the tide had been running strongly down , at that time of the night of <NAME> , and the likeliest places for the discovery of a body , if a fatal accident had happened under such circumstances , all lay—both when the tide ebbed , and when it flowed again—between that spot and the sea .
__label__1	Traddles only smiled , and shook his head ( with his hair standing upright on the top of it ) , when I looked to him for an explanation ; so I took out my watch , and , as a last resource , counted off the five minutes .
__label__0	At midnight , grandly illuminated , it would shine with the greatest glory .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> ’ s spirits were so low , in truth , that he half determined , that day , to take no further precautions against surprise from <NAME> , but to abandon himself recklessly to chance , and be indifferent to what might happen .
__label__0	What events happened during the stay of the ships here ?
__label__0	'With God 's protection , ' he said , 'not a hair of our heads shall be hurt . '
__label__0	Perhaps it was rapidly leaving the disc , so that it would soon quit the pure shadow .
__label__0	Two of the settlers were to watch together , and every two hours it was agreed that they should be relieved by their comrades .
__label__1	A man is hungry all day long .
__label__0	If I can persuade Kai-Koumou that we have expiated our profanation , that the wrath of the <NAME> has fallen on us : in a word , that we have died a terrible death , do you think he will leave the plateau of <NAME> to return to his village ? ” “ Not a doubt of it , ” said <NAME> .
__label__1	He caught them in his unoccupied hand , and holding them , and still clasping the border of her shawl , said hurriedly : ‘ But I see thee , <NAME> , setten by the bed .
__label__1	I want to get some dinner . ''
__label__1	( He had now set Mr Merdle down on a couch , side by side with <NAME> , and to it they must go , now or never . )
__label__0	In some places , the wind , eddying round the corners , formed the snow into tall whirling columns , resembling those waterspouts which turn round on their base , and which vessels attack with a shot from a gun .
__label__0	`` They are seals and morses . ''
__label__0	As to the others , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , they openly meditated mutiny ; they wanted to bring their companions over and compel the <NAME> to return to <NAME> .
__label__1	This is my reason for living secret here , with the aid of a good old man who is my true friend .
__label__1	I might have known it from what I have seen of your strength of character .
__label__1	At last it falls ; and then a dumb old woman lies upon the bed , and she is crooked and shrunk up , and half of her is dead .
__label__0	Never could I have looked for such an experience !
__label__0	He anchored there in <NAME> <NAME> , and ascertained that the country was inhabited , although he could not see a single native .
__label__0	The <NAME> and the <NAME> immediately advanced to question him .
__label__1	Lieutenant <NAME> turned round to his friend <NAME> , with a scarcely perceptible shrug of the shoulder , as if implying some doubt of the accuracy of his recollection .
__label__1	<NAME> , <NAME> tells me -- ’ ‘ Stay , mother !
__label__1	away at a gallop over the black landscape ; dust and dirt flying like spray , the smoking horses snorting and plunging as if each of them were ridden by a demon , away in a frantic triumph on the dark road -- whither ?
__label__0	One need not be surprised at this .
__label__1	‘ He is only the representative of another ! ’ cried <NAME> .
__label__1	Your dear friend amused me and amused himself as long as it suited his inclinations ; and then reminded me that we were both people of the world , that we both understood mankind , that we both knew there was no such thing as romance , that we were both prepared for going different ways to seek our fortunes like people of sense , and that we both foresaw that whenever we encountered one another again we should meet as the best friends on earth .
__label__0	It took six thousand years to invent propellers and screws ; so we have time enough yet. ” “ Confounded heat ! ” said <NAME> , wiping away the perspiration that was streaming from his forehead .
__label__1	“ I was new here once , ” said <NAME> .
__label__0	By him he was made <NAME> on the 22nd of March , 1508 .
__label__1	‘ Fine night , sir. ’ ‘ Very much so indeed , ’ replied <NAME> , as the waiter placed a small decanter of brandy , and some hot water before him .
__label__1	`` I think , '' replies <NAME> after pensively tracing out a cross-wrinkle in his forehead with the brush-handle , `` that mischeevious consequences is always meant when money 's asked for . ''
__label__1	In the active superintendence of this young person , <NAME> appears to attain a perfectly geological age and to date from the remotest periods .
__label__0	He knows well that it would risk the brig , if the sea got up ever so little !
__label__1	‘ I can ’ t account for more than five , ’ said <NAME> , with an air of perplexity .
__label__1	If there 's any stuff in the world that I hate and detest , it 's the stuff he and Ma talk .
__label__0	<NAME> , that 's a sad memory !
__label__0	He who is mistaken in an action which he sincerely believes to be right may be an enemy , but retains our esteem .
__label__1	'_I_ did that , sir , ' said a great lubberly fellow , stepping forward ; 'and preciously I cut my knuckle agin ' his mouth .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> had an observatory built in the southern part of the province of <NAME> , at <NAME> , commanding a most splendid view over the sea , and seeming as though it must have been placed there to seek for some unknown land ; he also established a naval college , where learned geographers traced correct maps and taught the use of the mariner 's compass .
__label__0	I am <NAME> , a merchant at <NAME> ” And suddenly he left the public room , whilst for the last time the words re-echoed , “ My son !
__label__0	Still , during the nights following August 16th the darkness was never very marked ; the sun , although it had set , still gave light enough by refraction .
__label__0	But suddenly an unexpected incident occurred .
__label__0	“ At a distance there ’ s no great difference , ” remarked <NAME> .
__label__0	Soon she was within two miles of the sand-banks , which were still veiled from time to time in thick mist .
__label__1	Has he been here , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Here , in this room .
__label__0	<NAME> ! ” “ <NAME> ! ” interrupted <NAME> .
__label__0	As a precaution , the doctor had urged his companions to prepare themselves for some time beforehand , and to `` train '' with much care .
__label__1	It is divided into boxes , for the solitary confinement of travellers , and is furnished with a clock , a looking-glass , and a live waiter , which latter article is kept in a small kennel for washing glasses , in a corner of the apartment .
__label__0	<NAME> , on the 26th of May , in the midst of a fog and a snow-storm , the <NAME> found herself off <NAME> ; a lofty , steep mountain was soon recognized ; the weather got a little clearer , and at midday the sun appeared long enough to permit an observation to be taken : latitude 74° 4 ' , and longitude 84° 23 ' .
__label__1	‘ I didn ’ t tell her who you were , either , or where you ’ d seen her .
__label__1	‘ I submit that , in the present company , that ‘ ere song ’ s political ; and , wot ’ s much the same , that it ain ’ t true .
__label__1	They have wondered how I have suffered it .
__label__0	To the merchants succeed the missionaries .
__label__1	Then would the noble lord , or right honourable gentleman , in whose department it was to defend the <NAME> Office , put an orange in his pocket , and make a regular field-day of the occasion .
__label__0	But was such an operation possible ?
__label__1	One or another on ‘ em , ’ said the turnkey , repudiating beforehand the refusal of all his suggestions .
__label__0	The scheme seems tenable ; and I shall be ready to co-operate with you , to the best of my power , in putting it into execution. ” “ Only , remember , ” continued <NAME> , “ there are many chances to one against our success .
__label__0	On the 14th of December , when the rainy season was drawing to a close , <NAME> and <NAME> started for <NAME> .
__label__1	It may be near , it may be distant ; while the road lasts , nothing turns me . ''
__label__1	‘ He ’ s here , sir , ’ rejoined Mr Swiveller .
__label__0	`` Why , what are you saying ?
__label__1	In either case , it would appear that Mr Clennam is put altogether out of the question , and that we have nothing to do with him or he with us .
__label__0	I crept through the opening , which had already admitted my two companions .
__label__0	He had scarcely been there five minutes when a hand was laid heavily on his shoulder .
__label__0	After a few seconds a faint rumbling was heard , which grew louder and louder .
__label__0	They descended to the shop .
__label__0	He was like a sister of mercy , like a mother by the bed of her child .
__label__1	It was her lord himself who became -- unlike the last theme in the mind , according to the observation of most philosophers -- the subject of Mrs Flintwinch ’ s dream .
__label__0	We were enabled to form an approximate idea of the truth .
__label__1	I am never mealy with ’ em .
__label__0	At the end of this gulf <NAME> hoped to find a channel through which he could reach the <NAME> , but he was disappointed .
__label__0	Tell us what we ought to do , and we will do it. ” “ I am at your orders , master , ” added <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Why all three are his own , ’ returned <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> , father ! ” And the young enthusiast , whose imagination was already stirred , continued to her brother and to <NAME> : “ Let us be off to the library !
__label__1	The meek man was afraid we must take it as proved , because there were the Inquests and the <NAME> ’ s returns .
__label__1	Little <NAME> thanked her , and said , shyly , bread-and-butter and tea was all she usually -- ‘ Oh nonsense my dear child I can never hear of that , ’ said <NAME> , turning on the urn in the most reckless manner , and making herself wink by splashing hot water into her eyes as she bent down to look into the teapot .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , compassionating his follower ’ s confusion and embarrassment .
__label__0	Thus had they been borne upon the unknown deep for twenty-five days , their resources were completely exhausted , and they had not eaten for forty-eight hours , when the boat , with its occupants lying inanimate at the bottom of it , was sighted from <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> , uneasy at the projects formed by <NAME> with a view of attacking her possessions in <NAME> , and at the offers of alliance made by him through <NAME> to the <NAME> of <NAME> , resolved to send an embassy to the court of <NAME> , hoping to gain the king over to the interests of the <NAME> Company .
__label__0	Never before had the <NAME> power in <NAME> been exposed to such danger , and if , as they had hoped , the sepoys had received assistance from without , the influence and supremacy in <NAME> of the <NAME> would have been a thing of the past .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> seemed afraid of a renewal of hostilities , and interposing began : ‘ <NAME> ! ’ ‘ I beg your pardon , ’ observed my aunt with a keen look .
__label__1	If I am correctly informed , he is cognizant of the business on which I wish to speak to you . '
__label__0	“ These horses are engaged by me , ” he said .
__label__0	`` Quite possible , on the contrary , '' returned <NAME> .
__label__1	The mail takes the lead in a four-horse waggon , and all the coaches follow in procession : headed by No .
__label__1	The fact is , he had been originally jobbed out by the day , and he never quite got over his old habits .
__label__1	‘ How came -- eh ! -- oh -- demmit , how d ’ ye do ? ’ ‘ I have been waiting , here some time , ma ’ am , ’ said <NAME> , addressing <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ I never thought you ’ d get better .
__label__1	'You do n't mean to go yourself , I suppose ? '
__label__1	Would you ! ’ <NAME> had caught him round the body .
__label__1	Some of these knights had their own weapons , helmets , coats of mail , hanging upon the walls hard by , and dangling from rusty hooks .
__label__0	On the whole , this month of October , the first of the southern spring , was not ushered in by satisfactory tokens , and the wind had a tendency to shift from one point of the compass to another , which rendered it impossible to count upon settled weather .
__label__1	Of the men , the greater part were armed in various ways ; of the women , some wore knives , some daggers , some ate and drank as they looked on , many knitted .
__label__1	Confound you sit down ! ’ <NAME> dropped into the chair nearest the door , and Mr <NAME> walked up and down the room ; rapidly at first ; then , more slowly .
__label__1	Not that he has any suspicions , but that he may as well know what they are up to in there .
__label__0	At least , no one could complain that they had been deceived as to the nature of the goods .
__label__0	he repeated , and his voice was choked , as if his throat was seized in an iron grasp .
__label__0	“ There is no one here , ” said the reporter .
__label__0	`` <NAME> , <NAME> , you have an answer for everything , '' was my only reply .
__label__1	Your mind will be more at peace , lying here , if you make Lizzie your wife .
__label__1	‘ From day to day I feel this .
__label__0	But we could n't turn our Projectile into a stable , you know . ''
__label__1	He awoke to this , and he awoke to more .
__label__0	“ I thought , captain , ” said <NAME> , “ that turtles , once placed on their backs , could not regain their feet , especially when they are of a large size ? ’ “ That is true , my boy , ” replied <NAME> .
__label__0	He had put <NAME> at the helm , posting himself in the bows , inspecting the water , whilst he held the halliard in his hand , ready to lower the sail at a moment 's notice .
__label__1	But we went to Mr Chivery before we came to the gate , and he brought us in , and got <NAME> ’ s room for us -- my poor old room , you know -- and we waited there a little .
__label__0	`` Promise , then , '' continued <NAME> , `` to carry out my last wishes , and I shall be repaid for all I have done for you . ''
__label__1	It ’ s one or the other. ’ ‘ Don ’ t distress yourself by worrying your mind about it , ’ he returned , with infinite forbearance .
__label__1	‘ You could go away , and grow almost out of knowledge , and never come to tell your poor old friend how fortunate you were , proud lad !
__label__0	It was the most precious thing the geographer possessed .
__label__1	And should you like to be always taken care of here , if you were industrious and deserving ? ’ ‘ Oh , mum ! -- But there ’ s Mrs Higden , ’ said <NAME> , checking himself in his raptures , drawing back , and shaking his head with very serious meaning .
__label__0	<NAME> stags and graceful roebucks scampered off beneath the bushes , and a well-aimed bullet would assuredly have stopped them .
__label__0	The prisoner mentioned is not the captain at all , but one of my own countrymen ; and his companion , who was assassinated by the <NAME> , was <NAME> .
__label__1	So , leaving word with the shopman on what day I was wanted at <NAME> 's again , I set off on the four-mile walk to our forge ; pondering , as I went along , on all I had seen , and deeply revolving that I was a common laboring-boy ; that my hands were coarse ; that my boots were thick ; that I had fallen into a despicable habit of calling knaves <NAME> ; that I was much more ignorant than I had considered myself last night , and generally that I was in a low-lived bad way .
__label__0	They looked in vain for some harbor of refuge , and the terrified horses galloped so wildly along that the riders could hardly keep their saddles .
__label__1	“ You acted noble , my boy , ” said he .
__label__0	The inventory of the articles possessed by these castaways from the clouds , thrown upon a coast which appeared to be uninhabited , was soon made out .
__label__0	Arrived at <NAME> , <NAME> saw with extreme satisfaction that the “ Bonadventure ” was tranquilly floating in the narrow creek .
__label__1	`` Slander those who tell it ye !
__label__1	This matter is not at all in my course of practice and is not in my office .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> , don ’ t you hear a knock ? ’ ‘ I ’ ll answer the door in one moment , <NAME> , ’ replied the clerk .
__label__0	The drops of water were changed to sharp spikes .
__label__1	Sometimes she glanced out of the window , as though she thought we were going slowly , though indeed we were going fast ; but otherwise remained exactly as at first .
__label__1	Everything within reach of your hand , in good preservation .
__label__1	She is very much alone .
__label__0	All these questions , which would no doubt be answered the next day , kept them in suspense , and at the dawn of day they all fixed their gaze on the western horizon .
__label__1	The same face : the very same .
__label__1	Slowly , at last , he moved his eyes from my face , as if he were waking from a vision , and cast them round the room .
__label__1	You are not more than ordinarily honourable , perhaps ? ” I announce myself , “ <NAME> , a gentleman from the birth , and a gentleman to the death ; but _not_ more than ordinarily honourable .
__label__1	I am afraid you ’ ll find me very dull .
__label__0	<NAME> perceived that he could no longer hope to carry out his project .
__label__0	The pirates had evidently destroyed everything that concerned either the captain or the owners of the <NAME> , and , as the name of her port was not painted on her counter , there was nothing which would tell them her nationality .
__label__0	After looking keenly I found a small town of that name on the borders of the <NAME> , about four miles from <NAME> .
__label__1	In pursuance of this plan , we went into <NAME> on an early day and presented ourselves at <NAME> 's door .
__label__1	If he followed it by mere fortuitous coincidence , it was done by an evil chance .
__label__0	Yes , but not for everything !
__label__1	At another time , he would be rumbled up out of his soundest sleep , in the dead of the night ; at another , would be kept at his post eight-and-forty hours on end .
__label__0	The guide made her drink a little brandy and water , but the drowsiness which stupefied her could not yet be shaken off .
__label__0	The spectacle spread out before us was alike grand and terrible .
__label__0	The crew then landed and pursued the natives , who made no attempt to resist them .
__label__0	“ Our tinder is just like wet sponge. ” “ We can dispense with it , ” replied <NAME> .
__label__0	“ Let go the anchor , ” said he .
__label__0	<NAME> degrees multiplied by five hours give seventy-five degrees .
__label__0	<NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and I took our places in the stern of the boat .
__label__1	Afterwards , when <NAME> came to reflect on what had passed , he was so very much impressed by the strength of <NAME> 's anxiety on this point that in telling me generally of his first visit to <NAME> 's Inn he particularly dwelt upon it .
__label__0	The depressions in the soil are covered with a black , rich loam , on which there is a vigorous vegetation .
__label__1	‘ Look here ! ’ she said , striking the scar again , with a relentless hand .
__label__1	'Do not close your heart against all my efforts to help you , ' said <NAME> , stepping gently forward .
__label__1	A blunderbuss and two swords hung above the chimney-piece , for the terror of evil-doers , but the blunderbuss was rusty and shattered , and the swords were broken and edgeless .
__label__1	But my understanding for all this was gone .
__label__1	They left her at the corner of the street , and <NAME> led the way to <NAME> 's , which was within a few minutes ' walk .
__label__1	While these occurrences were in progress , <NAME> made the discovery that <NAME> had a fascinating influence over her .
__label__0	“ <NAME> , my heart is broken ; and sometimes despair nearly masters me .
__label__1	After a moment ’ s hesitation , the young man stretched out his to meet it ; <NAME> clutched his fingers in a grip that for the moment stopped the current of the blood within them , and pressing his other hand upon his lip and frowning towards the unsuspicious <NAME> , released them and sat down .
__label__1	<NAME> will turn you , won ’ t it ?
__label__0	In these two men <NAME> recognized with astonishment , which everyone will understand , two personages of whom he was not thinking at all , and whom he had never expected to see again .
__label__0	`` Poets like <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> ? ''
__label__1	And thus , while he was mentally turning the kindest of kind faces on Wegg this morning , he was not absolutely sure but that he might somehow deserve the charge of turning his back on him .
__label__0	Races between the officers , masquerades and theatrical entertainments , with the temperature maintained at 50 degrees <NAME> kept all the men healthy and happy until the thaw , which set in on the 20th July , 1825 , enabled <NAME> to resume exploring operations .
__label__0	In the earlier days of her formation , while still in a state of mobility , she had been probably a perfect sphere in shape , but , under the influence of terrestrial gravity operating for uncounted ages , she was drawn at last so much towards the centre of attraction as to resemble somewhat a prolate spheriod .
__label__1	I am better with Pa than any one -- more innocent , more sorry , more glad ! ’ So , crying out in a wild way that she could not bear this , <NAME> drooped her head on Mrs <NAME> ’ s ready breast .
__label__1	The pace at which they went , was such a very lazy , ill-looking saunter , that <NAME> soon began to think his companions were going to deceive the old gentleman , by not going to work at all .
__label__1	He ’ s so wrapped up in high life , that the least allusion to business or worldly matters -- like that woman just now , for instance -- quite distracts him ; but , as I often say , I think his disappointment a great thing for him , because if he hadn ’ t been disappointed he couldn ’ t have written about blighted hopes and all that ; and the fact is , if it hadn ’ t happened as it has , I don ’ t believe his genius would ever have come out at all. ’ How much more communicative <NAME> might have become under more favourable circumstances , it is impossible to divine , but as the gloomy one was within ear-shot , and the fire wanted making up , her disclosures stopped here .
__label__0	`` Yes , <NAME> , and you know he is not given to vain imaginations . ''
__label__0	The substitution of electricity for steam as a motive power means the expenditure of coal just the same .
__label__1	What she had overheard was a reason , not for soothing herself , but for saving him ; and <NAME> did it , in pursuance of the study of her heart .
__label__1	What is their unanimous declaration ?
__label__1	The <NAME> of My Resolution XIV .
__label__0	An observation had just given 55° 7 ' latitude and 41° 13 ' longitude .
__label__1	If none of the new family were particularly at home in private , it was resolved that <NAME> at least should be at home in public , without delay .
__label__1	“ Well , <NAME> , you know , ” replied <NAME> , as if that were a little unreasonable , “ you yourself see me put 'em in my 'at , and therefore you know as they are here. ” With which he took them out , and gave them , not to <NAME> , but to me .
__label__1	<NAME> ’ t moddley-coddley , there ’ s a good fellow .
__label__1	'You were not suspected of holding any communication with anybody on the subject which has brought us here to-night , I hope ? '
__label__1	Mrs. Perkins and Mrs. Piper compare opinions on the subject of the young lady of professional celebrity who assists at the <NAME> and who has a space to herself in the manuscript announcement in the window , Mrs. Perkins possessing information that she has been married a year and a half , though announced as <NAME> , the noted siren , and that her baby is clandestinely conveyed to the <NAME> 's <NAME> every night to receive its natural nourishment during the entertainments .
__label__1	`` How do you do , Mr .
__label__0	The kibitka was thus in the whirlpool , and the horse was nearly exhausted , when , all at once , <NAME> , throwing off such of his garments as might impede him , jumped into the water ; then , seizing with a strong hand the bridle of the terrified horse , he gave him such an impulse that he managed to struggle out of the circle , and getting again into the current , the kibitka drifted along anew .
__label__0	`` What can I say , my man ? ''
__label__0	I can then judge whether or not <NAME> diverges from the straight line . ''
__label__0	April 28th passed by without any sign of the existence of the enemy .
__label__1	Then you see , <NAME> , '' he returns , `` you are not to be trusted .
__label__1	The knocker made a more energetic reply than words could have yielded , for it continued to hammer with surprising force and noise , without a moment ’ s cessation .
__label__0	`` Certainly , <NAME> , '' answered <NAME> .
__label__1	At one time , she was all cordiality and ease ; at another , all stiffness and frigidity .
__label__1	‘ Mr Riah , it ’ s of no use my holding back the fact .
__label__0	`` Calm yourself , my dear boy , and endeavor to use your reason .
__label__0	Always on the look-out for fresh water and provisions , <NAME> in vain looked for the bay which <NAME> had spoken of as abounding in game .
__label__1	‘ Well , good-bye , then , ’ said the old gentleman .
__label__0	The new revelation did not improve poor <NAME> 's fate a bit -- no matter for that !
__label__0	Under these peculiar circumstances it might have been allowable to postpone the journey till the morning .
__label__1	Standing at the door was a Jewish man with an unnatural heavy smear of eyebrow , who caught my eyes as we advanced , and said , when we came up with him , -- “ Mr .
__label__0	`` Well , and have we a fair wind ? ''
__label__1	Ugh ! -- to prevent my crying out , and then cruelly assaulted me. ’ ‘ With this ? ’ asked <NAME> , showing the pieces of cane .
__label__0	But this extraordinary creature could transport itself from one place to another with surprising velocity ; as , in an interval of three days , the Governor <NAME> and the <NAME> had observed it at two different points of the chart , separated by a distance of more than seven hundred nautical leagues .
__label__1	If I go farther , and observe that I can not readily conceive how ANY right of mine can be a minor point , I speak not so much in reference to myself as an individual as in reference to the family position I have it in charge to maintain . ''
__label__1	I haven ’ t seen her for this many a week. ’ ‘ How ’ s that ? ’ asked <NAME> .
__label__0	`` What about those six convicts who disembarked on the right bank of the <NAME> ? ''
__label__0	It is seldom that a ship is so roughly treated as ours has been , and I consider it real bad luck , after our having profited by such fortunate circumstances -- '' `` These circumstances are all over , <NAME> , '' exclaimed <NAME> , `` and I fear indeed -- '' `` What -- you also , boatswain -- you whom I believed to be so confident ! ''
__label__0	His companions were still ignorant of this , for he had not informed them of the result at which he aimed .
__label__0	If , then , the steam remains in its normal or habitual state , if their energy does not increase , and if you add to this , the remark that the wind is not replaced by heavy atmospheric pressure and dead calm , you may be quite sure that there is no fear of any immediate eruption . ''
__label__1	Is there so much hurry in this going away , that <NAME> , with a wave of her hand , sweeps on , and is gone !
__label__1	6 , in the court. ’ ‘ There is a double wallflower at <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> , the world is before you ; and it is most probable that as you enter it , so it will receive you .
__label__1	‘ I screamed rather than talked , for I felt tumultuous passions eddying through my veins , and the old spirits whispering and taunting me to tear his heart out .
__label__0	By means of some fragments of cordage , he had again made the raft seaworthy .
__label__0	“ Because this document is a cryptogram , and -- -- ” “ Well ? ” “ We have not got the key ! ” THIS WAS a contingency which neither Joam Dacosta nor his people could have anticipated .
__label__0	The narrative says , -- `` He soon proved the truth of the proverb , that a man is never a prophet in his own country .
__label__1	`` Of <NAME> , '' says <NAME> , hitting him again .
__label__1	‘ Do you think he won ’ t ? ’ cried <NAME> , really showing great capability for the stage .
__label__0	The wind gave signs only too threatening of the breeze rising to a gale ; but , fortunately , the waves did not culminate in breakers , but rather in a long swell which ran in the same direction as the vessel .
__label__1	Then <NAME> proposed : `` A <NAME> Christmas to us all , my dears .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> hopes he will have the goodness to -- '' I tell you , sergeant , I have nothing to say to you .
__label__1	They ’ re wittles and drink to me -- lodging , wife , and children -- reading , writing , and <NAME> -- snuff , tobacker , and sleep. ’ ‘ That ain ’ t a sort of man to see sitting behind a coach-box , is it though ? ’ said <NAME> in my ear , as he handled the reins .
__label__1	YOU want more painstaking and search-making !
__label__1	Two cognovits -- take care of them .
__label__0	The day began to fade , and with the day the breeze fell also .
__label__0	“ I am a poet , ” said <NAME> .
__label__1	He laid open his affairs without the smallest reserve , and descanted at some length upon the merits of his company , and the acquirements of his family ; of both of which , the two broad-sword boys formed an honourable portion .
__label__0	In a few minutes , a tall fellow of five and twenty , with a merry face , smiling eyes , a laughing mouth , and sandy hair , appeared at the bottom of the luminous cone which was thrown from his lantern , and set foot on the landing of the fifteenth ladder .
__label__0	M'Nicholl took upon himself to fasten the door of the trap on the inside by means of a powerful combination of screws and bolts of his own invention .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> was baffled by mother and son .
__label__0	Falling from the neutral point , the Projectile should strike the <NAME> with a velocity of more than 25,000 miles an hour !
__label__1	The joy attended <NAME> through his struggle with <NAME> on the brink of the orchestra and the grave , and slackened no more until he had tumbled the king off the kitchen-table , and had died by inches from the ankles upward .
__label__1	From that blessed little room , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , the Vicar of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , came out , a glorious host , to keep me company .
__label__1	It ’ s enough for me to see how loving you and your husband are .
__label__0	We shall shortly see how emulation spread among the various nations .
__label__1	' I never thought you had told us anything but the truth , ' said <NAME> , soothing him .
__label__1	She is fond of fun and frolic , and when playing with the rest of the children , her shrill laugh sounds loudest of the group .
__label__0	<NAME> , you are taken ; taken , you are executed .
__label__1	When I had made this discovery , I went back , in an attraction I could not resist , to a lane by Mrs. <NAME> ’ s , and looked over the corner of the garden wall .
__label__1	Meanwhile you shall have a little taste of something that ’ ll do you good , for I ’ m sure you must want it after all you ’ ve gone through to-day .
__label__0	Moreover , a sultry heat oppressed the plain .
__label__1	Upon these were laid knives and forks for six or eight people .
__label__1	I am not a bad compiler , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , preserving the same air of cheerful confidence in all he said , ‘ but I have no invention at all ; not a particle .
__label__0	“ <NAME> ! ” cried the engineer , seizing the arm of the man whom he had just found again under such unexpected circumstances .
__label__1	It brought a vague expression of dissatisfaction into Mr <NAME> ’ s face ; but the door being opened , it was quickly gone .
__label__0	`` Yes , if we were near enough to the bank , and if the vessel was floating at the time .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> , quiet and unmoved , as a man of so much respectability ought to be , takes off his close black gloves as if he were skinning his hands , lifts off his tight hat as if he were scalping himself , and sits down at his desk .
__label__1	There was not much to amuse in the room ; of which the most attractive feature was , a half-length portrait in oil , of <NAME> , whom the artist had depicted scratching his head in an easy manner , and thus displaying to advantage a diamond ring , the gift of <NAME> before her marriage .
__label__0	The doctor stepped along with great dignity , the waganga surrounding him and keeping off the crowd .
__label__1	Although <NAME> said this with sufficient ill-humour , he did not seem to feel himself quite at liberty to remain silent ; for , after stretching himself very often , and declaring with a shiver that it was ‘ infernal cold , ’ he made an experiment at the breakfast-table , and proving more successful in it than his less-seasoned friend , remained there .
__label__1	After bidding the old man good night , <NAME> retired to her poor garret , but had scarcely closed the door , when it was gently tapped at .
__label__0	A young <NAME> , of about fifteen years of age , then advanced .
__label__1	‘ You think this thumped head of mine is excited ? ’ <NAME> went on , with a high look ; ‘ not so , believe me .
__label__1	He suffered for this on several occasions ; and particularly once , when <NAME> laughed in church , and the <NAME> thought it was <NAME> , and took him out .
__label__1	‘ Has the post come in ? ’ ‘ No. ’ ‘ Any other letters ? ’ ‘ One. ’ Newman eyed him closely , and laid it on the desk .
__label__1	<NAME> ’ t you think so ? ’ ‘ Yes. ’ ‘ We know we have done right , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Yes. ’ ‘ We know we are better so , even now ? ’ ‘ And shall be far , far better so by-and-by. ’ Still there was that lingering tenderness in their hearts towards the old positions they were relinquishing , that they prolonged their parting .
__label__1	No , no , not for the world ! ’ ‘ Is it really gone though ? ’ said <NAME> , looking at <NAME> with a face as pale as his own .
__label__1	I rarely heard from <NAME> , and never from <NAME> : but two or three parcels of made or mended clothes had come up for me , consigned to <NAME> , and in each there was a scrap of paper to the effect that <NAME> trusted D. C. was applying himself to business , and devoting himself wholly to his duties -- not the least hint of my ever being anything else than the common drudge into which I was fast settling down .
__label__0	There is what will furnish us with linen for years .
__label__1	I ’ ll be your servant , constant and trew .
__label__1	<NAME> , having taken the pony to a neighbouring stable , was at work at a desk in this room , which had a brass frame on the top to hang paper upon , and on which the writing he was making a copy of was then hanging .
__label__1	It is the last bottle of the old Madiera .
__label__1	‘ I am very happy to receive such support in my opinion , sir , ’ he rejoined .
__label__0	This officer , after attaining the highest rank in the military marine service , had been entrusted with an important command in <NAME> , and had assisted in the capture of <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Here ’ s a game ! ’ roared the populace .
__label__1	Pictures and prints of vessels fighting with the rolling waves filled her with alarm .
__label__1	The first time I passed <NAME> , <NAME> and I were pulling a pair of oars ; and , both in going and returning , we saw the blind towards the east come down .
__label__1	These gentlemen being rejected after twenty-four hours ’ pleasantry , Mr <NAME> consented to remain , and did remain , until a club of choice spirits called a <NAME> jury ( who were in the joke ) summoned him to a trial before twelve other wags for perjury and fraud , who in their turn found him guilty with a most facetious joy , -- nay , the very populace entered into the whim , and when Mr <NAME> was moving in a hackney-coach towards the building where these wags assembled , saluted him with rotten eggs and carcases of kittens , and feigned to wish to tear him into shreds , which greatly increased the comicality of the thing , and made him relish it the more , no doubt .
__label__1	Oh dear , dear , not on any account .
__label__0	“ He ’ s a wag , ” said the Jew to the <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , shaking him by the arm ; and his whisper was so audible now , that <NAME> felt it unnecessary to repeat his words ; ‘ you have not forgotten yourself , I hope ? ’ ‘ No , sir , no , ’ returned the <NAME> , showing his face , and shaking his head , and rubbing his hands in great agitation .
__label__1	After still looking hard at <NAME> from his throne , as he shook his head , and rubbed his hands , and remained in the same state of agitation , <NAME> turned to <NAME> , and said : ‘ Now , sir , as he don ’ t condescend to tell me , what is this ? ’ <NAME> evaded the question for a little while ; looking in scorn and anger on his opponent , and remaining silent .
__label__1	‘ Go about your business. ’ But in taking them with so little ceremony , Mr <NAME> dropped one on the floor , and did not see what he had done ; neither did Mr Dombey observe the letter lying near his feet .
__label__0	Many died , amongst them <NAME> , the surgeon , <NAME> , and little Tayeto .
__label__0	As soon as he had obtained satisfaction the captain started for <NAME> with <NAME> who was to settle on that island .
__label__1	I do n't care for what you say at all .
__label__1	After a time she arose , and with feeble and tottering steps ascended the street .
__label__0	He turned , and was stupefied .
__label__1	‘ No , I won ’ t go so far as to say that , ’ urged the cherub , a little remonstrant against the very decisive and unpitying tone ; ‘ but he mightn ’ t have suited <NAME> , or <NAME> mightn ’ t have suited him , or fifty things , whereas now I hope she can choose for herself. ’ ‘ Has she -- as you place the confidence in me of speaking on the subject , you will excuse my asking -- has she -- perhaps -- chosen ? ’ faltered the Secretary .
__label__1	Then observing that his companion was fast asleep , he added in an earnest whisper , ‘ <NAME> ’ s the friend , remember -- not Short. ’ ‘ Making some nosegays , ’ the child replied ; ‘ I am going to try and sell some , these three days of the races .
__label__0	We there found M. N -- -- and his party , safe and sound .
__label__0	It was evident that after having reached Reptile End , <NAME> and his companions would not have time to return before dark to their encampment near the source of the <NAME> .
__label__1	He complied , and I went on alone .
__label__1	A charming reflection sir , very charming ! ’ While he addressed his clerk in these words , Mr <NAME> was , somewhat ostentatiously , engaged in minutely examining and holding up against the light a five-pound bank note , which he had brought in , in his hand .
__label__0	My head got better again .
__label__0	I do call that ingenious ! ''
__label__1	Let me first tell you , once for all , that it ’ s of no use your paying visits to me .
__label__1	“ His goods , ” said <NAME> , after turning it over in his mind , “ is a branch of <NAME> goods. ” “ Persons ' bodies , ai n't it , father ? ” asked the lively boy .
__label__1	And last evening , ’ added Mrs. Nickleby , with increased confusion , ‘ he called gently over the wall , as I was walking in the garden , and proposed marriage , and an elopement .
__label__1	Come and kiss your Bluffy ! ''
__label__1	But tell him , sir , ’ she had shrunk away from him , ‘ if you don ’ t feel too hard to me to do it , that I never was in any way the cause of his misfortune. ’ ‘ It has never been attributed to you , ’ I returned , earnestly responding to her earnestness .
__label__0	Nothing could be easier than to execute this project , and this is how the engineer intended to set to work .
__label__0	Torrents swollen by a tremendous downpour had destroyed gardens , walls , and buildings , laid waste plantations , all but demolished one fort , swept down a number of houses in the town , and rendered several streets impassable .
__label__1	There happened to be no customer in the shop but <NAME> , of the restless fingers and the croaking voice .
__label__1	`` I 'm a-cleaning the upstairs back room , miss , '' replies <NAME> .
__label__0	All these and many other portions of the submarine apparatus which had been employed that very year for clearing the channel , lifting the wrecks and recovering the treasure , lay now at <NAME> , unused fortunately on account of the season of the year , and therefore they could be readily obtained for the asking .
__label__1	At the same time , the thin straight lines of the setting of the eyes , and the thin straight lips , and the markings in the nose , curved with a sarcasm that looked handsomely diabolic .
__label__0	Each bottle , therefore , produced as many currents as united would be sufficient to produce all the phenomena of the electric telegraph .
__label__1	“ -- wasted , my child -- should not be wasted , struck aside from the natural order of things -- for my sake .
__label__0	`` Well , <NAME> , '' he asked , `` are you now convinced of the reality of the voyage of the <NAME> , or do you still regard <NAME> 's book as a work of pure imagination ? ''
__label__1	Consequently she made out nothing , and Mr Dombey in his den remained a very shade .
__label__1	‘ Indeed , ’ said Mrs. Nickleby , ‘ I don ’ t think she ever was better , since she had the hooping-cough , scarlet-fever , and measles , all at the same time , and that ’ s the fact. ’ ‘ Is that letter for me ? ’ growled <NAME> , pointing to the little packet Mrs. <NAME> held in her hand .
__label__1	‘ What did you think of that ? ’ asked <NAME> , when <NAME> went round to the stage again .
__label__1	But before he had gone very far , he began to reason with himself as to the nature of this frightful appearance ; and as he reasoned , he relaxed his speed by gradual degrees ; until at last he stopped , and faced about .
__label__0	This ill success had cost the loss of a ship ’ s crew .
__label__1	At first the whelp would not draw any nearer , but persisted in remaining up there by himself .
__label__1	I have very strong reasons indeed , for entertaining that wish .
__label__1	said the girl , with an expression of pleasure at his return .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> , however , could not feel sure about it ; neither could <NAME> be satisfied on the subject , often repeating , “ Nell has clearly been mixed up with all this secret business .
__label__1	I am sure you don ’ t. ’ ‘ I do , ’ returned the old woman .
__label__0	The <NAME> had been steaming on for almost two hours , when the young <NAME> , addressing herself to <NAME> , said , “ Are you going to <NAME> , brother ? ” “ Yes , sister , ” answered the young man .
__label__1	Now you 're a-going to poll-pry and question according to custom -- I know what you 're a-going to be up to .
__label__1	The very tall young man who suffered from excitement early , is better ; but a vague sentiment of repentance has seized upon him , and he hates the other very tall young man , and wrests dishes from him by violence , and takes a grim delight in disobliging the company .
__label__1	He was writing at a table , with a great confusion of clothes , tin cases , books , boots , brushes , and portmanteaus strewn all about the floor .
__label__1	One Dowager , <NAME> calls it lip-salve .
__label__0	He himself did not , however , look upon the situation in quite the same favourable light .
__label__1	She walked on as before , growing more familiar with me as we proceeded and talking cheerfully by the way , but she said no more about her home , beyond remarking that we were going quite a new road and asking if it were a short one .
__label__1	By the merest accident , of course ! ’ In effect , the swain was standing up in his gondola , card-case in hand , affecting to put the question to a servant .
__label__1	We was to be umble to this person , and umble to that ; and to pull off our caps here , and to make bows there ; and always to know our place , and abase ourselves before our betters .
__label__0	After a night 's rest , it was renewed the day following , the 31st , with some vigor , and a good part of the ocean lying between <NAME> and <NAME> islands was carefully investigated to a depth of seven or eight hundred feet .
__label__0	Evidently that was his trade , as they could plainly see from the way he set about repairing the forepart of the wagon .
__label__0	“ <NAME> , mind you give it a wide berth. ” “ Yes , captain , ” answered the sailor , throwing his whole weight on the great oar that steered the raft .
__label__1	'Stand still , a minute , ' cried the voice ; ' I 'll be with you directly . '
__label__1	To think that this lost child , who was to have divided with him his riches , and his projects , and his power , and allied with whom he was to have shut out all the world as with a double door of gold , should have let in such a herd to insult him with their knowledge of his defeated hopes , and their boasts of claiming community of feeling with himself , so far removed : if not of having crept into the place wherein he would have lorded it , alone !
__label__1	I will simply make statements , therefore , and not put questions .
__label__1	‘ A magnum of the double-diamond , <NAME> , to drink the health of Mr Linkinwater. ’ Instantly , by a feat of dexterity , which was the admiration of all the company , and had been , annually , for some years past , the apoplectic butler , bringing his left hand from behind the small of his back , produced the bottle with the corkscrew already inserted ; uncorked it at a jerk ; and placed the magnum and the cork before his master with the dignity of conscious cleverness .
__label__0	A constitution of exceptional vigour is necessary to enable a traveller to bear the fatigue , privations , and interruptions of every kind with which he has to contend in these unhealthy districts , with impunity .
__label__1	We are extra official. ” I cordially assented .
__label__0	it is a fine death for a sailor ! ''
__label__1	The <NAME> touched him on the arm , and pointed to his younger self , intent upon his reading .
__label__1	`` You 'll want all day to-morrow , I suppose ? ''
__label__0	said the doctor ; `` nothing yet !
__label__1	I had more than once approached this subject of my thoughts with Mrs. Rachael , our only servant , who took my light away when I was in bed ( another very good woman , but austere to me ) , and she had only said , `` Esther , good night ! ''
__label__0	Both animals and birds , influenced by the heaviness of the atmosphere , remained motionless and silent .
__label__1	This sum , Mr Clennam would be happy to learn , he had , through the promptitude of several friends who had a lively confidence in his probity , already raised , with the exception of a trifling balance of one pound seventeen and fourpence ; the loan of which balance , for the period of one month , would be fraught with the usual beneficent consequences .
__label__0	In fact , all the grouse flesh had been consumed , and there no longer existed any means of cooking more game .
__label__1	At noon we turned out again , to cross a wide river in another steamboat ; landed at a continuation of the railroad on the opposite shore ; and went on by other cars ; in which , in the course of the next hour or so , we crossed by wooden bridges , each a mile in length , two creeks , called respectively <NAME> and <NAME> .
__label__1	When he told me I had better take a week to consider of what he had said , how could I say I wouldn ’ t take a week , yet how could I fail to know that no amount of weeks could influence such love as mine ?
__label__1	The coach follows because it is attached to them and goes on wheels : not because you are in it .
__label__1	In her own old place sat <NAME> , once more , looking ( but for her dress ) as if she had never left it .
__label__1	<NAME> here , <NAME> ! ’ <NAME> put her finger on her own lip , and then on Pa ’ s , and then on her own lip again , and then on her husband ’ s .
__label__0	`` Besides , '' added <NAME> , `` even to the most piercing eye a man can not be distinguished farther than three and a half miles off ; so that , if there are any Selenites , they can see our projectile , but we can not see them . ''
__label__0	For once <NAME> had no reply to make , he and <NAME> resuming their walk in silence .
__label__0	By this arrangement <NAME> ' two brothers had the whole administration of the colony in their hands .
__label__1	I put it in my mouth for safety , and though my hands trembled a good deal , had just tied the card on very much to my satisfaction , when I felt myself violently chucked under the chin by the long-legged young man , and saw my half-guinea fly out of my mouth into his hand .
__label__1	I could not help adding , `` So unreasonably ! ''
__label__1	I would have withdrawn , but the <NAME> made a gesture to detain me , and I remained .
__label__0	Instead of ascending the gallery , he was going deeper down into the gulf .
__label__1	‘ I found out an <NAME> gen ’ leman as was in authority , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ and told him I was a-going to seek my niece .
__label__1	<NAME> strike you dead on the spot , if ever you split in any way sumever !
__label__1	And very much indebted for the omen .
__label__0	With the fall of the capital was involved , properly speaking , that of the <NAME> empire ; if there were still some resistance , as notably there was in the province of <NAME> , it was of an isolated character , and a few detachments of troops sufficed to reduce to submission the last remaining opponents of the <NAME> , terrified as the Mexicans were by the punishments which had been dealt out to the people of <NAME> , who had revolted .
__label__1	Observations there were none to tell us of , for there was no sun to take them by .
__label__1	And <NAME> , with another short laugh of the purest glee , made her eyes very round again and looked as serious as became my maid .
__label__0	The ship sadly swayed into port , and an icy silence reigned on its deck .
__label__0	After all , it is worth more than a logogryph or a rebus ! ” At these words <NAME> rose , shook hands with the magistrate , and returned to the jangada , feeling more hopeless when he went back than when he set out .
__label__0	It was probable that a disabled vessel had been cast on the coast of the island , that one at least of the crew had been saved , and that by means of the wreck this man , having tools at his disposal , had built the dwelling .
__label__1	I found , now I had leisure to count them , that there were no fewer than six little <NAME> present , in various stages of tumbling up .
__label__1	He was obliged to sit close to it , and brood over it , before he could extract the least sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel .
__label__0	They might now be assured of its success .
__label__1	You won ’ t consider it a liberty ? ’ ‘ I thank you again and again , sir , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	Imprisonment began to tell upon him .
__label__1	When Mr <NAME> had looked at him , and told him he was young , and that his <NAME> ’ s circumstances were not good , there had been an expression of disdain in his face ; a contemptuous and disparaging assumption that he would be quite content to live idly on a reduced old man , which stung the boy ’ s generous soul .
__label__0	asked <NAME> , with his usual politeness .
__label__1	Never did wrap up enough ; ’ the Major being buttoned to the chin .
__label__1	The <NAME> , with an abashed and guilty air , immediately walked on tiptoe to the little parlour and locked himself in .
__label__1	In this self-imposed retirement , the <NAME> passed whole days and weeks without interchanging a word with anyone but Rob the <NAME> , whom he esteemed as a pattern of disinterested attachment and fidelity .
__label__1	On the day following , <NAME> and <NAME> repaired to the market-town , in the hope of seeing or hearing something of the men there ; but this effort was equally fruitless .
__label__0	“ The fire is in the chimney , ” observed <NAME> .
__label__1	The round of visits was made ; and <NAME> , with a discreet use of his blue coaching , came off triumphantly , though with a considerable accession of boredom .
__label__0	`` Twenty-two minutes after eleven , '' returned <NAME> , drawing an enormous silver watch from the depths of his pocket .
__label__0	`` No , sir ; '' was the pert reply ; `` but I think I can safely say I 've heard it spoken about . ''
__label__1	<NAME> has consulted me in reference to what he has in contemplation ; and I have advised him to the best of my judgement. ’ ‘ Unless I deceive myself , <NAME> , ’ pursued <NAME> , ‘ what I contemplate is a disclosure of an important nature. ’ ‘ Highly so , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	Suddenly , a dreadful shock is felt , and the Projectile , shot up by the instantaneous development of 200,000 millions of cubic feet of gas , is flying into space with inconceivable rapidity !
__label__1	Therefore , he stayed to dinner .
__label__0	`` Nothing , except to note the progress of the phenomenon .
__label__1	She was a golden-haired doll ! ” “ Do you know , <NAME> , ” said <NAME> , looking at him with sharp eyes , and slowly drawing a hand across his florid face : “ do you know , I rather thought , at the time , that you sympathised with the golden-haired doll , and were quick to see what happened to the golden-haired doll ? ” “ Quick to see what happened !
__label__0	But <NAME> , less confident , advised them to confine themselves to fact , and more especially so with regard to the building of a vessel -- a really urgent work , since it was for the purpose of depositing , as soon as possible , at <NAME> a document indicating <NAME> ’ s new residence .
__label__0	<NAME> there , the two friends had installed themselves at once , never quitting the summit of their enormous telescope .
__label__1	You don ’ t come in here , ’ said <NAME> ’ s better-half , interposing her person , which was a robust one , in the doorway .
__label__1	He had heard the gates open ; and the badly shod feet that waited outside shuffle in ; and the sweeping , and pumping , and moving about , begin , which commenced the prison morning .
__label__1	‘ And it is in this dark dingy place of captivity , poor dear , that you pass all the hours of your life when you are not at home ? ’ ‘ Not at home , or not on the road there , or on the road here , my love .
__label__1	<NAME> , ’ said I , bolting it out with some difficulty .
__label__1	She ’ s deep , <NAME> , deep , but <NAME> is deeper .
__label__1	My rambles , <NAME> , are over. ’ ‘ How do I know that ‘ ere , sir ? ’ argued <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ I asked him to come. ’ ‘ I am sorry to hear it .
__label__1	Therefore I watched <NAME> closely. ’ Dear , tender little Dora , so unconscious of this Dragon ’ s eye !
__label__1	'You will see them directly , and they will be overjoyed to find you safe and well . '
__label__1	With no greater experience of the world than he had acquired for himself in his short trials ; with a sufficient share of headlong rashness and precipitation ( qualities not altogether unnatural at his time of life ) ; with a very slender stock of money , and a still more scanty stock of friends ; what could he do ?
__label__1	What are his necessities , and what does he require ?
__label__0	the country is already changing its aspect : the villages are fewer and farther between ; the mango-trees have disappeared , for their growth ceases at this latitude .
__label__1	We asked him if he knew what was doing in it .
__label__0	Entranced by the harmony , forgetful of the hour , <NAME> did not notice that it was growing dark .
__label__0	a boat ! ” <NAME> saw it was impossible to undeceive the poor boy , but he tried once more by saying to the man at the wheel : “ Hawkins , you were at the wheel , were you not , when <NAME> was so strangely attacked ? ” “ Yes , your Honor , ” replied <NAME> .
__label__1	said <NAME> , regarding the animal with a kind of grim and ferocious approval .
__label__1	It ’ s not a celebrated name .
__label__1	He took a paper-knife in his hand , turned it over , laid it down , took it up again , and even then had to look along the blade of it , considering how to go on .
__label__0	<NAME> , it was the proceeding employed by <NAME> , and the first metallurgists of the inhabited world .
__label__1	That it is a great work to have cut you away from father ’ s life , and to have made a new and good beginning .
__label__0	This is not , however , the opinion of <NAME> , who looks upon them as a separate tribe of the <NAME> family .
__label__0	`` No , '' said <NAME> , `` let us stretch ourselves on our sides ; we shall resist the shock better that way .
__label__1	‘ I decline to name it , sir , ’ returned <NAME> , suddenly turning loud and sharp .
__label__1	' I shall do you a mischief ! '
__label__1	No veiled future dimly glanced upon him in the moonbeams .
__label__1	Unless it was , I might not be bold enough to say it .
__label__1	‘ It ’ s like you did , <NAME> ’ r <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> to have placed you in this disagreeable situation , ’ said <NAME> , addressing <NAME> ; ‘ allow me to suggest , that the best way of avoiding a recurrence of such scenes in future will be to be more select in the choice of your companions .
__label__1	'What do you propose to do with it ?
__label__1	What else could you have made this young lady out to be , if she had listened to such addresses as yours ? ’ ‘ What else , if I had been so happy as to win her affections and possess her heart ? ’ ‘ Win her affections , ’ retorted Mr Boffin , with ineffable contempt , ‘ and possess her heart !
__label__1	‘ Is that all ? ’ said the mother .
__label__1	In the same spirit he said to the gate-porter as he went out , ‘ If some one staying in the hotel should wish to send across the road to me in the night , a crown will be ready for the messenger. ’ In the same spirit , he walked up and down outside the iron gate for the best part of an hour , with some solicitude ; occasionally looking in between the bars , as if he had laid a dove in a high roost in a cage of lions , and had it on his mind that she might tumble out .
__label__1	“ The reply to this was made by him who had spoken second .
__label__1	Little Dorrit with amazement , saw this , and observed that they exchanged quick looks .
__label__1	I am rational again now , and you shall advise me .
__label__1	It was the man ; the man he had followed in company with the girl , and whom he had overheard talking to <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> up here. ” The two were kept apart , and each walked surrounded by a separate guard .
__label__1	We were disposed , notwithstanding <NAME> ’ s stipulation for my aunt ’ s attendance , to arrange that she should stay at home , and be represented by <NAME> and me .
__label__1	His features were contracted into a perpetual smile ; and his teeth were in such perfect order that it was difficult at a small distance to tell the real from the false .
__label__1	‘ This is not all the good-fortune .
__label__1	The sea has no appreciation of great men , but knocks them about like the small fry .
__label__1	I wondered whether he could be a doctor ; but no , I thought ; he could n't be a doctor , or he would have a quieter and more persuasive manner .
__label__0	`` Much obliged ; it is all very clear , no doubt . ''
__label__1	This is not unselfish in me .
__label__0	From the number on the board he gradually built up a definitive formula , and then noting it on the left , he cleared away the working by which he had arrived at it , and launched forth into an appalling series of figures and signs .
__label__0	Yes , if we could only succeed in getting the schooner afloat again .
__label__1	<NAME> was a trying business to <NAME> , who seemed to have no natural power over a pen , but in whose hand every pen appeared to become perversely animated , and to go wrong and crooked , and to stop , and splash , and sidle into corners like a saddle-donkey .
__label__1	His eye-glass and his watch are ready to his hand .
__label__1	Then , she would draw in her head to look round the room and see that everything was in its place and hadn ’ t moved ; and looking out into the street again , would perhaps see a man passing with a coffin on his back , and two or three others silently following him to a house where somebody lay dead ; which made her shudder and think of such things until they suggested afresh the old man ’ s altered face and manner , and a new train of fears and speculations .
__label__1	<NAME> is very fond of <NAME> , and <NAME> ’ s very fond of him , and if you were to tell about it , the old gentleman would carry you all away miles into the country , where you ’ d see nobody. ’ ‘ No , no , I won ’ t tell , ’ said the fat boy stoutly .
__label__1	As to doing the honours of his coach , his business , as I have said , is with the horses .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> briefly drew attention to these points , and concluded by saying , “ My friends , we must , without delay , hasten to the assistance of this unfortunate man. ” “ For my part , ” said the count , “ I am quite ready to accompany you ; it is not unlikely that he is not alone in his distress. ” Lieutenant Procope expressed much surprise .
__label__0	The roll of distant thunder was heard .
__label__1	He drew in his head ; and <NAME> , left standing in the street , could hear the sash closed , as gently and carefully as it had been opened .
__label__0	It seemed to be of a slimy consistency , as if it had been made of mineral oil .
__label__1	I promise you nothing , ’ said the dolls ’ dressmaker , dabbing two dabs at him with her needle , as if she put out both his eyes .
__label__0	So far , however , cartographers had ignored the corrections made by astronomers .
__label__0	They did not appear surprised , as one would have expected , at the number of new and extraordinary things they met with .
__label__0	But <NAME> did not propose to meddle in the enterprise , which was more industrial than scientific ; and , at the outset , she abandoned any chance she might have of a slice of the Polar cake .
__label__1	After another moment 's listening , <NAME> ( who was a good judge ) agreed , and <NAME> ( who was a bad judge ) agreed .
__label__1	`` But for <NAME> 's modesty , '' said <NAME> , `` I would take leave to correct him and say three distinguished men . ''
__label__0	The crew were almost all the time at work with the saws , and often powder had to be used to blow up the enormous blocks of ice which closed the way .
__label__1	It was a busy time , and I trotted about with him all day long , buying a variety of things of which he stood in need .
__label__1	After <NAME> was restored , we still had to break it to the other eight ; and it produced various effects upon them of a most pathetic nature .
__label__1	I do not say that anything is to be done .
__label__1	He had hardly finished one long resounding knock , when he turned to the knocker again and began another .
__label__0	There was but one way of working .
__label__0	Fortunately the tide carried our frigates into the bay , and we escaped the rocks on the east by half a pistol 's range .
__label__1	`` But , my dear , '' she went on in her mysterious way , `` there 's a dreadful attraction in the place .
__label__0	`` He has been your son for thirty years , '' answered the young girl , laughing , `` and he has only been my betrothed for two ! ''
__label__0	His last resource was to set out across the southern steppe .
__label__0	In addition to <NAME> , it comprised <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , canon of <NAME> , a secretary named <NAME> , a draughtsman , <NAME> , and the scientific <NAME> astronomer , <NAME> .
__label__1	Next day , too , when we all go in a flock to see the house -- our house -- <NAME> ’ s and mine -- I am quite unable to regard myself as its master .
__label__0	`` 'The interest which I , for my part , take in it has caused me to examine the effect of your announcement upon the members of our society , and I can assure you , to use the consecrated phrase of the <NAME> press , that it has produced a profound impression upon the public .
__label__1	And if you do give me three-and-sixpence , deary , I ’ ll tell you something. ’ He counts the money from his pocket , and puts it in her hand .
__label__0	But it attracted little notice , as by this time further , and more curious particulars had been obtained .
__label__0	<NAME> had conveyed his portable kitchen to the oasis , and proceeded to indulge in any number of culinary combinations , using water all the time with the most profuse extravagance .
__label__1	Then our brother was drawn -- swiftly -- to drunkenness .
__label__0	<NAME> saw at once that the young man was <NAME> ; his face was phlegmatic , but pleasant , and at once inspired confidence .
__label__0	<NAME> fell on her knees beside it .
__label__1	Straightway she turned her eyes back to his corner , with the defiance of last night , and moving very cautiously and softly , stretched out her greedy hand .
__label__1	‘ Keep the pot a-bilin ’ , <NAME> ! ’ said <NAME> ; and down went <NAME> again , and then <NAME> , and then <NAME> , and then <NAME> , and then <NAME> , and then the fat boy , and then <NAME> , following closely upon each other ’ s heels , and running after each other with as much eagerness as if their future prospects in life depended on their expedition .
__label__1	But , in our youthful ecstasy , I don ’ t think that we really looked before us or behind us ; or had any aspiration beyond the ignorant present .
__label__1	He crossed by <NAME> ’ s and went down , at a long angle , almost to the water ’ s edge , through some of the crooked and descending streets which lie ( and lay more crookedly and closely then ) between the river and <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ It ’ s the fine arts that bring me out of bed , <NAME> , ’ returned the lady .
__label__0	I looked at the last rays crowning the peak , and the shadows mounting by degrees up its slopes .
__label__0	They came next to the country of the <NAME> to the east of <NAME> , where there was a great deficiency of water ; in this province the people were mostly herdsmen , under the hard yoke of the Mongolians .
__label__0	The passengers resumed their places in the cars .
__label__1	But some people will die .
__label__1	<NAME> is pleasantly situated on the margin of the <NAME> , and is backed by some bold heights , about which there are charming rides and drives .
__label__1	I was to stay in the house , and was to be married from the house .
__label__0	`` It 's past belief , '' said <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ My dear <NAME> , ’ returned <NAME> , ‘ a thousand thanks for your good opinion .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> had taken no notice of her .
__label__1	<NAME> , I have an inexpressible desire to find service with a young lady who is good , accomplished , beautiful .
__label__0	With a greediness that could not be concealed , <NAME> grasped them all .
__label__0	“ We must bide our time and hear , ” replied the count .
__label__1	Notwithstanding that its walls were blotched , as if missionary maps were bursting out of them to impart geographical knowledge ; notwithstanding that its weird furniture was forlornly faded and musty , and that the prevailing <NAME> odour of bilge water and an ebb tide on a weedy shore was very strong ; the place was better within , than it promised .
__label__0	About two o ’ clock they came to an immense barren plain , without a sign of vegetation .
__label__1	As there is no doubt they were .
__label__0	The news was received with very different feelings by <NAME> and <NAME> .
__label__1	Still , I must confess he is not without faults , love . ''
__label__1	Here <NAME> bowed grimly to <NAME> , while <NAME> and <NAME> glanced mutual distrust out of the corners of their eyes .
__label__1	He must go to it .
__label__1	The old woman eyed him slily , and hitching her chair nearer his , and looking in at the parrot , who came down from the gilded dome at her call , said : ‘ Out of place now , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Never you mind , <NAME> , ’ returned the <NAME> , shortly .
__label__0	The doctor leaned over and looked out .
__label__1	The young man inclines his head in acknowledgment of the precepts of experience .
__label__0	The weather was splendid , the temperature very warm in the day time , but in the evening the sea-breezes tempered the heat of the atmosphere and procured cool nights for the inhabitants of <NAME> .
__label__1	would n't you like to be a book-writer ? '
__label__0	Here , he knows that fellow-men are awaiting him !
__label__1	‘ “ You did ? ” said <NAME> , at last finding breath to speak .
__label__0	The maternal sentiment did not seem to Laing to be very fully developed amongst the people of <NAME> , for he was twice roundly abused by women for refusing to buy their children of them .
__label__1	There ’ s only one avenue to the <NAME> left often now , and I shall have to stop up that to-night with a pair of gloves .
__label__1	After looking at her , as if the sound of even a single <NAME> word were slow to express itself to him , he answered , in his former strong foreign accent .
__label__1	What was <NAME> ’ s affright and wonder when , at sight of her , with her tearful face , and outstretched arms , <NAME> recoiled and shrieked !
__label__1	“ <NAME> , ” she says , “ I love him. ” ’ ‘ “ Adore him , ” I said , uncle , ’ interposed Mrs. Kenwigs .
__label__0	But , after all , the situation was not changed for those among the nine ( now only remaining of the twenty-three ) who should not have drawn the lot of departure .
__label__0	In our opinion these societies resemble the clans of <NAME> or the <NAME> tribes of <NAME> .
__label__0	Five hundred feet from the ship stood a man raising his hands in despair ; he stood there , powerless , facing the fire which was destroying the <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ But bless your hearts and eyebrows , all this sort of thing was nothing to my uncle !
__label__0	But by this time the <NAME> was disappearing in the distant sky .
__label__1	Death of my life , sir , ’ returned the stranger , ‘ it ’ s my character to be impatient ! ’ The sound of <NAME> cautiously chaining the door before she opened it , caused them both to look that way .
__label__1	I have set these people by the ears , and made two new enemies , where , <NAME> knows , I needed none .
__label__1	‘ I am going , ma ’ am , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ to marry <NAME> ’ s daughter. ’ ‘ Yes , sir , ’ returned Mrs. Sparsit .
__label__0	Their arms are bows and arrows or muskets .
__label__1	‘ You will be glad to talk together. ’ As his uneasy figure went on before them among the evening shadows , the boy said to his sister , petulantly : ‘ When are you going to settle yourself in some <NAME> sort of place , <NAME> ?
__label__1	`` I only said I would n't go without one of the servants came up to <NAME> , '' returns <NAME> .
__label__1	As it met his , the nose came down over the moustache and the moustache went up under the nose .
__label__0	But the populace , seeing in that title an allusion damaging to <NAME> 's project , broke into the auditorium , smashed the benches , and compelled the unlucky director to alter his playbill .
__label__0	“ And as the price of that important cession , ” continued <NAME> , “ they have received a fair equivalent in <NAME> gold. ” “ Ah ! ” cried <NAME> , “ that accounts for that fellow Negrete and his people having such a lot of money. ” <NAME> was silent .
__label__0	This had a prodigious effect on <NAME> .
__label__1	`` And I want you , <NAME> , '' said I , shaking my head , `` to understand some one else . ''
__label__1	O , good citizens , if you would have so much compassion for us ! ” There was but a gaoler left , along with two of the four men who had taken him last night , and <NAME> .
__label__1	To whom I imparted how my uncle had come in the night and was then asleep , and how the breakfast preparations were to be modified accordingly .
__label__1	They were not a handsome family ; they were not well dressed ; their shoes were far from being water-proof ; their clothes were scanty ; and <NAME> might have known , and very likely did , the inside of a pawnbroker 's .
__label__0	`` It shall be done , captain , '' answered <NAME> .
__label__1	And if you please , <NAME> and <NAME> and me is to see each other once a month .
__label__0	Leaving Mas-a-Fuero , <NAME> changed his route , with the intention of seeking <NAME> , now known as <NAME> , which was placed by geographers in 27 degrees 30 minutes , a hundred leagues westward of the <NAME> coast .
__label__0	The sheik alone did not budge an inch .
__label__1	Upon my word and honour , I ’ m not in the habit of -- .
__label__1	‘ I ’ ll brood over miseries no longer , but put a good face on the matter , and try the fresh air and the bears again ; and if that don ’ t do , I ’ ll talk to the baroness soundly , and cut the <NAME> dead. ’ With this the baron fell into his chair , and laughed so loud and boisterously , that the room rang with it .
__label__1	For example : you couldn ’ t for your life be a gentleman ; I couldn ’ t for my life be otherwise .
__label__0	The postillion was thrashing his horses with all his might , and only kept them at a gallop by dint of abuse and blows .
__label__0	You will dispense , my Lord , with any account of my life for two years and a half .
__label__0	That he did not find it is not very wonderful , as during the last eight years many ships have passed over the spot assigned to it upon the maps .
__label__1	<NAME> had but fifteen `` <NAME> '' a-week himself ; he pocketed on Saturdays but fifteen copies of his <NAME> name ; and yet the <NAME> Present blessed his four-roomed house !
__label__1	The person on the sofa , who appeared to have a cold in his head , gave such a very loud snort that he startled me .
__label__1	Such d ’ licious broth and wine !
__label__0	`` Yet from such a death you would suffer no more than your friends the Selenites are exposed to every day of their lives , '' said the <NAME> , evidently determined on getting up an argument .
__label__1	‘ What can we do , Trotwood ? ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> ’ t I know that you were hanging about the house the other night , like a thief , eh ?
__label__1	Moreover it was her habit to shake her head at that wretched old boy whenever she caught his eye as he shivered and shook .
__label__0	In the face of this fact , so much had to be admitted .
__label__0	“ No , ” replied <NAME> , without apparently noticing the <NAME> of the quartermaster -- an EMPRESSMENT which , moreover , was reasonable enough under the circumstances .
__label__0	It lasted only part of the night of the 31st October , and the next day , when the sun rose , it might have been looked upon as a mere nightmare had not the melancholy sight of fields laid waste , and of the harbour with six ships lying on their sides , and all the others at anchor , almost entirely disabled , testified to the reality of the disaster .
__label__0	`` So , '' said <NAME> , `` there is a hemisphere , that invisible hemisphere which is very ill supplied , very ill treated , by nature . ''
__label__0	There was no doubt that the flock would prosper , and that at no distant time not only wool but hides would be abundant .
__label__0	at sight of the lash raised upon <NAME> , could you refrain ?
__label__1	‘ We ’ ll not say very crooked , ma ’ am , ’ said <NAME> piously .
__label__0	He arbitrarily rejected all that had been done before his time .
__label__0	From this day , the thoughts of the inhabitants of <NAME> were solely occupied with the intended search .
__label__0	A foggy veil , a sort of greyish mist still hung over the iceberg .
__label__1	The door is opened by the same weak-eyed young man , whose imbecility of grin at sight of Mr Toots is feebleness of character personified .
__label__0	Again , although the recruits from the <NAME> formed only a total of fourteen men , as against the twelve of the old crew , was it not to be feared that some of the latter would take <NAME> 's side ?
__label__1	And I am sorry to say I have known them cruel to their wives too . ''
__label__1	and yet it ’ s like being tickled -- there ’ s a pleasure in it too , sir ! ’ ‘ Drink that , ’ said the dwarf , who had by this time heated some more .
__label__1	For we were very happy then , I think. ’ ‘ Heaven knows we were ! ’ said I .
__label__0	It is known that a spongy , velvety flesh is procured from a certain mushroom of the genus polyporous .
__label__1	<NAME> and I know our duty to each other better , I pray Heaven ! ’ ‘ Oh ! ’ said <NAME> , nodding her head thoughtfully .
__label__1	Among the trees and not far from the residence he pointed out the spire of the little church of which he had spoken .
__label__0	This land is situated on the same parallel as <NAME> , in 41 degrees 40 minutes , but its climate is much colder .
__label__0	With two ships and one light vessel , <NAME> set out from <NAME> on the 21st December , 1605 .
__label__0	It was therefore necessary to fix piles in the bed of the river so as to sustain the floor of the bridge and establish a pile-driver to act on the tops of these piles , which would thus form two arches and allow the bridge to support heavy loads .
__label__0	But , wherever the chest might have come from , it was a treasure to the settlers on <NAME> .
__label__0	“ With this we could go round -- ” “ The world ? ” asked <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ You dropped down upon me. ’ ‘ I dropped down upon you , then , you ill-conditioned man , ’ ( <NAME> chuckled at having forced her to adopt his phrase , ) ‘ for having been needlessly significant to <NAME> that morning .
__label__1	‘ Good gracious , <NAME> , -- I should say Mr Clennam , far more proper -- the climb we have had to get up here and how ever to get down again without a fire-escape and Mr F. ’ s Aunt slipping through the steps and bruised all over and you in the machinery and foundry way too only think , and never told us ! ’ Thus , <NAME> , out of breath .
__label__1	<NAME> kept one hand on my lips , and raised the other in a listening attitude .
__label__1	But you are a young gentleman , <NAME> , and my adwice to you is , to cheer up , sir , to keep a good heart , and to know your own walue .
__label__0	The little band resumed its march towards the bay .
__label__0	`` Do n't you think , <NAME> , it has always been as it is now ? ''
__label__1	I have been wretched , too .
__label__1	But they reached their journey ’ s end at last ; and there , in a front room , looking over the wild sea , <NAME> showed him a nice little bed with white hangings , close to the window , on which there was already beautifully written on a card in round text -- down strokes very thick , and up strokes very fine -- <NAME> ; while two other little bedsteads in the same room were announced , through like means , as respectively appertaining unto Just as they got downstairs again into the hall , <NAME> saw the weak-eyed young man who had given that mortal offence to Mrs Pipchin , suddenly seize a very large drumstick , and fly at a gong that was hanging up , as if he had gone mad , or wanted vengeance .
__label__0	A few days later , a boat seeking anchorage upon the coast of the <NAME> , was in danger of attack .
__label__1	I did lose money before , certainly , but it doesn ’ t quite follow that he took it .
__label__0	Her head and neck , shoulders , ears , arms , hands , and toes were loaded down with jewels and gems with bracelets , earrings , and rings ; while a tunic bordered with gold , and covered with a light muslin robe , betrayed the outline of her form .
__label__0	As to <NAME> , he did not speak ; he simply gazed , and by the mistrust which his look expressed , it appeared that he was examining some strange country .
__label__1	<NAME> heard her father speak to Mr Carker sometimes on business matters , and heard him softly reply , but she paid little attention to what they said , and only wished the dinner at an end .
__label__0	That was his first winter , 1852-53 , for the next he spent in <NAME> , where the <NAME> now lay at anchor .
__label__1	He was seated on the ice , making spasmodic efforts to smile ; but anguish was depicted on every lineament of his countenance .
__label__0	`` But must it be propped up ?
__label__1	<NAME> remember what I said to you .
__label__1	'This is far enough , ' said a voice , which was evidently that of the gentleman .
__label__1	Our way lies through a beautiful country , richly cultivated , and luxuriant in its promise of an abundant harvest .
__label__0	To fly is , therefore , the course to be suggested by ordinary prudence .
__label__0	Here , as at <NAME> and <NAME> , were mixed crowds of all races , <NAME> and <NAME> , <NAME> and <NAME> , mostly merchants ready to buy or sell anything .
__label__0	Why , it 's like emptying money-bags into the sea not to fill one 's barrels when one can .
__label__1	‘ You may go. ’ The waiter complied , wondering much who the gentleman could be , and what he wanted ; the little old gentleman , waiting till he was out of sight , tapped at the door .
__label__1	“ To hear the names he 's giving me !
__label__1	I am as gay as a lark. ’ Which his face confirmed .
__label__0	In a few minutes the half-breed had swum several cables ' lengths towards the boat in an oblique direction .
__label__0	The Projectile still pursued its curving but otherwise unknown path over the <NAME> 's invisible face .
__label__0	I have already explained that I held Hans by the arm .
__label__0	Suddenly a cry made him tremble , a cry which penetrated to the depths of his soul , and these two words rushed into his ear : “ My son ! ” His mother , the old woman <NAME> , was before him !
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> must see all his victims face to face. ” <NAME> yielded to his wish .
__label__1	Then , I got up and partly dressed , and sat at the window to take a last look out , and in taking it fell asleep .
__label__1	<NAME> ways and yards , which here and there diverged from the main street , disclosed little knots of houses , where drunken men and women were positively wallowing in filth ; and from several of the door-ways , great ill-looking fellows were cautiously emerging , bound , to all appearance , on no very well-disposed or harmless errands .
__label__1	said <NAME> , caustically ; after an attentive perusal of <NAME> 's features .
__label__0	Was he wrong in declaring that it was a political discussion ? ''
__label__0	Who could have told that such a hurricane had been let loose on the surface of that ocean ?
__label__1	You was a spy -- witness at the <NAME> .
__label__1	He resumed where he had left off .
__label__1	As he looked , she became blended with the child he had loved , and he could hardly separate the two .
__label__0	There was nothing to prevent him , if he chose , from partaking gratuitously of the volcanic light and heat which were being enjoyed by all besides ; but rather than abandon his close and personal oversight of his precious cargo , he preferred to sacrifice his own slender stock of fuel .
__label__1	‘ I am not very likely to , ’ rejoined <NAME> .
__label__1	The figure stood quite still , and so did she ; not boldly , but of necessity ; for going back into the room was hardly less terrible than going on .
__label__0	During the whole day , I was haunted by uncomfortable suspicions , and at night I slept badly , and between my broken dreams I fancied I heard distant sighs like the notes of a funeral psalm .
__label__0	These men , without exception , were all sons of the count ’ s tenants , and so tenaciously , even out at sea , did they cling to their old traditions , that it mattered little to them what physical disorganization ensued , so long as they felt they were sharing the experiences of their lord and master .
__label__0	On being informed that the corvette was on a voyage of discovery , he inquired , `` Have you doubled <NAME> or did you come round the Cape of <NAME> ? ''
__label__0	I know where you are <NAME> , and I know where to find you .
__label__1	This was indeed the case ; but as it was not <NAME> 's habit to repose a blind and foolish confidence in anybody , it should be observed , in justice to that gentleman , that he had trusted <NAME> to this extent , in order that , if they were pursued , the money might be found on her : which would leave him an opportunity of asserting his innocence of any theft , and would greatly facilitate his chances of escape .
__label__1	‘ You are not going , papa ? ’ said <NAME> , anxiously .
__label__0	The most respectable men in <NAME> , with eyes blackened , noses bleeding , and collars torn , saw the inside of a prison that night for the first time in all their lives .
__label__0	Our looks expressed our feelings better than words .
__label__1	‘ Landless. ’ ‘ Tick that off , ’ said <NAME> , taking another trot , and then coming back .
__label__0	Besides , we will watch , and we are numerous enough to repulse a fleet of <NAME> and other wild animals. ” “ We only want fire-arms. ” “ I have my revolvers , ” said <NAME> .
__label__1	He was rather a shallow sort of young gentleman , I thought , with a handsome face , a rapid utterance , and a confident , bold air .
__label__1	Seeing that Mr <NAME> invested himself in his every-day garments , he hastened to do the like , putting on his shoes before his stockings , and thrusting his legs into his coat sleeves , and making such other small mistakes in his toilet as are not uncommon to those who dress in a hurry , and labour under the agitation of having been suddenly roused .
__label__1	<NAME> , evermore. ’ This , blotted with tears , was the letter .
__label__1	‘ Would it be such hopeless work ?
__label__1	‘ Oh , that ’ s the ‘ rig ’ nal , is it ? ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ You accidentally saw a young lady in this room one morning , my dear sir , in a fainting fit .
__label__1	`` My little woman , why do you look at me in that way ?
__label__0	The natives , called <NAME> , were so frightened at the sight of the vessels that they hastily took refuge in the interior of the country , carrying with them all their valuables , and it was impossible to overtake any of them .
__label__1	Let us say no more upon the subject ; it ’ s a very painful one to me .
__label__0	<NAME> to its slight specific gravity , the Projectile , after reaching unknown depths of ocean through the terrific momentum of its fall , had been at last arrested in its course and even obliged to return to the surface .
__label__0	The awakening is to take place here in my house .
__label__0	“ Shall I be able to find this head and heart ? ” thought the Czar .
__label__0	Thus the journey across <NAME> was accomplished , the given line of march being scrupulously adhered to throughout .
__label__0	About May they again arrived at the court of <NAME> , who gave them free passes , and they reached <NAME> about the middle of June , 1247 .
__label__1	‘ Mr Lightwood , ’ pursued her husband , ‘ as chance has brought us face to face at last -- which is not to be wondered at , for the wonder is , that , in spite of all my pains to the contrary , chance has not confronted us together sooner -- I have only to remind you that you have been at my house , and to add that I have not changed my residence. ’ ‘ Sir ’ returned <NAME> , with a meaning glance towards <NAME> , ‘ my position is a truly painful one .
__label__1	‘ Oh ! ’ sneered <NAME> , looking after him as she entered .
__label__1	Changed as he is , and inexpressibly blest and thankful as I always am to know it , the old sorrowful feeling of compassion comes upon me sometimes with such strength that I want to put my arms round his neck , tell him how I love him , and cry a little on his breast .
__label__0	“ His days , then , are shorter than ours ? ” interrupted the captain .
__label__1	I should think I did , or you would have begged in vain .
__label__0	They call their country <NAME> , and themselves the Irons .
__label__1	But the dead-and-gone Dedlocks take it very calmly and have never been known to object .
__label__1	Good-night ! ’ Still covering her face , she sobbed , and answered ‘ Good-night , dear <NAME> , ’ and silently ascended .
__label__1	But there are unexpressed confidences , Mr Clennam ; and as you have been together intimately among these people , I can not doubt that a confidence of that sort exists in the present case .
__label__1	‘ Let me , oh do let me .
__label__0	And the provinces to which the river has given its name have acknowledged right to call themselves the healthiest of a country which is one of the finest on the earth .
__label__0	<NAME> soon satisfied their curiosity .
__label__0	On the sidewalks , tables had been laid , often miles and miles long , at the public expense ; these were to be covered with every kind of eatables , exquisitely cooked , in the greatest profusion , and free to everyone for twelve hours before the arrival of the illustrious guests and also for twelve hours after their departure .
__label__0	Something which occurred on the night of the 12th of December was of a nature to support the opinions of all partisans of the supernatural , and there were many at <NAME> .
__label__1	She flies in a passion , and breaks his pipe ; he steps out , and gets another .
__label__1	Who _could _have told you that , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Ah , to be sure , ’ said <NAME> , with a cunning look , ‘ that ’ s the pint .
__label__0	It gives a uniform and unintermittent light , which the sun does not .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> and <NAME> , ’ cried the gentleman in black , calling on the case , which stood first on the list .
__label__1	‘ I think we may adjourn , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	That was true , speaking exactly .
__label__1	please ! ’ cried <NAME> , with a kiss , ‘ don ’ t be a naughty <NAME> !
__label__0	They looked over the wood , but saw no signs of them , and <NAME> returned to the banks of the river , where magnificent mimosas were growing .
__label__1	<NAME> , I had brought in all our hammers , one after another , but without avail .
__label__0	This was also indicated by the second case of metal which had preserved them from damp , and which could not have been soldered in a moment of haste .
__label__1	There was poison in the house .
__label__1	It was constantly before him all at once .
__label__1	<NAME> came home , and I soon had no doubt at all . ''
__label__0	Then I felt all solid support give way not to my feet , but to the raft itself .
__label__1	Both the private father and the Father of the <NAME> were strong within him then .
__label__1	He don ’ t care for an old ‘ ooman like me , I dare say. ’ ‘ I assure you , ma ’ am , ’ said <NAME> , grasping the old lady ’ s hand , and speaking so loud that the exertion imparted a crimson hue to his benevolent countenance -- ‘ I assure you , ma ’ am , that nothing delights me more than to see a lady of your time of life heading so fine a family , and looking so young and well. ’ ‘ Ah ! ’ said the old lady , after a short pause : ‘ it ’ s all very fine , I dare say ; but I can ’ t hear him. ’ ‘ Grandma ’ s rather put out now , ’ said <NAME> , in a low tone ; ‘ but she ’ ll talk to you presently. ’ <NAME> nodded his readiness to humour the infirmities of age , and entered into a general conversation with the other members of the circle .
__label__0	She had six feet of water in her hold , and was gradually sinking .
__label__1	While the attorney was thus engaged , the dwarf was groping under the table , muttering desperate imprecations on himself , and mankind in general , and all inanimate objects to boot , which suggested to Mr Brass the question , ‘ what ’ s the matter ? ’ ‘ The key , ’ said the dwarf , looking viciously about him , ‘ the door-key -- that ’ s the matter .
__label__1	I fully expected to find a Constable in the kitchen , waiting to take me up .
__label__1	Showing , among a Variety of pleasant Matters , how majestic and impartial <NAME> was ; and how <NAME> returned <NAME> ’ s <NAME> as heavily as it came- -With another Matter , which will be found in its Place 26 .
__label__0	It followed day by day the discussion of the committee .
__label__0	When they perceived us , they hurried up eagerly to congratulate us on our success .
__label__1	A little owl could stare .
__label__1	The fellow , by his agent , or secretary , or somebody , writes to me 'Sir <NAME> , <NAME> , presents his compliments to <NAME> , and has to call his attention to the fact that the green pathway by the old parsonage-house , now the property of <NAME> , is <NAME> 's right of way , being in fact a portion of the park of <NAME> , and that <NAME> finds it convenient to close up the same . '
__label__1	‘ Why , if they weren ’ t a going to meet somewhere , I suppose they might as well have stayed at home , mightn ’ t they , <NAME> ? ’ returned the unwilling Grinder .
__label__1	With me to manage the property , and my wife to manage the people -- Whew ! ’ Again shaking her head , she returned : ‘ They will never quarrel with the girl .
__label__1	There had been a quantity of printing , and promising , and proxying , and polling , and it appeared to have imparted great liveliness to all concerned , except the pensioners -- who were not elected yet .
__label__0	The merit of them , however , if we are to believe <NAME> ' Literary anecdotes , rests rather with <NAME> , than , as the title would appear to indicate , with the chaplain of the expedition , <NAME> .
__label__1	He ran violently down the stairs , out into the street , and so past the window , without any hat , towards the quarter whence the sound proceeded -- bent , no doubt , upon securing the strangers ’ services directly .
__label__0	It is vexatious that all the apparatus of the mine , deserted for ten years , must be set up anew .
__label__1	To hope to do what I seek to do , I must be what I have been so long .
__label__1	Be good enough to pinch him , sir -- in the leg , if you please ; nothing else wakes him -- thank you .
__label__0	The snow melted away in some places , according to the shape of the ground , while in others it lay in large patches .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , after thoughtfully pausing in her work .
__label__1	As <NAME> looked fixedly at this phenomenon , it was a knocker again .
__label__0	“ What is the matter ? ” asked the girl .
__label__0	But what was this _Porpoise_ which had evidently been shipwrecked , and what was he doing in these waters ? ''
__label__1	No , he scorned the base insinuation .
__label__1	Make your own arrangements. ’ ‘ Why , I was thinking that this evening would be a good time , <NAME> , when they are all sitting round the fire .
__label__0	After one or two preliminary hems , I determined to inquire .
__label__0	<NAME> did not hesitate to affirm that some animal of the feline species had passed there , which justified the engineer ’ s opinion that dangerous beasts existed in <NAME> .
__label__1	She was particularly proud of her turn for business ; and she showed it now in reducing everything to pen and ink , and being moved by nothing .
__label__1	‘ How many children are there , and what has my brother Ned given , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ There are six children , ’ replied the gentleman , ‘ and your brother has given us twenty pounds. ’ ‘ My brother <NAME> is a good fellow , and you ’ re a good fellow too , <NAME> , ’ said the old man , shaking him by both hands with trembling eagerness .
__label__0	Consequently , the level of the lake would be greatly lowered , and the opening where the water escaped would be exposed , which was their final aim .
__label__1	To Lizzie it was so new , so pretty , at once so womanly and so childish , that it won her completely .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> might have meant that he had concentrated a whole existence of happiness into the short space of eight weeks ; but the sigh -- there was a vast deal of meaning in the sigh .
__label__1	What the deuce is it all about ?
__label__0	“ There she was , at a thousand leagues from the ocean which she was trying to reach !
__label__0	<NAME> was informed of the plan , of which he approved highly ; he told his companions ; some rejoiced , others heard of it with indifference .
__label__1	Can they not be induced to go faster ? ” asks <NAME> , clinging to the old man .
__label__0	I am in truth <NAME> !
__label__0	His plan was bold , but it might succeed , thanks to the darkness of the night .
__label__1	‘ How do you carry them about ? ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	‘ If I were to choose a spot from which the rising or setting sun could be seen to the greatest possible advantage , it would be from this neighborhood. ’ Now watch , <NAME> !
__label__1	‘ Hold your tongue , sir , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Twenty pound ten better , ’ repeated <NAME> , ‘ than you did that day when I first introduced myself .
__label__0	They therefore refused to go beyond that point , and formally demanded that the ship should be steered northward so as to clear the icebergs at the most favourable period of the season .
__label__0	But a kind of lurid brilliancy spread over the island , against which stood out confusedly the wooded masses of the heights .
__label__1	He is a great philosopher , and seldom moved , unless by the dogs before mentioned .
__label__0	“ We have no time to lose .
__label__1	`` I come from arriving at this so detestable house with your wife .
__label__0	Liberal as nature has been in the adornment of these parts , the industry of the <NAME> seems not a little to have contributed to their beauty ; for nothing indeed can equal the extraordinary degree of cultivation everywhere apparent .
__label__1	Mrs Miff is not a student of political economy ( she thinks the science is connected with dissenters ; ‘ Baptists or <NAME> , or some o ’ them , ’ she says ) , but she can never understand what business your common folks have to be married .
__label__0	“ Do you think that you can hold one hundred and fifty pounds of ballast in your arms ? ” “ Ay , more than that ! ” “ No !
__label__0	At this place the beach was covered with little mounds , concealing perfectly spherical turtles ' eggs , with white hard shells , the albumen of which does not coagulate as that of birds ' eggs .
__label__1	What does he mean , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Live there , <NAME> , ’ faltered <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , aunt ! ’ I seriously believe it had never once entered my head for a single moment , to consider whether she was or not .
__label__1	‘ Will you go and see if <NAME> is on the lock ? ’ She was at his side , and touching him , but he still perversely supposed her to be in her seat , and called out , still leaning over the table , ‘ Amy , <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> threw into it about eighteen grains of quinine , and they succeeded in making <NAME> drink the mixture .
__label__0	The objects lying around had no weight .
__label__0	`` Has he got on the track of some animal ? ''
__label__0	The ship labored on the lumpy sea , and rolled heavily in the trough of the waves .
__label__1	`` <NAME> , '' he said , `` it may be so ; and I freely admit that the young lady who has taken <NAME> 's name upon herself in so ill-advised a manner -- you will I am sure not quarrel with me for throwing out that remark again , as a duty I owe to <NAME> 's connexions -- is a highly genteel young lady .
__label__0	“ I think I should ! ” replied the young man .
__label__0	In dwelling on <NAME> 's voyages , we have , for the time , turned aside from those made at the same time by <NAME> , whose extraordinary exploration of <NAME> 's <NAME> had brought upon him the censure of the <NAME> , and who was anxious to regain his reputation for skill and courage .
__label__1	She is considered so ( I have heard ) among the clerks in the <NAME> , and it is a point more in their way than in mine .
__label__1	She clung round my neck , calling me by every dear name she could think of and saying what should she do without me !
__label__1	The unaccustomed visitor from outside , naturally assumed everybody here to be prisoners -- landlord , waiter , barmaid , potboy , and all .
__label__1	'Is this the <NAME> ? '
__label__1	So make her comfortable. ’ ‘ Thank you very much , sir , ’ that discreet lady observed , ‘ but pray do not let My comfort be a consideration .
__label__0	`` Unaccountable indeed , '' answered the engineer , who did not appear desirous to prolong the conversation .
__label__1	The house in <NAME> Inn had bills in the windows announcing that it was to let , and it looked dirtier and gloomier and ghastlier than ever .
__label__1	Her thinness seemed to be the effect of some wasting fire within her , which found a vent in her gaunt eyes .
__label__1	‘ In that corner of the churchyard , ’ said the old gentleman , after a silence of a few moments , ‘ in that corner of the churchyard of which I have before spoken , there lies buried a man who was in my employment for three years after this event , and who was truly contrite , penitent , and humbled , if ever man was .
__label__0	What natural force could possibly have produced such abnormal and extraordinary plants ?
__label__1	Mr <NAME> replied to it accordingly .
__label__1	`` <NAME> , will you forgive me ?
__label__1	There were dull pigs too , turning up the ground in search of dainty food , and grunting their monotonous grumblings as they prowled about , or crossed each other in their quest ; plump pigeons skimming round the roof or strutting on the eaves ; and ducks and geese , far more graceful in their own conceit , waddling awkwardly about the edges of the pond or sailing glibly on its surface .
__label__1	`` Yes , my dear , '' said <NAME> .
__label__1	And indeed , I think we are all engaged , except the baby. ” “ Then you are ? ” said I .
__label__1	It was in these apartments that Mr <NAME> made use of the expressions above recorded for the consolation and encouragement of his desponding friend ; and it may not be uninteresting or improper to remark that even these brief observations partook in a double sense of the figurative and poetical character of Mr <NAME> ’ s mind , as the rosy wine was in fact represented by one glass of cold gin-and-water , which was replenished as occasion required from a bottle and jug upon the table , and was passed from one to another , in a scarcity of tumblers which , as Mr <NAME> ’ s was a bachelor ’ s establishment , may be acknowledged without a blush .
__label__1	However loud the general voice might be in giving me encouragement , and however fervent the emotions and endeavours to which it roused me , I heard her lightest word of praise as I heard nothing else .
__label__0	“ No , I am not mistaken , ” he added ; “ it is a light on the horizon. ” “ A light ! ” exclaimed <NAME> ; “ show me where. ” “ Look there ! ” answered the lieutenant , and he kept pointing steadily in its direction , until <NAME> also distinctly saw the bright speck in the distance .
__label__1	The honour is reciprocal , sir , as I usually say when I dramatise a book .
__label__0	Thus , the doctor had become well known to the public , although he could not claim membership in either of the <NAME> Societies of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , or <NAME> , or yet with the <NAME> ’ Club , or even the <NAME> , where his friend the statistician <NAME> ruled in state .
__label__1	I see in your face that you know I can do nothing else than this .
__label__1	And what do you intend to make of him , ma'am ?
__label__0	They did not meet again until both reached Noukha-Hiva .
__label__0	<NAME> congratulations were already being exchanged on the happy termination of the dangerous struggle , and on the fortunate escape from any serious accident during so hazardous a trip .
__label__0	The valleys of our harbour were filled with trees , and tallied in every particular with the description given by the <NAME> .
__label__1	And not the least amazing circumstance connected with her being vaguely the town talk is that people hovering on the confines of <NAME> 's high connexion , people who know nothing and ever did know nothing about her , think it essential to their reputation to pretend that she is their topic too , and to retail her at second-hand with the last new word and the last new manner , and the last new drawl , and the last new polite indifference , and all the rest of it , all at second-hand but considered equal to new in inferior systems and to fainter stars .
__label__1	I ask , for information. ’ ‘ My dear <NAME> , I wish I ever had ! ’ ‘ Then you have not ?
__label__0	`` No , not quite , <NAME> , but , during her voyage , the schooner , it seems , did clear the polar circle , and pass the ice-wall .
__label__0	The important notice had been generally understood .
__label__0	The boat flew over the waves .
__label__1	The room door of the one-pair back , bore inscribed in legible characters the imposing words , ‘ Mr .
__label__0	Finding it impossible to see a particle of the <NAME> surface , he gave it up for good , and tried to console himself by gazing at the stars , which now fairly blazed in the spangled heavens .
__label__1	I won ’ t eat more than I can help , and I know you love your old master too much to eat more than YOU can help , don ’ t you , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Don ’ t I what ? ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	And so we live on <NAME> , in the charm -- ingest of dolls ’ houses , de -- lightfully furnished , and we have a clever little servant who is de -- cidedly pretty , and we are economical and orderly , and do everything by clockwork , and we have a hundred and fifty pounds a year , and we have all we want , and more .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , ’ said Mr Boffin , blowing out the light in the lantern , shutting it up , and stowing it away in the breast of his coat as before .
__label__0	`` How have we forgotten them ? ''
__label__1	`` Of course you may , cousin <NAME> . ''
__label__1	This was <NAME> ’ s party .
__label__1	<NAME> ’ t I seen you before ? ’ ‘ Once before -- if you had your eyesight , ’ replied <NAME> ; the conditional clause in an under-tone .
__label__0	At that moment the doctor and <NAME> came up to <NAME> .
__label__0	[ Illustration : `` Travelling at a slow pace . '' ]
__label__1	You may keep the books , if you 're fond of reading .
__label__1	As they come through the dismal passages , some officers of the jail who are in waiting there , congratulate him , in their rough way , on his release .
__label__1	But I want some reading -- some fine bold reading , some splendid book in a gorging Lord-Mayor ’ s-Show of wollumes ’ ( probably meaning gorgeous , but misled by association of ideas ) ; ‘ as ’ ll reach right down your pint of view , and take time to go by you .
__label__1	‘ Do you mean mine ? ’ asked <NAME> .
__label__0	“ <NAME> could not have depicted yon mountains in a more appalling aspect. ” “ Faith ! ” said <NAME> , “ I wouldn ’ t like to be strolling alone in the evening through this country of ghosts .
__label__0	Hans seemed to accept the difficulties of the journey so tranquilly , with such calm indifference , with such perfect recklessness of all danger , that I actually blushed to appear less of a man than he !
__label__0	Speechless with amazement , they stood still for some moments .
__label__1	<NAME> paid the first week in advance. ’ ‘ Then you had better get them out at the end of it , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	A negative shake of the head from the young man was the only reply .
__label__1	It hears , my dear child , all sorts of shocking things .
__label__0	It is scarcely two o ’ clock. ” “ Two in the morning , or two in the afternoon ? ” asked <NAME> , again regarding the sun .
__label__1	Now , hear me , my dears !
__label__1	He was down in every fit of the hooping-cough , and rolled upon and crushed by a whole field of small diseases , that came trooping on each other ’ s heels to prevent his getting up again .
__label__1	The flag with the inscription <NAME> ’ S HORSE-RIDING was there ; and the <NAME> niche was there ; but <NAME> was not there .
__label__0	The somber region she had loved as a child , and in which her wedded life would be spent , was as dear to her as ever .
__label__0	The air grew colder , and , July 19th , fell as low as 26° ; the next day was warmer , but this harbinger of the arctic winter warned <NAME> not to linger longer .
__label__1	I ’ ve been here before. ’ ‘ Did you Leave anything when you were here before ? ’ asked <NAME> , with a view to principal and interest .
__label__0	No fresh incident occurred in the life on board , which proceeded with almost methodical regularity .
__label__0	A diabolical noise of cymbals , trumpets , and drums , all played together , announced the approach of the white men , and <NAME> , the king , gave them a most hearty welcome , ordering <NAME> to behead every one who should molest them .
__label__1	The system here , is rigid , strict , and hopeless solitary confinement .
__label__1	What do you say ? ’ ‘ To the system ? ’ inquired Traddles , looking grave .
__label__1	' I do not think you ever will .
__label__1	‘ Have you no feeling , that you keep her out in the cruel streets at such a time as this ?
__label__0	Fragments of mountains fell into the <NAME> , and , in a few minutes , the ocean rolled over the spot where <NAME> once stood .
__label__1	I have perfect confidence in my partner , and I am satisfied that he will do what is best .
__label__0	It was six o'clock in the morning when the settlers , after a hasty breakfast , set out to reach by the shortest way the western coast of the island .
__label__1	The curtain shook next moment , and a lady , raising it with a heavily ringed hand , dropped it behind her again as she entered .
__label__1	Upon my soul you mustn ’ t come into the place saying you want to know , you know , ’ remonstrated <NAME> junior , turning about and putting up the eye-glass .
__label__1	‘ I have a crotchet in my head that it must be so .
__label__0	“ That is rather a warm trade , I think. ” “ Very warm , ” answered the engineer .
__label__0	What enjoyment it would be to feel oneself thus suspended in ether , more favored than the birds who must use their wings to keep themselves up ! ''
__label__1	`` Unless my cousin <NAME> is blind , my pet , '' said I , `` I should think my cousin <NAME> knows pretty well as much as we know . ''
__label__1	‘ And yet I have some respect here .
__label__1	If you can not confidently trust me , whom will you trust ? ’ ‘ Ah , <NAME> ! ’ I returned .
__label__1	Why has Mr Headstone gone from us in that way ? ’ ‘ He asked me -- you know he asked me -- to be his wife , Charley. ’ ‘ Well ? ’ said the boy , impatiently .
__label__1	‘ It ain ’ t a very nasty one , ’ returned <NAME> , rather embarrassed by the question .
__label__1	I am going to take out the licence .
__label__0	This would agree with the date assigned by the document to the shipwreck -- the 27th of June , 1862. ” “ Clearly , ” said <NAME> .
__label__0	A thousand years and more will pass before the last bit of coal is taken out of our new mine ! ” “ Heaven grant it ! ” returned <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Was it real , now , or only to display the eyelashes ? ’ Kate , looking anxiously towards the door , made no reply .
__label__0	“ No , I tell you ! ” “ I must examine -- ” “ You shall not examine. ” “ You may perhaps have broken -- ” continued <NAME> .
__label__1	`` The lawyers have twisted it into such a state of bedevilment that the original merits of the case have long disappeared from the face of the earth .
__label__1	She could keep her own part of it from him ; he should never know of her loss ; in time to come he should know all that was of import to himself ; but he should never know what concerned her only .
__label__1	Though the whole nursery party were dressed by this time in lighter mourning than at first , there was enough in the appearance of the bereaved children to make the day no brighter .
__label__0	“ Good-morning , old <NAME> ; we have come to do our little bit of friendly business with you , you know , ” was <NAME> ’ s greeting .
__label__0	On the 18th of February , about three o'clock in the morning , we were at the entrance of the Straits of <NAME> .
__label__0	In three or four days more the minister would have come to a decision regarding the convict , and it was only too certain that justice would take its course .
__label__1	It was twelve o'clock before we could obtain possession of the room , and the clearance it required then was so discouraging that <NAME> , who was almost tired out , sat down in the middle of the dust and cried .
__label__1	As <NAME> knew enough of the place to know that he was required to remain in the Lodge a certain time , he took a seat in a corner , and feigned to be occupied with the perusal of letters from his pocket .
__label__0	The nuts which held the bolts to the outer plates of the right-hand scuttle gave way under the pressure of the <NAME> wrench .
__label__1	It is in the hands of my solicitor .
__label__0	Besides , the one killed by <NAME> , and whose body was found outside the enclosure , of course belonged to <NAME> 's crew .
__label__1	The gentleman who was against him had to speak first , and being in dreadfully good spirits ( for he had , in the last trial , very nearly procured the acquittal of a young gentleman who had had the misfortune to murder his father ) he spoke up , you may be sure ; telling the jury that if they acquitted this prisoner they must expect to suffer no less pangs and agonies than he had told the other jury they would certainly undergo if they convicted that prisoner .
__label__1	‘ Does the sister suffer under any stigma because of the impossible accusation -- groundless would be a better word -- that was made against the father , and substantially withdrawn ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , sir , ’ returned <NAME> , with a kind of anger .
__label__0	A loud call from <NAME> brought us to a little strip of beach on the right of our stranded boat .
__label__0	You hear my words , <NAME> , and I beg you to repeat such to them. ” “ I thank your Highness in the name of the town , ” answered the merchant chief .
__label__0	Too many eyes were watching on board -- especially those of <NAME> , whose gaze never quitted the horizon of that southern zone for an instant .
__label__1	<NAME> wonder than these , when a bottle-nosed person in a glazed hat had after some considerable hesitation ordered another glass of gin and water of the attendant potboy , and when <NAME> , instead of sending it , appeared in person , saying , ‘ Captain Joey , you have had as much as will do you good , ’ not only did the captain feebly rub his knees and contemplate the fire without offering a word of protest , but the rest of the company murmured , ‘ Ay , ay , <NAME> !
__label__1	I beg your pardon , <NAME> .
__label__1	`` Jo , can you say what I say ? ''
__label__1	No news came of old <NAME> .
__label__1	But happening to look up at Mrs. Pocket as she sat reading her book of dignities after prescribing <NAME> as a sovereign remedy for baby , I thought -- Well -- No , I would n't .
__label__1	He was rather taken aback by the sudden firmness with which <NAME> looked up and answered him .
__label__1	All that day , though he waited for Mr Abel until evening , <NAME> kept clear of his mother ’ s house , determined not to anticipate the pleasures of the morrow , but to let them come in their full rush of delight ; for to-morrow was the great and long looked-for epoch in his life -- to-morrow was the end of his first quarter -- the day of receiving , for the first time , one fourth part of his annual income of <NAME> in one vast sum of <NAME> -- to-morrow was to be a half-holiday devoted to a whirl of entertainments , and little <NAME> was to know what oysters meant , and to see a play .
__label__1	‘ What , haven ’ t you seen her lately ? ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	And although I have been resident abroad , for some years ( it would give me great pleasure to receive my friend <NAME> , and everybody here , at Baden-Baden , and to have an opportunity of making ‘ em known to the <NAME> ) , still I know enough , I flatter myself , of my lovely and accomplished relative , to know that she possesses every requisite to make a man happy , and that her marriage with my friend <NAME> is one of inclination and affection on both sides. ’ Many smiles and nods from Mr Carker .
__label__1	He always knew where the plump sister was .
__label__0	He gave the name of <NAME> to this territory , and to fitly conclude the ceremony , he caused three salutes to be fired .
__label__1	“ The dear little thing , ” returned <NAME> , “ holds dutifully to her father as long as he lasts ; but he wo n't last long .
__label__0	It is difficult for the traveller , who turns in despair from the inhospitable islands of this forsaken coast , where dangers of every sort assail him , and no provisions are to be had , to reflect that this barren country adjoins groups of <NAME> islands upon which nature has lavished her treasures and delights with a liberal hand .
__label__1	<NAME> and ruin came on me -- came on me. ’ Raising her eyes swiftly from their moody gaze upon the fire , to <NAME> ’ s face , she said : ‘ I am wasting time , and there is none to spare ; yet if I hadn ’ t thought of all , I shouldn ’ t be here now .
__label__1	Does he see a ghost , or hear an organ ?
__label__1	That done , she came softly back and stood by the side of my chair .
__label__1	I hope you didn ’ t take cold .
__label__1	When you come in , sir , I was just putting it to my fellow-partner , ’ towards whom he turned , ‘ to say to <NAME> upon his word and honour , whether he ’ d ever been of this opinion long ago , or not .
__label__1	‘ Disappointed ? ’ he went on , as he walked between them under the trees .
__label__0	A quarter of an hour later each one had taken his place on board of the launch , which sailed out of <NAME> under mainsail and jib .
__label__1	Yet every one had had enough , and the youngest Cratchits in particular , were steeped in sage and onion to the eyebrows !
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> replied with solemnity , ‘ No , dearest <NAME> , I am but too well aware that I am merely human. ’ Mrs <NAME> , for her part , still further improved the occasion by sitting with her eyes fastened on her husband , like two great black notes of interrogation , severely inquiring , Are you looking into your breast ?
__label__0	What had fate in store for these daring adventurers ?
__label__1	`` I could n't make him hear , and I softly opened the door and looked in .
__label__1	In time , <NAME> was despatched for a coach , the visitors keeping shop meanwhile ; and when he brought it , they got into it , leaving word for <NAME> that they would be sure to call again , on their way back .
__label__0	<NAME> began to fall an hour after they started , a fine snow , however , which happily could not obstruct the train ; nothing could be seen from the windows but a vast , white sheet , against which the smoke of the locomotive had a greyish aspect .
__label__0	These several productions of the sea were immediately lowered through the panel to the steward 's room , some to be eaten fresh , and others pickled .
__label__1	“ What are you going to do to me ? ” “ I 'm a going , ” said he , bringing his fist down upon the table with a heavy blow , and rising as the blow fell to give it greater force , -- “ I 'm a going to have your life ! ” He leaned forward staring at me , slowly unclenched his hand and drew it across his mouth as if his mouth watered for me , and sat down again .
__label__0	A boat would be seen where a man may glide between wind and water . ''
__label__0	His quiver was dangling at his side , his bow was bent , and an arrow which was pointed at our breasts already trembled on the string , when we were within a few yards of his person .
__label__1	‘ You mean Mrs. Nickleby ? ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> was pointing them out to his companions , and muttering in disjointed phrases , -- `` There , look there !
__label__0	“ We ’ re right among the breakers ! ” said <NAME> .
__label__0	It was certain that the bridge had been crossed , that the shore had been invaded by animals , and that whatever they might be they could by ascending the left bank of the <NAME> reach Prospect Heights .
__label__1	<NAME> said it to me , but I had not spoken .
__label__0	who had killed the convicts ?
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> , seeing the clump of bamboos , cut a quantity , which he mingled with the other fuel .
__label__0	The onagas , who had two pretty colts , were most often mounted by <NAME> and <NAME> , who had become an excellent rider under the reporter 's instruction , and they also harnessed them to the cart either for carrying wood and coal to <NAME> , or different mineral productions required by the engineer .
__label__0	`` We accept , '' replied Messrs. Stuart , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , after consulting each other .
__label__1	The staring of Mrs. Markleham during the whole narration , and the shrill , sharp interjections with which she occasionally interrupted it , defy description .
__label__1	When I came back , she was dying ; and all the blood in my heart has dried up , for they starved her to death .
__label__1	‘ The best thing to be done , sir , will be for <NAME> to give you a hoist up into the tree , and perhaps <NAME> will have the goodness to see that nobody comes up the lane , while I watch at the other end of the garden .
__label__1	‘ I was so surprised at first , ’ said I , giving him welcome with all the cordiality I felt , ‘ that I had hardly breath to greet you with , Steerforth. ’ ‘ Well , the sight of me is good for sore eyes , as the <NAME> say , ’ replied <NAME> , ‘ and so is the sight of you , <NAME> , in full bloom .
__label__1	Over all the legal neighbourhood there hangs , like some great veil of rust or gigantic cobweb , the idleness and pensiveness of the long vacation .
__label__0	He recognized afterwards that the <NAME> only formed an <NAME> , but , nevertheless , his belief that a polar continent farther south exists , remained firm and unchanged . ''
__label__1	We had a pair of very strong horses , but travelled at the rate of little more than a couple of miles an hour , through one unbroken slough of black mud and water .
__label__0	“ <NAME> ! ” he exclaimed , “ the lunatic !
__label__1	On a table by the window in <NAME> , we set out the work <NAME> procured for him -- which was to make , I forget how many copies of a legal document about some right of way -- and on another table we spread the last unfinished original of the great Memorial .
__label__0	His glance seemed to rest fondly for the last time on these masterpieces of art and of nature , to which he had limited his horizon during a sojourn of so many years in the abysses of the seas .
__label__0	“ We are going to have a storm , ” said <NAME> .
__label__1	I ’ m a poor scholar , but I shall write to you , odd times , when you ’ re away , and send my letters to <NAME> ’ r <NAME> .
__label__1	But she couldn ’ t control herself to go any further .
__label__1	The audience were much edified by this passage of words ; and Mr Podsnap , feeling that he was in rather remarkable force to-day , became smiling and conversational .
__label__1	But there have been times since , in my manhood , many times there have been , when I have thought , Is it possible , among the possibilities of hidden things , that in the sudden rashness of the child and her wild look so far off , there was any merciful attraction of her into danger , any tempting her towards him permitted on the part of her dead father , that her life might have a chance of ending that day ?
__label__1	I had not at that time seen the ideal presentment of this chamber which has since gratified me so much , but I observed that one of our friends who had made the arrangements for our voyage , turned pale on entering , retreated on the friend behind him , smote his forehead involuntarily , and said below his breath , ‘ Impossible !
__label__1	I made it in a moment .
__label__1	<NAME> had already got abroad that the little girl who used to show the wax-work , was the child of great people who had been stolen from her parents in infancy , and had only just been traced .
__label__1	says <NAME> with a low whistle as he sees both grandfather and granddaughter looking hard at him .
__label__0	The last words in his note-book were these : “ A <NAME> rifleman has just taken aim at me , but -- ” The <NAME> notwithstanding missed <NAME> , who , with his usual fortune , came out of this affair without a scratch .
__label__0	They were offered by packages , at first of five , then of ten , until at last nobody would take less than twenty , fifty , a hundred !
__label__0	The first layer was entirely composed of trunks laid side by side .
__label__0	An hour later , I met the innkeeper on the port , and told him what had occurred .
__label__1	It was remarkable ( but perhaps the wretched life he had led accounted for it ) that he was the least anxious of any of us .
__label__1	The boat came close to the bank again , and before she had had any more time for consideration , she and her grandfather were on board , and gliding smoothly down the canal .
__label__0	[ Illustration : `` Three hours later they reached the coast .
__label__0	If the vanguard of Feofar-Khan ’ s troops appeared , it would then be time to strike across the country .
__label__0	No one interrupted the <NAME> , but all things come to an end , and at last he was silent , but not till he had made his guests enter his dwelling , and be presented to <NAME> .
__label__1	the racking thoughts that crowd upon the mind , and make the heart beat violently , and the breath come thick , by the force of the images they conjure up before it ; the desperate anxiety _to be doing something_ to relieve the pain , or lessen the danger , which we have no power to alleviate ; the sinking of soul and spirit , which the sad remembrance of our helplessness produces ; what tortures can equal these ; what reflections or endeavours can , in the full tide and fever of the time , allay them !
__label__1	By slow degrees , however , he was reconciled to him in the end ; and even went so far as to honour him with his patronage , as one who had in some measure reformed , and was therefore to be forgiven .
__label__1	`` My roses , '' he said when he came back , `` take care of mama .
__label__0	He did so , too , with all his might , and soon had collected more than a thousand pieces of quartz , which contained gold enclosed as though in an extremely hard crystal casket .
__label__1	In a word , ' said the young lady , turning away , as her temporary firmness forsook her , 'there is a stain upon my name , which the world visits on innocent heads .
__label__1	I suppose I shall hear a knock here .
__label__0	`` But none dearer to an <NAME> ear , '' answered <NAME> , with much pride .
__label__1	It had been lying there some days , for rain and dew had stained it , and the mark of its shape was on the grass where it had fallen .
__label__1	<NAME> concluded , Mr <NAME> ’ s horse was ordered out again , and Mr Carker mounting his own , they rode off for the <NAME> together .
__label__1	We went down on the next day but one , and we found her in the room where I had first beheld her , and it is needless to add that there was no change in <NAME> .
__label__1	Such a confusion of tongues , before the circumstances were related , and the proofs disclosed !
__label__0	And so it seemed to <NAME> .
__label__0	An <NAME> can scarcely remain unmoved at the sight of sixty thousand dollars .
__label__0	A better translation is _A Journey into the <NAME> of the <NAME> translated by <NAME> .
__label__0	This was in fact what most of the navigators of the nineteenth century had to do , the progress of science enabling them to complete what had been begun by others .
__label__1	In this state , the waiter ’ s dismal intelligence about the ships immediately connected itself , without any effort of my volition , with my uneasiness about <NAME> .
__label__1	Ve-ry strong influence , is it not ?
__label__1	‘ It ’ s a bad light to distinguish objects in , ’ murmured Mrs. Nickleby , peering into the garden , ‘ and my eyes are not very good -- I was short-sighted from a child -- but , upon my word , I think there ’ s another large vegetable marrow sticking , at this moment , on the broken glass bottles at the top of the wall ! ’ <NAME> certain Particulars arising out of a Visit of <NAME> , which may prove important hereafter .
__label__1	‘ About how long might it take you now , at a average rate of going , to be a Judge ? ’ asked Mr Boffin , after surveying his small stature in silence .
__label__0	asked <NAME> quickly , as he looked up and saw the Frenchman pointing to something outside the Projectile .
__label__1	‘ If oaths , or prayers , or words , could rid me of you , they should .
__label__1	But , although this happy change had a visible effect on the little circle ; and although cheerful voices and merry laughter were once more heard in the cottage ; there was at times , an unwonted restraint upon some there : even upon Rose herself : which <NAME> could not fail to remark .
__label__0	The position of this island was most uncertain .
__label__0	“ I wonder whether these calculations were made before or after the 1st of <NAME> ; it makes all the difference , ” said <NAME> .
__label__0	It puts in at <NAME> and <NAME> , but it starts from <NAME> . ''
__label__1	So far from having high connections I have no connections at all , and I come of the scum of the earth .
__label__0	<NAME> recounted , with an assurance which never failed , numerous fictitious events of his journey .
__label__0	They remind one of the confusion in the islands of the <NAME> , where the land is excessively indented .
__label__0	Just as various States have done for voyages of discovery in the Polar Regions , I offer a reward to the crew of this schooner .
__label__1	`` This foreign young woman has been my lodger for some weeks back . ''
__label__0	To what cataclysm is this phenomenon to be attributed , so frequent in <NAME> , entire forests struck dead by some epidemic ; no one knows ; neither the oldest natives , nor their ancestors who have lain long buried in the groves of the dead , have ever seen them green .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> walked at a good smart pace in front ; and <NAME> , whose legs were not so long as his master 's , ran by the side .
__label__1	The name I have heard <NAME> mention , tossing in his dreams , <NAME> ; is it not ? ’ ‘ The name of the <NAME> is <NAME> , ’ said Mr Fledgeby , with a rather uncompromising accent on his noun-substantive .
__label__1	We have but too much reason to suppose , my dear child , that if an effort had been made in time , in this family , a train of the most trying and distressing circumstances might have been avoided .
__label__1	‘ They won ’ t let you be more than a Casual there .
__label__1	But I was restlessly curious to look at her -- so curious that I felt it to be one of the few sources of entertainment left to me .
__label__1	The moment they began to flag , the mischievous <NAME> , addressing <NAME> with great politeness , said -- ‘ Will you allow me to look at your paper , <NAME> , when you have quite done with it ? ’ ‘ You will find very little to repay you for your trouble in this contemptible _thing_ , sir , ’ replied <NAME> , bestowing a Satanic frown on <NAME> .
__label__1	Do I ? ’ ‘ Yes , ’ she answered with a smile .
__label__0	An immense saloon -- a sort of museum , in which were heaped up , with all the treasures of the mineral world , works of art , marvels of industry -- appeared before the eyes of the colonists , who almost thought themselves suddenly transported into a land of enchantment .
__label__0	The event justified <NAME> 's predictions .
__label__0	THE <NAME> TO THE <NAME> .
__label__0	The Major and <NAME> went five miles up the river in search of a favorable passage , but everywhere they found the same roaring , rushing , impetuous torrent .
__label__0	This town was a little north of <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ What light is that ! ’ said the younger brother .
__label__1	That I should innocently take a bad half-crown of somebody else 's manufacture is reasonable enough ; but that I should knowingly reckon the spurious coin of my own make as good money !
__label__1	But on the contrary , comrade , what MAY we find ?
__label__1	I might only weaken what is ill enough said as it is .
__label__1	‘ He will do now , ’ says the doctor , washing his hands , and looking at the patient with growing disfavour .
__label__0	<NAME> was the first repast of the castaways on this unknown coast .
__label__0	`` Detestable indeed , and one that does not suit a boat like the <NAME> . ''
__label__0	There , on a square tablet of granite , which had been smoothed by rubbing it with another stone , we could see two mysterious , and much worn letters , the two initials of the bold and extraordinary traveler who had preceded us on our adventurous journey .
__label__0	`` Then , '' said <NAME> , `` we shall have time to finish our journey -- that is , if <NAME> does not interfere with it . ''
__label__1	‘ I ain ’ t a man of many words , but I take it very kind of you to be so friendly , and above-board .
__label__1	<NAME> out , man , ’ retorted <NAME> .
__label__0	“ After a good rest , and a little more food , she will be stronger .
__label__1	In short , she was shaking the curls again , when the little dog came running along the walk to our relief .
__label__1	Grandfather Smallweed immediately throws the cushion at her .
__label__1	That the mother and father , unknown to one another , were dwelling within so many miles , furlongs , yards if you like , of one another .
__label__1	A mutual understanding follows , and I think it may carry us through .
__label__1	`` Yes , we happened to meet oftener , '' he returned .
__label__1	‘ I do nothing but beg and pray you to be comforted and overlook it .
__label__0	I knew that in time he must hit upon the right phrase .
__label__1	That he was afraid he took a rash step in doing anything for the boy , and one that might expose him to the censure of the prudent ; but that he did it of himself and for himself , and risked the consequences single-handed ; and that his mother ’ s past connexion with Mr <NAME> ’ s family had nothing to do with it , and that Mr <NAME> had nothing to do with it , but that he , Mr Carker , was the be-all and the end-all of this business .
__label__0	`` Be so good as to sit down , '' he said .
__label__1	Only don ’ t talk of anticipating means , <NAME> , as a discovery ; because that would be too much. ’ ‘ Too much , ma ’ am ? ’ said Mr Meagles , as seeking an explanation .
__label__1	The phantom that my mind pursued , was another and more real child .
__label__0	One of the boats which was towed behind the _Saint-Jean <NAME> was carried away by the waves .
__label__0	Thus , though it had been so troublesome a matter to find horses and vehicles when going to <NAME> , there was no difficulty in leaving it ; for under present circumstances few travelers cared to venture on the <NAME> roads .
__label__1	Towards him the old man sometimes directed his eyes for an instant , and then brought them back again to the candle ; which with a long-burnt wick drooping almost double , and hot grease falling down in clots upon the table , plainly showed that his thoughts were busy elsewhere .
__label__0	But he was more disturbed at the prospect of her future fate .
__label__0	The travellers intended to devote to their journey the few weeks of good weather which nature allows to these northern regions .
__label__1	You have no right to do it ; I ’ m sure we never interfered with you .
__label__0	At this moment , the light of the lantern slowly fell , and at last went out !
__label__1	<NAME> , too , as they came from work , proffered their help ; or sent their children with such small presents or loans as the strangers needed most .
__label__0	`` Good beast , good beast , '' he would cry .
__label__1	His walking did not bring him home until the dawn of day .
__label__1	What is the meaning of it , <NAME> ? ’ added <NAME> , in a threatening , and a louder tone .
__label__1	<NAME> at him while I ask the way , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	This he could not now delay in doing .
__label__1	Is that the boat , where I see a light yonder ? ’ ‘ That ’ s the boat , ’ said I .
__label__0	The doctor then began to think of his ruined cabin , of his lost collections , of his precious instruments destroyed , his books torn , burned to ashes .
__label__1	‘ “ You a miserable man ! ” said the goblin , in a tone of excessive contempt .
__label__0	On the north , from this breach to the sea , by the new water-course which had hollowed out a bed for itself across the plateau and shore , above and below the fall , and it would be enough to dig the bed of this creek a little deeper to make it impracticable for animals , on all the eastern border by the sea itself , from the mouth of the aforesaid creek to the mouth of the <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> re-asserts it by another inclination of his head .
__label__1	`` I 'm very glad to hear it . ''
__label__1	‘ And poor <NAME> , perhaps , my dear ? ’ suggested R. W. ‘ Pardon me , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ no ! ’ It was one of the worthy woman ’ s specialities that she had an amazing power of gratifying her splenetic or worldly-minded humours by extolling her own family : which she thus proceeded , in the present case , to do .
__label__0	No , the danger does not lie there ! ''
__label__1	It won ’ t do to be like long <NAME> , when they took him to church “ to marry him to somebody ” , as he says , and left the bride behind .
__label__1	`` I am very sure , sir , '' returned <NAME> , `` that I speak for <NAME> too when I say that you have the strongest power over us both -- rooted in respect , gratitude , and affection -- strengthening every day . ''
__label__0	They did not even turn on the gas full head to see what they were eating ; each man stood solidly at his window , the glass of which they had enough to do in keeping free from the rapidly condensing moisture .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> felt the volcanic tufa with which the plain was strewn , and which was but pulverized cinders hardened into solid blocks by time , tremble beneath him , but he could discover no traces of fresh lava .
__label__0	The crew of the <NAME> was composed of <NAME> , the master , and four hardy mariners , who were familiar with the <NAME> seas .
__label__1	'In the King 's name , ' cried the voices without ; and the hoarse cry arose again , but louder .
__label__0	Its motion has been turned into heat .
__label__1	‘ I think I am , Trot. ’ She looked so steadfastly at me : with a kind of doubt , or pity , or suspense in her affection : that I summoned the stronger determination to show her a perfectly cheerful face .
__label__0	`` Lost her tail you mean , '' said <NAME> .
__label__0	`` Well , listen to this , <NAME> ; it results very clearly from geographical facts , and from the study of isothermal lines , that the coldest spot on the globe is not on the Pole itself ; like the magnetic pole , it lies a few degrees distant .
__label__1	It is said that on the occasion of a visit from <NAME> or <NAME> to this town ( I forget which , but it is not to the purpose ) , he walked through three miles and a half of these young ladies all dressed out with parasols and silk stockings .
__label__1	asked <NAME> , in the same hollow whisper ; 'No sick wretch or idiot in some other bed ?
__label__0	They appeared determined to offer every possible obstacle to the execution of <NAME> 's orders .
__label__1	What a pleasure to be the cause of that bright change in her attentive face , and the object of that sweet regard and welcome !
__label__1	‘ To bed again , poor boy ! ’ ‘ Ay ! ’ cried the child , in a burst of despair .
__label__0	In two years and a half , <NAME> and his two sailors had metamorphosed the island .
__label__1	Next to accepting a large sum on the spot , I believe this gave <NAME> more comfort than anything I could have done .
__label__0	The next morning they set about building stores and a magazine ; this took them about a week , including the time employed for emptying the <NAME> , which was not done without difficulty , for the low temperature did not permit them to work very long .
__label__0	As for <NAME> , he did not seem to mind the inclement cold .
__label__0	He would offer himself as a cook or servant , in payment of his passage and meals .
__label__0	Nevertheless , such as it is , this body will tell its own history . ''
__label__1	There were also an elderly lady from the back-parlour , and one more young lady , who , next to the collector , perhaps was the great lion of the party , being the daughter of a theatrical fireman , who ‘ went on ’ in the pantomime , and had the greatest turn for the stage that was ever known , being able to sing and recite in a manner that brought the tears into Mrs. <NAME> ’ s eyes .
__label__1	Shake hands with it on .
__label__0	It was the 1st of April , a Sunday , <NAME> Day , which <NAME> and his companions sanctified by rest and prayer .
__label__1	“ Pooh ! ” said he , sluicing his face , and speaking through the water-drops ; “ it 's nothing , <NAME> .
__label__1	Do you know what would become of the <NAME> in that case ?
__label__0	It would be cruel -- too cruel .
__label__1	A man of the name of <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> was only exhibited in him by movement , his senses had not as yet been restored .
__label__0	The pressure of the water had evidently now become too enormous to allow further descent .
__label__1	They both entered after me -- the last springing in , after putting up the steps .
__label__0	Every one 's attention had to be concentrated on avoiding blocks of ice .
__label__1	However , he left word that you were to make yourself comfortable till he came back , and that I was to entertain you , which I shall be very glad to do. ’ In proof of his extreme readiness to exert himself for the general entertainment , <NAME> drew a chair to the table as he spoke , and helping himself plentifully to the cold meat , invited <NAME> and <NAME> to follow his example .
__label__0	The tall tufts of gastrolobium were motionless .
__label__1	The cat expands her wicked mouth and snarls at him .
__label__0	Whenever they assumed a particularly lively and pleasant air , I was convinced that they had committed a theft , and I often pretended not to see it . ''
__label__1	Oh , I assure you he is very odd ! ''
__label__0	I could feel his hot and fetid breath on my neck ; and with a horrid jump -- awoke from my nightmare sleep .
__label__1	Do you think I would tell you so or come to you like this , if it were not the case ? ’ <NAME> looked at him more closely .
__label__1	It is , how <NAME> could love me so when I so little deserved it , and how you , Mr and <NAME> , could be so forgetful of yourselves , and take such pains and trouble , to make me a little better , and after all to help him to so unworthy a wife .
__label__1	`` Now , <NAME> , '' he said to me as we walked quickly away .
__label__0	Since that time to our days the <NAME> work has been suspended .
__label__0	`` What should I do there , <NAME> , and what could I ever have done there ?
__label__0	<NAME> had only a nominal authority , and the association of merchants who had defrayed the expenses of the equipment not accepting him willingly as chief , had found means to oppose all the plans of the <NAME> sailor .
__label__1	All this time , <NAME> never raised her eyes , unless to glance towards her mother when that lady ’ s fervent spirit shone forth in words .
__label__1	Now , <NAME> bounced into the room with great impetuosity ; for , supposing her son-in-law to be still a-bed , she had come to relieve her feelings by pronouncing a strong opinion upon his general conduct and character .
__label__0	Surely he is mistaken , '' I cried in a tone of wonder .
__label__0	As the lieutenant did not return on board either in the evening or the next morning , <NAME> , feeling sure that an accident had happened , sent in search of him .
__label__0	This Joam Garral knew by experience , and he intended to profit by the phenomenon to launch the jangada , after having built it in comfort on the river bank .
__label__1	It was right that all that had sustained me should give way at once and that I should die of terror and my conscience .
__label__1	To read it ? ’ ‘ Bless ye ! ’ She reads it with surprise , and looks down with a new expression and an added interest on the motionless face she kneels beside .
__label__1	<NAME> languished in <NAME> ’ s <NAME> for six months , and at the expiration of that term sauntered back one evening with his hands in his pockets , and incidentally observed to his sister that he was not going back again .
__label__0	I replied , with a gesture of incredulity .
__label__0	At eight o ’ clock <NAME> had not appeared , but there was no doubt that the frightful weather alone hindered his return , and that he must have taken refuge in some cave , to await the end of the storm or at least the return of day .
__label__1	Wives , again , put on weeds for their husbands , as if , so far from grieving in the garb of sorrow , they had made up their minds to render it as becoming and attractive as possible .
__label__1	When he grew tall enough to peep through the keyhole of the great lock of the main door , he had divers times set down his father ’ s dinner , or supper , to get on as it might on the outer side thereof , while he stood taking cold in one eye by dint of peeping at her through that airy perspective .
__label__0	The <NAME> and the <NAME> confirmed much of the information which <NAME> had already obtained .
__label__1	There was some singing , too , from <NAME> and <NAME> , and very likely there might have been more , if the fly-driver , who stopped to drive the happy pair to the spot where they proposed to take steamboat to <NAME> , had not sent in a peremptory message intimating , that if they didn ’ t come directly he should infallibly demand eighteen-pence over and above his agreement .
__label__0	No museum in <NAME> possesses such a collection of the produce of the ocean .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> , I ’ m sure you know that he was always very umble , sir ! ’ It was singular to see how the mother still held to the old trick , when the son had abandoned it as useless .
__label__1	The little spot made them the more beautiful .
__label__0	After winding beneath the shade of ficuses , tahuaris , nipa palms , and cecropias , it enters the <NAME> by five mouths .
__label__1	That more than this she would never ( and he was well persuaded of the steadfastness of her resolution ) for any human consideration disclose .
__label__1	<NAME> , my good woman -- dear me , what a situation -- pray consider. -- Mrs .
__label__0	The crew could go no farther .
__label__1	Now , Mr Nickleby , ’ said the man , with a strange mixture of humility and sense of power , ‘ what help and assistance will you give me ; what bribe , to speak out plainly ?
__label__0	Up to this date the position of the island of <NAME> , was differently given on nearly all maps , and <NAME> , who intended to harbour there , take in water , and get a little fresh meat , came upon it almost unawares .
__label__1	The air felt cold upon the river , but it was a bright day , and the sunshine was very cheering .
__label__1	Not so , however , Mr Sparkler .
__label__0	All climbed down through the rain to the level of the sea .
__label__1	that Knuckleboy , ’ said Mrs. Squeers impatiently .
__label__1	You are acquainted , perhaps , with the famous name of <NAME> ? ’ ‘ The great Merdle ! ’ exclaimed Mrs General .
__label__1	You will not be the cause of my becoming worse. ” “ Since the state of your mind that you describe , is , at all events , attributable to some influence of mine -- this is what I mean , if I can make it plain -- can I use no influence to serve you ?
__label__0	The formalities by which the Cochin-Chinese envoys were , so to speak , hemmed in , reminded <NAME> of the anecdote of the envoy and the governor of <NAME> , who , rivalling each other in their gravity and diplomatic prudence , remained together for twenty-four hours without exchanging a word .
__label__1	I 'm wrong out of the forge , the kitchen , or off th ' meshes .
__label__1	It would n't put you out ? ” I expressed the readiness I felt , and we went into the castle .
__label__0	`` That is the best plan . ''
__label__0	The nucleus of the comet , being excessively hard , has done exactly what a ball would do fired with that velocity close to a pane of glass .
__label__0	The package of notes not being found when five o'clock sounded from the ponderous clock in the `` drawing office , '' the amount was passed to the account of profit and loss .
__label__0	But the dam held firm , and after a moment of terrible suspense the torrent precipitated itself into <NAME> from a height of twenty feet .
__label__1	‘ How could I help myself ?
__label__1	‘ By <NAME> , <NAME> , ’ cried the Major , ‘ there ’ s a lady in the case. ’ ‘ Indeed , I begin to believe there really is , ’ returned <NAME> ; ‘ I thought you might be jesting when you seemed to hint at it ; for I know you military men ’ -- The <NAME> gave the horse ’ s cough , and shook his head and shoulders , as much as to say , ‘ Well !
__label__0	“ Shall we go this high very long ? ” asked <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ I do not , <NAME> , I do not , ’ said <NAME> ‘ The society in which you move -- necessarily move , from your station , connection , and endowments -- is one vortex and whirlpool of the most frightful excitement .
__label__1	A garret , and a <NAME> garret without compromise , was <NAME> ’ s room .
__label__1	He looked back over his shoulder , and beckoned them to enter .
__label__1	And now <NAME> looked on more attentively than ever , when the master of the house , having his daughter leaning fondly on him , sat down with her and her mother at his own fireside ; and when he thought that such another creature , quite as graceful and as full of promise , might have called him father , and been a spring-time in the haggard winter of his life , his sight grew very dim indeed .
__label__0	It is the wildest shore I have ever seen , and appears entirely composed of mountains and rocks , without a vestige of vegetation .
__label__1	The old man and the child dwelt alone together .
__label__1	'He is the master of this establishment ; his death will cause a wacancy ; that wacancy must be filled up .
__label__0	Four of the crew waited at the door , and conducted us to that cell where we had passed our first night on board the <NAME> .
__label__1	She was particularly delighted when <NAME> assured her that there were hospitals , and very kindly conducted hospitals , in <NAME> .
__label__1	They send from their twelve States one hundred members , while the fourteen free States , with a free population nearly double , return but a hundred and forty-two .
__label__1	We have never had any quarrel , to which I have been a party .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> emerges from behind the cherubim ’ s leg , when all is quiet , and comes slowly down from the gallery .
__label__0	253 He traced the coast of Tartary .
__label__1	Mrs <NAME> listened attentively , until she had finished .
__label__1	I do n't mean constant to <NAME> , for I love her dearly -- better and better every day -- but constant to myself .
__label__1	He read almost at a glance , and made combinations of one letter with another and one business with another as he went on , adding new matter to the heaps -- much as a man would know the cards at sight , and work out their combinations in his mind after they were turned .
__label__1	If she likes to make any little arrangement , afterwards , in the way of doing any little thing for us at home , very well .
__label__1	Wednesday being so close upon us , we determined to go back to <NAME> that night , three in the post-chaise ; the rather , as we should then be clear away before the night 's adventure began to be talked of .
__label__1	I often look up at the stars , even from the balcony of this room , and believe that I am in the street again , shut out with <NAME> .
__label__0	Here the voyage of the giant raft , so tragically interrupted , had just come to a pause in the midst of its long journey , and here will be unfolded the further vicissitudes of the mysterious history of the fazender of <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> hurried to the window .
__label__1	I was called into that room which is now his -- I have never entered it since -- and came out , what you know me .
__label__0	As he was reflecting in this wise , his eyes fell upon an immense placard which a sort of clown was carrying through the streets .
__label__0	You received a letter , <NAME> ? ” “ Yes , a letter from your Honor. ” “ At <NAME> ? ” “ At <NAME> , just as our repairs were completed. ” “ And this letter ? ” “ It was not written by you , but bore your signature , my Lord. ” “ Just so ; my letter was brought by a convict called <NAME> Joyce. ” “ No , by a sailor called <NAME> , a quartermaster on the BRITANNIA. ” “ Yes , <NAME> or <NAME> , one and the same individual .
__label__1	<NAME> , broad-skirted laced coats , with great cuffs and no collars ; and wigs , gentlemen -- great formal wigs with a tie behind .
__label__1	To <NAME> ’ s , <NAME> now betook himself according to appointment ; and to <NAME> he related how , last night , some young blustering blade , whom he had never seen , forced his way into his house , and tried to frighten him from the proposed nuptials .
__label__0	“ The fellow knows how to make a good bargain , ” said <NAME> , as <NAME> , after casting a distrustful look around , went out of the cabin .
__label__0	There was no man in <NAME> to compare in interest with this Zacharius .
__label__0	“ At your service , sir , ” replied <NAME> with imperturbable gravity .
__label__0	The approaching marriage created great excitement in <NAME> .
__label__0	Hence the letter contradicting yours ; hence , after my arrival , all the accidents that occurred , such as the block of stone thrown at <NAME> , the broken ladder at the <NAME> shaft , the obstruction of the openings into the wall of the new cutting ; hence , in short , our imprisonment , and then our deliverance , brought about by the kind assistance of <NAME> , who acted of course without the knowledge of this man <NAME> , and contrary to his intentions. ” “ You describe everything exactly as it must have happened , <NAME> , ” returned old Simon .
__label__0	On the 26th , <NAME> , who was ahead , shouted suddenly to his companions .
__label__1	The trooper shakes his head .
__label__1	In a happy compromise between her two states of existence , she had already become , with her workbasket before her , the equably vivacious companion with a slight judicious flavouring of information , when the <NAME> announced herself .
__label__1	But the old gentleman 's shoulders were shrugged up to his ears ; and his eyes were vacantly staring on the opposite wall .
__label__0	`` We shall have to burn the ship down to the water-line , I suppose , '' said <NAME> .
__label__1	It remained thus , until the first warning bell began to ring .
__label__0	To think of that , when at one ’ s last gasp !
__label__1	asked the other man in a hoarse voice .
__label__1	But there being now an appearance of a temporary calm , in which the proceedings of little Wackford could scarcely fail to be observed , he feigned to be aware of the circumstance for the first time , and inflicted upon the face of that young gentleman a slap that made the very tea-cups ring .
__label__1	You ’ ll know our light porter again ? ’ ‘ Yes , sure , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	I took the tablets from her hand , and it trembled again , and it trembled more as she took off the chain to which the pencil was attached , and put it in mine .
__label__1	<NAME> was his pride , that he indignantly took her away , as if from reproach and disgrace .
__label__1	Those who prove unable to earn their own livelihood will not be retained ; as it is not desirable to convert the establishment into an alms-house , or to retain any but working bees in the hive .
__label__1	Some purpose , strong enough to fill up any pause , possessed her .
__label__0	The detachment went at full trot into the narrow street .
__label__0	It was simply two glasses which he had taken from his own and the reporter ’ s watches .
__label__1	My aunt took her hand in hers , and laughed .
__label__0	`` And what answer did you make to <NAME> ? ''
__label__1	He did everything for me except the household work , for which he had engaged a very decent woman , after paying off the laundress on his first arrival .
__label__0	“ It is shocking ! ” replied <NAME> .
__label__0	10 Map of <NAME> , <NAME> , and part of <NAME> face woodcut of <NAME> of <NAME> .
__label__1	The first sitting was limited .
__label__0	The rich blue of the iris was darker than formerly .
__label__1	`` My dear <NAME> , '' said <NAME> , poking the fire , `` I 'll take an oath it 's either in the east or going to be .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> ? ’ Miss <NAME> repeated as she panted from stair to stair , ‘ where have I heard that name ?
__label__0	We observed this astonishing phenomenon from the vessel , and the illusion was so great that those on board believed the <NAME> had fire-arms , and we ourselves should have imagined they fired guns , but that our ship was so close that in such a case we must have heard the explosion . ''
__label__0	But this cipher <NAME> did not know .
__label__1	'And your reasons , <NAME> , ' he said , at length , in a low voice ; 'your reasons for this decision ? '
__label__0	`` But you , '' asked <NAME> , hurriedly , `` were you not on your way to the Pole ? ''
__label__0	`` <NAME> , with a good harpoon !
__label__1	I think that will cure her , my boy .
__label__0	There , everyone was lying asleep , not only on the benches , but also on the bales , packages , and even the deck itself .
__label__0	<NAME> begged him to repeat the word until he could pronounce it .
__label__0	And -- a fact which touched him more nearly -- the <NAME> had not been visited by either Len Guy or his crew since the arrival of the <NAME> .
__label__1	Only I ’ ll take it as a favour if you ’ ll part company for the present .
__label__1	There were the piles of city roofs and chimneys , more free from smoke than on week-days ; and there were the distant masts and steeples .
__label__1	‘ Hum -- eh -- what ’ s that ? ’ said the strange man .
__label__1	You shall well and truly try -- ’ ‘ I beg this court ’ s pardon , ’ said the chemist , who was a tall , thin , yellow-visaged man , ‘ but I hope this court will excuse my attendance. ’ ‘ On what grounds , <NAME> ? ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	inquired my guardian , almost sternly .
__label__1	Having seen him safely carried into the hotel , he turned his face homewards , running as fast as he could , to make up for lost time : and recalling with a great deal of astonishment and some fear , the extraordinary behaviour of the person from whom he had just parted .
__label__0	I estimated ( though , perhaps , I may be mistaken ) -- I estimated this adventurous course of the <NAME> to have lasted fifteen or twenty days .
__label__0	`` Let me show you how thoroughly .
__label__1	‘ You are the executor , I see , ’ he added , casting his eyes over the paper .
__label__1	You may do anything with me if you only show me children .
__label__1	He has long had money ( not overmuch as I make out ) in trust to dole out to her when she can ’ t do without it .
__label__1	‘ Good-night , ’ he said , after having sunk into a moody silence , with his hands clasped behind him , and his eyes suspiciously wandering about Wegg. -- ‘ No !
__label__0	Very soon the <NAME> , who had hitherto been content to place obstacles in the way of the travellers , approached them with intent to stop them .
__label__1	These motions , although unquestionably of the greatest assistance to original composition , retard in some degree the progress of the writer ; and <NAME> had unconsciously been a full hour and a half writing words in small text , smearing out wrong letters with his little finger , and putting in new ones which required going over very often to render them visible through the old blots , when he was roused by the opening of the door and the entrance of his parent .
__label__1	`` <NAME> , '' said I , `` you place great confidence in me , but I fear you will not take advice from me ? ''
__label__0	“ But he will make us a fire ! ” replied <NAME> , “ only have a little patience , <NAME> ! ” The seaman looked at <NAME> in a way which seemed to say , “ If it depended upon you to do it , we wouldn ’ t taste roast meat very soon ” ; but he was silent .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> gently pressed her hand to his lips , and sank upon the sofa .
__label__0	Leave him to wander about in this desert !
__label__1	A profound silence was observed during the ride .
__label__1	Has he been here long ?
__label__0	They are kept to the ship by the winter ; but who can say what plans they are not capable of forming ?
__label__1	A little hard-headed , <NAME> pippin-faced man , was conversing with a fat old gentleman in one corner ; and two or three more old gentlemen , and two or three more old ladies , sat bolt upright and motionless on their chairs , staring very hard at <NAME> and his fellow-voyagers .
__label__0	`` Do not be afraid , '' said the unknown .
__label__1	My Uncle ’ s child made people ’ s blood run cold , some times , she did ! ’ ‘ <NAME> ? ’ asked <NAME> .
__label__1	It passed me , and went on to <NAME> .
__label__1	_I_ 'm your <NAME> , you know. ” Then he began grumbling again : “ With your flying into the face of your own wittles and drink !
__label__1	I found him in his dressing-room surrounded by his stock of boots , already hard at it , washing his hands of us .
__label__1	‘ And the other rioter -- what ’ s his name , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Tupman , Sir. ’ Tupman is the second ? ’ ‘ Yes. ’ ‘ The other principal , you say , has absconded , ma ’ am ? ’ ‘ Yes , ’ replied <NAME> , with a short cough .
__label__0	<NAME> spurted from my nose and mouth !
__label__0	The ship and its inmates , <NAME> , M. Fridriksson , and the great summit of <NAME> !
__label__0	The captain , whose duty would have kept him on board to the last , had been the first to quit the ship .
__label__1	The well-trimmed lawns and green meadows of home are not there ; and the grass , compared with our ornamental plots and pastures , is rank , and rough , and wild : but delicate slopes of land , gently-swelling hills , wooded valleys , and slender streams , abound .
__label__1	‘ “ Who calls so loud ? ” ’ cried <NAME> .
__label__1	It was plain enough , nevertheless , as <NAME> had said ; over a lime-splashed gateway in the corner , within which <NAME> kept a ladder and a barrel or two .
__label__1	As to <NAME> , <NAME> 's brother , I am really afraid to say what he did at school in ciphering , but I think it was decimals .
__label__0	`` That Pen is a worthless fellow , '' the doctor said to him .
__label__0	Neb brought this piece of metal to his master , who was then occupied with his companions in the workshop of the <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> , you know it. ’ ‘ I am happy to say , <NAME> , ’ pursued <NAME> , at once with great delicacy and with great earnestness , ‘ that in your absence <NAME> has considerably improved .
__label__1	“ Disguise from you is impossible .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> said , my lad , ’ observed the <NAME> , nodding his head thoughtfully ; ‘ and true .
__label__0	<NAME> recoiled , and , in spite of the assertions of the pilot , the thought recurred to him that some living cayman might even then be met with in the deeps near the <NAME> of <NAME> !
__label__0	Their feet still struck against the wooden sleepers which used to support the rails .
__label__0	The center of this wooden disc was hollowed out to a diameter equal to the exterior diameter of the <NAME> .
__label__1	I hope we shall continue to do so ; and that in the fulness of time , even deans and chapters may be converted .
__label__1	`` He has none , and no anger .
__label__1	But no argument in favour of the system , can reasonably be deduced from this circumstance , although it is very often urged .
__label__1	`` If you have allowed anything wrong to come to that security of <NAME> 's , and if you have let him in for it , and if you have put us in danger of being sold up -- and I see sold up in your face , <NAME> , as plain as print -- you have done a shameful action and have deceived us cruelly .
__label__1	`` Talk of the angels , '' says <NAME> .
__label__0	there is the white line of the <NAME> where old <NAME> is watching for us with his big telescope ! '
__label__1	There was something in this .
__label__1	I served you because I was proud ; because I was a lonely man with you , and there were no other drudges to see my degradation ; and because nobody knew , better than you , that I was a ruined man : that I hadn ’ t always been what I am : and that I might have been better off , if I hadn ’ t been a fool and fallen into the hands of you and others who were knaves .
__label__1	A labyrinth of grandeur , less the property of an old family of human beings and their ghostly likenesses than of an old family of echoings and thunderings which start out of their hundred graves at every sound and go resounding through the building .
__label__1	Under the forcing system , a young gentleman usually took leave of his spirits in three weeks .
__label__1	We walked about on the cliff after that , and sat on the grass , and looked at things through a telescope -- I could make out nothing myself when it was put to my eye , but I pretended I could -- and then we came back to the hotel to an early dinner .
__label__1	The old lady is not seventy-three now , my dear Sir. ’ The little man paused , and took a pinch of snuff .
__label__1	<NAME> would insist upon carrying the basket , and <NAME> would insist upon carrying it herself , which gave rise to a struggle , in which <NAME> captured the basket and the bandbox likewise .
__label__1	‘ Yes , there is , ’ interposed the link-boy , ‘ I ’ ve been a-ringing at it ever so long. ’ ‘ It ’ s only a handle , ’ said Mrs. <NAME> , ‘ the wire ’ s broken. ’ ‘ I wish the servants ’ heads wos , ’ growled the long man .
__label__1	She clung to him as she should have clung to some far better nature that day , and was a little shaken in her reserved composure for the first time .
__label__0	To this question , which each one asked himself , a reply was suddenly made by <NAME> .
__label__1	Never were such shouts heard as those which greeted <NAME> ’ s efforts to fix the sugar-loaf hat on his head , by way of entering the garden in style .

__label__0	But for <NAME> this danger is not to be feared .
__label__1	Oliver murmured his comprehension of the different bodies referred to ; and <NAME> proceeded to load the pistol , with great nicety and deliberation .
__label__1	‘ Are you going home ? ’ he said .
__label__1	I am obliged to go to London. ’ In less than another minute she was on her road to the railway , under <NAME> ’ s protection .
__label__0	“ I have come down the <NAME> from <NAME> to <NAME> .
__label__1	We were very gay and sociable , and I asked him , in the course of conversation , what he was ?
__label__1	-- do n't be ashamed still to confide in me , for there will be nothing monstrous or uncommon in it .
__label__0	There was another serious element in their grief .
__label__0	This question preoccupied him , for it was possible that from the way the hat inclined , that is to say , towards the north , the plateau was not practicable .
__label__1	I look forward a long while , through years and years , and think that then , when I am growing old , or when I am dead perhaps , a beautiful woman , his daughter , happily married , may be proud of him and a blessing to him .
__label__1	You may have heard some account of her ? ’ ‘ I think I have , ’ he answered , ‘ if her name was Higden. ’ ‘ Her name was <NAME> .
__label__0	What if the atmosphere had really withdrawn to this dark face ?
__label__1	I quite agree with you , <NAME> , that perhaps topics may be incautiously mentioned upstairs before him , which it would be as well for his little mind not to expatiate upon ; but I really don ’ t see how that is to be helped , in the case of a child of his quickness .

__label__0	<NAME> took <NAME> ’ s hand , and they started .
__label__0	But if all the information that we owe to the ancients , both <NAME> and <NAME> , with regard to these hyperborean countries be extremely vague and so to speak fabulous , it is not so with that which concerns the adventurous enterprises of the `` Men of the <NAME> . ''
__label__1	He has the constitution of a rhinoceros , the digestion of an ostrich , and the concentration of an oyster .
__label__1	But I confess I do n't see why our young friend , in his degree , should not seek to invest himself with such poetry as is open to him .
__label__1	Other professional men go out of town .
__label__1	And , ’ said Mrs. Micawber , ‘ though it is possible I may be mistaken in my view of the ceremony , I never will ! ’ ‘ My dear , ’ said <NAME> , a little impatiently , ‘ I am not conscious that you are expected to do anything of the sort. ’ ‘ I am aware , my dear <NAME> , ’ pursued Mrs. Micawber , ‘ that I am now about to cast my lot among strangers ; and I am also aware that the various members of my family , to whom <NAME> has written in the most gentlemanly terms , announcing that fact , have not taken the least notice of <NAME> ’ s communication .
__label__1	‘ Hope so ! ’ echoed the dwarf , approaching close to his ear ; ‘ neighbour , I would I knew in what good investment all these supplies are sunk .
__label__1	‘ Well , <NAME> , how have you got on without me all day ?
__label__0	This ingratitude and faithlessness overwhelmed the aged man ; his health , already so much impaired , did not improve , and grief carried him to the grave .
__label__1	The <NAME> did not go to bed for a long time .
__label__1	His recital ended , <NAME> insisted upon his young friend ’ s stripping off his coat and allowing whatever injuries he had received to be properly tended .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> , mighty proud of the compliment , sets herself to consider ; but it is long before a bright thought occurs to her .
__label__1	I was only too happy to be in such request .
__label__1	My anger was roused in behalf of an absent , friendless stranger .
__label__1	What do you mean by leaving a man in this state , three weeks and more , you false-hearted wagabond ? '
__label__1	Veneering ’ s object is to let Pocket-Breaches know that his friend on his right ( <NAME> ) is a man of wealth .
__label__1	Do you see THIS ? ’ cried <NAME> , sitting up , and pointing to his prostrate lady , who was holding him very tight round the waist .
__label__1	More unfortunately still , she had relations .
__label__1	Our new shoes had come home , but we hadn ’ t put ‘ em on .
__label__1	Externally , <NAME> showed no signs of being mellowed by these glowing vintages .
__label__1	But , now , the chambers were cold and gloomy , and when she left her own little room to while away the tedious hours , and sat in one of them , she was still and motionless as their inanimate occupants , and had no heart to startle the echoes -- hoarse from their long silence -- with her voice .
__label__1	But is felled flat by <NAME> ’ s taking it quite ill , and replying , No , he don ’ t like town .
__label__0	Others have enormous hats of brown gulls ' feathers , almost as large as the wigs of <NAME> lawyers , and many have a simple wooden hoop , surrounded with white gulls ' feathers , which wave in the air .
__label__1	So now they has two ropes , ‘ bout six foot apart , and three from the floor , which goes right down the room ; and the beds are made of slips of coarse sacking , stretched across ‘ em. ’ ‘ Well , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	At that moment , a noise was heard on the road , about half a verst distant .
__label__0	“ Nobody expects us , ” said <NAME> ; “ that is very certain. ” “ No , indeed , ” answered <NAME> , with a sigh ; he was manifestly disappointed that his return to <NAME> was not welcomed with a triumphal reception .
__label__1	‘ I ’ ll leave all the presents behind , and begin again entirely on my own account. ’ That the resolution might be thoroughly carried into practice , she even changed the dress she wore , for that in which she had come to the grand mansion .
__label__0	`` And you shall hear it yourself , counsellor , '' returned <NAME> in a passion , `` for it will come better from my mouth than from yours !
__label__0	“ That would not have been so amusing , ” exclaimed <NAME> , rubbing his hands , as they disembarked on the right bank of the river , “ if it had not been so difficult. ” “ That which has only been difficult to us , friend , ” answered <NAME> , “ will , perhaps , be impossible to the Tartars. ” <NAME> STROGOFF might at last hope that the road to <NAME> was clear .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	Further still , even regarding the velocity to be acquired , and granting it to be sufficient , the shell could not resist the pressure of the gas developed by the ignition of 1,600,000 pounds of powder ; and supposing it to resist that pressure , it would be less able to support that temperature ; it would melt on quitting the <NAME> , and fall back in a red-hot shower upon the heads of the imprudent spectators .
__label__1	‘ You see , you go over to Staple with <NAME> and <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> ; ‘ I going in and out , and out and in alone , in my usual way ; you go up with those gentlemen to <NAME> ’ s rooms ; you look into <NAME> ’ s flower-garden ; you wait for <NAME> ’ s appearance there , or you signify to <NAME> that you are close by ; and you communicate with her freely , and no spy can be the wiser. ’ ‘ I am very much afraid I shall be— ’ ‘ Be what , my dear ? ’ asked <NAME> , as she hesitated .
__label__0	The chief of <NAME> allowed his visitors to take his portrait in full martial costume , thereby showing his superiority to his subjects , who would not do the same for fear of witchcraft .
__label__1	On my return downstairs , I felt that Mrs. <NAME> looked down upon me rather for being so frivolous , and I was sorry for it , though at the same time I knew that I had no higher pretensions .
__label__1	It was on this very first day that I had the misfortune to throw her , though she was not subject to such weakness in general , into a state of violent consternation .
__label__1	What I am describing , slumbered , and half awoke , and slept again , in the innermost recesses of my mind .
__label__1	Nor was this all , for the elder <NAME> was going through a similar ceremony with <NAME> ; while <NAME> , with a very little second-hand camlet cloak , worn theatrically over his left shoulder , stood by , in the attitude of an attendant officer , waiting to convey the two victims to the scaffold .
__label__0	<NAME> , to-day is the 13th Prairal , the first of June , 1868 .
__label__1	`` An arrow launched at my brain by my own child ! ''
__label__1	Whether Mr Dombey , wrapped in his own greatness , was at all aware of this , or no , there had not been wanting opportunities already for his complete enlightenment ; and at that moment it might have been effected by the one glance of the dark eye that lighted on him , after it had rapidly and scornfully surveyed the theme of his self-glorification .
__label__1	'It make you nervous , <NAME> , -- reminds you of being nabbed , does it ? '
__label__0	`` Yes , friend <NAME> , '' observed <NAME> ; `` but there is a slight and unfortunately a fatal defect in your project .
__label__0	Besides , he went so far as to chat agreeably with them .
__label__0	Fortunately for the intrepid student his side was victorious , and he was left free to proceed on his journey . ''
__label__0	<NAME> was evidently ebbing slowly , and his extremities were already cold .
__label__1	But I am going down tomorrow morning to Mr Dombey , at <NAME> , and if <NAME> can entrust me with any commission , need I say how very happy I shall be ? ’ <NAME> immediately divining that <NAME> would desire to write a letter to her father , proposed to return , and besought Mr Carker to come home and dine in his riding gear .
__label__1	I prefer not to anticipate my communication here ; you will impart as much or as little of it as you please to your friends afterwards ; I have nothing to do with that. ” Amidst a wondering silence , we three walked out of the <NAME> , and in a wondering silence walked home .
__label__0	I forgot all -- fatigue , friends and collections -- and accepted without hesitation the offer of the <NAME> Government .
__label__1	At first , he was pleased with the discovery : hoping that it might be the forerunner of his release ; but such thoughts were quickly dispelled , on his sitting down to breakfast along with the Jew , who told him , in a tone and manner which increased his alarm , that he was to be taken to the residence of <NAME> that night .
__label__0	But , <NAME> , will you tell me , once for all , what there is so remarkable about the Pole ? ''
__label__1	I said to <NAME> that this was very true , and who should know it better than I , who loved <NAME> with a love that never mortal had experienced yet ?
__label__0	`` True , '' said <NAME> ; `` <NAME> talks sense .
__label__1	If I had had a conjuror ’ s cap , there is no one I should have wished for but you ! ’ ‘ What ? ’ returned <NAME> .
__label__0	The Americans are much more practical with their Mississippi islands ; they number them -- -- ” “ As they number the avenues and streets of their towns , ” replied <NAME> .
__label__0	On the 13th of October , 1866 , an <NAME> traveller and three of his guides were buried under a mass of ice that fell from <NAME> .
__label__1	I hardly know how to say it .
__label__1	Mrs Veneering in the same moment relinquishes baby to <NAME> ; presses her aquiline hands upon her brow , to arrange the throbbing intellect within ; orders out the carriage ; and repeats in a distracted and devoted manner , compounded of <NAME> and any self-immolating female of antiquity you may prefer , ‘ We must work. ’ Veneering having instructed his driver to charge at the <NAME> in the streets , like the Life-Guards at <NAME> , is driven furiously to <NAME> , <NAME> ’ s .
__label__1	* * * * * That same afternoon , the massive gray square tower of an old Cathedral rises before the sight of a jaded traveller .
__label__0	They took the precaution to barricade the entrance , but the bears could easily have overcome the obstacles if the idea had occurred to them ; they knew the number and strength of their adversaries , and they could easily have reached them .
__label__1	’ Tis a muddle , and that ’ s aw. ’ ‘ Always a muddle ? ’ said <NAME> , with another gentle touch upon his arm , as if to recall him out of the thoughtfulness , in which he was biting the long ends of his loose neckerchief as he walked along .
__label__1	When it got so high , it got the upper hand of me , but this is how I always know there 's a eight in it . ''
__label__1	I opened my eyes in the night , and I saw , in the great chair at the bedside , <NAME> .
__label__1	said <NAME> , walking again at a great pace , with a candle in his hand that had gone out .
__label__1	This business was capitally described in the advertisement , <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Then good-morning , ma ’ am , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	`` Look here , <NAME> and M'Nicholl ! ''
__label__0	In that case the entire excavation , vast as it was , would be completely flooded .
__label__1	I adore her in it !
__label__0	That will not do for me .
__label__0	I announced our names and rank , introducing in person Professor Aronnax , his servant Conseil , and master <NAME> , the harpooner .
__label__0	`` We 'll have no trunks ; only a carpet-bag , with two shirts and three pairs of stockings for me , and the same for you .
__label__1	<NAME> Orlick he 's been a bustin ' open a dwelling-ouse. ” “ <NAME> ? ” said I .
__label__0	During the last week of the month of August the weather moderated again .
__label__1	‘ You bring Trent to me .
__label__1	‘ Oh , my goodness , how polite we are ! ’ exclaimed <NAME> , making a preposterous attempt to cover her large face with her morsel of a hand .
__label__1	`` What is that to me ? ''
__label__1	<NAME> , being present , then named , in furtherance of a suggestion she had previously offered to the <NAME> , <NAME> .
__label__0	Not that they disputed much about it .
__label__1	He was , at first , somewhat disconcerted to meet us two together ; but quickly decided what to do , and came up to me .
__label__1	During the long vacation , sir , I shall devote my leisure to studying your interests more and more closely and to making arrangements for moving heaven and earth ( including , of course , the Chancellor ) after <NAME> term ; and when I ultimately congratulate you , sir , '' says <NAME> with the severity of a determined man , `` when I ultimately congratulate you , sir , with all my heart , on your accession to fortune -- which , but that I never give hopes , I might say something further about -- you will owe me nothing beyond whatever little balance may be then outstanding of the costs as between solicitor and client not included in the taxed costs allowed out of the estate .
__label__0	He soon discovered that the width of the channel by which he entered increased rapidly , and that it ultimately formed a vast lake communicating with the sea to the north-west .
__label__0	When the exact sciences began at last to make some progress , watch and clock making followed in their path , though it was always arrested by an insurmountable difficulty , -- the regular and continuous measurement of time .
__label__1	Do you know it was some time before I recovered the conduct of that alarming lady , on the night of your birth , <NAME> ? ’ I told him that I was going down to my aunt , the <NAME> of that night , early in the morning ; and that she was one of the most tender-hearted and excellent of women , as he would know full well if he knew her better .
__label__0	I must not omit to mention a trick played upon a sailor by a young savage .
__label__1	What , you know him , do you ? ''
__label__0	They were ingots of gold .
__label__1	It is a pleasant thing to see that the sun has been there ; to know that the air and light are on them every day ; to feel that they ARE children , and lead children ’ s lives ; that if their pillows be damp , it is with the dews of <NAME> , and not with tears ; that the limbs of their girls are free , and that they are not crippled by distortions , imposing an unnatural and horrible penance upon their sex ; that their lives are spent , from day to day , at least among the waving trees , and not in the midst of dreadful engines which make young children old before they know what childhood is , and give them the exhaustion and infirmity of age , without , like age , the privilege to die .
__label__0	By way of precaution , <NAME> went first to the office of the steam-packet company , and there made sure that the <NAME> would start at the appointed hour .
__label__1	' I would n't abase myself by descending to hold no conversation with him , ' replied the Dodger .

__label__0	About the 1st of November , ten days after they had set out , the caravan had gone fifty leagues to the northward .
__label__1	And write too , I shouldn ’ t wonder ? ’ ‘ Yes , ma ’ am , ’ said the child , fearful of giving new offence by the confession .
__label__1	On the other hand , you ca n't admit but what it 's natural in us to be anxious with such a thing hanging over our heads .
__label__1	“ Roast weal , ” says the patient .
__label__0	So soon as <NAME> was in sight , <NAME> wisely decided to conduct all his trade on board .
__label__1	<NAME> Bitherstone formerly of ours .
__label__0	After all , the air is so clear . ''
__label__1	Is it not a fact , <NAME> , that you have just now been unable to command your feelings even before me , whose eyes you had so completely closed ? ’ ‘ I have made no complaint , ’ sobbed <NAME> .
__label__1	There I see him , high up , behind the bars of a lofty iron cage , bloody and dusty as last night , looking through .
__label__1	<NAME> placed his hands upon his knees , and , without uttering a syllable , continued the same close scrutiny of his companion ’ s face .
__label__0	<NAME> was J. T. <NAME> .
__label__0	Should we ever be in such extremity ?
__label__1	Mr Toots tells <NAME> when he comes at night , that he hasn ’ t been so wretched all day long , and yet he likes it .
__label__1	‘ Excuse me , ’ said the gentleman hastily .
__label__0	The great artistic sculptors and builders of the <NAME> might have here completed their studies with advantage .
__label__0	He came down without saying a word .
__label__1	I am sure I can not imagine what the cause of it is .
__label__1	We will not detain you. ’ ‘ I thank you , sir , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	Underneath this bullet is piled a charge of 400 thousand pounds of gun-cotton , equivalent to 1600 thousand pounds of ordinary gunpowder !
__label__1	As the whispers became louder , which they did from that time every minute , they became more threatening .
__label__1	It is the mode. ’ Though <NAME> ’ s back was turned while he spoke , and thenceforth to the end of the interview , he kept those glittering eyes of his that were too near together , upon him , and evidently saw in the very carriage of the head , as he passed with his braggart recklessness from clause to clause of what he said , that he was saying nothing which <NAME> did not already know .
__label__1	‘ And it shows what notice father takes , though at his time of life , that he says to me this afternoon , which <NAME> <NAME> knows I neither make it up nor any ways enlarge , “ Mary , it ’ s much to be rejoiced in that <NAME> is not on the spot to behold it. ” Those were father ’ s words .
__label__1	‘ Have you any intention of going away again ? ’ <NAME> asked me , as I was standing by .
__label__0	“ Then don ’ t say a word to anyone , but fasten it up tight in your knapsack. ” <NAME> found the flag , and folded it up as he was directed .
__label__1	Indeed , I felt the whole state of my mind in reference to her to be weak and unreasonable , and I remonstrated with myself about it as much as I could .
__label__1	Now , in barge and boat ; and now ashore among the osiers , or tramping amidst mud and stakes and jagged stones in low-lying places , where solitary watermarks and signals of strange shapes showed like spectres , <NAME> worked and toiled .
__label__1	That don ’ t seem very far out of the way now , do it ? ’ <NAME> scratched his head mournfully , in reluctant admission that it did not , and clambering up to the old nail took down the cage and set himself to clean it and to feed the bird .
__label__1	A few of his brother chiefs had been obliged to become civilised , and to make themselves acquainted with what the whites knew , for it was their only chance of existence .
__label__1	Therefore it is sealed and deposited for posting among the iron correspondence of the day .
__label__1	At length Mr Dombey , bringing down <NAME> and <NAME> to see the children , and finding the Major again at <NAME> , invited him to dinner at the <NAME> , and complimented <NAME> highly , beforehand , on her neighbour and acquaintance .
__label__0	<NAME> prudence demanded that we should quit the <NAME> , which might slide down at a sharp shake of the iceberg .
__label__1	I lodge at one Mr <NAME> ’ s , at Holloway. ’ Mr <NAME> stared again .
__label__0	Not only had the copper sheathing and the planks disappeared , reduced , no doubt , to powder , but also the ribs , the iron bolts , and tree-nails which united them .
__label__0	The summits of the rocks are lost in the clouds and the valleys are covered with perpetual snow .
__label__0	They put him in irons .
__label__1	He paused to look at her , and , still holding her hand , said : ‘ <NAME> , I have not considered it essential to ask you one question , because the possibility implied in it appeared to me to be too remote .
__label__1	What I said was low ; that 's what it was ; low .

__label__0	The journey from <NAME> to <NAME> <NAME> consumed , formerly , under the most favourable conditions , at least six months .
__label__1	What did he tell thee , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Exactly what I told you , dear grandfather , indeed. ’ ‘ True , ’ said the old man , faintly .
__label__1	It 's well it 's the beer , and not the pot , as hit me , or I 'd have settled somebody .
__label__0	it can not be the <NAME> ! ''
__label__0	`` Here are the nine thousand dollars , '' said the captain , drawing a roll of paper dollars from his pocket .
__label__1	It has died in a moment without pain .
__label__1	<NAME> , my dear friend , pardon ! ’ <NAME> could scarcely believe the evidence of his senses , and perhaps would not have done so , but for the corroborative testimony afforded by the smiling countenance of <NAME> , and the bodily presence , in the background , of <NAME> and the pretty housemaid ; who appeared to contemplate the proceedings with the liveliest satisfaction .
__label__1	But whatever you do , do n't you fall a-crying , my dear ; and do n't you worry yourself no more than you can help .
__label__0	Half an hour had already passed without our situation being bettered , when the dense darkness suddenly gave way to extreme light .
__label__1	So as he won ’ t give me up , I ’ m a-going to give him up. ’ ‘ How , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ I ’ m a-going to run away from him. ’ With an astonished look at the indomitable old face and the bright eyes , the Secretary repeated , ‘ Run away from him ? ’ ‘ Yes , sir , ’ said <NAME> , with one nod .
__label__0	This mode of communication obliged them first to climb <NAME> , making a detour by the river ’ s bank , and then to descend two hundred feet through the passage , having to climb as far when they wished to return to the plateau .
__label__1	‘ Asides which , ’ adds the boy , ‘ there ain ’ t no family of Winkses. ’ ‘ I think there must be. ’ ‘ Yer lie , there ain ’ t .
__label__1	It is the <NAME> thing altogether .
__label__1	That individual is in legal possession of the premises , under a distress for rent .
__label__0	Then <NAME> , having ended his survey , re-ascended , drew up the ladder , covered the mouth of the well , and returned thoughtfully to the dining-room , saying to himself , -- `` I have seen nothing , and yet there _is_ something there ! ''
__label__0	According as we approached , the desolation of the land became more and more apparent , and the prospect of enduring six months ' wintering there would have appalled the stoutest hearts .
__label__1	‘ My own feelings exactly , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , putting her apron to her eyes , and shaking her head .
__label__0	It was only after a long search that <NAME> discovered a native dealer in old clothes , to whom he applied for an exchange .
__label__1	Now , the stake I have resolved to play for , in case of the worst , is a friend in the <NAME> .
__label__1	At that moment , <NAME> ( of course , the woman with the apron ) dropped the candlestick she held , and cried out , ‘ There !
__label__1	There was a terror in every ash that dropped out of the fire .
__label__1	He conversed with the great <NAME> on that relaxation of the throat with which young curates were too frequently afflicted , and on the means of lessening the great prevalence of that disorder in the church .
__label__1	You will revive yet. ” ‘ “ Never again , <NAME> ; never again , ” said the dying woman .
__label__0	I followed , and in a few minutes I had climbed to the top , which for a circle of ten yards commanded the whole mass of rock .
__label__0	During the evening many fin-backs were seen playing in the ice , and occasionally blowing .
__label__0	`` Yes , dear <NAME> , '' he continued , `` that pointed arrow of yours has by no means missed its mark , but I ca n't deny that my faith is beginning to be what you call a little 'shaky ' in the existence of my friends the <NAME> .
__label__1	A parting blessing for our child. ” “ I send it to her by you .
__label__1	‘ Dear , dear , ’ said <NAME> , taking up the defence , ‘ what is the use of asking all that now , especially when you know you had set your covetous old heart on a richer son-in-law , and are so wild and fierce besides , that everybody is afraid of you , except me ?
__label__1	‘ Oh , you ’ ve woke up , at last , have you ? ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> has received him there these several evenings past to know whether he has anything to report .
__label__1	In the negro car belonging to the train in which we made this journey , were a mother and her children who had just been purchased ; the husband and father being left behind with their old owner .
__label__0	A moment after all four of the party had disappeared in the woods , and the elephant was bearing them away at a rapid pace .
__label__0	`` Thirty-seven minutes six seconds past ten . ''
__label__1	Is it unusual , unsophisticated , primitive ? ’ ‘ It ’ s delightful indeed , sir , ’ replied the lawyer .
__label__0	In the meanwhile night came on , and it was already dark when the settlers reached <NAME> , the place where they had discovered the precious chest .
__label__0	His attitude could only signify one of two things -- either my proposal had been communicated to him , and he did not intend to accede to it ; or neither Hurliguerly nor <NAME> had spoken to him since the previous day .
__label__0	The mouth of the <NAME> was reached on the 18th July , when the <NAME> , afraid of meeting their enemies , the <NAME> , at once returned to <NAME> , whilst the Canadians scarcely dared to launch their frail boats on the angry sea .
__label__0	Then he went to <NAME> , where the tombs of <NAME> and Esther are found , and by Dabrestan he reached <NAME> , the capital of the kingdom , a city measuring twelve miles in circumference .
__label__0	These suckling-pigs were really delicious , and <NAME> was devouring his share with great gusto , when all at once a cry and an oath escaped him .
__label__1	‘ Does no other profession occur to you , which a young man of your figure and address could take up easily , and see the world to advantage in ? ’ asked the manager .
__label__0	Could a fresh exploration of the mine , undertaken by the engineer , account for such a long absence ?
__label__0	<NAME> describes <NAME> as a man of short stature , about fifty years old , wearing a beard , painted of a most delicate azure blue .
__label__1	She was a formidable style of lady with spectacles , a prominent nose , and a loud voice , who had the effect of wanting a great deal of room .
__label__1	or is there one in both directions ?

__label__0	The guides and porters having distributed the provisions between them , the signal for departure was given , and we set off in the midst of profound darkness , directing ourselves according to the lantern held up at some distance ahead .
__label__1	`` How do you do , sir ?
__label__0	Nothing could be more rudimentary .
__label__1	‘ It is , I suppose , that you have not heard a word of my complaint. ’ ‘ Your complaint , <NAME> ? ’ said Mr Merdle .
__label__1	‘ Now , let me turn this matter over , and consider what I ought to have if I should help you to success. ’ ‘ But don ’ t be hard , ’ cried old <NAME> , raising his hands with an imploring gesture , and speaking , in a tremulous voice .
__label__0	Finally , they introduce a piece of wood , made for the purpose , of the size and shape of the bowl of an ordinary table-spoon .
__label__1	‘ He ’ ll be off if you don ’ t look sharp ! ’ After this , whenever <NAME> dropped a curtsey to <NAME> in the presence of his family , and said in a faltering way , ‘ I beg your pardon , sir , for being troublesome—but—have you had any letter yet about me ? ’ <NAME> would suspend the occupation of the moment , whatever it was , and look for the reply as earnestly as <NAME> did .
__label__0	At the same time , on one of the highest points of the <NAME> , the <NAME> had a gigantic telescope erected , in order that they might be able to follow the course of the projectile through space .
__label__1	We drank the muddy water of this river while we were upon it .
__label__1	How can I get that reading , <NAME> ?
__label__1	“ This , ” said <NAME> , “ is Pip. ” “ This is <NAME> , is it ? ” returned the young lady , who was very pretty and seemed very proud ; “ come in , Pip. ” <NAME> was coming in also , when she stopped him with the gate .

__label__0	From Rome by <NAME> , and <NAME> , then partly inundated , he went to <NAME> , where he seems to have seen nothing but the five hundred Jews living there ; then by <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> Nicholas of <NAME> , and <NAME> , he arrived at <NAME> , having crossed <NAME> and yet found nothing interesting to relate of this splendid country .

__label__0	The sudden transition from a position where all things seemed to smile on me , to that in which I found myself at that moment , weighed on my spirits like a horrible nightmare .

__label__1	So , at six o ’ clock that evening , which was one of the early office evenings , I announced myself as ready , to <NAME> .
__label__0	The green cloth of our tables was suddenly covered with a deluge of quill-pens , to the great injury of one of our servants , who , in trying to remove them , got one under his nail .
__label__1	It was his better nature to be true to her , if it were his worse nature to be wholly selfish .
__label__1	“ If you could n't abear yourself -- ” <NAME> asked me here , as she sat holding my sister 's plate , “ Have you thought about when you 'll show yourself to <NAME> , and your sister and me ?

__label__0	It was the intention of the <NAME> government to lay the country desert before the invaders .
__label__0	What instinct guided this phantom with ease through passages so narrow as to appear to be impracticable ?
__label__1	With the same intention , he drew the key across it , three or four times , before he put it clumsily into the lock , and turned it as heavily as he could .

__label__1	Oh , the solemn woods over which the light and shadow travelled swiftly , as if heavenly wings were sweeping on benignant errands through the summer air ; the smooth green slopes , the glittering water , the garden where the flowers were so symmetrically arranged in clusters of the richest colours , how beautiful they looked !
__label__1	<NAME> for deeper and heavier sorrow was yet to come .

__label__1	But , being what he was -- and is , I hope -- I can ’ t believe it. ’ ‘ Wal ’ r , my lad , ’ inquired the <NAME> , wistfully eyeing him as he pondered and pondered , ‘ what do you make of it , then ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , ’ returned <NAME> , ‘ I don ’ t know what to make of it .
__label__1	But the occasion was no common one , for Rob the <NAME> had certainly never stood in the doorway of <NAME> Cuttle ’ s room before , and in it he stood then , panting at the <NAME> , with a flushed and touzled air of Bed about him , that greatly heightened both his colour and expression .
__label__1	But it was not my time yet , I was glad to tell her , for I should have been vexed to take her away then .
__label__1	This was my homely thought , as I contemplated the box-tree .

__label__0	I saw there in the midst of this fire that burns not the swift and elegant porpoise ( the indefatigable clown of the ocean ) , and some swordfish ten feet long , those prophetic heralds of the hurricane whose formidable sword would now and then strike the glass of the saloon .
__label__0	These were , however , the only results of the mission , which was thwarted by the <NAME> General <NAME> , whose influence was then paramount ; and <NAME> , disheartened by finding all his efforts frustrated , and recognizing that success was hopeless , returned to <NAME> the following year .

__label__1	<NAME> Jarndyce I had perhaps less reason to be surprised than either of my companions , having never yet enjoyed an opportunity of thanking one who had been my benefactor and sole earthly dependence through so many years .
__label__1	I think he must have gone to look for it .
__label__0	Perhaps he , the former convict , still felt himself unworthy to do so !

__label__1	I would n't lend anybody a sixpence. ” “ Rather mean to borrow under those circumstances , I should say. ” “ You should say , ” repeated <NAME> .
__label__1	My aunt had written her one of the odd , abrupt notes -- very little longer than a <NAME> note -- to which her epistolary efforts were usually limited .
__label__1	There was not even a closet in it .
__label__1	She has the most agreeable of faces , -- not absolutely beautiful , but extraordinarily pleasant , -- and is one of the most genial , unaffected , frank , engaging creatures I have ever seen .
__label__1	‘ Very good ; don ’ t forget the bread and butter presently. ’ At this fresh mention of the bread and butter , the five little boys looked very eager , and followed the waiter out , with their eyes ; meanwhile <NAME> tasted the milk and water .

__label__0	The crew was exceedingly demoralized .
__label__0	Up to the morning of the 30th of June there had been nothing particular to distinguish the voyage .
__label__0	In others , obstructed by rocks , there was only a narrow path , in which two persons could not walk abreast .
__label__0	But scarcely had he done so , when <NAME> noticed that his waist was encompassed by an enormous girdle that bulged out to a very extraordinary extent .
__label__0	When the atmosphere was calm , the low temperature was easily borne , but when the wind blew , the poor settlers , insufficiently clothed , felt it severely .
__label__1	A person may tell a person to dive off a bridge head foremost into five-and-forty feet of water , <NAME> , but a person may be very far from diving. ’ ‘ There now , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ you ’ re angry because you ’ re a good little thing , and fond of <NAME> ; and yet you turn round on me , because there ’ s nobody else. ’ ‘ It ’ s very easy for some to keep their tempers , and be soft-spoken , <NAME> , ’ returned <NAME> , slightly mollified , ‘ when their child ’ s made as much of as a prince , and is petted and patted till it wishes its friends further , but when a sweet young pretty innocent , that never ought to have a cross word spoken to or of it , is rundown , the case is very different indeed .

__label__1	The men -- the second of whom was a dark , bilious subject , in a jacket , close shaved , and with a black head of hair close cropped -- had completed their preparation of the table , and were standing looking at it .
__label__1	To a poor one most . ''
__label__0	Either because there are people who are so wanting in politeness as to call it “ <NAME> , ” or for some more meteorological reason , <NAME> is subject to violent tempests .

__label__1	The shop was close and hot .
__label__1	A waiter showed me into the coffee-room ; and a chambermaid introduced me to my small bedchamber , which smelt like a hackney-coach , and was shut up like a family vault .
__label__1	‘ It strikes you in the same light , ’ said <NAME> , with perfect calmness .
__label__1	‘ I shall never , <NAME> , ’ said Mrs. Micawber , ‘ revert to the period when <NAME> was in difficulties , without thinking of you .

__label__1	You are , we will say in round numbers , twenty years of age ; <NAME> is , we will say in round numbers , fifty .
__label__0	Indeed , the whole world in his eyes was condensed into this old clockmaker 's house , and he passed all his time near the young girl , when he left her father 's workshop , after his work was over .
__label__0	This attention paid , the travelers watched the earth and the moon attentively .

__label__0	It took <NAME> very little time to reach the point of observation , and we all waited below , how impatiently may be imagined .
__label__0	They left off rowing , lest they should get farther from the ship .
__label__0	The precipice was perpendicular as a wall , its topmost height crowned with the same conglomerate of crystallized lamellae that had all along been so pronounced a feature .
__label__0	Here is the book I use daily , to practice myself in the difficulties of the <NAME> language .

__label__0	For four days , till the 3rd of February , the <NAME> scoured the <NAME> of <NAME> , at various speeds and at various depths .
__label__0	While he was speaking I had caught sight of the portrait of my cousin <NAME> , and was wondering when she would return .
__label__1	That woman , <NAME> , is always the same -- always the same bustling , lively , active , saving creetur that you see her now. ’ <NAME> sighed involuntarily at the thought of the agreeable domestic prospect thus opened to him ; but <NAME> was , fortunately , too much occupied with his own reflections to perceive it .
__label__1	I sat looking at <NAME> for some time , in a reverie on this supposititious case : whether , if she were employed to lose me like the boy in the fairy tale , I should be able to track my way home again by the buttons she would shed .
__label__1	‘ Does he deny that he did ?
__label__0	However , the only way to know was to examine the bottle , and <NAME> set to work without further delay , so carefully and minutely , that he might have been taken for a coroner making an inquest .
__label__0	“ Humph ! ” said <NAME> , “ these pirates !
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> , breaking off , has made a noiseless descent upon mademoiselle and laid his heavy hand upon her shoulder .
__label__1	<NAME> went to bed again , and thought , and thought , and thought it over and over and over , and could make nothing of it .

__label__0	The rockets had primarily been placed to check the fall of the projectile upon the moon , and now they were going to employ them for a directly contrary purpose .
__label__0	[ Illustration ] The sea appeared perfectly covered as far as eye could reach .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> being by this time deep in the bill of costs , took no notice whatever of <NAME> , but went scratching on , with a noisy pen , scoring down the figures with evident delight , and working like a steam-engine .
__label__0	`` You are right , '' said the doctor .
__label__0	`` Well , '' said <NAME> , `` I should have liked to be there ; it must have been funny enough . ''
__label__0	Looking back to all that has occurred to me since that eventful day , I am scarcely able to believe in the reality of my adventures .
__label__1	The same consideration for their years and weakness is expressed in their very seats , which are perfect curiosities , and look like articles of furniture for a pauper doll ’ s-house .
__label__1	The cause of this is not to be found in any local superstition that attaches to the Precincts—albeit a mysterious lady , with a child in her arms and a rope dangling from her neck , has been seen flitting about there by sundry witnesses as intangible as herself—but it is to be sought in the innate shrinking of dust with the breath of life in it from dust out of which the breath of life has passed ; also , in the widely diffused , and almost as widely unacknowledged , reflection : ‘ If the dead do , under any circumstances , become visible to the living , these are such likely surroundings for the purpose that I , the living , will get out of them as soon as I can. ’ <NAME> , when <NAME> and <NAME> pause to glance around them , before descending into the crypt by a small side door , of which the latter has a key , the whole expanse of moonlight in their view is utterly deserted .
__label__1	‘ And how , ’ said <NAME> , when he had grasped his followers by the hand , and exchanged warm salutations of welcome -- ‘ how is <NAME> ? ’ <NAME> , to whom the question was more peculiarly addressed , made no reply .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , <NAME> ; don ’ t you like him now ? ’ Without returning any direct reply , <NAME> , all at once , fell into a paroxysm of spiteful tears , and exclaimed that she was a wretched , neglected , miserable castaway .
__label__1	There is much shaking of hands , and much bowing , and a great desire on the part of each young gentleman to take <NAME> down in <NAME> Dombey ’ s good graces ; and then , Mr Toots having bestowed a chuckle on his old desk , <NAME> and he withdraw with <NAME> and <NAME> ; and <NAME> is heard to observe behind them as he comes out last , and shuts the door , ‘ Gentlemen , we will now resume our studies , ’ For that and little else is what the <NAME> hears the sea say , or has heard it saying all his life .
__label__1	A negro lad , startled from his sleep by the officer ’ s voice—he knows it well—but comforted by his assurance that he has not come on business , officiously bestirs himself to light a candle .
__label__0	I then thought of quitting my room .

__label__0	Giving but few minutes to my meals , but a few hours to sleep , indifferent to either rain or sunshine , I did not leave the poop of the vessel .

__label__1	Do n't keep him too warm , ma'am ; but be careful that you do n't let him be too cold ; will you have the goodness ? '
__label__1	Now , your inclinations are to be consulted .
__label__0	One could almost fancy it the march of an army .
__label__1	They were in high good-humour ; and one of them , a little , weazen , hump-backed man , began to dance .
__label__0	`` I dare say , '' replied <NAME> ; `` but if the earth had been _full_ , the moon would have been _new_ ; that is to say , invisible , because of the rays of the sun .
__label__0	The only quadrupeds the country produced were goats and half-wild pigs .
__label__0	Were his two companions thinking of their trip through those unknown regions ?
__label__1	The housemaids had been bribed with various fragments of riband , and sundry pairs of shoes more or less down at heel , to make no mention of crumbs in the beds ; the airiest costumes had been worn on these festive occasions ; and the daring <NAME> had even surprised the company with a sprightly solo on the comb-and-curlpaper , until suffocated in her own pillow by two flowing-haired executioners .
__label__0	“ Meantime , ” continued <NAME> , “ either the river will get lower , and allow us to ford it , or we shall have time to make a canoe .
__label__0	<NAME> highly serious , long-continued discussions , in which no one would give in .
__label__0	Thus , a pilot in the service of the King of <NAME> , while sailing at 1350 miles ' distance from <NAME> , the south-western point of the <NAME> province of <NAME> , met with a piece of wood ornamented with ancient sculptures , which he considered must have come from a continent not far off .
__label__1	Because you have got a daughter .
__label__0	At what velocity was the Projectile now moving ?
__label__1	I saw my brother near the school , sir , ’ to <NAME> , ‘ because it ’ s easier for me to go there , than for him to come here .
__label__0	`` More than two thousand <NAME> leagues , '' exclaimed <NAME> .
__label__1	There ; let go ; be sensible .
__label__1	As far as in me lies , I will deserve it , and if I have wavered in my bounden duty to them before , I am now determined to discharge it rigidly , and to put further delays and temptations beyond my reach. ’ ‘ Before you say another word , dear <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , turning pale , ‘ you must hear what I have to tell you .
__label__1	‘ We had better , ’ said this subordinate minister of justice , ‘ get to the office while there ’ s a magistrate sitting .
__label__1	‘ Why then , it ’ s done. ’ Kit looked at him in some confusion .
__label__0	However , by the shape of her boats <NAME> and <NAME> believed that the brig was of <NAME> build .
__label__1	The water in the professional pipkin having been made to boil , in course of time , by various little shovelfuls of coal , which <NAME> took out of a practicable window-seat , labelled ‘ <NAME> , ’ <NAME> adulterated his brandy ; and the conversation was becoming general , when it was interrupted by the entrance into the shop of a boy , in a sober gray livery and a gold- laced hat , with a small covered basket under his arm , whom <NAME> immediately hailed with , ‘ <NAME> , you vagabond , come here. ’ The boy presented himself accordingly .
__label__0	At Murzuk they were harassed by annoyances similar to those which had paralyzed <NAME> ; in their case , however , circumstances and character were alike different , and without allowing themselves to be blinded by the compliments paid them by the sultan , the <NAME> , who were thoroughly in earnest , demanded the necessary escort for the journey to <NAME> .
__label__1	A woman , probably of not less than two-and-twenty , she might have been passed in the street for little more than half that age .
__label__0	Their motto was ever `` onward ! ''
__label__1	Kindly explain ; or if not kindly , justly. ’ ‘ Oh , sir ! ’ said <NAME> , raising her eyes to his , after a little struggle to forbear , ‘ is it generous and honourable to use the power here which your favour with Mr and <NAME> and your ability in your place give you , against me ? ’ ‘ Against you ? ’ ‘ Is it generous and honourable to form a plan for gradually bringing their influence to bear upon a suit which I have shown you that I do not like , and which I tell you that I utterly reject ? ’ The late <NAME> could have borne a good deal , but he would have been cut to the heart by such a suspicion as this .
__label__1	The snow had covered our late footprints ; my new track was the only one to be seen ; and even that began to die away ( it snowed so fast ) as I looked back over my shoulder .
__label__0	With rigid fingers she pointed to the following words traced upon it during the night : “ <NAME> , you have robbed me of the last vein in our old pit .
__label__0	The prisoners naturally gave no credence to these lying declarations , but profiting by the comparative liberty which was henceforth granted to them , they cleverly succeeded in conveying to <NAME> some valuable information upon the position and strength of the town .
__label__0	Besides , this was , in a way , the betrothal dinner of <NAME> and the charming <NAME> -- that of <NAME> and <NAME> had taken place at the fazenda of <NAME> several weeks before .
__label__1	At the sight of him laughing in that absurd way , the dolls ’ dressmaker laughed very heartily indeed .
__label__0	`` Have you nothing to say either , <NAME> ? ''
__label__0	[ Illustration ] A few days before their departure , June 20th , the ice had so many free passages , that they were able to make a trial trip on board of the new launch as far as <NAME> .
__label__0	Kai-Koumou treated him with a certain tone of respect , and by the fineness of his tattoo , it was easy to perceive that Kara-Tete held a lofty position in the tribe , but a keen observer would have guessed the feeling of rivalry that existed between these two chiefs .
__label__0	“ Very likely he may have met with the fate of <NAME> ’ s abstracted astronomer , who found himself at the bottom of a well. ” “ Ay ; but where _is_ that well ? ” demanded the captain .
__label__0	The reporter 's reasoning was just , and every one felt it to be so .
__label__1	In short , it is such an admirable thing that <NAME> ca n't forget it ; but at meals for days afterwards , even among her countrywomen and others attached in like capacity to the troop of visitors , relapses into silent enjoyment of the joke -- an enjoyment expressed , in her own convivial manner , by an additional tightness of face , thin elongation of compressed lips , and sidewise look , which intense appreciation of humour is frequently reflected in my <NAME> 's mirrors when my Lady is not among them .
__label__1	You have been in every prospect I have ever seen since , -- on the river , on the sails of the ships , on the marshes , in the clouds , in the light , in the darkness , in the wind , in the woods , in the sea , in the streets .
__label__1	But it has not been quite so often remarked that this power ( fallible , like every other human attribute ) is for the most part absolutely incapable of self-revision ; and that when it has delivered an adverse opinion which by all human lights is subsequently proved to have failed , it is undistinguishable from prejudice , in respect of its determination not to be corrected .
__label__0	The natives called it the tablecloth , probably from some such reason as the dwellers in the Cape of <NAME> call their mountain <NAME> , and their roads <NAME> .
__label__0	The rooms had now only to be furnished , and this would be work for the long winter days .
__label__0	No traces were found on the western coast , although they were carefully sought for .
__label__0	At <NAME> , <NAME> was relieved of half his property by the envoys of the king , under pretence of making him pay for the right to pass through his kingdom .
__label__0	So passed the winter months , June , July , and August .
__label__1	‘ Why ? ’ The child sat on the table looking at him , with a curious expression of suppressed emotion in his face , and beating one hand proudly on his knee as if he had the rising tears beneath it , and crushed them .
__label__1	‘ I should hope so , ’ returned Mr Toots .
__label__1	‘ Oh come away ! ’ said <NAME> , ‘ they are quarrelling .
__label__0	At the same instant the snow-house was shaken as if by an earthquake .
__label__1	‘ Hold up ! ’ said the stout old <NAME> , as <NAME> dived head foremost into his capacious waistcoat .
__label__1	Thank you , <NAME> , I do n't know but what I WILL take a marrow pudding . ''
__label__1	I know from terrible warnings I have noted in myself that my reason will not long remain unimpaired , but I solemnly declare that I am at this time in the possession of my right mind -- that my memory is exact and circumstantial -- and that I write the truth as I shall answer for these my last recorded words , whether they be ever read by men or not , at the <NAME> Judgment-seat .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> game -- well played -- some strokes admirable , ’ said the stranger , as both sides crowded into the tent , at the conclusion of the game .
__label__0	Suddenly my clothes were seized by a strong hand , and I felt myself quickly drawn up to the surface of the sea ; and I heard , yes , I heard these words pronounced in my ear : `` If master would be so good as to lean on my shoulder , master would swim with much greater ease . ''
__label__1	‘ <NAME> ’ was evidently the idol of her life ; never to be shaken on his pedestal by any commotion ; always to be believed in , and done homage to with the whole faith of her heart , come what might .
__label__0	But <NAME> persisted in keeping absolute silence .
__label__1	When the chambermaid asked him just now if he should want a bed , sir , he first made faces at her , and then wanted to kiss her. ’ ‘ Beg him to walk this way , ’ said the single gentleman .
__label__0	<NAME> , not being able to get around this obstacle , determined to attack it boldly in front .
__label__0	The <NAME> measured but fifty fathoms in width at this point , and the natives were in great excitement , rushing to and fro , tumultuously , in the villages that lined the banks of the stream .
__label__1	`` We hope you will think better of it , <NAME> , '' said I , `` and we shall come to see you again , trusting to find you more reasonable . ''
__label__1	‘ It is a tale of life , and life is made up of such sorrows , ’ returned the other , courteously , but in a grave and sad tone of voice .
__label__1	‘ A mistake , a mistake ! ’ Turning away , he sat down with a heavy sigh in the faded chair again .
__label__1	‘ You ’ re coming to yourself again now. ’ ‘ -- As a matter of business , ’ pursued <NAME> , speaking slowly and firmly , as a man who has made up his mind to say no more , ‘ because I thought she might make some impression on the silly youth you have taken in hand and are lending good help to ruin , I knew -- knowing him -- that it would be long before he outraged her girl ’ s feelings , and that unless he offended by mere puppyism and emptiness , he would , with a little management , respect the sex and conduct even of his usurer ’ s niece .
__label__1	A hurry and contradiction pervaded all his thoughts .
__label__0	“ And what will it be , then ? ” “ We shall find proofs of malevolence , but not the malefactor. ” “ But he exists !
__label__1	‘ Dear me ! ’ ‘ I little thought the first time I saw him , <NAME> , ’ says <NAME> , pleased with the attorney ’ s strong interest in his favourite , ‘ that I should come to be as intimate with him as I am now. ’ ‘ Ah ! ’ rejoins Mr <NAME> , brim-full of moral precepts and love of virtue .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> comes all this way to beg for money , and you , who are so grand and great , having got it , are going to let him have it , as a great favour and obligation. ’ <NAME> turned up the old face for a moment , in which there was a sharp understanding of the reference conveyed in these words : but it was a young and childish face immediately afterwards , when he slipped down from his father ’ s knee , and ran to tell Florence not to cry any more , for he was going to let young Gay have the money .
__label__1	<NAME> ’ ee ! ’ ‘ Mrs Meagles and your daughter -- ? ’ ‘ <NAME> as well as possible , ’ said Mr Meagles .
__label__1	She had no fear that she would live through another night .
__label__1	‘ Have you seen <NAME> , my dear , ’ he said , ‘ since she left your house ? ’ ‘ No , sir ! ’ replied <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ What would it be right to do ? ’ ‘ I think , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ that the honourable course to take , would be to write to those two ladies .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> , I believed you true , and I was blest in so believing , but now I mourn that e ’ er I knew , a girl so fair yet so deceiving. ’ Miss <NAME> bit her lip and affected to look with great interest after Mr Cheggs , who was quaffing lemonade in the distance .
__label__0	The multitude , half deceived , showed not a little ill-humour .
__label__1	‘ I dare say I didn ’ t make myself very clear , ’ he went on , ‘ nor you neither .
__label__1	‘ More shame for you , ’ retorted the nurse .
__label__0	The silk was doubled , at the upper extremity of the oval , where most of the strain would come .
__label__0	O Barbican , how you must blush for us !
__label__0	<NAME> indigenous plants were discovered , and those fit for immediate use , contributed to vary the vegetable stores of <NAME> .
__label__0	They were reduced to mere conjecture .
__label__1	I wrote to <NAME> as soon as <NAME> and I were engaged .
__label__0	The engineer then made known to his companions the proposal which had been made to him , and it was agreed that they should build a wooden house at the corral , which they would make as comfortable as possible .
__label__0	Moreover , we had no cause to fear that the light would fail us during the sunny hours of the night .
__label__1	So the doctor , breathing low , and closely watching , asks himself .
__label__1	What is that ? ’ returns <NAME> .
__label__0	And , lastly , he made an appeal to `` all the living energies of the nation ! ''
__label__1	And this is natural , and impossible to be reasoned against , because , after his long separation from human life , and his great suffering , any event will appear to him more probable in the contemplation , than the being restored to liberty and his fellow-creatures .
__label__1	I ’ m a going to seek my niece through the wureld .
__label__1	A part of this door was of glass unprotected by any shutter , which I did not observe at first , for all was very dark and silent within , and I was anxious ( as indeed the child was also ) for an answer to our summons .
__label__0	Passepartout even felt a strong desire to grasp his ally , <NAME> , by the hand .
__label__1	Secondly , we owe the Veneerings a grudge , and we owe all other people the grudge of wishing them to be taken in , as we ourselves have been taken in .
__label__0	And do you think now that she could undertake a voyage of some extent ? ” “ What voyage , <NAME> ? ” “ One to <NAME> , for instance. ” “ My friend , ” replied Harding , “ I think that in any pressing emergency we need not hesitate to trust ourselves to the ‘ Bonadventure ’ even for a longer voyage ; but you know I should see you set off to <NAME> with great uneasiness , since nothing obliges you to go there. ” “ One likes to know one ’ s neighbors , ” returned the sailor , who was obstinate in his idea .
__label__1	`` I am not quite myself , '' returns the trooper ; `` I have been a little put out , Mrs .
__label__0	To the north of this kingdom extended that country which the <NAME> traveller calls <NAME> , and which is situated to the north of <NAME> proper .
__label__1	But it was very pleasant to see the pride with which he hoisted it up and made it fast ; smiling as he did so , with a relish and not merely mechanically .
__label__1	Are you going to return there ? ''
__label__0	I had nothing to do but to lie down again , and this I did .
__label__0	`` The outlying islands with which the <NAME> abounds between the tropics , '' he says , `` are on a level with the waves in the low parts , and raised only a rood or two above them in the others .
__label__1	When that was done , a moment ’ s whisper despatched <NAME> to despatch somebody else to fill the basket again ; which soon came back replenished with new stores , from which a present provision of cooling drink and jelly , and a prospective supply of roast chicken and wine and water , were the first extracts .
__label__1	what have I done to be looked at , like that ? ’ ‘ My lad , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ don ’ t you sing out afore you ’ re hurt .
__label__1	There will not be the smallest impropriety -- <NAME> , sir , is the very soul of honour .
__label__0	But at length he managed to react against all these sufferings ; and when evening came again , he resolved to pass the night on the shores of <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Open the door , and let me take my dear friend <NAME> to my arms !
__label__0	This would be our <NAME> .
__label__1	thieves ! ’ shrieked the usurer , starting up and folding his book to his breast .
__label__1	Mr and <NAME> , sitting side by side , with <NAME> withdrawn to an immeasurable distance , fell to discussing how they could best find their orphan .
__label__0	It had landed on a sand-bank , twenty-five fathoms from the coast .
__label__0	And now , even although the industrious colonists had provided themselves with tools , these treasures would find their use .
__label__1	He threw himself back in his easy-chair , wrapped in contemplations of his future greatness .
__label__0	Now they slid over the slippery rock ; then they struggled to their feet and scrambled on .
__label__1	The world did have it that she showed a passion for attending my sales , when they took place on half holidays , or in vacation time .
__label__1	‘ I make false statements , it appears ?
__label__1	Everybody knows me here. ’ ‘ What will she do there ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
__label__0	He thought of the lad standing there , and of his companions and those left behind , whom he loved so dearly .
__label__0	It was a meadow land , dotted here and there with clumps of trees , and watered by a little stream , which sprung from the slopes which closed it in on one side .
__label__0	He made a sign to the officer to follow him , and the two walked away at a rapid pace .
__label__1	He told with perfect truth how it had come of a little contraband trading , and how he had in time been released from prison , and how he had gone away from those antecedents .
__label__1	That certainly IS the way I do it. ’ ‘ And when all the rest of us are discussing our ventures , none of us ever know what a single venture of yours is ! ’ ‘ And none of you ever will from me , <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> , with another internal chuckle ; ‘ that certainly IS the way I do it. ’ ‘ Why of course it is , I know ! ’ rejoined <NAME> , with a flourish of frankness , and a laugh , and stretching out his hands as if to show the universe a remarkable man in <NAME> .
__label__1	I will make no such pretence to you .
__label__1	And <NAME> , having his back to the door , would have known nothing of their apparition even then , but for seeing his Uncle spring out of his own chair , and nearly tumble over another .
__label__1	‘ Parents who never showed their love , complain of want of natural affection in their children ; children who never showed their duty , complain of want of natural feeling in their parents ; law-makers who find both so miserable that their affections have never had enough of life ’ s sun to develop them , are loud in their moralisings over parents and children too , and cry that the very ties of nature are disregarded .
__label__0	The mystery was about to be unveiled .
__label__1	I shall be very glad tomorrow morning to think that I saw you again , but now I almost wish you hadn ’ t come. ’ <NAME> was about to return a cheerful reply , when he was greatly disconcerted by the sudden apparition of Mrs. Grudden , who it seemed had declined to attend the supper in order that she might rise earlier in the morning , and who now burst out of an adjoining bedroom , habited in very extraordinary white robes ; and throwing her arms about his neck , hugged him with great affection .
__label__1	After a careful consideration of these , and an elaborate estimate of his resources , he had come to the conclusion to select that sum which represented the amount with compound interest to two years , fifteen calendar months , and fourteen days , from that date .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , you are inconsiderate : you expect too much of your sister .
__label__1	He was a snub-nosed , flat-browed , common-faced boy enough ; and as dirty a juvenile as one would wish to see ; but he had about him all the airs and manners of a man .
__label__0	resumed my companion , whose face became more and more animated .
__label__1	I travelled heer , and I travelled theer , but I found no Em ’ ly , and I travelled home. ’ ‘ How long ago ? ’ I asked .
__label__1	My poor little wife was in such affliction when she thought I should be annoyed , and in such a state of joy when she found I was not , that the discomfiture I had subdued , very soon vanished , and we passed a happy evening ; Dora sitting with her arm on my chair while <NAME> and I discussed a glass of wine , and taking every opportunity of whispering in my ear that it was so good of me not to be a cruel , cross old boy .
__label__0	That news must go into to-day 's issue . ''
__label__1	’ Tis for that. ’ ‘ Well , well , ’ said he .
__label__0	“ Yes , it was I , ” rejoined <NAME> in a firm tone , though somewhat agitated voice .
__label__1	<NAME> , whose top waistcoat-button might have been somewhere on a level with the crown of <NAME> 's head , rubbed his eyes with the inside of his wrists while this commiseration was bestowed upon him , and performed some affecting tears and sniffs .
__label__0	At length a time came when despite the enormous thickness and weight of the upper crust , the mechanical forces of the combustible gases below became so great , that they actually upheaved the weighty back and made for themselves huge and gigantic shafts .
__label__0	The only trees were either stunted cedars , so far apart , as to be often denominated <NAME> ; and , besides wormwood , the only plant was the sage plant , about two feet high , gray , dry , crisp , and emitting a sharp pungent odor by no means pleasant .
__label__1	The look-out was kept , long after all was still again and the two steamers were gone ; but everybody knew that it was hopeless now .
__label__0	Both these alternatives were equally impossible , as in either case the caravan would have to travel among fanatic tribes .
__label__1	‘ Let the laws be. ’ ‘ Yes , ’ he said , with a slow nod or two .
__label__0	which are based upon the laws of mechanics , and it seems difficult to me to refute them .
__label__0	We have , therefore , twenty-six minutes more to remain on earth . ''
__label__0	The papers resumed their discussion about the wager ; all those who had laid bets , for or against him , revived their interest , as if by magic ; the `` <NAME> bonds '' again became negotiable , and many new wagers were made .
__label__1	‘ There ’ s a vooden leg in number six ; there ’ s a pair of <NAME> in thirteen ; there ’ s two pair of halves in the commercial ; there ’ s these here painted tops in the snuggery inside the bar ; and five more tops in the coffee-room. ’ ‘ Nothing more ? ’ said the little man .
__label__0	Neither Cyrus Harding nor his companions ventured to offer any observation to <NAME> .
__label__1	I have to begin the world . ''
__label__0	Some days afterwards <NAME> da <NAME> and two other captains , jealous of the successes of <NAME> , and trampling in the dust every sentiment of honour , discipline , and patriotism , left him to go to the <NAME> ; while <NAME> was obliged by this cowardly desertion to withdraw without being able even to guard the fortress which he had been at so much pains to construct .
__label__1	Very little of the beef was done either ; and the ham ( which was also from the German-sausage shop round the corner ) was in a similar predicament .
__label__1	So the doctors ordered him off .
__label__1	<NAME> looks at him inquiringly , repeating the name .
__label__0	I tried mechanically to open the valve , but the unknown cut the cord several feet above my head .
__label__1	When <NAME> drew in his head again , his countenance was smiling and placid ; and , walking quietly back into the office , he declared that he had now removed a great weight from his mind , and that he felt perfectly comfortable and happy .
__label__0	But , inasmuch as it is equally necessary to take into account the deviation which the rotary motion of the earth will impart to the shot , and as the shot can not reach the moon until after a deviation equal to 16 radii of the earth , which , calculated upon the moon 's orbit , are equal to about eleven degrees , it becomes necessary to add these eleven degrees to those which express the retardation of the moon just mentioned : that is to say , in round numbers , about sixty-four degrees .

__label__1	Will you take a drop o ’ somethin ’ this mornin ’ , <NAME> ? ’ <NAME> acquiesced in this agreeable proposal ; and having deposited his book in his coat pocket , accompanied <NAME> to the tap , where they were soon occupied in discussing an exhilarating compound , formed by mixing together , in a pewter vessel , certain quantities of <NAME> <NAME> and the fragrant essence of the clove .
__label__0	The elephant halted , lifted his trunk , and resumed his run toward the wood with all his speed ; he shook his huge head , and the blood began to gush from his wounds .

__label__0	The sun 's bright rays glanced through the trees .
__label__1	‘ I have a letter to present , and inquiries to make , you know .
__label__0	“ Yes , my boy , ” replied the engineer , “ that may have been the case .
__label__1	“ My father , ” said <NAME> , softly laying her hand on his .
__label__1	'She has formed no other attachment ? '
__label__1	‘ Remember that this is <NAME> ’ s stupendous collection of upwards of One <NAME> , and that it is the only collection in the world ; all others being imposters and deceptions .

__label__1	Will you come ? ’ Florence put her arm through his ; and confiding her father to the black-eyed Mrs Toots , who sat as brisk and smart at her work as black-eyed woman could , accompanied her husband downstairs .
__label__1	Mr Quilp could scarcely be said to be of any particular trade or calling , though his pursuits were diversified and his occupations numerous .
__label__0	To my great surprise , it showed a depth of more than 180 fathoms .
__label__0	“ Huzza ! ” roared <NAME> , as the balloon -- thanks to its ascensional force -- shot up higher into the sky , with increased rapidity .
__label__0	Dr <NAME> , '' answered <NAME> , `` we shall walk under the shade of the trees and sha n't even see the sun ! ''
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> and his companions ran up to them .
__label__1	At five , another bell rings , and the stewardess reappears with another dish of potatoes—boiled this time—and store of hot meat of various kinds : not forgetting the roast pig , to be taken medicinally .
__label__0	At intervals solid pedestals rise from this wall , bearing every token of having served to support colossal statues of <NAME> , the barking <NAME> , or the <NAME> star .
__label__0	The <NAME> lay in a little harbor sheltered from the north , east , and south winds , about a cable-length from the shore .
__label__1	‘ That was before you began to lose your recollection , you know , ’ said <NAME> quietly .
__label__0	And the sailor , seizing <NAME> by the arm , dragged him behind a rock , just as a magnificent animal showed itself at the entrance of the cavern .
__label__1	‘ Well , well , ’ said brother <NAME> , ‘ go into that room , my dear -- that door yonder -- and see if there ’ s not a letter for you from her .
__label__1	‘ Is it nothing to see those placards about ?
__label__1	I have stood between your father and mother for a number of years .
__label__1	‘ She is in <NAME> , with all her family , <NAME> , ’ he said , when the dreaded lady was occupied again .
__label__0	But I will advance still farther on the road of inquiry and deduction , and I dare venture to say that this human sample or specimen belongs to the <NAME> family , which spread over the world from <NAME> to the uttermost limits of western <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ This was the period , about three months after she had commenced , that the first report of her case was made , in which it was stated that “ she has just learned the manual alphabet , as used by the deaf mutes , and it is a subject of delight and wonder to see how rapidly , correctly , and eagerly , she goes on with her labours .
__label__0	I replied only by a shake of my head , which <NAME> could not fail to understand .
__label__0	The current was now carrying us in the direction of the pole !
__label__1	“ Why , what 'll you do with a half-holiday , if you get it ? ” said <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> , who had by this time no breath of his own to spare , hurried along without asking any more questions ; and they soon , in their impatience , burst in at a little door and came into a clean parlour full of children .
__label__1	I ’ d go anywhere about the house the same as ever .
__label__0	“ It is not impossible that our care will have an effect upon him , for it is solitude that has made him what he is , and from this time forward he will be no longer alone. ” “ The poor man must no doubt have been in this state for a long time , ” said <NAME> .
__label__0	Judging from the outline of the shore , a large sea , at that time wholly frozen , stretched out farther than eye could reach in the west ; on the east it was limited by a rounded coast , cut into by numerous estuaries , and rising suddenly about two hundred yards from the shore ; it formed a large bay , full of dangerous rocks , on which the <NAME> had been wrecked ; far off on the land rose a mountain , which the doctor conjectured to be about three thousand feet high .
__label__1	‘ Have you the face to utter the word to me ? ’ ‘ The face , too ! ’ replied <NAME> , staring at him with cold scorn .
__label__1	‘ It isn ’ t funny at all , ’ repeated <NAME> .

__label__1	They can examine for themselves whether there has been anything in the public career of that country since , at home or abroad , which suggests that those influences and tendencies really did exist .
__label__1	`` Now , I wonder who it can be about ? ''
__label__1	'Oh no , I wo n't hurt him , ' replied the officer , tearing his jacket half off his back , in proof thereof .
__label__0	The < i > <NAME> < /i > kept off the coast , steering to the westward .
__label__1	At the upper end of the room , were a couple of boys , one of them very tall and the other very short , both dressed as sailors -- or at least as theatrical sailors , with belts , buckles , pigtails , and pistols complete -- fighting what is called in play-bills a terrific combat , with two of those short broad-swords with basket hilts which are commonly used at our minor theatres .
__label__1	I took that opportunity , with my voice sticking in my throat , and my sight failing as I uttered the words , to express my hope that <NAME> was quite well ; to which <NAME> replied , with no more emotion than if he had been speaking of an ordinary human being , that he was much obliged to me , and she was very well .

__label__0	The strength of the current prevented the _Endeavour_ from touching either shore of the channel , which , however , was but a mile in width , and extremely unequal in depth , giving now thirty fathoms , now only seven of foul bottom . ''
__label__0	But nothing showed that the banks of the stream had been recently frequented -- nothing announced either the presence or the proximity of the convicts .
__label__1	I know no station which is rendered more endurable to the person in it , or more safe to the person out of it , by having ignorance for its associate .
__label__0	At that time exit seemed closed , and <NAME> was obliged to stop and anchor to an iceberg ; but steam was kept up all night .
__label__0	It is necessary here to mention a proposal of J. T. <NAME> 's .
__label__0	That friend , crushed , stifled , bruised by the dreadful arms of a poulp , pounded by his iron jaws , would not rest with his comrades in the peaceful coral cemetery !
__label__0	“ Well , his crime did not do him much good , for suspicion soon pointed toward him .

__label__0	Whatever it may be to which the document refers , I have not yet given up discovering the cipher .
__label__1	They suggested one distinct idea to her , for she said with her placid smile , and shaking her head , `` My good <NAME> , at half the cost , this weak child might have been equipped for <NAME> ! ''
__label__1	Why does he move so softly to-night ?
__label__1	There an ’ t another chap in the school but that boy as would have died exactly at the end of the quarter : taking it out of me to the very last , and then carrying his spite to the utmost extremity .
__label__1	‘ No harm in that sir , ’ rejoined <NAME> , applying his eye to the other sleeve , and speaking in the voice of one who was contemplating an immense extent of prospect .
__label__0	The tempest had been as brief as terrific .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> 's imprudences are beginning . ''
__label__0	Here I weigh more , because I am nearer the centre of attraction ; and on another planet I should weigh more or less according to the mass of the planet . ''
__label__0	The problem before us is how to communicate an initial force of 12,000 yards per second to a shell of 108 inches in diameter , weighing 20,000 pounds .
__label__1	<NAME> , however , that the projected dinner at home was put off , <NAME> thought it likely that she would go out in the evening to fulfil the engagement she had spoken of ; and resolved to try and meet her , then , upon the staircase .
__label__0	<NAME> , her feet riveted to the floor , stood breathless and motionless .
__label__1	‘ Can you go round when you get back , and tell <NAME> that you saw me safely off , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ It shall be done , Miss. ’ ‘ With my love , please , Joe. ’ ‘ Yes , Miss—and I wouldn ’ t mind having it myself ! ’ But <NAME> did not articulate the last clause ; only thought it .
__label__0	The result , therefore , of this discovery ( a result long repudiated by the <NAME> , both father and son ) , was that the earth was considerably flattened at the poles .
__label__1	WE all dined together that day ; and a rather formidable party we were : no fewer than eighty-six strong .
__label__1	The <NAME> , left to himself , resumed his perusal of the news as if nothing unusual or unexpected had taken place , and went reading on with the greatest assiduity .
__label__1	I terrified them from the spot , and since that day have prowled by night -- the only period at which I can revisit the earth -- about the scenes of my long-protracted misery .
__label__0	The first words he uttered were : `` <NAME> , your orders ? ''
__label__1	‘ “ But I am not joking ; I was never farther from it , ” remonstrated the baron .
__label__0	“ Yes , a gold-mine , ” said the doctor , quietly .
__label__0	`` Come , <NAME> , '' said he : `` come , my girl !
__label__0	It was a star without scintillating rays .
__label__1	‘ And calculated on it , ’ she rejoined , ‘ and so pursued me .
__label__0	Thoughts of this kind continued to occupy the minds of our travellers even for some time after the little spark of light had been extinguished in the black gloom .
__label__0	The men are rather less ill-favoured , though they are stunted and lean , and covered with ulcers and leprosy scars .
__label__1	‘ I don ’ t rightly know which is your brother , miss , ’ replied <NAME> .
__label__0	The canoe was carried to the beach and laid on the sand before <NAME> , and the rising tide floated it .
__label__0	<NAME> water freezes only at a lower temperature than fresh ; the course of the <NAME> was therefore unimpeded by ice , but it could not be concealed that there was the greatest necessity to maintain the utmost possible speed .
__label__1	' I wonder they do n't murder you !
__label__1	What do you think of my being , at the present moment , under special orders to squeeze you dry on Monday ? ’ The reply was given in a murmur of ‘ Shame ! ’ and ‘ <NAME> ! ’ ‘ <NAME> ? ’ snorted <NAME> .
__label__1	`` Yes , we thought you 'd come to us this morning , but we turned out early and left <NAME> , the best of boys , to mind his sisters and came to you instead -- as you see !

__label__0	At the outset it is quite possible that material wants and the very necessities of existence may engross the poor shipwrecked fellow , just snatched from the waves ; but afterward , when he feels himself alone , far from his fellow men , without any hope of seeing country and friends again , what must he think , what must he suffer ?
__label__0	One flake arose into the air under the form of vapor from some river in <NAME> , it helped make a cloud , and finally came here to be condensed ; it is not impossible that we who drink it may be quenching our thirst at the rivers of our own country . ''
__label__0	<NAME> Harding then busied himself in drawing the plan of the vessel and making the model .
__label__1	Being somewhat negligently braced , however , and , moreover , but imperfectly buttoned , they fell in a series of not the most graceful folds over a pair of shoes sufficiently down at heel to display a pair of very soiled white stockings .
__label__1	What a strange rest and pause in my life there seems to be -- and in all life , within doors and without -- when I sit in the quiet , shaded , orderly room , with the blue eyes of my child-wife turned towards me , and her little fingers twining round my hand !
__label__0	The one starts among the upper layers of the hydrogen gas , the other amid the lower layers .
__label__1	They ’ ll be good shots one of these days .
__label__1	And with that , he darted in again with one jerk and clapped the little door to , like a figure in a <NAME> clock when the hour strikes .
__label__0	They had no news from <NAME> , but were not uneasy on that account .
__label__1	<NAME> back , look back , and see if we are pursued !
__label__0	You have tried it already ?
__label__1	Taking the table to represent the path of virtue , I am justified in stating that during the whole time of the <NAME> 's reading , <NAME> 's arm was straying from the path of virtue and being recalled to it by <NAME> .
__label__1	He withdraws his hand and falls to looking at the sleet and snow again until they seem , by being long looked at , to fall so thick and fast that he is obliged to close his eyes for a minute on the giddy whirl of white flakes and icy blots .
__label__1	Well-inquired. ’ ‘ But I do say , ’ proceeded <NAME> , ‘ that I am taken from among my trophies of anatomy , am called upon to exchange my human warious for mere coal-ashes warious , and nothing comes of it .
__label__1	Now , <NAME> -- after you , ma ’ am. ’ Mrs <NAME> hesitated , but Mr <NAME> insisted .
__label__0	Many had chilblains on the hands and feet .
__label__0	“ The car ! ” was his reply ; “ we can cling to the network .
__label__0	After having walked for a quarter of an hour , the sailor and the boy arrived at the angle which the river made in turning towards the left .
__label__1	<NAME> out of his house .
__label__0	Their hair was black and not woolly , and was cut short ; some wore it plaited , some curled .
__label__1	After whom I remember nothing but an average equality of failure .
__label__1	I may not myself , ’ said Mr Sparkler manfully , ‘ be up to the mark on some other subjects at a short notice , and I am aware that if you were to poll Society the general opinion would be that I am not ; but on the subject of Amy I AM up to the mark ! ’ Mr <NAME> kissed her , in witness thereof .
__label__1	‘ It is my fate , ’ said <NAME> , unfeignedly sobbing , but doing even that , with a shadow of the old expression of doing something genteel ; ‘ it is my fate , gentlemen , that the finer feelings of our nature have become reproaches to me .
__label__0	The Indians who , assembled in arms on the surrounding mountains , had reckoned upon falling on the conqueror , had need instead to fly in all haste .
__label__0	He took a dozen of the whale ’ s bones , cut them into six equal parts , and sharpened their ends .
__label__0	<NAME> did not insist , and was fain to resign himself to await the arrival of the important document ; but he was determined not to lose sight of the mysterious rogue as long as he stayed in <NAME> .
__label__1	I shall never allow people to talk before me about wastefulness and profligacy , and so forth , in connexion with that life , any more. ’ ‘ And you will be right , ’ said Mrs. Steerforth .
__label__1	Go along with you ! ’ But the inflexible <NAME> , merely honouring <NAME> with another look , remained .
__label__0	As soon as he had collected the needful troops , he marched towards <NAME> .
__label__0	I wanted to get up , but a heavy hand held me down in my bunk !
__label__0	From the pendant lobe of his ears hung earrings of green jade , and round his neck a quivering necklace of “ pounamous , ” a kind of jade stone sacred among the <NAME> .
__label__0	`` Over my shirt '' he relates , `` I wore an old kambas , or dressing-gown , and above that a woman 's ragged chemise ; my head was covered with rags , and my feet with old sandals .
__label__1	The light in the passage was obscured for a moment , and my aunt came out .
__label__0	One maintained the hyperbola , the other the parabola .
__label__1	You have been a pleasant room to me , dear room .
__label__1	‘ But no doubt you are a good deal changed since then , sir ? ’ ‘ Probably , ’ said I .
__label__1	In short , they suffered so many disappointments , that they began to think it would be necessary to build a palatial residence .
__label__0	The ceremony was over , and the torches alone lighted up the plateau , which a few instants before had been so brilliantly illuminated .
__label__0	<NAME> came on , bringing with it refreshing coolness after the heat of the day .
__label__1	And what these charred and blackened walls we stand before ?
__label__1	`` I must beg you , my Lady , '' he says while doing so , `` to remain a few moments , for this individual of whom I speak arrived this evening shortly before dinner and requested in a very becoming note '' -- <NAME> , with his habitual regard to truth , dwells upon it -- '' I am bound to say , in a very becoming and well-expressed note , the favour of a short interview with yourself and MYself on the subject of this young girl .
__label__0	“ Perhaps , ” said <NAME> , while he and <NAME> were working , “ our companions have found a superior place to ours. ” “ Very likely , ” replied the seaman ; “ but , as we don ’ t know , we must work all the same .
__label__1	I had not meant that , and was rather taken by surprise .
__label__1	Look sharp with the light , or I shall knock my brains out against something in this confounded hole . '
__label__0	As these thoughts were crossing his mind , a harsh bark was heard to the left of the footpath , and a jackal was seen emerging from a large grove of lentisks .
__label__1	We were left to ourselves now , and looked very blank , I recollect , on one another .
__label__0	`` Give it , boatswain , '' I replied , `` at the risk of my not adopting it if I do n't agree with it . ''
__label__1	‘ This is more than _I_ knew of him , ’ she said , giving it back .
__label__0	Do not let us enter upon them .
__label__0	His hard eyes darted a piercing glance at the three men , who walked near him , but nothing denoted that he recollected being their fellow , or at least having been so .
__label__1	what dreadful pain it is !
__label__1	But the scientific gentleman could not rest under the idea of the ingenious treatise he had projected being lost to the world , which must inevitably be the case if the speculation of the ingenious <NAME> were not stifled in its birth .
__label__1	Do you hear ? ’ <NAME> gave a dogged kind of nod to express an affirmative reply , and , leaving the room for a few seconds , returned with his hat .
__label__0	The doctor lowered the balloon in order to get a better look at this cavalcade of natives ; but , as the balloon grew larger to their eyes , they began to show symptoms of intense affright , and at length made off in different directions as fast as their legs and those of their horses could carry them .
__label__1	It was so like handing green meat into the cage of a dull imprisoned bird , and <NAME> had so evidently brought the little basket as a handful of fresh relief from the stale hot paving-stones and bricks of the jail , that <NAME> said , with a smile , ‘ It was very kind of you to think of putting this between the wires ; but I can not even get this down to-day. ’ As if the difficulty were contagious , <NAME> soon pushed away his own plate , and fell to folding the cabbage-leaf that had contained the ham .
__label__1	He is the best judge of his own responsibility ; he acts upon his responsibility .
__label__0	She saw him in the invested town , far from those he loved , but , as she never doubted , struggling against the invaders with all the spirit of his patriotism .
__label__0	“ And now , gentlemen , we have to see what these coins weigh here upon Gallia. ” He suspended the money bag to the hook ; the needle oscillated , and stopped .
__label__0	“ Gentlemen , ” said <NAME> , “ if you like , I am ready to follow you to the landing-place. ” “ Come , then , ” answered <NAME> .
__label__0	The want of water forced them to land several times , and they perceived that the savages were most pleased with mirrors , bells , knives , and sheets of paper .
__label__0	It was in the section included between this range and the <NAME> that the <NAME> engineers found the most formidable difficulties in laying the road , and that the government granted a subsidy of forty-eight thousand dollars per mile , instead of sixteen thousand allowed for the work done on the plains .
__label__0	`` Did you not remark that the colour of the sea changed , grew white like milk , and that its surface became ruffled around your boat ? ''
__label__1	‘ Is there nothing else , <NAME> ? ’ I said .
__label__1	Upon the way , the guard and I were formally introduced to each other ( as we usually were on such occasions ) , and exchanged a variety of small-talk .
__label__1	The slight devices with which she cheated herself into the show of a belief that they would soon be reunited -- the little preparations for his speedy return , the setting aside of his chair and his books -- these , and the solemn prayer at night for one dear prisoner especially , among the many unhappy souls in prison and the shadow of death -- were almost the only outspoken reliefs of her heavy mind .
__label__1	I , too , whose duty , and pride , and pleasure , <NAME> , it is to have other claims upon me which I will never forget ; and who have the means of a comfortable and happy life already , and have no right to look beyond it !
__label__0	At five o'clock in the morning the anchor was weighed .
__label__1	I had never been told where it was .
__label__0	<NAME> dismounted , and his escort cleared a large circle round him .
__label__1	Log of the <NAME> states , that a breeze springing up in the night , the wreck was seen no more .
__label__1	A sunburnt , quick , lithe , little man , though rather thickset .
__label__0	And , sure enough , in the distance the long sails of a mill appeared , apparently about three miles off .
__label__0	160 Search for lands discovered by the <NAME> -- Stay in <NAME> 's land -- <NAME> 's <NAME> -- <NAME> -- <NAME> fêtes at the <NAME> .
__label__0	Finding the winds favourable , he decided not to remain in <NAME> <NAME> at this advanced season of the year , but immediately to double <NAME> , in the hope of avoiding a possible delay that would have exposed his ships to injury and his crew to useless fatigue .
__label__1	Her very step was different and new to him , Mr <NAME> thought , as his eyes followed her to the door .
__label__0	When men have worked together , they must never be stranger to each other again .
__label__1	It is naturally painful to us ; for we can ’ t like you , you know , <NAME> , as well as we could wish. ’ She touched the child upon a tender point .
__label__0	<NAME> hastened the fitting out of the ship with all his energy , all the more because , according to his opinion , <NAME> had not perhaps made every effort possible to find the castaways , although he was excusable from the responsibility which weighed upon him as captain .
__label__0	Words are impotent to relate such wonders !
__label__1	There is a rude means of washing , a table , and a bedstead .
__label__1	When there came to be but two sisters left at home , the daring mind of <NAME> on the next of these occasions scaled the height of wondering with droll vexation ‘ what on earth Pa ever could have seen in <NAME> , to induce him to make such a little fool of himself as to ask her to have him. ’ The revolving year now bringing the day round in its orderly sequence , <NAME> arrived in the <NAME> chariot to assist at the celebration .
__label__1	The stranger walked boldly up to , and returned with , the master of the ceremonies ; a little introductory pantomime ; and the stranger and Mrs. <NAME> took their places in a quadrille .
__label__0	The <NAME> sank to the breast in a crevasse , and we found to our horror that we were walking on a bridge of frozen snow , for a little in advance of us there were some holes through which we could see the light .
__label__1	They always went on agen me about the Devil .
__label__1	I suppose sense in certain quarters ; you suppose mincing bread-and-butter nonsense .
__label__0	`` But not by a single ship , '' said <NAME> .
__label__1	As you , of course , have not forgotten that he did. ’ She watched him still attentively .
__label__0	A black coat or the waistcoat of an <NAME> uniform was the only garment worn by some , whilst others contented themselves with a jacket , a shirt , or a pair of trousers .
__label__0	This project , which appeared to rest upon solid foundations , could not fail to please a young minister .
__label__1	‘ The sisters saluted the holy man with becoming reverence , and the eldest motioned him to a mossy seat beside them .
__label__0	`` I conclude that we have twenty-six minutes left , '' replied <NAME> .
__label__1	Their goings-on had been going on for some time .
__label__0	The advertisement , it will have been noticed , assumed the principle that regions not known geographically and belonging to nobody in particular belonged to the world at large .
__label__1	‘ Then what did you say “ nothing ” for , sir ? ’ In default of a better answer to this question , the little boy screwed a couple of knuckles into each of his eyes and began to cry , wherefore Mr Squeers knocked him off the trunk with a blow on one side of the face , and knocked him on again with a blow on the other .
__label__0	They paused a moment to enable us to examine the bark , the hammer , and the beam which served them for a table .
__label__1	‘ I have a duty to discharge ; and , either here , or in the room from which we have just now come , at whatever risk or hazard to <NAME> , I must beseech you to contemplate again the fearful course to which you have been impelled. ’ ‘ What course is this you speak of , and impelled by whom , sir ? ’ demanded the young lady , with an effort to speak proudly .
__label__1	Whosoever has observed that sedate and clerical bird , the rook , may perhaps have noticed that when he wings his way homeward towards nightfall , in a sedate and clerical company , two rooks will suddenly detach themselves from the rest , will retrace their flight for some distance , and will there poise and linger ; conveying to mere men the fancy that it is of some occult importance to the body politic , that this artful couple should pretend to have renounced connection with it .
__label__1	At last I ran away myself , whenever I saw an emissary of the police approaching with some new intelligence ; and lived a stealthy life until he was tried and ordered to be transported .
__label__0	They consisted of notes of captains who had passed through the Straits of <NAME> , stating the time of their visits , the incidents of their passage , with advice to those who should come after them , and letters for <NAME> or the <NAME> .
__label__0	They were not injured in the slightest respect , thanks to the means taken to counteract the shock .
__label__1	None of these sports or exercises being pursued in <NAME> 's Shooting <NAME> to-night , which is so devoid of company that a little grotesque man with a large head has it all to himself and lies asleep upon the floor .
__label__1	They were now by an avenue of trees .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , ’ blurted out Mr Toots , one day all at once , as his manner was , ‘ do you think you could think favourably of that proposition of mine , and give me the pleasure of your acquaintance ? ’ ‘ Why , I tell you what it is , my lad , ’ replied the <NAME> , who had at length concluded on a course of action ; ‘ I ’ ve been turning that there , over. ’ ‘ Captain Gills , it ’ s very kind of you , ’ retorted Mr Toots .
__label__0	`` Yes , of course , '' <NAME> used to say , `` and more too , if need be .
__label__1	‘ Now , it ’ s a remarkable fact , sir , that it cut that man deeper , to know that his daughter knew of his being goosed , than to go through with it. ’ ‘ Good ! ’ interrupted <NAME> .
__label__1	He looked at the pretty figure bending down over the paper and saying , ‘ Where am I to go , pa ?
__label__0	It was a dark night , with a strong breeze and a rough sea , nothing being visible but the occasional fires on shore , with here and there a lighthouse .
__label__1	I say , sir -- ’ Mr <NAME> affected to start , and looked smilingly round .
__label__1	That he was a muscular man , strong on his legs , and that he was browned and hardened by exposure to weather .
__label__0	He said to his nephew <NAME> , `` I give you full authority in everything to do whatever you think best , and I believe you will do all for my honour and to my advantage .
__label__0	On the evening before , <NAME> , who had not yet given his answer to <NAME> , came to his house .
__label__1	‘ The tale told itself at once : some scattered garments lay on the beach ; a human head was just visible above the waves at a little distance from the shore ; and an old man , wringing his hands in agony , was running to and fro , shrieking for assistance .
__label__1	Is that it , my dear ? '
__label__1	When he stopped for drink , he moved this muffler with his left hand , only while he poured his liquor in with his right ; as soon as that was done , he muffled again .
__label__1	<NAME> ho ! ’ ‘ What ’ s the matter ? ’ demanded <NAME> , looking sleepily up .
__label__0	<NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> remained silent in the midst of the darkness .
__label__0	But to what phenomenon do we owe this alteration in the needle ? ''
__label__1	The poor little old man knew some pale and vapid little songs , long out of date , about <NAME> , and <NAME> , and <NAME> being wounded by the son of <NAME> ; and for Mrs Plornish there was no such music at the Opera as the small internal flutterings and chirpings wherein he would discharge himself of these ditties , like a weak , little , broken barrel-organ , ground by a baby .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> ’ t be alarmed , ’ said <NAME> , coming from his easel behind the door .
__label__1	I call upon you , sir , therefore , to pint out the good .
__label__1	'No , no , mistress , ' replied the old woman , 'nobody can ; she 's far beyond the reach of help .
__label__0	Their hair is originally black , but they are in the habit of tinting it with powder , so that white , red , and blue hair abounds , which produces a singular effect .
__label__0	In the meantime the greater part of the prisoners were passing before the <NAME> , and as they passed each was obliged to prostrate himself , with his forehead in the dust , in token of servitude .
__label__1	‘ Not a button , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> gently detained his sister , who made an effort to retire ; and asked , ‘ Why not ? ’ ‘ I could not sleep , ’ said <NAME> , grasping the hand which his friend extended to him .
__label__1	As I knew it would be miserable at home , and as the nights were dark and the way was dreary , and almost any companionship on the road was better than none , I made no great resistance ; consequently , we turned into <NAME> 's just as the street and the shops were lighting up .
__label__1	I couldn ’ t bear to have anything of that sort going on with myself .
__label__1	It is the <NAME> of <NAME> for the State , in which silence is strictly maintained , but where the prisoners have the comfort and mental relief of seeing each other , and of working together .
__label__1	`` You would like some hot water , would n't you ? ''
__label__0	This was not surprising , as the whole pile of <NAME> would soon burn out and could only ward off the attacks of wild beasts for a brief interval .
__label__0	Just as the reading of the proclamation by the head of the police came to an end , an idea darted instinctively into the mind of <NAME> .
__label__1	Terrified by this alarming spectacle , <NAME> placed another shilling in each hand ; at the same time appealing to the law in flurried accents , and recounting her luggage this time with the two gentlemen in , who caused the total to come out complicated .
__label__1	She was so preoccupied that at first she did not know me , though she sat looking at me with that curious , <NAME> , far-off look of hers .
__label__1	Indeed , except in respect of staring about him ( a branch of the public service to which the pictorial cherub is much addicted ) , this domestic cherub discharged as many odd functions as his prototype ; with the difference , say , that he performed with a blacking-brush on the family ’ s boots , instead of performing on enormous wind instruments and double-basses , and that he conducted himself with cheerful alacrity to much useful purpose , instead of foreshortening himself in the air with the vaguest intentions .
__label__1	Even when we were groping among <NAME> 's stock of boots for our hats , I felt that the right twin was on his way back ; and we had not gone half a dozen yards down <NAME> in the <NAME> direction , before I found that I was walking arm in arm with the right twin , and that the wrong twin had evaporated into the evening air .
__label__1	So I shall have time gradually to make her familiar with my hopes , as opportunities offer .
__label__0	`` I thoroughly allow that the celebrated <NAME> wrote the lines , but only , I believe , as a kind of mystification , '' was my answer .
__label__0	It would have been to expose herself to a categorical refusal .
__label__1	Why , if I was to say to them , “ I ’ m told your friend <NAME> is a base wretch , ” they ’ d laugh at me. ’ ‘ They will laugh no more at us , I take it , ’ said <NAME> , advancing .
__label__1	All this was gall and wormwood to the heart of <NAME> ; and when groups of children bounded out of the houses , tripped across the road , and were met , before they could knock at the opposite door , by half a dozen curly-headed little rascals who crowded round them as they flocked upstairs to spend the evening in their Christmas games , <NAME> smiled grimly , and clutched the handle of his spade with a firmer grasp , as he thought of measles , scarlet fever , thrush , whooping-cough , and a good many other sources of consolation besides .
__label__0	Something has happened ; <NAME> and I can not both be mad ! ” The orderly , meantime , surveyed his master with the greatest equanimity ; no phenomenon , however extraordinary , would have drawn from him a single exclamation of surprise .
__label__0	The moon , then in her last quarter , was beginning to rise above the horizon .
__label__1	She makes <NAME> money , sir , and never stands <NAME> ’ orth Rum. ’ ‘ Get on , ’ rejoined <NAME> , tapping his palsied head with the fire-shovel , as it sank on his breast .
__label__0	It afforded me great amusement to gaze on their variegated ribbon-like endless lengths .
__label__0	The document contained a hundred lines , which were divided into half a dozen paragraphs .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> ’ whatever , <NAME> , ’ retorted <NAME> ; ‘ I ’ m afeered the little box must be chock full o ’ your own as it is. ’ This speech was accompanied with such a very expressive look at that particular portion of <NAME> ’ s attire , by the appearance of which the skill of laundresses in getting up gentlemen ’ s linen is generally tested , that he was fain to turn upon his heel , and , for the present at any rate , to give up all design on <NAME> ’ s purse and wardrobe .
__label__0	If one or more malevolent beings were concealed in the coal-pit , and there concocted mischief , <NAME> surely could have warned them of it , yet she said nothing .
__label__0	He was crossing in an oblique direction .
__label__0	<NAME> found that he could not avoid telling his master what had occurred , and , with hanging head , he was turning towards the car , when the engineer , a true <NAME> , named <NAME> called out , `` Gentlemen , perhaps there is a way , after all , to get over . ''
__label__0	The sun had set the evening before in a red mist , in the midst of the phosphorescent scintillations of the ocean .
__label__0	And still the jangada continued its journey down the river .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> , stunned and paralysed by the awful event which had so suddenly overthrown their schemes ( it would not otherwise , perhaps , have made much impression on them ) , and carried away by the extraordinary energy and precipitation of <NAME> , which bore down all before him , looked on at these proceedings like men in a dream or trance .
__label__0	“ A <NAME> spy , ” answered <NAME> .
__label__1	I do what I can for them. ’ ‘ You do what you can for them ! ’ repeated <NAME> , walking her on very fast .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> ! ’ cried <NAME> , recoiling in amazement .
__label__0	The title of <NAME> was conferred on him , and an important command in the <NAME> was entrusted to him .
__label__0	<NAME> was swept off by a wave , and thrown among the breakers , where he lost consciousness .
__label__1	Do you know , that I observe a great change in one of this family -- a very extraordinary change ? ’ ‘ In whom ? ’ asked <NAME> , anxiously .
__label__1	This was first put into my head by his seeing a shoot that had come up in the night , and saying , “ What , <NAME> ?
__label__0	There is no need for dwelling on this period , which extends from the year 1828 to the year 1839 .
__label__1	‘ What is it , <NAME> ? ’ <NAME> was the questioner , and put an arm round the poor baby as he made a struggle .
__label__0	`` Have you formed any plan , <NAME> ? ''
__label__0	<NAME> was soon back , bringing no answer except that the professor had told him that “ to-day was the 125th of June , and that to-morrow would be the 1st of July. ” Consequently , <NAME> and the count took it for granted that <NAME> declined their invitation .
__label__1	‘ You needn ’ t make yourself uncomfortable , ’ remarked his wife , laughing heartily .
__label__0	He felt along the vertical sides of the shaft with his hand , and some few minutes later , he would go on again in the following style : `` This is gneiss .
__label__0	In spite of this anti-climax , <NAME> 's companions could hardly consider his utterings either as ridiculous or over enthusiastic .
__label__0	But his good humour soon reconciled them to his appearance , and they became accustomed to look upon him without fear or displeasure .
__label__0	The prison was still a prison -- the prisoners , prisoners .
__label__1	The street was a sharp descent and was crooked too , and the man ( who although not drunk had the air of being flushed with some strong drink ) went down it so fast that <NAME> lost him as he looked at him .
__label__1	The post of honour and the post of shame , the general ’ s station and the drummer ’ s , a peer ’ s statue in Westminster Abbey and a seaman ’ s hammock in the bosom of the deep , the mitre and the workhouse , the woolsack and the gallows , the throne and the guillotine -- the travellers to all are on the great high road , but it has wonderful divergencies , and only Time shall show us whither each traveller is bound .
__label__1	<NAME> ! ’ These expressions , delivered in a most boisterous tone , and accompanied with loud peals of laughter , roused <NAME> from one of those sound slumbers which , lasting in reality some half-hour , seem to the sleeper to have been protracted for three weeks or a month .
__label__1	And more than that , ” says he , “ I can make a weal a beef- steak , or a beef-steak a kidney , or any one on ‘ em a mutton , at a minute ’ s notice , just as the market changes , and appetites wary ! ” ’ ‘ He must have been a very ingenious young man , that , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , with a slight shudder .
__label__1	He determined to see her , cost what it might ; but here an insurmountable objection presented itself , for whether the explanatory ‘ over that way , ’ and ‘ down there , ’ of <NAME> , meant three miles off , or thirty , or three hundred , he could in no wise guess .
__label__1	Ah Kit , my dear fellow , gentleman in my profession have such painful duties to perform sometimes , that you needn ’ t envy us -- you needn ’ t indeed ! ’ ‘ I don ’ t , sir , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ though it isn ’ t for the like of me to judge. ’ ‘ Our only consolation , <NAME> , ’ pursued the lawyer , looking at him in a sort of pensive abstraction , ‘ is , that although we can not turn away the wind , we can soften it ; we can temper it , if I may say so , to the shorn lambs. ’ ‘ Shorn indeed ! ’ thought <NAME> .
__label__1	There he found <NAME> looking out of window , in a state of mind so disconsolate , that he was already half-disposed to ‘ go in ’ for something else .
__label__1	<NAME> opinion hailed this doctrine with a howl of wild applause , and set the prisoners free , to walk the city , men of mark , and influence , and station , as they had been before .
__label__0	Well , it so happened that the <NAME> got a seat that left him with his back turned toward the lake .
__label__1	I could not but observe that he had been peeling the lemons with his own clasp-knife , which , as became the knife of a practical settler , was about a foot long ; and which he wiped , not wholly without ostentation , on the sleeve of his coat .
__label__1	Her lips quivered and opened , in spite of her utmost efforts to keep them still .
__label__1	He has a most romantic heart , Mrs. Nickleby , as indeed -- hem -- as indeed all our family have , and the disappointment was a dreadful blow .
__label__0	Therefore , I must find her again at any cost .
__label__1	He will take something to eat and drink , I dare say , on your invitation , while you are getting your bonnet on. ’ Mr Inspector declined eating , but assented to the proposal of a glass of brandy and water .
__label__1	You charge again ’ me that <NAME> got lost sight of , and was no more thought of .
__label__1	<NAME> looked at me a little frightened .
__label__0	The ambassador and his suite were therefore to go up by water as far as <NAME> , about a dozen miles from <NAME> , and thence proceed by land to <NAME> , where the emperor awaited them .
__label__1	‘ Well , well , ’ said the clergyman .
__label__1	Still , at the same time , I wouldn ’ t commit such an injustice for the world .
__label__0	When he returned to <NAME> , by means of the original as well as of some supplementary notes , he wrote a longer narrative of the expedition , at the request of <NAME> .
__label__1	When they were alone again , the <NAME> insisted on her eating a slice of dry toast , and drinking a glass of spiced negus ( which he made to perfection ) ; and , encouraging her with every kind word and inconsequential quotation he could possibly think of , led her upstairs to her bedroom .
__label__1	He quickened his pace ; but before he reached her , she turned her head .
__label__1	On inquiring what this appellation might be supposed to signify , I was given to understand that whatever was unintelligible would be certainly transcendental .
__label__0	“ The heart has not been touched ; if it had been , <NAME> would be dead ! ” “ Dead ! ” exclaimed <NAME> , with a groan .
__label__1	Next day , fifteen prisoners were put to the bar before <NAME> 's name was called .
__label__0	We must think of the present .
__label__0	Upon the morning of the 6th , after three days devoted to tacking about and reconnoitring the coast in search of a roadstead , <NAME> decided to cast anchor in the bay he had seen the first day of his arrival .
__label__0	But <NAME> did not find his provisions sufficient .
__label__1	And as to the brim of his hat , it ’ s narrow .
__label__1	`` Well , well , my dear , '' said <NAME> , `` we wo n't go into that now .
__label__0	Without saying anything to the captains of his fleet , who , without doubt , would have rebelled at the idea of attacking so strong a town , and the capital of a powerful empire , <NAME> gave orders to double <NAME> , and the fleet soon entered the <NAME> of <NAME> , the door of the <NAME> , from whence was seen rising in all its magnificence a busy town built upon a rocky island , provided with formidable artillery , and protected by an army amounting to not less than from fifteen to twenty thousand men , while its harbour enclosed a fleet more numerous than could have been suspected at first sight .
__label__1	‘ Oh my own pretty darling sweet <NAME> ! ’ cried the <NAME> , running into <NAME> ’ s room , ‘ to think that it should come to this and I should find you here my own dear dove with nobody to wait upon you and no home to call your own but never never will I go away again <NAME> for though I may not gather moss I ’ m not a rolling stone nor is my heart a stone or else it wouldn ’ t bust as it is busting now oh dear oh dear ! ’ Pouring out these words , without the faintest indication of a stop , of any sort , <NAME> , on her knees beside her mistress , hugged her close .
__label__1	Though the fact is , that these fellows , being under orders to cheer most excessively whenever Mr <NAME> ’ s name was mentioned , became so proficient that it always woke ‘ em .
__label__0	We must not omit to mention a most hazardous attempt made in B.C .
__label__1	I ought to have thought of it before. ’ Immediately flying to the bell , and calling for mulled wine as impetuously as if it had been wanted for instant use in the recovery of some person apparently drowned , the single gentleman made <NAME> ’ s mother swallow a bumper of it at such a high temperature that the tears ran down her face , and then hustled her off to the chaise again , where -- not impossibly from the effects of this agreeable sedative -- she soon became insensible to his restlessness , and fell fast asleep .
__label__0	Our party formed quite a procession .
__label__1	You have lived a gentleman ; you will die a gentleman .
__label__0	On the forecastle lay the perfection of a breech-loading gun , very thick at the breech , and very narrow in the bore , the model of which had been in the <NAME> of 1867 .
__label__0	Exhausted by his long march , with nothing to eat but a few dates , obliged to depend on the charity of the <NAME> , who as often as not declined to give him anything , and finding at <NAME> no representative of <NAME> but an old Jew named <NAME> , who acted as <NAME> , and who , being afraid of compromising himself , would not let <NAME> embark on a <NAME> brig bound for <NAME> , -- the traveller eagerly availed himself of a fortunate chance for going to <NAME> .
__label__1	`` The dearest friend I have ! ''
__label__1	And the coach in which we came here being at the door , you ’ ll allow me to hand you down to it , and pack you home to the <NAME> : where the best course for you to pursue , will be to put your feet into the hottest water you can bear , and take a glass of scalding rum and butter after you get into bed. ’ With these words , <NAME> extended his right hand to the weeping lady , and escorted her to the conveyance in question , shedding many plaintive sneezes by the way .
__label__1	‘ It ’ s our parrot , this is. ’ ‘ Mr <NAME> ’ s parrot , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Will you hold your tongue , <NAME> ? ’ returned the goaded Grinder .
__label__0	On returning to the surface , in the half light , he felt a living creature struggling near him .
__label__0	And then came a sandy tract , without any transition , but with the abruptness of change so characteristic of <NAME> scenery .
__label__0	At this moment I heard an accustomed and well-known sound running along the floors of the granite rock -- a kind of dull and sullen roar , like that of a distant waterfall .
__label__0	Yet emigration was even then not sufficiently rapid , and convicts were introduced .
__label__1	`` Now , <NAME> , '' he said to me , `` you wo n't be alarmed whatever comes off , I know .
__label__1	They , on the contrary , are much obliged to him for the pleasure he has given them in his company ; and so they part with many expressions of goodwill on both sides .
__label__0	What profound reflections it suggested to their understandings !
__label__1	Mr <NAME> projected a life of holidays from that time forth ; for , as he regularly informed <NAME> every day , it was his ‘ last half ’ at <NAME> Blimber ’ s , and he was going to begin to come into his property directly .
__label__0	<NAME> endeavoured to find it , but , to his great regret , the illness on board the <NAME> shortened his cruise .
__label__1	At parting , my aunt gave me some good advice , and a good many kisses ; and said that as her object was that I should look about me , and should think a little , she would recommend me to stay a few days in <NAME> , if I liked it , either on my way down into <NAME> , or in coming back .
__label__0	`` But what would you do ? ''
__label__1	‘ I have told you once before to-night. ’ ‘ You have done nothing of the sort. ’ ‘ I tell you I have .
__label__0	Raised upon an artificial butt , sixteen or eighteen feet from the ground , the temple was in an oblong form , and was reached by two stone staircases .
__label__0	They are a pastoral people , and have the faults and virtues of their class .
__label__0	such important news , and <NAME> had not known it ; and his rival , who had probably learned it from some inhabitant of <NAME> , had already transmitted it to <NAME> .
__label__0	Following <NAME> ’ s advice , it appeared best to take the road already traversed through the forest , and to return by another route .
__label__0	At the end of the library a large door , also shut , was opened by the engineer .
__label__1	I actually thought more than once that he ’ d have sunk under ‘ em ; I did , indeed. ’ Here <NAME> shook his head and paused ; on which , the elder <NAME> , nudging his neighbour , as begging him to mark the attorney ’ s high connections , asked whether the duties in question produced any permanent ill effects on the constitution of his noble friend .
__label__0	It did not take more than a few days to perform this work , and indeed as soon as the machine had been commenced , <NAME> left his companions to follow the trade of wiredrawers , and occupied himself with manufacturing his battery .
__label__0	In fact , what could be more tantalizing ?
__label__0	It is probable that at the point of equal attraction , its conical cap will be directed rigidly toward the moon ; at that moment we may hope that its speed will be _nil_ ; then will be the moment to act , and with the influence of our rockets we may perhaps provoke a fall directly on the surface of the lunar disc . ''
__label__1	She -- have you seen her , <NAME> ? '
__label__1	You know that I came to you , extremely apprehensive , on my dear boy ’ s behalf , of his mad violence .
__label__0	<NAME> seemed only to still exist on the surface of his body , like the last whiffs of smoke about a lamp just extinguished .
__label__1	There were no conspicuous people in it , trading far and wide on rotten banks of religion , patriotism , virtue , honour .
__label__0	He filled it himself , lighted it with a glowing coal , and appeared to be the happiest of quadrumana .
__label__1	‘ For fifteen years , ’ exclaimed <NAME> , sobbing in a most affecting manner , ‘ for fifteen years have I been the credit and ornament of this room and the one upstairs .
__label__1	“ No ; there are only two ; mother and daughter .
__label__1	“ A bad un , I 'll be bound , ” said Mrs. Joe triumphantly , “ or he would n't have given it to the boy !
__label__1	<NAME> ! ” growled <NAME> , “ it 's you I have got a old grudge again , is it , with your shameful impositions upon tradesmen !
__label__1	He was pinched in , and swelled out , and got up , and strapped down , as much as he could possibly bear .
__label__0	If it happened to be so small as to be only capable of holding the members of <NAME> ’ s family , was not the giant raft large enough to receive all those who wished to assist at the ceremony ?
__label__1	You never meet with quadrupeds going up and down walls ; you must not have quadrupeds represented upon walls .
__label__0	They had been so often visited by the <NAME> and <NAME> , that there were no further discoveries to make .
__label__1	‘ About getting that customer that we paid the ten shillings in the pound to the bill- discounter for , on your account -- to get him out of the <NAME> , you know -- about getting him to Demerara. ’ ‘ Oh , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> hastily .
__label__1	But she 's alive , and I know her . ''
__label__0	However , the <NAME> , in the midst of the tempest , confirmed the words of a clever engineer , `` There is no well-constructed hull that can not defy the sea . ''
__label__0	The natives at once decided to harass the wounded in their retreat .
__label__1	<NAME> took a chair at some distance ; then , another chair a little nearer ; then , moved a little nearer still ; then , nearer again , and finally sat himself on the same sofa , and laid his hand on <NAME> ’ s arm .
__label__0	`` Yes , a little , '' growled <NAME> ; `` so little that I have already quite finished breakfast .
__label__1	Now , you know , so very prepossessing in the lady with the veil ! ''
__label__1	‘ Why , what a thing it would be for yourselves and your family , <NAME> and Mrs. Micawber , if you were to emigrate now. ’ ‘ Capital , madam , capital , ’ urged <NAME> , gloomily .
__label__1	‘ Welcome misery , welcome houselessness , welcome hunger , rags , tempest , and beggary !
__label__1	This time , as before , <NAME> turned back along with him .
__label__1	The two children now lay , through the good offices of <NAME> , in one room ; and it was not until the ladies were established at their tea-table that , happening to look towards the little beds , they thought of <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> , therefore , believed in the fidelity of this man and , by his advice , resolved to cross <NAME> , following the thirty-seventh parallel .
__label__1	‘ He hadn ’ t got his card in his pocket. ’ ‘ I object to the introduction o ’ politics , ’ said the mottled-faced gentleman .
__label__1	I told you , you could n't tire me , you know .
__label__1	‘ Believe me ; if you knew all , much needed. ’ ‘ I can believe that , ’ said <NAME> , with a softening glance at the little creature .
__label__1	“ I have never borne to look upon them since , and now I blame myself for my weakness .
__label__1	‘ Well , then , ’ said <NAME> , with some sternness , ‘ wot do you persevere in bein ’ obstinit for , vastin ’ your precious life away , in this here magnified pound ?
__label__1	I believe you are right , ’ said <NAME> , -- ‘ more than a mile off -- not far from the church -- lying partly on the roadside , and partly on the path , upon his face .
__label__1	The bottle-green suit had been brushed , ready for the morrow .
__label__1	That my own artless <NAME> is changed to me !
__label__0	At night the tempest increased in violence .
__label__1	The other lady , who had not spoken yet , said gravely and emphatically , “ Very true ! ” “ Poor soul ! ” <NAME> presently went on ( I knew they had all been looking at me in the mean time ) , “ he is so very strange !
__label__0	For what had she come to look at the shores of <NAME> ?
__label__0	<NAME> made his companions observe that the height of this mountain above the surrounding plain was far from equaling the depth of its crater .
__label__1	replied <NAME> : shuddering as though some deadly chillness were passing over her , while she spoke ; ' I shall be better presently .
__label__1	What IS the move , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Are you almost ready for breakfast , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ You can pour it out .
__label__1	<NAME> will be quite in a state , when she sees the present company ! ’ said <NAME> , setting chairs .
__label__1	Towards evening , the weather turned hazy , with a drizzling rain ; and soon became so thick , that we sailed , as it were , in a cloud .
__label__0	<NAME> made an observation with great exactness , and found they were in latitude 77° 15 ' , and longitude 85° 2 ' .
__label__1	‘ Take that card , my friend. ’ ‘ I think I won ’ t deprive you on it , ’ returned the driver , casting his eyes over it with no great favour , without taking it .
__label__1	I have taken to the sofa with my staylace cut , and have lain there hours insensible , with my head over the side , and my hair all down , and my feet I do n't know where -- ” ( “ Much higher than your head , my love , ” said Mr .
__label__1	In this frame of mind ( expressed , when she had become too resigned for speech , by nods of the head , upliftings of the eyes , and little beginnings of groans , converted , as they attracted attention , into short coughs ) , Mrs. <NAME> remained until <NAME> and <NAME> returned with the object of their solicitude ; when , having by this time asserted her own importance , and becoming besides interested in the trials of one so young and beautiful , she not only displayed the utmost zeal and solicitude , but took great credit to herself for recommending the course of procedure which her son had adopted : frequently declaring , with an expressive look , that it was very fortunate things were AS they were : and hinting , that but for great encouragement and wisdom on her own part , they never could have been brought to that pass .
__label__1	This awful demonstration was headed by that determined woman Mrs MacStinger , who , preserving a countenance of inexorable resolution , and wearing conspicuously attached to her obdurate bosom a stupendous watch and appendages , which the <NAME> recognised at a glance as the property of <NAME> , conducted under her arm no other than that sagacious mariner ; he , with the distraught and melancholy visage of a captive borne into a foreign land , meekly resigning himself to her will .
__label__0	<NAME> was at first restless , but his breathing gradually became more regular , and he was left sleeping quietly .
__label__1	‘ This , however , ’ said Mr Toots , ‘ is not the point .
__label__1	“ <NAME> , ” said his friend , squaring himself at him with a bullying air , as if the fire-grate had been the furnace in which sustained endeavour was forged , and the one delicate thing to be done for the old <NAME> of old <NAME> was to shoulder him into it , “ your way is , and always was , a lame way .
__label__0	What a singular division of the moon 's two hemispheres , joined to one another like man and woman , and forming that sphere of life carried into space !
__label__1	We must guard ourselves from recognizing any positive engagement between <NAME> and our niece , until we have had an opportunity -- ’ ‘ Until YOU have had an opportunity , sister <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> , sir , ’ said the girl .
__label__0	One winter 's night the old servant <NAME> served the supper , which , according to old custom , she and the young mechanic shared with their master .
__label__1	`` And I never saw him ! ''
__label__1	or , ’ said the <NAME> , raising his voice as much as to say , observe the point of this , ‘ is it The <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Ned , ’ said the old man , drawing <NAME> to his side , and taking his arm tenderly through his , ‘ I know .
__label__1	I suppose I expressed it , somehow ; for after she had looked at me attentively for a little while , she appeared to understand , and replied in a low tone : ‘ I know you will do as I ask you , if I tell you I am very earnest in it .
__label__1	You waste a great deal of money -- or what would be a great deal in the pockets of most gentlemen -- in cultivating a kind of society that is useless to me , and , indeed , that upon the whole is disagreeable to me .
__label__1	The recruit was a likely young fellow enough , strongly built and well made , but by no means sober : indeed he had all the air of a man who had been more or less drunk for some days .
__label__0	Between this coast and the <NAME> of <NAME> there is a dangerous gulf , the Gulf of <NAME> , in which a ship can with difficulty resist the currents which flow towards the west with great rapidity .
__label__0	We had already reached the 25th June .
__label__0	Were it not at one of the extremities of the world , it should be visited by every one . ''
__label__0	Besides , according to the calculations of some naturalists , one of these animals only six feet long would have tentacles twenty-seven feet long .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , at length breaking the silence , ‘ you were right , and I was wrong .
__label__1	Her step towards the door brings her front to front with <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> or forty passengers had already descended , amongst them <NAME> Proctor .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> if I can make it out ! ’ said he , staring at them .
__label__0	The <NAME> ’ s Friend. -- The <NAME> of their Friendship. -- <NAME> at London. -- An unexpected but not very consoling Proposal. -- A Proverb by no means cheering. -- A few Names from the <NAME> Martyrology. -- The <NAME> of a Balloon. -- Dr .
__label__1	`` The wards in <NAME> -- Jarndyce of <NAME> -- Fitz-Jarndyce ! ''
__label__1	It was momentary , but the daughter , with a slight look of intelligence , withdrew her eyes from the boy ’ s face , and sat folded in her cloak as before .
__label__0	Therefore the carpenters lost not a moment .
__label__0	`` No , '' replied <NAME> ; `` on the contrary , everything went wonderfully well .
__label__0	The inhabitants , gentle and hospitable , took great pains to furnish the navigators with the provisions they required .
__label__0	Below , it is <NAME> , and takes the name of the <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> income twenty pounds , annual expenditure twenty pounds ought and six , result misery .
__label__1	Some young children sported among the tombs , and hid from each other , with laughing faces .
__label__1	‘ Nothing , I suppose ? ’ said <NAME> , with a diabolical grin .
__label__1	Carrying these with <NAME> ’ s aid , he passed up to his dwelling .
__label__1	And at the same time there emerged from scores of bye-streets , lanes , and nameless turnings , innumerable people , carrying their dinners to the bakers ' shops .
__label__0	The air could not be renewed in the interior of the <NAME> .
__label__1	I have been stinted of education , liberty , money , dress , the very necessaries of life , the commonest pleasures of childhood , the commonest possessions of youth .
__label__1	He was very fond of reading the papers , very fond of making fancy-sketches with a pencil , very fond of nature , very fond of art .
__label__0	But what could these two expect , in this wild region , if it was not to die of exhaustion and famine ?
__label__0	From <NAME> , <NAME> diverged a little to the west , to <NAME> , a large town inhabited by <NAME> and <NAME> , then to <NAME> , a city frequented by caravans trading between <NAME> and <NAME> ; passing by <NAME> , the capital of the province of that name , and by <NAME> , a town whose situation is uncertain , but in a part of the country where chalcedony and jasper abound .
__label__1	Do n't say any more , if you please , <NAME> .
__label__1	The fact is , you ain ’ t enough here , <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Not a bit , ’ returned the <NAME> , kissing his iron hand ; ‘ and afore I begin to be , my Hearts-delight , <NAME> ’ r will have wrote home from the island , or from some port or another , and made all taut and ship-shape. ’ And with regard to old <NAME> , here the <NAME> became solemn , ‘ who I ’ ll stand by , and not desert until death do us part , and when the stormy winds do blow , do blow , do blow -- overhaul the <NAME> , ’ said the Captain parenthetically , ‘ and there you ’ ll find them expressions -- if it would console <NAME> to have the opinion of a seafaring man as has got a mind equal to any undertaking that he puts it alongside of , and as was all but smashed in his ‘ prenticeship , and of which the name is <NAME> , that ‘ ere man shall give him such an opinion in his own parlour as ’ ll stun him .
__label__1	I don ’ t appear in the business , neither do you .
__label__0	The governor excused himself upon the ground of his ignorance of the <NAME> language , and said , that not wishing a cause of misunderstanding to exist , he was quite ready to kill or put out the eyes ( as the envoy pleased ) of the person who had written the letter .
__label__1	She was still ruminating upon his curious behaviour , when the floor of the crazy stairs and landing cracked beneath the tread of the other travellers who were passing to their beds .
__label__1	the whole way , and the rate of travelling upon it is six miles an hour .
__label__1	‘ Which of ‘ em have you got in that lot ? ’ asked Mr Boffin .
__label__1	‘ I am almost afraid to disturb him , ’ said the child timidly .
__label__1	After a while I recognized the familiar way to <NAME> .
__label__0	“ Do you want me to eat with a good appetite ? ” “ It will be doing us all possible honor , <NAME> , ” answered Ford .
__label__0	“ The truth is there ! ” he said .
__label__0	The whole party began to make almost daily visits to the Hive , and frequently proceeded to the shore , where they resumed their skating exercise , rejoicing in their recovered freedom like prisoners liberated from a dungeon .
__label__0	It was to be hoped that a storm would not burst whilst they were among the mountains , for there it would be terrible .
__label__1	‘ But about these boys of yours ; you wanted to speak to me ? ’ ‘ Yes , ’ replied <NAME> .
__label__1	Mr Gowan goes out a good deal among what is considered the best company here -- though he does not look as if he enjoyed it or liked it when he is with it -- and she sometimes accompanies him , but lately she has gone out very little .
__label__0	By a kind of optical illusion it appeared as though the raft was motionless between two moving pathways .
__label__1	Upon that the <NAME> stopped to notice and admire them ; remembered with amazement that he had seen and spoken to them at his friend <NAME> ’ s in <NAME> ’ s <NAME> ; opined that <NAME> was a devilish fine fellow , and his own little friend ; inquired if he remembered <NAME> B. the <NAME> ; and finally , with a sudden recollection of the conventionalities of life , turned and apologised to Mr Dombey .
__label__1	He told us that he held the whole house , but rarely used more of it than we saw .
__label__0	The lift once raised , this sure and comfortable retreat would be safe from any surprise .
__label__1	Constantly exercising an Art which brought him into mechanical harmony with others , and which could not have been pursued unless he and they had been in the nicest mechanical relations and unison , it is curious to consider that the spirit of the man was in moral accordance or interchange with nothing around him .
__label__0	The little procession now crossed the railway some two hundred yards below the bridge , and then resumed their eastward course .
__label__1	<NAME> lives -- that is to say , <NAME> has not yet died -- in a ruinous place known to the like of him by the name of Tom-all-Alone 's .
__label__0	After my fall I lost much blood .
__label__1	The old lady kissed her hand , gave another skip , smirked and sidled down the gallery in a most extraordinary manner , and ambled gracefully into her own bed-chamber .
__label__1	There was a sailor who had been there upwards of eleven years , and who in a few months ’ time would be free .
__label__1	In one line by itself was an announcement of the first night of a new melodrama ; in another line by itself was an announcement of the last six nights of an old one ; a third line was devoted to the re-engagement of the unrivalled <NAME> Knife-swallower , who had kindly suffered himself to be prevailed upon to forego his country engagements for one week longer ; a fourth line announced that <NAME> , having recovered from his late severe indisposition , would have the honour of appearing that evening ; a fifth line said that there were ‘ <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> ! ’ every night ; a sixth , that that was positively the last appearance of <NAME> of <NAME> .
__label__0	Whether these excuses were true or not , <NAME> had to submit .
__label__1	Running on thus , and now holding Oliver from her to mark how he had grown , now clasping him to her and passing her fingers fondly through his hair , the good soul laughed and wept upon his neck by turns .
__label__1	I thought that kind of life was on all hands understood to be -- eh ? ’ ‘ It is education for a very grave profession , if you mean that , <NAME> , ’ Mrs. <NAME> answered with some coldness .
__label__1	You don ’ t consider them intrusive I hope ? ’ said the Secretary with deference .
__label__1	Lately , they very often wouldn ’ t laugh , and he used to come home despairing .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> adopted <NAME> as his son .
__label__1	<NAME> was thus left at leisure to entertain himself with his own thoughts , until they arrived at the drawbridge at <NAME> , when <NAME> pulled up .
__label__0	“ It is a terrible trial they have to bear ! ” “ Yes , ” said <NAME> ; “ excessive grief has produced the same hallucination in both of them , and at the same time. ” “ In both of them ! ” muttered <NAME> ; “ that ’ s strange , and pure science would say inadmissible. ” He leaned over the side of the vessel , and listened attentively , making a sign to the rest to keep still .
__label__0	The three travelers approached the orifice of the enormous cast-iron tube , and a crane let them down to the conical top of the projectile .
__label__0	Harding and his companions mounted on the platform .
__label__1	My Aunt Astonishes Me XXXVII .
__label__0	The <NAME> undertook to pay all the expenses of the expedition on condition that the greater part of the profits should belong to him .
__label__0	Finding it impossible to obtain the number of pigs he required at this port , the captain decided upon visiting the remaining bays of <NAME> , which he found better populated , more fertile , and more picturesque than that of Madre-de-Dios .
__label__1	<NAME> , you are a wag .
__label__1	Turning his eyes towards the door , they encountered the new-comer ; and in him , through his rags and dirt , he recognised the familiar features of <NAME> .
__label__0	Many presents were distributed to those of his cortége who appeared the most influential .
__label__0	perhaps at that very moment the poor fellows were making their last and almost superhuman struggles to burst their watery prison and ascend once more into the cheerful regions of light and air !
__label__1	They straggle about in wrong places , look at wrong things , do n't care for the right things , gape when more rooms are opened , exhibit profound depression of spirits , and are clearly knocked up .
__label__1	<NAME> , all up with <NAME> ! ’ His running on , in this way , had afforded <NAME> an opportunity of recovering his presence of mind , which at once suggested to him the necessity of removing , as far as possible , the schoolmaster ’ s misgivings , and leading him to believe that his safety and best policy lay in the preservation of a rigid silence .
__label__0	They would shave off her hair , feed her on a scanty allowance of rice , treat her with contempt ; she would be looked upon as an unclean creature , and would die in some corner , like a scurvy dog .
__label__1	O yeth , to be thure !
__label__0	There is a constant emission of light from the storm clouds ; the electric matter is incessantly released ; evidently the gaseous principles of the air are out of order ; innumerable columns of water rush up like waterspouts , and fall back upon the surface of the ocean in foam .
__label__1	A man who had been soaked in water , and smothered in mud , and lamed by stones , and cut by flints , and stung by nettles , and torn by briars ; who limped , and shivered , and glared , and growled ; and whose teeth chattered in his head as he seized me by the chin .
__label__1	‘ And I consider that the poetry brings us both in , in a beautiful manner. ’ The effect of the poem on the Secretary being evidently to astonish him , Mr <NAME> was confirmed in his high opinion of it , and was greatly pleased .
__label__1	There seemed to be something very comical in the reputation of <NAME> of <NAME> , for both the gentlemen laughed heartily when he was mentioned , and <NAME> was a good deal amused also .
__label__1	When <NAME> 's nephew laughed in this way : holding his sides , rolling his head , and twisting his face into the most extravagant contortions : <NAME> 's niece , by marriage , laughed as heartily as he .
__label__1	Each doing what she suggested , there was no want of assistance .
__label__0	`` We are no longer , '' he says , `` in the days when navigators in the interests of commerce thought it necessary carefully to conceal their route and their discoveries , to avoid the competition of rival nations .
__label__0	But <NAME> opened his hunting knife , and at the risk of being ripped up himself , sprang at the animal , and plunged it into his heart .
__label__1	‘ Yes , ’ rejoined the one-eyed man .
__label__0	Have you any material proof ? ” “ Perhaps I have , ” answered <NAME> .
__label__0	About ten men mounted the sides of the <NAME> , armed with pickaxes to break the ice around the vessel , which was soon free .
__label__0	It was so far unknown , that it was not even decided whether it formed a part of the southern continent , as <NAME> supposed , when he named it <NAME> .
__label__0	The coast on the eastern side looked like a mass faintly printed upon a damp fog .
__label__0	There was hardly anybody about on shore , and the few people there were were half savage , from whom it was all but impossible to obtain the slightest information .
__label__0	There was good need of this precaution , for so precipitous was the shore that a vessel driven upon it must inevitably have gone to pieces ; it did not offer a single harbor of refuge , but , smooth and perpendicular as the walls of a fortress , it rose to a height of two hundred , and occasionally of three hundred feet .
__label__0	`` Sir , '' replied the <NAME> , `` I am ready to do anything for the general safety . ''
__label__1	<NAME> has been out a dozen times , looking for you , <NAME> .
__label__1	I will remain here , till he come to ask me for it . '
__label__1	I think so , because she beckoned to me to climb up , with quite a new and motherly expression in her face , and put her arm round my neck , and gave me just such a kiss as she might have given to her own boy .
__label__1	‘ Nor pass it over to me ? ’ ‘ That would be the same thing .
__label__1	`` And you , being a good man , can pass it as such , and forgive and pity the dreamer , and be lenient and encouraging when he wakes ? ''
__label__0	His manifestly evil designs called for the utmost vigilance on the part of <NAME> .
__label__0	The latter composed a distinct group ; the sealing-master was their spokesman and exercised a baneful influence over them .
__label__1	He was going to <NAME> and to <NAME> as a surgeon on board ship .
__label__0	However , <NAME> would not give in , and though every instant ’ s delay but increased the danger , the discussion continued .
__label__0	`` Well , <NAME> , we left more than a thousand tons there ; so you can feel easy about that . ''
__label__1	I was afraid to be seen speaking with him , lest it should be thought I did him harm , and tempted him to evil , and corrupted him : or lest I really should .
__label__0	At this moment <NAME> and the guide seized <NAME> , who , in an instant of mad generosity , was about to rush upon the pyre .
__label__0	All those brought by our traveller were quickly bought up .
__label__0	Top and Jup themselves no longer growled round the well or gave any signs of uneasiness .
__label__1	‘ Wery , <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> ; ‘ if ever I wanted anythin ’ o ’ my father , I always asked for it in a wery ‘ spectful and obligin ’ manner .
__label__0	I am , with the rest of the world , ignorant of the motives which induced you to adopt this strange mode of existence , and I can not judge of effects without knowing their causes ; but what I _do_ know is , that a beneficent hand has constantly protected us since our arrival on <NAME> , that we all owe our lives to a good , generous , and powerful being , and that this being so powerful , good and generous , <NAME> , is yourself ! ''
__label__0	All you had to do to understand the document was to read it backwards .
__label__1	‘ So he went , ’ said the gentleman with the gun-barrel , who was an extremely deliberate speaker , ‘ down to his cousin ’ s place , and took the Dog with him by rail .
__label__0	But this peaceful condition of affairs did not last long .
__label__1	If I had known what I was coming to see , I could have come provided .
__label__0	Da <NAME> had already taken on board 1000 hundredweights of pepper , 50 of ginger , and 450 of cinnamon , when he received warning that a considerable fleet , coming apparently from <NAME> , was advancing with hostile intentions .
__label__0	She is asleep , her head sunk in the lace-covered pillows .
__label__1	And now I fell into a state of neglect , which I can not look back upon without compassion .
__label__1	<NAME> went on , and the turnkey began to fail .
__label__1	Here he made the acquaintance of the <NAME> ’ s beautiful young wife ( paler than formerly , all this time ; more rarely seen by me or anyone , I think ; and not so gay , but not less beautiful ) , and so became more and more familiar by degrees , until , at last , he would come into the school and wait .
__label__1	And I observed , with great surprise , that he devoted it to staring in my direction as if he were lost in amazement .
__label__1	Some of the windows had been walled up ; of those that remained , all the lower were rustily barred .
__label__0	the last word has not been said concerning the crew of the <NAME> . ''
__label__1	It would keep him in town a good deal , and he preferred the country .
__label__1	I know what it is , sir .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> ever fall in with this great sheet of water ?
__label__0	It turned over when the tide overtook it , and then quietly returned to the deep sea . ''
__label__0	`` M. de <NAME> and I thought it of the greatest importance to ascertain whether the island we were coasting was that to which geographers had given the name of <NAME> , without guessing its extension southwards .
__label__1	‘ And now , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ concerning <NAME> ’ As <NAME> , with his chin tucked in and lips pouting , reclined in <NAME> ’ s lap , concentrating his blue eyes on the visitors and shading them from observation with a dimpled arm , old <NAME> took one of his fresh fat hands in her withered right , and fell to gently beating it on her withered left .
__label__0	During a fortnight they hunted a great deal ; fresh food was abundant ; they shot partridges , ptarmigans , and snow-birds , which were delicious eating .
__label__1	`` That 's very like <NAME> , '' says <NAME> .
__label__0	`` Nevertheless , '' retorted one of the audience , `` there are many arguments against the habitability of the worlds .
__label__1	Then this respectability of <NAME> is brought into powerful play against them .
__label__1	I don ’ t wish to discourage you , but I should certainly say that , of her case , <NAME> and Fogg are far better judges than any of us can be. ’ ‘ It ’ s a vile attempt to extort money , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	The little parlour-maid came out , with the key in her hand ; and looking earnestly at me as she unlocked the gate , said : ‘ I beg your pardon , sir .
__label__1	To know what member of what brilliant and distinguished circle accomplished the brilliant and distinguished feat of joining it yesterday or contemplates the no less brilliant and distinguished feat of leaving it to-morrow gives him a thrill of joy .
__label__0	Here is the engine which was taken out and left here , and the furnace which warmed the crew of the <NAME> in 1851 ; everything remains as it was left , and one might fancy that <NAME> , her captain , had sailed away from here yesterday .
__label__0	Was he bent on a voyage of discovery ?
__label__0	In the meanwhile , the pirates who occupied the islet had gradually advanced to the opposite shore , and were now only separated from the mainland by the channel .
__label__1	But the horses is off .
__label__0	Outside these islands stretch reefs and shallows ; the islands are between these dangers and the mainland , and a channel runs between .
__label__1	The <NAME> were a very high family , and a very large family .
__label__1	Instead of returning my ‘ Good morning ’ with his usual affability , he looked at me in a distant , ceremonious manner , and coldly requested me to accompany him to a certain coffee-house , which , in those days , had a door opening into the <NAME> , just within the little archway in <NAME> <NAME> ’ s <NAME> .
__label__1	What , are you here , <NAME> ?
__label__1	Make the most of it and think yourself lucky , but don ’ t think after that to come over <NAME> with your pardners .
__label__0	Were they asleep or dead ?
__label__1	Now , you know , there ’ s a struggle going on when that ’ s the case .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> and the squad had gone southward ; in the south all was still vacancy .
__label__0	`` While we are about it , it will certainly be only proper to discover all the secrets of this extraordinary region . ''
__label__1	For the young man himself , he rioted abroad for a brief term , living by his wits -- which means by the abuse of every faculty that worthily employed raises man above the beasts , and so degraded , sinks him far below them .
__label__1	And I don ’ t speak of myself , particular , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ because , sir , the way I look at it is , that we are all drawing on to the bottom of the hill , whatever age we are , on account of time never standing still for a single moment .
__label__1	But what 's the matter , <NAME> ? ''
__label__1	‘ Well ; but I was speaking ironically , ’ rejoined <NAME> .
__label__1	They sit down , <NAME> as if he had no power of bending himself , except at the hips , for that purpose .
__label__0	<NAME> returned to Fortaventura with his ships after conquering <NAME> and <NAME> .
__label__1	'The father of the unhappy <NAME> had _two_ daughters , ' said <NAME> .
__label__1	The old man listened with great attention , and when he had concluded , drew his arm eagerly through his own .
__label__1	'Yer know , Work'us , ' continued <NAME> , emboldened by <NAME> 's silence , and speaking in a jeering tone of affected pity : of all tones the most annoying : 'Yer know , Work'us , it ca n't be helped now ; and of course yer could n't help it then ; and I am very sorry for it ; and I 'm sure we all are , and pity yer very much .
__label__1	We held one another for a little space yet , but she was so firm that she took my hands away , and put them back against my breast , and with a last kiss as she held them there , released them , and went from me into the wood .
__label__0	This reply , hyperbolical and enigmatical at the time , <NAME> had heard and remembered .
__label__0	[ Footnote 3 : Fifth month of the <NAME> calendar , from 20th January to 20th February . ]
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> 's face expresses , so far as in its wooden material lies , the highest approbation and acquiescence .
__label__1	They sleep at the parsonage , but divide their attentions so equally among its inmates , and <NAME> and <NAME> , and <NAME> , that to this day the villagers have never been able to discover to which establishment they properly belong .
__label__1	That ’ s the general panoramic view. ’ Having so held and waved the candle as that all these heterogeneous objects seemed to come forward obediently when they were named , and then retire again , Mr Venus despondently repeats , ‘ Oh dear me , dear me ! ’ resumes his seat , and with drooping despondency upon him , falls to pouring himself out more tea .
__label__1	<NAME> , who had been fuming and chafing until he was nearly wild , darted from his seat , and followed him : so closely , that before the door had swung upon its hinges after <NAME> ’ s passing out , they stood side by side in the street together .
__label__0	They paid the same homage to <NAME> , <NAME> 's second in command , and successor .
__label__1	There might have been much more envy in politer places .
__label__0	By means of the cord they would then be able to draw down the ladder to the ground , and so re-establish the communication between the beach and <NAME> .
__label__1	At length they being among the trees , Mr <NAME> stopped short , and said : ‘ Mr Clennam , will you do me the favour to look at this man ?
__label__1	‘ I don ’ t know , ’ replied <NAME> pettishly .
__label__0	This was evidently a balance-fish -- the most voracious of all the <NAME> species .
__label__0	But after scaling the wall of the <NAME> , it did not terrify us .
__label__0	But every time he penetrated to any distance in the ruins , he was followed by a number of the inhabitants , who prevented him from examining anything in detail .
__label__1	‘ However , ’ said Mrs. Nickleby , drying her tears , ‘ this has nothing to do -- certainly nothing whatever to do -- with the gentleman in the next house. ’ ‘ I should suppose that the gentleman in the next house has as little to do with us , ’ returned <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> ! ’ We gave him three times three , and another , and a good one to finish with .
__label__1	‘ These are only some pupils of mine , ’ said <NAME> , pointing to the little boy on the trunk and the two little boys on the floor , who had been staring at each other without uttering a word , and writhing their bodies into most remarkable contortions , according to the custom of little boys when they first become acquainted .
__label__1	I won ’ t hear of it .
__label__1	And this , ’ hinted Mr Venus , delicately , ‘ being the very next time , you know , sir -- ’ -- ‘ Why , therefore you suppose he ’ ll turn to at the grindstone , eh , <NAME> ? ’ said Mr Boffin .
__label__1	‘ Very well , then , ’ said the old man ; ‘ make his bed .
__label__1	We ordered something rather special for dinner , with a bottle of something similarly out of the common way , in order that our minds might be fortified for the occasion , and we might come well up to the mark .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> ! ’ said <NAME> , with dignity .
__label__1	`` Now , <NAME> , '' he began , `` the word I have to say relates to <NAME> . ''
__label__0	that is the question , ” said the reporter .
__label__1	‘ May the present moment , ’ said <NAME> , sticking his fork into a large carbuncular potato , ‘ be the worst of our lives !
__label__0	J. T. <NAME> might well believe that his last hour was come .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> stood still , without saying a word .
__label__1	‘ Yes , ’ replied <NAME> , ‘ and a regular expedition we ’ ll make of it .
__label__0	Involuntarily , one and all , they plowed their heels into the ice and came to a halt .
__label__1	<NAME> cake , covered with <NAME> , silver , and true-lovers ’ knots .
__label__0	Above the forest were passing large clouds , to which the crater of <NAME> incessantly added fuliginous matter .
__label__1	'It 's all arranged about bringing off the swag , is it ? '
__label__0	“ Then , doubtless , the convicts installed themselves in the corral where they found plenty of everything , and only fled when they saw us coming .
__label__1	per cent. -- for every sovereign told another -- there would not be one piece of money in all the heap which wouldn ’ t represent ten thousand mean and paltry lies , told , not by the money-lender , oh no !
__label__1	<NAME> , astonishment , indignation , and a storm of passions , rushed through the listener ’ s heart , as the plot was laid bare .
__label__1	'Oh , you have n't , have n't you ? '
__label__1	`` I hope , guardian , '' said I , `` that you may not trust too much to my discretion .
__label__1	‘ I object on principle , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ as a biped -- ’ ‘ As a what ? ’ asked Mr Boffin .
__label__1	'We are all weak creeturs , ' said <NAME> .
__label__1	But you have not told me where he is now , <NAME> .
__label__1	Is there no devil to help me ? ’ Swiftly , there glided again into his brain the figure he had raised that night .
__label__0	`` But I thought there was a great deal of disturbance in the streets . ''
__label__0	said the doctor ; `` the fact is certain , we need give it no more thought . ''
__label__1	When I had exhausted the garden and a greenhouse with nothing in it but a fallen-down grape-vine and some bottles , I found myself in the dismal corner upon which I had looked out of the window .
__label__0	In that part of <NAME> lying between <NAME> and <NAME> , nature would seem to have collected and set forth specimens of every one of these terrestrial beauties .
__label__1	I couldn ’ t very well get out of it , ’ he explained , turning to the latter .
__label__0	The expedition took the route followed by <NAME> and soon reached <NAME> , which is the most southerly town of <NAME> , and the last before the traveller enters the desert of <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ You are the dolls ’ dressmaker ? ’ ‘ I am the dolls ’ dressmaker , sir. ’ ‘ <NAME> ’ s friend ? ’ ‘ Yes , sir , ’ replied <NAME> , instantly on the defensive .
__label__1	‘ Let me see then , ’ resumed Mr Boffin , with his hand to his chin .
__label__0	`` These resources , '' says <NAME> , `` so vast in comparison with those furnished by the <NAME> , were , to our thinking , partly the cause of his loss .
__label__0	I looked at the <NAME> .
__label__0	With this bill of fare , strict cleanliness was enforced ; every other day each man was obliged to bathe in the half-frozen water which the iron pump brought up , and this was an excellent way of preserving their health .
__label__1	Altogether , the <NAME> , at that date , was a choice illustration of the precept , that “ Whatever is is right ; ” an aphorism that would be as final as it is lazy , did it not include the troublesome consequence , that nothing that ever was , was wrong .
__label__1	The whole population of <NAME> and the adjoining towns rose from their beds at an early hour of the following morning , in a state of the utmost bustle and excitement .
__label__1	‘ I knew it ! ’ cried the single gentleman , letting down one of the front glasses .
__label__0	There was a meeting of the <NAME> , and Mrs. <NAME> was authorized to visit the prisoner as often as she thought fit .
__label__1	But it appeared to me -- I dare say magnifying the importance of the thing -- that it was respectful to explain to you how the matter stood and candid to consult your wishes and convenience .
__label__0	It was so important for the <NAME> government to proceed rapidly to reconnoitre the vast territories between the <NAME> and the <NAME> , that another expedition was speedily sent out .
__label__0	But if <NAME> could so reproach himself , how about <NAME> ?
__label__1	In a later stage of the dinner : that is to say , when the <NAME> stood at the <NAME> ’ s elbow ready to serve the first bottle of champagne : the <NAME> became still slyer .
__label__1	What have you been doing ? ’ ‘ Nothing , ’ replied <NAME> , ‘ but looking forward to your coming back. ’ ‘ And talking to Mr Lightwood , ’ said <NAME> , turning to him with a smile .
__label__1	‘ I ’ m very sorry if -- ’ ‘ <NAME> , <NAME> ’ am ! ’ said <NAME> , ‘ sorry in the possession of a <NAME> !
__label__1	The figure had plunged down the precipice , and she felt herself , as it were , attending on the body .
__label__1	Do not speak of money at present .
__label__0	From <NAME> to <NAME> is one hundred and fourteen degrees , or a difference in time of four hundred and fifty-six minutes .
__label__1	‘ When <NAME> got into the school here , ’ he pursued , ‘ her father was as pleased as <NAME> .
__label__1	I have seen him beat mine , more than once or twice , and I never forgot it. ’ ‘ Nothing , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ not even a beloved and beautiful sister ’ s tears under dastardly ill-usage ; ’ he became less severe , in spite of himself , as his indignation rose ; ‘ could justify those horrible expressions that you used. ’ ‘ I am sorry I used them , and especially to you , sir .
__label__1	The little judge turned to the witness as soon as his indignation would allow him to speak , and said -- ‘ Do you know who that was , sir ? ’ ‘ I rayther suspect it was my father , my lord , ’ replied <NAME> .
__label__1	To make your mother a fright upon your wedding-day ! ’ <NAME> bent the same fixed look upon her , as she sobbed and rubbed her eyes ; and said in the same low steady voice , which had neither risen nor fallen since she first addressed her , ‘ I have said that <NAME> must go home. ’ ‘ Let her go ! ’ cried the afflicted and affrighted parent , hastily .
__label__1	I found her with a well-formed figure ; a strongly-marked , nervous-sanguine temperament ; a large and beautifully-shaped head ; and the whole system in healthy action .
__label__1	The dawn coming , the morning coming , and the day coming , and neither message nor letter coming with either , he went down to the country house .
__label__1	‘ I don ’ t think you are well to-night , dear Fanny. ’ ‘ Stuff and nonsense ! ’ replied the young lady , turning angry again ; ‘ I am as well as you are .
__label__0	Although the <NAME> explored but a part of the <NAME> group , the information they collected was extremely interesting on account of its novelty .
__label__1	Entirely , sir ! ’ said <NAME> , in a lower and triumphant tone .
__label__1	‘ Help your mother to get breakfast , <NAME> .
__label__1	Sometimes I hope , my dear , and sometimes I -- do n't quite despair , but nearly .
__label__0	They had now only to descend the mountain slopes again , and explore the soil , in the triple point of view , of its mineral , vegetable , and animal resources .
__label__1	I had first seen him when I sent for him to lay this place waste for me ; having read of him in the newspapers , before I and the world parted .
__label__1	I might strive to disguise my real feelings from anybody but you ; but I will tell you that -- briefly and plainly , <NAME> -- that I love her. ’ Kate ’ s eyes brightened , and she was going to make some reply , when <NAME> laid his hand upon her arm , and went on : ‘ Nobody must know this but you .
__label__0	A fresh satellite , in the gloom of night , was shining conspicuously before them .
__label__1	I have a settled purpose. ’ ‘ And a good one , I hope , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> , knowing his young wife ’ s good sense , allowed her to act as she pleased .
__label__0	It was a glorious night .
__label__0	It is not known how or why a communication had been established between the reservoir which contained the oxygen and that which enclosed the hydrogen .
__label__0	Some of them were four yards and a quarter long .
__label__0	But no explosion , properly so termed , could be heard .
__label__1	There is little enough in the high tide of the day , but there is next to none at night .
__label__0	After all , suppose the old fellow was right !
__label__1	Such were the thoughts -- if to visions so imperfect and undefined as those which wandered through his enfeebled brain , the term can be applied -- which were present to the mind of <NAME> , and rendered him deaf alike to intimidation and persuasion .
__label__0	I have always fancied that the end of the earth will be when some enormous boiler , heated to three thousand millions of atmospheric pressure , shall explode and blow up our Globe ! ” “ And I add that the <NAME> , ” said <NAME> , “ will not have been the last to work at the machine ! ” “ In fact , ” assented the doctor , “ they are great boiler-makers !
__label__1	Could you give me any account of her whatever ? ’ ‘ None , ’ returned the Patriarch , shaking his big head with his utmost benevolence .
__label__1	‘ Nothing the matter , ’ replied <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> , all observation , chatted with the pilot and acted as manager .
__label__0	The Indians along the river belong to peaceable tribes , and the fiercest of them have retired before the advancing civilization , and drawn further and further away from the river and its tributaries .
__label__1	‘ Providence is against him , no doubt , ’ replied <NAME> , scratching his nose .
__label__1	I will not say ( whatever I may think ) that this affair has been got up solely to degrade and insult me .
__label__1	What does she try to do ?
__label__0	`` Yes , '' said <NAME> , `` and icebergs are met with in lower latitudes in the south than in the north of the <NAME> . ''
__label__1	It ’ s the best of old worlds !
__label__1	If in violation of your mother ’ s sentiments , you had condescended to allow yourself to be patronized by the <NAME> , and if you had come from those halls of slavery -- ’ ‘ That ’ s mere nonsense , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	Exactly , ’ said the old man .
__label__1	‘ Then , if you please , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ have the goodness to turn the cushion .
__label__1	The hotel ( a very excellent one ) is called the <NAME> .
__label__0	God , who reads our hearts , knows that we had a noble end in view .
__label__0	to prove that it is all over between you , accept frankly the proposal I am going to make to you . ''
__label__0	But from that day <NAME> appeared to be anxious .
__label__0	`` Each separate portion , M. Aronnax , was brought from different parts of the globe . ''
__label__1	Even <NAME> standing in a window , moodily swinging the tassel of a blind , gives it a smarter jerk now , as if he found himself in better case .
__label__0	It was easy to give a name to these gigantic bones , in some instances as big as trunks of trees .
__label__1	‘ There can be no disparity in marriage like unsuitability of mind and purpose ’ -- ‘ no disparity in marriage like unsuitability of mind and purpose. ’ ‘ There is nothing , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ that we have in common .
__label__0	There yet remained much useful advice to give them , and , his heart being softened by the approach of death , he invited , as we are aware , the colonists of <NAME> to visit the “ Nautilus , ” by means of a wire which connected it with the corral .
__label__1	He held it up , and looked round , everywhere , expecting to see her crouching in some corner ; but the room was empty .
__label__0	The stunning effects of the new blow were hardly over when the <NAME> began to perceive that the wonderful intelligence was decidedly in their favor .
__label__0	“ Well , <NAME> ? ” was the captain ’ s invariable response to his servant ’ s formula .
__label__1	‘ Oh , to be sure ! ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	And if you are not crushed by such a pressure , it is because the air penetrates the interior of your body with equal pressure .
__label__1	In which case , we might not only know the fact , but might know from <NAME> what the terms of the communication were. ’ ‘ I see ! ’ cried Rosa .
__label__1	I don ’ t go so far as to ask for his lordship ; I only ask for his name .
__label__0	Ten o ’ clock had just struck .
__label__1	Very rarely tells him anything more explicit .
__label__0	At a gesture from the judge , however , he sat down again , and in a calmer voice asked : “ And in the first place , sir , what makes you think that the basis of this document is a number , or , as you call it , a cipher ? ” “ <NAME> to me , young man , ” replied the judge , “ and you will be forced to give in to the evidence. ” The magistrate took the document and put it before the eyes of <NAME> and showed him what he had done .
__label__0	`` No , my friends , '' said the engineer , `` wait till night .
__label__1	Only into the kitchen to fetch hot water. ’ To think of growing up with a kind of awe upon one as to the luxuries of that superb establishment , the <NAME> !
__label__1	You are high spirited by right and by nature , my Blandois ! ’ To such soothing murmurs did this gentleman smoke out his cigar and drink out his bottle of wine .
__label__0	Certainly , he was not out of danger , intermittent fevers being subject to frequent and dangerous relapses , but the most assiduous care was bestowed on him .
__label__1	It was a pretty letter .
__label__1	Why , you won ’ t tell me , <NAME> , that you really suppose my sister Loo does care for old Bounderby. ’ ‘ My dear fellow , ’ returned the other , ‘ what am I bound to suppose , when I find two married people living in harmony and happiness ? ’ <NAME> had by this time got both his legs on the sofa .
__label__1	the time had come when my first parting words to you were true -- when she was glad to lay her poor head on her stupid cross old <NAME> ’ s arm -- and she died like a child that had gone to sleep ! ’ Thus ended <NAME> ’ s narration .
__label__0	my poor father ! ” cried <NAME> , throwing herself on her knees before <NAME> , who exclaimed in amazement : “ Your father ?
__label__1	`` Well , '' returns the old man , `` it 's true that I do n't see company , <NAME> , and that I do n't treat .
__label__0	In some places the plateau opened before them , and they passed without hindrance .
__label__1	suppose we change the subject. ’ The truth was , that the simple-minded Uncle in his secret attraction towards the marvellous and adventurous -- of which he was , in some sort , a distant relation , by his trade -- had greatly encouraged the same attraction in the nephew ; and that everything that had ever been put before the boy to deter him from a life of adventure , had had the usual unaccountable effect of sharpening his taste for it .
__label__0	<NAME> not the raft progressing with the most marvelous rapidity ?
__label__0	Yes , perhaps , and also appearances of land towards the south . ''
__label__0	After a comfortable breakfast , served in the car , <NAME> and his partners had just resumed whist , when a violent whistling was heard , and the train stopped .
__label__0	With us , after a long fast , some mouthfuls of bread and meat , a little moldy biscuit and salt beef triumphed over all our previous gloomy and saturnine thoughts .
__label__1	I would not hurt a hair of his gray head , for the riches of the world. ” ‘ The old man cast down his eyes at this reproof , and they met those of his daughter .
__label__0	There they were before me , but how unreal .
__label__1	My father ’ s not in the way , and won ’ t be in the way to-day , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	too late ! ” But by a superhuman effort he raised himself up .
__label__1	Many a night and many a day had its inmates listened to the echoes in the corner , with hearts that failed them when they heard the thronging feet .
__label__1	Many of the lamps were already extinguished ; a few country waggons were slowly toiling on , towards <NAME> ; now and then , a stage-coach , covered with mud , rattled briskly by : the driver bestowing , as he passed , an admonitory lash upon the heavy waggoner who , by keeping on the wrong side of the road , had endangered his arriving at the office , a quarter of a minute after his time .
__label__1	So he has brought you up to follow in his ways and has sent you into foreign countries and the like ?
__label__1	The man with the wooden leg eyed me all over -- it didn ’ t take long , for there was not much of me -- and locked the gate behind us , and took out the key .
__label__1	This was her husband ’ s verdict , and he justified it by telling her that she had begun her married life as the most endearing creature that could possibly be .
__label__0	They are divided into two packets , about a foot apart ; <NAME> hangs a ladder of rope knotted to one of these , which answers instead of a parapet .
__label__1	‘ It might have been better for <NAME> to have known some hardships , ’ he says , defiantly .
__label__1	He had settled , within himself , that the child must necessarily pass through a certain routine of minor maladies , and that the sooner he did so the better .
__label__1	Regular flayers and grinders , my dear <NAME> , ’ repeated <NAME> with a peculiar relish , ‘ and they ’ ll skin you by the inch , from the nape of your neck to the sole of your foot , and grind every inch of your skin to tooth-powder .
__label__0	cried M'Nicholl , rapidly flourishing his pencil .
__label__0	It only remained now to find a guide , which was comparatively easy .
__label__1	Forty year ago , you had only to let down the bucket till the first knot in the rope was free of the windlass , and you heard it splashing in the cold dull water .
__label__0	[ Illustration : `` It was hollowed out of a single tree-trunk . '' ]
__label__0	The coast on the west reappeared -- a rocky coast , without a mountainous background ; the <NAME> was following its line .
__label__0	The two travellers reached <NAME> and <NAME> , where they were much gratified at meeting with some <NAME> traders from <NAME> and <NAME> , who conducted them to Tor -- the ancient Ezion-geber -- at the foot of <NAME> , where they were able to procure some valuable information upon the trade of <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> hardly knew what he was about , with delight .
__label__0	The youthful maiden , hitherto entombed in the massive depths of the earth , had now obtained an idea of the universe -- of the works both of God and of man .
__label__0	I think that means ‘ bark of a tree ’ in Australian. ” <NAME> nodded , and looked again at the travelers .
__label__1	are not bonded together for better for worst so fast , but that they can be set free fro ’ _their_ misfortnet marriages , an ’ marry ower agen .
__label__1	‘ My darling , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ you wear that pretty black frock in remembrance of your Mama. ’ ‘ I can remember my Mama , ’ returned the child , with tears springing to her eyes , ‘ in any frock. ’ ‘ But people put on black , to remember people when they ’ re gone. ’ ‘ Where gone ? ’ asked the child .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> on his legs again .
__label__1	To speak unreservedly to you , I do .
__label__1	‘ A milliner and dressmaker , ma ’ am , ’ replied <NAME> .
__label__0	I never have taken any , and I never intend to do so . ' ''
__label__1	“ Orlick there ? ” “ Ah ! ” he answered , slouching out .
__label__1	But <NAME> ’ s solicitude to get to her father , and to carry the joyful tidings to him , and not to leave him in his jail a moment with this happiness in store for him and still unknown to him , did more for her speedy restoration than all the skill and attention on earth could have done .
__label__1	But this put me into such a tremble lest they should detain me there that she soon recalled her words and compromised for a rest of half an hour .
__label__1	Come and ask her if she is better ; come and ask her to lie down .
__label__0	“ But , ” said the doctor , “ are you not aware that my journey is to compete with the success of the expeditions now on foot ?
__label__1	But I shall get on best at <NAME> , where there 's more room for a weed than there is here ; and the dear old lady will be made happy besides .
__label__0	If the Projectile itself were floating in it , as was possible , would not such a good conductor of sound convey to their ears the reflexion of some lunar echo , the roar of some storm raging among the mountains , the rattling of some plunging avalanche , or the detonations of some eructating volcano ?
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> sends a carriage for you -- twenty minutes before seven to the moment -- you ’ ll not be so cruel as to disappoint the whole party , Mrs. Nickleby ? ’ ‘ You are so very pressing , that I scarcely know what to say , ’ replied the worthy lady .
__label__1	'No , not at all , ' rejoined <NAME> .
__label__0	His emotion showed the extreme importance he attached to the possession of this letter .
__label__1	‘ I wonder I haven ’ t chucked it away afore now .
__label__1	Not a day passed without my going there , of course .
__label__0	It would have been an act of unpardonable rashness to leave the provisions in the storeroom of the <NAME> , her situation on the side of the iceberg being very precarious .
__label__1	‘ The hag is out , on some preparation for your wedding festivities , I suppose , ’ said <NAME> , preparing to depart .
__label__1	`` It 's no fault of yours , sir ; but you shall judge .
__label__1	‘ I see him a-winkin ’ at her , with his wicked old eye , ’ shouted a fourth .
__label__0	But no pleasant sound of falling water fell upon my listening ear .
__label__1	It was a crazy old house with a wharf of its own , abutting on the water when the tide was in , and on the mud when the tide was out , and literally overrun with rats .
__label__0	cried the <NAME> ; `` then let us imitate the sailors when they do the same thing in the <NAME> !
__label__1	<NAME> care how you spend it , and do n't get yourself into trouble . ''
__label__0	The awful and hideous storm still continues ; the lightning has increased in vividness , and pours out its fiery wrath like a brood of serpents let loose in the atmosphere .
__label__0	Some minutes more passed , and the <NAME> withdrew his hand from the stroke of a sharp blade .
__label__0	They wished him to join them again , and relied upon his aid to enable them to gain possession of <NAME> , to penetrate into that hitherto inaccessible dwelling , and to become masters of the island , after murdering the colonists !
__label__1	‘ Did you expect to see me return as youthful as I went away , mother ? ’ she said at length , turning her eyes upon the old woman .
__label__1	There -- <NAME> -- sounds well , I think , sir. ’ ‘ Very , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	Another respondent grunt was uttered by the ape .
__label__1	My aunt was as happy as I was , in the arrangement made for me ; and we went down to the drawing-room again , well pleased and gratified .
__label__1	‘ You have reminded me , <NAME> , that this conversation was private -- private and confidential , gentlemen .
__label__0	The news of the taking of <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , successively reached <NAME> .
__label__1	But <NAME> held her sacred purpose , unsuspected and unaided : and studied only how to bring her father to the understanding that she loved him , and made no appeal against him in any wandering thought .
__label__1	`` But I 'll lime you , you dog , I 'll lime you ! ''
__label__0	A commotion is going on there , of which we can neither estimate the importance nor the ultimate result . ''
__label__1	‘ You have no reason to suppose that they have run away from anywhere without paying the rates and taxes due , I hope ? ’ <NAME> , with a look of some contempt , was about to enter a general protest against the payment of rates or taxes , under any circumstances , when he was checked by a timely whisper from <NAME> , and several frowns and winks from Mrs. K. , which providentially stopped him .
__label__0	In giving this reply the great navigator had no prevision of his fate , or of the difficulty his fellow-countrymen would have in finding his remains .
__label__1	He lighted his lantern from that which <NAME> had detached from the rope , and now carried in his hand ; and making no effort to prolong the discourse , descended in silence , followed by his wife .
__label__0	This demand could not be complied with as <NAME> well knew ; but upon the refusal he resolved to seize the town , fixing upon <NAME> <NAME> ' day for the attack .
__label__1	Women work hard in these parts .
__label__0	`` But they did not know what they should put them in to carry them .
__label__1	Then , why don ’ t they improve it , ma ’ am !
__label__1	`` Your woman 's wit hits the mark .
__label__1	I regret to say , <NAME> , that I could have wished you had fatigued yourself a little more on this occasion .
__label__1	' I _will_ speak , ' cried the man ; ' I will not be turned out .
__label__1	A folded piece of paper in one of them attracting my attention , I opened it and found it to be the play-bill I had received from <NAME> , relative to the celebrated provincial amateur of <NAME> renown .
__label__1	<NAME> down into my place ! ” and flung himself in the sea ! ’ The kindling eye and heightened colour of the boy , who had risen from his seat in the earnestness of what he said and felt , seemed to remind old Sol of something he had forgotten , or that his encircling mist had hitherto shut out .
__label__0	The doctor went in under the awning for a moment or two , to look at his still sleeping patient .
__label__1	And if ever in my life I saw a love that nothing but death could change , I saw it then before me .
__label__1	`` That 's a bad presentiment , mother . ''
__label__1	Going out early in life and marrying late , as his father had done before him , he too begat a lean and anxious-minded son , who in his turn , going out early in life and marrying late , became the father of <NAME> and <NAME> , twins .
__label__0	At the end of this fourth day not a single person doubted but that it contained the vindication of the doomed man .
__label__0	‘ <NAME> my word I never saw anything to come up to it. ” Just then a crashing clap of thunder re-echoed through the defile , and then died away among the distant peaks .
__label__0	<NAME> then in a few words related the incidents of the voyage , and dwelt on the curious fact of the sort of passing gleam in the prisoner 's mind , when for an instant in the height of the storm he had become a sailor .
__label__1	He asked me if I felt sure that I was as well as in the morning ?
__label__0	But here opinions began to diverge .
__label__0	The natives in reply to the questions put to them , asserted that they were in the habit of eating their enemies .
__label__1	‘ Dear me , sir ! ’ said <NAME> , surveying me with his head on one side .
__label__1	I knew I had an artful customer to deal with and that proof would be very difficult ; and I laid a trap for her -- such a trap as I never laid yet , and such a venture as I never made yet .
__label__0	`` On carefully considering , '' he said , `` what is going on now between <NAME> and <NAME> , it is clear that the same difficulties will recur with all the towns of the favored State .
__label__1	‘ You , you won ’ t be angry with me now .
__label__0	In 1504 and 1505 four vessels explored the Gulf of <NAME> .
__label__0	This confessor , prior of the monastery of <NAME> , was deep in the confidence of <NAME> and <NAME> ; but he did not approve of the projects of the <NAME> navigator , and he rendered him no service whatever with his royal penitent .
__label__0	It is the general law of nature which makes those countries in which we do not live unhealthy and sterile , like those out of which life has died .
__label__1	So the girl eyed him .
__label__1	I wrote her a letter , of which he took charge , and he left us within half an hour of our arrival at our destination , on a delightful evening in the early summer-time .
__label__0	Then the <NAME> hinted that if <NAME> were properly dealt with , <NAME> would reveal the secret .
__label__0	We shall follow his fortunes hereafter .
__label__1	Oh , my dear Spyers , where is the villain ! ''
__label__1	I am glad to see you , and glad you are not too proud to know me . ''
__label__0	It is very unusual to find one who is less than six feet in height .
__label__0	If they ate a good deal , they talked more .
__label__1	He made my heart ache very often. ’ ‘ It is a good heart , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ that disentangles itself from the close avocations of every day , to heed such things .
__label__0	It occupies the great focus of disruption , whence it sends out great streaks thousands of miles in length ; and it gives the most unmistakable evidence of the terribly eruptive nature of those forces that once shattered the <NAME> 's solidified shell in this portion of the lunar surface .
__label__0	“ Do you mean the Observatory ? ” “ Yes , the Observatory .
__label__0	From this village it would be easy to reach <NAME> , and there they could rest in an excellent hotel , highly recommended by Dr. Hochstetter .
__label__0	He was a fine , open-hearted fellow , and I sold him a cargo of seal-skins .
__label__1	A delightful sentiment , sir ! ’ To all these rambling observations , Mr <NAME> answered not one word , but , returning for the aquatic jacket , rolled it into a tight round ball : looking steadily at <NAME> meanwhile as if he had some intention of bowling him down with it .
__label__0	`` Do not cry out before you are hurt .
__label__0	`` For my part , however , '' continued <NAME> , not heeding these interruptions , `` I must confess that , notwithstanding the magnificent splendor of the spectacle when viewed for the first time by the Selenite who inhabits the dark side of the <NAME> , I should prefer to be a resident on the illuminated side .
__label__1	The cat remains where they found her , still snarling at the something on the ground before the fire and between the two chairs .
__label__0	<NAME> , who was accustomed to the dangers of the sea , and an old sailor in arctic regions , lacked neither coolness nor courage .
__label__0	He landed in <NAME> , was received with enthusiasm , held meetings , saw himself carried in triumph , reconciled President <NAME> to his mortal enemy , <NAME> , and , as a token of reconciliation , persuaded them both to start with him in the projectile .
__label__1	Then , confounding that time with the later days of the many footsteps , he would be amazed at their number , and begin to count them as he followed her .
__label__1	`` I can not consent to hear another word , sir , '' I returned , `` Unless you get up from the carpet directly and go and sit down at the table as you ought to do if you have any sense at all . ''
__label__0	As with the first line so did he with the second , and the third , and the fourth , until he reached the end of the paragraph .
__label__1	We had one favourite spot , deep in moss and last year 's leaves , where there were some felled trees from which the bark was all stripped off .
__label__0	Its left scuttle was even cracked by a violent shock .
__label__0	`` Then , doubtless , the convicts installed themselves in the corral where they found plenty of everything , and only fled when they saw us coming .
__label__1	‘ Very , ’ said <NAME> , with his mouth full .
__label__1	Other gentlemen , who had no briefs to show , carried under their arms goodly octavos , with a red label behind , and that under-done-pie-crust-coloured cover , which is technically known as ‘ law calf. ’ Others , who had neither briefs nor books , thrust their hands into their pockets , and looked as wise as they conveniently could ; others , again , moved here and there with great restlessness and earnestness of manner , content to awaken thereby the admiration and astonishment of the uninitiated strangers .
__label__1	<NAME> , long ago , ’ said <NAME> , without looking at her .
__label__0	`` True , '' replied <NAME> , `` and I do not fear an earthquake in the sense in which the term is commonly applied to convulsions of the soil provoked by the expansion of subterranean gases .
__label__1	“ Mother by adoption , ” retorted <NAME> , never departing from the easy grace of her attitude , never raising her voice as the other did , never yielding either to anger or tenderness , -- “ mother by adoption , I have said that I owe everything to you .
__label__0	`` And why , my dear <NAME> , '' answered <NAME> , `` should it not follow the road naturally traced out for it ? ''
__label__1	‘ He ’ s opposed to us ; he leads on the other side .
__label__1	‘ There , <NAME> , ’ said my mother , changing her tone , ‘ don ’ t let us fall out with one another , for I couldn ’ t bear it .
__label__1	Never shall I forget the lonely sensation of first lying down , without a roof above my head !
__label__0	At noon they passed on the left the mouth of the <NAME> .
__label__0	In consequence , I was always free to do as I liked on a Wednesday .
__label__0	Just then <NAME> passed near me .
__label__1	Not the faintest rustle broke the profound tranquillity of the solemn scene .
__label__1	This unforeseen and violent removal of one whom she had long watched and distrusted and who had long watched and distrusted her , one for whom she could have had few intervals of kindness , always dreading in him a dangerous and secret enemy , appeared so awful that my first thoughts were of her .
__label__0	His arduous and perilous journey had extended over no less than nine months ; and although he had not attained its main object , it was not without scientific results .
__label__1	I should lose almost all the value that I put upon the little learning I have , which is all owing to him , and which I conquered the difficulties of , that he might not think it thrown away upon me .
__label__1	It looked very comfortable indeed .
__label__0	A few moments after , <NAME> pressed the young woman 's hand , and , having confided to her his precious carpet-bag , went off with the sergeant and his little squad .
__label__0	They were also able to hunt with greater success , since <NAME> now possessed some dozen arrows armed with sharp points .
__label__0	<NAME> , <NAME> , how good our father was ! ” “ And so noble , so generous ! ” added <NAME> .
__label__0	When <NAME> and myself met on the quay , we took no notice of each other ; nevertheless , I fancied there was some hesitation in his manner ; as though he would have liked to speak to me .
__label__1	He may think of her constantly , or he may never think about her .
__label__1	Approaching nearer and nearer , the bargeman became <NAME> , in rough water-side second-hand clothing .
__label__1	‘ How ? ’ An impatient glance from <NAME> seemed , as <NAME> saw it , to answer ‘ With my eyes ! ’ But her only answer in words was : ‘ I met her near the church. ’ ‘ What was she doing there I wonder ! ’ said Mr Meagles .
__label__0	Arrived at this point the settlers retraced their steps , and at nightfall entered the <NAME> ; but they did not sleep before the question of knowing whether they could think of leaving <NAME> or not was definitely settled .
__label__1	To entreat her , at least , to pause .

__label__0	The card-board thus prepared is cut into various thicknesses according to the value of the money it is supposed to represent .
__label__1	‘ You Bob <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> to this pot-boy , ‘ run round to <NAME> ’ s and tell his daughter <NAME> that I want to speak to her. ’ With exemplary swiftness <NAME> departed , and returned .
__label__1	why can not we push them back , only a week or two in our memories , so as to put them at once at that convenient distance whence they may be regarded either with a calm indifference or a pleasant effort of recollection !
__label__0	This immense extent of steppes , which includes more than one hundred and ten degrees from west to east , is a land to which criminals and political offenders are banished .
__label__1	I told him that I had heard by chance of his being in difficulty and had come to consult with him what could best be done .
__label__1	The fact is , that feeling extremely interested in everything that relates to <NAME> -- not for any selfish reason , <NAME> , for I am well aware that the most able thing I could do for all parties would be to put an end to my existence , which can only be regarded as an inconvenience -- I have been in the habit of bestowing a trifle now and then upon a footman ; a most respectable young man , of the name of <NAME> , who has lived in the family some time ; and <NAME> informed me , yesterday evening , that this was the state of things .
__label__0	“ The captain , ” answered <NAME> .
__label__1	said the stranger , thrown off his guard ; and plainly showing that all his fears ( whatever they were ) were aroused afresh by the intelligence .
__label__0	The Friendly , <NAME> , and <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> 's <NAME> , the <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , the <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> de <NAME> , were the halting places on the return voyage , which terminated on the 9th June , 1842 , at <NAME> , the explorers having been absent three years and ten months altogether .
__label__1	Keeping his eye fixed on <NAME> , he walked up to the table , and beginning with his glass , drank off the contents , and went regularly round until he had emptied the other two , when he seized the case-bottle , and hugging it under his arm , surveyed him with a most extraordinary leer .
__label__1	Come on , and do n't stand preaching there . '
__label__1	There are two theatres in <NAME> , of good size and construction , but sadly in want of patronage .
__label__0	He seems to have specially turned his attention to the overflow of the banks of the Nile , and he gives an account of the different opinions held as to the source of this river , which the <NAME> worshipped as one of their deities .
__label__0	The previous escape was doubtless owing to some slight , though unaccountable , modification in the rate of motion ; but whether the inhabitants of the earth had fared so fortunately , was a question that had still to be determined .
__label__1	God send that old nursery tales were true , and that gypsies stole such children by the score !
__label__0	The colonists , not having any pressing work out of doors , profited by the bad weather to work at the interior of <NAME> , the arrangement of which was becoming more complete from day to day .
__label__0	Still , on their representing that they had seen some parroquets flying in a south-westerly direction , the admiral consented to change his route so far as to steer some points to the south , a change which had happy consequences in the future , for had they continued to run directly westward , the caravels would have been aground upon the great <NAME> , and would probably have been altogether destroyed .
__label__0	Their last hope , the vessel , had been shattered to pieces .
__label__1	Her father was a country gentleman down in your part of the world , and was a brewer .
__label__0	You will confess that it is not impracticable ; having once come with our brig to latitude 83° , we shall have only about six hundred miles between us and the Pole . ''
__label__1	For certain , <NAME> looked that way , when a chill air came up , and when it passed on murmuring , as if it whispered something that made the phantom trees and water tremble -- or threaten -- for fancy might have made it either .
__label__1	It 's rare for you both that you went out early in life -- Judy to the flower business , and you to the law .
__label__0	The water was shallow everywhere , and the breakers were heavy .
__label__0	repeated the captain , with clinched fists and sparkling eyes .
__label__0	`` You saved mine , '' answered the <NAME> .
__label__0	`` It looks like it , '' answered <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ I surprise you , sir ? ’ he said , with a quick change to a submissive manner .
__label__1	‘ Them things as is always a-goin ’ up and down , in the city. ’ ‘ Omnibuses ? ’ suggested <NAME> .
__label__0	From what <NAME> had said in his journal , the explorers expected to have to contend with natural dangers of a very formidable description , and also to fight their way amongst natives of gigantic stature , whose hostility to the white man was invincible .
__label__0	Without turning his head , without replying , he spurred on , and , clearing the brushwood with a tremendous bound , he galloped at full speed toward the <NAME> .
__label__0	Then , by bribing the merchants with a gun and a little tobacco , he persuaded them to conduct him to <NAME> .
__label__0	But at last the time came when my limbs refused to carry me longer .
__label__0	“ The torches will soon go out. ” “ Forward ! ” replied <NAME> .
__label__0	I let the worthy fellow chatter as he pleased , without caring to answer him .
__label__1	But I must not take that at a word .
__label__0	The whole region was bristling with spikes and circles .
__label__1	She ca n't know anything about me though , ' added <NAME> after a moment 's silence .
__label__1	You remember ( to say nothing of our treatment ) this same Creakle turning his son out of doors , I suppose , and the life he used to lead his wife and daughter ? ’ ‘ Perfectly , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	She was much startled , on returning home one night , to find that Mrs <NAME> had commanded an announcement to be prepared , to the effect that the stupendous collection would only remain in its present quarters one day longer ; in fulfilment of which threat ( for all announcements connected with public amusements are well known to be irrevocable and most exact ) , the stupendous collection shut up next day .
__label__1	Now confess , <NAME> , that you haven ’ t liked me quite as I have liked you .
__label__0	<NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> had not even to stir up the Indians or to encourage them .
__label__1	It was very sad to look upon and hear them , happy though their condition unquestionably was ; and I saw that one blind girl , who ( being for the time deprived of the use of her limbs , by illness ) sat close beside me with her face towards them , wept silently the while she listened .
__label__1	I have been away nearly eight years .
__label__1	These three groups sat round the fire eyeing each other drily , and waiting for supper .
__label__1	You ’ ve heard of my Clown and hith dog being thuppothed to have morrithed ? ’ He addressed <NAME> , who answered ‘ Yes. ’ ‘ Well , <NAME> , ’ he returned , taking off his hat , and rubbing the lining with his pocket-handkerchief , which he kept inside for the purpose .
__label__0	`` Yes , an eruption , '' replied <NAME> , who was carefully studying the phenomenon through his night glass .
__label__1	‘ The old story ; always thinking , and never doing .
__label__1	I have used no threat , remember ; I have done no more than show you how the case stands ; -- how the case stands , so far. ’ At this moment her brother sauntered into view close by .
__label__1	‘ Made a pretty good thing of marrying , didn ’ t you ? ’ asked <NAME> .
__label__0	I was wearing the long shirt of a <NAME> , and a pair of trousers which had once been white , but which in the six weeks I had worn them had become brown , and were all but in rags ; in addition to this I had on a blue turban , a piece of rope served me as a girdle , and I carried in my hand a thick stick , which had assisted me greatly in my walking , and protected me from dogs . ''
__label__0	“ Poor as it is , ” returned <NAME> , “ we ought not to lose it .
__label__1	‘ “ It is , is it ? ” said my uncle .
__label__0	Presently , recognizing <NAME> ’ s voice , it dropped the burning match into the water , and , describing a wide circle , flew downwards , alighting at the maiden ’ s feet .
__label__0	A providential inspiration bade her restrain herself and retain her liberty that she might lead <NAME> ’ s son to that goal which he had sworn to reach .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , ’ said the <NAME> , in persuasive accents .
__label__1	<NAME> will read it for her , and tell her what to do .
__label__1	‘ At this very moment , the gentleman in sky-blue turning round , and seeing the young lady with her face uncovered , vented an exclamation of rage and jealousy , and , turning his weapon against her beautiful bosom , pointed a thrust at her heart , which caused my uncle to utter a cry of apprehension that made the building ring .
__label__1	<NAME> was taken off in an instant , with a blessing from his mother , and a scream from little <NAME> , ringing in his ears .
__label__0	In short , they had a supply for six weeks , and powder enough .
__label__1	All this , I say , was wonderfully fine ; but I must say , too , that there were times when it was very dreary .
__label__0	The blood flowed from his shoulder under his torn shirt , but he took no notice of it .
__label__1	I sunk in wretchedness and ruin , lower and lower yet .
__label__1	‘ I made submission , being on the wrong side of the bolts and bars ; and as you were not the made man then that you are now , you were glad enough to take back a clerk who wasn ’ t over nice , and who knew something of the trade you drove. ’ ‘ You begged and prayed , and I consented , ’ returned <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> and <NAME> had been in a bad thing with a rich lady some years afore , and they 'd made a pot of money by it ; but <NAME> betted and gamed , and he 'd have run through the king 's taxes .
__label__1	said <NAME> , involuntarily falling from her strange companion .
__label__1	One of these is his own sleeping chamber : the other is his nephew ’ s .
__label__0	<NAME> could not help smiling at <NAME> 's reply ; then , returning to his theory , said : `` Thus , in case of a shock , it would have been with our projectile as with a ball which falls in a burning state after having struck the metal plate ; it is its motion which is turned into heat .
__label__0	but without offering any solution of them .
__label__0	They plainly saw the nature of <NAME> ’ s feelings towards her , and were far from displeased thereat .
__label__1	There was another blank silence before her father rejoined : “ I believe it .
__label__0	The vast stretch of water broadened away from the spot , especially toward the east , and nothing could be seen on the horizon , neither mainland nor islands .
__label__1	The track of to-day had the same features as the track of yesterday .
__label__1	With his quadrant at his round black knob of an eye , and his figure in its old attitude of indomitable alacrity , the <NAME> displayed his elfin small-clothes to the best advantage , and , absorbed in scientific pursuits , had no sympathy with worldly concerns .
__label__1	' I know better , ' said <NAME> .
__label__1	But , when we went into the room , and it turned pale , she was ten thousand times prettier yet .
__label__1	`` <NAME> , my dear , '' she would say , and always with some emotion , for with her lofty pedigree she had a very affectionate heart , `` was descended from a great <NAME> family , the <NAME> of <NAME> .
__label__0	The <NAME> still wore his uniform .
__label__0	But for some minutes I involuntarily confounded the genera , taking animals for plants ; and who would not have been mistaken ?
__label__0	`` You must remember that , since we started , we have kept up hot fires in all our furnaces , and , though we had coal enough to go on short steam from <NAME> to <NAME> , we have n't enough to go with all steam from <NAME> to <NAME> . ''
__label__0	At low tide they overhauled the hold -- at high tide they stowed away the rescued articles .
__label__0	“ Yes , ” said <NAME> ; “ and since this stream feeds the lake , most probably on the side near the sea there is an outlet by which the surplus water escapes .
__label__1	<NAME> ’ t he smell of spirits , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Horrid , your Wash-up , ’ replied <NAME> , who had a vague impression that there was a smell of rum somewhere .
__label__1	There was nothing very inviting in the object , but Mr <NAME> was wrapt in a brown study , and sat contemplating it with far greater attention than , in a more conscious mood , he would have deigned to bestow upon the rarest exotic .
__label__1	' I ask you again , ' thundered the doctor , 'are you , on your solemn oaths , able to identify that boy ? '
__label__1	“ I was alluding , <NAME> , ” said <NAME> , “ to a stranger who entered into conversation with me in the street as I came to the <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> was carefully carrying some black swallows ’ eggs , and a string of sparrows , which he meant to serve up later under the name of field larks .
__label__1	‘ Shall I go for the police ? ’ inquired <NAME> , with a nimble start towards the door .
__label__0	If free , would he attempt to fly , or would he remain ?
__label__1	In this rough clothing , with a common mariner ’ s telescope under his arm , and a shrewd trick of casting up his eye at the sky as looking out for dirty weather , he was far more nautical , after his manner , than <NAME> .
__label__1	I had found the niece before then ; and what I did for her , was better for her far than the money of which she would have had no good. ’ She added , after a moment , as though she addressed the watch : ‘ She herself was innocent , and I might not have forgotten to relinquish it to her at my death : ’ and sat looking at it .
__label__1	‘ But wot else is it , my lambs , as they sometimes ketches in rivers ? ’ Chorus at a loss .
__label__0	He was careful to have a large quantity of wheat , barley , millet , and rice , stored up in years of abundant harvest , so as to keep the price of grain at a uniform rate when the harvest failed .
__label__1	Most solemnly. ’ ‘ Nor let the <NAME> touch me , not yet so much as look at me ! ’ with another struggle .
__label__1	The <NAME> stopped beside one little knot of business men .
__label__1	He gently places her with her back to the crashing engine that constantly whirrs up and falls , and she looks into his face and thanks him .
__label__1	Over most of the beds , the toys were yet grouped as the children had left them when they last laid themselves down , and , in their innocent grotesqueness and incongruity , they might have stood for the children ’ s dreams .
__label__1	It being now dark , the shutter was closed , and a candle lighted and placed upon the table .
__label__0	I should have ventured out on the very point of the Projectile , and there I should have danced and postured and kicked and bobbed and capered in a style that <NAME> never dreamed of ! ''
__label__1	It is difficult to believe that <NAME> ( round-eyed still , and not at all grammatical ) is married to a miller in our neighbourhood ; yet so it is ; and even now , looking up from my desk as I write early in the morning at my summer window , I see the very mill beginning to go round .
__label__0	The Jesuits incite the women to greater austerity in their piety than any other order .
__label__1	Therefore , after vainly endeavouring to convince his reason by shakes , pokes , bawlings-out , and similar applications to his head , she led him into the air , and tried another method ; which was manifested to the marriage party by a quick succession of sharp sounds , resembling applause , and subsequently , by their seeing <NAME> in contact with the coolest paving-stone in the court , greatly flushed , and loudly lamenting .
__label__1	‘ It made ma cry when she knew it , ’ interposed <NAME> , ‘ but we kept it from her for a long time ; and pa was very low in his spirits , but he is better now ; and I was very ill , but I am better too. ’ ‘ Would you give your great-uncle Lillyvick a kiss if he was to ask you , <NAME> ? ’ said the collector , with some hesitation .
__label__0	The little ones retreated precipitately into the maternal pouch , and all the troop decamped in file .
__label__0	More than one bold adventurer presented himself , offering to share the dangers as well as the glory of the undertaking ; but he refused them all , without giving his reasons for rejecting them .
__label__1	After all , perhaps , the plainest course for persons of such tender consciences , would be , a total abstinence from tavern-keeping .
__label__0	At this moment nothing is clear to me ; I catch but a glimpse of light amidst all the darkness , and I must confine myself to writing as events shall dictate .
__label__0	`` No doubt , and I congratulate you , <NAME> , for you are a happy man .
__label__1	What can you two be together ?
__label__1	‘ I have not heard it myself , not being in the way of such things , but I have been told it ’ s even printed -- for private circulation -- but that ’ s all over town , of course. ’ ‘ It ’ s a lie ! ’ said <NAME> ; ‘ I tell you it ’ s all a lie .

__label__0	<NAME> , motionless , her arms folded , gazed forth also , though without leaning forward , whilst her companion , his body half out of the carriage , examined both sky and earth .
__label__1	Morning came ; and the little cottage was lonely and still .
__label__0	These two chains are the only ones met with in this region of circles .
__label__0	As to the invisible side , once landed , we should have the power to visit it when we pleased , and therefore we could always choose whatever time would best suit our purpose .
__label__0	`` Come , sit down , and I will tell you a curious episode in this history .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> ’ t like the boy. ’ ‘ What do you say to his master ? ’ ‘ I say that I think he ’ s bespoke. ’ <NAME> finished putting the hair carefully back over the misshapen shoulders , and then lighted a candle .
__label__1	‘ Left the house early this morning , without the slightest previous communication with me , ’ replied <NAME> .
__label__0	I said , no less amazed and stupefied than himself .
__label__0	We are still going up . ''
__label__0	His master 's last exploit , the consequences of which he ignored , enchanted him .
__label__0	`` Well then , '' he resumed , `` seeing that these bright streaks invariably start from a certain point to radiate in all directions , why not suppose them to be streams of lava issuing from the crater and flowing down the mountain side until they cooled ? ''
__label__1	“ But my dear young friend , ” said <NAME> , “ you must be hungry , you must be exhausted .
__label__1	<NAME> was there , and had his usual effect upon me .
__label__0	said <NAME> , who had made up his mind quickly ; and with his active imagination he saw the chance of safety .
__label__0	A large bird of great breadth of wing , clearly visible , approached , hovering over us .
__label__0	Unfortunately the interesting account of this crossing of <NAME> , never before accomplished by a <NAME> , has not been separately published , but is buried in a book which it is almost impossible to obtain , `` The Transactions of the <NAME> of <NAME> . ''
__label__1	Everybody else quickly vanishes too .
__label__0	As soon as the quartermaster was brought into the presence of <NAME> , his keepers withdrew .
__label__0	In spite of all he could do , he felt excited .
__label__1	The men obeyed , and the two were left alone together .
__label__1	‘ I tell you I have a presentiment that it must be a girl , ’ returned <NAME> .
__label__0	He , therefore , begged them not to be disturbed by her presence , but to take advantage of it to make known all their wants and longings .
__label__1	I had lapsed into a stupid state ; but I was recovering a little and looking forward to <NAME> , albeit <NAME> loomed behind him .
__label__0	romance , which was published at <NAME> under the title of We shall see whether there was any room for doubt that the adventures of this hero of romance were imaginary .
__label__1	Seeing that he was up and dressed , and that the room appeared to have been occupied ever since she quitted it on the previous evening , she stopped short , in some embarrassment .
__label__1	I am more important to my sister than he thinks .
__label__0	you will soon get over that , <NAME> , ” said <NAME> .
__label__1	Mr <NAME> lived in a street in the <NAME> ’ s <NAME> , which had set off from that thoroughfare with the intention of running at one heat down into the valley , and up again to the top of <NAME> ; but which had run itself out of breath in twenty yards , and had stood still ever since .
__label__0	All that day , and night , too , they traveled on at the rate of six miles an hour .
__label__0	The <NAME> , then , had not been observed on her arrival ; this was all the better .
__label__1	You 've hit the right nail upon the head , and are as safe here as you could be .
__label__1	He never made the representation , on the contrary seemed to laugh the idea to scorn ; but it did happen that , with all his pains to depreciate himself , he was always in the superior position .
__label__1	The Orfling was likewise accommodated with an inexpensive lodging in the same neighbourhood .
__label__0	The southern island was called Tavai-Pouna-Mou , “ the whale that yields the green-stones. ” Abel <NAME> sent his boats on shore , and they returned accompanied by two canoes and a noisy company of natives .
__label__1	She is in her pride tonight. ’ And as she spoke , she struck her hand upon her beautiful bosom , as though she would have beaten down herself .
__label__1	The baby-preference that even I have heard of as common among children , has never had its innocent resting-place in my breast .
__label__1	Influenced by these noble sentiments , they had even gone out of their way to purchase little luxuries in the grocery and butter line to which they were unaccustomed ; saying to one another , that if they did stretch a point , was it not for a neighbour and a friend , and for whom ought a point to be stretched if not for such ?
__label__1	Then <NAME> , instructed by <NAME> , shook hands with the four young gentlemen at Mr Feeder ’ s desk ; then with the two young gentlemen at work on the problems , who were very feverish ; then with the young gentleman at work against time , who was very inky ; and lastly with the young gentleman in a state of stupefaction , who was flabby and quite cold .
__label__0	A large broad-bladed oar was fixed behind to act as a rudder in case the wind was sufficient to require it .
__label__0	<NAME> had the recommendation of having been the residence of the incas ; but this town , situated more than 400 miles from the sea , was very distant from <NAME> , of which the importance seemed to Pizarro to be extreme .
__label__0	It was a species of the <NAME> nilotica , peculiar to <NAME> ; its beak is black , head grey and pointed , the eye surrounded by white spots , the back , wings , and tail of a greyish colour , the belly and throat white , and claws red .
__label__1	‘ —This young couple came gradually to the discovery ( made on both sides pretty equally , I think ) , that they would be happier and better , both in their present and their future lives , as affectionate friends , or say rather as brother and sister , than as husband and wife. ’ <NAME> saw a lead-coloured face in the easy-chair , and on its surface dreadful starting drops or bubbles , as if of steel .
__label__1	I was prepared for a great change in him , after what I had heard from <NAME> , but his appearance shocked me .
__label__1	The <NAME> going round with champagne , looks very much as if HE could give them a pretty good idea how people did that , if he had a mind .
__label__1	<NAME> pair for a curricle .
__label__1	‘ I knew it , <NAME> , ’ he said , looking round with an air of melancholy triumph , ‘ that society has been too much for her .
__label__1	‘ I was going there , ’ said the surly man .
__label__1	I mean to pay him too , ’ retorted <NAME> .
__label__1	It would lie in this attitude all day , with its bright specks of eyes open , wondering ( as I used to imagine ) how it came to be so small and weak .
__label__1	I have been in prison for contempt of court .
__label__0	`` Twelve o'clock , sir , '' said he .

__label__1	-- always repeating Mrs. <NAME> 's answer to us like an interpreter .
__label__0	At midnight the wind freshened , and before long the cracking of the masts , and the rattling of the cordage , and groaning of the timbers , awakened the passengers , who speedily made their appearance on deck -- at least <NAME> , <NAME> , the Major and <NAME> .
__label__0	The voyagers , aiding each other , managed to disengage themselves from the meshes of the net .
__label__1	( Gusty weather with deceitful calms .
__label__1	`` The course of study and preparation requires to be diligently pursued , '' observed my guardian with a glance at <NAME> .
__label__1	He does nothing steadily or patiently ; but equally takes things up and throws them down , and does them , or leaves them undone , without caring about them .
__label__1	All others he was willing to forget .
__label__1	<NAME> night ! ’ The unfortunate Mr Venus gives him a shake of the hand with a shake of his own head , and drooping down in his chair , proceeds to pour himself out more tea .
__label__0	<NAME> petrified thickets , long joints of fantastic architecture , were disclosed before us .
__label__1	All I mean goes beyond words , as I hope you understand and believe .
__label__1	He was an undecided , irresolute chap , who had everything but his orphan life scared out of him when he was young .
__label__1	<NAME> over , we produced a bundle of pens , a copious supply of ink , and a goodly show of writing and blotting paper .
__label__1	Now , my bachelor gatehouse is a few yards from here , and the heater is on the fire , and the wine and glasses are on the table , and it is not a stone ’ s throw from <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> , ma ’ am , ’ said a servant , as that gentleman approached the presiding goddess , with his hat in his hand , and the brigand and troubadour on either arm .
__label__0	Her instinctive kindness had doubly inspired her .
__label__1	Reluctantly , I confessed myself quite unable to answer the question .
__label__0	<NAME> ran to the piece of ice behind which he had watched the bear , then to the place of combat , where he had cut him up ; but he could not find anything .
__label__0	Now , <NAME> , don ’ t you see in all these things a malicious intention ?
__label__1	'This is my friend , <NAME> .
__label__1	Then came the night -- dark , dismal , silent night .
__label__0	He recognised himself as being personally interested in the wager , and trembled at the thought that he might have been the means of losing it by his unpardonable folly of the night before .
__label__1	Then endeavouring by every little artifice to prepare his mind for what must come , and dwelling with many fervent words upon the happy lot to which she had been removed , they told him , at last , the truth .
__label__1	His spirit shone through his son , to whom he had always preached of `` going out '' early in life and whom he made a clerk in a sharp scrivener 's office at twelve years old .
__label__0	A quantity of relics belonging to the great navigator , his charts , <NAME> 's magnificent water-colours , and the instruments and weapons of the <NAME> islanders decorated the walls .
__label__1	It is not until they are gone , that <NAME> moves .
__label__1	I am ashamed that you should have the trouble. ’ He was gone before it came to that ; but soon returned , saying exactly as before , ‘ Here ’ s your black box : ’ which he also put down with care .
__label__1	`` And now undo my bundle , <NAME> , '' said the first woman .
__label__0	In the mean time the doctor assured himself of the presence of a sufficient quantity of gas in the mixing-tank to feed the cylinder , if necessary , without there being any need of resorting for some time to the <NAME> battery .
__label__0	One would love her as the sweetest realization of a poet 's dream .
__label__0	He showed it by an observation natural enough , for that matter , to a mind unaccustomed to long stretches of careful thought : `` This darkness is absolutely killing !
__label__0	<NAME> motioned to his companion to be silent and to halt .
__label__0	74 degrees 15 minutes and W. long .
__label__1	‘ “ What is it , my dear ? ” said my uncle , looking in at the coach window .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> de do , <NAME> ? ’ said a voice beside him .
__label__1	“ As pleasantly as I could anywhere , away from you. ” “ You silly boy , ” said <NAME> , quite composedly , “ how can you talk such nonsense ?
__label__1	`` Now , I can feel what I am about '' ( as perhaps he can in two senses ) , `` Mr .
__label__1	Certainly not. ’ This dumb-show , taking place during the whole time of the invalid ’ s breakfast , and the invalid himself , pale and emaciated , performing no small part in the same , it may be fairly questioned whether at any meal , where no word , good or bad , was spoken from beginning to end , so much was expressed by gestures in themselves so slight and unimportant .
__label__0	Suddenly <NAME> , uttering a cry , pointed to the table .
__label__1	I said several times that I should like to see them at their meal ; but as the gentleman to whom I mentioned this desire appeared to be suddenly taken rather deaf , I did not pursue the request .
__label__1	Then Veneering repairs to the legal gentleman in <NAME> ’ s confidence , and with him transacts some delicate affairs of business , and issues an address to the independent electors of Pocket-Breaches , announcing that he is coming among them for their suffrages , as the mariner returns to the home of his early childhood : a phrase which is none the worse for his never having been near the place in his life , and not even now distinctly knowing where it is .
__label__0	Leaving this place , the <NAME> side of the strait is amply furnished with wood .
__label__1	He gave us to understand that in our children we lived again , and that , under the pressure of pecuniary difficulties , any accession to their number was doubly welcome .
__label__0	As the observer , however , increases his latitude either north or south , the band will gradually widen out into three detached and concentric rings , of which the innermost , dark though transparent , is 9,625 miles in breadth ; the intermediate one , which is brighter than the planet itself , being 17,605 miles broad ; and the outer , of a dusky hue , being 8,660 miles broad .

__label__0	They were not sleeping on board the brig .
__label__1	However , that ’ s neither here nor there , just now .
__label__1	A certain idle carelessness and recklessness of consistency soon comes of it .
__label__0	The horse prepared for <NAME> was brought out .
__label__1	We are always appearing , and disappearing , and swearing , and interrogating , and filing , and cross-filing , and arguing , and sealing , and motioning , and referring , and reporting , and revolving about the <NAME> and all his satellites , and equitably waltzing ourselves off to dusty death , about costs .
__label__1	Perhaps his mother now occupied a poorer seat , or possibly she had grown infirm and could not reach the church alone .
__label__1	‘ I feel it more than anybody else , ’ said Mrs. Gummidge ; ‘ I ’ m a lone lorn creetur ’ , and she used to be a ’ most the only thing that didn ’ t go contrary with me. ’ Mrs. Gummidge , whimpering and shaking her head , applied herself to blowing the fire .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> hastened towards him .
__label__1	‘ I am full of self-reproach that I might have known this and seen this , and known you and seen you , any time these dozen years , and that I never have .
__label__0	To the traveller 's usual sufferings from heat , thirst , and privations of all kinds , was now added the pain of a wound incurred in a fall from his camel .
__label__0	No words could express the horror of our situation !
__label__0	But <NAME> fancied he could see beyond the breakers a quiet basin , where the <NAME> would be in comparative safety .
__label__1	I ’ ll be judged by the gentleman himself .
__label__1	When I came here today , I thought that nothing could have wrested this confession from me .
__label__0	They hastened in great numbers towards the reefs , within six feet of which the boats must necessarily pass .
__label__1	There was <NAME> junior , also from the <NAME> Office , leaving the Tonnage of the country , which he was somehow supposed to take under his protection , to look after itself , and , sooth to say , not at all impairing the efficiency of its protection by leaving it alone .
__label__0	How A <NAME> Manages An <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> , however , had turned around to look about him on his journeyings , and turned to such good purpose that he had seen a great deal .
__label__1	This was a quieter time ; for he would come and look over the writer ’ s shoulder , and tell him mildly to observe how such a letter was turned in such a copy on the wall , praise such an up-stroke here and such a down-stroke there , and bid him take it for his model .
__label__1	<NAME> begs to know now , would it be fair to ask a professional man how -- on -- earth -- these -- people -- ever -- did -- come -- TO -- such -- A -- total smash ?
__label__0	Happily , after two long hours ' march , a beautiful country spread out before us , covered by olives , pomegranates , and vines , which appeared to belong to anybody and everybody .
__label__0	And if one of them -- <NAME> for example -- could have cast one glimpse into the projectile , what would he have seen ?
__label__0	But <NAME> , who did not want to get too far from land , was about to give the order to go up the coast , when he suddenly stopped rowing .
__label__1	Would you have the kindness to make a few plasters and put ‘ em on ?
__label__1	For a moment it had a suspicious look of suicide , arranged to counterfeit accident .
__label__1	I couldn ’ t learn a Latin Grammar when I was out , every day , with old Glubb .
__label__0	Consequently , we must not lessen her crew. ” <NAME> said nothing more , as if convinced his <NAME> was right .
__label__0	In the midst of this sterility , the rudimental carcass of the <NAME> appeared in ridges of sharply-jutting rock .
__label__0	`` You do n't mean to say , <NAME> , '' observed M'Nicholl , `` that <NAME> has seen this very one ? ''
__label__1	`` Now , do n't stare about you all the afternoon , '' cries <NAME> , shaking her head and stamping her foot as she happens to catch the glance which has been previously sounding the basin of tea , `` but take your victuals and get back to your work . ''
__label__0	He busied himself with the numerous flock confided to his care , and spared his companions the trouble of coming every two or three days to visit the corral .
__label__0	A single trait of feeling , taken from many others , will serve to show the point which this homage of a whole people to a single individual attained .
__label__1	I had never known before how short life really was and into how small a space the mind could put it .
__label__0	The <NAME> was sent to the <NAME> of <NAME> , and the <NAME> directed her course to the Cape of <NAME> , which she reached upon the 28th of February .
__label__1	They were , in truth , very rugged , noisy fellows , and quite brutal among themselves , though civil enough to their two passengers .
__label__0	At this moment we were ascending the slope which leads to the Grand-Plateau , which we soon safely reached .
__label__0	The rest of the voyage of the <NAME> was in well-known waters .
__label__1	<NAME> hung his head to hear his own words quoted by the <NAME> , and was overcome with penitence and grief .
__label__1	<NAME> cleaned down with soft soap and soda .
__label__1	<NAME> stood at <NAME> ’ s elbow .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> and his companions rushed to one of the windows -- The brig , irresistibly raised on a sort of water-spout , had just split in two , and in less than ten seconds she was swallowed up with all her criminal crew !
__label__1	In <NAME> 's name why should you kneel to me ! ” “ For the truth .
__label__0	This personage would have made a good figure to support a pendulum , for the dial would have naturally been placed on his face , and the balance-wheel would have oscillated at its ease in his chest .
__label__1	' I mean but this -- that when I left you last , I left you with a firm determination to level all fancied barriers between yourself and me ; resolved that if my world could not be yours , I would make yours mine ; that no pride of birth should curl the lip at you , for I would turn from it .
__label__1	At which astounding intelligence , <NAME> clasped her hands , fell into a tremble , and shed tears of sympathy and pleasure , like the good-natured creature she really was .
__label__1	On the shelving bank of the river , among the slimy stones of a causeway -- not the special causeway of the <NAME> , which had a landing-place of its own , but another , a little removed , and very near to the old windmill which was the denounced man ’ s dwelling-place -- were a few boats ; some , moored and already beginning to float ; others , hauled up above the reach of the tide .
__label__0	They were therefore , of modern make , easily used , and of terrible effect .
__label__1	Where there ’ s a will , there ’ s a way , you know. ’ <NAME> made no verbal answer to this remark , but putting his hand in his pocket , pulled out an old purse of solid leather , and insisted that <NAME> should borrow from him whatever he required for his present necessities .
__label__1	‘ What else do you suppose I think I am made for ?
__label__1	‘ Well , ’ he demanded after a silence , ‘ have you nothing to say to all that ? ’ ‘ It ’ s ugly , ’ returned the little man , who had risen , and was brightening his knife upon his shoe , as he leaned an arm against the wall .
__label__0	Another consequence of the error of <NAME> must be noticed here , one which , according to <NAME> , changed the whole series of his discoveries .
__label__0	The hunters were tempted by the aquatic game which took up their winter-quarters there .
__label__0	It might be thought that the marvellous poet had exhausted the resources of his imagination in the terror of such a situation ; but it was not so .
__label__1	Who , standing in the portal , received them with ghostly gloom , and all her other appliances of ceremony .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> and his companions then went off to some distance .
__label__1	‘ I never threshed a boy in a hackney coach before , ’ said <NAME> , when he stopped to rest .
__label__1	‘ There are shades in all good pictures , but there are lights too , if we choose to contemplate them , ’ said the gentleman with the merry face .
__label__1	For these particulars or generalities concerning <NAME> , Mr <NAME> was indebted in the course of the day to his own eyes and to Mrs Affery ’ s tongue .
__label__0	`` I saw -- -- '' murmured he ; `` I saw -- but do not talk -- reserve all your strength ! ''
__label__1	‘ <NAME> and unreservedly no ? ’ ‘ Yes. ’ ‘ Fledgeby , my hand. ’ Mr <NAME> took it , saying , ‘ And if we ever find out who did this , we ’ ll mark that person .
__label__0	There , on the 8th December , 1741 , this brave man and skilful explorer perished miserably .
__label__0	lat. , the <NAME> floated on the surface of the sea , approaching the <NAME> coast .
__label__1	It seems to strike your fancy , dear . '
__label__1	The idea of your coming down the Lane yourself !
__label__0	It was always rabbit , but <NAME> knew how to vary his sauces and the settlers did not think of complaining .
__label__1	I have shown you now , more plainly , that I do .
__label__1	He is fondest of her and most loving to her , when there is no creature by .
__label__1	‘ Oh , you do , do you ? ’ sneered <NAME> .
__label__1	I must wait a little longer. ” Then , when baby was expected , he says , “ She is such a cheerful , glorious housewife that I can ’ t afford to be rich yet .
__label__0	He had not much difficulty even in explaining the matter to his friends .
__label__1	Closed in by night with broad screens , and illumined only in that part , the light of the drawing-room seems gradually contracting and dwindling until it shall be no more .
__label__1	I have never swerved from my purpose for a moment ’ s space ; but if I had , one thought of her uncomplaining , suffering look , as she drooped away , or of the starving face of our innocent child , would have nerved me to my task .
__label__0	cried <NAME> with warmth ; `` there are no insuperable obstacles ; there are more or less determined minds , that is all ! ''
__label__0	`` Listen to me , <NAME> , '' I said , in a firm but temperate tone of voice , `` there must be some limit to ambition here below .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> than any prose. ’ ‘ I couldn ’ t give more than three , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	Those in the rear pushed on the foremost assailants , and it was an incessant struggle with revolvers and hatchets .
__label__1	Every time this door was opened to let a party out , the next party made a violent rush to get in ; and , as in addition to the numerous dialogues which passed between the gentlemen who were waiting to see the judge , a variety of personal squabbles ensued between the greater part of those who had seen him , there was as much noise as could well be raised in an apartment of such confined dimensions .
__label__1	A little while , and he was always in pursuit of her , and he and I crossed one another every day .
__label__0	We caught some young kids , which soon grew quite tame .
__label__1	But by this time , his doubts were all removed .
__label__0	Are you sorry that destiny has thrown us into <NAME> 's hands ? ''
__label__1	he ’ s a clever one ! ’ Mrs <NAME> went on to spread the upper sheet over the bed , and the blanket over that , and the counterpane over that , as if she had quite concluded her story .
__label__1	I am bearded and bullied by a shop-boy , and she beseeches him to pity me and remember I am ill ! ’ He fell into a paroxysm of his disorder , so violent that for a few moments <NAME> was alarmed for his life ; but finding that he began to recover , he withdrew , after signifying by a gesture to the young lady that he had something important to communicate , and would wait for her outside the room .
__label__1	It ’ s so comfortable to sit here and feel that you might be weighed , measured , magnified , electrified , polarized , played the very devil with : and never know how. ’ Nothing short of the wonderful <NAME> , combined with the occasion ( which rendered it desirable to improve and expand <NAME> ’ s mind ) , could have ever loosened his tongue to the extent of giving utterance to this prodigious oration .
__label__1	Mr Boffin , submitting to be led on tiptoe to the nursery door , looked in with immense satisfaction , although there was nothing to see but <NAME> in a musing state of happiness , seated in a little low chair upon the hearth , with her child in her fair young arms , and her soft eyelashes shading her eyes from the fire .
__label__1	I remember that I thought it , in form , more like a riding-habit with the superfluous skirt cut off , than anything else .
__label__1	You ’ re in a fright , and don ’ t know what you say or mean .
__label__0	But that is almost as much as can be said for it .
__label__1	‘ Bunsby ! ’ whispered the <NAME> , ‘ will you twice ? ’ Bunsby wouldn ’ t twice .
__label__1	It was as haggard a view of life as a man need look upon .
__label__0	Besides , <NAME> would never consent to leave his vessel .
__label__1	If ever an old gentleman had made a point of appearing in public , shaved close and clean , that old gentleman was <NAME> .
__label__1	And what ’ s this with a clarionet ?
__label__1	'What of the house , my man ; eh ? '
__label__1	Several indignant glances directed at me .
__label__0	His map shows you a <NAME> the midst of an _Arabia_ , an _Ætna_ in the centre of a _Sicily_ , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , a _Mediterranean_ , a <NAME> , a <NAME> , and a <NAME> .
__label__0	After nearly perishing for want of water , they would , at last , have to starve to death !
__label__1	My father thought you would get on more agreeably through to-morrow with me than with him , and might like to take a walk about <NAME> .
__label__1	My poor , proud friends , have looked on and approved ; and every tie between us has been deadened in my breast .
__label__1	At last , and while she had been away from home , this family had taken it ; and it was repaired and newly painted ; and there were birds and flowers about it ; and it looked very different from its old self .
__label__0	But stop -- without going out of one 's way to find a cause for war -- did not <NAME> once belong to the <NAME> ? ''
__label__1	At that time , it seemed to him , he first finally resigned the dying hope that had flickered in nobody ’ s heart so much to its pain and trouble ; and from that time he became in his own eyes , as to any similar hope or prospect , a very much older man who had done with that part of life .
__label__0	The fugitives had by this time reached the dangerous part of their voyage , and they were still twenty miles from the capital .
__label__1	Two peculiarly blunt knocks or pokes at the door , as if the dead man arriving on his back were striking at it with the soles of his motionless feet .
__label__1	' I say , ' said the other , looking over the rails , and speaking in a hoarse whisper ; 'what a time this would be for a sell !
__label__1	And what then , sir ? ’ ‘ Oh !
__label__1	I learned , that , when he was past creeping out of bed to open it , and past assuring himself of its safety by means of the divining rod I had seen him use , he had required to have it placed on the chair at the bed-side , where he had ever since embraced it , night and day .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> was some time absent , and , when he came back , showed that he had been outside by bringing with him fresh butter in a cabbage leaf , some thin slices of boiled ham in another cabbage leaf , and a little basket of water-cresses and salad herbs .
__label__0	Besides , from my post here , I can observe the face of the country , and , at the least suspicious thing I notice , I ’ ll fire a signal-shot , and with that you must rally home. ” “ Agreed ! ” said <NAME> ; and off they went .
__label__1	Let me think -- what was the year again ! '
__label__1	The old woman , with her wrinkled face close to the bars of the stove , puffing at the dull embers which had not yet caught the wood ; Squeers stooping down to the candle , which brought out the full ugliness of his face , as the light of the fire did that of his companion ; both intently engaged , and wearing faces of exultation which contrasted strongly with the anxious looks of those behind , who took advantage of the slightest sound to cover their advance , and , almost before they had moved an inch , and all was silent , stopped again .
__label__1	Go back again. ’ ‘ No mistake , ’ returned <NAME> .
__label__0	`` This sea , '' he says , `` is subject to fearful water-spouts which wreck the ships , and throw on its shores an immense number of dead fish and sometimes even large stones .
__label__0	If he had escaped in a boat made by himself , he would still less have left these indispensable and necessary articles .
__label__1	Where would you wish it taken from ? ’ she answered , turning to him with the same enforced attention as before .
__label__0	Regarding her formation , her origin , her inhabitability , they could easily tell what system _should_ be rejected and what _might_ be admitted .
__label__1	What can you possibly want to know of circuses then ?
__label__1	It was not lost upon <NAME> , who delighted in torturing him , or indeed anybody else , when he could .
__label__1	The Father of the <NAME> , even humming a tune , and wearing his black velvet cap a little on one side , so much improved were his spirits , went down into the yard , and found his old pensioner standing there hat in hand just within the gate , as he had stood all this time .
__label__1	<NAME> and louder yet , it shrieks and cries as it comes tearing on resistless to the goal : and now its way , still like the way of <NAME> , is strewn with ashes thickly .
__label__1	The sensation was like being touched in the marrow with some pungent and searching acid , it set my very teeth on edge .
__label__1	The dolls ’ dressmaker sat with her attitude unchanged , eyeing the door by which he had departed , until <NAME> pushed her bench aside and sat down near her .
__label__0	We must put ourselves on rations . ''
__label__1	When the shop was closed , he took them out of his cap , hung his cap on the chair-back , and stood turning them over before the fire .
__label__1	Did they not , sir ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , I don ’ t know that they did , ’ said Mr Boffin , curtly .
__label__0	<NAME> , master , at length gave the order to start , and the <NAME> , taking the wind under her brigantine , foresail , and standing-jib , bounded briskly forward over the waves .
__label__0	and I will show you mine ! ''
__label__1	General <NAME> will help us out . ''
__label__0	The balloon was raised to an immeasurable height .
__label__0	`` And cram all the masts into the stove , '' answered <NAME> , `` from the foretopmast to the jib-boom . ''
__label__1	‘ For this gentleman ? ’ said Mrs. Crupp , feeling in her pocket for her keys .
__label__0	<NAME> could recognize perfectly its chief features .
__label__1	And -- if you 'll excuse my saying so much -- I should hardly have thought you did yourself , sir . ''
__label__1	Under these circumstances I thought myself well rid of him for a shilling .
__label__1	I was a good-enough-tempered man once , I believe .
__label__0	Devoted from early youth to the study of natural history , <NAME> wished to become famous by the discovery of new species .
__label__1	This paper I part with now .
__label__1	And <NAME> , seeing all these things as they developed themselves , could not but wonder , anxiously , into what back corner of the genteel establishment <NAME> ’ s children would be poked by-and-by , and who would take care of those unborn little victims .
__label__0	So much effort ineffectually expended , so much labor lost .
__label__1	( to the <NAME> ) it 's no use your looking frightened ; I wo n't show you no mercy , not a ha'porth of it .
__label__1	“ <NAME> , ” said the functionary , “ I am going to send you on to <NAME> , under an escort. ” “ Citizen , I desire nothing more than to get to <NAME> , though I could dispense with the escort. ” “ Silence ! ” growled a red-cap , striking at the coverlet with the butt-end of his musket .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> instantly struck in , and begged to inquire what Mrs MacStinger meant by that , and if she knew whom she was talking to .
__label__0	He plunged the body in the hole , and thousands of little prawns removed the flesh in small pieces ; at the end of half a day the work was half finished , and the most skilful of the honorable corporation of tanners at <NAME> could not have done better .
__label__1	I ought to have more fortitude and self-command than that .
__label__1	It passed rapidly , as may be supposed , to one entranced as I was ; and yet it gave me so many occasions for knowing <NAME> better , and admiring him more in a thousand respects , that at its close I seemed to have been with him for a much longer time .
__label__1	I think he would not be much the better for the mother .
__label__0	From the description , these would appear to have been the inhabitants of the <NAME> .
__label__0	Suddenly a dreadful growling was heard , and then another report .
__label__0	The poor blacks had had no hand in the matter .
__label__1	Permit me to inquire the name of the magistrate who offers a gratuitous and unprovoked insult to a respectable person , under the protection of the bench . '
__label__1	‘ I will be your true friend always .
__label__0	We will now briefly describe the pompous entry of the <NAME> mission into <NAME> .
__label__1	When I went out to the <NAME> , I charged Mrs. Crupp with particular directions to leave the windows open , that my sitting-room might be aired , and purged of his presence .
__label__1	‘ You ’ re to wait , if you please , ’ said the tailor ’ s daughter , after a short period of absence , during which the clinking in the back-room had ceased , and been succeeded by whispering -- ‘ She won ’ t be long. ’ As she spoke , she pulled up the window-blind , and having by this means ( as she thought ) diverted <NAME> ’ s attention from the room to the street , caught up some articles which were airing on the fender , and had very much the appearance of stockings , and darted off .
__label__1	This gentleman had been discovered on reference to the Court Guide , and being then and there present , swore that the snuff-box was his , and that he had missed it on the previous day , the moment he had disengaged himself from the crowd before referred to .
__label__0	There was nothing in sight on the sea , not a sail , neither on the horizon nor near the island .
__label__0	The next day passed without any appearance of preparation for their punishment ; and this was the reason of the delay .
__label__1	After settling this question , he said a word to Mr Doyce about this Gowan -- who would have run in his head a good deal , if he had been his rival .
__label__1	And by this time the cherubic parent was so fearful of surprise , that , but for the two wooden legs on which <NAME> and <NAME> was reassuringly mounted , his conscience might have introduced , in the person of that pensioner , his own stately lady disguised , arrived at <NAME> in a car and griffins , like the spiteful Fairy at the christenings of the <NAME> , to do something dreadful to the marriage service .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> alone was kept awake by anxiety .
__label__1	We made the round of the principal theatres , too , with great delight , and saw all the plays that were worth seeing .
__label__0	They had cold water , that is to say , the most powerful sedative that can be employed against inflammation of wounds , the most efficacious therapeutic agent in grave cases , and the one which is now adopted by all physicians .
__label__1	So the day came , as all other days come to people who will only stick to reason ; and when it came , there were married in the church of the florid wooden legs—that popular order of architecture—Josiah <NAME> of <NAME> , to <NAME> eldest daughter of <NAME> of <NAME> , M.P .
__label__1	Mrs. Rouncewell 's hands unquiet , as usual , on this reference .
__label__0	`` Let us try , '' said <NAME> .
__label__0	I saluted him , and talked to him , but he made no reply , and paid no attention to me .
__label__1	I am the Relieving Officer appointed by eternal ordinance to do my work ; I am not held in estimation according as I shirk it .
__label__0	The doctor , unwilling to dwell on that subject , hastened to resume his reading .
__label__1	‘ I have been thinking , <NAME> , of placing my two boys at your school. ’ ‘ It is not for me to say so , sir , ’ replied <NAME> , ‘ but I don ’ t think you could possibly do a better thing. ’ ‘ Hem ! ’ said the other .
__label__1	<NAME> of <NAME> learnt his letters from the outsides of the shops , Mrs. Gradgrind , and was first able to tell the time upon a dial-plate , from studying the steeple clock of <NAME> <NAME> ’ s <NAME> , <NAME> , under the direction of a drunken cripple , who was a convicted thief , and an incorrigible vagrant .
__label__1	Their way lies through strange places .
__label__0	It ran far from smoothly on its worn runners ; it became harder and harder to drag it ; their path grew more difficult ; the land was of volcanic origin , and all cut up with craters ; the travellers had been compelled gradually to ascend fifteen hundred feet to reach the top of the mountains .
__label__1	‘ If it had ever been here , its ashes alone would save me from the void in which my whole life sinks .
__label__1	A special contrast <NAME> makes to the <NAME> family .
__label__1	‘ What I say is , the world ’ s wide enough for all of us ! ’ ‘ So it is , my dear , ’ said Mr Boffin , ‘ when not literary .
__label__1	When the narrative was concluded ; he raised his head hastily , as if about to speak , but on brother <NAME> resuming , fell into his old attitude again .
__label__1	Fragments of old wall , saint ’ s chapel , chapter-house , convent and monastery , have got incongruously or obstructively built into many of its houses and gardens , much as kindred jumbled notions have become incorporated into many of its citizens ’ minds .
__label__1	What should I have lost ?
__label__0	Seven days later , an ensign , named <NAME> , arrived at <NAME> , after a journey from <NAME> , which had occupied only three months and fourteen days .
__label__1	He had resumed his listening attitude , and looked intently at his questioner while the demand was made ; but it was twice repeated before he seemed to hear it , and then he only muttered that he was an old man -- an old man -- and so , dropping into a whisper , was silent again .
__label__0	This voluntary neglect of holy practices , added to the secret habits of his life , had in some sort confirmed the accusations levelled against his labours .
__label__1	It can do no good , and it might cause her to reproach herself. ’ ‘ My dearest girl , ’ urged Mr <NAME> , ‘ she ought to know it. ’ ‘ No , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , in a tone of resolute self-denial .
__label__1	`` Well , '' returns his wife , considering , `` <NAME> seems to me to be getting not a little impatient and restless .
__label__1	As we were thus conversing in a low tone while <NAME> 's sustained growl vibrated in the beam that crossed the ceiling , the room door opened , and a very pretty , slight , dark-eyed girl of twenty or so came in with a basket in her hand : whom <NAME> tenderly relieved of the basket , and presented , blushing , as “ Clara. ” She really was a most charming girl , and might have passed for a captive fairy , whom that truculent <NAME> , <NAME> , had pressed into his service .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> ? ’ repeated the other , with a wide show of his teeth .
__label__0	During the night the ship might disappear and leave for ever , and , this ship gone , would another ever return to the waters of <NAME> ?
__label__1	And yet , through the very limited means of expression that he possessed , he seemed to express kindness .
__label__1	Now then , just you hear a word or two from me .
__label__1	The terrors that had assailed me whenever Mrs. <NAME> had gone near the pantry , or out of the room , were only to be equalled by the remorse with which my mind dwelt on what my hands had done .
__label__1	My opinion is confirmed , and I reiterate my advice. ” “ I assure you , ” returned <NAME> , in the friendliest way , “ that I am sorry for it on your account , and sorry for it on the poor father 's account .
__label__0	When you have bought the property it will remain indivisible among you , and then for adequate compensation you can transfer it to one of the syndicates we represent ; but the <NAME> company will be out of it. ” It was a good proposal , at least for the moment , for in the future the delegates could quarrel among themselves for the final settlement .
__label__0	It will be understood that it is impossible to follow the details of the minute survey of the vast stretch of coast between <NAME> and <NAME> , in N. lat .
__label__1	‘ Wot a game it is ! ’ said the elder <NAME> , with a chuckle .
__label__1	They naturally supposed me to have toppled in , drunk , when I crept to the public-house it belonged to ; for I had no notion where I was , and could not articulate -- through the poison that had made me insensible having affected my speech -- and I supposed the night to be the previous night , as it was still dark and raining .
__label__0	Will you allow me to live there with them ? ''
__label__1	‘ You ’ re the wax-work child , are you not ? ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	Yes , for I am going ; ’ she said it as in prompt reply to something in his face ; ‘ to appeal to you. ’ Mr Dombey , with a slightly condescending bend of his chin that rustled and crackled his stiff cravat , sat down on a sofa that was near him , to hear the appeal .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> remained for two days upon the scene of this terrible disaster , without being able to gratify the vindictive desires of his crew .
__label__0	Sometimes one of his companions , sometimes another , sometimes all joined him .
__label__1	<NAME> ! ” I thought he never would have done wiping his feet , and that I must have gone out to lift him off the mat , but at last he came in .
__label__1	I suppose nobody ever was in such a state of ink .
__label__0	“ We are not moving an inch !
__label__1	How can you consistently ask me such a question ?
__label__1	`` And could n't <NAME> , the sergeant , see that my door was locked ? ''
__label__1	YOU must be rambling a little now , I think , if you do n't know that this is the great reason why titles will always last in the land ! ''
__label__0	It was a valuable resource of the colony , and it appeared to be inexhaustible .
__label__0	“ You perceive , ” said he , “ that the labors of this savant have been conducted with great precision ; we are moving directly toward the <NAME> region , and perhaps toward <NAME> , its capital .
__label__0	the <NAME> ! ” He could find no others in his vocabulary .
__label__1	<NAME> is the path across the fields , leading to the old house where I was a little child !
__label__0	No matter what we have been accustomed to , it is sad to bid it farewell forever .

__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> returned to the cart .
__label__1	You think so , Mr Headstone ? ’ Conscious that his pupil-teacher was looking for his answer , that he himself had suggested the boy ’ s keeping aloof from this sister , now seen for the first time face to face , <NAME> stammered : ‘ Your brother is very much occupied , you know .
__label__1	‘ I beg pardon , ’ said <NAME> , making a leg with his hat under his arm , as he addressed himself equally to both gentlemen ; ‘ a selfish precaution on my part , and not personally interesting to anybody but myself .
__label__0	The doctor made a tolerably large collection of northern birds , such as gulls , divers , molly-nochtes , and eider-ducks , which resemble ordinary ducks , with a white back and breast , a blue belly , the top of the head blue , the rest of the plumage white , shaded with different tints of green ; many of them had already plucked from their bellies the eider-down , which both the male and the female devote to lining their nests .
__label__0	We bought the various articles indispensable to a journey across the glaciers .
__label__1	Are we to be exposed to this unnatural conduct every moment of our lives ?
__label__0	Harding did not appear to be much astonished at this incident , and he cited several examples of tame apes , to whom the use of tobacco had become quite familiar .
__label__1	Outside <NAME> 's -- never by any means in it , unless called in -- was an odd-job-man , an occasional porter and messenger , who served as the live sign of the house .

__label__0	<NAME> might have cudgelled his brain for a century without hitting upon the real object which the detective had in view .
__label__1	She was truest to them in the season of trial , as all the quietly loyal and good will always be .

__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> went to take their share of the breakfast , leaving Top to watch under the windows .
__label__1	And now you see , ’ whimpered Mrs. Gradgrind , adjusting her shawls after the affectionate ceremony , ‘ I shall be worrying myself , morning , noon , and night , to know what I am to call him ! ’ ‘ Mrs .
__label__0	Another line of reasoning partially decided me .
__label__0	The Kai-Koumou drew near ; suddenly the wretched victim rose ; but a violent blow from a “ <NAME> , ” a kind of club brandished by the chief , struck her to the ground ; she fell senseless .
__label__1	Why do you take and choke a cove who has never done you any harm , neither of you ?
__label__0	“ Wherever you go I will follow you .
__label__0	He also promised the sailor that he would study that part of the channel situated between the islet and the coast , so as to ascertain if it would not be possible to make an artificial harbor there by means of dams .
__label__1	The barrier between Mr Dombey and his wife was not weakened by time .

__label__0	My uncle leaped three feet from the ground with joy .

__label__0	`` Yes , <NAME> , and if the next crop gives a proportionate yield , we shall have four thousand bushels . ''
__label__1	said I when we had sat before the fire a little while .
__label__0	First , the rocks of the coast were lost to view ; then the white crests of the cliffs were no longer to be seen ; and at last , the summit of the volcano , with its corona of vapor , was entirely out of sight .
__label__0	`` Even so , '' replied the engineer , `` you will risk depriving the colony of <NAME> of two settlers out of five . ''
__label__0	said <NAME> , moving his jaws significantly .
__label__1	This he knows , and knowing , still offers me his hand .
__label__1	Then is she kind and cruel , stately and unassuming , various , beautifully wilful .

__label__1	The slightest provocation , even being asked if there is anything he would prefer for dinner , causes him to express a wish for a separation .
__label__0	As I was wandering there along the shore , I met a band of convicts who had just escaped , and I joined myself to them .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> was calm , <NAME> more nervous , and <NAME> , a prey to sullen anger , walked to and fro on the rock .
__label__0	All we can state positively at present regarding this wonderful formation , is what I have just recorded in my note-book : the <NAME> of the <NAME> is about 5 mile wide and 70 or 80 long : it is remarkably flat and free from _debris_ , though the mountains on each side rise like walls to the height of at least 10,000 feet. -- Over the whole surface of our Earth I know of no natural phenomenon that can be at all compared with it .

__label__0	He was ready to don the diving-dress himself , or try the air apparatus , in order to reconnoiter the situation of his courageous friends .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> was compelled , therefore , to remain .
__label__1	'It 's your fancy , ' said the Jew , taking up the light and turning to his companion .
__label__1	‘ Of course ; that was to be expected .
__label__1	<NAME> is prettier , thought the good Minor Canon frequently , when taking his seat at table opposite his long-widowed mother .
__label__1	The mere sight of <NAME> in the street one day , at a considerable distance , so overpowered her milky nature , that she was fain to seek immediate refuge in a pastrycook ’ s , and there , in a musty little back room usually devoted to the consumption of soups , and pervaded by an ox-tail atmosphere , relieve her feelings by weeping plentifully .
__label__0	At length , the rapidity of the wind became excessive , approaching thirty miles per hour .
__label__1	<NAME> asserted the family gentility , and his own , by coming out in the character of the aristocratic brother , and loftily swaggering in the little skittle ground respecting seizures by the scruff of the neck , which there were looming probabilities of some gentleman unknown executing on some little puppy not mentioned .
__label__1	Have I bought and sold with you , and helped you in my way of business , schoolboy , sneak , and what not , and do you tell me to go along ?
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> and was about to add ‘ we may wait at a little distance , ’ when turning his head he found that no <NAME> was there .
__label__1	But I never own to it before her .
__label__0	“ Oh , ” cried <NAME> , his countenance full of animation , “ how I should like to thank him , he who saved you first , and who has now saved us ! ” “ Of course , my boy , ” replied <NAME> , “ so would I and all of us .
__label__1	<NAME> took no notice of either of us , but led us the way that I knew so well .

__label__1	Whether he had been attacked and defeated by <NAME> , and was ashamed to show himself after his discomfiture .
__label__0	He was , in fact , the only person that I did thoroughly understand during the whole period of my residence in this benighted island .
__label__0	On the 5th of January , <NAME> sighted the lands he had discovered in his first voyage , and between that date and the 16th he recognized various points , <NAME> , Re-union <NAME> , <NAME> , which in his estimation made more than eighty leagues of coast .
__label__1	Upon reference to the book , it appeared that the dozen secretaryships had dwindled down to one .
__label__0	Thus they maintained a profound silence during their journey to the corral .
__label__1	'At your service , ma'am , ' said <NAME> , who had been stopping outside to rub his shoes clean , and to shake the snow off his coat ; and who now made his appearance , bearing the cocked hat in one hand and a bundle in the other .
__label__1	‘ If I ask advice of any one else , it ’ s only letting in another person to be bought out , and then I shall be ruined that way , and might as well have given up the property and gone slap to the workhouse .
__label__1	After a little hesitation he opened the window , and demanded who it was .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> had therefore abandoned the mine with the absolute conviction that it did not contain another bit of coal .
__label__1	The decent hair-guard that went round his neck and took care of his decent silver watch was an object of envy to her .
__label__1	The fellow sends a most abandoned villain with one eye to construct a gateway .
__label__0	This was in reality a voyage of six hundred miles , for it was necessary to row along the coast as far as the port where the colony was established .
__label__1	'And if it is not ? '
__label__1	‘ Now let me hear some more about the <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , who was not quite right in the name yet , ‘ for I an ’ t heard half enough. ’ I couldn ’ t quite understand why <NAME> looked so queer , or why she was so ready to go back to the crocodiles .
__label__0	“ I declare my eyes are getting quite dull , my lips are drawn together , my laugh sticks in my throat ; I ’ m forgetting all my songs .
__label__1	At that time , and for a good many weeks after that time , <NAME> was constant in his visits .
__label__0	<NAME> , old dog ! ” The magnificent animal bounded barking to his master , and caresses were lavished on him .
__label__0	The engineer extended his hand to his companions , who pressed it warmly .
__label__0	And lastly , to crown the repast , <NAME> had brought out a fine bottle of <NAME> , which was found `` by chance '' in the provision-box .
__label__0	And this was the town that was foredoomed to all the horrors of fire and pillage !
__label__1	‘ Bless thee a hundred times !
__label__0	So <NAME> , cold and resolute , <NAME> , with wrath in his eyes , and two or three of his companions , such as he could induce to accompany him , walked towards <NAME> .
__label__1	If you are going to throw away a hundred guineas or so , I am as poor as a poor relation of great people usually is , and I shall be very much obliged to you , if you ’ ll throw them away upon me .
__label__1	‘ And now pray tell me something all you know , ’ said <NAME> , drawing her chair near to his , ‘ about the good dear quiet little thing and all the changes of her fortunes carriage people now no doubt and horses without number most romantic , a coat of arms of course and wild beasts on their hind legs showing it as if it was a copy they had done with mouths from ear to ear good gracious , and has she her health which is the first consideration after all for what is wealth without it Mr F. himself so often saying when his twinges came that sixpence a day and find yourself and no gout so much preferable , not that he could have lived on anything like it being the last man or that the previous little thing though far too familiar an expression now had any tendency of that sort much too slight and small but looked so fragile bless her ? ’ Mr F. ’ s <NAME> , who had eaten a piece of toast down to the crust , here solemnly handed the crust to <NAME> , who ate it for her as a matter of business .
__label__1	And she spoke the truth .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> , my amiable subject , you will get your money .
__label__1	`` By my soul , I thought him the worst-looking dog I had ever beheld when he was telling me to take the turning to the right .
__label__0	He was like a body without a soul .
__label__1	But I , misled by the action , and confused by the occasion , shook hands with him with every testimony of warm affection .
__label__0	<NAME> and the <NAME> had commenced examining the floor , previous to operating on the bottom light .
__label__1	' I tossed off the clothes , ' said <NAME> , throwing away the table-cloth , and looking very hard at the cook and housemaid , 'got softly out of bed ; drew on a pair of -- ' 'Ladies present , <NAME> , ' murmured the tinker . '
__label__0	The atmosphere was clear , the temperature was even , and the thermometer had indeed gone up to two or three degrees above freezing-point .
__label__1	BEFORE leaving <NAME> , I devoted one day to an excursion to <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ That is as much as to say that you had rather not accept the place , and that you consider fifteen shillings a week too little , ’ said Mr Gregsbury , ringing .
__label__0	But I could not act otherwise .
__label__1	‘ This is very kind of you , <NAME> ’ r <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	Finding the impossibility of rallying his squadron , he sailed along the west coast of <NAME> , as far as the strait which was soon to be called <NAME> ' <NAME> , and penetrated as far as the <NAME> of <NAME> .
__label__1	He was turning out of the gateway when he accidently stumbled against a tall man wrapped in a cloak , who was at that moment coming out of the inn door .
__label__0	The ice , which was drifting down behind it , pressed it still closer , and kept it motionless , as though it had been stranded .
__label__1	`` If it is not being troublesome , '' said we .
__label__1	Dear me , where is she ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , my dear ! ’ cried <NAME> , ‘ where are you ?
__label__1	‘ And what , ’ said <NAME> , looking at the confusion about him , ‘ what do you mean by moving the goods ? ’ ‘ That I have bought ‘ em , <NAME> , ’ rejoined <NAME> .
__label__0	“ My dear Mary , ” replied <NAME> , “ you have not the least doubt , have you , that Captain Grant reached the <NAME> continent after his shipwreck ? ” “ No , <NAME> Paganel. ” “ Well , granting that , what became of him ?
__label__1	I ’ ll think well of it. ’ Their walk was almost a silent one afterwards , until it ended at the school-house .
__label__0	How could her feet , bleeding under that forced march , have carried her thither ?
__label__0	Discovery of the <NAME> -- Exploration of the <NAME> shore of <NAME> -- From thence to Behring Straits -- <NAME> to the <NAME> Group -- History of <NAME> -- Death of <NAME> -- Return of the <NAME> to <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> had been looking for us .
__label__0	look ! ” “ Letters ! ” Yes ; there , indeed , could be descried , with perfect precision of outline , some letters carved on the rock .
__label__1	At last <NAME> pledged himself to betray no further curiosity , and they walked on : both ladies giggling very much , and declaring that they never had seen such a wicked creature in all their born days -- never .
__label__0	Nevertheless , and notwithstanding these considerations , <NAME> 's mode of life may well astonish one .

__label__0	“ The very name Alps gives plenty of room for reflection. ” “ It is not quite so big as it sounds , my dear <NAME> .
__label__1	And wot other man can say the same , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Vell , there ’ s somethin ’ in that , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ There is no air here , ’ said the man faintly .
__label__1	‘ I really , ’ said Mr Toots , ‘ in this house , where whatever was done to me in the way of -- of any mental confusion sometimes -- which is of no consequence and I impute to nobody -- I was always treated like one of <NAME> ’ s family , and had a desk to myself for a considerable period -- can -- not -- allow -- my friend <NAME> to be -- ’ Mrs <NAME> suggested ‘ married. ’ ‘ It may not be inappropriate to the occasion , or altogether uninteresting , ’ said Mr Toots with a delighted face , ‘ to observe that my wife is a most extraordinary woman , and would do this much better than myself -- allow my friend <NAME> to be married -- especially to -- ’ <NAME> suggested ‘ to <NAME> Blimber. ’ ‘ To Mrs Feeder , my love ! ’ said Mr Toots , in a subdued tone of private discussion : “ ‘ whom God hath joined , ” you know , “ let no man ” -- don ’ t you know ?
__label__1	Excuse me if I recommend you not to chafe so much , not to be so impetuous , not to wear yourself out so .
__label__1	Nevertheless , his dignity gets over it after stopping to refit , and he goes on with my Lady for <NAME> , lying only one night in <NAME> on the way to <NAME> .
__label__1	Upon which law-writer there was an inquest , and which law-writer was an anonymous character , his name being unknown .
__label__0	And yet he was prepared to go still further in disinterestedness .
__label__1	Now -- shall I take you in ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , uncle , ’ said <NAME> , a little flurried , as people much more conversant with society often are , when they are about to enter a room full of strangers , and have had time to think of it previously , ‘ are there any ladies here ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , shortly , ‘ I don ’ t know any. ’ ‘ Must I go in immediately ? ’ asked <NAME> , drawing back a little .
__label__0	His eyes wandered from where the tail of the <NAME> , now a zodiacal constellation , was scarcely visible above the waters , to where the stars of the southern hemisphere were just breaking on his view .
__label__0	At last they had arrived in those rich and wonderful countries .
__label__0	They surely did not start on a voyage which might be prolonged to an indefinite time without a proper supply of provisions !
__label__0	<NAME> to-night , then , till to-night !
__label__1	Oliver ate his share , and the Jew then mixed him a glass of hot gin-and-water : telling him he must drink it off directly , because another gentleman wanted the tumbler .
__label__1	But , the friendly dawn appearing at last , and the rush-candles of the village guttering out , the people happily dispersed , and <NAME> came down bringing his life with him for that while .
__label__1	Everything had its appointed place and its appointed time .
__label__1	Accordingly , with a clean white apron tied over her gown , and her curl-papers tucked up under a straw bonnet , -- both articles of dress being provided from the <NAME> 's inexhaustible stock , -- <NAME> prepared to issue forth on her errand .
__label__1	I am going away again .
__label__1	‘ Well ; let it be so. ’ Newman , who had stood during the foregoing conversation with his back planted against the door , ready to oppose any egress from the apartment by force , if necessary , resumed his seat with much satisfaction ; and as the water in the kettle was by this time boiling , made a glassful of spirits and water for <NAME> , and a cracked mug-full for the joint accommodation of himself and <NAME> , of which the two partook in great harmony , while <NAME> , leaning his head upon his hand , remained buried in melancholy meditation .
__label__1	Mr <NAME> said , or rather twitched out of himself in small pieces by the shirt-collar , that <NAME> having completely used up her place in the country , and also her house at <NAME> , and being , of course , unable , don ’ t you see , to remain in <NAME> when there wasn ’ t a soul there , and not feeling herself this year quite up to visiting about at people ’ s places , had resolved to have a touch at <NAME> , where a woman like herself , with a proverbially fine appearance , and with no nonsense about her , couldn ’ t fail to be a great acquisition .
__label__0	<NAME> himself met with no better success in 1536 in the <NAME> ( Gulf of <NAME> ) .
__label__1	<NAME> , reassured , falls to rubbing his legs .
__label__1	‘ The horse-road ? ’ ‘ Here ’ s a smart lad for you ! ’ cried the Captain eyeing him sternly , ‘ as don ’ t know his own native alphabet !
__label__0	“ You think that they will march on to <NAME> ? ” “ I fear so , ” replied <NAME> .
__label__1	But if I tell you that the lightest touch of your hand makes my blood cold with antipathy ; that from the hour when I first saw and hated you , to now , when my instinctive repugnance is enhanced by every minute ’ s knowledge of you I have since had , you have been a loathsome creature to me which has not its like on earth ; how then ? ’ He answered with a faint laugh , ‘ Ay !
__label__1	If it is any comfort to you to know what plans I may work out by keeping myself strictly respectable in the scale of society , these are the plans at present occurring to me .
__label__1	‘ Yes , ma ’ am , ’ replied <NAME> , colouring deeply , for the young ladies had collected about her , and she was the centre on which all eyes were fixed .
__label__0	The comparison of our chart with that of the strait as laid down by <NAME> will suffice to show how much he left to be done . ''
__label__1	Are we never to be permitted to forget ?
__label__0	While the boring went on in the flank of <NAME> , the workmen were busy at the second foundry .
__label__1	The bare walls had been coloured green , evidently by an unskilled hand , and were poorly decorated with a few prints .
__label__1	There is exceedingly mild porter , sir , in the immediate vicinity , and the contingent advantages are extraordinary. ’ ‘ What ’ s the rent ? ’ said the single gentleman .
__label__0	“ Hang it ! ” cried the sailor .
__label__1	‘ On my Me -- on my fallen life ! ’ returned the other , in the same low voice , but with a deeper stress on his words than he had yet seemed capable of giving them .
__label__0	`` I know it , <NAME> , '' answered the doctor , `` and I only speak of it on account of its connection with the search for <NAME> .
__label__1	And he wondered about it , in some broken expressions , several times , in the short remainder of our walk ; and only seemed to forget it when the light of fire and candle shone upon us , seated warm and merry , at table .
__label__1	‘ Twas evident she knew not of the disaster .
__label__0	For four days they advanced in that way , until July 23d , when they reached <NAME> , in <NAME> 's <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> was forced to guide himself by points which he selected at a distance ; sometimes he fixed upon a hill bristling with peaks ; sometimes on a vast iceberg which pressure had raised above the plain .
__label__0	The shed was closed on all sides and only one opening left , to which the natives crowded with the wares they wished to exchange .
__label__1	His manner was grave , but not coarse , and derived some dignity from a certain repressed dislike of the tone of the conversation .
__label__1	I couldn ’ t think of your not being here to receive Mr Clennam , my dear , especially this afternoon .
__label__0	“ And who would it be ?
__label__1	How they affected my aunt , nobody knew ; for immediately upon the separation , she took her maiden name again , bought a cottage in a hamlet on the sea-coast a long way off , established herself there as a single woman with one servant , and was understood to live secluded , ever afterwards , in an inflexible retirement .
__label__0	This conversation between the officers of the <NAME> was kept up until nearly one in the morning .
__label__0	“ Decidedly , I have not your legs , my lad , ” said the engineer , panting .
__label__0	The raft , at times , caught in certain whirlpools , and rushed forward , yet turned on itself all the time .
__label__1	Respecting his legs now -- ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , certainly , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	Who gave you that name ? ’ With a returning suspicion that something might have betrayed him to her , he answered , interrogatively , ‘ My godfathers and my godmothers , dear love ? ’ ‘ Pretty good ! ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ If she don ’ t like it , Mr Dombey , she must be taught to lump it. ’ The good lady apologised immediately afterwards for using so common a figure of speech , but said ( and truly ) that that was the way she reasoned with ‘ em .
__label__1	It being necessary to take soundings every minute , and to feel the way with the greatest caution , Mr Wegg ’ s attention was fully employed .
__label__1	He did not answer , and was to all appearances asleep .
__label__1	They kept him in a dark place , like a cheese , until he had the full <NAME> flavour and blue-mould upon him .
__label__0	He was left there to die without being put out of his suffering , and <NAME> , fastened to a <NAME> ’ s saddle , was obliged to follow the detachment on foot .
__label__0	Besides , on this level , so well chosen , the cable is never so deeply submerged as to cause it to break .
__label__1	`` This is my lodger , <NAME> , '' says <NAME> , nodding at her .
__label__0	“ Indeed , <NAME> , ” replied <NAME> , “ I know few islands without some tale of the kind appertaining to them , and the romance of your immortal countryman , <NAME> , has been often enough realized before his day. ” “ Monsieur Paganel , ” said <NAME> , “ may I ask you a question ? ” “ Two if you like , my dear young lady , and I promise to answer them. ” “ Well , then , I want to know if you would be very much frightened at the idea of being cast away alone on a desert island. ” “ I ? ” exclaimed <NAME> .
__label__0	But the colonists were yet able to follow its descent through the waves .
__label__1	“ Now , <NAME> , ” said he , “ be careful. ” “ I will , sir , ” I returned .
__label__0	For why should it interest him ?
__label__0	Involuntarily the names of <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , rise before the mind , and we seek vainly for <NAME> ' vessel or the `` clipper '' of the <NAME> .
__label__0	`` The famous Djezar-Pasha caused a bath to be erected above the principal spring .
__label__0	They encounter <NAME> in <NAME> ; bushrangers in <NAME> ; and <NAME> in <NAME> .
__label__1	She derives so much satisfaction from the pursuit , that she enters on it regularly from that time ; and brings daily in her little basket , various choice condiments selected from the scanty stores of the deceased owner of the powdered head and pigtail .
__label__1	Where are my friends ? ’ ‘ You ain ’ t got no friends .
__label__1	He wore an odd little sleek crisp flaxen wig , setting very close to his head : which wig , it is to be presumed , was made of hair , but which looked far more as though it were spun from filaments of silk or glass .
__label__0	They found neither wood nor water .
__label__1	Who loosed it ? ’ <NAME> , being on his road to the <NAME> , approaches it by way of <NAME> .
__label__0	`` The rice consumed at <NAME> is not indigenous to the soil , but still it might be successfully cultivated in the low lands .
__label__1	She dismissed the messenger to his own devices , and rode away to her old home .
__label__1	‘ I suppose so , ’ said <NAME> , looking at <NAME> .
__label__0	`` We have to think so , Dr. Clawbonny , because <NAME> is just ; but I have often visited these coasts , and I am always saddened at the sight of its gloomy loneliness ; the capes , promontories , and bays ought to have more attractive names , for <NAME> and <NAME> Desolation are not of a sort to cheer sailors . ''
__label__1	The old housekeeper dying at the end of that time , <NAME> promoted <NAME> to the situation , on condition of her marrying <NAME> at once , which she did without a murmur .
__label__0	`` And I answer in the negative , '' continued <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ What say you , <NAME> ? ’ <NAME> scratched his head and shook it , but said nothing at all .
__label__0	I , <NAME> , can not die , for , as I have regulated time , time would end with me !
__label__1	These inquiries proved very harassing to R. W. who , besides being a little disturbed by wine , was in perpetual terror of committing himself by the utterance of stray words that would betray his guilty foreknowledge .
__label__0	<NAME> , however , would not allow himself to be disheartened ; he went back to <NAME> , and spared neither pains nor expense to make a thorough investigation of the whole seaboard .
__label__0	The moon rose above the horizon .
__label__0	Their acquaintance with iron and its use , for which they were not indebted to <NAME> , is another proof that this people had known the <NAME> , to whom the discovery of the group is probably due .
__label__1	Seeing the faint light of early day without , the girl rose to undraw the curtain .
__label__1	‘ The young lady might think herself well off , ’ she observed , ‘ to have such a beau .
__label__1	The venerable cathedral towers , and the old jackdaws and rooks whose airy voices made them more retired than perfect silence would have done ; the battered gateways , one stuck full with statues , long thrown down , and crumbled away , like the reverential pilgrims who had gazed upon them ; the still nooks , where the ivied growth of centuries crept over gabled ends and ruined walls ; the ancient houses , the pastoral landscape of field , orchard , and garden ; everywhere -- on everything -- I felt the same serener air , the same calm , thoughtful , softening spirit .
__label__1	‘ The race that one has started in , ’ said he .
__label__0	“ Why ? ” “ Because the sands are still more dangerous than the rocks , for they swallow up everything that is thrown on them .
__label__0	A great part of the population came out to meet the <NAME> , and more than one of them went as far as the middle of the bay in his kayak , fifteen feet long and two broad at the widest part .
__label__0	`` By the bye , M. Aronnax you are not afraid of sharks ? ''
__label__0	In reality the main river still bore the name of the <NAME> , and it is only after the junction of the <NAME> that it takes the name which has made it celebrated among the rivers of the globe .
__label__0	We stopped to take the hand of every caboceer , ( which , as their household suites occupied several spaces in advance , delayed us long enough to distinguish some of the ornaments in the general blaze of splendour and ostentation ) .
__label__0	Then the two friends , followed by their foremen , reached <NAME> , where they found a vessel starting for <NAME> .
__label__1	There was an alacrity in his manner , too , which was equally unaccountable ; every time his eyes met those of <NAME> or <NAME> , he smirked and grinned ; once , <NAME> could have sworn , he saw him wink .
__label__0	<NAME> , with radiant face , had assumed her wedding-dress .
__label__0	The <NAME> who was taken was recognized by the surgeon as the chief who had so generously assisted them during the storm .
__label__1	‘ What shall I get by it ? ’ asked the driver .
__label__0	Twelve hundred melting-troughs were simultaneously opened and twelve hundred fiery serpents crept toward the central well , unrolling their incandescent curves .
__label__1	His nose once brought to it , shall be held to it by these hands , Mr Venus , till the sparks flies out in showers. ’ With this agreeable promise <NAME> stumped out , and shut the shop-door after him .
__label__0	It would be such an earthquake as had never quaked before !
__label__1	‘ Well , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	I could have wished my noble friend had been alive to have seen my management of this case .
__label__1	As the tow-rope was slackened by a turn of the stream and dipped into the water , such a confusion stole into her mind that she thought she saw the forms of her dead children and dead grandchildren peopling the barge , and waving their hands to her in solemn measure ; then , as the rope tightened and came up , dropping diamonds , it seemed to vibrate into two parallel ropes and strike her , with a twang , though it was far off .
__label__0	In fact , three questions only of importance were asked him by <NAME> , and these were : “ Did not a captain of the woods named Torres belong to your party a few months ago ? ” “ Yes. ” “ At that time had he not one intimate friend among his companions who has recently died ? ” “ Just so ! ” “ And the name of that friend was ? ” “ Ortega. ” This was all that <NAME> had learned .
__label__0	`` Will the curve please you , sir ? ''
__label__1	I took a sudden resolution .
__label__1	How much of the practice I have just reduced to precept , I owe to <NAME> , I will not repeat here .
__label__1	The Captain never dreamed that in the event of his being pounced upon by <NAME> , in his walks , it would be possible to offer resistance .
__label__1	You mind what I say , do you ? ’ ‘ I hear , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	Between you and me , I think there is some danger of my being just enough soured not to be able to do that. ’ ‘ To do what ? ’ asked <NAME> .
__label__0	`` Was it not good to have proved by experience the possibility of rising in the air ? ''
__label__1	‘ And that ? ’ inquired the dwarf , wheeling round and pointing straight at me .
__label__1	Now , whether she became my lodger , <NAME> , with any deliberate intention then of doing this deed and blinding me , I give no opinion on ; but she lived in my house in that capacity at the time that she was hovering about the chambers of the deceased <NAME> with a view to a wrangle , and likewise persecuting and half frightening the life out of an unfortunate stationer . ''
__label__1	Let me but leave the good name to my three daughters , and that is enough for me ; I am not a self-seeker .
__label__1	But , <NAME> , I do , notwithstanding , perceive the state of -- of things -- with <NAME> .
__label__0	He took nothing away , wishing the guilty to inherit the riches of the innocent .
__label__1	When he was freshest and truest , he loved me .
__label__0	The hissing of the water rent the air with a deafening sound , and the vapour , blown by the wind , fell in rain upon the sea .
__label__0	The minerals were on the surface , and had only to be picked up from the ground .
__label__1	You need n't bring any , William. ” I went on with my breakfast , and <NAME> continued to stand over me , staring fishily and breathing noisily , as he always did .
__label__0	His tropical sun is waiting for him .
__label__0	twenty-six years '' should be `` describes a circle in about twenty-six thousand years '' as in the <NAME> version .
__label__1	What has been my history , that I should be at the pains of entreating either them or you not to have it so !
__label__1	And off _its_ head comes .
__label__1	Mr <NAME> was well to do , and stood very high in Mr Podsnap ’ s opinion .
__label__1	The hideous small boy , on the contrary , whenever he hits <NAME> , blows a whistle of triumph through a jagged gap , convenient for the purpose , in the front of his mouth , where half his teeth are wanting ; and whenever he misses him , yelps out ‘ Mulled agin ! ’ and tries to atone for the failure by taking a more correct and vicious aim .
__label__1	<NAME> was by , interested even to agitation ; and the two presented a singular sight : her face was flushed and anxious , and her fingers twining in among ours so closely as to follow every motion , but so slightly as not to embarrass them ; while <NAME> stood attentive , his head a little aside , his face turned up , his left hand grasping mine , and his right held out : at every motion of my fingers his countenance betokened keen attention ; there was an expression of anxiety as he tried to imitate the motions ; then a smile came stealing out as he thought he could do so , and spread into a joyous laugh the moment he succeeded , and felt me pat his head , and <NAME> clap him heartily upon the back , and jump up and down in her joy .
__label__1	But his father -- and his uncle -- were the most profligate coachmen that ever sat upon a box . ''
__label__1	The old Instrument-maker , seated in a corner between <NAME> and <NAME> , and nodding at <NAME> , who was looking on , all smiles and delight , answered the Captain thus : ‘ <NAME> , my dear boy , although I have heard something of the changes of events here , from my pleasant friend there -- what a pleasant face she has to be sure , to welcome a wanderer home ! ’ said the old man , breaking off , and rubbing his hands in his old dreamy way .
__label__1	I am in now , as one of the regulars. ’ ‘ Oh !
__label__1	She stops him as he is moving out of the room by asking , `` This is the notice I was to receive ?
__label__0	We can reach the <NAME> only by a fall , and we do n't fall .
__label__0	But <NAME> 's charts and the `` Elements of <NAME> '' by <NAME> did not tally as to their situation .
__label__0	<NAME> , who had silently assisted at the ceremony , could not conceal the horror with which it inspired him .
__label__1	`` I do n't know , my <NAME> ; I can scarcely hope so .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> passed , and <NAME> passed , and the sedan passed , and the bodyguard of specials passed , and <NAME> was still responding to the enthusiastic cheers of the mob , and waving his hat about as if he were in the very last extreme of the wildest joy ( though , of course , he had not the faintest idea of the matter in hand ) , when he was suddenly stopped by the unexpected appearance of <NAME> and <NAME> .
__label__0	As fate has cast me upon these shores , I shall not leave without having completely examined them . ''
__label__0	The wind , should it rise , would blow there as it did here , only less strongly at this point , if it came from the east .
__label__0	Just a minute ago , when I was trying to sleep , several facts occurred to my memory , that make me hope it will , for we are in the region of great electrical tempests .
__label__1	The visitor offered his hand .
__label__1	There was a stage , that evening , when she spoke collectedly of what had happened , though with a certain terrible vivacity .
__label__1	Sit down , you dancing , prancing , shambling , scrambling poll-parrot !
__label__1	‘ You ’ re a dutiful and affectionate little boy , you are , ain ’ t you , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ to come a-bonnetin ’ your father in his old age ? ’ ‘ <NAME> should I know who you wos ? ’ responded the son .
__label__1	P'raps they would n't do it if I wos to go myself .
__label__0	We may be very near the ocean . ''
__label__1	How much greater cause she had for weeping now !
__label__1	She ’ s well to do now , and a widow .
__label__1	You address nothing in my breast , you touch nothing there .
__label__1	Neither did he call it a curious coincidence that true patriotism was _his_ only motive too .
__label__1	‘ There ’ s inconveniency in it , but the novelty gives it a sort of relish , too ! ’ <NAME> !
__label__0	<NAME> and <NAME> , overlook the men . ''
__label__0	`` That is all very well , '' said <NAME> , who had not yet spoken , `` and I 'm much obliged to the doctor for his information ; but we are talking as if we had to endure torrid heats .
__label__0	By <NAME> Day everything was in readiness for immediate departure .
__label__0	During the ten days that <NAME> and his companions were passing through this part of the country they were very badly treated , and had it not been for their own store of biscuits , they must have died of starvation .
__label__1	‘ But I am acquainted with these chaps , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	I would rather you didn ’ t. ’ ‘ Demmit , <NAME> , can ’ t you -- ’ began <NAME> .
__label__1	He will be no worse off than he was , you know .
__label__0	At the end of 1819 they left <NAME> with a few companions , and entered the <NAME> desert .
__label__0	I then thought that the balance-wheel might accomplish this , and I succeeded in regulating the movement !
__label__0	<NAME> knew all these details .
__label__0	On this island pigs were to be found , but no `` _pounamon_ '' the green jade which the <NAME> use in the manufacture of their most valuable tools ; strange to say , however , jade is to be found on the southern island , but there are no pigs .
__label__0	Of the liquid surface of the sea there was no longer a glimpse .
__label__1	There were other times when she would come to a sudden check in this tone and in all her many tones , and would seem to pity me .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> ’ s address was responded to , with a shout of admiration , and the health of the interesting martyr was drunk in a most enthusiastic manner ; for this , the martyr returned thanks , and proposed their visitor , <NAME> -- a gentleman whom he had not the pleasure of an intimate acquaintance with , but who was the friend of <NAME> , which was a sufficient letter of recommendation to any society of gentlemen whatever , or wherever .
__label__1	I know what that is .
__label__1	They were , and they are , quite ignorant of our history. ’ ‘ So much the worse , ’ retorted <NAME> , determined not to admit anything in extenuation , ‘ for then you have no excuse .
__label__1	To hear him laugh and see the broad good nature of his face then , one might have supposed that he had not a care in the world , or a dispute , or a dislike , but that his whole existence was a summer joke .
__label__1	Her fears for <NAME> would have been more powerful inducements to recoil while there was yet time ; but she had stipulated that her secret should be rigidly kept , she had dropped no clue which could lead to his discovery , she had refused , even for his sake , a refuge from all the guilt and wretchedness that encompasses her -- and what more could she do !
__label__1	`` Home , for good and all .
__label__1	They have all been witnesses of it , from day to day , from night to night , from week to week , from month to month .

__label__0	The anchors caught in a low tree and the sportsman fastened it securely .
__label__0	`` Yes , '' he answered , `` when it 's too late . ''
__label__0	At the end of a month , the sheds being finished , three men were told off to remain at <NAME> .
__label__1	He writes to this purpose on his slate , and Mrs. Rouncewell with a heavy heart obeys .
__label__0	Partes a terre , deux matelots et le Capitaine Grant ont atteint l ’ ile <NAME> -- ” “ Oh ! ” exclaimed <NAME> .
__label__0	`` You will be starved to death , '' she said .
__label__0	The island was from eight to ten miles in circumference , no more ; and , according to their calculation , it was very near the Pole , if indeed the axis of the world did not pass exactly through it .
__label__0	Nevertheless , the calculations of J. T. <NAME> were correctly founded , and would have produced the desired results if by some inexplicable distraction they had not been nullified by an error at the outset .
__label__1	Why have I never heard until the day before yesterday of your suffering yourself to be cooped up in jail ?
__label__1	<NAME> grass and rank weeds straggled over all the marshy land in the vicinity .
__label__0	`` It is a calculation the converse of the differential , '' replied <NAME> seriously .
__label__1	“ Therese ! ” she cries , in her shrill tones .
__label__1	‘ There is no date to that , is there ? ’ inquired a juror .
__label__1	<NAME> , Mrs. Smithie , and the <NAME> , ’ was the next announcement .
__label__0	Some fleshy parts still remained which bore the impress of the cannibal 's teeth .
__label__1	But he had a bold spirit , and he ran a little wild and went for a soldier .
__label__0	In fact , the longer the needle of a dial is , the more easily can the movement of its point be followed .
__label__1	It happened that an old lord of great family , who was going to marry a young lady of no family in particular , came with the young lady , and the young lady ’ s sister , to witness the ceremony of trying on two nuptial bonnets which had been ordered the day before , and <NAME> announcing the fact , in a shrill treble , through the speaking-pipe , which communicated with the workroom , <NAME> darted hastily upstairs with a bonnet in each hand , and presented herself in the show-room , in a charming state of palpitation , intended to demonstrate her enthusiasm in the cause .
__label__0	Her sobs and cries filled the air .
__label__0	there are only strangers here , ” said the young mulatto , clapping her hands .
__label__1	<NAME> and despised by even the few who are cognisant of its miserable and disgraceful existence , stifled by the very filth it so profusely scatters , rendered deaf and blind by the exhalations of its own slime , the obscene journal , happily unconscious of its degraded state , is rapidly sinking beneath that treacherous mud which , while it seems to give it a firm standing with the low and debased classes of society , is nevertheless rising above its detested head , and will speedily engulf it for ever. ’ Having delivered this manifesto ( which formed a portion of his last week ’ s leader ) with vehement articulation , the editor paused to take breath , and looked majestically at <NAME> .
__label__0	What was their disappointment , when , after trudging nearly two miles , having reached an elevated point composed of slippery rocks , they found themselves again stopped by the sea .
__label__1	The first goblin was a most astonishing leaper , and none of the others could come near him ; even in the extremity of his terror the sexton could not help observing , that while his friends were content to leap over the common-sized gravestones , the first one took the family vaults , iron railings and all , with as much ease as if they had been so many street-posts .
__label__1	He softly reclosed the door .
__label__1	‘ If you ’ re in arnest , you see , my lad , ’ said the <NAME> , ‘ you ’ re a object of clemency , and clemency is the brightest jewel in the crown of a <NAME> ’ s head , for which you ’ ll overhaul the constitution as laid down in <NAME> , and , when found , that is the charter as them garden angels was a singing of , so many times over .
__label__0	As it was not yet time to go north , <NAME> made for the <NAME> , _viâ_ the <NAME> .
__label__1	Yet it would never do to run away from him .
__label__0	The pride of success soon dissipated our fatigue .
__label__1	‘ Death of my life , sir , it ’ s my character to be impatient ! ’ ‘ EH ! ’ cried <NAME> , astounded , and with all his colour gone in a moment .
__label__0	“ Not a drop ! ” was <NAME> ’ s answer .
__label__1	It follows naturally on the sights we have just left .
__label__1	I tell you again , <NAME> is my sister .
__label__1	Turn me in some other direction before I go. ” “ Well then !
__label__1	‘ He is shooting in <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ He ’ s certain not to be back this week , and it ’ s a chance whether he will be next ; for when <NAME> once gets out of town , he ’ s never in a hurry to come back again. ’ ‘ Out of town ! ’ said <NAME> ; ‘ dear me , how unfortunate ! ’ ‘ <NAME> ’ t go away , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ I ’ ve got a letter for you. ’ The stranger , seeming to hesitate , once more looked towards the ground , and the clerk winked slyly at <NAME> , as if to intimate that some exquisite piece of humour was going forward , though what it was <NAME> could not for the life of him divine .
__label__1	“ 'Not dead , ' said I ; 'but like to die . '
__label__1	<NAME> , <NAME> quack , Bow-wow ! ’ And then trotted silently downstairs , with his shoulders in a state of the liveliest commotion .
__label__1	‘ It ’ s my opinion , you see , ’ said <NAME> , with a delighted face , after some further rubbing of his legs , ‘ as this is along of my havin ’ played with her so much , and made believe as we was <NAME> , and <NAME> , and sharks , and every wariety of forinners -- bless you , yes ; and lions and whales , and I doen ’ t know what all ! -- when she warn ’ t no higher than my knee .
__label__1	He points it , however , by no deviation from his straightforward manner of speech , though in saying it he turns towards that part of the dim room where my Lady sits .
__label__1	I am paid for undertaking it , and I do so .
__label__1	<NAME> , my boy , <NAME> , my dear , what have you been doing ?
__label__1	We shall be able to set you to rights in a very short time , I have no doubt , ma ’ am .
__label__0	asked <NAME> , after some minutes ' silence .
__label__0	He met with no misadventure and found no suspicious traces .
__label__1	I am his friend , and you shall find me so. ’ ‘ And you will find <NAME> on the stairs , ’ remarked <NAME> .
__label__1	'That 's not the point , ' said the doctor , mysteriously .
__label__0	`` When we arrived , it seemed to us to be very low , but on approaching within a quarter of a league we saw by the great fires which were lighted along the harbours and borders of the sea , that it was inhabited , and in taking trouble to find a harbour in which to land and make acquaintance with the country , we sailed more than 150 miles in vain , so that seeing the coast trended ever southwards , we decided to turn back again . ''
__label__0	And who knows what will become of the survivor of us after a long solitude on this island ?
__label__1	His blue bag was slung over his shoulder , honest industry beamed in his eyes , a determination to proceed to <NAME> 's with cheerful briskness was indicated in his gait .
__label__1	) , I shall away betimes tomorrow morning .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> and the Captain were arguing the point , <NAME> began busying himself in making everything as comfortable as if , instead of a four days ' journey , one of four years was contemplated .
__label__1	If we understand each other now , we shall not fall out any more , perhaps .
__label__1	‘ Mr <NAME> , ’ said Mr Dombey , ‘ will you take the bottom of the table , if you please ?
__label__0	His correspondence proves that he shared the opinion of <NAME> as to the relatively short distance separating the extreme shores of the old Continent .
__label__0	`` Do you think then , sir , that these riches are lost because I gather them ?
__label__1	The gentleman walked on with them by the officer 's side ; and as many of the crowd as could achieve the feat , got a little ahead , and stared back at <NAME> from time to time .
__label__0	What is the meaning of this name `` <NAME> man 's land '' ?
__label__0	To the soup succeeded the peccaries , which <NAME> insisted on carving himself , and of which he served out monstrous portions to each of the guests .
__label__0	“ If those dresses were worn properly , ” said <NAME> , “ they might not be so ridiculous ! ” “ My dear <NAME> , ” said <NAME> , “ with your simple gown and straw hat , you are better dressed than any one of these Brazilians , with their headgear and flying petticoats , which are foreign to their country and their race. ” “ If it pleases you to think so , ” answered <NAME> , “ I do not envy any of them. ” But they had come to see .
__label__1	But you told me to prepare to be tried , and I prepared myself. ’ He drew her to nestle closer to him , and told her it would soon be over , and the truth would soon appear .
__label__1	If the change that you must see in me after so long an absence -- must see , for I , upon whom it has come by slow and hard degrees , see it and know it well -- will not move you to pity , let the knowledge that bread ; not the daily bread of the <NAME> ’ s <NAME> , which , as it is offered up in cities like this , is understood to include half the luxuries of the world for the rich , and just as much coarse food as will support life for the poor -- not that , but bread , a crust of dry hard bread , is beyond my reach today -- let that have some weight with you , if nothing else has. ’ ‘ If this is the usual form in which you beg , sir , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ you have studied your part well ; but if you will take advice from one who knows something of the world and its ways , I should recommend a lower tone ; a little lower tone , or you stand a fair chance of being starved in good earnest. ’ As he said this , <NAME> clenched his left wrist tightly with his right hand , and inclining his head a little on one side and dropping his chin upon his breast , looked at him whom he addressed with a frowning , sullen face .
__label__0	The whole city , high and low , the quays bordering the <NAME> , the ships lying in the basins , disgorged a crowd drunk with joy , gin , and whisky .
__label__1	'There ough n't to be , if there is , ' replied <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> Mr Gills to come here. ’ Mr Perch was too deferential to express surprise or recognition of the figure in the corner : and <NAME> appeared immediately .
__label__1	'This is a painful task , ' said he , 'but these declarations , which have been signed in <NAME> before many gentlemen , must be in substance repeated here .
__label__1	And what I say unto you , I say unto all , <NAME> ! ' ''
__label__1	But I want to keep you in attendance .
__label__0	Whither are we going , I ask ?
__label__0	<NAME> left fifty-six men to guard the <NAME> of <NAME> , under the command of <NAME> de <NAME> , while he returned to <NAME> , towards the beginning of April , being much hindered on the road by excessive rain .
__label__1	After groping about in the gallery for some time , attempting in the dim light to decipher the numbers on the different doors , he at length appealed to a pot-boy , who happened to be pursuing his morning occupation of gleaning for pewter .
__label__1	I reproach myself , most bitterly , for having been so unfortunate as to cause the dissension that occurred , although I did so , I assure you , most unwittingly and heedlessly. ’ ‘ Well ; that ’ s not all you have got to say surely , ’ exclaimed <NAME> as <NAME> paused .
__label__1	I meant that , I am sure , as much as I still mean it .
__label__1	‘ Ah , <NAME> -- a precious seedy-looking customer .
__label__1	Let it be a secret between you and me ; and mind you tell me everything !
__label__1	<NAME> , <NAME> ! ’ ‘ Get along with you , you wretch , ’ said the hand-maiden , obviously not ill-pleased with the compliment , however .
__label__0	<NAME> seized his hands and stopped him .
__label__1	The gaping salmon and the golden mullet lying on the slab seem to turn up their eyes sideways , as they would turn up their hands if they had any , in worshipping admiration .
__label__0	However , the temperature was not as yet much lower , and a centigrade thermometer , transported to <NAME> , would still have marked an average of ten to twelve degrees above zero .
__label__0	`` And why this powerful organisation ? ''
__label__0	What cares were lavished on him to bring him back to life !
__label__1	It was the more necessary for his spirits , because , being of a sensitive temperament , he was apt to consider it personally disgraceful to himself that his master had no clients .
__label__0	A bullet without a gun ! ''
__label__1	On the very first night of these later hours , at nine exactly , there came : not the young lady herself , but her servant , who , being closeted with brother <NAME> for some time , went away , and returned next night at the same hour , and on the next , and on the next again .
__label__0	And the <NAME> , too , his strength and patience at an end , appeared no more .
__label__0	It was a band of voters coming to the rescue of their allies , and taking the <NAME> forces in flank .
__label__1	The trial had lasted all day , and the lamps in the court were now being lighted .
__label__0	`` You know all about it , I see . ''
__label__0	However , with the fine days work had been continued .
__label__0	In the former case , they must have returned towards the corral , now without defenders , and which contained valuable stores .
__label__1	‘ We never can be here. ’ ‘ No , we never can again -- never again -- that ’ s truly said , ’ rejoined the old man .
__label__0	Well now , the man at the helm has only to give a turn at the wheel , and the <NAME> will sail as easily to <NAME> as to <NAME> ; and since it is only a pleasure trip that you are -- ” His proposal was met by such grave , disapproving shakes of the head , that he stopped short before the sentence was completed ; and <NAME> said : “ <NAME> , if we were only on a pleasure trip , I should reply , ‘ Let us all go to <NAME> together , ’ and I am sure <NAME> would not object ; but the <NAME> is going to bring back shipwrecked mariners who were cast away on the shores of <NAME> , and we could not alter such a destination. ” The <NAME> was soon put in possession of all the circumstances of the case .
__label__1	<NAME> ’ t say you are a prisoner , <NAME> !
__label__0	One must go without spirits if he expects to escape the scurvy , remain in good health , and sail far . ''
__label__1	But -- it 's a flowing so soft and pleasant through the water , p'raps , as makes me think it -- I was a thinking through my smoke just then , that we can no more see to the bottom of the next few hours than we can see to the bottom of this river what I catches hold of .
__label__1	Never ! ’ ‘ Unnecessary to pursue the subject , ’ returned <NAME> , ‘ and would not have mentioned it on any account except as supposing it a favourable and only letter of introduction but as to being fact no doubt whatever and you may set your mind at rest for the very dress I have on now can prove it and sweetly made though there is no denying that it would tell better on a better figure for my own is much too fat though how to bring it down I know not , pray excuse me I am roving off again. ’ Mr <NAME> backed to his chair in a stony way , and seated himself , as <NAME> gave him a softening look and played with her parasol .
__label__1	Her little stock of money amounted to but a few guineas .
__label__0	In the rapid flash of the lantern , he had recognised his former accomplice , <NAME> , who could not have known him , as he must have thought <NAME> long since dead .
__label__1	‘ Finching ? ’ ‘ Finching oh yes isn ’ t it a dreadful name , but as Mr F. said when he proposed to me which he did seven times and handsomely consented I must say to be what he used to call on liking twelve months , after all , he wasn ’ t answerable for it and couldn ’ t help it could he , <NAME> man , not at all like you but excellent man ! ’ <NAME> had at last talked herself out of breath for one moment .
__label__1	‘ Why should you ? ’ It was impossible to say to that sweet little surprised face , otherwise than lightly and playfully , that we must work to live .
__label__1	' I scarcely know of what , ' replied the girl .
__label__0	He did not delay , and soon the <NAME> reckoned one conquest more .
__label__0	It was a hazardous method , for , if their imprisonment lasted long , the spirit , of which they had but little , would be wanting when needed to prepare the meals .
__label__0	There would have been great laughter at the Institution , had the mistake happened there .
__label__0	They , for their part , did not dare attack the captain 's dog , `` his familiar spirit , '' as <NAME> called him .
__label__0	`` Gentlemen , '' resumed the captain , `` to-morrow I shall be dead . ''
__label__0	The whole population were immediately set to work on the fortifications .
__label__1	Sometimes , parliamentary questions were asked about it , and even parliamentary motions made or threatened about it by demagogues so low and ignorant as to hold that the real recipe of government was , How to do it .
__label__0	They were gradually sinking down .
__label__0	My worthy comrade , who gave me this cipher , who told me where I could find his old colleague , and the name under which he has been hiding himself for so many years , hardly suspects that he has made my fortune ! ” For the last time <NAME> glanced over the yellow paper , and then , after carefully folding it , put it away into a little copper box which he used for a purse .
__label__0	`` But as we manufacture air ourselves ! ''
__label__1	<NAME> told him it was between two and three .
__label__1	‘ We have fallen upon strange times , and <NAME> only knows the end of them ; but I am tired with the events of these three days , and will postpone reflection till tomorrow -- if I can. ’ Of the <NAME> for <NAME> , and the first Appearance of <NAME> upon any Stage <NAME> was up betimes in the morning ; but he had scarcely begun to dress , notwithstanding , when he heard footsteps ascending the stairs , and was presently saluted by the voices of <NAME> the pantomimist , and <NAME> , the tragedian .
__label__1	The company was not , in our sense of the term , select , for it comprehended persons of very many grades and classes ; nor was there any great display of costly attire : indeed , some of the costumes may have been , for aught I know , grotesque enough .
__label__1	‘ He doesn ’ t know what to say , ’ replied <NAME> .
__label__1	I thought it possible that I could truly love one creature in the world , and not love the rest ; I thought it possible that I could truly mourn for one creature gone out of the world , and not have some part in the grief of all who mourned .
__label__0	This was the reason why the greater part of the <NAME> islanders took to flight , headed by their chief , Too-Wit , and the <NAME> , who are the leading personages of Klock-Klock .
__label__1	`` Then I may say at once that I am glad of it , because it is on that subject that I am anxious to be understood .
__label__1	There was no wind to make a ripple on the foul water within the harbour , or on the beautiful sea without .
__label__0	`` I hope the ship will not arrive before we are ready ! ''
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> was for the most part plunged into deep gloom .
__label__1	Call him Trotwood , certainly , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> seems to have been well acquainted with the geography of the <NAME> , for he speaks of it as a Sea `` quite by itself '' and having no communication with any other .
__label__0	The ships next passed by the <NAME> of the <NAME> , the haunt of <NAME> pirates , who have even now only lately submitted to the <NAME> arms ; then by <NAME> , which had been already visited , for it was known that the eagerly sought-for Moluccas must be in its neighbourhood , whether more or less remote .
__label__1	‘ A joke is wasted upon me , sir .
__label__1	His tone is no less sorrowfully echoed by his new acquaintance .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> alighted ; knowing one or two of the soldiery there , and one of the police .
__label__1	It would be exciting to look out for wrecks. ’ ‘ But otherwise , ’ suggested <NAME> , ‘ there might be a degree of sameness in the life. ’ ‘ I have thought of that also , ’ said <NAME> , as if he really had been considering the subject in its various bearings with an eye to the business ; ‘ but it would be a defined and limited monotony .
__label__0	<NAME> that , the <NAME> was lost in the brushwood , where it was fed from some hidden source .
__label__1	‘ For why ? ’ growled <NAME> , looking at his friend for the first time .
__label__0	One of the ropes which fastened the barrels was partly unlashed and used as a cable to unite the floating apparatus with the canoe .
__label__1	Still I was forced to wait for a start , and I wasn ’ t so lucky as to get a start .
__label__1	The old man looked , irresolutely and helplessly , first at her , then to the right and left , then at her again , and shook his head .
__label__0	It was to be composed of four vessels of medium size , `` in order , '' says <NAME> , `` that they may enter everywhere and again issue forth rapidly . ''
__label__0	Passepartout shook it , but with no perceptible effect ; for neither shaking nor maledictions could prevail upon it to change its mind .
__label__0	<NAME> alone , the chief of the expedition , was mortally wounded ; he was buried by his companions on a promontory , to which they gave the name of the promontory of the <NAME> .
__label__1	`` Well , sir , '' says <NAME> , `` this man with me is the other party implicated in this unfortunate affair -- nominally , only nominally -- and my sole object is to prevent his getting into trouble on my account .
__label__1	‘ If you can direct us , do .
__label__0	This strange teacher of morality , who in his youth had set all laws at defiance , and to whom no obligation was sacred , now preached pity , love , and sympathy , arranged regular marriages between the children of different parents , his little community thriving lustily under the mild yet firm control of one who had but lately turned from his own evil ways .
__label__0	It was evidently a court-room , and a crowd of <NAME> and natives already occupied the rear of the apartment .
__label__1	<NAME> was to be my travelling companion , though I am sure I wanted none and would willingly have left her at home .
__label__0	That makes twenty-five days of journeying .
__label__1	And all 's fish that comes to my net .
__label__0	Leaving the <NAME> in the charge of two men , we again took our way to the interior , in order to extend our search over a wider expanse .
__label__1	The coming to a town -- people busy in the markets ; light carts and chaises round the tavern yard ; tradesmen standing at their doors ; men running horses up and down the street for sale ; pigs plunging and grunting in the dirty distance , getting off with long strings at their legs , running into clean chemists ’ shops and being dislodged with brooms by ‘ prentices ; the night coach changing horses -- the passengers cheerless , cold , ugly , and discontented , with three months ’ growth of hair in one night -- the coachman fresh as from a band-box , and exquisitely beautiful by contrast : -- so much bustle , so many things in motion , such a variety of incidents -- when was there a journey with so many delights as that journey in the waggon !
__label__1	So <NAME> quenched her wonder in her gratitude whenever it broke out , and soon subdued it .
__label__1	<NAME> , exulting in the long-looked-for event , jingled and jingled the heavy gold watch-chain that depended from below his trim blue coat , whereof the buttons sparkled phosphorescently in the feeble rays of the distant fire .
__label__0	Returning to the <NAME> , whose small , sharp eyes , glistening with avarice , betrayed that with him it was only a question of how great a price he could obtain .
__label__0	Now , for the first time , <NAME> felt herself borne along with a gliding movement , like that of a balloon through the air .
__label__1	While you are here , I must stipulate that you are always known as -- say as <NAME> -- an ordinary name , and convenient .
__label__0	The grand-dukes and their aides-de-camp , the chamberlains-in-waiting and other officers of the palace , presided personally in the arrangement of the dances .
__label__1	It was the peculiarity of the nuptials that they were all Bride .
__label__0	`` O , you ca n't see them till you get ashore ; they are hidden behind those hillocks you see there ! ''
__label__1	‘ What is your great mode of smoothing and managing , <NAME> ?
__label__1	They would have talked to me too , but I held back , and moped in my corner ; scared by their love-making and hilarity , though it was far from boisterous , and almost wondering that no judgement came upon them for their hardness of heart .
__label__0	`` Sir , '' said I , `` no doubt you are ignorant of the discussions which have taken place concerning you in <NAME> and <NAME> .
__label__0	`` We shall make them ungrateful , '' replied <NAME> , in the tone of a man who esteems the human race at its just worth .
__label__1	‘ I am , sir , ’ replied <NAME> .
__label__0	`` Let us continue , '' resumed the engineer .
__label__1	At last I done it .
__label__1	`` I always give too much to ladies .
__label__1	I had bought a spotted wooden horse over-night as a parting gift to little <NAME> -- that was the boy -- and a doll for little Emma .
__label__1	“ If you hear in my voice -- I do n't know that it is so , but I hope it is -- if you hear in my voice any resemblance to a voice that once was sweet music in your ears , weep for it , weep for it !
__label__1	The only eye-sore in the whole place was another cousin of <NAME> ’ s , and a brother of <NAME> , whom <NAME> called “ <NAME> , ” and who seemed to keep <NAME> all to himself , up in one corner of the table .
__label__0	From <NAME> , the main district of the merchants of that country , he descried , at length , on the horizon , the lake so much desired and so long sought for , of which <NAME> caught a glimpse on the 3d of <NAME> felt real emotion : he was almost in contact with one of the principal points of his expedition , and , with his spy-glass constantly raised , he kept every nook and corner of the mysterious region in sight .
__label__0	And that is why the search for this thief will be more likely to succeed . ''
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , Mrs. <NAME> , ’ said Mrs. Cluppins , ‘ see what you ’ ve been and done ! ’ ‘ Well , that is a good one ! ’ ejaculated Mrs. Sanders .
__label__0	`` And now , '' he resumed in a sharper tone and with a shake in his voice which denoted a certain amount of nervous irritation , `` it is possible that you did not know the <NAME> family ; that you have never met them either at <NAME> or at <NAME> -- '' `` Or elsewhere . ''
__label__0	<NAME> , <NAME> of the <NAME> .
__label__1	As the reflection died away , and a gloom went creeping up the wall , he watched it deepen , deepen , deepen , into night .
__label__0	We had no longer to do with completely frozen vapour , but had to deal with the phenomenon called frost-rime , which often occurs in these high latitudes .
__label__1	Being conveyed into the front parlour , she was there deposited on a sofa ; and the lady from the first floor running up to the first floor , returned with a bottle of sal-volatile , which , holding Mrs. <NAME> tight round the neck , she applied in all womanly kindness and pity to her nose , until that lady with many plunges and struggles was fain to declare herself decidedly better .
__label__0	<NAME> convoyed his prize to the <NAME> , where he sold it much below its value , for 6000 piastres .
__label__0	Never before had the <NAME> power in <NAME> been exposed to such danger , and if , as they had hoped , the sepoys had received assistance from without , the influence and supremacy in <NAME> of the <NAME> would have been a thing of the past .
__label__1	The nearest usher called for <NAME> ; another one , at a little distance off , demanded <NAME> ; and a third rushed in a breathless state into <NAME> , and screamed for <NAME> till he was hoarse .
__label__0	As to <NAME> , he did not speak ; he simply gazed , and by the mistrust which his look expressed , it appeared that he was examining some strange country .
__label__1	I wish we could be brought to consider this , and remembering natural obligations a little more at the right time , talk about them a little less at the wrong one. ’ After this , brother <NAME> , who had talked himself into a great heat , stopped to cool a little , and then continued : ‘ I dare say you are surprised , my dear sir , that I have listened to your recital with so little astonishment .
__label__1	<NAME> , let us be courageous .
__label__1	‘ Oh Jeremiah ! ’ cried <NAME> , waking .
__label__0	From seven in the morning of the 12th to a quarter before nine in the evening of the 21st there were nine days , thirteen hours , and forty-five minutes .
__label__1	If this be real , and her allotted time be not yet come , wake , <NAME> , wake !
__label__0	Let him prepare to receive us ! ” The clamor , the songs and demonstrations of all kinds increased twofold , and the whole immense ants ’ nest of black heads was again in motion .
__label__0	We desire our streets to be lighted within a month , or you must pay a large indemnity for each day of delay ; and what would happen if , amid the darkness , some affray should take place ? ''
__label__0	Its base was turning away slowly and steadily from the <NAME> , and pointing surely and unmistakably towards the <NAME> .
__label__0	In a moment more , <NAME> and <NAME> were seated in the kibitka .
__label__1	Is that all you say ?
__label__1	If you think it is a case of accidental death , you will find a verdict accordingly .
__label__0	“ We must pass them though ! ” urged the doctor .
__label__1	They were making late hay , somewhere out of town ; and though the fragrance had a long way to come , and many counter fragrances to contend with among the dwellings of the poor ( may God reward the worthy gentlemen who stickle for the <NAME> as part and parcel of the wisdom of our ancestors , and who do their little best to keep those dwellings miserable !
__label__1	Fifty thousand lairs surrounded him where people lived so unwholesomely that fair water put into their crowded rooms on Saturday night , would be corrupt on Sunday morning ; albeit my lord , their county member , was amazed that they failed to sleep in company with their butcher ’ s meat .
__label__0	Is it not natural , after all , for the heart to be assailed by a thousand apprehensions as we near the end of any enterprise ?
__label__1	After darkly looking at his leg and me several times , he came closer to my tombstone , took me by both arms , and tilted me back as far as he could hold me ; so that his eyes looked most powerfully down into mine , and mine looked most helplessly up into his .
__label__0	[ Illustration : Map of North-West <NAME> . ]
__label__1	Thus <NAME> had grown to be an amiable , giddy , wilful , winning little creature ; spoilt , in the sense of counting upon kindness from all around her ; but not in the sense of repaying it with indifference .
__label__1	The house was dark and shabby , and the greasy shoulders that had left their mark in <NAME> 's room seemed to have been shuffling up and down the staircase for years .
__label__1	The <NAME> stopped at a certain warehouse door , and asked <NAME> if he knew it .
__label__1	‘ Do you know , ’ said he , after a pause , during which they walked on side by side , ‘ that I believe I could tell you your name , if I tried ? ’ ‘ Prove your opinion , ’ was the answer , accompanied with a stop and a stare .
__label__0	Two sails , a brigantine and a jib , were arranged to catch the wind to the greatest advantage , and the travelers estimated that their progress would be little under the rate of twelve leagues an hour .
__label__1	Who 'll say as much as that , I should like to know ; eh , <NAME> ? '
__label__1	This earth looked spectral , and so did the pale stars : while the cold eastern glare , expressionless as to heat or colour , with the eye of the firmament quenched , might have been likened to the stare of the dead .
__label__0	<NAME> pars <NAME> , plate <NAME> .
__label__0	We have penetrated so far , thanks to the help of particular circumstances , the earliness of the summer season , an abnormal temperature and a rapid thaw .
__label__1	But it is the obstinate custom of such creatures hardly ever to say what is set down for them .
__label__0	`` We shall soon have the light of the <NAME> !
__label__0	High pieces of furniture , of black violet ebony inlaid with brass , supported upon their wide shelves a great number of books uniformly bound .
__label__0	This was the only word of reproach which came to my lips ; for I thoroughly understood how deeply and sorrowfully the worthy Professor would regret my loss , and how in his turn he would patiently seek for me .
__label__0	`` <NAME> is as much as to say -- ? ''
__label__0	`` Perhaps in this fact lay the explanation of their having no provisions to offer in traffic , for in other respects we found them fully alive to the hospitable instinct which more particularly commends the islanders of the southern seas to navigators . ''
__label__1	`` My friend , '' said <NAME> , standing with his back to the fire after giving up the sketch when it was half finished , `` I should like to ask you something , without offence . ''
__label__1	One crossed the sea alone , and working very hard for one half year , and living harder , saved funds enough to bring the other out .
__label__1	Mr <NAME> smiled again , as he remarked to himself ‘ Those kings and queens were always wishing for children. ’ It occurring to him , perhaps , that if they had been <NAME> , their wishes might have tended in the opposite direction .
__label__1	`` Tell her how it was . ''
__label__1	It is humiliating enough to know that there are among men brutes so obscene and worthless , that they can delight in laying their miserable profanations upon the very steps of <NAME> ’ s greatest altar .
__label__0	Descending the left bank , the explorers began their march into the interior of the country , through districts consisting partly of swamps and partly of yam plantations .
__label__0	But suddenly , at about two o'clock , these words were shouted from aloft , -- `` Head to the west , and put on all steam . ''
__label__1	<NAME> stood arrested on the spot , and if he had awakened then , must have remained there .
__label__0	<NAME> had thought , not perhaps without reason , that the handling of such formidable quantities of pyroxyle would , in all probability , involve a grave catastrophe ; and at any rate , that this immense mass of eminently inflammable matter would inevitably ignite when submitted to the pressure of the projectile .
__label__1	‘ Lord bless you ! ’ said <NAME> , resuming his pipe , ‘ a man must take the fat with the lean ; that ’ s what he must make up his mind to , in this life .
__label__1	As soon as the great black velvet pall outside my little window was shot with gray , I got up and went downstairs ; every board upon the way , and every crack in every board calling after me , “ Stop thief ! ” and “ Get up , Mrs. Joe ! ” In the pantry , which was far more abundantly supplied than usual , owing to the season , I was very much alarmed by a hare hanging up by the heels , whom I rather thought I caught , when my back was half turned , winking .
__label__1	'We must make up for lost time when we 've got things into a good train .
__label__0	But the emergency was great , and it was accordingly soon decided that the little colony should forthwith take up its quarters in the cave .
__label__1	<NAME> ( so self-named ) was the unfortunate child who had fallen downstairs , who now interrupted the correspondence by presenting himself , with a strip of plaster on his forehead , to exhibit his wounded knees , in which <NAME> and I did not know which to pity most -- the bruises or the dirt .
__label__0	A river was there called the <NAME> , a mountain took the name of <NAME> , a small lake was named <NAME> , and the forests became the forests of the <NAME> .
__label__0	Hundreds of waggons , if they went by railway , and hundreds of ships , if they went by sea , would be required for the transport of the metal , the fuel , and the meli-melonite .
__label__1	‘ I am very little hurt , I assure you. ’ ‘ Then you are not dead ! ’ ejaculated the hysterical lady .
__label__0	At half-past ten everybody was on board , even <NAME> and <NAME> , and <NAME> weighed the anchor , which was fast in the sand near the mouth of the <NAME> .
__label__0	Others thought the proposition should be seriously entertained .
__label__1	think I was ; * fired a musket -- fired with an idea -- rushed into wine shop -- wrote it down -- back again -- whiz , bang -- another idea -- wine shop again -- pen and ink -- back again -- cut and slash -- noble time , <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ But no , not he ! ’ says <NAME> of the no surname , clinching the quartette .
__label__1	The <NAME> ! ’ ‘ I am sure I am very much obliged , <NAME> , ’ returned <NAME> faintly , ‘ and take it very kind that you should remember my little ones. ’ At the same time a vision of <NAME> as a <NAME> , with his very small legs encased in the serviceable clothing described by <NAME> , swam before <NAME> ’ s eyes , and made them water .
__label__0	We shall follow one or the other of these curves ?
__label__0	And here <NAME> , followed by her daughter and <NAME> , came out of the house .
__label__1	I am thrown away in society .
__label__0	It would be impossible for us to tell the series of invectives in which he indulged .
__label__1	`` <NAME> , '' I urged , `` it is not so hopeless as that ? ''
__label__0	The prisoners brought by <NAME> had been added to those already kept by the <NAME> in the <NAME> camp .
__label__1	Besides , it is a violation of our agreement .
__label__1	He rightly judged that , at first at all events , they would go in a contrary direction from their late companion .
__label__0	<NAME> was aware of the feelings of veneration with which the natives regard this great arterial stream .
__label__1	‘ You are innocent of any part in it , we thoroughly believe , -- we know. ’ ‘ Oh , I might have been much the better for her , if I had had a better heart ! ’ exclaimed the girl , with most forlorn regret ; ‘ for she was always good to me !
__label__0	It was nine o'clock in the morning when we were quite ready .
__label__1	The woman burst into a fit of laughter , as if she thought this a joke , and tossed it back to me , nodded once , as slightly as before , and made the word ‘ Go ! ’ with her lips .
__label__0	`` By the mercy of <NAME> , <NAME> !
__label__0	[ 1 ] [ 1 ] Member of the whale family .
__label__1	‘ Keep quiet , do , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ there never vos such a old picter-card born .
__label__1	Yet here were the very men who had laughed the loudest at his jests , now flourishing their fists in his face , loading him with imprecations , and defying him to his teeth as a villain !
__label__1	‘ She always was clever , ’ said poor Mrs. Nickleby , brightening up , ‘ always , from a baby .
__label__1	‘ You don ’ t show it , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	In this document there are one hundred and thirty-two letters , giving seventy-nine consonants to fifty-three vowels .
__label__0	He was full of animation , well proportioned in all parts of his bodily mechanism , with quicksilver in his veins , and a most elastic step .
__label__1	They moved so gently , that their footsteps made no noise ; but there were sobs from among the group , and sounds of grief and mourning .
__label__1	The mistake is mine , no doubt , sir. ’ ‘ If you should see him first -- ’ said I .
__label__1	‘ And you see , <NAME> , ’ he added , dropping his voice , ‘ how powerful money is , and how anxious people are to get it .
__label__0	Next day there were new entertainments and new exercises ; beginning with wrestling-matches for grown men and for youths , and proceeding with quail-fights , and feats performed by a camel and an elephant .
__label__0	For a long while this thought haunted my mind , and I had a kind of presentiment that before long chance would betray the captain 's secrets .
__label__1	‘ Perhaps not , ’ said <NAME> ; ‘ and you bring me back to the question , with an apology for digressing .
__label__0	So for the most part the five men remained in complete idleness .
__label__0	However conscientiously the assistant on the <NAME> coast might look to the kindling of the beacon , <NAME> had no glances to spare for that direction ; he had no eyes except for the one object of his notice , no thoughts apart from that one quarter of the firmament .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> was standing in a box by one of the coffee-room fire-places , fitted with one such table as is usually seen in coffee-rooms , and two of extraordinary shapes and dimensions made to suit the angles of the partition .
__label__0	Still , they could not doubt that they were nearing land .
__label__1	Also , while he still grasped that feature , he directed several thoughtful looks down the street , after the retiring figure of Mr Boffin .
__label__0	`` It is very simple , '' responded the gentleman .
__label__0	Here is the flag of our country .
__label__1	A half-formed , wholly unexpressed suspicion tossed in it , now heaving itself up , and now sinking into the deep ; now gaining palpability , and now losing it .
__label__1	“ You are one of those , <NAME> , ” said I , “ who make the most of every chance .
__label__1	They quickly came out again , no one speaking but <NAME> : who remarked to <NAME> , in a whisper , ‘ Not <NAME> worse than <NAME> Tippins. ’ So , back to the whitewashed library of the monastery -- with that liver still in shrieking requisition , as it had been loudly , while they looked at the silent sight they came to see -- and there through the merits of the case as summed up by the <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ You might ha ’ made a worser guess than that , old feller , ’ replied <NAME> the younger , setting down his burden in the yard , and sitting himself down upon it afterwards .
__label__1	The horses in the stages that were going out , and had come through the city , were smoking so , that the outside passengers were invisible .
__label__1	They are numerous , my stock of human warious is large , the shop is pretty well crammed , and I don ’ t just now want any more trophies of my art .
__label__0	The fierce and ambitious Feofar now governed this corner of Tartary .
__label__0	Their limbs grew torpid , their minds grew dull , and often they walked like men half asleep ; then a slip or a sudden fall would rouse them for a few moments from their sluggishness .
__label__0	of the meridian of <NAME> .
__label__0	No illusion could be possible , and a fire had actually met their eyes during the night of the 19th of October .
__label__1	If I were but legally executor of <NAME> ’ s will !
__label__1	As it was , she merely stipulated , “ If you bring the boy back with his head blown to bits by a musket , do n't look to me to put it together again. ” The sergeant took a polite leave of the ladies , and parted from <NAME> as from a comrade ; though I doubt if he were quite as fully sensible of that gentleman 's merits under arid conditions , as when something moist was going .
__label__1	Her eyes were dilated and wild , and she constantly uttered piercing shrieks , and repeated the words , 'My husband , my father , and my brother ! '
__label__0	`` I shall try to keep in the offing until the flood , that is to say , till about seven in the evening , and if there is still light enough I will try to enter the gulf ; if not , we must stand off and on during the night , and we will enter to-morrow at sunrise . ''
__label__1	Each was bowed down and broken .
__label__0	Meantime , <NAME> reached the king 's residence , at some distance from the river .
__label__1	‘ I have now , my dear , ’ he added , blurring out ‘ Will ’ with his pencil , ‘ discharged myself of what is doubtless a formal duty in this case , but still a duty in such a case .
__label__0	She was asking for her breakfast .
__label__1	‘ Wery well , Sir. ’ ‘ And you will sit up , till I return. ’ ‘ <NAME> ’ nly , Sir. ’ ‘ Take hold of my leg ; and , when I say “ Over , ” raise me gently. ’ ‘ All right , sir. ’ Having settled these preliminaries , <NAME> grasped the top of the wall , and gave the word ‘ Over , ’ which was literally obeyed .
__label__0	`` Their looks and gestures , '' says the narrative , `` sufficiently expressed their surprise .
__label__0	Turtle-doves existed there in great quantities , and tortoises , and sea-turtles , of an extraordinary size abounded , thence the name given by the <NAME> to this group .
__label__0	Doubtless they explored the surrounding lands , made every effort to escape , for the admiral was an energetic man ; and if he did not succeed -- '' `` It 's because his men betrayed him , '' said <NAME> in a deep voice .
__label__1	At about mid-day , we set out for the office of <NAME> and <NAME> , in <NAME> ’ Commons .
__label__1	`` I am sure I am much obliged to you for your good opinion , '' returns the stationer with his cough of modesty , `` but -- '' `` That 's what YOU are , you know , '' says <NAME> .
__label__1	What is there in all this ?
__label__1	She and his father had been at variance from his earliest remembrance .
__label__0	`` Leave your plans with me , and come back in a week .
__label__1	When she had done that , she left me to go to bed in the dark , locked the door on the outside , put the key in her pocket again , and kept me locked up till she come down in the morning -- very early I can tell you -- and let me out .
__label__0	<NAME> ; but he dared not do it .
__label__1	See the plaintive often and considered as his air was feariocious and not to be allowed to go about some children being timid ( and if doubted hoping Mrs. Perkins may be brought forard for she is here and will do credit to her husband and herself and family ) .
__label__0	The remainder was left with the wagon and the tent .
__label__1	He will perish : there is no real hope , ” echoed <NAME> .
__label__1	Among the rest , she converted the pantry into a dressing-room for me ; and purchased and embellished a bedstead for my occupation , which looked as like a bookcase in the daytime as a bedstead could .
__label__1	Watch-guards and toasting-forks were alike at a discount , and pencil-cases and sponges were a drug in the market .
__label__1	But it would be safer to avoid seeing the daughter , because the son had seen <NAME> , and -- he could not be too careful -- there might possibly be some comparison of notes between the son and daughter , which would awaken slumbering suspicion , and lead to consequences .
__label__0	suddenly exclaimed <NAME> , `` it is not one whale ; there are ten -- there are twenty -- it is a whole troop !
__label__1	But I counted twenty-three gentlemen in wigs who said they were `` in it , '' and none of them appeared to understand it much better than I .
__label__1	He passes into a kind of relapse or into a swoon , and it is an hour before he opens his eyes , reclining on his faithful and attached old servant 's arm .
__label__1	<NAME> , what will it be ? ''
__label__1	‘ By your leaves , gentlemen , ’ said <NAME> W. B. Childers , glancing round the room .
__label__1	Under ordinary circumstances , I should scruple to entreat the indulgence of <NAME> and <NAME> , but- ’ ‘ I can only say for myself , ’ said my aunt , ‘ that I will drink all happiness and success to you , <NAME> , with the utmost pleasure. ’ ‘ And I too ! ’ said <NAME> , with a smile .
__label__1	My guardian being as pleased with the idea as <NAME> was , we took her home next day to arrange the matter and brought her out again in triumph with her boxes and all the purchases that could be squeezed out of a ten-pound note , which <NAME> had found in the docks I suppose , but which he at all events gave her .
__label__1	‘ Is there nothing I can do ? ’ asked <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> turned into <NAME> and would no longer be counted .
__label__1	His table is covered with thick piles of papers ; and I say , as I look around me : ‘ If <NAME> were your clerk , now , <NAME> , she would have enough to do ! ’ ‘ You may say that , my dear Copperfield !
__label__0	There was no doubt about it !
__label__0	We have said that the different pits communicated with each other by means of long subterranean galleries .
__label__1	Finally , there was a parlour for guests to sit in and sup in , where a table was already laid , and where a blazing fire shone red and high .
__label__1	A staring old Dedlock in a panel , as large as life and as dull , looks as if he did n't know what to make of it , which was probably his general state of mind in the days of <NAME> .
__label__1	She had been struck with something blunt and heavy , on the head and spine ; after the blows were dealt , something heavy had been thrown down at her with considerable violence , as she lay on her face .
__label__0	His gaze was fixed intently on a certain dark speck in the heavens .
__label__0	`` The deuce , '' said <NAME> , `` you have a happy temperament . ''
__label__1	Mr <NAME> , after mentally calculating his engagements to a nicety , replied that he should look in at from two minutes before six and seven minutes past ; and the man disappearing with this feeble consolation , <NAME> took a greasy memorandum-book from his pocket and made an entry therein .
__label__1	As Mr <NAME> was somewhat noisily getting his steam up for departure , he concluded by asking that gentleman if he would walk with him ?
__label__0	our iceberg will end by raising its anchor , '' replied <NAME> .
__label__0	It was evidently a detachment of horse advancing towards the Dinka .
__label__0	We have already spoken of the fables which <NAME> had invented in 1539 , and which had been the fruitful source of more than one legend .
__label__0	It was gradually getting dark when the little party entered the wide streets of <NAME> , under <NAME> ’ s guidance , who seemed always to know what he had never seen ; but his instinct led him right , and he walked straight to <NAME> ’ s <NAME> <NAME> .
__label__1	My father and <NAME> never met again .
__label__1	There is the desolation of my heart and my soul .
__label__1	Not venturing to trust himself in the church any more , and yet wishing to have some social participation in what was going on there , Mr <NAME> was , after this , seen from time to time , looking in , with a lorn aspect , at one or other of the windows ; and as there were several windows accessible to him from without , and as his restlessness was very great , it not only became difficult to conceive at which window he would appear next , but likewise became necessary , as it were , for the whole congregation to speculate upon the chances of the different windows , during the comparative leisure afforded them by the sermon .
__label__0	He noticed , however , that the slope of the river bed was very abrupt , and he concluded that <NAME> had rolled beyond the eddy toward the center of the stream .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> ! ’ said my aunt , with great indignation , ‘ I am not going to be serpentined and corkscrewed out of my senses ! ’ <NAME> was rather abashed , as most people might have been , by this explosion ; which derived great additional force from the indignant manner in which my aunt afterwards moved in her chair , and shook her head as if she were making snaps or bounces at him .
__label__1	Are you her ladyship 's property , or somebody else 's ?
__label__0	`` From ocean to ocean '' -- so say the <NAME> ; and these four words compose the general designation of the `` great trunk line '' which crosses the entire width of the <NAME> .
__label__0	Several times already had the crests of the enormous billows licked the bottom of the net , making it still heavier , and the balloon only half rose , like a bird with a wounded wing .
__label__1	<NAME> of paint , bare of paper on the walls , bare of furniture , bare of experience of human life .
__label__0	A few days later , the three friends proceeded in a small boat to examine the natural pillars on which had rested the solid earth forming the basin of <NAME> .
__label__1	Of my making a speech in the same dreamy fashion , without having an idea of what I want to say , beyond such as may be comprehended in the full conviction that I haven ’ t said it .
__label__1	It was a great comfort and surprise to me to find him in his low state cheerful and looking forward .
__label__1	They had no doubt that <NAME> would “ do something ” for me ; their doubts related to the form that something would take .
__label__1	He was a long way down the sunny street , and was making expressive gestures for me to stop .
__label__0	`` This man spoke in a frank voice and with a confident look ; his words could not be doubted .
__label__1	‘ They are a depraved , worthless set .
__label__0	[ Illustration : Gigantic vegetation on the banks of the <NAME> . ]
__label__1	‘ <NAME> is rather vulgar , my dear .
__label__1	No man removed his hand from it now .
__label__0	To think that all that might be pillaged and that the settlers would have all their work to do over again , fresh weapons and tools to make , was a serious matter .
__label__1	In the latter character she always rode as a boy would , which was nothing to her , for she could govern any horse that any man could ride , and could drive four-in-hand with the best whip in those parts .
__label__0	Could the wine have caused it ?
__label__1	Where are you bound for ? ” “ For the <NAME> , I think , ” said I .
__label__1	‘ In the meanness of your nature you revile me with the meanness of my birth .
__label__1	Not being able quite to make up his mind about it , he consulted the <NAME> -- without taking that gentleman into his confidence ; merely informing him that a friend in <NAME> had written to him ( Mr Toots ) for his opinion on such a question .
__label__1	The entrance of the Judge , and a consequent great stir and settling down in the court , stopped the dialogue .
__label__1	No , no ; confound and curse me !
__label__1	One word ! ” Thus calling him back as I went out of the door , I heard her say to <NAME> in a distinct emphatic voice , “ The boy has been a good boy here , and that is his reward .
__label__1	He let them fall , turned a smiling face upon her , and said , as he broke into a good-humoured laugh , ‘ Ay , <NAME> , lass , awlus a muddle .
__label__1	( I redeemed that promise afterwards , in characters larger than those in which apartments are usually announced in manuscript , as being to let . )
__label__1	cried <NAME> , stopping again , and making several absent endeavours to put his candlestick in his pocket .
__label__1	It was a great jest of his , I recollect , to pretend that he couldn ’ t keep his teeth from chattering , whenever mention was made of an Alguazill in connexion with the adventures of <NAME> ; and I remember that when <NAME> met the captain of the robbers in <NAME> , this unlucky joker counterfeited such an ague of terror , that he was overheard by <NAME> , who was prowling about the passage , and handsomely flogged for disorderly conduct in the bedroom .
__label__1	Would you allow me to look at it ?
__label__0	We had hardly gone half a mile on the cliff 's edge when <NAME> again stopped , on perceiving some fragments of bones which were turning to dust , and did not seem to be those of a human being .
__label__1	How dare you think , <NAME> , that we would have you marry for money , when youth , beauty , and every amiable virtue and excellence were to be had for love ?
__label__1	‘ A hard case it has been , and a hard case it is on <NAME> , ’ he finished by saying , with all the honest feeling the topic roused in him .
__label__0	`` I shall save him , '' said the doctor ; `` I 'll answer for it , and we shall find out the explanation of this puzzle . ''
__label__1	<NAME> , if you wish to be carried downstairs -- '' `` In a moment , my dear friend , in a moment .
__label__0	Why should he present himself at the <NAME> ?
__label__1	Mr Dombey having recovered from his surprise , not to say his alarm ( for it was the very first occasion on which the child had ever broached the subject of his mother to him , though he had had him sitting by his side , in this same manner , evening after evening ) , expounded to him how that money , though a very potent spirit , never to be disparaged on any account whatever , could not keep people alive whose time was come to die ; and how that we must all die , unfortunately , even in the <NAME> , though we were never so rich .
__label__1	I don ’ t know that , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	I disgrace nobody and cumber nobody ; that 's something .
__label__1	No ; you have been the ward of <NAME> 's <NAME> since , and I have been busy with the other business of <NAME> 's <NAME> since .
__label__0	His limbs were becoming paralyzed little by little under the electric influences of the gymnotus , which lightly touched his body as it wrapped him in its folds .
__label__1	I canna be expecten to ’ t .
__label__1	‘ Em ’ ly ’ s her name , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ and she ’ s little too .
__label__1	<NAME> , rain , or sunshine , you can ’ t walk half a dozen yards up the street , without encountering half a dozen green parasols. ’ Here the little man indulged in a convulsion of mirth , which was only checked by the entrance of a third party .
__label__1	This was one of the consequences of getting into good society .
__label__1	The poor girl was sitting on the floor where they had laid her down .
__label__0	So I returned to my cabin , where I threw myself on my bunk in my clothes .
__label__0	For these reasons we shall dwell a little upon the humble beginning of the career of one of the most illustrious navigators whom <NAME> boasts .
__label__0	<NAME> held the tiller firm amid the waves lashed into foam by the tempest .
__label__0	It is really a city with straight rows of houses and quite wide streets .
__label__1	`` Why did you not tell me , Mrs .
__label__1	what ’ s that ? ’ ‘ Miscreant with a Pig ’ s head , stand still ! ’ to another horse , who bit another , who frightened the other two , who plunged and backed .
__label__0	Under the centripetal force , the base of the projectile tended toward the moon ; but the centrifugal still prevailed ; and it was probable that its rectilineal course would be changed to a curve of some sort , the nature of which they could not at present determine .
__label__1	repeats Mrs. Rouncewell , `` <NAME> !
__label__1	After recovering twice or thrice , and as often relapsing , he wiped his eyes and said grace ; and a very cheerful meal their scanty supper was .
__label__0	But his tastes were more for travelling than a life at court ; he resolved to make himself a still more illustrious name by further conquests , and soon an opportunity offered for him to carry out his plans .
__label__0	His companions , bending over him , watched the operation with extreme interest .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> ! ” ‘ “ I am afraid my friends want you , <NAME> , ” said the goblin , thrusting his tongue farther into his cheek than ever -- and a most astonishing tongue it was -- “ I ’ m afraid my friends want you , <NAME> , ” said the goblin .
__label__1	I casually mentioned to <NAME> , when I had the pleasure of an interview with her the other day , ’ -- with another inclination of his body -- <NAME> again -- ‘ that there was a vacancy here .
__label__1	Deputy ’ s the nighest name to indict me by : but yer wouldn ’ t catch me pleading to that , neither. ’ ‘ Deputy be it always , then .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , ’ returned the <NAME> , after staring at him and the rest for a long time , without speaking , ‘ I ’ m gone about and adrift .
__label__1	The stranger recognised his friends immediately ; and , darting forward and seizing <NAME> by the hand , dragged him to a seat with his usual impetuosity , talking all the while as if the whole of the arrangements were under his especial patronage and direction .
__label__1	But he was obliged to answer <NAME> ; and he saw a shade of disappointment on her face , as she checked a sigh , and looked at the low fire .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> took the document and carefully examined it .
__label__1	<NAME> , ’ said <NAME> ; ‘ my friend , <NAME> , <NAME> , M.C .
__label__0	This island afforded much silver , gold , copper , sulphur , spices , lemons , cucumbers , cocoa-nuts , and other delicious fruits .
__label__1	they ’ re too beautiful to live , much too beautiful ! ’ On hearing this alarming presentiment of their being doomed to an early death in the flower of their infancy , all four little girls raised a hideous cry , and burying their heads in their mother ’ s lap simultaneously , screamed until the eight flaxen tails vibrated again ; Mrs. <NAME> meanwhile clasping them alternately to her bosom , with attitudes expressive of distraction , which <NAME> herself might have copied .
__label__1	' A <NAME> turns his face , after washing it well , to the <NAME> , when he says his prayers ; these good people , after giving their faces such a rub against the World as to take the smiles off , turn with no less regularity , to the darkest side of <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ “ Stay , love , ” cried the young lady .
__label__1	That he had charged his messenger to represent his perfect innocence with every solemn assurance he could send us .
__label__0	Did he know it before ?
__label__1	As he now appeared in his doorway , towelling his hands , <NAME> got on his great-coat and stood by to snuff out the candles .
__label__0	In this drenching , shivering state , and worn out with fatigue , they came toward evening to a miserable <NAME> , which could only have been called a shelter by people not very fastidious , and certainly only travelers in extremity would even have entered it ; but <NAME> and his companions had no choice , and were glad enough to burrow in this wretched hovel , though it would have been despised by even a poor Indian of the <NAME> .
__label__0	There she would leave the former river , after having descended it for nearly three hundred miles , to ascend the latter for a full three hundred .
__label__0	The problem was a strange one , it must be acknowledged .
__label__0	`` Fear nothing , '' said the unknown .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> follows her as she flies down the hill , and waves his glazed hat as a general signal , which may attract the right coach and which may not .
__label__0	Next morning they crossed the conventional line which separates the <NAME> plains from the region of the <NAME> .
__label__1	After holding her to his breast with a passionate cry , he took up his bundle and darted out at the door , with an arm across his eyes .
__label__0	When I rose , I perceived <NAME> and his lieutenant on the platform .
__label__0	`` Wonderful instance of subsidence on a grand scale ! ''
__label__0	Soon afterward was seen the <NAME> , with its eighteen villages clinging to its flanks like a whole brood of children to their mother ’ s bosom -- a magnificent spectacle for the beholder whose gaze commanded and took in the entire picture at one view .
__label__0	`` The letter was genuine , '' answered <NAME> ; `` it is perfectly true that some unknown person has equipped the <NAME> for an expedition in the ice ; but the ship once off , no one will come on board . ''
__label__1	‘ Haha ! ’ he cried , lifting his eyebrows , folding his arms , and leaning back in his chair .
__label__1	These are the corporate beggars .
__label__1	All continued dark and silent as before .
__label__1	Thus , she walking backward and he walking forward , they came into their own room .
__label__0	The season was too far advanced , and the distance between these latitudes and the pole too great to allow of anything being attempted in the southern hemisphere .
__label__1	I asked if the brickmaker 's wife were ill , but <NAME> said no .
__label__1	Tell your father , <NAME> , whether the milkman said so. ’ ‘ My dear , it is the same thing. ’ ‘ No it is not , ’ said <NAME> , with the same impressive monotony .
__label__0	`` But , '' said I , `` is it not very much to be feared that this ever-increasing pressure may not in the end turn out very painful and inconvenient ? ''
__label__1	I observed that the latter always spoke of himself indefinitely , as ‘ a man ’ , and seldom or never in the first person singular .
__label__0	About thirty pirates could be seen moving on the deck .
__label__1	He does not know it ; we must go to him from here , to tell him of it .
__label__1	exclaims <NAME> , clapping her hands after a twentieth repetition of this remark .
__label__1	But there was the sun shining and there were the birds singing , as the sun only shines and the birds only sing on holidays and half-holidays ; there were the trees waving to all free boys to climb and nestle among their leafy branches ; the hay , entreating them to come and scatter it to the pure air ; the green corn , gently beckoning towards wood and stream ; the smooth ground , rendered smoother still by blending lights and shadows , inviting to runs and leaps , and long walks God knows whither .
__label__1	But I don ’ t believe that. ’ He had placed a chair for her by this time , and sat down opposite ; the violoncello lying snugly on the sofa between them .
__label__0	`` Does it make any real difference whether it is one or the other ? ''
__label__1	While it roared through the steeple of St <NAME> ’ s <NAME> , and twirled all the cowls in the neighbourhood , it made a swoop to beat the <NAME> smoke into the jail ; and , plunging down the chimneys of the few early collegians who were yet lighting their fires , half suffocated them .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> rubs his head with the key while she entertains herself with a sarcastic laugh .
__label__1	But while that Press has its evil eye in every house , and its black hand in every appointment in the state , from a president to a postman ; while , with ribald slander for its only stock in trade , it is the standard literature of an enormous class , who must find their reading in a newspaper , or they will not read at all ; so long must its odium be upon the country ’ s head , and so long must the evil it works , be plainly visible in the <NAME> .
__label__1	Concurrently with this measure ( the description of which cost Mr Rugg innumerable wry faces and great uneasiness in his limbs ) , he would address a letter to all the creditors , exonerating his partner in a solemn manner , informing them of the stoppage of the <NAME> until their pleasure could be known and his partner communicated with , and humbly submitting himself to their direction .
__label__0	He had only to live and expiate in solitude the crimes which he had committed .
__label__0	In 1861 , to the north-east of <NAME> , very nearly in the same latitude we are in now , the crew of the despatch-boat <NAME> perceived a monstrous cuttlefish swimming in the waters .
__label__1	<NAME> and <NAME> has warped him out of himself and perverted me in his eyes .
__label__0	And there , in the bright moonlight , what did they see ?
__label__1	I hope I may not be so unlucky as to make you think I mean to offend you again , for I never have meant to offend you yet , when I say I don ’ t understand it. ’ ‘ Sir , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ will you have the perfidy to deny that you know and long have known that I felt towards <NAME> , call it not the presumption of love , but adoration and sacrifice ? ’ ‘ Indeed , <NAME> , I will not have any perfidy if I know it ; why you should suspect me of it I am at a loss to think .
__label__1	That alone would n't make the subject pleasant , I should think. ” It was a profounder remark than <NAME> had looked for .
__label__0	Somehow or other , this avowal of <NAME> , and surrender of himself , so to speak , unconditionally , singularly touched his auditors , especially when the quartermaster added : “ So I tell you beforehand , the bargain will be more to my profit than yours. ” “ It does not signify , ” replied <NAME> .
__label__0	The intrepid <NAME> was not , however , to be discouraged .
__label__1	Now , there was no reasonable evidence to implicate any person but this woman , and on the improbabilities of her having been able to do it <NAME> principally rested his case .
__label__1	‘ Have you any other apartments , ma ’ am ? ’ he asked .
__label__1	But there were worse troubles yet in store for him , and as they came on , his melancholy and sadness increased .
__label__1	But that she ever thought of it , or watched it , was a secret which she kept within her own young breast .
__label__1	As no one present takes any especial interest in <NAME> 's dreams , the probability is not pursued .
__label__1	The enchanting <NAME> leaves a card .
__label__0	“ I found myself abandoned on a nearly desert coast , but only forty miles from the penal settlement at <NAME> , the capital of <NAME> .
__label__0	He was a man of energy , till now happy and powerful , and deprived in a moment of power and happiness .
__label__1	I hope I have learnt how to accommodate myself to the changes of life .
__label__0	Nevertheless , <NAME> -- '' `` What would there be so surprising in <NAME> 's being carried to land somewhere by the action of the currents ?
__label__1	The fashionable intelligence says so for the comfort of the <NAME> , and it knows all fashionable things .
__label__1	`` Now , it a n't necessary to say to a man like you , engaged in your business , which is a business of trust and requires a person to be wide awake and have his senses about him and his head screwed on tight ( I had an uncle in your business once ) -- it a n't necessary to say to a man like you that it 's the best and wisest way to keep little matters like this quiet .
__label__0	“ It was still sucking its mother when I found it in the trap. ” “ Well , ” said the engineer , “ that proves that within three months a gun-shot was fired in <NAME> Island. ” “ And that a bullet , ” added <NAME> , “ wounded , though not mortally , this little animal. ” “ That is unquestionable , ” said <NAME> , “ and these are the deductions which must be drawn from this incident : that the island was inhabited before our arrival , or that men have landed here within three months .
__label__1	`` I take it , '' he says , making just as much and as little change in his position as will enable him to reach the glass to his lips with a round , full action , `` that I am the only man alive ( or dead either ) that gets the value of a pipe out of <NAME> ? ''
__label__0	Why not ? ” “ Are you hurt ? ” inquired <NAME> of <NAME> .
__label__0	Yes , indeed , the recruits from the Falklands demanding that we should turn back , although <NAME> was not there to fan the flame of insubordination , and I must acknowledge that the greater part of the old tars seemed to agree with them .
__label__1	Above all , I found that the most professing men were the greatest objects of interest ; and that their conceit , their vanity , their want of excitement , and their love of deception ( which many of them possessed to an almost incredible extent , as their histories showed ) , all prompted to these professions , and were all gratified by them .
__label__1	As nobody else appeared and it would soon be dark , <NAME> at length took courage , and when he had resumed his pipe and seat , ventured to draw near , leading her grandfather by the hand .
__label__1	Now let us walk the other way .
__label__0	During the night of the 8th of December , <NAME> was seized by a more violent delirium .
__label__0	It was the <NAME> steamer , leaving for <NAME> at the appointed time .
__label__0	The best naval glasses could not have discovered the projectile wandering around its hemisphere , and yet all were pointed toward that brilliant disc which millions of eyes were looking at at the same moment .
__label__0	`` What will be the end of this ? ''
__label__0	This man had considered him an assassin , but <NAME> did not quail before the accusation .
__label__0	He began to collect his sense , which he found a difficult task ; but at last he recalled the events of the evening before , <NAME> 's revelation , and the opium-house .
__label__1	He had just come home .
__label__0	After crossing a rather large prairie , we arrived at the skirts of a little wood that was enlivened by the songs and flight of a large number of birds .
__label__1	'Who the devil can tell that , without knowing of what kind it is ? '
__label__1	That I 'll do , and render an account of course .
__label__0	The sails and the <NAME> flag were hoisted at ten minutes past three .
__label__1	‘ Now , what I will say for you , my dear , ’ the cherub pursued mildly and without a notion of complaining , ‘ is , that you are so adaptable .
__label__1	The manner in which he struggled through these inarticulate sentences , and , whenever he found himself getting near the name of <NAME> , fought his way on to it , dashed at it in a fainting state , and brought it out with a vehemence little less than marvellous , was frightful ; but now , when he sank into a chair , steaming , and looked at us , with every possible colour in his face that had no business there , and an endless procession of lumps following one another in hot haste up his throat , whence they seemed to shoot into his forehead , he had the appearance of being in the last extremity .
__label__1	Besides these works of art , there were a great many heads of old ladies and gentlemen smirking at each other out of blue and brown skies , and an elegantly written card of terms with an embossed border .
__label__1	But my younger daughter , <NAME> , rather worries and vexes my thoughts .
__label__0	In the west of the town is a magnificent avenue of centenarian orange trees which were carefully respected by the architects who out of the old city made the new .
__label__1	Where can I have it , <NAME> ? ’ <NAME> ’ s knowledge of <NAME> was extensive and peculiar .
__label__0	In narrating the career of a distinguished man , it is well to neglect none of those details which may appear of but slight importance .
__label__1	It was exactly reproduced in the dress he now wore .
__label__0	Her captain hailed them , and this was the last good-by to the crew of the <NAME> .
__label__1	Here , the party straightway retired to rest ; the refreshment of sleep being necessary after so long a journey ; and here they met again about noon , to a substantial breakfast , spread by direction of <NAME> , in a small private room upstairs commanding an uninterrupted view of the stables .
__label__0	The faces of these half breeds were good-looking and pleasant in expression , and their figures were well-proportioned , showing unusual muscular development .
__label__0	But before <NAME> had time to reply one of the boatmen exclaimed in an accent of terror : “ The <NAME> !
__label__1	But you have brought the elegant turn-out , my love ? ’ ‘ No , Pa. ’ ‘ You never can have walked , my dear ? ’ ‘ Yes , I have , Pa. ’ He looked so very much astonished , that <NAME> could not make up her mind to break it to him just yet .
__label__1	You belong , as it were , to the place , and in a manner represent it towards a stranger .
__label__1	He saw many visitors ; overlooked a number of documents ; went in and out , to and from , sundry places of mercantile resort ; and indulged in no more abstraction until the day ’ s business was done .
__label__0	The well-being of the colony was therefore complete .
__label__1	If there had been time , I should probably have ordered several suits of clothes for this occasion ; but as there was not , I was fain to be content with those I had .
__label__1	If people hurried to the windows , Mr <NAME> pitched the temple , and hastily unfurling the drapery and concealing <NAME> therewith , flourished hysterically on the pipes and performed an air .
__label__1	‘ It ’ s been chasing me all my life , but it shall never take me nor mine alive ! ’ cried old Betty .
__label__0	`` Shall we be able to land ? ''
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> would often ask me in a whisper , or when we were alone , “ Does she grow prettier and prettier , <NAME> ? ” And when I said yes ( for indeed she did ) , would seem to enjoy it greedily .
__label__1	His countenance had , perhaps for years , become so set in its contentious expression that it did not soften , even now when he was quiet .
__label__1	But I expect a judgment .
__label__1	They may be of the same blood , but , believe me , they are not of the same nature. ” Still looking at me keenly , <NAME> repeated , -- “ What do you want for them ? ” “ I am not so cunning , you see , ” I said , in answer , conscious that I reddened a little , “ as that I could hide from you , even if I desired , that I do want something .
__label__1	So every true soul ever was , ever is , and ever will be .
__label__0	After a busy day the colonists were sleeping soundly , when towards four o'clock in the morning they were suddenly awakened by <NAME> 's barking .
__label__1	Did the honourable <NAME> allude to him ?
__label__1	said <NAME> , turning round , and addressing <NAME> , after he had bolted the door behind them .
__label__0	During their stay the <NAME> gave the Bushmen some hawks ' bells and other objects , which , to their surprise , were accepted , for in the time of Diaz the negroes had shown themselves timid and even hostile , and had thrown stones to prevent the crews from procuring water .
__label__1	Are they -- are they near here ? ’ ‘ A long way from here , ’ returned the gentleman , shaking his head .
__label__1	‘ I hav ’ n ’ t got anything to do with the lodgings , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	Undoubtedly they were the same words he had before attempted to utter .
__label__1	You have seen my sister oftener and oftener .
__label__0	<NAME> brought a dozen to <NAME> , who placed them on a coal fire , after having cut them in thick slices , and while doing this repeating : `` You will see , master , how good this bread is .
__label__1	On examination it was pronounced that she had received serious hurts , but that they of themselves were far from hopeless ; the danger lay mainly in the nervous shock .
__label__1	‘ Mrs <NAME> said so , sir , when she kep it from her , hoping as Our <NAME> would work round. ’ ‘ But I hope he will ? ’ said <NAME> , with a quick turn upon the messenger .
__label__1	In his college days of athletic exercises , <NAME> had known professors of the <NAME> of fisticuffs , and had attended two or three of their gloved gatherings .
__label__1	Let it stand for this day week , and you shall receive my printed address in the meantime .
__label__0	Besides , we are six also. ” “ Well , well ! ” replied <NAME> , whom no reasoning could have convinced .
__label__0	The corral was enlarged , for the flock of musmons and goats had been increased by a number of young ones , who had to be housed and fed .
__label__1	He has the power to render us happy or unhappy ; to make our service light or burdensome ; a pleasure or a toil .
__label__1	He told me once there should be a day of reckoning between us , sooner or later .
__label__1	There was a curious constraint between her and <NAME> , I thought ( of whom she seemed to be afraid ) , that never wore off .
__label__1	‘ I didn ’ t think of that .
__label__1	As if it were <NAME> , the hero of the ballad , and Mr Venus were the sparrow with his bow and arrow , and Mr Wegg were the fly with his little eye .
__label__1	These , however , had no worse effect than causing her to rub her nose very hard , and then fall asleep again .
__label__0	<NAME> , `` In this untravelled world whose margin fades For ever and for ever as they moved , '' they would find themselves in an immense , tawny , treeless plain , outlined by mountains so distant as to resemble fantastic cloud piles .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> mun , matter eneaf for one neight , ’ replied the guard ; ‘ dang the wall-eyed bay , he ’ s gane mad wi ’ glory I think , carse t ’ coorch is over .
__label__1	He stopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the clerk , who , cold as he was , was warmer than <NAME> ; for he returned them cordially .
__label__1	At all events , I know it. ’ ‘ You never heard <NAME> say anything ? ’ ‘ Say anything ? ’ repeated <NAME> .
__label__1	The shameful accounts we read , every week in the <NAME> year , my lords and gentlemen and honourable boards , the infamous records of small official inhumanity , do not pass by the people as they pass by us .
__label__1	‘ He is only glad to see me .
__label__1	He had turned the course of what he said at that instant , and she remained .
__label__1	I , who never have deserted you ; who never <NAME> desert you , <NAME> ! ’ ‘ My love , ’ said <NAME> , much affected , ‘ you will forgive , and our old and tried friend <NAME> will , I am sure , forgive , the momentary laceration of a wounded spirit , made sensitive by a recent collision with the <NAME> of <NAME> -- in other words , with a ribald <NAME> attached to the water-works -- and will pity , not condemn , its excesses. ’ <NAME> then embraced Mrs. Micawber , and pressed my hand ; leaving me to infer from this broken allusion that his domestic supply of water had been cut off that afternoon , in consequence of default in the payment of the company ’ s rates .
__label__1	It was ten o ’ clock when I went out .
__label__0	Miners , though belonging to different pits , often met , when going to or returning from their work .
__label__0	It was therefore a considerable disappointment to him that , in consequence of the heavy clouds , not a star was visible in the firmament .
__label__0	He believed he could bear removal to <NAME> .
__label__1	He was a better follower than <NAME> .
__label__1	That the recollection of your true consideration for her always , can never be forgotten by her .
__label__0	Wishing to give them a pleasant reception , one of my petty officers played the violin and the sailors danced .
__label__0	he asked , touching a commutator .
__label__1	The lady was not young and fresh from the hand of <NAME> , but was young and fresh from the hand of her maid .
__label__1	He might be , or he might not be .
__label__1	As he stands at his door in <NAME> 's Court in his grey shop-coat and black calico sleeves , looking up at the clouds , or stands behind a desk in his dark shop with a heavy flat ruler , snipping and slicing at sheepskin in company with his two 'prentices , he is emphatically a retiring and unassuming man .
__label__0	“ Here are some animals , ” added <NAME> .
__label__1	And why does Mr Carker , passing through the people to the hall-door , think of the old woman who called to him in the Grove that morning ?
__label__0	The needle remained steady , and might be trusted .
__label__1	‘ You are not so old , <NAME> , are you , that you ’ ll leave your mistress yet ? ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	“ What causes that ? ” asked <NAME> .
__label__1	“ I am , ” said <NAME> ; “ but it 's a secret. ” I assured him of my keeping the secret , and begged to be favored with further particulars .
__label__1	The old question arose again and again -- What could it be ?
__label__0	The fact remains , whether it is to be accounted for by a storm or by some secret design , that the fleet was out of the right way for doubling the Cape of <NAME> when , on the 22nd of April , a high mountain was seen , and soon afterwards a long stretch of coast , which received the name of <NAME> , changed afterwards to that of <NAME> .
__label__0	The <NAME> is not like a chicken on a spit , that we can take it in our hand and shift it as we will .
__label__0	ca n't we carry him to <NAME> ? ''
__label__0	<NAME> and his companions , therefore , shut up in the Projectile , could readily imagine themselves to be completely motionless .
__label__0	`` This sum will be restored to you upon your release from prison , '' said the judge .
__label__1	“ Yes , dearest <NAME> , ” with her hands on his breast , and the inquiring and attentive expression fixed upon him ; “ we are rather thoughtful to-night , for we have something on our mind to-night. ” “ What is it , my Lucie ? ” “ Will you promise not to press one question on me , if I beg you not to ask it ? ” “ Will I promise ?
__label__0	he said , in a hesitating kind of way , `` it really does not look like <NAME> . ''
__label__0	She was reinforced with a supplementary number of <NAME> sailors , without which it would have been impossible to regain <NAME> .
__label__1	The door yielded to the pressure , and they passed in together .
__label__1	To those who are happily unaccustomed to them , the countenances in the streets and labouring-places , too , are shocking .
__label__0	<NAME> , then , need never be wanting , and the daily round of labor could go on in orderly routine .
__label__1	Let me see thee , a ’ so good , and so forgiving .
__label__0	I looked and looked till I was nearly blind , whilst <NAME> kept repeating in a calm voice : `` If , sir , you would not squint so much , you would see better ! ''
__label__1	‘ Oh , yes , he is here , and I grieve to say , <NAME> , he is going on worse than ever. ’ ‘ Ah , ah ! ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> held <NAME> in his arms .
__label__0	The chief hastened to claim his belongings , and to protest his innocence .
__label__0	It was no longer doubtful that men at some period or other had visited this islet , and this became still more evident when paths appeared trodden through the forest , felled trees , and everywhere traces of the hand of man ; but the trees were becoming rotten , and had been felled many years ago ; the marks of the axe were velveted with moss , and the grass grew long and thick on the paths , so that it was difficult to find them .
__label__1	However , there I have ‘ em , just the same .
__label__1	He had heard of her going to the prison every day .
__label__1	And it ’ s quiet , and pleasant , and airy. ’ ‘ And she always has the use of this room for visitors , ’ said the person of the house , screwing up one of her little bony fists , like an opera-glass , and looking through it , with her eyes and her chin in that quaint accordance .
__label__1	‘ I remember there were poles pushed out of upper windows on which clothes were drying , and I remember a low public-house , and the sound flowing down a narrow passage belonging to it of the scraping of a fiddle and the shuffling of feet .
__label__1	To his matter-of-fact home , which was called <NAME> , <NAME> directed his steps .
__label__0	These `` Abrahamites '' are clever merchants , superstitious , however , but remarkably sincere , and never guilty of theft of any kind ; they never kill any living thing , and they worship the ox , which is a sacred animal among them .
__label__1	I make response , 'Tall as a spectre .
__label__1	‘ You have seen me , young lady , ’ repeated <NAME> , as she did not answer , ‘ once before. ’ <NAME> coughed again .
__label__0	At eight o'clock the day appeared far enough advanced for the reconnaissance to be made under favourable conditions .
__label__0	Almost all the inhabitants are merchants , who trade with <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> said how laudable this was in Mrs Pipchin , relict of a man who had died of the <NAME> mines ; and what a staunch , high , independent spirit the old lady had .
__label__0	Ought they not to fly to the help of <NAME> and <NAME> ?
__label__0	<NAME> Raleigh believe really in the existence of this city of gold , for the conquest of which he was about to sacrifice so many lives ?
__label__1	For the first time the <NAME> felt , now , that his suffering was strength and power .
__label__1	<NAME> ’ s people , ’ said a thin , miserable-looking old woman , stopping to recover breath after the ascent of the staircase -- ‘ Mr .
__label__0	His noble features , paled by the approach of death , were perfectly calm .
__label__1	Do you imagine that I bestow a thought on it , or suppose you could do any harm to that low place , which money would not pay for , and handsomely ?
__label__0	your Lordship , ” murmured <NAME> , turning pale .
__label__1	There she is ! ’ In the strength of his misfortune , and the energy of his distress , he fired for the moment like a proud man .
__label__1	Oh , if you knew how my heart is torn .
__label__0	Then we will return with any who may wish to follow us to colonize it definitely , and endow the <NAME> with a useful station in this part of the <NAME> ! ” “ Hurrah ! ” exclaimed <NAME> , “ and that will be no small present which we shall make to our country !
__label__0	And speaking thus , my uncle , half-naked , his leathern purse round his loins , and his spectacles upon his nose , became once more the terrible Professor of <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ I will , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	His social existence had been more like that of an early <NAME> , than an innocent child of the nineteenth century .
__label__1	<NAME> or reality , he had no voice , nor had he power to stir .
__label__1	I a ’ most think you ’ re like the wulturs , pardner , and scent ‘ em out. ’ He spoke in a dropped voice , and with more than one glance at <NAME> who had pulled on her hood again .
__label__1	At length they had left the village far behind , and even lost sight of the smoke among the trees .
__label__0	There seems a <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ The plug of life is dry , sir , and but the mud is left. ’ This speech -- the style of which <NAME> attributed to <NAME> ’ s recent association with theatrical characters -- not being quite explanatory , <NAME> looked as if he were about to ask another question , when <NAME> prevented him by shaking his hand mournfully , and then waving his own .
__label__0	But as they had not one he would have to supply the deficiency .
__label__1	First to wake them , and next to tell them , all so wild and breathless as she was , what had brought her there , were difficulties ; but they no sooner understood her than their spirits were on fire like hers .
__label__1	N. F. was some tender , lovely , fascinating fair-creature , I make no doubt , ’ observed Mr Blandois , as he snapped on the case again .
__label__0	`` But suppose she had run against this piece of iron ? ''
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> had quite dignity enough for two ; supposing even that the stranger had been more familiar : so he drank his gin-and-water in silence , and read the paper with great show of pomp and circumstance .
__label__1	They 'll be delighted , every one of 'em . '
__label__1	And commissions and remembrances do so crowd upon one at such a time , that we were still busied with this employment when we found ourselves fused , as it were , into a dense conglomeration of passengers and passengers ’ friends and passengers ’ luggage , all jumbled together on the deck of a small steamboat , and panting and snorting off to the packet , which had worked out of dock yesterday afternoon and was now lying at her moorings in the river .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> 's niece 's sister -- the plump one with the lace tucker : not the one with the roses -- blushed .
__label__1	By degrees , however , the place resolved itself into a bare and dirty room , with a couple of windows , whereof a tenth part might be of glass , the remainder being stopped up with old copy-books and paper .
__label__0	My article was warmly discussed , which procured it a high reputation .
__label__1	<NAME> left alone , laid her head upon her hand , and pressing the other over her swelling heart , held free communication with her sorrows .
__label__0	As to <NAME> and <NAME> , they shoved off in the boat , and prepared to cross the channel and to take up two separate stations on the islet .
__label__1	‘ There ’ s <NAME> , ’ he said , with flashing eyes ; ‘ the woman has spirit , determination , purpose -- was she asleep , or petrified ?
__label__1	‘ And is <NAME> absolutely banished ? ’ said the Major , thrusting in his purple face over the steps .
__label__1	‘ After a time , ’ pursued the boy , trying to draw away her hand , ‘ the kind angels will be glad to think that you are not among them , and that you stayed here to be with us .
__label__0	All hope would have to be given up of stopping the operation or arresting the operator .
__label__0	( 1 ) The <NAME> word is _banquise_ , which means the vast stretch of icebergs farther south than the barrière or ice wall .
__label__0	It has therefore had the name dog-fox , or wolf-fox , given to it by whalers .
__label__0	<NAME> dead , we know how the unworthy <NAME> acquitted himself of his mission , how he resolved to turn to his own profit the secret of which he was the possessor , and how he tried to make it the subject of an odious bargain .
__label__1	This flabby lump of mortality that we work so hard at with such patient perseverance , yields no sign of you .
__label__1	All the Pickwickians were in most blooming array ; and there was a terrific roaring on the grass in front of the house , occasioned by all the men , boys , and hobbledehoys attached to the farm , each of whom had got a white bow in his button-hole , and all of whom were cheering with might and main ; being incited thereto , and stimulated therein by the precept and example of <NAME> , who had managed to become mighty popular already , and was as much at home as if he had been born on the land .
__label__1	<NAME> dropped on one knee , and implored him , with a redundancy of gesticulation , to hear what had brought himself into such foul company .
__label__0	They found it hard to answer the question thus squarely put them .
__label__1	A moment more , and <NAME> came clattering along the passage , with the noise of all the nails in his boots condensed into every separate nail .
__label__0	The narrative says , -- `` Several of the designs were novel to the <NAME> .
__label__1	His voice was rich and mellow and he had so long been thoroughly persuaded of the weight and import to mankind of any word he said that his words really had come to sound as if there were something in them .
__label__1	She partly drew aside the curtain of the long , low garret window and called our attention to a number of bird-cages hanging there , some containing several birds .
__label__1	‘ Do you think they WERE crooked ? ’ said <NAME> , in an insinuating tone .
__label__0	returned the really astonished <NAME> , recognising his crony of the <NAME> .
__label__1	Ha -- send for the horses , pack the carriages , I ’ ll not set foot in this man ’ s house again ! ’ No one had interfered in the dispute , which was beyond the <NAME> colloquial powers of <NAME> , <NAME> , and scarcely within the province of the ladies .
__label__0	He knew that he had not an hour to lose , and that was why on this very morning , at about eight o ’ clock , he arrived , exhausted with fatigue , within half a mile of <NAME> .
__label__0	asked <NAME> with manifest incredulity .
__label__0	He gave the lunar mountains a height of about 26,000 feet -- an altitude cut down by <NAME> , but almost doubled by <NAME> .
__label__0	He had , at least , one resource , -- to call on the <NAME> and <NAME> consuls at <NAME> for assistance .
__label__1	Why , if it had been -- a smothering instead of a wedding , ’ Mrs <NAME> cast about in her mind with great pains for this form of expression , ‘ I couldn ’ t have said a word upon it , against them two clever ones. ’ ‘ In good faith , I believe so. ’ ‘ And so you may , Arthur. ’ ‘ Affery , what girl was that in my mother ’ s room just now ? ’ ‘ <NAME> ? ’ said <NAME> in a rather sharp key .
__label__1	<NAME> taught her , nobody stepped forward to help her , nobody cared for her. ’ ‘ Nobody ! ’ echoed the mother , pointing to herself , and striking her breast .
__label__0	What then did I see ?
__label__1	By our own schemes , I mean our joint interest .
__label__0	The consequences would have been his death and that of his companions .
__label__1	I made it a rule to take as much out of myself as I possibly could , in my way of doing everything to which I applied my energies .
__label__1	He paused at the next door in the passage , and tapped gently thereat .
__label__0	The three Venetians remained a year in this large city ; it is easy to understand , from their long halts and deviations , why they required three years for their journey across <NAME> .
__label__1	And I noticed as I kissed my dear that she lay with one hand under her pillow so that it was hidden .
__label__0	To the eastward of the <NAME> ' archipelago , an island was discovered , not marked on the charts , which was named `` Rose , '' after <NAME> .
__label__1	He did neither , and meanwhile the result of this private marriage was a son .
__label__0	In 1857 the great sepoy revolt broke out .
__label__1	Finally she burst into violent weeping , and , when her sister came and sat close at her side to comfort her , said , ‘ Amy , you ’ re an Angel ! ’ ‘ But , I tell you what , my Pet , ’ said <NAME> , when her sister ’ s gentleness had calmed her , ‘ it now comes to this ; that things can not and shall not go on as they are at present going on , and that there must be an end of this , one way or another. ’ As the announcement was vague , though very peremptory , <NAME> returned , ‘ Let us talk about it. ’ ‘ Quite so , my dear , ’ assented <NAME> , as she dried her eyes .
__label__0	A special piece was given on Christmas day , in which allusion was made to the situation of the vessels , and a weekly paper was started called the <NAME> and Winter Chronicle_ , which with <NAME> , as editor , run into twenty-one numbers , all printed on the return to <NAME> of the expedition .
__label__0	The welcome by the natives was cordial .
__label__0	They could even distinguish a second ringed enclosure .
__label__1	Other motes there were which showed him as a heavy , selfish , drifting <NAME> , who , having stumbled , in the course of his unwieldy jostlings against other men , on the discovery that to get through life with ease and credit , he had but to hold his tongue , keep the bald part of his head well polished , and leave his hair alone , had had just cunning enough to seize the idea and stick to it .
__label__0	<NAME> grass took the place of the fine trees of the east ; only a few belts of half-scorched herbage still contended against the invasion of the sand , and the huge rocks , that had rolled down from the distant summits , crushed in their fall , had scattered in sharp-edged pebbles which soon again became coarse sand , and finally impalpable dust .
__label__1	‘ In pumping water out of the <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ You say , <NAME> , ’ pursued Mr Dorrit , ‘ that you think you require time .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , I am sure ! ’ ‘ I understand , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ from my son <NAME> , that he has already improved that chance occasion .
__label__0	Without that liana -- -- ” “ It is to <NAME> , and to <NAME> alone , that you should tender your thanks , ” said <NAME> .
__label__0	The new crew had firstly to apply themselves to learning their several duties , and the old -- all fine fellows -- aided them in the task .
__label__0	Seeing that it would be imprudent to send a boat on shore , <NAME> ordered the ship to be put about .
__label__1	As she sat looking fixedly at them , rather than at him , she plucked the feathers from a pinion of some rare and beautiful bird , which hung from her wrist by a golden thread , to serve her as a fan , and rained them on the ground .
__label__1	Secondly , because the absence of these things presents each child to the visitor in his or her own proper character , with its individuality unimpaired ; not lost in a dull , ugly , monotonous repetition of the same unmeaning garb : which is really an important consideration .
__label__1	‘ But , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ the surplus that would be left as his means of support -- and I suppose the house to be sold , even in saying this -- would be so small , not exceeding in all probability some hundreds of pounds , that perhaps , <NAME> , it would be best to consider whether he might not retain his agency of the estate to which he has so long been receiver .
__label__1	He ’ ll not come here. ’ ‘ Death give him up ! ’ returned the old woman , impatiently .
__label__1	Two or three mighty stacks of chimneys , and a few large dark rooms which had escaped being walled and subdivided out of the recognition of their old proportions , gave the Yard a character .
__label__0	J. T. <NAME> was requested to appear before the <NAME> .
__label__0	If you have not earned them , that is not your fault. ” This redoubled <NAME> ’ s irritation .
__label__1	So this calling follows the rest .
__label__0	Leaving <NAME> on the 15th of September , 1763 , he rested at <NAME> 's <NAME> , on the coast of <NAME> , and at <NAME> , where he took horses and cattle , and landed at the <NAME> in a large bay , which appeared to him wholly suited to his purpose , but he was not long in discovering that what had been taken by preceding navigators for woods of moderate height , were only reeds .
__label__1	Why is Mrs. <NAME> so earnestly entreated not to agitate herself about this warming-pan , unless ( as is no doubt the case ) it is a mere cover for hidden fire -- a mere substitute for some endearing word or promise , agreeably to a preconcerted system of correspondence , artfully contrived by <NAME> with a view to his contemplated desertion , and which I am not in a condition to explain ?
__label__1	But that ain ’ t much to me , for I don ’ t think I shall stop with him long. ’ ‘ Not stop in your place , <NAME> ! ’ cried his mother ; while Mr <NAME> opened his eyes .
__label__1	She does n't notice a word !
__label__1	He is the father of my twins !
__label__1	<NAME> ! ’ They pressed forward to see ; but one among them thrusting the others aside with a loud exclamation , drew a clasp-knife from his pocket , and dashing into the room , cut down the body .
__label__1	“ Never mind what I make it , my friend , ” observed <NAME> , with a knowing and contradictory toss of his head .
__label__0	Then <NAME> took his place , and did about as much ; the snow which was taken from the gallery was carried into the kitchen , where the doctor melted it at the fire , that it might take up less room .
__label__0	“ <NAME> off steam ! ” cried the Major , running to close the hole with the loose drift , while <NAME> pondering on the singular phenomenon muttered to himself : “ Let me see !
__label__1	I knew it to be <NAME> 's file , and I knew that he knew my convict , the moment I saw the instrument .
__label__0	His friends at <NAME> had tried to dissuade him from the journey , by picturing the difficulties and danger of a route frequented by <NAME> ; but nothing could stay him .
__label__0	<NAME> and <NAME> , particularly , were not contented with the mystery , but allowed their imaginations to wander into the domain of the supernatural .
__label__1	‘ I don ’ t know how it is , <NAME> ; I seem to want some faculty of mind that I ought to have .
__label__1	‘ Your wretched brother , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	The voyagers directed all their energies to this urgent work .
__label__0	It was evident that the natives had meditated treason .
__label__0	For a long time I would not give credit to these accounts , considering them as exaggerated ; but they rest upon the authority of two different persons , who had not only been witnesses for several years to these atrocities , but had also borne a share in them : of two persons who lived in a state of mortal enmity , and took particular pains by their mutual recriminations to obtain with us credit for themselves , but yet on this point never contradicted each other .
__label__0	Well , and what were the contents of this letter ? ” “ It contained orders to leave <NAME> without delay , and go and cruise on the eastern coast of -- ” “ <NAME> ! ” said <NAME> with such vehemence that the old sailor was somewhat disconcerted .
__label__1	‘ Now , gentlemen , ’ said <NAME> , looking at them attentively .
__label__0	The nearest of these millions of stars , whose rays can reach us , is <NAME> , that star in <NAME> which you observe near the zenith , and that is fifty thousand millions of leagues distant .
__label__0	“ What can this be ? ” said he ; “ a flood !
__label__0	The <NAME> was less than two degrees from the pole .
__label__0	Not a scout had appeared on the road over which the kibitka had just traveled .
__label__1	`` Why , no , I ca n't say he has , miss .
__label__1	When all was snug , and the shop-door fastened , he said to the perspiring <NAME> : ‘ I suppose , Mr Wegg , we may now produce the paper ? ’ ‘ <NAME> on a minute , sir , ’ replied that discreet character ; ‘ hold on a minute .
__label__0	They passed several farms fortified by battlements and surrounded by a deep moat , the principal building being encircled by a terrace , from which the inhabitants could fire down on the marauders in the plain .
__label__0	This phenomenon was to be explained later , when more was known as to the direction taken by the polar current , which , issuing from <NAME> , washes the shores of <NAME> , the <NAME> , and <NAME> .
__label__0	Our navigation of the 'Passe des <NAME> ' had definitively settled the insular character of the whole of the district terminating in the 'Cape <NAME> ' of <NAME> .
__label__0	To turn aside this flow , an earthquake would be necessary to change the mountain ’ s center of gravity. ” “ But an earthquake is always to be feared at these times , ” observed <NAME> .
__label__1	But <NAME> asked , for me , whether he lived there , and they said he did .
__label__0	If , moreover , she had at her disposal only the money necessary for a journey taken under ordinary circumstances , how could she manage to accomplish it under conditions which made it not only perilous but expensive ?
__label__1	Am I never to throw it off ?
__label__1	This going away was perhaps the very first action of their joint lives that they had got through without her .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> threw himself into the business with a will , and by nine o'clock last night he housed <NAME> , <NAME> , or <NAME> , -- whichever it may be , -- you and I do n't want to know , -- quite successfully .
__label__1	‘ Well , <NAME> , ’ said Dr Lumbey , ‘ this makes six .
__label__0	<NAME> sometimes bore them apart , but sympathy always united them again .
__label__1	I had known many of the grown people before and almost all the children , but now the very steeple began to wear a familiar and affectionate look .
__label__0	These Greenlanders were small and squat ; they were not more than four feet ten inches high ; they had red , round faces , and low foreheads ; their hair , flat and black , fell over their shoulders ; their teeth were decayed , and they seemed to be affected by the sort of leprosy which is peculiar to ichthyophagous tribes .
__label__0	<NAME> friends , how is that for high ? ''
__label__0	“ But what is Joe about ? ” said <NAME> ; “ he don ’ t stop ! ” “ He ’ s doing better than that , <NAME> !
__label__0	During this day the sulphate of quinine was administered to <NAME> every three hours .
__label__0	He returned in the month of August to <NAME> ; from there he successively traversed the <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> countries , and reached his extreme limit in the east , the town of <NAME> , situated at seventeen degrees twenty minutes west longitude .
__label__1	There was encouragement in seeing a ray of light from within , stealing through the dark stern doorway , and falling in a thread upon the marble floor .
__label__1	‘ But oh , my friends and brothers !
__label__1	Gradually , he fell into that deep tranquil sleep which ease from recent suffering alone imparts ; that calm and peaceful rest which it is pain to wake from .
__label__0	At the same time , the frequent intercourse of the explorers with the natives threw quite a new light upon their manners , their religious notions , their language , and on their attitude of hostility up to that time to the teaching of the missionaries .
__label__1	His life is a mystery to the partner of his joys and sorrows -- I again allude to his wife -- and if I should assure you that beyond knowing that it is passed from morning to night at the office , I now know less of it than I do of the man in the south , connected with whose mouth the thoughtless children repeat an idle tale respecting cold plum porridge , I should adopt a popular fallacy to express an actual fact .
__label__1	They know what a clever lad he is ; he 'll be a lifer .
__label__1	If you had been another sort of nephew , you would have come into possession ( so says the will , and I see no reason to doubt it ) of five-and-twenty thousand pounds .
__label__1	<NAME> was in the garden in the centre and hurried out as soon as I appeared .
__label__1	Yes , and a wery good place it is to live in , ain ’ t it ? ’ As <NAME> turned somewhat fiercely upon <NAME> in saying this , and moreover muttered in an excited fashion certain unpleasant invocations concerning his own eyes , limbs , and circulating fluids , the latter gentleman deemed it advisable to pursue the discourse no further .
__label__1	But no hand was there , and it opened no more .
__label__0	`` I say that this war is necessary , '' replied <NAME> , firmly , `` and that the time has come to avenge this insult . ''
__label__1	`` Either this boy sticks to it like cobbler's-wax or there is something out of the common here that beats anything that ever came into my way at <NAME> and <NAME> 's . ''
__label__1	He stopped on hearing some one at the locks and bolts and did not resume until the door had been opened and was shut again .
__label__1	The air , the movement in the court , the lapse of time , or the combination of these things recovers him .
__label__0	She seems to me not only unpropitious to the development of the animal kingdom but actually incapable of sustaining life at all -- that is , in the sense that we usually attach to such a term . ''
__label__1	My new life had lasted for more than a week , and I was stronger than ever in those tremendous practical resolutions that I felt the crisis required .
__label__0	<NAME> alone had done it .
__label__1	I chose the night for the journey , that there might be less curiosity when I left the town .
__label__0	<NAME> never questioned this ; indeed , had he done so , he would never have undertaken the journey .
__label__1	‘ The pang , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ of consigning a child , even to you , my dear <NAME> , is one of the most excruciating imaginable , and combined with a naturally delicate constitution , and the extreme stupidity of the pastry-cook who has undertaken the breakfast , is almost too much for my poor strength .
__label__0	They prove that the moon 's formation , by means of cooling , is due to violent causes ; for while , under the pressure of internal fires the reliefs rise to considerable height , the depths withdraw far below the lunar level . ''
__label__1	<NAME> , I envy them the luxury of their own feelings on this occasion .
__label__1	I doen ’ t care , bless you !
__label__0	After we had gone about five hundred yards , we suddenly turned a steep promontory , and found ourselves close to a lofty forest !
__label__1	‘ How do you mean ? ’ rejoined <NAME> .
__label__1	There was no sound inside .
__label__1	Taunts the beadle in shrill youthful voices with having boiled a boy , choruses fragments of a popular song to that effect and importing that the boy was made into soup for the workhouse .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> lingered , but the old gentleman drew her arm through his , and led her , with gentle force , away .
__label__1	He has learnt his lesson , I see. ’ Seeing that what he said had no effect on me or any of us , he sat on the edge of his table with his hands in his pockets , and one of his splay feet twisted round the other leg , waiting doggedly for what might follow .
__label__1	I had always pitied her , never so much as now .
__label__1	Not that that is much though , I am sure .
__label__0	`` And , in fact , there would be nothing surprising in it . ''
__label__1	Because you hadn ’ t cleared his father to him , and you ought to have done it .
__label__0	They could not even have heard themselves speak .
__label__1	‘ Poor fellow , ’ said <NAME> , tapping gently at his door , ‘ what can be the cause of all this ? ’ <NAME> was hanging on her brother ’ s arm .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> glanced with a troubled eye at us and grudgingly nodded assent .
__label__0	We must absolutely bring down some game to satisfy this cannibal , or else one of these fine mornings , master will find only pieces of his servant to serve him . ''
__label__0	Thus around the <NAME> , above and below , was an impenetrable wall of ice .
__label__1	‘ It ain ’ t much , ’ said the <NAME> , putting a little pile of halfpence in his hand , ‘ but it ’ s well meant. ’ The Father of the <NAME> had never been offered tribute in copper yet .
__label__1	I said it certainly was not business that I came upon , but it was not quite a pleasant matter .
__label__1	‘ I believe , sir , ’ quoth Mrs. Sparsit , ‘ you wished to see me. ’ ‘ I beg your pardon , ’ he said , turning and removing his hat ; ‘ pray excuse me. ’ ‘ Humph ! ’ thought Mrs. Sparsit , as she made a stately bend .
__label__1	I should like a glass of water .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> ’ t stand there , <NAME> , turning your spectacle-case over and over , ’ cried Mr Meagles , ‘ but tell Mr Clennam what you confessed to me. ’ ‘ I undoubtedly was made to feel , ’ said the inventor , ‘ as if I had committed an offence .
__label__1	She was away before it welled up in her mind , away , swift and true , yet steady above all -- for without steadiness it could never be done -- to the landing-place under the willow-tree , where she also had seen the boat lying moored among the stakes .
__label__0	The battle was raging nearer , and the firing was incessant .
__label__1	Each boy is required to bring , sir , two suits of clothes , six shirts , six pair of stockings , two nightcaps , two pocket-handkerchiefs , two pair of shoes , two hats , and a razor. ’ ‘ A razor ! ’ exclaimed <NAME> , as they walked into the next box .
__label__1	He is a most extraordinary old chap , sir .
__label__0	While the excellent <NAME> spoke sentence after sentence , he stood with folded arms , utterly still , motionless to all my uncle 's gesticulations .
__label__1	The <NAME> ’ s breath came short and thick with consternation .
__label__1	“ But I do n't say he do n't refer to it within himself. ” “ Do you believe that he thinks of it much ? ” “ I do , ” said <NAME> .
__label__1	I belong to a profession in which that luxury is sometimes denied us. ’ <NAME> replied , with acknowledgments , that he only hoped he did what was right , and what showed how entirely he was devoted to <NAME> .
__label__0	`` But , in admitting that the sun does not go out , might it not happen that the earth might move away from it ? ''
__label__0	Entered by gates which are shut at night , it is defended by two parallel walls , and three dry moats , one inside , one out , and the third between the two walls which are twenty feet high , and ten feet wide at the base .
__label__1	I was not insensible , indeed .
__label__0	At this moment a guard entered the room , and handed a sealed packet to the magistrate .
__label__1	I keep no money here ; but if you would rather <NAME> knew nothing of the matter , I will send it to you. ” “ Thank you , <NAME> ; I have not the least objection to receiving it from him. ” She read me what she had written ; and it was direct and clear , and evidently intended to absolve me from any suspicion of profiting by the receipt of the money .
__label__0	<NAME> was the first to recover from the deadening shock : his levity came to his relief .
__label__1	exclaimed <NAME> , in strong indignation .
__label__0	It has covered our tracks . ''
__label__1	No. ’ ‘ Might I ask , without seeming impertinent , whether you have any intention of selling it ? ’ ‘ Certainly not .
__label__1	But , her courage was of that emotional nature that it brought the irrepressible tears into her eyes .
__label__1	Pictures of demolished streets and altered houses , as they formerly were when the occupant of the chair was familiar with them , images of people as they too used to be , with little or no allowance made for the lapse of time since they were seen ; of these , there must have been many in the long routine of gloomy days .
__label__0	His equipment this time consisted of thirty oxen -- ten for each of his two waggons , and ten as reserve -- three horses , nine dogs , and five Hottentots .
__label__0	Though its motive power was electricity , it could dispense with the ordinary instruments and even with wires altogether , yet it managed to transmit messages to most parts of the world with an accuracy that , considering how seldom it failed , is almost miraculous .
__label__1	They have rumbled through the streets , and jolted over the stones , and at length reach the wide and open country .
__label__1	‘ I know the sight on you would cheer ‘ em up a bit. ’ My little Dora being in good spirits , and very desirous that I should go -- as I found on talking it over with her -- I readily pledged myself to accompany him in accordance with his wish .
__label__1	Along the crowded path they bore her now ; pure as the newly-fallen snow that covered it ; whose day on earth had been as fleeting .
__label__1	he thinks , with a pitying sadness .
__label__0	Indeed , everybody knows that sailors have a remarkable aptitude for tailoring .
__label__0	went on <NAME> , not giving his indignant friends time to utter a syllable ; `` I do n't want any recrimination !
__label__0	`` I am perfectly certain that this gallery through successive layers of coal was not cut by the hand of man .
__label__0	In the afternoon of the same day our ears were assailed by a hideous braying from below .
__label__0	`` It is simply an olive porphyry , genus olive , order of the pectinibranchidae , class of gasteropods , sub-class mollusca . ''
__label__0	It was not easy to get information from the natives , who were avaricious , untrustworthy , insolent , and deceitful .
__label__0	As soon as I was dressed I went into the saloon .
__label__1	It was the voice of <NAME> 's nephew , who came upon him so quickly that this was the first intimation he had of his approach .
__label__1	The name pleased him , or suited him as well as any other , and the Bachelor he had ever since remained .
__label__1	‘ Wery glad you ’ ve looked in accidentally , <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> kept the brown pocket-handkerchief before his eyes for some minutes , moaning decently meanwhile , and then , mastering his feelings by a strong effort , put it in his pocket and buttoned it up .
__label__1	From many dreams of rambling through light and sunny places , but with some vague object unattained which ran indistinctly through them all , she awoke to find that it was yet night , and that the stars were shining brightly in the sky .
__label__1	Mrs <NAME> and <NAME> repaired to the drawing-room , where that excellent mother considered it incumbent on her to shed a few irrepressible tears , supposed to be forced from her by her daughter ’ s felicity ; and which she was still drying , very gingerly , with a laced corner of her pocket-handkerchief , when her son-in-law appeared .
__label__1	She has not money , you have not youth .
__label__0	But <NAME> , having already mapped out the whole journey with some care and forethought , was ready for almost every emergency .
__label__0	The <NAME> just touched a rock , and stayed immovable , laying lightly to port side .
__label__1	When I cries out that night , “ I know you now , you ’ re <NAME> ! ” -- which was my exact words ; wasn ’ t they , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Your exact words , ’ said <NAME> , laying his hand on hers .
__label__1	If I was not innocent of this crime , I could n't look at you and keep my secret to myself under the condescension of the present visit .
__label__0	Do you know , my friends , that a curious establishment might be founded with rooms of oxygen , where people whose system is weakened could for a few hours live a more active life .
__label__1	What ’ s the answer ? ’ —leaning out of the pulpit , and pointing downward with his right hand : ‘ From below ! ’ —starting back again , and looking at the sailors before him : ‘ From below , my brethren .
__label__1	He finished by freezing a cup of tea for his own drinking , and retiring at his lowest temperature .
__label__0	If I could have bought it even at the price of all my fortune , if these men had been my slaves to drive by the lash , the <NAME> should never have given up this voyage , even if it led her so far as the point above which flames the <NAME> .
__label__0	The anchors held well , but the hawsers gave way , and the <NAME> was carried out to sea .
__label__0	They might even live long enough to catch a last glimpse of the distant Earth bathed in the glory of the solar rays .
__label__0	Then he set out again for <NAME> , and landed at <NAME> on the 5th of The following year , on the 19th of May , <NAME> left <NAME> at the head of a fleet composed of three vessels called the <NAME> and the <NAME> and the _Emerillon_ on board of which some gentlemen of high rank had taken passages , among whom may be named <NAME> de la <NAME> , and <NAME> de Pont-Briant , son of the <NAME> de <NAME> and cup-bearer to the <NAME> .
__label__1	He was about to take another bite , and had just got his head on one side for a good purchase on it , when his eye fell on me , and he saw that my bread and butter was gone .
__label__0	Harding and his companions had left <NAME> at twelve minutes past nine .
__label__0	Had not <NAME> seen the Projectile ?
__label__1	A substitute for a Fire .
__label__0	Thirty-four of the crew of the <NAME> had died since leaving the southern regions , and if <NAME> had remained another week in these latitudes , he would have lost a hundred men !
__label__1	I had a good mind to ask an old man , in wire spectacles , who was breaking stones upon the road , to lend me his hammer for a little while , and let me begin to beat a path to <NAME> out of granite .
__label__0	<NAME> , did you hear that ? ''
__label__0	The engineer opened the gate , and seeing smoke a hundred feet off in the wood , he fired in that direction .
__label__1	There was an open carriage-and-four , for the <NAME> ; and there were four carriage-and-pair , for his friends and supporters ; and the flags were rustling , and the band was playing , and the constables were swearing , and the twenty committee-men were squabbling , and the mob were shouting , and the horses were backing , and the post- boys perspiring ; and everybody , and everything , then and there assembled , was for the special use , behoof , honour , and renown , of the <NAME> , of <NAME> , one of the candidates for the representation of the borough of <NAME> , in the <NAME> of <NAME> of the <NAME> .
__label__1	Most of the tramping tinkers used to come and lodge at our place ; that was the best part of my master 's earnings .
__label__1	Having revolved these things in his mind and arrived at this conclusion , he communicated to Mr Swiveller as much of his meditations as he thought proper ( <NAME> would have been perfectly satisfied with less ) , and giving him the day to recover himself from his late salamandering , accompanied him at evening to Mr Quilp ’ s house .
__label__1	‘ One other word , my Little Dorrit .
__label__0	Anyway , what else could have happened ?
__label__1	Could any less idea shed the light already dawning on your early grave , or give birth to the softened sorrow that is springing into life beneath this rain of tears ! ’ ‘ My dear child , ’ said <NAME> , who held it as a duty incumbent on her , to improve the occasion , ‘ when you are as old as I am -- ’ ‘ <NAME> will be the prime of life , ’ observed <NAME> .
__label__0	`` And besides , '' said the boatswain , `` even supposing they do reach the <NAME> .
__label__1	Can you show me all those places that were spoken of in the account I read ?
__label__0	He could do nothing for them .
__label__0	I heard the moaning of the suddenly displaced air , and the noise of falling stones .
__label__1	One was a slim and rather lame man in rusty black , and a white neckerchief ; another was a stout , burly person , dressed in the same apparel , with a great reddish-black cloth round his neck ; a third was a little weazen , drunken-looking body , with a pimply face .
__label__0	`` Once when upon the shore , '' he says , `` I heard what appeared to be wind instruments , the tones now harmonious , now discordant , yet never unpleasing .
__label__0	`` Understand me ; it is for this that I have embarked on the <NAME> -- yes , to find poor Pym ! ''
__label__0	The bonds were quoted , no longer at a hundred below par , but at twenty , at ten , and at five ; and paralytic old <NAME> <NAME> bet even in his favour .
__label__0	As M. Levchine says , “ a firm front or a square of good infantry could repel ten times the number of <NAME> ; and a single cannon might destroy a frightful number. ” That may be ; but to do this it is necessary for the square of good infantry to reach the rebellious country , and the cannon to leave the arsenals of the <NAME> provinces , perhaps two or three thousand versts distant .
__label__0	I 've changed my game , you see , and simply because it was for my interest to change it .
__label__1	You might have knocked me down on the flat of my back , sir , with the feather of a pen , I assure you , when Mrs. <NAME> said so .
__label__0	A quarter of an hour later he stopped before a large cabin , adorned with several clusters of streamers , the exterior walls of which were designed to represent , in violent colours and without perspective , a company of jugglers .
__label__0	I appeal to the ladies .
__label__1	<NAME> was not at all what I meant , for I had intended my question to apply to his means .
__label__1	‘ He is not hurt in the least. ’ ‘ Don ’ t let him come any nearer , ’ said <NAME> , retiring as far as she could .
__label__0	<NAME> , forewarned , determined to be beforehand with him .
__label__0	And the effect would have been no less terrible if all the guns of all the artilleries of the world had been joined to the thunders of the sky to give one long continuous roar together .
__label__1	Now , you ’ re all of you to drink the health of your best friend <NAME> , and wish him health and long life and many happy returns of this day , both for his own sake and that of your old masters , who consider him an inestimable treasure .
__label__1	She said she had a headache ; headaches don ’ t occasion red eyes .
__label__0	In the corral , the flock of musmons had also increased , and several lambs already bleated in the sheds , to the great delight of <NAME> and <NAME> , who had each their favorite among these newcomers .
__label__1	And when Our <NAME> gets his breathing again , I turns again , and we all goes on together. ’ <NAME> had gradually expanded with his description into a stare and a vacant grin .
__label__1	I take it as a compliment .
__label__0	added the captain in a tone of agitation .
__label__1	If he says , 'Skimpole , join the dance ! '
__label__0	No signs of cities , no signs of buildings , not even of ruins , none of anything that could be reasonably ascribed to the labors of intelligent creatures .
__label__1	To her succeeded another lady , claiming to be a pauper , whose wealth was found wrapped up in little scraps of paper and old rag .
__label__0	The <NAME> placed obstacles in the way of the sale of the merchandise by depreciating its value ; <NAME> sent his agent <NAME> to the <NAME> to complain of the perfidy of the <NAME> and of the bad treatment to which he had been subjected , requesting at the same time permission to move his place of sale to <NAME> , where he hoped that the goods would be more easily disposed of .
__label__1	'And he 'd uncommonly like to see any man offer to do it , ' responded <NAME> , knocking his stick upon the floor .
__label__1	So the two old schoolfellows felt it to be , as , their dinner done , they turned towards the fire to smoke .
__label__1	At last , however , he began to think -- as you or I would have thought at first ; for it is always the person not in the predicament who knows what ought to have been done in it , and would unquestionably have done it too -- at last , I say , he began to think that the source and secret of this ghostly light might be in the adjoining room , from whence , on further tracing it , it seemed to shine .
__label__1	But I should feel it much more , if I didn ’ t know it to be a tie between me and father. -- <NAME> !
__label__0	A richly-ornamented room , quickly traversed by the colonists , was joined to a library , over which a luminous ceiling shed a flood of light .
__label__1	That his papers were in arrear , and that he stood in need of assistance to develop the capacity of his business , was clear enough ; but all the results of his undertakings during many years were distinctly set forth , and were ascertainable with ease .
__label__0	The captain spoke in a tone which did not admit of a reply .
__label__1	But on other moonlight nights , when the sadness and the silence have touched me in a different way -- have affected me with something as like a sorrowful sense of peace , as any emotion that had pain for its foundations could -- I have imagined her as coming to me in my cell , and leading me out into the freedom beyond the fortress .
__label__1	There has been rain this afternoon , and a wintry shudder goes among the little pools on the cracked , uneven flag-stones , and through the giant elm-trees as they shed a gust of tears .
__label__1	In what station of life is this man ? ” <NAME> looked at his cap , and looked at the floor , and looked at the ceiling , and looked at the clerk , and even looked at me , before beginning to reply in a nervous manner , “ We 've dressed him up like -- ” when my guardian blustered out , -- “ What ?
__label__0	`` After all , it does not signify to us , since our campaign will certainly be over in three weeks . ''
__label__1	You to go before me ; you to go alone ; you to go , and I to remain !
__label__1	Whereas now I do declare to you that he becomes to me the embodiment of the suit ; that in place of its being an abstraction , it is <NAME> ; that the more I suffer , the more indignant I am with him ; that every new delay and every new disappointment is only a new injury from <NAME> 's hand . ''
__label__1	‘ A stranger ! ’ she returned , stopping between each short reply , and looking at the fire .
__label__0	Certainly , this man , whoever he was , might expect a somewhat too energetic embrace from the worthy Pencroft !
__label__1	As soon as she came nearly below the tree , <NAME> began , by way of gently indicating his presence , to make sundry diabolical noises similar to those which would probably be natural to a person of middle age who had been afflicted with a combination of inflammatory sore throat , croup , and whooping-cough , from his earliest infancy .
__label__1	‘ I can ’ t keep her avay from me .
__label__1	Mrs <NAME> , overpowered by her feelings as a mother , sinks on her sofa in the <NAME> attitude , when the clatter of the chariot wheels is lost , and sheds several tears .
__label__0	His country was at that time oppressed by <NAME> , and he was exiled to <NAME> ; but though he soon after rose in arms to overthrow the tyrant , the ingratitude of his fellow-citizens obliged him to return into exile .
__label__1	She looked at him now .
__label__0	The interests of commerce stimulated fresh explorations , and it was this motive that actuated two noble Venetians to leave their homes , and brave all the fatigue and danger of a perilous journey .
__label__1	The schoolmaster put his hand in his pocket , and produced two half-crowns , and placed them in Mr Riderhood ’ s palm : who stopped at a convenient doorstep to ring them both , before acknowledging their receipt .
__label__1	‘ Well then , ’ said <NAME> , with a sigh , ‘ as I know what such a metal will do at such a temperature , and such a body under such a pressure , so I may know ( if I will only consider ) , how these great lords and gentlemen will certainly deal with such a matter as mine .
__label__1	Train up a Ghost -- child , I mean -- ’ Any further reflections on this fruitful theme were abruptly cut short by the arrival of <NAME> and <NAME> ; in the hurry of receiving whom , Mrs. Nickleby speedily lost sight of everything else .
__label__1	The fly-drivers , among whom I inquired next , were equally jocose and equally disrespectful ; and the shopkeepers , not liking my appearance , generally replied , without hearing what I had to say , that they had got nothing for me .
__label__1	‘ You ’ re a nice young gentleman ! ’ said Mr Carker , shaking his head at him .
__label__0	A whole flock of birds passed over the hunters , not suspecting the peril from which the doctor 's presence saved them .
__label__1	“ <NAME> me , shep-herds , te-e-ell me ; tell me-e-e , have you seen ( have you seen , have you seen , have you seen ) my-y-y Flo-o-ora-a pass this way ! ” ’ Melodiously good Minor Canon the <NAME> thus delivers himself , in musical rhythm , as he withdraws his amiable face from the doorway and conveys it down-stairs .
__label__1	I do n't know how it is exactly , but the law seems to put things up in price .
__label__0	ha ! ” laughed <NAME> ; “ I do not believe in ships that steer themselves ; and if <NAME> is drunk when we get among soundings , he will get us all into trouble. ” “ Let us hope , ” said <NAME> , “ that the neighborhood of land will bring him to his senses. ” “ Well , then , ” said <NAME> , “ if needs were , you could not sail the <NAME> into <NAME> ? ” “ Without a chart of the coast , certainly not .
__label__1	‘ And one dish , ’ pursued <NAME> , raising his voice still higher as he looked all round the table , ‘ called , from its enormous dimensions , the <NAME> of <NAME> , and made , among other costly ingredients , of the brains of pheasants -- ’ ‘ Ow , ow , ow ! ’ ( from <NAME> . )
__label__1	<NAME> sat upon the step of a door , leaned against a wall under an archway , strolled up and down , listened for the church clock , stopped and watched children playing in the street .
__label__1	Indeed , the poor little creature experienced so much trouble and delay from having to grope for these articles of dress in mud and kennel , and suffered in these researches so much jostling , pushing , squeezing and bandying from hand to hand , that by the time she reached the street in which the notary lived , she was fairly worn out and exhausted , and could not refrain from tears .
__label__1	<NAME> Dibabs -- the <NAME> lived in the beautiful little thatched white house one story high , covered all over with ivy and creeping plants , with an exquisite little porch with twining honysuckles and all sorts of things : where the earwigs used to fall into one ’ s tea on a summer evening , and always fell upon their backs and kicked dreadfully , and where the frogs used to get into the rushlight shades when one stopped all night , and sit up and look through the little holes like Christians -- <NAME> , <NAME> married a man who was a great deal older than herself , and <NAME> marry him , notwithstanding all that could be said to the contrary , and she was so fond of him that nothing was ever equal to it .
__label__0	At first the passengers were much frightened , but <NAME> hastened to reassure them .
__label__1	If your ladyship would wish to have the boy produced in corroboration of this statement , I can lay my hand upon him at any time . ''
__label__0	“ Now , there ’ s something that I would never have believed ! ” said he .
__label__0	<NAME> was so vexed at not being able to catch a glimpse of any Patagonians , that his companions were quite amused at him .
__label__1	She was followed by the whelp .
__label__1	<NAME> was the first to change .
__label__1	‘ Something might ? ’ ‘ If <NAME> ’ s movements are really watched , and if the purpose really is to isolate him from all friends and acquaintance and wear his daily life out grain by grain ( which would seem to be the threat to you ) , does it not appear likely , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ that his enemy would in some way communicate with <NAME> to warn him off from <NAME> ?
__label__1	He cast his despairing eyes downward towards the form from which it had proceeded , and , shuddering from head to foot , looked round .
__label__1	They ’ ve got two children , tho we ’ re thtrong in the <NAME> bithnith and the <NAME> dodge .
__label__1	<NAME> is honourably famous for its free schools , of which it has so many that no person ’ s child among its population can , by possibility , want the means of education , which are extended , upon an average , to four thousand pupils , annually .
__label__1	First , not a word more from you about the past .
__label__0	Was it another capsize of the iceberg ?
__label__0	A magnificent dinner was ready .
__label__0	“ No , sir ; I should much rather lay to and wait till daylight .
__label__0	He himself had said that no remedy could avail , and he awaited with tranquillity that death which had for him no terrors .
__label__1	He said gently , ‘ Tattycoram , come to me a moment , my good girl. ’ She went up to the window .
__label__1	The bridegroom , to whom the pen was handed first , made a rude cross for his mark ; the bride , who came next , did the same .
__label__1	I merely wish that we should -- ha -- understand each other .
__label__0	`` To show that I can understand as well as interrupt ! ''
__label__1	The dolls ’ dressmaker went no more to the business-premises of <NAME> and Co. in <NAME> Mary Axe , after chance had disclosed to her ( as she supposed ) the flinty and hypocritical character of Mr Riah .
__label__0	Perhaps the thought of the gas , which was remorselessly burning at his expense in <NAME> , had something to do with his hot impatience .
__label__1	Well , well , it 's no matter . '
__label__0	The natives , in addition to fruits , offered fowls , pigeons , fishing instruments , working implements , stuffs , and shells , for which they asked nails and earrings .
__label__0	On the 24th of January at mid-day , they sighted its extreme point , but eastward stretched some more land , which also appeared to be of great elevation .
__label__1	'If I thought it was , ' continued <NAME> ; 'if I thought as any one of 'em had dared to lift his wulgar eyes to that lovely countenance -- ' 'They would n't have dared to do it , love , ' responded the lady .
__label__1	You understand to what I allude , Mr Wegg ?
__label__0	Elm or fir , both of which abounded in the island ?
__label__0	The prisoners had been trying to overthrow the palisade , but of course had not succeeded , and were not long in becoming more tranquil .
__label__1	Shall it be done ? ’ ‘ It shall , sir , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> had its drawbacks , but it had some compensating advantages .
__label__1	He is standing close to the lazy gentleman , and says with a faint smile that he believes She is a very strong <NAME> ; to which the lazy gentleman , looking first in his questioner ’ s eye and then very hard in the wind ’ s , answers unexpectedly and ominously , that She need be .
__label__0	The boatswain then set to work on the former contents of the <NAME> , furniture , bedding , sails , clothing , instruments , and utensils .
__label__0	cried <NAME> , almost broken-hearted at the destruction of the vessel of which he was so proud .
__label__0	When it was within five or six cables ' lengths , and the eddy was helping it on , <NAME> let go the paddles , stooped towards the after-part of the boat , and then raised himself , holding up an inert body .
__label__0	`` We could defend it , '' cried <NAME> .
__label__0	`` Then , '' resumed <NAME> , rising with much dignity , `` the <NAME> on <NAME> , appointed by the <NAME> , solemnly assembled in the Projectile belonging to the aforesaid learned and respectable <NAME> , having carefully weighed all the arguments advanced on each side of the question , and having also carefully considered all the new facts bearing on the case that have lately come under the personal notice of said <NAME> , unanimously decides negatively on the question now before the chair for investigation -- namely , 'Is the <NAME> inhabitable ? '
__label__0	He dared no longer think ; he would no longer reflect !
__label__0	And , gentlemen , what do you think ? ''
__label__1	‘ It ’ s not long , sir , ’ said she to <NAME> , ‘ and perhaps you wouldn ’ t mind just jotting it down. ’ The old man willingly put on his spectacles , and , standing at the little desk in the corner where <NAME> filed her receipts and kept her sample phials ( customers ’ scores were interdicted by the strict administration of the <NAME> ) , wrote out the copy in a fair round character .
__label__1	‘ It is an old prerogative of kings to govern everything but their passions .
__label__1	If he were at sea that night , and near a dangerous coast , as it is said he was ; and if the vessel that was seen should really be the ship which -- ’ ‘ Rosa ! ’ said Mrs. <NAME> , ‘ come to me ! ’ She came , but with no sympathy or gentleness .
__label__1	But he remained too late .
__label__0	“ Even should it be only a wildgoose chase , ” said <NAME> to himself , “ it may be worth powder and shot. ” The two correspondents therefore began by cautiously sounding each other .
__label__0	The nearest point the Projectile could ever possibly attain would only be the result of two opposite forces , the attractive and the repulsive , which , as was now clear , influenced its motion .
__label__0	That evening the hunters returned to <NAME> quite exhausted .
__label__0	[ Illustration ] `` They are <NAME> , '' said <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> ; and that makes it the more vexatious , ’ observed <NAME> , in the same pettish tone .
__label__1	‘ I must not make a martyr of myself , when I am one of so large a company. ’ ‘ Relinquish it , or begin it all over again ? ’ mused <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> ’ s gentleman , not knowing how the matter really stands , is afraid to pursue the subject .
__label__1	I have been alone , and indifferent to it .
__label__0	`` It would be but just and fair , '' returned <NAME> .
__label__0	There was the intensest interest awakened to determine whether no vestige could be traced of <NAME> , <NAME> , or any of the group , and it was during a deviation from the direct course for the purpose of a more thorough scrutiny , that one of the sailors raised a thrill of general excitement by shouting , “ A bottle in the sea ! ” Here , then , at length was a communication from the outer world .
__label__1	Now , what have you got to say to me , eh ? ’ <NAME> made no reply ; for the little pink pocket-handkerchief was in full force .
__label__1	Take it ! ’ The old woman uttered a moan as the money was restored , but without in any other way opposing its restoration , hobbled at her daughter ’ s side out of the yard , and along the by-street upon which it opened .
__label__0	There , to their great joy , they learnt that the legate Theobald had just been made <NAME> with the title of <NAME> X. , on the 1st of September , 1271 .
__label__1	I have been faithful to my post since the days of his <NAME> Highness the <NAME> , and I will not desert it now .
__label__0	They put him in irons .
__label__1	Would you wish the gentleman to be shown in , ma ’ am ? ’ ‘ I don ’ t know who it can be , ’ said Mrs. Sparsit , wiping her mouth and arranging her mittens .
__label__0	But hope urged him onward .
__label__1	I WON ’ T confine myself to four -- eight , sixteen , two-and-thirty , rather than say anything calculated to overturn the <NAME> ’ s plans. ’ ‘ Wickfield ’ s plans , ’ said the <NAME> , stroking his face , and looking penitently at his adviser .
__label__0	`` I have slept very well , '' was my reply , `` but every bone in my body aches .
__label__0	But this acid was wanting , and he would have been in some difficulty , if nature had not happily furnished the saltpeter , without giving them any other trouble than that of picking it up .
__label__0	The Earth when nearest to the <NAME> , is in her _perihelion_ ; when most distant , in her _aphelion_ .
__label__0	Do n't forget that it would take seventy-five moons to make the sun , and three hundred and fifty thousand earths to make up the weight of the sun . ''
__label__0	“ Are you sure , <NAME> ? ” said <NAME> .
__label__0	`` Well , no , we sha ' n't let -- '' The doctor had not finished the sentence before <NAME> , by a violent effort , sprang over the stream of lava and was out of their reach .
__label__0	<NAME> is the chief trading establishment on that island , but it only contains some twelve Russians and ten Aleutians of both sexes .
__label__0	Throughout the voyage a register was at the service of the crew , in which all the incidents of the voyage were to be noted , so that the slightest errors , and the most insignificant oversights could be rectified before the facts of the case faded from memory .
__label__1	Sauntering or sitting about , in every possible attitude of listless idleness , were a great number of debtors , the major part of whom were waiting in prison until their day of ‘ going up ’ before the <NAME> should arrive ; while others had been remanded for various terms , which they were idling away as they best could .
__label__1	The bank had foreclosed a mortgage effected on the property thus pleasantly situated , by one of the <NAME> magnates , who , in his determination to make a shorter cut than usual to an enormous fortune , overspeculated himself by about two hundred thousand pounds .
__label__1	‘ To be sure , ’ said <NAME> , by no means disconcerted .
__label__0	The names of the villages entered by the travellers , and the incidents of the journey through <NAME> , are of no special interest .
__label__0	`` I will do so , '' replied <NAME> , `` or rather I will simply afford you the explanation which , during our few minutes of private conversation , was given me by <NAME> . ''
__label__1	<NAME> steam , tide , wind , and horses , all abate their speed , to linger on such happiness ?
__label__1	‘ On my honour , no , ’ said <NAME> , answering the look and smiling carelessly ; ‘ I don ’ t wonder at your supposing so , but on my honour , no .
__label__0	It would have been vain to try and convince him that the Fire-Maidens did not exist , and that the flame , so suddenly appearing among the ruins , was but a natural phenomenon .
__label__1	‘ You must tell me what I can do for you , <NAME> my friend , ’ said <NAME> confidentially , ‘ if not to-day , next time. ’ ‘ Thank you all the same , ma ’ am , but I want nothing for myself .
__label__1	‘ But luckily he hadn ’ t to deal with the people he supposed , <NAME> , my dear ! ’ said Mr Boffin .
__label__0	It announced : That on December 13th , at 2 o'clock in the morning , the Projectile shot from <NAME> had been perceived by <NAME> and his assistants ; that , deflected a little from its course by some unknown cause , it had not reached its mark , though it had approached near enough to be affected by the <NAME> attraction ; and that , its rectilineal motion having become circular , it should henceforth continue to describe a regular orbit around the <NAME> , of which in fact it had become the <NAME> .
__label__1	You might point out to her that she probably would , in good time , find a husband at <NAME> by whom she would not be -- '' <NAME> adds , after a moment 's consideration , `` dragged from the altars of her forefathers . ''
__label__1	It ’ s of no use pretending to make a secret of matters now , after what I have told you already ; you know she didn ’ t marry old Bounderby for her own sake , or for his sake , but for my sake .
__label__0	<NAME> ’ t think any more of that letter just now. ” On the old woman ’ s invitation , each drew in his chair , <NAME> opposite to <NAME> -- to do him honor -- the father and son opposite to each other .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> had arrived on the wheels just now alluded to , and came running into the room in a breathless condition .
__label__1	‘ Nev ’ r mind , <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> , ‘ it ’ ll be a wery agonisin ’ trial to me at my time of life , but I ’ m pretty tough , that ’ s vun consolation , as the wery old turkey remarked wen the farmer said he wos afeerd he should be obliged to kill him for the <NAME> market. ’ ‘ Wot ’ ll be a trial ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Only a bob ’ s vorth , <NAME> , ’ cried the driver sulkily , for the information of his friend the waterman , as the cab drove off .
__label__1	Now , <NAME> , ” -- <NAME> looked firmly at me as if he knew I was not going to agree with him ; -- “ your sister is a fine figure of a woman. ” I could not help looking at the fire , in an obvious state of doubt .
__label__1	What line are you in ?
__label__1	The Father of the <NAME> condescended towards his brother as an amiable , well-meaning man ; a private character , who had not arrived at distinction .
__label__0	It was so much taken from the enemy .
__label__0	You would say an express-train was whirling by .
__label__1	How could it be otherwise ?
__label__1	What had once , and at no remote period , been called , even by the erudite <NAME> herself , ‘ the half ; ’ but what was now called , as being more elegant , and more strictly collegiate , ‘ the term , ’ would expire to-morrow .
__label__0	<NAME> fastened this to a well-feathered arrow .
__label__1	‘ Kill me sooner than take me there .
__label__1	The door was opened by a big footman with his head floured , or chalked , or painted in some way ( it didn ’ t look genuine powder ) , and the big footman , receiving the card of introduction , gave it to a little page ; so little , indeed , that his body would not hold , in ordinary array , the number of small buttons which are indispensable to a page ’ s costume , and they were consequently obliged to be stuck on four abreast .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> , heartily glad to effect the proposed compromise , gave in her willing adhesion to it .
__label__0	“ Then , captain , let us set to work ! ” replied Pencroft .
__label__1	He had been brought down to <NAME> , from <NAME> , by an eminent Philanthropist , and why ?
__label__0	These habitations give interest to the scene , and are surrounded by very fine plantations ; yams , rice , onions , pistachio nuts , & c. , are exported in large quantities . ''
__label__0	The <NAME> Government has always refused to acknowledge them , and Desborough <NAME> , in his `` History of <NAME> , '' subordinates <NAME> 's discoveries to those of Flinders .
__label__1	So , the close of every week was a delicious time for me ; and I got through the rest of the week by looking forward to it .
__label__1	Should he meet a stranger coming from the churchyard with a quick step , he is morally convinced that the stranger is ‘ with a blush retiring , ’ as monumentally directed .
__label__0	Turning round , they saw that the crew of the <NAME> was in hot dispute with the <NAME> soldiers .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> ’ t be afeard , mun , ’ he said ; ‘ tak ’ eneaf to carry thee whoam .
__label__1	‘ I shall feel proud of your acquaintance , <NAME> , ’ said the little doctor .
__label__0	How ridiculous , yet how natural , is this vanity !
__label__0	And to whom do you owe this , but to the good boatswain who did his best for you , and did not boast overmuch of his influence ? ''
__label__0	`` Very simple , '' observed <NAME> , who always got muddled at any kind of a difficult sum in addition .
__label__1	There was something in the manner of this simple courtesy : almost defiant , and giving it the character of being rendered on compulsion , or as a matter of traffic to which she was a reluctant party again not lost upon that same observer who was smiling round the board .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> faltered out a reply in the affirmative ; and both gentlemen were forthwith invested with a slip of paper , and a shilling each , by the dexterous <NAME> .
__label__0	These are problems which perhaps history may be for ever unable to solve .
__label__1	<NAME> , ’ said the <NAME> , ‘ was quite vexed about him , poor thing ; so we have got him at home again ; and we have bought him a little Patent place , which agrees with him much better. ’ I knew enough of <NAME> to suspect from this account that it was a place where there was not much to do , and which was pretty well paid .
__label__1	I have not been advised with myself .
__label__1	On seeing him , the miserable creature fell upon his shoulder , sobbing and crying , and pointing to the fountain , where some women were stooping over the motionless bundle , and moving gently about it .
__label__0	`` That is all very well , my friends , '' said the president , `` but the insoluble question still remains .
__label__1	<NAME> 's nephew revelled in another laugh , and as it was impossible to keep the infection off ; though the plump sister tried hard to do it with aromatic vinegar ; his example was unanimously followed .
__label__0	My ear was keenly on the watch to catch the sound of a spring .
__label__1	I tried to look at my pet in the wisest manner , but of course I could n't .
__label__1	As if all that had happened since the garret time were a momentary fancy , or a dream , <NAME> saw him shrink into the exact figure that <NAME> had had in keeping .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> , sensible of having deserved well of his fellow-creatures , said , -- quite vivaciously , all things considered , -- “ Well , Mrs. <NAME> , we 'll do our best endeavors ; let us have a cut at this same pie. ” My sister went out to get it .
__label__1	`` From the market-gardens down by <NAME> .
__label__1	( More blushes in the bean-stalk country ! )
__label__0	All sails were now hoisted , and at noon the <NAME> was within forty-five miles of <NAME> .
__label__0	Is it you ! ” he said ; “ my father ! ” <NAME> could not reply .
__label__0	“ Yes , ” said <NAME> , “ and in that way we shall reach <NAME> without danger or fatigue. ” “ And during the stoppages we can have some hunting in the forests which line the banks , ” added <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , ’ says the Major , seeing this , ‘ I give you joy .
__label__1	Mr Carker turning a corner , on the instant , looked back , and bowed , and disappeared , as if he rode off to the churchyard straight , to do it .
__label__1	Soon after his arrival he languidly wrote to his brother , the honourable and jocular member , that the <NAME> were ‘ great fun ; ’ and further , that the female Bounderby , instead of being the Gorgon he had expected , was young , and remarkably pretty .
__label__1	That what the <NAME> had to do , was to stick on to the national ship as long as they could .
__label__1	`` Not to be always selfish , talking of my son , who has gone to seek his fortune and to find a wife -- when do you mean to seek <NAME> fortune and to find a husband , <NAME> ?
__label__1	`` I certainly sha n't hold my hand , when I can get anything in it by reaching it out , for the sake of such a man as He was , I promise you , <NAME> , '' returned the woman coolly .
__label__0	What was the matter with him ?
__label__1	<NAME> as it always is to consider any assembly in the act of submissively resigning itself to the dreariness of some complacent person , lord or commoner , whom three-fourths of it could , by no human means , raise out of the slough of inanity to their own intellectual level , it was particularly strange , and it was even particularly affecting , to see this crowd of earnest faces , whose honesty in the main no competent observer free from bias could doubt , so agitated by such a leader .
__label__0	The waters of the <NAME> ran silently , like a sheet of oil over a surface of marble .
__label__1	The church itself was not more quiet .
__label__1	Nor need you either , ’ he added , turning to the old man , ‘ if you were not as weak as a reed , and nearly as senseless. ’ ‘ What would you have me do ? ’ he retorted in a kind of helpless desperation .
__label__0	Not one of the brave Scots who set out at the summons of their chief , but could answer to their names ; all were returning to their old <NAME> .
__label__1	“ Well , ” I returned , glad for once to get the better of him in cross-examination , “ I do not know , for I have not made up my mind. ” “ You are going to dine ? ” said <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ You have so much the air of a kind nurse , ’ said the lady , smiling on her , ‘ that you seem as if you had come to me from home. ’ ‘ I am very glad of it. ’ ‘ I was dreaming of home when I woke just now .
__label__1	said <NAME> , clearing his throat .
__label__1	He looked up with a surly nod when his visitor came in .
__label__1	In a by-yard , there was a wilderness of empty casks , which had a certain sour remembrance of better days lingering about them ; but it was too sour to be accepted as a sample of the beer that was gone , -- and in this respect I remember those recluses as being like most others .
__label__0	One day <NAME> said to the girl , “ You never speak to me of my mother , Nadia. ” His mother !
__label__1	I should never have sought you out , madam , to say what I am going to say , but since you have sought me out and are here , I will throw it off my mind .
__label__1	How near to her heart the echoes of her child 's tread came , and those of her own dear father 's , always active and self-possessed , and those of her dear husband 's , need not be told .
__label__1	Patterns of carpets faded and became perplexed and faint , like the memory of those years ’ trifling incidents .
__label__1	I deserve the reproach , which is very just indeed .
__label__0	Without having uttered a word , in a few moments they had left <NAME> , and were standing on the beach .
__label__1	When a boy , '' <NAME> added with great solemnity .
__label__1	`` Disappointed , miss , '' said <NAME> , peeping through the curtain .
__label__1	There is another passenger very much wrapped-up , who has been frowned down by the rest , and morally trampled upon and crushed , for presuming to inquire with a timid interest how long it is since the poor President went down .
__label__1	‘ Rather cool in a Secretary -- and <NAME> ’ s lodger -- to make me the subject of his jealousy ! ’ That <NAME> ’ s daughter should be so contemptuous of Pa ’ s lodger was odd ; but there were odder anomalies than that in the mind of the spoilt girl : spoilt first by poverty , and then by wealth .
__label__0	`` I made my first trip , '' he says , `` accompanied only by an <NAME> .
__label__0	`` Let us advance , then , '' I cried eagerly , no longer able to restrain my curiosity .
__label__0	`` Then , sir , you will sadly embarrass a poor ignorant , who , besides , asks nothing better than to learn . ''
__label__1	`` Why , you 're six foot two , I suppose ? ''
__label__1	When we came near the churchyard , we had to cross an embankment , and get over a stile near a sluice-gate .
__label__0	Yes , but he was smiling in a very strange way . ''
__label__1	I beg your pardon , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , rushing up to him , ‘ but I ’ m happy to say it ’ s all right , <NAME> .
__label__0	At last the hour of sleeping came .
__label__0	Was the raft really floating on this substance , which is in the highest degree combustible ?
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> was on the point of replying to the question , and reciting <NAME> ’ s name and honourable distinctions at full length , when the sprightly <NAME> , with a view of rousing his friend to a sense of his situation , inflicted a startling pinch upon the fleshly part of his arm , which caused him to jump up with a shriek .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> on , further on , darling , further away if we walk till midnight. ’ ‘ There ’ s a good barn hard by , master , ’ said the man , ‘ or there ’ s travellers ’ lodging , I know , at the Plow an ’ Harrer .
__label__0	“ Because those men were <NAME> , my father , and myself , <NAME> ! ” <NAME> looked up hastily , seized the young man ’ s hand , and gazed so fixedly into his eyes that his feelings were stirred to their depths .
__label__0	`` We wo n't waste time , '' returned <NAME> .
__label__1	Then , eyeing <NAME> as she had previously eyed <NAME> and the door , <NAME> chopped that very sudden and keen chop in which her jaws sometimes indulged , leaned back in her chair with folded arms , and thus expressed herself : ‘ Humph !
__label__1	Completely worked round , haven ’ t you ? ’ ‘ Yes , deary , ’ said <NAME> , laying aside her shawl .
__label__1	Are you afraid to kiss me ? ’ The answer is , the ready pressure of her lips upon the cold but smiling mouth .
__label__0	the charms of <NAME> failed to act , to <NAME> 's great surprise ; and the disturbances , if they existed , would have been more difficult to calculate than those of <NAME> which led to the discovery of <NAME> .
__label__0	`` There , where perhaps <NAME> and his companions are also waiting , '' said I , to bring back the discussion to more practical points .
__label__0	I think he will be at least twenty days behind-hand , and that <NAME> will lose a cool five thousand . ''
__label__0	The water will penetrate into the reservoirs , and the <NAME> will gradually sink beneath the water to repose at the bottom of the abyss . ''
__label__0	There was a faint sigh , followed by a feeble voice , which uttered the one word , “ Gallia ? ” “ Yes , yes !
__label__0	To the south -- if south , in this inverted order of things , it might still be called -- the face of the country also appeared unaltered , and some leagues away , the peaks of the <NAME> mountains still retained their accustomed outline .
__label__0	`` Then it entirely depends on you to give me a passage ? ''
__label__0	`` The experiment will be made on a large scale , and will be decisive . ''
__label__1	“ Have you finished your repast , friend ? ” he asked , in due season .
__label__1	After this , they went home .
__label__0	I knew not what to think , when a voice near me said : `` Is that you , <NAME> ? ''
__label__0	A little farther off he found a watering-place , but the hostile demonstrations of the inhabitants forced him to re-embark .
__label__0	A hundred and twenty minutes ( I counted them ) still separated me from the moment in which I was to join <NAME> .
__label__1	It is considered not unlikely that he will get up an imitation of the coroner and make it the principal feature of the <NAME> in the evening .
__label__1	Even its comforts were limited to its being dry and warm , and having a snug though faded fireside .
__label__0	The wind being southeast , consequently blew on their backs .
__label__0	They were allowed to do it in their own way .
__label__1	Still you see , as far as it goes , a pair of pigeons are portable property all the same. ” With that , he looked back , and nodded at this dead plant , and then cast his eyes about him in walking out of the yard , as if he were considering what other pot would go best in its place .
__label__0	`` Yes , <NAME> ; but , instead of being rolled from right to left , this olive turns from left to right . ''
__label__1	As his fancy died out , I would no more have tried to strengthen any power I had , than I would have married him on his being forced to take me for his wife .
__label__0	`` I beg you to excuse me , '' he resumed , `` I have so many things to occupy me and make me anxious .
__label__1	‘ Not going back again ? ’ said the poor little anxious Child of the <NAME> , always calculating and planning for <NAME> , in the front rank of her charges .
__label__1	My mind grew very uneasy on the subject of the pale young gentleman .
__label__1	After our former interview , it would be monstrous in me if I did otherwise. ’ She slowly withdrew her eyes from his face , and turning to the servant , said , ‘ Some other room. ’ He led the way to a drawing-room , which he speedily lighted up and then left them .
__label__0	<NAME> had actively assisted his father in the work , which was on the point of completion .
__label__0	what has not been able to knock the life out of one little Frenchman ca n't have killed two Americans !
__label__1	He wore it the last time you ever saw him , and the last time you ever will see him -- in this world. ’ ‘ It ’ s my belief you mean to tell me to my face you killed him ! ’ exclaimed <NAME> ; but , nevertheless , allowing his glass to be filled again .
__label__1	Personal faintness , and an overpowering personal candour , were the distinguishing features of Mrs. <NAME> ’ s organisation .
__label__0	“ If a ball can do anything for you , you shall not have long to wait for it .
__label__0	Who can prove that , without the denunciation which had brought about your arrest , you would have given yourself up ? ” “ This memoir , in the first place. ” “ That memoir was in your possession , and there is nothing to show that had you not been arrested , you would have put it to the use you say you intended. ” “ At the least , sir , there was one thing that was not in my possession , and of the authenticity of which there can be no doubt. ” “ What ? ” “ The letter I wrote to your predecessor , Judge <NAME> , the letter which gave him notice of my early arrival. ” “ Ah !
__label__0	Though not very large , it appeared not likely to be filled for centuries .
__label__1	‘ I wished you to see the <NAME> for yourself , <NAME> , that you might judge whether I ’ m a liar ; and now I ’ ll see <NAME> ’ s window for myself , that we may know whether he ’ s at home. ’ With that , he crept away .
__label__0	We saw the heads , hearts , and lungs of many of the crew upon the sands , and at a little distance dogs were devouring the entrails . ''
__label__1	<NAME> and strange among this wealth of colour and voluptuous glitter , strange and constrained towards its haughty mistress , whose repellent beauty it repeated , and presented all around him , as in so many fragments of a mirror , he was conscious of embarrassment and awkwardness .
__label__1	I might have remembered it .
__label__1	All this , doubtless , he knew thoroughly , and had , in his cunning , considered well .
__label__0	“ You are very stout , <NAME> , ” replied <NAME> , “ and it ’ s something too , you see , to live all one ’ s life in the mine. ” “ Right , <NAME> .
__label__0	By the evening , according to calculation , it was thought that the “ Bonadventure ” had accomplished a distance of a hundred and twenty miles since her departure from <NAME> , that is to say in thirty-six hours , which would give her a speed of between three and four knots .
__label__1	‘ The people are coming down the crescent now .
__label__1	‘ He were ett ’ n and drinking—as large and as loud as a Hummobee. ’ ‘ Thank you ! ’ said the old woman , with infinite content .
__label__0	[ 3 ] So that , in spite of the many reasons for economizing , <NAME> , after having begged light from the gas , was also obliged to beg for heat .
__label__1	‘ To see you married , <NAME> -- to see you a dilluded wictim , and thinkin ’ in your innocence that it ’ s all wery capital , ’ replied <NAME> .
__label__0	The hold of the <NAME> was so arranged as to find a stowing-place for the balloon .
__label__1	When she went to Mr Casby ’ s , he was always there .
__label__1	‘ I don ’ t know why we unfortunate creatures should be supposed to want common sense , but it is generally taken for granted that we do .
__label__0	Perhaps the king may have still evinced a certain degree of coldness towards him , but the queen was his avowed and enthusiastic protectress .
__label__1	Let me whisper in your ear . '
__label__1	How long this scene might have lasted , or how much <NAME> might have suffered , no one can tell , had not a carriage , which was driving swiftly by , suddenly pulled up , from whence there descended old <NAME> and <NAME> , the former of whom , in far less time than it takes to write it , if not to read it , had made his way to <NAME> ’ s side , and placed him in the vehicle , just as the latter had concluded the third and last round of a single combat with the town-beadle .
__label__1	You may depend upon it they do , <NAME> , and that ’ s the reason they are all near you , and he has put the gravel there , because it ’ s the sunny side .
__label__0	The <NAME> disc struck the travellers as glittering with a splendor and purity of light that they had never witnessed before .
__label__1	cried my guardian , quite triumphant .
__label__1	The court was all astir and a-buzz , when the black sheep -- whom many fell away from in dread -- pressed him into an obscure corner among the crowd .
__label__0	Measures were so skilfully taken , that when the sea rose to its height , all the officers and crew worked the capstan , and as the vessel was disengaged from the rock , it was ascertained that she drew no more water than when on the reef .
__label__0	“ Is everything thrown out ? ” “ No , here are still 2,000 dollars in gold. ” A heavy bag immediately plunged into the sea .
__label__0	<NAME> counselled a debarcation by night , which was done , and then he took the command of a small body of men and scoured the island with them for eight days without meeting one native , they having all fled to the mountains .
__label__0	For some minutes he had seen the man at the foot of the tree , but the sleeper did not move , and this doubtless induced him to come and look at him a little nearer .
__label__1	<NAME> , meagre , ragged , scowling , wolfish ; but prostrate , too , in their humility .
__label__1	A moment of profound silence followed .
__label__0	He was furnished with introductions to Dr. <NAME> , and a credit of two hundred pounds sterling .
__label__1	said <NAME> , with a sigh .
__label__0	The ascent of the <NAME> is one of the most interesting trips that can be made from <NAME> .
__label__0	The following episode may suffice , in a certain degree , to illustrate his character .
__label__1	Thus the whelp had gone out of the circle before the people moved .
__label__0	as <NAME> whispered to those around him ; otherwise how could they have ever run up that flag ?
__label__0	In the last-named archipelago he became separated from his companions , and was discovered half dead upon the coast of <NAME> .
__label__1	But when I stole a glance at her and saw her so composed and distant and unapproachable , I felt this to be a foolish weakness .
__label__1	‘ You have a good deal of intelligence for a little fellow , ’ he said , with a grave smile that belonged to him , ‘ and you understood me very well , I see .
__label__1	But he kept up , nevertheless , and , with his head drooping languidly on his breast , went stumbling onward , he knew not whither .
__label__1	Mr <NAME> looked at him , at his sister , at the walls , at the ceiling , at the floor -- everywhere but at <NAME> , who stood quite stupefied and motionless .
__label__0	I wished it , and I feared it at the same time .
__label__1	<NAME> , still looking , and always looking with an immovable countenance , at the opposite side of the world , made no reply .
__label__0	The horizon is shut in by a barrier of mountains , ending on the south of the <NAME> , a volcano now almost extinct , but the eruptions of which have often caused frightful calamities .
__label__0	In an instant , with electrical rapidity , as if the current had been of alcohol , the whole river was in a blaze above and below the town .
__label__1	'What did they say , about last Sunday ? '
__label__0	An additional reason , by the way , for pushing on as far as possible .
__label__1	He is calling again ! ’ ‘ It may be the last time we shall ever meet on earth , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ it may be better for me that we should never meet more. ’ ‘ For both , for both , ’ replied <NAME> , not heeding what she said .
__label__1	I wore away the longest part of many wild sad nights , in those rides ; reviving , as I went , the thoughts that had occupied me in my long absence .
__label__1	We don ’ t walk like that .
__label__1	It would not extend beyond two people .
__label__0	Being unable to see his enemies , he had not thought of defending himself .
__label__0	I saw a large vessel pass the horizon struggling painfully .
__label__1	<NAME> occasioned the inexhaustible baby to square at him with the speckled fists , and demand in a threatening manner what he meant ?
__label__1	‘ I don ’ t like it , Mr Venus .
__label__1	‘ Very sensitive ; that ’ s a pity .
__label__1	I only ask you , my second mother , to consider .
__label__0	The longitude at this height was of no importance , for all the meridians run together within a few hundred feet higher .
__label__1	‘ Your mother will be fit to jump out of her skin , my boy , when she hears of this , ’ said <NAME> to his son .
__label__1	Slowly and peacefully , the father sank into the grave , and , soon after , the sharer of all his cares and troubles followed him to a place of rest .
__label__0	It was <NAME> ; and what had happened to him was as follows : Shortly after <NAME> left the opium den , two waiters had lifted the unconscious Passepartout , and had carried him to the bed reserved for the smokers .
__label__0	It will be remembered that the obstinate fellow had insisted on keeping his famous family watch at <NAME> time , and on regarding that of the countries he had passed through as quite false and unreliable .
__label__1	Can ’ t I make <NAME> terms with you on my friend ’ s part , Mr Riah ? ’ ‘ I am but the representative of another , sir , ’ returned the Jew in a low voice .
__label__1	‘ I hardly know -- I -- I am much obliged , Sir. ’ ‘ He needn ’ t wait , <NAME> , ’ said Mr Dombey .
__label__0	`` Yes , my boy ; and you need not try to compute the number of these infusoria .
__label__1	We all went to church , and <NAME> gave her away .
__label__1	Let me put your shawl tidy .
__label__0	`` I am not sure , '' says <NAME> , `` that the first sight of the llanos is not as surprising as that of the Andes . ''
__label__0	<NAME> Harding then took two slips of zinc , one of which was plunged into azotic acid , the other into a solution of potash .
__label__0	One thing was certain , that it was possible to reach the palisade without being seen , and also that it did not appear to be guarded .
__label__0	Some fine day , the wind left the seed of a palm on it , and the seed has taken root and grown as though it were on the plain ground. ” “ A fine new style of gardening , ” said <NAME> , “ and I ’ ll import the idea to <NAME> .
__label__1	Having purchased a few small articles of grocery , and a measure of oil for the lamp , <NAME> bethought herself of the wine they wanted .
__label__1	The <NAME> , after bowing his head with great reverence , stared all round the circle , beginning with Mr Toots , and ending with the Instrument-maker ; then gravely said : ‘ <NAME> !
__label__1	How little I thought what I was doing !
__label__1	‘ The dead letters , of course , ’ said the bagman .
__label__1	This was a vagrant of sixty-five , who was going to prison for _not_ playing the flute ; or , in other words , for begging in the streets , and doing nothing for his livelihood .
__label__1	Her inducement to come to me , relying on my confidence , had been the hope that I could tell her the name and place of abode .
__label__0	he cried ; `` wake up , my friends ! ''
__label__1	Everything within the house and without , seemed to be the perfection of neatness and order .
__label__1	I nevermore will see or think o ’ anything that angers me , but thou , so much better than me , shalt be by th ’ side on ’ t .
__label__1	He rejected the angel , and took up with the tormenting spirit crouching in his bosom .
__label__0	He had a passionate taste for that noble profession , and his intention was to enter the army , toward which he felt himself attracted .
__label__1	I date my recovery from the receipt of that intelligence .
__label__0	As for being herself deceived , and taking another for him , equally impossible .
__label__0	Have you made this trip before ? ''
__label__0	<NAME> handed it to him .
__label__1	'Now , boy , tell us what 's the matter : do n't be afraid . '
__label__1	For the rest , uncertainty and danger seemed written upon everything .
__label__0	The news of a message from the captain was immediately whispered throughout the ship .
__label__0	`` May this young lady go with us ? ''
__label__0	There was the same grassy flat soil , the same sharply-defined horizon against the sky .
__label__1	‘ Oh , certainly , depend upon me , ’ said that gentleman aloud .
__label__0	I tried to make him rise from his seat .
__label__1	To this retreat Mr <NAME> repaired regularly every Sunday to spend the day -- usually beginning with breakfast -- and here he was the great purveyor of general news and fashionable intelligence .
__label__1	It seemed to be all old nooks and corners ; and in every nook and corner there was some queer little table , or cupboard , or bookcase , or seat , or something or other , that made me think there was not such another good corner in the room ; until I looked at the next one , and found it equal to it , if not better .
__label__0	In 1585 we meet with him again as vice-admiral , under <NAME> ; in 1588 he distinguished himself against the <NAME> ; in 1590 he was with <NAME> 's fleet on the coast of <NAME> ; finally in a descent on the coast of <NAME> , he was so seriously wounded that he had only time to bring his squadron back to <NAME> before he died .
__label__0	I felt like the lamb led to the slaughter .
__label__1	I mean <NAME> ! ’ My heart quite died within me .
__label__0	`` Are we falling or are we not ? ''
__label__1	Such appearances are common to many vehicles belonging to , and maintained by , old ladies of economic habits ; and in this vehicle sat an old lady who was its mistress and proprietor .
__label__1	‘ Just come in , <NAME> , ’ replied <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Mr Wrayburn , I desire to say something to you on my own part. ’ ‘ Come , come , <NAME> , ’ returned <NAME> , with a languid approach to impatience as the other again struggled with himself ; ‘ say what you have to say .
__label__1	So artful , and so ungrateful you have been , <NAME> ; for when did I ever injure you ? ’ ‘ There was also , ’ Mr <NAME> went on , in a meditative manner , ‘ a errand connection , in which I was much respected .
__label__1	The time might have been when I might have revealed it to you .
__label__0	In these seas it is fishing we ought to be at , not -- '' Then , stopping short , he swore a few oaths , and cried out , `` And that other whale ! ''
__label__1	It slowly grew to that .
__label__1	‘ You don ’ t hate <NAME> , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ I hate to be obliged to call her Jupe .
__label__0	You , friend , have already had the honor of being wounded in the service of the <NAME> , whilst I -- I have as yet suffered nothing in my cousin ’ s service .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , ’ cried <NAME> , when this sound met her ear , ‘ make haste , for <NAME> ’ s sake , he will destroy himself !
__label__1	It happened to be the <NAME> ’ s birthday , too .
__label__1	No , do n't ring -- I have been brought up in a sharp school and am accustomed to a variety of general practice .
__label__0	Thus we still have twenty-seven minutes to remain on the earth . ''
__label__1	To all appearance , almost in the dark : I have done all I could do to be lost .
__label__0	It is a perfect type of the lunar crater .
__label__1	‘ Open the window , ’ said the sick man .
__label__0	Thanks indeed to him , nearly the whole of the industrial population of <NAME> had been killed , sold into slavery , or had fled the country .
__label__0	`` But , then , '' said <NAME> , `` in order to maintain that combustion , there must be air .
__label__0	Just imagine no vines to speak of being in <NAME> !
__label__0	In this way we passed our first night in the interior of a crater .
__label__0	`` To maintain combustion , '' commenced <NAME> syllogistically and sententiously , `` air is necessary .
__label__1	If <NAME> had been like anybody else , I might have had some little musical knowledge to begin upon .
__label__1	At one point , as we ascended a steep hill , athwart whose base a railroad , yet constructing , took its course , we came upon an <NAME> colony .
__label__1	‘ Now , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , reappearing in the kitchen with some remains of a blush , ‘ you and <NAME> think magnificent me fit for nothing , but I intend to prove the contrary .
__label__1	Upon my word and honour I think you can hardly know your own feelings better than I imagine them .
__label__1	<NAME> , who had been asleep too , staggered up at the noise I made , and in an instant I saw his jackknife shining in his hand .
__label__1	The effect of this ceremonial was for some quarter of an hour afterwards perfectly paralyzing on the neighbours , and was much enhanced by the worthy lady airing herself for that term in a kind of splendidly serene trance on the top step .
__label__0	At last he was discovered on a ledge in the upper portion of the Projectile , whither he had been shot by the terrible concussion .
__label__1	‘ And now , ’ said the schoolmaster , dividing the bread and butter for three into as many portions as there were children , ‘ you had better look sharp with your breakfast , for the horn will blow in a minute or two , and then every boy leaves off. ’ Permission being thus given to fall to , the boys began to eat voraciously , and in desperate haste : while the schoolmaster ( who was in high good humour after his meal ) picked his teeth with a fork , and looked smilingly on .
__label__0	He had just written 40,000—when the bell rang a second time .
__label__0	After working an hour , <NAME> , who was in a complete state of perspiration , threw down the pieces of wood in disgust .
__label__0	`` Let us follow him again , '' resumed the doctor .
__label__0	The recollection of this book impressed him .
__label__1	I was sure it was the same gentlemen because I knew their voices again -- I mean I knew <NAME> 's .
__label__0	<NAME> avez confirmé dans ces lieux pleins d'ennui Ce que <NAME> connut sans sortir de lui .
__label__0	`` See the shadows of those peaks ! ''
__label__0	`` And we will save him , '' replied the sailor .
__label__0	179 , <NAME> , one of the quietest streets in <NAME> , far from the business quarter , for in commerce he took no interest ; far from the noise of the crowd , for the mob he abhorred .
__label__0	The environs of <NAME> are terribly bare , without houses or any signs of cultivation .
__label__1	Perhaps you may be interested , <NAME> , '' continued <NAME> , leading the way into the next drawing-room , `` in this portrait of <NAME> .
__label__1	Had her attractions been manifested first to him -- or <NAME> ?
__label__1	During the delivery of the oration , Mrs. <NAME> sobbed and wept at the end of the paragraphs ; while <NAME> , sitting cross-legged on a chair and resting his arms on the top rail , regarded the speaker with great suavity and blandness of demeanour ; occasionally bestowing a look of recognition on the old gentleman , who was delighted at the beginning , and went to sleep about half-way .
__label__1	There was a busy little man beside him , though , who took off his hat at intervals and motioned to the people to cheer , which they regularly did , most enthusiastically ; and as the red-faced gentleman went on talking till he was redder in the face than ever , it seemed to answer his purpose quite as well as if anybody had heard him .
__label__0	At times it almost seemed as if an under-current raised these monstrous billows which thundered against the wall of <NAME> .
__label__1	By-and-by , she said , breaking a long and patient silence : ‘ I beg your pardon , sir , but I am used to find Mr Riah at this time , and so I generally come at this time .
__label__1	The features of the surrounding picture were , a church with hoarding and scaffolding about it , which had been under suppositious repair so long that the means of repair looked a hundred years old , and had themselves fallen into decay ; a quantity of washed linen , spread to dry in the sun ; a number of houses at odds with one another and grotesquely out of the perpendicular , like rotten pre-Adamite cheeses cut into fantastic shapes and full of mites ; and a feverish bewilderment of windows , with their lattice-blinds all hanging askew , and something draggled and dirty dangling out of most of them .
__label__1	‘ I have discovered my friend <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> genteelly , and without addressing himself particularly to anyone , ‘ not in solitude , but partaking of a social meal in company with a widow lady , and one who is apparently her offspring -- in short , ’ said <NAME> , in another of his bursts of confidence , ‘ her son .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> , <NAME> , fair and rosy , and perpetually pitching himself head-foremost into all the deep running water in the surrounding country ; <NAME> , <NAME> , early riser , musical , classical , cheerful , kind , good-natured , social , contented , and boy-like ; <NAME> , <NAME> and good man , lately ‘ Coach ’ upon the chief Pagan high roads , but since promoted by a patron ( grateful for a well-taught son ) to his present <NAME> beat ; betakes himself to the gatehouse , on his way home to his early tea .
__label__1	<NAME> must be careful. ’ ‘ How do you mean ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
__label__1	But the sad scene she had witnessed , was not without its lesson of content and gratitude ; of content with the lot which left her health and freedom ; and gratitude that she was spared to the one relative and friend she loved , and to live and move in a beautiful world , when so many young creatures -- as young and full of hope as she -- were stricken down and gathered to their graves .
__label__1	`` I beg your pardon , miss ! ''
__label__1	If I was to try -- no matter whether on myself , on somebody else , or both -- any genteel mystifications , I should probably not succeed in them. ’ ‘ <NAME> , ’ returned the <NAME> , with an affable smile , but with the bloom on her cheeks standing out a little more vividly than usual as the neighbouring surface became paler , ‘ probably not. ’ ‘ Therefore , my good madam , ’ said Mr Meagles , at great pains to restrain himself , ‘ I hope I may , without offence , ask to have no such mystification played off upon me. ’ ‘ Mama Meagles , ’ observed <NAME> , ‘ your good man is incomprehensible. ’ Her turning to that worthy lady was an artifice to bring her into the discussion , quarrel with her , and vanquish her .
__label__0	Babies soon became quite insupportable , though till now so easy to bring up ; and for the first time <NAME> , the judge , was obliged to apply the rod to his youthful offspring .
__label__0	Neither rain nor any river , increased by a sudden swelling , could supply these ponds .
__label__1	Judged by mere worldly considerations and probabilities , his story is a very doubtful one . '
__label__1	It must not be lost. ’ He tapped at the cottage door .
__label__0	Then I understood it all .
__label__0	These sand banks are considered to be the richest turtle grounds in the basin of the <NAME> .
__label__1	Upon the latter , sits a man of sixty ; reading .
__label__0	On leaving <NAME> , he followed the course of a river for twelve days , and found numerous towns on its banks .
__label__1	<NAME> needed no prompting to despatch , and in little more than five minutes they were on their way to <NAME> .
__label__0	The apple , peach , apricot , cherry , and pear-trees , which have thriven well , have already supplied the colony with valuable shoots .
__label__0	The trot was exchanged for the amble as soon as <NAME> awoke , but the kibitka had not the less gained some versts .
__label__1	I should have very much liked to have given it to you long ago , because -- I felt that you were becoming so much our friend. ’ ‘ How can I be otherwise than proud of it at any time !
__label__1	The sound was curiously flawed by the wind ; and I was listening , and thinking how the wind assailed and tore it , when I heard a footstep on the stair .
__label__1	More remarkable by being so removed from the crowd it was among than if it had been lifted on a pedestal to be seen , the figure attracted all eyes .
__label__0	Ten years later a captain of <NAME> , named <NAME> , born on the 21st of December , 1484 , conceived the project of establishing a colony in the northern part of <NAME> .
__label__1	All day , I have had him near me. ’ ‘ What can I do ? ’ cried <NAME> , shuddering at these words .
__label__1	It ’ s a cruel thing to keep the dear child shut up there .
__label__1	It ’ s only to say that I shall see him to-morrow or maybe next day , and that I couldn ’ t do that little business for him this morning .
__label__0	I am now in his game . ''
__label__0	<NAME> seemed equally annoyed ; <NAME> and <NAME> muttered threatening words between their teeth .
__label__1	‘ That won ’ t do , ’ returned the lady .
__label__1	The host allowed to <NAME> that it was a little monotonous .
__label__1	<NAME> remind me of them to-morrow. ’ Little <NAME> was not without doubts how Mr <NAME> might take their patronage ; but she promised not to fail in the reminder .
__label__1	At three o ’ clock that afternoon , <NAME> took a last look at his little room , and made his way , as well as he could , through the throng of debtors who pressed eagerly forward to shake him by the hand , until he reached the lodge steps .
__label__1	I was not crying at anything in particular that I know of ; but somehow it made me cry , to see old friends .
__label__0	At heart he knows perfectly well that he IS going. ” “ By <NAME> ! ” said <NAME> , “ I swear -- ” “ Swear to nothing , friend <NAME> ; you have been ganged and weighed -- you and your powder , your guns , and your bullets ; so don ’ t let us say anything more about it. ” And , in fact , from that day until the arrival at <NAME> , <NAME> never opened his mouth .
__label__1	‘ Stay here of course , ’ the child had said in answer to my question , ‘ I always do ! ’ What could take him from home by night , and every night !
__label__0	As I spoke , I looked keenly around , examining with care every point of the horizon ; but nothing alive appeared to exist on these deserted shores .
__label__1	And you are in mourning too !
__label__1	‘ Mrs Quilp. ’ ‘ Yes , <NAME> , ’ said the timid sufferer .
__label__0	The wind blowing out of <NAME> Bay she ran before it , and thus showed her owners , much to their satisfaction , that she possessed a remarkably fast pair of heels , according to <NAME> 's mode of speaking .
__label__1	Similarly , <NAME> continues to post tremendous placards on the disputed thoroughfare and ( with his bird upon his head ) to hold forth vehemently against <NAME> in the sanctuary of his own home ; similarly , also , he defies him as of old in the little church by testifying a bland unconsciousness of his existence .
__label__0	But we have no interest in the latter part of his life , which ended in 1786 , and to that , therefore , we need not allude .
__label__1	If you 're not tired , <NAME> -- though I know it 's tiring to strangers -- will you tip him one more ?
__label__1	Thus he will say , touching his strange sights : ‘ Durdles come upon the old chap , ’ in reference to a buried magnate of ancient time and high degree , ‘ by striking right into the coffin with his pick .
__label__1	The perpetual tramp of boot-heels on the decks gave place to a heavy silence , and the whole human freight was stowed away below , excepting a very few stragglers , like myself , who were probably , like me , afraid to go there .
__label__1	‘ There is quite a bloom upon your demd countenance , ’ said <NAME> , seating himself unbidden , and arranging his hair and whiskers .
__label__1	They heard him mutter , “ One Hundred and <NAME> , <NAME> ; ” and when he looked about him , it evidently was for the strong fortress-walls which had long encompassed him .
__label__1	When she reached it , she looked back and saw the head of <NAME> peeping out of the low wooden passage , where she had issued her parting injunctions ; likewise the fist of <NAME> Mrs Brown shaking towards her .
__label__1	You see this place ; you know what sort of a place it is ; you are aware that there ’ s not a completer place of its size in this kingdom or elsewhere—I don ’ t care where—and here , got into the middle of it , like a maggot into a nut , is <NAME> .
__label__1	At least I had nothing in my mind that I could say .
__label__0	This instrument was designed for the purpose of rendering visible on the surface of the moon any object exceeding nine feet in diameter .
__label__1	With these words , he took a thick stick from <NAME> 's hands , who , having delivered another to <NAME> , busied himself in fastening on <NAME> 's cape .
__label__0	are we not as much so as you ?
__label__0	It seemed to be rising and falling beneath the successive blasts as if it were breathing ; the things which were cast out reached a great height in the air ; amid the jets of flame , torrents of lava were flowing down the side of the mountain ; here creeping between steaming rocks , there falling in cascades amid the purple vapor : and lower down a thousand streams united in one large river , which ran boiling into the sea .
__label__0	And then anger seized him .
__label__0	A young <NAME> , with an intelligent face , offered his services , which <NAME> accepted , promising so generous a reward as to materially stimulate his zeal .
__label__1	If we have n't all three met here without meaning it ! ''
__label__1	Sensible of the risk he ran , the <NAME> took leave of <NAME> , at those times , with the solemnity which became a man who might never return : exhorting him , in the event of his ( the <NAME> ’ s ) being lost sight of , for a time , to tread in the paths of virtue , and keep the brazen instruments well polished .
__label__0	The expedition lost sight of land on the 29th of May .
__label__0	No part of the island could have been more suitable to conceal a dwelling whose occupant wished to remain unknown .
__label__0	There , on a half-cracked hill of clay , stand a dozen houses , covered with the leaves of the _ “ boiassu ” _ palm placed round a central space .
__label__0	<NAME> for me , in my name only , if you like . ''
__label__0	I felt that the hands of my uncle and Hans were vigorously clasping my arms .
__label__1	`` Just as good as saw it , '' he returned .
__label__0	The man slipped on to the ground .
__label__1	'Then you 're a cruel man , ' said the matron vivaciously , as she held out her hand for the beadle 's cup ; 'and a very hard-hearted man besides . '
__label__1	I recollect one young fellow -- a tinker , I suppose , from his wallet and brazier -- who had a woman with him , and who faced about and stared at me thus ; and then roared to me in such a tremendous voice to come back , that I halted and looked round .
__label__1	‘ I won ’ t be held ! ’ cried the old man .
__label__1	‘ No one is useless in this world , ’ retorted the Secretary , ‘ who lightens the burden of it for any one else. ’ ‘ But I assure you I DON ’ T , Mr Rokesmith , ’ said <NAME> , half-crying .
__label__1	It can never be a solitary one to you and me .
__label__1	<NAME> and lower thoughts , as that his dead boy was now superseded by new ties , and he could forgive the having been supplanted in his affection , may have occasioned them .
__label__1	<NAME> tumbrils carry the day 's wine to <NAME> .
__label__1	As <NAME> appears , <NAME> hastens towards her , to bid her farewell .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> contrived to slip through the stowage of the hold , but his head swam , and , falling against a bale , he let his knife drop from his hand .
__label__1	I knew that when I was changed into a part of the vapor that had crept towards me but a little while before , like my own warning ghost , he would do as he had done in my sister 's case , -- make all haste to the town , and be seen slouching about there drinking at the alehouses .
__label__0	I am very glad to have seen you again !
__label__0	Here and there were opal shades of wonderful softness , running through bright spots like diamonds of fire , the brilliancy of which the eye could not bear .
__label__0	The first of December had arrived !
__label__1	We shall have plenty of time. ’ ‘ Capital ! ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> still prevailed , but not tranquillity ; for <NAME> caught a glimpse of shadows moving noiselessly over the tufts of CURRA-MAMMEL .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> looked at me , and I looked at her and said I was indeed .
__label__0	When they did happen to venture out of the region of facts , they never went so far as to attempt to divine the intentions of the <NAME> government , or even to criticize them .
__label__1	‘ For a young man , Mr <NAME> is not a very great walker ; and I observe that he generally falls tired , and requires a good long rest , when he has come as far as this .
__label__0	The only representative of the <NAME> company was the <NAME> whose name figured in the advertisement of the 7th of November .
__label__0	The engineer 's orders were obeyed , and whilst the reporter and the lad , the best marksmen in the colony , posted themselves in a good position , but out of the monkeys ' sight , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> climbed the plateau and entered the forest in order to kill some game , for it was now time for breakfast and they had no provisions remaining .
__label__1	Oh , what a misfortune is mine , ’ cried <NAME> , breaking off to wipe the starting perspiration from his face as he shook from head to foot , ‘ that I can not so control myself as to appear a stronger creature than this , when a man who has not felt in all his life what I have felt in a day can so command himself ! ’ He said it in a very agony , and even followed it with an errant motion of his hands as if he could have torn himself .
__label__1	These arrangements completed , they give the women good night and come out once more into black and foul Tom-all-Alone 's .
__label__0	Soon the boat was very near the whale .
__label__0	He says , `` There were about forty-two natives ; seven grown men , and eight women , the others appeared to be their children ; many of them were girls already arrived at maturity , who were even more lightly clad than their mothers .
__label__0	When <NAME> was on <NAME> , he knew the thermometer to fall to 56 degrees , ” said <NAME> .
__label__0	On silence being restored , the triumphant orator contented himself with adding the following remarks : `` Gentlemen , you will observe that I have but slightly touched upon this great question .
__label__1	_I_ do n't want to intrude upon your secrets . '
__label__1	And it was a comfort to me , and an impulse to me , and I felt a dignity rise up within me that was derived from him when I thought so .
__label__1	‘ I am sorry , <NAME> , ’ said Mr Dombey , ‘ that you should not have thought it your duty -- ’ She looked at him again .
__label__1	<NAME> , on the first morning of my so auspiciously beginning life on my own account , the oldest of the regular boys was summoned to show me my business .
__label__0	<NAME> took the best possible care of her .
__label__1	I am not about to be hipped again , <NAME> ; but I tell you , my good fellow , once more , that it would have been well for me ( and for more than me ) if I had had a steadfast and judicious father ! ’ His face was always full of expression , but I never saw it express such a dark kind of earnestness as when he said these words , with his glance bent on the fire .
__label__0	On the 6th June , the explorers left <NAME> 's Fort , as they called their winter quarters , and ascended the <NAME> for more than a hundred miles , its grassy plains , frequented by vast herds of bisons and deer , supplying them with plenty of provisions .
__label__1	That is my third dead child , and last .
__label__1	'And to-morrow two months it was done ! '
__label__0	`` You are right , <NAME> , '' answered <NAME> ; `` you are always thinking of the fuel . ''
__label__0	They know the good spots . ''
__label__1	‘ Oh indeed , ma ’ am , ’ thought <NAME> , ‘ you have been pining , have you ?
__label__0	In a corresponding part of the southern hemisphere you see <NAME> , the <NAME> , in which our poor human reason so often gets befogged .
__label__1	<NAME> or no message , I am going to see them tomorrow. ’ ‘ Then I will tell them so. ’ He lingered a moment , as though to give her the opportunity of prolonging the conversation if she wished .
__label__0	Thus he learned that , after long persecutions , <NAME> reappeared in <NAME> , and in 1839 founded a community at <NAME> , on the <NAME> , numbering twenty-five thousand souls , of which he became mayor , chief justice , and general-in-chief ; that he announced himself , in 1843 , as a candidate for the Presidency of the <NAME> ; and that finally , being drawn into ambuscade at <NAME> , he was thrown into prison , and assassinated by a band of men disguised in masks .
__label__1	My little portmanteau was in the boot under my feet ; I had but to turn a hinge to get it out ; I threw it down before me , got down after it , and was left at the first lamp on the first stones of the town pavement .
__label__0	“ You wish to shake my hands ! ” said <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> , do you turn against me after these many years ? ’ ‘ I do , if it ’ s turning against you to hear what I don ’ t know , and say what I know .
__label__1	<NAME> back as a die .
__label__1	The <NAME> was not troubled with the faintest idea of any difficulty in retaining <NAME> , or of any responsibility thereby incurred .
__label__1	He rarely joined them on the Saturdays now .
__label__1	'Let me out , ' said <NAME> .
__label__1	An exploratory blackbeetle now and then was found immovable upon the stairs , or in an upper room , as wondering how he got there .
__label__0	`` What a pity I ca n't find room in there , '' said <NAME> , regretting that his height did not allow of his trying the adventure .
__label__0	The <NAME> understood me , and signed me to follow him .
__label__1	<NAME> was so near her when they shook hands , that he could see a small tiny tear , yet trembling on an eyelash .
__label__0	In a moment the reporter and his two companions had crossed the corral and reached the gate of the palisade behind which <NAME> was heard growling sullenly .
__label__0	Do not let us leave our geography incomplete. ” “ All right ! ” said <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> knows that better than <NAME> , though she taunts me because she has made me her dependent .
__label__1	I 'll never go another step in opposition to it .
__label__1	She sees nothing and hears nothing .
__label__0	But this is all over now ; the _prestige_ has gone , and we make our tour of the globe nowadays as we should then have made that of <NAME> . ''
__label__1	<NAME> , <NAME> , aw a muddle !
__label__1	Utterly preposterous as his cravat was , and as his collars were , I was conscious of a sort of dignity in the look .
__label__1	You may know the name. ’ ‘ Never heard of it. ’ Mrs <NAME> said it , and Mr <NAME> echoed it .
__label__1	<NAME> , sir ! ’ ‘ Well , ma ’ am ? ’ retorted <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ We are older than we were , I see , ’ said my aunt .
__label__1	Indeed , he was fearful of something happening to Mr Pancks in the violent conflict that took place between the breath he jerked out of himself and the smoke he jerked into himself .
__label__0	And they could be sure that the faithful dog would not allow them to be surprised , but would bark at the least appearance of danger .
__label__1	She has n't much strength in her , so I easily kept her quiet .
__label__1	If I am to remain and hold up my head , I must be scratched .
__label__0	If the right time is known on board , that is to say , the correct time by which the meridian could be computed at the moment of any given observation , and if at the same time , the exact time at the port from which the ship had started , or that if any known meridian could be ascertained , the difference of time would evidently give that of the meridians , at the rate of fifteen degrees per hour , or one degree per four minutes .
__label__1	I was robbed at first setting out , and have walked all the way , and have never slept in a bed since I began the journey. ’ Here my self-support gave way all at once ; and with a movement of my hands , intended to show her my ragged state , and call it to witness that I had suffered something , I broke into a passion of crying , which I suppose had been pent up within me all the week .
__label__1	Is not your sorrow mine ?
__label__0	Many specimens of the porcine race fled before them , and these animals , which were singularly active , did not appear to be in a humour to allow themselves to be approached .
__label__1	It meant , when it was given , that whoever had this house could want nothing else .
__label__1	‘ Where ’ s <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Good-night , <NAME> ! ’ ‘ Good-bye , <NAME> ! ’ ‘ <NAME> hands once more , <NAME> ! ’ This was still <NAME> ’ s cry , after she was shut up with her little maid , in the coach .
__label__1	‘ My dear , I haven ’ t one ! ’ ‘ Not one ? ’ ‘ Well !
__label__0	A moment comes when the centre of gravity of these masses is displaced , and then they are completely overturned .
__label__1	wo n't his manners do then ? ” asked <NAME> , plucking a black-currant leaf .
__label__0	<NAME> and <NAME> feared that <NAME> might take it into his head to get out ; but that gentleman contented himself with saying to his servant , `` See what is the matter . ''
__label__1	She was a spoilt child ; but how could she be otherwise ?
__label__1	People mutht be amuthed , <NAME> , thomehow , ’ continued <NAME> , rendered more pursy than ever , by so much talking ; ‘ they can ’ t be alwayth a working , nor yet they can ’ t be alwayth a learning .
__label__1	What shall we do ? ’ ‘ Have you no scheme on foot that will bring in anything ? ’ Mr <NAME> plunged into his whiskers for reflection , and came out hopeless : ‘ No ; as adventurers we are obliged to play rash games for chances of high winnings , and there has been a run of luck against us. ’ She was resuming , ‘ Have you nothing -- ’ when he stopped her .
__label__0	Besides , <NAME> hoped later to establish an hydraulic apparatus , which would avoid all fatigue and loss of time , for the inhabitants of <NAME> .
__label__0	It required some time to calm our troubled looks .
__label__0	Beyond that the tints darkened into fine gradations of ultramarine , and faded into vague obscurity .
__label__0	What a noise on the surface of the waves !
__label__0	<NAME> first made for <NAME> , a small town situated at about twenty days ' march from the coast .
__label__1	Very faint and giddy. ’ ‘ Are you in pain , dear mother ? ’ ‘ I think there ’ s a pain somewhere in the room , ’ said Mrs. Gradgrind , ‘ but I couldn ’ t positively say that I have got it. ’ After this strange speech , she lay silent for some time .
__label__1	Yes. ’ ‘ He was a good ‘ un , ’ said Mr Boffin , ‘ and he had a sister worthy of him .
__label__0	My disclosures , unfortunately , can not put you on the track of <NAME> , and you perceive that you have made but a poor bargain by coming to my terms. ” The quartermaster said no more , but crossed his arms in his usual fashion and waited .
__label__1	He was a simple-hearted old gentleman , of a shrinking , subdued spirit , accustomed to retirement , and very little acquainted with the world , which he had left many years before to come and settle in that place .
__label__0	“ I would give a month of my life , ” he cried , impetuously , “ for every hour that the old fellow goes sleeping on. ” “ You might be making a bad bargain , ” said <NAME> , smiling .
__label__0	On the whole they appear to be a good sort of people , but so weak that one overlooks their faults .
__label__1	Why it may be his <NAME> one of these days , in part .
__label__1	‘ All I will add is , <NAME> forbid that I should touch my Uncle ’ s possessions , <NAME> !
__label__1	for Pocket-Breaches , who instantly begins to find out that the Lammles are the only people ever entered on his soul ’ s register , who are NOT the oldest and dearest friends he has in the world .
__label__1	‘ I knew you would admire my brother .
__label__1	Some of the rest lingered a little , marrying golden liqueur glasses to <NAME> tables with sticky rings ; on the desperate chance of Mr Merdle ’ s saying something .
__label__0	It was necessary to carry Harding to the <NAME> , and that as soon as possible .
__label__1	She had risen , as the nurse said , and the lashes of her eyes were wet with tears .
__label__1	If you 'll only let me cry a little longer .
__label__1	‘ They can ’ t be very heavy. ’ ‘ The weight o ’ the pair , mum , ’ said <NAME> , eyeing them with the look of a man who was calculating within half an ounce or so , ‘ would be a trifle under that of <NAME> Cromwell. ’ <NAME> was very much surprised that the man should be so accurately acquainted with the weight of one whom she had read of in books as having lived considerably before their time , but speedily forgot the subject in the joy of hearing that they were to go forward in the caravan , for which she thanked its lady with unaffected earnestness .
__label__0	Before he was judge at <NAME> , and chief magistrate in the province , <NAME> had known the young clerk at the time he was being prosecuted for the murder in the diamond arrayal .
__label__0	<NAME> , doubtless by the advice of <NAME> , captured the town of <NAME> la Hacha ; after which he reached <NAME> d'Ulloa , having encountered a fearful storm .
__label__1	repeated the young lady , with great stress upon the word .
__label__0	“ If I had to fight him , it was God that struck him , and his body ought not to go unburied ! ” And so orders were given to the second pirogue to recover the corpse , and take it to the bank to await its burial .
__label__1	I glanced down at the foot from which the shoe was absent , and saw that the silk stocking on it , once white , now yellow , had been trodden ragged .
__label__0	There was certainly a chance that they might be able to pass under cover of the night , and penetrate into <NAME> .
__label__0	“ From the province of <NAME> Geraes. ” “ And you were born -- -- ” “ In the capital of the diamond district , Tijuco. ” Those who had seen <NAME> at this moment would have been surprised at the fixity of his look which met that of <NAME> .
__label__1	But anything like the utter dreariness and desolation that met my eyes when I literally ‘ tumbled up ’ on deck at noon , I never saw .
__label__0	Fortunately , they could still get a few minutes farther north , but only by breaking the new ice with huge beams , or by blowing it up with charges of powder .
__label__1	How they said , ‘ Bagstock , your friend <NAME> now , what is the view he takes of such and such a question ?
__label__0	His curiosity as a naturalist overcame his hunger as a traveler .
__label__1	If you do otherwise , you will do wrong , and you will have made me do wrong in ever bringing you together . ''
__label__1	He rose to honour the toast ; and , carefully depositing his empty pipe in a corner , advanced to the table , filled a glass with spirits , and drank off its contents .
__label__0	She would be well worth the trouble ! ” In fact , if the brig was still fit to navigate , the colonists ’ chances of returning to their native land were singularly increased .
__label__0	The engineer , towards whom all eyes were turned , shook his head negatively .
__label__1	Yielding by degrees to the influence of the exciting liquid , rendered more so by the heat , <NAME> expressed a strong desire to recollect a song which he had heard in his infancy , and the attempt proving abortive , sought to stimulate his memory with more glasses of punch , which appeared to have quite a contrary effect ; for , from forgetting the words of the song , he began to forget how to articulate any words at all ; and finally , after rising to his legs to address the company in an eloquent speech , he fell into the barrow , and fast asleep , simultaneously .
__label__0	`` Is the dugong dangerous to attack ? ''
__label__1	<NAME> hastened to the window of his office , and looked in .
__label__1	I had no companion left but my bird , and him I carried with me in his cage .
__label__0	The fact of their departure had only been communicated to J. T. <NAME> and Mrs. Scorbitt .
__label__0	Here a good anchorage was found .
__label__1	They ’ re all done by one hand ; a little hand it is , not so old as yours , but a very clever one. ’ As the schoolmaster said this , he saw that a small blot of ink had been thrown on one of the copies , so he took a penknife from his pocket , and going up to the wall , carefully scraped it out .
__label__0	Three hours later at low tide , the greater part of the sand forming the bed of the channel was uncovered .
__label__1	'Take a seat , will you ? '
__label__1	'More like the noise of powdering a iron bar on a nutmeg-grater , ' suggested <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> relieved her from her perplexity by taking his departure without delay : <NAME> making many gracious inquiries why he never came to see them ; and <NAME> anathematising the stairs with great volubility as he followed them down , in the hope of inducing <NAME> to look round , -- a hope , however , which was destined to remain ungratified .
__label__1	`` Do you know , '' <NAME> asks her , signing to her to bring her chair nearer , `` do you know , <NAME> , that I am different to you from what I am to any one ? ''
__label__1	And where ’ s the good of it ?
__label__1	I loved my wife dearly , and I was happy ; but the happiness I had vaguely anticipated , once , was not the happiness I enjoyed , and there was always something wanting .
__label__0	Of far greater interest , however , was the survey made in 1830 by the whaler <NAME> .
__label__0	“ We are going to <NAME> ! ” With a grave face , and without speaking a word , <NAME> received the congratulations of his son and the kisses of his daughter .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> kept his word , and remained unmarried , for two years .
__label__0	This kiss made the lieutenant chief of the council , and placed him temporarily above the khodja .
__label__0	By and by the returning waves would break over the deck in great masses .
__label__1	The impending shadow of a great affliction , and a great disgrace that had no distinct form in it yet , fell like a stain upon the quiet place where I had worked and played as a boy , and did it a cruel wrong .
__label__0	Did they mean to say that he had seen nothing at all ?
__label__1	And I ’ m glad to see he ’ s having his fire kindled up , for it ’ s chilly after the wet , and the <NAME> had both a damp feel and a damp touch this afternoon , and he was very shivery. ’ They all three look towards an old stone gatehouse crossing the <NAME> , with an arched thoroughfare passing beneath it .
__label__1	‘ An old acquaintance of mine , sir , an old pensioner. ’ And then said , ‘ Be covered , my good <NAME> ; put your hat on , ’ with great consideration .
__label__1	' I have no brother , ' replied <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> continued to sail between the 15th and 16th degrees , and was not long in finding himself `` all of a sudden '' in the midst of islands which were half submerged .
__label__1	I am far from sure that I believed there was anything hopeful in it , but my mind was thoroughly made up that it must be carried into execution .
__label__0	Once , when somebody heard him muttering : `` He 's now seventeen days in the ocean ! ''
__label__1	<NAME> ceased to be , within the shadow of the roof .
__label__0	“ He ! ” cried <NAME> , from whom the word escaped with a fury he could not conquer .
__label__0	365 The Emperor of <NAME> .
__label__0	I reckoned then we should have eight hours to swim before sunrise , an operation quite practicable if we relieved each other .
__label__1	WHEN <NAME> awoke , it was so dark , that looking out of bed , he could scarcely distinguish the transparent window from the opaque walls of his chamber .
__label__1	I felicitate you on your admiration. ’ ‘ I neither know nor ask , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ of whom you speak. ’ ‘ Della bella <NAME> , sir , as they say in <NAME> .
__label__1	Whatever the old girl says , do -- do it ! ''
__label__0	Making their progress with the unwonted rapidity which was attributable to their specific lightness , <NAME> and his companions soon found themselves near a grove of sycamores and eucalyptus massed in picturesque confusion at the base of a little hill .
__label__1	The interest displayed in <NAME> ’ s countenance is most intense , as <NAME> and the guard try to squeeze the cod-fish into the boot , first head first , and then tail first , and then top upward , and then bottom upward , and then side-ways , and then long-ways , all of which artifices the implacable cod-fish sturdily resists , until the guard accidentally hits him in the very middle of the basket , whereupon he suddenly disappears into the boot , and with him , the head and shoulders of the guard himself , who , not calculating upon so sudden a cessation of the passive resistance of the cod-fish , experiences a very unexpected shock , to the unsmotherable delight of all the porters and bystanders .
__label__0	It is a fort , or rather a fortified village , surrounded by high walls , in good repair , and furnished with bastions .
__label__1	`` You could n't have met in a better place , '' said old <NAME> , removing his pipe from his mouth .
__label__1	`` I am not aware that it can . ''
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> had previously volunteered to go home with us and had withdrawn to dress himself for the purpose .
__label__1	Why , I remember the time when old Maunders as had three-and-twenty wans -- I remember the time when old Maunders had in his cottage in <NAME> Fields in the winter time , when the season was over , eight male and female dwarfs setting down to dinner every day , who was waited on by eight old giants in green coats , red smalls , blue cotton stockings , and high-lows : and there was one dwarf as had grown elderly and wicious who whenever his giant wasn ’ t quick enough to please him , used to stick pins in his legs , not being able to reach up any higher .
__label__1	How many ? ’ ‘ Two , ’ rejoined <NAME> .
__label__1	`` Sir , '' returned <NAME> , `` as I believe I have already mentioned , it is next door .
__label__1	Perhaps with an eye to first impressions , Mr <NAME> was very carefully and trimly dressed , that morning .
__label__1	While he thus walked up and down with his eyes on the ground , <NAME> , in the chair from which she had risen to receive him , sat listening anew .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> dear , ’ said <NAME> , with a melancholy smile , ‘ after what has passed , I am sure Ma will tell Pa that he may tell Bella we shall all be glad to see her and her husband. ’ Mr <NAME> said he was sure of it too ; murmuring how eminently he respected <NAME> , and ever must , and ever would .
__label__1	`` <NAME> will give us a good deal of trouble -- '' `` It is the character of such a mind , <NAME> , '' <NAME> interrupts him , `` TO give trouble .
__label__0	After leaving Zanzibar it was <NAME> India whose coast <NAME> explored , sailing towards the north , and first Abassy or <NAME> , a fertile country where the manufacture of fine cotton cloths and buckram is largely carried on .
__label__0	“ And what does his Excellency say ? ” inquired Hakkabut .
__label__0	When answers of this kind did not lead to blows , the case was an exceptional one indeed .
__label__1	To prepare the mind for such a heavy sleep , its growth must be stopped by rigour and cruelty in childhood ; there must be years of misery and suffering , lightened by no ray of hope ; the chords of the heart , which beat a quick response to the voice of gentleness and affection , must have rusted and broken in their secret places , and bear the lingering echo of no old word of love or kindness .
__label__1	‘ Was ever man so beset as I ?
__label__1	This was such a very singular proceeding on the part of an utter stranger , and his appearance was so extremely peculiar , that <NAME> , who had a sufficiently keen sense of the ridiculous , could not refrain from breaking into a smile as he inquired whether <NAME> had any commands for him .
__label__1	‘ But I would have you know , <NAME> , ’ resumed the governess in a tone of increased severity , ‘ that you can not be permitted -- if it be only for the sake of preserving a proper example and decorum in this establishment -- that you can not be permitted , and that you shall not be permitted , to fly in the face of your superiors in this exceedingly gross manner .
__label__0	Such a shot , the honor of which belonged to his dear boy .
__label__1	I ’ ll bet that I ’ d find her if she was above ground , I would , as quick as anybody , master .
__label__1	“ Nothing human could have held life in the boy but his determination to tell all his wrong .
__label__1	You will please consider me your guardian .
__label__1	It sheared off heads so many , that it , and the ground it most polluted , were a rotten red .
__label__1	‘ By keeping silence upon the subject , my dear sir , ’ returned brother Charles .
__label__1	‘ Why couldn ’ t you let me be ! ’ said <NAME> , ‘ when I was contented ?
__label__1	Everything remaining perfectly quiet , he got into <NAME> ’ s bed , once more , and drawing the clothes over his head , laughed till he was nearly smothered .
__label__1	‘ It strikes me rather as a hang-MAN air , ’ returned <NAME> .
__label__0	They advanced some way into the wood , but to their great disappointment , they as yet saw no signs of any human being having passed that way .
__label__0	[ Illustration : <NAME> rose with cries of despair , and hurried to the bed of old <NAME> . ]
__label__1	In the morning he was downhearted again , and would have sustained himself by giving me all the money he had in his possession , gold and silver too , if my aunt had not interposed , and limited the gift to five shillings , which , at his earnest petition , were afterwards increased to ten .
__label__0	“ We will keep it secret ! ” said <NAME> .
__label__1	`` You 're not tall enough to reach the tub ! ''
__label__0	`` Did you expect to get on a passing whale-ship ? ''
__label__0	He must have brought news from <NAME> ! ” “ Well , old Manasseh , what if he has ? ” “ I should like to see him. ” “ Can ’ t be. ” The Jew sidled close up to <NAME> , and laying his hand on his arm , said in a low and insinuating tone , “ I am poor , you know ; but I would give you a few reals if you would let me talk to this stranger. ” But as if he thought he was making too liberal an offer , he added , “ Only it must be at once. ” “ He is too tired ; he is worn out ; he is fast asleep , ” answered <NAME> .
__label__1	I hope that when I have the pleasure of seeing you , next , this passing cloud will have given place to sunshine .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> any means by which to warn his master ?
__label__0	Mutually reserved , though ever courteous , the count and the captain were secretly drawn together by the prospect of a common danger ; and as their return to the earth appeared to them to become more and more dubious , they abandoned their views of narrow isolation , and tried to embrace the wider philosophy that acknowledges the credibility of a habitable universe .
__label__1	I was tired of reading , and dead sleepy ; but having leave , as a high treat , to sit up until my mother came home from spending the evening at a neighbour ’ s , I would rather have died upon my post ( of course ) than have gone to bed .
__label__1	The steamer for <NAME> and the steamer for <NAME> would start from <NAME> at about nine on Thursday morning .
__label__0	The wish of the dying <NAME> was so urgent that resistance became impossible .
__label__0	`` Yes , we will search for him , '' answered <NAME> ; `` but we shall not discover this powerful being who performs such wonders , until he pleases to call us to him ! ''
__label__1	He lies , dressed , across a large unseemly bed , upon a bedstead that has indeed given way under the weight upon it .
__label__0	The lunar panorama was unrolling all its splendors beneath them , and they could not bear to lose one of its slightest details .
__label__1	<NAME> and affable as man could be , Mr <NAME> picked his way along the streets and hummed a soft tune as he went .
__label__1	‘ And what about the cash , my existence ’ s jewel ? ’ said <NAME> , when these endearments ceased .
__label__0	“ To-morrow , ” resumed the doctor , “ we shall bury him in the <NAME> soil which he has besprinkled with his blood. ” During the rest of the night the body was watched , turn by turn , by the three travellers , and not a word disturbed the solemn silence .
__label__0	When he snatches a moment of rest I really can not say .
__label__1	Let me go ! ” “ Ah ! ” he returned , “ I 'll let you go .
__label__0	“ He sees ! ” he exclaimed , “ he sees ! ” And like a wild beast trying to retreat into its den , step by step , terrified , he drew back to the end of the room .
__label__0	If the wind had risen , no one could have withstood the temperature .
__label__1	But now a fearful circumstance occurs .
__label__1	‘ Yes , sir , ’ returned <NAME> ; ‘ but <NAME> has come back , and he begs the favour of a word. ’ As he held the door open with his hand , <NAME> looked at me , and looked at <NAME> , and looked at the dishes , and looked at the plates , and looked at every object in the room , I thought , -- yet seemed to look at nothing ; he made such an appearance all the while of keeping his red eyes dutifully on his master .
__label__0	This was not a new country to <NAME> , as he had visited it about 1280 , when he was on a mission for the Emperor .
__label__1	It won ’ t do ; I told the clerk when I took my places that it wouldn ’ t do .
__label__1	I really don ’ t know , <NAME> .
__label__1	His colour changed though , when , without a pause , it came on through the heavy door , and passed into the room before his eyes .
__label__1	‘ If you are quite determined , come ! ’ But she had to take her farewell of the male part of the company yet , and every one of them had to unfold his arms ( for they all assumed the professional attitude when they found themselves near <NAME> ) , and give her a parting kiss—Master <NAME> excepted , in whose young nature there was an original flavour of the misanthrope , who was also known to have harboured matrimonial views , and who moodily withdrew .
__label__1	It was ratified only the other day .
__label__1	However , he took affairs as coolly as it was in human nature to do , and entertained himself with the facetious idea of the training more than once .
__label__1	For , the state of the man was murderous .
__label__1	He would have made a wonderful cabinet-maker , said <NAME> , ‘ if there had been the money to put him to it. ’ She had seen him handle tools that he had borrowed to mend the mangle , or to knock a broken piece of furniture together , in a surprising manner .
__label__0	The nature of the voyage demanded vessels of peculiar construction .
__label__1	No , <NAME> , to none .
__label__0	I did not say one word .
__label__1	I spoke to him , and he spoke to me .
__label__0	On the 18th , night-fall found them entering <NAME> 's , at the further end of the pass between <NAME> and <NAME> .
__label__1	She is gone with me upon a distant voyage .
__label__1	‘ Not at all caring for , and indeed as it seems to me rather enjoying , ’ said <NAME> , with peculiar unction , ‘ the precious kick-up and row that will come off between Mr Twemlow and the said great party ? ’ This required no answer , and received none .
__label__0	The joiners had plenty to do .
__label__0	It is a part of my very soul that I have shut up in each of these cases of iron , silver , or gold !
__label__1	Here on the head of an empty barrel stood on end were an ink-bottle , some old stumps of pens , and some dirty playbills ; and against the wall were pasted several large printed alphabets in several plain hands .
__label__1	Who passes by this road so late ?
__label__1	If I did think of it at odd moments now and then , I had only to be busy and forget it .
__label__1	With many adieus and good wishes , <NAME> went his way .
__label__1	‘ Yes , mother , ’ returned Alice , stooping forward for a moment and kissing her , but endeavouring , even in the act , to disengage herself from her embrace .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> had smoked his evening pipe and there were preparations for some supper by and by .
__label__1	By sticking to it till one or two in the morning , I get oblivion .
__label__0	They required to go round the bay to gain the coast at the 37th parallel , the exact point where <NAME> was to wait their arrival .
__label__1	<NAME> masses of the same material , carried forward by the wind , and shone through by the burning sun , stalked in the distance like pillars of living fire .
__label__1	‘ I don ’ t know what it may be , I don ’ t know what it may not be , ’ said <NAME> ; ‘ it ’ s some secret in which your uncle is concerned , but what , I ’ ve not yet been able to discover , although I have my strong suspicions .
__label__1	That was well done ; ” they had left the spot ; “ it shall not be in vain .
__label__0	The Major never opened his mouth , nor <NAME> , whose _amour propre_ , as an <NAME> , seemed quite wounded by having allowed himself to go on a wrong scent .
__label__1	Let us advance by steps .
__label__0	“ Famously , my Lord , he swims like a fish. ” “ <NAME> ! ” shouted the Major , in a stentorian voice .
__label__1	You may depend upon it , it would have a superb effect . '
__label__1	I am tired to death of the matter . ''
__label__1	`` Your own feeling tells you that you were not what you are , '' she returned .
__label__0	No , no ; it can not be .
__label__1	In obedience to this summons the clerk got off the high stool ( to which he had communicated a high polish by countless gettings off and on ) , and presented himself in <NAME> ’ s room .
__label__0	At daybreak the next morning the watch saw a sail ; it was the <NAME> , a <NAME> corvette , sailing towards the <NAME> , bound to <NAME> .
__label__0	Thus , in their trigonometrical surveys <NAME> and his associates never calculated the third angle by the observation of the two first , but always observed all three .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> and his gang seemed to have flown away like a flock of marauding birds .
__label__1	But he sat and looked at her , notwithstanding , for nearly two hours , as she sat looking at the fire , until he was again called out .
__label__1	“ I thought you seemed as if you did n't like them ? ” “ I ca n't pretend that I do like them , and I suppose you do n't particularly .
__label__1	inquired the beadle , affectionately pressing her hand .
__label__0	`` Just one degree and a half above zero , <NAME> ! ''
__label__0	`` Yes , yes , captain , I was wrong , '' replied <NAME> ; `` it was a wicked idea indeed that I had , and nothing justifies it .
__label__1	But <NAME> could not say where <NAME> was gone , except that it was in <NAME> , and no one could say , she remembered , unless it were Mr Toots .
__label__1	But he did , '' said <NAME> , raising his laughing eyes in playful astonishment ; `` he did interpose that ridiculous figure , and he does , and he will again .
__label__1	`` No letter that can possibly have been overlooked ? ''
__label__1	On the entrance of his friends , that gentleman laid down his knife and fork , and with a mournful air advanced to meet them .
__label__1	Dropping in at Mr <NAME> ’ s office on the previous evening , in the absence of that gentleman and his learned sister , he had lighted upon Mr <NAME> , who chanced at the moment to be sprinkling a glass of warm gin and water on the dust of the law , and to be moistening his clay , as the phrase goes , rather copiously .
__label__1	What do you see in me that causes you to -- ha -- concentrate your solicitude on me in that -- hum -- very particular manner ? ’ ‘ I did not know it , father ; I beg your pardon .
__label__1	But , <NAME> thought he saw , as he leaned forward on his bench in the dusk , with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands , that he was in some misty way asking himself , “ Why not ? ” The sagacity of the man of business perceived an advantage here , and determined to hold it .
__label__1	But he had his reward .
__label__1	‘ Say you haven ’ t , Mr Riah. ’ ‘ Sir , I have , ’ replied the old man in a low voice .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> , the physician , had plenty to do with the heartburns , inflammations , and nervous affections , which proved to what a strange degree the nerves of the people had been irritated .
__label__0	The ball opened with <NAME> dances , the airs for which were very lively , and like those of the <NAME> dances given a short time since in <NAME> .
__label__1	Come ! ’ and his teeth fairly shone again .
__label__0	there is the gulf of <NAME> !
__label__0	But that will not be ! ''
__label__1	I am going home. ’ ‘ Deed , sir ?
__label__1	‘ They were poor -- they could not be otherwise when the man pursued such courses ; but the woman ’ s unceasing and unwearied exertions , early and late , morning , noon , and night , kept them above actual want .
__label__0	From this point the pass began to be difficult , and even dangerous .
__label__0	It was then discovered , by taking the longitude 20 degrees 43 minutes east of the <NAME> meridian , that they were in the parallel ( 40 degrees to 41 degrees south ) of the islands named in <NAME> 's chart as <NAME> and <NAME> , and not marked at all upon <NAME> maps .
__label__0	Before bed-time every man , woman , and child in the country had heard it and gone into ecstasies over it .
__label__1	If I might make so bold as to defend that extravagant conception , Mr Merdle , I would hint that it originated after the Railroad-share epoch , in the times of a certain <NAME> bank , and of one or two other equally laudable enterprises .
__label__1	Accordingly , I took the jacket off , that I might learn to do without it ; and carrying it under my arm , began a tour of inspection of the various slop-shops .
__label__0	The news of this great discovery was telegraphed over the <NAME> with great rapidity ; the papers printed the name of <NAME> at the head of their columns as that of a martyr , and <NAME> glowed with pride .
__label__1	His eyebrows , which had been in the highest degree portentous , smoothed their rugged bristling aspect , and became serene ; his eyes , which had been nearly closed in the severity of his mental exercise , opened freely ; a smile which had been at first but three specks -- one at the right-hand corner of his mouth , and one at the corner of each eye -- gradually overspread his whole face , and , rippling up into his forehead , lifted the glazed hat : as if that too had been aground with <NAME> , and were now , like him , happily afloat again .
__label__1	Sings in the choir. ’ ‘ In the spire ? ’ ‘ Choir. ’ ‘ What ’ s that ? ’ <NAME> rises from his papers , and comes to his doorstep .
__label__1	His black hat was brown before he could afford a coat , his pantaloons were white at the seams and knees before he could buy a pair of boots , his boots had worn out before he could treat himself to new pantaloons , and , by the time he worked round to the hat again , that shining modern article roofed-in an ancient ruin of various periods .
__label__1	I must see him to-night , for I faithfully promised to do so .
__label__0	No wonder that <NAME> cared so little to quit his observatory ; for throughout those calm , clear <NAME> nights , when the book of the firmament lay open before him , he could revel in a spectacle which no previous astronomer had ever been permitted to enjoy .
__label__0	But at any rate this ship brought news from the world , perhaps even from their native land .
__label__0	The <NAME> and the negroes ran into their huts and cabins .
__label__1	But <NAME> , instead of sharing in those transports , tried to check them ( though very kindly ) , and looked confused and out of sorts .
__label__1	‘ So my son took , of his own will , and on no compulsion , to the course in which he can always , when it is his pleasure , outstrip every competitor , ’ she pursued .
__label__1	`` And so , <NAME> , '' says <NAME> of the shooting gallery after several turns in silence , `` you were dreaming of the country last night ? ''
__label__1	The lock of hair that had escaped and curled loosely over her brow , the traces of tears yet scarcely dry , the flushed cheek , the look of sorrow , all fired some dormant train of recollection in the old man ’ s breast ; and the face of his dead brother seemed present before him , with the very look it bore on some occasion of boyish grief , of which every minutest circumstance flashed upon his mind , with the distinctness of a scene of yesterday .
__label__0	The real truth was that <NAME> had taken the lead with the view of being the first to reach the pretended island of <NAME> , of which the riches had been described in glowing colours by the natives .
__label__1	‘ May I -- <NAME> , I but ask the question humbly -- may I say it ?
__label__1	He shrunk , as if to let the thing go by .
__label__0	“ It is in expiation of his crimes. ” At that moment the boat , in charge of <NAME> , turned away .
__label__1	He ’ s never been heerd fur to complain .
__label__1	And when I wait upon ‘ em , they ’ ll say to me sometimes -- WITH IT ON -- thick , and no mistake -- “ How am I looking , <NAME> ?
__label__0	She fell in before long with the current from the coast of <NAME> , and on the 7th of September entered the <NAME> hemisphere .
__label__1	And the broad stomacher heaves , and the quaint upright old-fashioned figure bends under its load of affectionate distress .
__label__0	About half past twelve o'clock , <NAME> broke the dead silence by saying that after a careful calculation they were now only about 875 miles from the <NAME> 's surface , a distance two hundred miles less in length than the lunar radius , and which was still to be diminished as they advanced further north .
__label__1	I came upon the amiable creature -- if you ’ ll imagine my feelings , <NAME> and <NAME> -- in the act of making his will. ’ Her daughter looked round from the window quickly .
__label__0	The ambassador was accompanied by the minister plenipotentiary , and followed by his page and interpreter .
__label__0	He tried to make out the words which the poor fellow could not pronounce .
__label__0	<NAME> took advantage of the latter and of the first minister both being absent on a neighbouring island , to pay a visit to another wife of Kamea-Mea .
__label__1	I looked up , and met her sharp bright glance respectfully .
__label__1	Throws some Light upon <NAME> ’ s <NAME> ; but whether for <NAME> or Evil the <NAME> must determine After an anxious consideration of the painful and embarrassing position in which he was placed , <NAME> decided that he ought to lose no time in frankly stating it to the kind brothers .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> ’ t so much as look at me like that , or I won ’ t talk to you at all , ’ vociferated <NAME> .
__label__1	Let me have a word with you outside . '
__label__1	‘ And these heer pretty ones , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	He says he particularly wants you to When I had taken this commission on myself prospectively , <NAME> relapsed into perfect silence ; and I , feeling quite worn out by all that had happened lately , lay down on a sack in the cart and fell asleep .
__label__1	It was a picture of cold , silent decay .
__label__1	And this was the first passage of <NAME> ’ s first love .
__label__1	Devoutly thankful to <NAME> for his recovered self-possession , he thought , “ There is but another now , ” and turned to walk again .
__label__0	Now , of the seniors , there remained ten men , counting <NAME> ; of the new men there were thirteen ; twenty-three in all .
__label__0	Suppose the brave fellow should take it into his head that we have abandoned him ? ” “ He !
__label__1	‘ I am afraid , <NAME> , that his feelings have made him so indeed , ’ said Mrs. Weller mournfully .
__label__0	But matters had not improved much when , towards four o'clock in the morning , the travellers found themselves on the 50th parallel , and at a distance of only about 375 miles from the lunar surface .
__label__1	So we are not much alike in that particular .
__label__1	‘ Why , that leaves you fifty , ’ retorted <NAME> .
__label__1	Sometimes there is n't any milk , and sometimes the cat drinks it .
__label__0	“ But suppose the change of axis throws the seas out of their existing basins ? ” “ And if the ocean level is lowered at different points , ” said <NAME> , “ some people may find themselves so high up in the world that communication with them will be impossible ! ” “ If they go up too high they will not be able to breathe ! ” said <NAME> .
__label__1	They were high from the ground , and they burnt with the steady dulness of artificial light in air that is seldom renewed .
__label__1	I hope he didn ’ t catch cold , that dreadful night , Sir. ’ There was a momentary look of deep slyness in <NAME> Trotter ’ s eye , as he said this , which ran a thrill through <NAME> ’ s clenched fist , as he burned with a desire to make a demonstration on his ribs .
__label__0	-- '' That there is no choice between them ! ''
__label__0	On the 5th January the <NAME> once more put to sea , surveyed <NAME> on the 20th , <NAME> six days later , <NAME> on the 28th , and the little <NAME> on the 8th February , arriving the next day off <NAME> , a small island three or four miles in circumference with one rather pointed peak covered with vegetation .
__label__0	The most superstitious declared they had seen these fantastic creatures with their own eyes .
__label__0	Harding also reminded his companions of the singular behavior of <NAME> and Jup when they prowled round the mouth of the well , which placed <NAME> in communication with the sea , and he told them that he had explored the well , without discovering anything suspicious .
__label__1	<NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ what is the matter , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Never mind , <NAME> ! ’ replied <NAME> , with haughty defiance .
__label__0	On the seventh day of the month he caused a solemn mass to be celebrated on the shore : during the service an old cacique arrived , who , the ceremony being over , offered the admiral some fruits , and then this native sovereign pronounced some words which the interpreters thus translated : -- `` It hath been told us after what manner thou hast invested and enveloped with thy power these lands , which were to you unknown , and how thy presence has caused great terror to the people and the inhabitants .
__label__1	This old man wears a hat , a thumbed and napless and yet an obdurate hat , which has never adapted itself to the shape of his poor head .
__label__1	How much ? ’ He turned upon her suddenly with a menacing gesture of the weighted hand that clenched the money , as if he were going to strike her with it .
__label__1	Though to bless and restore his mother , not his father , was the errand of this baby , its power was mighty to do it .
__label__0	Of these two men , the one was <NAME> , the other <NAME> ; both were tall and thin , but the latter was sallow as are the southern Provencals , while the former was ruddy like a <NAME> gentleman .
__label__1	It made her very sad to know that this was so -- so sad to see it that sometimes when he sat idly by , smiling and nodding to her when she looked round , or when he caressed some little child and carried it to and fro , as he was fond of doing by the hour together , perplexed by its simple questions , yet patient under his own infirmity , and seeming almost conscious of it too , and humbled even before the mind of an infant -- so sad it made her to see him thus , that she would burst into tears , and , withdrawing into some secret place , fall down upon her knees and pray that he might be restored .
__label__0	In the depths of the forests , moreover , the conquerors of the islands had created artificial glades , in order that the herds of horned cattle which they had introduced might find food and also enjoy shelter from the sun .
__label__0	One was the blacksmith of <NAME> .
__label__1	While we waited at the gate , I peeped in ( even then <NAME> said , “ And fourteen ? ” but I pretended not to hear him ) , and saw that at the side of the house there was a large brewery .
__label__0	“ What do you ask ? ” replied <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> , who had so long sat looking at the ceiling of the court , changed neither his place nor his attitude , even in this excitement .
__label__1	To all this , the single gentleman listened with the air of a man quite borne down by grief and disappointment .
__label__1	I was proud of his interest : deeply , fondly , gratefully attached to him .
__label__0	The preparations for our departure did not take long , and we were soon making a rapid descent into the tunnel .
__label__1	The bell was ringing , and the <NAME> was a Serpent of many coils , and the <NAME> was getting ready .
__label__0	This was the signal for renewed cries of still greater intensity .
__label__1	‘ And now , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , consulting a large double-faced silver watch that hung at the end of the copper chain .
__label__0	`` But once more on dry ground , we shall know what to do .
__label__1	As to all the rest—What will be , will be .
__label__1	Pulling at the bell again and getting no reply , she pushed the outer door , and found it standing ajar .
__label__1	I ha ’ dun ’ t not once , not twice—twenty time ! ’ Every line in his face deepened as he said it , and put in its affecting evidence of the suffering he had undergone .
__label__0	It will be remembered that the brig turned bottom upwards , and that <NAME> and <NAME> remained for several days crouching on its keel .
__label__0	This meadow was to be surrounded by a palisade , high enough to prevent even the most agile animals from leaping over .
__label__0	`` The huts of these islanders , who call themselves Orotchys , '' says the narrative , `` are surrounded by a drying ground for salmon , which were exposed to the sun upon perches , after having been smoked for three or four days at the stove which is in the centre of the hut .
__label__0	The vessels were soon surrounded by pirogues , but not a single native ventured to go on board , they were so fully persuaded that the <NAME> had come to avenge their murdered comrades .
__label__0	Exactly two hundred feet behind the angle formed by the river , the wall , terminated by a fall of rocks , died away in a gentle slope to the edge of the forest .
__label__1	`` Oh , yes , you tell me so , '' returns <NAME> .
__label__0	By what geological phenomena could this blazing coma have been possibly produced ?
__label__0	The government was in the hands of three chiefs , called <NAME> , who had shared all authority between them since the banishment of the <NAME> , or spiritual chief , who had enjoyed immense influence .
__label__1	<NAME> , <NAME> , entered it in a little book , with a gold pencil-case , and the other gentleman entered it also , in another little book with another gold pencil-case .
__label__1	He had been clearing his head with a lotion of cold water , as a good preparative to providing hot water for the heads of the jury , and had been reading with the neck of his shirt thrown wide open that he might the more freely choke the opposite witnesses .
__label__0	They returned along the north coast of <NAME> , and passed through the <NAME> , between <NAME> and <NAME> .
__label__0	The houses , badly built of flints and bricks cemented with mud , never last longer than about fifteen years . ''
__label__1	I am not very old , you may say .
__label__0	It rises in the southwest , and measures nearly five thousand feet across at its junction with the main river .
__label__0	Every kind of provision may be obtained here , particularly the best kinds of garden stuffs , and in two or three days a ship may be provided with everything . ''
__label__1	Before we had taken many paces down the street beyond it , the noise of the city seemed to melt , as if by magic , into a softened distance .
__label__0	The stakes , sharpened at their upper end and hardened by fire , had been fixed by means of cross-bars , and at regular distances props assured the solidity of the whole .
__label__0	Then <NAME> 's lamentable howling redoubled ; the poor animal called for the captain with his sad wails among the rocks .
__label__0	By watching their preparations <NAME> found to his joy that the detachment were not thinking of visiting the copse , but only bivouacking near , to rest their horses and allow the men to take some refreshment .
__label__0	“ You are very welcome , ” said <NAME> , bowing to the count with a smile of condescension .
__label__0	Why , madam , the Indians are not anthropophagi !
__label__1	‘ But she is quite safe. ’ ‘ Ha ! ’ cried <NAME> , twitching a pinch of snuff out of her box , as spitefully as if she were in the very act of wrenching off the small servant ’ s nose ; ‘ she shall be safe enough from this time , I warrant you. ’ ‘ I hope so , ’ replied the Notary .
__label__1	<NAME> vapouring , combined with the extravagant plots of <NAME> for the restoration of a state of things that had utterly exhausted itself , and worn out Heaven and earth as well as itself , was hard to be endured without some remonstrance by any sane man who knew the truth .
__label__1	I come here , and your wife is not here .
__label__0	And , above all , what must he have thought when <NAME> , drawing from the pocket of his dress a bag of pearls , placed it in his hand !
__label__1	Then she asked : ‘ Did your father know so much himself , that he wished you to be well taught too , <NAME> ? ’ <NAME> hesitated before replying , and so plainly showed her sense that they were entering on forbidden ground , that <NAME> added , ‘ No one hears us ; and if any one did , I am sure no harm could be found in such an innocent question. ’ ‘ No , <NAME> , ’ answered <NAME> , upon this encouragement , shaking her head ; ‘ father knows very little indeed .
__label__1	‘ The fence between this wharf and the next is easily climbed , ’ said the dwarf , when he had taken these precautions .
__label__1	'Let me say a prayer .
__label__1	Then she would flit along the yard , climb the scores of stairs that led to her room , and take her seat at the window .
__label__0	Where can I hide in this steppe ? ” He gave a look around , and , through the darkness , discovered a confused mass at a hundred paces before him on the left of the road .
__label__0	But all these appliances had been carried away , after the cessation of the works .
__label__1	<NAME> felt a little vague trepidation as to the subject-matter of this same consultation , until Mrs <NAME> announced it .
__label__1	Before the door , were three tall poplar trees , which made it very dark within ; and the wind moaned through them with a dismal wail .
__label__1	‘ There ’ s perils and dangers on the deep , my beauty , ’ said the <NAME> ; ‘ and over many a brave ship , and many and many a bould heart , the secret waters has closed up , and never told no tales .
__label__0	Seventeen degrees above the <NAME> Circle a broad red line around the eighty-fourth parallel marked off the portion of the globe which the <NAME> Practical Association had brought to the hammer .
__label__0	By a sad association of ideas , he referred everything to his monomania , and a human existence seemed to have departed from him , to give place to the extra-natural existence of the intermediate powers .
__label__1	In reply to the last interrogation , the small servant , with a look of infinite cunning mingled with fear , screwed up her mouth very tight and round , and nodded violently .
__label__0	I looked at my companions ; they were armed like us , and , more than that , <NAME> was brandishing an enormous harpoon , which he had placed in the boat before leaving the <NAME> .
__label__1	He looks to you , sir. ’ ‘ I do my best , <NAME> , ’ returned <NAME> , uneasily .
__label__0	Our fate appears certain , fearful and terrible .
__label__0	`` I 'll wager another cent that our bold savants calculated the heat of the Sun himself , '' cried <NAME> , with an incredulous laugh .
__label__0	Every morning the men were ordered to air their berths , and carefully clean the interior walls , to get rid of the night 's dampness .
__label__1	‘ Pretty well ! ’ echoed <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> were able to come on deck at daybreak , where they found <NAME> , <NAME> and the captain .
__label__1	For I own it seems to me , my dear <NAME> , ’ said Mrs. Micawber , who always fell back on me , I suppose from old habit , to whomsoever else she might address her discourse at starting , ‘ that the time is come when the past should be buried in oblivion ; when my family should take <NAME> by the hand , and <NAME> should take my family by the hand ; when the lion should lie down with the lamb , and my family be on terms with <NAME> Micawber. ’ I said I thought so too .
__label__0	The question , though a very natural one , now appeared to have presented itself to their consideration absolutely for the first time .
__label__0	`` Now , <NAME> , what do you miss now ? ''
__label__1	‘ The truth is , <NAME> , my life , ’ I said ; ‘ I have been trying to be wise. ’ ‘ And to make me wise too , ’ said <NAME> , timidly .
__label__1	Whether from too much east wind or no -- it was an easterly corner -- the stall , the stock , and the keeper , were all as dry as the Desert .
__label__0	cried M'Nicholl catching fire at the sight .
__label__0	In their excited state they would not have hesitated to do it .
__label__1	‘ But I am made , ’ said <NAME> to Mr Chick , ‘ of no more account than <NAME> !
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> 's intention was to take the <NAME> for his point of departure towards the south , after having made acquaintance with <NAME> , distant eight hundred miles from the <NAME> .
__label__0	Equally in its strife with the <NAME> as in its dealing with the natives , the <NAME> pursued a very skilful policy of moderation .
__label__0	Here a sad piece of news was awaiting him .
__label__1	Neither his brief consideration , nor its purport , was lost on his companion .
__label__1	Resisting all entreaties to stay till he came back , and finding it quite impossible to engage <NAME> in any intelligible conversation on the subject nearest his heart , or indeed on any other , <NAME> took his departure , and returned to the Bush .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> was in great force , and looked astonishingly young .
__label__1	‘ Well , ’ returned Mr Boffin , ‘ if I am , that ’ s my business .
__label__1	She spoke coarsely , but with no naturally coarse voice ; there was even something musical in its sound .
__label__0	The Government of <NAME> was monarchical ; at first the imperial power had been carefully limited , but it had increased with the various conquests , and had become despotic .
__label__0	That is , it has undergone less change .
__label__0	It seems , then , that if projectiles have gained in range , they have lost far more in weight .
__label__0	At all events , I was able to speak .
__label__0	`` But I do not understand . ''
__label__1	You were a cannonier that day there , and you were among the first to enter the accursed fortress when it fell .
__label__1	‘ Anybody who didn ’ t know you as well as I do , my dear fellow , would say you were an accomplished courtier , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	I shall come to no harm .
__label__0	On the 27th September was sighted part of the coast of <NAME> , ending in abrupt and precipitous cliffs , to which the name of <NAME> Chatham was given .
__label__1	After a preliminary raising of his spirits with the information that she considered the patient decidedly worse , she would further cheer him up by relating how dull , listless , and low-spirited <NAME> was , because <NAME> foolishly talked about nothing else but him and family matters .
__label__0	When in his turn he passed before his mother , <NAME> shut her eyes that she might not see him .
__label__1	Here ’ s a young lady as wants to take that opinion , in regard of my friend <NAME> ’ r ; likewise my t ’ other friend , <NAME> , which is a character for you to come within hail of , being a man of science , which is the mother of invention , and knows no law .
__label__0	437 <NAME> ENGAGING A <NAME> '' .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> , I hope I see you well , and -- if I may umbly express myself so -- friendly towards them as is ever your friends , whether or not .
__label__1	As to who was to blame for it , Mr Plornish didn ’ t know who was to blame for it .
__label__0	`` But we must have a mill . ''
__label__1	And when <NAME> regularly answered , ‘ No , <NAME> , nothing of the sort , ’ the trembling of <NAME> ’ s lip would be repeated in <NAME> ’ s face , and her eyes would follow <NAME> with compassion to the door .
__label__0	The Niger here , in its widest part , is not more than a stone's-throw across at present .
__label__0	The only sentiment of love felt by <NAME> was that which he entertained for his mother , the aged <NAME> , who could never be induced to leave the house of the <NAME> , at <NAME> , on the banks of the <NAME> , where the old huntsman and she had lived so long together .
__label__1	“ I say a horse at a canter coming up , Joe. ” “ _I_ say a horse at a gallop , <NAME> , ” returned the guard , leaving his hold of the door , and mounting nimbly to his place .
__label__0	It was lucky I had taken double allowance that day .
__label__1	It is growing late , and I have to reach home without suspicion of having been on such an errand as this .
__label__1	‘ Here , <NAME> , show the gentleman in to <NAME> Lowten. ’ ‘ The gen ’ l ’ m ’ n can ’ t go in just now , ’ said a shambling pot-boy , with a red head , ‘ cos ’ <NAME> ’ s a-singin ’ a comic song , and he ’ ll put him out .
__label__1	For I knew , now , that my own heart was undisciplined when it first loved <NAME> ; and that if it had been disciplined , it never could have felt , when we were married , what it had felt in its secret experience .
__label__1	What would be the consequence ?
__label__1	If you let your hand tremble so , we can never get away from them , but if you ’ re only quiet now , we shall do so , easily. ’ ‘ How ? ’ muttered the old man .
__label__1	Come across with me. ’ She laid her hand upon his arm , and he took her over the way ; the crowd , rather injured by the near prospect of losing her , pressing before and behind and on either side , and recommending an adjournment to <NAME> .
__label__1	Perhaps you wished to speak to me , sir. ’ ‘ No , sir , I didn ’ t do that , either. ’ ‘ Perhaps you may have nothing to say to me now , sir , ’ said Mr Cheggs fiercely .
__label__0	What , then , can you expect the fate of our companion to be ?
__label__1	‘ You wouldn ’ t mind my asking if it happened to be a job as you was come about , sir , would you ? ’ asked <NAME> wistfully .
__label__0	At once accepted by the <NAME> , <NAME> hastened his preparations , and left <NAME> upon the 22nd of May , 1795 .
__label__1	The <NAME> , more blue-faced and staring -- more over-ripe , as it were , than ever -- and giving vent , every now and then , to one of the horse ’ s coughs , not so much of necessity as in a spontaneous explosion of importance , walked arm-in-arm with Mr Dombey up the sunny side of the way , with his cheeks swelling over his tight stock , his legs majestically wide apart , and his great head wagging from side to side , as if he were remonstrating within himself for being such a captivating object .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> de <NAME> , called by <NAME> , is about the centre of the eastern coast of <NAME> .
__label__1	`` If I went into <NAME> 's office , '' said <NAME> , `` and if I were placed under articles to <NAME> , I should have my eye on the -- hum ! -- the forbidden ground -- and should be able to study it , and master it , and to satisfy myself that it was not neglected and was being properly conducted .
__label__1	But , then twisting himself suddenly round upon him , he found his look unchanged .
__label__1	On the brow of <NAME> , <NAME> and his brother <NAME> had set some marks , as on a tree that was to come down in good time -- remorseless twins they are for striding through their human forests , notching as they go -- while the countenance of <NAME> was crossed with a thousand little creases , which the same deceitful Time would take delight in smoothing out and wearing away with the flat part of his scythe , as a preparation of the surface for his deeper operations .
__label__1	When all was still , at a late hour , poor crazed <NAME> came weeping to me and told me she had given her birds their liberty .
__label__1	‘ I can not , therefore , put a price upon services which it is a pleasure to me to render if I can render them spontaneously , but which I could not render in mere return for any consideration .
__label__1	Matters having reached this point , Mr <NAME> explained , and the virtuous feelings of his son being thereby calmed , they shook hands , and harmony reigned again .
__label__1	How <NAME> went on , from day to day , filling the mind of his adopted child with stores of knowledge , and becoming attached to him , more and more , as his nature developed itself , and showed the thriving seeds of all he wished him to become -- how he traced in him new traits of his early friend , that awakened in his own bosom old remembrances , melancholy and yet sweet and soothing -- how the two orphans , tried by adversity , remembered its lessons in mercy to others , and mutual love , and fervent thanks to Him who had protected and preserved them -- these are all matters which need not to be told .
__label__0	How can anyone , moreover , help obeying , unhesitatingly , orders which emanate from a monarch who has the right to employ this formula at the head of his ukase : “ We , by the grace of <NAME> , <NAME> and Autocrat of all the <NAME> of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , <NAME> of <NAME> and <NAME> , <NAME> of <NAME> , <NAME> of <NAME> , <NAME> of the <NAME> , <NAME> of <NAME> , <NAME> of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , <NAME> of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and of <NAME> , of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and many other countries ; <NAME> and <NAME> of the territory of Nijni-Novgorod , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and of <NAME> , Governor of the <NAME> , <NAME> of the countries of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , <NAME> and <NAME> of the <NAME> princes , of those of the mountains , and of others ; heir of <NAME> , <NAME> of Schleswig-Holstein , <NAME> , <NAME> , and Oldenburg. ” A powerful lord , in truth , is he whose arms are an eagle with two heads , holding a scepter and a globe , surrounded by the escutcheons of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and of <NAME> , and environed by the collar of the order of <NAME> , surmounted by a royal crown !
__label__1	Whether it was the following Sunday when I saw the gentleman again , or whether there was any greater lapse of time before he reappeared , I can not recall .
__label__1	<NAME> ! ’ exclaimed <NAME> , lost in astonishment , ‘ what is the meaning of this , <NAME> ?
__label__1	<NAME> peculiarities were easily to be detected by experienced eyes in Mr Doyce ’ s way of managing his affairs , but they almost always involved some ingenious simplification of a difficulty , and some plain road to the desired end .
__label__1	<NAME> ’ t frown , <NAME> , don ’ t frown ; I say , between you and I , _we_ know it .
__label__1	I was not angry with them ; I was more afraid of them , as if I were cast away among creatures with whom I had no community of nature .
__label__0	`` Extraordinarily vivid coruscations of aurora australis ( were seen ) , at times rolling , '' says <NAME> , `` as it were , over our heads in the form of beautiful columns , then as suddenly changing like the fringe of a curtain , and again shooting across the hemisphere like a serpent ; frequently appearing not many yards above our heads , and decidedly within our atmosphere . ''
__label__1	I ’ ll give him a shilling , presently .
__label__0	I cried ; `` what wood is it ? ''
__label__1	<NAME> didn ’ t know : already having everything she wanted , she couldn ’ t say .
__label__1	He darted onward -- straight , headlong -- dashing through brier and brake , and leaping gate and fence as madly as his dog , who careered with loud and sounding bark before him .
__label__1	Mr <NAME> , I drink yours .
__label__0	`` My friend , '' said <NAME> in a firmer voice , `` look at me , I wish it ! ''
__label__1	Go on ! ” “ I am again at work upon the hill-side , and the sun is again about to go to bed .
__label__1	So I thought one day when I went to <NAME> to meet <NAME> , at her solicitation , I would ask <NAME> to be in waiting for me at the coach-office , that we might have a little talk together .
__label__1	Mr Toots , like the leal and trusty soul he was , stopped the cabriolet in a twinkling , and told <NAME> of his commission , at which she cried more than before .
__label__0	The eastern horizon was gradually assuming a most stormy aspect .
__label__1	‘ An ancient flame , <NAME> , ’ chuckled <NAME> .
__label__1	Whether it was possible in a <NAME> country to get on without blood , after this , was a question on which the Finches were divided .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> ! ’ cried <NAME> , ‘ where is that fellow , <NAME> ? ’ But not a word said <NAME> .
__label__0	“ The writing is in a safe place , ” replied <NAME> , “ and you will not have it until your daughter has become my wife .
__label__0	The land of the <NAME> , opposite this rock , is steep , and covered with large trees . ''
__label__0	She bowed her head , and was silent .
__label__1	My thoughts , when they were wildest , never rose near the happiness that I have known with you , and that we have before us. ” He embraced her , solemnly commended her to <NAME> , and humbly thanked <NAME> for having bestowed her on him .
__label__0	Perhaps the balloon will rise .
__label__0	No progress can be accomplished without detriment to the indigenous races .
__label__1	<NAME> care of your chest and voice , my good friend , and leave the law to take care of itself .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> salutes the gentleman but otherwise sits bolt upright and profoundly silent -- very forward in his chair , as if the full complement of regulation appendages for a field-day hung about him .
__label__1	Oh , my friends and fellow-countrymen , the slaves of an iron-handed and a grinding despotism !
__label__0	<NAME> , as may be believed , was all eagerness to carry out his new enterprise , and would not leave his work for an instant .
__label__0	During the morning of the 16th April , the balloon was placed in safety in the middle of a clearing in the great woods , with which the soil is studded .
__label__1	The houses have no owners ; they are broken open , and entered upon by those who have the courage ; and there they live , and there they die .
__label__0	`` The natives of the country , '' says <NAME> , `` came forward willingly .
__label__0	This was accompanied by successive explosions , resembling the discharge of a battery of mitrailleuses .
__label__0	<NAME> then took her in his strong arms and , having no longer to think of her fatigue , walked more rapidly and with his indefatigable step .
__label__1	‘ Our judgments -- I am supposing a general case -- ’ ‘ Of course , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	The daughters , who appeared to be very fond of him , were amused by this droll fact , particularly the <NAME> daughter .
__label__1	She busied herself immediately in preparing supper , and while she was thus engaged I remarked that the old man took an opportunity of observing me more closely than he had done yet .
__label__0	`` Do you know , my dear uncle , '' I said , as we walked along , `` that we have been singularly helped by a concurrence of circumstances , right up to this very moment . ''
__label__1	An Appearance in the <NAME> 29 .
__label__0	About three in the afternoon the prince passed sentence upon those who had been convicted .
__label__0	To a fresh demand for <NAME> 's papers and journals the sultan replied that he had none of them ; they were in the hands of some learned men ; but as <NAME> seemed to set such store by them , he would have them looked for .
__label__0	The engineer ’ s curiosity was excited to the highest pitch .
__label__1	The strange gentleman beckoned him out of his place , and <NAME> went .
__label__1	`` Liz , you 're tired and ill. Let me take him . ''
__label__1	‘ When did I first begin ? ’ he rejoined , passing his hand across his brow .
__label__1	<NAME> at the bees. ’ ‘ I beg your pardon , ’ returned <NAME> , with a reluctant smile , ‘ but will you excuse my mentioning that I always protest against being referred to the bees ? ’ ‘ Do you ! ’ said Mr Boffin .
__label__0	He placed himself at the head of eighty horse-soldiers and 120 infantry , defeated on several occasions <NAME> , who disputed his passage , and thanks to his prudence and cleverness , he entered <NAME> victorious ; but he did not find there what he sought , that is to say , the treasures of <NAME> .
__label__1	Love at first sight is a trite expression quite sufficiently discussed ; enough that in certain smouldering natures like this man ’ s , that passion leaps into a blaze , and makes such head as fire does in a rage of wind , when other passions , but for its mastery , could be held in chains .
__label__1	I shall leave this at five o ’ clock , and ride there on horseback .
__label__1	I shall sink lower , and be worse. ” He leaned an elbow on her table , and covered his eyes with his hand .
__label__0	<NAME> and <NAME> conformed strictly with the recommendation about the health of the crew ; they all looked hardy and possessed enough animal heat to run the engines of the <NAME> ; their elastic limbs , their clear and ruddy skin , showed that they were fit to encounter intense cold .
__label__1	In all sorts of recesses , and on all kinds of brackets , stood massive old silver candlesticks with four branches each .
__label__0	In the afternoon we sighted masses , islets they might be called , of ice , drifting slowly southward , but these were not yet of considerable extent or altitude .
__label__1	I know their tricks and their manners. ’ She said this with an angry little shake of her tight fist close before her eyes .
__label__1	‘ Perhaps a little damp and ague-ish ? ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	But it ’ s so easy to hope not and think not , without the riches. ’ ‘ Why don ’ t you say , my darling -- instead of that phrase -- being poor ? ’ he asked , looking earnestly at her .
__label__0	<NAME> 's was therefore an important rectification .
__label__0	and 26 degrees and 27 degrees east of the meridian of <NAME> , or between 5 degrees 30 minutes and 6 degrees 3 minutes east of that of <NAME> . ''
__label__1	When is the day ? ’ ‘ The day after to-morrow. ’ ‘ Write round in the morning , and say that I have returned , and shall -- hum -- be delighted. ’ ‘ May I walk with you up the stairs to your room , dear ? ’ ‘ No ! ’ he answered , looking angrily round ; for he was moving away , as if forgetful of leave-taking .
__label__1	<NAME> was the substance of <NAME> ’ s discoveries concerning him , made that rainy Sunday afternoon and afterwards .
__label__1	Softened regrets they might be , teaching me what I had failed to learn when my younger life was all before me , but not the less regrets .
__label__1	Above the <NAME> was Mrs Gowan ’ s residence .
__label__1	This was merely intended as a tribute to the animal 's abilities , but it was an appropriate remark in another sense , if <NAME> had only known it ; for there are a good many ladies and gentlemen , claiming to be out-and-out Christians , between whom , and <NAME> ' dog , there exist strong and singular points of resemblance .
__label__1	<NAME> '' -- <NAME> becomes mysteriously and tenderly eloquent -- '' it is necessary that I should impress upon your mind once more that circumstances over which I have no control have made a melancholy alteration in my most cherished plans and in that unrequited image which I formerly mentioned to you as a friend .
__label__0	This terrible discussion , though they had the same idea , had produced internal spasms , and every one knows that paleness shows that anger has reached its last limits .
__label__1	The gentleman next door had been vilified by <NAME> ; rudely stigmatised as a dotard and an idiot ; and for these attacks upon his understanding , Mrs. <NAME> was , in some sort , accountable .
__label__1	It had only been , as I thought , of less assistance than the horses in getting us on , and it had often aided them .
__label__1	‘ Have you a good memory ? ’ ‘ I don ’ t know , ’ said <NAME> , shaking his head sorrowfully .
__label__1	Stop him ! ” The cattle came upon me with like suddenness , staring out of their eyes , and steaming out of their nostrils , “ Halloa , young thief ! ” One black ox , with a white cravat on , -- who even had to my awakened conscience something of a clerical air , -- fixed me so obstinately with his eyes , and moved his blunt head round in such an accusatory manner as I moved round , that I blubbered out to him , “ I could n't help it , sir !
__label__0	They were not long in coming upon a _moraï_ , similar in every respect to the <NAME> _moraïs_ .
__label__0	I shuddered as I evolved from my mind the idea and recollection of these awful monsters .
__label__0	Occasionally they wore necklaces and bracelets made of bits of wood or shells .
__label__1	‘ It may seem wery strange talkin ’ to me about these here affairs , miss , ’ said <NAME> , with great vehemence ; ‘ but all I can say is , that I ’ m not only ready but villin ’ to do anythin ’ as ’ ll make matters agreeable ; and if chuckin ’ either o ’ them sawboneses out o ’ winder ‘ ull do it , I ’ m the man. ’ As <NAME> said this , he tucked up his wristbands , at the imminent hazard of falling off the wall in so doing , to intimate his readiness to set to work immediately .
__label__1	He was about two or three and fifty , and a trifle below the middle size ; he wore a white neckerchief with long ends , and a suit of scholastic black ; but his coat sleeves being a great deal too long , and his trousers a great deal too short , he appeared ill at ease in his clothes , and as if he were in a perpetual state of astonishment at finding himself so respectable .
__label__1	‘ “ Oh ! ” said the unhappy <NAME> , clasping his hands , and mournfully raising his eyes towards the sky , “ would that my wanderings might end here !
__label__0	All the sails were up , and the jib was so arranged as not to screen the brigantine .
__label__1	This gentleman , becoming transfixed at the same moment as his lady-mother , could not by any means unfix himself again , but stood stiffly staring at the whole composition with <NAME> in the <NAME> .
__label__0	Accordingly , under cover of the night , the broadsides of the vessels were brought to bear upon the town , which was bombarded for the space of three days .
__label__0	After having wintered at <NAME> , <NAME> landed three ambassadors at <NAME> , who were to reach <NAME> by travelling overland , then he anchored at <NAME> , which <NAME> , one of his lieutenants had been unable to subjugate .
__label__0	This was in 1861 , and for twelve months , or up to May , 1862 , letters were regularly received from him , but no tidings whatever had come since his departure from <NAME> , in June , and the name of the <NAME> never appeared in the <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> also turned his stay at <NAME> to account by laying the foundation-stone of a monument to the memory of <NAME> .
__label__1	The reversal of the two natures , in their relative positions , <NAME> ’ s of power and <NAME> ’ s of dependence , was a sight more painful to me than I can express .
__label__1	The horror-stricken witness of this scene pressed his hands upon his ears , and with his eyes closed got up and paced violently to and fro , like one distracted .
__label__0	Never would they abandon this colony , founded with so much labor and with such success , and to which a communication with <NAME> would afford a fresh impetus .
__label__1	These two brothers had been brought up together in a school at <NAME> ; and , being accustomed to go home once a week , had often heard , from their mother ’ s lips , long accounts of their father ’ s sufferings in his days of poverty , and of their deceased uncle ’ s importance in his days of affluence : which recitals produced a very different impression on the two : for , while the younger , who was of a timid and retiring disposition , gleaned from thence nothing but forewarnings to shun the great world and attach himself to the quiet routine of a country life , <NAME> , the elder , deduced from the often-repeated tale the two great morals that riches are the only true source of happiness and power , and that it is lawful and just to compass their acquisition by all means short of felony .
__label__1	‘ Oh , how-de-do , Mr Gills ? ’ The salutation was addressed to the <NAME> , now emerging from the back parlour with a most transparent and utterly futile affectation of coming out by accidence .
__label__1	His soul is a great deal too large for his frame .
__label__0	They certainly did not deserve death for refusing to trust to my promises , and to come on board , even if they suspected no danger ; but my commission by its nature obliged me to take observations of their country , and I could only do so by penetrating into the interior , either by open force or by gaining the confidence and good will of the natives .
__label__0	Before leaving the capital of <NAME> , the <NAME> commander entered into various details of the beauty of the port , and the picturesque nature of its surroundings , and finished by a very curious digression upon the prodigious riches of the country , of which the port was the emporium .
__label__1	It is said , at any rate .
__label__1	A very well conducted family indeed , the Chiveries .
__label__1	As his mind was teeming with these thoughts , the encounter took him altogether unprepared , so that the other passenger had had time to say , boisterously , ‘ <NAME> !
__label__0	`` Be quite at rest on that point ; there is no danger of their breaking through .
__label__1	‘ Why this is indeed a joy I had not looked for ! ’ said Mrs. Crummles , when <NAME> was presented .
__label__1	Say what it is , only say what it is. ’ ‘ My dearest <NAME> , nothing .
__label__0	The whole question was almost forgotten , when the discoveries made quite recently by <NAME> reopened the discussion .
__label__1	One other singularity was that nobody with a mission -- except <NAME> , whose mission , as I think I have formerly said , was to be in ecstasies with everybody 's mission -- cared at all for anybody 's mission .
__label__1	Now , the man who did the sexton ’ s duty was a little older than he , though much more active .
__label__0	Strangely enough , the temperature was very high -- ten degrees above zero .
__label__0	He then thanked his companions , and added , that he would rely on their energy and on the aid of <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Of course , my dear <NAME> ; of course .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> me what you mean. ’ ‘ Why , they say , ’ replied the boy , looking up into her face , that you will be an <NAME> , before the birds sing again .
__label__1	‘ But whether it is all true , or partly true , or entirely false , I am wholly unable to say .
__label__1	In good time Mr <NAME> ’ s mansion was gained again , and again there was a noise of tongues in the library .
__label__0	They had not to wait long for the same night the hurricane had ceased entirely , and there was only a manageable breeze from the S. W. Preparations for sailing were instantly commenced , and at four o ’ clock in the morning the crew lifted the anchors , and got under way with fresh canvas outspread , and a wind blowing right for the <NAME> shores .
__label__1	No such artificial means would bring sleep to his eyes .
__label__1	‘ “ I ’ ll astonish you , ” said <NAME> , putting his hand in his pocket .
__label__0	At <NAME> ’ s request , she had cheerfully consented to put several hundreds of thousands of dollars at the disposal of the <NAME> Practical Association , without even knowing what it was all about .
__label__1	The tail of <NAME> 's eye becomes conscious of the head of Mrs. Snagsby looking in at the shop-door to know what he means by deserting his tea .
__label__0	The hurricane seemed to have respected this part of the Polar Ocean .
__label__0	This explains why the islands discovered by the <NAME> -- <NAME> , <NAME> , & c. -- are much too near the <NAME> coast , and also the non-existence of the group called by the <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , which there is every reason to suppose was none other than the <NAME> archipelago , as <NAME> in <NAME> means `` table , '' and <NAME> compares the mountain called <NAME> to a plateau or table-land .
__label__1	Mr <NAME> was one of the very few marriageable men for whom <NAME> had no terrors , the argument with which he reassured himself being twofold ; that is to say , firstly , ‘ that it wouldn ’ t do twice , ’ and secondly , ‘ that he wasn ’ t worth it. ’ Fortified within this double armour , Mr <NAME> snorted at <NAME> on easy terms .
__label__1	‘ Will you hold your tongue -- female ? ’ said <NAME> , plunging violently into this dialogue .
__label__0	The crew seemed to have returned to their habits of discipline and obedience .
__label__0	Above us the crater seemed to gape like the mouth of a well .
__label__0	He will make us a bridge when we want one .
__label__0	In less than twenty minutes , the <NAME> , carried along by the torrent , had passed through the <NAME> of <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> , first seen by <NAME> on his second voyage , had never yet been explored by any expedition , and on the arrival of the _Astrolabe_ a number of canoes , containing some score of natives , most of them chiefs , approached .
__label__1	Similarly , he dealt us clean plates and knives and forks , for each course , and dropped those just disused into two baskets on the ground by his chair .
__label__1	All I had to do , I said , with gloomy sarcasm , was to forget <NAME> .
__label__0	`` At any rate , '' remarked <NAME> , `` it is well understood that if we do leave <NAME> in some way or another , it will not be because we were uncomfortable there ! ''
__label__0	The <NAME> flew toward it , and at length were not more than two hundred paces away .
__label__1	‘ The <NAME> was very good to me .
__label__0	But habit was too strong for him !
__label__0	<NAME> said that he resembled <NAME> -- at least that his head was <NAME> ; but he was a bearded , tranquil <NAME> , who might live on a thousand years without growing old .
__label__1	‘ It mustn ’ t be , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	As the trooper speaks , he conducts them to the other end of the gallery and opens one of the little cabins .
__label__0	But I thought it best not to urge this argument .
__label__1	‘ This is what boys and girls call disinterested affection , till they have boys and girls of their own , and then they see it in a rougher and very different light ! ’ <NAME> ’ s tears flowed fast , as she pleaded in extenuation that she was young and inexperienced ; that her attachment had alone induced her to take the step to which she had resorted ; and that she had been deprived of the counsel and guidance of her parents almost from infancy .
__label__0	Forster , animated by an ardour for botanical research , missed none of them .
__label__1	‘ Say what you have to say ; it ’ s the old story , I suppose ? ’ ‘ With a difference , my dear <NAME> ; with a difference , ’ rejoined <NAME> , deliberately folding up the paper and putting it into his pocket again .
__label__1	`` Then , cousin <NAME> -- '' <NAME> laughingly began again .
__label__1	‘ Except that it is a fire , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ it looks to me as stupid and blank as everything else looks .
__label__1	He has not a large business , but he is a very respectable man .
__label__0	To effect that object it will be enough to establish a telescope on some elevated mountain .
__label__1	‘ Dear Nicholas , ’ whispered <NAME> , who had been looking anxiously over his shoulder , ‘ can this be really the case ?
__label__1	We loitered down to the <NAME> stairs , and stood loitering there , as if we were not quite decided to go upon the water at all .
__label__1	A great wind rises , and the summer is gone in a moment .
__label__0	“ You see , <NAME> , ” said <NAME> , “ the convicts got as far as here !
__label__1	Everybody present , except the one wigged gentleman who looked at the ceiling , stared at him .
__label__0	But he had not enjoyed one moment of repose .
__label__1	‘ I think , <NAME> , ’ the cherub hinted at last , ‘ that if you can spare me the young person distantly related to myself , I ’ ll take her in. ’ ‘ I can ’ t spare her , ’ answered <NAME> , ‘ but I must lend her to you. -- My Darling ! ’ A word of magic which caused <NAME> instantly to disappear again .
__label__0	Seventy-nine parts of azote and twenty-one of oxygen , carbonic acid and steam in a variable quantity .
__label__1	‘ Let me see you ride a donkey over my green again , and as sure as you have a head upon your shoulders , I ’ ll knock your bonnet off , and tread upon it ! ’ It would require a painter , and no common painter too , to depict my aunt ’ s face as she delivered herself of this very unexpected sentiment , and <NAME> ’ s face as she heard it .
__label__0	This has occurred in the two hemispheres -- at <NAME> , <NAME> , at <NAME> -- and on the eve of an eruption there is everything to be feared .
__label__1	‘ Oh Mr Clennam you insincerest of creatures , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ I perceive already you have not lost your old way of paying compliments , your old way when you used to pretend to be so sentimentally struck you know -- at least I don ’ t mean that , I -- oh I don ’ t know what I mean ! ’ Here <NAME> tittered confusedly , and gave him one of her old glances .
__label__1	‘ I heard from <NAME> , ’ said the Patriarch with his benevolent smile , ‘ that she was coming to call , coming to call .
__label__0	“ <NAME> , ” said <NAME> , taking the sailor ’ s arm , “ that is a wicked idea of yours , and you will distress me much if you persist in speaking thus .
__label__1	‘ Now , you are something like a genteel boy !
__label__0	The water would not return for several hours , and these hours must be employed in the most profitable way .
__label__0	On one of the cards was inscribed : <NAME> , <NAME> , Mostaganem._ On the other was the title : <NAME> , On board the <NAME> “ Dobryna. ” _ It did not take long to arrange that seconds should be appointed , who would meet in <NAME> at two o ’ clock that day ; and the captain and the count were on the point of parting from each other , with a salute of punctilious courtesy , when <NAME> , as if struck by a sudden thought , said abruptly : “ Perhaps it would be better , captain , not to allow the real cause of this to transpire ? ” “ Far better , ” replied <NAME> ; “ it is undesirable in every way for any names to be mentioned. ” “ In that case , however , ” continued the count , “ it will be necessary to assign an ostensible pretext of some kind .
__label__0	They applaud , call before the curtain , make loud acclamations !
__label__1	Why , he knows you have come home .
__label__1	This was the state of matters , on the afternoon of , what I may be excused for calling , that eventful and important Friday .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , sir , by a cask of sugar. ’ ‘ He is a good creature , ’ said <NAME> , with great earnestness .
__label__1	She is eminently calculated for a mother-in-law .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> made his appearance ; anger shone in his eyes , and with him was <NAME> , quite unmoved .
__label__0	Lights flitting to and fro in the <NAME> camp , showed that a considerable movement was taking place .
__label__0	Books : -- 1 Bible , 1 atlas , 1 dictionary of the different <NAME> idioms , 1 dictionary of natural science , in six volumes ; 3 reams of white paper , 2 books with blank pages .
__label__1	He had armed himself with an offensive weapon for the fatal night , and he had gone off early in the morning , after making preparations for departure .
__label__1	`` You will lose the disinterested part of your Don Quixote character , '' said <NAME> to <NAME> over her shoulder again , `` if you only redress the wrongs of beauty like this .
__label__1	'That 's the boy , is it ? '
__label__0	During the month of July the cold was intense , but there was no lack of either wood or coal .
__label__1	The ungainly piece of honesty beamed and blushed as he said it , quite enraptured with the remembrance of having been serviceable .
__label__1	I wish I could doubt the evidence of my senses , but their depositions are unimpeachable .
__label__1	‘ I ’ m not a child , to be taken notice of by strangers. ’ ‘ You ARE a child. ’ ‘ I ’ m not a child , and I won ’ t be taken notice of .
__label__0	The natives resembled those of <NAME> in every particular , and quickly surrounded the two frigates , offering the multifarious productions of their island .
__label__0	“ That is not surprising , ” answered the reporter .
__label__1	The stone on which he had first seen the goblin seated , stood bolt upright before him , and the grave at which he had worked , the night before , was not far off .
__label__1	In the meantime , Mrs. <NAME> kept unwinking watch and ward .
__label__0	As soon as the anchor , imbedded in the sandy bottom , had made good its hold , a boat was lowered .
__label__1	Refreshment -- a -- underneath this roof -- particularly punch -- would -- a -- choke me -- unless -- I had -- previously -- choked the eyes -- out of the head -- a -- of -- interminable cheat , and liar -- HEEP !
__label__1	And I do not doubt that this man -- whatever they call him , I forget his name -- is one of them. ’ The landlady ’ s lively speech was received with greater favour at the Break of Day , than it would have elicited from certain amiable whitewashers of the class she so unreasonably objected to , nearer <NAME> .
__label__1	Does he -- do they -- aunt ? ’ <NAME> shook her head compassionately .
__label__1	In whatever state she walked away , she certainly did not walk back again .
__label__0	In consequence , the attempts at finding a north-west passage were abandoned by the <NAME> for a somewhat long period .
__label__1	The time has flown. ’ ‘ You ’ re a brute ! ’ exclaimed <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> rushed towards the schooner , hoisted himself on board by means of a rope hanging over the bows , and gained the hatch which gives access to that part of the hold .
__label__1	‘ To be sure , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	I can remember , when I was a very little girl indeed , I used to say to my doll when we were alone together , `` Now , <NAME> , I am not clever , you know very well , and you must be patient with me , like a dear ! ''
__label__1	Now , <NAME> , I have done with stipulations. ” Though he called me <NAME> , and began rather to make up to me , he still could not get rid of a certain air of bullying suspicion ; and even now he occasionally shut his eyes and threw his finger at me while he spoke , as much as to express that he knew all kinds of things to my disparagement , if he only chose to mention them .
__label__0	When you look at any map of the <NAME> , you are struck first of all with one peculiarity .
__label__0	I had something else to think of .
__label__1	He would have been more and more sensible of what was wanting in his home .
__label__0	<NAME> indeed was now the joyful enthusiasm on both vessels .
__label__1	Before the weak-eyed young man performed on the gong next morning , he came upstairs to <NAME> and told him he was to lie still , which <NAME> very gladly did .
__label__0	Upon my word , this mountain is a paradise !
__label__0	The official who accompanied the escort had perished with the greater part of the soldiers , and suspicion could not point against him .
__label__1	Yes , I always say so , ’ Mrs. Gradgrind cried , with unexpected quickness .
__label__1	Accompanied by the lightest of porters , fit colourless servitor at <NAME> ’ s door when Mrs. Gradgrind knocked , <NAME> rumbled to <NAME> , over the coal-pits past and present , and was whirled into its smoky jaws .
__label__1	“ If it was ever intended that I should go across salt water , do you suppose Providence would have cast my lot in an island ? ” This being another question hard to answer , <NAME> withdrew to consider it .
__label__1	As <NAME> looked round on the kind faces , and saw among them those of <NAME> and his lady , and of Mr Toots , who was chuckling and staring at her from a distance , she was reminded of the night when <NAME> and she had come from <NAME> ’ s : and when the carriage drove away , her face was wet with tears .
__label__0	The captain imagined the island to be uninhabited , but to his very great surprise a canoe presently approached his ship manned by three young men of colour , who spoke <NAME> very well .
__label__0	They live upon monkeys , dogs , cats , rats , beef , and mutton .
__label__1	<NAME> up with the pleasure and joy of the occasion , are the many regrets at quitting home , the tears of parting between parent and child , the consciousness of leaving the dearest and kindest friends of the happiest portion of human life , to encounter its cares and troubles with others still untried and little known -- natural feelings which we would not render this chapter mournful by describing , and which we should be still more unwilling to be supposed to ridicule .
__label__1	His man drove as if he were charging an enemy , and the furious recklessness of the man brought no check into the face , or to the lips , of the master .
__label__1	I wish I was dead .
__label__0	From time to time , in certain places where the landing was easy , the canoe was stopped , when <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , their guns in their hands , and preceded by <NAME> , jumped on shore .
__label__0	The massive rocks were rent with impenetrable fractures , deep grottos , and unfathomable holes , at the bottom of which formidable creatures might be heard moving .
__label__1	Or take it this way , <NAME> , ’ he added , after a moment ’ s reflection ; ‘ Supposing that a man had to go through life , we won ’ t say with a companion , but we ’ ll say to a tune .
__label__0	Strings of amulets , made of shells or cut stones , hung from one part to another .
__label__1	with a flourish of the arm , and a flush of the face , they were swept away .
__label__1	Do not tell me that you wish I had lost this ; for it has softened my heart to all mankind . '
__label__1	‘ The message relates to family matters , ’ said <NAME> , hesitating .
__label__0	repeated <NAME> , who had seized <NAME> by the collar of his jersey .
__label__0	I say that for _you_ , <NAME> , because <NAME> will probably not understand . ''
__label__0	In fifteen days , and after a brush with the <NAME> , they reached <NAME> , having on their way taken measurements of every part of the temple of <NAME> , and determined , as <NAME> had done , its exact geographical position .
__label__0	The first piece of news that <NAME> d'Urville learnt on entering the river <NAME> , before even casting anchor at <NAME> , was that <NAME> , an Englishman , had received certain information , when at <NAME> , of the shipwreck of <NAME> at <NAME> ; and that he had brought away the hilt of a sword which he believed to have belonged to that navigator .
__label__0	“ What a brute , ” exclaimed <NAME> .
__label__0	She will perceive that her silence is no longer reasonable .
__label__1	I thought of you so anxiously , and it appeared so long to morning. ’ ‘ I have thought of you -- ’ he hesitated what to call her .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> wished to set out without delay ; but as the expedition would be of some days ' duration , it appeared best to load the cart with different materials and tools in order to facilitate the organisation of the encampments .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> might , by its very position , be considered impregnable ; therefore the corral with its buildings , its stores , and the animals it contained , would always be the object of pirates , whoever they were , who might land on the island , and should the colonists be obliged to shut themselves up there they ought also to be able to defend themselves without any disadvantage .
__label__1	`` You are , of course , the person who has written me so many letters ? ''
__label__1	‘ I am glad you are so well satisfied , sir , ’ was his calm remark .
__label__1	‘ Out of the question to marry her , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ and out of the question to leave her .
__label__0	In this cold atmosphere , to open the mouth was painful ; sharp crystals of ice suddenly formed between the lips , and the heat of the breath could not melt them .
__label__0	He sought to read hope in their eyes , but they did not venture to meet his gaze .
__label__0	When the bottles were empty , however , he rose to go and tell his master of the change in the time of the sailing of the <NAME> .
__label__1	How did you find me ?
__label__0	On the other side there is a small platform , four feet square , and furnished with a roof , under which they are accustomed to keep their provisions .
__label__1	To say of a man so severely and strictly self-repressed that he is triumphant would be to do him as great an injustice as to suppose him troubled with love or sentiment or any romantic weakness .
__label__1	‘ Not if it should happen to have been a tame bull , you little <NAME> ? ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , ass , traitor ! ’ ‘ Drat the man ! ’ cried the nurse , looking angrily around .
__label__0	After prostrating themselves , and offering various marks of repentance , the natives appeared anxious to commence friendly and honest business with the <NAME> , but fortunately <NAME> , who was detained on board by severe illness , perceived preparations for a simultaneous attack by land and sea upon the men sent to find water .
__label__0	<NAME> tried to resist at the risk of breaking his own oar , too , and <NAME> , with bleeding hands , seconded his efforts with all his might .
__label__0	<NAME> immediately apprised the colonists , who at once joined him in watching the summit of <NAME> .
__label__0	“ Thanks to our friend , all that remains to be done now is to get to <NAME> , and look out for traces of the wreck on the western coast. ” “ Or the eastern ? ” said <NAME> .
__label__0	“ Yes , master , ” replied <NAME> ; “ here , at the entrance , at the back of the mound , in a place sheltered from the rain and wind .
__label__1	Why , my limbs only made my breath shorter when I used ‘ em .
__label__0	Covering a great portion of that part of the southern hemisphere which lies east of the centre , it occupied a space of about 270 thousand square miles , its central point lying in 15° south latitude and 20° east longitude .
__label__0	He took great care not to touch these nests , to which their proprietors would not fail to return .
__label__0	<NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> knelt down together upon the tiles of the room .
__label__0	<NAME> immediately ordered the sails which were aiding the engine to be reefed ; but before this could be done his main-topsail was carried away .
__label__1	They sat down to the meal ; and broiled ham , eggs , tea , coffee and sundries , began to disappear with a rapidity which at once bore testimony to the excellence of the fare , and the appetites of its consumers .
__label__1	“ If you were to go before , ” said <NAME> , “ and stop the vehicle and horses from coming here , and were to wait somewhere for me ; would n't that be best ? ” <NAME> thought it might be best .
__label__1	Being much flushed and excited , I tumbled my half-guinea out of my pocket in pulling the card out .
__label__1	The building rang with a tremendous shout , and another , and another , and then it echoed loud groans , that gathered strength as they swelled out , like angry thunder .
__label__1	<NAME> , hooray , hooray ! —And now , <NAME> , let ’ s have a little talk about <NAME> .
__label__1	Placing a strong emphasis on the last word , he suffered his features gradually to resolve themselves into a ghastly grin , and , nodding his head , left the room .
__label__1	You will do him no harm .
__label__1	Then he thought how the long streets were dotted with lamps , and how the peaceful stars were shining overhead .
__label__0	But we must n't fall asleep in the delights of <NAME> , and we 'd better start out again . ''
__label__0	<NAME> did with him whatever he pleased .
__label__1	An amazing boy to learn , blessed with a good memory , and a ready understanding , and moreover with a good voice and ear for psalm-singing , in which he is the best among us .
__label__1	I ’ ll open the door directly , if you ’ ll wait an instant. ’ The gentlemen entreated him not to hurry himself ; and , to beguile the interval , had a fencing bout with their walking-sticks on the very small landing-place : to the unspeakable discomposure of all the other lodgers downstairs .
__label__0	As he spoke thus , <NAME> appeared superb in his vanity .
__label__0	“ The earth would have passed to the last bit into the furnaces of engines , machines , steamers , gas factories ; certainly , that would have been the end of our world one fine day ! ” “ There is no fear of that now , <NAME> .
__label__1	There was the same enforced composure on her face , that there had been when she was dressing ; and the wreath upon her head encircled the same cold and steady brow .
__label__0	I think , then , that we ought to adopt a material excellent in its way and of low price , such as cast iron .
__label__1	‘ I have not been here a week tomorrow , without considering that too , my dear , ’ she returned .
__label__0	The birds were still very numerous , and their cries were deafening ; the seals , lying lazily on the drifting ice , raised their heads without being frightened , and turned their long necks to watch the ship go by .
__label__0	Their skin was brown , and they had long black hair , straggling over the shoulders .
__label__1	Travellers ’ <NAME> , ’ cross the green. ’ The boy instantly darted off with the shilling , lest <NAME> should repent , but stopped at a safe distance , on the happy chance of his being uneasy in his mind about it , to goad him with a demon dance expressive of its irrevocability .
__label__1	Being besought to go to him and dress the wound , the <NAME> had passed out at the same gate , and had found him in the arms of a company of <NAME> , who were seated on the bodies of their victims .
__label__1	What botanical blotches would he cheerfully stick upon his cheek , or forehead , if the dear old lady convicted him of an imperceptible pimple there !
__label__0	He had not let go his prey , but gently sank down with it on the ground , about ten paces from the stream .
__label__0	246 <NAME> , in the <NAME> .
__label__1	He is very low and wretched at not having heard from his father. ’ ‘ Low , is he ? ’ said the old gentlemen .
__label__1	I do not quite know how to write what I wish to say next , but I trust you will understand it as I mean it .
__label__1	After labouring for two or three years in their precious scheme , to find that they ’ ve got a beggar at last , and one of them tied for life .
__label__1	said the doctor ; 'well , I do n't know ; perhaps it 's as honourable to hit a thief in a back kitchen , as to hit your man at twelve paces .
__label__1	Before he had got through the first two or three lines he began to open his eyes very wide and to frown most horribly , the next two or three caused him to scratch his head in an uncommonly vicious manner , and when he came to the conclusion he gave a long dismal whistle indicative of surprise and dismay .
__label__0	<NAME> was my servant , a true , devoted <NAME> boy , who had accompanied me in all my travels .
__label__0	Clearly , a deviation resulting from some cause .
__label__0	On his return to <NAME> Petersburg he was invested with all the honours of the <NAME> ; and a little later , at the suggestion of <NAME> , he was appointed to the command of an historical , archæological , and geographical expedition to the <NAME> .
__label__0	About five o ’ clock in the evening <NAME> and his companions retraced their steps to their dwelling by traversing <NAME> ’ s <NAME> , and crossed the <NAME> on the ice-bridge .
__label__0	During a storm which was encountered at the point where the strait opens into the <NAME> , <NAME> beheld one of his ships founder , while his last companion was separated from him a few days afterwards , nor did he see her again until the end of the campaign .
__label__0	What a comfort it was to the settlers to clothe themselves again in clean linen , which was doubtless rather rough , but they were not troubled about that !
__label__1	`` Since then , '' said I , `` we have never spoken on the subject except once . ''
__label__0	The feathered tribes were of most brilliant plumage , and of marvelous variety and deafening noise .
__label__1	By this time Mr <NAME> had remarked that he never found the visitor looking at any room , after throwing one quick glance around , but always found the visitor looking at him , Mr Flintwinch .
__label__1	I was very hot , and the voice I heard was very unlike mine , when I said , ‘ It is , sir ! ’ ‘ If I am not mistaken , ’ said <NAME> , as <NAME> brought a parcel of letters out of her reticule , tied round with the dearest bit of blue ribbon , ‘ those are also from your pen , <NAME> ? ’ I took them from her with a most desolate sensation ; and , glancing at such phrases at the top , as ‘ My ever dearest and own Dora , ’ ‘ My best beloved angel , ’ ‘ My blessed one for ever , ’ and the like , blushed deeply , and inclined my head .
__label__0	However , it was hoped that the next morning by break of day , if the calculation had been correct and the course true , they would sight <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ If I felt less , I could do more .
__label__1	How dare you dash against—everybody—in this manner ? ’ <NAME> picked up his cap , which the concussion had knocked off ; and backing , and knuckling his forehead , pleaded that it was an accident .
__label__1	After a few moments of painful hesitation , I broke the silence .
__label__1	‘ I ran up to her room ( which Mr Chivery showed me ) and found the door open , and that she had fainted on the floor , dear child .
__label__1	I want to found an opinion on what you tell me .
__label__0	“ How grand it is ! ” said he , “ and how infinite is the power of God even in its most terrible manifestations ! ” This overflow of blazing lava wrapped the sides of the mountain with a veritable drapery of flame ; the lower half of the balloon glowed redly in the upper night ; a torrid heat ascended to the car , and Dr. <NAME> made all possible haste to escape from this perilous situation .
__label__1	Something at which you can get your equal chance. ’ Occasionally the game would wax very brisk indeed , and would be kept up with a smartness rendering such an encounter as this quite tame .
__label__0	Three of our men had perished , and in what frightful fashion !
__label__1	something of that sort , ' replied <NAME> .
__label__0	The noise was enough to terrify even the boldest of wild beasts .
__label__0	They observed , with emotion , all that part to the north of the coast on which the catastrophe had taken place .
__label__0	The engine was manned by a driver and a stoker , and bore , by special favor , the <NAME> .
__label__1	If there must be such a shadow anywhere , I would keep it for the future in my own breast .
__label__1	Such a mind has Mr <NAME> , whom <NAME> finds contemplating Tippins with the moodiest of visages , while that playful creature rallies him on being so long overdue at the woolsack .
__label__0	he added , calling in a loud voice .
__label__0	This <NAME> was then a captain of the woods .
__label__1	‘ And how do YOU like the law ? ’ ‘ A -- not particularly , ’ returned <NAME> .
__label__1	“ Which I meantersay , ” cried <NAME> , “ that if you come into my place bull-baiting and badgering me , come out !
__label__0	How could it be otherwise with a place liable to incessant raids from the <NAME> ?
__label__1	Yes , my poor sister ; to the last. ” The same shadows that are falling on the prison , are falling , in that same hour of the early afternoon , on the <NAME> with the crowd about it , when a coach going out of <NAME> drives up to be examined .
__label__1	The success of this first achievement prompted the malicious crowd , whose faces were clustered together in every variety of lank and half-starved ugliness , to further acts of outrage .
__label__1	But , he never mentioned her as a woman .
__label__0	I only hope the ventilation will hold out. ” There was , however , nothing to fear on the score of ventilation .
__label__1	‘ Not a syllable , sir , from my man , if we talk till doomsday , ’ returned the captain .
__label__1	The President ’ s mansion is more like an <NAME> club-house , both within and without , than any other kind of establishment with which I can compare it .
__label__0	39 degrees N. ? ” “ Can ’ t say , sir .
__label__1	There are decent women in the house , I am told ; and it is a pity such a light as you should be among them , and concealed .
__label__1	And I tell you what , <NAME> , if I hadn ’ t more of these qualities that commonly endear man to man , than our articled clerk has , I ’ d steal a <NAME> cheese , tie it round my neck , and drown myself .
__label__0	`` Well , you English will ever be the same .
__label__1	With the first ray of light that struggled through the crevices in the shutters , <NAME> arose , and again unbarred the door .
__label__0	<NAME> replied that he was astonished to see the plains so saturated with water .
__label__0	<NAME> soon reached the warm mineral baths at the foot of the <NAME> , which , at that time , were much frequented , the company having built a house near the mountains .
__label__0	But they are only partial , during which the earth , cast like a screen upon the solar disc , allows the greater portion to be seen . ''
__label__0	At the same moment a blow from the sheet of the mainsail overthrew the first lieutenant , and sent him rolling to a distance , while the mizen-mast , which was not entirely lowered , was torn to pieces .
__label__1	<NAME> Mrs. <NAME> , we must all trust to that , in our heaviest misfortunes. ’ The earnestness of my manner , and the tears in my eyes , alarmed her .
__label__0	no -- I tell you he is not the master of our lives ; we must fly !
__label__0	When <NAME> had finished , he found himself relieved and comforted .
__label__1	And let me linger in this place , for an instant , to remark that if ever household affections and loves are graceful things , they are graceful in the poor .
__label__0	Guided by his father , and impelled by his own inclinations , he had early begun his education , and at an age when most lads are little more than apprentices , he had managed to make himself of some importance , a leader , in fact , among his fellows , and few are very ignorant in a country which does all it can to remove ignorance .
__label__1	The face of each child , as the amount of his contribution was mentioned , darkened in a peculiarly vindictive manner , but his was by far the worst .
__label__1	‘ Are you there , <NAME> ? ’ said her brother , looking in at the door .
__label__1	They set off Florence very much , to his fancy ; but not himself .
__label__1	There is a lady , certainly , at Mrs. <NAME> ’ s house , who is very clever , and whom I like to talk to -- <NAME> -- but I don ’ t adore her. ’ <NAME> laughed again at her own penetration , and told me that if I were faithful to her in my confidence she thought she should keep a little register of my violent attachments , with the date , duration , and termination of each , like the table of the reigns of the kings and queens , in the History of <NAME> .
__label__1	My narrative finished , and their questions exhausted , I then produced <NAME> 's authority to receive the nine hundred pounds for <NAME> .
__label__0	“ The truth , my Lord , is that we are at a standstill .
__label__1	Of course. ” “ _I_ think ? ” returned madame , in a high voice .
__label__0	`` And it was here , you say , that it took place ? ''
__label__1	Save me from Jere-_mi_-ah ! ’ Mr <NAME> had made a run at her , but <NAME> had caught him in his arms midway .
__label__1	But he invited <NAME> to dinner , and even brought him within range of the dangerous ( because expensive ) fascinations of <NAME> .
__label__0	The officers waited , ready to give their orders , according to circumstances .
__label__0	But I can also make the <NAME> rise and sink , and sink and rise , by a vertical movement by means of two inclined planes fastened to its sides , opposite the centre of flotation , planes that move in every direction , and that are worked by powerful levers from the interior .
__label__1	Over the young ladies , I see a Missis .
__label__1	`` And oh , miss , '' says <NAME> , clapping her hands , with the tears starting down her dimpled cheeks , `` <NAME> 's at school , if you please , and learning so good !
__label__1	As these works are pretty much alike all through the States , their general characteristics are easily described .
__label__0	I thought we were not following the same road to return to the <NAME> .
__label__0	On Saturday , the 20th June , at six o'clock in the evening , we reached <NAME> , a small town picturesquely situated on the shore of the ocean ; and here the guide asked for his money .
__label__1	She taught her , indeed , nearly all she knows .
__label__0	The chiefs and sorcerers seemed to be highly excited .
__label__1	‘ Fine doings in a person ’ s own house ! ’ ‘ Mrs .
__label__0	It explained the whole mystery .
__label__0	156 Map of the <NAME> .
__label__1	Sometimes , of an evening , when I was at home and at work -- for I wrote a good deal now , and was beginning in a small way to be known as a writer -- I would lay down my pen , and watch my child-wife trying to be good .
__label__1	All the livelong day , there is a grinding of organs and clashing and clanging of little boxes of music ; for <NAME> is an eel-pot , which has no outlet but its awkward mouth -- a case-bottle which has no thoroughfare , and a short and narrow neck -- and in this respect it may be typical of the fate of some few among its more adventurous residents , who , after wriggling themselves into <NAME> by violent efforts and contortions , find that it , too , is no thoroughfare for them ; that , like <NAME> , it leads to nothing beyond itself ; and that they are fain at last to back out , no wiser , no richer , not one whit more famous , than they went in .
__label__1	He refolds it and lays it in his desk with a countenance as unperturbable as death .
__label__1	We must , in a measure , assist to turn them up .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> will repeat to me tomorrow morning before breakfast , without book , and from the <NAME> , the first chapter of the <NAME> of <NAME> to the Ephesians .
__label__0	The orifice in the plates of the <NAME> was first closed , and fastened down by means of a false key , with which <NAME> had provided himself ; the opening in the boat was also closed .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> was leaning over me , saying , in a low voice , `` We are going to fly . ''
__label__1	‘ What ’ s the matter , ma ’ am ? ’ said <NAME> ; ‘ you don ’ t see a Fire , do you ? ’ ‘ Oh dear no , sir , ’ returned Mrs. Sparsit , ‘ I was thinking of the dew. ’ ‘ What have you got to do with the dew , ma ’ am ? ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	The <NAME> flag hung from the top of the staff in the bow , and the breeze was scarcely strong enough to lift the bunting .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , the pipkin ! ’ <NAME> drew forth , from the same hiding-place , a small brass pipkin , which <NAME> observed he prided himself upon , particularly because it looked so business-like .
__label__1	Doctors were sent for , and soon came .
__label__1	I found the <NAME> in possession of the intelligence , and I found that it made a great change in the <NAME> 's demeanour .
__label__0	He saw that his perplexity was increasing as the way became more difficult , but did not dare to interrogate him , rightly enough , perhaps , thinking that both mules and muleteers were very much governed by instinct , and it was best to trust to them .
__label__0	He therefore retired to the monastery of Mar-Hannd , in <NAME> , and devoted himself to the study of <NAME> .
__label__0	But , to bring this rapid sketch to a close , I will only add that a certain Hans Pfaal , of <NAME> , launching himself in a balloon filled with a gas extracted from nitrogen , thirty-seven times lighter than hydrogen , reached the moon after a passage of nineteen hours .
__label__1	‘ Well then , the way was this .
__label__1	The state of that wretch who continually finds the weak spots in his own crime , and strives to strengthen them when it is unchangeable , is a state that aggravates the offence by doing the deed a thousand times instead of once ; but it is a state , too , that tauntingly visits the offence upon a sullen unrepentant nature with its heaviest punishment every time .
__label__0	Deep wounds denoted great despair .
__label__0	cried <NAME> , twirling his glass in his despair .
__label__1	She took a step backward , and put out her hands in an undecided frightened way , as if to keep me off .
__label__0	a truce to your suppositions ; they ’ re any thing but pleasant. ” “ Ah !
__label__0	`` Oh then I suppose I must make the best of it , '' said <NAME> , laughing .
__label__1	The iron gentleman makes an iron bow .
__label__0	The same leaden hue , the same eternal glare from above .
__label__0	Several thousand <NAME> rushed to the assault of the earth-works .
__label__1	I will try , then , to forgive him his share of blame .
__label__0	At this place the beach was covered with little mounds , concealing perfectly spherical turtles ’ eggs , with white hard shells , the albumen of which does not coagulate as that of birds ’ eggs .
__label__0	<NAME> turned their presence to account as a means of reassuring his companions , who were beginning to be terribly frightened at not meeting with land after six weeks of sailing .
__label__1	It ’ s HIS daughter , is it ? ’ Naturally as this was said , it was not said so naturally but that a kindred spirit like old <NAME> might have discerned a design upon the part of <NAME> to lead him on to much more explicit statements and explanations than he would have volunteered , or that <NAME> could in all likelihood have obtained by any other means .
__label__1	`` Such things may be , '' repeats <NAME> , `` or they may not be .
__label__0	On the right bank of the river grew magnificent specimens of the ulmaceae tribe , the precious elm , so valuable to builders , and which withstands well the action of water .
__label__0	[ 5 ] [ Footnote 5 : The aim being to give up the slaves as property , it was a matter of indifference whether they were killed or set at liberty. -- _Trans._ ] Suspicious and crafty , cruel and vindictive , the Kaloches are neither better nor worse than the neighbouring tribes .
__label__1	Yes , <NAME> thought she had better go with me .
__label__0	`` I should like to know , '' interrupted M'Nicholl , `` what would be the good of throwing anything at all overboard .
__label__1	Being asked what he thinks of the proceedings , characterizes them ( his strength lying in a slangular direction ) as `` a rummy start . ''
__label__1	This evening he will be casually looking into the iron extinguishers at the door of <NAME> 's house in town ; and to-morrow morning he will be walking on the leads at <NAME> , where erst the old man walked whose ghost is propitiated with a hundred guineas .
__label__1	Now , I no longer Weep for the hour , When to <NAME> bower , The <NAME> of the valley with offers came ; Neither does the moon hide her light From the heavens to-night , And weep behind her clouds o ’ er any individual in the present <NAME> ’ s shame .
__label__0	Thus , some time after the return of the travelers , the public received with marked favor the announcement of a company , limited , with a capital of a hundred million of dollars , divided into a hundred thousand shares of a thousand dollars each , under the name of the `` <NAME> of <NAME> . ''
__label__0	`` That is true , '' answered <NAME> .
__label__1	But , it would have been a stranger contrast still , to have read the hearts that were beating side by side ; to have laid bare the gentle innocence of the one , and the rugged villainy of the other ; to have hung upon the guileless thoughts of the affectionate girl , and been amazed that , among all the wily plots and calculations of the old man , there should not be one word or figure denoting thought of death or of the grave .
__label__1	He was dressed in decent black , a little rusty , and had the appearance of a sagacious master in some handicraft .
__label__0	`` Is not this precisely the moment then , '' interposed <NAME> , quickly , `` for making an experiment which we could never have made as long as we were in the sunshine ? ''
__label__0	It was “ <NAME> felt , ” and <NAME> possessed yet another manufacture .
__label__0	The inspection ended , the doors of the carriages were then opened , but , before <NAME> could move towards her , the young <NAME> , who had been the first to descend , had disappeared in the crowd which thronged the platforms of the railway station .
__label__1	‘ I ’ ll go to him. ’ Goes out straightway , and , leisurely leaning his arms on the open window of a cab in waiting , looks in at Mr Dolls : who has brought his own atmosphere with him , and would seem from its odour to have brought it , for convenience of carriage , in a rum-cask .
__label__0	It was a work of the higher mechanics , appreciable only by mathematicians .
__label__0	The moon , now in her last quarter , had not yet risen .
__label__1	`` I am fond of boating .
__label__1	My partner. ’ Saying something apologetically as he crossed the hall , to the effect that at that time of night they were not in the habit of receiving any one , and were always shut up , Mr <NAME> led the way into his own office , which presented a sufficiently business-like appearance .
__label__1	‘ No. ’ ‘ Charming woman , <NAME> , ’ said the Major , with a fat laugh rising in his short throat , and nearly suffocating him .
__label__0	Their observations , recorded by <NAME> , were vigorously remade , revised , and re-determined , by the others .
__label__0	The distance of the projectile from the lunar disc was on the increase , and the details of the soil were being lost in a confused jumble .
__label__1	‘ Do you , though ? ’ said <NAME> , appearing to consider that fact in itself surprising .
__label__0	“ What ’ s the matter ? ” he cried , rousing himself , and collecting his ideas with the promptitude usual to seamen .
__label__0	The question of our wintering on the land whereon we had been thrown was settled for us .
__label__1	This is the young lady .
__label__1	Though it would cost him a hard pang to leave her , and though he could think of no similar place in which his condemnation would not pursue him , perhaps it was almost a relief to be forced away from the endurance of the last four days , even to unknown difficulties and distresses .
__label__0	At 11 o ’ clock she dropped anchor off <NAME> , and at 2 P.M. the passengers arrived at <NAME> amidst the enthusiastic cheering of the <NAME> .
__label__0	In 1776 an extract from the most important native codes , then for the first time translated under the title of the <NAME> of the <NAME> [ 1 ] was published in <NAME> .
__label__1	Good-bye. ’ The cordial face she lifted up to his to kiss him , was his home , his life , his universe , and yet it was a portion of his punishment and grief ; for in the cloud he saw upon it -- though serene and calm as any radiant cloud at sunset -- and in the constancy and devotion of her life , and in the sacrifice she had made of ease , enjoyment , and hope , he saw the bitter fruits of his old crime , for ever ripe and fresh .
__label__0	all was explained , everything -- except the presence of the torpedo in the waters of the channel !
__label__0	But at that moment a cry was heard , and a great orang , who had hidden himself in the passage , rushed into the room , pursued by <NAME> .
__label__0	The last named found himself at the head of a small fleet , consisting of the <NAME> , two sloops , the <NAME> and the <NAME> ; two schooners , the _Sea-Gull_ and the _Flying-Fish_ ; and a transport ship , the <NAME> , which was sent on in advance to Rio with a reserve of provisions , whilst the others touched at <NAME> , and the <NAME> .
__label__0	A magnificent plain , thickly covered with chrysanthemums , stretched out beyond the lake , and <NAME> and his friends would gladly have explored its beauties when they awoke next morning , but they had to start .
__label__0	The <NAME> had lost her consort , and the world was convinced that no Antarctic continent existed .
__label__1	‘ Can you drive ? ’ said the fat boy .
__label__0	The sea rolled heavily , and the wind at intervals rose almost to a storm , but happily blew from the south-west , and thus aided the steamer 's progress .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , in a monotonous forced way , ‘ is active in the business , <NAME> .
__label__0	If I feel too hot , I can ascend ; if too cold , I can come down .
__label__1	<NAME> withdrew his head , but thrust it in again .
__label__1	She withdrew her hand timidly from his arm as we stopped to speak to them , and blushed as she gave it to <NAME> and to me .
__label__1	She looked in amazement at her sister and would have asked a question , but that <NAME> with a warning frown pointed to a curtained doorway of communication with another room .
__label__0	The weather grew colder ; the thermometer fell to 32° , the freezing-point .
__label__0	<NAME> had never thought of this .
__label__1	`` To bless and receive me , '' groaned my mother , `` it is far too late .
__label__1	‘ Oh , if you please , you ’ re to come upstairs , ’ replied the tailor ’ s daughter , with a smile .
__label__1	Will you have the goodness to charge yourself with that commission , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Certainly ! ’ rejoined <NAME> .
__label__1	But I know nothing about it , I assure you ; for I am a mere child , and I lay no claim to it , and I do n't want it ! '
__label__0	You want to get away from the <NAME> 's <NAME> ; well , now is your chance ! ''
__label__0	I have failed at <NAME> , and I have failed at <NAME> ; if I fail at <NAME> , my reputation is lost : Cost what it may , I must succeed !
__label__1	You 're not in a fit state to come here , if you ca n't come here without spluttering like a bad pen .
__label__1	When his hollow voice broke silence , they all three started .
__label__1	‘ My dear girl ! ’ ‘ You frightened me. ’ ‘ Most unintentionally , but I am as sorry as if I had meant to do it .
__label__0	Top and <NAME> , the latter armed with his club , sometimes in front , sometimes beating the wood at the sides of the road , signalized no danger .
__label__1	He sat down beside me , taking some pains to sit on the form , I thought , in imitation of the print of his illustrious model on the sofa .
__label__0	The Projectile weighs about 20 thousand pounds , or 10 tons ? ''
__label__1	Do you know they would be ruined to pay off my old scores ?
__label__1	A lady of your sense and strength of character will be prepared for my now declaring it void and taking my own course . ''
__label__0	The waves ran very high ; the vessel rolled a great deal .
__label__0	That was the principal point .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> had not yet ventured to declare his attachment ; of rivals he was well aware he had not a few , and amongst these not the least formidable was the <NAME> Count Timascheff .
__label__1	And the one that went on only went on a certain way agreed upon to deceive and then turned across country and went home .
__label__1	My uncle , gentlemen , ’ said the bagman , ‘ was one of the merriest , pleasantest , cleverest fellows , that ever lived .
__label__1	She then got on her bonnet and went out , having been anxious to get out much sooner .
__label__1	When she was again in his arms , he said to her : “ And now speak to your father , dearest .
__label__1	He was dressed in a canvas jacket , and a pair of such very stiff trousers that they would have stood quite as well alone , without any legs in them .
__label__0	Then he became more calm , regained his accustomed coldness of expression , and turning towards me : `` Now , <NAME> , '' said he , `` if you wish to go over the <NAME> , I am at your service . ''
__label__0	This elicited loud applause , in the midst of which the orchestra was just striking up a deafening air , when the pyramid tottered , the balance was lost , one of the lower noses vanished from the pyramid , and the human monument was shattered like a castle built of cards !
__label__1	This is too hospitable and free. ’ By a great exertion of strength , he closed the two old gates , which were deeply sunken in the mud , and barred them with a heavy beam .
__label__1	She has her friend and counsellor always near . ''
__label__0	The night was dark , and a fine , steady rain was falling .
__label__1	growled <NAME> , in his accustomed voice , as near as he could feign it .
__label__1	‘ Excuse me , dear <NAME> , ’ said the poor lady , giving me her hand , ‘ but I am not strong ; and the removal of the late misunderstanding between <NAME> and myself was at first too much for me. ’ ‘ Is this all your family , ma ’ am ? ’ said my aunt .
__label__1	The savings upon that annuity , and some other items to your credit , all duly carried to account , with vouchers , will place you in possession of a lump-sum of money , rather exceeding <NAME> .
__label__0	Well , it was no use mincing the matter , I told her all .
__label__1	‘ No , no , ’ replied <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> came out again , exhorting the others to be vigilant , darkened his lantern , and once more took his seat .
__label__0	“ Why in the world , ” repeated <NAME> , “ should he take all this trouble to account for a set of facts so very easily and simply explained by the supernatural intervention of the spirits of the mine ? ” But , notwithstanding his objections to the scheme , <NAME> and three miners of his gang arrived next morning with <NAME> at the mouth of the opening of the suspicious shaft .
__label__1	‘ We ’ ll put you into your regular bedroom tomorrow , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	This is the place to give some details about the <NAME> of the <NAME> , drawn from <NAME> 's narrative , which we are following step by step in the version that M. Ed .
__label__0	The ship was the <NAME> brig <NAME> , laden with timber , and bound for <NAME> .
__label__0	Leaving the children to entertain each other , <NAME> began his address .
__label__1	I saw my mother stop her ears then , and I heard her crying .
__label__0	The ascent became very perilous .
__label__1	‘ Give them a glass of wine each to drink the toast in .
__label__1	‘ You know me , boy ? ’ ‘ Please , <NAME> , yes , <NAME> , ’ returned <NAME> , tumbling with his hat , and still fixed by Mr <NAME> ’ s eye , and fruitlessly endeavouring to unfix himself .
__label__1	It was wretched weather ; stormy and wet , stormy and wet ; and mud , mud , mud , deep in all the streets .
__label__1	‘ Have I startled you ? ’ he asked .
__label__1	Neither did it revive for more than a few moments when she once or twice afterwards glanced at <NAME> or at me through her glass .
__label__1	`` As good as gold , '' said <NAME> , `` and better .
__label__1	<NAME> smiled and lifted up his arm to touch him as he stood behind the head of the couch .
__label__0	The detonations as of artillery are incessant .
__label__1	You told me last night of a friend you had ? ’ His name was <NAME> , <NAME> said .
__label__1	There ! ’ Here <NAME> burst into tears .
__label__0	The longest of the streets of <NAME> runs parallel to the shore .
__label__0	The cliffs were confounded with the heavy , low-hanging clouds .
__label__1	She won ’ t come in MY way , he says .
__label__1	It may be profitable to that gentleman to know , sir , that I attribute my past follies , entirely to having lived a thoughtless life in the service of young men ; and to having allowed myself to be led by them into weaknesses , which I had not the strength to resist .
__label__1	‘ Dear Arthur , ’ said her delighted voice outside the door , ‘ I have some one here .
__label__0	There was another half-hour to wait , another half-hour of a nightmare , which might drive me mad .
__label__1	Oh , pray see if he is hurt. ’ ‘ He is not , I assure you , ’ replied <NAME> , handling the object of his surprise , after this appeal , with sudden tenderness and respect .
__label__1	The last I saw of him , his head was bent over his knee and he was working hard at his fetter , muttering impatient imprecations at it and at his leg .
__label__0	He had made use of his staff as a pole on which to fasten the <NAME> flag .
__label__0	Not one of the animals mentioned in the narrative was to be seen , and even the penguins which abound in the <NAME> regions had fled from this uninhabitable land .
__label__1	The great bell of <NAME> 's was striking one in the cleared air , when <NAME> , escorted by <NAME> , high-booted and bearing a lantern , set forth on his return-passage to <NAME> .
__label__0	It was between three and four thousand feet high , but nowhere presented any very salient features .
__label__1	And not only that , but <NAME> would presently , without any pointed application in the world , chance to say something with such a sting in it that <NAME> would draw back as if he had put his hand into a bee-hive .
__label__1	But in the morning it is whispered among the household that he was heard to go upstairs in the dead night , and that he stayed there -- in the room -- until the sun was shining .
__label__0	`` Not from such planets as <NAME> , _Venus_ or _Mars_ anyhow , friend <NAME> , '' observed <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> , it is well known , is only generated in coal seams ; therefore the existence of a vein of precious combustible could no longer be doubted .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> ’ t you though ! ’ said Mrs. Heep .
__label__0	After their departure , <NAME> and <NAME> went down to examine the state of the water by looking at the notches they had made on the tree , and <NAME> and <NAME> replenished the fire .
__label__1	<NAME> in the breast of her gown , the money to pay for her burial was still intact .
__label__0	We should be taken , delivered up to the mercy of those wretches , and <NAME> has shown us that he does not stop at a crime !
__label__0	The travellers followed a deep ravine , up to their waists in snow , and perspiring violently in spite of the intense cold .
__label__0	There was not a moment to lose , as the question of time was more important than any other .
__label__1	The power of this woman is astonishing .
__label__1	By degrees I learnt , and chiefly from <NAME> , that <NAME> had been educated at <NAME> and at <NAME> , where he had distinguished himself ; but that when he had had the happiness of marrying Mrs. Pocket very early in life , he had impaired his prospects and taken up the calling of a Grinder .
__label__1	But he wore out , poor man , so I have appointed his successor .
__label__1	One person whom he need not name to me , it was not now possible for him to advise or help .
__label__0	He therefore wished , without even returning to <NAME> and the colonies already settled , to direct his course at once to the <NAME> .
__label__0	`` Let 's see , '' asked <NAME> , `` who was <NAME> , and who was <NAME> ? ''
__label__0	“ It ’ s mighty easy to manage it ; you turn a cock , and the thing ’ s done. ” “ Ah !
__label__0	`` Yes , but I ought to have expected it , '' said the doctor ; `` and I should not have thrown the seed away so stupidly , especially since I might have started them near the kitchen stove . ''
__label__0	Looking at the matter from every point of view , it did not seem to him impossible that , by some mistake , the man might have embarked on the <NAME> at the last moment ; and this was also <NAME> 's opinion , who regretted very much the loss of the worthy fellow to whom she owed so much .
__label__1	But I won ’ t say anything more about it , if you ’ ll promise not to cry , that ’ s all ; and you take the baby that ’ s a lighter weight , and give me little <NAME> ; and as we go along ( which we must do pretty quick ) I ’ ll give you the news I bring , which will surprise you a little , I can tell you .
__label__0	A few churches , with <NAME> cupolas colored green and gold , stood up against the gray sky .
__label__0	Perhaps the two notables waited for the doctor at least an hour ; at least it is reasonable to suppose so , as the burgomaster -- a thing that had never before happened in his life -- betrayed a certain amount of impatience , from which his companion was not exempt .
__label__1	‘ Ah , well ! ’ he said , wiping his face .
__label__1	I find a woman. ’ The colour overspread her face .
__label__0	The authorities of <NAME> gave <NAME> a bottle found on the coast , which contained a document bearing these words : -- `` This 26th April , on board the 'Froöern , ' after being accosted by the long-boat of the 'Jeune-Hardie , ' we were drawn by the currents towards the ice .
__label__1	‘ So my friend being invited down to this marriage in <NAME> , ’ with a pleasant sense of the readiness of this joke , ‘ goes .
__label__0	The doctor took a stellar observation , and discovered that he was in the latitude of <NAME> .
__label__1	said the <NAME> , stopping short when there had been a long silence ; and addressing <NAME> .
__label__1	The candle was drawn back , and the face disappeared .
__label__1	Should possibilities be worse to bear than certainties ?
__label__0	Did he regret the words which he had just spoken in <NAME> ?
__label__0	The vast number of notes collected by <NAME> during the year he spent in <NAME> , and which led to the publication of his <NAME> on <NAME> , would , after what we have said of his previous proceedings , be enough to prove , if proof were needed , what a passion he had for knowledge , how indomitable was his energy and how immense his power of work .
__label__1	Arrived at the usurer ’ s house , he found the windows close shut , the dingy blinds drawn down ; all was silent , melancholy , and deserted .
__label__1	It was furnished with fresh young remembrances too , and even at the same moment I fell into much the same confused division of mind between it and the better rooms to which I was going , as I had been in so often between the forge and <NAME> 's , and <NAME> and <NAME> .
__label__1	One great blemish in the popular mind of <NAME> , and the prolific parent of an innumerable brood of evils , is <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> being indeed fatigued , fell into a slumber , and waking in about half an hour , inquired what time it was .
__label__1	‘ O you cruel godmother ! ’ She shook that emphatic little forefinger of hers in his face at parting , as earnestly and reproachfully as she had ever shaken it at her grim old child at home .
__label__1	The child readily complied , and he went out .
__label__0	I thought the second , by the `` <NAME> 's <NAME> , '' the best ; but it was regarded as too dangerous , and it was decided that we should attack the ice-wall conducting to the summit of the <NAME> .
__label__1	The <NAME> paused a moment , as observing his condition , and giving him time to recover .
__label__1	So he told it , and <NAME> was as much moved as amazed , and the dear fellow and I were not the worse friends for the long concealment .
__label__1	They came out of the avenue next moment , arm-in-arm as they had entered it : and the trees seemed to close up behind them in the darkness , like their own perspective of the past .
__label__0	Other bodies were found , as we trod the dusty plain , and my uncle was able to choose the most marvelous of these specimens in order to convince the most incredulous .
__label__0	What a wink it was that accompanied this sentiment !
__label__0	I was perfectly up in the subject which was the question of the day .
__label__0	No boat had put off from the island , nor had a native shown himself upon the beach .
__label__1	His clothes were shabby , but he had an imposing shirt-collar on .
__label__1	Besides ; if you are not filial , sir , if you discard that duty , you are at least -- hum -- not a <NAME> ?
__label__0	[ Illustration : It was <NAME> . ]
__label__1	said I , beginning to let down my hair .
__label__1	said I , with my eyes filling fast ; but I thought they might , when it was not for myself .
__label__1	It then becomes apparent that the woman has taken possession of this knife , for safety ’ s sake ; for , she too starting up , and restraining and expostulating with him , the knife is visible in her dress , not in his , when they drowsily drop back , side by side .
__label__0	Suddenly there was daylight in the saloon , the iron panels closed again , and the enchanting vision disappeared .
__label__0	At this time there were more than one hundred ships , large and small , in this roadstead , so flourishing was the trade of the <NAME> Company at this epoch .
__label__0	Five minutes after , as it was getting dark , I heard the barking of a dog .
__label__0	I call attention to this typical officer of the <NAME> , who was devoted body and soul to <NAME> Len Guy as to the schooner _Halbrane_ .
__label__1	Suddenly I came upon a pasteboard placard , beautifully written , which was lying on the desk , and bore these words : ‘ <NAME> CARE OF HIM .
__label__1	Containing the whole Science of Government 11 .
__label__0	`` We should all fall into the sun ! ''
__label__0	I informed my companions of the reason why the name of <NAME> had been changed to that of <NAME> in <NAME> Pym 's narrative , and of the circumstances under which the half-breed had apprised me of the fact .
__label__1	I remember the place well. ’ Looking very curiously round it .
__label__0	<NAME> bewailed himself , much disappointed at not being able to get into his kitchen , for the provisions which they had had on their expedition were exhausted , and they had no means of renewing them .
__label__1	My whispered words to Mrs. Bucket when she had the sheet in her mouth were , 'My dear , can you throw her off continually with natural accounts of my suspicions against <NAME> , and this , and that , and t'other ?
__label__0	`` Besides , '' observed <NAME> , `` a plain is easier to disembark upon than a mountain .
__label__0	<NAME> and <NAME> both died on the 27th December , the former soon after he left <NAME> with <NAME> , the latter at that town , to which he had returned to rest .
__label__0	The small <NAME> establishment , <NAME> or <NAME> , suited him perfectly , all the more that provisions were easily obtained there .
__label__0	Cases of all sorts encumbered it , and , as they had been but a very short time in the water , their contents were perhaps uninjured .
__label__1	It mayn ’ t be altogether safe , vith reference to gettin ’ out agin. ’ Deferring to his son ’ s feeling upon this point , <NAME> at once sought the erudite <NAME> , and acquainted him with his desire to issue a writ , instantly , for the _sum _of twenty-five pounds , and costs of process ; to be executed without delay upon the body of one <NAME> ; the charges thereby incurred , to be paid in advance to <NAME> .
__label__1	Having been hard at work in one dull enclosure all his life , he had a child ’ s delight in looking at shops .
__label__1	<NAME> given ; with the sarcastic addition ( from <NAME> ) of `` Without slugs , Polly ! ''
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> , in her seminarial state of existence , has combated the romantic aspect of this destiny by affecting to shake her head over it behind <NAME> ’ s dimpled shoulders , and to brood on the unhappy lot of that doomed little victim .
__label__0	He saw my hand in that of my uncle , and I venture to say that , taciturn as he was , his eyes beamed with lively satisfaction .
__label__1	It would seem as if there never was a book written , or a story told , expressly with the object of keeping boys on shore , which did not lure and charm them to the ocean , as a matter of course .
__label__1	For which I have been thanking her. ’ The Patriarch turning his head in a lumbering way towards <NAME> , that assistant put up the note-book in which he had been absorbed , and took him in tow .
__label__1	On opening it to let <NAME> out , she found Mr <NAME> , instead of having gone his way , as in any less wonderful place and among less wonderful phenomena he might have been reasonably expected to do , fluttering up and down the court outside the house .
__label__1	‘ Surely , surely , ’ returned <NAME> .
__label__1	But the boldest point he made was this : it was attempted to be set up , in proof of her jealousy , that she was under strong suspicion of having , at about the time of the murder , frantically destroyed her child by this man -- some three years old -- to revenge herself upon him .
__label__1	‘ I thought it wouldn ’ t be long , ’ said <NAME> , jumping up and producing a little basket from under the seat ; ‘ put what you haven ’ t had time to eat , in here , boys !
__label__1	The <NAME> liked his answering with a smile ; it looked pleasant .
__label__0	That night the temperature was the highest we had so far experienced .
__label__0	The crater was again boiling with lava which overflowed the back of the volcano .
__label__0	‘ And beside , ’ said he , ‘ it must be so nasty ! ’ ‘ Oh , father , ’ said the savage , looking greedily at the missionary , ‘ say that <NAME> forbids it !
__label__0	After having carefully inspected everything of interest in <NAME> , <NAME> went into <NAME> , little thinking that the continent he was exploring , extended thence to the tropic of <NAME> .
__label__0	The colonists left the <NAME> .
__label__1	Tried to nudge you , but you wouldn ’ t .
__label__1	If I do my duty , I do what I ought , and do no more than all the rest. ’ <NAME> any misgiving of which she was hardly conscious : any misgiving that had sprung into an indistinct and undefined existence since that recent night when she had gone down to her father ’ s room : that <NAME> ’ s accidental interest in her , and early knowledge of her , might have involved him in that powerful displeasure and dislike ?
__label__1	‘ Did I say “ before ? ” ’ replied old Sol .
__label__1	Mr <NAME> thought he had passed my young gentleman on the bridge yonder .
__label__1	‘ See after your friend , and be in the way to-morrow at one .
__label__1	He was a little bright creature with a rather large head , but a delicate face and a sweet voice , and there was a perfect charm in him .
__label__1	My childhood was passed with a grandmother ; that is to say , with a lady who represented that relative to me , and who took that title on herself .
__label__1	Or would it worry you just now ? ” “ <NAME> me by all means .
__label__1	‘ Yes , my lady lass , ’ returned the <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ I ’ ll not detain you any longer now , ’ he said , putting a crown into <NAME> ’ s hand , and looking towards the Notary .
__label__1	The room was lighted as of yore , and at the sound of our entrance , she stopped and turned .
__label__1	They wouldn ’ t wring his neck and me by , no , no .
__label__1	It warn ’ t much -- execution for nine pound nothin ’ , multiplied by five for costs ; but hows ’ ever here he stopped for seventeen year .
__label__1	The child beat his hand upon his heart ; and looked in his companion 's face , with tears of real agony .
__label__1	I found it quite a delightful place -- in front , the pretty avenue and drive by which we had approached ( and where , by the by , we had cut up the gravel so terribly with our wheels that I asked the gardener to roll it ) ; at the back , the flower-garden , with my darling at her window up there , throwing it open to smile out at me , as if she would have kissed me from that distance .
__label__1	`` Because I thought there war n't enough of you , perhaps ? ''
__label__0	`` My ship is on fire ! ''
__label__1	From early in the evening until nearly midnight , little groups of two and three presented themselves at the lodge-gate , and inquired , with anxious faces , whether any reprieve had been received .
__label__0	<NAME> G. Lejean even reports that he has seen it carried on , openly , under the <NAME> flag .
__label__0	“ You see , my dear <NAME> , ” said <NAME> , “ we have come too soon , like honest citizens who like to get their money ’ s worth .
__label__1	It is my intention , my dear Copperfield , to educate my son for the <NAME> ; I will not deny that I should be happy , on his account , to attain to eminence. ’ ‘ For the <NAME> ? ’ said I , still pondering , between whiles , on <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> Jup smoking calmly and seriously , sitting cross-legged like a Turk at the entrance to <NAME> !
__label__1	At last they reached the passage on the ground floor , where the snoring of Mr Quilp and his legal friend sounded more terrible in their ears than the roars of lions .
__label__1	There was a magnetism of dulness in them which would have beaten down the most facetious companion that the earth ever knew .
__label__0	The fact was , the learned geographer after his heroic exploits , could not escape celebrity .
__label__0	`` This appeared the more probable , '' says the narrative , `` because all the dried vegetables , such as peas , beans , lentils , & c. , together with the rice , and a quantity of biscuits , were spoiled in the store-room .
__label__1	At length , the <NAME> clock chiming one quarter , with a rapid turn he hurries in .
__label__0	The old watchmaker was buried in the midst of the peaks of <NAME> .
__label__1	'Perhaps I am , ' replied <NAME> ; ' I should think you was rather out of sorts too , unless you mean as little harm when you throw pewter pots about , as you do when you blab and -- ' 'Are you mad ? '
__label__1	They parted , therefore , in the friendliest manner , and with the kindest feeling on both sides .
__label__1	The banks low , the trees dwarfish , the marshes swarming with frogs , the wretched cabins few and far apart , their inmates hollow-cheeked and pale , the weather very hot , mosquitoes penetrating into every crack and crevice of the boat , mud and slime on everything : nothing pleasant in its aspect , but the harmless lightning which flickers every night upon the dark horizon .
__label__1	Some of these leaves , in a timid rush , seek sanctuary within the low arched Cathedral door ; but two men coming out resist them , and cast them forth again with their feet ; this done , one of the two locks the door with a goodly key , and the other flits away with a folio music-book .
__label__0	<NAME> 's presentiments were not mistaken , when he wished to hunt them as wild beasts .
__label__1	I had had the key that was found , made long before .
__label__0	The two friends -- for they were so -- no longer prowled round the opening of the inner well , nor did they bark or whine in that singular way which from the first the engineer had noticed .
__label__1	The celebration of a birthday in the family .
__label__0	During that night , <NAME> was twenty times on the point of looking for and joining his mother ; but he knew that he must resist the longing he felt to take her in his arms , and once more press the hand of his young companion .
__label__1	All day long , and until seven or eight in the evening , <NAME> , at his own detached desk in the schoolroom , worked hard with pen , ink , ruler , books , and writing-paper , making out the bills ( as I found ) for last half-year .
__label__1	‘ I thought it possible , ’ resumed the other , ‘ that you might have been advised from <NAME> -- ’ ‘ We have had no advice from <NAME> respecting anybody of the name of <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	All this , so quickly , that her exclamation and her dead condition seem to have passed away like the features of those long-preserved dead bodies sometimes opened up in tombs , which , struck by the air like lightning , vanish in a breath .
__label__0	asked <NAME> , looking at him intently .
__label__1	‘ Of course , ’ replied <NAME> , who had by this time advanced , horse in hand , to the garden rails .
__label__0	`` No , sir , you shall not go alone , '' cried the captain , touched in spite of himself .
__label__1	said the beadle , raising his hand with a show of authority .
__label__1	‘ In the course of the week , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ we shall be happy to see <NAME> to tea .
__label__0	A circle of fire hemmed the <NAME> in ; the crackling of the dry wood mingled with the hissing and sputtering of the green branches ; the clambering vines , the foliage , all the living part of this vegetation , writhed in the destructive element .
__label__0	In time <NAME> became a partner .
__label__1	In a moment , the whole company were on their feet .
__label__0	Now my worthy uncle , the Professor , no doubt regarded this discovery as a very simple fact , but to me the idea was by no means a pleasant one .
__label__0	`` I know it , '' replied the burgomaster , in a tone of vanity very pardonable in the chief magistrate of <NAME> .
__label__0	No sign of the buoy could yet be seen in any direction ; it had probably been drifted southward by the <NAME> coast current which slowly glides along these shores from December to April .
__label__1	Why , he might have been going to reveal it the very morning when I examined the body !
__label__1	We must have <NAME> here .
__label__0	said I , beginning to be alarmed .
__label__0	I swam more vigorously ; but , cramped by my clothes , which stuck to me like a leaden weight , I felt great difficulty in bearing up .
__label__0	This island produces arrack ( the alcohol of rice ) , camphor , cinnamon , ginger , oranges , citrons , sugar-canes , melons , radishes , onions , & c. The articles of exchange are copper , quicksilver , cinnabar , glass , woollen cloths , and canvas , and above all iron and spectacles , without mentioning porcelain , and diamonds , some of which were of extraordinary size and value .
__label__1	‘ You are Mr <NAME> , the new schoolmaster ? ’ he said , greeting <NAME> ’ s kind friend .
__label__1	What time the beadle , hovering between the door of <NAME> 's establishment and the door of the <NAME> 's <NAME> , shows the curiosity in his keeping to a few discreet spirits and accepts the compliment of a glass of ale or so in return .
__label__1	Mrs <NAME> received him with great distinction ; the bosom was in admirable preservation , and on the best terms with itself ; the dinner was very choice ; and the company was very select .
__label__1	What did you do then ?
__label__0	But , seeing that <NAME> let me speak without saying too much himself , I pressed him more closely .
__label__0	The ground , formerly black with coal dust , had a bright look , to which <NAME> ’ s eyes were not accustomed .
__label__1	Here and there , and frequently too , we encountered a solitary broken-down waggon , full of some new settler ’ s goods .
__label__0	Was it owing to the habit , now become a second nature , of living on information , that their mental constitution had thus become really transformed ?
__label__1	‘ I ’ m sure to bring him through it , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	No , because he has never seen him , ’ rejoined <NAME> ; ‘ but if we were to bring them together , who knows , <NAME> , but <NAME> , properly introduced , would serve his turn almost as well as little Nell or her grandfather -- who knows but it might make the young fellow ’ s fortune , and , through him , yours , eh ? ’ ‘ Why , the fact is , you see , ’ said Mr <NAME> , ‘ that they HAVE been brought together. ’ ‘ Have been ! ’ cried the dwarf , looking suspiciously at his companion .
__label__0	Every day as I pass the cabin I peep in through the keyhole , and one of these days I 'll tell you what he looks like , and how he 's made . ''
__label__1	It was yet early , and the old man being still asleep , she walked out into the churchyard , brushing the dew from the long grass with her feet , and often turning aside into places where it grew longer than in others , that she might not tread upon the graves .
__label__1	If I once shook the foundations of the sacred confidence and usage , in virtue of which it was given to me , it was lost , and could never be recovered .
__label__1	It would be impossible to save the family credit for a day .
__label__1	'Your tale is of the longest , ' observed Monks , moving restlessly in his chair .
__label__0	Our occupation continued on the 8th , 9th , and 10th February , and our task was finished in the afternoon of the 10th .
__label__0	At this depth I could still see the rays of the sun , though feebly ; to their intense brilliancy had succeeded a reddish twilight , the lowest state between day and night ; but we could still see well enough ; it was not necessary to resort to the <NAME> apparatus as yet .
__label__1	<NAME> ; isn ’ t it ? ’ ‘ Very , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	Before daybreak the troops of Feofar-Khan had retreated into their camp , leaving a large number of dead on and below the ramparts .
__label__1	<NAME> him to drink it , <NAME> . '
__label__1	‘ I ’ ll take ‘ em. ’ ‘ The boots and clothes are extras , ’ said <NAME> ; ‘ and the fires in winter time are -- ’ ‘ Are all agreed to , ’ answered the single gentleman .
__label__0	Did escape occur to him ?
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> 's eyes brightened for an instant .
__label__1	I write the exact truth .
__label__0	said <NAME> , who seemed for an instant perplexed .
__label__0	This new expedition doubled the Cape of <NAME> without misadventure , discovered between <NAME> and <NAME> an unknown island , which was named after the commander of the fleet , and arrived at <NAME> , where <NAME> was informed of the events which had taken place at <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ When I happened to say to that naughty thing , the other day , ’ pursued her mother , shaking her head and her fan at her , playfully , ‘ that there was a family circumstance she might mention to you -- indeed , I think , was bound to mention -- she said , that to mention it was to ask a favour ; and that , as you were too generous , and as for her to ask was always to have , she wouldn ’ t. ’ ‘ <NAME> , my dear , ’ said the Doctor .
__label__0	`` We propose to construct a vessel , '' said <NAME> , `` sufficiently large to convey us to the nearest land ; but if we should succeed , sooner or later we shall return to <NAME> .
__label__0	It adjoined an old stone hostelry , previously occupied by a detachment of engineers , and which now afforded shelter for <NAME> and the two horses .
__label__0	He had come , he urged , bringing Bello a letter and presents from the King of <NAME> , relying upon the confidence inspired by the sultan 's letter of the previous year , and he hoped his host would not forfeit that confidence by tampering with another person 's letter .
__label__1	‘ Well , I ’ m pretty well , thank ’ ee , <NAME> , ’ said Mr Toots .
__label__1	After a few words of confidence in the result of their project had been exchanged , they bade the grinning <NAME> good night .
__label__1	<NAME> of you gentlemen ’ s name ’ s <NAME> ? ’ At this inquiry , <NAME> gave such a very undisguised and palpable start , that no further reply was needed .
__label__0	Our fishermen frequently see some that are more than four feet long .
__label__1	He would go on with a musing repetition of the title of his old firm twenty thousand times , and at every one of them , would turn his head upon his pillow .
__label__0	It was necessary , however , first to allow them to land , for with their close , short hair , and their fusiform conformation , being excellent swimmers , it is difficult to catch them in the sea , while on land their short , webbed feet prevent their having more than a slow , waddling movement .
__label__1	‘ I say again , I don ’ t know what man he is .
__label__0	However , the sailor thought that by stopping-up some of the openings with a mixture of stones and sand , the <NAME> could be rendered habitable .
__label__1	I just makes out to cry , “ I know you now !
__label__1	'No , ' said <NAME> ; 'to hear you repeat it , if you will -- finally repeat it !
__label__1	In another there was a large hotel , whose walls and colonnades were so crisp , and thin , and slight , that it had exactly the appearance of being built with cards .
__label__0	“ I foresee that they are going to make a god of me again , ” thought he , “ some son of the moon most likely .
__label__0	`` What heat does the thermometer really indicate ? ''
__label__0	He was a good draughtsman , an excellent rider -- having thoroughly mastered the successor to the famous “ <NAME> ” at the riding-school of <NAME> Cyr -- and in the records of his military service his name had several times been included in the order of the day .
__label__1	I acted on Mrs. Crupp ’ s opinion , and gave the order at the pastry-cook ’ s myself .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> observed that his watch was two hours too fast .
__label__1	Here , too , are <NAME> and <NAME> , and the two other Buffers ; each Buffer with a flower in his button-hole , his hair curled , and his gloves buttoned on tight , apparently come prepared , if anything had happened to the bridegroom , to be married instantly .
__label__1	I will not tell you that it will soon pass ; I will not tell you that it is the fancy of the moment ; I will not tell you that such caprices have their rise and fall among the young and ardent every hour ; I will leave you undisturbed in the belief that it has few parallels or none , that it will abide with you a long time , and that it will be very difficult to conquer .
__label__0	This imprisonment in the corral wearies me horribly , and I have never felt so excited as I do now .
__label__1	`` Your ladyship is acquainted with the name of <NAME> ? ''
__label__1	In the vagueness and indistinctness of all her new experiences and perceptions , as everything about her was mysterious to herself she began to be mysterious to others : and became as difficult to be made out to anybody ’ s satisfaction as she found the house and everything in it difficult to make out to her own .
__label__1	‘ Is it ! ’ said my aunt .
__label__0	<NAME> had accepted the offer with much pleasure , and so , after breakfast on the day we speak of , at about eleven o ’ clock , the two young men and the two girls met on the bank at the angle where the two streams joined .
__label__0	`` Nothing , at least yet awhile , friend <NAME> , '' replied <NAME> , `` I have been watching the thermometer carefully for the last few minutes , and , though we are at present at 38° centigrade , or 100° Fahrenheit , I have noticed that the mercury is slowly falling .
__label__1	Ma ’ amselle was a little slow to observe it , as though she were not yet well accustomed to the <NAME> tongue .
__label__1	‘ He von ’ t begin , sir , ’ rejoined <NAME> ; ‘ he knows I ain ’ t ekal to ex-pressin ’ myself ven there ’ s anythin ’ partickler to be done , and yet he ’ ll stand and see me a-settin ’ here taking up your walable time , and makin ’ a reg ’ lar spectacle o ’ myself , rayther than help me out vith a syllable .
__label__1	‘ The fact is , I was ruined by having money left me. ’ ‘ Come , come , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ that von ’ t do .
__label__0	<NAME> penetrations into the interior proved the capacious windings of the river ; the valley narrowed , the hills were succeeded by mountains , at every step the way became more difficult .
__label__0	<NAME> Heaven that I may arrive at <NAME> before them ! ” The firing became gradually louder , and soon to the left of <NAME> a mist collected -- not smoke , but those great white clouds produced by discharges of artillery .
__label__1	There was not one touch of tenderness or pity in it .
__label__0	“ Let us give them names , as the <NAME> did , whose story <NAME> has often read to me ; Providence Bay , <NAME> , <NAME> ! ” “ Or , rather , the names of <NAME> , ” said <NAME> , “ of <NAME> , of <NAME> ! -- ” “ My name ! ” cried <NAME> , showing his sparkling white teeth .
__label__0	I 've heard of making ice with fire ; perhaps he will make fire with ice . ''
__label__1	Before what ? ’ said <NAME> , putting her hand upon his arm .
__label__0	exclaimed <NAME> , falling into a chair .
__label__0	Spends his time in scanning the horizon , at every point of the compass .
__label__1	‘ Now , ’ was his debate with himself ‘ shall I foller you on , or shall I let you loose for this once , and go a fishing ? ’ The debate continuing , he followed , as a precautionary measure in any case , and got him again in sight .
__label__0	The settlers had frequently been obliged to renew their store of wood .
__label__0	But there , what quiet , what silence , what peace !
__label__0	Passing before the lantern , he smashed it with a blow from the butt of his revolver .
__label__1	‘ Never owed her a penny , <NAME> ’ r , ’ said <NAME> , in a low voice , and with visible marks of trepidation on his countenance .
__label__0	The country was evidently habitable and inhabited .
__label__0	Owing to the precaution that had been taken on the previous day , when the cargo was stowed away in the clefts , it had been only slightly damaged .
__label__1	Doing charmingly. ’ ‘ I am very happy and very thankful to know it , ’ said the debtor , ‘ though I little thought once , that -- ’ ‘ That a child would be born to you in a place like this ? ’ said the doctor .
__label__1	I am not sure but that at first he was inclined to think it rather a moody scheme , and one that might do a brooding mind harm .
__label__1	‘ I am not too proud to believe it , <NAME> .
__label__1	The more they let out , the more you keep in. ’ ‘ I don ’ t object , <NAME> , ’ returned <NAME> , with an internal chuckle , ‘ to being understood , though I object to being questioned .
__label__1	It ’ s in the lining of the mattress , <NAME> .
__label__0	`` Good , '' replied <NAME> ; `` your projectiles would have no effect on the sun ; they would fall back upon the earth after some minutes . ''
__label__0	His reason for coming to this conclusion was that the caloric emitted by the rising vapors of the hot lava seemed to be oozing , as it were , out of the tellurium , which had been demonstrated already to be a conductor of heat .
__label__0	Can he leave the island if he likes ?
__label__1	The frozen particles of ice , brushed from the blades of grass by the wind , and borne across my face ; the hard clatter of the horse ’ s hoofs , beating a tune upon the ground ; the stiff-tilled soil ; the snowdrift , lightly eddying in the chalk-pit as the breeze ruffled it ; the smoking team with the waggon of old hay , stopping to breathe on the hill-top , and shaking their bells musically ; the whitened slopes and sweeps of Down-land lying against the dark sky , as if they were drawn on a huge slate !
__label__1	<NAME> was very full of it ; and said , that , picturing himself with such a home , and <NAME> waiting and preparing for him , he could think of nothing wanting to complete his bliss .
__label__1	‘ He stands up to you like -- like a -- why I don ’ t know what he don ’ t stand up to you like .
__label__1	Both times at night , when I was going back .
__label__0	his return to social life will have been but of short duration . ''
__label__1	He used fur to say to me , ' I am as poor as you to-day , <NAME> , ' he ses .
__label__1	Many feet came up the creaking stairs ; and the step of some seemed to his listening ear so like that of the man for whom he waited , that <NAME> often stood up to be ready to address him when he reached the top ; but , one by one , each person turned off into some room short of the place where he was stationed : and at every such disappointment he felt quite chilled and lonely .
__label__1	At those times I used to think , how should I ever tell the two remaining babies that the baby who had learned of her faithful heart to be a mother to them in their need was dead !
__label__1	Besides , ’ said <NAME> , with logical good faith , ‘ I shall have a debt to pay off , by littles , and naturally that would bring me back , if nothing else would. ’ ‘ MUST it be done ? ’ asked <NAME> , still reluctant , of the Secretary .
__label__1	That blow , unless there is a full retraction on the part of <NAME> , <NAME> is ready to justify. ’ ‘ There is no more to be said , ’ returned the other , ‘ but to settle the hour and the place of meeting .
__label__1	He made the most dismal sounds I have ever heard produced by any means , natural or artificial .
__label__0	You can not reason with pride , the principal of all the vices , since , by its very nature , the proud man refuses to listen to it .
__label__0	`` At <NAME> the beef is excellent , but it is difficult to procure enough of it to feed a fleet .
__label__1	My guardian had made up his mind not to lose sight of me until I was safe in <NAME> 's house , so he accompanied us , and we were two days upon the road .
__label__0	<NAME> Hans the guide mean to abandon us ?
__label__0	Herming reloaded his pistol without replying .
__label__0	It was an island situated at the north-eastern extremity of <NAME> , and very near the coast .
__label__1	They followed the girl up some steep corner-stairs without meeting any one , and stopped in the dark while she went on for a candle .
__label__0	The moon had grown so large in their eyes that it filled half of the firmament .
__label__1	inquired <NAME> , with well-timed jocularity .
__label__1	Here were she , <NAME> , and her husband discoursing at once affectingly and effectively , but discoursing alone .
__label__0	Thus far hidden by clouds or by the lofty mountains surrounding it , the peak at last stands forth distinctly , the incline becomes less steep , and those vast plains of intensely melancholy appearance , called <NAME> by the <NAME> , on account of their bareness , are crossed .
__label__1	Why , Wemmick. ” I could not have spoken one word , though it had been to save my life .
__label__0	To see them first , and then to hear them , such was the universal longing .
__label__1	I am aware that I am merely a female , and that a masculine judgement is usually considered more competent to the discussion of such questions ; still I must not forget that , when I lived at home with my papa and mama , my papa was in the habit of saying , “ Emma ’ s form is fragile , but her grasp of a subject is inferior to none. ” That my papa was too partial , I well know ; but that he was an observer of character in some degree , my duty and my reason equally forbid me to doubt. ’ With these words , and resisting our entreaties that she would grace the remaining circulation of the punch with her presence , Mrs. Micawber retired to my bedroom .
__label__1	‘ There , ’ said <NAME> , pausing for breath when they reached another gallery of the same dimensions as the one below , ‘ this is the coffee- room flight ; the one above ’ s the third , and the one above that ’ s the top ; and the room where you ’ re a-going to sleep to-night is the warden ’ s room , and it ’ s this way -- come on. ’ <NAME> said all this in a breath , <NAME> mounted another flight of stairs with <NAME> and <NAME> following at his heels .
__label__0	The wind had died away completely with the twilight .
__label__1	We had a beautiful little dinner .
__label__0	`` Well , sterile as it is , it supports a good many inhabitants , and among them are some civilized Europeans . ''
__label__1	I had long tasks every day to do with <NAME> ; but I did them , there being no Mr. and <NAME> here , and got through them without disgrace .
__label__1	‘ Go on , sir , go on .
__label__1	They are married , and have signed their names in one of the old sneezy registers , and the clergyman ’ s surplice is restored to the dust , and the clergyman is gone home .
__label__1	<NAME> , '' said <NAME> , `` only cried and said he hoped we might get on better than he and <NAME> had got on .
__label__1	<NAME> sobs out that she is very sorry to leave my <NAME> , and that she was happy at <NAME> , and has been happy with my Lady , and that she thanks my Lady over and over again .
__label__1	`` Why , '' said <NAME> , `` to tell the truth , <NAME> , this view of the matter had not occurred to me until Mrs. <NAME> mentioned it .
__label__1	So , I hope you like my feeling independent ; if you don ’ t , I can ’ t help it .
__label__1	Now my soul , my gentle , captivating , bewitching , and most demnebly enslaving chick-a-biddy , be calm , ’ said <NAME> , humbly .
__label__1	Did she send here for you ? ’ ‘ No .
__label__0	The <NAME> , trusting like the Czar in their patriotism , had armed them , and they had thoroughly proved their bravery .
__label__0	At one particular instant , it was so very vivid that <NAME> , who happened to be looking downwards , cried out , as if in transport : `` Oh ! !
__label__1	A hard one to me , but it is a necessary one .
__label__0	<NAME> is obliged to discover a planet , or a comet , or even a satellite , but , before announcing to the world that you have made such a discovery , first make sure that such is really the fact .
__label__0	The cart was waiting on the beach before the <NAME> .
__label__1	This is the third time of your hinting and threatening .
__label__0	I returned to my room , clothed myself warmly -- sea boots , an otterskin cap , a great coat of byssus , lined with sealskin ; I was ready , I was waiting .
__label__1	“ And she might credit it .
__label__0	I will be that audacious traveler -- I , too , will sign my name upon the very same spot , upon the central granite stone of this wondrous work of the Creator .
__label__0	But as to entering the channel , <NAME> , contrary to <NAME> 's opinion , could not believe that she would dare to attempt it .
__label__1	I am well aware , sir , of the many demands upon your time , and its -- ha -- enormous value , ’ Mr Dorrit could not say enormous roundly enough for his own satisfaction .
__label__1	‘ Ha , ha ! ’ cried Mr Slum , ‘ you ’ re giving way , you ’ re coming down .
__label__0	From the day his decision was taken he had been another man , and when he busied himself about the preparations for the expedition he regained his former activity .
__label__0	Some wore crowns of birds ' feathers .
__label__1	Tell me more of your history .
__label__0	`` Well , Dr. Clawbonny , what do you think of that ? ''
__label__1	<NAME> home directly , you cruel boy !
__label__1	Mr Dombey is a white-haired gentleman , whose face bears heavy marks of care and suffering ; but they are traces of a storm that has passed on for ever , and left a clear evening in its track .
__label__1	Outside a stable door at the bottom of a long back lane without a thoroughfare , a groom in undress was idling about , apparently persuading himself that he was doing something with a spade and a wheel-barrow .
__label__0	<NAME> then explained to <NAME> that he thought he ought first of all to stop the hemorrhage , but not close the two wounds , or cause their immediate cicatrization , for there had been internal perforation , and the suppuration must not be allowed to accumulate in the chest .
__label__0	It will never be known what was the exact number of the slain , but it must have been considerable .
__label__0	This , however , was not admissible in the case of <NAME> .
__label__1	So that some of us thinks he ’ s peeping out towards where his own country is , and some of us thinks he ’ s looking for somebody he don ’ t want to see , and some of us don ’ t know what to think. ’ Mr <NAME> seemed to have a general understanding of what she said ; or perhaps his quickness caught and applied her slight action of peeping .
__label__0	This expression rather disturbed Fix , without his knowing why .
__label__1	`` You come here to make a remarkably modest demand , which you have just stated , and it not being conceded , you will come again . ''
__label__0	When their cargo was completed , they set sail .
__label__0	Some of their words are nine or ten syllables long , and yet they can only count up to three .
__label__0	The entrance is narrow , and forts might easily be constructed to command vessels entering it .
__label__0	At last we were about to leave our encampment and take up our stations ( some of the sailors were there already ) , when cries of amazement and fear were raised .
__label__1	‘ Come ! ’ said he , ‘ you know what you have engaged to do .
__label__1	As <NAME> himself , utterly regardless of his sister , had this object at heart , only second to the hope of gain , it seemed to him the more likely to be <NAME> ’ s main principle of action .
__label__0	During this trying period <NAME> and <NAME> worked hard , each in the portions of the enclosure in which they found themselves .
__label__1	My sister , Mrs. <NAME> , throwing the door wide open , and finding an obstruction behind it , immediately divined the cause , and applied <NAME> to its further investigation .
__label__0	Under the influence of hunger this reasoning appeared admirable .
__label__0	<NAME> ( translation from <NAME> )
__label__0	Several whaling vessels were lying quietly at anchor there , for the coast abounds in seals and other marine animals .
__label__0	Their offer was accepted , and they embarked on a government vessel for <NAME> , where they arrived on the 19th March , 1830 .
__label__1	‘ I said to <NAME> ( not that it was necessary , for she would have thought it all for herself ) , we are practical people , my dear , and we know her story ; we see in this unhappy girl some reflection of what was raging in her mother ’ s heart before ever such a creature as this poor thing was in the world ; we ’ ll gloss her temper over , <NAME> , we won ’ t notice it at present , my dear , we ’ ll take advantage of some better disposition in her another time .
__label__1	In saying what he said then , he never looked at her ; but looked at it and wrenched at it .
__label__0	They admitted Surville to their schemes , and sent him to <NAME> to obtain the needful authority from the <NAME> , and to superintend the equipment of the vessel .
__label__0	That is why I desire the presence of Messrs. Paganel and <NAME> , for it is , properly speaking , a bargain which I propose to make. ” <NAME> , accustomed to <NAME> ’ s ways , exhibited no surprise , though any bargaining between this man and himself seemed strange .
__label__0	_phyj slyd dqfd_ and that gave _o.vd rdv .
__label__1	`` What do you call him again ? ''
__label__1	While she sat weeping , it grew late , and dreary midnight tolled out from the steeples .
__label__0	Yes -- it was all a dream .
__label__1	Otherwise , ma ’ am , we know out of whose pocket _that_ money comes. ’ ‘ Ah—h ! ’ sighed Mrs. Sparsit again , with another melancholy shake of her head .
__label__0	<NAME> is but a relative expression , and must end by being reduced to zero . ''
__label__1	<NAME> , <NAME> , I have ruined <NAME> !
__label__1	‘ I see how it is , ’ said poor Noggs , drawing from his pocket what seemed to be a very old duster , and wiping <NAME> ’ s eyes with it , as gently as if she were an infant .
__label__0	He soon found a channel , which shortly brought them to the open sea .
__label__0	“ He is a brother that will never forsake us , never !
__label__1	‘ My dear Ma , I particularise eight. ’ ‘ The exact size of the table and the room , my dear. ’ So it was settled that way : and when <NAME> called with his mother upon <NAME> , to arrange for the reception of <NAME> at the <NAME> ’ <NAME> , the two other invitations having reference to that establishment were proffered and accepted .
__label__1	'Coals , candles , and house-rent free , ' said <NAME> .
__label__0	“ Yes , that the <NAME> should leave <NAME> , and go to the east coast. ” “ Oh , always the same story !
__label__1	If the dear old creatures were too bashful or too dull to assume their required places in the discussion , why then it would seem desirable that the dear old creatures should be taken by their heads and shoulders and brought into it .
__label__1	If I am present at the meeting -- a mutual friend , who is old enough to be the father of both parties -- the voice of calumny can never be raised against her hereafter. ’ <NAME> ’ s eyes lightened with honest exultation at his own foresight , as he spoke thus .
__label__1	You a hold upon me !
__label__1	I don ’ t say she has got it .
__label__1	“ Is it not impressive , <NAME> ? ” asked <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> , the governor , gave a cordial reception to the expedition , and at once took the necessary steps to furnish it with provisions .
__label__0	It was a sorrowful commencement for a campaign , a sad presage which was destined not to remain unfulfilled .
__label__1	This resistance only infuriated <NAME> the more ; who , dropping on his knees , began to assail the animal most furiously .
__label__0	The distress of the commander can be imagined .
__label__1	He had very ingeniously manufactured a sort of <NAME> clock from some disregarded odds and ends ; and his vinegar-bottle served for the pendulum .
__label__1	I have tried hard to think it not worth remembering , but I can not make so little of it .
__label__0	Consequently , many millions of acres of the island had still escaped their investigations .
__label__1	As to <NAME> , he was becoming that not unprecedented triumph of calculation which is usually at work on number one .
__label__0	They employed the day in interring the dead , who were dragged to the forest of the <NAME> , and there buried deep .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> was equally anxious to try the vessel , the model of which had originated with him , although on the sailor 's advice he had altered some parts of it , but he did not share <NAME> 's confidence in her , and as the latter had not again spoken of the voyage to <NAME> , <NAME> hoped he had given it up .
__label__1	She will be in a state of mind to impeach the justice of the <NAME> .
__label__1	You may be aware , <NAME> -- and , possibly , you may be aware too , <NAME> -- that a little distance has interposed itself between me and some of my friends , and that where I used to visit a good deal , I do not visit now. ’ Polly , who , with a woman ’ s tact , understood this at once , expressed as much in a little look .
__label__0	But <NAME> would not lose a day nor an hour in scouring the seas in which the animal had been sighted .
__label__1	As there was only one house in the enclosure , there was no room for uncertainty , so he went up the steps of that house and knocked .
__label__0	The fatal moment had , however , at last arrived .
__label__1	A carriage at the gate , and <NAME> ’ s man arrives , looking rather like a spurious <NAME> and an unacknowledged member of that gentleman ’ s family .
__label__1	I ’ ve read in books that pilgrims were used to go to chapel before they went on journeys , to put up petitions for their safe return .
__label__0	My uncle , on the other hand , considered the event of sublime importance .
__label__1	<NAME> ’ t you knock her cap off , or her tooth out , or scratch her , or do something or other to her ? ’ asked <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> was also the first to penetrate to the interior of <NAME> , of which the coast only was previously known .
__label__1	Hoping to hear from you when convenient ‘ I remain ‘ Yours and cetrer ‘ FANNY SQUEERS .
__label__0	`` They will keep them at the hotel . ''
__label__1	You see I know enough to know much more with very little help .
__label__1	The head was covered now .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> , ' said the Jew , trembling ; 'do n't speak so loud ! '
__label__1	The same that I expect . ''
__label__1	‘ But by G -- , sir , there is offence , ’ said the other , interrupting him , ‘ when you intrude yourself upon a couple of gentlemen who are particularly engaged. ’ ‘ I had no intention to offend , ’ said the old man , looking anxiously at the cards .
__label__0	The flora will retreat towards the Equator at the same time as the fauna .
__label__0	“ But I would pay you to wake him. ” The captain had overheard the tenor of the conversation , and interposed sternly , “ Hakkabut !
__label__1	He lived at the last house in Bleeding Heart Yard , and his name was over a little gateway .
__label__1	she added in the same breath , laughing as he laughed .
__label__1	‘ Be mine , be mine ! ’ repeated the old gentleman .
__label__0	`` But the compass , '' I cried , `` without that what can we do ? ''
__label__1	Still , '' returned the gentleman , `` I wish I could say they were not . ''
__label__1	Strictly between ourselves. ’ ‘ Number one , my dear ? ’ said her father , settling her arm comfortably and confidentially .
__label__1	'Indeed I do n't know , sir , ' replied <NAME> .
__label__1	I believe -- at least I know -- that he was not rich .
__label__0	The victory of <NAME> had been very dearly bought .
__label__0	The archæological expedition of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> had been published in succession , and the <NAME> <NAME> was at work upon the publication of its large and magnificent work .
__label__0	`` As you will , <NAME> , '' replied <NAME> .
__label__1	I could not get over this farewell glimpse of them for a long time .
__label__0	Nevertheless , they saw , though unable to get near them , a couple of those large birds peculiar to <NAME> , a sort of cassowary , called emu , five feet in height , and with brown plumage , which belong to the tribe of waders .
__label__0	Despite the cold , they mounted on the forward barricading , and cut off all the wood which was not indispensably necessary to the ship ; then they returned with this new provision .
__label__1	Somewhere must be thought of .
__label__1	At length , not coming out of her distraught state by degrees , but in an instant , <NAME> said , “ Let me see you two play cards ; why have you not begun ? ” With that , we returned to her room , and sat down as before ; I was beggared , as before ; and again , as before , <NAME> watched us all the time , directed my attention to <NAME> 's beauty , and made me notice it the more by trying her jewels on <NAME> 's breast and hair .
__label__1	But if you had gone into the case as I have , if you had only applied yourself to the papers as I did when I was at <NAME> 's , if you only knew what an accumulation of charges and counter-charges , and suspicions and cross-suspicions , they involve , you would think me moderate in comparison . ''
__label__1	‘ What ’ s her name ? ’ inquired <NAME> .
__label__0	HOWEVER , if <NAME> , to avoid giving rise to a violent scene on board , said nothing on the subject of <NAME> , he resolved to have an explanation with <NAME> .
__label__1	Was he coward enough to watch her , an hour afterwards , on the old well staircase , where he had once seen <NAME> in the moonlight , toiling up with <NAME> ?
__label__1	There was a scream as of an individual -- not a rook -- in corporal anguish .
__label__0	At <NAME> , as we have seen , he met his companion , <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> ’ ever , there is law for us women , mis ’ rable creeturs as they ’ d make us , if they could ; and that your master will find out , young man , to his cost , afore he ’ s six months older. ’ At this consolatory reflection , Mrs. <NAME> bridled up , and smiled at Mrs. Sanders , who smiled back again .
__label__0	Some large stones , found at the north of the lake , could be easily transformed into millstones ; and as to the sails , the inexhaustible case of the balloon furnished the necessary material .
__label__0	<NAME> , overcoming her repugnance , looked at all these corpses !
__label__0	The idea of ending one ’ s life in the maw of a savage !
__label__1	<NAME> is the thief of time .
__label__1	I have seen at my mother ’ s -- Mrs Clennam in the city -- a young woman working at her needle , whom I have only heard addressed or spoken of as <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> enough to be hith mother .
__label__1	‘ Why , gentlemen , if I were to indicate such a programme to any class of society , I say it would be received with derision , would be pointed at by the finger of scorn .
__label__1	“ The pleasure of conversing with you , <NAME> , recalls to me , ” pursued the spy , “ that I have the honour of cherishing some interesting associations with your name. ” “ Indeed ! ” said <NAME> , with much indifference .
__label__0	He would listen to nothing , and got up in a very bad temper .
__label__1	Only a miser ; that 's all . '
__label__1	She was busily engaged in the little offices of the table .
__label__1	In town or country , wet or dry , hot or cold , <NAME> suffers .
__label__0	`` Yes , there is an almost all-powerful being , hidden in some part of the island , and whose influence has been singularly useful to our colony .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> see to the drag ven you go downhill .
__label__0	The <NAME> , however , were not discouraged .
__label__1	I knew he always read at that hour , and as I drew near I saw the light shining out into the passage from his reading-lamp .
__label__1	‘ He sleeps sound , ’ he said within himself ; ‘ yet he ’ s that up to me and that noticing of me that my getting out of my chair may wake him , when a rattling peal won ’ t ; let alone my touching of him. ’ He very cautiously rose to his feet .
__label__0	Most of them being however absolutely illiterate , they could not turn their discoveries to scientific account .
__label__1	<NAME> ha ha ! ’ All this time , <NAME> was rubbing his hands , and staring , with ludicrous surprise and dismay , at a great , goggle-eyed , blunt-nosed figure-head of some old ship , which was reared up against the wall in a corner near the stove , looking like a goblin or hideous idol whom the dwarf worshipped .
__label__0	I can hardly say on what I found my convictions .
__label__1	But the old gentleman was not the only person who raised the hue-and-cry .
__label__0	The 18th , the 19th of <NAME> passed without any alteration in the weather .
__label__1	Remember -- eleven o ’ clock. ’ ‘ There is no fear of my forgetting it , sir , ’ replied <NAME> .
__label__0	What he effected in this direction we shall ascertain by following him step by step .
__label__1	The voices in the waves speak low to him of <NAME> , day and night -- plainest when he , his blooming daughter , and her husband , beside them in the evening , or sit at an open window , listening to their roar .
__label__1	They are both tarred with a dirty brush , and I can ’ t have the <NAME> tarred with the same brush .
__label__1	She was an old lady in a large cap , with rather a red nose and rather an unsteady eye , but smiling all over .
__label__1	The pleasanter face which had replaced his , on the occasion of my last visit , answered to our summons , and went before us to the drawing-room .
__label__1	‘ I have the satisfaction to know you are , sir , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	But this I know , -- that we saw the Doctor before he saw us , sitting at his table , among the folio volumes in which he delighted , resting his head calmly on his hand .
__label__0	I began now to lose my head and to scream and cry out in my agony .
__label__1	I ’ ve been looking for you , sir , rather what I may call specially. ’ ‘ You don ’ t say so , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Yes , I do say so , sir .
__label__0	It was a detachment from <NAME> , composed of <NAME> horsemen , a race of the <NAME> type .
__label__0	`` He was to go up with <NAME> and <NAME> .
__label__0	`` It 's useless to argue with a Mississippi steamboat <NAME> , '' ejaculated <NAME> ; `` he never gives in till he blows up ! ''
__label__0	<NAME> silence reigned on board .
__label__1	The <NAME> resented her claiming to know people of such distinction .
__label__1	‘ When he ’ s well he do , ’ she answered .
__label__1	‘ This won ’ t improve with talking about .
__label__1	The great promenade and thoroughfare , as most people know , is <NAME> ; a wide and bustling street , which , from the <NAME> to its opposite termination in a country road , may be four miles long .
__label__0	He caught a glimpse of that mysterious gentleman once or twice ; but <NAME> usually confined himself to the cabin , where he kept <NAME> company , or , according to his inveterate habit , took a hand at whist .
__label__0	Make them understand that we have time to return to the <NAME> before the end of the fine season .
__label__0	Thus ended the vicissitudes of the <NAME> 's journey .
__label__1	`` My dear , '' said I , `` as long as you wo n't hear me out -- '' `` I do n't want to hear you out . ''
__label__0	His will appeared so fixed that <NAME> was forced to consent , and he left him there , having given him at his request various seeds of fruits and vegetables .
__label__0	“ Tobacco ! ” cried <NAME> , who evidently had never seen his favorite plant except in the bowl of his pipe .
__label__0	<NAME> , <NAME> firs , casuarinas , banksias , gum-trees , dragon-trees , and other well-known species , succeeded each other far as the eye could reach .
__label__0	<NAME> , meanwhile , did not remain idle .
__label__0	without the liana ? ” and he wound up by bestowing the name on the young mulatto who , by her affection for the gallant fellow , fully justified its appropriateness .
__label__0	They made a good start .
__label__0	“ Because it is too small and too dark. ” “ Couldn ’ t we enlarge it , hollow it out , make openings to let in light and air ? ” replied <NAME> , who now thought nothing impossible .
__label__0	The name of <NAME> <NAME> was at that time well known .
__label__0	Other astronomers have seen in these inexplicable rays a kind of moraines , rows of erratic blocks , which had been thrown up at the period of <NAME> 's formation .
__label__1	The fact is , the girl was washing the glasses .
__label__1	‘ I don ’ t know. ’ ‘ Any intelligence of him ? ’ asks the Major .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> ! ’ said <NAME> in her voice of warning , ‘ Ma ’ s chair ! ’ Mr <NAME> flew to the excellent lady ’ s back , and followed her up close chair in hand , as she stalked to the banquet .
__label__1	I can ’ t say more than that for ‘ em. ’ ‘ I ’ ll take this man myself , sir , ’ said Mr Inspector to <NAME> .
__label__0	The dazzling glitter did not deceive _him_ .
__label__0	Do you not think , <NAME> , that that is a sufficient motive for a ship , finding herself unexpectedly in sight of new land , to try and visit rather than avoid it ? ''
__label__0	The inhabitants of this island , who as a rule wear scarce any clothing , are tall and well-made , and the women , who wear leathern great-coats reaching to the ground , are very good-looking and honest .
__label__1	But it was much more hard to be compelled to doubt either her father or <NAME> , so affectionate and dear to her , and to think of her love for each of them , by turns , with fear , distrust , and wonder .
__label__1	'So it is , ' acquiesced the undertaker .
__label__1	This did not serve him ; for , at such bantering or retort as suited the company , he was no match for <NAME> .
__label__0	`` My dear <NAME> , I thought you would be the first to cry out against this mad enterprise . ''
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> rejoined him , and they observed with terror that this rumbling , which awakened their companions , came from beneath them .
__label__1	said <NAME> when they had returned .
__label__1	The spy , who was pale , turned paler , and asked him how he dared -- “ I 'll tell you , ” said <NAME> .
__label__1	No one knows how ‘ tis .
__label__1	So that 's disposed of , and we will talk of something else . ''
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> ’ s heart was really too full to bear it , and he went upstairs to bed .
__label__1	As I think the circumstances back , I hear the rain splashing on the stone pavement of the passage , which was not under cover .
__label__1	In some old time -- for even change was old in that old place -- a wooden partition had been constructed in one part of the chamber to form a sleeping-closet , into which the light was admitted at the same period by a rude window , or rather niche , cut in the solid wall .
__label__1	It is not usual to cancel articles for any such reason .
__label__0	As he uttered these words , I felt myself seized on the other side by the firm hand of our devoted guide .
__label__1	Agents were sent in quest of him , in all directions ; every stratagem that could be invented was resorted to , for the purpose of discovering his place of retreat ; but it was all in vain .
__label__1	‘ Never mind , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , with dignity .
__label__0	The silence of night was only interrupted by the cries of the “ morepork ” in the minor key , like the mournful cuckoos of <NAME> .
__label__1	At intervals , along the town , and even a little way out upon the road , I saw more : but at length only the bleak night and the open country were around me , and the ashes of my youthful friendship .
__label__0	This individual said , in a rough and hardly intelligible voice , -- `` <NAME> , I have to make a proposal to you . ''
__label__0	In spite of all the learned theories of <NAME> , a fierce and vehement fire certainly burned within the entrails of the great spheroid .
__label__0	`` I have found it , my friend , I have found it ! ''
__label__0	<NAME> and <NAME> were embarked in different boats .
__label__1	‘ Where are you , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ Here , sir , ’ replied <NAME> .
__label__1	He came of rich people down in <NAME> , who had nursed this combination of qualities until they made the discovery that it was just of age and a blockhead .
__label__0	During the first day 's voyage , the admiral -- the title by which he is usually known in the various accounts of his exploits -- bearing directly southwards , sailed forty-five miles before sunset ; turning then to the south-east , he steered for the Canaries , in order to repair the <NAME> , which had unshipped her rudder , an accident caused perhaps by the ill-will of the steersman , who dreaded the voyage .
__label__1	Throughout , I had seemed to myself to attend more to the wind and the rain than to him ; even now , I could not separate his voice from those voices , though those were loud and his was silent .
__label__0	`` Well , here are learned men having to learn , '' said the <NAME> .
__label__0	But when he perceived that , not content with the old domain , you seemed to think of encroaching upon his , then indeed his anger burst forth .
__label__0	The bomb was <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> , fact , fact , everywhere in the material aspect of the town ; fact , fact , fact , everywhere in the immaterial .
__label__1	You have n't got no occasion to be up to it .
__label__0	Taking these two typical maps as our starting-point , we shall be able to judge of the magnitude of the discoveries of modern times .
__label__0	`` What are we looking at , at this moment ? ''
__label__0	“ But that is no reason why we should despair , ” said <NAME> , “ still less why we should give up our search. ” “ Will it be necessary , ” exclaimed <NAME> , “ to search the river throughout its breadth and its length ? ” “ Throughout its breadth , perhaps , ” answered <NAME> , “ throughout its length , no -- fortunately. ” “ And why ? ” asked <NAME> .
__label__1	Then he drew his feet together , and made a low , grave bow , and then put out his left hand .
__label__1	Its steeples and towers and its one great dome grow more ethereal ; its smoky house-tops lose their grossness in the pale effulgence ; the noises that arise from the streets are fewer and are softened , and the footsteps on the pavements pass more tranquilly away .
__label__0	At first their empire was limited to the neighbourhood of <NAME> , but under their successors it rapidly increased , and extended from the Tropic of <NAME> to the <NAME> , a length of thirty degrees .
__label__0	It is somewhat circular in shape , and it covers a space of about 300 thousand square miles .
__label__0	The various soils and the crops suited to them ; industrial pursuits ; the breeding of cattle ; farming economy ; manufactures ; foreign trade ; means of communication ; government ; -- all these subjects are treated comprehensively on the authority of documents then newly compiled , and with an ability that could scarcely have been expected from a man who had not given special attention to questions of this nature .
__label__1	Hosts of stars are visible to-night , though their brilliancy is eclipsed by the splendour of the moon .
__label__1	Regarding that as done , is there nothing I can do for you yourself ? ” “ Nothing .
__label__1	The yard was so dark that even <NAME> , who knew its every stone , was fain to grope with his hands .
__label__1	An ’ t that as nat ’ ral as a sheep ’ s bleating , or a pig ’ s grunting , or a horse ’ s neighing , or a bird ’ s singing ?
__label__1	I shall never be an old man ; and if your hand placed me in the grave , and I could think , before I died , that you would come and look upon it sometimes with one of your kind smiles , and in the summer weather , when everything was alive -- not dead like me -- I could go to that home almost without a tear. ’ ‘ Why do you talk thus , poor boy , if your life is a happy one with me ? ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	( Cries of “ Order , ” “ Chair , ” “ Yes , ” “ No , ” “ Go on , ” “ Leave off , ” etc . )
__label__1	<NAME> and his mother knows where to find it , and we find it sitiwated correct. ’ With this mysterious speech , Mr Chivery took his ear away and shut the door .
__label__0	The command was offered to him , and although he might have passed the remainder of his days in peace at his post in the <NAME> , in the full enjoyment of the honour and glory he had gained by his two voyages round the world , he did not hesitate for a moment .
__label__1	Is he a large man , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ I should call him a large man , my dear , ’ the old lady replied after some hesitation , ‘ but that his voice is so much larger. ’ ‘ Than himself ? ’ ‘ Than anybody. ’ ‘ Hah ! ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> word , my dear sir , very harsh word indeed .
__label__0	Into these forests , twenty men penetrated for more than six miles and only returned to the shore from the fear of losing themselves .
__label__0	It was impossible to stand upright in the interior of the <NAME> .
__label__1	I should like to see it .
__label__0	“ Most likely you are right , ” replied the count ; “ and so far from dreading a failure of the internal heat , I am not quite sure that we may not be exposed to a more terrible calamity still ? ” “ What ? ” asked <NAME> .
__label__0	As to the forest , including <NAME> , as well as the forests of the <NAME> , it extended as far as the eye could reach .
__label__1	‘ Here we are , a breakfasting you see ! ’ <NAME> did <NAME> see that anybody was breakfasting , except <NAME> ; but he bowed with all becoming reverence , and looked as cheerful as he could .
__label__1	`` I am very sorry both to hear it and to see it , <NAME> . ''
__label__1	‘ Why , he ’ s pretty well , thank ’ ee , I suppose. ’ ‘ You ’ re not out of place , <NAME> ? ’ said <NAME> , in a wheedling tone .
__label__1	`` Because he ai n't well , I think , mother , '' adds <NAME> .
__label__0	All the greater reason why he should get out of the scrape by depending only on himself .
__label__1	If your daughter is disposed to try after the situation , I ’ ll take her there directly. ’ ‘ Have you nothing to say to your uncle , my love ? ’ inquired Mrs. Nickleby .
__label__1	'You will not stop my going because I have trusted in your goodness , and forced no promise from you , as I might have done . '
__label__1	‘ “ Now then ! ” said a voice , as my uncle felt a hand on his shoulder , “ you ’ re booked for one inside .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> ’ t talk to me , you aggravating thing , don ’ t ! ’ said Mrs. Nupkins .
__label__1	He flies on these occasions like an angel or a bird .
__label__0	Had we been alone , I should ere now have cried , ‘ My friends , let us make an effort .
__label__1	‘ A little , <NAME> , ’ replied that gentleman .
__label__1	`` What is the matter with you now ? ''
__label__1	‘ Is it not likely that it should be ?
__label__1	You are going to see your nurse , I suppose ? ’ ‘ Why , yes , ’ I said , ‘ I must see <NAME> first of all. ’ ‘ Well , ’ replied <NAME> , looking at his watch .
__label__0	They were anxious to reach <NAME> to eat and sleep , and if the bridge had been constructed , in a quarter of an hour they would have been at home .
__label__0	The engineer seized the wire and found that it disappeared beneath the waves .
__label__1	In a corner below the mangle , on a couple of stools , sat two very little children : a boy and a girl ; and when the very long boy , in an interval of staring , took a turn at the mangle , it was alarming to see how it lunged itself at those two innocents , like a catapult designed for their destruction , harmlessly retiring when within an inch of their heads .
__label__1	‘ Oh the joy of -- ’ ‘ Be rational , sir , pray , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	May be a humble one !
__label__1	We left it with no little regret on the evening of Friday the 11th , and travelled that night by railroad to <NAME> .
__label__0	You wear better than I do , my old friend ! ” “ And , sir , you shall be our viewer again .
__label__0	It was also rumored that the principal chief of the rebellion , <NAME> , was inclined to surrender , but the <NAME> papers have not confirmed this , but rather the contrary , and I should not be surprised to find that at this moment the war is going on with renewed vigor. ” “ Then , according to you , <NAME> , ” said <NAME> , “ this struggle is still going on in the provinces of <NAME> and <NAME> ? ” “ I think so. ” “ This very province where the <NAME> ’ S wreck has deposited us. ” “ Exactly .
__label__0	<NAME> made no reply , but went out and returned a few minutes later with a raw steak , seasoned with pepper and salt , in the <NAME> style .
__label__1	Am I blind to that boy ’ s defects ?
__label__0	<NAME> made no immediate reply .
__label__0	`` Not in the very least . ''
__label__1	There was a back-garret window with rusty bars outside , which had no shutter ; and out of this , <NAME> often gazed with a melancholy face for hours together ; but nothing was to be descried from it but a confused and crowded mass of housetops , blackened chimneys , and gable-ends .
__label__1	‘ So I think , <NAME> , when they come to me .
__label__1	I should be more disposed to quarrel with myself even then , than with poor <NAME> , for I brought you together .
__label__0	A malignant fever does not declare itself spontaneously ; its germ must previously have existed. ” “ I am not mistaken , ” replied the reporter .
__label__0	Before leaving the <NAME> , however , the naturalist , <NAME> , planted its destitute shores with several sorts of vegetables , which he thought likely to be of service to future voyagers who might be detained there .
__label__0	But I must have some one to help me .
__label__1	For , a rush from scanty feeding to generous feeding , and from what you may call messing to what you may call method , do require a power of constitution which is not often found in youth , particular when undermined by boarding-school ! ’ It will be seen that the <NAME> now openly pitted herself against <NAME> , as one whom she had fully ascertained to be her natural enemy .
__label__1	There was a third , <NAME> , who I fancied would sing it .
__label__0	I sent them off by hundreds .
__label__0	The <NAME> of <NAME> , and the <NAME> of <NAME> , were now exciting the desires of King Emmanuel , who had already been surnamed `` the fortunate . ''
__label__1	<NAME> tears stood in its eyes , and stained the blotched red of its cheeks .
__label__0	At length one night in October , 1864 , he managed to escape the vigilance of the natives , and took refuge in the depths of immense forests .
__label__1	‘ Are you not coming , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ <NAME> , I will remain here .
__label__0	The conjuror was congratulated on his skill , and a knife was given to him as a token of gratitude .
__label__1	`` And not being the richer for trusting in a rotten reed , '' said my guardian , laying his hand emphatically on the sleeve of <NAME> 's dressing-gown , `` be you very careful not to encourage him in that reliance , <NAME> . ''
__label__1	‘ Sad experience , you know , brother-in-law. -- Kate , my dear , put that down in the next letter to <NAME> , or remind me to do it if I write. ’ <NAME> paused for a few moments , and seeing that he had now made pretty sure of the mother , in case the daughter objected to his proposition , went on to say : ‘ The situation that I have made interest to procure , ma ’ am , is with -- with a milliner and dressmaker , in short. ’ ‘ A milliner ! ’ cried Mrs. Nickleby .
__label__1	‘ Former pastrycook and Muffin-maker , much respected ; ’ introducing gravestone .
__label__1	Nor am I , believe me , so arrogant as to suppose that in five and twenty years there have been no changes in me , and that I had nothing to learn and no extreme impressions to correct when I was here first .
__label__1	We do not appear to understand each other yet .
__label__1	And notwithstanding various blandishments on the part of <NAME> , <NAME> still said no , and said it too with such determined and resolute ill-temper , that <NAME> was clearly taken aback .
__label__1	I deplored the untimely death of <NAME> , most sincerely , and shed tears in doing so .
__label__1	Not that <NAME> care for such society , you know !
__label__1	A sedan chair was kept inside the railing before the <NAME> ’ s <NAME> , but it had never come out within the memory of man ; and on fine mornings , the top of every rail ( there were eight-and-forty , as <NAME> had often counted ) was decorated with a pewter-pot .
__label__0	These savages had poisoned arrows , the poison being contained in the tip ; amongst them was a woman whom all the others obeyed , bowing before her .
__label__1	Oh dear , how very kind of you !
__label__1	Occasionally , the old agony comes back : a very little thing will revive it ; even a familiar sound , or the scent of summer flowers in the air ; but it does not last long , now : for the world without , has come to be the vision , and this solitary life , the sad reality .
__label__1	Let us set out in quest of adventures , and look for a furnished lodging .
__label__0	When <NAME> learned his share of the responsibility of this incident , he was not much disconcerted .
__label__0	Two , out of the eight men who manned her , were mortally wounded by <NAME> and <NAME> , and the boat herself , carried irresistibly onto the reefs , was stove in at the mouth of the <NAME> .
__label__0	The last day they passed carousing ; they ravaged and stole everything , and it was during this drunkenness that <NAME> and two or three others set fire to the ship .
__label__1	‘ And nobody , ’ pursued <NAME> in the same tone , ‘ will hear , on any account whatever , of bringing it out. ’ <NAME> looked reflective , and nodded her head slowly ; as who should say , ‘ Such things are , and why are they ! ’ ‘ Now , you know , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ _I_ couldn ’ t write a play. ’ ‘ Not a bad one , sir ? ’ said <NAME> , innocently , with her eyebrows again in action .
__label__0	We say `` probably , '' for the towns of <NAME> and <NAME> dispute with <NAME> and <NAME> , the honour of having given him birth .
__label__0	But the chairman was unknown !
__label__1	`` He come in at the door , '' said the old man , slowly pointing an imaginary track along the shop , `` on the day he did it -- the whole neighbourhood had said for months before that he would do it , of a certainty sooner or later -- he come in at the door that day , and walked along there , and sat himself on a bench that stood there , and asked me ( you 'll judge I was a mortal sight younger then ) to fetch him a pint of wine .
__label__1	‘ Is it Justice with the bandage off her eyes , and without the sword and scales ?
__label__1	<NAME> YOU off now , father ? ''
__label__0	As soon as the tree is cut down , the pith is extracted , which is then grated , passed through a sieve , and afterwards cut up in the form of small rolls , which are dried in the shade .
__label__1	The procession up the aisle was beautiful .
__label__1	Mr <NAME> arrived more than an hour ago , and told us you were walking down. ’ His own hand shook , as he accepted a rose or two from hers and thanked her .
__label__1	How dare you look me in the face and do it , sir ? ’ ‘ Well , <NAME> , if you come to that , ’ responded <NAME> , ‘ how dare you look me in the face , and call me a serpent , sir ? ’ ‘ Because you are one , ’ replied <NAME> .
__label__0	On the ninth day after leaving <NAME> , <NAME> had traversed exactly one half of the terrestrial globe .
__label__0	“ In a moment , ” said <NAME> .
__label__0	“ You were there ? ” at last she uttered .
__label__0	It was not without careful search that <NAME> managed to discover this tarantass , and there was probably not a second to be found in all Perm .
__label__0	Their speeches were not so long , and they did not declaim so vehemently .
__label__1	They found it surging and tossing , in quest of <NAME> himself .
__label__1	‘ I am the brother of the young lady who has been the subject of conversation here , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__0	The mouth of the cave was guarded by one ferocious monster , the interior was inhabited by something too hideous to contemplate .
__label__1	`` Why , there 's not much air to be got here ; and what there is , is not very freshening , '' Weevle answers , glancing up and down the court .
__label__0	I am cold , and I imagine that it is -- '' `` What , <NAME> ? ''
__label__1	replied <NAME> eagerly ; 'but I was thinking that I am ungrateful now . '
__label__1	After an hour or so of this travelling , we came to a rough wooden hut and a landing-place .
__label__1	I never thought of it , before or afterwards .
__label__1	I should like a drink , ’ said <NAME> ; but without appearing to attend much .
__label__0	It was but a gleam , but what an indescribable effect !
__label__0	The cavern , however , was quite capable of being lighted by means of lamps and lanterns .
__label__0	We shall run no danger of an explosion ; and it is necessary that our powder should take fire instantaneously in order that its mechanical effect may be complete . ''
__label__1	This young man , besides having a great deal to say for himself about <NAME> and a project of his for teaching the coffee colonists to teach the natives to turn piano-forte legs and establish an export trade , delighted in drawing Mrs. Jellyby out by saying , `` I believe now , Mrs. Jellyby , you have received as many as from one hundred and fifty to two hundred letters respecting <NAME> in a single day , have you not ? ''
__label__0	What human being would ever have conceived the idea of such a journey ?
__label__1	At the doors and windows some men and women lounged or prowled about , and took little notice of us except to laugh to one another or to say something as we passed about gentlefolks minding their own business and not troubling their heads and muddying their shoes with coming to look after other people 's .
__label__1	‘ My pa -- <NAME> -- he ’ s stopping here .
__label__1	`` I go there at other times , '' said <NAME> , `` but <NAME> does not come then .
__label__1	And you hear the people who are alive , crying , and working , and calling to one another down in the close dark streets , and you seem to pity them so !
__label__1	“ Says <NAME> : 'Why , you fool , do n't you know she 's got a living body ?
__label__1	‘ Is there anything else you wish to say to me , dear father ? ’ ‘ No , no .
__label__0	He deducted , however , from <NAME> 's share the cost of the gas which had burned in his room for nineteen hundred and twenty hours , for the sake of regularity .
__label__1	But as it is , I made up my mind to call , especially as I am not likely to see you again the next time you come to town . ''
__label__0	It was therefore lower in temperature than the preceding winter .
__label__0	“ No , my boy , ” replied the latter , “ we are going to proceed differently , but in as precise a way. ” <NAME> , wishing to learn everything he could , followed the engineer to the beach .
__label__1	“ Early in the morning , the rouleau of gold was left at my door in a little box , with my name on the outside .
__label__1	inquired the doctor ; who had returned to the room shortly after the commencement of the story .
__label__0	Preserved meat , ale , brandy -- all were in abundance ; consequently , as the men expressed it , they were in this respect “ all right. ” Of course , the physical changes that had taken place had attracted the notice both of officers and men .
__label__0	A quantity of dry leaves , mixed with sulphur , he lit with a spark from his flint , and he began to smoke out the bees .
__label__1	There was a cut upon his forehead , and they had been wetting his hair , which lay bedabbled and entangled on the pillow .
__label__1	There was one black , gloomy mass that seemed to follow him : not hurrying in the wild chase with the others , but lingering sullenly behind , and gliding darkly and stealthily on .
__label__1	' I do n't know ; I really do n't know , ' said <NAME> , with a rueful countenance .
__label__1	‘ It is my duty to find out why she made that stipulation .
__label__0	And in addition to these , there were large deposits of nitrate of soda and iron pyrites , such as were required for the manufacture of the meli-melonite .
__label__1	It was tremendous. ’ ‘ I always suffer for these triumphs afterwards , ’ said Mrs. Wititterly .
__label__0	It was a vast , four-sided room , thirty feet long , eighteen wide , and fifteen high .
__label__0	Suddenly the projectile passed the line of demarcation between intense light and absolute darkness , and was plunged in profound night !
__label__1	I remarked that my mother , though she smiled when <NAME> looked at her , became more serious and thoughtful .
__label__1	And this I will do and cause to be done , not in mere love and thankfulness , but because I regard it as an act of plain justice and honour. ’ I said these words with the greatest earnestness that I could lay upon them , and I repeat them in print here with equal earnestness .
__label__0	`` I know it ; when placed under the pressure of seven hundred and ten atmospheres , '' cried my uncle with imperturbable gravity .
__label__1	`` Do n't shake your head , '' said <NAME> .
__label__0	It is asserted that these natives are cannibals ; but if that is true -- and it is said of many of the riverine tribes -- there must have been more evidence for the cannibalism than we get to-day .
__label__1	“ I do not even know , ” said I , speaking low as he took his seat at the table , “ by what name to call you .
__label__1	Between these two irreconcilable conclusions : the one , that what I felt was general and unavoidable ; the other , that it was particular to me , and might have been different : I balanced curiously , with no distinct sense of their opposition to each other .
__label__0	All cases of the <NAME> ?
__label__0	<NAME> Harding then thought of exploring in the half-light the large circular layer which supported the upper cone of the mountain .
__label__1	That 's the time of day .
__label__0	And one day , on the 22nd November , they found themselves in conference at the <NAME> , in the rooms of <NAME> and <NAME> , the meeting being due to the diplomatic efforts of <NAME> .
__label__0	Once there , he would have no trouble , so he thought , in finding the cottage , built , as we have said , at the extremity of the principal passage .
__label__1	It is a similar certificate , enabling him and his daughter and her child , at any time , to pass the barrier and the frontier !
__label__1	<NAME> , who could hardly stand , made a shift to raise himself on his feet , and was at once lugged along the streets by the jacket-collar , at a rapid pace .
__label__0	<NAME> explained to her how it was that the honest and courageous <NAME> was arrested as a robber .
__label__1	To the <NAME> Road we went and there inquired at Mrs. <NAME> 's residence for Mrs. Guppy .
__label__1	‘ Now , young man , ’ said the porter .
__label__1	<NAME> , in the form of odds and ends of cold cream and pomatum , and also of hairpins , was freely distributed among the attendants .
__label__0	We must calculate on several weeks delay , and if our vessel is ready by next November we may think ourselves very lucky. ” “ Well , ” replied <NAME> , “ that will be exactly the most favorable time for undertaking a voyage of any importance , either to <NAME> or to a more distant land. ” “ So it will , captain , ” answered the sailor .
__label__0	“ <NAME> to me , friends , ” said <NAME> after a few minutes ’ reflection ; “ and remember , <NAME> , this is a grave discussion .
__label__0	The unfortunate <NAME> had caught hold of the cord of the loaded gun .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> was firm ; nobody in his world was to be so firm as <NAME> ; nobody else in his world was to be firm at all , for everybody was to be bent to his firmness .
__label__0	<NAME> maintained it was the parabolic ; M'Nicholl insisted that it was the hyperbolic .
__label__1	This dangerous ground in his steeple-chase towards manhood passed , he still found it very rough riding , and was grievously beset by all the obstacles in his course .
__label__0	From <NAME> to Forty-Seven Minutes Past Ten P. M. II .
__label__1	What ’ s your motive in this ? ’ ‘ <NAME> take the man ! ’ exclaimed my aunt .
__label__1	But if he had looked at me for an hour or for a day , I could not have remembered his face ever afterwards , as having been more attentive .
__label__0	<NAME> , entrusted with carrying them their daily nourishment , leavings from the kitchen , etc. , acquitted himself conscientiously of his task .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> him -- ’ ‘ What ? ’ ‘ Such dreadful words , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	How are you gettin ’ on , and how is the chandlery bis ’ ness likely to do ?
__label__1	In this family we are all children , and I am the youngest . ''
__label__1	He still sat silent , when <NAME> mildly said : ‘ <NAME> , you will not distrust me one day , when you know me better. ’ ‘ It goes against me , ’ <NAME> answered , in a gentler manner , ‘ to mistrust any one ; but when I am so mistrusted—when we all are—I can not keep such things quite out of my mind .
__label__1	To come to tea here for ever ?
__label__0	They were in some danger in crossing the bar , but that was their last .
__label__0	His cheques were regularly paid at sight from his account current , which was always flush .
__label__1	‘ There never was a happier one ! ’ I exclaimed , laying down the carving-knife and fork .
__label__1	`` <NAME> , <NAME> , I 'm sorry to see you like this .
__label__1	It is a pleasant thing to reflect that one did one ’ s duty by him. ’ <NAME> smiled , as if he meant anything but smiling , and looked round at the strangers present .
__label__0	“ Then , if my memory serves me right , we must be eighty miles from it , for the peak of <NAME> , seven thousand feet high , is visible at that distance. ” “ That ’ s it , precisely. ” Some hours later , the sharp , lofty crags of the group of islands stood out clearly on the horizon .
__label__1	For , they are headlong , mad , and dangerous ; and in the years so long after the breaking of the cask at <NAME> 's wine-shop door , they are not easily purified when once stained red .
__label__1	They look very , very like that sort of thing .
__label__1	In any of the burial-places of this city through which I pass , is there a sleeper more inscrutable than its busy inhabitants are , in their innermost personality , to me , or than I am to them ?
__label__1	But perhaps my brother ’ s penetration may enable him to have some insight into his character .
__label__0	These tardy questions of <NAME> 's respecting his brother were put , I had no doubt whatsoever , at the instigation of <NAME> , but what was his motive , and was it at the Falklands that he had discovered the secret of <NAME> ?
__label__0	I invited some of the principal personages on board my frigate , and loaded them with presents ; and the very men I distinguished in this manner did not scruple to steal a nail or an old pair of trousers .
__label__0	However , they waited till the first boat was within range , when two well-directed balls threw its crew into disorder .
__label__0	`` The valves are not sufficiently charged ! ''
__label__1	One day he came up to the office , all in a hurry , and had a private interview with the magistrate , who , after a deal of talk , rings the bell , and orders <NAME> in ( <NAME> was a active officer ) , and tells him to go and assist <NAME> in apprehending the man as robbed his house .
__label__0	Since it was your intention to live alone , why did you throw into the sea the document which put us on your track ? ” “ A document ? ” repeated <NAME> , who did not appear to know what he meant .
__label__0	<NAME> , he recognized <NAME> , the sister of the man who was no longer <NAME> , but <NAME> , Courier of the Czar .
__label__0	There remained no doubt of the intentions of the natives .
__label__1	' I did n't know , my dear , I did n't know , ' replied <NAME> , humbly ; for the Jew was the new comer .
__label__0	You would not go down , on the steeples , '' said the unknown , with a chuckle .
__label__1	The country round this town being very flat , is bare of scenic interest ; but the town itself is full of life and motion , bustle , business , and improvement .
__label__0	It is true his profession of the <NAME> faith had prevented him from taking astronomical observations , and from making sketches and notes freely , but only at the price of his seeming apostasy could he have passed through the region where the very name of a <NAME> is held in abhorrence .
__label__0	<NAME> resounded , and the echo was repeated again and again till it died away in the dark naves .
__label__0	`` The same revolution , brought about by the same means , takes place in the lives of the women and wretched girls .
__label__0	After the audience was over the travellers proceeded to look round the village , where they were astonished to find two immense walls made of coral , some blocks of which were of immense size and weight .
__label__1	The unwholesome air is so stained with this liquor that even the green eyes of the cat upon her shelf , as they open and shut and glimmer on the visitors , look drunk .
__label__0	The command of the first was entrusted to <NAME> afterwards so justly celebrated , with whom were associated Dr. <NAME> , <NAME> , then a midshipman in the royal navy , and two common seamen .
__label__0	-- '' Insufficient , '' continued <NAME> , laying down the law , `` we shall rest forever motionless on the dead point of the mutually neutralizing attractions . ''
__label__1	If you knew how often I have tried to speak to you to-day , you would almost pity me .
__label__0	It is only two leagues wide , and is divided in its narrowest part from the mainland by a channel of two hundred fathoms .
__label__0	It is to take <NAME> , the capital of the eastern provinces , and with it a hostage , the possession of whom is worth a whole country .
__label__0	He was carried to the sledge and placed there as comfortably as possible ; the dogs , including <NAME> , were harnessed in ; the travellers cast one last glance at the spot where the <NAME> had lain .
__label__0	I want to look upon the works of the Almighty. ’ ” “ I shall soon say so , <NAME> , I hope , ” replied the girl ; “ I shall soon go with you to the world above ; and yet -- ” “ What are you going to say , <NAME> ? ” hastily cried <NAME> ; “ can you possibly regret having quitted that gloomy abyss in which you spent your early years , and whence we drew you half dead ? ” “ No , <NAME> , ” answered <NAME> ; “ I was only thinking that darkness is beautiful as well as light .
__label__1	But , while returning among those lanes of light , <NAME> becomes so very uncertain , both of foot and speech , that he half drops , half throws himself down , by one of the heavy pillars , scarcely less heavy than itself , and indistinctly appeals to his companion for forty winks of a second each .
__label__1	Good-night. ’ Again he turned towards the wicket , where the satellite , with his eye upon his chief , remained a dumb statue .
__label__0	then the gentleman is going on terra firma ? ''
__label__0	Whatever might be her moral energy , her physical strength would soon fail her .
__label__0	Thus badgered , he secluded himself more than ever in his dismal hole , never venturing , except when absolutely obliged , to face the other members of the community .
__label__1	It was a very genteel entertainment , very handsomely served .
__label__1	In satisfying himself , however , Mr <NAME> was not regardless of the younger branches about him , who , although they had made their own evening repast , were on the look-out for irregular morsels , as possessing a relish .
__label__1	His advice , energy , activity , money , credit , all his resources whatsoever , were all made useless .
__label__0	We do not imagine that any navigator had hitherto displayed such perseverance .
__label__0	The president attempted to speak , but could not .
__label__0	On the 16th of January , the <NAME> seemed becalmed only a few yards beneath the surface of the waves .
__label__1	This attack , my dear Mortimer ; this murder -- ’ His friend leaned over him with renewed attention , saying : ‘ You and I suspect some one. ’ ‘ More than suspect .
__label__0	`` O , you need n't be vain of it !
__label__0	According to him they do not belong to the same race as those of <NAME> , but resemble rather the <NAME> , the nearest of whom are those of <NAME> , seven hundred miles away .
__label__0	“ In 1741 , at the time of the expedition of the two Frenchmen , <NAME> and <NAME> , who were sent to measure a terrestrial degree on the equator , they were accompanied by a very distinguished astronomer , <NAME> des <NAME> .
__label__1	With a twitch -- not of her head merely , this time , but of her whole self -- the <NAME> went on tiptoe to Mr <NAME> ’ s door , and knocked .
__label__0	His servant , <NAME> , who had now joined him , tried in vain to be all things at once .
__label__1	As to his liver , ’ said the <NAME> resignedly , ‘ that , of course , he gave up altogether , when he first went out ! ’ ‘ Does he say all this ? ’ asked <NAME> .
__label__0	For himself , not content with all that he had done hitherto , and wishing to execute the mission which death had prevented <NAME> from accomplishing , he went into <NAME> , where the `` negus '' or king , known by the name of Prester <NAME> , flattered by seeing his alliance sought by one of the most powerful sovereigns of <NAME> , received him with the greatest kindness , and gave him a high position at his court , but to make sure of retaining his services , he constantly refused him permission to leave the country .
__label__0	“ No , ” replied <NAME> , “ since he has webbed feet , and is almost an amphibious animal .
__label__1	One thousand , four hundred and seventy-five pounds , four shillings , and threepence , tomorrow at twelve o ’ clock .
__label__1	‘ The unities of the drama , before everything. ’ ‘ Might I ask you , ’ said <NAME> , hesitating between the respect he ought to assume , and his love of the whimsical , ‘ might I ask you what the unities are ? ’ <NAME> coughed and considered .
__label__1	<NAME> , for this poor place she showed an increasing love ; and to sit in it alone became her favourite rest .
__label__1	A long silence ensued ; during which the Jew was plunged in deep thought , with his face wrinkled into an expression of villainy perfectly demoniacal .
__label__1	'Good boy , <NAME> -- well done -- ' he mumbled .
__label__0	At any rate , for humanity 's sake alone , it would be right to wait .
__label__0	<NAME> was buried with great pomp .
__label__0	de <NAME> , de <NAME> , and Boutevilliers , were sent to examine it .
__label__0	Really , the whale itself ca n't be far off . ''
__label__1	You know that at length I gave it up , and declined to guess any more .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> went himself to cut from the trunk of a species of black willow , a few pieces of bark ; he brought them back to <NAME> , and reduced them to a powder , which was administered that same evening to <NAME> .
__label__0	And if there is coal on the surface , is it not reasonable to suppose that there is coal underneath ? ” The Major was right .
__label__1	‘ You have been used to eaves-dropping .
__label__0	`` I 've known all my men for a long time . ''
__label__0	`` This island , '' says the traveller in his narrative , `` was once much larger , for according to the map of the world that the pilots of these seas carry , it was once 3600 miles in circumference but the north wind blows with such force in these parts that it caused a part of the island to be submerged . ''
__label__1	‘ Is that all ? ’ ‘ Theer ’ s yet a something else , ’ he returned , ‘ if I can say it , <NAME> ’ r Davy. ’ We walked on , farther than we had walked yet , before he spoke again .
__label__1	The old gentleman is newly shaken up by <NAME> to bear his part in the conversation .
__label__1	What ARE you a doing of this afternoon , <NAME> ! ” Mrs. <NAME> received her property , at first with a look of unutterable surprise as if she had never seen it before , and then with a laugh of recognition , and said , “ Thank you , <NAME> , ” and forgot me , and went on reading .
__label__1	I had no idea how he employed his time in the interval , beyond a general knowledge that he was very popular in the place , and had twenty means of actively diverting himself where another man might not have found one .
__label__1	So much the more weight shall I attach to the pledge I require from you , when it is unreservedly given. ’ The young man twice or thrice essayed to speak , but failed .
__label__1	In her furred travelling-dress , <NAME> seemed more delicately beautiful than she had ever seemed yet , even in my eyes .
__label__0	At the same time they had got an animal of whom a naturalist would have made more than did the cook .
__label__1	You shall see the whole case clear , from first to last . ''
__label__1	`` A fog , miss , '' said the young gentleman .
__label__1	The general action of a man so engaged -- pausing to look over a bundle of papers in his hand , dealing them round in various portions , taking up another bundle and examining its contents with knitted brows and pursed-out lips -- dealing , and sorting , and pondering by turns -- would easily suggest some whimsical resemblance to a player at cards .
__label__0	The hydrogen passed into a huge central cask , after having been washed on the way , and thence into each balloon by the conduit-pipes .
__label__1	Lastly , the fastidious lady , finding there was a solitary gentleman inside , had a small lamp lighted which she carried in reticule , and being after much trouble shut in , the horses were put into a brisk canter and the coach was once more in rapid motion .
__label__1	Still I cried very much , not only in the fullness of my heart after reading the letter , not only in the strangeness of the prospect -- for it was strange though I had expected the contents -- but as if something for which there was no name or distinct idea were indefinitely lost to me .
__label__1	Whenever it came back , the eyes of all on board , brightened and sparkled like itself : and there we all stood , watching this revolving light upon the rock at <NAME> , and praising it for its brightness and its friendly warning , and lauding it , in short , above all other signal lights that ever were displayed , until it once more glimmered faintly in the distance , far behind us .
__label__0	But while doing so , the friends were astonished to find that the birds , though good sized creatures , and now pretty fat and plump , hardly felt heavier in their hands than if they had been so many sparrows .
__label__0	<NAME> , taking off his hat , made a profound bow to both of his companions , without saying a word .
__label__0	He learned <NAME> ’ s adventures , and through what various trials the colonists had passed .
__label__1	Yes , <NAME> , ' says you , ” here <NAME> shook his head and hand at me , “ 'he knows my total deficiency of common human gratitoode .
__label__0	You are good citizens , quiet and peaceable !
__label__0	He only waited to conclude a treaty of alliance with them , before continuing his voyage southward .
__label__0	The animal gave a terrible cry , but went on faster than ever .
__label__0	You seem to have quite a monopoly of them. ” “ What ! ” said <NAME> , pricking up his ear .
__label__0	`` So , <NAME> , it is not the first time you have overrun the <NAME> on board the <NAME> ? ''
__label__1	Why not , when you can have one so devoted to you !
__label__1	If I live , you ’ ll find me out. ’ ‘ I shall find out that my husband has a mine of purpose and energy , and will turn it to the best account ? ’ ‘ I hope so , dearest <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , wistfully , and yet somewhat whimsically .
__label__0	The latter , however , was a very slow sailer , which unfortunately kept the two vessels apart for the greater part of the voyage .
__label__0	I could not answer him .
__label__1	Being found , they were treated with great confidence and honour ( which again showed dense political ignorance ) , and were invited to come at once and do what they had to do .
__label__1	he exclaimed , `` I fear you more than any spectre I have seen .
__label__0	<NAME> , with the utmost coolness , <NAME> added : ‘ Even admitting , sir , that the thing were untrue , you will , at least , no longer maintain that it is impossible. ’ ” “ Well put in ! ” said <NAME> , “ and if the <NAME> found it lie heavy on his stomach , he got no more than he deserved .
__label__1	All the wealth I have is hers if she will take me for her slave .
__label__0	`` Yes , '' he replied , and tears stood in his eyes , `` yes , it may be so .
__label__1	So it is with the one great cardinal virtue , which , properly nourished and exercised , leads to , if it does not necessarily include , all the others .
__label__0	<NAME> made a sign , the men stopped rowing , and , brandishing his harpoon , he hurled it skilfully ; this , with sharp barbs , sank into the thick layers of fat .
__label__1	It wanted but a very slight circumstance to kindle his wrath against <NAME> .
__label__0	“ We shall have hard work to get over , ” said <NAME> , looking at the chain of mountains , the outlines of which were fast fading away in the deepening darkness .
__label__1	“ Now , follow that passage with your eye , and tell me whether it distinctly states that the prisoner expressly said that he was instructed by his legal advisers wholly to reserve his defence ?
__label__0	`` My dear Clawbonny , '' answered <NAME> , `` it is the custom , not to say the habit , of every explorer to give a name to the continent which he has discovered .
__label__1	Then <NAME> beat him , and pouted , and said , ‘ My poor beautiful flowers ! ’ as compassionately , I thought , as if <NAME> had laid hold of me .
__label__0	They were <NAME> and Herming , the only two sailors of the crew of the <NAME> schooner who were left .
__label__1	Of course , ’ said her father , meditating .
__label__1	The dark windows over yonder. ’ ‘ I may go to <NAME> to-morrow ? ’ asked <NAME> .
__label__1	Who set this chap on , in this dress , when the carting began ?
__label__0	Two or three others produced similar letters .
__label__1	'This young lady , ' the gentleman began , 'has communicated to me , and to some other friends who can be safely trusted , what you told her nearly a fortnight since .
__label__1	As he did so , hat in hand , <NAME> whispered : ‘ He killed the dog. ’ ‘ <NAME> know it ? ’ Little <NAME> whispered .
__label__1	Do you take any interest in writing people , or in painting or sculpturing people , or in acting people , or in anything of that sort ? ’ Possibly the patient answered yes , and mentioned somebody , of whom <NAME> had no more personal knowledge than of Ptolemy the <NAME> .
__label__1	As the other two were impressed with a similar presentiment ; and as their blood , like his , had all gone down again ; some speculation ensued upon the cause of this sudden change in their temperament .
__label__0	We must go away -- before winter -- '' He drew himself up , and cast a last glance towards <NAME> .
__label__1	<NAME> , with his glued to <NAME> ’ s countenance , ran up against the people who were walking about , and fell over little children , and stumbled against steps and railings , without appearing at all sensible of it , until <NAME> , looking stealthily up , said -- ‘ How do you do , <NAME> ? ’ ‘ It _is_ him ! ’ exclaimed <NAME> ; and having established <NAME> ’ s identity beyond all doubt , he smote his leg , and vented his feelings in a long , shrill whistle .
__label__0	They went from one prairie to another , always finding a well-spread table for their four-footed guests .
__label__0	Unfortunately , they were not only to be found on land .
__label__1	The wine being by this time poured out , <NAME> drank to Mrs. Perker and the children , and <NAME> to <NAME> .
__label__1	The child he was nursing stretched forth its arms and cried out to be taken by <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ It may be , or may not be , ’ said Mr Boffin , ‘ just as you view it .
__label__1	He leaves his lodgings every morning at a certain hour , throws himself upon the town , gets through his day in some manner quite satisfactory to himself , and regularly appears at the door of his own house again at night , like the mysterious master of <NAME> .
__label__0	Will <NAME> took two or three turns on the poop , making it resound with iron-heeled boots , and then he turned abruptly to <NAME> .
__label__1	But I did both , and made them happy .
__label__0	Then passed rafts of wood interminably long , and barges loaded to the gunwale , and nearly sinking under water .
__label__1	My father is <NAME> 's cousin ; not that that implies familiar intercourse between them , for he is a bad courtier and will not propitiate her. ” <NAME> had a frank and easy way with him that was very taking .
__label__1	Firm of look and firm of purpose , she intently watched its coming on , until it was very near ; then , with a touch unshipped her sculls , and crept aft in the boat , between kneeling and crouching .
__label__1	Batter the gate once more ! ’ He stood listening intently , but the noise was not renewed .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> thought , and with reason , that it was better to remain in deep water , and keep clear of continents or islands , which the beast itself seemed to shun ( perhaps because there was not enough water for him !
__label__0	`` It seems to me , '' said M'Nicholl , `` that , taking everything into consideration , the invisible side has been rather shabbily treated . ''
__label__1	She was out of breath -- for Mr Dombey , full of great thoughts , had walked fast -- and she croaked hoarsely as she waited for the opening of the door .
__label__1	A fine full-coloured young woman , Mr Clennam , with very dark hair and very dark eyes .
__label__1	‘ Leave your nephew here , for the present .
__label__0	<NAME> had , as has been said , taken his seat on the raft , when he felt a hand laid on his arm .
__label__0	To withstand the vertical beams of that noontide sun would seem to require a skin of brass and a brain of adamant ; but yet , hour after hour , he would remain conscientiously scanning the surface of the <NAME> , which , calm and deserted , lay outstretched before him .
__label__0	It was a rich prize , 1,313,842 `` pieces of eight , '' [ 1 ] and 35,682 ounces of ingot silver , with other merchandise of little value in comparison with the money .
__label__0	The worthy Professor never spoke a word .
__label__0	Well , although I do not know <NAME> , I venture to assert that the brothers do not resemble each other -- at least in their behaviour to the Governor of <NAME> d'Acunha ! ''
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> came up beside the corpse , which was already stiffened by the ice .
__label__1	And now , dear Biddy , if you can tell me that you will go through the world with me , you will surely make it a better world for me , and me a better man for it , and I will try hard to make it a better world for you. ” <NAME> was my purpose .
__label__1	Here , he was searched , that he might not have about him the means of anticipating the law ; this ceremony performed , they led him to one of the condemned cells , and left him there -- alone .
__label__1	I yield. ’ <NAME> was at once overwhelmed with blushes and expressions of gratitude , of which latter commodity neither <NAME> nor Mrs. <NAME> was by any means sparing .
__label__0	No other incident at that period of our voyage calls for notice .
__label__0	Here <NAME> came , according to his wants , to pack up those millions with which he burdened the <NAME> .
__label__0	<NAME> , the last <NAME> town situated on the shore of the <NAME> of <NAME> , had been honored by a visit from him .
__label__1	In the meantime Mr Toots , who had come upstairs after her , all unconscious of the effect he produced , announced himself with his knuckles on the door , and walked in very briskly .
__label__0	Hence they were not averse to being put into harness .
__label__1	‘ You see , <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> -- ‘ and I hope you see too , <NAME> -- there are many little ways in which I can be slightly useful to you , if you will make no stranger of me ; and in which I shall be delighted to be so .
__label__1	<NAME> dismiss that from your consideration .
__label__1	She ’ ll drop down the river with that theer tide .
__label__1	<NAME> had only to remember that her star of promise was clouded in the general gloom that hung upon the house , and to weep and be resigned .
__label__1	Failing those desired results , it was to remain in my possession. ’ Some trouble was in the young man ’ s face , and some indecision was in the action of his hand , as <NAME> , looking steadfastly at him , gave him the ring .
__label__1	'And very grateful indeed , sir , for your goodness to me . '
__label__1	`` This other gentleman is in the preaching line , I think ? ''
__label__0	Not a bit of it .
__label__0	<NAME> skirted it until he reached <NAME> , where he landed with the armed detachments of the <NAME> and <NAME> .
__label__1	Or what avails a curse or blessing from a man like you ?
__label__1	`` You have n't looked in at all ? ''
__label__1	I walked out once , <NAME> , during a conversation between two brothers , to which , in the beginning , young <NAME> was a party .
__label__1	<NAME> answers with a nod of deepest meaning and calls , as she scrapes the butter on the loaf with every precaution against waste and cuts it into slices , `` You , <NAME> , where are you ? ''
__label__1	To divert his thoughts from this melancholy subject , I informed <NAME> that I relied upon him for a bowl of punch , and led him to the lemons .
__label__0	A lighted brand was also presented to them , and fully persuaded that it was a peaceful ceremony , they did not hesitate to light the pile which was prepared .
__label__0	The bodies of the three bears were carried forward .
__label__1	YOU 'RE a moral character , '' says the trooper , eyeing him in his large way with no small indignation ; `` upon my life you are , <NAME> ! ''
__label__1	Not only was I soon as well known on the <NAME> as the postmen on that beat , but I pervaded <NAME> likewise .
__label__0	<NAME> was aware that by this mode of procedure , he and his companions would spare themselves needless humiliation .
__label__0	So the calculations of <NAME> , <NAME> , and other physicists prove that in our hemisphere there are two poles of extreme cold : one in <NAME> in latitude 79° 30 ' N. , and longitude 120° E. ; the other is in <NAME> , in latitude 78° N. , and longitude 97° W. This last alone concerns us , and you see , <NAME> , that it is more than twelve degrees below the Pole .
__label__1	‘ Why , sister <NAME> , sister <NAME> , what do you see from the turret ? ’ said <NAME> , rallying her .
__label__1	There ’ s no way out of it , <NAME> , sir , ’ observed <NAME> , ‘ when it ’ s got to this. ’ ‘ -- that I did , ’ said <NAME> , glancing helplessly and distractedly at his partner , ‘ that I did doubt her , and think her wanting in her duty to you ; and that I did sometimes , if I must say all , feel averse to Agnes being in such a familiar relation towards her , as to see what I saw , or in my diseased theory fancied that I saw .
__label__1	“ Here is monsieur , who knows a well-made shoe when he sees one .
__label__1	How dare I say it is my sister ’ s ! ’ She was weeping still .
__label__1	The name of <NAME> is the name of the age .
__label__1	They think me a long way off , and if I went wholly unexpected , I should frighten them .
__label__1	The preparations for the reception of visitors appeared to be completed .
__label__1	Mr <NAME> took the lead , towing Mr Wegg , in order that his refractory leg might be promptly extricated from any pitfalls it should dig for itself .
__label__0	<NAME> had been forgotten , the provisions were abundant and of good quality ; each vessel was provided with all kinds of scientific instruments by the best makers , a library of the most trustworthy authorities , passports couched in the most flattering terms and signed by every government in <NAME> , and unlimited credit in all the towns of <NAME> and <NAME> .
__label__1	He could not tell me that ; he saw me , and over my shoulder he saw the man .
__label__0	No part of the windows appeared over the water , but the trap hole had been thrown open , and through it came the pole that bore the <NAME> flag .
__label__1	<NAME> , baffled by his Nephew in his late Design , hatches a Scheme of Retaliation which <NAME> suggests to him , and takes into his Counsels a tried Auxiliary The course which these adventures shape out for themselves , and imperatively call upon the historian to observe , now demands that they should revert to the point they attained previously to the commencement of the last chapter , when <NAME> and <NAME> were left together in the house where death had so suddenly reared his dark and heavy banner .
__label__1	<NAME> <NAME> kissed her hand , retired to the window , and pulling out his pocket-handkerchief , had a mental wrestle with himself .
__label__0	I cast a last look at the man-of-war , which was putting on steam , and rejoined <NAME> and <NAME> .
__label__0	“ I will accompany you , ” said <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ And now , <NAME> , ’ pursued <NAME> , ‘ I ’ ll make a confession to you .
__label__1	But I am anticipating now the purport of our conversation on the ride home instead of first marrying <NAME> .
__label__0	To the surprise of all , and especially of <NAME> , the line indicated a bottom at a nearly uniform depth of from four to five fathoms ; and although the sounding was persevered with continuously for more than two hours over a considerable area , the differences of level were insignificant , not corresponding in any degree to what would be expected over the site of a city that had been terraced like the seats of an amphitheater .
__label__1	I ’ m a going to seek my Em ’ ly .
__label__0	During four successive journeys from 1638 to 1663 , he travelled over <NAME> , the <NAME> , the Indies as far as the frontier of <NAME> , and the <NAME> of <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ I admire your taste , sir , ’ says <NAME> .
__label__0	His imagination is a perfect volcano , and to make discoveries in the interests of geology he would sacrifice his life .
__label__1	And I 'm so happy and so thankful , miss , '' cried <NAME> with a heaving heart , `` and I 'll try to be such a good maid ! ''
__label__0	They had been discovered with four others , from nine to twelve degrees further east , by the <NAME> Captains Marion-Dufresne and <NAME> , in 1772 .
__label__0	There I should meet him for the last time .
__label__1	We must break it to get it through into the cage .
__label__1	Nor did she feel safe until she had set a mile or two of by-road between herself and the marketplace , and had crept into a copse , like a hunted animal , to hide and recover breath .
__label__1	Take your old place ! ’ <NAME> , looking anything but reassured , sat down on the floor at the bedside , keeping his eyes upon his patron all the time .
__label__0	Also a building made of reeds , so closely interlaced as to be impenetrable to water ; it was a sort of movable kiosk that the great khan inhabited during the fine months of June , July , and August .
__label__1	‘ Good-bye , Loo. ’ She gave him an affectionate good-night , and went out with him to the door , whence the fires of <NAME> could be seen , making the distance lurid .
__label__0	Will they go from one planet to another , from <NAME> to <NAME> , and after awhile from one star to another , from the Polar to <NAME> ?
__label__0	It would be a terrible journey .
__label__1	‘ I shall be stronger than I was afore .
__label__0	A few Indians had wandered to the mouth of this river .
__label__1	But they recall no feeling of disgust or reluctance .
__label__1	And there my sister became so excited by the twenty-five guineas , that nothing would serve her but we must have a dinner out of that windfall at the <NAME> , and that <NAME> must go over in his chaise-cart , and bring the <NAME> and <NAME> .
__label__1	He could not have said how many , or when ; but he saw in the faces of his pupils that they had seen him in that state , and that they were possessed by a dread of his relapsing .
__label__1	Upon the <NAME> ’ s door-steps one day , <NAME> stood with a fluttering heart , and with his small right hand in his father ’ s .
__label__0	There <NAME> revictualled , and by accurate observations settled its position at 10 degrees 35 minutes southern latitude , and 237 degrees 30 minutes west longitude .
__label__1	‘ My dear Sir , ’ she said , addressing Mr Dombey , at whose munificence both she and <NAME> were shedding tears copiously ; ‘ I think you have overlooked something .
__label__1	At first the two travellers spoke little , and only in whispers , but as they grew more familiar with the place they ventured to converse with greater freedom , and talked about the country through which they were passing , and the different objects that presented themselves , until the old man fell asleep ; which the lady of the caravan observing , invited <NAME> to come and sit beside her .
__label__1	Again , only this morning at breakfast .
__label__1	Give me a week. ’ ‘ One week , ’ said <NAME> , turning to his companion , ‘ from today .
__label__1	Hills swelling above each other ; and undulations shapely and uncouth , smooth and rugged , graceful and grotesque , thrown negligently side by side , bounded the view in each direction ; while frequently , with unexpected noise , there uprose from the ground a flight of crows , who , cawing and wheeling round the nearest hills , as if uncertain of their course , suddenly poised themselves upon the wing and skimmed down the long vista of some opening valley , with the speed of light itself .
__label__0	“ And what distance is it to the <NAME> , captain ? ” “ About fifteen miles , ” replied the engineer .
__label__0	`` Then what were you doing here ? ''
__label__1	And here 's Mrs. Cruncher , or leastways wos in the <NAME> times , and would be to-morrow , if cause given , a floppin ' again the business to that degree as is ruinating -- stark ruinating !
__label__1	‘ He had hardly read it when he was called away .
__label__0	Was I to meet in these depths companions and friends of <NAME> Nemo whom he was going to visit , and who , like him , led this strange existence ?
__label__1	Ten or a dozen years .
__label__1	‘ Ah , run avay , ’ said <NAME> , jumping up on the box .
__label__0	I pity him , <NAME> , and I ca n't do anything to relieve him . ''
__label__1	You will be good enough to observe , <NAME> , that no message to Mrs Dombey with which you are or may be charged , admits of reply .
__label__1	returned <NAME> , opening her eyes .
__label__1	I felt that I could bear no more , and that I must run away .
__label__0	Numbers of icebergs capsize thus on the polar seas , and form one of the greatest dangers to which approaching vessels are exposed .
__label__0	This declaration was received with enthusiasm by the whole crew , who were animated , like all Dutchmen of that period , with a love for great discoveries .
__label__1	I thought of <NAME> : and a foolish , fearful fancy came upon me of his being near at hand , and liable to be met at any turn .
__label__0	“ A mole-hill like <NAME> would have been ground to powder in a moment. ” “ Mole-hill ! ” exclaimed <NAME> , stung to the quick .
__label__0	The steamer was very well arranged , and the passengers , according to their condition or resources , occupied three distinct classes on board .
__label__0	`` Sir , '' said <NAME> , `` if that vessel passes within a mile of us I shall throw myself into the sea , and I should advise you to do the same . ''
__label__0	`` Shall I ever realize the absurdity of my entering into an argument with a scientist ! ''
__label__1	<NAME> to me to-morrow , and keep your own counsel on this subject -- though I need hardly tell you that ; for you ’ ll do so for your own sakes .
__label__0	At five o ’ clock in the evening , <NAME> gave the signal to halt .
__label__1	“ <NAME> , ” he answered , in the same tone ; “ chrisen 'd Abel. ” “ What were you brought up to be ? ” “ A warmint , dear boy. ” He answered quite seriously , and used the word as if it denoted some profession .
__label__1	you ’ ll know better by-and-by : ’ when suddenly the novice , who had been backing towards the gangway in his noisy merriment , fell overboard before their eyes , and splashed heavily down into the river between the vessel and the dock .
__label__1	`` My dear , I do n't know it , '' said I .
__label__1	“ I am looking about me. ” Somehow , that pursuit seemed more in keeping with <NAME> 's <NAME> .
__label__0	[ Illustration ] <NAME> tried to pierce the dense cloud of mist , for , according to his calculation , they should be through the strait at six o'clock of the evening .
__label__0	They reached <NAME> , and then the <NAME> River where they embarked on the <NAME> , at which port <NAME> , then commanding the station , got them a passage on board a transport-ship .
__label__0	The doctor , much moved , wanted to defend himself by modesty , but he was unable .
__label__0	So I didn ’ t spend much time thinking about it , but jumped right on the back of one of those innocent animals and away we went galloping north as fast as our legs could carry us .
__label__0	The poop of the vessel was crowded on a moment .
__label__0	<NAME> is extinct. ” “ I am sadly afraid , however , ” continued the count , “ that an Englishman will be an Englishman ever. ” “ Yes , ” said the captain , “ that is always their failing. ” And thus all further thought of making their way again to the little garrison of <NAME> was abandoned .
__label__0	It was consequently impossible to cast anchor , or to use the capstan .
__label__1	I couldn ’ t have done it , <NAME> .
__label__0	“ Let us wait a little longer , <NAME> , and not lose heart .
__label__0	He accosted me as follows : `` Accept my sincere compliments , Mr .
__label__0	It is some cavalry exercise that they are going through .
__label__0	“ <NAME> pass <NAME> no longer , sire. ” “ A courier this moment ! ” The officer left the hall and entered a large antechamber adjoining .
__label__0	It had been recently done with lime , leaving on the rock a long whitish mark , badly concealed with coal dust .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> and gentleman ? ’ inquired <NAME> , almost breathless with impatience .
__label__0	Two hours wore away thus .
__label__0	Here were four sheds sacred to the building of large war-canoes , and others containing <NAME> boats .
__label__0	“ <NAME> was alone , but he had no want of either ammunition , weapons , tools , or seeds .
__label__0	I am going to floor you completely , and never was an Englishman more thoroughly defeated than you will be .
__label__0	The populace thronged day and night round the gaol of <NAME> .
__label__1	But still , when that day and many other days were gone and past , it seemed that <NAME> took no heed whatever of the Major , and thought nothing at all about him .
__label__0	It was not even now quite dark , the light filtering down in a most extraordinary manner .
__label__1	‘ If it had been anyone but you , <NAME> , ’ said I , turning away my head , ‘ I should not have minded it half so much .
__label__0	Taking every possible difficulty into account , and allowing for the minutest precautions , the captain hoped that it would be completed before the close of the day .
__label__1	Some artists , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ keep a red coat , and charge seven-and-sixpence extra for hire and carmine ; but I don ’ t do that myself , for I don ’ t consider it legitimate. ’ Drawing herself up , as though she plumed herself greatly upon not resorting to these lures to catch sitters , <NAME> applied herself , more intently , to her task : only raising her head occasionally , to look with unspeakable satisfaction at some touch she had just put in : and now and then giving <NAME> to understand what particular feature she was at work upon , at the moment ; ‘ not , ’ she expressly observed , ‘ that you should make it up for painting , my dear , but because it ’ s our custom sometimes to tell sitters what part we are upon , in order that if there ’ s any particular expression they want introduced , they may throw it in , at the time , you know. ’ ‘ And when , ’ said <NAME> , after a long silence , to wit , an interval of full a minute and a half , ‘ when do you expect to see your uncle again ? ’ ‘ I scarcely know ; I had expected to have seen him before now , ’ replied <NAME> .
__label__0	At the moment of <NAME> 's coming out of his swoon the faithful <NAME> was licking his face and hands with lavish affection .
__label__1	‘ You have been recently married , ma ’ am ? ’ ‘ I have , ’ replied <NAME> , in a scarcely audible tone , laying aside her work , and becoming greatly agitated as a thought , that had occurred to her before , struck more forcibly upon her mind .
__label__1	Happily , ’ said Mr Rugg , with sarcasm , ‘ I did not so far travel out of the record as to ask the gentleman for his name. ’ ‘ I suppose I have no resource but to see him , ’ sighed <NAME> , wearily .
__label__0	One would have thought that <NAME> was courting a death worthy of himself , a death by lightning .
__label__1	<NAME> o ’ clock had hardly ceased striking on the following morning , when <NAME> ’ s comprehensive mind was aroused from the state of unconsciousness , in which slumber had plunged it , by a loud knocking at his chamber door .
__label__1	Ask him , is that so. ” “ It is so , ” assented <NAME> .
__label__1	Although I was treated in every other respect like the rest of the school , this single difference was made in my case from the first .
__label__1	'Bill , ' cried the girl , striving to lay her head upon his breast , 'the gentleman and that dear lady , told me to-night of a home in some foreign country where I could end my days in solitude and peace .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> made up his mind rapidly .
__label__1	He remained at the bottom , apparently drowned , for at least ten minutes .
__label__1	`` Why , my darling , '' said I , `` what a goose you must take me for !
__label__0	<NAME> winds , heavy weather , and a running sea , caused much damage to the <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ We can do it in a fortnight. ’ ‘ No , I thank you .
__label__1	But even to get the very doubtful and preliminary stage of making the appeal , seemed one of the least promising of human undertakings .
__label__1	And the <NAME> of <NAME> , who on account of always having the whole of his little income anticipated stood in fact pledged to abstain from cakes as well as tobacco , so swelled with grief and rage when we passed a pastry-cook 's shop that he terrified me by becoming purple .
__label__1	said the old lady : observing in great surprise , the look of awe with which the child regarded the painting .
__label__0	`` I tell you , it wants nothing -- unless it is -- '' `` That will come , <NAME> , that will be found , '' replied the engineer ; `` but now we must continue our voyage and push on as far as the river will carry our boat ! ''
__label__1	‘ Yes , ’ said <NAME> ; ‘ but that ’ s nothin ’ if we could find out the young ‘ ooman ; ’ and here <NAME> , with many digressions upon the personal beauty of <NAME> , and the unspeakable tortures he had experienced since he last saw her , gave a faithful account of <NAME> ’ s present predicament .
__label__1	That gentleman ’ s ed would come up-ards when his turn come , that gentleman ’ s air would be a pleasure to look upon being all smooth again , and wery well then !
__label__0	On the 23rd June the <NAME> left <NAME> , filled with gratitude to the king , who had given them valuable presents , and warned them to accept no food , lest it should be poisoned , from any but the governors of the places they should pass through .
__label__0	<NAME> was not yet falling , so <NAME> raised the leathern curtains which protected the interior of the tarantass and looked out , watching the sides of the road , peopled with fantastic shadows , caused by the wavering light of the lanterns .
__label__0	To stop , to hide himself behind some tree trunk , to disappear under a bush , might induce the guariba to pull up and retrace his steps , and there was nothing else for <NAME> to try .
__label__1	‘ You must not be one , dear <NAME> , ’ cried the boy .
__label__1	It troubled me that there should have been a lurker on the stairs , on that night of all nights in the year , and I asked the watchman , on the chance of eliciting some hopeful explanation as I handed him a dram at the door , whether he had admitted at his gate any gentleman who had perceptibly been dining out ?
__label__1	This ballad , he informs Mrs. Bagnet , he considers to have been his most powerful ally in moving the heart of Mrs. Bucket when a maiden , and inducing her to approach the altar -- <NAME> 's own words are `` to come up to the scratch . ''
__label__0	The vapors gradually condensed in diluvial rains , which fell as if they had leapt from the necks of thousands of millions of seltzer water bottles .
__label__0	<NAME> had also provided himself with a work which combined in one compilation all the notions already acquired concerning the Nile .
__label__1	Having communicated this piece of information , apparently more for the purpose of discharging his bosom of an important fact , than with any specific view of enlightening <NAME> , the guide , having at length reached another gallery , led the way into a small passage at the extreme end , opened a door , and disclosed an apartment of an appearance by no means inviting , containing eight or nine iron bedsteads .
__label__1	Does that look as if I cared for her ?
__label__0	“ <NAME> , -- is it <NAME> where they have been shipwrecked ?
__label__1	The old man and the child passed on through the glad silence , elate with hope and pleasure .
__label__1	What you have said to me could have affected me so much from no other lips , for there are none that could give it such a value to me .
__label__0	For , although the rascals can do nothing to our house , they may plunder the plateau , our plantations , our poultry-yard ! ''
__label__1	HE was open , liberal , gallant , gay ; I a crafty hunks of cold and stagnant blood , with no passion but love of saving , and no spirit beyond a thirst for gain .
__label__1	We went back next day to my aunt ’ s house -- not to mine -- and when she and I sat alone , as of old , before going to bed , she said : ‘ <NAME> , do you really wish to know what I have had upon my mind lately ? ’ ‘ Indeed I do , aunt .
__label__1	Mrs <NAME> ’ s niece , <NAME> , took cold pork .
__label__1	And through getting acquainted with him , you see -- why -- I got acquainted with her , ’ said <NAME> tautologically .
__label__1	Mr Morfin , as an officer of inferior state , inhabited the room that was nearest to the clerks .
__label__0	The wood appeared as deserted as on the day when the colonists first landed on the island .
__label__1	Nothing easier , ’ said Mr Carker , without any show of surprise , and taking up the pen to re-endorse the letter , as coolly as he had done before .
__label__1	It seemed to her that she awoke after sleeping some hours , and found <NAME> not yet abed .
__label__0	I felt an insurmountable horror for <NAME> .
__label__0	Among the sources of wealth in Tafilet we may name very fine sheep , whose beautifully white wool makes very pretty coverlets , oxen , first-rate horses , donkeys , and mules .
__label__0	At that date , <NAME> contained about fifteen thousand inhabitants , three thousand of whom were <NAME> .
__label__1	It can ’ t be reasoned out of his head by any powers of mine but what that he can do right by your kind lady and gentleman and do his work for me , both together .
__label__1	How many of the mounds in that old churchyard where she had lately strayed , grew green above the graves of children !
__label__0	But , once more , what possible interest could any human being have in the destruction of our works ? ” “ It is quite incomprehensible , ” replied <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Now , is it all thought out ?
__label__0	His companions were , if possible , more obstinate than he in their credulity .
__label__1	As a consciously ‘ splendid woman , ’ accustomed to overhear herself so denominated by elderly osteologists pursuing their studies in dinner society , <NAME> could dispense with her daughter .
__label__1	All this , I say , is yesterday ’ s event .
__label__1	so very soon ? ’ ‘ I have thought of this for weeks , and why should I postpone it ?
__label__1	His linen ! ’ said Mr Brass smiling fondly at the wall , ‘ his linen which was always of a particular colour , for such was his whim and fancy -- how plain I see his linen now ! ’ ‘ You had better go on , sir , ’ said <NAME> impatiently .
__label__0	He stood motionless , watching the track of the yacht .
__label__1	And in what walk of life , or dance of life , does man ever get such stimulating applause as thunders about him , when , having danced his partner off her feet , and himself too , he finishes by leaping gloriously on the bar-counter , and calling for something to drink , with the chuckle of a million of counterfeit <NAME> , in one inimitable sound !
__label__0	`` It was n't the wind that blew down this post , '' observed <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Now , darlings ! ’ said the gentleman with the black hair .
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> did not return .
__label__1	In the yard , was <NAME> making a new epitaph for himself , on the occasion of his dying of a broken heart .
__label__0	There were hundreds , perhaps thousands , of these animals , and in spite of the rarefied atmosphere , their noise was deafening .
__label__0	There exist guns , according to <NAME> , perfected in <NAME> by <NAME> and <NAME> , in <NAME> by <NAME> , and in <NAME> by <NAME> , which are furnished with a peculiar system of closing , which can fire under these conditions .
__label__1	It glides over the park after the moving shadows of the clouds , and chases them , and never catches them , all day .
__label__1	I didn ’ t call too loud .
__label__1	No more to-night , and good-night ! ’ With that he kissed her hand , and , passing out to the door where her brother stood awaiting his coming , put him cheerfully aside when he essayed to speak ; told him that , as they would see each other soon and often , he might speak at another time , if he would , but there was no leisure for it then ; and went away at a round pace , in order that no word of gratitude might follow him .
__label__1	But , that my view of the <NAME> may not be mistaken or misrepresented , I will state it .
__label__1	There was one piece of gold among it , and an emergency might come when its worth to them would be increased a hundred fold .
__label__1	‘ Oh dear , Mrs. <NAME> , ’ said <NAME> , ‘ while <NAME> is making that punch to drink happy returns in , do let <NAME> go through that figure dance before <NAME> Lillyvick. ’ ‘ No , no , my dear , ’ replied Mrs. <NAME> , ‘ it will only worry my uncle. ’ ‘ It can ’ t worry him , I am sure , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ Mr <NAME> , ’ said the boy , ‘ I want a word with you .
__label__0	`` <NAME> himself , at his own request . ''
__label__1	It only brought him in wexation .
__label__0	He was seen , several times , to throw himself upon the confectionery and devour the dishes , as if he had just broken a long fast .
__label__0	| | s. d. | s. d. | s. d. | Twenty Thousand | | | | Leagues under the | 10 6 | 5 0 | 3 6 | 2 vols. , <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> know , ’ said <NAME> .
__label__1	Will you come and see the gentleman , Mr .
__label__1	I say “ ever since , ” as if I had been here a week .
__label__0	`` Do you know , my friends , '' said <NAME> , `` that if one of us had succumbed to the shock consequent on departure , we should have had a great deal of trouble to bury him ?
__label__0	The town itself was menaced by the <NAME> vanguard ; and two days before the authorities had been obliged to retreat to <NAME> .
__label__1	‘ <NAME> me ! ’ said <NAME> , with an air of constraint , ‘ I speak of my friend Heep as I have experience. ’ ‘ I am glad your experience is so favourable , ’ I returned .
__label__0	Ferguson. -- Reply of the <NAME> Koner. -- Bets made. -- Sundry Propositions offered to the Doctor .
__label__0	The first of my perceptions which returned in full force was that of hearing .
__label__0	I believe it will settle all your doubts , difficulties and objections . ''
__label__0	<NAME> <NAME> 's wardrobe was amply supplied and in the best taste .
__label__1	`` It shall not happen again , sir , '' I returned , `` but at first it is difficult -- '' `` Nonsense ! ''
__label__1	'Now , ' said the robber , 'come and sit aside of me , and put on your own face ; or I 'll alter it so , that you wo n't know it agin when you do want it . '
__label__0	They were civil , and only used that odd language among themselves , the origin of which I could not guess , neither could I question them .
__label__1	I was afraid you might be going away and hardly thinking of me ; ’ and again she gave him her little hand so freely and so faithfully that <NAME> held it for some moments in his own , and could not bear to let it go .
__label__1	“ As long as you do n't know whether they are in that room or not , you are uncertain what to do , ” said <NAME> to herself ; “ and you shall not know that , if I can prevent your knowing it ; and know that , or not know that , you shall not leave here while I can hold you. ” “ I have been in the streets from the first , nothing has stopped me , I will tear you to pieces , but I will have you from that door , ” said <NAME> .
__label__1	Tell me , Mr Dorrit , what surprise would be the most unlooked for and the most acceptable to you .
__label__0	<NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> Fedor were united .
__label__0	It consisted in offering to a friend a piece of food which had been already chewed , that he might have no trouble but that of swallowing it .
__label__0	They had one night in which to prepare for death .
__label__1	But , tut , all this is nothing !
__label__1	We do not feel justified in laying any particular stress upon the fact , because on the present occasion all Mrs. <NAME> ’ s most winning ways were brought into requisition to receive the two gentlemen .
__label__0	The <NAME> was about to dismiss his officers and retire to his apartments , when a tumult was heard outside the palace .
__label__0	Birds , quadrupeds , and reptiles were resting motionless after the fatigues of the day , and the silence of the desert brooded over the far-spreading Pampas .
__label__0	We have given an account of <NAME> 's first voyage , which coincides with that of <NAME> according to <NAME> , who has compared the principal incidents of the two narratives .
__label__1	One observes my Lord with his white hair , standing , hat in hand , to help my Lady to and from the carriage .
__label__0	Here telegraphic communication with all parts of the <NAME> was assured beyond a doubt .
__label__1	‘ You have one of those strollers ’ children in the school. ’ ‘ <NAME> , by name , ’ said <NAME> , with something of a stricken look at his friend .
__label__1	That young man hears the words I speak .
__label__1	I can ’ t say. ’ ‘ As you supposed he was at home , it would seem that he has just gone out ?
__label__1	‘ You don ’ t much mind how you sleep , I suppose , sir ? ’ No , indeed , ’ replied <NAME> , ‘ I am not particular. ’ ‘ That ’ s lucky , ’ said Mrs. Squeers .
__label__0	He did not like to abandon it !
__label__0	In vain had he refused admission to <NAME> ; every day the inquisitive neighbors scaled the palisades , some even carrying their imprudence to the point of smoking while surrounded by bales of gun-cotton .
__label__1	‘ Overtake him ; bring him back instantly !
__label__0	You know how eager is the curiosity of the public with regard to these astronomical questions .
__label__0	`` Do n't be alarmed at the heat , my boy . ''
__label__1	‘ Why nat ’ rally , ’ said Mr Riderhood , ‘ ain ’ t I always thirsty ! ’ ( <NAME> at the absurdity of the question . )
__label__0	But , each of the party , in his turn , vainly scanned the space around him during that long wearisome day .
__label__0	The cold , although not keen , increased towards daybreak , but they were well covered , and slept soundly under the watch of the peaceful animals .
__label__1	I told the gentleman at first , when he told me upstairs it was come to light , that I would answer for your being umble , and making amends .
__label__0	<NAME> this singular man ill ? -- had he altered his intentions with regard to us ?
__label__0	<NAME> and <NAME> especially hoped to end their days there .
__label__1	In another place , lay an old sword that seemed to have been a soldier 's .
__label__0	`` <NAME> , '' replied <NAME> eagerly , `` can you compare a copper or steel machine with that breath of God which is called the soul , which animates our bodies as the breeze stirs the flowers ?
__label__1	<NAME> , after several times running out , and in again , to mention such supplementary items as marmalade , eggs , watercresses , salted fish , and frizzled ham , ran across to <NAME> ’ s without his hat , to give his various directions .
__label__0	`` There exist several explanations on the subject , M. Aronnax .
__label__1	Confining yourself rigidly to <NAME> , the question of Fact you state to yourself is : Does <NAME> ask me to marry him ?
__label__1	“ <NAME> , ” said he , “ we wo n't talk about 'poor dreams ; ' you know more about such things than I , having much fresher experience of that kind .
__label__1	‘ I hope I am also , ’ rejoined the other .
__label__1	`` And , again and again , I am glad to see you , Watt !
__label__0	Some <NAME> , clad in all the sumptuousness of <NAME> apparel , and leading a woman who faltered at every step , followed .
__label__1	said <NAME> , reflectively ; 'how queer ! '
__label__1	“ Skin the stockings off <NAME> , ” said the owner of that property , “ or you 'll bust 'em .
__label__0	<NAME> , without taking into account the fatigue of his crew , made use of a device which whalers often employ under similar circumstances .
__label__0	<NAME> , a restless spirit personified in <NAME> ; perfect calmness typified in <NAME> -- such was the contrast .
__label__0	In nineteen months , notwithstanding one hundred and eighty days ’ sickness , he had traversed <NAME> from west to north .
__label__1	His mind was evidently wandering to his old life , for he continued to mutter , without appearing conscious of their presence otherwise than as a part of his vision .
__label__1	There they had been waiting for her , many and many a night , no doubt .
__label__0	`` If it is only ` much the same thing , ' I may cheer up , '' said <NAME> .
__label__0	`` Calm yourself , '' I said to the impetuous Ned ; `` anger will do no good . ''
__label__1	‘ At seven , ’ says <NAME> , looking at his plain old silver watch -- the very watch he once took a wheel out of , at school , to make a water-mill .

__label__1	‘ Can I speak to <NAME> , sir ? ’ replied <NAME> from the outside .
__label__0	Finally , however , all was arranged , and the reception was as cordial as diplomatic customs permitted .
__label__1	But though I liked him more and more the better I knew him , I still felt more and more how much it was to be regretted that he had been educated in no habits of application and concentration .
__label__1	“ Us two being now alone , ” resumed <NAME> , “ and me having the intentions and abilities to stay not many minutes more , I will now conclude -- leastways begin -- to mention what have led to my having had the present honor .

__label__1	Would you take a seat in Mr Lightwood ’ s room , sir , while I look over our Appointment Book ? ’ <NAME> made a great show of fetching from his desk a long thin manuscript volume with a brown paper cover , and running his finger down the day ’ s appointments , murmuring , ‘ Mr Aggs , Mr Baggs , Mr Caggs , Mr Daggs , Mr Faggs , Mr Gaggs , Mr Boffin .

__label__0	<NAME> , in his absorbing interest for the glowing glories of the planet , seemed to be beguiled into comparative forgetfulness of the charms of his comet ; but no astronomical enthusiasm of the professor could quite allay the general apprehension that some serious collision might be impending .
__label__0	He was consulted as to the best spot for the observation of the transit of <NAME> , and he selected an island which he had discovered , and which was named by him after <NAME> .

__label__0	“ The Fire-Maiden ! ” shouted <NAME> , for the last time , as the apparition , which he and his companions believed supernatural , disappeared .
__label__1	M ’ Choakumchild reported that she had a very dense head for figures ; that , once possessed with a general idea of the globe , she took the smallest conceivable interest in its exact measurements ; that she was extremely slow in the acquisition of dates , unless some pitiful incident happened to be connected therewith ; that she would burst into tears on being required ( by the mental process ) immediately to name the cost of two hundred and forty-seven muslin caps at fourteen-pence halfpenny ; that she was as low down , in the school , as low could be ; that after eight weeks of induction into the elements of <NAME> , she had only yesterday been set right by a prattler three feet high , for returning to the question , ‘ What is the first principle of this science ? ’ the absurd answer , ‘ To do unto others as I would that they should do unto me. ’ <NAME> observed , shaking his head , that all this was very bad ; that it showed the necessity of infinite grinding at the mill of knowledge , as per system , schedule , blue book , report , and tabular statements A to <NAME> ; and that <NAME> ‘ must be kept to it. ’ So <NAME> was kept to it , and became low-spirited , but no wiser .
