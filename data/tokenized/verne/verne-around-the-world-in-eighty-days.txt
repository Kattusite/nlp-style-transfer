<NAME> <NAME> lived , in 1872 , at <NAME> .
7 , <NAME> , <NAME> , the house in which <NAME> died in 1814 .
He was one of the most noticeable members of the <NAME> , though he seemed always to avoid attracting attention ; an enigmatical personage , about whom little was known , except that he was a polished man of the world .
<NAME> said that he resembled <NAME> -- at least that his head was <NAME> ; but he was a bearded , tranquil <NAME> , who might live on a thousand years without growing old .
Certainly an Englishman , it was more doubtful whether <NAME> was a <NAME> .
He was never seen on 'Change , nor at the <NAME> , nor in the counting-rooms of the `` City '' ; no ships ever came into <NAME> docks of which he was the owner ; he had no public employment ; he had never been entered at any of the <NAME> of <NAME> , either at the <NAME> , or <NAME> 's <NAME> , or <NAME> 's <NAME> ; nor had his voice ever resounded in the Court of <NAME> , or in the <NAME> , or the <NAME> 's <NAME> , or the <NAME> .
He certainly was not a manufacturer ; nor was he a merchant or a gentleman farmer .
His name was strange to the scientific and learned societies , and he never was known to take part in the sage deliberations of the <NAME> or the <NAME> , the <NAME> 's Association , or the Institution of Arts and Sciences .
He belonged , in fact , to none of the numerous societies which swarm in the <NAME> capital , from the <NAME> to that of the Entomologists , founded mainly for the purpose of abolishing pernicious insects .
<NAME> <NAME> was a member of the <NAME> , and that was all .
The way in which he got admission to this exclusive club was simple enough .
He was recommended by the <NAME> , with whom he had an open credit .
His cheques were regularly paid at sight from his account current , which was always flush .
But those who knew him best could not imagine how he had made his fortune , and <NAME> was the last person to whom to apply for the information .
He was not lavish , nor , on the contrary , avaricious ; for , whenever he knew that money was needed for a noble , useful , or benevolent purpose , he supplied it quietly and sometimes anonymously .
He was , in short , the least communicative of men .
He talked very little , and seemed all the more mysterious for his taciturn manner .
His daily habits were quite open to observation ; but whatever he did was so exactly the same thing that he had always done before , that the wits of the curious were fairly puzzled .
It was likely , for no one seemed to know the world more familiarly ; there was no spot so secluded that he did not appear to have an intimate acquaintance with it .
He often corrected , with a few clear words , the thousand conjectures advanced by members of the club as to lost and unheard-of travellers , pointing out the true probabilities , and seeming as if gifted with a sort of second sight , so often did events justify his predictions .
He must have travelled everywhere , at least in the spirit .
It was at least certain that <NAME> had not absented himself from <NAME> for many years .
Those who were honoured by a better acquaintance with him than the rest , declared that nobody could pretend to have ever seen him anywhere else .
His sole pastimes were reading the papers and playing whist .
He often won at this game , which , as a silent one , harmonised with his nature ; but his winnings never went into his purse , being reserved as a fund for his charities .
<NAME> <NAME> played , not to win , but for the sake of playing .
The game was in his eyes a contest , a struggle with a difficulty , yet a motionless , unwearying struggle , congenial to his tastes .
<NAME> <NAME> was not known to have either wife or children , which may happen to the most honest people ; either relatives or near friends , which is certainly more unusual .
He lived alone in his house in <NAME> , whither none penetrated .
A single domestic sufficed to serve him .
He breakfasted and dined at the club , at hours mathematically fixed , in the same room , at the same table , never taking his meals with other members , much less bringing a guest with him ; and went home at exactly midnight , only to retire at once to bed .
He never used the cosy chambers which the <NAME> provides for its favoured members .
He passed ten hours out of the twenty-four in <NAME> , either in sleeping or making his toilet .
When he chose to take a walk it was with a regular step in the entrance hall with its mosaic flooring , or in the circular gallery with its dome supported by twenty red porphyry Ionic columns , and illumined by blue painted windows .
When he breakfasted or dined all the resources of the club -- its kitchens and pantries , its buttery and dairy -- aided to crowd his table with their most succulent stores ; he was served by the gravest waiters , in dress coats , and shoes with swan-skin soles , who proffered the viands in special porcelain , and on the finest linen ; club decanters , of a lost mould , contained his sherry , his port , and his cinnamon-spiced claret ; while his beverages were refreshingly cooled with ice , brought at great cost from the <NAME> lakes .
If to live in this style is to be eccentric , it must be confessed that there is something good in eccentricity .
The mansion in <NAME> , though not sumptuous , was exceedingly comfortable .
The habits of its occupant were such as to demand but little from the sole domestic , but <NAME> required him to be almost superhumanly prompt and regular .
On this very 2nd of October he had dismissed <NAME> , because that luckless youth had brought him shaving-water at eighty-four degrees Fahrenheit instead of eighty-six ; and he was awaiting his successor , who was due at the house between eleven and half-past .
<NAME> <NAME> was seated squarely in his armchair , his feet close together like those of a grenadier on parade , his hands resting on his knees , his body straight , his head erect ; he was steadily watching a complicated clock which indicated the hours , the minutes , the seconds , the days , the months , and the years .
At exactly half-past eleven <NAME> would , according to his daily habit , quit <NAME> , and repair to the <NAME> .
A rap at this moment sounded on the door of the cosy apartment where <NAME> was seated , and <NAME> , the dismissed servant , appeared .
`` The new servant , '' said he .
A young man of thirty advanced and bowed .
`` You are a <NAME> , I believe , '' asked <NAME> , `` and your name is <NAME> ? ''
`` <NAME> , if monsieur pleases , '' replied the newcomer , `` <NAME> , a surname which has clung to me because I have a natural aptness for going out of one business into another .
I believe I 'm honest , monsieur , but , to be outspoken , I 've had several trades .
I 've been an itinerant singer , a circus-rider , when I used to vault like <NAME> , and dance on a rope like <NAME> .
Then I got to be a professor of gymnastics , so as to make better use of my talents ; and then I was a sergeant fireman at <NAME> , and assisted at many a big fire .
But I quitted <NAME> five years ago , and , wishing to taste the sweets of domestic life , took service as a valet here in <NAME> .
Finding myself out of place , and hearing that <NAME> was the most exact and settled gentleman in the <NAME> , I have come to monsieur in the hope of living with him a tranquil life , and forgetting even the name of <NAME> . ''
`` Passepartout suits me , '' responded <NAME> .
`` You are well recommended to me ; I hear a good report of you .
`` Twenty-two minutes after eleven , '' returned <NAME> , drawing an enormous silver watch from the depths of his pocket .
`` You are too slow , '' said <NAME> .
`` Pardon me , monsieur , it is impossible -- '' `` You are four minutes too slow .
No matter ; it 's enough to mention the error .
Now from this moment , twenty-nine minutes after eleven , a.m. , this Wednesday , 2nd October , you are in my service . ''
<NAME> <NAME> got up , took his hat in his left hand , put it on his head with an automatic motion , and went off without a word .
<NAME> heard the street door shut once ; it was his new master going out .
He heard it shut again ; it was his predecessor , <NAME> , departing in his turn .
<NAME> remained alone in the house in <NAME> Row .
`` Faith , '' muttered <NAME> , somewhat flurried , `` I 've seen people at <NAME> 's as lively as my new master ! ''
<NAME> <NAME> 's `` people , '' let it be said , are of wax , and are much visited in <NAME> ; speech is all that is wanting to make them human .
During his brief interview with <NAME> , <NAME> had been carefully observing him .
He appeared to be a man about forty years of age , with fine , handsome features , and a tall , well-shaped figure ; his hair and whiskers were light , his forehead compact and unwrinkled , his face rather pale , his teeth magnificent .
His countenance possessed in the highest degree what physiognomists call `` repose in action , '' a quality of those who act rather than talk .
<NAME> and phlegmatic , with a clear eye , <NAME> seemed a perfect type of that <NAME> composure which <NAME> has so skilfully represented on canvas .
<NAME> in the various phases of his daily life , he gave the idea of being perfectly well-balanced , as exactly regulated as a Leroy chronometer .
<NAME> <NAME> was , indeed , exactitude personified , and this was betrayed even in the expression of his very hands and feet ; for in men , as well as in animals , the limbs themselves are expressive of the passions .
He was so exact that he was never in a hurry , was always ready , and was economical alike of his steps and his motions .
He never took one step too many , and always went to his destination by the shortest cut ; he made no superfluous gestures , and was never seen to be moved or agitated .
He was the most deliberate person in the world , yet always reached his destination at the exact moment .
He lived alone , and , so to speak , outside of every social relation ; and as he knew that in this world account must be taken of friction , and that friction retards , he never rubbed against anybody .
As for <NAME> , he was a true <NAME> .
Since he had abandoned his own country for <NAME> , taking service as a valet , he had in vain searched for a master after his own heart .
<NAME> was by no means one of those pert dunces depicted by <NAME> with a bold gaze and a nose held high in the air ; he was an honest fellow , with a pleasant face , lips a trifle protruding , soft-mannered and serviceable , with a good round head , such as one likes to see on the shoulders of a friend .
His eyes were blue , his complexion rubicund , his figure almost portly and well-built , his body muscular , and his physical powers fully developed by the exercises of his younger days .
His brown hair was somewhat tumbled ; for , while the ancient sculptors are said to have known eighteen methods of arranging <NAME> 's tresses , <NAME> was familiar with but one of dressing his own : three strokes of a large-tooth comb completed his toilet .
It would be rash to predict how <NAME> 's lively nature would agree with <NAME> .
It was impossible to tell whether the new servant would turn out as absolutely methodical as his master required ; experience alone could solve the question .
<NAME> had been a sort of vagrant in his early years , and now yearned for repose ; but so far he had failed to find it , though he had already served in ten English houses .
But he could not take root in any of these ; with chagrin , he found his masters invariably whimsical and irregular , constantly running about the country , or on the look-out for adventure .
His last master , young <NAME> , Member of <NAME> , after passing his nights in the <NAME> taverns , was too often brought home in the morning on policemen 's shoulders .
<NAME> , desirous of respecting the gentleman whom he served , ventured a mild remonstrance on such conduct ; which , being ill-received , he took his leave .
Hearing that <NAME> was looking for a servant , and that his life was one of unbroken regularity , that he neither travelled nor stayed from home overnight , he felt sure that this would be the place he was after .
He presented himself , and was accepted , as has been seen .
At half-past eleven , then , <NAME> found himself alone in the house in <NAME> Row .
He began its inspection without delay , scouring it from cellar to garret .
So clean , well-arranged , solemn a mansion pleased him ; it seemed to him like a snail 's shell , lighted and warmed by gas , which sufficed for both these purposes .
When <NAME> reached the second story he recognised at once the room which he was to inhabit , and he was well satisfied with it .
<NAME> bells and speaking-tubes afforded communication with the lower stories ; while on the mantel stood an electric clock , precisely like that in <NAME> 's bedchamber , both beating the same second at the same instant .
`` That 's good , that 'll do , '' said <NAME> to himself .
He suddenly observed , hung over the clock , a card which , upon inspection , proved to be a programme of the daily routine of the house .
It comprised all that was required of the servant , from eight in the morning , exactly at which hour <NAME> rose , till half-past eleven , when he left the house for the <NAME> -- all the details of service , the tea and toast at twenty-three minutes past eight , the shaving-water at thirty-seven minutes past nine , and the toilet at twenty minutes before ten .
Everything was regulated and foreseen that was to be done from half-past eleven a.m. till midnight , the hour at which the methodical gentleman retired .
<NAME> <NAME> 's wardrobe was amply supplied and in the best taste .
Each pair of trousers , coat , and vest bore a number , indicating the time of year and season at which they were in turn to be laid out for wearing ; and the same system was applied to the master 's shoes .
In short , the house in <NAME> , which must have been a very temple of disorder and unrest under the illustrious but dissipated <NAME> , was cosiness , comfort , and method idealised .
There was no study , nor were there books , which would have been quite useless to <NAME> ; for at the Reform two libraries , one of general literature and the other of law and politics , were at his service .
A moderate-sized safe stood in his bedroom , constructed so as to defy fire as well as burglars ; but <NAME> found neither arms nor hunting weapons anywhere ; everything betrayed the most tranquil and peaceable habits .
Having scrutinised the house from top to bottom , he rubbed his hands , a broad smile overspread his features , and he said joyfully , `` This is just what I wanted !
<NAME> , we shall get on together , <NAME> and I !
What a domestic and regular gentleman !
A real machine ; well , I do n't mind serving a machine . ''
<NAME> <NAME> , having shut the door of his house at half-past eleven , and having put his right foot before his left five hundred and seventy-five times , and his left foot before his right five hundred and seventy-six times , reached the <NAME> , an imposing edifice in <NAME> , which could not have cost less than three millions .
He repaired at once to the dining-room , the nine windows of which open upon a tasteful garden , where the trees were already gilded with an autumn colouring ; and took his place at the habitual table , the cover of which had already been laid for him .
His breakfast consisted of a side-dish , a broiled fish with Reading sauce , a scarlet slice of roast beef garnished with mushrooms , a rhubarb and gooseberry tart , and a morsel of <NAME> cheese , the whole being washed down with several cups of tea , for which the <NAME> is famous .
He rose at thirteen minutes to one , and directed his steps towards the large hall , a sumptuous apartment adorned with lavishly-framed paintings .
A flunkey handed him an uncut Times , which he proceeded to cut with a skill which betrayed familiarity with this delicate operation .
The perusal of this paper absorbed <NAME> until a quarter before four , whilst the <NAME> , his next task , occupied him till the dinner hour .
<NAME> passed as breakfast had done , and <NAME> re-appeared in the reading-room and sat down to the <NAME> at twenty minutes before six .
Half an hour later several members of the <NAME> came in and drew up to the fireplace , where a coal fire was steadily burning .
They were <NAME> 's usual partners at whist : <NAME> , an engineer ; <NAME> and <NAME> , bankers ; <NAME> , a brewer ; and <NAME> , one of the Directors of the <NAME> of <NAME> -- all rich and highly respectable personages , even in a club which comprises the princes of <NAME> trade and finance .
`` Well , <NAME> , '' said <NAME> , `` what about that robbery ? ''
`` Oh , '' replied <NAME> , `` the <NAME> will lose the money . ''
`` On the contrary , '' broke in <NAME> , `` I hope we may put our hands on the robber .
<NAME> detectives have been sent to all the principal ports of <NAME> and the <NAME> , and he 'll be a clever fellow if he slips through their fingers . ''
`` But have you got the robber 's description ? ''
`` In the first place , he is no robber at all , '' returned <NAME> , positively .
a fellow who makes off with fifty-five thousand pounds , no robber ? ''
`` Perhaps he 's a manufacturer , then . ''
`` The <NAME> says that he is a gentleman . ''
It was <NAME> , whose head now emerged from behind his newspapers , who made this remark .
He bowed to his friends , and entered into the conversation .
The affair which formed its subject , and which was town talk , had occurred three days before at the <NAME> of <NAME> .
A package of banknotes , to the value of fifty-five thousand pounds , had been taken from the principal cashier 's table , that functionary being at the moment engaged in registering the receipt of three shillings and sixpence .
Of course , he could not have his eyes everywhere .
Let it be observed that the <NAME> of <NAME> reposes a touching confidence in the honesty of the public .
There are neither guards nor gratings to protect its treasures ; gold , silver , banknotes are freely exposed , at the mercy of the first comer .
A keen observer of <NAME> customs relates that , being in one of the rooms of the <NAME> one day , he had the curiosity to examine a gold ingot weighing some seven or eight pounds .
He took it up , scrutinised it , passed it to his neighbour , he to the next man , and so on until the ingot , going from hand to hand , was transferred to the end of a dark entry ; nor did it return to its place for half an hour .
Meanwhile , the cashier had not so much as raised his head .
But in the present instance things had not gone so smoothly .
The package of notes not being found when five o'clock sounded from the ponderous clock in the `` drawing office , '' the amount was passed to the account of profit and loss .
As soon as the robbery was discovered , picked detectives hastened off to <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and other ports , inspired by the proffered reward of two thousand pounds , and five per cent .
on the sum that might be recovered .
Detectives were also charged with narrowly watching those who arrived at or left <NAME> by rail , and a judicial examination was at once entered upon .
There were real grounds for supposing , as the <NAME> said , that the thief did not belong to a professional band .
On the day of the robbery a well-dressed gentleman of polished manners , and with a well-to-do air , had been observed going to and fro in the paying room where the crime was committed .
A description of him was easily procured and sent to the detectives ; and some hopeful spirits , of whom <NAME> was one , did not despair of his apprehension .
The papers and clubs were full of the affair , and everywhere people were discussing the probabilities of a successful pursuit ; and the <NAME> was especially agitated , several of its members being <NAME> officials .
<NAME> would not concede that the work of the detectives was likely to be in vain , for he thought that the prize offered would greatly stimulate their zeal and activity .
But <NAME> was far from sharing this confidence ; and , as they placed themselves at the whist-table , they continued to argue the matter .
<NAME> and <NAME> played together , while <NAME> had <NAME> for his partner .
As the game proceeded the conversation ceased , excepting between the rubbers , when it revived again .
`` I maintain , '' said <NAME> , `` that the chances are in favour of the thief , who must be a shrewd fellow . ''
`` Well , but where can he fly to ? ''
`` No country is safe for him . ''
`` Where could he go , then ? ''
`` Oh , I do n't know that .
The world is big enough . ''
`` It was once , '' said <NAME> , in a low tone .
`` Cut , sir , '' he added , handing the cards to <NAME> .
The discussion fell during the rubber , after which <NAME> took up its thread .
`` What do you mean by ` once ' ?
Has the world grown smaller ? ''
`` I agree with <NAME> .
The world has grown smaller , since a man can now go round it ten times more quickly than a hundred years ago .
And that is why the search for this thief will be more likely to succeed . ''
`` And also why the thief can get away more easily . ''
`` Be so good as to play , <NAME> , '' said <NAME> .
But the incredulous <NAME> was not convinced , and when the hand was finished , said eagerly : `` You have a strange way , <NAME> , of proving that the world has grown smaller .
So , because you can go round it in three months -- '' `` In eighty days , '' interrupted <NAME> .
`` That is true , gentlemen , '' added <NAME> .
`` Only eighty days , now that the section between <NAME> and <NAME> , on the <NAME> Indian <NAME> , has been opened .
Here is the estimate made by the <NAME> : From <NAME> to <NAME> via <NAME> and <NAME> , by rail and steamboats ... ... ... ... ... .. 7 days From <NAME> to <NAME> , by steamer ... ... ... ... ... ... .. 13 `` From <NAME> to <NAME> , by rail ... ... ... ... ... ... . 3 `` From <NAME> to <NAME> , by steamer ... ... ... ... . 13 `` From <NAME> to <NAME> ( <NAME> ) , by steamer ... .. 6 `` From <NAME> to <NAME> , by steamer ... ... ... 22 `` From <NAME> Francisco to <NAME> , by rail ... ... ... ... . 7 `` From <NAME> to <NAME> , by steamer and rail ... ... .. 9 `` `` Yes , in eighty days ! ''
exclaimed <NAME> , who in his excitement made a false deal .
`` But that does n't take into account bad weather , contrary winds , shipwrecks , railway accidents , and so on . ''
`` All included , '' returned <NAME> , continuing to play despite the discussion .
`` But suppose the <NAME> or Indians pull up the rails , '' replied <NAME> ; `` suppose they stop the trains , pillage the luggage-vans , and scalp the passengers ! ''
`` All included , '' calmly retorted <NAME> ; adding , as he threw down the cards , `` Two trumps . ''
<NAME> , whose turn it was to deal , gathered them up , and went on : `` You are right , theoretically , <NAME> , but practically -- '' `` Practically also , Mr .
`` I 'd like to see you do it in eighty days . ''
But I would wager four thousand pounds that such a journey , made under these conditions , is impossible . ''
`` Quite possible , on the contrary , '' returned <NAME> .
`` The journey round the world in eighty days ? ''
`` I should like nothing better . ''
Only I warn you that I shall do it at your expense . ''
cried Stuart , who was beginning to be annoyed at the persistency of his friend .
`` Come , let 's go on with the game . ''
`` Deal over again , then , '' said <NAME> .
<NAME> took up the pack with a feverish hand ; then suddenly put them down again .
`` Well , <NAME> , '' said he , `` it shall be so : I will wager the four thousand on it . ''
`` Calm yourself , my dear Stuart , '' said <NAME> .
`` When I say I 'll wager , '' returned <NAME> , `` I mean it . ''
`` All right , '' said <NAME> ; and , turning to the others , he continued : `` I have a deposit of twenty thousand at <NAME> 's which I will willingly risk upon it . ''
`` Twenty thousand pounds , which you would lose by a single accidental delay ! ''
`` The unforeseen does not exist , '' quietly replied <NAME> .
`` But , <NAME> , eighty days are only the estimate of the least possible time in which the journey can be made . ''
`` A well-used minimum suffices for everything . ''
`` But , in order not to exceed it , you must jump mathematically from the trains upon the steamers , and from the steamers upon the trains again . ''
`` A true <NAME> does n't joke when he is talking about so serious a thing as a wager , '' replied <NAME> , solemnly .
`` I will bet twenty thousand pounds against anyone who wishes that I will make the tour of the world in eighty days or less ; in nineteen hundred and twenty hours , or a hundred and fifteen thousand two hundred minutes .
`` We accept , '' replied Messrs. Stuart , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , after consulting each other .
`` The train leaves for Dover at a quarter before nine .
`` This very evening , '' returned <NAME> .
He took out and consulted a pocket almanac , and added , `` As today is Wednesday , the 2nd of October , I shall be due in <NAME> in this very room of the <NAME> , on Saturday , the 21st of December , at a quarter before nine p.m. ; or else the twenty thousand pounds , now deposited in my name at <NAME> 's , will belong to you , in fact and in right , gentlemen .
Here is a cheque for the amount . ''
A memorandum of the wager was at once drawn up and signed by the six parties , during which <NAME> preserved a stoical composure .
He certainly did not bet to win , and had only staked the twenty thousand pounds , half of his fortune , because he foresaw that he might have to expend the other half to carry out this difficult , not to say unattainable , project .
As for his antagonists , they seemed much agitated ; not so much by the value of their stake , as because they had some scruples about betting under conditions so difficult to their friend .
The clock struck seven , and the party offered to suspend the game so that <NAME> might make his preparations for departure .
`` I am quite ready now , '' was his tranquil response .
`` Diamonds are trumps : be so good as to play , gentlemen . ''
Having won twenty guineas at whist , and taken leave of his friends , <NAME> , at twenty-five minutes past seven , left the <NAME> .
<NAME> , who had conscientiously studied the programme of his duties , was more than surprised to see his master guilty of the inexactness of appearing at this unaccustomed hour ; for , according to rule , he was not due in <NAME> Row until precisely midnight .
<NAME> <NAME> repaired to his bedroom , and called out , `` Passepartout ! ''
It could not be he who was called ; it was not the right hour .
repeated <NAME> , without raising his voice .
`` I 've called you twice , '' observed his master .
`` But it is not midnight , '' responded the other , showing his watch .
`` I know it ; I do n't blame you .
We start for <NAME> and <NAME> in ten minutes . ''
A puzzled grin overspread <NAME> 's round face ; clearly he had not comprehended his master .
`` Monsieur is going to leave home ? ''
`` We are going round the world . ''
<NAME> opened wide his eyes , raised his eyebrows , held up his hands , and seemed about to collapse , so overcome was he with stupefied astonishment .
`` In eighty days , '' responded <NAME> .
`` So we have n't a moment to lose . ''
gasped <NAME> , unconsciously swaying his head from right to left .
`` We 'll have no trunks ; only a carpet-bag , with two shirts and three pairs of stockings for me , and the same for you .
We 'll buy our clothes on the way .
Bring down my mackintosh and traveling-cloak , and some stout shoes , though we shall do little walking .
Passepartout tried to reply , but could not .
He went out , mounted to his own room , fell into a chair , and muttered : `` That 's good , that is !
And I , who wanted to remain quiet ! ''
He mechanically set about making the preparations for departure .
Around the world in eighty days !
Was his master a fool ?
<NAME> this a joke , then ?
They were going to <NAME> ; good !
After all , <NAME> , who had been away from <NAME> five years , would not be sorry to set foot on his native soil again .
Perhaps they would go as far as <NAME> , and it would do his eyes good to see <NAME> once more .
But surely a gentleman so chary of his steps would stop there ; no doubt -- but , then , it was none the less true that he was going away , this so domestic person hitherto !
By eight o'clock <NAME> had packed the modest carpet-bag , containing the wardrobes of his master and himself ; then , still troubled in mind , he carefully shut the door of his room , and descended to <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> was quite ready .
Under his arm might have been observed a red-bound copy of <NAME> 's <NAME> and <NAME> , with its timetables showing the arrival and departure of steamers and railways .
He took the carpet-bag , opened it , and slipped into it a goodly roll of <NAME> of <NAME> notes , which would pass wherever he might go .
Take this carpet-bag , '' handing it to <NAME> .
`` Take good care of it , for there are twenty thousand pounds in it . ''
<NAME> nearly dropped the bag , as if the twenty thousand pounds were in gold , and weighed him down .
<NAME> and man then descended , the street-door was double-locked , and at the end of <NAME> they took a cab and drove rapidly to Charing Cross .
The cab stopped before the railway station at twenty minutes past eight .
<NAME> jumped off the box and followed his master , who , after paying the cabman , was about to enter the station , when a poor beggar-woman , with a child in her arms , her naked feet smeared with mud , her head covered with a wretched bonnet , from which hung a tattered feather , and her shoulders shrouded in a ragged shawl , approached , and mournfully asked for alms .
<NAME> <NAME> took out the twenty guineas he had just won at whist , and handed them to the beggar , saying , `` Here , my good woman .
I 'm glad that I met you ; '' and passed on .
<NAME> had a moist sensation about the eyes ; his master 's action touched his susceptible heart .
Two first-class tickets for <NAME> having been speedily purchased , <NAME> was crossing the station to the train , when he perceived his five friends of the <NAME> .
`` Well , gentlemen , '' said he , `` I 'm off , you see ; and , if you will examine my passport when I get back , you will be able to judge whether I have accomplished the journey agreed upon . ''
`` Oh , that would be quite unnecessary , <NAME> , '' said <NAME> politely .
`` We will trust your word , as a gentleman of honour . ''
`` You do not forget when you are due in <NAME> again ? ''
`` In eighty days ; on Saturday , the 21st of December , 1872 , at a quarter before nine p.m. Good-bye , gentlemen . ''
<NAME> <NAME> and his servant seated themselves in a first-class carriage at twenty minutes before nine ; five minutes later the whistle screamed , and the train slowly glided out of the station .
The night was dark , and a fine , steady rain was falling .
<NAME> <NAME> , snugly ensconced in his corner , did not open his lips .
<NAME> , not yet recovered from his stupefaction , clung mechanically to the carpet-bag , with its enormous treasure .
Just as the train was whirling through <NAME> , <NAME> suddenly uttered a cry of despair .
In my hurry -- I -- I forgot -- '' `` What ? ''
`` To turn off the gas in my room ! ''
`` Very well , young man , '' returned <NAME> , coolly ; `` it will burn -- at your expense . ''
<NAME> <NAME> rightly suspected that his departure from <NAME> would create a lively sensation at the <NAME> .
The news of the bet spread through the <NAME> , and afforded an exciting topic of conversation to its members .
From the club it soon got into the papers throughout <NAME> .
The boasted `` tour of the world '' was talked about , disputed , argued with as much warmth as if the subject were another Alabama claim .
Some took sides with <NAME> , but the large majority shook their heads and declared against him ; it was absurd , impossible , they declared , that the tour of the world could be made , except theoretically and on paper , in this minimum of time , and with the existing means of travelling .
The <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , and twenty other highly respectable newspapers scouted <NAME> 's project as madness ; the <NAME> alone hesitatingly supported him .
People in general thought him a lunatic , and blamed his <NAME> friends for having accepted a wager which betrayed the mental aberration of its proposer .
<NAME> no less passionate than logical appeared on the question , for geography is one of the pet subjects of the <NAME> ; and the columns devoted to <NAME> 's venture were eagerly devoured by all classes of readers .
At first some rash individuals , principally of the gentler sex , espoused his cause , which became still more popular when the <NAME> came out with his portrait , copied from a photograph in the <NAME> .
A few readers of the <NAME> even dared to say , `` Why not , after all ?
<NAME> things have come to pass . ''
At last a long article appeared , on the 7th of October , in the bulletin of the <NAME> , which treated the question from every point of view , and demonstrated the utter folly of the enterprise .
Everything , it said , was against the travellers , every obstacle imposed alike by man and by nature .
A miraculous agreement of the times of departure and arrival , which was impossible , was absolutely necessary to his success .
He might , perhaps , reckon on the arrival of trains at the designated hours , in <NAME> , where the distances were relatively moderate ; but when he calculated upon crossing <NAME> in three days , and the <NAME> in seven , could he rely beyond misgiving upon accomplishing his task ?
There were accidents to machinery , the liability of trains to run off the line , collisions , bad weather , the blocking up by snow -- were not all these against <NAME> ?
Would he not find himself , when travelling by steamer in winter , at the mercy of the winds and fogs ?
Is it uncommon for the best ocean steamers to be two or three days behind time ?
But a single delay would suffice to fatally break the chain of communication ; should Phileas <NAME> once miss , even by an hour ; a steamer , he would have to wait for the next , and that would irrevocably render his attempt vain .
This article made a great deal of noise , and , being copied into all the papers , seriously depressed the advocates of the rash tourist .
Everybody knows that <NAME> is the world of betting men , who are of a higher class than mere gamblers ; to bet is in the <NAME> temperament .
Not only the members of the <NAME> , but the general public , made heavy wagers for or against <NAME> , who was set down in the betting books as if he were a race-horse .
Bonds were issued , and made their appearance on 'Change ; `` <NAME> bonds '' were offered at par or at a premium , and a great business was done in them .
But five days after the article in the bulletin of the <NAME> appeared , the demand began to subside : `` <NAME> '' declined .
They were offered by packages , at first of five , then of ten , until at last nobody would take less than twenty , fifty , a hundred !
<NAME> <NAME> , an elderly paralytic gentleman , was now the only advocate of <NAME> left .
This noble lord , who was fastened to his chair , would have given his fortune to be able to make the tour of the world , if it took ten years ; and he bet five thousand pounds on <NAME> .
When the folly as well as the uselessness of the adventure was pointed out to him , he contented himself with replying , `` If the thing is feasible , the first to do it ought to be an Englishman . ''
The <NAME> party dwindled more and more , everybody was going against him , and the bets stood a hundred and fifty and two hundred to one ; and a week after his departure an incident occurred which deprived him of backers at any price .
The commissioner of police was sitting in his office at nine o'clock one evening , when the following telegraphic dispatch was put into his hands : Suez to <NAME> .
<NAME> , <NAME> of Police , <NAME> Yard : I 've found the bank robber , <NAME> .
Send with out delay warrant of arrest to <NAME> .
The effect of this dispatch was instantaneous .
The polished gentleman disappeared to give place to the bank robber .
His photograph , which was hung with those of the rest of the members at the <NAME> , was minutely examined , and it betrayed , feature by feature , the description of the robber which had been provided to the police .
The mysterious habits of <NAME> were recalled ; his solitary ways , his sudden departure ; and it seemed clear that , in undertaking a tour round the world on the pretext of a wager , he had had no other end in view than to elude the detectives , and throw them off his track .
The circumstances under which this telegraphic dispatch about <NAME> was sent were as follows : The steamer <NAME> , belonging to the <NAME> and <NAME> , built of iron , of two thousand eight hundred tons burden , and five hundred horse-power , was due at eleven o'clock a.m. on Wednesday , the 9th of October , at <NAME> .
The <NAME> plied regularly between <NAME> and <NAME> via the <NAME> , and was one of the fastest steamers belonging to the company , always making more than ten knots an hour between <NAME> and <NAME> , and nine and a half between <NAME> and <NAME> .
Two men were promenading up and down the wharves , among the crowd of natives and strangers who were sojourning at this once straggling village -- now , thanks to the enterprise of M. <NAME> , a fast-growing town .
One was the <NAME> consul at <NAME> , who , despite the prophecies of the <NAME> Government , and the unfavourable predictions of <NAME> , was in the habit of seeing , from his office window , <NAME> ships daily passing to and fro on the great canal , by which the old roundabout route from <NAME> to <NAME> by the Cape of <NAME> was abridged by at least a half .
The other was a small , slight-built personage , with a nervous , intelligent face , and bright eyes peering out from under eyebrows which he was incessantly twitching .
He was just now manifesting unmistakable signs of impatience , nervously pacing up and down , and unable to stand still for a moment .
This was <NAME> , one of the detectives who had been dispatched from <NAME> in search of the bank robber ; it was his task to narrowly watch every passenger who arrived at <NAME> , and to follow up all who seemed to be suspicious characters , or bore a resemblance to the description of the criminal , which he had received two days before from the police headquarters at <NAME> .
The detective was evidently inspired by the hope of obtaining the splendid reward which would be the prize of success , and awaited with a feverish impatience , easy to understand , the arrival of the steamer <NAME> .
`` So you say , consul , '' asked he for the twentieth time , `` that this steamer is never behind time ? ''
`` She was bespoken yesterday at <NAME> , and the rest of the way is of no account to such a craft .
I repeat that the <NAME> has been in advance of the time required by the company 's regulations , and gained the prize awarded for excess of speed . ''
`` Does she come directly from <NAME> ? ''
`` Directly from <NAME> ; she takes on the <NAME> mails there , and she left there Saturday at five p.m. Have patience , Mr .
<NAME> ; she will not be late .
But really , I do n't see how , from the description you have , you will be able to recognise your man , even if he is on board the <NAME> . ''
`` A man rather feels the presence of these fellows , consul , than recognises them .
You must have a scent for them , and a scent is like a sixth sense which combines hearing , seeing , and smelling .
I 've arrested more than one of these gentlemen in my time , and , if my thief is on board , I 'll answer for it ; he 'll not slip through my fingers . ''
<NAME> , for it was a heavy robbery . ''
`` A magnificent robbery , consul ; fifty-five thousand pounds !
We do n't often have such windfalls .
Burglars are getting to be so contemptible nowadays !
A fellow gets hung for a handful of shillings ! ''
<NAME> , '' said the consul , `` I like your way of talking , and hope you 'll succeed ; but I fear you will find it far from easy .
Do n't you see , the description which you have there has a singular resemblance to an honest man ? ''
`` Consul , '' remarked the detective , dogmatically , `` great robbers always resemble honest folks .
Fellows who have rascally faces have only one course to take , and that is to remain honest ; otherwise they would be arrested off-hand .
The artistic thing is , to unmask honest countenances ; it 's no light task , I admit , but a real art . ''
Fix evidently was not wanting in a tinge of self-conceit .
<NAME> by little the scene on the quay became more animated ; sailors of various nations , merchants , ship-brokers , porters , fellahs , bustled to and fro as if the steamer were immediately expected .
The weather was clear , and slightly chilly .
The minarets of the town loomed above the houses in the pale rays of the sun .
A jetty pier , some two thousand yards along , extended into the roadstead .
A number of fishing-smacks and coasting boats , some retaining the fantastic fashion of ancient galleys , were discernible on the <NAME> .
As he passed among the busy crowd , <NAME> , according to habit , scrutinised the passers-by with a keen , rapid glance .
It was now half-past ten .
he exclaimed , as the port clock struck .
`` She ca n't be far off now , '' returned his companion .
`` How long will she stop at <NAME> ? ''
`` Four hours ; long enough to get in her coal .
It is thirteen hundred and ten miles from <NAME> to <NAME> , at the other end of the <NAME> , and she has to take in a fresh coal supply . ''
`` And does she go from <NAME> directly to <NAME> ? ''
`` If the robber is on board he will no doubt get off at <NAME> , so as to reach the <NAME> or <NAME> colonies in <NAME> by some other route .
He ought to know that he would not be safe an hour in <NAME> , which is <NAME> soil . ''
`` Unless , '' objected the consul , `` he is exceptionally shrewd .
An <NAME> criminal , you know , is always better concealed in <NAME> than anywhere else . ''
This observation furnished the detective food for thought , and meanwhile the consul went away to his office .
<NAME> , left alone , was more impatient than ever , having a presentiment that the robber was on board the <NAME> .
If he had indeed left <NAME> intending to reach the <NAME> , he would naturally take the route via <NAME> , which was less watched and more difficult to watch than that of the <NAME> .
But <NAME> 's reflections were soon interrupted by a succession of sharp whistles , which announced the arrival of the <NAME> .
The porters and fellahs rushed down the quay , and a dozen boats pushed off from the shore to go and meet the steamer .
Soon her gigantic hull appeared passing along between the banks , and eleven o'clock struck as she anchored in the road .
She brought an unusual number of passengers , some of whom remained on deck to scan the picturesque panorama of the town , while the greater part disembarked in the boats , and landed on the quay .
Fix took up a position , and carefully examined each face and figure which made its appearance .
Presently one of the passengers , after vigorously pushing his way through the importunate crowd of porters , came up to him and politely asked if he could point out the <NAME> consulate , at the same time showing a passport which he wished to have visaed .
Fix instinctively took the passport , and with a rapid glance read the description of its bearer .
An involuntary motion of surprise nearly escaped him , for the description in the passport was identical with that of the bank robber which he had received from <NAME> .
`` And your master is -- '' `` He stayed on board . ''
`` But he must go to the consul 's in person , so as to establish his identity . ''
`` And where is the consulate ? ''
`` There , on the corner of the square , '' said <NAME> , pointing to a house two hundred steps off .
`` I 'll go and fetch my master , who wo n't be much pleased , however , to be disturbed . ''
The passenger bowed to <NAME> , and returned to the steamer .
The detective passed down the quay , and rapidly made his way to the consul 's office , where he was at once admitted to the presence of that official .
`` Consul , '' said he , without preamble , `` I have strong reasons for believing that my man is a passenger on the <NAME> . ''
And he narrated what had just passed concerning the passport .
<NAME> , '' replied the consul , `` I shall not be sorry to see the rascal 's face ; but perhaps he wo n't come here -- that is , if he is the person you suppose him to be .
A robber does n't quite like to leave traces of his flight behind him ; and , besides , he is not obliged to have his passport countersigned . ''
`` If he is as shrewd as I think he is , consul , he will come . ''
`` To have his passport visaed ? ''
Passports are only good for annoying honest folks , and aiding in the flight of rogues .
I assure you it will be quite the thing for him to do ; but I hope you will not visa the passport . ''
If the passport is genuine I have no right to refuse . ''
`` Still , I must keep this man here until I can get a warrant to arrest him from <NAME> . ''
But I can not -- '' The consul did not finish his sentence , for as he spoke a knock was heard at the door , and two strangers entered , one of whom was the servant whom <NAME> had met on the quay .
The other , who was his master , held out his passport with the request that the consul would do him the favour to visa it .
The consul took the document and carefully read it , whilst <NAME> observed , or rather devoured , the stranger with his eyes from a corner of the room .
`` You are <NAME> ? ''
said the consul , after reading the passport .
`` And this man is your servant ? ''
`` He is : a <NAME> , named Passepartout . ''
`` And you are going -- '' `` To <NAME> . ''
You know that a visa is useless , and that no passport is required ? ''
`` I know it , sir , '' replied <NAME> ; `` but I wish to prove , by your visa , that I came by <NAME> . ''
The consul proceeded to sign and date the passport , after which he added his official seal .
<NAME> <NAME> paid the customary fee , coldly bowed , and went out , followed by his servant .
`` Well , he looks and acts like a perfectly honest man , '' replied the consul .
`` Possibly ; but that is not the question .
Do you think , consul , that this phlegmatic gentleman resembles , feature by feature , the robber whose description I have received ? ''
`` I concede that ; but then , you know , all descriptions -- '' `` I 'll make certain of it , '' interrupted <NAME> .
`` The servant seems to me less mysterious than the master ; besides , he 's a <NAME> , and ca n't help talking .
Excuse me for a little while , consul . ''
<NAME> started off in search of <NAME> .
Meanwhile <NAME> , after leaving the consulate , repaired to the quay , gave some orders to <NAME> , went off to the <NAME> in a boat , and descended to his cabin .
He took up his note-book , which contained the following memoranda : `` <NAME> , Wednesday , October 2nd , at 8.45 p.m. `` <NAME> , Thursday , October 3rd , at 7.20 a.m. `` <NAME> , Thursday , at 8.40 a.m. `` Reached <NAME> by <NAME> , Friday , October 4th , at 6.35 a.m. `` <NAME> , Friday , at 7.20 a.m. `` Arrived at <NAME> , Saturday , October 5th , at 4 p.m. `` Sailed on the <NAME> , Saturday , at 5 p.m. `` <NAME> , Wednesday , October 9th , at 11 a.m. `` Total of hours spent , 158+ ; or , in days , six days and a half . ''
These dates were inscribed in an itinerary divided into columns , indicating the month , the day of the month , and the day for the stipulated and actual arrivals at each principal point <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> -- from the 2nd of October to the 21st of <NAME> ; and giving a space for setting down the gain made or the loss suffered on arrival at each locality .
This methodical record thus contained an account of everything needed , and <NAME> always knew whether he was behind-hand or in advance of his time .
On this Friday , October 9th , he noted his arrival at <NAME> , and observed that he had as yet neither gained nor lost .
He sat down quietly to breakfast in his cabin , never once thinking of inspecting the town , being one of those Englishmen who are wont to see foreign countries through the eyes of their domestics .
Fix soon rejoined <NAME> , who was lounging and looking about on the quay , as if he did not feel that he , at least , was obliged not to see anything .
`` Well , my friend , '' said the detective , coming up with him , `` is your passport visaed ? ''
`` Ah , it 's you , is it , monsieur ? ''
`` Thanks , yes , the passport is all right . ''
`` And you are looking about you ? ''
`` Yes ; but we travel so fast that I seem to be journeying in a dream .
`` Just think , monsieur , I had no idea that we should go farther than <NAME> ; and all that I saw of <NAME> was between twenty minutes past seven and twenty minutes before nine in the morning , between the <NAME> and the Lyons stations , through the windows of a car , and in a driving rain !
How I regret not having seen once more <NAME> la Chaise and the circus in the <NAME> ! ''
`` You are in a great hurry , then ? ''
`` I am not , but my master is .
By the way , I must buy some shoes and shirts .
We came away without trunks , only with a carpet-bag . ''
`` I will show you an excellent shop for getting what you want . ''
`` Really , monsieur , you are very kind . ''
And they walked off together , Passepartout chatting volubly as they went along .
`` Above all , '' said he ; `` do n't let me lose the steamer . ''
`` You have plenty of time ; it 's only twelve o'clock . ''
<NAME> pulled out his big watch .
he exclaimed ; `` why , it 's only eight minutes before ten . ''
A family watch , monsieur , which has come down from my great-grandfather !
It does n't vary five minutes in the year .
It 's a perfect chronometer , look you . ''
`` I see how it is , '' said <NAME> .
`` You have kept <NAME> time , which is two hours behind that of <NAME> .
You ought to regulate your watch at noon in each country . ''
`` Well , then , it will not agree with the sun . ''
`` So much the worse for the sun , monsieur .
The sun will be wrong , then ! ''
And the worthy fellow returned the watch to its fob with a defiant gesture .
After a few minutes silence , <NAME> resumed : `` You left <NAME> hastily , then ? ''
Last Friday at eight o'clock in the evening , <NAME> came home from his club , and three-quarters of an hour afterwards we were off . ''
`` But where is your master going ? ''
He is going round the world . ''
`` Yes , and in eighty days !
He says it is on a wager ; but , between us , I do n't believe a word of it .
That would n't be common sense .
There 's something else in the wind . ''
<NAME> <NAME> is a character , is he ? ''
`` I should say he was . ''
`` No doubt , for he is carrying an enormous sum in brand new banknotes with him .
And he does n't spare the money on the way , either : he has offered a large reward to the engineer of the <NAME> if he gets us to <NAME> well in advance of time . ''
`` And you have known your master a long time ? ''
`` Why , no ; I entered his service the very day we left <NAME> . ''
The effect of these replies upon the already suspicious and excited detective may be imagined .
The hasty departure from <NAME> soon after the robbery ; the large sum carried by <NAME> ; his eagerness to reach distant countries ; the pretext of an eccentric and foolhardy bet -- all confirmed Fix in his theory .
He continued to pump poor Passepartout , and learned that he really knew little or nothing of his master , who lived a solitary existence in <NAME> , was said to be rich , though no one knew whence came his riches , and was mysterious and impenetrable in his affairs and habits .
<NAME> felt sure that <NAME> would not land at <NAME> , but was really going on to <NAME> .
`` Is <NAME> far from here ? ''
It is a ten days ' voyage by sea . ''
`` And in what country is <NAME> ? ''
I was going to tell you there 's one thing that worries me -- my burner ! ''
`` My gas-burner , which I forgot to turn off , and which is at this moment burning at my expense .
I have calculated , monsieur , that I lose two shillings every four and twenty hours , exactly sixpence more than I earn ; and you will understand that the longer our journey -- '' Did Fix pay any attention to <NAME> 's trouble about the gas ?
He was not listening , but was cogitating a project .
<NAME> and he had now reached the shop , where <NAME> left his companion to make his purchases , after recommending him not to miss the steamer , and hurried back to the consulate .
Now that he was fully convinced , <NAME> had quite recovered his equanimity .
`` Consul , '' said he , `` I have no longer any doubt .
I have spotted my man .
He passes himself off as an odd stick who is going round the world in eighty days . ''
`` Then he 's a sharp fellow , '' returned the consul , `` and counts on returning to <NAME> after putting the police of the two countries off his track . ''
`` We 'll see about that , '' replied <NAME> .
`` But are you not mistaken ? ''
`` Why was this robber so anxious to prove , by the visa , that he had passed through <NAME> ? ''
I have no idea ; but listen to me . ''
He reported in a few words the most important parts of his conversation with <NAME> .
`` In short , '' said the consul , `` appearances are wholly against this man .
And what are you going to do ? ''
`` Send a dispatch to <NAME> for a warrant of arrest to be dispatched instantly to <NAME> , take passage on board the <NAME> , follow my rogue to <NAME> , and there , on <NAME> ground , arrest him politely , with my warrant in my hand , and my hand on his shoulder . ''
Having uttered these words with a cool , careless air , the detective took leave of the consul , and repaired to the telegraph office , whence he sent the dispatch which we have seen to the <NAME> police office .
A quarter of an hour later found <NAME> , with a small bag in his hand , proceeding on board the <NAME> ; and , ere many moments longer , the noble steamer rode out at full steam upon the waters of the <NAME> .
The distance between <NAME> and <NAME> is precisely thirteen hundred and ten miles , and the regulations of the company allow the steamers one hundred and thirty-eight hours in which to traverse it .
The <NAME> , thanks to the vigorous exertions of the engineer , seemed likely , so rapid was her speed , to reach her destination considerably within that time .
The greater part of the passengers from <NAME> were bound for <NAME> some for <NAME> , others for <NAME> by way of <NAME> , the nearest route thither , now that a railway crosses the <NAME> peninsula .
Among the passengers was a number of officials and military officers of various grades , the latter being either attached to the regular <NAME> forces or commanding the Sepoy troops , and receiving high salaries ever since the central government has assumed the powers of the <NAME> Company : for the sub-lieutenants get 280 pounds , brigadiers , 2,400 pounds , and generals of divisions , 4,000 pounds .
What with the military men , a number of rich young Englishmen on their travels , and the hospitable efforts of the purser , the time passed quickly on the <NAME> .
The best of fare was spread upon the cabin tables at breakfast , lunch , dinner , and the eight o'clock supper , and the ladies scrupulously changed their toilets twice a day ; and the hours were whirled away , when the sea was tranquil , with music , dancing , and games .
But the <NAME> is full of caprice , and often boisterous , like most long and narrow gulfs .
When the wind came from the <NAME> or <NAME> coast the <NAME> , with her long hull , rolled fearfully .
Then the ladies speedily disappeared below ; the pianos were silent ; singing and dancing suddenly ceased .
Yet the good ship ploughed straight on , unretarded by wind or wave , towards the straits of Bab-el-Mandeb .
What was <NAME> doing all this time ?
It might be thought that , in his anxiety , he would be constantly watching the changes of the wind , the disorderly raging of the billows -- every chance , in short , which might force the <NAME> to slacken her speed , and thus interrupt his journey .
But , if he thought of these possibilities , he did not betray the fact by any outward sign .
Always the same impassible member of the <NAME> , whom no incident could surprise , as unvarying as the ship 's chronometers , and seldom having the curiosity even to go upon the deck , he passed through the memorable scenes of the <NAME> with cold indifference ; did not care to recognise the historic towns and villages which , along its borders , raised their picturesque outlines against the sky ; and betrayed no fear of the dangers of the <NAME> , which the old historians always spoke of with horror , and upon which the ancient navigators never ventured without propitiating the gods by ample sacrifices .
How did this eccentric personage pass his time on the <NAME> ?
He made his four hearty meals every day , regardless of the most persistent rolling and pitching on the part of the steamer ; and he played whist indefatigably , for he had found partners as enthusiastic in the game as himself .
A tax-collector , on the way to his post at <NAME> ; the Rev .
<NAME> <NAME> , returning to his parish at <NAME> ; and a brigadier-general of the <NAME> army , who was about to rejoin his brigade at <NAME> , made up the party , and , with <NAME> , played whist by the hour together in absorbing silence .
As for <NAME> , he , too , had escaped sea-sickness , and took his meals conscientiously in the forward cabin .
He rather enjoyed the voyage , for he was well fed and well lodged , took a great interest in the scenes through which they were passing , and consoled himself with the delusion that his master 's whim would end at <NAME> .
He was pleased , on the day after leaving <NAME> , to find on deck the obliging person with whom he had walked and chatted on the quays .
`` If I am not mistaken , '' said he , approaching this person , with his most amiable smile , `` you are the gentleman who so kindly volunteered to guide me at <NAME> ? ''
You are the servant of the strange Englishman -- '' `` Just so , monsieur -- '' `` Fix . ''
`` <NAME> , '' resumed <NAME> , `` I 'm charmed to find you on board .
Have you made this trip before ? ''
I am one of the agents of the <NAME> . ''
`` Why yes , '' replied <NAME> , who spoke cautiously .
`` A curious place , this <NAME> ? ''
<NAME> , minarets , temples , fakirs , pagodas , tigers , snakes , elephants !
I hope you will have ample time to see the sights . ''
`` I hope so , <NAME> .
You see , a man of sound sense ought not to spend his life jumping from a steamer upon a railway train , and from a railway train upon a steamer again , pretending to make the tour of the world in eighty days !
No ; all these gymnastics , you may be sure , will cease at <NAME> . ''
`` And <NAME> is getting on well ? ''
asked <NAME> , in the most natural tone in the world .
`` Quite well , and I too .
I eat like a famished ogre ; it 's the sea air . ''
`` But I never see your master on deck . ''
`` Never ; he has n't the least curiosity . ''
`` Do you know , <NAME> , that this pretended tour in eighty days may conceal some secret errand -- perhaps a diplomatic mission ? ''
`` <NAME> , <NAME> , I assure you I know nothing about it , nor would I give half a crown to find out . ''
After this meeting , <NAME> and <NAME> got into the habit of chatting together , the latter making it a point to gain the worthy man 's confidence .
He frequently offered him a glass of whiskey or pale ale in the steamer bar-room , which Passepartout never failed to accept with graceful alacrity , mentally pronouncing Fix the best of good fellows .
Meanwhile the <NAME> was pushing forward rapidly ; on the 13th , <NAME> , surrounded by its ruined walls whereon date-trees were growing , was sighted , and on the mountains beyond were espied vast coffee-fields .
<NAME> was ravished to behold this celebrated place , and thought that , with its circular walls and dismantled fort , it looked like an immense coffee-cup and saucer .
The following night they passed through the <NAME> of Bab-el-Mandeb , which means in <NAME> The Bridge of <NAME> , and the next day they put in at <NAME> , north-west of <NAME> harbour , to take in coal .
This matter of fuelling steamers is a serious one at such distances from the coal-mines ; it costs the <NAME> Company some eight hundred thousand pounds a year .
In these distant seas , coal is worth three or four pounds sterling a ton .
The <NAME> had still sixteen hundred and fifty miles to traverse before reaching <NAME> , and was obliged to remain four hours at <NAME> to coal up .
But this delay , as it was foreseen , did not affect <NAME> 's programme ; besides , the <NAME> , instead of reaching <NAME> on the morning of the 15th , when she was due , arrived there on the evening of the 14th , a gain of fifteen hours .
<NAME> <NAME> and his servant went ashore at <NAME> to have the passport again visaed ; <NAME> , unobserved , followed them .
The visa procured , <NAME> returned on board to resume his former habits ; while <NAME> , according to custom , sauntered about among the mixed population of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and Europeans who comprise the twenty-five thousand inhabitants of <NAME> .
He gazed with wonder upon the fortifications which make this place the <NAME> of the <NAME> , and the vast cisterns where the <NAME> engineers were still at work , two thousand years after the engineers of <NAME> .
`` Very curious , very curious , '' said <NAME> to himself , on returning to the steamer .
`` I see that it is by no means useless to travel , if a man wants to see something new . ''
At six p.m. the <NAME> slowly moved out of the roadstead , and was soon once more on the <NAME> <NAME> .
She had a hundred and sixty-eight hours in which to reach <NAME> , and the sea was favourable , the wind being in the north-west , and all sails aiding the engine .
The steamer rolled but little , the ladies , in fresh toilets , reappeared on deck , and the singing and dancing were resumed .
The trip was being accomplished most successfully , and <NAME> was enchanted with the congenial companion which chance had secured him in the person of the delightful Fix .
On Sunday , October 20th , towards noon , they came in sight of the <NAME> coast : two hours later the pilot came on board .
A range of hills lay against the sky in the horizon , and soon the rows of palms which adorn <NAME> came distinctly into view .
The steamer entered the road formed by the islands in the bay , and at half-past four she hauled up at the quays of <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> was in the act of finishing the thirty-third rubber of the voyage , and his partner and himself having , by a bold stroke , captured all thirteen of the tricks , concluded this fine campaign with a brilliant victory .
The <NAME> was due at <NAME> on the 22nd ; she arrived on the 20th .
This was a gain to <NAME> of two days since his departure from <NAME> , and he calmly entered the fact in the itinerary , in the column of gains .
Everybody knows that the great reversed triangle of land , with its base in the north and its apex in the south , which is called <NAME> , embraces fourteen hundred thousand square miles , upon which is spread unequally a population of one hundred and eighty millions of souls .
The <NAME> Crown exercises a real and despotic dominion over the larger portion of this vast country , and has a governor-general stationed at <NAME> , governors at <NAME> , <NAME> , and in <NAME> , and a lieutenant-governor at <NAME> .
But <NAME> , properly so called , only embraces seven hundred thousand square miles , and a population of from one hundred to one hundred and ten millions of inhabitants .
A considerable portion of <NAME> is still free from <NAME> authority ; and there are certain ferocious rajahs in the interior who are absolutely independent .
The celebrated <NAME> Company was all-powerful from 1756 , when the <NAME> first gained a foothold on the spot where now stands the city of <NAME> , down to the time of the great Sepoy insurrection .
It gradually annexed province after province , purchasing them of the native chiefs , whom it seldom paid , and appointed the governor-general and his subordinates , civil and military .
But the <NAME> Company has now passed away , leaving the <NAME> possessions in <NAME> directly under the control of the <NAME> .
The aspect of the country , as well as the manners and distinctions of race , is daily changing .
Formerly one was obliged to travel in <NAME> by the old cumbrous methods of going on foot or on horseback , in palanquins or unwieldy coaches ; now fast steamboats ply on the <NAME> and the <NAME> , and a great railway , with branch lines joining the main line at many points on its route , traverses the peninsula from <NAME> to <NAME> in three days .
This railway does not run in a direct line across <NAME> .
The distance between <NAME> and <NAME> , as the bird flies , is only from one thousand to eleven hundred miles ; but the deflections of the road increase this distance by more than a third .
The general route of the <NAME> Indian <NAME> is as follows : Leaving <NAME> , it passes through <NAME> , crossing to the continent opposite <NAME> , goes over the chain of the <NAME> , runs thence north-east as far as <NAME> , skirts the nearly independent territory of <NAME> , ascends to <NAME> , turns thence eastwardly , meeting the <NAME> at <NAME> , then departs from the river a little , and , descending south-eastward by <NAME> and the <NAME> town of <NAME> , has its terminus at <NAME> .
The passengers of the <NAME> went ashore at half-past four p.m. ; at exactly eight the train would start for <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> , after bidding good-bye to his whist partners , left the steamer , gave his servant several errands to do , urged it upon him to be at the station promptly at eight , and , with his regular step , which beat to the second , like an astronomical clock , directed his steps to the passport office .
As for the wonders of <NAME> -- its famous city hall , its splendid library , its forts and docks , its bazaars , mosques , synagogues , its <NAME> churches , and the noble pagoda on <NAME> , with its two polygonal towers -- he cared not a straw to see them .
He would not deign to examine even the masterpieces of <NAME> , or the mysterious hypogea , concealed south-east from the docks , or those fine remains of <NAME> architecture , the <NAME> grottoes of the island of <NAME> .
Having transacted his business at the passport office , <NAME> repaired quietly to the railway station , where he ordered dinner .
Among the dishes served up to him , the landlord especially recommended a certain giblet of `` native rabbit , '' on which he prided himself .
<NAME> <NAME> accordingly tasted the dish , but , despite its spiced sauce , found it far from palatable .
He rang for the landlord , and , on his appearance , said , fixing his clear eyes upon him , `` Is this rabbit , sir ? ''
`` Yes , my lord , '' the rogue boldly replied , `` rabbit from the jungles . ''
`` And this rabbit did not mew when he was killed ? ''
I swear to you -- '' `` Be so good , landlord , as not to swear , but remember this : cats were formerly considered , in <NAME> , as sacred animals .
That was a good time . ''
`` For the cats , my lord ? ''
`` Perhaps for the travellers as well ! ''
After which <NAME> quietly continued his dinner .
<NAME> had gone on shore shortly after <NAME> , and his first destination was the headquarters of the <NAME> police .
He made himself known as a <NAME> detective , told his business at <NAME> , and the position of affairs relative to the supposed robber , and nervously asked if a warrant had arrived from <NAME> .
It had not reached the office ; indeed , there had not yet been time for it to arrive .
<NAME> was sorely disappointed , and tried to obtain an order of arrest from the director of the <NAME> police .
This the director refused , as the matter concerned the <NAME> office , which alone could legally deliver the warrant .
<NAME> did not insist , and was fain to resign himself to await the arrival of the important document ; but he was determined not to lose sight of the mysterious rogue as long as he stayed in <NAME> .
He did not doubt for a moment , any more than <NAME> , that <NAME> would remain there , at least until it was time for the warrant to arrive .
<NAME> , however , had no sooner heard his master 's orders on leaving the <NAME> than he saw at once that they were to leave <NAME> as they had done <NAME> and <NAME> , and that the journey would be extended at least as far as <NAME> , and perhaps beyond that place .
He began to ask himself if this bet that <NAME> talked about was not really in good earnest , and whether his fate was not in truth forcing him , despite his love of repose , around the world in eighty days !
Having purchased the usual quota of shirts and shoes , he took a leisurely promenade about the streets , where crowds of people of many nationalities -- Europeans , Persians with pointed caps , <NAME> with round turbans , <NAME> with square bonnets , <NAME> with black mitres , and long-robed Armenians -- were collected .
It happened to be the day of a <NAME> festival .
These descendants of the sect of Zoroaster -- the most thrifty , civilised , intelligent , and austere of the <NAME> , among whom are counted the richest native merchants of <NAME> -- were celebrating a sort of religious carnival , with processions and shows , in the midst of which <NAME> dancing-girls , clothed in rose-coloured gauze , looped up with gold and silver , danced airily , but with perfect modesty , to the sound of viols and the clanging of tambourines .
It is needless to say that <NAME> watched these curious ceremonies with staring eyes and gaping mouth , and that his countenance was that of the greenest booby imaginable .
Unhappily for his master , as well as himself , his curiosity drew him unconsciously farther off than he intended to go .
At last , having seen the <NAME> carnival wind away in the distance , he was turning his steps towards the station , when he happened to espy the splendid pagoda on <NAME> , and was seized with an irresistible desire to see its interior .
He was quite ignorant that it is forbidden to Christians to enter certain <NAME> temples , and that even the faithful must not go in without first leaving their shoes outside the door .
It may be said here that the wise policy of the <NAME> Government severely punishes a disregard of the practices of the native religions .
<NAME> , however , thinking no harm , went in like a simple tourist , and was soon lost in admiration of the splendid <NAME> ornamentation which everywhere met his eyes , when of a sudden he found himself sprawling on the sacred flagging .
He looked up to behold three enraged priests , who forthwith fell upon him ; tore off his shoes , and began to beat him with loud , savage exclamations .
The agile <NAME> was soon upon his feet again , and lost no time in knocking down two of his long-gowned adversaries with his fists and a vigorous application of his toes ; then , rushing out of the pagoda as fast as his legs could carry him , he soon escaped the third priest by mingling with the crowd in the streets .
At five minutes before eight , <NAME> , hatless , shoeless , and having in the squabble lost his package of shirts and shoes , rushed breathlessly into the station .
<NAME> , who had followed <NAME> to the station , and saw that he was really going to leave <NAME> , was there , upon the platform .
He had resolved to follow the supposed robber to <NAME> , and farther , if necessary .
<NAME> did not observe the detective , who stood in an obscure corner ; but <NAME> heard him relate his adventures in a few words to <NAME> .
`` I hope that this will not happen again , '' said <NAME> coldly , as he got into the train .
<NAME> <NAME> , quite crestfallen , followed his master without a word .
<NAME> was on the point of entering another carriage , when an idea struck him which induced him to alter his plan .
`` No , I 'll stay , '' muttered he .
`` An offence has been committed on <NAME> soil .
Just then the locomotive gave a sharp screech , and the train passed out into the darkness of the night .
The train had started punctually .
Among the passengers were a number of officers , Government officials , and opium and indigo merchants , whose business called them to the eastern coast .
<NAME> rode in the same carriage with his master , and a third passenger occupied a seat opposite to them .
This was <NAME> , one of <NAME> 's whist partners on the <NAME> , now on his way to join his corps at <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> was a tall , fair man of fifty , who had greatly distinguished himself in the last Sepoy revolt .
He made <NAME> his home , only paying brief visits to <NAME> at rare intervals ; and was almost as familiar as a native with the customs , history , and character of <NAME> and its people .
But <NAME> , who was not travelling , but only describing a circumference , took no pains to inquire into these subjects ; he was a solid body , traversing an orbit around the terrestrial globe , according to the laws of rational mechanics .
He was at this moment calculating in his mind the number of hours spent since his departure from <NAME> , and , had it been in his nature to make a useless demonstration , would have rubbed his hands for satisfaction .
<NAME> <NAME> had observed the oddity of his travelling companion -- although the only opportunity he had for studying him had been while he was dealing the cards , and between two rubbers -- and questioned himself whether a human heart really beat beneath this cold exterior , and whether <NAME> had any sense of the beauties of nature .
The brigadier-general was free to mentally confess that , of all the eccentric persons he had ever met , none was comparable to this product of the exact sciences .
<NAME> <NAME> had not concealed from <NAME> his design of going round the world , nor the circumstances under which he set out ; and the general only saw in the wager a useless eccentricity and a lack of sound common sense .
In the way this strange gentleman was going on , he would leave the world without having done any good to himself or anybody else .
An hour after leaving Bombay the train had passed the viaducts and the <NAME> of <NAME> , and had got into the open country .
At <NAME> they reached the junction of the branch line which descends towards south-eastern <NAME> by <NAME> and <NAME> ; and , passing <NAME> , they entered the defiles of the mountains , with their basalt bases , and their summits crowned with thick and verdant forests .
<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> exchanged a few words from time to time , and now <NAME> , reviving the conversation , observed , `` Some years ago , <NAME> , you would have met with a delay at this point which would probably have lost you your wager . ''
`` Because the railway stopped at the base of these mountains , which the passengers were obliged to cross in palanquins or on ponies to <NAME> , on the other side . ''
`` Such a delay would not have deranged my plans in the least , '' said <NAME> .
`` I have constantly foreseen the likelihood of certain obstacles . ''
`` But , <NAME> , '' pursued <NAME> , `` you run the risk of having some difficulty about this worthy fellow 's adventure at the pagoda . ''
<NAME> , his feet comfortably wrapped in his travelling-blanket , was sound asleep and did not dream that anybody was talking about him .
`` The Government is very severe upon that kind of offence .
It takes particular care that the religious customs of the <NAME> should be respected , and if your servant were caught -- '' `` Very well , <NAME> , '' replied <NAME> ; `` if he had been caught he would have been condemned and punished , and then would have quietly returned to <NAME> .
I do n't see how this affair could have delayed his master . ''
During the night the train left the mountains behind , and passed <NAME> , and the next day proceeded over the flat , well-cultivated country of the <NAME> , with its straggling villages , above which rose the minarets of the pagodas .
This fertile territory is watered by numerous small rivers and limpid streams , mostly tributaries of the Godavery .
<NAME> , on waking and looking out , could not realise that he was actually crossing <NAME> in a railway train .
The locomotive , guided by an <NAME> engineer and fed with <NAME> coal , threw out its smoke upon cotton , coffee , nutmeg , clove , and pepper plantations , while the steam curled in spirals around groups of palm-trees , in the midst of which were seen picturesque bungalows , viharis ( sort of abandoned monasteries ) , and marvellous temples enriched by the exhaustless ornamentation of <NAME> architecture .
Then they came upon vast tracts extending to the horizon , with jungles inhabited by snakes and tigers , which fled at the noise of the train ; succeeded by forests penetrated by the railway , and still haunted by elephants which , with pensive eyes , gazed at the train as it passed .
The travellers crossed , beyond <NAME> , the fatal country so often stained with blood by the sectaries of the goddess <NAME> .
Not far off rose <NAME> , with its graceful pagodas , and the famous Aurungabad , capital of the ferocious Aureng-Zeb , now the chief town of one of the detached provinces of the kingdom of the <NAME> .
It was thereabouts that <NAME> , the <NAME> chief , king of the stranglers , held his sway .
These ruffians , united by a secret bond , strangled victims of every age in honour of the goddess <NAME> , without ever shedding blood ; there was a period when this part of the country could scarcely be travelled over without corpses being found in every direction .
The <NAME> Government has succeeded in greatly diminishing these murders , though the <NAME> still exist , and pursue the exercise of their horrible rites .
At half-past twelve the train stopped at <NAME> where <NAME> was able to purchase some <NAME> slippers , ornamented with false pearls , in which , with evident vanity , he proceeded to encase his feet .
The travellers made a hasty breakfast and started off for <NAME> , after skirting for a little the banks of the small river <NAME> , which empties into the Gulf of <NAME> , near <NAME> .
<NAME> was now plunged into absorbing reverie .
Up to his arrival at <NAME> , he had entertained hopes that their journey would end there ; but , now that they were plainly whirling across <NAME> at full speed , a sudden change had come over the spirit of his dreams .
His old vagabond nature returned to him ; the fantastic ideas of his youth once more took possession of him .
He came to regard his master 's project as intended in good earnest , believed in the reality of the bet , and therefore in the tour of the world and the necessity of making it without fail within the designated period .
Already he began to worry about possible delays , and accidents which might happen on the way .
He recognised himself as being personally interested in the wager , and trembled at the thought that he might have been the means of losing it by his unpardonable folly of the night before .
Being much less cool-headed than <NAME> , he was much more restless , counting and recounting the days passed over , uttering maledictions when the train stopped , and accusing it of sluggishness , and mentally blaming <NAME> for not having bribed the engineer .
The worthy fellow was ignorant that , while it was possible by such means to hasten the rate of a steamer , it could not be done on the railway .
The train entered the defiles of the <NAME> , which separate the <NAME> from <NAME> , towards evening .
The next day <NAME> asked Passepartout what time it was ; to which , on consulting his watch , he replied that it was three in the morning .
This famous timepiece , always regulated on the <NAME> meridian , which was now some seventy-seven degrees westward , was at least four hours slow .
<NAME> <NAME> corrected <NAME> 's time , whereupon the latter made the same remark that he had done to <NAME> ; and upon the general insisting that the watch should be regulated in each new meridian , since he was constantly going eastward , that is in the face of the sun , and therefore the days were shorter by four minutes for each degree gone over , <NAME> obstinately refused to alter his watch , which he kept at <NAME> time .
It was an innocent delusion which could harm no one .
The train stopped , at eight o'clock , in the midst of a glade some fifteen miles beyond <NAME> , where there were several bungalows , and workmen 's cabins .
The conductor , passing along the carriages , shouted , `` Passengers will get out here ! ''
<NAME> <NAME> looked at <NAME> for an explanation ; but the general could not tell what meant a halt in the midst of this forest of dates and acacias .
<NAME> , not less surprised , rushed out and speedily returned , crying : `` Monsieur , no more railway ! ''
`` I mean to say that the train is n't going on . ''
The general at once stepped out , while <NAME> calmly followed him , and they proceeded together to the conductor .
`` At the hamlet of <NAME> . ''
There 's still a matter of fifty miles to be laid from here to <NAME> , where the line begins again . ''
`` But the papers announced the opening of the railway throughout . ''
`` What would you have , officer ?
`` Yet you sell tickets from <NAME> to <NAME> , '' retorted <NAME> , who was growing warm .
`` No doubt , '' replied the conductor ; `` but the passengers know that they must provide means of transportation for themselves from <NAME> to <NAME> . ''
<NAME> would willingly have knocked the conductor down , and did not dare to look at his master .
`` <NAME> , '' said <NAME> quietly , `` we will , if you please , look about for some means of conveyance to <NAME> . ''
`` <NAME> , this is a delay greatly to your disadvantage . ''
`` No , <NAME> ; it was foreseen . ''
You knew that the way -- '' `` Not at all ; but I knew that some obstacle or other would sooner or later arise on my route .
I have two days , which I have already gained , to sacrifice .
A steamer leaves <NAME> for <NAME> at noon , on the 25th .
This is the 22nd , and we shall reach <NAME> in time . ''
There was nothing to say to so confident a response .
It was but too true that the railway came to a termination at this point .
The papers were like some watches , which have a way of getting too fast , and had been premature in their announcement of the completion of the line .
The greater part of the travellers were aware of this interruption , and , leaving the train , they began to engage such vehicles as the village could provide four-wheeled palkigharis , waggons drawn by zebus , carriages that looked like perambulating pagodas , palanquins , ponies , and what not .
<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> , after searching the village from end to end , came back without having found anything .
`` I shall go afoot , '' said <NAME> .
<NAME> , who had now rejoined his master , made a wry grimace , as he thought of his magnificent , but too frail <NAME> shoes .
Happily he too had been looking about him , and , after a moment 's hesitation , said , `` Monsieur , I think I have found a means of conveyance . ''
An elephant that belongs to an Indian who lives but a hundred steps from here . ''
`` Let 's go and see the elephant , '' replied <NAME> .
They soon reached a small hut , near which , enclosed within some high palings , was the animal in question .
An <NAME> came out of the hut , and , at their request , conducted them within the enclosure .
The elephant , which its owner had reared , not for a beast of burden , but for warlike purposes , was half domesticated .
The <NAME> had begun already , by often irritating him , and feeding him every three months on sugar and butter , to impart to him a ferocity not in his nature , this method being often employed by those who train the <NAME> elephants for battle .
Happily , however , for <NAME> , the animal 's instruction in this direction had not gone far , and the elephant still preserved his natural gentleness .
<NAME> -- this was the name of the beast -- could doubtless travel rapidly for a long time , and , in default of any other means of conveyance , <NAME> resolved to hire him .
But elephants are far from cheap in <NAME> , where they are becoming scarce , the males , which alone are suitable for circus shows , are much sought , especially as but few of them are domesticated .
When therefore <NAME> proposed to the <NAME> to hire <NAME> , he refused point-blank .
<NAME> <NAME> persisted , offering the excessive sum of ten pounds an hour for the loan of the beast to <NAME> .
<NAME> jumped at each advance ; but the <NAME> declined to be tempted .
Yet the offer was an alluring one , for , supposing it took the elephant fifteen hours to reach <NAME> , his owner would receive no less than six hundred pounds sterling .
<NAME> <NAME> , without getting in the least flurried , then proposed to purchase the animal outright , and at first offered a thousand pounds for him .
The <NAME> , perhaps thinking he was going to make a great bargain , still refused .
<NAME> <NAME> took <NAME> aside , and begged him to reflect before he went any further ; to which that gentleman replied that he was not in the habit of acting rashly , that a bet of twenty thousand pounds was at stake , that the elephant was absolutely necessary to him , and that he would secure him if he had to pay twenty times his value .
Returning to the <NAME> , whose small , sharp eyes , glistening with avarice , betrayed that with him it was only a question of how great a price he could obtain .
<NAME> <NAME> offered first twelve hundred , then fifteen hundred , eighteen hundred , two thousand pounds .
<NAME> , usually so rubicund , was fairly white with suspense .
At two thousand pounds the <NAME> yielded .
`` What a price , good heavens ! ''
cried <NAME> , `` for an elephant . ''
It only remained now to find a guide , which was comparatively easy .
A young <NAME> , with an intelligent face , offered his services , which <NAME> accepted , promising so generous a reward as to materially stimulate his zeal .
The elephant was led out and equipped .
The <NAME> , who was an accomplished elephant driver , covered his back with a sort of saddle-cloth , and attached to each of his flanks some curiously uncomfortable howdahs .
<NAME> <NAME> paid the <NAME> with some banknotes which he extracted from the famous carpet-bag , a proceeding that seemed to deprive poor Passepartout of his vitals .
Then he offered to carry <NAME> to <NAME> , which the brigadier gratefully accepted , as one traveller the more would not be likely to fatigue the gigantic beast .
Provisions were purchased at <NAME> , and , while <NAME> and <NAME> took the howdahs on either side , <NAME> got astride the saddle-cloth between them .
The <NAME> perched himself on the elephant 's neck , and at nine o'clock they set out from the village , the animal marching off through the dense forest of palms by the shortest cut .
In order to shorten the journey , the guide passed to the left of the line where the railway was still in process of being built .
This line , owing to the capricious turnings of the <NAME> , did not pursue a straight course .
The <NAME> , who was quite familiar with the roads and paths in the district , declared that they would gain twenty miles by striking directly through the forest .
<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> , plunged to the neck in the peculiar howdahs provided for them , were horribly jostled by the swift trotting of the elephant , spurred on as he was by the skilful <NAME> ; but they endured the discomfort with true <NAME> phlegm , talking little , and scarcely able to catch a glimpse of each other .
As for <NAME> , who was mounted on the beast 's back , and received the direct force of each concussion as he trod along , he was very careful , in accordance with his master 's advice , to keep his tongue from between his teeth , as it would otherwise have been bitten off short .
The worthy fellow bounced from the elephant 's neck to his rump , and vaulted like a clown on a spring-board ; yet he laughed in the midst of his bouncing , and from time to time took a piece of sugar out of his pocket , and inserted it in <NAME> 's trunk , who received it without in the least slackening his regular trot .
After two hours the guide stopped the elephant , and gave him an hour for rest , during which <NAME> , after quenching his thirst at a neighbouring spring , set to devouring the branches and shrubs round about him .
Neither Sir Francis nor <NAME> regretted the delay , and both descended with a feeling of relief .
`` Why , he 's made of iron ! ''
exclaimed the general , gazing admiringly on <NAME> .
`` Of forged iron , '' replied <NAME> , as he set about preparing a hasty breakfast .
At noon the <NAME> gave the signal of departure .
The country soon presented a very savage aspect .
Copses of dates and dwarf-palms succeeded the dense forests ; then vast , dry plains , dotted with scanty shrubs , and sown with great blocks of syenite .
All this portion of <NAME> , which is little frequented by travellers , is inhabited by a fanatical population , hardened in the most horrible practices of the <NAME> faith .
The <NAME> have not been able to secure complete dominion over this territory , which is subjected to the influence of rajahs , whom it is almost impossible to reach in their inaccessible mountain fastnesses .
The travellers several times saw bands of ferocious Indians , who , when they perceived the elephant striding across-country , made angry and threatening motions .
The <NAME> avoided them as much as possible .
Few animals were observed on the route ; even the monkeys hurried from their path with contortions and grimaces which convulsed Passepartout with laughter .
In the midst of his gaiety , however , one thought troubled the worthy servant .
What would <NAME> do with the elephant when he got to <NAME> ?
Would he carry him on with him ?
The cost of transporting him would make him ruinously expensive .
Would he sell him , or set him free ?
The estimable beast certainly deserved some consideration .
Should <NAME> choose to make him , <NAME> , a present of <NAME> , he would be very much embarrassed ; and these thoughts did not cease worrying him for a long time .
The principal chain of the <NAME> was crossed by eight in the evening , and another halt was made on the northern slope , in a ruined bungalow .
They had gone nearly twenty-five miles that day , and an equal distance still separated them from the station of <NAME> .
The <NAME> lit a fire in the bungalow with a few dry branches , and the warmth was very grateful , provisions purchased at <NAME> sufficed for supper , and the travellers ate ravenously .
The conversation , beginning with a few disconnected phrases , soon gave place to loud and steady snores .
The guide watched <NAME> , who slept standing , bolstering himself against the trunk of a large tree .
<NAME> occurred during the night to disturb the slumberers , although occasional growls from panthers and chatterings of monkeys broke the silence ; the more formidable beasts made no cries or hostile demonstration against the occupants of the bungalow .
<NAME> <NAME> slept heavily , like an honest soldier overcome with fatigue .
<NAME> was wrapped in uneasy dreams of the bouncing of the day before .
As for <NAME> , he slumbered as peacefully as if he had been in his serene mansion in <NAME> Row .
The journey was resumed at six in the morning ; the guide hoped to reach <NAME> by evening .
In that case , <NAME> would only lose a part of the forty-eight hours saved since the beginning of the tour .
<NAME> , resuming his rapid gait , soon descended the lower spurs of the <NAME> , and towards noon they passed by the village of <NAME> , on the <NAME> , one of the branches of the <NAME> .
The guide avoided inhabited places , thinking it safer to keep the open country , which lies along the first depressions of the basin of the great river .
<NAME> was now only twelve miles to the north-east .
They stopped under a clump of bananas , the fruit of which , as healthy as bread and as succulent as cream , was amply partaken of and appreciated .
At two o'clock the guide entered a thick forest which extended several miles ; he preferred to travel under cover of the woods .
They had not as yet had any unpleasant encounters , and the journey seemed on the point of being successfully accomplished , when the elephant , becoming restless , suddenly stopped .
It was then four o'clock .
asked <NAME> , putting out his head .
`` I do n't know , officer , '' replied the <NAME> , listening attentively to a confused murmur which came through the thick branches .
The murmur soon became more distinct ; it now seemed like a distant concert of human voices accompanied by brass instruments .
<NAME> was all eyes and ears .
<NAME> <NAME> patiently waited without a word .
The <NAME> jumped to the ground , fastened the elephant to a tree , and plunged into the thicket .
He soon returned , saying : `` A procession of <NAME> is coming this way .
We must prevent their seeing us , if possible . ''
The guide unloosed the elephant and led him into a thicket , at the same time asking the travellers not to stir .
He held himself ready to bestride the animal at a moment 's notice , should flight become necessary ; but he evidently thought that the procession of the faithful would pass without perceiving them amid the thick foliage , in which they were wholly concealed .
The discordant tones of the voices and instruments drew nearer , and now droning songs mingled with the sound of the tambourines and cymbals .
The head of the procession soon appeared beneath the trees , a hundred paces away ; and the strange figures who performed the religious ceremony were easily distinguished through the branches .
First came the priests , with mitres on their heads , and clothed in long lace robes .
They were surrounded by men , women , and children , who sang a kind of lugubrious psalm , interrupted at regular intervals by the tambourines and cymbals ; while behind them was drawn a car with large wheels , the spokes of which represented serpents entwined with each other .
Upon the car , which was drawn by four richly caparisoned zebus , stood a hideous statue with four arms , the body coloured a dull red , with haggard eyes , dishevelled hair , protruding tongue , and lips tinted with betel .
It stood upright upon the figure of a prostrate and headless giant .
<NAME> <NAME> , recognising the statue , whispered , `` The goddess <NAME> ; the goddess of love and death . ''
`` Of death , perhaps , '' muttered back Passepartout , `` but of love -- that ugly old hag ?
The <NAME> made a motion to keep silence .
A group of old fakirs were capering and making a wild ado round the statue ; these were striped with ochre , and covered with cuts whence their blood issued drop by drop -- stupid fanatics , who , in the great <NAME> ceremonies , still throw themselves under the wheels of <NAME> .
Some <NAME> , clad in all the sumptuousness of <NAME> apparel , and leading a woman who faltered at every step , followed .
This woman was young , and as fair as a <NAME> .
Her head and neck , shoulders , ears , arms , hands , and toes were loaded down with jewels and gems with bracelets , earrings , and rings ; while a tunic bordered with gold , and covered with a light muslin robe , betrayed the outline of her form .
The guards who followed the young woman presented a violent contrast to her , armed as they were with naked sabres hung at their waists , and long damascened pistols , and bearing a corpse on a palanquin .
It was the body of an old man , gorgeously arrayed in the habiliments of a rajah , wearing , as in life , a turban embroidered with pearls , a robe of tissue of silk and gold , a scarf of cashmere sewed with diamonds , and the magnificent weapons of a <NAME> prince .
<NAME> came the musicians and a rearguard of capering fakirs , whose cries sometimes drowned the noise of the instruments ; these closed the procession .
<NAME> <NAME> watched the procession with a sad countenance , and , turning to the guide , said , `` A suttee . ''
The <NAME> nodded , and put his finger to his lips .
The procession slowly wound under the trees , and soon its last ranks disappeared in the depths of the wood .
The songs gradually died away ; occasionally cries were heard in the distance , until at last all was silence again .
<NAME> <NAME> had heard what <NAME> said , and , as soon as the procession had disappeared , asked : `` What is a suttee ? ''
`` A suttee , '' returned the general , `` is a human sacrifice , but a voluntary one .
The woman you have just seen will be burned to-morrow at the dawn of day . ''
cried <NAME> , who could not repress his indignation .
`` Is that of the prince , her husband , '' said the guide ; `` an independent rajah of <NAME> . ''
`` Is it possible , '' resumed <NAME> , his voice betraying not the least emotion , `` that these barbarous customs still exist in <NAME> , and that the <NAME> have been unable to put a stop to them ? ''
`` These sacrifices do not occur in the larger portion of <NAME> , '' replied <NAME> ; `` but we have no power over these savage territories , and especially here in <NAME> .
The whole district north of the <NAME> is the theatre of incessant murders and pillage . ''
exclaimed <NAME> , `` to be burned alive ! ''
`` Yes , '' returned <NAME> , `` burned alive .
And , if she were not , you can not conceive what treatment she would be obliged to submit to from her relatives .
They would shave off her hair , feed her on a scanty allowance of rice , treat her with contempt ; she would be looked upon as an unclean creature , and would die in some corner , like a scurvy dog .
The prospect of so frightful an existence drives these poor creatures to the sacrifice much more than love or religious fanaticism .
Sometimes , however , the sacrifice is really voluntary , and it requires the active interference of the Government to prevent it .
Several years ago , when I was living at <NAME> , a young widow asked permission of the governor to be burned along with her husband 's body ; but , as you may imagine , he refused .
The woman left the town , took refuge with an independent rajah , and there carried out her self-devoted purpose . ''
While <NAME> was speaking , the guide shook his head several times , and now said : `` The sacrifice which will take place to-morrow at dawn is not a voluntary one . ''
`` Everybody knows about this affair in <NAME> . ''
`` But the wretched creature did not seem to be making any resistance , '' observed <NAME> .
`` That was because they had intoxicated her with fumes of hemp and opium . ''
`` But where are they taking her ? ''
`` To the pagoda of <NAME> , two miles from here ; she will pass the night there . ''
`` And the sacrifice will take place -- '' `` To-morrow , at the first light of dawn . ''
The guide now led the elephant out of the thicket , and leaped upon his neck .
Just at the moment that he was about to urge <NAME> forward with a peculiar whistle , <NAME> stopped him , and , turning to <NAME> , said , `` Suppose we save this woman . ''
`` I have yet twelve hours to spare ; I can devote them to that . ''
`` Why , you are a man of heart ! ''
`` Sometimes , '' replied <NAME> , quietly ; `` when I have the time . ''
The project was a bold one , full of difficulty , perhaps impracticable .
<NAME> <NAME> was going to risk life , or at least liberty , and therefore the success of his tour .
But he did not hesitate , and he found in <NAME> <NAME> an enthusiastic ally .
As for <NAME> , he was ready for anything that might be proposed .
His master 's idea charmed him ; he perceived a heart , a soul , under that icy exterior .
He began to love <NAME> .
There remained the guide : what course would he adopt ?
Would he not take part with the <NAME> ?
In default of his assistance , it was necessary to be assured of his neutrality .
<NAME> <NAME> frankly put the question to him .
`` Officers , '' replied the guide , `` I am a <NAME> , and this woman is a <NAME> .
<NAME> me as you will . ''
`` However , '' resumed the guide , `` it is certain , not only that we shall risk our lives , but horrible tortures , if we are taken . ''
`` That is foreseen , '' replied <NAME> .
`` I think we must wait till night before acting . ''
`` I think so , '' said the guide .
The worthy <NAME> then gave some account of the victim , who , he said , was a celebrated beauty of the <NAME> race , and the daughter of a wealthy <NAME> merchant .
She had received a thoroughly <NAME> education in that city , and , from her manners and intelligence , would be thought an <NAME> .
<NAME> an orphan , she was married against her will to the old rajah of <NAME> ; and , knowing the fate that awaited her , she escaped , was retaken , and devoted by the rajah 's relatives , who had an interest in her death , to the sacrifice from which it seemed she could not escape .
The <NAME> 's narrative only confirmed <NAME> and his companions in their generous design .
It was decided that the guide should direct the elephant towards the pagoda of <NAME> , which he accordingly approached as quickly as possible .
They halted , half an hour afterwards , in a copse , some five hundred feet from the pagoda , where they were well concealed ; but they could hear the groans and cries of the fakirs distinctly .
They then discussed the means of getting at the victim .
The guide was familiar with the pagoda of <NAME> , in which , as he declared , the young woman was imprisoned .
Could they enter any of its doors while the whole party of <NAME> was plunged in a drunken sleep , or was it safer to attempt to make a hole in the walls ?
This could only be determined at the moment and the place themselves ; but it was certain that the abduction must be made that night , and not when , at break of day , the victim was led to her funeral pyre .
Then no human intervention could save her .
As soon as night fell , about six o'clock , they decided to make a reconnaissance around the pagoda .
The cries of the fakirs were just ceasing ; the Indians were in the act of plunging themselves into the drunkenness caused by liquid opium mingled with hemp , and it might be possible to slip between them to the temple itself .
The <NAME> , leading the others , noiselessly crept through the wood , and in ten minutes they found themselves on the banks of a small stream , whence , by the light of the rosin torches , they perceived a pyre of wood , on the top of which lay the embalmed body of the rajah , which was to be burned with his wife .
The pagoda , whose minarets loomed above the trees in the deepening dusk , stood a hundred steps away .
He slipped more cautiously than ever through the brush , followed by his companions ; the silence around was only broken by the low murmuring of the wind among the branches .
Soon the <NAME> stopped on the borders of the glade , which was lit up by the torches .
The ground was covered by groups of the <NAME> , motionless in their drunken sleep ; it seemed a battlefield strewn with the dead .
<NAME> , women , and children lay together .
In the background , among the trees , the pagoda of <NAME> loomed distinctly .
Much to the guide 's disappointment , the guards of the rajah , lighted by torches , were watching at the doors and marching to and fro with naked sabres ; probably the priests , too , were watching within .
The <NAME> , now convinced that it was impossible to force an entrance to the temple , advanced no farther , but led his companions back again .
<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> also saw that nothing could be attempted in that direction .
They stopped , and engaged in a whispered colloquy .
`` It is only eight now , '' said the brigadier , `` and these guards may also go to sleep . ''
`` It is not impossible , '' returned the <NAME> .
They lay down at the foot of a tree , and waited .
The time seemed long ; the guide ever and anon left them to take an observation on the edge of the wood , but the guards watched steadily by the glare of the torches , and a dim light crept through the windows of the pagoda .
They waited till midnight ; but no change took place among the guards , and it became apparent that their yielding to sleep could not be counted on .
The other plan must be carried out ; an opening in the walls of the pagoda must be made .
It remained to ascertain whether the priests were watching by the side of their victim as assiduously as were the soldiers at the door .
After a last consultation , the guide announced that he was ready for the attempt , and advanced , followed by the others .
They took a roundabout way , so as to get at the pagoda on the rear .
They reached the walls about half-past twelve , without having met anyone ; here there was no guard , nor were there either windows or doors .
The moon , on the wane , scarcely left the horizon , and was covered with heavy clouds ; the height of the trees deepened the darkness .
It was not enough to reach the walls ; an opening in them must be accomplished , and to attain this purpose the party only had their pocket-knives .
Happily the temple walls were built of brick and wood , which could be penetrated with little difficulty ; after one brick had been taken out , the rest would yield easily .
They set noiselessly to work , and the <NAME> on one side and Passepartout on the other began to loosen the bricks so as to make an aperture two feet wide .
They were getting on rapidly , when suddenly a cry was heard in the interior of the temple , followed almost instantly by other cries replying from the outside .
<NAME> and the guide stopped .
Was the alarm being given ?
<NAME> prudence urged them to retire , and they did so , followed by <NAME> and <NAME> .
They again hid themselves in the wood , and waited till the disturbance , whatever it might be , ceased , holding themselves ready to resume their attempt without delay .
But , awkwardly enough , the guards now appeared at the rear of the temple , and there installed themselves , in readiness to prevent a surprise .
It would be difficult to describe the disappointment of the party , thus interrupted in their work .
They could not now reach the victim ; how , then , could they save her ?
<NAME> <NAME> shook his fists , <NAME> was beside himself , and the guide gnashed his teeth with rage .
The tranquil <NAME> waited , without betraying any emotion .
`` We have nothing to do but to go away , '' whispered <NAME> .
`` Nothing but to go away , '' echoed the guide .
`` I am only due at <NAME> tomorrow before noon . ''
`` But what can you hope to do ? ''
`` In a few hours it will be daylight , and -- '' `` The chance which now seems lost may present itself at the last moment . ''
<NAME> <NAME> would have liked to read <NAME> 's eyes .
What was this cool Englishman thinking of ?
Was he planning to make a rush for the young woman at the very moment of the sacrifice , and boldly snatch her from her executioners ?
This would be utter folly , and it was hard to admit that <NAME> was such a fool .
<NAME> <NAME> consented , however , to remain to the end of this terrible drama .
The guide led them to the rear of the glade , where they were able to observe the sleeping groups .
Meanwhile Passepartout , who had perched himself on the lower branches of a tree , was resolving an idea which had at first struck him like a flash , and which was now firmly lodged in his brain .
He had commenced by saying to himself , `` What folly ! ''
and then he repeated , `` Why not , after all ?
It 's a chance , -- perhaps the only one ; and with such sots ! ''
Thinking thus , he slipped , with the suppleness of a serpent , to the lowest branches , the ends of which bent almost to the ground .
The hours passed , and the lighter shades now announced the approach of day , though it was not yet light .
The slumbering multitude became animated , the tambourines sounded , songs and cries arose ; the hour of the sacrifice had come .
The doors of the pagoda swung open , and a bright light escaped from its interior , in the midst of which <NAME> and <NAME> espied the victim .
She seemed , having shaken off the stupor of intoxication , to be striving to escape from her executioner .
<NAME> <NAME> 's heart throbbed ; and , convulsively seizing <NAME> 's hand , found in it an open knife .
Just at this moment the crowd began to move .
The young woman had again fallen into a stupor caused by the fumes of hemp , and passed among the fakirs , who escorted her with their wild , religious cries .
<NAME> <NAME> and his companions , mingling in the rear ranks of the crowd , followed ; and in two minutes they reached the banks of the stream , and stopped fifty paces from the pyre , upon which still lay the rajah 's corpse .
In the semi-obscurity they saw the victim , quite senseless , stretched out beside her husband 's body .
Then a torch was brought , and the wood , heavily soaked with oil , instantly took fire .
At this moment <NAME> and the guide seized <NAME> , who , in an instant of mad generosity , was about to rush upon the pyre .
But he had quickly pushed them aside , when the whole scene suddenly changed .
A cry of terror arose .
The whole multitude prostrated themselves , terror-stricken , on the ground .
The old rajah was not dead , then , since he rose of a sudden , like a spectre , took up his wife in his arms , and descended from the pyre in the midst of the clouds of smoke , which only heightened his ghostly appearance .
Fakirs and soldiers and priests , seized with instant terror , lay there , with their faces on the ground , not daring to lift their eyes and behold such a prodigy .
The inanimate victim was borne along by the vigorous arms which supported her , and which she did not seem in the least to burden .
<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> stood erect , the <NAME> bowed his head , and <NAME> was , no doubt , scarcely less stupefied .
The resuscitated rajah approached <NAME> and <NAME> , and , in an abrupt tone , said , `` Let us be off ! ''
It was Passepartout himself , who had slipped upon the pyre in the midst of the smoke and , profiting by the still overhanging darkness , had delivered the young woman from death !
It was Passepartout who , playing his part with a happy audacity , had passed through the crowd amid the general terror .
A moment after all four of the party had disappeared in the woods , and the elephant was bearing them away at a rapid pace .
But the cries and noise , and a ball which whizzed through <NAME> 's hat , apprised them that the trick had been discovered .
The old rajah 's body , indeed , now appeared upon the burning pyre ; and the priests , recovered from their terror , perceived that an abduction had taken place .
They hastened into the forest , followed by the soldiers , who fired a volley after the fugitives ; but the latter rapidly increased the distance between them , and ere long found themselves beyond the reach of the bullets and arrows .
The rash exploit had been accomplished ; and for an hour <NAME> laughed gaily at his success .
<NAME> <NAME> pressed the worthy fellow 's hand , and his master said , `` Well done ! ''
which , from him , was high commendation ; to which <NAME> replied that all the credit of the affair belonged to <NAME> .
As for him , he had only been struck with a `` queer '' idea ; and he laughed to think that for a few moments he , <NAME> , the ex-gymnast , ex-sergeant fireman , had been the spouse of a charming woman , a venerable , embalmed rajah !
As for the young <NAME> woman , she had been unconscious throughout of what was passing , and now , wrapped up in a travelling-blanket , was reposing in one of the howdahs .
The elephant , thanks to the skilful guidance of the <NAME> , was advancing rapidly through the still darksome forest , and , an hour after leaving the pagoda , had crossed a vast plain .
They made a halt at seven o'clock , the young woman being still in a state of complete prostration .
The guide made her drink a little brandy and water , but the drowsiness which stupefied her could not yet be shaken off .
<NAME> <NAME> , who was familiar with the effects of the intoxication produced by the fumes of hemp , reassured his companions on her account .
But he was more disturbed at the prospect of her future fate .
He told <NAME> that , should Aouda remain in <NAME> , she would inevitably fall again into the hands of her executioners .
These fanatics were scattered throughout the county , and would , despite the <NAME> police , recover their victim at <NAME> , <NAME> , or <NAME> .
She would only be safe by quitting <NAME> for ever .
<NAME> <NAME> replied that he would reflect upon the matter .
The station at <NAME> was reached about ten o'clock , and , the interrupted line of railway being resumed , would enable them to reach <NAME> in less than twenty-four hours .
<NAME> <NAME> would thus be able to arrive in time to take the steamer which left Calcutta the next day , October 25th , at noon , for <NAME> .
The young woman was placed in one of the waiting-rooms of the station , whilst <NAME> was charged with purchasing for her various articles of toilet , a dress , shawl , and some furs ; for which his master gave him unlimited credit .
Passepartout started off forthwith , and found himself in the streets of <NAME> , that is , the <NAME> of <NAME> , one of the most venerated in <NAME> , being built at the junction of the two sacred rivers , <NAME> and <NAME> , the waters of which attract pilgrims from every part of the peninsula .
The <NAME> , according to the legends of the <NAME> , rises in heaven , whence , owing to <NAME> 's agency , it descends to the earth .
Passepartout made it a point , as he made his purchases , to take a good look at the city .
It was formerly defended by a noble fort , which has since become a state prison ; its commerce has dwindled away , and Passepartout in vain looked about him for such a bazaar as he used to frequent in <NAME> Street .
At last he came upon an elderly , crusty Jew , who sold second-hand articles , and from whom he purchased a dress of <NAME> stuff , a large mantle , and a fine otter-skin pelisse , for which he did not hesitate to pay seventy-five pounds .
He then returned triumphantly to the station .
The influence to which the priests of <NAME> had subjected <NAME> began gradually to yield , and she became more herself , so that her fine eyes resumed all their soft <NAME> expression .
When the poet-king , <NAME> , celebrates the charms of the queen of <NAME> , he speaks thus : `` Her shining tresses , divided in two parts , encircle the harmonious contour of her white and delicate cheeks , brilliant in their glow and freshness .
Her ebony brows have the form and charm of the bow of <NAME> , the god of love , and beneath her long silken lashes the purest reflections and a celestial light swim , as in the sacred lakes of <NAME> , in the black pupils of her great clear eyes .
Her teeth , fine , equal , and white , glitter between her smiling lips like dewdrops in a passion-flower 's half-enveloped breast .
Her delicately formed ears , her vermilion hands , her little feet , curved and tender as the lotus-bud , glitter with the brilliancy of the loveliest pearls of <NAME> , the most dazzling diamonds of <NAME> .
Her narrow and supple waist , which a hand may clasp around , sets forth the outline of her rounded figure and the beauty of her bosom , where youth in its flower displays the wealth of its treasures ; and beneath the silken folds of her tunic she seems to have been modelled in pure silver by the godlike hand of <NAME> , the immortal sculptor . ''
It is enough to say , without applying this poetical rhapsody to <NAME> , that she was a charming woman , in all the <NAME> acceptation of the phrase .
She spoke <NAME> with great purity , and the guide had not exaggerated in saying that the young <NAME> had been transformed by her bringing up .
The train was about to start from <NAME> , and <NAME> proceeded to pay the guide the price agreed upon for his service , and not a farthing more ; which astonished <NAME> , who remembered all that his master owed to the guide 's devotion .
He had , indeed , risked his life in the adventure at <NAME> , and , if he should be caught afterwards by the <NAME> , he would with difficulty escape their vengeance .
<NAME> , also , must be disposed of .
What should be done with the elephant , which had been so dearly purchased ?
<NAME> <NAME> had already determined this question .
`` <NAME> , '' said he to the guide , `` you have been serviceable and devoted .
I have paid for your service , but not for your devotion .
Would you like to have this elephant ?
`` Your honour is giving me a fortune ! ''
`` Take him , guide , '' returned <NAME> , `` and I shall still be your debtor . ''
<NAME> is a brave and faithful beast . ''
And , going up to the elephant , he gave him several lumps of sugar , saying , `` Here , <NAME> , here , here . ''
The elephant grunted out his satisfaction , and , clasping Passepartout around the waist with his trunk , lifted him as high as his head .
<NAME> , not in the least alarmed , caressed the animal , which replaced him gently on the ground .
Soon after , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , installed in a carriage with <NAME> , who had the best seat , were whirling at full speed towards <NAME> .
It was a run of eighty miles , and was accomplished in two hours .
During the journey , the young woman fully recovered her senses .
What was her astonishment to find herself in this carriage , on the railway , dressed in <NAME> habiliments , and with travellers who were quite strangers to her !
Her companions first set about fully reviving her with a little liquor , and then <NAME> narrated to her what had passed , dwelling upon the courage with which <NAME> had not hesitated to risk his life to save her , and recounting the happy sequel of the venture , the result of <NAME> 's rash idea .
<NAME> <NAME> said nothing ; while <NAME> , abashed , kept repeating that `` it was n't worth telling . ''
<NAME> pathetically thanked her deliverers , rather with tears than words ; her fine eyes interpreted her gratitude better than her lips .
Then , as her thoughts strayed back to the scene of the sacrifice , and recalled the dangers which still menaced her , she shuddered with terror .
<NAME> <NAME> understood what was passing in <NAME> 's mind , and offered , in order to reassure her , to escort her to <NAME> , where she might remain safely until the affair was hushed up -- an offer which she eagerly and gratefully accepted .
She had , it seems , a <NAME> relation , who was one of the principal merchants of <NAME> , which is wholly an <NAME> city , though on an island on the <NAME> coast .
At half-past twelve the train stopped at <NAME> .
The <NAME> legends assert that this city is built on the site of the ancient Casi , which , like <NAME> 's tomb , was once suspended between heaven and earth ; though the <NAME> of to-day , which the Orientalists call the <NAME> of <NAME> , stands quite unpoetically on the solid earth , <NAME> caught glimpses of its brick houses and clay huts , giving an aspect of desolation to the place , as the train entered it .
<NAME> was <NAME> 's destination , the troops he was rejoining being encamped some miles northward of the city .
He bade adieu to <NAME> , wishing him all success , and expressing the hope that he would come that way again in a less original but more profitable fashion .
<NAME> <NAME> lightly pressed him by the hand .
The parting of <NAME> , who did not forget what she owed to <NAME> , betrayed more warmth ; and , as for <NAME> , he received a hearty shake of the hand from the gallant general .
The railway , on leaving <NAME> , passed for a while along the valley of the <NAME> .
Through the windows of their carriage the travellers had glimpses of the diversified landscape of <NAME> , with its mountains clothed in verdure , its fields of barley , wheat , and corn , its jungles peopled with green alligators , its neat villages , and its still thickly-leaved forests .
Elephants were bathing in the waters of the sacred river , and groups of <NAME> , despite the advanced season and chilly air , were performing solemnly their pious ablutions .
These were fervent <NAME> , the bitterest foes of <NAME> , their deities being <NAME> , the solar god , <NAME> , the divine impersonation of natural forces , and <NAME> , the supreme ruler of priests and legislators .
What would these divinities think of <NAME> , anglicised as it is to-day , with steamers whistling and scudding along the <NAME> , frightening the gulls which float upon its surface , the turtles swarming along its banks , and the faithful dwelling upon its borders ?
The panorama passed before their eyes like a flash , save when the steam concealed it fitfully from the view ; the travellers could scarcely discern the fort of <NAME> , twenty miles south-westward from <NAME> , the ancient stronghold of the rajahs of <NAME> ; or <NAME> and its famous rose-water factories ; or the tomb of <NAME> , rising on the left bank of the <NAME> ; the fortified town of <NAME> , or <NAME> , a large manufacturing and trading-place , where is held the principal opium market of <NAME> ; or <NAME> , a more than <NAME> town , for it is as <NAME> as Manchester or <NAME> , with its iron foundries , edgetool factories , and high chimneys puffing clouds of black smoke heavenward .
<NAME> came on ; the train passed on at full speed , in the midst of the roaring of the tigers , bears , and wolves which fled before the locomotive ; and the marvels of <NAME> , <NAME> ruined <NAME> , <NAME> , the ancient capital , <NAME> , <NAME> , and the <NAME> town of <NAME> , where <NAME> would have been proud to see his country 's flag flying , were hidden from their view in the darkness .
<NAME> was reached at seven in the morning , and the packet left for <NAME> at noon ; so that <NAME> had five hours before him .
According to his journal , he was due at <NAME> on the 25th of October , and that was the exact date of his actual arrival .
He was therefore neither behind-hand nor ahead of time .
The two days gained between <NAME> and <NAME> had been lost , as has been seen , in the journey across <NAME> .
But it is not to be supposed that <NAME> regretted them .
The train entered the station , and Passepartout jumping out first , was followed by <NAME> , who assisted his fair companion to descend .
<NAME> <NAME> intended to proceed at once to the <NAME> steamer , in order to get <NAME> comfortably settled for the voyage .
He was unwilling to leave her while they were still on dangerous ground .
Just as he was leaving the station a policeman came up to him , and said , `` <NAME> ? ''
`` Is this man your servant ? ''
added the policeman , pointing to <NAME> .
`` Be so good , both of you , as to follow me . ''
<NAME> <NAME> betrayed no surprise whatever .
The policeman was a representative of the law , and law is sacred to an Englishman .
Passepartout tried to reason about the matter , but the policeman tapped him with his stick , and <NAME> made him a signal to obey .
`` May this young lady go with us ? ''
`` She may , '' replied the policeman .
<NAME> <NAME> , <NAME> , and Passepartout were conducted to a palkigahri , a sort of four-wheeled carriage , drawn by two horses , in which they took their places and were driven away .
No one spoke during the twenty minutes which elapsed before they reached their destination .
They first passed through the `` black town , '' with its narrow streets , its miserable , dirty huts , and squalid population ; then through the `` <NAME> town , '' which presented a relief in its bright brick mansions , shaded by coconut-trees and bristling with masts , where , although it was early morning , elegantly dressed horsemen and handsome equipages were passing back and forth .
The carriage stopped before a modest-looking house , which , however , did not have the appearance of a private mansion .
The policeman having requested his prisoners -- for so , truly , they might be called -- to descend , conducted them into a room with barred windows , and said : `` You will appear before Judge <NAME> at half-past eight . ''
He then retired , and closed the door .
exclaimed <NAME> , falling into a chair .
<NAME> , with an emotion she tried to conceal , said to <NAME> : `` Sir , you must leave me to my fate !
It is on my account that you receive this treatment , it is for having saved me ! ''
<NAME> <NAME> contented himself with saying that it was impossible .
It was quite unlikely that he should be arrested for preventing a suttee .
The complainants would not dare present themselves with such a charge .
Moreover , he would not , in any event , abandon <NAME> , but would escort her to <NAME> .
`` But the steamer leaves at noon ! ''
`` We shall be on board by noon , '' replied his master , placidly .
It was said so positively that <NAME> could not help muttering to himself , `` Parbleu that 's certain !
Before noon we shall be on board . ''
But he was by no means reassured .
At half-past eight the door opened , the policeman appeared , and , requesting them to follow him , led the way to an adjoining hall .
It was evidently a court-room , and a crowd of <NAME> and natives already occupied the rear of the apartment .
<NAME> <NAME> and his two companions took their places on a bench opposite the desks of the magistrate and his clerk .
Immediately after , Judge <NAME> , a fat , round man , followed by the clerk , entered .
He proceeded to take down a wig which was hanging on a nail , and put it hurriedly on his head .
`` The first case , '' said he .
Then , putting his hand to his head , he exclaimed , `` Heh !
This is not my wig ! ''
`` No , your worship , '' returned the clerk , `` it is mine . ''
`` My dear <NAME> , how can a judge give a wise sentence in a clerk 's wig ? ''
<NAME> was getting nervous , for the hands on the face of the big clock over the judge seemed to go around with terrible rapidity .
`` The first case , '' repeated Judge <NAME> .
`` I am here , '' replied <NAME> .
`` You have been looked for , prisoners , for two days on the trains from <NAME> . ''
`` But of what are we accused ? ''
`` You are about to be informed . ''
`` I am an <NAME> subject , sir , '' said <NAME> , `` and I have the right -- '' `` Have you been ill-treated ? ''
`` Very well ; let the complainants come in . ''
A door was swung open by order of the judge , and three <NAME> priests entered .
`` That 's it , '' muttered <NAME> ; `` these are the rogues who were going to burn our young lady . ''
The priests took their places in front of the judge , and the clerk proceeded to read in a loud voice a complaint of sacrilege against <NAME> and his servant , who were accused of having violated a place held consecrated by the <NAME> religion .
`` Yes , sir , '' replied <NAME> , consulting his watch , `` and I admit it . ''
`` I admit it , and I wish to hear these priests admit , in their turn , what they were going to do at the pagoda of <NAME> . ''
The priests looked at each other ; they did not seem to understand what was said .
`` Yes , '' cried <NAME> , warmly ; `` at the pagoda of <NAME> , where they were on the point of burning their victim . ''
The judge stared with astonishment , and the priests were stupefied .
We are not talking of the pagoda of <NAME> , but of the pagoda of <NAME> , at <NAME> . ''
`` And as a proof , '' added the clerk , `` here are the desecrator 's very shoes , which he left behind him . ''
Whereupon he placed a pair of shoes on his desk .
cried <NAME> , in his surprise permitting this imprudent exclamation to escape him .
The confusion of master and man , who had quite forgotten the affair at <NAME> , for which they were now detained at <NAME> , may be imagined .
Fix the detective , had foreseen the advantage which <NAME> 's escapade gave him , and , delaying his departure for twelve hours , had consulted the priests of <NAME> .
Knowing that the <NAME> authorities dealt very severely with this kind of misdemeanour , he promised them a goodly sum in damages , and sent them forward to <NAME> by the next train .
Owing to the delay caused by the rescue of the young widow , <NAME> and the priests reached the <NAME> capital before <NAME> and his servant , the magistrates having been already warned by a dispatch to arrest them should they arrive .
<NAME> 's disappointment when he learned that <NAME> had not made his appearance in <NAME> may be imagined .
He made up his mind that the robber had stopped somewhere on the route and taken refuge in the southern provinces .
For twenty-four hours <NAME> watched the station with feverish anxiety ; at last he was rewarded by seeing <NAME> and Passepartout arrive , accompanied by a young woman , whose presence he was wholly at a loss to explain .
He hastened for a policeman ; and this was how the party came to be arrested and brought before Judge <NAME> .
Had <NAME> been a little less preoccupied , he would have espied the detective ensconced in a corner of the court-room , watching the proceedings with an interest easily understood ; for the warrant had failed to reach him at <NAME> , as it had done at <NAME> and <NAME> .
Judge <NAME> had unfortunately caught <NAME> 's rash exclamation , which the poor fellow would have given the world to recall .
`` Admitted , '' replied <NAME> , coldly .
`` Inasmuch , '' resumed the judge , `` as the <NAME> law protects equally and sternly the religions of the <NAME> people , and as the man <NAME> has admitted that he violated the sacred pagoda of <NAME> , at <NAME> , on the 20th of October , I condemn the said <NAME> to imprisonment for fifteen days and a fine of three hundred pounds . ''
cried <NAME> , startled at the largeness of the sum .
`` And inasmuch , '' continued the judge , `` as it is not proved that the act was not done by the connivance of the master with the servant , and as the master in any case must be held responsible for the acts of his paid servant , I condemn <NAME> to a week 's imprisonment and a fine of one hundred and fifty pounds . ''
<NAME> rubbed his hands softly with satisfaction ; if <NAME> could be detained in <NAME> a week , it would be more than time for the warrant to arrive .
This sentence ruined his master .
A wager of twenty thousand pounds lost , because he , like a precious fool , had gone into that abominable pagoda !
<NAME> <NAME> , as self-composed as if the judgment did not in the least concern him , did not even lift his eyebrows while it was being pronounced .
Just as the clerk was calling the next case , he rose , and said , `` I offer bail . ''
`` You have that right , '' returned the judge .
<NAME> 's blood ran cold , but he resumed his composure when he heard the judge announce that the bail required for each prisoner would be one thousand pounds .
`` I will pay it at once , '' said <NAME> , taking a roll of bank-bills from the carpet-bag , which <NAME> had by him , and placing them on the clerk 's desk .
`` This sum will be restored to you upon your release from prison , '' said the judge .
`` Meanwhile , you are liberated on bail . ''
said <NAME> to his servant .
`` But let them at least give me back my shoes ! ''
`` Ah , these are pretty dear shoes ! ''
he muttered , as they were handed to him .
`` More than a thousand pounds apiece ; besides , they pinch my feet . ''
<NAME> <NAME> , offering his arm to <NAME> , then departed , followed by the crestfallen Passepartout .
Fix still nourished hopes that the robber would not , after all , leave the two thousand pounds behind him , but would decide to serve out his week in jail , and issued forth on <NAME> 's traces .
That gentleman took a carriage , and the party were soon landed on one of the quays .
The <NAME> was moored half a mile off in the harbour , its signal of departure hoisted at the mast-head .
<NAME> o'clock was striking ; <NAME> was an hour in advance of time .
<NAME> saw them leave the carriage and push off in a boat for the steamer , and stamped his feet with disappointment .
`` The rascal is off , after all ! ''
He 's as prodigal as a thief !
I 'll follow him to the end of the world if necessary ; but , at the rate he is going on , the stolen money will soon be exhausted . ''
The detective was not far wrong in making this conjecture .
Since leaving <NAME> , what with travelling expenses , bribes , the purchase of the elephant , bails , and fines , <NAME> had already spent more than five thousand pounds on the way , and the percentage of the sum recovered from the bank robber promised to the detectives , was rapidly diminishing .
The <NAME> -- one of the <NAME> and <NAME> 's boats plying in the <NAME> and <NAME> seas -- was a screw steamer , built of iron , weighing about seventeen hundred and seventy tons , and with engines of four hundred horse-power .
She was as fast , but not as well fitted up , as the <NAME> , and <NAME> was not as comfortably provided for on board of her as <NAME> could have wished .
However , the trip from <NAME> to <NAME> only comprised some three thousand five hundred miles , occupying from ten to twelve days , and the young woman was not difficult to please .
During the first days of the journey <NAME> became better acquainted with her protector , and constantly gave evidence of her deep gratitude for what he had done .
The phlegmatic gentleman listened to her , apparently at least , with coldness , neither his voice nor his manner betraying the slightest emotion ; but he seemed to be always on the watch that nothing should be wanting to <NAME> 's comfort .
He visited her regularly each day at certain hours , not so much to talk himself , as to sit and hear her talk .
He treated her with the strictest politeness , but with the precision of an automaton , the movements of which had been arranged for this purpose .
<NAME> did not quite know what to make of him , though <NAME> had given her some hints of his master 's eccentricity , and made her smile by telling her of the wager which was sending him round the world .
After all , she owed <NAME> her life , and she always regarded him through the exalting medium of her gratitude .
<NAME> confirmed the <NAME> guide 's narrative of her touching history .
She did , indeed , belong to the highest of the native races of <NAME> .
Many of the <NAME> merchants have made great fortunes there by dealing in cotton ; and one of them , <NAME> , was made a baronet by the <NAME> government .
<NAME> was a relative of this great man , and it was his cousin , <NAME> , whom she hoped to join at <NAME> .
Whether she would find a protector in him she could not tell ; but <NAME> essayed to calm her anxieties , and to assure her that everything would be mathematically -- he used the very word -- arranged .
<NAME> fastened her great eyes , `` clear as the sacred lakes of the <NAME> , '' upon him ; but the intractable Fogg , as reserved as ever , did not seem at all inclined to throw himself into this lake .
The first few days of the voyage passed prosperously , amid favourable weather and propitious winds , and they soon came in sight of the great <NAME> , the principal of the islands in the <NAME> of <NAME> , with its picturesque <NAME> , two thousand four hundred feet high , looming above the waters .
The steamer passed along near the shores , but the savage Papuans , who are in the lowest scale of humanity , but are not , as has been asserted , cannibals , did not make their appearance .
The panorama of the islands , as they steamed by them , was superb .
<NAME> forests of palms , arecs , bamboo , teakwood , of the gigantic mimosa , and tree-like ferns covered the foreground , while behind , the graceful outlines of the mountains were traced against the sky ; and along the coasts swarmed by thousands the precious swallows whose nests furnish a luxurious dish to the tables of the <NAME> .
The varied landscape afforded by the <NAME> was soon passed , however , and the <NAME> rapidly approached the Straits of <NAME> , which gave access to the <NAME> seas .
What was detective Fix , so unluckily drawn on from country to country , doing all this while ?
He had managed to embark on the <NAME> at <NAME> without being seen by <NAME> , after leaving orders that , if the warrant should arrive , it should be forwarded to him at <NAME> ; and he hoped to conceal his presence to the end of the voyage .
It would have been difficult to explain why he was on board without awakening <NAME> 's suspicions , who thought him still at <NAME> .
But necessity impelled him , nevertheless , to renew his acquaintance with the worthy servant , as will be seen .
All the detective 's hopes and wishes were now centred on <NAME> ; for the steamer 's stay at <NAME> would be too brief to enable him to take any steps there .
The arrest must be made at <NAME> , or the robber would probably escape him for ever .
<NAME> was the last English ground on which he would set foot ; beyond , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> offered to <NAME> an almost certain refuge .
If the warrant should at last make its appearance at <NAME> , <NAME> could arrest him and give him into the hands of the local police , and there would be no further trouble .
But beyond <NAME> , a simple warrant would be of no avail ; an extradition warrant would be necessary , and that would result in delays and obstacles , of which the rascal would take advantage to elude justice .
<NAME> thought over these probabilities during the long hours which he spent in his cabin , and kept repeating to himself , `` Now , either the warrant will be at <NAME> , in which case I shall arrest my man , or it will not be there ; and this time it is absolutely necessary that I should delay his departure .
I have failed at <NAME> , and I have failed at <NAME> ; if I fail at <NAME> , my reputation is lost : Cost what it may , I must succeed !
But how shall I prevent his departure , if that should turn out to be my last resource ? ''
Fix made up his mind that , if worst came to worst , he would make a confidant of <NAME> , and tell him what kind of a fellow his master really was .
That Passepartout was not <NAME> 's accomplice , he was very certain .
The servant , enlightened by his disclosure , and afraid of being himself implicated in the crime , would doubtless become an ally of the detective .
But this method was a dangerous one , only to be employed when everything else had failed .
A word from <NAME> to his master would ruin all .
The detective was therefore in a sore strait .
But suddenly a new idea struck him .
The presence of <NAME> on the <NAME> , in company with <NAME> , gave him new material for reflection .
What combination of events had made her <NAME> 's travelling companion ?
They had evidently met somewhere between <NAME> and <NAME> ; but where ?
Had they met accidentally , or had <NAME> gone into the interior purposely in quest of this charming damsel ?
He asked himself whether there had not been a wicked elopement ; and this idea so impressed itself upon his mind that he determined to make use of the supposed intrigue .
Whether the young woman were married or not , he would be able to create such difficulties for <NAME> at <NAME> that he could not escape by paying any amount of money .
But could he even wait till they reached <NAME> ?
<NAME> had an abominable way of jumping from one boat to another , and , before anything could be effected , might get full under way again for <NAME> .
<NAME> decided that he must warn the <NAME> authorities , and signal the <NAME> before her arrival .
This was easy to do , since the steamer stopped at <NAME> , whence there is a telegraphic wire to <NAME> .
He finally resolved , moreover , before acting more positively , to question Passepartout .
It would not be difficult to make him talk ; and , as there was no time to lose , <NAME> prepared to make himself known .
It was now the 30th of October , and on the following day the <NAME> was due at <NAME> .
<NAME> emerged from his cabin and went on deck .
<NAME> was promenading up and down in the forward part of the steamer .
The detective rushed forward with every appearance of extreme surprise , and exclaimed , `` You here , on the <NAME> ? ''
`` What , <NAME> , are you on board ? ''
returned the really astonished <NAME> , recognising his crony of the <NAME> .
`` Why , I left you at <NAME> , and here you are , on the way to <NAME> !
Are you going round the world too ? ''
`` No , no , '' replied <NAME> ; `` I shall stop at <NAME> -- at least for some days . ''
said <NAME> , who seemed for an instant perplexed .
`` But how is it I have not seen you on board since we left <NAME> ? ''
`` Oh , a trifle of sea-sickness -- I 've been staying in my berth .
The Gulf of <NAME> does not agree with me as well as the <NAME> <NAME> .
`` As well and as punctual as ever , not a day behind time !
But , <NAME> , you do n't know that we have a young lady with us . ''
replied the detective , not seeming to comprehend what was said .
<NAME> thereupon recounted <NAME> 's history , the affair at the <NAME> pagoda , the purchase of the elephant for two thousand pounds , the rescue , the arrest , and sentence of the <NAME> court , and the restoration of <NAME> and himself to liberty on bail .
<NAME> , who was familiar with the last events , seemed to be equally ignorant of all that Passepartout related ; and the later was charmed to find so interested a listener .
`` But does your master propose to carry this young woman to <NAME> ? ''
We are simply going to place her under the protection of one of her relatives , a rich merchant at <NAME> . ''
`` Nothing to be done there , '' said <NAME> to himself , concealing his disappointment .
`` A glass of gin , Mr .
We must at least have a friendly glass on board the <NAME> . ''
The detective and <NAME> met often on deck after this interview , though <NAME> was reserved , and did not attempt to induce his companion to divulge any more facts concerning <NAME> .
He caught a glimpse of that mysterious gentleman once or twice ; but <NAME> usually confined himself to the cabin , where he kept <NAME> company , or , according to his inveterate habit , took a hand at whist .
<NAME> began very seriously to conjecture what strange chance kept <NAME> still on the route that his master was pursuing .
It was really worth considering why this certainly very amiable and complacent person , whom he had first met at <NAME> , had then encountered on board the <NAME> , who disembarked at <NAME> , which he announced as his destination , and now turned up so unexpectedly on the <NAME> , was following <NAME> 's tracks step by step .
<NAME> was ready to wager his <NAME> shoes -- which he religiously preserved -- that <NAME> would also leave <NAME> at the same time with them , and probably on the same steamer .
<NAME> might have cudgelled his brain for a century without hitting upon the real object which the detective had in view .
He never could have imagined that <NAME> was being tracked as a robber around the globe .
But , as it is in human nature to attempt the solution of every mystery , <NAME> suddenly discovered an explanation of <NAME> 's movements , which was in truth far from unreasonable .
<NAME> , he thought , could only be an agent of <NAME> 's friends at the <NAME> , sent to follow him up , and to ascertain that he really went round the world as had been agreed upon .
repeated the worthy servant to himself , proud of his shrewdness .
`` He 's a spy sent to keep us in view !
That is n't quite the thing , either , to be spying <NAME> , who is so honourable a man !
<NAME> , gentlemen of the <NAME> , this shall cost you dear ! ''
<NAME> , enchanted with his discovery , resolved to say nothing to his master , lest he should be justly offended at this mistrust on the part of his adversaries .
But he determined to chaff <NAME> , when he had the chance , with mysterious allusions , which , however , need not betray his real suspicions .
During the afternoon of Wednesday , 30th October , the <NAME> entered the <NAME> of <NAME> , which separates the peninsula of that name from <NAME> .
The mountainous and craggy islets intercepted the beauties of this noble island from the view of the travellers .
The <NAME> weighed anchor at <NAME> the next day at four a.m. , to receive coal , having gained half a day on the prescribed time of her arrival .
<NAME> <NAME> noted this gain in his journal , and then , accompanied by <NAME> , who betrayed a desire for a walk on shore , disembarked .
<NAME> , who suspected <NAME> 's every movement , followed them cautiously , without being himself perceived ; while <NAME> , laughing in his sleeve at <NAME> 's manoeuvres , went about his usual errands .
The island of <NAME> is not imposing in aspect , for there are no mountains ; yet its appearance is not without attractions .
It is a park checkered by pleasant highways and avenues .
A handsome carriage , drawn by a sleek pair of <NAME> horses , carried <NAME> and <NAME> into the midst of rows of palms with brilliant foliage , and of clove-trees , whereof the cloves form the heart of a half-open flower .
<NAME> plants replaced the prickly hedges of <NAME> fields ; sago-bushes , large ferns with gorgeous branches , varied the aspect of this tropical clime ; while nutmeg-trees in full foliage filled the air with a penetrating perfume .
<NAME> and grinning bands of monkeys skipped about in the trees , nor were tigers wanting in the jungles .
After a drive of two hours through the country , <NAME> and <NAME> returned to the town , which is a vast collection of heavy-looking , irregular houses , surrounded by charming gardens rich in tropical fruits and plants ; and at ten o'clock they re-embarked , closely followed by the detective , who had kept them constantly in sight .
<NAME> , who had been purchasing several dozen mangoes -- a fruit as large as good-sized apples , of a dark-brown colour outside and a bright red within , and whose white pulp , melting in the mouth , affords gourmands a delicious sensation -- was waiting for them on deck .
He was only too glad to offer some mangoes to <NAME> , who thanked him very gracefully for them .
At eleven o'clock the <NAME> rode out of <NAME> harbour , and in a few hours the high mountains of <NAME> , with their forests , inhabited by the most beautifully-furred tigers in the world , were lost to view .
<NAME> is distant some thirteen hundred miles from the island of <NAME> , which is a little English colony near the <NAME> coast .
<NAME> <NAME> hoped to accomplish the journey in six days , so as to be in time for the steamer which would leave on the 6th of November for <NAME> , the principal <NAME> port .
The <NAME> had a large quota of passengers , many of whom disembarked at <NAME> , among them a number of <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , mostly second-class travellers .
The weather , which had hitherto been fine , changed with the last quarter of the moon .
The sea rolled heavily , and the wind at intervals rose almost to a storm , but happily blew from the south-west , and thus aided the steamer 's progress .
The captain as often as possible put up his sails , and under the double action of steam and sail the vessel made rapid progress along the coasts of <NAME> and <NAME> .
Owing to the defective construction of the <NAME> , however , unusual precautions became necessary in unfavourable weather ; but the loss of time which resulted from this cause , while it nearly drove Passepartout out of his senses , did not seem to affect his master in the least .
<NAME> blamed the captain , the engineer , and the crew , and consigned all who were connected with the ship to the land where the pepper grows .
Perhaps the thought of the gas , which was remorselessly burning at his expense in <NAME> , had something to do with his hot impatience .
`` You are in a great hurry , then , '' said <NAME> to him one day , `` to reach <NAME> ? ''
`` <NAME> , I suppose , is anxious to catch the steamer for <NAME> ? ''
`` You believe in this journey around the world , then ? ''
I do n't believe a word of it . ''
said <NAME> , winking at him .
This expression rather disturbed Fix , without his knowing why .
Had the <NAME> guessed his real purpose ?
He knew not what to think .
But how could Passepartout have discovered that he was a detective ?
Yet , in speaking as he did , the man evidently meant more than he expressed .
<NAME> went still further the next day ; he could not hold his tongue .
<NAME> , '' said he , in a bantering tone , `` shall we be so unfortunate as to lose you when we get to <NAME> ? ''
`` Why , '' responded <NAME> , a little embarrassed , `` I do n't know ; perhaps -- '' `` Ah , if you would only go on with us !
An agent of the <NAME> , you know , ca n't stop on the way !
You were only going to <NAME> , and here you are in <NAME> .
<NAME> is not far off , and from <NAME> to <NAME> is only a step . ''
<NAME> looked intently at his companion , whose countenance was as serene as possible , and laughed with him .
But <NAME> persisted in chaffing him by asking him if he made much by his present occupation .
`` Yes , and no , '' returned <NAME> ; `` there is good and bad luck in such things .
But you must understand that I do n't travel at my own expense . ''
`` Oh , I am quite sure of that ! ''
<NAME> , fairly puzzled , descended to his cabin and gave himself up to his reflections .
He was evidently suspected ; somehow or other the <NAME> had found out that he was a detective .
But had he told his master ?
What part was he playing in all this : was he an accomplice or not ?
Was the game , then , up ?
<NAME> spent several hours turning these things over in his mind , sometimes thinking that all was lost , then persuading himself that <NAME> was ignorant of his presence , and then undecided what course it was best to take .
Nevertheless , he preserved his coolness of mind , and at last resolved to deal plainly with <NAME> .
If he did not find it practicable to arrest <NAME> at <NAME> , and if <NAME> made preparations to leave that last foothold of <NAME> territory , he , <NAME> , would tell Passepartout all .
Either the servant was the accomplice of his master , and in this case the master knew of his operations , and he should fail ; or else the servant knew nothing about the robbery , and then his interest would be to abandon the robber .
<NAME> was the situation between <NAME> and <NAME> .
Meanwhile <NAME> moved about above them in the most majestic and unconscious indifference .
He was passing methodically in his orbit around the world , regardless of the lesser stars which gravitated around him .
Yet there was near by what the astronomers would call a disturbing star , which might have produced an agitation in this gentleman 's heart .
the charms of <NAME> failed to act , to <NAME> 's great surprise ; and the disturbances , if they existed , would have been more difficult to calculate than those of <NAME> which led to the discovery of <NAME> .
It was every day an increasing wonder to <NAME> , who read in <NAME> 's eyes the depths of her gratitude to his master .
<NAME> <NAME> , though brave and gallant , must be , he thought , quite heartless .
As to the sentiment which this journey might have awakened in him , there was clearly no trace of such a thing ; while poor Passepartout existed in perpetual reveries .
One day he was leaning on the railing of the engine-room , and was observing the engine , when a sudden pitch of the steamer threw the screw out of the water .
The steam came hissing out of the valves ; and this made <NAME> indignant .
`` The valves are not sufficiently charged ! ''
If this was an <NAME> craft , we should blow up , perhaps , but we should at all events go faster ! ''
The weather was bad during the latter days of the voyage .
The wind , obstinately remaining in the north-west , blew a gale , and retarded the steamer .
The <NAME> rolled heavily and the passengers became impatient of the long , monstrous waves which the wind raised before their path .
A sort of tempest arose on the 3rd of November , the squall knocking the vessel about with fury , and the waves running high .
The <NAME> reefed all her sails , and even the rigging proved too much , whistling and shaking amid the squall .
The steamer was forced to proceed slowly , and the captain estimated that she would reach <NAME> twenty hours behind time , and more if the storm lasted .
<NAME> <NAME> gazed at the tempestuous sea , which seemed to be struggling especially to delay him , with his habitual tranquillity .
He never changed countenance for an instant , though a delay of twenty hours , by making him too late for the <NAME> boat , would almost inevitably cause the loss of the wager .
But this man of nerve manifested neither impatience nor annoyance ; it seemed as if the storm were a part of his programme , and had been foreseen .
<NAME> was amazed to find him as calm as he had been from the first time she saw him .
<NAME> did not look at the state of things in the same light .
The storm greatly pleased him .
His satisfaction would have been complete had the <NAME> been forced to retreat before the violence of wind and waves .
Each delay filled him with hope , for it became more and more probable that <NAME> would be obliged to remain some days at <NAME> ; and now the heavens themselves became his allies , with the gusts and squalls .
It mattered not that they made him sea-sick -- he made no account of this inconvenience ; and , whilst his body was writhing under their effects , his spirit bounded with hopeful exultation .
<NAME> was enraged beyond expression by the unpropitious weather .
Everything had gone so well till now !
<NAME> and sea had seemed to be at his master 's service ; steamers and railways obeyed him ; wind and steam united to speed his journey .
Had the hour of adversity come ?
<NAME> was as much excited as if the twenty thousand pounds were to come from his own pocket .
The storm exasperated him , the gale made him furious , and he longed to lash the obstinate sea into obedience .
Fix carefully concealed from him his own satisfaction , for , had he betrayed it , <NAME> could scarcely have restrained himself from personal violence .
<NAME> remained on deck as long as the tempest lasted , being unable to remain quiet below , and taking it into his head to aid the progress of the ship by lending a hand with the crew .
He overwhelmed the captain , officers , and sailors , who could not help laughing at his impatience , with all sorts of questions .
He wanted to know exactly how long the storm was going to last ; whereupon he was referred to the barometer , which seemed to have no intention of rising .
Passepartout shook it , but with no perceptible effect ; for neither shaking nor maledictions could prevail upon it to change its mind .
On the 4th , however , the sea became more calm , and the storm lessened its violence ; the wind veered southward , and was once more favourable .
<NAME> cleared up with the weather .
Some of the sails were unfurled , and the <NAME> resumed its most rapid speed .
The time lost could not , however , be regained .
<NAME> was not signalled until five o'clock on the morning of the 6th ; the steamer was due on the 5th .
<NAME> <NAME> was twenty-four hours behind-hand , and the <NAME> steamer would , of course , be missed .
The pilot went on board at six , and took his place on the bridge , to guide the <NAME> through the channels to the port of <NAME> .
Passepartout longed to ask him if the steamer had left for <NAME> ; but he dared not , for he wished to preserve the spark of hope , which still remained till the last moment .
He had confided his anxiety to Fix who -- the sly rascal ! -- tried to console him by saying that <NAME> would be in time if he took the next boat ; but this only put Passepartout in a passion .
<NAME> <NAME> , bolder than his servant , did not hesitate to approach the pilot , and tranquilly ask him if he knew when a steamer would leave <NAME> for <NAME> .
`` At high tide to-morrow morning , '' answered the pilot .
said <NAME> , without betraying any astonishment .
<NAME> , who heard what passed , would willingly have embraced the pilot , while <NAME> would have been glad to twist his neck .
`` What is the steamer 's name ? ''
`` Ought she not to have gone yesterday ? ''
`` Yes , sir ; but they had to repair one of her boilers , and so her departure was postponed till to-morrow . ''
`` Thank you , '' returned <NAME> , descending mathematically to the saloon .
<NAME> clasped the pilot 's hand and shook it heartily in his delight , exclaiming , `` Pilot , you are the best of good fellows ! ''
The pilot probably does not know to this day why his responses won him this enthusiastic greeting .
He remounted the bridge , and guided the steamer through the flotilla of junks , tankas , and fishing boats which crowd the harbour of <NAME> .
At one o'clock the <NAME> was at the quay , and the passengers were going ashore .
<NAME> had strangely favoured <NAME> , for had not the <NAME> been forced to lie over for repairing her boilers , she would have left on the 6th of November , and the passengers for <NAME> would have been obliged to await for a week the sailing of the next steamer .
<NAME> <NAME> was , it is true , twenty-four hours behind his time ; but this could not seriously imperil the remainder of his tour .
The steamer which crossed the Pacific from <NAME> to <NAME> <NAME> made a direct connection with that from <NAME> , and it could not sail until the latter reached <NAME> ; and if <NAME> was twenty-four hours late on reaching <NAME> , this time would no doubt be easily regained in the voyage of twenty-two days across the <NAME> .
He found himself , then , about twenty-four hours behind-hand , thirty-five days after leaving <NAME> .
The <NAME> was announced to leave <NAME> at five the next morning .
<NAME> <NAME> had sixteen hours in which to attend to his business there , which was to deposit <NAME> safely with her wealthy relative .
On landing , he conducted her to a palanquin , in which they repaired to the <NAME> .
A room was engaged for the young woman , and <NAME> , after seeing that she wanted for nothing , set out in search of her cousin <NAME> .
He instructed Passepartout to remain at the hotel until his return , that <NAME> might not be left entirely alone .
<NAME> <NAME> repaired to the <NAME> , where , he did not doubt , every one would know so wealthy and considerable a personage as the <NAME> merchant .
Meeting a broker , he made the inquiry , to learn that <NAME> had left <NAME> two years before , and , retiring from business with an immense fortune , had taken up his residence in <NAME> -- in <NAME> the broker thought , with the merchants of which country he had principally traded .
<NAME> <NAME> returned to the hotel , begged a moment 's conversation with <NAME> , and without more ado , apprised her that <NAME> was no longer at <NAME> , but probably in <NAME> .
<NAME> at first said nothing .
She passed her hand across her forehead , and reflected a few moments .
Then , in her sweet , soft voice , she said : `` What ought I to do , Mr .
`` It is very simple , '' responded the gentleman .
`` But I can not intrude -- '' `` You do not intrude , nor do you in the least embarrass my project .
`` Go to the <NAME> , and engage three cabins . ''
<NAME> , delighted that the young woman , who was very gracious to him , was going to continue the journey with them , went off at a brisk gait to obey his master 's order .
<NAME> is an island which came into the possession of the <NAME> by the <NAME> of <NAME> , after the war of 1842 ; and the colonising genius of the <NAME> has created upon it an important city and an excellent port .
The island is situated at the mouth of the <NAME> , and is separated by about sixty miles from the <NAME> town of <NAME> , on the opposite coast .
<NAME> has beaten <NAME> in the struggle for the <NAME> trade , and now the greater part of the transportation of <NAME> goods finds its depot at the former place .
<NAME> , hospitals , wharves , a <NAME> cathedral , a government house , macadamised streets , give to <NAME> Kong the appearance of a town in <NAME> or Surrey transferred by some strange magic to the antipodes .
<NAME> wandered , with his hands in his pockets , towards the <NAME> port , gazing as he went at the curious palanquins and other modes of conveyance , and the groups of <NAME> , <NAME> , and Europeans who passed to and fro in the streets .
<NAME> seemed to him not unlike <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , since , like them , it betrayed everywhere the evidence of <NAME> supremacy .
At the <NAME> port he found a confused mass of ships of all nations : <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , men-of-war and trading vessels , <NAME> and <NAME> junks , sempas , tankas , and flower-boats , which formed so many floating parterres .
<NAME> noticed in the crowd a number of the natives who seemed very old and were dressed in yellow .
On going into a barber 's to get shaved he learned that these ancient men were all at least eighty years old , at which age they are permitted to wear yellow , which is the <NAME> colour .
<NAME> , without exactly knowing why , thought this very funny .
On reaching the quay where they were to embark on the <NAME> , he was not astonished to find Fix walking up and down .
The detective seemed very much disturbed and disappointed .
`` This is bad , '' muttered <NAME> , `` for the gentlemen of the <NAME> ! ''
He accosted <NAME> with a merry smile , as if he had not perceived that gentleman 's chagrin .
The detective had , indeed , good reasons to inveigh against the bad luck which pursued him .
The warrant had not come !
It was certainly on the way , but as certainly it could not now reach <NAME> for several days ; and , this being the last English territory on <NAME> 's route , the robber would escape , unless he could manage to detain him .
`` Well , <NAME> , '' said <NAME> , `` have you decided to go with us so far as <NAME> ? ''
`` Yes , '' returned <NAME> , through his set teeth .
`` I knew you could not persuade yourself to separate from us .
Come and engage your berth . ''
They entered the steamer office and secured cabins for four persons .
The clerk , as he gave them the tickets , informed them that , the repairs on the <NAME> having been completed , the steamer would leave that very evening , and not next morning , as had been announced .
`` That will suit my master all the better , '' said <NAME> .
`` I will go and let him know . ''
Fix now decided to make a bold move ; he resolved to tell Passepartout all .
It seemed to be the only possible means of keeping <NAME> several days longer at <NAME> .
He accordingly invited his companion into a tavern which caught his eye on the quay .
On entering , they found themselves in a large room handsomely decorated , at the end of which was a large camp-bed furnished with cushions .
Several persons lay upon this bed in a deep sleep .
At the small tables which were arranged about the room some thirty customers were drinking <NAME> beer , porter , gin , and brandy ; smoking , the while , long red clay pipes stuffed with little balls of opium mingled with essence of rose .
From time to time one of the smokers , overcome with the narcotic , would slip under the table , whereupon the waiters , taking him by the head and feet , carried and laid him upon the bed .
The bed already supported twenty of these stupefied sots .
<NAME> and <NAME> saw that they were in a smoking-house haunted by those wretched , cadaverous , idiotic creatures to whom the <NAME> merchants sell every year the miserable drug called opium , to the amount of one million four hundred thousand pounds -- thousands devoted to one of the most despicable vices which afflict humanity !
The <NAME> government has in vain attempted to deal with the evil by stringent laws .
It passed gradually from the rich , to whom it was at first exclusively reserved , to the lower classes , and then its ravages could not be arrested .
<NAME> is smoked everywhere , at all times , by men and women , in the <NAME> ; and , once accustomed to it , the victims can not dispense with it , except by suffering horrible bodily contortions and agonies .
A great smoker can smoke as many as eight pipes a day ; but he dies in five years .
It was in one of these dens that <NAME> and <NAME> , in search of a friendly glass , found themselves .
<NAME> had no money , but willingly accepted <NAME> 's invitation in the hope of returning the obligation at some future time .
They ordered two bottles of port , to which the <NAME> did ample justice , whilst <NAME> observed him with close attention .
They chatted about the journey , and <NAME> was especially merry at the idea that <NAME> was going to continue it with them .
When the bottles were empty , however , he rose to go and tell his master of the change in the time of the sailing of the <NAME> .
<NAME> caught him by the arm , and said , `` Wait a moment . ''
`` I want to have a serious talk with you . ''
cried <NAME> , drinking up the little wine that was left in the bottom of his glass .
`` Well , we 'll talk about it to-morrow ; I have n't time now . ''
What I have to say concerns your master . ''
<NAME> , at this , looked attentively at his companion .
<NAME> 's face seemed to have a singular expression .
`` What is it that you have to say ? ''
<NAME> placed his hand upon <NAME> 's arm , and , lowering his voice , said , `` You have guessed who I am ? ''
`` Then I 'm going to tell you everything -- '' `` Now that I know everything , my friend !
But go on , go on .
<NAME> , though , let me tell you that those gentlemen have put themselves to a useless expense . ''
It 's clear that you do n't know how large the sum is . ''
`` Of course I do , '' returned Passepartout .
answered Fix , pressing his companion 's hand .
`` <NAME> dared -- fifty-five thousand pounds !
Well , there 's all the more reason for not losing an instant , '' he continued , getting up hastily .
<NAME> pushed <NAME> back in his chair , and resumed : `` Fifty-five thousand pounds ; and if I succeed , I get two thousand pounds .
If you 'll help me , I 'll let you have five hundred of them . ''
cried <NAME> , whose eyes were standing wide open .
`` Yes ; help me keep <NAME> here for two or three days . ''
`` Why , what are you saying ?
Those gentlemen are not satisfied with following my master and suspecting his honour , but they must try to put obstacles in his way !
`` I mean that it is a piece of shameful trickery .
They might as well waylay <NAME> and put his money in their pockets ! ''
`` That 's just what we count on doing . ''
`` It 's a conspiracy , then , '' cried <NAME> , who became more and more excited as the liquor mounted in his head , for he drank without perceiving it .
<NAME> began to be puzzled .
`` Members of the <NAME> ! ''
`` You must know , <NAME> , that my master is an honest man , and that , when he makes a wager , he tries to win it fairly ! ''
`` But who do you think I am ? ''
asked <NAME> , looking at him intently .
An agent of the members of the <NAME> , sent out here to interrupt my master 's journey .
But , though I found you out some time ago , I 've taken good care to say nothing about it to Mr .
`` Nothing , '' replied <NAME> , again emptying his glass .
The detective passed his hand across his forehead , hesitating before he spoke again .
<NAME> 's mistake seemed sincere , but it made his design more difficult .
It was evident that the servant was not the master 's accomplice , as <NAME> had been inclined to suspect .
`` Well , '' said the detective to himself , `` as he is not an accomplice , he will help me . ''
He had no time to lose : Fogg must be detained at <NAME> , so he resolved to make a clean breast of it .
`` Listen to me , '' said <NAME> abruptly .
`` I am not , as you think , an agent of the members of the <NAME> -- '' `` Bah ! ''
retorted <NAME> , with an air of raillery .
`` I am a police detective , sent out here by the <NAME> office . ''
<NAME> was speechless with astonishment when <NAME> displayed this document , the genuineness of which could not be doubted .
`` <NAME> 's wager , '' resumed <NAME> , `` is only a pretext , of which you and the gentlemen of the Reform are dupes .
He had a motive for securing your innocent complicity . ''
On the 28th of last September a robbery of fifty-five thousand pounds was committed at the <NAME> of <NAME> by a person whose description was fortunately secured .
Here is his description ; it answers exactly to that of <NAME> . ''
cried <NAME> , striking the table with his fist .
`` My master is the most honourable of men ! ''
You know scarcely anything about him .
You went into his service the day he came away ; and he came away on a foolish pretext , without trunks , and carrying a large amount in banknotes .
And yet you are bold enough to assert that he is an honest man ! ''
`` Yes , yes , '' repeated the poor fellow , mechanically .
`` Would you like to be arrested as his accomplice ? ''
<NAME> , overcome by what he had heard , held his head between his hands , and did not dare to look at the detective .
<NAME> <NAME> , the saviour of <NAME> , that brave and generous man , a robber !
And yet how many presumptions there were against him !
Passepartout essayed to reject the suspicions which forced themselves upon his mind ; he did not wish to believe that his master was guilty .
`` Well , what do you want of me ? ''
said he , at last , with an effort .
`` See here , '' replied <NAME> ; `` I have tracked <NAME> to this place , but as yet I have failed to receive the warrant of arrest for which I sent to <NAME> .
You must help me to keep him here in <NAME> -- '' `` I will share with you the two thousand pounds reward offered by the <NAME> of <NAME> . ''
replied <NAME> , who tried to rise , but fell back , exhausted in mind and body .
<NAME> , '' he stammered , `` even should what you say be true -- if my master is really the robber you are seeking for -- which I deny -- I have been , am , in his service ; I have seen his generosity and goodness ; and I will never betray him -- not for all the gold in the world .
I come from a village where they do n't eat that kind of bread ! ''
`` Consider that I 've said nothing , '' said <NAME> ; `` and let us drink . ''
<NAME> felt himself yielding more and more to the effects of the liquor .
<NAME> , seeing that he must , at all hazards , be separated from his master , wished to entirely overcome him .
Some pipes full of opium lay upon the table .
<NAME> slipped one into <NAME> 's hand .
He took it , put it between his lips , lit it , drew several puffs , and his head , becoming heavy under the influence of the narcotic , fell upon the table .
said <NAME> , seeing Passepartout unconscious .
`` <NAME> will not be informed of the <NAME> 's departure ; and , if he is , he will have to go without this cursed Frenchman ! ''
And , after paying his bill , <NAME> left the tavern .
While these events were passing at the opium-house , <NAME> , unconscious of the danger he was in of losing the steamer , was quietly escorting <NAME> about the streets of the <NAME> quarter , making the necessary purchases for the long voyage before them .
It was all very well for an Englishman like <NAME> to make the tour of the world with a carpet-bag ; a lady could not be expected to travel comfortably under such conditions .
He acquitted his task with characteristic serenity , and invariably replied to the remonstrances of his fair companion , who was confused by his patience and generosity : `` It is in the interest of my journey -- a part of my programme . ''
The purchases made , they returned to the hotel , where they dined at a sumptuously served table-d'hote ; after which <NAME> , shaking hands with her protector after the <NAME> fashion , retired to her room for rest .
<NAME> <NAME> absorbed himself throughout the evening in the perusal of The <NAME> and <NAME> .
Had he been capable of being astonished at anything , it would have been not to see his servant return at bedtime .
But , knowing that the steamer was not to leave for <NAME> until the next morning , he did not disturb himself about the matter .
When <NAME> did not appear the next morning to answer his master 's bell , <NAME> , not betraying the least vexation , contented himself with taking his carpet-bag , calling <NAME> , and sending for a palanquin .
It was then eight o'clock ; at half-past nine , it being then high tide , the <NAME> would leave the harbour .
<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> got into the palanquin , their luggage being brought after on a wheelbarrow , and half an hour later stepped upon the quay whence they were to embark .
<NAME> <NAME> then learned that the <NAME> had sailed the evening before .
He had expected to find not only the steamer , but his domestic , and was forced to give up both ; but no sign of disappointment appeared on his face , and he merely remarked to <NAME> , `` It is an accident , madam ; nothing more . ''
At this moment a man who had been observing him attentively approached .
It was <NAME> , who , bowing , addressed <NAME> : `` Were you not , like me , sir , a passenger by the <NAME> , which arrived yesterday ? ''
`` I was , sir , '' replied <NAME> coldly .
`` But I have not the honour -- '' `` Pardon me ; I thought I should find your servant here . ''
`` Do you know where he is , sir ? ''
`` Is he not with you ? ''
`` He has not made his appearance since yesterday .
Could he have gone on board the <NAME> without us ? ''
`` Excuse me , did you intend to sail in the <NAME> ? ''
`` So did I , madam , and I am excessively disappointed .
The <NAME> , its repairs being completed , left <NAME> twelve hours before the stated time , without any notice being given ; and we must now wait a week for another steamer . ''
As he said `` a week '' <NAME> felt his heart leap for joy .
<NAME> detained at <NAME> for a week !
There would be time for the warrant to arrive , and fortune at last favoured the representative of the law .
His horror may be imagined when he heard <NAME> say , in his placid voice , `` But there are other vessels besides the <NAME> , it seems to me , in the harbour of <NAME> . ''
And , offering his arm to <NAME> , he directed his steps toward the docks in search of some craft about to start .
<NAME> , stupefied , followed ; it seemed as if he were attached to <NAME> by an invisible thread .
<NAME> , however , appeared really to have abandoned the man it had hitherto served so well .
For three hours <NAME> wandered about the docks , with the determination , if necessary , to charter a vessel to carry him to <NAME> ; but he could only find vessels which were loading or unloading , and which could not therefore set sail .
<NAME> began to hope again .
But <NAME> , far from being discouraged , was continuing his search , resolved not to stop if he had to resort to <NAME> , when he was accosted by a sailor on one of the wharves .
`` Is your honour looking for a boat ? ''
`` Have you a boat ready to sail ? ''
`` Yes , your honour ; a pilot-boat -- No .
43 -- the best in the harbour . ''
`` Between eight and nine knots the hour .
Will you look at her ? ''
`` Your honour will be satisfied with her .
Is it for a sea excursion ? ''
`` Yes , will you agree to take me to Yokohama ? ''
The sailor leaned on the railing , opened his eyes wide , and said , `` Is your honour joking ? ''
I have missed the <NAME> , and I must get to <NAME> by the 14th at the latest , to take the boat for <NAME> . ''
`` I am sorry , '' said the sailor ; `` but it is impossible . ''
`` I offer you a hundred pounds per day , and an additional reward of two hundred pounds if I reach Yokohama in time . ''
The pilot walked away a little distance , and gazed out to sea , evidently struggling between the anxiety to gain a large sum and the fear of venturing so far .
<NAME> was in mortal suspense .
<NAME> <NAME> turned to <NAME> and asked her , `` You would not be afraid , would you , madam ? ''
`` Not with you , <NAME> , '' was her answer .
The pilot now returned , shuffling his hat in his hands .
`` Well , your honour , '' replied he , `` I could not risk myself , my men , or my little boat of scarcely twenty tons on so long a voyage at this time of year .
Besides , we could not reach <NAME> in time , for it is sixteen hundred and sixty miles from <NAME> . ''
`` Only sixteen hundred , '' said <NAME> .
`` But , '' added the pilot , `` it might be arranged another way . ''
<NAME> ceased to breathe at all .
`` By going to <NAME> , at the extreme south of <NAME> , or even to <NAME> , which is only eight hundred miles from here .
In going to <NAME> we should not be forced to sail wide of the <NAME> coast , which would be a great advantage , as the currents run northward , and would aid us . ''
`` Pilot , '' said <NAME> , `` I must take the <NAME> steamer at <NAME> , and not at <NAME> or <NAME> . ''
`` The <NAME> steamer does not start from <NAME> .
It puts in at <NAME> and <NAME> , but it starts from <NAME> . ''
`` You are sure of that ? ''
`` And when does the boat leave <NAME> ? ''
`` On the 11th , at seven in the evening .
We have , therefore , four days before us , that is ninety-six hours ; and in that time , if we had good luck and a south-west wind , and the sea was calm , we could make those eight hundred miles to <NAME> . ''
`` And you could go -- '' `` In an hour ; as soon as provisions could be got aboard and the sails put up . ''
Are you the master of the boat ? ''
`` Yes ; <NAME> , master of the Tankadere . ''
`` Would you like some earnest-money ? ''
`` If it would not put your honour out -- '' `` Here are two hundred pounds on account sir , '' added <NAME> , turning to <NAME> , `` if you would like to take advantage -- '' `` <NAME> , sir ; I was about to ask the favour . ''
In half an hour we shall go on board . ''
urged <NAME> , who was much disturbed by the servant 's disappearance .
`` I shall do all I can to find him , '' replied <NAME> .
While <NAME> , in a feverish , nervous state , repaired to the pilot-boat , the others directed their course to the police-station at <NAME> .
<NAME> Fogg there gave <NAME> 's description , and left a sum of money to be spent in the search for him .
The same formalities having been gone through at the <NAME> consulate , and the palanquin having stopped at the hotel for the luggage , which had been sent back there , they returned to the wharf .
It was now three o'clock ; and pilot-boat No .
43 , with its crew on board , and its provisions stored away , was ready for departure .
The <NAME> was a neat little craft of twenty tons , as gracefully built as if she were a racing yacht .
Her shining copper sheathing , her galvanised iron-work , her deck , white as ivory , betrayed the pride taken by <NAME> in making her presentable .
Her two masts leaned a trifle backward ; she carried brigantine , foresail , storm-jib , and standing-jib , and was well rigged for running before the wind ; and she seemed capable of brisk speed , which , indeed , she had already proved by gaining several prizes in pilot-boat races .
The crew of the <NAME> was composed of <NAME> , the master , and four hardy mariners , who were familiar with the <NAME> seas .
<NAME> , himself , a man of forty-five or thereabouts , vigorous , sunburnt , with a sprightly expression of the eye , and energetic and self-reliant countenance , would have inspired confidence in the most timid .
<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> went on board , where they found <NAME> already installed .
Below deck was a square cabin , of which the walls bulged out in the form of cots , above a circular divan ; in the centre was a table provided with a swinging lamp .
The accommodation was confined , but neat .
`` I am sorry to have nothing better to offer you , '' said <NAME> to <NAME> , who bowed without responding .
The detective had a feeling akin to humiliation in profiting by the kindness of <NAME> .
`` It 's certain , '' thought he , `` though rascal as he is , he is a polite one ! ''
The sails and the <NAME> flag were hoisted at ten minutes past three .
<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> , who were seated on deck , cast a last glance at the quay , in the hope of espying Passepartout .
<NAME> was not without his fears lest chance should direct the steps of the unfortunate servant , whom he had so badly treated , in this direction ; in which case an explanation the reverse of satisfactory to the detective must have ensued .
But the <NAME> did not appear , and , without doubt , was still lying under the stupefying influence of the opium .
<NAME> , master , at length gave the order to start , and the <NAME> , taking the wind under her brigantine , foresail , and standing-jib , bounded briskly forward over the waves .
This voyage of eight hundred miles was a perilous venture on a craft of twenty tons , and at that season of the year .
The <NAME> seas are usually boisterous , subject to terrible gales of wind , and especially during the equinoxes ; and it was now early November .
It would clearly have been to the master 's advantage to carry his passengers to <NAME> , since he was paid a certain sum per day ; but he would have been rash to attempt such a voyage , and it was imprudent even to attempt to reach <NAME> .
But <NAME> believed in the <NAME> , which rode on the waves like a seagull ; and perhaps he was not wrong .
Late in the day they passed through the capricious channels of <NAME> , and the <NAME> , impelled by favourable winds , conducted herself admirably .
`` I do not need , pilot , '' said <NAME> , when they got into the open sea , `` to advise you to use all possible speed . ''
We are carrying all the sail the wind will let us .
The poles would add nothing , and are only used when we are going into port . ''
`` It 's your trade , not mine , pilot , and I confide in you . ''
<NAME> <NAME> , with body erect and legs wide apart , standing like a sailor , gazed without staggering at the swelling waters .
The young woman , who was seated aft , was profoundly affected as she looked out upon the ocean , darkening now with the twilight , on which she had ventured in so frail a vessel .
Above her head rustled the white sails , which seemed like great white wings .
The boat , carried forward by the wind , seemed to be flying in the air .
The moon was entering her first quarter , and her insufficient light would soon die out in the mist on the horizon .
Clouds were rising from the east , and already overcast a part of the heavens .
The pilot had hung out his lights , which was very necessary in these seas crowded with vessels bound landward ; for collisions are not uncommon occurrences , and , at the speed she was going , the least shock would shatter the gallant little craft .
<NAME> , seated in the bow , gave himself up to meditation .
He kept apart from his fellow-travellers , knowing <NAME> 's taciturn tastes ; besides , he did not quite like to talk to the man whose favours he had accepted .
He was thinking , too , of the future .
It seemed certain that <NAME> would not stop at <NAME> , but would at once take the boat for <NAME> ; and the vast extent of <NAME> would ensure him impunity and safety .
<NAME> 's plan appeared to him the simplest in the world .
Instead of sailing directly from <NAME> to the <NAME> , like a common villain , he had traversed three quarters of the globe , so as to gain the <NAME> continent more surely ; and there , after throwing the police off his track , he would quietly enjoy himself with the fortune stolen from the bank .
But , once in the <NAME> , what should he , <NAME> , do ?
Should he abandon this man ?
No , a hundred times no !
Until he had secured his extradition , he would not lose sight of him for an hour .
It was his duty , and he would fulfil it to the end .
At all events , there was one thing to be thankful for ; <NAME> was not with his master ; and it was above all important , after the confidences <NAME> had imparted to him , that the servant should never have speech with his master .
<NAME> <NAME> was also thinking of <NAME> , who had so strangely disappeared .
Looking at the matter from every point of view , it did not seem to him impossible that , by some mistake , the man might have embarked on the <NAME> at the last moment ; and this was also <NAME> 's opinion , who regretted very much the loss of the worthy fellow to whom she owed so much .
They might then find him at <NAME> ; for , if the <NAME> was carrying him thither , it would be easy to ascertain if he had been on board .
A brisk breeze arose about ten o'clock ; but , though it might have been prudent to take in a reef , the pilot , after carefully examining the heavens , let the craft remain rigged as before .
The <NAME> bore sail admirably , as she drew a great deal of water , and everything was prepared for high speed in case of a gale .
<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> descended into the cabin at midnight , having been already preceded by <NAME> , who had lain down on one of the cots .
The pilot and crew remained on deck all night .
At sunrise the next day , which was 8th November , the boat had made more than one hundred miles .
The log indicated a mean speed of between eight and nine miles .
The Tankadere still carried all sail , and was accomplishing her greatest capacity of speed .
If the wind held as it was , the chances would be in her favour .
During the day she kept along the coast , where the currents were favourable ; the coast , irregular in profile , and visible sometimes across the clearings , was at most five miles distant .
The sea was less boisterous , since the wind came off land -- a fortunate circumstance for the boat , which would suffer , owing to its small tonnage , by a heavy surge on the sea .
The breeze subsided a little towards noon , and set in from the south-west .
The pilot put up his poles , but took them down again within two hours , as the wind freshened up anew .
<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> , happily unaffected by the roughness of the sea , ate with a good appetite , <NAME> being invited to share their repast , which he accepted with secret chagrin .
To travel at this man 's expense and live upon his provisions was not palatable to him .
Still , he was obliged to eat , and so he ate .
When the meal was over , he took <NAME> apart , and said , `` sir '' -- this `` sir '' scorched his lips , and he had to control himself to avoid collaring this `` gentleman '' -- '' sir , you have been very kind to give me a passage on this boat .
But , though my means will not admit of my expending them as freely as you , I must ask to pay my share -- '' `` Let us not speak of that , sir , '' replied <NAME> .
`` But , if I insist -- '' `` No , sir , '' repeated <NAME> , in a tone which did not admit of a reply .
`` This enters into my general expenses . ''
<NAME> , as he bowed , had a stifled feeling , and , going forward , where he ensconced himself , did not open his mouth for the rest of the day .
Meanwhile they were progressing famously , and <NAME> was in high hope .
He several times assured <NAME> that they would reach <NAME> in time ; to which that gentleman responded that he counted upon it .
The crew set to work in good earnest , inspired by the reward to be gained .
There was not a sheet which was not tightened , not a sail which was not vigorously hoisted ; not a lurch could be charged to the man at the helm .
They worked as desperately as if they were contesting in a Royal yacht regatta .
By evening , the log showed that two hundred and twenty miles had been accomplished from <NAME> , and <NAME> might hope that he would be able to reach <NAME> without recording any delay in his journal ; in which case , the many misadventures which had overtaken him since he left <NAME> would not seriously affect his journey .
The <NAME> entered the Straits of Fo-Kien , which separate the island of Formosa from the <NAME> coast , in the small hours of the night , and crossed the Tropic of <NAME> .
The sea was very rough in the straits , full of eddies formed by the counter-currents , and the chopping waves broke her course , whilst it became very difficult to stand on deck .
At daybreak the wind began to blow hard again , and the heavens seemed to predict a gale .
The barometer announced a speedy change , the mercury rising and falling capriciously ; the sea also , in the south-east , raised long surges which indicated a tempest .
The sun had set the evening before in a red mist , in the midst of the phosphorescent scintillations of the ocean .
<NAME> <NAME> long examined the threatening aspect of the heavens , muttering indistinctly between his teeth .
At last he said in a low voice to <NAME> , `` Shall I speak out to your honour ? ''
`` Well , we are going to have a squall . ''
`` Is the wind north or south ? ''
a typhoon is coming up . ''
`` Glad it 's a typhoon from the south , for it will carry us forward . ''
`` Oh , if you take it that way , '' said <NAME> , `` I 've nothing more to say . ''
<NAME> <NAME> 's suspicions were confirmed .
At a less advanced season of the year the typhoon , according to a famous meteorologist , would have passed away like a luminous cascade of electric flame ; but in the winter equinox it was to be feared that it would burst upon them with great violence .
The pilot took his precautions in advance .
He reefed all sail , the pole-masts were dispensed with ; all hands went forward to the bows .
A single triangular sail , of strong canvas , was hoisted as a storm-jib , so as to hold the wind from behind .
<NAME> <NAME> had requested his passengers to go below ; but this imprisonment in so narrow a space , with little air , and the boat bouncing in the gale , was far from pleasant .
Neither <NAME> , <NAME> , nor <NAME> consented to leave the deck .
The storm of rain and wind descended upon them towards eight o'clock .
With but its bit of sail , the <NAME> was lifted like a feather by a wind , an idea of whose violence can scarcely be given .
To compare her speed to four times that of a locomotive going on full steam would be below the truth .
The boat scudded thus northward during the whole day , borne on by monstrous waves , preserving always , fortunately , a speed equal to theirs .
<NAME> times she seemed almost to be submerged by these mountains of water which rose behind her ; but the adroit management of the pilot saved her .
The passengers were often bathed in spray , but they submitted to it philosophically .
<NAME> cursed it , no doubt ; but <NAME> , with her eyes fastened upon her protector , whose coolness amazed her , showed herself worthy of him , and bravely weathered the storm .
As for <NAME> , it seemed just as if the typhoon were a part of his programme .
Up to this time the <NAME> had always held her course to the north ; but towards evening the wind , veering three quarters , bore down from the north-west .
The boat , now lying in the trough of the waves , shook and rolled terribly ; the sea struck her with fearful violence .
At night the tempest increased in violence .
<NAME> <NAME> saw the approach of darkness and the rising of the storm with dark misgivings .
He thought awhile , and then asked his crew if it was not time to slacken speed .
After a consultation he approached <NAME> , and said , `` I think , your honour , that we should do well to make for one of the ports on the coast . ''
`` I know of but one , '' returned <NAME> tranquilly .
The pilot , at first , did not seem to comprehend ; he could scarcely realise so much determination and tenacity .
So the <NAME> kept steadily on her northward track .
The night was really terrible ; it would be a miracle if the craft did not founder .
Twice it could have been all over with her if the crew had not been constantly on the watch .
<NAME> was exhausted , but did not utter a complaint .
More than once <NAME> rushed to protect her from the violence of the waves .
The tempest still raged with undiminished fury ; but the wind now returned to the south-east .
It was a favourable change , and the Tankadere again bounded forward on this mountainous sea , though the waves crossed each other , and imparted shocks and counter-shocks which would have crushed a craft less solidly built .
From time to time the coast was visible through the broken mist , but no vessel was in sight .
The <NAME> was alone upon the sea .
There were some signs of a calm at noon , and these became more distinct as the sun descended toward the horizon .
The tempest had been as brief as terrific .
The passengers , thoroughly exhausted , could now eat a little , and take some repose .
The night was comparatively quiet .
Some of the sails were again hoisted , and the speed of the boat was very good .
The next morning at dawn they espied the coast , and <NAME> was able to assert that they were not one hundred miles from <NAME> .
A hundred miles , and only one day to traverse them !
That very evening <NAME> was due at <NAME> , if he did not wish to miss the steamer to <NAME> .
Had there been no storm , during which several hours were lost , they would be at this moment within thirty miles of their destination .
The wind grew decidedly calmer , and happily the sea fell with it .
All sails were now hoisted , and at noon the <NAME> was within forty-five miles of <NAME> .
There remained yet six hours in which to accomplish that distance .
All on board feared that it could not be done , and every one -- <NAME> , no doubt , excepted -- felt his heart beat with impatience .
The boat must keep up an average of nine miles an hour , and the wind was becoming calmer every moment !
It was a capricious breeze , coming from the coast , and after it passed the sea became smooth .
Still , the <NAME> was so light , and her fine sails caught the fickle zephyrs so well , that , with the aid of the currents <NAME> found himself at six o'clock not more than ten miles from the mouth of <NAME> .
<NAME> itself is situated at least twelve miles up the stream .
At seven they were still three miles from <NAME> .
The pilot swore an angry oath ; the reward of two hundred pounds was evidently on the point of escaping him .
He looked at <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> was perfectly tranquil ; and yet his whole fortune was at this moment at stake .
At this moment , also , a long black funnel , crowned with wreaths of smoke , appeared on the edge of the waters .
It was the <NAME> steamer , leaving for <NAME> at the appointed time .
cried <NAME> , pushing back the rudder with a desperate jerk .
A small brass cannon stood on the forward deck of the <NAME> , for making signals in the fogs .
It was loaded to the muzzle ; but just as the pilot was about to apply a red-hot coal to the touchhole , <NAME> said , `` Hoist your flag ! ''
The flag was run up at half-mast , and , this being the signal of distress , it was hoped that the <NAME> steamer , perceiving it , would change her course a little , so as to succour the pilot-boat .
And the booming of the little cannon resounded in the air .
The <NAME> , setting sail from <NAME> at half-past six on the 7th of November , directed her course at full steam towards <NAME> .
She carried a large cargo and a well-filled cabin of passengers .
Two state-rooms in the rear were , however , unoccupied -- those which had been engaged by <NAME> .
The next day a passenger with a half-stupefied eye , staggering gait , and disordered hair , was seen to emerge from the second cabin , and to totter to a seat on deck .
It was <NAME> ; and what had happened to him was as follows : Shortly after <NAME> left the opium den , two waiters had lifted the unconscious Passepartout , and had carried him to the bed reserved for the smokers .
Three hours later , pursued even in his dreams by a fixed idea , the poor fellow awoke , and struggled against the stupefying influence of the narcotic .
The thought of a duty unfulfilled shook off his torpor , and he hurried from the abode of drunkenness .
Staggering and holding himself up by keeping against the walls , falling down and creeping up again , and irresistibly impelled by a kind of instinct , he kept crying out , `` The <NAME> !
The steamer lay puffing alongside the quay , on the point of starting .
<NAME> had but few steps to go ; and , rushing upon the plank , he crossed it , and fell unconscious on the deck , just as the <NAME> was moving off .
Several sailors , who were evidently accustomed to this sort of scene , carried the poor <NAME> down into the second cabin , and <NAME> did not wake until they were one hundred and fifty miles away from <NAME> .
Thus he found himself the next morning on the deck of the <NAME> , and eagerly inhaling the exhilarating sea-breeze .
The pure air sobered him .
He began to collect his sense , which he found a difficult task ; but at last he recalled the events of the evening before , <NAME> 's revelation , and the opium-house .
`` It is evident , '' said he to himself , `` that I have been abominably drunk !
What will <NAME> say ?
At least I have not missed the steamer , which is the most important thing . ''
Then , as <NAME> occurred to him : `` As for that rascal , I hope we are well rid of him , and that he has not dared , as he proposed , to follow us on board the <NAME> .
A detective on the track of <NAME> , accused of robbing the <NAME> of <NAME> !
<NAME> <NAME> is no more a robber than I am a murderer . ''
Should he divulge <NAME> 's real errand to his master ?
Would it do to tell the part the detective was playing ?
Would it not be better to wait until <NAME> reached <NAME> again , and then impart to him that an agent of the metropolitan police had been following him round the world , and have a good laugh over it ?
No doubt ; at least , it was worth considering .
The first thing to do was to find <NAME> , and apologise for his singular behaviour .
<NAME> got up and proceeded , as well as he could with the rolling of the steamer , to the after-deck .
He saw no one who resembled either his master or <NAME> .
muttered he ; `` <NAME> has not got up yet , and <NAME> has probably found some partners at whist . ''
He descended to the saloon .
<NAME> <NAME> was not there .
<NAME> had only , however , to ask the purser the number of his master 's state-room .
The purser replied that he did not know any passenger by the name of <NAME> .
`` I beg your pardon , '' said <NAME> persistently .
`` He is a tall gentleman , quiet , and not very talkative , and has with him a young lady -- '' `` There is no young lady on board , '' interrupted the purser .
`` Here is a list of the passengers ; you may see for yourself . ''
<NAME> scanned the list , but his master 's name was not upon it .
All at once an idea struck him .
am I on the <NAME> ? ''
`` On the way to Yokohama ? ''
<NAME> had for an instant feared that he was on the wrong boat ; but , though he was really on the <NAME> , his master was not there .
He fell thunderstruck on a seat .
He saw it all now .
He remembered that the time of sailing had been changed , that he should have informed his master of that fact , and that he had not done so .
It was his fault , then , that <NAME> and <NAME> had missed the steamer .
Yes , but it was still more the fault of the traitor who , in order to separate him from his master , and detain the latter at <NAME> , had inveigled him into getting drunk !
He now saw the detective 's trick ; and at this moment <NAME> was certainly ruined , his bet was lost , and he himself perhaps arrested and imprisoned !
At this thought <NAME> tore his hair .
<NAME> , if <NAME> ever came within his reach , what a settling of accounts there would be !
After his first depression , <NAME> became calmer , and began to study his situation .
It was certainly not an enviable one .
He found himself on the way to <NAME> , and what should he do when he got there ?
His pocket was empty ; he had not a solitary shilling , not so much as a penny .
His passage had fortunately been paid for in advance ; and he had five or six days in which to decide upon his future course .
He fell to at meals with an appetite , and ate for <NAME> , <NAME> , and himself .
He helped himself as generously as if <NAME> were a desert , where nothing to eat was to be looked for .
At dawn on the 13th the <NAME> entered the port of <NAME> .
This is an important port of call in the <NAME> , where all the mail-steamers , and those carrying travellers between <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and the <NAME> islands put in .
It is situated in the bay of <NAME> , and at but a short distance from that second capital of the <NAME> , and the residence of the <NAME> , the civil Emperor , before the <NAME> , the spiritual Emperor , absorbed his office in his own .
The <NAME> anchored at the quay near the custom-house , in the midst of a crowd of ships bearing the flags of all nations .
<NAME> went timidly ashore on this so curious territory of the <NAME> of the <NAME> .
He had nothing better to do than , taking chance for his guide , to wander aimlessly through the streets of <NAME> .
He found himself at first in a thoroughly <NAME> quarter , the houses having low fronts , and being adorned with verandas , beneath which he caught glimpses of neat peristyles .
This quarter occupied , with its streets , squares , docks , and warehouses , all the space between the `` promontory of the <NAME> '' and the river .
Here , as at <NAME> and <NAME> , were mixed crowds of all races , <NAME> and <NAME> , <NAME> and <NAME> , mostly merchants ready to buy or sell anything .
The <NAME> felt himself as much alone among them as if he had dropped down in the midst of <NAME> .
He had , at least , one resource , -- to call on the <NAME> and <NAME> consuls at <NAME> for assistance .
But he shrank from telling the story of his adventures , intimately connected as it was with that of his master ; and , before doing so , he determined to exhaust all other means of aid .
As chance did not favour him in the <NAME> quarter , he penetrated that inhabited by the native <NAME> , determined , if necessary , to push on to <NAME> .
The <NAME> quarter of <NAME> is called <NAME> , after the goddess of the sea , who is worshipped on the islands round about .
There <NAME> beheld beautiful fir and cedar groves , sacred gates of a singular architecture , bridges half hid in the midst of bamboos and reeds , temples shaded by immense cedar-trees , holy retreats where were sheltered <NAME> priests and sectaries of <NAME> , and interminable streets , where a perfect harvest of rose-tinted and red-cheeked children , who looked as if they had been cut out of <NAME> screens , and who were playing in the midst of short-legged poodles and yellowish cats , might have been gathered .
The streets were crowded with people .
Priests were passing in processions , beating their dreary tambourines ; police and custom-house officers with pointed hats encrusted with lac and carrying two sabres hung to their waists ; soldiers , clad in blue cotton with white stripes , and bearing guns ; the <NAME> 's guards , enveloped in silken doubles , hauberks and coats of mail ; and numbers of military folk of all ranks -- for the military profession is as much respected in <NAME> as it is despised in <NAME> -- went hither and thither in groups and pairs .
<NAME> saw , too , begging friars , long-robed pilgrims , and simple civilians , with their warped and jet-black hair , big heads , long busts , slender legs , short stature , and complexions varying from copper-colour to a dead white , but never yellow , like the <NAME> , from whom the <NAME> widely differ .
He did not fail to observe the curious equipages -- carriages and palanquins , barrows supplied with sails , and litters made of bamboo ; nor the women -- whom he thought not especially handsome -- who took little steps with their little feet , whereon they wore canvas shoes , straw sandals , and clogs of worked wood , and who displayed tight-looking eyes , flat chests , teeth fashionably blackened , and gowns crossed with silken scarfs , tied in an enormous knot behind an ornament which the modern <NAME> ladies seem to have borrowed from the dames of <NAME> .
<NAME> wandered for several hours in the midst of this motley crowd , looking in at the windows of the rich and curious shops , the jewellery establishments glittering with quaint <NAME> ornaments , the restaurants decked with streamers and banners , the tea-houses , where the odorous beverage was being drunk with saki , a liquor concocted from the fermentation of rice , and the comfortable smoking-houses , where they were puffing , not opium , which is almost unknown in <NAME> , but a very fine , stringy tobacco .
He went on till he found himself in the fields , in the midst of vast rice plantations .
There he saw dazzling camellias expanding themselves , with flowers which were giving forth their last colours and perfumes , not on bushes , but on trees , and within bamboo enclosures , cherry , plum , and apple trees , which the <NAME> cultivate rather for their blossoms than their fruit , and which queerly-fashioned , grinning scarecrows protected from the sparrows , pigeons , ravens , and other voracious birds .
On the branches of the cedars were perched large eagles ; amid the foliage of the weeping willows were herons , solemnly standing on one leg ; and on every hand were crows , ducks , hawks , wild birds , and a multitude of cranes , which the <NAME> consider sacred , and which to their minds symbolise long life and prosperity .
As he was strolling along , <NAME> espied some violets among the shrubs .
said he ; `` I 'll have some supper . ''
But , on smelling them , he found that they were odourless .
`` No chance there , '' thought he .
The worthy fellow had certainly taken good care to eat as hearty a breakfast as possible before leaving the <NAME> ; but , as he had been walking about all day , the demands of hunger were becoming importunate .
He observed that the butchers stalls contained neither mutton , goat , nor pork ; and , knowing also that it is a sacrilege to kill cattle , which are preserved solely for farming , he made up his mind that meat was far from plentiful in <NAME> -- nor was he mistaken ; and , in default of butcher 's meat , he could have wished for a quarter of wild boar or deer , a partridge , or some quails , some game or fish , which , with rice , the <NAME> eat almost exclusively .
But he found it necessary to keep up a stout heart , and to postpone the meal he craved till the following morning .
<NAME> came , and <NAME> re-entered the native quarter , where he wandered through the streets , lit by vari-coloured lanterns , looking on at the dancers , who were executing skilful steps and boundings , and the astrologers who stood in the open air with their telescopes .
Then he came to the harbour , which was lit up by the resin torches of the fishermen , who were fishing from their boats .
The streets at last became quiet , and the patrol , the officers of which , in their splendid costumes , and surrounded by their suites , <NAME> thought seemed like ambassadors , succeeded the bustling crowd .
Each time a company passed , <NAME> chuckled , and said to himself : `` Good !
another <NAME> embassy departing for <NAME> ! ''
The next morning poor , jaded , famished <NAME> said to himself that he must get something to eat at all hazards , and the sooner he did so the better .
He might , indeed , sell his watch ; but he would have starved first .
Now or never he must use the strong , if not melodious voice which nature had bestowed upon him .
He knew several <NAME> and <NAME> songs , and resolved to try them upon the <NAME> , who must be lovers of music , since they were for ever pounding on their cymbals , tam-tams , and tambourines , and could not but appreciate <NAME> talent .
It was , perhaps , rather early in the morning to get up a concert , and the audience prematurely aroused from their slumbers , might not possibly pay their entertainer with coin bearing the <NAME> 's features .
Passepartout therefore decided to wait several hours ; and , as he was sauntering along , it occurred to him that he would seem rather too well dressed for a wandering artist .
The idea struck him to change his garments for clothes more in harmony with his project ; by which he might also get a little money to satisfy the immediate cravings of hunger .
The resolution taken , it remained to carry it out .
It was only after a long search that <NAME> discovered a native dealer in old clothes , to whom he applied for an exchange .
The man liked the <NAME> costume , and ere long Passepartout issued from his shop accoutred in an old <NAME> coat , and a sort of one-sided turban , faded with long use .
A few small pieces of silver , moreover , jingled in his pocket .
`` I will imagine I am at the <NAME> ! ''
His first care , after being thus `` Japanesed , '' was to enter a tea-house of modest appearance , and , upon half a bird and a little rice , to breakfast like a man for whom dinner was as yet a problem to be solved .
`` Now , '' thought he , when he had eaten heartily , `` I must n't lose my head .
I ca n't sell this costume again for one still more <NAME> .
I must consider how to leave this country of the <NAME> , of which I shall not retain the most delightful of memories , as quickly as possible . ''
It occurred to him to visit the steamers which were about to leave for <NAME> .
He would offer himself as a cook or servant , in payment of his passage and meals .
Once at <NAME> , he would find some means of going on .
The difficulty was , how to traverse the four thousand seven hundred miles of the <NAME> which lay between <NAME> and the <NAME> .
<NAME> was not the man to let an idea go begging , and directed his steps towards the docks .
But , as he approached them , his project , which at first had seemed so simple , began to grow more and more formidable to his mind .
What need would they have of a cook or servant on an <NAME> steamer , and what confidence would they put in him , dressed as he was ?
What references could he give ?
As he was reflecting in this wise , his eyes fell upon an immense placard which a sort of clown was carrying through the streets .
This placard , which was in <NAME> , read as follows : `` The <NAME> ! ''
said <NAME> ; `` that 's just what I want ! ''
He followed the clown , and soon found himself once more in the <NAME> quarter .
A quarter of an hour later he stopped before a large cabin , adorned with several clusters of streamers , the exterior walls of which were designed to represent , in violent colours and without perspective , a company of jugglers .
This was the <NAME> <NAME> 's establishment .
That gentleman was a sort of <NAME> , the director of a troupe of mountebanks , jugglers , clowns , acrobats , equilibrists , and gymnasts , who , according to the placard , was giving his last performances before leaving the <NAME> of the <NAME> for the <NAME> of the <NAME> .
<NAME> entered and asked for <NAME> , who straightway appeared in person .
said he to <NAME> , whom he at first took for a native .
`` Would you like a servant , sir ? ''
cried <NAME> , caressing the thick grey beard which hung from his chin .
`` I already have two who are obedient and faithful , have never left me , and serve me for their nourishment and here they are , '' added he , holding out his two robust arms , furrowed with veins as large as the strings of a bass-viol .
`` So I can be of no use to you ? ''
I should so like to cross the <NAME> with you ! ''
said the <NAME> <NAME> .
`` You are no more a <NAME> than I am a monkey !
Who are you dressed up in that way ? ''
`` A man dresses as he can . ''
You are a <NAME> , are n't you ? ''
`` Yes ; a <NAME> of <NAME> . ''
`` Then you ought to know how to make grimaces ? ''
`` Why , '' replied <NAME> , a little vexed that his nationality should cause this question , `` we Frenchmen know how to make grimaces , it is true but not any better than the Americans do . ''
Well , if I ca n't take you as a servant , I can as a clown .
You see , my friend , in <NAME> they exhibit foreign clowns , and in foreign parts <NAME> clowns . ''
`` You are pretty strong , eh ? ''
`` Especially after a good meal . ''
`` Yes , '' returned <NAME> , who had formerly been wont to sing in the streets .
`` But can you sing standing on your head , with a top spinning on your left foot , and a sabre balanced on your right ? ''
I think so , '' replied <NAME> , recalling the exercises of his younger days .
`` Well , that 's enough , '' said the <NAME> <NAME> .
The engagement was concluded there and then .
<NAME> had at last found something to do .
He was engaged to act in the celebrated <NAME> troupe .
It was not a very dignified position , but within a week he would be on his way to <NAME> .
The performance , so noisily announced by the <NAME> <NAME> , was to commence at three o'clock , and soon the deafening instruments of a <NAME> orchestra resounded at the door .
<NAME> , though he had not been able to study or rehearse a part , was designated to lend the aid of his sturdy shoulders in the great exhibition of the `` human pyramid , '' executed by the <NAME> of the god <NAME> .
This `` great attraction '' was to close the performance .
Before three o'clock the large shed was invaded by the spectators , comprising Europeans and natives , <NAME> and <NAME> , men , women and children , who precipitated themselves upon the narrow benches and into the boxes opposite the stage .
The musicians took up a position inside , and were vigorously performing on their gongs , tam-tams , flutes , bones , tambourines , and immense drums .
The performance was much like all acrobatic displays ; but it must be confessed that the <NAME> are the first equilibrists in the world .
One , with a fan and some bits of paper , performed the graceful trick of the butterflies and the flowers ; another traced in the air , with the odorous smoke of his pipe , a series of blue words , which composed a compliment to the audience ; while a third juggled with some lighted candles , which he extinguished successively as they passed his lips , and relit again without interrupting for an instant his juggling .
Another reproduced the most singular combinations with a spinning-top ; in his hands the revolving tops seemed to be animated with a life of their own in their interminable whirling ; they ran over pipe-stems , the edges of sabres , wires and even hairs stretched across the stage ; they turned around on the edges of large glasses , crossed bamboo ladders , dispersed into all the corners , and produced strange musical effects by the combination of their various pitches of tone .
The jugglers tossed them in the air , threw them like shuttlecocks with wooden battledores , and yet they kept on spinning ; they put them into their pockets , and took them out still whirling as before .
It is useless to describe the astonishing performances of the acrobats and gymnasts .
The turning on ladders , poles , balls , barrels , & c. , was executed with wonderful precision .
But the principal attraction was the exhibition of the <NAME> , a show to which <NAME> is as yet a stranger .
The <NAME> form a peculiar company , under the direct patronage of the god <NAME> .
Attired after the fashion of the <NAME> , they bore upon their shoulders a splendid pair of wings ; but what especially distinguished them was the long noses which were fastened to their faces , and the uses which they made of them .
These noses were made of bamboo , and were five , six , and even ten feet long , some straight , others curved , some ribboned , and some having imitation warts upon them .
It was upon these appendages , fixed tightly on their real noses , that they performed their gymnastic exercises .
A dozen of these sectaries of <NAME> lay flat upon their backs , while others , dressed to represent lightning-rods , came and frolicked on their noses , jumping from one to another , and performing the most skilful leapings and somersaults .
As a last scene , a `` human pyramid '' had been announced , in which fifty <NAME> Noses were to represent the <NAME> of <NAME> .
But , instead of forming a pyramid by mounting each other 's shoulders , the artists were to group themselves on top of the noses .
It happened that the performer who had hitherto formed the base of the <NAME> had quitted the troupe , and as , to fill this part , only strength and adroitness were necessary , <NAME> had been chosen to take his place .
The poor fellow really felt sad when -- melancholy reminiscence of his youth ! -- he donned his costume , adorned with vari-coloured wings , and fastened to his natural feature a false nose six feet long .
But he cheered up when he thought that this nose was winning him something to eat .
He went upon the stage , and took his place beside the rest who were to compose the base of the <NAME> of <NAME> .
They all stretched themselves on the floor , their noses pointing to the ceiling .
A second group of artists disposed themselves on these long appendages , then a third above these , then a fourth , until a human monument reaching to the very cornices of the theatre soon arose on top of the noses .
This elicited loud applause , in the midst of which the orchestra was just striking up a deafening air , when the pyramid tottered , the balance was lost , one of the lower noses vanished from the pyramid , and the human monument was shattered like a castle built of cards !
Abandoning his position , clearing the footlights without the aid of his wings , and , clambering up to the right-hand gallery , he fell at the feet of one of the spectators , crying , `` Ah , my master !
`` Very well ; then let us go to the steamer , young man ! ''
<NAME> <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> passed through the lobby of the theatre to the outside , where they encountered the <NAME> <NAME> , furious with rage .
He demanded damages for the `` breakage '' of the pyramid ; and <NAME> appeased him by giving him a handful of banknotes .
At half-past six , the very hour of departure , <NAME> and <NAME> , followed by <NAME> , who in his hurry had retained his wings , and nose six feet long , stepped upon the <NAME> steamer .
What happened when the pilot-boat came in sight of <NAME> will be easily guessed .
The signals made by the <NAME> had been seen by the captain of the <NAME> steamer , who , espying the flag at half-mast , had directed his course towards the little craft .
<NAME> <NAME> , after paying the stipulated price of his passage to <NAME> , and rewarding that worthy with the additional sum of five hundred and fifty pounds , ascended the steamer with <NAME> and <NAME> ; and they started at once for <NAME> and <NAME> .
They reached their destination on the morning of the 14th of November .
<NAME> <NAME> lost no time in going on board the <NAME> , where he learned , to <NAME> 's great delight -- and perhaps to his own , though he betrayed no emotion -- that <NAME> , a <NAME> , had really arrived on her the day before .
The <NAME> steamer was announced to leave that very evening , and it became necessary to find <NAME> , if possible , without delay .
<NAME> <NAME> applied in vain to the <NAME> and <NAME> consuls , and , after wandering through the streets a long time , began to despair of finding his missing servant .
<NAME> , or perhaps a kind of presentiment , at last led him into the <NAME> <NAME> 's theatre .
He certainly would not have recognised Passepartout in the eccentric mountebank 's costume ; but the latter , lying on his back , perceived his master in the gallery .
He could not help starting , which so changed the position of his nose as to bring the `` pyramid '' pell-mell upon the stage .
All this Passepartout learned from <NAME> , who recounted to him what had taken place on the voyage from <NAME> to <NAME> on the <NAME> , in company with one Mr .
<NAME> did not change countenance on hearing this name .
He thought that the time had not yet arrived to divulge to his master what had taken place between the detective and himself ; and , in the account he gave of his absence , he simply excused himself for having been overtaken by drunkenness , in smoking opium at a tavern in <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> heard this narrative coldly , without a word ; and then furnished his man with funds necessary to obtain clothing more in harmony with his position .
Within an hour the <NAME> had cut off his nose and parted with his wings , and retained nothing about him which recalled the sectary of the god <NAME> .
The steamer which was about to depart from <NAME> to <NAME> <NAME> belonged to the <NAME> , and was named the <NAME> .
She was a large paddle-wheel steamer of two thousand five hundred tons ; well equipped and very fast .
The massive walking-beam rose and fell above the deck ; at one end a piston-rod worked up and down ; and at the other was a connecting-rod which , in changing the rectilinear motion to a circular one , was directly connected with the shaft of the paddles .
The <NAME> was rigged with three masts , giving a large capacity for sails , and thus materially aiding the steam power .
By making twelve miles an hour , she would cross the ocean in twenty-one days .
<NAME> <NAME> was therefore justified in hoping that he would reach <NAME> by the 2nd of December , <NAME> by the 11th , and <NAME> on the 20th -- thus gaining several hours on the fatal date of the 21st of December .
There was a full complement of passengers on board , among them <NAME> , many Americans , a large number of coolies on their way to <NAME> , and several <NAME> <NAME> officers , who were spending their vacation in making the tour of the world .
Nothing of moment happened on the voyage ; the steamer , sustained on its large paddles , rolled but little , and the <NAME> almost justified its name .
<NAME> <NAME> was as calm and taciturn as ever .
His young companion felt herself more and more attached to him by other ties than gratitude ; his silent but generous nature impressed her more than she thought ; and it was almost unconsciously that she yielded to emotions which did not seem to have the least effect upon her protector .
<NAME> took the keenest interest in his plans , and became impatient at any incident which seemed likely to retard his journey .
She often chatted with <NAME> , who did not fail to perceive the state of the lady 's heart ; and , being the most faithful of domestics , he never exhausted his eulogies of <NAME> 's honesty , generosity , and devotion .
He took pains to calm <NAME> 's doubts of a successful termination of the journey , telling her that the most difficult part of it had passed , that now they were beyond the fantastic countries of <NAME> and <NAME> , and were fairly on their way to civilised places again .
A railway train from <NAME> Francisco to <NAME> , and a transatlantic steamer from <NAME> to <NAME> , would doubtless bring them to the end of this impossible journey round the world within the period agreed upon .
On the ninth day after leaving <NAME> , <NAME> had traversed exactly one half of the terrestrial globe .
The <NAME> passed , on the 23rd of November , the one hundred and eightieth meridian , and was at the very antipodes of <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> had , it is true , exhausted fifty-two of the eighty days in which he was to complete the tour , and there were only twenty-eight left .
But , though he was only half-way by the difference of meridians , he had really gone over two-thirds of the whole journey ; for he had been obliged to make long circuits from <NAME> to <NAME> , from <NAME> to <NAME> , from <NAME> to <NAME> , and from <NAME> to <NAME> .
Could he have followed without deviation the fiftieth parallel , which is that of <NAME> , the whole distance would only have been about twelve thousand miles ; whereas he would be forced , by the irregular methods of locomotion , to traverse twenty-six thousand , of which he had , on the 23rd of November , accomplished seventeen thousand five hundred .
And now the course was a straight one , and <NAME> was no longer there to put obstacles in their way !
It happened also , on the 23rd of November , that <NAME> made a joyful discovery .
It will be remembered that the obstinate fellow had insisted on keeping his famous family watch at <NAME> time , and on regarding that of the countries he had passed through as quite false and unreliable .
Now , on this day , though he had not changed the hands , he found that his watch exactly agreed with the ship 's chronometers .
He would have liked to know what <NAME> would say if he were aboard !
`` The rogue told me a lot of stories , '' repeated <NAME> , `` about the meridians , the sun , and the moon !
If one listened to that sort of people , a pretty sort of time one would keep !
I was sure that the sun would some day regulate itself by my watch ! ''
<NAME> was ignorant that , if the face of his watch had been divided into twenty-four hours , like the <NAME> clocks , he would have no reason for exultation ; for the hands of his watch would then , instead of as now indicating nine o'clock in the morning , indicate nine o'clock in the evening , that is , the twenty-first hour after midnight precisely the difference between <NAME> time and that of the one hundred and eightieth meridian .
But if <NAME> had been able to explain this purely physical effect , <NAME> would not have admitted , even if he had comprehended it .
Moreover , if the detective had been on board at that moment , <NAME> would have joined issue with him on a quite different subject , and in an entirely different manner .
Where was <NAME> at that moment ?
He was actually on board the <NAME> .
On reaching <NAME> , the detective , leaving <NAME> , whom he expected to meet again during the day , had repaired at once to the <NAME> consulate , where he at last found the warrant of arrest .
It had followed him from <NAME> , and had come by the <NAME> , on which steamer he himself was supposed to be .
<NAME> 's disappointment may be imagined when he reflected that the warrant was now useless .
<NAME> <NAME> had left <NAME> ground , and it was now necessary to procure his extradition !
`` Well , '' thought <NAME> , after a moment of anger , `` my warrant is not good here , but it will be in <NAME> .
The rogue evidently intends to return to his own country , thinking he has thrown the police off his track .
I will follow him across the <NAME> .
As for the money , heaven grant there may be some left !
But the fellow has already spent in travelling , rewards , trials , bail , elephants , and all sorts of charges , more than five thousand pounds .
Yet , after all , the <NAME> is rich ! ''
His course decided on , he went on board the <NAME> , and was there when <NAME> and <NAME> arrived .
To his utter amazement , he recognised <NAME> , despite his theatrical disguise .
He quickly concealed himself in his cabin , to avoid an awkward explanation , and hoped -- thanks to the number of passengers -- to remain unperceived by <NAME> 's servant .
On that very day , however , he met <NAME> face to face on the forward deck .
The latter , without a word , made a rush for him , grasped him by the throat , and , much to the amusement of a group of <NAME> , who immediately began to bet on him , administered to the detective a perfect volley of blows , which proved the great superiority of <NAME> over <NAME> pugilistic skill .
When <NAME> had finished , he found himself relieved and comforted .
<NAME> got up in a somewhat rumpled condition , and , looking at his adversary , coldly said , `` Have you done ? ''
`` Then let me have a word with you . ''
<NAME> seemed to be vanquished by <NAME> 's coolness , for he quietly followed him , and they sat down aside from the rest of the passengers .
`` You have given me a thrashing , '' said <NAME> .
Up to this time I have been <NAME> 's adversary .
I am now in his game . ''
cried <NAME> ; `` you are convinced he is an honest man ? ''
`` No , '' replied <NAME> coldly , `` I think him a rascal .
do n't budge , and let me speak .
As long as <NAME> was on <NAME> ground , it was for my interest to detain him there until my warrant of arrest arrived .
I did everything I could to keep him back .
I sent the <NAME> priests after him , I got you intoxicated at <NAME> , I separated you from him , and I made him miss the <NAME> steamer . ''
<NAME> listened , with closed fists .
`` Now , '' resumed <NAME> , `` <NAME> seems to be going back to <NAME> .
Well , I will follow him there .
But hereafter I will do as much to keep obstacles out of his way as I have done up to this time to put them in his path .
I 've changed my game , you see , and simply because it was for my interest to change it .
Your interest is the same as mine ; for it is only in <NAME> that you will ascertain whether you are in the service of a criminal or an honest man . ''
<NAME> listened very attentively to <NAME> , and was convinced that he spoke with entire good faith .
`` Friends ? -- no , '' replied <NAME> ; `` but allies , perhaps .
At the least sign of treason , however , I 'll twist your neck for you . ''
`` Agreed , '' said the detective quietly .
<NAME> days later , on the 3rd of December , the <NAME> entered the bay of the <NAME> , and reached <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> had neither gained nor lost a single day .
It was seven in the morning when <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> set foot upon the <NAME> continent , if this name can be given to the floating quay upon which they disembarked .
These quays , rising and falling with the tide , thus facilitate the loading and unloading of vessels .
Alongside them were clippers of all sizes , steamers of all nationalities , and the steamboats , with several decks rising one above the other , which ply on the <NAME> and its tributaries .
There were also heaped up the products of a commerce which extends to <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and all the <NAME> islands .
<NAME> , in his joy on reaching at last the <NAME> continent , thought he would manifest it by executing a perilous vault in fine style ; but , tumbling upon some worm-eaten planks , he fell through them .
Put out of countenance by the manner in which he thus `` set foot '' upon the <NAME> , he uttered a loud cry , which so frightened the innumerable cormorants and pelicans that are always perched upon these movable quays , that they flew noisily away .
<NAME> <NAME> , on reaching shore , proceeded to find out at what hour the first train left for <NAME> , and learned that this was at six o'clock p.m. ; he had , therefore , an entire day to spend in the <NAME> capital .
Taking a carriage at a charge of three dollars , he and <NAME> entered it , while <NAME> mounted the box beside the driver , and they set out for the <NAME> .
From his exalted position <NAME> observed with much curiosity the wide streets , the low , evenly ranged houses , the Anglo-Saxon Gothic churches , the great docks , the palatial wooden and brick warehouses , the numerous conveyances , omnibuses , horse-cars , and upon the side-walks , not only Americans and <NAME> , but <NAME> and <NAME> .
<NAME> was surprised at all he saw .
<NAME> <NAME> was no longer the legendary city of 1849 -- a city of banditti , assassins , and incendiaries , who had flocked hither in crowds in pursuit of plunder ; a paradise of outlaws , where they gambled with gold-dust , a revolver in one hand and a bowie-knife in the other : it was now a great commercial emporium .
The lofty tower of its <NAME> overlooked the whole panorama of the streets and avenues , which cut each other at right-angles , and in the midst of which appeared pleasant , verdant squares , while beyond appeared the <NAME> quarter , seemingly imported from the <NAME> in a toy-box .
Sombreros and red shirts and plumed Indians were rarely to be seen ; but there were silk hats and black coats everywhere worn by a multitude of nervously active , gentlemanly-looking men .
Some of the streets -- especially <NAME> , which is to <NAME> Francisco what <NAME> is to <NAME> , the <NAME> des <NAME> to <NAME> , and <NAME> to <NAME> -- were lined with splendid and spacious stores , which exposed in their windows the products of the entire world .
When <NAME> reached the <NAME> , it did not seem to him as if he had left <NAME> at all .
The ground floor of the hotel was occupied by a large bar , a sort of restaurant freely open to all passers-by , who might partake of dried beef , oyster soup , biscuits , and cheese , without taking out their purses .
<NAME> was made only for the ale , porter , or sherry which was drunk .
This seemed `` very <NAME> '' to <NAME> .
The hotel refreshment-rooms were comfortable , and <NAME> and <NAME> , installing themselves at a table , were abundantly served on diminutive plates by negroes of darkest hue .
After breakfast , <NAME> , accompanied by <NAME> , started for the <NAME> consulate to have his passport visaed .
As he was going out , he met <NAME> , who asked him if it would not be well , before taking the train , to purchase some dozens of <NAME> rifles and <NAME> 's revolvers .
He had been listening to stories of attacks upon the trains by the <NAME> and <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> thought it a useless precaution , but told him to do as he thought best , and went on to the consulate .
He had not proceeded two hundred steps , however , when , `` by the greatest chance in the world , '' he met <NAME> .
The detective seemed wholly taken by surprise .
Had <NAME> and himself crossed the <NAME> together , and not met on the steamer !
At least <NAME> felt honoured to behold once more the gentleman to whom he owed so much , and , as his business recalled him to <NAME> , he should be delighted to continue the journey in such pleasant company .
<NAME> <NAME> replied that the honour would be his ; and the detective -- who was determined not to lose sight of him -- begged permission to accompany them in their walk about <NAME> -- a request which <NAME> readily granted .
They soon found themselves in <NAME> , where a great crowd was collected ; the side-walks , street , horsecar rails , the shop-doors , the windows of the houses , and even the roofs , were full of people .
Men were going about carrying large posters , and flags and streamers were floating in the wind ; while loud cries were heard on every hand .
It was a political meeting ; at least so <NAME> conjectured , who said to <NAME> , `` Perhaps we had better not mingle with the crowd .
There may be danger in it . ''
`` Yes , '' returned <NAME> ; `` and blows , even if they are political are still blows . ''
<NAME> smiled at this remark ; and , in order to be able to see without being jostled about , the party took up a position on the top of a flight of steps situated at the upper end of <NAME> .
Opposite them , on the other side of the street , between a coal wharf and a petroleum warehouse , a large platform had been erected in the open air , towards which the current of the crowd seemed to be directed .
For what purpose was this meeting ?
What was the occasion of this excited assemblage ?
<NAME> <NAME> could not imagine .
Was it to nominate some high official -- a governor or member of <NAME> ?
It was not improbable , so agitated was the multitude before them .
Just at this moment there was an unusual stir in the human mass .
All the hands were raised in the air .
Some , tightly closed , seemed to disappear suddenly in the midst of the cries -- an energetic way , no doubt , of casting a vote .
The crowd swayed back , the banners and flags wavered , disappeared an instant , then reappeared in tatters .
The undulations of the human surge reached the steps , while all the heads floundered on the surface like a sea agitated by a squall .
Many of the black hats disappeared , and the greater part of the crowd seemed to have diminished in height .
`` It is evidently a meeting , '' said <NAME> , `` and its object must be an exciting one .
I should not wonder if it were about the <NAME> , despite the fact that that question is settled . ''
`` Perhaps , '' replied <NAME> , simply .
`` At least , there are two champions in presence of each other , the <NAME> <NAME> and the <NAME> Mr .
<NAME> , leaning upon <NAME> 's arm , observed the tumultuous scene with surprise , while <NAME> asked a man near him what the cause of it all was .
Before the man could reply , a fresh agitation arose ; hurrahs and excited shouts were heard ; the staffs of the banners began to be used as offensive weapons ; and fists flew about in every direction .
Thumps were exchanged from the tops of the carriages and omnibuses which had been blocked up in the crowd .
<NAME> and shoes went whirling through the air , and <NAME> thought he even heard the crack of revolvers mingling in the din , the rout approached the stairway , and flowed over the lower step .
One of the parties had evidently been repulsed ; but the mere lookers-on could not tell whether <NAME> or <NAME> had gained the upper hand .
`` It would be prudent for us to retire , '' said <NAME> , who was anxious that <NAME> should not receive any injury , at least until they got back to <NAME> .
`` If there is any question about <NAME> in all this , and we were recognised , I fear it would go hard with us . ''
`` An <NAME> subject -- '' began <NAME> .
He did not finish his sentence ; for a terrific hubbub now arose on the terrace behind the flight of steps where they stood , and there were frantic shouts of , `` Hurrah for <NAME> !
It was a band of voters coming to the rescue of their allies , and taking the <NAME> forces in flank .
<NAME> <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> found themselves between two fires ; it was too late to escape .
The torrent of men , armed with loaded canes and sticks , was irresistible .
<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> were roughly hustled in their attempts to protect their fair companion ; the former , as cool as ever , tried to defend himself with the weapons which nature has placed at the end of every Englishman 's arm , but in vain .
A big brawny fellow with a red beard , flushed face , and broad shoulders , who seemed to be the chief of the band , raised his clenched fist to strike <NAME> , whom he would have given a crushing blow , had not <NAME> rushed in and received it in his stead .
An enormous bruise immediately made its appearance under the detective 's silk hat , which was completely smashed in .
exclaimed <NAME> , darting a contemptuous look at the ruffian .
The human tide now swept by , after overturning <NAME> , who speedily got upon his feet again , though with tattered clothes .
Happily , he was not seriously hurt .
His travelling overcoat was divided into two unequal parts , and his trousers resembled those of certain Indians , which fit less compactly than they are easy to put on .
<NAME> had escaped unharmed , and <NAME> alone bore marks of the fray in his black and blue bruise .
`` Thanks , '' said <NAME> to the detective , as soon as they were out of the crowd .
`` No thanks are necessary , '' replied .
<NAME> ; `` but let us go . ''
Such a visit was , indeed , opportune .
The clothing of both <NAME> and <NAME> was in rags , as if they had themselves been actively engaged in the contest between <NAME> and <NAME> .
An hour after , they were once more suitably attired , and with <NAME> returned to the <NAME> .
<NAME> was waiting for his master , armed with half a dozen six-barrelled revolvers .
When he perceived <NAME> , he knit his brows ; but <NAME> having , in a few words , told him of their adventure , his countenance resumed its placid expression .
Fix evidently was no longer an enemy , but an ally ; he was faithfully keeping his word .
<NAME> over , the coach which was to convey the passengers and their luggage to the station drew up to the door .
As he was getting in , <NAME> said to <NAME> , `` You have not seen this <NAME> Proctor again ? ''
`` I will come back to <NAME> to find him , '' said <NAME> calmly .
`` It would not be right for an Englishman to permit himself to be treated in that way , without retaliating . ''
The detective smiled , but did not reply .
It was clear that <NAME> was one of those Englishmen who , while they do not tolerate duelling at home , fight abroad when their honour is attacked .
At a quarter before six the travellers reached the station , and found the train ready to depart .
As he was about to enter it , <NAME> called a porter , and said to him : `` My friend , was there not some trouble to-day in <NAME> ? ''
`` It was a political meeting , sir , '' replied the porter .
`` But I thought there was a great deal of disturbance in the streets . ''
`` It was only a meeting assembled for an election . ''
`` The election of a general-in-chief , no doubt ? ''
`` No , sir ; of a justice of the peace . ''
<NAME> <NAME> got into the train , which started off at full speed .
`` From ocean to ocean '' -- so say the <NAME> ; and these four words compose the general designation of the `` great trunk line '' which crosses the entire width of the <NAME> .
The <NAME> is , however , really divided into two distinct lines : the <NAME> , between <NAME> and <NAME> , and the <NAME> , between <NAME> and <NAME> .
Five main lines connect <NAME> with <NAME> .
<NAME> and <NAME> are thus united by an uninterrupted metal ribbon , which measures no less than three thousand seven hundred and eighty-six miles .
<NAME> <NAME> and the Pacific the railway crosses a territory which is still infested by <NAME> and wild beasts , and a large tract which the <NAME> , after they were driven from <NAME> in 1845 , began to colonise .
The journey from <NAME> to <NAME> <NAME> consumed , formerly , under the most favourable conditions , at least six months .
It is now accomplished in seven days .
It was in 1862 that , in spite of the <NAME> Members of <NAME> , who wished a more southerly route , it was decided to lay the road between the forty-first and forty-second parallels .
President <NAME> himself fixed the end of the line at <NAME> , in <NAME> .
The work was at once commenced , and pursued with true <NAME> energy ; nor did the rapidity with which it went on injuriously affect its good execution .
The road grew , on the prairies , a mile and a half a day .
A locomotive , running on the rails laid down the evening before , brought the rails to be laid on the morrow , and advanced upon them as fast as they were put in position .
The <NAME> is joined by several branches in <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> .
On leaving <NAME> , it passes along the left bank of the <NAME> River as far as the junction of its northern branch , follows its southern branch , crosses the <NAME> territory and the <NAME> , turns the <NAME> , and reaches <NAME> , the <NAME> capital , plunges into the <NAME> , across the <NAME> , <NAME> and <NAME> , the <NAME> , and descends , via <NAME> , to the <NAME> -- its grade , even on the <NAME> , never exceeding one hundred and twelve feet to the mile .
<NAME> was the road to be traversed in seven days , which would enable <NAME> -- at least , so he hoped -- to take the <NAME> steamer at <NAME> on the 11th for <NAME> .
The car which he occupied was a sort of long omnibus on eight wheels , and with no compartments in the interior .
It was supplied with two rows of seats , perpendicular to the direction of the train on either side of an aisle which conducted to the front and rear platforms .
These platforms were found throughout the train , and the passengers were able to pass from one end of the train to the other .
It was supplied with saloon cars , balcony cars , restaurants , and smoking-cars ; theatre cars alone were wanting , and they will have these some day .
<NAME> and news dealers , sellers of edibles , drinkables , and cigars , who seemed to have plenty of customers , were continually circulating in the aisles .
The train left <NAME> station at six o'clock .
It was already night , cold and cheerless , the heavens being overcast with clouds which seemed to threaten snow .
The train did not proceed rapidly ; counting the stoppages , it did not run more than twenty miles an hour , which was a sufficient speed , however , to enable it to reach <NAME> within its designated time .
There was but little conversation in the car , and soon many of the passengers were overcome with sleep .
<NAME> found himself beside the detective ; but he did not talk to him .
After recent events , their relations with each other had grown somewhat cold ; there could no longer be mutual sympathy or intimacy between them .
<NAME> 's manner had not changed ; but <NAME> was very reserved , and ready to strangle his former friend on the slightest provocation .
<NAME> began to fall an hour after they started , a fine snow , however , which happily could not obstruct the train ; nothing could be seen from the windows but a vast , white sheet , against which the smoke of the locomotive had a greyish aspect .
At eight o'clock a steward entered the car and announced that the time for going to bed had arrived ; and in a few minutes the car was transformed into a dormitory .
The backs of the seats were thrown back , bedsteads carefully packed were rolled out by an ingenious system , berths were suddenly improvised , and each traveller had soon at his disposition a comfortable bed , protected from curious eyes by thick curtains .
The sheets were clean and the pillows soft .
It only remained to go to bed and sleep which everybody did -- while the train sped on across the State of <NAME> .
The country between <NAME> and <NAME> is not very hilly .
The <NAME> , taking <NAME> for its starting-point , extends eastward to meet the road from <NAME> .
The line from <NAME> Francisco to <NAME> runs in a north-easterly direction , along the <NAME> , which empties into <NAME> .
The one hundred and twenty miles between these cities were accomplished in six hours , and towards midnight , while fast asleep , the travellers passed through <NAME> ; so that they saw nothing of that important place , the seat of the State government , with its fine quays , its broad streets , its noble hotels , squares , and churches .
The train , on leaving <NAME> , and passing the junction , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , entered the range of the <NAME> .
'Cisco was reached at seven in the morning ; and an hour later the dormitory was transformed into an ordinary car , and the travellers could observe the picturesque beauties of the mountain region through which they were steaming .
The railway track wound in and out among the passes , now approaching the mountain-sides , now suspended over precipices , avoiding abrupt angles by bold curves , plunging into narrow defiles , which seemed to have no outlet .
The locomotive , its great funnel emitting a weird light , with its sharp bell , and its cow-catcher extended like a spur , mingled its shrieks and bellowings with the noise of torrents and cascades , and twined its smoke among the branches of the gigantic pines .
There were few or no bridges or tunnels on the route .
The railway turned around the sides of the mountains , and did not attempt to violate nature by taking the shortest cut from one point to another .
The train entered the State of <NAME> through the <NAME> about nine o'clock , going always northeasterly ; and at midday reached <NAME> , where there was a delay of twenty minutes for breakfast .
From this point the road , running along <NAME> , passed northward for several miles by its banks ; then it turned eastward , and kept by the river until it reached the <NAME> , nearly at the extreme eastern limit of <NAME> .
Having breakfasted , <NAME> and his companions resumed their places in the car , and observed the varied landscape which unfolded itself as they passed along the vast prairies , the mountains lining the horizon , and the creeks , with their frothy , foaming streams .
Sometimes a great herd of buffaloes , massing together in the distance , seemed like a moveable dam .
These innumerable multitudes of ruminating beasts often form an insurmountable obstacle to the passage of the trains ; thousands of them have been seen passing over the track for hours together , in compact ranks .
The locomotive is then forced to stop and wait till the road is once more clear .
This happened , indeed , to the train in which <NAME> was travelling .
About twelve o'clock a troop of ten or twelve thousand head of buffalo encumbered the track .
The locomotive , slackening its speed , tried to clear the way with its cow-catcher ; but the mass of animals was too great .
The buffaloes marched along with a tranquil gait , uttering now and then deafening bellowings .
There was no use of interrupting them , for , having taken a particular direction , nothing can moderate and change their course ; it is a torrent of living flesh which no dam could contain .
The travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the platforms ; but <NAME> , who had the most reason of all to be in a hurry , remained in his seat , and waited philosophically until it should please the buffaloes to get out of the way .
<NAME> was furious at the delay they occasioned , and longed to discharge his arsenal of revolvers upon them .
`` Mere cattle stop the trains , and go by in a procession , just as if they were not impeding travel !
I should like to know if <NAME> foresaw this mishap in his programme !
And here 's an engineer who does n't dare to run the locomotive into this herd of beasts ! ''
The engineer did not try to overcome the obstacle , and he was wise .
He would have crushed the first buffaloes , no doubt , with the cow-catcher ; but the locomotive , however powerful , would soon have been checked , the train would inevitably have been thrown off the track , and would then have been helpless .
The best course was to wait patiently , and regain the lost time by greater speed when the obstacle was removed .
The procession of buffaloes lasted three full hours , and it was night before the track was clear .
The last ranks of the herd were now passing over the rails , while the first had already disappeared below the southern horizon .
It was eight o'clock when the train passed through the defiles of the <NAME> , and half-past nine when it penetrated <NAME> , the region of the <NAME> , the singular colony of the Mormons .
During the night of the 5th of December , the train ran south-easterly for about fifty miles ; then rose an equal distance in a north-easterly direction , towards the <NAME> .
<NAME> , about nine o'clock , went out upon the platform to take the air .
The weather was cold , the heavens grey , but it was not snowing .
The sun 's disc , enlarged by the mist , seemed an enormous ring of gold , and <NAME> was amusing himself by calculating its value in pounds sterling , when he was diverted from this interesting study by a strange-looking personage who made his appearance on the platform .
This personage , who had taken the train at <NAME> , was tall and dark , with black moustache , black stockings , a black silk hat , a black waistcoat , black trousers , a white cravat , and dogskin gloves .
He might have been taken for a clergyman .
He went from one end of the train to the other , and affixed to the door of each car a notice written in manuscript .
<NAME> approached and read one of these notices , which stated that <NAME> , <NAME> missionary , taking advantage of his presence on train No .
48 , would deliver a lecture on Mormonism in car No .
117 , from eleven to twelve o'clock ; and that he invited all who were desirous of being instructed concerning the mysteries of the religion of the `` Latter Day Saints '' to attend .
`` I 'll go , '' said <NAME> to himself .
He knew nothing of Mormonism except the custom of polygamy , which is its foundation .
The news quickly spread through the train , which contained about one hundred passengers , thirty of whom , at most , attracted by the notice , ensconced themselves in car No .
<NAME> took one of the front seats .
Neither <NAME> nor <NAME> cared to attend .
At the appointed hour <NAME> rose , and , in an irritated voice , as if he had already been contradicted , said , `` I tell you that <NAME> is a martyr , that his brother <NAME> is a martyr , and that the persecutions of the <NAME> Government against the prophets will also make a martyr of <NAME> .
Who dares to say the contrary ? ''
No one ventured to gainsay the missionary , whose excited tone contrasted curiously with his naturally calm visage .
No doubt his anger arose from the hardships to which the Mormons were actually subjected .
The government had just succeeded , with some difficulty , in reducing these independent fanatics to its rule .
It had made itself master of <NAME> , and subjected that territory to the laws of the <NAME> , after imprisoning <NAME> on a charge of rebellion and polygamy .
The disciples of the prophet had since redoubled their efforts , and resisted , by words at least , the authority of <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> , as is seen , was trying to make proselytes on the very railway trains .
Then , emphasising his words with his loud voice and frequent gestures , he related the history of the Mormons from <NAME> times : how that , in <NAME> , a Mormon prophet of the tribe of <NAME> published the annals of the new religion , and bequeathed them to his son <NAME> ; how , many centuries later , a translation of this precious book , which was written in <NAME> , was made by <NAME> , junior , a <NAME> farmer , who revealed himself as a mystical prophet in 1825 ; and how , in short , the celestial messenger appeared to him in an illuminated forest , and gave him the annals of the <NAME> .
Several of the audience , not being much interested in the missionary 's narrative , here left the car ; but <NAME> , continuing his lecture , related how <NAME> , junior , with his father , two brothers , and a few disciples , founded the church of the `` Latter Day Saints , '' which , adopted not only in <NAME> , but in <NAME> , <NAME> and <NAME> , and <NAME> , counts many artisans , as well as men engaged in the liberal professions , among its members ; how a colony was established in <NAME> , a temple erected there at a cost of two hundred thousand dollars , and a town built at <NAME> ; how <NAME> became an enterprising banker , and received from a simple mummy showman a papyrus scroll written by <NAME> and several famous Egyptians .
The <NAME> 's story became somewhat wearisome , and his audience grew gradually less , until it was reduced to twenty passengers .
But this did not disconcert the enthusiast , who proceeded with the story of <NAME> 's bankruptcy in 1837 , and how his ruined creditors gave him a coat of tar and feathers ; his reappearance some years afterwards , more honourable and honoured than ever , at <NAME> , <NAME> , the chief of a flourishing colony of three thousand disciples , and his pursuit thence by outraged Gentiles , and retirement into the <NAME> .
Ten hearers only were now left , among them honest Passepartout , who was listening with all his ears .
Thus he learned that , after long persecutions , <NAME> reappeared in <NAME> , and in 1839 founded a community at <NAME> , on the <NAME> , numbering twenty-five thousand souls , of which he became mayor , chief justice , and general-in-chief ; that he announced himself , in 1843 , as a candidate for the Presidency of the <NAME> ; and that finally , being drawn into ambuscade at <NAME> , he was thrown into prison , and assassinated by a band of men disguised in masks .
<NAME> was now the only person left in the car , and the <NAME> , looking him full in the face , reminded him that , two years after the assassination of <NAME> , the inspired prophet , <NAME> , his successor , left <NAME> for the banks of the <NAME> , where , in the midst of that fertile region , directly on the route of the emigrants who crossed <NAME> on their way to <NAME> , the new colony , thanks to the polygamy practised by the <NAME> , had flourished beyond expectations .
`` And this , '' added <NAME> , `` this is why the jealousy of <NAME> has been aroused against us !
Why have the soldiers of the <NAME> invaded the soil of <NAME> ?
Why has <NAME> , our chief , been imprisoned , in contempt of all justice ?
Shall we yield to force ?
Driven from <NAME> , driven from <NAME> , driven from <NAME> , driven from <NAME> , driven from <NAME> , we shall yet find some independent territory on which to plant our tents .
And you , my brother , '' continued the <NAME> , fixing his angry eyes upon his single auditor , `` will you not plant yours there , too , under the shadow of our flag ? ''
replied <NAME> courageously , in his turn retiring from the car , and leaving the Elder to preach to vacancy .
During the lecture the train had been making good progress , and towards half-past twelve it reached the northwest border of the <NAME> .
Thence the passengers could observe the vast extent of this interior sea , which is also called the <NAME> , and into which flows an <NAME> .
It is a picturesque expanse , framed in lofty crags in large strata , encrusted with white salt -- a superb sheet of water , which was formerly of larger extent than now , its shores having encroached with the lapse of time , and thus at once reduced its breadth and increased its depth .
The <NAME> , seventy miles long and thirty-five wide , is situated three miles eight hundred feet above the sea .
Quite different from <NAME> , whose depression is twelve hundred feet below the sea , it contains considerable salt , and one quarter of the weight of its water is solid matter , its specific weight being 1,170 , and , after being distilled , 1,000 .
Fishes are , of course , unable to live in it , and those which descend through the <NAME> , the Weber , and other streams soon perish .
The country around the lake was well cultivated , for the Mormons are mostly farmers ; while ranches and pens for domesticated animals , fields of wheat , corn , and other cereals , luxuriant prairies , hedges of wild rose , clumps of acacias and milk-wort , would have been seen six months later .
Now the ground was covered with a thin powdering of snow .
The train reached <NAME> at two o'clock , where it rested for six hours , <NAME> and his party had time to pay a visit to <NAME> , connected with <NAME> by a branch road ; and they spent two hours in this strikingly <NAME> town , built on the pattern of other cities of the <NAME> , like a checker-board , `` with the sombre sadness of right-angles , '' as <NAME> expresses it .
The founder of the <NAME> of the Saints could not escape from the taste for symmetry which distinguishes the Anglo-Saxons .
In this strange country , where the people are certainly not up to the level of their institutions , everything is done `` squarely '' -- cities , houses , and follies .
The travellers , then , were promenading , at three o'clock , about the streets of the town built between the banks of the <NAME> and the spurs of the <NAME> .
They saw few or no churches , but the prophet 's mansion , the court-house , and the arsenal , blue-brick houses with verandas and porches , surrounded by gardens bordered with acacias , palms , and locusts .
A clay and pebble wall , built in 1853 , surrounded the town ; and in the principal street were the market and several hotels adorned with pavilions .
The place did not seem thickly populated .
The streets were almost deserted , except in the vicinity of the temple , which they only reached after having traversed several quarters surrounded by palisades .
There were many women , which was easily accounted for by the `` peculiar institution '' of the <NAME> ; but it must not be supposed that all the Mormons are polygamists .
They are free to marry or not , as they please ; but it is worth noting that it is mainly the female citizens of Utah who are anxious to marry , as , according to the <NAME> religion , maiden ladies are not admitted to the possession of its highest joys .
These poor creatures seemed to be neither well off nor happy .
Some -- the more well-to-do , no doubt -- wore short , open , black silk dresses , under a hood or modest shawl ; others were habited in <NAME> fashion .
<NAME> could not behold without a certain fright these women , charged , in groups , with conferring happiness on a single Mormon .
His common sense pitied , above all , the husband .
It seemed to him a terrible thing to have to guide so many wives at once across the vicissitudes of life , and to conduct them , as it were , in a body to the <NAME> paradise with the prospect of seeing them in the company of the glorious <NAME> , who doubtless was the chief ornament of that delightful place , to all eternity .
He felt decidedly repelled from such a vocation , and he imagined -- perhaps he was mistaken -- that the fair ones of <NAME> cast rather alarming glances on his person .
Happily , his stay there was but brief .
At four the party found themselves again at the station , took their places in the train , and the whistle sounded for starting .
Just at the moment , however , that the locomotive wheels began to move , cries of `` Stop !
<NAME> , like time and tide , stop for no one .
The gentleman who uttered the cries was evidently a belated Mormon .
He was breathless with running .
Happily for him , the station had neither gates nor barriers .
He rushed along the track , jumped on the rear platform of the train , and fell , exhausted , into one of the seats .
<NAME> , who had been anxiously watching this amateur gymnast , approached him with lively interest , and learned that he had taken flight after an unpleasant domestic scene .
When the <NAME> had recovered his breath , <NAME> ventured to ask him politely how many wives he had ; for , from the manner in which he had decamped , it might be thought that he had twenty at least .
`` One , sir , '' replied the <NAME> , raising his arms heavenward -- '' one , and that was enough ! ''
The train , on leaving <NAME> at <NAME> , passed northward for an hour as far as <NAME> , having completed nearly nine hundred miles from <NAME> .
From this point it took an easterly direction towards the jagged <NAME> .
It was in the section included between this range and the <NAME> that the <NAME> engineers found the most formidable difficulties in laying the road , and that the government granted a subsidy of forty-eight thousand dollars per mile , instead of sixteen thousand allowed for the work done on the plains .
But the engineers , instead of violating nature , avoided its difficulties by winding around , instead of penetrating the rocks .
One tunnel only , fourteen thousand feet in length , was pierced in order to arrive at the great basin .
The track up to this time had reached its highest elevation at the <NAME> .
From this point it described a long curve , descending towards <NAME> , to rise again to the dividing ridge of the waters between the <NAME> and the <NAME> .
There were many creeks in this mountainous region , and it was necessary to cross <NAME> , <NAME> , and others , upon culverts .
<NAME> grew more and more impatient as they went on , while <NAME> longed to get out of this difficult region , and was more anxious than <NAME> himself to be beyond the danger of delays and accidents , and set foot on <NAME> soil .
At ten o'clock at night the train stopped at <NAME> station , and twenty minutes later entered <NAME> , following the valley of <NAME> throughout .
The next day , 7th December , they stopped for a quarter of an hour at <NAME> station .
<NAME> had fallen abundantly during the night , but , being mixed with rain , it had half melted , and did not interrupt their progress .
The bad weather , however , annoyed <NAME> ; for the accumulation of snow , by blocking the wheels of the cars , would certainly have been fatal to <NAME> 's tour .
`` Why did my master make this journey in winter ?
Could n't he have waited for the good season to increase his chances ? ''
While the worthy <NAME> was absorbed in the state of the sky and the depression of the temperature , <NAME> was experiencing fears from a totally different cause .
Several passengers had got off at <NAME> , and were walking up and down the platforms ; and among these Aouda recognised <NAME> Proctor , the same who had so grossly insulted <NAME> at the <NAME> meeting .
Not wishing to be recognised , the young woman drew back from the window , feeling much alarm at her discovery .
She was attached to the man who , however coldly , gave her daily evidences of the most absolute devotion .
She did not comprehend , perhaps , the depth of the sentiment with which her protector inspired her , which she called gratitude , but which , though she was unconscious of it , was really more than that .
Her heart sank within her when she recognised the man whom <NAME> desired , sooner or later , to call to account for his conduct .
<NAME> alone , it was clear , had brought <NAME> Proctor on this train ; but there he was , and it was necessary , at all hazards , that <NAME> should not perceive his adversary .
<NAME> seized a moment when <NAME> was asleep to tell <NAME> and Passepartout whom she had seen .
`` That Proctor on this train ! ''
`` Well , reassure yourself , madam ; before he settles with <NAME> ; he has got to deal with me !
It seems to me that I was the more insulted of the two . ''
`` And , besides , '' added <NAME> , `` I 'll take charge of him , colonel as he is . ''
<NAME> , '' resumed <NAME> , `` <NAME> will allow no one to avenge him .
He said that he would come back to <NAME> to find this man .
Should he perceive <NAME> , we could not prevent a collision which might have terrible results .
He must not see him . ''
`` You are right , madam , '' replied <NAME> ; `` a meeting between them might ruin all .
Whether he were victorious or beaten , <NAME> would be delayed , and -- '' `` And , '' added <NAME> , `` that would play the game of the gentlemen of the <NAME> .
In four days we shall be in <NAME> .
Well , if my master does not leave this car during those four days , we may hope that chance will not bring him face to face with this confounded <NAME> .
We must , if possible , prevent his stirring out of it . ''
<NAME> <NAME> had just woke up , and was looking out of the window .
Soon after <NAME> , without being heard by his master or <NAME> , whispered to the detective , `` Would you really fight for him ? ''
`` I would do anything , '' replied <NAME> , in a tone which betrayed determined will , `` to get him back living to <NAME> ! ''
<NAME> felt something like a shudder shoot through his frame , but his confidence in his master remained unbroken .
<NAME> there any means of detaining <NAME> in the car , to avoid a meeting between him and the colonel ?
It ought not to be a difficult task , since that gentleman was naturally sedentary and little curious .
The detective , at least , seemed to have found a way ; for , after a few moments , he said to <NAME> , `` These are long and slow hours , sir , that we are passing on the railway . ''
`` Yes , '' replied <NAME> ; `` but they pass . ''
`` You were in the habit of playing whist , '' resumed <NAME> , `` on the steamers . ''
`` Yes ; but it would be difficult to do so here .
I have neither cards nor partners . ''
`` Oh , but we can easily buy some cards , for they are sold on all the <NAME> trains .
And as for partners , if madam plays -- '' `` Certainly , sir , '' <NAME> quickly replied ; `` I understand whist .
It is part of an <NAME> education . ''
`` I myself have some pretensions to playing a good game .
Well , here are three of us , and a dummy -- '' `` As you please , sir , '' replied <NAME> , heartily glad to resume his favourite pastime even on the railway .
<NAME> was dispatched in search of the steward , and soon returned with two packs of cards , some pins , counters , and a shelf covered with cloth .
<NAME> understood whist sufficiently well , and even received some compliments on her playing from <NAME> .
As for the detective , he was simply an adept , and worthy of being matched against his present opponent .
`` Now , '' thought <NAME> , `` we 've got him .
At eleven in the morning the train had reached the dividing ridge of the waters at <NAME> , seven thousand five hundred and twenty-four feet above the level of the sea , one of the highest points attained by the track in crossing the <NAME> .
After going about two hundred miles , the travellers at last found themselves on one of those vast plains which extend to the <NAME> , and which nature has made so propitious for laying the iron road .
On the declivity of the <NAME> basin the first streams , branches of the <NAME> , already appeared .
The whole northern and eastern horizon was bounded by the immense semi-circular curtain which is formed by the southern portion of the <NAME> , the highest being <NAME> .
Between this and the railway extended vast plains , plentifully irrigated .
On the right rose the lower spurs of the mountainous mass which extends southward to the sources of the <NAME> , one of the great tributaries of the <NAME> .
At half-past twelve the travellers caught sight for an instant of <NAME> , which commands that section ; and in a few more hours the <NAME> were crossed .
There was reason to hope , then , that no accident would mark the journey through this difficult country .
The snow had ceased falling , and the air became crisp and cold .
<NAME> birds , frightened by the locomotive , rose and flew off in the distance .
No wild beast appeared on the plain .
It was a desert in its vast nakedness .
After a comfortable breakfast , served in the car , <NAME> and his partners had just resumed whist , when a violent whistling was heard , and the train stopped .
<NAME> put his head out of the door , but saw nothing to cause the delay ; no station was in view .
<NAME> and <NAME> feared that <NAME> might take it into his head to get out ; but that gentleman contented himself with saying to his servant , `` See what is the matter . ''
Passepartout rushed out of the car .
<NAME> or forty passengers had already descended , amongst them <NAME> Proctor .
The train had stopped before a red signal which blocked the way .
The engineer and conductor were talking excitedly with a signal-man , whom the station-master at <NAME> , the next stopping place , had sent on before .
The passengers drew around and took part in the discussion , in which <NAME> , with his insolent manner , was conspicuous .
<NAME> , joining the group , heard the signal-man say , `` No !
The bridge at <NAME> is shaky , and would not bear the weight of the train . ''
This was a suspension-bridge thrown over some rapids , about a mile from the place where they now were .
According to the signal-man , it was in a ruinous condition , several of the iron wires being broken ; and it was impossible to risk the passage .
He did not in any way exaggerate the condition of the bridge .
It may be taken for granted that , rash as the Americans usually are , when they are prudent there is good reason for it .
<NAME> , not daring to apprise his master of what he heard , listened with set teeth , immovable as a statue .
cried <NAME> Proctor ; `` but we are not going to stay here , I imagine , and take root in the snow ? ''
`` Colonel , '' replied the conductor , `` we have telegraphed to <NAME> for a train , but it is not likely that it will reach <NAME> in less than six hours . ''
`` Certainly , '' returned the conductor , `` besides , it will take us as long as that to reach <NAME> on foot . ''
`` But it is only a mile from here , '' said one of the passengers .
`` Yes , but it 's on the other side of the river . ''
`` And ca n't we cross that in a boat ? ''
The creek is swelled by the rains .
It is a rapid , and we shall have to make a circuit of ten miles to the north to find a ford . ''
The colonel launched a volley of oaths , denouncing the railway company and the conductor ; and <NAME> , who was furious , was not disinclined to make common cause with him .
Here was an obstacle , indeed , which all his master 's banknotes could not remove .
There was a general disappointment among the passengers , who , without reckoning the delay , saw themselves compelled to trudge fifteen miles over a plain covered with snow .
They grumbled and protested , and would certainly have thus attracted <NAME> 's attention if he had not been completely absorbed in his game .
<NAME> found that he could not avoid telling his master what had occurred , and , with hanging head , he was turning towards the car , when the engineer , a true <NAME> , named <NAME> called out , `` Gentlemen , perhaps there is a way , after all , to get over . ''
<NAME> stopped short , and eagerly listened to the engineer .
`` But the bridge is unsafe , '' urged the conductor .
`` No matter , '' replied Forster ; `` I think that by putting on the very highest speed we might have a chance of getting over . ''
But a number of the passengers were at once attracted by the engineer 's proposal , and <NAME> Proctor was especially delighted , and found the plan a very feasible one .
He told stories about engineers leaping their trains over rivers without bridges , by putting on full steam ; and many of those present avowed themselves of the engineer 's mind .
`` We have fifty chances out of a hundred of getting over , '' said one .
<NAME> was astounded , and , though ready to attempt anything to get over <NAME> , thought the experiment proposed a little too <NAME> .
`` Besides , '' thought he , `` there 's a still more simple way , and it does not even occur to any of these people !
<NAME> , '' said he aloud to one of the passengers , `` the engineer 's plan seems to me a little dangerous , but -- '' `` Eighty chances ! ''
replied the passenger , turning his back on him .
`` I know it , '' said <NAME> , turning to another passenger , `` but a simple idea -- '' `` Ideas are no use , '' returned the <NAME> , shrugging his shoulders , `` as the engineer assures us that we can pass . ''
`` Doubtless , '' urged <NAME> , `` we can pass , but perhaps it would be more prudent -- '' `` What !
cried <NAME> , whom this word seemed to excite prodigiously .
`` At full speed , do n't you see , at full speed ! ''
`` I know -- I see , '' repeated <NAME> ; `` but it would be , if not more prudent , since that word displeases you , at least more natural -- '' `` Who !
What 's the matter with this fellow ? ''
The poor fellow did not know to whom to address himself .
Very well ; I will show these people that a Frenchman can be as <NAME> as they ! ''
`` But they ca n't prevent me from thinking that it would be more natural for us to cross the bridge on foot , and let the train come after ! ''
But no one heard this sage reflection , nor would anyone have acknowledged its justice .
The passengers resumed their places in the cars .
<NAME> took his seat without telling what had passed .
The whist-players were quite absorbed in their game .
The locomotive whistled vigorously ; the engineer , reversing the steam , backed the train for nearly a mile -- retiring , like a jumper , in order to take a longer leap .
Then , with another whistle , he began to move forward ; the train increased its speed , and soon its rapidity became frightful ; a prolonged screech issued from the locomotive ; the piston worked up and down twenty strokes to the second .
They perceived that the whole train , rushing on at the rate of a hundred miles an hour , hardly bore upon the rails at all .
It was like a flash .
No one saw the bridge .
The train leaped , so to speak , from one bank to the other , and the engineer could not stop it until it had gone five miles beyond the station .
But scarcely had the train passed the river , when the bridge , completely ruined , fell with a crash into the rapids of <NAME> .
The train pursued its course , that evening , without interruption , passing <NAME> , crossing <NAME> , and reaching <NAME> .
The road here attained the highest elevation of the journey , eight thousand and ninety-two feet above the level of the sea .
The travellers had now only to descend to the <NAME> by limitless plains , levelled by nature .
A branch of the `` grand trunk '' led off southward to <NAME> , the capital of <NAME> .
The country round about is rich in gold and silver , and more than fifty thousand inhabitants are already settled there .
Thirteen hundred and eighty-two miles had been passed over from <NAME> , in three days and three nights ; four days and nights more would probably bring them to <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> was not as yet behind-hand .
During the night <NAME> was passed on the left ; <NAME> ran parallel with the road , marking the boundary between the territories of <NAME> and <NAME> .
They entered <NAME> at eleven , passed near <NAME> , and touched at <NAME> , on the southern branch of the <NAME> .
It was here that the <NAME> was inaugurated on the 23rd of October , 1867 , by the chief engineer , <NAME> .
Two powerful locomotives , carrying nine cars of invited guests , amongst whom was <NAME> , vice-president of the road , stopped at this point ; cheers were given , the <NAME> and <NAME> performed an imitation <NAME> battle , fireworks were let off , and the first number of the <NAME> was printed by a press brought on the train .
Thus was celebrated the inauguration of this great railroad , a mighty instrument of progress and civilisation , thrown across the desert , and destined to link together cities and towns which do not yet exist .
The whistle of the locomotive , more powerful than <NAME> 's lyre , was about to bid them rise from <NAME> soil .
Fort McPherson was left behind at eight in the morning , and three hundred and fifty-seven miles had yet to be traversed before reaching <NAME> .
The road followed the capricious windings of the southern branch of the <NAME> , on its left bank .
At nine the train stopped at the important town of <NAME> , built between the two arms of the river , which rejoin each other around it and form a single artery , a large tributary , whose waters empty into the Missouri a little above <NAME> .
The one hundred and first meridian was passed .
<NAME> <NAME> and his partners had resumed their game ; no one -- not even the dummy -- complained of the length of the trip .
<NAME> had begun by winning several guineas , which he seemed likely to lose ; but he showed himself a not less eager whist-player than <NAME> .
During the morning , chance distinctly favoured that gentleman .
Trumps and honours were showered upon his hands .
Once , having resolved on a bold stroke , he was on the point of playing a spade , when a voice behind him said , `` I should play a diamond . ''
<NAME> <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> raised their heads , and beheld <NAME> Proctor .
<NAME> Proctor and <NAME> recognised each other at once .
it 's you , is it , <NAME> ? ''
cried the colonel ; `` it 's you who are going to play a spade ! ''
`` And who plays it , '' replied <NAME> coolly , throwing down the ten of spades .
`` Well , it pleases me to have it diamonds , '' replied <NAME> , in an insolent tone .
He made a movement as if to seize the card which had just been played , adding , `` You do n't understand anything about whist . ''
`` Perhaps I do , as well as another , '' said <NAME> , rising .
`` You have only to try , son of <NAME> , '' replied the colonel .
<NAME> turned pale , and her blood ran cold .
She seized <NAME> 's arm and gently pulled him back .
<NAME> was ready to pounce upon the <NAME> , who was staring insolently at his opponent .
But <NAME> got up , and , going to <NAME> Proctor said , `` You forget that it is I with whom you have to deal , sir ; for it was I whom you not only insulted , but struck ! ''
<NAME> , '' said <NAME> , `` pardon me , but this affair is mine , and mine only .
The colonel has again insulted me , by insisting that I should not play a spade , and he shall give me satisfaction for it . ''
`` When and where you will , '' replied the <NAME> , `` and with whatever weapon you choose . ''
<NAME> in vain attempted to retain <NAME> ; as vainly did the detective endeavour to make the quarrel his .
Passepartout wished to throw the colonel out of the window , but a sign from his master checked him .
<NAME> <NAME> left the car , and the <NAME> followed him upon the platform .
`` Sir , '' said <NAME> to his adversary , `` I am in a great hurry to get back to <NAME> , and any delay whatever will be greatly to my disadvantage . ''
`` Well , what 's that to me ? ''
`` Sir , '' said <NAME> , very politely , `` after our meeting at <NAME> , I determined to return to <NAME> and find you as soon as I had completed the business which called me to <NAME> . ''
`` Will you appoint a meeting for six months hence ? ''
`` Why not ten years hence ? ''
`` I say six months , '' returned <NAME> ; `` and I shall be at the place of meeting promptly . ''
`` All this is an evasion , '' cried <NAME> .
You are going to <NAME> ? ''
`` What difference is it to you ?
Do you know <NAME> ? ''
The train will be there in an hour , and will stop there ten minutes .
In ten minutes several revolver-shots could be exchanged . ''
`` Very well , '' said <NAME> .
`` I will stop at <NAME> . ''
`` And I guess you 'll stay there too , '' added the <NAME> insolently .
replied <NAME> , returning to the car as coolly as usual .
He began to reassure <NAME> , telling her that blusterers were never to be feared , and begged <NAME> to be his second at the approaching duel , a request which the detective could not refuse .
<NAME> <NAME> resumed the interrupted game with perfect calmness .
At eleven o'clock the locomotive 's whistle announced that they were approaching <NAME> station .
<NAME> <NAME> rose , and , followed by <NAME> , went out upon the platform .
<NAME> accompanied him , carrying a pair of revolvers .
<NAME> remained in the car , as pale as death .
The door of the next car opened , and <NAME> Proctor appeared on the platform , attended by a <NAME> of his own stamp as his second .
But just as the combatants were about to step from the train , the conductor hurried up , and shouted , `` You ca n't get off , gentlemen ! ''
`` We are twenty minutes late , and we shall not stop . ''
`` But I am going to fight a duel with this gentleman . ''
`` I am sorry , '' said the conductor ; `` but we shall be off at once .
There 's the bell ringing now . ''
`` I 'm really very sorry , gentlemen , '' said the conductor .
`` Under any other circumstances I should have been happy to oblige you .
But , after all , as you have not had time to fight here , why not fight as we go along ? ''
`` That would n't be convenient , perhaps , for this gentleman , '' said the colonel , in a jeering tone .
`` It would be perfectly so , '' replied <NAME> .
`` Well , we are really in <NAME> , '' thought <NAME> , `` and the conductor is a gentleman of the first order ! ''
So muttering , he followed his master .
The two combatants , their seconds , and the conductor passed through the cars to the rear of the train .
The last car was only occupied by a dozen passengers , whom the conductor politely asked if they would not be so kind as to leave it vacant for a few moments , as two gentlemen had an affair of honour to settle .
The passengers granted the request with alacrity , and straightway disappeared on the platform .
The car , which was some fifty feet long , was very convenient for their purpose .
The adversaries might march on each other in the aisle , and fire at their ease .
<NAME> was duel more easily arranged .
<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> , each provided with two six-barrelled revolvers , entered the car .
The seconds , remaining outside , shut them in .
They were to begin firing at the first whistle of the locomotive .
After an interval of two minutes , what remained of the two gentlemen would be taken from the car .
Nothing could be more simple .
Indeed , it was all so simple that <NAME> and <NAME> felt their hearts beating as if they would crack .
They were listening for the whistle agreed upon , when suddenly savage cries resounded in the air , accompanied by reports which certainly did not issue from the car where the duellists were .
The reports continued in front and the whole length of the train .
Cries of terror proceeded from the interior of the cars .
<NAME> Proctor and <NAME> , revolvers in hand , hastily quitted their prison , and rushed forward where the noise was most clamorous .
They then perceived that the train was attacked by a band of <NAME> .
This was not the first attempt of these daring <NAME> , for more than once they had waylaid trains on the road .
A hundred of them had , according to their habit , jumped upon the steps without stopping the train , with the ease of a clown mounting a horse at full gallop .
The Sioux were armed with guns , from which came the reports , to which the passengers , who were almost all armed , responded by revolver-shots .
The <NAME> had first mounted the engine , and half stunned the engineer and stoker with blows from their muskets .
A Sioux chief , wishing to stop the train , but not knowing how to work the regulator , had opened wide instead of closing the steam-valve , and the locomotive was plunging forward with terrific velocity .
The <NAME> had at the same time invaded the cars , skipping like enraged monkeys over the roofs , thrusting open the doors , and fighting hand to hand with the passengers .
Penetrating the baggage-car , they pillaged it , throwing the trunks out of the train .
The cries and shots were constant .
The travellers defended themselves bravely ; some of the cars were barricaded , and sustained a siege , like moving forts , carried along at a speed of a hundred miles an hour .
<NAME> behaved courageously from the first .
She defended herself like a true heroine with a revolver , which she shot through the broken windows whenever a savage made his appearance .
<NAME> <NAME> had fallen mortally wounded to the ground , and the wheels crushed those who fell upon the rails as if they had been worms .
Several passengers , shot or stunned , lay on the seats .
It was necessary to put an end to the struggle , which had lasted for ten minutes , and which would result in the triumph of the Sioux if the train was not stopped .
Fort Kearney station , where there was a garrison , was only two miles distant ; but , that once passed , the <NAME> would be masters of the train between <NAME> and the station beyond .
The conductor was fighting beside <NAME> , when he was shot and fell .
At the same moment he cried , `` Unless the train is stopped in five minutes , we are lost ! ''
`` It shall be stopped , '' said <NAME> , preparing to rush from the car .
`` Stay , monsieur , '' cried <NAME> ; `` I will go . ''
<NAME> <NAME> had not time to stop the brave fellow , who , opening a door unperceived by the <NAME> , succeeded in slipping under the car ; and while the struggle continued and the balls whizzed across each other over his head , he made use of his old acrobatic experience , and with amazing agility worked his way under the cars , holding on to the chains , aiding himself by the brakes and edges of the sashes , creeping from one car to another with marvellous skill , and thus gaining the forward end of the train .
There , suspended by one hand between the baggage-car and the tender , with the other he loosened the safety chains ; but , owing to the traction , he would never have succeeded in unscrewing the yoking-bar , had not a violent concussion jolted this bar out .
The train , now detached from the engine , remained a little behind , whilst the locomotive rushed forward with increased speed .
Carried on by the force already acquired , the train still moved for several minutes ; but the brakes were worked and at last they stopped , less than a hundred feet from <NAME> station .
The soldiers of the fort , attracted by the shots , hurried up ; the <NAME> had not expected them , and decamped in a body before the train entirely stopped .
But when the passengers counted each other on the station platform several were found missing ; among others the courageous <NAME> , whose devotion had just saved them .
Three passengers including <NAME> had disappeared .
Had they been killed in the struggle ?
Were they taken prisoners by the <NAME> ?
It was impossible to tell .
There were many wounded , but none mortally .
<NAME> Proctor was one of the most seriously hurt ; he had fought bravely , and a ball had entered his groin .
He was carried into the station with the other wounded passengers , to receive such attention as could be of avail .
<NAME> was safe ; and <NAME> , who had been in the thickest of the fight , had not received a scratch .
<NAME> was slightly wounded in the arm .
But <NAME> was not to be found , and tears coursed down <NAME> 's cheeks .
All the passengers had got out of the train , the wheels of which were stained with blood .
From the tyres and spokes hung ragged pieces of flesh .
As far as the eye could reach on the white plain behind , red trails were visible .
The last Sioux were disappearing in the south , along the banks of <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> , with folded arms , remained motionless .
He had a serious decision to make .
<NAME> , standing near him , looked at him without speaking , and he understood her look .
If his servant was a prisoner , ought he not to risk everything to rescue him from the <NAME> ?
`` I will find him , living or dead , '' said he quietly to <NAME> .
cried she , clasping his hands and covering them with tears .
`` Living , '' added <NAME> , `` if we do not lose a moment . ''
<NAME> <NAME> , by this resolution , inevitably sacrificed himself ; he pronounced his own doom .
The delay of a single day would make him lose the steamer at <NAME> , and his bet would be certainly lost .
But as he thought , `` It is my duty , '' he did not hesitate .
The commanding officer of <NAME> was there .
A hundred of his soldiers had placed themselves in a position to defend the station , should the <NAME> attack it .
`` Sir , '' said <NAME> to the captain , `` three passengers have disappeared . ''
`` Dead or prisoners ; that is the uncertainty which must be solved .
Do you propose to pursue the <NAME> ? ''
`` That 's a serious thing to do , sir , '' returned the captain .
`` These Indians may retreat beyond the <NAME> , and I can not leave the fort unprotected . ''
`` The lives of three men are in question , sir , '' said <NAME> .
`` <NAME> ; but can I risk the lives of fifty men to save three ? ''
`` I do n't know whether you can , sir ; but you ought to do so . ''
`` Nobody here , '' returned the other , `` has a right to teach me my duty . ''
`` Very well , '' said <NAME> , coldly .
cried Fix , coming up ; `` you go alone in pursuit of the <NAME> ? ''
`` Would you have me leave this poor fellow to perish -- him to whom every one present owes his life ?
`` No , sir , you shall not go alone , '' cried the captain , touched in spite of himself .
you are a brave man .
he added , turning to the soldiers .
The whole company started forward at once .
The captain had only to pick his men .
Thirty were chosen , and an old sergeant placed at their head .
`` Thanks , captain , '' said <NAME> .
`` Will you let me go with you ? ''
`` Do as you please , sir .
But if you wish to do me a favour , you will remain with <NAME> .
In case anything should happen to me -- '' A sudden pallor overspread the detective 's face .
Separate himself from the man whom he had so persistently followed step by step !
Leave him to wander about in this desert !
<NAME> gazed attentively at <NAME> , and , despite his suspicions and of the struggle which was going on within him , he lowered his eyes before that calm and frank look .
`` I will stay , '' said he .
A few moments after , <NAME> pressed the young woman 's hand , and , having confided to her his precious carpet-bag , went off with the sergeant and his little squad .
But , before going , he had said to the soldiers , `` My friends , I will divide five thousand dollars among you , if we save the prisoners . ''
It was then a little past noon .
Aouda retired to a waiting-room , and there she waited alone , thinking of the simple and noble generosity , the tranquil courage of <NAME> .
He had sacrificed his fortune , and was now risking his life , all without hesitation , from duty , in silence .
<NAME> did not have the same thoughts , and could scarcely conceal his agitation .
He walked feverishly up and down the platform , but soon resumed his outward composure .
He now saw the folly of which he had been guilty in letting <NAME> go alone .
This man , whom he had just followed around the world , was permitted now to separate himself from him !
He began to accuse and abuse himself , and , as if he were director of police , administered to himself a sound lecture for his greenness .
`` I have been an idiot ! ''
he thought , `` and this man will see it .
He has gone , and wo n't come back !
But how is it that I , <NAME> , who have in my pocket a warrant for his arrest , have been so fascinated by him ?
Decidedly , I am nothing but an ass ! ''
So reasoned the detective , while the hours crept by all too slowly .
He did not know what to do .
Sometimes he was tempted to tell <NAME> all ; but he could not doubt how the young woman would receive his confidences .
What course should he take ?
He thought of pursuing <NAME> across the vast white plains ; it did not seem impossible that he might overtake him .
Footsteps were easily printed on the snow !
But soon , under a new sheet , every imprint would be effaced .
He felt a sort of insurmountable longing to abandon the game altogether .
He could now leave <NAME> station , and pursue his journey homeward in peace .
Towards two o'clock in the afternoon , while it was snowing hard , long whistles were heard approaching from the east .
A great shadow , preceded by a wild light , slowly advanced , appearing still larger through the mist , which gave it a fantastic aspect .
No train was expected from the east , neither had there been time for the succour asked for by telegraph to arrive ; the train from <NAME> to <NAME> <NAME> was not due till the next day .
The mystery was soon explained .
The locomotive , which was slowly approaching with deafening whistles , was that which , having been detached from the train , had continued its route with such terrific rapidity , carrying off the unconscious engineer and stoker .
It had run several miles , when , the fire becoming low for want of fuel , the steam had slackened ; and it had finally stopped an hour after , some twenty miles beyond <NAME> .
Neither the engineer nor the stoker was dead , and , after remaining for some time in their swoon , had come to themselves .
The train had then stopped .
The engineer , when he found himself in the desert , and the locomotive without cars , understood what had happened .
He could not imagine how the locomotive had become separated from the train ; but he did not doubt that the train left behind was in distress .
He did not hesitate what to do .
It would be prudent to continue on to <NAME> , for it would be dangerous to return to the train , which the <NAME> might still be engaged in pillaging .
Nevertheless , he began to rebuild the fire in the furnace ; the pressure again mounted , and the locomotive returned , running backwards to <NAME> .
This it was which was whistling in the mist .
The travellers were glad to see the locomotive resume its place at the head of the train .
They could now continue the journey so terribly interrupted .
<NAME> , on seeing the locomotive come up , hurried out of the station , and asked the conductor , `` Are you going to start ? ''
`` But the prisoners , our unfortunate fellow-travellers -- '' `` I can not interrupt the trip , '' replied the conductor .
`` We are already three hours behind time . ''
`` And when will another train pass here from <NAME> ? ''
But then it will be too late !
We must wait -- '' `` It is impossible , '' responded the conductor .
`` If you wish to go , please get in . ''
`` I will not go , '' said <NAME> .
<NAME> had heard this conversation .
A little while before , when there was no prospect of proceeding on the journey , he had made up his mind to leave <NAME> ; but now that the train was there , ready to start , and he had only to take his seat in the car , an irresistible influence held him back .
The station platform burned his feet , and he could not stir .
The conflict in his mind again began ; anger and failure stifled him .
He wished to struggle on to the end .
Meanwhile the passengers and some of the wounded , among them <NAME> , whose injuries were serious , had taken their places in the train .
The buzzing of the over-heated boiler was heard , and the steam was escaping from the valves .
The engineer whistled , the train started , and soon disappeared , mingling its white smoke with the eddies of the densely falling snow .
The detective had remained behind .
The weather was dismal , and it was very cold .
<NAME> sat motionless on a bench in the station ; he might have been thought asleep .
<NAME> , despite the storm , kept coming out of the waiting-room , going to the end of the platform , and peering through the tempest of snow , as if to pierce the mist which narrowed the horizon around her , and to hear , if possible , some welcome sound .
She heard and saw nothing .
Then she would return , chilled through , to issue out again after the lapse of a few moments , but always in vain .
Evening came , and the little band had not returned .
Had they found the <NAME> , and were they having a conflict with them , or were they still wandering amid the mist ?
The commander of the fort was anxious , though he tried to conceal his apprehensions .
As night approached , the snow fell less plentifully , but it became intensely cold .
<NAME> silence rested on the plains .
Neither flight of bird nor passing of beast troubled the perfect calm .
Throughout the night <NAME> , full of sad forebodings , her heart stifled with anguish , wandered about on the verge of the plains .
Her imagination carried her far off , and showed her innumerable dangers .
What she suffered through the long hours it would be impossible to describe .
<NAME> remained stationary in the same place , but did not sleep .
Once a man approached and spoke to him , and the detective merely replied by shaking his head .
At dawn , the half-extinguished disc of the sun rose above a misty horizon ; but it was now possible to recognise objects two miles off .
<NAME> <NAME> and the squad had gone southward ; in the south all was still vacancy .
It was then seven o'clock .
The captain , who was really alarmed , did not know what course to take .
Should he send another detachment to the rescue of the first ?
Should he sacrifice more men , with so few chances of saving those already sacrificed ?
His hesitation did not last long , however .
Calling one of his lieutenants , he was on the point of ordering a reconnaissance , when gunshots were heard .
The soldiers rushed out of the fort , and half a mile off they perceived a little band returning in good order .
<NAME> <NAME> was marching at their head , and just behind him were <NAME> and the other two travellers , rescued from the <NAME> .
They had met and fought the <NAME> ten miles south of <NAME> .
Shortly before the detachment arrived , <NAME> and his companions had begun to struggle with their captors , three of whom the <NAME> had felled with his fists , when his master and the soldiers hastened up to their relief .
All were welcomed with joyful cries .
<NAME> <NAME> distributed the reward he had promised to the soldiers , while <NAME> , not without reason , muttered to himself , `` It must certainly be confessed that I cost my master dear ! ''
<NAME> , without saying a word , looked at <NAME> , and it would have been difficult to analyse the thoughts which struggled within him .
As for <NAME> , she took her protector 's hand and pressed it in her own , too much moved to speak .
Meanwhile , <NAME> was looking about for the train ; he thought he should find it there , ready to start for <NAME> , and he hoped that the time lost might be regained .
`` And when does the next train pass here ? ''
returned the impassible gentleman quietly .
<NAME> <NAME> found himself twenty hours behind time .
<NAME> , the involuntary cause of this delay , was desperate .
He had ruined his master !
At this moment the detective approached <NAME> , and , looking him intently in the face , said : `` Seriously , sir , are you in great haste ? ''
`` I have a purpose in asking , '' resumed <NAME> .
`` Is it absolutely necessary that you should be in <NAME> on the 11th , before nine o'clock in the evening , the time that the steamer leaves for <NAME> ? ''
`` And , if your journey had not been interrupted by these Indians , you would have reached <NAME> on the morning of the 11th ? ''
`` Yes ; with eleven hours to spare before the steamer left . ''
you are therefore twenty hours behind .
<NAME> from twenty leaves eight .
You must regain eight hours .
Do you wish to try to do so ? ''
`` No ; on a sledge , '' replied <NAME> .
`` On a sledge with sails .
A man has proposed such a method to me . ''
It was the man who had spoken to <NAME> during the night , and whose offer he had refused .
<NAME> <NAME> did not reply at once ; but <NAME> , having pointed out the man , who was walking up and down in front of the station , <NAME> went up to him .
An instant after , <NAME> and the <NAME> , whose name was <NAME> , entered a hut built just below the fort .
There <NAME> examined a curious vehicle , a kind of frame on two long beams , a little raised in front like the runners of a sledge , and upon which there was room for five or six persons .
A high mast was fixed on the frame , held firmly by metallic lashings , to which was attached a large brigantine sail .
This mast held an iron stay upon which to hoist a jib-sail .
<NAME> , a sort of rudder served to guide the vehicle .
It was , in short , a sledge rigged like a sloop .
During the winter , when the trains are blocked up by the snow , these sledges make extremely rapid journeys across the frozen plains from one station to another .
Provided with more sails than a cutter , and with the wind behind them , they slip over the surface of the prairies with a speed equal if not superior to that of the express trains .
<NAME> <NAME> readily made a bargain with the owner of this land-craft .
The wind was favourable , being fresh , and blowing from the west .
The snow had hardened , and <NAME> was very confident of being able to transport <NAME> in a few hours to <NAME> .
Thence the trains eastward run frequently to <NAME> and <NAME> .
It was not impossible that the lost time might yet be recovered ; and such an opportunity was not to be rejected .
Not wishing to expose <NAME> to the discomforts of travelling in the open air , <NAME> proposed to leave her with <NAME> at <NAME> , the servant taking upon himself to escort her to <NAME> by a better route and under more favourable conditions .
But <NAME> refused to separate from <NAME> , and <NAME> was delighted with her decision ; for nothing could induce him to leave his master while <NAME> was with him .
It would be difficult to guess the detective 's thoughts .
<NAME> this conviction shaken by <NAME> 's return , or did he still regard him as an exceedingly shrewd rascal , who , his journey round the world completed , would think himself absolutely safe in <NAME> ?
Perhaps <NAME> 's opinion of <NAME> was somewhat modified ; but he was nevertheless resolved to do his duty , and to hasten the return of the whole party to <NAME> as much as possible .
At eight o'clock the sledge was ready to start .
The passengers took their places on it , and wrapped themselves up closely in their travelling-cloaks .
The two great sails were hoisted , and under the pressure of the wind the sledge slid over the hardened snow with a velocity of forty miles an hour .
The distance between <NAME> and <NAME> , as the birds fly , is at most two hundred miles .
If the wind held good , the distance might be traversed in five hours ; if no accident happened the sledge might reach <NAME> by one o'clock .
The travellers , huddled close together , could not speak for the cold , intensified by the rapidity at which they were going .
The sledge sped on as lightly as a boat over the waves .
When the breeze came skimming the earth the sledge seemed to be lifted off the ground by its sails .
<NAME> , who was at the rudder , kept in a straight line , and by a turn of his hand checked the lurches which the vehicle had a tendency to make .
All the sails were up , and the jib was so arranged as not to screen the brigantine .
A top-mast was hoisted , and another jib , held out to the wind , added its force to the other sails .
Although the speed could not be exactly estimated , the sledge could not be going at less than forty miles an hour .
`` If nothing breaks , '' said <NAME> , `` we shall get there ! ''
<NAME> <NAME> had made it for <NAME> 's interest to reach <NAME> within the time agreed on , by the offer of a handsome reward .
The prairie , across which the sledge was moving in a straight line , was as flat as a sea .
It seemed like a vast frozen lake .
The railroad which ran through this section ascended from the south-west to the north-west by <NAME> , <NAME> , an important Nebraska town , <NAME> , and <NAME> , to <NAME> .
It followed throughout the right bank of the <NAME> .
The sledge , shortening this route , took a chord of the arc described by the railway .
<NAME> was not afraid of being stopped by the <NAME> , because it was frozen .
The road , then , was quite clear of obstacles , and <NAME> had but two things to fear -- an accident to the sledge , and a change or calm in the wind .
But the breeze , far from lessening its force , blew as if to bend the mast , which , however , the metallic lashings held firmly .
These lashings , like the chords of a stringed instrument , resounded as if vibrated by a violin bow .
The sledge slid along in the midst of a plaintively intense melody .
`` Those chords give the fifth and the octave , '' said <NAME> .
These were the only words he uttered during the journey .
<NAME> , cosily packed in furs and cloaks , was sheltered as much as possible from the attacks of the freezing wind .
As for <NAME> , his face was as red as the sun 's disc when it sets in the mist , and he laboriously inhaled the biting air .
With his natural buoyancy of spirits , he began to hope again .
They would reach <NAME> on the evening , if not on the morning , of the 11th , and there was still some chances that it would be before the steamer sailed for <NAME> .
Passepartout even felt a strong desire to grasp his ally , <NAME> , by the hand .
He remembered that it was the detective who procured the sledge , the only means of reaching <NAME> in time ; but , checked by some presentiment , he kept his usual reserve .
One thing , however , <NAME> would never forget , and that was the sacrifice which <NAME> had made , without hesitation , to rescue him from the <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> had risked his fortune and his life .
His servant would never forget that !
While each of the party was absorbed in reflections so different , the sledge flew past over the vast carpet of snow .
The creeks it passed over were not perceived .
Fields and streams disappeared under the uniform whiteness .
The plain was absolutely deserted .
Between the <NAME> road and the branch which unites <NAME> with <NAME> it formed a great uninhabited island .
Neither village , station , nor fort appeared .
From time to time they sped by some phantom-like tree , whose white skeleton twisted and rattled in the wind .
Sometimes flocks of wild birds rose , or bands of gaunt , famished , ferocious prairie-wolves ran howling after the sledge .
<NAME> , revolver in hand , held himself ready to fire on those which came too near .
Had an accident then happened to the sledge , the travellers , attacked by these beasts , would have been in the most terrible danger ; but it held on its even course , soon gained on the wolves , and ere long left the howling band at a safe distance behind .
About noon Mudge perceived by certain landmarks that he was crossing the <NAME> .
He said nothing , but he felt certain that he was now within twenty miles of <NAME> .
In less than an hour he left the rudder and furled his sails , whilst the sledge , carried forward by the great impetus the wind had given it , went on half a mile further with its sails unspread .
It stopped at last , and <NAME> , pointing to a mass of roofs white with snow , said : `` We have got there ! ''
Arrived at the station which is in daily communication , by numerous trains , with the <NAME> seaboard !
<NAME> and <NAME> jumped off , stretched their stiffened limbs , and aided <NAME> and the young woman to descend from the sledge .
<NAME> <NAME> generously rewarded <NAME> , whose hand Passepartout warmly grasped , and the party directed their steps to the <NAME> railway station .
The <NAME> proper finds its terminus at this important Nebraska town .
<NAME> is connected with <NAME> by the <NAME> and <NAME> , which runs directly east , and passes fifty stations .
A train was ready to start when <NAME> and his party reached the station , and they only had time to get into the cars .
They had seen nothing of <NAME> ; but <NAME> confessed to himself that this was not to be regretted , as they were not travelling to see the sights .
The train passed rapidly across the State of <NAME> , by <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> .
During the night it crossed the <NAME> at <NAME> , and by <NAME> entered <NAME> .
The next day , which was the 10th , at four o'clock in the evening , it reached <NAME> , already risen from its ruins , and more proudly seated than ever on the borders of its beautiful <NAME> .
Nine hundred miles separated <NAME> from <NAME> ; but trains are not wanting at <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> passed at once from one to the other , and the locomotive of the <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> <NAME> left at full speed , as if it fully comprehended that that gentleman had no time to lose .
It traversed <NAME> , <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> like a flash , rushing through towns with antique names , some of which had streets and car-tracks , but as yet no houses .
At last the <NAME> came into view ; and , at a quarter-past eleven in the evening of the 11th , the train stopped in the station on the right bank of the river , before the very pier of the <NAME> line .
The <NAME> , for <NAME> , had started three-quarters of an hour before !
The <NAME> , in leaving , seemed to have carried off <NAME> 's last hope .
None of the other steamers were able to serve his projects .
The <NAME> , of the <NAME> <NAME> , whose admirable steamers are equal to any in speed and comfort , did not leave until the 14th ; the <NAME> boats did not go directly to <NAME> or <NAME> , but to <NAME> ; and the additional trip from <NAME> to <NAME> would render <NAME> 's last efforts of no avail .
The <NAME> steamer did not depart till the next day , and could not cross the <NAME> in time to save the wager .
<NAME> <NAME> learned all this in consulting his <NAME> , which gave him the daily movements of the trans-Atlantic steamers .
<NAME> was crushed ; it overwhelmed him to lose the boat by three-quarters of an hour .
It was his fault , for , instead of helping his master , he had not ceased putting obstacles in his path !
And when he recalled all the incidents of the tour , when he counted up the sums expended in pure loss and on his own account , when he thought that the immense stake , added to the heavy charges of this useless journey , would completely ruin <NAME> , he overwhelmed himself with bitter self-accusations .
<NAME> <NAME> , however , did not reproach him ; and , on leaving the <NAME> pier , only said : `` We will consult about what is best to-morrow .
The party crossed the <NAME> in the <NAME> ferryboat , and drove in a carriage to the <NAME> , on <NAME> .
Rooms were engaged , and the night passed , briefly to <NAME> , who slept profoundly , but very long to <NAME> and the others , whose agitation did not permit them to rest .
The next day was the 12th of December .
From seven in the morning of the 12th to a quarter before nine in the evening of the 21st there were nine days , thirteen hours , and forty-five minutes .
If <NAME> had left in the <NAME> , one of the fastest steamers on the <NAME> , he would have reached <NAME> , and then <NAME> , within the period agreed upon .
<NAME> <NAME> left the hotel alone , after giving Passepartout instructions to await his return , and inform <NAME> to be ready at an instant 's notice .
He proceeded to the banks of the <NAME> , and looked about among the vessels moored or anchored in the river , for any that were about to depart .
Several had departure signals , and were preparing to put to sea at morning tide ; for in this immense and admirable port there is not one day in a hundred that vessels do not set out for every quarter of the globe .
But they were mostly sailing vessels , of which , of course , <NAME> could make no use .
He seemed about to give up all hope , when he espied , anchored at the <NAME> , a cable 's length off at most , a trading vessel , with a screw , well-shaped , whose funnel , puffing a cloud of smoke , indicated that she was getting ready for departure .
<NAME> <NAME> hailed a boat , got into it , and soon found himself on board the <NAME> , iron-hulled , wood-built above .
He ascended to the deck , and asked for the captain , who forthwith presented himself .
He was a man of fifty , a sort of sea-wolf , with big eyes , a complexion of oxidised copper , red hair and thick neck , and a growling voice .
`` I am <NAME> , of <NAME> . ''
`` And I am <NAME> , of <NAME> . ''
`` You are going to put to sea ? ''
`` You are bound for -- '' `` Bordeaux . ''
Too much in the way . ''
`` Is your vessel a swift one ? ''
`` Between eleven and twelve knots .
`` Will you carry me and three other persons to Liverpool ? ''
I am setting out for <NAME> , and shall go to <NAME> . ''
The captain spoke in a tone which did not admit of a reply .
`` But the owners of the <NAME> -- '' resumed <NAME> .
`` The owners are myself , '' replied the captain .
`` The vessel belongs to me . ''
`` I will freight it for you . ''
`` I will buy it of you . ''
<NAME> <NAME> did not betray the least disappointment ; but the situation was a grave one .
It was not at <NAME> as at <NAME> , nor with the captain of the <NAME> as with the captain of the Tankadere .
Up to this time money had smoothed away every obstacle .
Still , some means must be found to cross the <NAME> on a boat , unless by balloon -- which would have been venturesome , besides not being capable of being put in practice .
It seemed that <NAME> had an idea , for he said to the captain , `` Well , will you carry me to Bordeaux ? ''
`` No , not if you paid me two hundred dollars . ''
`` I offer you two thousand . ''
`` And there are four of you ? ''
<NAME> <NAME> began to scratch his head .
There were eight thousand dollars to gain , without changing his route ; for which it was well worth conquering the repugnance he had for all kinds of passengers .
Besides , passengers at two thousand dollars are no longer passengers , but valuable merchandise .
`` I start at nine o'clock , '' said <NAME> , simply .
`` Are you and your party ready ? ''
`` We will be on board at nine o'clock , '' replied , no less simply , <NAME> .
To disembark from the <NAME> , jump into a hack , hurry to the <NAME> , and return with <NAME> , <NAME> , and even the inseparable <NAME> was the work of a brief time , and was performed by <NAME> with the coolness which never abandoned him .
They were on board when the <NAME> made ready to weigh anchor .
When <NAME> heard what this last voyage was going to cost , he uttered a prolonged `` Oh ! ''
which extended throughout his vocal gamut .
As for <NAME> , he said to himself that the <NAME> of <NAME> would certainly not come out of this affair well indemnified .
When they reached <NAME> , even if <NAME> did not throw some handfuls of bank-bills into the sea , more than seven thousand pounds would have been spent !
An hour after , the <NAME> passed the lighthouse which marks the entrance of the <NAME> , turned the point of <NAME> , and put to sea .
During the day she skirted <NAME> , passed <NAME> , and directed her course rapidly eastward .
At noon the next day , a man mounted the bridge to ascertain the vessel 's position .
It might be thought that this was <NAME> .
Not the least in the world .
It was <NAME> , <NAME> .
As for <NAME> , he was shut up in his cabin under lock and key , and was uttering loud cries , which signified an anger at once pardonable and excessive .
What had happened was very simple .
<NAME> <NAME> wished to go to <NAME> , but the captain would not carry him there .
Then <NAME> had taken passage for <NAME> , and , during the thirty hours he had been on board , had so shrewdly managed with his banknotes that the sailors and stokers , who were only an occasional crew , and were not on the best terms with the captain , went over to him in a body .
This was why <NAME> was in command instead of <NAME> ; why the captain was a prisoner in his cabin ; and why , in short , the <NAME> was directing her course towards <NAME> .
It was very clear , to see <NAME> manage the craft , that he had been a sailor .
How the adventure ended will be seen anon .
<NAME> was anxious , though she said nothing .
As for <NAME> , he thought <NAME> 's manoeuvre simply glorious .
The captain had said `` between eleven and twelve knots , '' and the <NAME> confirmed his prediction .
If , then -- for there were `` ifs '' still -- the sea did not become too boisterous , if the wind did not veer round to the east , if no accident happened to the boat or its machinery , the <NAME> might cross the three thousand miles from <NAME> to <NAME> in the nine days , between the 12th and the 21st of December .
It is true that , once arrived , the affair on board the <NAME> , added to that of the <NAME> of <NAME> , might create more difficulties for <NAME> than he imagined or could desire .
During the first days , they went along smoothly enough .
The sea was not very unpropitious , the wind seemed stationary in the north-east , the sails were hoisted , and the <NAME> ploughed across the waves like a real trans-Atlantic steamer .
His master 's last exploit , the consequences of which he ignored , enchanted him .
Never had the crew seen so jolly and dexterous a fellow .
He formed warm friendships with the sailors , and amazed them with his acrobatic feats .
He thought they managed the vessel like gentlemen , and that the stokers fired up like heroes .
His loquacious good-humour infected everyone .
He had forgotten the past , its vexations and delays .
He only thought of the end , so nearly accomplished ; and sometimes he boiled over with impatience , as if heated by the furnaces of the <NAME> .
Often , also , the worthy fellow revolved around <NAME> , looking at him with a keen , distrustful eye ; but he did not speak to him , for their old intimacy no longer existed .
<NAME> , it must be confessed , understood nothing of what was going on .
The conquest of the <NAME> , the bribery of the crew , <NAME> managing the boat like a skilled seaman , amazed and confused him .
He did not know what to think .
For , after all , a man who began by stealing fifty-five thousand pounds might end by stealing a vessel ; and <NAME> was not unnaturally inclined to conclude that the <NAME> under <NAME> 's command , was not going to <NAME> at all , but to some part of the world where the robber , turned into a pirate , would quietly put himself in safety .
The conjecture was at least a plausible one , and the detective began to seriously regret that he had embarked on the affair .
As for <NAME> , he continued to howl and growl in his cabin ; and <NAME> , whose duty it was to carry him his meals , courageous as he was , took the greatest precautions .
<NAME> <NAME> did not seem even to know that there was a captain on board .
On the 13th they passed the edge of the <NAME> of <NAME> , a dangerous locality ; during the winter , especially , there are frequent fogs and heavy gales of wind .
Ever since the evening before the barometer , suddenly falling , had indicated an approaching change in the atmosphere ; and during the night the temperature varied , the cold became sharper , and the wind veered to the south-east .
<NAME> <NAME> , in order not to deviate from his course , furled his sails and increased the force of the steam ; but the vessel 's speed slackened , owing to the state of the sea , the long waves of which broke against the stern .
She pitched violently , and this retarded her progress .
The breeze little by little swelled into a tempest , and it was to be feared that the <NAME> might not be able to maintain herself upright on the waves .
<NAME> 's visage darkened with the skies , and for two days the poor fellow experienced constant fright .
But <NAME> was a bold mariner , and knew how to maintain headway against the sea ; and he kept on his course , without even decreasing his steam .
The <NAME> , when she could not rise upon the waves , crossed them , swamping her deck , but passing safely .
Sometimes the screw rose out of the water , beating its protruding end , when a mountain of water raised the stern above the waves ; but the craft always kept straight ahead .
The wind , however , did not grow as boisterous as might have been feared ; it was not one of those tempests which burst , and rush on with a speed of ninety miles an hour .
It continued fresh , but , unhappily , it remained obstinately in the south-east , rendering the sails useless .
The 16th of December was the seventy-fifth day since <NAME> 's departure from <NAME> , and the <NAME> had not yet been seriously delayed .
Half of the voyage was almost accomplished , and the worst localities had been passed .
In summer , success would have been well-nigh certain .
In winter , they were at the mercy of the bad season .
<NAME> said nothing ; but he cherished hope in secret , and comforted himself with the reflection that , if the wind failed them , they might still count on the steam .
On this day the engineer came on deck , went up to <NAME> , and began to speak earnestly with him .
Without knowing why it was a presentiment , perhaps <NAME> became vaguely uneasy .
He would have given one of his ears to hear with the other what the engineer was saying .
He finally managed to catch a few words , and was sure he heard his master say , `` You are certain of what you tell me ? ''
`` <NAME> , sir , '' replied the engineer .
`` You must remember that , since we started , we have kept up hot fires in all our furnaces , and , though we had coal enough to go on short steam from <NAME> to <NAME> , we have n't enough to go with all steam from <NAME> to <NAME> . ''
`` I will consider , '' replied <NAME> .
Passepartout understood it all ; he was seized with mortal anxiety .
The coal was giving out !
`` Ah , if my master can get over that , '' muttered he , `` he 'll be a famous man ! ''
He could not help imparting to Fix what he had overheard .
`` Then you believe that we really are going to Liverpool ? ''
replied the detective , shrugging his shoulders and turning on his heel .
<NAME> was on the point of vigorously resenting the epithet , the reason of which he could not for the life of him comprehend ; but he reflected that the unfortunate <NAME> was probably very much disappointed and humiliated in his self-esteem , after having so awkwardly followed a false scent around the world , and refrained .
And now what course would Phileas <NAME> adopt ?
It was difficult to imagine .
Nevertheless he seemed to have decided upon one , for that evening he sent for the engineer , and said to him , `` Feed all the fires until the coal is exhausted . ''
A few moments after , the funnel of the <NAME> vomited forth torrents of smoke .
The vessel continued to proceed with all steam on ; but on the 18th , the engineer , as he had predicted , announced that the coal would give out in the course of the day .
`` Do not let the fires go down , '' replied <NAME> .
`` Keep them up to the last .
Let the valves be filled . ''
Towards noon <NAME> , having ascertained their position , called Passepartout , and ordered him to go for <NAME> .
It was as if the honest fellow had been commanded to unchain a tiger .
He went to the poop , saying to himself , `` He will be like a madman ! ''
In a few moments , with cries and oaths , a bomb appeared on the poop-deck .
The bomb was <NAME> .
It was clear that he was on the point of bursting .
were the first words his anger permitted him to utter .
Had the poor man been an apoplectic , he could never have recovered from his paroxysm of wrath .
he repeated , with purple face .
`` Seven hundred and seven miles from <NAME> , '' replied <NAME> , with imperturbable calmness .
`` I have sent for you , sir -- '' `` Pickaroon ! ''
`` -- sir , '' continued <NAME> , `` to ask you to sell me your vessel . ''
By all the devils , no ! ''
`` But I shall be obliged to burn her . ''
`` Yes ; at least the upper part of her .
The coal has given out . ''
cried <NAME> , who could scarcely pronounce the words .
`` A vessel worth fifty thousand dollars ! ''
`` Here are sixty thousand , '' replied <NAME> , handing the captain a roll of bank-bills .
This had a prodigious effect on <NAME> .
An <NAME> can scarcely remain unmoved at the sight of sixty thousand dollars .
The captain forgot in an instant his anger , his imprisonment , and all his grudges against his passenger .
The <NAME> was twenty years old ; it was a great bargain .
The bomb would not go off after all .
<NAME> <NAME> had taken away the match .
`` And I shall still have the iron hull , '' said the captain in a softer tone .
`` The iron hull and the engine .
And <NAME> , seizing the banknotes , counted them and consigned them to his pocket .
During this colloquy , <NAME> was as white as a sheet , and <NAME> seemed on the point of having an apoplectic fit .
Nearly twenty thousand pounds had been expended , and <NAME> left the hull and engine to the captain , that is , near the whole value of the craft !
It was true , however , that fifty-five thousand pounds had been stolen from the <NAME> .
When <NAME> had pocketed the money , <NAME> said to him , `` Do n't let this astonish you , sir .
You must know that I shall lose twenty thousand pounds , unless I arrive in <NAME> by a quarter before nine on the evening of the 21st of December .
I missed the steamer at <NAME> , and as you refused to take me to <NAME> -- '' `` And I did well ! ''
cried <NAME> ; `` for I have gained at least forty thousand dollars by it ! ''
He added , more sedately , `` Do you know one thing , <NAME> -- '' `` Fogg . ''
`` Captain Fogg , you 've got something of the <NAME> about you . ''
And , having paid his passenger what he considered a high compliment , he was going away , when <NAME> said , `` The vessel now belongs to me ? ''
`` Certainly , from the keel to the truck of the masts -- all the wood , that is . ''
Have the interior seats , bunks , and frames pulled down , and burn them . ''
It was necessary to have dry wood to keep the steam up to the adequate pressure , and on that day the poop , cabins , bunks , and the spare deck were sacrificed .
On the next day , the 19th of December , the masts , rafts , and spars were burned ; the crew worked lustily , keeping up the fires .
<NAME> hewed , cut , and sawed away with all his might .
There was a perfect rage for demolition .
The railings , fittings , the greater part of the deck , and top sides disappeared on the 20th , and the <NAME> was now only a flat hulk .
But on this day they sighted the <NAME> coast and <NAME> .
By ten in the evening they were passing <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> had only twenty-four hours more in which to get to <NAME> ; that length of time was necessary to reach <NAME> , with all steam on .
And the steam was about to give out altogether !
`` Sir , '' said <NAME> , who was now deeply interested in <NAME> 's project , `` I really commiserate you .
We are only opposite Queenstown . ''
`` Ah , '' said <NAME> , `` is that place where we see the lights <NAME> ? ''
`` Can we enter the harbour ? ''
`` Stay , '' replied <NAME> calmly , without betraying in his features that by a supreme inspiration he was about to attempt once more to conquer ill-fortune .
<NAME> is the <NAME> port at which the trans-Atlantic steamers stop to put off the mails .
These mails are carried to <NAME> by express trains always held in readiness to start ; from <NAME> they are sent on to <NAME> by the most rapid boats , and thus gain twelve hours on the <NAME> steamers .
<NAME> <NAME> counted on gaining twelve hours in the same way .
Instead of arriving at <NAME> the next evening by the <NAME> , he would be there by noon , and would therefore have time to reach <NAME> before a quarter before nine in the evening .
The <NAME> entered <NAME> at one o'clock in the morning , it then being high tide ; and <NAME> , after being grasped heartily by the hand by <NAME> , left that gentleman on the levelled hulk of his craft , which was still worth half what he had sold it for .
The party went on shore at once .
<NAME> was greatly tempted to arrest <NAME> on the spot ; but he did not .
What struggle was going on within him ?
Had he changed his mind about `` his man '' ?
Did he understand that he had made a grave mistake ?
He did not , however , abandon <NAME> .
They all got upon the train , which was just ready to start , at half-past one ; at dawn of day they were in <NAME> ; and they lost no time in embarking on a steamer which , disdaining to rise upon the waves , invariably cut through them .
<NAME> <NAME> at last disembarked on the <NAME> quay , at twenty minutes before twelve , 21st December .
He was only six hours distant from <NAME> .
But at this moment <NAME> came up , put his hand upon <NAME> 's shoulder , and , showing his warrant , said , `` You are really <NAME> ? ''
`` I arrest you in the <NAME> 's name ! ''
<NAME> <NAME> was in prison .
He had been shut up in the <NAME> , and he was to be transferred to <NAME> the next day .
<NAME> , when he saw his master arrested , would have fallen upon <NAME> had he not been held back by some policemen .
<NAME> was thunderstruck at the suddenness of an event which she could not understand .
<NAME> explained to her how it was that the honest and courageous <NAME> was arrested as a robber .
The young woman 's heart revolted against so heinous a charge , and when she saw that she could attempt to do nothing to save her protector , she wept bitterly .
As for <NAME> , he had arrested <NAME> because it was his duty , whether <NAME> were guilty or not .
The thought then struck <NAME> , that he was the cause of this new misfortune !
Had he not concealed <NAME> 's errand from his master ?
When <NAME> revealed his true character and purpose , why had he not told <NAME> ?
If the latter had been warned , he would no doubt have given <NAME> proof of his innocence , and satisfied him of his mistake ; at least , <NAME> would not have continued his journey at the expense and on the heels of his master , only to arrest him the moment he set foot on <NAME> soil .
Passepartout wept till he was blind , and felt like blowing his brains out .
<NAME> and he had remained , despite the cold , under the portico of the <NAME> .
Neither wished to leave the place ; both were anxious to see <NAME> again .
That gentleman was really ruined , and that at the moment when he was about to attain his end .
Having arrived at <NAME> at twenty minutes before twelve on the 21st of December , he had till a quarter before nine that evening to reach the <NAME> , that is , nine hours and a quarter ; the journey from <NAME> to <NAME> was six hours .
If anyone , at this moment , had entered the <NAME> , he would have found <NAME> seated , motionless , calm , and without apparent anger , upon a wooden bench .
He was not , it is true , resigned ; but this last blow failed to force him into an outward betrayal of any emotion .
Was he being devoured by one of those secret rages , all the more terrible because contained , and which only burst forth , with an irresistible force , at the last moment ?
There he sat , calmly waiting -- for what ?
Did he still cherish hope ?
Did he still believe , now that the door of this prison was closed upon him , that he would succeed ?
However that may have been , <NAME> carefully put his watch upon the table , and observed its advancing hands .
Not a word escaped his lips , but his look was singularly set and stern .
The situation , in any event , was a terrible one , and might be thus stated : if <NAME> was honest he was ruined ; if he was a knave , he was caught .
Did escape occur to him ?
Did he examine to see if there were any practicable outlet from his prison ?
Did he think of escaping from it ?
<NAME> ; for once he walked slowly around the room .
But the door was locked , and the window heavily barred with iron rods .
He sat down again , and drew his journal from his pocket .
On the line where these words were written , `` 21st December , Saturday , <NAME> , '' he added , `` 80th day , 11.40 a.m. , '' and waited .
The <NAME> clock struck one .
<NAME> <NAME> observed that his watch was two hours too fast .
Admitting that he was at this moment taking an express train , he could reach <NAME> and the <NAME> by a quarter before nine , p.m. His forehead slightly wrinkled .
At thirty-three minutes past two he heard a singular noise outside , then a hasty opening of doors .
<NAME> 's voice was audible , and immediately after that of <NAME> .
<NAME> <NAME> 's eyes brightened for an instant .
The door swung open , and he saw <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> , who hurried towards him .
<NAME> was out of breath , and his hair was in disorder .
`` Sir , '' he stammered , `` sir -- forgive me -- most -- unfortunate resemblance -- robber arrested three days ago -- you are free ! ''
He walked to the detective , looked him steadily in the face , and with the only rapid motion he had ever made in his life , or which he ever would make , drew back his arms , and with the precision of a machine knocked <NAME> down .
that 's what you might call a good application of <NAME> fists ! ''
<NAME> , who found himself on the floor , did not utter a word .
He had only received his deserts .
<NAME> <NAME> , <NAME> , and <NAME> left the <NAME> without delay , got into a cab , and in a few moments descended at the station .
<NAME> <NAME> asked if there was an express train about to leave for <NAME> .
It was forty minutes past two .
The express train had left thirty-five minutes before .
<NAME> <NAME> then ordered a special train .
There were several rapid locomotives on hand ; but the railway arrangements did not permit the special train to leave until three o'clock .
At that hour <NAME> , having stimulated the engineer by the offer of a generous reward , at last set out towards <NAME> with <NAME> and his faithful servant .
It was necessary to make the journey in five hours and a half ; and this would have been easy on a clear road throughout .
But there were forced delays , and when <NAME> stepped from the train at the terminus , all the clocks in <NAME> were striking ten minutes before nine .
Having made the tour of the world , he was behind-hand five minutes .
He had lost the wager !
The dwellers in <NAME> Row would have been surprised the next day , if they had been told that <NAME> had returned home .
His doors and windows were still closed , no appearance of change was visible .
After leaving the station , <NAME> gave Passepartout instructions to purchase some provisions , and quietly went to his domicile .
He bore his misfortune with his habitual tranquillity .
And by the blundering of the detective !
After having steadily traversed that long journey , overcome a hundred obstacles , braved many dangers , and still found time to do some good on his way , to fail near the goal by a sudden event which he could not have foreseen , and against which he was unarmed ; it was terrible !
But a few pounds were left of the large sum he had carried with him .
There only remained of his fortune the twenty thousand pounds deposited at <NAME> , and this amount he owed to his friends of the <NAME> .
So great had been the expense of his tour that , even had he won , it would not have enriched him ; and it is probable that he had not sought to enrich himself , being a man who rather laid wagers for honour 's sake than for the stake proposed .
But this wager totally ruined him .
<NAME> <NAME> 's course , however , was fully decided upon ; he knew what remained for him to do .
A room in the house in <NAME> <NAME> was set apart for <NAME> , who was overwhelmed with grief at her protector 's misfortune .
From the words which <NAME> dropped , she saw that he was meditating some serious project .
Knowing that <NAME> governed by a fixed idea sometimes resort to the desperate expedient of suicide , <NAME> kept a narrow watch upon his master , though he carefully concealed the appearance of so doing .
First of all , the worthy fellow had gone up to his room , and had extinguished the gas burner , which had been burning for eighty days .
He had found in the letter-box a bill from the gas company , and he thought it more than time to put a stop to this expense , which he had been doomed to bear .
<NAME> <NAME> went to bed , but did he sleep ?
<NAME> did not once close her eyes .
Passepartout watched all night , like a faithful dog , at his master 's door .
<NAME> <NAME> called him in the morning , and told him to get <NAME> 's breakfast , and a cup of tea and a chop for himself .
He desired <NAME> to excuse him from breakfast and dinner , as his time would be absorbed all day in putting his affairs to rights .
In the evening he would ask permission to have a few moment 's conversation with the young lady .
<NAME> , having received his orders , had nothing to do but obey them .
He looked at his imperturbable master , and could scarcely bring his mind to leave him .
His heart was full , and his conscience tortured by remorse ; for he accused himself more bitterly than ever of being the cause of the irretrievable disaster .
if he had warned <NAME> , and had betrayed <NAME> 's projects to him , his master would certainly not have given the detective passage to <NAME> , and then -- Passepartout could hold in no longer .
he cried , `` why do you not curse me ?
It was my fault that -- '' `` I blame no one , '' returned <NAME> , with perfect calmness .
<NAME> left the room , and went to find <NAME> , to whom he delivered his master 's message .
`` <NAME> , '' he added , `` I can do nothing myself -- nothing !
I have no influence over my master ; but you , perhaps -- '' `` What influence could I have ? ''
`` <NAME> is influenced by no one .
Has he ever understood that my gratitude to him is overflowing ?
Has he ever read my heart ?
My friend , he must not be left alone an instant !
You say he is going to speak with me this evening ? ''
`` Yes , madam ; probably to arrange for your protection and comfort in <NAME> . ''
`` We shall see , '' replied <NAME> , becoming suddenly pensive .
Throughout this day ( Sunday ) the house in <NAME> <NAME> was as if uninhabited , and <NAME> , for the first time since he had lived in that house , did not set out for his club when Westminster clock struck half-past eleven .
Why should he present himself at the <NAME> ?
His friends no longer expected him there .
As <NAME> had not appeared in the saloon on the evening before ( Saturday , the 21st of December , at a quarter before nine ) , he had lost his wager .
It was not even necessary that he should go to his bankers for the twenty thousand pounds ; for his antagonists already had his cheque in their hands , and they had only to fill it out and send it to the <NAME> to have the amount transferred to their credit .
<NAME> <NAME> , therefore , had no reason for going out , and so he remained at home .
He shut himself up in his room , and busied himself putting his affairs in order .
<NAME> continually ascended and descended the stairs .
The hours were long for him .
He listened at his master 's door , and looked through the keyhole , as if he had a perfect right so to do , and as if he feared that something terrible might happen at any moment .
Sometimes he thought of <NAME> , but no longer in anger .
<NAME> , like all the world , had been mistaken in <NAME> , and had only done his duty in tracking and arresting him ; while he , <NAME> .
This thought haunted him , and he never ceased cursing his miserable folly .
Finding himself too wretched to remain alone , he knocked at <NAME> 's door , went into her room , seated himself , without speaking , in a corner , and looked ruefully at the young woman .
About half-past seven in the evening <NAME> sent to know if <NAME> would receive him , and in a few moments he found himself alone with her .
<NAME> <NAME> took a chair , and sat down near the fireplace , opposite Aouda .
No emotion was visible on his face .
<NAME> returned was exactly the Fogg who had gone away ; there was the same calm , the same impassibility .
He sat several minutes without speaking ; then , bending his eyes on <NAME> , `` <NAME> , '' said he , `` will you pardon me for bringing you to <NAME> ? ''
replied <NAME> , checking the pulsations of her heart .
`` Please let me finish , '' returned <NAME> .
`` When I decided to bring you far away from the country which was so unsafe for you , I was rich , and counted on putting a portion of my fortune at your disposal ; then your existence would have been free and happy .
But now I am ruined . ''
`` I know it , <NAME> , '' replied <NAME> ; `` and I ask you in my turn , will you forgive me for having followed you , and -- who knows ? -- for having , perhaps , delayed you , and thus contributed to your ruin ? ''
`` <NAME> , you could not remain in <NAME> , and your safety could only be assured by bringing you to such a distance that your persecutors could not take you . ''
`` So , <NAME> , '' resumed <NAME> , `` not content with rescuing me from a terrible death , you thought yourself bound to secure my comfort in a foreign land ? ''
`` Yes , madam ; but circumstances have been against me .
Still , I beg to place the little I have left at your service . ''
`` But what will become of you , Mr .
`` As for me , madam , '' replied the gentleman , coldly , `` I have need of nothing . ''
`` But how do you look upon the fate , sir , which awaits you ? ''
`` As I am in the habit of doing . ''
`` At least , '' said <NAME> , `` want should not overtake a man like you .
Your friends -- '' `` I have no friends , madam . ''
`` Your relatives -- '' `` I have no longer any relatives . ''
`` I pity you , then , <NAME> , for solitude is a sad thing , with no heart to which to confide your griefs .
They say , though , that misery itself , shared by two sympathetic souls , may be borne with patience . ''
`` <NAME> , '' said <NAME> , rising and seizing his hand , `` do you wish at once a kinswoman and friend ?
Will you have me for your wife ? ''
<NAME> <NAME> , at this , rose in his turn .
There was an unwonted light in his eyes , and a slight trembling of his lips .
<NAME> looked into his face .
The sincerity , rectitude , firmness , and sweetness of this soft glance of a noble woman , who could dare all to save him to whom she owed all , at first astonished , then penetrated him .
He shut his eyes for an instant , as if to avoid her look .
When he opened them again , `` I love you ! ''
`` Yes , by all that is holiest , I love you , and I am entirely yours ! ''
cried <NAME> , pressing his hand to her heart .
<NAME> was summoned and appeared immediately .
<NAME> <NAME> still held <NAME> 's hand in his own ; Passepartout understood , and his big , round face became as radiant as the tropical sun at its zenith .
<NAME> <NAME> asked him if it was not too late to notify the <NAME> , of <NAME> parish , that evening .
<NAME> smiled his most genial smile , and said , `` Never too late . ''
It was five minutes past eight .
`` Will it be for to-morrow , Monday ? ''
`` For to-morrow , Monday , '' said <NAME> , turning to <NAME> .
`` Yes ; for to-morrow , Monday , '' she replied .
<NAME> hurried off as fast as his legs could carry him .
It is time to relate what a change took place in <NAME> public opinion when it transpired that the real bankrobber , a certain <NAME> , had been arrested , on the 17th day of December , at <NAME> .
Three days before , <NAME> had been a criminal , who was being desperately followed up by the police ; now he was an honourable gentleman , mathematically pursuing his eccentric journey round the world .
The papers resumed their discussion about the wager ; all those who had laid bets , for or against him , revived their interest , as if by magic ; the `` <NAME> bonds '' again became negotiable , and many new wagers were made .
<NAME> <NAME> 's name was once more at a premium on 'Change .
His five friends of the <NAME> passed these three days in a state of feverish suspense .
Would <NAME> , whom they had forgotten , reappear before their eyes !
Where was he at this moment ?
The 17th of December , the day of <NAME> 's arrest , was the seventy-sixth since <NAME> 's departure , and no news of him had been received .
Had he abandoned the effort , or was he continuing his journey along the route agreed upon ?
And would he appear on Saturday , the 21st of December , at a quarter before nine in the evening , on the threshold of the <NAME> saloon ?
The anxiety in which , for three days , <NAME> society existed , can not be described .
Telegrams were sent to <NAME> and <NAME> for news of <NAME> .
Messengers were dispatched to the house in <NAME> Row morning and evening .
The police were ignorant what had become of the detective , <NAME> , who had so unfortunately followed up a false scent .
Bets increased , nevertheless , in number and value .
<NAME> <NAME> , like a racehorse , was drawing near his last turning-point .
The bonds were quoted , no longer at a hundred below par , but at twenty , at ten , and at five ; and paralytic old <NAME> <NAME> bet even in his favour .
A great crowd was collected in <NAME> and the neighbouring streets on Saturday evening ; it seemed like a multitude of brokers permanently established around the <NAME> .
<NAME> was impeded , and everywhere disputes , discussions , and financial transactions were going on .
The police had great difficulty in keeping back the crowd , and as the hour when <NAME> was due approached , the excitement rose to its highest pitch .
The five antagonists of <NAME> had met in the great saloon of the club .
<NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> , the bankers , <NAME> , the engineer , <NAME> , the director of the <NAME> of <NAME> , and <NAME> , the brewer , one and all waited anxiously .
When the clock indicated twenty minutes past eight , <NAME> got up , saying , `` Gentlemen , in twenty minutes the time agreed upon between <NAME> and ourselves will have expired . ''
`` What time did the last train arrive from <NAME> ? ''
`` At twenty-three minutes past seven , '' replied <NAME> ; `` and the next does not arrive till ten minutes after twelve . ''
`` Well , gentlemen , '' resumed <NAME> , `` if <NAME> had come in the 7:23 train , he would have got here by this time .
We can , therefore , regard the bet as won . ''
`` <NAME> ; do n't let us be too hasty , '' replied <NAME> .
`` You know that <NAME> is very eccentric .
His punctuality is well known ; he never arrives too soon , or too late ; and I should not be surprised if he appeared before us at the last minute . ''
`` Why , '' said <NAME> nervously , `` if I should see him , I should not believe it was he . ''
`` The fact is , '' resumed <NAME> , `` <NAME> 's project was absurdly foolish .
Whatever his punctuality , he could not prevent the delays which were certain to occur ; and a delay of only two or three days would be fatal to his tour . ''
`` Observe , too , '' added <NAME> , `` that we have received no intelligence from him , though there are telegraphic lines all along his route . ''
`` He has lost , gentleman , '' said <NAME> , `` he has a hundred times lost !
You know , besides , that the <NAME> the only steamer he could have taken from <NAME> to get here in time arrived yesterday .
I have seen a list of the passengers , and the name of <NAME> is not among them .
Even if we admit that fortune has favoured him , he can scarcely have reached <NAME> .
I think he will be at least twenty days behind-hand , and that <NAME> will lose a cool five thousand . ''
`` It is clear , '' replied <NAME> ; `` and we have nothing to do but to present <NAME> 's cheque at <NAME> to-morrow . ''
At this moment , the hands of the club clock pointed to twenty minutes to nine .
`` Five minutes more , '' said <NAME> .
The five gentlemen looked at each other .
Their anxiety was becoming intense ; but , not wishing to betray it , they readily assented to <NAME> 's proposal of a rubber .
`` I would n't give up my four thousand of the bet , '' said <NAME> , as he took his seat , `` for three thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine . ''
The clock indicated eighteen minutes to nine .
The players took up their cards , but could not keep their eyes off the clock .
Certainly , however secure they felt , minutes had never seemed so long to them !
`` Seventeen minutes to nine , '' said <NAME> , as he cut the cards which <NAME> handed to him .
Then there was a moment of silence .
The great saloon was perfectly quiet ; but the murmurs of the crowd outside were heard , with now and then a shrill cry .
The pendulum beat the seconds , which each player eagerly counted , as he listened , with mathematical regularity .
said <NAME> , in a voice which betrayed his emotion .
One minute more , and the wager would be won .
<NAME> <NAME> and his partners suspended their game .
They left their cards , and counted the seconds .
At the fortieth second , nothing .
At the fiftieth , still nothing .
At the fifty-fifth , a loud cry was heard in the street , followed by applause , hurrahs , and some fierce growls .
The players rose from their seats .
At the fifty-seventh second the door of the saloon opened ; and the pendulum had not beat the sixtieth second when <NAME> appeared , followed by an excited crowd who had forced their way through the club doors , and in his calm voice , said , `` Here I am , gentlemen ! ''
Yes ; <NAME> in person .
The reader will remember that at five minutes past eight in the evening -- about five and twenty hours after the arrival of the travellers in <NAME> -- <NAME> had been sent by his master to engage the services of the <NAME> in a certain marriage ceremony , which was to take place the next day .
<NAME> went on his errand enchanted .
He soon reached the clergyman 's house , but found him not at home .
Passepartout waited a good twenty minutes , and when he left the reverend gentleman , it was thirty-five minutes past eight .
But in what a state he was !
With his hair in disorder , and without his hat , he ran along the street as never man was seen to run before , overturning passers-by , rushing over the sidewalk like a waterspout .
In three minutes he was in <NAME> Row again , and staggered back into <NAME> 's room .
`` You have made a mistake of one day !
We arrived twenty-four hours ahead of time ; but there are only ten minutes left ! ''
<NAME> had seized his master by the collar , and was dragging him along with irresistible force .
<NAME> <NAME> , thus kidnapped , without having time to think , left his house , jumped into a cab , promised a hundred pounds to the cabman , and , having run over two dogs and overturned five carriages , reached the <NAME> .
The clock indicated a quarter before nine when he appeared in the great saloon .
<NAME> <NAME> had accomplished the journey round the world in eighty days !
<NAME> <NAME> had won his wager of twenty thousand pounds !
How was it that a man so exact and fastidious could have made this error of a day ?
How came he to think that he had arrived in <NAME> on Saturday , the twenty-first day of December , when it was really Friday , the twentieth , the seventy-ninth day only from his departure ?
The cause of the error is very simple .
<NAME> <NAME> had , without suspecting it , gained one day on his journey , and this merely because he had travelled constantly eastward ; he would , on the contrary , have lost a day had he gone in the opposite direction , that is , westward .
In journeying eastward he had gone towards the sun , and the days therefore diminished for him as many times four minutes as he crossed degrees in this direction .
There are three hundred and sixty degrees on the circumference of the earth ; and these three hundred and sixty degrees , multiplied by four minutes , gives precisely twenty-four hours -- that is , the day unconsciously gained .
In other words , while <NAME> , going eastward , saw the sun pass the meridian eighty times , his friends in <NAME> only saw it pass the meridian seventy-nine times .
This is why they awaited him at the <NAME> on Saturday , and not Sunday , as <NAME> thought .
And <NAME> 's famous family watch , which had always kept <NAME> time , would have betrayed this fact , if it had marked the days as well as the hours and the minutes !
<NAME> <NAME> , then , had won the twenty thousand pounds ; but , as he had spent nearly nineteen thousand on the way , the pecuniary gain was small .
His object was , however , to be victorious , and not to win money .
He divided the one thousand pounds that remained between Passepartout and the unfortunate Fix , against whom he cherished no grudge .
He deducted , however , from <NAME> 's share the cost of the gas which had burned in his room for nineteen hundred and twenty hours , for the sake of regularity .
That evening , <NAME> , as tranquil and phlegmatic as ever , said to <NAME> : `` Is our marriage still agreeable to you ? ''
`` <NAME> , '' replied she , `` it is for me to ask that question .
You were ruined , but now you are rich again . ''
`` Pardon me , madam ; my fortune belongs to you .
If you had not suggested our marriage , my servant would not have gone to the <NAME> 's , I should not have been apprised of my error , and -- '' `` Dear Mr .
It need not be said that the marriage took place forty-eight hours after , and that <NAME> , glowing and dazzling , gave the bride away .
Had he not saved her , and was he not entitled to this honour ?
The next day , as soon as it was light , <NAME> rapped vigorously at his master 's door .
<NAME> <NAME> opened it , and asked , `` What 's the matter , <NAME> ? ''
Why , I 've just this instant found out -- '' `` What ? ''
`` That we might have made the tour of the world in only seventy-eight days . ''
`` No doubt , '' returned <NAME> , `` by not crossing <NAME> .
But if I had not crossed <NAME> , I should not have saved <NAME> ; she would not have been my wife , and -- '' <NAME> quietly shut the door .
<NAME> <NAME> had won his wager , and had made his journey around the world in eighty days .
To do this he had employed every means of conveyance -- steamers , railways , carriages , yachts , trading-vessels , sledges , elephants .
The eccentric gentleman had throughout displayed all his marvellous qualities of coolness and exactitude .
What had he really gained by all this trouble ?
What had he brought back from this long and weary journey ?
Perhaps so ; nothing but a charming woman , who , strange as it may appear , made him the happiest of men !
Truly , would you not for less than that make the tour around the world ?
